https://openalex.org/W2005792688,"The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway is a conserved eukaryotic signaling module that converts receptor signals into various outputs. MAPK is activated through phosphorylation by MAPK kinase (MAPKK), which is first activated by MAPKK kinase (MAPKKK). A genetic selection based on a MAPK pathway in yeast was used to identify a mouse protein kinase (TAK1) distinct from other members of the MAPKKK family. TAK1 was shown to participate in regulation of transcription by transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta). Furthermore, kinase activity of TAK1 was stimulated in response to TGF-beta and bone morphogenetic protein. These results suggest that TAK1 functions as a mediator in the signaling pathway of TGF-beta superfamily members."

The project involved assembly of a radiation hybrid map of the human genome containing 6193 loci and incorporated a genetic linkage map of the human genome containing 5264 loci. This information was combined with the results of STS-content screening of 10,850 loci against a yeast artificial chromosome library to produce an integrated map, anchored by the radiation hybrid and genetic maps. The map provides radiation hybrid coverage of 99 percent and physical coverage of 94 percent of the human genome. The map also represents an early step in an international project to generate a transcript map of the human genome, with more than 3235 expressed sequences localized. The STSs in the map provide a scaffold for initiating large-scale sequencing of the human genome."

Two bHLH genes, dHAND and eHAND, have now been isolated that are expressed in the bilateral heart primordia and subsequently throughout the primitive tubular heart and its derivatives during chick and mouse embryogenesis. Incubation of stage 8 chick embryos with dHAND and eHAND antisense oligonucleotides revealed that either oligonucleotide alone had no effect on embryonic development, whereas together they arrested development at the looping heart tube stage. Thus, dHAND and eHAND may play redundant roles in the regulation of the morphogenetic events of vertebrate heart development."

Transcripts of the corresponding gene were not observed in healthy tobacco leaves but began to accumulate 1 minute after mechanical wounding. In tobacco plants transformed with the cloned complementary DNA, trans inactivation of the endogenous homologous gene occurred, and both production of wound-induced jasmonic acid and accumulation of wound-inducible gene transcripts were inhibited. In contrast, the levels of salicylic acid and transcripts for pathogen-inducible, acidic pathogenesis-related proteins were increased upon wounding. These results indicate that this MAP kinase is part of the initial response of higher plants to mechanical wounding."
https://openalex.org/W2019774786,"Cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2) is activated by a wide variety of stimuli to release arachidonic acid, the precursor of the potent inflammatory mediators prostaglandin and leukotriene. Specifically, cPLA2 releases arachidonic acid in response to agents that increase intracellular Ca2+. In vitro data have suggested that these agents induce a translocation of cPLA2 from the cytosol to the cell membrane, where its substrate is localized. Here, we use immunofluorescence to visualize the translocation of cPLA2 to distinct cellular membranes. In Chinese hamster ovary cells that stably overexpress cPLA2, this enzyme translocates to the nuclear envelope upon stimulation with the calcium ionophore A23187. The pattern of staining observed in the cytoplasm suggests that cPLA2 also translocates to the endoplasmic reticulum. We find no evidence for cPLA2 localization to the plasma membrane. Translocation of cPLA2 is dependent on the calcium-dependent phospholipid binding domain, as a calcium-dependent phospholipid binding deletion mutant of cPLA2 (ΔCII) fails to translocate in response to Ca2+. In contrast, cPLA2 mutated at Ser-505, the site of mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphorylation, translocates normally. This observation, combined with the observed phosphorylation of ΔCII, establishes that translocation and phosphorylation function independently to regulate cPLA2. The effect of these mutations on cPLA2 translocation was confirmed by subcellular fractionation. Each of these mutations abolished the ability of cPLA2 to release arachidonic acid, establishing that cPLA2-mediated arachidonic acid release is strongly dependent on both phosphorylation and translocation. These data help to clarify the mechanisms by which cPLA2 is regulated in intact cells and establish the nuclear envelope and endoplasmic reticulum as primary sites for the liberation of arachidonic acid in the cell.

https://openalex.org/W2016470388,"Recently the sphingomyelin cycle, involving the hydrolysis of membrane sphingomyelin by an activated sphingomyelinase to generate ceramide, has emerged as a key pathway in cell differentiation and apoptosis in leukemic and other cell types. Here we investigate a role for this pathway in the senescence of WI-38 human diploid fibroblasts (HDF). We found that endogenous levels of ceramide increased considerably (4-fold) and specifically (compared with other lipids) as cells entered the senescent phase. Investigation of the mechanism of increased ceramide led to the discovery that neutral sphingomyelinase activity is elevated 8-10 fold in senescent cells. There were no changes in sphingomyelinase activity or ceramide levels as HDF entered quiescence following serum withdrawal or contact inhibition. Thus, the activation of the sphingomyelinase/ceramide pathway in HDF is due to senescence and supports the hypotheses that senescence represents a distinct program of cell development that can be differentiated from quiescence. Additional studies disclosed the ability of ceramide to induce a senescent phenotype. Thus, when exogenous ceramide (15 μM) was administered to young WI-38 HDF, it produced endogenous levels comparable to those observed in senescent cells (as determined by metabolic labeling studies). Ceramide concentrations of 10-15 μM inhibited the growth of young HDF and induced a senescent phenotype by its ability to inhibit DNA synthesis and mitogenesis. These concentrations of ceramide also induced retinoblastoma dephosphorylation and inhibited serum-induced AP-1 activation in young HDF, thus recapitulating basic biochemical and molecular changes of senescence. Sphingomyelinase and ceramide may thus be implicated as mediators of cellular senescence.

These concentrations of ceramide also induced retinoblastoma dephosphorylation and inhibited serum-induced AP-1 activation in young HDF, thus recapitulating basic biochemical and molecular changes of senescence. Sphingomyelinase and ceramide may thus be implicated as mediators of cellular senescence. Cellular senescence is defined as the limited capacity of cells to undergo population doublings(1.Hayflick L. Exp. Cell Res. 1965; 37: 614-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (4330) Google Scholar); consequently, cells have a finite life span beyond which they can no longer proliferate. This finite life span correlates with the age of the organism and with the life expectancy of the species from which the cells were obtained; such that the older the age or the shorter the life span, the less the ability of the cells to undergo population doubling(1.Hayflick L. Exp. Cell Res. 1965; 37: 614-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (4330) Google Scholar). Several important observations have been made in understanding the senescent phenotype. Senescence is a dominant process as demonstrated by cell fusion experiments demonstrating that the resultant heterokaryons have a finite life span (2.Norwood T.H. Pendergrass W.R. Sprague C.A. Martin G.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1974; 71: 2231-2235Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) and by the presence of factors from senescent cells that inhibit DNA synthesis in young cells (3.Lumpkin C.K. McClung J.K. Pereira-Smith O.M. Smith J.R. Science. 1986; 232: 393-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Senescence also appears to be an “irreversible” process, although it may be overridden by DNA tumor viruses leading to proliferation(4.Rubelj I. Pereira-Smith O.M. Exp. Cell Res. 1994; 211: 82-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Several known biochemical parameters of senescence are beginning to shed light on the underlying mechanisms involved in this developmental program. These include lack of c-fos transcription (5.Seshadri T. Campisi J. Science. 1990; 247: 205-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar) and AP-1 activation(6.Riabowol K. Schiff J. Gilman M.Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 157-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar), presence of the Rb protein in a predominantly dephosphorylated form(7.Stein G.H. Beeson M. Gordon L. Science. 1990; 249: 666-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar), and the occurrence of several alterations in cell cycle proteins(8.Stein G.H. Drullinger L.F. Robetorye R.S.

Cell Res. 1994; 211: 90-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (1317) Google Scholar), leading to inhibition of DNA synthesis and lack of cell cycle progression. Little is known about signal transduction pathways in cell senescence and less is known about lipid-mediated signaling pathways in senescence. We have recently demonstrated that senescent cells have a defect in the phospholipase D/diacylglycerol/protein kinase C pathway(11.Venable M.E. Blobe G.C. Obeid L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26040-26044Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Ceramide, a key molecule in sphingolipid metabolism and a candidate second messenger, has been shown to inhibit phospholipase D (11.Venable M.E. Blobe G.C. Obeid L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26040-26044Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12.Gomez-Munoz A. Martin A. O'Brien L. Brindley D.N. J. Biol.

Chem. 1994; 269: 18384-18389Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This may implicate the recently described sphingomyelin cycle in cell senescence. This novel biochemical pathway has been shown to regulate cell differentiation and apoptosis(14.Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3125-3128Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this cycle, sphingomyelin is hydrolyzed by a neutral sphingomyelinase, and ceramide is generated in response to a number of extracellular inducers. Ceramide acts as a second messenger to mediate many of the effects of these inducers(14.Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3125-3128Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Here we investigate the role of the sphingomyelinase/ceramide pathway in cellular senescence of fibroblasts, the prototypic model of senescence. We demonstrate that ceramide is a potent inhibitor of growth in young WI-38 HDF. 1The abbreviations used are: HDFhuman diploid fibroblastsC6-ceramideN-hexanoyl-sphingosinePBSphosphate-buffered salinePDpopulation doublingsRbretinoblastomaFBSfetal bovine serumPDMPD-threo-1-phenyl-2-decanoylamine-3-morpholino-1-propanolYSSyoung serum-stimulated. We also demonstrate that endogenous ceramide levels and a neutral magnesium-dependent sphingomyelinase activity are markedly elevated in senescent cells. We show that exogenous ceramide is able to induce a senescent phenotype in young HDF at concentrations that mimic endogenous levels in senescent cells. This was demonstrated by the ability of ceramide to inhibit DNA synthesis, AP-1 activation, and Rb phosphorylation; all important biochemical markers of senescence. We propose that ceramide is a mediator of cellular senescence. human diploid fibroblasts N-hexanoyl-sphingosine phosphate-buffered saline population doublings retinoblastoma fetal bovine serum D-threo-1-phenyl-2-decanoylamine-3-morpholino-1-propanol young serum-stimulated. D-Erythro-C6-ceramide and N-[14C]hexanoyl-D-erythro-sphingosine (C6-ceramide) were prepared as described previously(15.Bielawska A. Crane H.M. Liotta D. Obeid L.M. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26226-26232Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). C6-ceramide was purchased from New England Nuclear as was the [γ32P]ATP. Silica gel 60 thin-layer chromatography plates were from Whatman, and solvents were supplied by Fisher Scientific. NTB-2 bulk emulsion was from Kodak. Anti-Rb antibodies were from Pharmingen, and the biotinylated rabbit anti-mouse IgG1 antibodies were from Amersham Corp., whereas the streptavidin-conjugated horseradish peroxidase and related reagents were from Bio-Rad. [3H]Thymidine was from ICN. D-threo-PDMP was from Matreya, Inc. Other reagents were purchased from Sigma. Young or senescent WI-38 HDF (NIA Aging Cell Repository catalog number AG06814E) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 4.5 g/liter glucose and 10% FBS. Cells were passaged to increasing population doublings until they reached senescence at approximately PD (55). Cells were maintained at 37°C in 5% CO2 and fed two times/week. Routine tests verified that the cells were free of mycoplasma. Young and senescent WI-38 HDF were seeded in 24-well plates at 1.5 × 104 cells/well. Cells were fed after 2 days and then refed 5 days later with fresh 10% FBS-containing medium for 16 h. [3H]Thymidine (0.5 μCi/ml) was added for the last 4 h, the cells were harvested, and the trichloroacetic acid-insoluble pellet was counted. For studies of ceramide's effect on growth and thymidine incorporation, cells were seeded as above and treated on day 3 with the indicated concentrations of C6-ceramide in ethanol vehicle (0.1%). PDMP was added as indicated at the same time as C6-ceramides. Cells were either used for thymidine incorporation studies performed as above or harvested at the indicated times and counted after trypan blue exclusion. Ceramide wash out experiments were performed as above except that after 48 h of incubation with ceramide, the cells were washed with medium containing 10% FCS. This brought ceramide levels back to base line as determined by studies using 14C-labeled C6-ceramide (see below). Thymidine incorporation was determined 24 h later. Young WI-38 HDF were seeded in 12-well plates at a concentration of 9 × 104 cells/well. After 48 h the cells were incubated with 0.4 μCi/well of [3H]thymidine for 24 h. Cells were washed twice with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% FCS and incubated with medium containing 2% FCS. Cells were treated with the indicated concentrations of C6-ceramide in ethanol vehicle for 24 h. The medium was aspirated and counted. The cells were lysed with PBS containing 1% Triton X-100 and 0.2 μM EDTA. The cells were centrifuged for 15 min at 14,000 rpm in a microcentrifuge. The supernatant was counted, and the remaining pellet containing larger DNA fragments was counted. The percentage of apoptosis was calculated by adding the counts in the medium and the supernatant and dividing by the total counts(16.Obeid L.M. Linardic C.M. Karolak L.A. Hannun Y.A. Science. 1993; 259: 1769-1771Crossref PubMed Scopus (1618) Google Scholar). Cells were treated with C6-ceramide as above for trypan blue exclusion studies except that after 24 h cells were washed with PBS, treated with trypsin, and mixed with trypan blue (0.4%). WI-38 cells at different PD were seeded at a concentration of 4 × 104 cells/well in 12-well plates. Cells were harvested before confluence and 5 days after the last feeding. The medium was aspirated, and the cells were scraped into 1 ml of methanol. Lipids in the suspension were extracted as described(17.Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (43133) Google Scholar), assayed for ceramide (80% of sample) by the diacylglycerol kinase method(18.Preiss J. Loomis C.R. Bishop W.R. Stein R. Niedel J.E. Bell R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 8597-8600Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), normalized to total cellular phospholipid (20% of sample)(19.Rouser G. Siakotos A.N. Fleischer S. Lipids. 1966; 1: 85-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (1320) Google Scholar), and represented as pmol of ceramide/nmol of lipid phosphorous. Exponentially growing cells were harvested 2 days after seeding. Quiescent cells were either serum-deprived for 48 h or allowed to become contact-inhibited in the presence of medium containing 10% FCS. Cultures of young and senescent WI-38 HDF were washed with PBS scraped into methanol and extracted(17.Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (43133) Google Scholar). The solvent was evaporated using a stream of N2. The lipids were resuspended in 1 ml of CHCl3, and a portion of the sample was removed and assayed for lipid phosphorous(19.Rouser G. Siakotos A.N. Fleischer S. Lipids. 1966; 1: 85-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (1320) Google Scholar). 2 N methanolic NaOH (100 μl) was added to the remainder of the sample as well as known standards of sphingomyelin treated in parallel. This was incubated at 37°C for 1 h and then neutralized while vortexing with 2 N HCl (100 μl). The reaction mixture was then extracted(17.Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (43133) Google Scholar). The solvent was evaporated, and the lipids were resuspended in CHCl3 and chromatographed on silica gel 60 TLC plates (Whatman) in CHCl3:methanol:acetic acid:water (50:30:8:4). Sphingomyelin was visualized with I2 vapors then scraped and quantitated by lipid phosphorous analysis(19.Rouser G. Siakotos A.N. Fleischer S. Lipids. 1966; 1: 85-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (1320) Google Scholar). WI-38 HDF were prepared as described(20.Suzuki K. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 138: 727-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Cells (approximately 5 × 106 cells) were washed with PBS, scraped, centrifuged (300 × g for 5 min), and resuspended in 20 μM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1 μM ATP, 5 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 12 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 21 μg/ml Nα-tosyl-L-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone, 21 μg/ml N-tosyl-L-lysine chloromethyl ketone. Cells were broken (greater than 95%) by four cycles of freezing and thawing, and protein was quantitated by the Bio-Rad microassay. N-[14C]Methylsphingomyelin (130,000 dpm, 20 nmol in chloroform:methanol (9:1)) was prepared as described (21.Stoffel W. LeKim D. Tschung T.S. Hoppe-Seyler's Z. Physiol. Chem. 1971; 352: 1058-1064Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) and added with Triton X-100 (Sigma, 100 μg in chloroform:methanol (9:1)) to each polypropylene assay tube. The solvents were evaporated using N2, and the substrate was resuspended in 0.2 M sodium acetate (pH 5.0, “acid sphingomyelinase”) or 0.2 M Tris-HCl (pH 7.4, “neutral sphingomyelinase”) with or without 10 μM MgCl2 with vortexing (22.Jayadev S. Linardic C.M. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5757-5763Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cell homogenates were added to the substrate, and the volume was adjusted to 200 μl with the respective buffer. Incubations proceeded at 37°C for 30 min and were stopped with 1.5 ml of chloroform:methanol (1:2). Water soluble [14C]phosphorylcholine product was separated from lipid substrate by extraction(23.Folch J. Lees M. Stanley G.H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1957; 226: 497-509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and 50% of each phase was dried in an 80°C oven and quantified by liquid scintillation spectrometry. Neutral magnesium-dependent activity was calculated by subtracting dpm from neutral activity in the presence of magnesium from those in the absence of magnesium. WI-38 cells were seeded at a density of 9.0 × 104 cells/well in 12-well plates. Cells were treated with 15 μM (120 μCi/mmol) [14C]hexanoyl]-C6-D-erythro-ceramide. After the indicated time the medium was removed, and the cells were washed two times with PBS and scraped into 1 ml of PBS. The cells were sonicated and then centrifuged in a TLA-100.3 rotor for 1.5 h at 40,000 rpm. Pellets were resuspended in 1 ml of PBS. Counts were obtained from 10% of each of medium, cytosol, and membrane. Lipids were extracted from the remaining 90% of the different fractions. 10% of the lipids were spotted on Silica Gel 60 (Whatman) thin-layer chromatography plates and resolved in chloroform:methanol (80:20). Metabolites were located by autoradiography, scraped, and quantitated by liquid scintillation counting. Samples (20%) were also analyzed for total phospholipid phosphate. For ceramide wash out experiments, [14C]C6-ceramide was washed out after 48 h with medium containing 10% FCS. The cells were then placed in this medium for 24 h and extracted as described above. WI-38 HDF were grown to 50% confluence. Cells were then growth arrested by serum deprivation in the presence or the absence of the indicated concentrations of C6-ceramide. Cells were then stimulated with medium containing 10% FBS in the presence of 40 μCi/ml of [3H]thymidine and in the continued presence of C6-ceramide in ethanol vehicle where indicated. At 48 h, cells were fixed with acetic acid:methanol (1:3). Cells were coated with NTB-2 bulk emulsion (Kodak), exposed for 3 days at 4°C, developed, and stained with Wright-Giemsa exactly as described (24.Afshari C.A. Barrett J.C. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 2317-2321PubMed Google Scholar). Young or senescent WI-38 HDF were grown to preconfluence. The cells were then placed in 0.1% FBS-containing medium for 48 h. Ethanol vehicle or ceramide (10 μM) was added to the young cells for that time. The cells were then either kept in the same medium or stimulated with 10% FBS-containing medium for 30 min. The cells were harvested and the nuclear extracts were obtained exactly as described(25.Dbaibo G. Obeid L.M. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17762-17766Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Gel shift assays were performed utilizing either the labeled AP-1 oligonucleotide 5′-CGCTTGATGAGTCAGCCGGAA-3′ (Promega) or the labeled oligonucleotide 5′-CGCTTGATGACTTGGCCGGAA-3′ with a mutated AP-1 site (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) as described by the manufacturer. Where indicated an antibody for c-Fos (Santa Cruz Biotechnology catalog number sc-52) was used in the gel shift reaction. WI-38 cells (PD 20) were grown to late log phase (except for exponentially growing young cells and senescent cells, which were harvested 2 days after refeeding) on 100 × 20-mm tissue culture dishes in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% FBS. For determination of dose response of ceramide inhibition of Rb phosphorylation, cells were serum-deprived by incubation for an additional 48 h in medium containing 0.1% FBS with or without the indicated ceramide concentration. Where indicated the cells were restimulated with medium containing 10% FBS and the appropriate ceramide concentration for 20 h. For determination of the time course of ceramide-induced Rb dephosphorylation, C6-ceramide (15 μM) was added to randomly proliferating cells. Cells were rinsed in PBS and lysed in hot solubilizing buffer. Proteins were fractionated on 6% gels by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, immunoblotted, and detected with anti-Rb antibodies, biotinylated rabbit anti-mouse IgG1, and streptavidin-conjugated horseradish peroxidase(26.Chao R. Khan W. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23459-23462Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We utilized WI-38 HDF at various PD. Young HDF (PD 20-30) were able to grow rapidly in culture as indicated by their ability to incorporate thymidine in response to serum stimulation into newly synthesized DNA. Senescent cells (PD 55-60) were unable to proliferate as indicated by their inability to grow even at 3 weeks after seeding and by their inability to incorporate significant [3H]thymidine into DNA in response to serum (Fig. 1A). Ceramide potently inhibited growth of WI-38 HDF. Young, rapidly proliferating cells grown in the presence of D-erythro-C6-ceramide (a cell-permeable ceramide), at concentrations of 5-15 μM, underwent complete growth arrest analogous to senescent cells (Fig. 1B). High concentrations of C6-ceramide appeared cytotoxic, whereby concentrations of greater than 20 μM induced apoptosis as measured by thymidine release (Fig. 1C, top) and as confirmed by trypan blue uptake (Fig. 1C, bottom). Because ceramide was able to cause growth arrest in WI-38 HDF and induce terminal differentiation in HL-60 cells (27.Okazaki T. Bielawska A. Bell R.M. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15823-15831Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and because senescent cells appear to behave similar to growth-arrested and terminally differentiated cells(28.Peacocke M. Campisi J. J. Cell. Biochem. 1991; 45: 147-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), we investigated the hypothesis that sphingomyelinase and endogenous ceramide may play a role in inducing cell senescence. Initially, we measured ceramide levels in young, old, and senescent WI-38 HDF and correlated ceramide levels to PD elapsed. Ceramide levels remained stable with increasing population doublings as long as the cells were able to proliferate. The capacity to proliferate may also be quantitated as the number of PD remaining. In the experiments shown in Fig. 2, HDF demonstrated a finite PD of 61 after which cells remained metabolically active but failed to grow or take up thymidine. Fig. 2A shows that ceramide levels in young cells (40 PD remaining) were 3.5 ± 0.05 pmol/nmol lipid phosphate. As the PD remaining decreased to 20, ceramide levels remained unchanged. However, when PD remaining decreased further, ceramide levels began to increase to 6.0 ± 0.5 pmol/nmol lipid phosphate. When all cells became senescent, ceramide increased to 14.7 ± 0.8 pmol/nmol lipid phosphate or 4.2-fold over young cells. On the other hand, diacylglycerol levels measured concurrently with ceramide levels increased only modestly with cellular senescence (Fig. 2A). These levels are corrected for total membrane phospholipid content and therefore reflect specific changes in ceramide. In addition, sphingomyelin mass measurements were performed on young and senescent Wi38 HDF and were 58.6 ± 2.9 and 42.5 ± 2.9 pmol/nmol lipid phosphate, respectively. A neutral sphingomyelinase has been implicated in the generation of ceramide in response to inducers of differentiation and growth arrest (29.Okazaki T. Bell R.M. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19076-19080Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30.Okazaki T. Bielawska A. Domae N. Bell R.M. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol.

Indeed, we demonstrate an 8-fold increase in neutral magnesium-dependent sphingomyelinase activity in protein extracts from senescent cells (Fig. 2B) as compared with young HDF. In contrast, acid sphingomyelinase, a well characterized lysosomal enzyme(32.Spence M.W. Adv. Lipid Res. 1993; 26: 3-23PubMed Google Scholar), had higher base-line activity in young HDF but increased only modestly in senescent extracts (Fig. 2B). These remarkable increases in ceramide levels, in ceramide:diacylglycerol ratio, and in neutral sphingomyelinase activity were even more marked than those observed in cell differentiation(27.Okazaki T. Bielawska A. Bell R.M. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15823-15831Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). They also represent permanent (stable and prolonged) increases in ceramide and sphingomyelinase activity as opposed to the transient signaling increases in response to inducers of apoptosis or differentiation such as tumor necrosis factor α (33.Kim M.-Y. Linardic C. Obeid L. Hannun Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 484-489Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and dihydroxyvitamin D3(27.Okazaki T. Bielawska A. Bell R.M. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15823-15831Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In order to evaluate if those increases in ceramide levels and sphingomyelinase activity were specific to senescence or were a consequence of growth arrest, we performed the same measurements in exponentially growing and in quiescent HDF. Exponentially growing cells were harvested 2 days after seeding, whereas quiescent cells were rendered so either by 48 h of incubation in medium containing 0.1% FBS or by contact inhibition in the presence of 10% FCS and then harvested. The conditions for quiescence were determined as follows: WI-38 cells were seeded at 1 × 106 cells in 10-cm plates. 2 days later the cells were placed in medium containing 0.1% FBS for 48 h. The cells were then harvested for determination of either their labeling index or for flow cytometry studies as described (34.Walker P.R. Kwast-Welfeld J. Gourdeau H. Leblanc J. Neugebauer W. Sikorska M. Exp. Cell Res. 1993; 207: 142-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) using a Becton Dickinson FACStarPlus flow cytometer (San Jose, CA). The cells showed a labeling index of <2%, and flow studies demonstrated that 97% of the cells were in the G1 phase of the cell cycle. Cells allowed to become quiescent by contact inhibition in the presence of 10% FCS demonstrated a similar cell cycle profile. Upon determination of ceramide levels (Fig. 2C), we demonstrated that there was no difference between quiescent and exponentially growing young HDF; also there was no difference in neutral sphingomyelinase activity between quiescent and exponentially growing young HDF (Fig. 2D). Therefore, the changes in sphingomyelinase and ceramide seen were specific to senescence and not a mere consequence of growth arrest. These increases in ceramide levels and sphingomyelinase activity coupled with the inability of senescent cells to respond to mitogenic stimuli led us to investigate whether ceramide imparts the senescent phenotype to young HDF. We examined several biological and biochemical parameters of senescence. Senescent cells, unlike young quiescent cells, are unable to undergo DNA synthesis and are unable to divide in response to serum or growth factor stimulation (Fig. 1)(28.Peacocke M. Campisi J. J. Cell. Biochem. 1991; 45: 147-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In order to mimic the persistent elevation of endogenous ceramide in senescent cells, young HDF were treated with concentrations of exogenous C6-ceramide for 1-3 days, which resulted in a persistent elevation in cellular ceramide levels comparable to those seen in senescent cells. This was demonstrated by uptake and metabolism studies utilizing [14C]hexanoyl-sphingosine (15 μM) (Table 1) or hexanoyl-[3H]sphingosine (not shown). The cells took up 16% of the label within 1 h. By 24 and 48 h, 44 and 63%, respectively, of the C6-ceramide radiolabel (Rf 0.73 in chloroform:methanol (80:20)) was metabolized to two predominant compounds, Rf = 0.37 and 0, which were observed first as cell-associated but then accumulated in the medium. These products have not been identified but do not appear to be the simple sphingosine, triglyceride, sphingomyelin, or glycosphingolipid metabolites. Membrane-associated radiolabel was 35% ceramide at 24 h and only 26% by 48 h. To compare effective added C6-ceramide levels, we calculated the ratio of C6-ceramide to total lipid. At 24 h, cell membranes contained 22 pmol of ceramide/nmol of lipid phosphate. This decreased to 18 pmol/nmol of lipid phosphate by 48 h. These levels closely resemble endogenous ceramide levels found in senescent fibroblasts (see Fig. 2A).Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab We next elected to evaluate the ability of ceramide to impart senescence by evaluating inhibition of DNA synthesis, a known biological parameter of senescence. C6-ceramide (5-20 μM) treatment for 24 h progressively inhibited [3H]thymidine incorporation in young HDF in response to serum (Fig. 3A). There was no difference in the degree of inhibition of new DNA synthesis if the cells were kept in the presence of ceramide for up to 60 h (data not shown). These data demonstrate that ceramide is a potent inhibitor of DNA synthesis in young HDF. When C6-ceramide was washed out with 10% FCS-containing medium, intracellular ceramide levels returned to base line as documented by studies using 14C-labeled C6-ceramide, and the cells were able to resume growth and undergo DNA synthesis at the same rate as control cells (data not shown). This raised the intriguing possibility that senescence may be reversible if ceramide levels can be brought down to levels seen in young cells. Because a family of ceramide metabolites, glycosphingolipids, have been reported to be growth inhibitory(35.Barbour S. Edidin M. Felding-Ha"

A complementary DNA encoding the ARF1 GAP was cloned from rat liver and predicts a protein with a zinc finger motif near the amino terminus. The GAP function required an intact zinc finger and additional amino-terminal residues. The ARF1 GAP was localized to the Golgi complex and was redistributed into a cytosolic pattern when cells were treated with brefeldin A, a drug that prevents ARF1-dependent association of coat proteins with the Golgi. Thus, the GAP is likely to be recruited to the Golgi by an ARF1-dependent mechanism."

Furthermore, the 6H1 orphan receptor, cloned from activated chicken T lymphocytes, exhibits a significant degree of homology to the P2Y1 and P2Y2 receptors, suggesting that it also belongs to the P2Y family, although its responsiveness to nucleotides has not yet been demonstrated(14.Kaplan M.H.

Degenerate oligonucleotide primers were synthesized on the basis of the best conserved segments between the murine P2Y2 and the chick P2Y1 receptor sequences. These primers were used to amplify novel receptor gene fragments by low stringency PCR starting from human genomic DNA. The amplification conditions were as follows: 93°C, 1 min, 50°C, 2 min, 72°C, 3 min; 35 cycles. The PCR products with sizes compatible with P2 receptor gene fragments were subcloned in M13mp18 and M13mp19 and sequenced by the Sanger dideoxy nucleotide chain termination method. One of the resulting clones sharing similarities with P2 receptors was labeled by random priming and used to screen a human genomic DNA library constructed in the λCharon 4a vector. The hybridization was in 6 × SSC (1 × SSC: 0.15 M NaCl, 0.015 M sodium citrate) and 40% formamide at 42°C for 14 h, and the final wash conditions were 0.1 × SSC, 0.1% SDS at 65°C. A preparation of λphages (15.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1989Google Scholar) was made for several purified clones which hybridized strongly with the probe. A restriction map and a Southern blotting analysis allowed to isolate a 1.4-kb NheI-EcoRV fragment that was subcloned into the pBluescript SK+ vector (Stratagene). The complete sequence of the new receptor coding sequence was obtained on both strands after subcloning of overlapping fragments in M13mp18 and M13mp19. The P2Y4 receptor coding sequence was subcloned between the HindIII and the EcoRV sites of the pcDNA3 expression vector for transfection into 1321N1 human astrocytoma cells, a cell line which does not respond to nucleotides and which has already been used for the expression of purinergic receptors(6.Filtz T.M.

The selection with G418 (400 μg/ml) was started 2 days after transfection. From the pool of transfected 1321N1 cells, individual clones were isolated by limiting dilution with the aim of selecting clones with high IP stimulation factors in response to nucleotides. The different clones were maintained in a medium containing 400 μg/ml G418. 1321N1 cells were labeled for 24 h with 10 μCi/ml [3H]inositol in inositol-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 5% FCS, antibiotics, amphotericin, and 2 units/ml apyrase as described (6.Filtz T.M.

Cells were washed twice with Krebs-Ringer Hepes (KRH) buffer of the following composition (124 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 1.25 mM MgSO4, 1.45 mM CaCl2, 1.25 mM KH2PO4, 25 mM Hepes (pH 7.4), and 8 mM glucose) and incubated in the same medium supplemented with 10 mM LiCl for 5 min before the addition of the agonists. The incubation was stopped after 20 min by the addition of an ice-cold 3% perchloric acid solution. IP were extracted and separated on Dowex columns as described previously(17.Communi D. Raspe E. Pirotton S. Boeynaems J.M. Circ. Res. 1995; 76: 191-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Total and poly(A)+ RNA were prepared from different tissues and human cell lines using the guanidinium thiocyanate-cesium chloride procedure(15.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1989Google Scholar), denatured by glyoxal and fractionated by electrophoresis on a 1% agarose gel in 10 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.0. DNA samples, prepared from the λCharon 4a clones, were digested with restriction enzymes. Northern and Southern blots were prepared (15.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1989Google Scholar) and baked for 90 min at 80°C. Membranes were prehybridized for at least 4 h and hybridized overnight with the same probe as for the screening, at 42°C in a solution containing 50% formamide for Northern blots and 40% formamide for Southern blots. Filters were washed twice for 15 min in 2 × SSC at room temperature and then twice for 30 min in 0.2 × SSC at 60°C before being exposed at −70°C in the presence of intensifying screens for 5 days (Northern blots) or 1 h (Southern blots). In order to isolate new subtypes of P2 receptors, sets of degenerate oligonucleotides primers were synthesized on the basis of the best conserved segments in the published sequences of the chick brain P2Y1(5.Webb T.E.

These primers were used in low-stringency PCR on human genomic DNA as described(18.Libert F. Parmentier M. Lefort A. Dinsart C. Van Sande J. Maenhaut C. Simons M.J. Dumont J.E. Vassart G. Science. 1989; 244: 569-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar). Some combinations generated discrete bands with a size compatible with that expected for P2 receptors. For example, the primer [5'-CAGATCTAGATA(CT)ATGTT(CT)(AC)A(CT)(CT)T(ACGT)GC-3'] corresponding to the second transmembrane region and the primer [5'-TCTTAAGCTTGG(AG)TC(ACGT)A(CG)(AG)CA(AG)CT(AG)TT-3'] corresponding to the seventh transmembrane region amplified a 712-bp fragment. The partial sequences obtained after sequencing were translated into peptidic sequences and compared to a local databank which contains G protein-coupled receptor sequences. Most of the clones resulting from these PCR products encoded a part of a new receptor which displayed 58% identity with the murine P2Y2 receptor and 42% identity with the chick P2Y1 receptor partial sequences. In addition, some clones encoded a peptidic sequence presenting 87% identity with the chick P2Y1 receptor and are therefore believed to represent fragments of the human P2Y1 gene (data not shown). The partial sequence of the new receptor was used as a probe to screen a human genomic DNA library. Several clones that strongly hybridized with the probe at high stringency conditions were obtained and purified. The inserts of the clones varied from 12 to 17 kb, and restriction analysis revealed that all clones belonged to a single locus. The full sequence of a 1.4-kb NheI-EcoRV fragment was obtained, and an intronless open reading frame of 1095 bp was identified (Fig. 1). The predicted molecular mass of the encoded protein is 36.5 kDa. This molecular mass is unlikely to be modified in vivo, since no N-glycosylation consensus sequences are found in the putative exofacial regions. In contrast with the human P2Y2 receptor, there is no RGD motif, an integrin binding consensus sequence, in the putative first extracellular loop. Some potential sites of phosphorylation by protein kinase C or by calmodulin-dependent protein kinases were identified in the third intracellular loop and in the carboxyl-terminal part of the receptor (Fig. 1). The four positively charged amino acids which have been reported to play a role in the P2Y2 receptor activation by ATP and UTP (1.Erb L. Garrad R. Wang Y. Quinn T. Turner J.T. Weisman G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4185-4188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) are conserved in the P2Y4 sequence: His262, Arg265, Lys289, and Arg292 (Fig. 1). The P2Y4 amino acid sequence was compared to the chick P2Y1 and the murine P2Y2 amino acid sequences and to their closest neighbors in the G protein-coupled receptor family (Fig. 2). It is clear that, from a structural point of view, the newly cloned receptor is more closely related to the human P2Y2 receptor (51% of identity between the complete sequences) than to the chick P2Y1 receptor (35%).Figure 2:Dendrogram representing structural relatedness among the cloned P2Y receptors and their closest neighbors in the G protein-coupled receptor family.

A number of rat tissues (heart, brain, liver, testis, and kidney) were tested using a human probe at low stringency, but no hybridization signal could be obtained. No P2Y4 transcript could be detected in the following human cell lines: K562 leukemia cells (Fig. 3) and HL-60 leukemia cells and SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells (data not shown). On the contrary, a strong signal, corresponding to a 1.8-kb mRNA, was found in human placenta (Fig. 3). After transfection of the pcDNA3-P2Y4 construction in 1321N1 cells, the pool of G418-resistant clones was tested for their functional response (IP3 accumulation) to ATP and UTP. Both nucleotides were found to be agonists of the P2Y4 receptor, but the response to UTP was more robust; as previously reported(6.Filtz T.M. Li Q. Boyer J.L. Nicholas R.A. Harden T.K. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 46: 8-14PubMed Google Scholar, 12.Parr C.E. Sullivan D.M. Paradiso A.M. Lazarowski E.R. Burch L.H. Olsen J.C. Erb L. Weisman G.A. Boucher R.C. Turner J.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3275-3279Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar), none of the tested nucleotides (UTP, UDP, ATP, 2-methylthio-ATP, and ADP) produced a detectable effect in cells transfected with the pcDNA3 vector, whereas carbachol elicited strong responses (data not shown). About 20 transfected clones were then isolated and tested for their response to UTP. The clone presenting the highest IP stimulation factor in response to UTP was selected and used in all subsequent experiments (13 experiments in all). UTP and UDP produced the same maximal effect, with a similar potency (EC50 around 2 μM) (Fig. 4). ATP had a lower potency (EC50 around 20 μM), and its maximal effect was only 35% of that of UTP and UDP (mean of four independent experiments). The effect of ADP was barely detectable (Fig. 4), and 2-methylthio-ATP was completely inactive (data not shown). We describe here the cloning of a human gene encoding a novel member of the P2 purinergic receptor family. This receptor was provisionally named P2Y4: this assignment is tentative since we are aware of other recently cloned subtypes might qualify for number 4. No N-glycosylation consensus sequence can be detected in the putative exofacial regions. This situation is rare in G protein-coupled receptors but not unique: it has also been reported for the rat α2B-adrenergic receptor(19.Zeng D. Harrison J.K. D'Angelo D.D. Barber C.M. Tucker A.L. Lu Z. Lynch K.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 3102-3106Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), a human receptor for the LD78 chemokine (20.Nomura H. Nielsen B.W. Matsushima K. Int. Immunol. 1993; 5: 1239-1249Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) and the rat RBS11 orphan receptor(21.Harrison J.K. Barber C.M. Lynch K.R. Neurosci. Lett. 1994; 169: 85-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Despite its structural relatedness to the human P2Y2 receptor, the newly cloned receptor exhibits one conspicuous difference in the putative first extracellular loop: the RGD motif, an integrin binding consensus sequence, present in the P2Y2 receptor is not conserved, although clusters of four amino acids are perfectly conserved on both sides. Site-directed mutagenesis studies have demonstrated the crucial influence of charged amino acids in transmembrane helices 6 and 7 of the P2Y2 receptor on agonist potency and specificity(1.Erb L. Garrad R. Wang Y. Quinn T. Turner J.T. Weisman G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4185-4188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). His262, Arg265, and Arg292 seem to be directly involved in the binding of the negatively charged phosphate groups, whereas a mutation of Lys289 into Arg decreases the affinity for ATP/UTP and increases that for ADP/UDP. These four residues are conserved in the P2Y4 subtype, whereas Arg265 and Lys289 are replaced respectively by Lys and Gln in the P2Y1 receptor(5.Webb T.E. Simon J. Krishek B.J. Bateson A.N. Smart T.G. King B.F. Burnstock G. Barnard E.A. FEBS Lett. 1993; 324: 219-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). The P2Y4 receptor sequence presents also a series of 10 amino acids (LFLTCISVHR) which is a consensus sequence between all the P2Y receptors cloned until now. Potential sites of phosphorylation by protein kinase C or by calmodulin-dependent protein kinases were identified in the third intracellular loop and in the carboxyl-terminal part of the receptor. These regions are also particularly rich in serine and threonine residues that could be targets for the family of G protein-coupled receptor kinases. A strong signal corresponding to a 1.8-kb mRNA was detected in human placenta. No other human organ has been tested so far. Various rat tissues tested at low stringency and several human cell lines were negative. This suggests a rather restricted expression of the P2Y4 receptor. In the late eighties, it became apparent that extracellular uridine nucleotides exert effects on many tissues and cells. It was then proposed that these actions are mediated by pyrimidinoceptors distinct from the purinoceptors involved in the response to adenine nucleotides (22.Seifert R. Schultz G. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1989; 10: 365-369Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The existence of nucleotide receptors common to ATP and UTP constituted an alternative possibility, in favor of which experimental evidence started to accumulate, for instance the lack of additivity and cross-desensitization of the responses to the two nucleotides(23.Brown H.A. Lazarowski E.R. Boucher R.C. Harden T.K. Mol. Pharmacol. 1991; 40: 648-655PubMed Google Scholar, 24.O'Connor S.E. Dainty I.A. Leff P. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1991; 12: 137-141Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). The final demonstration of this concept was provided by the cloning and functional expression of the P2U/P2Y2 receptor at which ATP and UTP are equally active and equipotent(9.Lustig K.D. Shiau A.K. Brake A.J. Julius D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5113-5117Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar, 10.Erb L. Lustig K.D. Sullivan D.M. Turner J.T. Weisman G.A. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Turner J.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3275-3279Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). However the pyrimidinoceptor hypothesis re-emerged with the observation that UTP and UDP stimulate inositol phosphates formation in C6-2B rat glioma cells, whereas ATP and ADP are totally inactive(25.Lazarowski E.R. Harden T.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11830-11836Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the C6 glioma cells, from which the C6-2B subclone was isolated, express a typical P2U response: a mutation of that receptor, with selective loss of the adenine nucleotides responsiveness, might thus explain the peculiar behavior of C6-2B cells. Our results conclusively demonstrate the existence of a human gene encoding a receptor with a preference for pyrimidine over purine nucleotides. Indeed, at the P2Y4 receptor, UTP and UDP were full agonists, whereas ATP behaved as a partial agonist with a lower affinity than UTP and ADP was barely active. However, on the basis of its structure, this receptor clearly belongs to the P2Y family, which thus encompasses selective purinoceptors (P2Y1), nucleotide receptors responsive to both adenine and uridine nucleotides (P2Y2), and pyrimidinoceptors (P2Y4). We are grateful to Dr. J. P. Perkins and Dr. M. Toews for the generous gift of 1321N1 cells. We thank Dr. J. E. Dumont and Dr. G. Vassart for helpful advice and discussions."

https://openalex.org/W2041578282,"Protein-tyrosine kinases (PTKs) of the JAK family have been characterized on the basis of their ability to mediate the rapid induction of transcription of interferon-responsive genes through the stimulation of a class of latent cytoplasmic transcription factors known as signal transducers and activators of transcription (STATs).

The retroviral vector pLXSN was provided by A. D. Miller (The Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA). Human astrocytoma(1321N1) cells were obtained from M. L. Toews (University of Nebraska, Omaha, NE), and a clonal line that exhibited no nucleotide receptor activity was selected. PA317 cells (CRL9078) were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD). G418 (Geneticin) and the BioNick labeling kit were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. All other chemicals were purchased from Sigma. Human genomic DNA was amplified by PCR using degenerate oligonucleotides based on the sequences encoding transmembrane domains 3 (P1, 5′-GT(G/C)ATGAG(T/C)G(T/C)(G/A/C)GACCG(C/A)TA) and 7 (P2, 5′-GGGGTT(G/C)AGGCA(G/C)(G/C)(T/A)GTT) that are conserved between the opioid- and somatostatin-like GPCRs 7 and 8(3.O'Dowd B.F.

The PCR conditions were as follows: denaturation at 94°C for 3 min, annealing at 42°C for 2 min, and extension at 72°C for 3 min, for 30 cycles, followed by a 7-min extension at 72°C(4.Marchese A.

The resultant amplified DNA was extracted with phenol/chloroform, precipitated with ethanol, and electrophoresed on a low melting point agarose gel. A band in the 500-base pair range was excised, ligated into the EcoRV site of pBluescript SK(-) (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), and sequenced as described previously(4.Marchese A. Docherty J.M. Nguyen T.

A clone that shared identity with several GPCRs was isolated, labeled with [32P]dCTP, and used to screen a human λEMBL3 SP6/T7 genomic library (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). A positive clone (clone 49) was isolated, and DNA was prepared from the purified plaque, restriction enzyme-digested, electrophoresed on an agarose gel, transferred to nylon membrane, and probed with the PCR product as described previously(4.Marchese A. Docherty J.M. Nguyen T. Heiber M. Cheng R. Heng H.H.Q. Tsui L.-C. Shi X. George S.R. O'Dowd B.F. Genomics. 1994; 23: 609-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Clone 49 was inserted between the EcoRI and XhoI sites of the retroviral expression plasmid, pLXSN. The recombinant plasmid, pLXSNc49, was then transfected into PA317 amphotrophic packaging cells for production of the viral vector, LXSNc49, as described previously (5.Miller A.D. Rosman G.J. BioTechniques. 1989; 7: 980-990PubMed Google Scholar). Human 1321N1 astrocytoma cells were infected with LXSNc49 or LXSN control vector (for 24 h with 4 μg/ml Polybrene) and selected for neomycin resistance with 1.5 mg/ml G418. To assay for receptor activity, nucleotide-stimulated changes in the concentration of intracellular free calcium ([Ca2+]i) were measured by dual excitation spectrofluorometric analysis of cell suspensions loaded with fura-2 as described previously(6.Erb L.

The calcium mobilization experiments shown were performed in HEPES-buffered saline (pH 7.4) containing 1 mM CaCl2, 1 mM MgCl2, and 1 mM glucose. Changes in intracellular total inositol phosphates (7.Yu H. Turner J.T. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1991; 259: 1344-1350PubMed Google Scholar) and in cyclic AMP production (8.Turner J.T. Jones S.B. Bylund D.B. Peptides. 1986; 7: 849-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) were determined by methods described previously. Lymphocytes isolated from human cord blood were cultured in α-minimum essential medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum and phytohemagglutinin at 37°C for 68-72 h. The lymphocyte cultures were treated with 0.18 mg/ml bromodeoxyuridine to synchronize the cell population. The synchronized cells were washed three times with serum-free medium to release them from Go and recultured at 37°C for 6 h in α-minimum essential medium containing 2.5 μg/ml thymidine. Cells were harvested, and metaphase spread chromosome slides were made by using standard procedures including hypotonic treatment, fixation, and air drying. The clone 49 phage was biotinylated with dATP using the BRL BioNick labeling kit (15°C, 2 h) and used for fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) detection as described previously (9.Heng H.H.Q.

Chromosome. 1993; 102: 325-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). Briefly, slides were baked at 55°C for 1 h. After RNase A treatment, the samples were denatured in 70% (v/v) formamide in 2 × standard saline citrate for 2 min at 70°C, followed by dehydration with ethanol. Probes were denatured at 75°C for 5 min in a hybridization mix consisting of 50% (v/v) formamide, 10% (w/v) dextran sulfate, and human Cot I DNA (Life Technologies, Inc.) and prehybridized for 15 min at 37°C to block repetitive sequences. Probes were loaded on the denatured chromosome slides. After overnight hybridization, slides were washed, and the FISH signal was amplified and detected as described previously(10.Heng H.H.Q. Tsui L.-C. Choo K.H.A. Methods in Molecular Biology: In Situ Hybridization Protocols. Humana Press Inc., Clifton, NJ1994Google Scholar). FISH signals and the DAPI banding pattern were recorded separately by taking photographs, and the assignment of the FISH mapping data with chromosomal bands was achieved by superimposing FISH signals with DAPI-stained chromosomes(11.Heng H.H.Q. Tsui L.-C. Chromosome. 1993; 102: 325-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). Genes encoding novel GPCRs were detected by PCR amplification of human genomic DNA using degenerate oligonucleotides based on the sequences encoding transmembrane spanning domains 3 and 7 of the opioid receptors, somatostatin receptors, and the related GPCRs 7 and 8. A DNA fragment was isolated and used to screen a human genomic library to obtain a full-length clone. A single phage clone (clone 49) was isolated and, following restriction enzyme digestion and Southern analyses, a 2.5-kilobase pair SacI fragment was isolated, subcloned into pBluescript, and sequenced. This genomic clone contained an intronless open reading frame of 1095 base pairs encoding a protein of 365 amino acids with features characteristic of GPCRs. The encoded protein has the greatest overall identity with the human P2U2U purinoceptor (54%), the rat P2Y purinoceptor (33%), and the human delta opioid receptor (25%). The greatest degree of amino acid identity occurred within the putative seven-transmembrane domains where it demonstrated 74% identity with the P2U receptor, 48% with the P2Y receptor, and 35% with the human delta opioid receptor. The alignment of the protein encoded by clone 49 with these various receptors is shown in Fig. 1. The predicted amino acid sequence of the protein encoded by clone 49 suggests no amino-terminal glycosylation sites, a single consensus site for protein kinase A phosphorylation between TMDs 5 and 6, and a cysteine residue required for post-translational modification by palmitoylation in the carboxyl-terminal tail. To determine whether or not phage clone 49 encodes a functional nucleotide receptor, the DNA was inserted into the retroviral vector, pLXSN, and the construct was stably expressed in 1321N1 cells. Application of extracellular UTP to these cells caused a rapid increase in [Ca2+]i, followed by a gradual decline to slightly above the prestimulation level when the cells were incubated in Ca2+-containing medium (Fig. 2A). In Ca2+-depleted medium, UTP caused a rapid increase in [Ca2+]i that was of the same magnitude as the response in Ca2+-containing medium but which returned quickly to the prestimulation level. As also shown in Fig. 2A, extracellular ATP did not increase [Ca2+]i. Concentration-response curves indicated that UTP was approximately 100-fold more potent than UDP and the UTP analog 5-Br-UTP (Fig. 2B). ITP and dTTP, at concentrations ≥100 μM, caused modest increases in [Ca2+]i (Fig. 2B), whereas other nucleotides and nucleosides, including GTP, CTP, ADP, UMP, and uridine, had no effect. This agonist specificity profile is distinctly different from that of any reported P2 purinoceptor and indicates that clone 49 encodes a uridine nucleotide receptor (UNR). It is also important to note that the pharmacological profile of the expressed clone 49 receptor (Fig. 2B) is different from that reported for the uridine nucleotide-selective receptor identified in functional studies in rat C6-2B cells(12.Lazarowski E.R. Harden T.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11830-11836Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which exhibits a rank order potency of UDP > 5-Br-UTP > UTP. Whether this difference is indicative of species variations in agonist responsiveness or the existence of multiple UNR subtypes awaits further investigation. The inability of ATP to increase [Ca2+]i in 1321N1 cells expressing the UNR raised the question of whether ATP might act as an antagonist, similar to its effect on ADP activation of platelets(13.Gachet C. Cazenave J.P. Nouv. Rev. Fr. Hematol. 1991; 33: 347-358PubMed Google Scholar). We found that a 10-fold or greater molar excess of ATP inhibited the increase in [Ca2+]i induced by UTP. In a representative experiment, the increase in [Ca2+]i obtained with 0.5 μM UTP was reduced by about 75% in the presence of 100 μM ATP. However, this effect was not unique for ATP since high concentrations of GTP and CTP also inhibited UTP-induced increases in [Ca2+]i. We are currently investigating the nature of this inhibitory effect. The mobilization of intracellular Ca2+ mediated by the UNR is accompanied by an increase in the hydrolysis of polyphosphoinositides. In a representative experiment, UTP (1 μM) increased the level of total [3H]inositol phosphates from a basal value of 2880 to 3807 cpm, whereas the value with 100 μM ATP was 2923 cpm. In addition, inclusion of 100 μM ATP inhibited the response to 1 μM UTP by about 80% (3083 cpm), consistent with the ability of ATP to block UTP-stimulated Ca2+ mobilization. The UNR does not appear to be coupled to adenylyl cyclase, since application of UTP to UNR-expressing cells did not cause an increase in cyclic AMP levels nor did UTP inhibit forskolin-stimulated cyclic AMP production (data not shown). FISH analysis of metaphase spread chromosomes was used to identify the chromosomal location of clone 49. Under the conditions used, the hybridization efficiency of probe phage clone 49 was approximately 100%; of 100 mitotic figures checked, 99 showed signals on one pair of the chromosomes. By examining the DAPI banding pattern, the signal from probe phage clone 49 was assigned to the long arm of chromosome X. A more precise localization was obtained based on the summary from 10 photos of mitotic chromosomes probed with phage clone 49. Typical photographs of FISH and DAPI banding are shown in Fig. 3, A and B, respectively. An example of the mapping results is presented in Fig. 3C. These results indicate that the UNR gene is located on chromosome X in region q13. The human UNR was aligned with the nine reported P2 purinoceptor amino acid sequences, and a dendrogram was prepared with a phylogenetic tree-generating program (14.Gonnet G.H. Suhai S. Computational Methods in Genome Research. Plenum Press, New York1994: 153-162Crossref Google Scholar). The dendrogram (Fig. 4) confirms that the UNR is more related, in terms of primary structure, to the P2U purinoceptor than it is to the P2Y purinoceptor. In addition, the uridine nucleotide and P2U receptors are more closely related than are the P2U and P2Y receptors. This suggests a common ancestor from which two receptor types arose, those using ATP as an agonist and those using both ATP and UTP, or UTP alone, as their agonist(s). Thus, nucleotide receptors may be a more suitable name for the family of receptors to which the UNR and the G protein-coupled P2 purinoceptors belong. We thank Jean M. Camden, Victor R. Saldivia, and Yang Shen for their expert technical assistance."
https://openalex.org/W2089880838,"The B cell surface antigen receptor, surface IgM (sIgM), is involved in B cell activation and proliferation. CD40 is involved in regulating IgE production and B cell survival. Cross-linking of B cell sIgM activates the Ras/Raf/p42erk2pathway. In contrast, ligation of CD40 by antibody or soluble gp39 (CD40 ligand) leads to activation of the c-Jun kinase (JNK)/stress-activated protein kinase pathway. JNK/stress-activated protein kinase activation correlated with the stimulation of MEK kinase activity. CD40 does not activate the p42erk2 pathway, and sIgM fails to regulate the JNK/stress-activated protein kinase pathway in B cells. Thus, two important cell surface receptors involved in controlling specific B cell response differentially regulate sequential protein kinase pathways involving different members of the mitogen-activated protein kinase family. Anti-CD40 also rescued B cell apoptosis induced by anti-IgM. CD40 ligation did not affect the sIgM stimulation of p42erk2 activity. Conversely, sIgM ligation did not influence CD40 stimulation of JNK/stress-activated protein kinase. These results suggest that independent, parallel protein kinase response pathways are involved in the integration of sIgM and CD40 control of B cell phenotype and function. The B cell surface antigen receptor, surface IgM (sIgM), is involved in B cell activation and proliferation. CD40 is involved in regulating IgE production and B cell survival. Cross-linking of B cell sIgM activates the Ras/Raf/p42erk2pathway. In contrast, ligation of CD40 by antibody or soluble gp39 (CD40 ligand) leads to activation of the c-Jun kinase (JNK)/stress-activated protein kinase pathway. JNK/stress-activated protein kinase activation correlated with the stimulation of MEK kinase activity. CD40 does not activate the p42erk2 pathway, and sIgM fails to regulate the JNK/stress-activated protein kinase pathway in B cells. Thus, two important cell surface receptors involved in controlling specific B cell response differentially regulate sequential protein kinase pathways involving different members of the mitogen-activated protein kinase family. Anti-CD40 also rescued B cell apoptosis induced by anti-IgM. CD40 ligation did not affect the sIgM stimulation of p42erk2 activity.

https://openalex.org/W1594600122,"It has been proposed that modern humans descended from a single woman, the ""mitochondrial Eve"" who lived in Africa 100,000 to 200,000 years ago. The human immune system DRB1 genes are extremely polymorphic, with gene lineages that coalesce into an ancestor who lived around 60 million years ago, a time before the divergence of the apes from the Old World monkeys. The theory of gene coalescence suggests that, throughout the last 60 million years, human ancestral populations had an effective size of 100,000 individuals or greater. Molecular evolution data favor the African origin of modern humans, but the weight of the evidence is against a population bottleneck before their emergence. The mitochondrial Eve hypothesis emanates from a confusion between gene genealogies and individual genealogies."

Oncogenic, activated forms of Ras proteins are associated with a broad range of human cancers. The elucidation of the post-translational modifications that occur at the carboxyl terminus of Ras and the demonstration that farnesylation of Ras by farnesyl protein transferase is essential for Ras-induced cellular transformation has opened up a new and promising approach to the development of anti-Ras therapeutics. We report here a novel series of potent farnesyl protein transferase (FPT) inhibitors, represented by SCH 44342. This compound inhibits both rat brain and recombinant human FPT with an IC50 of approximately 250 nM, while it is only weakly active against rat brain geranylgeranyl protein transferase-1 (IC50 > 114 μM). FPT inhibition has been observed using both Ha-Ras protein and Ki-Ras-derived peptide substrates in two different assay formats. SCH 44342 and its analogs also inhibit farnesylation of Ras in Cos cells transiently expressing [Val12]Ha-Ras with IC50 values in the low micromolar range. At these concentrations they do not inhibit sterol biosynthesis or geranylgeranylation of protein. In addition, we observed that Cos cells undergo pronounced morphological changes upon overexpression of [Val12]activated forms of Ha-Ras containing COOH-terminal sequences allowing farnesylation (CVLS) or geranylgeranylation (CVLL) but not upon overexpression of activated Ras lacking the isoprenylated Cys (SVLS). Ras-induced morphological changes can be partially reverted with lovastatin. Importantly, SCH 44342 can block morphological changes induced by [Val12]Ha-Ras-CVLS but not [Val12]Ha-Ras-CVLL. Recently, a number of other FPT inhibitors have been reported. Most of the compounds reported to have cell-based activity are peptidomimetic analogs of the CAAX substrate. Our FPT inhibitors are novel in that although they compete with Ras protein in kinetic experiments they are entirely nonpeptidic in nature, they do not have oxidizable sulfhydryl functions, and they are active in cells at low micromolar concentrations.

The primary determinant for recognition of protein substrates by the isoprenyl transferases is the substrate's carboxyl-terminal amino acid sequence.

We report here the discovery of a novel series of nonpeptide tricyclic FPT inhibitors active at submicromolar concentrations. SCH 44342 (Fig. 1) is a representative compound in this series. Although it is entirely nonpeptidic in nature and lacks a sulfhydryl function, SCH 44342 appears to compete with the Ras-CAAX substrate for binding to FPT. The biochemical characterization of these inhibitors and their effects on Cos cells transiently overexpressing activated Ha-Ras are described. Additional cell-based biological evaluation of these compounds will be published separately. 2P. Kirschmeier, L. Armstrong, L. James, D. Carr, F. Zhang, R. Doll, G. Njoroge, M. Sinensky, M. Dalton, and W. R. Bishop, manuscript in preparation. These compounds are novel inhibitors of Ras farnesylation, which, due to their potent activity in cell-based assays, should serve as useful tools in understanding Ras signal transduction pathways. Amino acids 186-189 (Cys-Val-Leu-Ser (CVLS)) of Ha-Ras serve as a recognition motif for FPT. A mutant form of Ras, which is a substrate for GGPT I, was constructed using site-directed mutagenesis, by converting Ser189 to Leu (Ras-CVLL). A second mutant form was constructed in which Cys186 is changed to Ser (Ras-SVLS); this protein is not isoprenylated. Coding sequences for full-length Ha-Ras were subcloned into the BamHI site of the pSelect vector (ProMega) and grown in Escherichia coli JM109. In all cases the Ras sequences contained an activating Gly12→Val mutation. Single-stranded DNA was isolated from cells after superinfection with the helper phage, R408. The single-stranded DNA contained the anticoding strand for Ras. Two mutagenic oligonucleotides designed to introduce the Ser189→Leu (AAGTGTGTGCTCCTGTGAGGATCCTC) and Cys186→Ser mutations (ATGAGCTGCAAGTCCGTGCTCTCCTAG) were synthesized and mutagenesis was done according to the manufacturer's (Promega) instructions. Mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. cDNAs encoding [Val12]Ha-Ras-CVLS and [Val12]Ha-Ras-CVLL were subcloned into the E. coli expression vector QE-9 (Qiagen) at a BamHI site. These constructs encode an additional 11 amino acids at their NH2 terminus, including a stretch of 6 consecutive histidines (His6-Ha-Ras-CVLS and His6-Ha-Ras-CVLL). Orientation and reading frame were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Vectors were introduced into the SURE strain of E. coli (Stratagene), and cultures were grown overnight in LB broth. Isopropyl-1-thio-βD-galactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 1 mM for 1 h prior to harvesting cells by centrifugation. Cells were resuspended in 200 ml of Buffer A (60 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mM MgCl2+, and 10 mM β-mercaptoethanol) and the protease inhibitors PMSF, leupeptin, and benzamidine were added at 0.2 mM, 100 μg/ml, and 10 mM respectively. The suspension was passed through a Microfluidizer (model 110S) at 18,500 p.s.i. to break the cells, and the insoluble debris was removed by centrifugation at 15,000 rpm in an SS-34 rotor (Sorvall) for 20 min at 4°C. The cleared lysate was passed over a Ni2+ chelate affinity resin. The column was washed with Buffer A and then with Buffer A containing 1 M NaCl until the A280 was < 0.1 OD units followed by another wash with 5 column volumes of Buffer A. Ras proteins were eluted with Buffer A containing 250 mM imidazole. Fractions containing the eluted protein were passed over PD10 gel filtration columns (Bio-Rad) in Buffer A to remove the imidazole. The final yield of protein is approximately 20 mg of Ras/liter of culture. cDNA clones for human FPT α and β subunits were obtained from the ATCC (ATCC 63225 and 63226, respectively). The 5′ end of the β clone was completed by ligating DNA into the BbsI site following its amplification by polymerase chain reaction from human brain cortex cDNA (Quick-Clone from Clontech). The FPT α cDNA was cut out with BamHI and PpuMI and ligated into p2-BAC (Invitrogen) cut with BamHI and NcoI to produce pA2BN. The completed β cDNA was cut out with NotI and ApaI and ligated into pA2BN (cut with the same enzymes) to produce pABC-2B. This construct was used to produce recombinant baculovirus according to Summers et al.(31.Summers M.D. Smith G.E. Tex. Agric. Exp. Stn. Bull. 1987; 1555Google Scholar). For FPT production, log phase Sf9 cells (2 × 106/ml) were infected at a multiplicity of infection of 1.5 in a 10-liter Biolafitte tank and cultured for 3 days at 28°C and 140 rpm in SF900-II medium (Life Technologies, Inc.). Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 10 min at 4°C. For E. coli expression, the FPT α and β coding sequences were expressed co-cistronically from the trc promoter of the pTrcHisA vector (Invitrogen) lacking the His6 tag. The α sequence was ligated between the NcoI and BglII sites of pTrcHisA to produce pTrcFTA. After the addition of a ribosome binding site immediately upstream of the FPT β initiator ATG, this sequence was ligated between the EcoRI and HindIII sites of pTrcFTA to produce pTrcFTAB. Topp 1 E. coli cells (Stratagene) were transformed with pTrcFTAB and grown at 30°C in M9 medium + 0.16% yeast extract. When the cells reached an OD600 of 0.5, FPT expression was induced by the addition of 0.1 mM isopropyl-1-thio-βD-galactopyranoside. After 4 h the cells were harvested, resuspended in 1/100 volumes of homogenization buffer and lysed in a Microfluidizer at 18,500 p.s.i. Insoluble debris was removed by centrifugation at 12,000 × g. The α and β subunits were also expressed in E. coli DH5a cells (Life Technologies, Inc.) from separate plasmids. A truncated form of the FPT α subunit (Δ 2-41) was produced by deleting the region between the EagI and NcoI sites in pTrcFTAB. The EagI overhang was degraded with mung bean nuclease and the NcoI overhang was filled in with the Klenow fragment of E. coli DNA polymerase I and the two blunt ends were ligated to produce pTRAB. For initial studies, both FPT and GGPT-1 were partially purified from rat brain by ammonium sulfate fractionation followed by Q-Sepharose anion exchange chromatography essentially as described(16.Yokoyama K. Gelb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4055-4060Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Soluble Sf9-derived human FPT was extracted at 4°C from a 300-g cell pellet by homogenization in 1200 ml of 50 mM Tris pH 7.5, 2 mM dithiothreitol (DTT), 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, 0.1 mM leupeptin, and 0.2 mM PMSF followed by cell lysis using a Microfluidizer at 18,500 p.s.i. Insoluble debris was removed by centrifugation for 1 h at 4°C and the supernatant (8.3 g total protein) was loaded onto a 1-liter QAE-Sepharose Fast Flow column (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) equilibrated in 20 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 0.1 M NaCl, 20 μM ZnCl2, 2 mM DTT (Buffer A). The column was washed with 10 bed volumes of Buffer A, and FPT was eluted (1.1 g total protein) with a linear gradient of 0.1-0.6 M NaCl in Buffer A. An additional chromatography step using a smaller (180 ml) QAE-Sepharose column and a 0.15-0.5 M NaCl gradient in Buffer A provided further purification and excellent recovery. Fractions containing FPT activity (370 mg of total protein) were adjusted to 0.75 M NaCl and loaded onto a phenyl-Sepharose column in the absence of ZnCl2. Elution was performed with a linear gradient from 0.75 M to 0 M NaCl in 5 mM Tris, pH 7.1, 1 mM DTT. At this step, peak FPT fractions (50 mg of total protein) were greater than 90% pure and could be further enriched by size exclusion chromatography. NH2-terminal amino acid sequencing of the α subunit identified the expected sequence (Ala-Ala-Thr-Glu-Gly) lacking the initiator methionine. The NH2 terminus of the β subunit appeared to be blocked, since no sequence could be obtained. Protein concentrations of purified FPT were obtained by amino acid analysis. A much lower expression of soluble human FPT was obtained in E. coli. Purification from this system using the same method described above resulted in a partially (≈50%) purified sample. FPT activity was determined by measuring transfer of [3H]farnesyl from [3H]farnesyl pyrophosphate to trichloroacetic acid-precipitable His6-Ha-Ras-CVLS similar to the method described by Reiss et al.(9.Reiss Y. Goldstein J.L. Seabra M.C. Casey P.J. Brown M.S. Cell. 1990; 62: 81-88Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar). Typical reaction mixtures (100 μl total) contained 40 mM Hepes, pH 7.5, 20 mM MgCl2, 5 mM DTT, 90-250 nM [3H]farnesyl pyrophosphate (DuPont NEN; 20 Ci/mmol), 25-50 ng (approximately 2.5-5 nM) of purified enzyme or 10 μl of partially purified Q-Sepharose-derived FPT, the indicated concentration of SCH 44342 or dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) vehicle control (5%, v/v, final), and 5 μg (approximately 2.5 μM) Ha-Ras-CVLS. After a 30-min incubation at room temperature reactions were stopped with 0.5 ml of 4% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) followed by 0.5 ml of cold 30% trichloroacetic acid. Samples were allowed to sit on ice for 45 min, and precipitated protein was collected on GF/C filter paper mats using a Brandel cell harvester. Filter mats were washed once with 6% trichloroacetic acid, 2% SDS and radioactivity was measured in a Wallac 1204 Betaplate BS liquid scintillation counter. Percent inhibition was calculated relative to the Me2SO vehicle control. Alternatively, FPT assays were done using a scintillation proximity assay kit following the protocol described by the manufacturer (Amersham Corp.) except that a biotinylated substrate peptide containing the Ki-Ras carboxyl-terminal sequence was used. The Ki-Ras peptide (Analytical Biotechnology Services, Boston, MA) has the sequence biotin-KKSKTKCVIM and was typically used at 50-100 nM. Farnesyl pyrophosphate was typically present at 90-100 nM. Other reaction conditions were as described above for the trichloroacetic acid precipitation assay. Kinetic parameters were determined by nonlinear regression analysis using the program k.Cat (BioMetallics, Inc.). The GGPT-1 assay was essentially identical to the trichloroacetic acid precipitation assay for FPT described above, with two exceptions; [3H]geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (220-250 nM) replaced farnesyl pyrophosphate as the isoprenoid donor, and Ha-Ras-CVLL (3.6 μg/100 μl reaction) was the protein acceptor, similar to the method reported by Casey et al.(32.Casey P.J. Thissen J.A. Moomaw J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 8631-8635Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). cDNAs encoding Ras with the three carboxyl-terminal sequences (-CVLS, -CVLL, and -SVLS) were subcloned into the mammalian expression vector pSV-Sport (Life Technologies, Inc.), which contains both the SV40 promoter sequences and the SV40 origin of replication. Cos-7 monkey kidney cells were transfected by electroporation with 23 μg of the various plasmids. Following electroporation, cells were plated into six-well tissue culture dishes containing 1.5 ml of Dulbecco's-modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and the appropriate FPT inhibitors. After 24 h, medium was removed and fresh medium containing the appropriate drugs was re-added. 48 h after electroporation, cells were examined microscopically to monitor morphological changes and photographed. Cells were then washed twice with 1 ml of cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and scraped from the dish into 1 ml of buffer containing 25 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM PMSF, 50 μM leupeptin, and 0.1 μM pepstatin. Cells were lysed by homogenization, and debris was removed by centrifugation at 2000 × g for 10 min. Protein was precipitated from lysates by addition of ice-cold trichloroacetic acid and redissolved in 100 μl of SDS-electrophoresis sample buffer. Samples (5-10 μl) were loaded onto 14% polyacrylamide gels (Novex, Inc.) and electrophoresed until the tracking dye neared the bottom of the gel. Resolved proteins were electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were blocked by incubation overnight at 4°C in PBS containing 2.5% dried milk and 0.5% Tween 20 and then incubated with a Ras-specific monoclonal antibody (Y13-259) in PBS containing 1% fetal calf serum for 1 h at room temperature. After washing, membranes were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with a 1:5000 dilution of rabbit anti-rat IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase in PBS containing 1% fetal calf serum. Ras proteins were visualized using a colorimetric peroxidase reagent (4-chloro-1-naphthol; Bio-Rad). In some experiments Cos cells were labeled with [35S]methionine by washing twice with methionine-free DMEM followed by growth for 1 h in this medium containing 5% dialyzed fetal bovine serum to deplete endogenous methionine. Subsequently, cells were labeled in this medium (in the presence or absence of FPT inhibitor) containing 100 μCi/ml [35S]methionine (1000 Ci/mmol, Amersham) for 24 h. Chase experiments were performed for various times in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 5 mM unlabeled methionine. Cells were lysed by sonication in 400 μl of 100 mM Tris, pH 8.3, 0.5% SDS, 2 mM EDTA, 100 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mM PMSF. Deoxycholate and Nonidet P-40 were added to a final concentration of 0.5%, and aprotinin was added to 1 mg/ml final. Lysates were incubated with 50 μl (50 μg) of Y13-259 agarose (Oncogene Science) for 18 h at 4°C. The pelleted agarose beads were washed four times with buffer (1 ml each), and the final pellet resuspended in 40 μl of SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis buffer. Processed and unprocessed Ras were separated as described above, and nitrocellulose membranes were exposed to x-ray film for 1-4 days prior to development. NIH 3T3 cells were plated into six-well cluster dishes in DMEM containing 10% calf serum. The following day the medium was changed to DMEM containing 0.5% calf serum, 50 μCi/ml 2-[14C]acetate (DuPont NEN, 57 mCi/mmol) and the indicated concentration of SCH 44342. After 18 h, cells were washed once with PBS, then scraped into 2 ml of cold methanol. Cells were extracted according to the method of Bligh and Dyer(33.Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (43132) Google Scholar), and a portion of the CHCl3 phase was subjected to mild alkaline deacylation in methanolic NaOH(34.Kates M. Work T.S. Work E. Laboratory Techniques in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology. Elsevier Publishing Co., New York1972: 558-559Google Scholar). The final chloroform phase was analyzed by thin layer chromatography on silica gel 60 F-254 plates developed in petroleum ether/diethyl ether/acetic acid (80:20:1). TLC plates were autoradiographed, and spots corresponding to sterol standard (RF ranged from 0.10 to 0.19) were scraped and quantified by liquid scintillation spectrometry. Previous reports have described expression of FPT in both E. coli(12.Omer C.A. Kral A.M. Diehl R.E. Prendergast G.C. Powers S. Allen C.M. Gibbs J.B. Kohl N.E.

We expressed the subunits of human FPT in E. coli both from separate plasmids and using a co-cistronic expression plasmid. In either case, the expressed FPT was highly (>95%) insoluble. We also coexpressed the β subunit with an amino-terminal truncated form of the α subunit (Δ41α). Expression of soluble FPT enzymatic activity in E. coli was 10-30-fold higher with this construct, and we estimate expression to be about 1 mg of soluble FPT/liter. Most of our work has focused on full-length human FPT expressed in Sf9 cells from the polyhedrin and P10 promoters of a dual expression transfer vector. Using this system we have achieved purification to >95% purity of 5-10 mg of FPT/liter of Sf9 cells. This is similar to the levels reported by Chen et al.(35.Chen W.-J. Moomaw J.F. Overton L. Kost T.A. Casey P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9675-9680Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Highly purified FPT from Sf9 cells typically displayed Vmax values of 132-150 nmol/h/mg in the trichloroacetic acid precipitation assay, corresponding to kcat values of 0.0038-0.0042/s. This is somewhat lower than the value reported by Omer et al.(12.Omer C.A. Kral A.M. Diehl R.E. Prendergast G.C. Powers S. Allen C.M. Gibbs J.B. Kohl N.E.

https://openalex.org/W2008983501,"The phosphorylation of cardiac muscle troponin I (CTnI) at two adjacent N-terminal serine residues by cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) has been implicated in the inotropic response of the heart to β-agonists. Phosphorylation of these residues has been shown to reduce the Ca2+ affinity of the single Ca2+-specific regulatory site of cardiac troponin C (CTnC) and to increase the rate of Ca2+ dissociation from this site (Robertson, S. P., Johnson, J. D., Holroyde, M. J., Kranias, E. G., Potter, J. D., and Solaro, R. J.(1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257, 260-263). Recent studies (Zhang, R., Zhao, J., and Potter, J. D.(1995) Circ.

The wild type and the mutated CTnIs were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified. Using these mutants, it was found that serine 23 was phosphorylated more rapidly than serine 22 and that both serines are required to be phosphorylated in order to observe the characteristic reduction in the Ca2+ sensitivity of force development seen in a skinned cardiac muscle preparation. The latter result confirms that PKA phosphorylation of CTnI, and not other proteins, is responsible for this change in Ca2+ sensitivity.

Troponin I (TnI), a subunit of the troponin complex, inhibits the actomyosin ATPase activity when muscle is in the resting state. Binding of Ca2+ to the low affinity site(s) of troponin C (TnC) releases the TnI inhibition on actomyosin ATPase through protein-protein interactions among the troponin complex, tropomyosin and actin, and leads to muscle contraction(10.Zot A.S. Potter J.D. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biophys. Chem. 1987; 16: 535-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). In comparison with skeletal TnI, CTnI has an additional 32-33 amino acids at its N terminus, and this segment also contains two adjacent serine residues at positions 22 and 23 or 23 and 24, depending on the species(11.Mittmann K.

Biochemical studies have shown that CTnI can be phosphorylated to the level of 2 mol of phosphate/mol of protein (16.Stull J.T. Manning D.R. High C.W. Blumenthal D.K. Fed.

The decreased Ca2+ sensitivity upon phosphorylation of CTnI has been observed in isolated cardiac myofibrils(8.Garvey J.L. Kranias E.G. Solaro R.J. Biochem.

Moreover, it has been shown that CTnI phosphorylation increases the rate of Ca2+ dissociation from a reconstituted troponin complex(23.Robertson S.P. Johnson J.D. Holroyde M.J. Kranias E.G. Potter J.D. Solaro R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 260-263Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting the possible importance of this phosphorylation in modulating the rate of relaxation of cardiac muscle. Some reports, however, have shown that CTnI remains phosphorylated even after removal of β-agonists and the return of muscle contraction to prestimulated basal levels(4.Talosi L. Eds I. Kranias E.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: H791-H797PubMed Google Scholar, 19.England P.J. Biochem. J. 1976; 160: 295-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). These results have suggested that phosphorylation of CTnI may not be as important as the phosphorylation of other proteins, such as phospholamban(4.Talosi L. Eds I. Kranias E.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: H791-H797PubMed Google Scholar). In a recent study we have clearly shown that CTnI phosphorylation is directly correlated with the faster muscle relaxation seen after PKA phosphorylation and is probably due to the decreased Ca2+ affinity of CTnC and the consequent faster dissociation of Ca2+(22.Zhang R. Zhao J. Potter J.D. Circ. Res. 1995; 76: 1028-1035Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Our calculations also showed that although PKA phosphorylation of phospholamban is the predominant effector in the inotropic response, the rate of relaxation is significantly influenced by CTnI phosphorylation. After many years of study there are still numerous questions regarding the mechanism of action of CTnI phosphorylation and of the physiological significance of this process. In the present study we have focussed on the role of the phosphorylation of the two CTnI serines in this process. In order to study the functional and physiological significance of phosphorylation of these two serine residues, we have used our cloned mouse CTnI cDNA to create three mutants of CTnI in which either serine 22 or 23, or both, are mutated into alanine(9.Zhang R. Zhao J. Potter J.D. Biophys. J. 1994; 66: A316Google Scholar). Our results demonstrate that both serine residues in CTnI are able to be phosphorylated by PKA in vitro but that the rates of phosphorylation for these two serine residues are different. Using a reconstituted skinned cardiac muscle preparation (CSM), we have studied the effect of phosphorylation of each serine residue on the Ca2+ dependence of force development. We show that phosphorylation of both serine residues by PKA is required for the decreased Ca2+-sensitivity of force development. Since the rate of phosphorylation is different, it is possible that the rate of dephosphorylation is different and may account for the slower dephosphorylation seen in intact systems (4.Talosi L. Eds I. Kranias E.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: H791-H797PubMed Google Scholar) and suggests that one of the serines may be more or less constitutively phosphorylated with the other serine being functionally more important. Mouse CTnI cDNA was obtained by screening a mouse cardiac cDNA library (Clontech) using an oligonucleotide synthesized according to the published rat CTnI sequence(13.Zhang R. Potter J.D. Biophys. J. 1992; 61: A280Google Scholar, 24.Murphy A.M. Jones L. Sims H.F. Strauss H.W. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 707-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). In situ mutagenesis of CTnI was performed using a T7-Gen™ in vitro mutagenesis kit (U. S. Biochemical Corp.) according to the protocol provided by the manufacturer. An oligonucleotide (5′-ATC AGC CAT GGT GAT CTC CAG −3′) was used to create an NcoI restriction site 5′ to the translation start site, so that the NcoI and BamHI fragment containing the whole translational cDNA sequence could be subcloned into the pET expression vector (Novagen). The following three oligonucleotides were used to create three mutants: 1) 5′-TTG GCA GAG GCG CGG CGT CGG-3′ for CTnIS22A mutant, in which Ser-22 was changed to Ala-22; 2) 5′-TAG TTG GCA GCG GAG CGG CGT-3′ for the CTnIS-23A mutant, where Ser 23 was changed to Ala 23; and 3) 5′-TAG TTG GCA GCG GCG CGG CGT CGG-3′ was used to create the CTnIS22A/S23A mutant, where both Ser-22 and Ser-23 were changed to Ala-22 and Ala-23. Bovine CTnC was isolated as reported previously (25.Potter J.D. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 85: 241-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar) and was used to prepare a CTnC affinity column. In brief, the protein (100 mg) was dissolved in coupling buffer (0.1 M NaHCO3, pH 8.3, 0.5 M NaCl) and then mixed with 5 g of CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B (Sigma) equilibrated with 1 mM HCl. After 2 h of incubation at room temperature, the gel was transferred to a blocking solution (0.2 M glycine, pH 8.0) and incubated for 2 h at room temperature. The gel was then washed with coupling buffer and then a solution containing 0.1 M sodium acetate, pH 4.0, and 0.5 M NaCl, and finally by coupling buffer again. The Sepharose was then packed into a column and equilibrated with desired starting buffer. The cDNAs from wild type CTnI and the mutants described above were excised from double-stranded M13mp18 DNA using the restriction enzymes NcoI and BamHI and subcloned into the expression vectors pET11d or pET3d (Novagen). The proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) (Novagen) using the protocol provided by the manufacturer. The expression was checked by 15% SDS-PAGE and Western blotting using a monoclonal anti-rabbit skeletal TnI antibody (made in Dr. Potter's laboratory). The culture for bacterial expression was collected and centrifuged at 7,000 rpm (JA-10, Beckman). The bacterial pellet was dissolved in a solution containing 6 M urea, 10 mM sodium citrate, pH 7.0, 1 mM DTT, 2 mM EDTA and sonicated (Sonicator, Heat Systems, Inc., Farmingdale, NY) twice at setting 8 for 2 min at 4°C. After the sonication, the pH of the solution was adjusted to 5.0, and the mixture was centrifuged again at 18,000 rpm (JA-20, Beckman) at 4°C for 30 min. The supernatant, containing the expressed TnI, was loaded onto a CM-52 ion-exchange column equilibrated with the same buffer used to dissolve the bacterial pellet, except that the pH was 5.0. The CTnI was eluted with a linear KCl gradient of 0-0.4 M in the equilibrating buffer. The fractions containing CTnI (identified by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting) were pooled together and dialyzed against 1 M NaCl, 50 mM Tris, pH 7.0, 2 mM CaCl2, 1 mM DTT and loaded onto a TnC affinity column equilibrated with the same buffer. Pure TnI was eluted with a double gradient of urea (0-6 M) and EDTA (0-3 mM) in a solution containing 50 mM Tris, pH 7.0, 1 M NaCl, and 1 mM DTT. The resulting yield was 2-4 mg of pure CTnI/liter culture. The protocol for TnI phosphorylation was modified based on the protocol kindly provided by Dr. Evangelia Kranias, University of Cincinnati. Briefly, wild type CTnI or its mutants (1 μg of each) were phosphorylated in a solution containing 100 mM NaCl, 50 mM MgCl2, 50 mM sodium phosphate, pH 6.8, 10 μM ATP, [γ-32P]ATP (specific activity, 250-600 cpm/pmol) and the catalytic subunit of PKA (Sigma) 70 units/ml at 30°C. For measuring maximal phosphate incorporation into the wild type or mutated TnIs, phosphorylation was carried out for 2 h and was terminated by adding 20 μg of bovine serum albumin as carrier for precipitation followed by trichloroacetic acid to 10% to precipitate the proteins. The precipitated proteins were washed again with a 10% trichloroacetic acid solution. The precipitated proteins were mixed with 20 ml of Cytoscint (ICN) and subjected to scintillation counting (LS 1801, Beckman). The phosphate incorporation was calculated according to the specific activity. In a parallel experiment to determine the time course of phosphorylation of CTnI, the phosphorylation reactions were terminated after 30 s, 1 min, 2 min, 5 min, 10 min, 20 min, 30 min, or 60 min with the addition of 1 volume of SDS sample buffer (2.0% SDS, 5 mM Tris-glycine, pH 6.8, 2%β-mercaptethanol, 20% sucrose, 0.05% bromphenol blue) to each sample. Portions of these phosphorylation samples were electrophoresed on SDS-PAGE. The gels were dried and exposed to x-ray film, or the phosphorylated CTnI was cut from the gel, mixed with 20 ml of Cytoscint (ICN) and subjected to scintillation counting. The relative phosphate incorporation for the reactions stopped at different reaction times were calculated by comparing the radioactivity of these gel slices with a gel slice containing a fully phosphorylated TnI whose phosphate incorporation had been determined simultaneously by trichloroacetic acid precipitation as mentioned above. A complex of TnC and TnI was formed by combining TnC and TnI in a molar ratio of 1:1.2 in a solution containing 6 M urea, 20 mM MOPS, pH 7.0, 0.5 mM CaCl2, 1 M KCl, and 1 mM DTT. After dialyzing the protein mixtures against this solution for 2 h, the sample was then successively dialyzed against 1, 0.7, 0.4, 0.2, and 0.05 M KCl in a solution containing 20 mM MOPS, pH 7.0, 0.5 mM MgCl2, and 1 mM DTT. Any excess TnI that precipitated was removed by centrifugation. The complex formation was confirmed by running the supernatant samples on SDS-PAGE. Cardiac muscle was isolated from the left ventricle of porcine hearts and chemically skinned by incubation with 1% Triton X-100 in the pCa 8.0 relaxing solution (see below) at 4°C for 1 h. The skinned cardiac muscle (CSM) was then incubated in the same solution plus 50% glycerol for 24 h at −20°C and stored in 50% glycerol in the pCa 8.0 solution without Triton X-100 at −20°C. For experiments, CSM was dissected into small fiber bundles (0.5 cm long and 0.1-0.15 cm in diameter). Skeletal muscle was isolated from rabbit psoas muscle and immersed for 30 min in pCa 8.0 relaxation solution at 4°C. Then the muscle bundles was excised into small bundles (2-4 mm in diameter, 8-10 cm in length) and tied to wooden sticks. The bundles were incubated in pCa 8.0 solution containing 50% glycerol for overnight at 4°C. The bundles were changed to a fresh pCa 8.0 solution containing 50% glycerol and then stored at −20°C until use. The CSM or skeletal fibers were mounted using stainless steel clips to a force transducer (26.Guth K. Potter J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 13627-13635Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and immersed in a relaxation solution (pCa 8.0) containing 10−8M [Ca2+], 5 mM [Mg2+], 7 mM EGTA, 20 mM imidazole, 5 mM [Mg2+-ATP], 20 mM creatine phosphate, and 15 units/ml creatine phosphokinase, pH 7.0, ionic strength = 150 mM. The contraction solution (pCa 4.0) had the same composition as the pCa 8.0 solution except the Ca2+ concentration was 10−4M and was used to measure the initial force. To determine the Ca2+ dependence of force development, the contraction of CSM was tested in solutions containing intermediate concentrations of Ca2+. The CSM or skeletal fibers was phosphorylated with PKA in a freshly prepared solution containing 50 mM phosphate, 50 mM MgCl2, 50 mM NaCl, 10 mM Mg2+-ATP, and 0.5 unit/μl of the catalytic subunit of PKA, for 1 h at room temperature. The CSM was then washed with the pCa 8.0 relaxing solution. To monitor the level of phosphorylation of CSM, [32P-γ]ATP was added to the phosphorylation mixture. The radiolabeled CSM was solubilized in SDS sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE (15%) and autoradiography (22.Zhang R. Zhao J. Potter J.D. Circ. Res. 1995; 76: 1028-1035Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). The Ca2+ dependence of the same CSM or skeletal fibers was measured before and after phosphorylation. The CSM was first tested for its initial force in the pCa 4.0 solution. Extraction of the endogenous CTnI was performed by incubation of the CSM in a 10 mM orthovanadate solution, pH 6.7, for 10 min(27.Strauss J.D. Zeugner C. Van Eyk J.E. Bletz C. Troschka M. Ruegg J.C. FEBS Lett. 1992; 310: 229-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 28.Potter J.D. Sheng Z. Pan B.-S. Zhao J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2557-2562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The vanadate was subsequently removed by washing with the pCa 8.0 relaxing solution. The extent of CTnI extraction was estimated from the resultant Ca2+-independent force seen in the pCa 8.0 relaxing solution. After the Ca2+-independent contraction had reached the maximum, the CSM was incubated with 10 μM CTnC•CTnI complex for 3 h at room temperature. Incubation with the CTnC•CTnI complex with the CSM was necessary, since the vanadate treatment extracts both endogenous CTnI and CTnC, and since it has been shown (28.Potter J.D. Sheng Z. Pan B.-S. Zhao J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2557-2562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) that the reconstitution of Ca2+ regulation is maximal using this protocol. The CTnC•CTnI complex was prepared from bovine CTnC and either the wild type or mutated mouse CTnI as described under “Materials and Methods.” The extent of reconstitution was estimated from the amount of Ca2+-dependent force regained after incubation with the CTnC•CTnI complex. Force measurements were initiated when the reconstituted force reached more than 50% of the original force. The Ca2+ dependence of force development was determined and compared before and after phosphorylation of the CSM(22.Zhang R. Zhao J. Potter J.D. Circ. Res. 1995; 76: 1028-1035Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of the reconstituted CSM was performed under the same conditions as described for the nonextracted CSM. [γ-32P]ATP was included in the phosphorylation solution to monitor the levels of phosphorylation of wild type CTnI and its mutants after they were reconstituted into the CTnI-depleted CSM. The expression of wild type CTnI and its mutants was carried out in BL21(DE3) host cells in which the expression was controlled by the expression of the T7 RNA polymerase promoter. The purification of CTnI was reported previously and essentially the same as that used in purifying skeletal TnI(29.Sheng Z. Pan B.S. Miller T.E. Potter J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25407-25413Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). An improvement was made by applying an EDTA (0-3 mM) and urea (0-6 M) double gradient to the TnC affinity column to remove other protein contaminants prior to eluting CTnI from the CTnC affinity column. Since the affinity of CTnI for CTnC is quite high, the bound CTnI can only be eluted from the TnC affinity column in the presence of 6 M urea, 2 mM EDTA, and 1 M NaCl, or near the end of the described gradient, with other contaminating proteins eluted during the first half of the gradient. Fig. 1A shows the SDS-PAGE patterns of the bacterial lysate, and Fig. 1B shows the purified wild type CTnI and the indicated mutants. The levels of expression of CTnI (2-4 mg/liter of culture) was not as high as that seen previously for skeletal TnI in the same system(29.Sheng Z. Pan B.S. Miller T.E. Potter J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25407-25413Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); however, this method proved to be very efficient and effective to purify CTnI from bacteria expression system. The different levels of CTnI phosphorylation detected in cardiac tissues (16.Stull J.T. Manning D.R. High C.W. Blumenthal D.K. Fed. Proc. 1980; 39: 1552-1557PubMed Google Scholar) suggest the possible co-existence of two monophosphate and/or biphosphate forms of CTnI. In this experiment we used wild type CTnI and its mutants to study the time course of CTnI phosphorylation of each of the two serine residues (22 and 23), and thus we could carefully control the experimental variables and we could compare our data with other phosphorylation studies using either CTnI isolated from cardiac muscle or synthetic CTnI peptides(14.Swiderek K. Jaquet K. Meyer H.E. Heilmeyer Jr., L.M.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 176: 335-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 15.Swiderek K. Jaquet K. Meyer H.E. Schachtele C. Hofmann F. Heilmeyer Jr., L.M.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 190: 575-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 16.Stull J.T. Manning D.R. High C.W. Blumenthal D.K. Fed. Proc. 1980; 39: 1552-1557PubMed Google Scholar). Phosphorylation reactions were stopped at different reaction times (Fig. 2). In order to observe possible differences in the rates of phosphorylation of these two serine residues, the concentration of PKA used for the reaction was limited to 70 units/ml. As expected, we did not observe any phosphorylation of the CTnIS22A/S23A mutant (data not shown). We also confirmed previous observations (14.Swiderek K. Jaquet K. Meyer H.E. Heilmeyer Jr., L.M.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 176: 335-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) that both serines 22 and 23 are able to be phosphorylated by PKA. Fig. 2, A-C, illustrates the different rates of TnI phosphorylation observed on autoradiograms. Fig. 2C shows that phosphorylation of CTnIS23A was not detected in these autoradiograms before 1 min of phosphorylation, whereas phosphorylation of wild type CTnI (Fig. 2A) and the CTnIS22A mutant (Fig. 2B) were able to be observed during this time. The level of phosphorylation of wild type and the mutated TnIs were calculated and are plotted in Fig. 2D. As can be seen from Fig. 2D, the rate of CTnIS22A phosphorylation is faster than that of CTnIS23A. After 30 min of phosphorylation, CTnIS22A was almost fully phosphorylated, while CTnIS23A was only half-phosphorylated. Wild type CTnI, CTnIS22A and CTnIS23A could be phosphorylated up to 1.61 ± 0.18, 0.92 ± 0.04, and 0.85 ± 0.03 mol of phosphate/mol of protein, respectively. Interestingly, the phosphorylation of the wild type protein is essentially equal to the sum of the phosphorylation of the two mutants, implying that the phosphorylation of Ser-22 and Ser-23 are independent. Under our reaction conditions, there was no additional phosphorylation after 60 min of incubation with PKA, indicating that the proteins were fully phosphorylated. To determine the effect of PKA on the ca2+rdiac skinned muscle, the CSM was phosphorylated as described under “Materials and Methods,” solubilized in SDS sample buffer, and analyzed on SDS-PAGE as shown in Fig. 3. The autoradiogram shown in Fig. 3 indicates that the primary site of phosphorylation of CSM by PKA is CTnI. Under our experimental conditions the amount of C-protein phosphorylation varied from lightly to barely phosphorylated, while the CTnI phosphorylation was always high, and this result is consistent with a report by Venema and Kuo (7.Venema R.C. Kuo J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2705-2711Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Except for CTnI and C-terminal protein, there were no other proteins phosphorylated by PKA under our experimental conditions. The effect of PKA on the Ca sensitivity of muscle contraction was examined and demonstrated in Fig. 3. The Ca2+ dependence of force development of phosphorylated and dephosphorylated CSM was plotted and fit using the Hill equation. We found that phosphorylation of CSM did not change the maximal force at pCa 4.0; however, the pCa50 decreased from 5.51 ± 0.02 to 5.25 ± 0.04 (Table 2), demonstrating a decreased Ca2+ sensitivity of force development of the CSM after phosphorylation. Moreover, incubation of CSM in the phosphorylation solution without PKA for up to 2 h did not change the Ca2+ dependence of muscle contraction as compared to unphosphorylated CSM (Fig. 3). Therefore, the decrease in Ca2+ sensitivity of the force development of CSM could only be brought about by PKA treatment.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab Based on the CTnI extraction method reported by Strauss et al.(27.Strauss J.D. Zeugner C. Van Eyk J.E. Bletz C. Troschka M. Ruegg J.C. FEBS Lett. 1992; 310: 229-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), a 10 mM orthovanadate solution was used to extract endogenous CTnI from the CSM. The modification we made here was to use the CTnI•CTnC complex for the reconstitution, since both endogenous proteins, CTnI and CTnC, are extracted from CSM during the vanadate treatment, and previous results have shown that reconstitution is much greater using this protocol(28.Potter J.D. Sheng Z. Pan B.-S. Zhao J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2557-2562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4A, the force developed by the CSM after 10-min incubation with 10 mM vanadate, gradually became independent of Ca2+ after incubation in the pCa 8 solution for about 30 min. This occurs when the vanadate is washed out by the pCa 8.0 solution, and the CSM contracts even in t"

The outer membrane VirG (IcsA) protein is essential for bacterial spreading by eliciting polar deposition of filamentous actin (F-actin) in the cytoplasm of epithelial cells. Recent studies have indicated that an N-terminal 80-kDa VirG portion is exposed on the bacterial cell surface and released into the external medium, while the following 37-kDa C-terminal portion is embedded in the outer membrane, although little is known about the extracellular transport of the VirG protein. In this study, we attempted to elucidate the export pathway of VirG protein across the outer membrane and found that the C-terminal 37-kDa portion, termed VirG β-core, serves as the self-transporter for the secretion of the preceding 80-kDa portion from the periplasmic side of the outer membrane to the external side. Indeed, foreign polypeptides such as MalE or PhoA covalently linked to the N terminus of VirG β-core were transported to the external side of the outer membrane, and it was further shown that the folding structure of the passenger polypeptide at the periplasmic side of the outer membrane interferes with its translocation. Analysis of the secondary structure of VirG β-core predicted that the critical structural property was a β-barrel channel consisting of amphipathic antiparallel transmembrane β-strands, interspersed by hairpin turns and loops. These results thus strongly suggest that the secretion of VirG protein from Shigella is similar to the export system utilized by the IgA protease of Neisseria. The ability of Shigella to spread within and between epithelial cells is a prerequisite for causing bacillary dysentery and requires the function encoded by the virG gene on the large plasmid.

These results thus strongly suggest that the secretion of VirG protein from Shigella is similar to the export system utilized by the IgA protease of Neisseria. Shigella are the causative agents of shigellosis, a disease which provokes a severe, bloody diarrhea in humans and primates. Shigellosis is endemic in developing countries and is a major killer of young children. The abilities of Shigella to enter colonic epithelial cells and to subsequently spread within and between the cells are a prerequisite for causing dysentery. The capacity of the bacteria to spread in the cytoplasm and then to move into adjacent epithelial cells is known as intra/intercellular spreading, respectively, and is encoded by the virG gene on the large plasmid(1.Makino S. Sasakawa C. Kamata T. Yoshikawa M. Cell. 1986; 46: 551-555Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 2.Bernardini M.L. Mounier J. D'Hauteville H. Coquis-Rondon M. Sansonetti P.J.

Sansonetti P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 3867-3871Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar). The outer membrane VirG (IcsA) protein of Shigella, comprising 1102 amino acids, has been shown to be responsible for the localized deposition of filamentous actin (F-actin) trailing from one pole of invading bacterial cells and extending in a filament through the host epithelial cytoplasm(4.Prevost M.-C. Lesourd M. Arpin F. Vernel F. Mounier J. Hellio R. Sansonetti P.J. Infect. Immun. 1992; 60: 4088-4099Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5.Goldberg M.B. Barzu O. Parsot C. Sansonetti P.J. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 2189-2196Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). This observed F-actin tail associated with the infecting bacteria apparently provides a motive force, since the accumulation of F-actin fibrils results in the formation of extracellular protrusions through which bacteria penetrate adjacent cells(4.Prevost M.-C. Lesourd M. Arpin F. Vernel F. Mounier J. Hellio R. Sansonetti P.J. Infect. Immun. 1992; 60: 4088-4099Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the presentation of a portion of the VirG protein on the cell surface at one pole of the bacterium is crucial for expressing the VirG function within the host cell cytoplasm. Recent studies have shown that an N-terminal 80-kDa VirG portion exposed on the cell surface is cleaved off from the joining C-terminal 37-kDa portion at the Arg758-Arg759 bond, leaving the 37-kDa portion embedded in the outer membrane(6.Fukuda I. Suzuki T. Munakata H. Hayashi N. Katayama E. Yoshikawa M. Sasakawa C. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 1719-1726Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Sequencing of the N-terminal amino acids of the 80-kDa VirG portion using Edman degradation has indicated that the 52 N-terminal amino acids of the VirG polypeptide preceding the 80-kDa portion are cleaved off and contain 21 amino acids most likely corresponding to an atypical signal sequence(5.Goldberg M.B. Barzu O. Parsot C. Sansonetti P.J. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 2189-2196Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 6.Fukuda I. Suzuki T. Munakata H. Hayashi N. Katayama E. Yoshikawa M. Sasakawa C. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 1719-1726Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These studies thus suggest that the VirG protein undergoes N terminus processing while crossing the cytoplasmic membranes and that the remaining N-terminal 80-kDa portion is cleaved off after secretion onto the outer membrane, although the mechanisms underlying the export of the 80-kDa protein across the outer membrane remain unknown. In this context, we attempted to elucidate the export pathway of the VirG protein through the outer membrane. The data presented in this study revealed that the C-terminal 37-kDa portion embedded in the outer membrane is involved in the translocation of the preceding VirG portion from the periplasmic space to the external side of the outer membrane. Analysis of the secondary structure of the amino acids of the 37-kDa portion with the AMPHI secondary structure prediction computer program (7.Vogel H. Jähnig F. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 190: 191-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar) indicated the presence of a number of amphipathic antiparallel β-sheets and an α-helix capable of forming a channel in the outer membrane. Translational fusion of a foreign protein such as MalE or PhoA protein to the N terminus 37-kDa VirG portion revealed that the 37-kDa portion was capable of transporting the passenger polypeptides from the periplasm to the external side of the outer membrane. Based on these results, we propose a model of the VirG export pathway across the outer membrane.

The nucleotide sequence of the mutagenic oligonucleotide was 5′-GGGCCAATACGTTTTCGTACTCCTCTT-3' and was used to replace Ala residues with Arg residues at positions 50 and 52 in the VirG polypeptide. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed with the U.S.E. mutagenesis kit (Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden). Mutagenesis was performed on the 2444-bp ( 1The abbreviations used are: bpbase pair(s)2-ME2-mercaptoethanolPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisPCRpolymerase chain reactionELISAenzyme-linked immunosorbent assayPBSphosphate-buffered saline.)

The 2444-bp fragment cloned into pBR322 was digested with EcoRI and HindIII. Single-stranded DNA was then annealed with the phosphorylated mutagenesis primer and selection primer (5′-GAGCTTTACCGCCGGGCCTCGCGCGTT-3'), which prevented linearization of the double-stranded DNA upon PvuII digestion.

The resulting double-stranded circular DNA was digested with PvuII and transformed into a mutS E. coli strain. The parental strand, in linear form due to PvuII digestion, was not efficiently transformed. The plasmid DNAs extracted from a pool of transformants were digested with PvuII again and transformed into the same strain. After recovering plasmid DNA from several transformants, mutagenized DNA sequences were confirmed by sequencing and used to replace the parental 2444-bp EcoRI-HindIII fragment on pD10.

After cell debris was eliminated by centrifugation at 3000 × g for 20 min, the cleared lysate thus obtained was pelleted down at 150,000 × g for 2 h at 4°C in a Type 60 Ti rotor (Beckman Instruments). The total membrane pellet was suspended in 1 ml of the same HEPES buffer, and the inner and outer membranes were separated by discontinuous sucrose gradient centrifugation(11.Osborn M.J. Gander J.E.

Perlow D.S. Boger J. J. Virol. 1985; 55: 836-839Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using the GCG software from the University of Wisconsin(22.Devereux J. Haeberli P. Smithies O. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 387-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (11514) Google Scholar). The five plasmids, pTSG211 to pTSG215 encoding MalE-VirG β-core fusions MalE-VirG β-core 1 to MalE-VirG β-core 5 (Figure 3:, Figure 4:), were constructed using pMAL(TM)-P by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Plasmid pD10 was used as template, and the oligonucleotides used were as follows: TS1 (5′-CCGGATTCCTTGTATCTTCACTT-3'), TS2 (5′-CCGGAATTCGCTGGCAGTTATATT-3'), TS3 (5′-CCGGAATTCTATGACCGACACGGT-3'), TS4 (5′-CCGGAATTCGAAACCACCATGTGG-3'), TS5 (5′-CCGGAATTCAGACAATTAAAAACC-3'), and TS6 (5′-GCTCTAGAGGTAAACACGTTTGG-3'). The oligonucleotide pairs, TS1/TS6, TS2/TS6, TS3/TS6, TS4/TS6 and TS5/TS6, were used to generate DNA sequences encoding VirG β-core 1 to VirG β-core 5, respectively. The PCR products were cleaved with EcoRI and XbaI (the restriction sites for these enzymes were present in the 5′ tails of the forward and reverse primers) and ligated to EcoRI-XbaI digested pMAL™-P. pTSG220, encoding PhoA-VirG β-core 1, was constructed from pMAL™-P using PCR. A 1534 bp DNA sequence encoding the phoA gene and its promotor sequence (23.Chang C.N. Kuang W.-J. Chen E.Y. Gene (Amst.). 1986; 44: 121-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) was cloned using a PCR fragment amplified from E. coli W3110 using oligonucleotide pairs TS7 (5′-TCCCCCGGGTTGAAGCATCCTCGTCAG-3')/TS8 (5′-CGCGGATCCTTTCAGCCCCAGAGCGGC-3'), containing SmaI and BamHI sites in the 5′ tail, respectively. PCR product digested with SmaI and BamHI was ligated to EcoRV-BamHI-digested pCHR404 (pTSG219). A 1171-bp BamHI-SalI virG β-core 1 segment from pTSG211 was ligated to the BamHI-SalI fragment of pTSG219, creating a phoA-virG β-core gene fusion (pTSG220) (Fig. 4B).Figure 3:Secondary structure prediction of VirG β-core. A, amphipathic β-sheet prediction. The C-terminal membrane targeting VirG domain (Arg759 to Phe1102) was analyzed for amphipathic β-sheets according to the secondary structure prediction method of Vogel and Jähnig(7.Vogel H. Jähnig F. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 190: 191-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar), utilizing the AMPHI program(20.Jähnig F. Trends Biochem.

Filled bars indicate the clearly predicted membrane-spanning β-strands. Open bars and the open cylinder indicate additional possible β-strands and amphipathic α-helical structure, respectively. Regions of high surface probability (HSP) are indicated by filled boxes. B, a representation one of several possible structures of VirG β-core in the outer membrane with one amino acid sequence in one-letter code. The VirG β-core (Arg759 to Phe1102) may be composed of 14 amphipathic β-strands and one N-terminal amphipathic α-helical structure with an average of 9 amino acid residues per strand, sufficient to traverse the hydrophobic core of the membrane. Eleven β-strands are clearly predicted by AMPHI (continuous lines), while four more are hypothetical (broken lines). The transmembrane segments may form a β-barrel structure with the hydrophobic amino acid side chains facing the lipid phase of the outer membrane (bold letter code) and the hydrophilic side chains facing the center of a hydrophilic pore (plain letter code). Regions of proposed high surface probability are printed in italics. The N-terminal region protrudes into the extracellular space. Arrowheads indicate the preferential cleavage sites of α-domain with trypsin and proteinase K digestion(6.Fukuda I. Suzuki T. Munakata H. Hayashi N. Katayama E. Yoshikawa M. Sasakawa C. J.

(24.Andrews G.P. Hromockyj A.E. Coker C. Maurelli A.T. Infect. Immun. 1991; 59: 1997-2005Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with modifications. Bacterial cells were harvested and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in 10 mM phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4) for 20 min at room temperature. They were then washed twice with PBS and incubated with 2% bovine serum albumin in PBS at room temperature for 30 min. Cells were incubated with antibody specific for MalE or PhoA protein for 1 h at 37°C. After three washes with PBS, 0.05% Tween 20 (PBST), horseradish peroxidase-conjugated protein A was added and incubated for 30 min at 37°C. After three washes with PBST, the cells were incubated with 0.3 mg/ml of 2,2'-azidodi-(3-ethylbenzthiazoline sulfonic acid) diammonium salt dissolved in 50 mM citric acid and 100 mM Na2HPO4 for 30 min at room temperature. After centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 1 min, absorbance of the supernatant was measured at 405 nm using ELISA reader model 450 (Bio-Rad). The procedure described by Klauser et al. (25.Klauser T. Krämer J. Otzelberger K. Pohlner J. Meyer T.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 579-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) was slightly modified and used. Cells corresponding to 1 ml of bacterial culture were washed twice with PBS and resuspended in 250 μl of PBS (physiologically intact cells) or 20% sucrose, 10 mM EDTA in PBS (osmotically shocked cells). Those were then incubated with proteinase K (E. Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) at a final concentration of 100 μg/ml at room temperature for 1 h. To shut off protein synthesis during the incubation, chloramphenicol was added to a concentration of 0.1 μg/ml. Control samples were incubated under the same conditions but without proteinase K. Proteolysis was terminated by trichloroacetic acid precipitation at a final concentration of 8% (w/v) with the mixture incubated on ice for 20 min. To minimize further proteolysis, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride was added in following steps for sample preparation. The protein precipitates were resuspended in 100 μl of SDS sample buffer and boiled for 5 min. A 10-μl aliquot was subsequently separated by SDS-PAGE and used for immunoblot analysis. To confirm that cleavage occurred after the putative signal sequence of VirG protein was employed in crossing the cytoplasmic membrane(5.Goldberg M.B. Barzu O. Parsot C. Sansonetti P.J. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 2189-2196Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar), we utilized pD10, a cloned virG plasmid(3.Lett M.-C. Sasakawa C. Okada N. Sakai T. Makino S. Yamada M. Komatsu K. Yoshikawa M. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 353-359Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Since Ala50 and Ala52, at the C terminus of the signal peptide sequence of VirG (Fig. 1), have been indicated to be involved in cleaving with signal peptidase(26.Fikes J.D. Bankaitis V.A. Ryan J.P. Bassford Jr., P.J. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 2345-2351Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27.Fikes J.D. Bassford Jr., P.J. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 2352-2359Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28.Shen L.I.

Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 563-568Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we changed the Ala residues at positions 50 and 52 with Arg residues by using site-directed mutagenesis. The resulting virG mutant plasmid (pTSG204) encoding the mutated VirG with Arg50 and Arg52 was then introduced into M94 (a virG mutant of S. flexneri) (1.Makino S. Sasakawa C. Kamata T. Yoshikawa M. Cell. 1986; 46: 551-555Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar) and examined for the distribution of VirG protein in the cytoplasm, inner membrane, periplasm, outer membrane, and the culture supernatant. As a positive control, pD10 (wild type VirG) was introduced into M94 and used for the analysis. The immunoblots with VRG-120 showed that a large amount of VirG protein expressed in M94 carrying pD10 distributed in the outer membrane, with some in the cytoplasm, but was not present in the cytoplasmic membrane or in the periplasm (Fig. 2)(6.Fukuda I. Suzuki T. Munakata H. Hayashi N. Katayama E. Yoshikawa M. Sasakawa C. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 1719-1726Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19.Nakata N. Tobe T. Fukuda I. Suzuki T. Komatsu K. Yoshikawa M. Sasakawa C. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 9: 459-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the mutant VirG protein expressed from M94 carrying pTSG204 was barely detectable in the outer membrane, but, instead, was present in the cytoplasm (Fig. 2). The level of VirG protein in M94 carrying pTSG204 detected in the whole-cell lysate was, however, less compared with that in M94 carrying pD10 (Fig. 2). Since the levels of virG transcription from M94 carrying pTSG204 and M94 carrying pD10 were essentially the same as measured by RNA-dot blot hybridization with the virG-specific probe (data not shown), the premature VirG protein is probably proteolytically degraded in the cytoplasm(27.Fikes J.D. Bassford Jr., P.J. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 2352-2359Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31.Bassford P. Beckwith J. Nature. 1979; 277: 538-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 32.Bankaitis V.A. Bassford Jr., P.J. Cell. 1984; 37: 243-252Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Since YSH6200 (the large plasmid cured derivative of S. flexneri YSH6000) carrying pD10 or E. coli K-12 UT5600 (an ompT mutant) carrying pD10 was able to present the 80-kDa VirG portion on the cell surface, ( 2T. Suzuki, unpublished results.) this suggested that, in contrast to general Sec-dependent exoproteins, the export of VirG protein crossing the outer membrane did not require any separately encoded accessory factors(25.Klauser T. Krämer J. Otzelberger K. Pohlner J. Meyer T.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 579-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 29.Pugsley A.P. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 57: 50-108Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore reasoned that the C-terminal 37-kDa VirG portion, which was found to be embedded in the outer membrane(6.Fukuda I. Suzuki T. Munakata H. Hayashi N. Katayama E. Yoshikawa M. Sasakawa C. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 1719-1726Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19.Nakata N. Tobe T. Fukuda I. Suzuki T. Komatsu K. Yoshikawa M. Sasakawa C. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 9: 459-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), could be involved in the secretion of the N-terminal 80-kDa VirG moiety to the external side of the outer membrane. To investigate its structural property, the secondary structure of 344 amino acids in the C-terminal 37-kDa VirG portion was analyzed using the AMPHI secondary structure prediction program of membrane proteins(7.Vogel H. Jähnig F. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 190: 191-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar, 20.Jähnig F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 93-95Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Accordingly, in the 344 amino acids encompassing Arg759 to Phe1102 of the C-terminal 37-kDa VirG portion (see Fig. 1), at least 11 amphipathic transmembrane β-strands were predictable (Fig. 3A). We were also able to predict four additional transmembrane domains (Fig. 3A); three of those, containing Ile823, Val929, and Asp986 as the hydrophobic centers, respectively, possessed an amphipathic β-strand-like profile (although Hβ(i) < 1.6) of hydrophobic center (see ref. 20), while the remaining one seemed to exhibit an amphipathic α-helical transmembrane structure (presented as an open cylinder in Fig. 3A). Furthermore, the prediction of high surface probability regions (21.Emini E.A. Huges J.V. Perlow D.S. Boger J. J. Virol. 1985; 55: 836-839Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using GCG software (22.Devereux J. Haeberli P. Smithies O. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 387-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (11514) Google Scholar) revealed that there were at least six regions found in loops exposed on the outer membrane (see Fig. 3B). Based on the AMPHI prediction together with the high surface probability prediction, we propose a β-barrel structure model for the 37-kDa VirG portion integrated into the outer membrane as shown in Fig. 3C. We thereby referring to the C-terminal 344 amino acid VirG sequence as VirG β-core (see Fig. 1). To demonstrate the ability of VirG β-core to present its preceding 80-kDa VirG portion, termed VirG α-domain, on the outer membrane, a MalE polypeptide of E. coli K-12 was covalently linked to the N terminus of VirG β-core and examined for its ability to present on the cell surface. To do this, the 1145-bp DNA sequence encoding VirG β-core was ligated to the EcoRI-XbaI sites in the multicloning site 12 bp upstream from the 3′ end of the malE gene on pMAL(TM)-P. Consequently, the fifth last amino acid of the MalE polypeptide was followed by 17 amino acids, created by insertion of the multicloning sequence used, fused to Leu764 at the N terminus of VirG β-core. The plasmid encoding this fusion protein (MalE-VirG β-core 1) was designated pTSG211 (Fig. 4A). pTSG211 transformed into UT5600 was then induced by 10 μM isopropyl β-D-thiogalactopyranoside to express the fusion protein at a similar level to that of the endogenous MalE expressed in UT5600, and the MalE level present on the cell surface was examined using whole-cell ELISA with a MalE-specific antibody. As the control, pMAL(TM)-P introduced into UT5600 was used, since the MalE protein translationally fused with LacZα has been shown to be presented in the periplasm (Fig. 4A). The results showed that UT5600 carrying pTSG211 (MalE-VirG β-core 1), but not UT5600 carrying pMAL(TM)-P (MalE-LacZα), was able to present MalE on the cell surface (Fig. 5A).

Depending on whether the IRE is located in the 5′- or 3′-untranslated region (UTR), binding of IRP will inhibit mRNA translation or degradation, respectively. Here we describe a new IRE in the 5′-UTR of succinate dehydrogenase subunit b (SDHb) mRNA of Drosophila melanogaster. The SDHb IRE binds in vitro to vertebrate and insect IRPs with a high affinity equal to that of human ferritin H chain IRE. Under conditions of iron deprivation, SDHb mRNA of Drosophila SL-2 cells shifts to a non-polysome-bound pool. Moreover, translation of a human growth hormone mRNA with the SDHb IRE in its 5′-UTR is iron-dependent in stably transfected L cells. We conclude that the SDHb IRE mediates translational inhibition both in insect and vertebrate cells. This constitutes the first identification of a functional IRE in insects.

They were oxidized to form disulfide-bridged loops of different sizes at different positions. In the presence of a protonmotive force, proOmpAs possessing a smaller loop could be translocated across the membrane in vitro, whereas ones possessing loops comprising more than 16 amino acid residues were hard to translocate. The sizes of polypeptide chains that had been translocated and had become protease-resistant were determined in both the presence and absence of the protonmotive force. The size was the same for all proOmpAs possessing the first cysteine residue between +244 (proOmpA L59) and +274 (proOmpA L29). When the first cysteine residue was moved further away from the N terminus, a sudden increase in size, of approximately 30 amino acid residues, was observed, the size being the same for proOmpAs possessing the first cysteine residue between +278 (proOmpA L25) and +293 (proOmpA L10). The shift in size between proOmpA L29 and proOmpA L25 was observed with different proteases exhibiting different substrate specificities. Treatment with these proteases resulted in complete digestion of SecA on everted membrane vesicles, whereas Sec proteins integrated into membranes were considerably resistant to the treatment.

The molecular mechanisms underlying the translocation of secretory proteins across the bacterial cytoplasmic membrane or eukaryotic endoplasmic reticulum membrane have been the subject of extensive studies(1.Matsuyama S.

In Escherichia coli cells, a set of Sec proteins, SecA, SecB, SecD, SecE, SecF, SecG, and SecY, have been characterized, and the roles of individual Sec proteins in the translocation reaction have been studied in some detail. SecA, translocation ATPase, is a peripheral membrane protein that plays the central role, especially in the initial stage of the translocation reaction(8.Cunningham K. Lill R. Crooke E. Rice M.

It is still unclear, however, how preproteins move across the membrane in relation to these Sec proteins. The translocation reaction is peculiar in that it exhibits no specificity as to the length of the polypeptide chain to be translocated. In E. coli cells, the shortest polypeptide chains so far reported to be translocation-competent have mature domains comprising around 45 amino acid residues(19.Freudl R. Schwartz H. Degen M. Hennig U. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 205: 771-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 20.Kato M. Tokuda H. Mizushima S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 413-418Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the longest one possessing as many as 1000 amino acid residues. Provided that these preproteins are translocated in an unfolded state, the following three possibilities can be considered as to the mode of their movement across the membrane. 1) The machinery translocates polypeptide chains by recognizing peptide bonds one by one. 2) The machinery recognizes a polypeptide of a certain length as a unit, and, therefore, translocation proceeds stepwisely. 3) The translocation of the mature domain takes place continuously in a one-step mode once it has been initiated. The first possibility is unlikely since polypeptide chains possessing an internal non-peptide domain are translocation-competent (21.Kato M. Mizushima S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3586-3593Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence suggest that the transmembrane movement may take place in a stepwise manner. Tani et al.(22.Tani K.

SP6 RNA polymerase and restriction enzymes were obtained from Takara Shuzo Co. Tran35S-label, a mixture of 70% [35S]methionine and 20% [35S]cysteine, 1000 Ci/mmol, was purchased from ICN Radiochemicals. Proteinase K was obtained from Merck, and pepsin, trypsin, and Pronase E (protease Type XIV) from Sigma. The SH reagent, 4-acetamido-4'-maleimidylstilbene-2,2'-disulfonate 2Na (AMS), was a product of Molecular Probes Inc. Molecular marker proteins were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. The SecA protein was purified as described(24.Schiebel E. Driessen A.J.M. Hartl F.U. Wickner W. Cell. 1991; 64: 927-939Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). Anti-SecA antibody was raised in rabbits against purified SecA. E. coli strains JM83 (ara, Δ(lac-pro AB), rpsL, φ80, lacZ ΔM15) and K003 (Lpp−Δunc B-C-Tn10) (27.Yamane K. Ichihara S. Mizushima S. J.

Strain TG1 (K12, Δ(lac-proAB), supE, thi, hsdD5, ′F traD36, proAB, lacIq, lacZ ΔM15) was used as the host for phage M13mp8 (Amersham). Plasmid pSI053 (28.Yamada H. Tokuda H. Mizushima S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 1723-1728Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) carries the E. coli ompA gene in the EcoRI-HindIII site of the pSP6 vector. The plasmid used as a vector for various mutated ompA genes was pSP65 (Promega), which is a 3-kbp plasmid possessing SP6 RNA promoter just before the multicloning site (29.Melton D.A. Kreg P.A. Rebagliati M.R. Maniatis T. Zinn K. Green M.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 7053-7056Crossref Scopus (4060) Google Scholar). In vitro transcription of genes encoding proOmpA and mutants derived from it was carried out as described(26.Economou A. Wickner W. Cell. 1994; 78: 835-843Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar, 29.Melton D.A. Kreg P.A. Rebagliati M.R. Maniatis T. Zinn K. Green M.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 7053-7056Crossref Scopus (4060) Google Scholar), and the translation reaction was performed in vitro in the presence of Tran35S-label (1.2 mCi/ml) as described previously(35.Kim Y.J. Rajapandi T. Oliver D. Cell. 1994; 78: 845-853Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). 35S-Labeled proOmpAs were partially purified as described previously(36.Ahn T. Kim H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 203: 326-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Translation mixtures were passed through a short column of Sephadex G-75 to remove small molecules, including ATP, NADH, and residual 35S-labeled amino acids and treated with 0.1 volume of 100 mM potassium ferricyanide as described(37.Shinkai A. Mei L.H. Tokuda H. Mizushima S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5827-5833Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23.Tani K. Tokuda H. Mizushima S. J. Biol Chem. 1990; 265: 17341-17347Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Final preparations were solubilized in 8 M urea, 50 mM potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, and then used for translocation experiments(38.Shinkai A. Akita M. Matsuyama S. Mizushima S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 172: 1217-1223Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). For a smaller scale procedure, trichloroacetic acid precipitation was employed to remove small molecules. The translation mixture (40 μl) was briefly centrifuged and the resulting supernatant was immediately treated with 8 μl of 30% trichloroacetic acid. The resulting precipitate was successively washed with 200 μl of 5% trichloroacetic acid twice and 200 μl of acetone twice. The dried material was dissolved in 90 μl of 8 M urea, 50 mM potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, and then subjected to ferricyanide treatment as described above. Everted membrane vesicles were prepared from E. coli K003 cells as described previously(39.Akita M. Shinkai A. Matsuyama S. Mizushima S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 174: 211-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The assay method for the translocation of 35S-labeled proOmpA into everted membrane vesicles was principally the same as that described previously (23.Tani K. Tokuda H. Mizushima S. J. Biol Chem. 1990; 265: 17341-17347Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In a standard experiment, the translocation reaction was carried out at 37°C for 10 min in a 25-μl assay mixture comprising 35S-labeled proOmpA, membrane vesicles (5 μg of protein), 0.4 μg of purified SecA, 5 mM ATP, 4 mM MgSO4, 5 mM NADH, and 50 mM potassium phosphate, pH 7.5. Dithiothreitol was added to the final concentration of 10 mM, if necessary. After the incubation, the mixture was kept on ice for 20 min with 5 μl of a proteinase K solution (5 μg/μl) and then analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, followed by fluorography and densitometry(22.Tani K. Shiozuka K. Tokuda H. Mizushima S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 18582-18588Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). AMS, an SH reagent, was used to determine the extent of disulfide bridge formation in the proOmpA molecule as described (30.Vestweber D. Schatz G. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 2045-2049Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) with some modifications. The details were described in the legend to Fig. 2. A 1.3-kbp EcoRI-HindIII fragment carrying the ompA gene was isolated from pSI053 and inserted into the EcoRI-HindIII site of phage M13mp8. Phage M13ompA, carrying the ompA gene, was selected from white plaques on a TG1 cell lawn. An oligonucleotide, 5′-GTTGTCACCGGTGTTGCC-3', was annealed to the single-stranded template DNA of M13ompA and recombinants were obtained according to the protocol for the Amersham oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis system. The M13ompA mutant thus obtained possessed a new Cfr10I site in the ompA gene, and thereby gave a 520-bp Cfr10I fragment in addition to a 300-bp HindIII-Cfr10I fragment and a 600-bp EcoRI-Cfr10I fragment upon digestion with EcoRI, HindIII, and Cfr10I. The mutant phage was named M13ompA290G. The ompA region was subcloned into pSP65 as a 1.3-kbp EcoRI-HindIII fragment, and the plasmid obtained was named pOA290G. One of the synthesized oligonucleotides listed in Table 1 was annealed to the single stranded template DNA of M13ompA290G. Recombinants were constructed as described above, followed by selection as to acquisition of a new site for restriction enzymes also listed in Table 1. The ompA regions in the individual mutant phages thus constructed were subcloned into pSP65 as a 1.3-kbp EcoRI-HindIII fragment to obtain pOA series plasmids.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab Everted membrane vesicles were treated with a protease either directly or under the conditions for protein translocation. For the former treatment, 25 μl of a reaction mixture, containing 6.25 μg of membrane protein, 50 mM potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, and 5 mM MgSO4, was treated with 5 μl of a protease solution (1 mg/ml) for 20 min on ice. For the latter treatment, 25 μl of a reaction mixture, containing 6.25 μg of membrane protein, 50 mM potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, 1 mM ATP, 5 mM succinate, 100 μg/ml creatine kinase, 30 mM creatine phosphate, and 1 μg of proOmpA, was incubated at 37°C for 20 min to perform the translocation reaction, and then the sample was treated with 5 μl of a protease solution for 20 min on ice as described(27.Yamane K. Ichihara S. Mizushima S. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 2358-2362Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These protease digestions were terminated by adding 25 μl of a 15% trichloroacetic acid solution. The precipitates formed were suspended in Laemmli sample buffer(31.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1972; 227: 680-685Crossref Scopus (207478) Google Scholar), subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and then transferred to a nitrocellulose filter. The blot was successively treated with either anti-SecA or anti-SecD (32.Matsuyama S. Fujita Y. Sagara K. Mizushima S. Biochem. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1122: 77-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) antibodies and anti-rabbit IgG conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (Bio-Rad), and then developed with a chemiluminescence (ECL) reagent (Amersham) on an x-ray film (Fuji). ProOmpA possesses two cysteine residues at positions +290 and +302 of its mature domain. ProOmpA was engineered at the DNA level so as to carry the first cysteine residue at different positions and, therefore, able to form intramolecular disulfide-bridged loops of different sizes at different positions. The primary structures of the proOmpAs encoded are summarized in Fig. 1. These structures have been confirmed on the DNA level. 35S-Labeled proOmpAs, synthesized and purified, were subjected to oxidation in the presence of ferricyanide. Conversion of sulfhydryl groups to a disulfide bridge was monitored by use of AMS, a sulfhydryl reagent. The results for some of the proOmpAs are shown in Fig. 2. All proOmpAs showed an almost quantitative upward change in position on an SDS gel when they were treated with AMS in the presence of dithiothreitol. No such change was observed in the absence of dithiothreitol. These results indicate that the shift of the band position was due to chemical binding of AMS to sulfhydryl groups of proOmpAs, and that the ferricyanide treatment resulted in the quantitative conversion of proOmpAs to the disulfide-bridged (looped) form. In vitro translocation of a looped wild-type proOmpA terminates at the loop in the absence of Δμ¯H+ and proceeds beyond the loop to completion when Δμ¯H+ is imposed (22, 23). Essentially the same experiment was carried out with a series of looped mutant proOmpAs (Fig. 3). In the absence of Δμ¯H+, translocation resulted in the appearance of proteinase K-resistant bands, of which the molecular sizes were smaller than those of the mature OmpAs. The result for L10, of which the loop is smaller than that of wild-type proOmpA, was similar. These results indicate that translocation of all these proOmpAs proceeded to the looped region in the absence of Δμ¯H+, as in the case of wild-type proOmpA. The completion of translocation was observed in the presence of Δμ¯H+ when the loop size was smaller than 18 amino acid residues, whereas it was not observed when the size was 20 amino acid residues or more (Figs. 3 and 4). The completion was partial in the cases of L16 and L18. These results indicate that there is a limited loop size as to translocation even in the presence of Δμ¯H+. Based on the results of the previous studies(22.Tani K. Shiozuka K. Tokuda H. Mizushima S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 18582-18588Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 40.Driessen A.J.M. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 13190-13197Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), we expected that the size of proteinase K-resistant fragments should become smaller as the loop size becomes larger (see Fig. 1). As judged from the band positions on the gel shown in Fig. 5, however, the sizes of proteinase K-resistant fragments were essentially the same with proOmpAs with loop sizes of 10-25 (L10-L25). The positions of proteinase K-resistant bands suddenly shifted downward when the loop size became larger, and the positions remained almost the same from L29 to L59. The downward shift in the band positions on the gel was estimated to be equivalent to about 3 kDa, i.e. about 30 amino acid residues (Fig. 5 and 6A).Figure 6:A stepwise profile for the sizes of translocation intermediates of looped proOmpAs was observed in both the presence and absence of Δμ¯H+. The sizes of intermediate bands were estimated from the data shown in Fig. 5 (in the absence of Δμ¯H+) and those shown in Fig. 3 (in the presence of Δμ¯H+), and plotted against the loop size. A, in the absence of Δμ¯H+; B, in the presence of Δμ¯H+.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The sizes of proteinase K-resistant fragments in the presence of Δμ¯H+ were also determined from the data shown in Fig. 3. A shift in the band positions was also observed between L25 and L29, the difference in size being estimated to be about 2.6 kDa (Fig. 6). As described earlier, no intermediate bands were observed with L10 and L13. These results suggest that the translocation mechanism was essentially the same in the presence and absence of Δμ¯H+, except that the machinery tolerates larger loops in the former. The reason for the slight difference in the shift size in the band positions between +Δμ¯H+ and −Δμ¯H+ is unknown. Although the stepwise profiles shown in Figure 5:, Figure 6: suggest possible stepwise translocation, there was the possibility that such profiles could be due to the substrate specificity of proteinase K. Therefore, we carried out otherwise the same experiment using different proteases (Fig. 7). The positions of protease-resistant bands varied with the protease species used. This is most probably due to differences in their substrate specificities as discussed later. Nevertheless, the shifts in the positions of major protease-resistant bands took place in all cases between L25 and L29, and the positions of the major bands were essentially the same for L10-L25 and L29-L59, respectively. These results strongly support the view that the stepwise profile is not due to the specificities of the proteases used but to the stepwise translocational movement of proOmpAs through the secretory machinery. When Pronase E was used, much shorter protease-resistant bands were observed for L29-L59, especially for L52 and L59. L59 also gave a shorter band upon the trypsin treatment. The reason for this appearance was not clear, although it may represent another possible translocation intermediate. The sizes of protease resistant peptide fragments of OmpAs were estimated on gels, and the results are shown in Table 2 together with the positions of the C-terminal ends, which were estimated from the sizes. In Fig. 8, these results are summarized together with the positions of the first cysteine residues and all preferable sites these proteases may attack. Around the C-terminal positions thus estimated for L10-L25, possible sites of hydrolysis by the respective proteases exist. The peptide fragment obtained on pepsin treatment has its C-terminal end around +299, which is considerably far from those of ones obtained with other proteases (around +265). This may be due to the fact that there is no cleavage site for pepsin between +265 and +299. Based on these data together, the domain in L10-L25 which is still accessible to these proteases after translocation (−Δμ¯H+) is suggested to be that from around +265 to the C terminus. It should be noted that position +265 is considerably more aminoproximal than the loop position in many of these proOmpA derivatives.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab A similar estimation was performed for L29-L59, and the results are also shown in Table 2 and Fig. 8. The C termini of the protease-resistant fragments for these proOmpAs were thus estimated to be +233-240, where the possible sites of hydrolysis by the respective proteases are located. For these proOmpA derivatives, therefore, the domain from around +235 to the C terminus is likely accessible to externally added proteases. It should be noted again that position +235 is considerably more amino-proximal than the loop position in many of these proOmpA derivatives. The position of the trypsin-resistant band given by L48 is different from those by others. This is most likely due to the change of a probable site for trypsin of Arg-Arg (∼255-256) to Cys-Arg in this mutant proOmpA. The everted membrane vesicles used for the translocation assay were treated with proteases, and the Sec proteins that survived were analyzed by immunoblotting (Fig. 9). In one series of experiments (series a), everted membrane vesicles were directly treated with proteases on ice under the conditions used for the analysis of translocated proteins, and protease-resistant fragments were analyzed by immunoblotting against anti-SecA and anti-SecD antibodies. No intact SecA was detected after the treatment with any of these proteases, whereas SecD, a protein mostly localized on the periplasmic side of the membrane(15.Gardel C. Benson S. Hunt J. Michaelis S. Beckwith J. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 1286-1290Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 16.Matsuyama S. Fujita Y. Mizushima S. EMBO. J. 1993; 12: 265-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), was rather resistant to the treatment. Since SecD has several membrane-spanning domains(15.Gardel C. Benson S. Hunt J. Michaelis S. Beckwith J. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 1286-1290Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), the result indicates that the core region of the membrane is resistant to the treatment. In the other series of experiments, everted membrane vesicles were first incubated with proOmpA, ATP, and succinate to initiate translocation, and then subjected to the protease treatment on ice (Fig. 10, series b). The results were essentially the same. A similar experiment was carried out for SecY with anti-SecY antibodies. A preliminary result indicated that some cytoplasmic domain of SecY was protease-sensitive, whereas its core region as well as its periplasmic domain was resistant (data not shown).Figure 10:Schematic representation of a possible mode of translocation of looped proOmpAs (A), and a possible stepwise mode of translocation of presecretory proteins (B). A, entry of a polypeptide chain into the translocation machinery is blocked by the loop structure. The polypeptide chain accumulates in the protease-sensitive domain of the machinery (probably in SecA) until the accumulation reaches a certain level (∼30 amino acid residues) (stages represented by L59-L29). Then the translocation across the membrane takes place (stages represented by L29-L25). B, a stepwise translocation mode proposed based on the model given in A. The open and shaded areas in the Sec machinery represent protease-sensitive and -resistant domains, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Taken together, these results suggest that only the cytoplasmic portion of the secretory machinery, including SecA, is susceptible to proteases, whereas the portion of the machinery that is embedded in the membrane or mostly exposed to the periplasmic surface is resistant to the protease treatment. In other words, the portions of preproteins that are resistant to these proteases have already been inserted into at least the membrane-embedded portion of the secretory machinery. In previous works(22.Tani K. Shiozuka K. Tokuda H. Mizushima S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 18582-18588Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23.Tani K. Tokuda H. Mizushima S. J. Biol Chem. 1990; 265: 17341-17347Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we showed that proOmpA possessing a disulfide-bridged polypeptide loop comprising 13 amino acid residues could be translocated across everted membrane vesicles of the cytoplasmic membrane of E. coli, when the membrane vesicles were fully energized. In the present work, we demonstrated that the size limit of disulfide-bridged loops that the translocation machinery tolerates is 18 amino acid residues (Figure 3:, Figure 4:). The machinery was also reported to tolerate preproteins possessing a side-arm comprising 20 amino acid residues(24.Schiebel E. Driessen A.J.M. Hartl F.U. Wickner W. Cell. 1991; 64: 927-939Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar), and ones possessing an internal non-peptide domain in the mature region(21.Kato M. Mizushima S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3586-3593Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is likely, therefore, that the machinery translocates substrates with rather low specificity through a channel that is considerably wide in the fully energized state. It is likely that the channel allowing the passage of polypeptides with such a large loop is not a closed one that fits expanded polypeptide chains, but one that is open toward the environmental lipid bilayer, as discussed previously(33.Tani K. Mizushima S. FEBS Lett. 1991; 285: 127-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Evidence for a protein-conducting channel that is laterally open to the lipid bilayer was reported for the endoplasmic reticulum membrane very recently(34.Martoglio B. Hofmann M.W. Brunner J. Dobberstein B. Cell. 1995; 81: 207-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar).Figure 3:Translocation of 35S-labeled proOmpA with or without a disulfide-bridged loop through everted membrane vesicles in the presence or absence of Δμ¯H+. Five-μl aliquots of disulfide--bridged 35S-proOmpAs (L10-L59 and 290G) in 8 M urea were diluted with 45 μl of 50 mM potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, and divided into five 9-μl portions. They were treated with 1 μl of 100 mM dithiothreitol (lanes 2, 4, and 5) or distilled water and then incubated at 37 °C for 10 min and subjected to the translocation assay. The assay mixture comprised 5 μg of everted membrane vesicles, 0.4 μg of SecA, 4 mM MgSO4, and 5 mM ATP in 50 mM potassium phosphate, pH 7.5 (total volume, 25 μl). NADH was added to lanes 3–5 at the concentration of 5 mM. After a 10-min incubation at 37 °C, the samples in lanes 1–4 were treated with 5 μl of proteinase K (5 μg/μl) for 20 min on ice. OmpAs were recovered by trichloroacetic acid precipitation, washed with acetone and ether, and then analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.

Cell. 1994; 78: 835-843Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). The results presented in the present paper support this view. We previously showed for oxidized proOmpA, which has a disulfide bridge between Cys-290 and Cys-302, thus forming a polypeptide loop of 13 amino acid residues, that translocation in the absence of Δμ¯H+ ceased when the loop reached the membrane (22, 23). In the present work, we shifted the position of one of the Cys residues (Cys-290) toward the N terminus so as to obtain proOmpA derivatives capable of forming a larger loop closer to the N terminus. If translocation ceases at the loop, the length of polypeptides that can be translocated would become shorter as the position of the first Cys residue becomes closer to the N terminus. However, the size remained almost the same for L10-L25 and L29-L59, respectively, with a considerable change, about 3 kDa, between L25 and L29. The change is not due to protease specificity since four proteases having different substrate specificities gave the same profile as to the position change, suggesting that the profile must reflect a discontinuous event during the translocation. The most probable explanation for the profile may be that depicted in Fig. 10A. We assume that the loop cannot get into the machinery, most likely remaining on the outer surface of the SecA molecule, since the C termini of the protease-resistant domain of OmpAs were always considerably more amino proximal than the loop positions (see Fig. 8). The machinery has a “room” to accommodate a polypeptide chain of a certain length, and translocation through the portion of the translocation machinery that is embedded in the membrane takes place only when the room is filled with a polypeptide. Providing this is the case, translocation of preproteins in general can be depicted as shown in Fig. 10B, namely the translocation reaction, which is triggered by a signal peptide, takes place stepwisely as the room is fully occupied by a portion of the polypeptide chain under translocation. Since SecA is the only Sec protein that is fully digested on the protease treatment, the room for polypeptide accommodation should reside in the SecA molecule. In this respect, it is very interesting that SecA molecules can be exposed to the periplasmic surface of the cytoplasmic membrane (35, 36) and undergo an ATP-driven cycle of membrane insertion and deinsertion (26). This conformational change of SecA would result in stepwise movement of preproteins. Conformational changes of SecA upon interaction with ATP, preproteins, phospholipids, and membrane vesicles have been observed (37). SecA exists as dimers (38–40). It may also be possible, therefore, that the stepwise movement is coupled with each half rotation of the SecA dimer. The size difference between before and after the shift in band position on a gel is about 3 kDa, suggesting that the stepwise translocation takes place every ∼30 amino acid residues. The movement of a polypeptide chain by about 20 amino acid residues during translocation has been demonstrated upon the addition of ATP analogs ATPγS or AMP-PNP (24). In order to strengthen the idea of stepwise translocation, we have constructed genes encoding proOmpA derivatives possessing the first cysteine residue much closer to the N terminus. However, due to the difficulty in quantitative conversion to the disulfide-bridged structure, translocation experiments could not be performed with them. It should be noted that the appearance of a shorter translocation intermediate are suggested in some of the results with L59. In the proOmpAs used in the present work, the disulfide-bridged loops were located near the C terminus. One may wonder, therefore, how such good synchronization in the stepwise translocation can be achieved even near the C-terminal end. We recently demonstrated that SecA recognizes not only the positively charged region(9.Akita M. Sasaki S. Matsuyama S. Mizushima S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8164-8169Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but also the hydrophobic stretch in signal peptides. ( 2H. Mori, M. Araki, C. Hikita, and S. Mizushima, unpublished observation.) If SecA is also able to recognize such stretches in the mature domains of secretory proteins, such stretches could function to enhance the synchronization of the stepwise process. Although the mature domains of secretory proteins are hydrophilic in general(41.Mizushima S. Inouye M. Bacterial Outer Membranes as Model Systems. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1986: 163-185Google Scholar), they usually possess a few hydrophobic stretches. The OmpA molecule has such a stretch(232-240) right before the region we manipulated in the present work. Possible interaction of hydrophobic stretches in the mature domain and SecA in relation to the mode of translocation is under investigation in this laboratory. We thank Drs. Hajime Tokuda and Shin-ichi Matsuyama of the University of Tokyo and Dr. Katsuko Tani of Tokyo University of Pharmacy and Life Science for valuable discussion and Wakana Shimizu for secretarial support."

A cross-linked collagenous extracellular matrix is required for bone formation. The goals of this study were to compare the transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1 regulation of lysyl oxidase enzyme activity and steady state mRNA levels to changes in COL1A1 mRNA levels in MC3T3-E1 osteoblastic cells. TGF-β1 increased steady state lysyl oxidase and COL1A1 mRNA levels in a dose- and time-dependent manner. The increase in lysyl oxidase mRNA levels was transient, peaking at 12 h and 8.8 times controls in cells treated with 400 pM TGF-β1. COL1A1 steady state mRNA levels increased maximally to 3.5-fold of controls. Development of increased lysyl oxidase enzyme activity was delayed and was of slightly lower magnitude than the increase in its mRNA levels. This suggested limiting post-translational processing of lysyl oxidase proenzyme. Pulse-labeling/immunoprecipitation studies demonstrated slow proenzyme secretion and proteolytic processing. Development and application of an independent assay for lysyl oxidase proenzyme proteolytic processing activity verified its proportionately lower stimulation by 400 pM TGF-β1. Thus, lysyl oxidase regulation by TGF-β1 in osteoblastic cell cultures occurs at both pre- and post-translational levels. This regulation is consistent with increased production of a collagenous extracellular matrix."

The amino acid sequences of saposins are highly similar. Each saposin consists of ~80 amino acids, including six identically placed cysteine residues(1.O'Brien J. Kishimoto Y.

Recently, we have established that human Sap B and C have the same disulfide structure, with a central big loop surrounded by two smaller ones(10.Vaccaro A.M. Salvioli R. Barca A. Tatti M.

Most likely, this disulfide arrangement is present also in Sap A and D, where the six cysteine residues are at strictly conserved positions. Consistently with their structural similarity, saposins show common physicochemical characteristics; they are heat-stable, acidic proteins resistant to most proteinases(1.O'Brien J. Kishimoto Y.

One assessed function of saposins is the promotion of the enzymatic degradation of specific sphingolipids in lysosomes(1.O'Brien J. Kishimoto Y.

Sap C appears to be required in vivo by glucosylceramidase for the hydrolysis of glucosylceramide since a genetic defect of Sap C causes a juvenile variant of Gaucher's disease with glucosylceramide accumulation in tissues(11.Christomanou H. Chabas A. Pampols T. Guardiola A. Klin. Wochenschr. 1989; 67: 999-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). A defect of Sap B results in a variant form of metachromatic leukodystrophy with sulfatide accumulation in tissues(12.Wenger D.A. De Gala G. Williams C. Taylor H.A. Stevenson R.E. Pruitt J.R. Miller J. Garen P.D. Balentine J.D. Am. J. Med. Genet. 1989; 33: 255-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 13.Schlote W. Harzer K. Christomanou H. Paton B.C. Kustermann-Kuhn B. Schmid B.

The fact that the absence of one or another saposin causes different pathologies indicates that each saposin has distinct biological functions. When all four saposins are absent due to a genetic defect that prevents the synthesis of prosaposin(14.Schnabel D. Schröder M. Fürst W. Klein A. Hurwitz R. Zenk T. Weber J. Harzer K. Paton B.C. Poulos A. Suzuki K. Sandhoff K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3312-3315Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), accumulation of several sphingolipids has been observed in lysosomes with symptoms similar to those of Gaucher's and Farber's diseases (15.Bradova V. Smid F. Ulrich-Bott B. Roggendorf W. Paton B.C. Harzer K. Hum. Genet. 1993; 92: 143-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Several attempts have been made to elucidate the role of saposins in sphingolipid enzymatic degradation. Sap C was originally purified on the basis of its ability to activate the lysosomal enzyme glucosylceramidase in the presence of phosphatidylserine (PS)(16.Glew R.H. Basu A. La Marco K. Prence E. Lab. Invest. 1988; 58: 5-25PubMed Google Scholar). The enzyme activation was thought to be caused by a direct interaction of the saposin with the enzyme(16.Glew R.H. Basu A. La Marco K. Prence E. Lab. Invest. 1988; 58: 5-25PubMed Google Scholar, 17.Morimoto S. Kishimoto Y. Tomich J. Weiler S. Ohashi T. Barranger J.A. Kretz K.A. O'Brien J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1933-1937Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In previous studies, we reinvestigated the role of Sap C, and the use of model lipid membranes provided us information on the mechanism whereby glucosylceramidase is stimulated by Sap C and PS. We found that, in order to express its activity, glucosylceramidase must be bound to acidic phospholipid-containing membranes (18.Vaccaro A.M. Tatti M. Salvioli R. Ciaffoni F. Gallozzi E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1033: 73-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 19.Vaccaro A.M. Tatti M. Ciaffoni F. Salvioli R. Roncaioli P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1119: 239-246Crossref Scopus (10) Google Scholar) and that Sap C promoted the enzyme binding by interacting with the bilayer(20.Vaccaro A.M. Tatti M. Ciaffoni F. Salvioli R. Maras B. Barca A. FEBS Lett. 1993; 1: 159-162Crossref Scopus (45) Google Scholar). We next examined the effects of Sap C on the physical properties of PS bilayers and showed that the saposin induced destabilization at acidic pH values (21.Vaccaro A.M. Tatti M. Ciaffoni F. Salvioli R. Serafino A. Barca A. FEBS Lett. 1994; 349: 181-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The finding that the glucosylceramidase-stimulating ability of Sap C primarily depended on its interaction with acidic phospholipids prompted us to further investigate the mechanism of the saposin membrane action. In the present study, we examined 1) whether the pH-dependent binding of Sap C to PS-containing bilayers depended on a pH-dependent change of conformational state; 2) whether the other three saposins (A, B, and D), which possess similar structure, shared the Sap C ability to act on phospholipid membranes; and 3) whether a relation could be found between conformation of saposins, membrane binding, and bilayer perturbation. Finally, the specificity of Sap C in promoting the binding of glucosylceramidase to PS-containing membranes was evaluated. Phosphatidylcholine (PC) from egg yolk and PS from bovine brain were from Avanti Polar Lipids, Inc. (Alabaster, AL). Cholesterol and 4-methylumbelliferyl β-D-glucopyranoside (MUGlc) were from Sigma. Calcein was from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR). All other chemicals were of the purest available grade. Sap B, C, and D were purified from spleens of patients with Type 1 Gaucher's disease following a procedure previously reported(22.Sano A. Radin N.S. Johnson L.L. Tarr G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 19597-19601Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); it consisted of heat and acid treatment of a water homogenate, ion-exchange chromatography on DEAE-Sephacel, gel filtration on Sephadex G-75, and reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography on a protein C4 column (Vydac). Sap A, also from Gaucher's disease patients' spleens, was purified according to the procedure of Morimoto et al.(23.Morimoto S. Martin B.M. Yamamoto Y. Kretz K.A. O'Brien J.S. Kishimoto Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 3389-3393Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The purity of the final saposin preparations was verified by N-terminal sequence analysis, SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and Western blotting. Antibodies against Sap A, B, C, and D were raised in rabbits by injecting 200 μg of the individual saposins three times over a period of 2 months. Glucosylceramidase was purified from human placenta following the procedure described by Murray et al.(24.Murray G.J. Youle R.J. Gandy S.E. Zirzow G.C. Barranger J.A. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 147: 301-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). To measure the glucosylceramidase activity, the standard assay mixture contained the following (in a final volume of 0.2 ml): 0.1 M citrate, 0.2 M phosphate buffer, pH 5.6, 2.5 mM MUGlc, 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100, and 0.25% (w/v) sodium taurocholate. When the stimulatory capacity of saposins had to be evaluated, the enzyme assay mixture contained the following (in a final volume of 0.2 ml): buffer A at pH 5.0 (10 mM acetate, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA), 2.5 mM MUGlc, 10 ng of purified placental glucosylceramidase, 100 μg of PS-containing vesicles (see below), and 10 μg of saposin. The assay mixtures were incubated for 30 min at 37°C. The extent of reaction was estimated fluorometrically as described previously(19.Vaccaro A.M. Tatti M. Ciaffoni F. Salvioli R. Roncaioli P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1119: 239-246Crossref Scopus (10) Google Scholar). 1 unit of glucosylceramidase is defined as the amount of enzyme that hydrolyzes 1 nmol of MUGlc/h in the standard assay. The specific activity of the purified enzyme preparation, measured according to the standard assay, was ~3 × 106 nmol/h/mg. Large unilamellar vesicles (LUV) were prepared by filter exclusion using a high pressure extrusion apparatus (Lipex Biomembranes, Vancouver, Canada) as described previously(25.Mayer L.D. Hope M.J. Cullis P.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 858: 161-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (1576) Google Scholar, 26.Vaccaro A.M. Tatti M. Ciaffoni F. Salvioli R. Barca A. Roncaioli P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1149: 55-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In short, the dry lipids were dispersed by Vortex mixing in buffer B at pH 7.4 (2 mML-histidine, 2 mM TES, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA). The suspension was submitted to 10 cycles of freezing and thawing and then extruded 15 times through two stacked 0.1-μm pore size polycarbonate filters (Nucleopore Corp., Pleasanton, CA). Two kinds of LUV were prepared, one containing 25% cholesterol and 75% PC and the other containing 25% cholesterol, 55% PC, and 20% PS. The vesicle concentration was determined by phosphate analysis(27.Bartlett G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1959; 234: 466-468Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Triton X-114 was precondensed three times, and phase partitioning was carried out essentially as described by Bordier(28.Bordier C. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 1604-1607Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, each saposin (50 μg) was dissolved at 0°C into 200 μl of buffer solutions at different pH values containing 1% (w/v) Triton X-114 and overlaid on a cushion of 300 μl of the same buffer containing 6% (w/v) sucrose and 0.06% Triton X-114. Buffer A was used at pH 4-6, and buffer B at pH 7.4. The samples were incubated at 37°C for 5 min and then centrifuged at low speed. Aliquots of the upper aqueous phase and lower detergent phase were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting (see below). A discontinuous Tricine/SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis system was used with 16.5% acrylamide(29.Schagger H. Von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10505) Google Scholar). After electrophoresis, the saposins were electroblotted to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Bio-Rad) and detected with antibodies against each saposin using a Vectastain ABC kit (Vector Labs, Inc., Burlingame, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Antibodies raised against an individual saposin did not cross-react with the other three saposins. For binding studies, each saposin (40 μg) was incubated with LUV (100 μg) in 0.4 ml of buffer A adjusted to the desired pH values at 37°C for 10 min. The mixture was then centrifuged at 180,000 × g for 1 h. More than 95% of the vesicles were found in the pellet. The amount of saposin in the supernatant was determined measuring the protein content with the bicinchoninic acid method(30.Redinbaugh M.G. Turley R.B. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 153: 267-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). The amount of liposome-bound saposin at a given pH was expressed relative to the amount of protein in the supernatant centrifuged in the absence of liposomes. For glucosylceramidase binding studies, the enzyme (1000 units) was incubated at 37°C for 10 min with PS-containing LUV (200 μg), individual saposins (10 μg), and albumin (100 μg) in 0.4 ml of buffer A, pH 5.0, supplemented with 10 mM dithioerythritol. The mixture was then centrifuged at 130,000 × g for 1 h. The amount of glucosylceramidase in the supernatant was determined by measuring the enzyme activity according to the standard assay (see above). The amount of liposome-bound glucosylceramidase was expressed relative to the amount of enzyme in the supernatant centrifuged in the absence of saposins. Leakage of liposome contents was monitored by the release of calcein trapped inside the vesicles(31.Straubinger R.M. Hong K. Friend D.S. Papahadjopoulos D. Cell. 1983; 32: 1069-1079Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). LUV for leakage experiments were prepared by hydrating dried films of lipids in 60 mM calcein, pH 7.4, followed by 10 cycles of freeze-thawing. The resulting multilamellar vesicles were extruded 15 times through two stacked 0.1-μm pore size polycarbonate filters. Free calcein was separated from dye-containing LUV by chromatography on a Sephadex G-75 column. Upon addition of saposins, leakage of calcein to the external medium was followed by an increase in fluorescence caused by calcein dilution and the consequent relief of self-quenching (excitation at 470 nm and emission at 520 nm). 100% leakage was established by lysing the vesicles with 0.3% (v/v) Triton X-100. Leakage of liposomes was carried out at 37°C and monitored with a Fluoromax spectrofluorometer equipped with a constant temperature cell holder and stirrer (Spex Industries, Edison, NJ). We have recently shown that Sap C is able to bind to PS membranes at low pH(20.Vaccaro A.M. Tatti M. Ciaffoni F. Salvioli R. Maras B. Barca A. FEBS Lett. 1993; 1: 159-162Crossref Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Since an acid-induced conformational change that triggers an increased hydrophobicity has been demonstrated for several proteins as the first step in the penetration through membranes (32.Fricker L.D. Das B. Hogue Angeletti R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2476-2482Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33.Doms R.W. Helenius A. White J. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 2973-2981Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34.Escuyer V. Boquet P. Perrin D. Montecucco C. Mock M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 10891-10898Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35.Yoshimura T. Maezawa S. Hong K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1987; 101: 1265-1272Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), we have investigated whether a similar change occurred in Sap C. The property of Triton X-114 to separate into a detergent lower phase and an aqueous upper phase was exploited for obtaining information on the surface hydrophobicity of the saposin. Fig. 1 shows that, at neutral pH, Sap C was completely recovered in the aqueous phase, while at acidic pH, it moved into the detergent phase. The same experiments performed with the other three saposins showed that also Sap A and D separated into the lower detergent phase when the pH was decreased to 5.0 and below (Fig. 1). The partitioning of Sap A was not as clear-cut and complete as that of Sap C and D. In contrast to the other saposins, Sap B remained in the aqueous phase at all pH values examined (Fig. 1). These results indicate that acidic pH triggers the exposure of the hydrophobic domains of Sap A, C, and D. On consideration that, similarly to Sap C, the hydrophobicity of Sap A and D increases upon acidification, we investigated whether these two saposins shared the previously observed Sap C ability to associate with PS membranes at low pH(20.Vaccaro A.M. Tatti M. Ciaffoni F. Salvioli R. Maras B. Barca A. FEBS Lett. 1993; 1: 159-162Crossref Scopus (45) Google Scholar). To better approach physiological conditions, LUV composed of cholesterol, PC, and PS were used. To evaluate the importance of acidic phospholipids for saposin interactions, liposomes devoid of PS were also assayed. The binding of saposins to the two kinds of LUV was measured at different pH values; the results are presented in Fig. 2. All saposins failed to bind to the liposomes at pH 5.8. On lowering the pH, the amount of bound Sap C and D markedly increased, particularly in the presence of PS, while Sap A and B minimally interacted with the vesicles. The pH 5.0 threshold of Sap C and D binding was consistent with the pH threshold of the acid-induced conformational change of the two saposins (see Fig. 1). Under all examined experimental conditions, the extent of Sap C binding was higher than that of Sap D. At pH values lower than 5, Sap C was the only saposin completely bound to liposomes, both in the absence and presence of PS (Fig. 2). To ascertain whether the interaction with saposins altered the bilayer integrity, we measured the release of the fluorescent dye calcein encapsulated in LUV with or without PS in the presence of each saposin. Leakage was assessed at the acidic pH values that trigger the binding of saposins to the lipid surface. Fig. 3 shows that the leakage induced by saposins increased sharply when the pH was decreased and PS was present in the membrane. Sap C and D, which have a high affinity for phospholipid vesicles, were powerful destabilizing agents of PS-containing LUV, while Sap A and B minimally affected the bilayer integrity. At pH 4.5, >50% of the calcein was released in 100 s from PS-containing liposomes in the presence of either Sap C or D, while in the presence of Sap A and B, the amount of dye released dropped to <15%. It must be pointed out that, while Sap C was a more powerful destabilizing agent than Sap D in the absence of PS, the two saposins had comparable effects on PS-containing vesicles (Fig. 3). The extent of membrane destabilization depended on the amount of saposin C or D added (Fig. 4). At concentrations as low as 20 nM (protein/lipid molar ratio of 1:3750), the two saposins were still able to induce >40% leakage from PS-containing LUV after 100 s at pH 4.5. Two saposins (C and A) have been reported as having the ability to stimulate glucosylceramidase activity in vitro(1.O'Brien J. Kishimoto Y. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 301-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar, 2.Kishimoto Y. Hiraiwa M. O'Brien J.S. J. Lipid Res. 1992; 33: 1255-1267Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3.Fürst W.

We recently showed that the stimulation by Sap C is related to the saposin-promoted binding of the enzyme to PS-containing LUV (20.Vaccaro A.M. Tatti M. Ciaffoni F. Salvioli R. Maras B. Barca A. FEBS Lett. 1993; 1: 159-162Crossref Scopus (45) Google Scholar). To compare the effect of the four saposins on the binding of the enzyme to membranes, glucosylceramidase was centrifuged with liposomes in the presence of each saposin. Fig. 5 shows that Sap C was the only saposin able to promote the association of glucosylceramidase with PS-containing LUV. When liposomes without PS were used for the binding experiments, no interaction between glucosylceramidase and the bilayer took place also in the presence of Sap C (data not shown). The fact that Sap A was unable to promote enzyme binding prompted us to re-evaluate the capacity of Sap A to stimulate the enzyme activity in the presence of PS-containing LUV. Table 1 shows that while Sap C markedly increased the enzyme activity, Sap A, B, and D had no effect on glucosylceramidase under our experimental conditions.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab Saposins presumably exert their biological activities in lysosomes (1.O'Brien J.

Biochem. 1986; 55: 663-700Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 37.Bohley P. Seglen P.O. Experientia (Basel). 1992; 48: 151-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). By studying the partitioning of these proteins between aqueous and detergent (Triton X-114) phases, we have presently found that a low pH induces changes in the hydrophobicity of Sap A, C, and D. In contrast, an acidic environment does not affect the apparent hydrophilicity of Sap B, which, also at pH 4.0, segregates into the aqueous phase. The observation that mildly acidic conditions mimicking the interior pH of lysosomes promote an increase in the superficial hydrophobicity of saposins A, C, and D suggests that this mechanism might be relevant to their mode of action. The induction of hydrophobic properties by low pH values has been observed for several proteins. This is the salient characteristic of carboxypeptidase E(32.Fricker L.D. Das B. Hogue Angeletti R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2476-2482Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), influenza virus hemagglutinin(33.Doms R.W. Helenius A. White J. J. Biol.

Chem. 1986; 261: 10891-10898Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and clathrin(35.Yoshimura T. Maezawa S. Hong K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1987; 101: 1265-1272Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). These proteins at low pH undergo conformational changes that cause protein-membrane interaction and consequent perturbation of the bilayer. The pH-triggered increases in the hydrophobicity of Sap C and D clearly correlated with their binding to vesicles composed of cholesterol and phospholipids, the predominant lipids in biological membranes. Of the four saposins, Sap C shows the highest affinity for phospholipid membranes. Its binding to PS vesicles at low pH had been previously assessed(20.Vaccaro A.M. Tatti M. Ciaffoni F. Salvioli R. Maras B. Barca A. FEBS Lett. 1993; 1: 159-162Crossref Scopus (45) Google Scholar). We have now found that, although the presence of an acidic phospholipid such as PS has a positive effect, Sap C can also associate with neutral phospholipid-containing vesicles. The binding properties of Sap C are consistent with the fact that Sap C is localized, at least in part, on the lysosomal membrane(9.Paton B.C. Hughes J.L. Harzer K. Poulos A. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 51: 157-164Google Scholar), where high levels of phospholipids are present(38.Holtzman E. Lysosomes. Plenum Press, New York1989Crossref Google Scholar). In contrast with Sap C and D, Sap A and B show a poor binding efficiency for phospholipid vesicles. For Sap B, this finding is consistent with its apparent hydrophilicity both at neutral and acidic pH. The lack of interaction of Sap A with phospholipid membranes, in spite of its increased hydrophobicity at low pH, might be explained by the higher carbohydrate content of this saposin. In fact, two oligosaccharide side chains are present in the Sap A molecule instead of one as in the other saposins(23.Morimoto S. Martin B.M. Yamamoto Y. Kretz K.A. O'Brien J.S. Kishimoto Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 3389-3393Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The pH-dependent binding of saposins C and D to liposomes dramatically affects the integrity of the phospholipid bilayer. The membrane destabilization is favored by the same conditions that promote the binding of the two saposins, namely the presence of PS and acidic pH. Sap A and B, which poorly interact with phospholipid vesicles, have a minimal effect on the permeability of the bilayers. Although these results suggest that saposin-induced destabilization involves saposin binding, other factors also appear to influence the rate of leakage from the liposomes. Sap C, which is completely bound to PS-containing liposomes both at pH 4.0 and 5.0, induces a very rapid calcein release at pH 4.0, but not at pH 5.0 (see Fig. 2, Fig. 3). Most likely, the degree of Sap C embedding into the bilayer is different at the two pH values. According to Papahadjopoulos et al.(39.Papahadjopoulos D. Moscarello M. Eylar E.H. Isac T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1975; 401: 317-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar), the simple binding of proteins to the surface of lipid bilayers without penetration has minimal effects on membrane permeability, while the surface binding of proteins followed by their penetration into the bilayers results in a large increase in the permeability of the membranes. It is well known that Sap C is required by glucosylceramidase to fully express its activity(16.Glew R.H. Basu A. La Marco K. Prence E. Lab. Invest. 1988; 58: 5-25PubMed Google Scholar). We have recently found that the Sap C requirement is related to the saposin ability to mediate the interaction between glucosylceramidase and PS-containing liposomes (20.Vaccaro A.M. Tatti M. Ciaffoni F. Salvioli R. Maras B. Barca A. FEBS Lett. 1993; 1: 159-162Crossref Scopus (45) Google Scholar). By comparing the effects of the four saposins, we have now found that Sap C is the only saposin able to promote the association of the enzyme with the lipid surface. Sap A, which has been also reported as a glucosylceramidase activator(23.Morimoto S. Martin B.M. Yamamoto Y. Kretz K.A. O'Brien J.S. Kishimoto Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 3389-3393Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), has no effect on the enzyme binding and, under our experimental conditions (Table 1), on the enzyme activity. The specificity of Sap C may depend on either a specific Sap C-induced perturbation of the bilayer or/and a specific interaction between Sap C and glucosylceramidase consequent to a saposin conformational change after insertion into the bilayer. Based on the present findings, we speculate that the exposure to the low lysosomal pH triggers a change necessary for Sap C to penetrate into acidic phospholipid-containing membranes, perturb the lipid organization, and finally promote the binding and activation of glucosylceramidase. According to this hypothesis, Sap C might play a major role in favoring the association of glucosylceramidase with the lysosomal membrane. Recently, it was found that Sap D stimulates the lysosomal enzymatic degradation of ceramide(40.Klein A. Henseler M. Klein C. Suzuki K. Harzer K. Sandhoff K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 200: 1440-1448Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). It was proposed that the stimulation of acid ceramidase activity by Sap D depends on the direct association of the saposin with the enzyme and not with the lipid substrate(41.Azuma N. O'Brien J.S. Moser H.W. Kishimoto Y. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 311: 354-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Our present results provide the first experimental evidence that Sap D has the capacity to bind to PS-containing vesicles and perturb the bilayer. It would be of interest to investigate if the pH-dependent destabilizing activity of Sap D directly or indirectly affects the lysosomal ceramide degradation. Presumably, saposins play several critical roles in lysosomes. A well documented function is that of stimulating the lysosomal degradation of sphingolipids(1.O'Brien J. Kishimoto Y. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 301-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar, 2.Kishimoto Y. Hiraiwa M. O'Brien J.S. J. Lipid Res. 1992; 33: 1255-1267Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3.Fürst W.

The Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease. McGraw-Hill Book Co., New York1995: 2427-2441Google Scholar). In addition, it has been reported by Hiraiwa et al.(42.Hiraiwa M. Soeda S. Kishimoto Y. O'Brien J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11254-11258Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) that all four saposins and also their precursor, prosaposin, form high affinity complexes with gangliosides and transport them from one membrane to the other. This finding prompted the authors to propose that prosaposin and saposins might serve in vivo as transport proteins for gangliosides. Our present results showing that saposins C and D possess a potentiality to modify the phospholipid assembly at low pH values suggest that, independently of the presence of sphingolipids, these two saposins might have a further role in the organization of lysosomal and intralysosomal membranes. When all saposins are absent for a genetic defect in the start codon of the prosaposin gene(14.Schnabel D. Schröder M. Fürst W. Klein A. Hurwitz R. Zenk T. Weber J. Harzer K. Paton B.C. Poulos A. Suzuki K. Sandhoff K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3312-3315Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the accumulation of intralysosomal vesicles has been observed(43.Harzer K. Paton B.C. Poulos A. Kustermann-Kuhn B. Roggendorf W. Grisar T. Popp M. Eur. J. Pediatr. 1989; 149: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). This finding suggested that saposins are essential for the degradation of intralysosomal vesicles(4.Sandhoff K. Harzer K. Fürst W. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease. McGraw-Hill Book Co., New York1995: 2427-2441Google Scholar); it is conceivable that the pH-dependent membrane-destabilizing activities of Sap C and D are relevant in this lysosomal process.

Progesterone plays a major role in mammalian reproductive biology, including development of the normal mammary gland and expression of its differentiated function during pregnancy, and promotion of uterine differentiation and preparation for implantation in pregnancy(1.Clarke C.L. Sutherland R.L. Endocr. Rev. 1990; 11: 266-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar). Progesterone effects are mediated via the nuclear progesterone receptor (PR) 1The abbreviations used are: PRprogesterone receptorE2estradiolERestrogen receptorCHOChinese hamster ovaryDMEMDulbecco's modified Eagle's mediumSFCScharcoal-stripped fetal calf serumPRLRprolactin receptor. and control of progesterone action is achieved largely although not exclusively by control of the concentration of PR.

Understanding of PR regulation derives largely from detailed and elegant studies in the mammalian uterus and in breast cancer cells, which led to the generally accepted view that estrogen increases and progestins decrease PR expression(2.Horwitz K.B. Endocr. Rev. 1992; 13: 146-163PubMed Google Scholar, 3.Clarke C.L. Rice G.E. Brennecke S.P. Molecular Aspects of Placental and Fetal Membrane Autacoids.

However, the advent of monoclonal antibodies to the steroid hormone receptors and the examination of PR expression at an individual cell level have shown that PR regulation may be more complex than previously suspected. Regulation of PR in the uterus is a cell-specific event, and PR regulation in the normal breast in vivo may be different from its regulation in the uterus and in breast cancer cells. In the endometrium, immunohistochemical evidence supports the view that the cyclical effects of estrogen and progesterone are mediated by estrogen stimulation of PR and progesterone down-regulation of both PR and estrogen receptor (ER)(4.Garcia E.

However, progesterone down-regulation of PR is not a uniform effect in the uterus, as myometrial and stromal PR levels are not decreased by progesterone and persist during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle(4.Garcia E.

Furthermore, circulating progestins cause a decrease in ER concentration in the normal breast during the menstrual cycle, as observed in the endometrium, but no decrease of PR(8.Markopoulos C.

It is possible that differences in the regulation of PR by estrogen and progestins in the breast and endometrium reflect the differential requirement for persistence of progesterone action in those tissues (1.Clarke C.L. Sutherland R.L. Endocr. Rev. 1990; 11: 266-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar) and may be a consequence of expression of distinct PR isoforms. The complexity of PR regulation in vivo is paralleled by evidence of complexity in the molecular mechanisms underlying PR expression. The expression of human PR is controlled by two promoters that direct the synthesis of mRNA transcripts originating from two clusters of transcription start sites and coding for the A and B PR proteins(12.Kastner P. Krust A. Turcotte B. Stropp U. Tora L. Gronemeyer H. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1603-1614Crossref PubMed Scopus (1339) Google Scholar). The functional activities of PR A and B differ in a cell type-, promoter-, or ligand-specific manner(13.Tora L. Gronemeyer H. Turcotte B. Gaub M.P. Chambon P.

PR A and B also differ in their ability to inhibit the activity of ER, in a way that is both promoter- and cell type-specific(19.Wen D.X. Xu Y.F. Mais D.E. Goldman M.E. McDonnell D.P. Mol. Cell.

The functional implications of N-terminal isoforms are not restricted to PR; androgen receptor mRNA isoforms differing within the region coding for the N-terminal portion of the protein have been described which are either developmentally regulated or are expressed in differentiated tissues in Xenopus laevis(23.Fischer L. Catz D. Kelley D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8254-8258Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar).

Misrahi M. Rauch C. Redeuilh G. Chauchereau A. Milgrom E. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1875-1883Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). An estrogen-responsive element has been defined in this region, which binds to ER in gel shifts and mediates E2 induction in transfections. However, PR does not bind to this region even though it suppresses E2 induction in the presence of the progestin R5020(35.Savouret J.F. Rauch M. Redeuilh G. Sar S. Chauchereau A. Woodruff K. Parker M.G. Milgrom E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28955-28962Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Given the complexity of human PR regulation in target tissues in vivo and the complexity of regulation of PR gene expression via its two promoters, as well as the emerging evidence of marked functional differences in PR A and B activity, it is essential to gain a deeper insight into the mechanisms that control the regulation of PR by its major physiological modulators, estrogens and progestins. It is not known whether these steroids exert equivalent effects on the two PR promoters and lead to equivalent alterations in the levels of PR A and B proteins in progestin target cells, or whether progestin abrogation of estrogen stimulation of PR expression is mediated via the same mechanism. This question is critical to understanding the in vivo complexity of PR expression and regulation in the breast and endometrium. This study addresses the PR isoform specificity of the actions of estrogen and progestin in human breast cancer cells, which are physiological targets of estrogen and progestin action.

The hPR(+814,+1194)-pGEM construct was made in a similar manner using a Sau3AI fragment excised from pSG5-hPR1. Both constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. Non-overlapping probes were constructed due to the multiplicity of transcripts of similar sizes arising from both promoters observed when a single probe was employed in S1 nuclease protection assays (not shown).

RNA was isolated by the guanidinium isothiocyanate-cesium chloride method as described for total RNA. PR gene transcription was measured using modifications of the method of Greenberg and Ziff (45.Greenberg M.E. Ziff E.B.

Labeled run-on transcripts were hybridized to nitrocellulose filters onto which 5 μg each in duplicate of pSG5-hPR1, PRLR, α-tubulin, and pUC12 cDNAs had been blotted and fixed by UV radiation. Volumes of labeled transcripts were chosen such that each sample per time point contained equal radioactivity. Filters were washed(45.Greenberg M.E. Ziff E.B. Nature. 1984; 311: 433-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (2009) Google Scholar), dried, and exposed to x-ray film. Autoradiograms were analyzed densitometrically, and the mean heights of duplicate PR RNA signals on filters bearing treated samples were normalized for the mean heights of the duplicate α-tubulin signals on the same filter then expressed as a percentage of the similarly normalized PR RNA signal on control filters. T-47D cells were plated into 150-cm2 flasks (2.5-3.0 × 106 cells/flask) in RPMI 1640 phenol red-free medium containing 5% FCS 3 days prior to transfection.

Where indicated pMSG-CAT (40 μg/flask) and pCH110 (10-20 μg/flask) were co-transfected into separate flasks of T-47D cells. T-47D and CHO cells were subjected to osmotic shock 3-4 h after transfection, and exposure of T-47D cells to the DNA continued for 18 h thereafter as described(46.Clarke C.L. Graham J. Roman S.D. Sutherland R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18969-18975Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereupon transfected T-47D cells were harvested from the 150-cm2 flasks and replated (1 × 106 cells/flask) into triplicate 25-cm2 flasks for treatment. DNA precipitates were removed from CHO cells after osmotic shock and from HeLa cells after 4 h. Triplicate 25-cm2 flasks of transfected cells were treated, harvested, and enzyme activities measured as described previously(46.Clarke C.L. Graham J. Roman S.D. Sutherland R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18969-18975Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The hPR(+464,+742)-pGEM construct, which hybridizes to PR B promoter initiated transcripts only, and hPR(+814,+1194)-pGEM, which detects all PR mRNA species, were linearized at the 5′ end of each insert using EcoRI. Antisense RNA probes were synthesized from 1 μg of each linearized template with SP6 RNA polymerase in the presence of [α-32P]UTP using a Riboprobe Gemini II kit (Promega Corp., Ryde, Australia). The control probe 36B4 (40.Daly R.J. Darbre P.D. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 5868-5875PubMed Google Scholar) was prepared by transcription from HindIII-linearized template using T7 RNA polymerase. After transcription, the DNA templates were digested using RQI DNase I (Promega Corp) and probes were purified by phenol-chloroform extraction and ammonium acetate precipitation to remove unincorporated nucleotides. T-47Dsd cells were plated as described in the legend to Fig. 5 and treated for various times with steroids or vehicle then harvested for preparation of nuclear RNA. The S1 nuclease protection assay was carried out essentially as described previously(48.Tilley W.D. Wilson C.M. Marcelli M. McPhaul M.J. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 5382-5386PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 5 × 105 cpm PR-B promoter-specific or PR total mRNA probe plus 2 × 105 cpm 36B4 control probe were co-precipitated with 20 μg of nuclear RNA, rinsed with ethanol, and dried under vacuum. The samples were redissolved in hybridization buffer, denatured at 80°C for 5 min, and then incubated overnight at 52°C. After hybridization samples were treated with 4000 units of S1 nuclease for 1 h at 42°C. Digestion was stopped, and samples were purified by phenol-chloroform extraction, followed by two rounds of ammonium acetate precipitation. Final precipitates were dried under vacuum and resuspended in 10 μl of loading buffer containing 90% formamide, then separated on 10% polyacrylamide gels containing 8 M urea and visualized by autoradiography. PR mRNA concentrations were estimated by densitometric analysis and corrected for loading using 36B4. T-47Dsd cells were harvested, after treatment for 24 h with E2 (0.001-10 nM) or vehicle, and stored as described(26.Alexander I.E. Clarke C.L. Shine J. Sutherland R.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1989; 3: 1377-1386Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), then thawed on ice in PEMTG buffer (26.Alexander I.E. Clarke C.L. Shine J. Sutherland R.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1989; 3: 1377-1386Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) containing 0.4 M KCl and a protease inhibitor mixture, which resulted in the indicated final concentrations of the inhibitors (all obtained from Sigma): phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (0.5 mM), pepstatin A (1.4 μM), bacitracin (100 μg/ml), benzamidine (25 mM), leupeptin (86 μM), and aprotinin (77 μg/ml). Cytosol extracts were prepared and transferred to nitrocellulose as described(26.Alexander I.E. Clarke C.L. Shine J. Sutherland R.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1989; 3: 1377-1386Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), except that the blocking buffer also contained 5% (w/v) skim milk. Blots were incubated with monoclonal antibodies against human PR (hPRa 6 and 7, (49.Clarke C.L. Zaino R.J. Feil P.D. Miller J.V. Steck M.E. Ohlsson-Wilhelm B.M. Satyaswaroop P.G.

The relative intensity, in the linear range of the film, of the immunoreactive bands was calculated after densitometric scanning of x-ray films, followed by integration of the areas under the peaks corresponding to PR A and B. Results are expressed as the percentage of the immunoreactivity in control samples. Nuclear run-on transcription assays included both positive (tubulin) and negative (pUC) controls as well as a control gene (prolactin receptor, PRLR) whose regulation by estrogen and progestins was known to be different from PR; PRLR expression is stimulated by progestins but unaffected by estrogen in T-47D cells(37.Ormandy C.J. Graham J. Kelly P.A. Clarke C.L. Sutherland R.L. DNA Cell Biol. 1992; 11: 721-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Initial experiments focussed on a detailed analysis of the time course of PR transcription rate inhibition by the synthetic progestin ORG 2058. The transcription rate of the PR gene was markedly decreased upon short term progestin exposure (Fig. 1), as previously shown (26.Alexander I.E. Clarke C.L. Shine J. Sutherland R.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1989; 3: 1377-1386Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). There was an apparent small increase in basal transcription rate over time, as evidenced by the increased transcription rate of PR, PRLR, and tubulin (Fig. 1, vehicle-treated samples). This is probably due to two factors: culture conditions and nuclear run-on experimental design. Cells underwent a change to medium containing stripped fetal calf serum 24 h prior to treatment and for PR at least this leads to a slow increase in basal expression over time.( 2E. McGowan and C. L. Clarke, unpublished observations.) In addition, although run-on samples were normalized to contain the same radioactivity within each time point, there were some differences between time points; the 9-h and 28-h time points in particular contained more radioactivity than the 1-h and 3-h points. Nevertheless, as transcription rate was determined by normalization to the tubulin signal within each time point, these factors did not affect the overall results. A detailed analysis of the long term effects of the progestin on PR transcription rate revealed that inhibition of >60% was apparent within 1 h, had reached 72% at 9 h of treatment (Fig. 1), and was sustained to 28 h. Exposure to estradiol significantly increased PR transcription rate (171 ± 24% (mean ± S.D.), n = 3, p = 0.007, Fig. 2), and this effect was detectable within 1 h of treatment. Progestin was able to abrogate the estradiol-mediated increase in PR transcription rate to levels that were below control (56 ± 38% (mean ± range), n = 2) but not as low as progestin treatment alone (25 ± 3% (mean ± S.D.), n = 3) (Fig. 2). Having shown that estrogen increased PR transcription rate and that progestin caused a prolonged inhibition of PR gene transcription and abrogated the stimulatory estradiol effect, it was important to investigate whether these transcriptional effects were equally mediated via the two PR promoter regions. PR-B (−711/+31) and PR-A (+464/+1105) promoters in minimal pBLCAT vectors were transiently expressed in T-47D cells, and the effects of estradiol, ORG 2058, and their combination on repor"

Herein, we report on the identification and characterization of several conformationally restricted retinoids, which selectively bind and activate RX receptors. Under the influence of retinoids, HL-60 myelocytic leukemia cells differentiate into granulocytes. This effect is mediated by RARα, as has been demonstrated through the use of a selective RARα antagonist (Apfel, C., Bauer, F., Crettaz, M., Forni, L., Kamber, M., Kaufmann, F., LeMotte, P., Pirson, W., and Klaus, M.(1992) Proc.

Here, we show that conformationally restricted RXR-specific retinoids, at doses that are per se inactive, are able to potentiate by up to one order of magnitude the pro-differentiating effects of all-trans retinoic acid and an RARα-selective synthetic retinoid. We also present evidence that these RXR-selective ligands are able to bind to a DNA RXR•RAR heterodimer complex. This finding demonstrates that agonists for RARs and RXRs can synergistically promote HL-60 differentiation, which could be mediated through a heterodimer of these receptors.

In view of the involvement of RXRs in multiple signaling pathways, RXR-selective ligands can possibly be expected to show medical usefulness through their modulation of the above mentioned and perhaps also other hormone-regulated processes. The pharmacological effects of RXR ligands, which are attributable solely to activity on RXRs, are difficult to assess using 9-cis RA as an activating ligand since 9-cis RA also functions as an RAR ligand and consequently elicits the full range of classical retinoid effects. Therefore, to gain deeper insight into RXR function as well as to evaluate their pharmacological usefulness, we have designed and characterized a number of RXR-selective compounds and report on some intriguing pharmacological properties. These compounds are sterically restricted analogues of 9-cis RA, which cannot isomerize. They exhibit high potency and high selectivity for RXRs versus RARs and belong to different structural classes than other RXR-selective compounds recently reported(22.Lehmann J.M. Jong L. Fanjul A.

HL-60 is a human myeloid leukemia cell line, which is exquisitely sensitive to retinoid-induced differentiation(25.Breitman T.R. Selonick S.E. Collins S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 2936-2940Crossref PubMed Scopus (1864) Google Scholar). The predominant expression of RARα in these cells suggests that retinoids act through this receptor(26.Largman C. Detmer K. Corral J.C. Hack F.M. Lawrence H.J. Blood. 1989; 74: 99-102Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27.Nervi C. Grippo J.F. Sherman M.I. George M.D. Jetten A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 5854-5858Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). We have recently found additional evidence supporting this assumption by the use of an RARα-selective antagonist, which was able to suppress retinoid-induced differentiation (1.Apfel C. Bauer F. Crettaz M. Forni L. Kamber M. Kaufmann F. LeMotte P. Pirson W. Klaus M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7129-7133Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Therefore, we have used HL-60 as a model system to evaluate the role of RXR in RARα-mediated biological responses. We now show that these new RXR-selective agonists synergistically enhance the differentiation of HL-60 cells induced by all-trans RA or an RARα-selective retinoid. t-RA and analogues were synthesized at F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd. (Basel). 3H-t-RA (50 Ci/mmol) was obtained from DuPont NEN, and 3H-9-cis RA (22 Ci/mmol) was synthesized at F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd. (Basel). The structures of the retinoids presented in this paper are given in Table 1. Retinoids were dissolved in Me2SO as 10 mM stock solutions and kept at −80°C. Some retinoids were unstable upon storage, and new solutions were prepared for each experiment. All retinoids were handled under dimmed light or in the dark.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab For competition binding, we used Escherichia coli expressed RARs (DEF domains) or RARα (full-length). The binding experiments were performed as described in detail previously(1.Apfel C. Bauer F. Crettaz M. Forni L. Kamber M. Kaufmann F. LeMotte P. Pirson W. Klaus M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7129-7133Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 28.Apfel C. Crettaz M. LeMotte P. Morriss-Kay G. Retinoids in Normal Development and Teratogenesis.

Briefly, aliquots of receptors (crude extract) were incubated at room temperature with binding buffer containing 3H-t-RA and increasing concentrations of unlabeled competing ligand. Bound t-RA was then separated from free ligand by charcoal/dextran extraction. Human RXRα in pSG5 (5.Levin A.A. Sturzenbecker L.J. Kazmer S. Bosakowski T. Huselton C. Allenby G. Speck J. Kratzeisen C. Rosenberger M. Lovey A. Grippo J.F. Nature. 1992; 355: 359-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (1103) Google Scholar) was provided by L. Sturzenbecker (Hoffmann-La Roche Inc., Nutley, NJ). The cDNA was subcloned in the E. coli expression vector pET3a(29.Studier F.W. Moffatt B.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 189: 113-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (4842) Google Scholar). Receptors were expressed and solubilized as described earlier(1.Apfel C. Bauer F. Crettaz M. Forni L. Kamber M. Kaufmann F. LeMotte P. Pirson W. Klaus M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7129-7133Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Aliquots thereof (0.2-0.4 pmol receptor) were used to measure competitive binding. The crude extracts were incubated in glass microtubes in 0.2 ml of binding buffer (10% glycerol, 0.8 M KCl, 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1.5 mM EDTA, 2 mM dithiothreitol, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, trypsin inhibitor (1 μg/ml), aprotinin (100 trypsin inhibitor units/ml)), 20 nM3H-9-cis RA, and increasing concentrations of unlabeled competing ligand. After a 3-h incubation period at 4°C, the bound radioligand was separated from free radioligand by using NAP-5 desalting columns (Pharmacia), and the radioactivity in the eluates was quantified by liquid scintillation counting. Retinoid binding assays were performed under equilibrium conditions. Two to four competition experiments were performed with each compound. Results from different experiments varied by a factor of less than 2. Binding parameters were calculated from competition curves using the Equilibrium Binding Data Analysis computer program from Biosoft. RARα and RXRα were expressed in E. coli (see binding assay). Biotinylated oligonucleotides containing the βRARE were synthesized (see retardation assay). 15 ng of receptor crude lysates (RAR and RXR) and 20 ng of biotinylated βRARE were incubated in RXR binding buffer for 30 min on ice. 3H-t-RA, (20 nM) 3H-9-cis RA (20 nM), or 3H-9-cis RA (20 nM) plus Ro 13-7410 (1000 nM) were added and incubated for 30 min on ice. Competition was measured by incubation with a 100-fold molar excess of the unlabeled ligands. After a 3-h incubation period on ice, bound radioligand was separated from free radioligand by gel filtration (see binding assay). The DNA complex of half of the eluate was precipitated with 30 μl of streptavidin-agarose (Sigma, S-1638) and washed two times with column buffer; the bound ligand was then quantitated. For the second half of the eluate, the bound ligand was also quantitated. We found no difference in % competition in solution or upon DNA precipitation (data not shown). The results represent mean values of duplicates and are representative of more than two independent experiments. The data are presented as % competition, where 9-cis competition is defined as 100% and the control as 0%. The latter values correspond to 4-20 fmol of bound ligand, while after competition these values were at least 10-fold lower. Chimeric RAR cDNAs (RARα-ER.CAS or RARβ-ER.CAS) were generously provided by Prof. Dr. P. Chambon (Faculté de Médecine, Strasbourg, France)(7.Petkovich M. Brand N.J. Krust A. Chambon P.

For the construction of the corresponding RAR γ-ER chimeric receptor see Apfel et al.(1.Apfel C. Bauer F. Crettaz M. Forni L. Kamber M. Kaufmann F. LeMotte P. Pirson W. Klaus M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7129-7133Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Through the use of chimeric receptors (the DNA binding region of the estrogen receptor replacing the DNA binding region of the RARs), which recognize an estrogen response element in transcription activation assays, any background induction due to endogenous retinoic acid receptors is avoided, and so it is possible to determine the activating capacity of a retinoid on a single RAR receptor. As a reporter system, we used the SeAP (secreted alkaline phosphatase) gene (31.Berger J. Hauber J. Hauber R. Geiger R. Cullen B.R. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 66: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar) under the control of the vitellogenin estrogen response element fused to the herpes simplex thymidine kinase promoter (vit-TK-SeAP). COS 1 cells were transiently transfected by the DEAE-dextran method(32.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar), using 4-20 μg of total plasmid DNA (RAR-ER expression vector, vit-TK-SeAP reporter = 1:5) per 10-cm dish(1.Apfel C. Bauer F. Crettaz M. Forni L. Kamber M. Kaufmann F. LeMotte P. Pirson W. Klaus M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7129-7133Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). After 18 h, the cells were trypsinized and replated on 96-well plates. 4 h later, various concentrations of retinoids were added to duplicate wells. At the end of incubation (36-48 h), the cell culture supernatants were assayed for SeAP activity. An RAR/RXR reporter gene was constructed using a synthetic oligonucleotide containing three copies of the RAR response element from the RARβ promoter (33.de Thé H. Vivanco-Ruiz M.D.M. Tiollais P. Stunnenberg H. Dejaen A. Nature. 1990; 343: 111-180Crossref Scopus (846) Google Scholar) in front of the basal promoter of TK and the luciferase coding region in the plasmid pGL2-basic (Promega) βRARE-TK-luc. COS-1 cells were transiently transfected as described above, and at the end of incubation the cells were assayed for luciferase activity. For transfection experiments in Drosophila cells (Schneider SL3), human RXRα was expressed using the Drosophila β-actin promoter(34.Bond B.J. Davidson N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 2080-2088Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Two RXR reporter systems were constructed using synthetic oligonucleotides, one containing three copies of the RXR response element from the rat CRBP II gene (35.Mangelsdorf D.J. Umesono K. Kliewer S.A. Borgmeyer U. Ong E.S. Evans R.M. Cell. 1991; 66: 555-561Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar) or the other containing three copies of the RARE response element from the βRAR gene, each with the alcohol dehydrogenase gene promoter (2.Mangelsdorf D.J. Ong E.S. Dyck J.A. Evans R.M. Nature. 1990; 345: 224-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (1258) Google Scholar) cloned in front of the luciferase coding region in the plasmid pGL2-basic (Promega). The transfection was performed by the calcium phosphate-DNA coprecipitation method(32.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar), using 5 μg of total plasmid DNA (RXRE reporter, RXRα expression vector = 1:10) per well of a 6-well dish in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 15% FCS. 18 h later, the cells were replated on 96-well plates, and 3-4 h later, various concentrations of retinoids were added to duplicate wells. At the end of incubation (36-48 h), the cells were assayed for luciferase activity. The SeAP assays were performed as described in detail previously(1.Apfel C. Bauer F. Crettaz M. Forni L. Kamber M. Kaufmann F. LeMotte P. Pirson W. Klaus M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7129-7133Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). For the luciferase assay the medium was aspirated, and 40 μl of lysis buffer was added (25 mM Tris-phosphate, pH 7.8, 2 mM dithiothreitol, 2 mM CDTA, 10% glycerol, and 1% Triton X-100). After 15 min incubation at room temperature, 20 μl were transferred into a 96-well plate, and the reaction was triggered by adding 100 μl of luciferin buffer (270 μM CoA, 470 μMD-luciferin, 530 μM ATP, 20 mM tricine, 1.07 mM Mg(CO3), 2.67 mM MgSO4, 0.1 mM EDTA, 33.3 mM dithiothreitol, adjusted pH 7.8). The luminescent reaction products were measured in a 96-well luminometer (Luminoscan, Flow). Transcription activation is expressed as percent receptor activation, with 100% representing the activity observed with RARs in the presence of 10−6M t-RA (3-8-fold induction) and 100% defining the RXRα activity observed in the presence of 10−6M 9-cis RA respectively (CRBP II, 10-15-fold induction: βRARE, 100-500-fold induction). Duplicate values varied by 5-10%. Two to four dose-response experiments were performed. The retinoid concentration giving half-maximal effect in transactivation (EC50) was determined from the plots. Reproducibility was found to be within a factor of 2. Oligonucleotides corresponding to the rat cytoplasmic retinol binding protein RARE (CRBP II, 5′-gatcCAGGTCACAGGTCACAGGTCACAGTTCAA-3′), to the RARβ2 gene promoter RARE (βRARE, 5′-gatcGTAGGGTTCACCGAAAGTTCACTC-3′) as well as to the vitellogenin gene estrogen response element (5′-gatcTCAGGTCACAGTGACCTGA-3′) were obtained synthetically. Human RXRα in pSG5 was linearized using BglII, and the template was transcribed with T7 RNA polymerase (MEGAscript kit, Ambion). Purified mRNA was in vitro translated using rabbit reticulocyte lysates according to Promega's instructions using a complete amino acid mixture. The gel retardation assay was performed as described previously in detail(36.Keidel S. LeMotte P. Apfel C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 287-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Retinoid-induced differentiation of HL-60 cells was assayed by measuring their oxidative burst potential via the reduction of nitro blue tetrazolium (NBT)(37.Pick E. Charon J. Mizel D. J. Reticuloendothel. Soc. 1981; 30: 581-593PubMed Google Scholar). HL-60 cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium (Seromed, Munich) supplemented with 10% FCS, 2 mML-glutamine, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 1% non-essential amino acids, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin (RPMI/FCS). 30,000 cells/100 μl of RPMI/FCS were seeded into flat-bottomed microtiter wells. 10 μl of retinoids diluted in complete medium were added at the same time to yield final concentrations. After 72 h, the medium was removed and replaced with 100 μl of NBT solution (1 mg/ml in phosphate-buffered saline with 200 nM phorbol myristate acetate). Following an additional 1-h incubation at 37°C, the NBT solution was removed, and 100 μl of 10% SDS in 0.01 N HCl was added. The amount of the reduced NBT was quantified photometrically at 540 nm using an automated plate reader. The mean of 3 wells was calculated. S.E. were between 5 and 10%. The chemical structures of the retinoids used in this study are listed in Table 1, including 9-cis RA, t-RA, and three synthetic compounds exhibiting high RXR selectivity. As can be seen from the structures, our strategy in designing RXR-selective ligands focused on the synthesis of retinoids with restricted rotational freedom by fixing the polyene side chain into a 9-cis-like configuration. This goal has successfully been achieved by embedding the C(9)-C(10) double bond into a ring. In addition, this prevents an easy thermal or light-induced isomerization. To determine the activity of these compounds toward RXRs and RARs we have measured their binding to the receptors in competition binding assays. Fig. 1A shows competitive binding on RXRα using 3H-9-cis RA as tracer. Ro 48-2250 and Ro 47-8652 compete nearly as well as unlabeled 9-cis RA for binding to RXRα, whereas Ro 47-5944 is severalfold less potent. In contrast, t-RA and Ro 40-6055 (Table 1) exhibit virtually no binding to RXRα. On RARα, the three synthetic compounds show only marginally detectable binding in a competition assay with 3H-t-RA as tracer, while t-RA and 9-cis RA exhibit potent binding (Fig. 1B). To test the ability of these compounds to transactivate receptor-responsive promoters, we used Drosophila SL3 cells as a cellular system. It has been shown in the literature that the RARE of the rat cytoplasmic retinol binding protein gene (CRBP II) is only activated by RXR homodimers while the RARE of the βRAR gene is activated by RAR-RXR heterodimers as well as by RXR homodimers(20.Zhang X.K. Lehmann J. Hoffmann B. Dawson M.I. Cameron J. Graupner G. Hermann T. Tran P. Pfahl M. Nature. 1992; 358: 587-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar). Only after cotransfection of the RXRα expression vector and different reporter constructs (CRBP II-adh-luciferase or βRARE-adh-luciferase) does 9-cis RA show a dose-dependent activation of the reporter gene (Fig. 2, A and B). All three compounds showed good activity, being nearly as active as 9-cis RA on both response elements. Using a palindromic thyroid hormone response element-luciferase reporter gene, which is activated by either RAR•RXR heterodimers or RXR homodimers (20.Zhang X.K. Lehmann J. Hoffmann B. Dawson M.I. Cameron J. Graupner G. Hermann T. Tran P. Pfahl M. Nature. 1992; 358: 587-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar), we found the same results (data not shown). For an RAR-selective retinoid (Ro 13-7410, TTNPB(38.Beard R.L. Gil D.W. Marler D.K. Henry E. Colon D.F. Gillett S.J. Arefieg T. Breen T.S. Krauss H. Davies P.J.A. Chandraratna R.A.S. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 1994; 4: 1447-1452Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar)), no activation was detectable on all three tested response elements (data not shown). Transactivation measured using chimeric RAR-ERs in COS cells showed that these three compounds are roughly three orders of magnitude less active on RARs than t-RA or 9-cis RA. Fig. 2C shows as an example dose-response curves of 9-cis RA, t-RA, and the three compounds on RARα-ER transactivation. Table 1 summarizes activation and binding data of these compounds to RARα, -β, and -γ and to RXRα. As can be seen from these values, the three RXR-selective compounds show approximately a 100-fold preference for RXR versus RAR in transactivation. To determine whether RAR•RXR heterodimers can bind both ligands when bound to DNA, DNA-dependent ligand binding assays were performed. 3H-t-RA bound with high affinity to RAR•RXR heterodimer on a βRARE (DR5) (Fig. 3A) and could be competed by unlabeled t-RA, 9-cis RA, and Ro 13-7410 but not by the three RXR-selective ligands. 3H-9-cis RA bound also with high affinity to RAR•RXR heterodimers and could be competed 100% by unlabeled 9-cis RA. Unlabeled t-RA or Ro 13-7410 was able to compete approximately half of the counts, which corresponds to the proportion of 9-cis RA that may be bound by the RAR receptor in the RAR•RXR heterodimer. The RXR-selective retinoids showed also about half the competition, which would correspond to the proportion of 9-cis RA that is bound to the RXR receptor in a heterodimer. After coincubation of 3H-9-cis RA and a 50-fold excess of unlabeled Ro 13-7410, only the RXR receptor in the DNA heterodimer should be bound with 3H-9-cis RA. The addition of 9-cis RA and an RXR-selective ligand results in a nearly 100% competition, while t-RA and Ro 13-7410 show no competition. This result indicates that binding of 9-cis RA and RXR-selective ligands to the RXR receptors in an RAR•RXR heterodimer, bound to DNA, does occur. In a second experiment, we dropped the ratio of RAR to RXR from 1 to 0.1. Under these conditions, the binding of 3H-t-RA fell to near background levels (data not shown). This result suggests that under these conditions the RXR homodimer and not the heterodimer is preferentially, if not exclusively, bound to the DNA. This interpretation was supported by binding studies using 3H-9-cis RA with and without Ro 13-7410 (Fig. 3B). As expected for an RXR homodimer complex, we see nearly complete competition with RXR-selective ligands. To determine the activity of these compounds in activating an RAR•RXR heterodimer, we cotransfected CV-1 cells with a βRARE-TK-luc reporter and the indicated receptors in the presence of 100 nM 9-cis RA, Ro 13-7410 (TTNPB, an RAR-selective retinoid(38.Beard R.L. Gil D.W. Marler D.K. Henry E. Colon D.F. Gillett S.J. Arefieg T. Breen T.S. Krauss H. Davies P.J.A. Chandraratna R.A.S. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 1994; 4: 1447-1452Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar)), Ro 48-2250, Ro 47-5944, or a combination of the last two with 10 nM Ro 13-7410 (Fig. 4). No activation or at most a weak activation was seen in the presence of the RXR- or RAR-selective retinoids, while the βRARE-TK-luc expression was well induced by 9-cis RA (Fig. 4, lanes 2-5). However, the simultaneous addition of an RXR-selective ligand and 10 nM RAR-selective ligand (Ro 13-7410) resulted in stronger activation (Fig. 4, lanes 6 and 7), similar to that achieved with 9-cis RA. This enhanced or sometimes synergistic effect was most pronounced by cotransfecting RXRα. We found the same effect using other RAR-selective ligands in combination with these RXR-selective retinoids (data not shown). t-RA at 100 nM showed the same response as 9-cis RA (data not shown). To further characterize the interaction of the synthetic compounds with RXRα, we have tested whether they are able to induce binding of RXRα to an RXR response element in vitro (CRBP II and βRARE). We have visualized this binding using a gel retardation assay, in which RXR binding to the radiolabeled CRBP II or βRARE causes slower migration of the response element in a non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel. The complexes being detected under these conditions have been shown to correspond to RXR homodimer bound to the DNA fragment(20.Zhang X.K. Lehmann J. Hoffmann B. Dawson M.I. Cameron J. Graupner G. Hermann T. Tran P. Pfahl M. Nature. 1992; 358: 587-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar). As can be seen from Fig. 5A (CRBP II) and 5B (βRARE), 9-cis RA, at a concentration of 1 μM, induces the formation of a more slowly migrating band. A band of the same size is induced with each of the synthetic RXR ligands at the same concentration on both response elements. Fig. 3B shows that this binding of the RXR homodimer on βRARE is dose dependent. We found the same dose dependence for CRBP II (data not shown). t-RA is unable to induce band formation. The specificity of this binding is demonstrated by its competition with unlabeled response element (Fig. 5B, lane 12) and also by lack of competition using an estrogen response element (Fig. 5B, lane 13). This result implies that the synthetic RXR ligands are able to induce dose-dependent conformational changes of RXRα allowing DNA sequence-specific binding as detected by gel retardation. Having identified compounds with high selectivity for RXR versus RAR, we examined the effects of these compounds on a biological function, specifically the induction of differentiation of the myelocytic leukemia cell line, HL-60. Fig. 6 shows the degree of HL-60 differentiation, using NBT reduction as a parameter for differentiation-induced oxidative burst potential. t-RA and Ro 40-6055 (an RARα-selective retinoid) are able to induce HL-60 differentiation at ED50 concentrations of 0.3-0.6 nM, while the RXR-selective compounds show only marginal inducing activity, with ED50 values of 100 nM for Ro 47-8652, 220 nM for Ro 48-2250, and 600 nM for Ro 47-5944, respectively. This is in agreement with their weak potency as activators of RARs. HL-60 cells appear to be about 10-fold more sensitive to retinoids than the transactivation reporter system. We raised the question whether RXR-selective retinoids could augment the differentiation-inducing potency of t-RA or of Ro 40-6055. We have tested the combined effect of RXR ligands with t-RA at concentrations of t-RA per se not sufficient to give full levels of HL-60 differentiation and at concentrations of RXR ligands inducing no HL-60 differentiation at all. As can be seen from Fig. 7, all three RXR-selective retinoids were able to potentiate the effects of t-RA (Fig. 7, A-C) and Ro 40-6055 (Fig. 7, D-F) at concentrations at which they were not active or only minimally active by themselves. The amplification was in the range of 3-10-fold, i.e. 3-10-fold higher concentrations of t-RA or Ro 40-6055 alone are required to obtain comparable levels of HL-60 differentiation. In this report, we have presented three synthetic retinoids that function as RXR-selective ligands. All three compounds contain the polyene side chain in a 9-cis-like fixed configuration through the introduction of a ring system. Since 9-cis RA is the natural RXR ligand, these analogs were planned to mimic structural features of 9-cis RA, and indeed they do show nearly equal potency on RXRα as compared to 9-cis RA. Gratifyingly, even though 9-cis RA is also a ligand for the RARs, these synthetic compounds exhibit virtually no activity on RARs in binding or transactivation assays. This could be indicative of a distinctly different retinoid binding pocket in RARs versus RXRs. It could, on the one hand, imply that the binding pocket in RARs cannot accept the additional size of a ring system at this position of the side chain, although with the introduction of a three-membered ring in Ro 48-2250, the size of the molecule is only minimally increased. Alternatively, 9-cis RA may adopt different conformations in binding to RARs and RXRs, and the RAR-required conformation may not be accessible to these ring-constrained synthetic derivatives. As a third possibility, mutual isomerization of the natural ligands t-RA and 9-cis RA under the assay conditions cannot be rigorously excluded. The activity of these RXR-selective compounds is evidenced first by their binding affinity for RXRα, which is nearly as high as that of 9-cis RA (Fig. 1, Table 1). Second, these compounds can induce the formation of RXR homodimers on RXR response elements (Fig. 5). Third, these derivatives show potent transactivation of RXR reporter genes (Fig. 2). Fourth, these retinoids are able to potentiate the RAR•RXR heterodimer-mediated transactivation by the RAR-selective retinoid 13-7410 (Fig. 4). Taken together, these results suggest appropriate ligand-induced conformational changes of the receptor, leading to RXR transcriptional activity. Furthermore, these selective ligands can be used for exploring the functions of RXR. Since RXR is known to heterodimerize with RAR, we have tested the influence of these compounds on a retinoic acid-mediated process, HL-60 differentiation. Published reports suggest that RARα is critical in mediating this differentiation(1.Apfel C. Bauer F. Crettaz M. Forni L. Kamber M. Kaufmann F. LeMotte P. Pirson W. Klaus M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7129-7133Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). The RXR ligands per se exhibit EC50 concentrations higher than 100 nM in inducing HL-60 differentiation (Fig. 6). This implies that liganded RXR receptors are not sufficient to promote induction of HL-60 cells and suggests that liganded RARs are necessary for this process. The weak effect of the RXR-selective retinoids can be explained by their residual RAR-activating activity (Fig. 2B). t-RA, a potent ligand for RARs, induces HL-60 differentiation with an EC50 of about 0.6 nM. When t-RA is added to cultures at a concentration of 0.1 nM, essentially no differentiation is induced. When cells are treated with 0.1 nM t-RA plus 100 nM of an RXR-selective ligand, substantial induction of differentiation is obtained (Fig. 7, A-C). These effects are somewhat more pronounced if a preferential RARα ligand (Ro 40-6055) rather than the unselective t-RA is used (Fig. 7, D-F). From the results obtained in these combination experiments, it is obvious that the effects of RXR-selective ligands on HL-60 differentiation are more than additive and therefore cannot be explained solely by their residual RAR-activating effects. This indicates that RX receptors, in the presence of their ligand, are able to enhance an RAR-mediated process. This could well be through the activity of an RAR•RXR heterodimer in the presence of both receptor ligands. In support of this hypothesis, we have presented evidence (Fig. 3) that both ligands do indeed bind to a heterodimer complex on a DNA response element (βRARE) and show together enhanced transactivation of this element in transient transfections of a reporter gene (Fig. 4). A recent study has demonstrated by direct ligand binding experiments that within an RXR•RAR heterodimer bound to a DR5 or DR1 response element, RXR is excluded from binding its ligand(39.Kurokawa R.

These data appear to contradict our conclusion that both ligands are able to bind such a complex and would support alternative hypotheses, for example, that two independent RAR and RXR pathways exist, and only the activation of both pathways leads to a maximal response. There may be several reasons why Kurokawa et al.(39.Kurokawa R. DiRenzo J. Boehm M. Sugarman J. Gloss B. Rosenfeld M.G. Heyman R.A. Glass C.K. Nature. 1994; 371: 528-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar) did not see binding of an RXR ligand in the heterodimer. One reason may be that the synthetic compound they used is unable to bind in the heterodimer, whereas the new ligands we describe here are accessible to the heterodimer. In addition, it is not clear exactly which response element they use, and it is well possible that on one response element the RXR ligand binding is blocked but not on another. The fact that the addition of both an RAR and RXR ligand is apparently able to activate better than either alone has also been reported by two other groups. Durand et al.(40.Durand B. Saunders M. Gaudon C. Roy B. Losson R. Cahmbon P. EMBO J. 1994; 12: 5370-5382Crossref Scopus (316) Google Scholar) could show that activation on an RAR•RXR heterodimer response element (βRARE, DR5T-TK/CAT) in HeLa cells is more than additive. They found a poor activation by an RXR-selective ligand, a moderate activation by t-RA (not a very RAR-selective retinoid) and a synergistic activation by both ligands, to the same level as 9-cis RA alone. Lotan et al.(41.Lotan R. Dawson M.I. Zou C. Jong L. Lotan D. Zou C. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 232-236PubMed Google Scholar) describe that a combination of suboptimal concentrations of RAR-selective retinoids with RXR-selective retinoids shows more than additive effects on the inhibition of cervical carcinoma cell proliferation. The fact that these RXR ligands can enhance a biological response mediated by a known heterodimer partner, RAR, may serve as an indication that they could also be useful for enhancing processes controlled by other receptor partners, such as thyroid receptors, vitamin D receptor, or peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors, as has also been suggested by combination experiments with 9-cis RA(18.Kliewer S.A. Umesono K. Noonan D.J. Heyman R.A. Evans R.M. Nature. 1992; 358: 771-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (1525) Google Scholar, 42.Carlberg C. Bendik I. Wyss A. Meier E Sturzenbecker L.J. Grippo J.F. Hunziker W. Nature. 1993; 361: 657-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). With a view to clinical usefulness, the RXR-selective ligands could, by increasing the potency of partner receptor ligands, allow lower doses to be administered and thus, by reducing the side effects, provide superior treatment regimens for the various indications where such compounds are commonly used.

A myristoyl or related N-acyl group covalently attached to the amino terminus of recoverin enables it to translocate to retinal disc membranes when the Ca2+ level is elevated. Two-dimensional 1H-13C shift correlation NMR spectra of recoverin containing a 13C-labeled myristoyl group were obtained to selectively probe the effect of Ca2+ on the environment of the attached myristoyl group. In the Ca2+-free state, each pair of methylene protons bonded to carbon atoms 2, 3, 11, and 12 of the myristoyl group gives rise to two peaks. The splittings, caused by nonequivalent methylene proton chemical shifts, indicate that the myristoyl group interacts intimately with the protein in the Ca2+-free state. By contrast, only one peak is seen for each pair of methylene protons in the Ca2+-bound state, indicating that the myristoyl group is located in an isotropic environment in this form. Furthermore, the 1H-13C shift correlation NMR spectrum of Ca2+-bound recoverin is very similar to that of myristic acid in solution. 1H-13C shift correlation NMR experiments were also performed with 13C-labeled recoverin to selectively probe the resonances of methyl groups in the hydrophobic core of the protein. The spectrum of Ca2+-bound myristoylated recoverin is different from that of Ca2+-free myristoylated recoverin but similar to that of Ca2+-bound unmyristoylated recoverin. Hence, the myristoyl group interacts little with the hydrophobic core of myristoylated recoverin in the Ca2+-bound state. Three-dimensional (13C/F1)-edited (13C/F3)-filtered heteronuclear multiple quantum correlation-nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy spectra of recoverin containing a 13C-labeled myristoyl group were obtained to selectively probe protein residues located within 5 Å of the myristoyl group. The myristoyl group makes close contact with a number of aromatic residues in Ca2+-free recoverin, whereas the myristoyl group makes no observable contacts with the protein in the Ca2+-bound state. These NMR data demonstrate that the binding of Ca2+ to recoverin induces the extrusion of its myristoyl group into the solvent, which would enable it to interact with a lipid bilayer or a hydrophobic site of a target protein.

https://openalex.org/W2077412630,"Measurements of retinal motion along a set of predetermined orientations on the retina of a moving system give rise to global patterns. Because the form and location of these patterns depend purely on three-dimensional (3D) motion, the effects of 3D motion and scene structure on image motion can be globally separated. The patterns are founded on easily derivable image measurements that depend only on the sign of image motion and do not require information about optical flow. The computational theory presented here explains how the self-motion of a system can be estimated by locating these patterns."

INTRODUCTIONIt has been accepted that, regardless of the species, the major aerobic respiratory electron transport chain generally consists of one or more primary dehydrogenase (such as NADH and succinate dehydrogenases), a variety of quinone, and one or more respiratory terminal oxidase system(s)(1.Ludwig B.

Nevertheless, the prokaryotic respiratory complexes generally have much simpler subunit structures compared with the structural and functional homologues of the mitochondrial counterparts, and provide useful models for the molecular mechanics and the properties of the individual catalytic and redox centers of the energy-coupled apparatus(6.Saraste M.

Of these, the heme-copper oxidases are characterized by a unique binuclear metal center composed of a five-coordinated heme and a copper (Cub), which is the site for reducing molecular oxygen to water, and an additional six-coordinated heme(8.García-Horsman J.A.

Two types of the electron transfer to the oxidase superfamily are known: one type involves the respiratory complex III (cytochrome bc1-b6f complex that functions as a quinol:cytochrome c oxidoreductase(12.Trumpower B.L.

The preliminary 16 S rRNA sequence analysis suggests that the isolate is a novel species belonging to the genus Sulfolobus.) (28.Wakagi T. Oshima T. Syst. Appl.

In addition, it appears that they contain unusual hemes such as “heme AS,” which has a hydroxyethylgeranylgeranyl side chain at position 2 of the iron porphyrin instead of the hydroxyethylfarnesyl group in heme A, beside a conventional protoheme IX(22.Lübben M.

However, the Sulfolobus oxidase complex preparations (20.Wakagi T. Yamauchi T. Oshima T. Müller M. Azzi A. Sone N. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

In particular, we note that the reduced-minus-oxidized difference spectrum of the SoxABCD oxidase from S. acidocaldarius strain DSM 639 (22.Lübben M. Warne A. Albracht S.P.J. Saraste M. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 13: 327-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) is similar to that of a novel three-subunit cytochrome oxidase a583-aa3 subcomplex from Sulfolobus sp. strain 7, which did not show any caldariellaquinol but a ferrocytochrome c oxidase activity (20.Wakagi T.

More recently, we found that the b-type cytochrome is in the upstream of the a-type cytochromes of the archaeal respiratory chain, and its partially-denatured form to be copurified with the cytochrome a583-aa3 subcomplex, which, however, did not retain any caldariellaquinol oxidase activity. ( 2T. Iwasaki, T. Wakagi, and T. Oshima, manuscript in preparation.) In addition, the complexity of the archaeal aerobic respiratory chain is further empathized by the recent findings that the Sulfolobus membranes in fact contain the respiratory Rieske-type FeS clusters(37.Anemüller S.

In this paper, we show that the active respiratory terminal oxidase segment of Sulfolobus sp. strain 7 contains one non-CO-reactive b-type cytochrome (b562) and two different a-type cytochromes (a583 and aa3), in addition to one copper and a Rieske-type FeS cluster(38.Iwasaki T. Isogai T. Iizuka T. Oshima T. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 2576-2582Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which, as a whole, function as an active caldariellaquinol oxidase supercomplex. In addition, evidence is presented that cytochrome b562, which recently appeared to be in the upstream of and tightly associated with the a-type cytochromes,2 is probably functionally equivalent to cytochrome bII of the respiratory complex III (cytochrome bc1-b6f complex), while cytochrome a583(36.Iwasaki T.

Furthermore, the purified terminal oxidase supercomplex was reconstituted in vitro for the first time together with caldariellaquinone and the cognate respiratory complex II(39.Iwasaki T. Wakagi T.

MEGA-9 and MEGA-10 were purchased from Dohjin (Kumamoto, Japan), sodium cholate from Sigma, sucrose monolaurate (SM-1200) from Mitsubishi Kasei Co. (Japan), and lauryl maltoside (n-dodecyl β-D-maltoside) from Boehringer Mannheim, respectively. Hydroxylapatite (Bio-Gel HTP) was from Bio-Rad. Heme A, protoheme, heme O, and heme AS were prepared by HCl/acetone extraction from bovine heart cytochrome aa3, hemoglobin (Sigma), Escherichia coli membranes(14.Puustinen A. Wikström M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 6122-6126Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), and Thermus thermophilus membranes(35.Lübben M. Morand K. J. Biol.

Caldariellaquinone was isolated from the membrane of Sulfolobus sp. strain 7 as described previously by De Rosa et al.(43.De Rosa M. De Rosa S. Gambacorta A. Minale L. Thomson R.H. Worthington R.D. J. Chem. Soc. Perkin. Trans. 1977; 1: 653-657Crossref Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Horse heart cytochrome c was purchased from Sigma. Water was purified by the Milli-Q purification system (Millipore). Other chemicals mentioned in this study were of analytical grade.Organism, Cell Culture, and Membrane PreparationSulfolobus sp. strain 7 was cultivated aerobically and chemoheterotrophically at pH 2.5-3 and 75-80°C as described previously(28.Wakagi T. Oshima T. Syst. Appl. Microbiol. 1986; 7: 295-304Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 44.Wakao H. Wakagi T. Oshima T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1987; 102: 255-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), and was harvested in the early to middle exponential phase of growth and stored at −80°C until use. The cells were suspended in 200 ml of 100 mM Tris-Cl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 0.2 mM PMSF and 10 mM EDTA (∼4 ml/g of cells (wet weight)), and disrupted with a French press (Otake Works, Tokyo) at 1500 kg/cm2 twice. The membranes pelleted by ultracentrifugation with a Beckman 45Ti rotor at 130,000 × g for 120 min at 15°C were composed of two layers. The upper soft layer was carefully collected and resuspended in 50 mM Tris-Cl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 0.2 mM PMSF and 10 mM EDTA, then pelleted by ultracentrifugation at 130,000 × g for 90 min at 20°C. The membrane fraction was washed once more by resuspending in the same buffer and collected by ultracentrifugation; the pellet thus obtained was suspended in 15 mM Tris-Cl buffer, pH 7.3, containing 20% (v/v) glycerol and 0.2 mM PMSF at ∼20 mg of protein/ml, and used for the subsequent purification of the archaeal respiratory complexes (see below). Alternatively, the membranes were suspended in 40 mM potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.8, containing 0.2 mM PMSF at ∼20 mg of protein/ml, then stored at −80°C until use. The pH value of 6.8 was preferably used in the present studies, because it is the optimal value for the succinate-dependent oxygen uptake and succinate:ubiquinone-1 oxidoreductase activities of the archaeal membrane fraction.Solubilization and Purification of the Sulfolobus Membrane-bound Cytochromes as a SupercomplexAll purification steps were carried out at 4°C, except for Step 2 at room temperature, and following the absorption at 280 and 423 nm of each fraction at different purification steps.Step 1: Cholate/MEGA-9 ExtractionTo the washed membrane suspension was added 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.8, containing 5% (w/v) sodium cholate, 1% (w/v) MEGA-9, 10% (v/v) glycerol, and 0.6 mM PMSF. The concentration of MEGA-9 to the amount of protein was critical for avoiding destruction of interactions among cytochromes to the minimal extent. The detergent/protein mixture was gently stirred for 12 h at 4°C, and was ultracentrifuged at 130,000 × g for 90 min at 4°C.Step 2: Hydroxylapatite Column ChromatographyThe solubilized material was directly applied to a hydroxylapatite column (2.0 × 31 cm) which had been equilibrated with 0.5% cholate, 0.1% MEGA-9, 10 mM succinate, 1 mM PMSF, and 10 mM potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.8. The column was washed with 100 ml of the same detergent buffer, followed by 500 ml of the same buffer containing a linear gradient of 10-200 mM potassium phosphate, pH 6.8. It was then washed with 100 ml of 0.5% cholate, 0.1% MEGA-9, 10 mM succinate, 1 mM PMSF, and 200 mM potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.8. Finally, the Sulfolobus cytochromes of both a- and b-types were concomitantly eluted with the same buffer containing 500 mM potassium phosphate.Step 3: Sucrose Density GradientThe pooled fractions after Step 2 were subsequently loaded on a sucrose density gradient (20-70%, w/v) containing 0.5% cholate, 0.6% MEGA-9, 25 mM potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.8, and the tubes of a Beckman SW 28Ti rotor were spun at 28,000 rpm for 30 h at 4°C. The greenish band near the bottom of a tube (at ∼55-60% sucrose, w/v) was collected by a tubing, and was checked for purity by SDS-PAGE. When required, this step was repeated for a higher purity. The pooled fractions were combined and stored as the purified cytochrome supercomplex at −80°C until use.Analytical MethodsAbsorption spectra were recorded with either a Shimadzu MPS-2000 or UV-3000 spectrophotometer, or a Hitachi U-3210 spectrophotometer equipped with a thermoelectric cell holder. EPR measurements were carried out using a JEOL JEX-RE1X spectrometer equipped with an Air Products model LTR-3 Heli-Tran cryostat system, in which temperature was monitored with a Scientific Instruments series 5500 temperature indicator/controller.The oxidation and reduction potentials of the Sulfolobus membrane-bound cytochromes were measured in a Thunberg-type cell similar to that described by Dutton (45.Dutton P.L. Methods Enzymol. 1978; 54: 411-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (725) Google Scholar) under anaerobic conditions with continuous flow of N2 gas while st irring. The medium used was 60 mM potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.8, with the following redox mediators: 40 μM 2,3,5,6-tetramethylphenylenediamine, 100 μM EDTA-Fe, 10 μM phenazine methosulfate, 3 μM pyocyanin, and 20 μM menadione. Ambient redox potentials (Eh) were monitored with a Pt-Ag/AgCl electrode (Type PS-165F, Toa Electronic Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). Desired potentials were attained by adding a small volume of ferricyanide or dithionite solution, and obtained absorption spectra were recorded with a Shimadzu UV-3000 spectrophotometer equipped with a Fujitsu FM 16β HD-II personal computer. All midpoint redox potentials stated in the text were calculated from titration curves using a fitting program (written at the Department of Biology, Tokyo Metropolitan University).Test for the presence of a cyanide-sensitive branched respiratory chain in Sulfolobus sp. strain 7 was carried out polarographically at 55°C, as a function of HOQNO and KCN concentrations, with a Clark-type oxygen electrode (Oxygen analyzer MP-1000, Iizima Products, Tokyo, Japan) equipped with temperature-controlled cells. The standard reaction mixture contained 480-1440 μg of membrane proteins/ml of 40 mM potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.8, in a total volume of 2.1 ml, and the reaction was initiated by addition of 5 mM succinate.Presteady state reduction of the membrane-bound cytochromes b562 and a583 in the presence of 5 mM KCN was monitored at 562-552 and 583-573 nm, respectively, with a Shimadzu UV-3000 dual wavelength spectrophotometer at room temperature.A ferrocytochrome c oxidase activity was measured spectrophotometrically at 50°C with horse heart cytochrome c (Sigma) as an electron donor, as described previously (20.Wakagi T. Yamauchi T. Oshima T. Müller M. Azzi A. Sone N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 165: 1110-1114Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar).The in vitro reconstitution experiments of the archaeal aerobic succinoxidase chain were carried out polarographically at 50°C with a Clark-type oxygen electrode (Oxygen analyzer MP-1000, Iizima Products, Tokyo, Japan) equipped with temperature-controlled cells. The standard reaction mixture contained 0.5% (w/v) cholate, 0.6% (w/v) MEGA-9, 20% (w/v) sucrose in 25 mM potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.8, in a total volume of 2.1 ml; for the inhibitor studies, the reaction mixture also contained 5 mM succinate, 22.1-44.3 μg of the purified respiratory complex II (the preparations obtained after Step 5b were used because of a slightly superior purity(39.Iwasaki T.

The concentration of caldariellaquinone in the mixture was kept low because of its very hydrophobic nature and limited availability.The succinate-driven reduction behavior of cytochromes in the terminal oxidase supercomplex in the in vitro reconstitution system was monitored spectrophotometrically at 20°C with a Beckman DU7400 spectrophotometer; the second-order finite derivative spectrum of the 5 mM succinate-reduced minus oxidized difference spectra of the terminal oxidase supercomplex was recorded every 30 s (the average scanning time, ∼1-2 s), in 25 mM potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.8, containing the purified respiratory complex II, 7 μM caldariellaquinone, 0.6% (w/v) MEGA-9, and 0.5% (w/v) cholate.Protein was measured by the BCA assay (Pierce Chemical) with bovine serum albumin as a standard. Types of hemes were determined as described by Sone and Fujiwara(15.Sone N. Fujiwara Y. FEBS Lett. 1991; 288: 154-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), using hemes A, As, and O, and protoheme IX as standards (14.Puustinen A. Wikström M. Proc. Natl."

The receptor was modified to contain the FLAG epitope (DYKDDDDK), expressed in Sf9 cells, and purified to apparent homogeneity (4.3 μmol cyclic GMP formed/min/mg protein; 5.8 nmol 125I-ANP binding site/mg protein) by a combination of immunoaffinity, Q-Sepharose FF, and wheat germ agglutinin batch chromatography. High initial protein/detergent ratios, the presence of glycerol (40%), and the inclusion of protein phosphatase inhibitors in all buffers resulted in the purification of a receptor that continued to transduce the ANP/ATP activation signal. Both native and purified GC-A contained a single class of high affinity ANP binding sites (Kd = 60 pM) and an equivalent EC50 for ATP (0.3 mM). Positive cooperativity as a function of MnGTP was retained during purification. Thus, GC-A is capable of transducing a ligand binding signal in the absence of other proteins.

INTRODUCTIONThe atrial natriuretic peptide receptor (NPR-A) coupled to guanylyl cyclase activity (GC-A) 1The abbreviations used are: GC-Aguanylyl cyclase-linked atrial natriuretic peptide receptorANPatrial natriuretic peptideKHDkinase homology domain. is a prototype for a family of membrane-bound guanylyl cyclases currently numbering 6 in mammals (A-F). The B and C cyclases appear to be receptors for C-type natriuretic peptide and heat-stable enterotoxins/guanylin, respectively, while D, E, and F remain orphan receptors(1.Garbers D.L. Cell. 1992; 71: 1-4Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar, 2.Yang R.-B. Foster D.C. Garbers D.L. Fülle H.-J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 602-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 3.Fülle H.-J. Vassar R. Foster D.C. Yang R.-B. Axel R. Garbers D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3571-3575Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 4).Members of the family contain a single apparent transmembrane domain that separates an amino-terminal extracellular, ligand binding domain from an intracellular region that contains both a cyclase catalytic domain and a protein kinase homology domain (KHD)(1.Garbers D.L. Cell. 1992; 71: 1-4Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). The function of the KHD is not fully understood, but since ATP is required for transduction of the ANP binding signal to activation of cyclase catalytic activity, and since various mutations within the KHD interrupt ANP/ATP signaling(5, 6, 7), it has been suggested that the protein kinase homology domain binds ATP(6). ATP appears to act without conversion to ADP or other metabolites since non-hydrolyzable analogues of ATP also substitute for ATP(8, 9). The KHD of the cyclases resembles the kinase homology domain 2 of the JAKS; an invariant Asp found in the catalytic domain of known protein kinases is a different amino acid in either the cyclases or kinase homology domain 2 of the JAKS. Although the requirement of ATP and peptide ligand for activation of GC-A is somewhat analogous to the guanine nucleotide-dependent activation of adenylyl cyclase by hormones, non-hydrolyzable analogues of GTP activate adenylyl cyclase in the absence of hormone, and sub-micromolar as opposed to millimolar concentrations of nucleotide are effective(10).During previous attempts to purify GC-A, the ANP/ATP activation signal has vanished, even though ANP has continued to bind to the receptor (11, 12). Thus, it was suggested that additional factor(s), specifically ATP binding proteins(8), are required for transduction of a hormone binding signal to activation of the cyclase catalytic domain. Now we show, however, that after purification of detergent-solubilized GC-A to apparent homogeneity, the cyclase retains ability to be activated by ANP/ATP.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialsSf9 cells (13) were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. BaculoGold virus was from Pharmingen. cDNA encoding FLAG-GC-A was kindly provided by Dr. Michael Chinkers (Vollum Institute, Oregon Health Sciences Center). Lubrol 12A9 (from ICI) was a gift from Dr. Elliott Ross (University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas). Polyoxyethylene-10-lauryl ether was from Sigma, M1 and M2 immunoaffinity columns were from IBI, wheat germ agglutinin-agarose was from Vector, and Q-Sepharose FF was from Pharmacia. 125I-ANP, [α-32P]GTP, and [3H]cGMP were from DuPont NEN, and rat ANP (99-126) was from Peninsula. Reagents used for radioimmunoassay of cGMP have been previously described(14).Expression of FLAG-GC-A in Sf9 CellsThe baculovirus expression vector PVL-FLAG-GC-A was cotransfected with BaculoGold virus into Sf9 cells, and the recombinant virus was then cloned according to Kitts et al.(15). Sf9 cells infected with the recombinant virus expressed ∼0.7-1 pmol of 125I-ANP binding site/mg of particulate protein, while no significant binding was detected in uninfected cells.Solubilization of FLAG-GC-A48 h post-infection with the recombinant virus, Sf9 cells expressing FLAG-GC-A were pelleted and frozen in liquid nitrogen. The frozen pellets were thawed in the presence of a solution containing 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, 40% glycerol, 1 mM EDTA, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mM β-glycerol phosphate, and 5 mM sodium azide (buffer A). The thawed cells were broken in a Dounce homogenizer, and crude particulate fractions were obtained and washed by centrifugation (30,000 × g) in the same buffer. The particulate fraction was resuspended in buffer A at a concentration of 20-30 mg of protein/ml. FLAG-GC-A was then solubilized by rocking the solution for 60 min at 4°C in buffer A containing 1% Lubrol 12A9 or polyoxyethylene-10-lauryl ether. After 60 min, the detergent extract was diluted with buffer A to 0.5% of either non-ionic detergent and centrifuged at 100,000 × g. The supernatant fluid was obtained and diluted to 0.1% detergent with buffer A. Approximately 20-40% of the 125I-ANP binding sites detected in the particulate fraction were solubilized. Higher recoveries (up to 70-80% of 125I-ANP binding sites could be obtained at higher detergent:protein ratios; however, enzyme solubilized under these conditions lost ANP and ATP sensitivity (not shown).Purification of FLAG-GC-AAll purification procedures were performed at 4°C. Detergent extracts (200 ml) were rocked with 6 ml of M2 immunoaffinity resin for 2-3 h and then washed batchwise by centrifugation (10 times, 30 ml) with buffer B (buffer A containing 0.05% detergent, 0.25 mM ATP, 150 mM NaCl, and 0.025% phosphatidylcholine). FLAG-GC-A was eluted from the resin by rocking with 6 ml of buffer B containing 0.1 mg/ml of FLAG peptide for 30 min. After centrifugation at 3000 × g, FLAG-GC-A was collected in the supernatant fluid. The above elution procedure was repeated 10 times. The eluates were then pooled and filtered through a 0.45-μm filter, and the filtrate was then mixed with 2 ml of Q-Sepharose FF for 30 min and centrifuged. FLAG-GC-A was collected in the supernatant fluid. The Q-Sepharose FF resin was then washed three times with 10 ml of buffer B by centrifugation, and additional FLAG-GC-A was also collected in the supernatant fluid. The supernatant fluids were then pooled and rocked with 10 ml of wheat germ agglutinin-agarose for 2 h and centrifuged. The pellet was washed batchwise (10 times, 40 ml of buffer B) by centrifugation. FLAG-GC-A was then eluted from the resin by rocking with 10 ml of buffer B containing 0.3 MN-acetylglucosamine for 20 min. After centrifugation, FLAG-GC-A was collected in the supernatant fluid. The procedure was repeated five times. The supernatant fluids were then pooled and filtered through a 0.45-μm filter. The filtrate was then made 2.25 mM with respect to CaCl2 and added to 2 ml of M1 immunoaffinity resin. The slurry was rocked for 2-3 h and washed batchwise by centrifugation (10 times, 10 ml of buffer B containing 2.25 mM CaCl2), and then purified FLAG-GC-A was eluted from the resin by rocking 30 min with 1 ml of buffer B containing 2 mM EDTA. FLAG-GC-A was collected in the supernatant fluid after centrifugation. The elution procedure was repeated four times. Purified FLAG-GC-A was subsequently stored at −80°C. The purification procedures were routinely performed within 20-24 h to minimize losses in ANP/ATP sensitivity.125I-ANP Binding AssayANP binding activity was determined as described previously(12), with the exception that 1% polyethyleneimine-treated Whatman GF/C filters were used for filtration. Nonspecific binding was determined using 1 μM non-radioactive ANP (99-126), and data were analyzed by nonlinear curve fitting using the LIGAND computer program(16).Guanylyl Cyclase AssayGuanylyl cyclase activity was determined by incubating samples (0.5-1 fmol 125I-ANP binding sites) at 37°C for the indicated time intervals in 0.1 ml of a reaction mixture consisting of 25 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 50 mM NaCl, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 0.25 mM 1-methyl-3-isobutylxanthine, 6 mM MgCl2, 5 mM creatine phosphate, 4 units of creatine phosphokinase, and 0.5 mM GTP. To determine the enzyme activity using MnGTP as substrate, 0.1% Triton X-100 and 6 mM MnCl2 also were added. The reaction was initiated by the addition of enzyme samples and terminated by the addition of 0.45 ml of 0.11 M zinc acetate, followed by 0.45 ml of 0.11 M Na2CO3. After centrifugation at 3000 × g, 5 or 45 μl of the supernatant fluid were assayed by radioimmunoassay for cyclic GMP content(14). For the MgGTP dependence of the ANP/ATP experiment (Fig. 5), [α-32P]GTP was used as substrate, and the reaction was terminated by 0.1% SDS. The amount of [32P]cGMP was determined as described previously for adenylyl cyclase assays(17), with the modification that only 0.2 ml of H2O was added in the initial wash of the Dowex.Iodination of Purified ReceptorPurified FLAG-GC-A was incubated with 100 μCi of [125I]NaI for 20 min at room temperature in the presence of 0.1 M Tris-Cl, pH 6.8, and 1 pellet of IODOBEAD (Pierce). After removing the supernatant fluid from the IODOBEAD, free [125I]NaI was removed by a G-25 spin column. The sample was then electrophoresed using an 8% separating gel by the method of Laemmli(18). The gel was stained with silver(19), vacuum-dried, and subjected to autoradiography with HYPER-FILM-MP (Amersham).Protein DeterminationProtein content of the crude membrane fraction and the detergent extract was determined by amido black staining (20) using bovine serum albumin (Pierce, no. 23209) as a standard. The protein content of the purified FLAG-GC-A was determined by densitometry according to Merril and Pratt(21), as modified as follows. Purified FLAG-GC-A and bovine serum albumin standards (0.1-10 ng) were electrophoresed on SDS-polyacrylamide gels and then silver stained(19). After drying between transparent cellulose sheets (Bio-Rad), the protein content of the FLAG-GC-A sample was determined by comparing the intensity of staining with that of the bovine serum albumin. The intensity of staining was determined in a densitometric scanner (Molecular Dynamics model 300A) under conditions where the intensity was linearly proportional to the protein content.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONExpression of Recombinant FLAG-GC-A in Sf9 CellsTo facilitate rapid purification of the receptor, the FLAG epitope (DYKDDDDK) was introduced just to the carboxyl side of the signal peptide, thereby representing the amino terminus of the processed cyclase. The insertion of the FLAG epitope did not appear to alter biological activity of the enzyme since the number of 125I-ANP binding sites/mg protein or the relative cyclase activation in response to ANP/ATP in Sf9 membrane preparations was equivalent whether wild-type or FLAG-GC-A cyclase was expressed (data not shown).ANP/caged ATP maximally activated FLAG-GC-A at 48 h following infection with recombinant baculovirus, at which time 0.6-1.0 pmol of 125I-ANP binding sites/mg of protein in the crude particulate fraction were obtained (Table 1). With the described protocol to grow Sf9 cells (2% fetal bovine serum in IPL-41 in suspension), 0.7-1.0 nmol of 125I-ANP binding sites/liter of culture were routinely obtained.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab Solubilization of Epitope-tagged GC-AInitial experiments using many types of detergents such as Triton X-100 and deoxycholate to solubilize GC-A resulted in complete losses of ANP/ATP sensitivity (not shown). Of the various detergents tested, Lubrol 12A9 or polyoxyethylene-10-lauryl ether resulted in the highest ANP/ATP-responsive cyclase. However, high detergent/protein ratios during the initial solubilization decreased responsiveness to ANP/ATP. The ANP/ATP response of GC-A also was very sensitive to the concentration of glycerol, and the response to ANP/ATP was largely attenuated when solubilization buffers contained 20% glycerol but was retained in 40% glycerol. For the highest recovery of ANP/ATP-responsive cyclase, FLAG-GC-A was routinely solubilized with 1% detergent at protein concentrations of greater than 20 mg/ml and 40% glycerol. Under these conditions, 41% of the initial 125I-ANP binding activity and 7% of the particulate protein were solubilized (Table 1). The Kd for 125I-ANP binding for the solubilized and the membrane-bound receptor was the same under these conditions (Table 1).Purification of Ligand-sensitive FLAG-GC-AThe main objective of this study was to determine whether or not GC-A, serving as a prototype for the membrane guanylyl cyclases, could signal in the absence of other protein factors. Batch procedures using peptide competition (M2 immunoaffinity resins), N-acetylglucosamine competition (wheat germ agglutinin-agarose), and EDTA chelation (M1 immunoaffinity resin) were used to minimize the time required for purification. The capacity of the M2 immunoaffinity resin in buffer B restricted the amount of 125I-ANP binding sites applied to 40 pmol/ml resin.Typically, 40-50%, 60%, and 15-20% of FLAG-GC-A was recovered at the M2 immunoaffinity, wheat germ agglutinin-agarose, and M1 immunoaffinity steps, respectively. The final yield was typically about 0.2%.Purity of FLAG-GC-AThe silver-stained FLAG-GC-A recovered after the above purification steps was the only major band detected (Fig. 1), and densitometry of the silver-stained gel suggests that it is greater than 95% pure. The purity also was examined by the use of nonspecific radioiodination. FLAG-GC-A was the only major iodinated species, although longer exposures revealed a minor contaminant at about 70 kDa, a protein not detected by silver staining. The specific activity of the receptor preparation of 5.8 nmol of 125I-ANP bound/mg protein is comparable with previously purified ANP receptor (6-7 nmol/mg protein), suggestive of a highly purified cyclase preparation (12, 22).Fig. 1SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of FLAG-GC-A. Left panel, the membrane fraction (469 ng of protein), Lubrol 12A9 extract (713 ng of protein), or purified FLAG-GC-A (2.5 ng of protein) were electrophoresed and stained as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Right panel, [125I]NaI was incubated with buffer or with purified FLAG-GC-A (0.6 ng) in the presence of IODOBEAD. The labeled samples were electrophoresed and subjected to autoradiographic analysis as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Molecular weight markers are myosin (200,000), β-galactosidase (116,250), phosphorylase B (97,400), bovine serum albumin (66,200), and ovalbumin (45,000).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Ligand Binding Characteristics of FLAG-GC-AWith either the crude detergent extract or the purified preparation of cyclase, a single class of high affinity 125I-ANP binding sites (Kd = 65 pM) was obtained (Fig. 2).Fig. 2Equilibrium binding of 125I-ANP to GC-A. The crude Lubrol 12A9 extract (A) (558 ng of protein) or purified FLAG-GC-A (B) (0.375 ng of protein) were incubated with increasing concentrations of 125I-ANP at 25°C for 60 min as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Nonspecific binding was determined in parallel incubation mixtures containing 1 μM nonradioactive ANP. Binding data were plotted after correction for the nonspecific binding (5-20% of total binding). Inset, Scatchard plot. The respective Bmax and Kd values were 3.9 pmol/mg protein and 64 pM for the crude extract and 5.8 nmol/mg protein and 66 pM for purified FLAG-GC-A.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Ligand/ATP Responsiveness of FLAG-GC-AIn crude particulate fractions, ANP or caged ATP activated the cyclase by 1.3- or 1.7-fold, respectively, when added alone, but when added together, the cyclase was activated approximately 16-fold. The requirement for both ANP and the nucleotide, ATP, for maximum stimulation of GC-A has been previously reported(5, 8, 9). After detergent extraction, ANP and ATP continued to stimulate minimally when added alone, but together stimulated the cyclase about 9-fold. However, the detergent-solubilized GC-A is highly labile. Considerable ANP/ATP stimulation (50%) was lost upon storage at 4°C for 24 h, and only about 20% remained after incubation at 25°C for 60 min. 2S. K-F. W, C.-P. Ma, D. C. Foster, A.-Y. Chen, and D. L. Garbers, unpublished results. Following an approximate 1300-fold purification of GC-A, the receptor remained responsive to ATP/ANP (Fig. 3). About 10% or 30% activations of FLAG-GC-A were obtained when ANP or caged ATP were added alone, respectively. When an equivalent number of 125I-ANP binding sites (0.5-1 fmol ANP binding sites) were added per assay, the amount of cGMP produced upon incubation with ANP/ATP was approximately the same for the detergent extract or the purified enzyme preparation (see also Fig. 4, A and B). Therefore, the maximal responsiveness to ANP/ATP did not change significantly during the purification procedure. The basal activities were 2-3-fold higher in the purified preparation, and consequently the -fold stimulation by ANP/ATP decreased from approximately 8-fold in the crude detergent extract to 3-4-fold in the purified GC-A preparation. The guanylyl cyclase reaction was linear for at least 5 min, and as shown in Fig. 5, ANP/ATP appears to alter Vmax as a function of MgGTP. ATP at millimolar concentration is required for maximal stimulation by ANP (Fig. 5). Although millimolar concentrations of ATP are quite high when compared to the binding of GTP to G proteins, which regulate the adenylyl cyclase system (EC50∼0.1 μM), millimolar concentrations of ATP are near the cellular concentration of the adenine nucleotide. Therefore, variations in intracellular ATP concentrations could affect ANP-dependent activation of guanylyl cyclase.Fig. 3ANP and caged ATP activate purified GC-A. Guanylyl cyclase activities were determined under conditions where equivalent amounts of 125I-ANP binding sites (0.5 fmol) were added to each reaction mixture: crude membrane fraction (341 ng of protein), Lubrol 12A9 detergent extract (175 ng of protein) and purified FLAG-GC-A (0.118 ng of protein). The assays were performed at 37°C for 15 min in the presence of 0.5 mM GTP and 6 mM MgCl2 as described under “Experimental Procedures,” with or without caged ATP (c-ATP, 1 mM) or ANP (1 μM) as indicated.

FLAG-GC-A also yielded positive kinetics with respect to MnGTP in either the crude detergent extract or after purification (Fig. 6). This contrasts to the sea urchin guanylyl cyclase, which lost cooperative kinetics as a function of MnGTP after purification in initial work (23) but is consistent with later studies where the phosphorylated form of the sea urchin cyclase was purified and retained positive cooperativity(24).Fig. 6Kinetics of guanylyl cyclase activation by MnGTP. Guanylyl cyclase activities were determined using equivalent amounts of 125I-ANP binding sites (0.1 fmol/assay) of crude detergent extract (○) (35 ng of protein) or purified FLAG-GC-A (•) (0.024 ng of protein) with the indicated concentrations of MnGTP.

Using an ATPase assay (lower detection limit, 3 nmol/min/mg protein)(25), we have not observed any detectable ATPase activities from 150 ng of our purified preparation of FLAG-GC-A (not shown). Using nonspecific kinase substrates such as histone IIIs and VIIs, we have not observed detectable protein kinase activities in the purified preparations of FLAG-GC-A (not shown). This is consistent with the loss of protein kinase activity observed in the c-Kit receptor tyrosine kinase from the W42 allele of the white spotting locus where a conserved Asp in the catalytic domain is mutated to an Asn(26). An Asn rather than an Asp is also found in the same relative position in GC-A. Also, the absence of a critical lysine residue known to be important for kinase activity (27) suggests that protein kinase activity may be absent in the cyclases. That GC-A contains the glycine loop implicated in nucleotide binding suggests that it can bind ATP. The failure to detect protein kinase activity with GC-A, however, is consistent with its missing several critical residues found within the catalytic pocket of protein kinases (28).GC-A represents a prototype of the particulate guanylyl cyclase family where there are at least six subtypes identified so far(1.Garbers D.L. Cell. 1992; 71: 1-4Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar, 2.Yang R.-B. Foster D.C. Garbers D.L. Fülle H.-J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A. 1995; 92: 3571-3575Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 4). The results from this study initially show that the ligand/ATP are able to activate this class of particulate receptor guanylyl cyclases independent of other protein cofactors. In this unique signaling system, which utilizes ATP as the signal tranduction molecule, the domains for ligand binding, ATP regulation, and the effector guanylyl cyclase are located in one molecule. This is in contrast to the G protein-coupled receptor system, where the components for ligand binding, signal transducing, and effector are located in separate protein molecules. The mechanism of activation of GC-A is not yet understood, but the ANP/ATP activation is known to be regulated by phosphorylation (29, 30, 31) and oligomerization(32, 33). Although additional protein factors therefore are not required for signal transduction, it also seems likely that modulating factors will be discovered based on precedence with other cell surface receptors. INTRODUCTIONThe atrial natriuretic peptide receptor (NPR-A) coupled to guanylyl cyclase activity (GC-A) 1The abbreviations used are: GC-Aguanylyl cyclase-linked atrial natriuretic peptide receptorANPatrial natriuretic peptideKHDkinase homology domain. is a prototype for a family of membrane-bound guanylyl cyclases currently numbering 6 in mammals (A-F). The B and C cyclases appear to be receptors for C-type natriuretic peptide and heat-stable enterotoxins/guanylin, respectively, while D, E, and F remain orphan receptors(1.Garbers D.L. Cell. 1992; 71: 1-4Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar, 2.Yang R.-B. Foster D.C. Garbers D.L. Fülle H.-J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A. 1995; 92: 3571-3575Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 4).Members of the family contain a single apparent transmembrane domain that separates an amino-terminal extracellular, ligand binding domain from an intracellular region that contains both a cyclase catalytic domain and a protein kinase homology domain (KHD)(1.Garbers D.L. Cell. 1992; 71: 1-4Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). The function of the KHD is not fully understood, but since ATP is required for transduction of the ANP binding signal to activation of cyclase catalytic activity, and since various mutations within the KHD interrupt ANP/ATP signaling(5, 6, 7), it has been suggested that the protein kinase homology domain binds ATP(6). ATP appears to act without conversion to ADP or other metabolites since non-hydrolyzable analogues of ATP also substitute for ATP(8, 9). The KHD of the cyclases resembles the kinase homology domain 2 of the JAKS; an invariant Asp found in the catalytic domain of known protein kinases is a different amino acid in either the cyclases or kinase homology domain 2 of the JAKS. Although the requirement of ATP and peptide ligand for activation of GC-A is somewhat analogous to the guanine nucleotide-dependent activation of adenylyl cyclase by hormones, non-hydrolyzable analogues of GTP activate adenylyl cyclase in the absence of hormone, and sub-micromolar as opposed to millimolar concentrations of nucleotide are effective(10).During previous attempts to purify GC-A, the ANP/ATP activation signal has vanished, even though ANP has continued to bind to the receptor (11, 12). Thus, it was suggested that additional factor(s), specifically ATP binding proteins(8), are required for transduction of a hormone binding signal to activation of the cyclase catalytic domain. Now we show, however, that after purification of detergent-solubilized GC-A to apparent homogeneity, the cyclase retains ability to be activated by ANP/ATP."

The glucocorticoid receptor (GR) is a ligand-activated transcription factor and, like any other transcription factor, does not modulate gene activity just by binding to DNA. Interaction with other proteins is probably required to enhance the establishment of a functional transcription initiation complex. To identify such proteins, we analyzed the in vitro interaction of the glucocorticoid receptor bound to a double glucocorticoid response element with nuclear proteins and describe here three interacting proteins with different molecular weights. One of them, which we named GRIP 170 (GR-interacting protein), was purified and microsequenced, and it turned out to be an unknown protein. When tested in a cell-free transcription assay, the fraction highly enriched for GRIP 170 does not influence basal promoter activity but does enhance GR induction.

For regulating gene expression, the glucocorticoid receptor, like any other transcription factor, has to interact either directly with the transcription/initiation complex or indirectly via adapters or intermediary factors(3.Meyer M.-E.

In addition, receptor interaction with proteins involved in alterations of chromatin structure or function, Swi3 and Spt6, has been shown(14.Yoshinaga S.K. Peterson C.L. Hershkowitz I. Yamamoto K.R.

We have been interested in analyzing mechanisms for a synergistically increased steroid response mediated by multiple binding sites for different or identical transcription factors. Cooperative DNA binding has been shown for the glucocorticoid and the progesterone receptor in the case of duplicated binding sites(16.Ponglikitmongkol M. White J.H. Chambon P.

Biol. 1991; 222: 155-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). GR can also synergize with various transcription factors(20.Schüle R. Muller M. Kaltschmidt C. Renkawitz R. Science. 1988; 242: 1418-1420Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). Synergistic activation with the ubiquitous transcription factor OTF-1/Oct-1 is found in the context of the MMTV promoter, and this effect seems to be mediated by cooperative DNA binding(21.Brüggemeier U. Kalff M. Franke S. Scheidereit C. Beato M. Cell. 1991; 64: 565-572Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Replacement of the DNA binding domain of GR with the GAL4-DNA binding domain abolished cooperative binding to duplicated upstream activating sequence elements in contrast to functional synergy, which could still be observed(19.Baniahmad A. Muller M. Altschmied J. Renkawitz R. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 222: 155-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Functional synergy may involve two transcription factors simultaneously (and cooperatively) touching a target protein. Therefore, we designed a strategy for the search of GR-interacting factors, which upon isolation should enhance GR mediated in vitro transcription. Our strategy is based on the use of DNA-bound GRs to a double GRE to avoid interactions irrelevant to transcriptional control and to possibly increase the binding affinity to the target protein. Using this procedure we identified three GR-interacting proteins (GRIPs). Oligonucleotides 53/54 and 51/52 containing two GREs or a single GRE, respectively (20.Schüle R. Muller M. Kaltschmidt C.

Endoproteinase Lys-C was from Boehringer Mannheim; [α-32P]dATP was from Amersham Corp. Fast protein liquid chromatography system and columns for protein separation were used from Pharmacia Biotech Inc. Sykam HPLC (München, Germany) was used for peptide separation. HPLC columns and all solvents for automatic protein sequencing were from Applied Biosystems (Weiterstadt, Germany). PVDF Immobilon membrane was from Millipore (Eschborn, Germany). Dexamethasone was obtained from Sigma. All other chemicals were purchased from Merck. Human HeLa S3-cells were grown in spinner flasks in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% newborn calf serum, sodium pyrovate, glutamine, nonessential amino acids, vitamins, and antibiotics. Dexamethasone was added 45 min prior harvesting to a final concentration of 10−7M at a density of 8 × 105 cells/ml. Nuclear extracts were prepared by the method of Shapiro et al.(22.Shapiro D.J. Sharp P.A. Wahli W.W. Keller M.J. DNA. 1988; 7: 47-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. The ammoniumsulfate precipitated proteins were resuspended in buffer D (20 mM Hepes, pH 7.9, 100 mM KCl, 0.2 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, 20% (v/v) glycerol)(23.Dignam J.D. Lebowitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9164) Google Scholar). After extended dialyzation against buffer D the dialysate was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 4°C, and the supernatant was stored at −80°C. Crude nuclear protein extracts, bacterial protein extracts, or chromatographically purified fractions were precipitated as described elsewhere (24.Wessel D. Flügge U.I. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 138: 141-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (3191) Google Scholar) and separated on a 7% SDS-PAGE according to the method of Laemmli(25.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). Electroblotting was carried out for 2.75 h in a semidry blotting system with a constant current of 1 mA/cm2 gel using STGM buffer (0.06% SDS, 12.5 mM Tris, 50 mM glycine, 5% methanol) as electrode buffer. EMSA was performed according to SivaRaman et al.(26.SivaRaman L. Subramanian S. Thimmappaya B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 5914-5918Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The double-stranded oligonucleotide containing a single GRE was labeled with [α-32P]ATP using Klenow polymerase (Boehringer Mannheim) according to the supplier's directions. The Western blot analysis was carried out as follows. After separation of nuclear proteins by SDS-PAGE using a 7% polyacrylamide gel, the proteins were electroblotted to a PVDF membrane (Immobilon P, Millipore). After blocking, membranes were incubated overnight either with a 1:100 dilution of a polyclonal serum raised against hGR, or with a 1:200 dilution of an affinity-purified polyclonal antibody raised against Hbrm. Purified goat anti rabbit antibody was used as secondary antibody (Aurion, Germany). The immune complexes were visualized by the Immuno Gold detection kit according to the manufacturer (Aurion, Germany). For renaturation the PVDF membrane was transferred to HEMN buffer (20 mM Hepes, pH 7.4, 0.5 mM EDTA, 5 mM MgCl2, 150 mM NaCl) plus 0.1% Nonidet P-40 and 3 mM DTT, containing 6 M guanidine hydrochloride for denaturation. The guanidine hydrochloride was diluted out step-wise by adding same buffer without guanidine hydrochloride, allowing the proteins to partially renature. After renaturation the PVDF membrane was blocked at 4°C overnight in HEMN buffer + 5% nonfat dry milk (Carnation). The cross-linked far Southwestern analysis was performed as follows. 10 μg of partially purified GR fraction was incubated with 0.5 pmol of 32P-labeled double GRE oligonucleotide (dGRE) in the presence of 0.5-1 μg of poly(dI-dC) for 10 min at 4°C in binding buffer (10 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 60 mM KCl, 2.5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM EDTA, 5% (v/v) glycerol), followed by UV-cross-link at 286 nm for 5 min at room temperature. The cross-linked mixture had been diluted in 3 ml of HEMN buffer containing 1 μg/ml poly(dI-dC), 0.1 mM dexamethasone, 2 mM ATP, and 3 mM DTT. This solution was used as a probe for the renaturated proteins on the milk powder-blocked PVDF membrane. The incubation was carried out for 3 h under gentle shaking at room temperature in a plastic bag. Afterwards the PVDF membrane was washed twice for 10 min in HEMN buffer containing 0.1% Tween 20 and 3 mM DTT. The dry membrane was autoradiographed overnight. Crude nuclear protein extracts were separated first on anion exchange chromatography by loading 100-150 mg of protein on preparative Q-Sepharose column. The proteins were eluted by applying a linear gradient of 0.1 M NaCl to 1 M NaCl in QS buffer (20 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 20 mM KCl, 2 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, 10% (v/v) glycerol) for 90 min at a flow rate of 2 ml/min. The GR-binding activity of the fractions was assayed in cl-FSW experiments. Positive fractions containing GRIP 170 were pooled (in QS), diluted, adjusted to pH 6, and loaded on Mono S columns for cation exchange chromatography. The proteins were separated using a linear gradient from 0 M NaCl to 1 M NaCl in MS buffer (20 mM MES, pH 6.0, 20 mM KCl, 2 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, 10% (v/v) glycerol) for 50 min at a flow rate of 0.8 ml/min. The fractions were assayed with the cl-FSW, and the fractions expressing GRIP 170 activity were pooled, diluted, adjusted to pH 7.4, and applied on a heparin-Sepharose column. Protein separation was carried out with a linear gradient between 0 M NaCl and 0.5 M NaCl in HS buffer (25 mM Hepes, pH 7.6, 5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EGTA, 10% (v/v) glycerol) for 80 min at a flow rate of 2 ml/min. This gradient was followed by a one-step elution with 1.5 M salt under the same conditions. Fractions containing GRIP 170, as detected by cl-FSW, were pooled, diluted, and concentrated on Mono Q column by anion exchange chromatography. Therefore, the proteins were eluted by applying a steep linear gradient of 0.1-0.8 M NaCl in QS buffer for 40 min at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. This resulted in three positive fractions containing GRIP 170 as shown by cl-FSW. Protein digestion, reversed phase HPLC, and microsequencing of peptides were carried out as described by Eggert et al.(27.Eggert M. Radomski N. Linder D. Tripier D. Traub P. Jost E. Eur. J.

The gel was blotted to Immobilon membrane, which was stained with Coomassie Blue solution (0.2% Coomassie Blue, 0.5% acetic acid, 20% (v/v) methanol) and washed extensively (30% (v/v) methanol). The GRIP 170 bands were excised and analyzed by microsequencing. HeLa cell nuclear extract was prepared essentially after the method of Dignam et al.(23.Dignam J.D. Lebowitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9164) Google Scholar). Recombinant full-length human GR was expressed in Spodoptera frugiperda Sf9-cells by using the baculovirus expression system and isolated as described by Srinivasan and Thompson(28.Srinivasan G. Thompson B. Mol. Endocrinol. 1990; 4: 209-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). DNA templates were derived from p(C2AT)19 and contain either the full-length MMTV promoter from −240 comprising the HREs (240/380) linked to a 380-bp-long G-less cassette or a truncated MMTV promoter from −80 lacking the HREs (80/280) fused to a 280-bp-long cassette, serving as internal control. In vitro transcription was carried out as described(29.Möws C.C. Preiss T. Slater E.P. Cao X. Verrijzer C.P. van der Vliet P.C. Beato M. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1994; 51: 21-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), except that the final polyethylene glycol concentration was at 1% and poly(dI-dC) was used as competitor at a final concentration of 19 ng/μl. Template DNAs were preincubated with GR, GRIP 170, and in each case with an equal amount of the GRIP 170 buffer for 10 min on ice in a volume of 12.5 μl. Then HeLa cell nuclear extract (~40 μg), nucleotides were added to make a final volume of 25 μl, and transcription was carried out for 45 min at 30°C. Transcripts were treated as described(29.Möws C.C. Preiss T. Slater E.P. Cao X. Verrijzer C.P. van der Vliet P.C. Beato M. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1994; 51: 21-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), separated by 6.5% denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and visualized by autoradiography. Quantitation was made with a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics), and relative transcription was determined with respect to the transcription of the control template. To identify proteins that interact with GR molecules bound to two adjacent GRE sequences, we generated a probe consisting of a 32P-labeled dGRE UV-cross-linked to GR molecules. For this purpose we enriched GR from HeLa nuclear extracts by Q Sepharose fractionation. This results in a 30-fold enriched GR-fraction compared with the crude extract. The 97-kDa hGR was identified by Western blotting with a rabbit polyclonal antibody directed against a synthetic hGR peptide (amino acids 346-367). This fraction generated a strong band shift in an electrophoretic mobility shift assay (not shown), and GR could be UV-cross-linked to 32P-labeled GRE sequences. Binding and UV-cross-linking was GRE-specific since it was competable with unlabeled GRE DNA (not shown). This GR•32P-dGRE complex was used as a probe against HeLa nuclear proteins or, as a control, against Escherichia coli proteins, which were separated by SDS-PAGE and blotted on an Immobilon membrane. Fig. 1 shows an autoradiograph of such an experiment. Four bands migrating according to molecular masses of about 95, 115, 120, and 170 kDa can be detected. The 120-kDa band is difficult to resolve from the 115-kDa band, but extract fractionation (see below) clearly identifies and separates the 115- and 120-kDa bands. The 115-kDa band is seen in Southwestern experiments with the labeled GRE in the absence of proteins in the probe (Fig. 1, lane 10) and with almost any DNA sequence tested (not shown) and, therefore, seems to be an unspecific DNA-binding protein. The other bands, however, were specific as demonstrated by the fact that (i) bacterial proteins on the blot are not visualized (Fig. 1, odd-numbered lanes), (ii) specific GRE competition during probe cross-linking results in reduced 170-, 120-, and 95-kDa bands (Fig. 1, lane 4), (iii) whole nuclear extract, which contains low amounts of GR, labels the 110- and 95-kDa bands only, and (iv) bacterial extract cross-linked to DNA visualizes a single band (115 kDa), which is seen with the protein-free DNA probe alone (Fig. 1, lanes 8 and 10). Since the 170-kDa band most clearly showed specificity for the GR•32P-dGRE complex, we analyzed this protein. Although from our competition tests in the cross-linking reaction we knew that HeLa-GR was bound to the double GRE, we wanted to confirm this result with a glucocorticoid receptor from another source. We used human GR expressed with a baculovirus vector in insect cells. After purification by DNA affinity column (28.Srinivasan G. Thompson B. Mol. Endocrinol. 1990; 4: 209-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) we used this protein to generate a GR•32P-GRE probe. As seen in Fig. 2A the baculovirus-expressed GR identifies nearly the same bands as the HeLa-GR including the 170-kDa band. Previously, a protein in the range of 170 kDa has been shown to enhance the GR-mediated gene induction. This protein, Swi2 in yeast or Hbrm in humans, with a molecular mass of 180 kDa (30.Muchard C. Yaniv M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4279-4290Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar) is not the 170-kDa protein found here, since a Western blot with an antibody against Hbrm clearly labels a band migrating at a molecular mass position close to 200 kDa (Fig. 2B). Similarly, it was ruled out that one of the bands is GR, which is detectable with an antibody (Fig. 2B) but which elutes from Q-Sepharose with low salt (up to 220 mM), whereas the proteins labeled with the cross-linked GR•dGRE probe eluted at higher salt concentrations (380-530 mM; see below). Since the 170-kDa protein is identified by interaction with GR we refer to it as the “glucocorticoid receptor interacting protein 170” (GRIP 170). In order to further substantiate the specificity of the cross-linked probe we added a 25-fold excess of unlabeled cross-linked GR•dGRE to the incubation (Fig. 2C, lanes 1 and 3). Clearly, binding to the blotted proteins is inhibited. This was seen for unfractionated nuclear extract as well as for a Q-Sepharose fraction enriched for GRIP 170 (Fig. 2C, lanes 2 and 4). Since binding of the probe to GRIP 170 depends on the presence of GR, we wondered whether this binding requires GR bound to a double GRE or whether GR cross-linked to a single GRE (sGRE) might bind as well. Fig. 2C, lanes 5 and 6, shows the use of a GR•32P-sGRE complex with identical specific radioactive activity as the GR•32P-dGRE complex (Fig. 2C, lanes 1 and 2). Binding of the sGRE probe to GRIP 170 is not detectable; thus, efficient interaction with GRIP 170 requires GR bound to a double GRE. Toward the isolation and characterization of GRIP 170 we fractionated HeLa nuclear extract (Fig. 3) by Q-Sepharose chromatography and assayed for the presence of GRIP 170 with the HeLa GR•32P-dGRE probe. In contrast to the unfractionated nuclear extract, pooled QS fractions, eluted with 390-540 mM salt, contained only three out of the four labeled bands, GRIP 170, the 120-kDa protein, and the 95-kDa protein (Fig. 4A). This pool from 2 g of nuclear extract was further purified on a Mono S column, allowing the isolation of GRIP 170 containing fractions eluting between 350 and 450 mM salt. This cation exchange chromatography led to the separation of GRIP 170 from the two other interacting factors, since they show longer retention times (not shown). Further purification was achieved with heparin-Sepharose where GRIP 170 could not be eluted in a linear salt gradient between 0 and 500 mM salt. The following one-step elution at 1.5 M salt revealed the GRIP 170 activity. GRIP 170 was recovered in two fractions, which were diluted to a final salt concentration of 150 mM NaCl and concentrated on Mono Q column. The anion exchange chromatography leads to three positive fractions eluting between 400 and 475 mM salt, respectively. Chromatography by these four columns resulted in about 1000-fold purification of GRIP 170. The final purification was achieved by SDS-PAGE and subsequent blotting on a PVDF membrane. Fig. 4B shows the pattern of protein bands after Coomassie staining (lane 1). In parallel an aliquot was blotted after SDS-PAGE and incubated with baculovirus-expressed GR after UV-cross-linking to a 32P-dGRE oligonucleotide. Since the 170-kDa band was labeled (Fig. 4B, lane 2), we excised and analyzed the corresponding band on the PVDF membrane by N-terminal microsequencing. Additionally, a preparative SDS-PAGE was run, and after Coomassie staining the 170-kDa band was excised and digested by endoproteinase Lys-C. The resulting peptides were purified by reverse phase HPLC and sequenced in addition to the full-length protein. Three different sequences could be read and compared with the Swiss Prot computer data base. No homology to known protein sequences could be detected.Fig. 4Purification of GRIP 170. A, 100 μg of nuclear extract of dexamethasone-induced HeLa cells (N), 100 μg of bacterial extract (B), and 50 μg of a Q-Sepharose pool containing partially purified GRIP 170 were separated by SDS-PAGE and blotted on an Immobilon membrane. The membrane was probed with a cross-linked GR•32P-dGRE complex as described under “Experimental Procedures.” GRIP 170, GRIP 120, and GRIP 95 are pointed out. B, 35 μg of a Mono Q fraction containing highly enriched GRIP 170 were separated by SDS-PAGE and were blotted on an Immobilon membrane. The membrane was stained with Coomassie Blue (lane 1) or probed with a cross-linked GRbv•32P-dGRE complex (lane 2) as described under “Experimental Procedures.” C, EMSA with 32P-sGRE was carried out in the presence of bovine serum albumin (lane 1), with 0.6 μg of the GRIP 170 fraction (lanes 2 and 4) or with 0.35 μg of baculovirus-expressed GR (lanes 3 and 4). The retarded complex (GR) and the free probe (f.p.) are indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Since enhancement of receptor binding to DNA by receptor-interacting proteins has been demonstrated(13.Kupfer S.R. Marschke K.B. Wilson E.M. French F.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17519-17527Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we tested the purified GRIP 170 fraction in an EMSA with baculovirus-expressed GR (Fig. 4C). The addition of GRIP 170 neither causes a retarded band nor changes the intensity or position of the GR/DNA complex. Another step toward the functional analysis of a protein interacting with a transcription factor would be the use of an in vitro transcription system. Therefore, we prepared nuclear extracts from HeLa cells (23.Dignam J.D. Lebowitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9164) Google Scholar) that efficiently mediate induction by purified glucocorticoid receptor(29.Möws C.C. Preiss T. Slater E.P. Cao X. Verrijzer C.P. van der Vliet P.C. Beato M. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1994; 51: 21-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Human GR was expressed in insect cells with a baculovirus expression system and purified(28.Srinivasan G. Thompson B. Mol. Endocrinol. 1990; 4: 209-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). DNA templates used contain the full-length MMTV promoter up to position −240 bp of the transcriptional start site. This promoter region encompasses the natural GRE sequences (31.Scheidereit C. Geisse S. Westphal H.M. Beato M. Nature. 1983; 304: 749-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar) and was fused to a G-less cassette of 380 bp in length. As an internal control the reaction contained a second template with a truncated MMTV promoter, lacking the GRE sequences but containing the nuclear factor I and octamer transcription factor I binding sites. This promoter up to −80 bp was fused to a G-less cassette of 280 bp in length and provides a standard for basal gene transcription. In vitro transcription in the presence of radioactive nucleotides yielded a specific transcript for both templates (Fig. 5A). The upper band in each pair of bands represents read-through transcripts, which are almost not affected by the presence of GR or GRIP 170 fraction, whereas the lower band represents the correctly initiated transcripts for both DNA templates and is enhanced in the presence of GR with the full-length MMTV template. PhosphorImager quantitation was used to determine the relative transcription activity. Addition of the GRIP 170 fraction to the basal transcription reaction results, if in anything, in a marginal increase in transcription on both promoters (Fig. 5, A, lanes 2 and 4, and B). Similarly, no effect was seen with an adenovirus major late promoter as template (data not shown). Addition of baculovirus-expressed GR generates a transcriptional induction as expected(29.Möws C.C. Preiss T. Slater E.P. Cao X. Verrijzer C.P. van der Vliet P.C. Beato M. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1994; 51: 21-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The combined addition of GR and GRIP 170 fraction shows a synergistic increase in transcription (Fig. 5, A, lane 6, and B). This induction very likely was mediated by GRIP 170 because all of the reactions contained the same amount of GRIP 170 buffer, since a different fraction not containing GRIP 170 did not change transcription efficiency, and finally GRIP 170 “shoulder fractions” are less effective as the peak fraction (Table 1).Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab Here we identified three proteins (170, 120, and 95 kDa) that interact with a specifically designed glucocorticoid receptor probe. The probe consists of a 32P-labeled DNA harboring a double GRE with UV-cross-linked GR molecules. This probe serves several requirements. First, the GR can be easily and efficiently labeled. Second, the double GRE arrangement provides several DNA bound GR molecules, which increase the binding affinity to the target protein. This assumption is based on the finding that transactivation is stronger with two synergizing GREs as compared with individual GRE sequences and is confirmed by the failure of the GR-32P-sGRE probe to detect GRIP 170 on a blot. The GR•32P-dGRE probe also avoids detection of proteins interacting with the inactive, DNA-unbound GR such as hsp 90, p59, and others(1.Evans R.M. Science. 1988; 240: 889-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (6341) Google Scholar, 2.Beato M. Cell. 1989; 56: 335-344Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2852) Google Scholar, 32.Eggert M. Muller M. Renkawitz R. Baeuerle P. Inducible Gene Expression. Birkhäuser, Boston1994: 131-156Google Scholar). In addition, blotted HeLa GR was not detected, which may be explained by an incorrect folding after denaturation and renaturation or by the occupied dimerization domain of the dimerized DNA-bound GR molecules. Receptor interaction and transcriptional activation has been shown for factors comprising the TATA box-binding protein and its associated factors and TFIIB complexes(5.Ing N. Beekman J. Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.J. O'Malley B.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17617-17623Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8.Jacq X. Brou C. Lutz Y. Davidson I. Chambon P. Tora L. Cell. 1994; 79: 107-117Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). There is no direct proof that the GRIP 170 factor, binding to the GR•32P-dGRE probe, is identical to the factor within the GRIP 170 fraction causing the increase in GR-mediated in vitro transcription. Nevertheless, the co-purification of these two functions via four different columns and the reduced activity of GRIP 170 “shoulder fractions” argue for the transcriptional activity of GRIP 170. From the fact that the transcription extract is prepared from HeLa nuclei one would predict that GRIP 170 should be present and that the addition of GRIP 170 should not change the transcriptional activity. One explanation might be that GRIP 170 is limiting in the presence of added GR and, therefore, that additional amounts of GRIP 170 optimize the GR-mediated transcription. Comparison of blotted protein from nuclear extracts prepared from glucocorticoid-treated or from untreated cells did not reveal any hormone-dependent change in GRIP binding intensities (not shown). Our sequence analysis rules out the possibility that GRIP 170 might belong to the TAF or TFII group as far as these are known. Similarly, we would rule out that GRIP 170 belongs to the group of factors associated with the inactive GR, such as hsp 90, hsp 59, or hsp 70(33.Rexin M. Busch W. Gehring U.

Receptor interaction and/or potentiation of receptor function has been shown for proteins involved in alterations of chromatin structure or function(14.Yoshinaga S.K. Peterson C.L. Hershkowitz I. Yamamoto K.R. Science. 1992; 258: 1598-1604Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar, 15.Baniahmad C. Nawaz Z. Baniahmad A. Gleeson M.A.G. Tsai M.-J. O'Malley B.W. Mol.

Crabtree G.R. Nature. 1993; 366: 170-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar). Again, the GRIP 170 sequence is different from these proteins (Swi, Snf, or Spt6). Other factors have been shown to increase the receptor binding affinity to DNA by in vitro binding tests. Glucocorticoid and androgen receptors require RAF 130 for optimal DNA binding(13.Kupfer S.R. Marschke K.B. Wilson E.M. French F.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17519-17527Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); for the estrogen receptor hsp 70 and 48- and 45-kDa proteins increase the DNA association rate(12.Landel C.C. Kushner P.J. Greene G.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 1407-1419PubMed Google Scholar); and in the case of GR low molecular weight factors have been seen with a similar function(38.Cavanaugh A.H. Simons S.S. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1994; 48: 433-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Such an activity was not seen with GR and GRIP 170. Receptor-interacting proteins with molecular weight comparable with that of GRIP 170 have been identified in conjunction with the estrogen receptor and named ERAP 160 or RIP 160(10.Halachmi S. Marden E. Martin G. MacKay H. Abbondanza C. Brown M. Science. 1994; 264: 1455-1458Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar, 11.Cavaillés V. Dauvois S. Danielian P.S. Parker M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10009-10013Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). ERAP 160 and RIP 160 may be identical and bind to the estrogen receptor only in the presence of estrogen. For GR such a ligand-dependent binding would not be detectable, since GR will be activated through the purification procedure(39.Tsai S.Y. Srinivasan G. Allan G.F. Thompson E.B. O'Malley B. Tsai M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 17055-17061Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 40.Schmitt J. Stunnenberg H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 2673-2681Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Thus, based on the molecular weight, GRIP 170 could be similar or identical to ERAP 160/RIP 160. For the GRIP 170 fraction we found a GR-dependent transcriptional increase in the in vitro transcription assay, an activity not identified for previously described receptor-associated or interacting factors (10.Halachmi S. Marden E. Martin G. MacKay H. Abbondanza C. Brown M. Science. 1994; 264: 1455-1458Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar, 11.Cavaillés V. Dauvois S. Danielian P.S. Parker M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Although in vitro binding to GR depends on the presence of two GREs, it remains to be shown, whether GRIP 170 is required to mediate synergy or to mediate the intrinsic induction from a single GRE in vivo. We thank Brad E. Thompson (Galveston) for the baculovirus GR expression vector, Moshe Yaniv (Paris) for antibodies against Hbrm, and E. Schmitt and L.

Engagement of the TCR·CD3 complex results in a range of cellular responses from proliferation and clonal expansion to induction of tolerance and, in some instances, apoptotic cell death(2.Blackman M.

The type of response is determined by the developmental stage of the T cell, the affinity of the TCR-antigen interaction, and whether or not there is simultaneous engagement of costimulatory receptors(2.Blackman M. Kappler J. Marrack P. Science. 1990; 248: 1335-1341Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar, 3.Schwartz R.H. Science. 1990; 248: 1349-1356Crossref PubMed Scopus (1795) Google Scholar).Upon recognition of antigen, a complex and intricately choreographed set of signals is transmitted to the interior of the T cell. The initial early events observed include tyrosine phosphorylation of a number of cellular substrates, and phospholipase C (PLC)-mediated hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate(4.Altman A. Coggeshall K.M. Mustelin T. Adv. Immunol. 1990; 48: 227-360Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The latter yields inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol, second messengers responsible for mobilization of intracellular calcium and activation of protein kinase C, respectively (4.Altman A. Coggeshall K.M. Mustelin T. Adv. Immunol. 1990; 48: 227-360Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Of the PLC isoforms expressed in T cells, only γ1 has been shown to require tyrosine phosphorylation for its activation(5.Nishibe S. Wahl M.I. Hernandez-Sotomayor S.M. Tonks N.K. Rhee S.G. Carpenter G. Science. 1990; 250: 1253-1256Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar), while the β isoforms are activated as a result of interaction with the GTP-bound α subunit of the heterotrimeric class of G proteins belonging to the Gq family(6.Sternweis P.C.

However, considerable evidence does exist supporting the contention that G proteins are involved in T cell activation(11.Harnett M. Rigley K. Immunol. Today. 1992; 13: 482-486Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). A number of biochemical events triggered by TCR·CD3-induced activation are ablated by agents that modulate the action of G proteins. Pertinent to this is the ability of cholera toxin to inhibit the cellular proliferation and intracellular Ca2+ mobilization that is mediated by anti-CD3 antibody treatment of T cells(12.Imboden J.B.

Smrcka A.V. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 502-506Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), in T cell signaling via the TCR·CD3 complex. Our results reveal 1) TCR·CD3-mediated GTP exchange within Gαq/11, 2) physical association between Gαq/11 and CD3, 3) tyrosine kinase dependent-TCR·CD3-mediated G protein activation, 4) TCR·CD3-mediated PLC β activation and 5) Gα11 modulation of the tyrosine phosphorylation of the CD3 ∊ and ζ chains.MATERIALS AND METHODSCellsJurkat T cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 2 mML-glutamine (Mediatech, Washington D. C.) and 5% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT) at 37°C in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere. Neo Jurkat, Jurkat Gα11 wild type (Wt), and Jurkat Gα11 G208A transfectants were cultured as above except for the inclusion of 500 μg/ml geneticin (Life Technologies, Inc., Grand Island, NY) to maintain selection. Human T lymphocytes were purified from peripheral blood mononuclear cells essentially as described previously(16.Tsoukas C.D. Landgraf B. Bentin J. Valentine M. Lotz M. Vaughan J.H. Carson D.A. J. Immunol. 1985; 135: 1719-1723PubMed Google Scholar). Human thymic specimens were obtained from pediatric patients undergoing corrective cardiac surgery. Thymocyte suspensions were prepared by being minced through steel mesh then subjected to density gradient centrifugation on Histopaque-1077 (Sigma).Site-directed MutagenesisThe cDNA clone encoding the Gα11 protein plus 275 bases of the 3′-untranslated region, was isolated from a human thymocyte cDNA library using a Gα11-specific probe(17.Kabouridis P.S. Waters S.T. Escobar S. Stanners J. Tsoukas C.D. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1995; 144: 45-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), and subcloned into the EcoRI site of the Bluescript vector (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The conversion of glycine 208 to alanine in the Gα11 protein (G208A construct) was performed in the pSelect mutagenesis vector (Promega, Madison WI). The cloned Gα11 cDNA was introduced into the XbaI and HindIII polylinker sites present in pSelect, in a 5′ to 3′ orientation regarding the T7 transcription direction. The mutagenesis oligonucleotide 5′-GATGTGGGGGCCCAGCGGTCG-3′ was built in the sense orientation, and the mutagenesis was performed following the manufacturer's instructions. Individual clones that incorporated the mutation were identified with restriction analysis utilizing the newly generated ApaI site. The site of mutation from several clones was reconfirmed by nucleotide sequencing using the Sequenase kit (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). Mutated Gα11 clones in pSelect were digested with HindIII, and the linearized constructs were treated with Klenow fragment (Promega). Consequently, the DNA was digested with KpnI, and the gene encoding Gα11 was ligated in the KpnI/SmaI sites of the PCMV4 expression vector(18.Andersson S. Davis D.L. Dahlback H. Jornvall H. Russell D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8222-8229Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Several PCMV4/Gα11 clones were identified with restriction enzyme analysis, and the 5′ and 3′ PCMV4/Gα11 junctions were sequenced. All restriction enzymes were obtained from Promega.TransfectionsJurkat cells were double-transfected with 20 μg of the empty PCMV4 vector plus 0.2 μg of SV2neo (provided by G. Rhodes, University of California, Davis) henceforth called “neo” or with an equivalent amount of PCMV4 containing the mutated Gα11 plus 0.2 μg of SV2neo henceforth called “G208A”. For each transfection, 10 × 106 cells were washed twice in fetal calf serum-free RPMI 1640 medium, and resuspended in 0.5 ml of ice-cold medium. XhoI linearized PCMV4 and EcoRI linearized SV2neo DNA constructs were added to the cell suspension. Transfection was performed by electroporation (Bio-Rad) at 960 μF/250 V. Cells were allowed to recover in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal calf serum in a 5% CO2 incubator for 48 h. Selection and maintenance of stable transfectants was accomplished by the addition of 750 μg/ml geneticin (Life Technologies, Inc.) in the culture.Northern BlottingThe expression levels of the gene encoding Gα11 in the various transfectants were assessed by Northern blotting analysis. One μg of poly(A)+ mRNA was isolated (using poly(A)Trak; Promega) from Jurkat cells that had been transfected with the various constructs as described above. The RNA was then fractionated in 1.2% agarose gel and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane using capillary action. The membrane was blocked for 4 h at 42°C with blocking buffer (50% deionized formamide, 5 × Denhart's solution, and 10 μg/ml tRNA), 1 μg of [32P]CTP labeled (nick translation kit, Amersam Corp.) Gα11 cDNA probe was added, and incubation was continued for an additional 16 h at 42°C. The membrane was washed two times in 2 × SSC buffer (20 × SSC: 175.3 g/liter NaCl, 88.2 g/liter sodium citrate, pH 7) and two times in 0.2 × SSC buffer at 65°C and then exposed to Kodak XAR film.Flow CytometryTransfected Jurkat cells, 5 × 105, were incubated with saturating amounts of anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody OKT3 or with isotype (IgG2a) antibody control RPC5 on ice for 30 min. Excess antibody was removed by washing the cells twice with RPMI 1640 medium. Subsequently, 5 μg/ml fluorescein-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Jackson Laboratories, West Grove, PA) was added, and samples were again incubated for 30 min on ice. After extensive washing the cells were analyzed in a flow cytometer (FACStar; Becton-Dickinson, San Jose, CA).AntibodiesThe anti-CD3 mAb OKT3 was purified from ascites produced from hybridoma CRL 8001 obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD), while anti-CD3 ∊peptide antiserum used for Western blotting was purchased from Organon Teknika Corp. (West Chester, PA). The anti-Gα GTP binding motif antibody, NEI-800, was obtained from DuPont NEN. Purified mouse myeloma proteins (IgG2a) UPC-10 and RPC5 were obtained from Bionetics (Charleston, SC). Anti-Gβ antibody was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-TCR mAb WT31 was from Sanbio (Holland). The anti-Gαq/11 and anti-Gα16 anti-peptide antibodies used for Western blotting were kindly provided by Dr. Gary Johnson (National Jewish Center, Denver, CO). Anti-Gαq/11 antibody 946, anti-Gαs antibody 1190 and anti-Gαi2, utilized for immunoprecipitation, were kindly provided by Drs. David Manning and Paul Butkerait (University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia). Anti-ζ peptide antiserum was generously provided by Dr. Richard Klausner (NIH, Bethesda, MD). The anti-phosphotyrosine mAb PY20 was kindly provided by Dr. Bart Sefton (Salk Institute, La Jolla, CA). The anti-ZAP-70 antiserum was a generous gift of Dr. Amnon Altman (La Jolla Institute for Allergy and Immunology, La Jolla, CA). Peptide corresponding to that used to generate the NEI-800 antisera was synthesized at the University of Pennsylvania Protein Chemistry Laboratory. Goat anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase and rabbit anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase were purchased from Jackson Laboratories (West Grove, PA).Immunoprecipitation and Western BlottingTransfected Jurkat cells or human thymocytes were lysed in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mM NaCl, 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 0.4 mM EDTA, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), 5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 5 μg/ml pepstatin A). Following removal of nuclei and other cellular debris (12,000 × g for 30 min at 4°C), the lysates were precleared with 5 μg/ml RPC5 myeloma (IgG2a) and protein A-Sepharose (Sigma) (30 μl/sample of a 1:1 slurry), and used to immunoprecipitate the CD3 ∊chain or the TCR α/β dimer with 5 μg/ml monoclonal antibodies OKT3 or WT31, respectively. Immune complexes were precipitated with the addition of protein A-Sepharose (30 μl/sample of a 1:1 slurry), resolved on an 11% denaturing acrylamide gel, and transferred to PVDF membrane (Gelman Sciences, Ann Arbor, MI). Membranes were incubated for 2 h at room temperature in TBST buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20) containing 5% non-fat dry milk, 1% bovine serum albumin (NFDM blocking buffer) to eliminate nonspecific binding. Blocked membranes were incubated with either anti-Gαq/11 1:300, anti-Gα 16 1:300, anti-Gβ 1:300, anti-ζ 1:500, anti-∊ 1:500, anti-ZAP-70 1:1000 or NRS 1:300, all diluted in 50% NFDM blocking buffer, for 2 h at room temperature or overnight at 4°C. Membranes were rinsed, washed once for 15 min, three times for 10 min in TBST containing 500 mM NaCl, followed by incubation with goat anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase at 1:5000 in 50% NFDM blocking buffer for 1 h at room temperature. Membranes were washed as above except that two additional 10-min washes were performed followed by visualization utilizing KPL's (Gaithersburg, MD) chemiluminescence or TMB peroxidase (Fig. 7B, middle panel) substrate.Tyrosine PhosphorylationJurkat transfectants were stimulated with OKT3 or control antibody (10 μg/ml) in a total volume of 250 μl of RPMI 1640 (no fetal calf serum). The antibody was allowed to bind for 30 min on ice, and stimulation was initiated by incubation in a 37°C water bath for 2 min. Immediately following this incubation, 1 ml of ice-cold medium was added, and the cells were collected by centrifugation at 4°C for 2 min at 3,000 × g. The cells were lysed in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer containing 1 mM sodium orthovanadate, and nuclei and other debris were removed by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 30 min at 4°C. Where appropriate, lysates were precleared with the addition of protein A-Sepharose (25 μl of a 1:1 slurry). The ζchain and ZAP-70 were specifically immunoprecipitated by incubation of the sample with 2 μl of anti-ζ or anti-ZAP-70 antisera for 2 h at 4°C with constant end-over-end rotation followed by addition of protein A-Sepharose (25 μl of a 1:1 slurry). CD3 ∊was immunoprecipitated similarly with OKT3 (2 μg), followed by incubation with rabbit anti-mouse Ig (2 μg) and protein A-Sepharose (25 μl of a 1:1 slurry). The precipitated protein complexes were resolved on SDS-PAGE, transferred to a PVDF membrane, blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin, 1% ovalbumin in TBST and analyzed by Western blotting with anti-PY20 (1 μg/ml) as described above.Plasma Membrane PreparationMembranes were prepared from Jurkat T cells or human peripheral blood T cells as described previously(19.Prpic V. Green K.C. Blackmore P.F. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 1382-1385Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Membranes were resuspended in HEDG buffer (50 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 1 mM EGTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol) containing 100 mM NaCl and protease inhibitors (1 mM PMSF, 5 μg/ml pepstatin A, 5 μg/ml leupeptin). Protein concentration was determined using a modified Bradford reagent (Bio-Rad) and bovine serum albumin as a standard.Photolabeling of Membrane ProteinsG protein α subunits were photolabeled with [α-32P]GTP, 800 Ci/mmol (DuPont NEN), utilizing the method of Offermanns et al.(20.Offermanns S. Schultz G. Rosenthal W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3365-3368Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with slight modification. Briefly, Jurkat T cell membranes (50-100 μg protein/assay) were incubated for 30 min on ice with photolabeling buffer (25 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 1 mM EGTA, 10% glycerol, 100 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 5 mM MnCl2, 1 mM PMSF, 5 μg/ml pepstatin A, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 2.5 μM ATP) containing 30 μM GDP in the presence or absence of various reagents as indicated in the figure legends. Samples were then incubated with or without antibody at 30°C for 3 min followed by the addition of 0.05 μM [α-32P]GTP and a second 3-min incubation at 30°C. The final reaction volume was 75 μl. The reaction was terminated by rapidly cooling the samples on ice, followed by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 10 min at 4°C to pellet the membrane fraction. The supernatant was removed and the pellet resuspended in nucleotide-free photolabeling buffer containing 2 mM dithiothreitol. Each membrane sample was transferred to a section of Parafilm overlaying a glass plate on ice, and the samples were irradiated for 12 min in the dark with a 254 nM, 115 volt, 160 mA UV light source at a distance of 3 cm (UVP Inc., San Gabriel, CA). Following UV cross-linking, the samples were centrifuged at 4°C to pellet the membrane fraction, the supernatant was aspirated, and 30-80 μl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer (62.5 mM Tris, pH 7.0, 10% glycerol, 2% SDS, 5%β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.02% bromphenol blue) were added. Each sample was then subjected to SDS-PAGE analysis. Genistein, ATP, GDP, and GTPγS were obtained from Sigma. Samples were resolved on 10.5% SDS-PAGE gels as described previously(21.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206016) Google Scholar). Gels were either dried or transferred to a PVDF membrane (Gelman Sciences, Ann Arbor, MI) according to the manufacture's protocol and then subjected to autoradiography with intensification at −70°C for various lengths of time. Autoradiographic data were quantitated utilizing a Molecular Dynamics Personal Densitometer (Sunnyvale, CA).Immunoprecipitation of [α-32P]GTP-labeled ProteinsJurkat membranes (150 μg/condition) were labeled with [α-32P]GTP as described above with the following modifications: 3000 Ci/mmol [α-32P]GTP was utilized. Following reaction termination the pelleted membrane fraction was solubilized in Triton X-100 lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 150 mM NaCl, 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.4 mM EDTA, 1 mM PMSF, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml pepstatin A), containing 1 mM sodium orthovanadate for 30 min on ice. The clarified lysates were precleared as described above and then incubated with the indicated anti-Gα antibodies (1:15) overnight at 4°C with constant end-over-end rotation followed by addition of protein A-Sepharose (25 μl of a 1:1 slurry) and continued incubation for 1 h. The supernatant fluid was removed and incubated with a second aliquot of protein A-Sepharose for 1 h, after which the two protein A-Sepharose pellets were combined, washed three times with Triton X-100 wash buffer (contains 10% of the detergent of the lysis buffer), and once with 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl followed by Cherenkov counting.IP3 Measurement75-80 μg of membrane protein in 200 μl of photolabeling buffer containing 10 μM ATP and 10 μM GDP were incubated on ice for 30 min in the presence of 0.1 μM GTP and 10 μg/ml UPC-10 or OKT3 or 100 μM GTPγS alone. The samples were then incubated in a 37°C water bath for 5 min followed by sample preparation and analysis as outlined in the DuPont NEN inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate 3H-radioreceptor assay kit.RESULTSActivation of G Proteins upon TCR·CD3 PerturbationLigand occupancy of G protein-coupled receptors initiates the exchange of bound GDP for GTP, thus activating the α subunit of the responding G protein and dissociating the trimer(22.Gilman A.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 615-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (4682) Google Scholar). We speculated that if G protein activation is coupled to TCR·CD3-mediated T cell activation, then engagement of the antigen receptor complex should induce nucleotide exchange. Incubation of purified Jurkat membranes with [α-32P]GTP, in the presence of anti-CD3 ∊antibody OKT3, markedly enhances the exchange of nucleotide among several associated proteins (Fig. 1A, Jurkat, compare OKT3 - and +). These proteins have apparent molecular masses of approximately 68, 50, 42, 32, and 18 kDa, respectively. The 50-kDa band is quite broad and likely represents more than one protein within a range of approximately 48-54 kDa. Stimulation with anti-CD3 ∊antibody 64.1 gave similar results (data not shown). To address the possibility that this response may have been peculiar to the Jurkat T cell line, we isolated plasma membranes from purified peripheral blood T cells and performed a similar experiment. Addition of OKT3 to peripheral blood T cell membranes induces a similar pattern of nucleotide exchange (Fig. 1A, PBL, OKT3 - and +).Fig. 1Anti-CD3 ∊ antibodies stimulate [α-32P]GTP exchange in membrane-associated G proteins. A, purified Jurkat plasma membranes (Jurkat) or human peripheral blood T cell membranes (PBL) were incubated in photolabeling buffer in the absence (-) or presence (+) of 10 μg/ml OKT3. Samples without OKT3 received 10 μg/ml isotype control antibody, UPC-10. Incubation was for 30 min on ice prior to [α-32P]GTP labeling (see “Materials and Methods”). For PBL membranes, the dried gel was exposed for 4 days, Jurkat for 2 days. OKT3-enhanced [α-32P]GTP binding in Jurkat membranes is representative of 50 separate experiments, while PBL membrane labeling is a single experiment. B, Jurkat membranes were treated with (+) or without(-) OKT3 as described above. The resulting gel was transferred to PVDF membrane, exposed to autoradiography (A) for 48 h, and then Western blotted with the indicated antibodies (WB). Control Ab is an unrelated anti-peptide antibody. Results represent two replicate experiments. C, Jurkat membranes were preincubated on ice for 30 min in photolabeling buffer with or without the indicated amount of anti-Gα GTP binding motif antibody or antibody that had been previously neutralized with specific peptide. The samples were then incubated an additional 30 min on ice in the absence(-) or presence (+) of OKT3 (samples without OKT3 received UPC-10) prior to [α-32P]GTP labeling. Dried gels were exposed for 48 h. Two independent experiments are shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The identity of the proteins displaying GTP binding upon TCR·CD3 engagement is unknown. However, the protein(s) migrating at 42/43 kDa have a molecular mass consistent with that of α subunits belonging to the Gq family(23.Amatruda T.T. Steele D.A. Slepak V.Z. Simon M.I. Proc. Natl.

Sci. 1992; 17: 502-506Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), we decided to focus our attention on the further analysis of the 42/43-kDa band. Jurkat cell membranes were stimulated with antibody OKT3 or control antibody, followed by photolabeling with [α-32P]GTP. The samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a PVDF membrane. As seen in Fig. 1B, incubation with OKT3 induced enhanced [α-32P]GTP binding. Western blotting of that membrane with anti-Gαq/11 or Gα16 anti-peptide antibodies, reveals the presence of these Gα subunits and their comigration with the [α-32P]GTP-labeled proteins comprising the 42/43-kDa band (Fig. 1B). To determine the nucleotide specificity of this band, we performed competition assays utilizing excess cold adenine or guanine triphosphate. We stimulated Jurkat cell membranes with OKT3 in the presence of increasing concentrations of cold ATP or GTP that were in excess of the amounts present in the photolabeling buffer (2.5 μMversus 0.05 μM, respectively). While OKT3-induced GTP labeling of the 42/43-kDa band remains strong, even in the presence of a 1000-fold molar excess of ATP, labeling in the presence of a 100-fold excess of cold GTP dramatically inhibits the signal, and a 250-fold excess nearly abolishes it completely (Fig. 2, upper panel). Densitometric analysis of the resulting autoradiogram is shown in Fig. 2, lower panel.Fig. 2Specificity of guanine nucleotide binding. A, Jurkat plasma membranes were incubated in photolabeling buffer for 30 min on ice in the absence(-) or presence (+) of 10 μg/ml OKT3 (samples without OKT3 received 10 μg/ml isotype control antibody, UPC-10) prior to the addition of increasing quantities of cold nucleotides as indicated. The cold ATP and GTP added was in addition to that already present in the photolabeling buffer (2.5 μMversus 0.05 μM, respectively). The [α-32P]GTP-labeling assay was performed, and dried gels were exposed for 48 h. The data are representative of three independent experiments.

https://openalex.org/W2072906264,"To clarify the role of the Shc-Grb2-Sos trimer in the oncogenic signaling of the point mutation-activated HER-2/neu receptor tyrosine kinase (named p185), we interfered with the protein-protein interactions in the Shc•Grb2•Sos complex by introducing Grb2 mutants with deletions in either amino- (ΔN-Grb2) or carboxyl- (ΔC-Grb2) terminal SH3 domains into B104-1-1 cells derived from NIH3T3 cells expressing the point mutation-activated HER-2/neu. We found that the transformed phenotypes of the B104-1-1 cells were largely reversed by the ΔN-Grb2. The effect of the ΔC-Grb2 was much weaker. Biochemical analysis showed that the ΔN-Grb2 was able to associate Shc but not p185 or Sos, while the ΔC-Grb2 bound to Shc, p185, and Sos. The p185-mediated Ras activation was severely inhibited by the ΔN-Grb2 but not the ΔC-Grb2. Taken together, these data demonstrate that interruption of the interaction between Shc and the endogenous Grb2 by the ΔN-Grb2 impairs the oncogenic signaling of the activated p185, indicating that (i) the ΔN-Grb2 functions as a strong dominant-negative mutant, and (ii) Shc/Grb2/Sos pathway plays a major role in mediating the oncogenic signal of the activated p185. Unlike the ΔN-Grb2, ΔC-Grb2 appears to be a relatively weak dominant-negative mutant, probably due to its ability to largely fulfill the biological functions of the wild-type Grb2. To clarify the role of the Shc-Grb2-Sos trimer in the oncogenic signaling of the point mutation-activated HER-2/neu receptor tyrosine kinase (named p185), we interfered with the protein-protein interactions in the Shc•Grb2•Sos complex by introducing Grb2 mutants with deletions in either amino- (ΔN-Grb2) or carboxyl- (ΔC-Grb2) terminal SH3 domains into B104-1-1 cells derived from NIH3T3 cells expressing the point mutation-activated HER-2/neu. We found that the transformed phenotypes of the B104-1-1 cells were largely reversed by the ΔN-Grb2. The effect of the ΔC-Grb2 was much weaker. Biochemical analysis showed that the ΔN-Grb2 was able to associate Shc but not p185 or Sos, while the ΔC-Grb2 bound to Shc, p185, and Sos. The p185-mediated Ras activation was severely inhibited by the ΔN-Grb2 but not the ΔC-Grb2. Taken together, these data demonstrate that interruption of the interaction between Shc and the endogenous Grb2 by the ΔN-Grb2 impairs the oncogenic signaling of the activated p185, indicating that (i) the ΔN-Grb2 functions as a strong dominant-negative mutant, and (ii) Shc/Grb2/Sos pathway plays a major role in mediating the oncogenic signal of the activated p185.

In order to examine the importance of cargo in this packaging reaction, we developed an in vitro assay that quantifies vesicle formation based on segregation of targeting molecules. Here we document that endoplasmic reticulum devoid of cargo proteins is competent in the formation and release of targeting molecule-containing vesicles in a fashion indistinguishable from its normal counterpart.

A system comprising these factors and GTP support the inclusion of cargo proteins such as glycosylated pro-α-factor (gpαf) into 60-mm vesicles that bud from the ER (Barlowe et al., 1994). In addition to cargo proteins, ER-derived vesicles contain synaptobrevin-like proteins such as Bet1p, Bos1p, and Sec22p (Barlowe et al., 1994; Lian and Ferro-Novick., 1993; Rexach et al., 1994), the targeting molecules that function as specificity factors by serving as the docking “v-SNARE” in the consumption of vesicles by the Golgi apparatus (Rothman, 1994). The absence of ER resident proteins in these transport vesicles suggests that cargo proteins are faithfully sorted from other ER lumenal proteins (Rexach et al., 1994). Thus, the COPII proteins plus GTP are sufficient to provide the cytosolic information necessary to reproduce an authentic vesicle budding event. endoplasmic reticulum soluble NSF (N-ethylmaleimide sensitive factor) attachment protein receptor vesicle-SNARE cycloheximide glycosylated pro-α-factor. In contrast to advances in the biochemical dissection of cytosolic requirements for vesicle transport, the molecular events within the ER lumen that are responsible for segregating and packaging targeting and cargo molecules into the vesicles are not well understood. Only two proteins known to play a role in post-translocational aspects of secretion are lumenally oriented. Sec12p is a type II membrane glycoprotein with a C-terminal domain of approximately 100 residues in the ER lumen. The cytosolic domain catalyzes nucleotide dissociation on Sar1p which serves to initiate the budding process (Barlowe and Schekman, 1993). In contrast, the lumenal domain is dispensable; truncated Sec12p that retains only the N-terminal and membrane anchor domains is sufficient to sustain normal yeast cell growth. BiP (Kar2p), in addition to its role in polypeptide translocation (Vogel et al., 1990; Sanders et al., 1992), is required in the quality control decision to segregate incompletely folded polypeptides away from cargo that is ready for transport (Gething and Sambrook, 1992). However, given the defect in α-factor precursor translocation in kar2 mutant membranes, it has not been possible to test a role for Kar2p in the packaging of folded proteins into transport vesicles. In order to determine if the sorting and packaging of cargo proteins is an essential prelude to vesicle budding, we developed an assay that measures the distribution of targeting molecules rather than that of gpαf. By monitoring the release of Bet1p- and Sec22p-containing vesicles from ER membranes isolated from cells treated with cycloheximide or carrying a temperature-sensitive allele of kar2, we demonstrated that neither the packaging of cargo proteins nor Kar2p function are required to form COPII vesicles. Strain RSY607 (leu2-3, 112 ura3-52 PEP4::URA3 MATa), which harbors the plasmid pDA 6300 (for overexpressing gpαf in order to enhance its detection in isolated vesicles; see Fig. 2), and RSY598 (kar2-159 ura3-52 ade2-101 PEP4::URA3 MATa) were used to prepare ER membranes, as described (Barlowe et al., 1994) except that RSY598 was grown at 17°C. To prepare cargo-depleted ER membranes or CHX-treated cytosol, we cultured RSY607 pDA6300 in YP medium (1% Bacto-yeast extract, 2% Bacto-peptone (Difco)) and 2% dextrose to OD600 = 3 and cycloheximide (Sigma) was added to a final concentration of 50 μg/ml. Cells were incubated for 1 h at 30°C to deplete secretory proteins before ER membranes were isolated or crude cytosol was prepared by lysis of cells in a bead beaker (Rexach et al., 1994). For crude cytosol prepared from cells grown under normal conditions, we cultured RSY607 in YP medium and 2% dextrose to OD600 = 4 before cells were subjected to liquid nitrogen lysis (Barlowe et al., 1994). COPII proteins were purified as described (Barlowe et al., 1994). Vesicle budding measuring secretion of exogenously introduced 35S-labeled gpαf was performed as described (Barlowe et al., 1994). To detect budding by assay of Bet1p and Sec22p, we used ER fractions mixed with the indicated reagents and incubated at 20°C for 30 min, but without the translocation of radioactive α-factor precursor. ER-derived vesicles were separated from the fast sedimenting ER by centrifugation and were analyzed for the presence of the membrane proteins Bet1p, Sec22p and Sec61p. To detect the lumenal protein Kar2p within the vesicles, we centrifuged reaction products in a Beckman TLA100.3 rotor at 100 000 × g for 15 min to collect vesicles; Kar2p released by nonspecific rupture of the ER membrane remained in the supernatant fraction. Reaction products and vesicles collected by ultracentrifugation were resolved on 12.5% polyacrylamide gels and transferred to Millipore Immobilon-P membrane. Sections of membrane were probed with anti-Bet1p (1:250), anti-Sec22p (1:250), anti-Sec61p (1:4000), and anti-Kar2p (1:5000) antibodies. Membrane-bound antibodies were visualized by the enhanced chemiluminescence method (ECL kit, Amersham Corp.) or 125I-Protein A (ICN). 125I-Protein A-decorated membranes were exposed to a phosphoscreen and analyzed on a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). The percentage release of each protein was calculated by comparing the amount in the reaction products (Bet1p and Sec61p) or sedimented vesicles (Kar2p) with the total signal in an unfractionated reaction. ER-derived vesicles produced in vitro were isolated by flotation on Nycodenz density gradients as described (Barlowe et al., 1994). For each condition, a 0.5-ml budding reaction was performed and vesicles that migrated to the 25-15% (w/v) position on density gradients were collected by ultracentrifugation. The collected vesicles were dissolved in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sample buffer and resolved on 15% polyacrylamide gels. For immunoblots, one-eighth of each sample was loaded per lane; for silver-stained gel analysis, one-third of each sample was loaded. Vesicle budding was monitored in the absence of exogenously introduced radioactive cargo proteins by quantifying the segregation of Bet1p from the ER. In a typical reaction, 30% of Bet1p budded in vesicles from the ER in a COPII protein- and GTP-dependent manner (Fig. 1, columns 1, 5, and 6, black bars). Omission of any one of the purified COPII proteins prevented Bet1p release (Fig. 1, columns 2-4, black bars). In order to isolate the Bet1p-containing compartment for biochemical analysis, the reaction product was subjected to isopynic gradient centrifugation in Nycodenz step gradients(Barlowe et al., 1994). Bet1p was detected at the 25-15% (w/v) Nycodenz interface, suggesting this targeting molecule was associated with a membrane compartment with a buoyant density similar to that of ER-derived vesicles (Barlowe et al., 1994; Rexach et al., 1994) (Fig. 2a, lane 2). The endogenous soluble cargo protein gpαf was detected in the same fraction, and the appearance of both proteins was dependent on the presence of the three purified fractions and GTP (Fig. 2a, compare lanes 1 and 2). In addition, this fraction exhibited a polypeptide pattern similar to that of ER-derived vesicles previously described (Barlowe et al., 1994; Rexach et al., 1994) (Fig. 2b, lane 2). The absence of ER resident proteins Kar2p (BiP) and Sec61p in either the crude reaction product (Fig. 1, hatched and white bars) or in gradient-purified vesicles (Fig. 2a, lane 2) indicated that this budding reaction enriched for targeting proteins, and ruled out the possibility that the Bet1p-containing compartment was produced by nonspecific fragmentation of the ER membrane. These results demonstrate that the import of exogenous α-factor precursor is not required for Bet1p packaging. Similar results were obtained in evaluating the packaging of Sec22p, another v-SNARE molecule (Fig. 3).Fig. 3Cargo-depleted ER membranes produce Sec22p-containing vesicles. ER membranes prepared from mock (lanes 1-3) or CHX-treated (lanes 4-6) cells were tested for the packaging of Sec22p into vesicles.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Vesicle formation by the ER involves the selection of cargo proteins and concentration of these molecules at discrete sites within ER before the assembly of vesicles (Mizuno and Singer, 1993; Balch et al., 1994). A similar process seems to function in concentrating and packaging targeting molecules into ER-derived vesicles. 2S. Bednarek, L. Orci, and R. Schekman, unpublished data. To examine whether packaging of endogenous cargo proteins is essential for vesicle budding, we investigated the capacity of ER devoid of cargo proteins to participate in this reaction. The ER lumen was depleted of cargo proteins by inhibiting protein synthesis in vivo with cycloheximide (CHX) during a period long enough to purge even the most slowly secreted proteins in yeast (Esmon et al., 1981; Novick et al., 1981; Novick and Schekman., 1983). In the absence of protein synthesis, endogenous gpαf was depleted from the ER, whereas the level of ER resident proteins and targeting molecules remained unchanged (Fig. 2a, compare lanes M+ and M-). The packaging of targeting molecules was assessed in these cargo-free ER membranes using the modified budding assay. Bet1p and Sec22p were released from the CHX-treated ER fraction in a reaction dependent on COPII proteins and GTP (Fig. 3, column 5, and Fig. 4, column 2). As before, the Bet1p-containing vesicles sedimented at the 25-15% (w/v) Nycodenz interface upon isolation by ultracentrifugation (Fig. 2a, compare lanes 2 and 3). The polypeptide pattern of the membrane species derived from CHX-treated ER was virtually identical to that of vesicles from mock-treated ER fractions (Fig. 2b, compare lanes 2 and 3). We found no detectable budding of Sec61p and Kar2p from these ER fractions, demonstrating that formation of Bet1p-containing vesicles was not triggered by erroneous packaging of ER resident proteins or ER fragmentation into vesicles (Fig. 2a, lane 3, and Fig. 4, hatched and white bars). Although the above results show that COPII proteins promote the formation of authentic vesicles by cargo-depleted ER, it remained a possibility that cells possess a cytosolic regulator that modulates or arrests traffic when cargo production falls. Such a protein could act on the ER membrane or could modify the activity of a COPII subunit, for example, by reversible covalent modification. This regulator may not be represented in COPII proteins isolated from exponentially growing cells. We therefore tested the ability of crude cytosol prepared from either normal or CHX-treated cells to stimulate vesicle budding from cargo-depleted ER. As shown in Fig. 5, crude cytosol and GTP promoted the formation of Bet1p-containing vesicles to the same extent as COPII. Thus, we find no evidence for a factor extrinsic to COPII that may sense the availability of cargo for transport of targeting proteins from the ER. We next considered the possibility that cargo proteins may be distinct from targeting molecules in requiring ongoing protein synthesis for packaging. Membranes from CHX-treated cells were incubated in a standard budding reaction with 35S-labeled α-factor precursor as an exogenous cargo protein. As shown in Fig. 6, cargo-depleted ER membranes produced 35S-gpαf-containing vesicles in the presence of COPII or crude cytosols prepared from normal or CHX-treated cells.This result suggests that CHX-treated ER retains an intact cargo protein sorting and packaging machinery whose operation is not required for the formation of transport vesicles. In summary, the CHX-treated ER fraction, which was virtually identical to its mock-treated counterpart except for the lack of cargo proteins, was capable of producing a membrane compartment with physical and biochemical properties identical to those of ER-derived transport vesicles. Stable ER lumenal chaperones, such as Kar2p, that are not depleted during inhibition of protein synthesis may contribute to the packaging of cargo and targeting molecules. Because Kar2p is required to translocate α-factor precursor into the ER in vitro (Sanders et al., 1992), we quantified the formation of Bet1p- containing vesicles using kar2-159 membranes isolated from cells grown at the permissive temperature. In the presence of COPII or crude cytosol, kar2-159 membranes packaged Bet1p to the same extent at either 20°C or 30°C (Fig. 7). In contrast, the translocation of α factor precursor into mutant membranes was reduced by 77% at 30°C (data not shown) (Sanders et al., 1992), suggesting that Kar2p activity was reduced. We conclude that functional Kar2p is not required for budding targeting molecule-containing vesicles. The role of secretory cargo in membrane traffic between the ER and Golgi apparatus has been difficult to resolve. In the extreme case of vesicular stomatitis virus infection, which shuts down host protein synthesis (Zilberstein et al., 1981), the capsid G protein is transported through the secretory pathway as the sole cargo molecule. In yeast, glycoproteins accumulated in the ER in a sec mutant strain are secreted when cells are returned to a permissive temperature in the presence or absence of an inhibition of protein synthesis (cycloheximide) (Novick and Schekman., 1983). In this case the cargo accumulated in the ER may include or represent structural proteins necessary for the traffic event. In support of this view, small vesicles detected as an intermediate in the transport of proteins from the ER in yeast depend upon protein synthesis to accumulate to morphologically observable levels (Kaiser and Schekman, 1990). However, even in this case, a basal level of vesicle traffic may persist in cycloheximide-treated cells. Unfortunately, in vivo experiments have not addressed the cycling of ER to Golgi vesicle targeting (SNARE) proteins in cells treated with cycloheximide. We investigated this problem using a cell-free vesicle budding reaction where the cargo content of the donor ER membrane may be manipulated and the role of cargo in the formation of an anterograde transport vesicle can be distinguished from other steps in the ER to Golgi limb of the secretory pathway. The yeast SNARE proteins Bet1p and Sec22p continue to be packaged into transport vesicles irrespective of the presence of cargo molecules. SNARE protein packaging requires the full set of Sec proteins that comprise the COPII coat shown previously to envelope a model cargo protein, gpαf. No requirement for cargo was detected when this assay was conducted with ER membranes from cycloheximide-treated cells incubated with COPII proteins or cytosol from exponentially growing or cycloheximide-treated cells. Nevertheless, we cannot rule out the possibility that cells possess a feedback mechanism that we have not reproduced in vitro. No requirement for the lumenal chaperone Kar2p was detected when the packaging of SNARE molecules was assessed using kar2 mutant membranes incubated with COPII proteins at permissive or restrictive temperatures. Furthermore, we observed no influence of cargo or Kar2p on the segregation of SNARE and resident ER membrane proteins that accompanies the formation of transport vesicles. We conclude that the availability and packaging of cargo proteins is not essential to the formation of ER-derived vesicles. A similar phenomenon was first discovered in endocytosis of low density lipoprotein receptors in human fibroblasts (Anderson et al., 1978) and more recently in the recycling of pheromone receptors in yeast (Davis et al., 1993), in which the receptors are retrieved from the cell surface irrespective of their liganded state. By analogy to the role of clathrin and its adaptors in receptor-mediated endocytosis, we propose that SNARE and certain membrane cargo (or cargo adaptor) molecules possess structural or sequence information that allows their recognition and capture by COPII. These membrane proteins may share a common domain of interaction on a COPII subunit and thus be packaged together by a stochastic process. Ordinarily, the abundance of both types of membrane protein would ensure their coincident packaging into a single vesicle species. Alternatively, SNARE and membrane cargo (or cargo adaptor) molecules may interact with different COPII subunits, or different portions of the same subunit, thus ensuring a coordinate packaging event. In either case, our model predicts that in the absence of one type of membrane protein packaging of the other would continue. We thank Meta Kuehn and Martin Latterich for providing reagents."

The 66-kDa subunit contains a covalently bound flavin, the 37-kDa subunit is a possible iron-sulfur protein carrying three distinct types of EPR-visible FeS cluster, and the 33- and 12-kDa subunits are putative membrane-anchor subunits, respectively. While no heme group is detected in the purified complex II, it catalyzes succinate-dependent reduction of ubiquinone-1 and 2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol in the absence of phenazine methosulfate. The respiratory complex II of Sulfolobus sp. strain 7 appears to be novel in that it functions as a true succinate:caldariellaquinone oxidoreductase, although inherently lacking any heme group. This further indicates that the heme group of several respiratory complexes II may not be involved in the redox intermediates of the electron transfer from succinate to quinone."

A 4.9-kilobase human NF-L fragment including −292 base pairs of 5′-flanking sequences contained sufficient elements for nervous system expression in transgenic mice. Deletion of introns 1 and 2 from this 4.9-kilobase DNA fragment resulted in reduced levels of transgene expression in the cortex, while deletion of intron 3 had little effect. Both introns 1 and 2 could act independently as enhancers to confer neuronal expression of the basal heat shock promoter (hsp68) fused to lacZ in transgenic mice. The hNF-L basal promoter (−292 base pairs) was found to contain elements for directing neuronal expression of either the lacZ reporter gene or an intronless hNF-L construct. Sequence comparison revealed that intron 1, intron 2, and the basal human NF-L promoter all contain an ETS-like motif, CAGGA, present in a variety of genes expressed in the nervous system.

There is growing evidence that deregulation of neurofilament expression may play a central role in motor neuron disease. Transgenic mice that overexpress neurofilament proteins show motor neuron degeneration (17.Côté F. Collard J.-F. Julien J.-P.

Furthermore, the levels of NF-L mRNA are decreased in dogs with hereditary canine spinal muscular atrophy (22.Muma N. Cork L. Lab. Invest. 1993; 69: 436-442PubMed Google Scholar) as well as in motor neurons of patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis(23.Bergeron C. Beric-Maskarel K. Muntasser S. Weyer L. Somerville M.J. Percy M.E. J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 1994; 53: 221-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Yet, little is known about the mechanisms that regulate expression of neurofilament genes in the nervous system. This is in part due to the lack of suitable in vitro systems to study their expression (15.Ching G.Y. Liem R.K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19459-19468Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For instance, high levels of NF-L expression occurred after transfection of a complete genomic NF-L gene in non-neuronal cells such as cultured fibroblasts(6.Julien J.-P. Grosveld F. Yazdanbaksh K. Flavell D. Meijer D. Mushynski W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 909: 10-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 24.Monteiro M.J. Cleveland D.W. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 579-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), even though the endogenous NF-L gene remained silent. In contrast, DNA fragments containing either the complete human or mouse NF-L genes were correctly expressed in transgenic mice(25.Julien J.-P. Tretjakoff I. Beaudet L. Peterson A. Genes & Dev. 1987; 1: 1085-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 26.Monteiro M.J. Hoffman P.N. Gearhart J.D. Cleveland D.W. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 1543-1557Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar).We have shown previously that a human NF-L fragment including −292 bp of 5′-flanking sequences and intron sequences contained sufficient elements to drive NF-L expression in the nervous tissues of adult transgenic mice(27.Beaudet L. Charron G. Houle D. Tretjakoff I. Peterson A. Gene (Amst.). 1992; 116: 205-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). To further clarify the potential role of introns in modulating expression of the human NF-L gene, we used the transgenic mouse approach to test the transcriptional activity of NF-L DNA regions. We report here the existence of neuron-specific enhancers in both introns 1 and 2, which contribute to a wider expression pattern of the NF-L gene. In addition, we show that the regulatory elements included in the NF-L basal promoter (−292 bp) are sufficient to target neuronal expression.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPlasmid ConstructTo delete introns of the hNF-L gene, we took advantage of the existence of conserved restriction sites between the human and mouse NF-L genes. First, a 4.9-kb BamHI-XbaI fragment including the human NF-L gene was subcloned into the corresponding sites of a Bluescript pSK+ vector giving plasmid pSKhNF-L(27.Beaudet L. Charron G. Houle D. Tretjakoff I. Peterson A. Gene (Amst.). 1992; 116: 205-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The pSKhNF-L plasmid was subjected to a total BglII digestion followed by a partial SacI digestion, resulting in deletion of a DNA fragment spanning intron 1 and 2 all together with part of exon 1 and 3. The remaining plasmid pSKhNF-L was then isolated on agarose gel. A corresponding DNA BglII-SacI fragment of 750 bp from the mouse cDNA (5.Julien J.-P. Meijer D. Hurst J. Grosveld F. Mol. Brain Res. 1986; 1: 243-250Crossref Scopus (157) Google Scholar) was subcloned in that vector to recreate a human-mouse hybrid NF-L gene with its complete coding sequences but lacking introns 1 and 2 (construct hNF-L/intron3). A similar approach was used to delete intron 3, except that a double SacI-EcoRI partial digestion was carried out. The 522-bp SacI-EcoRI fragment from the mouse cDNA was used to replace the third intron. For the hNF-L/intronless and the intronless-UTR, the pSKhNF-L was digested to completion by BglII followed by a partial EcoRI digestion. From the mouse cDNA clone 646(5.Julien J.-P. Meijer D. Hurst J. Grosveld F. Mol. Brain Res. 1986; 1: 243-250Crossref Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 13.Liesi P. Julien J.-P. Vilja P. Grosveld F. Rechardt L. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1986; 34: 923-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), a BglII-EcoRI fragment of 1200 bp was isolated and ligated to the open pSKhNF-L vector. Prior to microinjection, all deletion mutant constructs were isolated on agarose gel after complete BamHI-XbaI digestion except for the intronless/UTR~, the DNA fragment was isolated after enzymatic digestion with BamHI-PacI. The PacI restriction site is localized 35 bp after the first polyadenylation signal of the human NF-L gene.The β-galactosidase gene (lacZ) was obtained from plasmid pCH110 (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). The pCH110 was cut to completion with HindIII followed by EcoRI partial digestion. A fragment of 4486 bp was then isolated and subcloned into Bluescript pSK+ linearized with HindIII-EcoRI digestion, creating plasmid pSKlacZ. The human NF-L basal promoter (from −292 to +15 bp) was isolated, blunted, and ligated to HindIII linker prior to insertion into HindIII site in pSKlacZ giving hNF-L/lacZ construct. A XhoI-NotI DNA fragment of 4.8 kb was isolated on agarose gel for microinjection.To prepare the hsp-lacZ construct, we subcloned a lacZ enhancer trap vector (28.Rossant J. Zirngibl R. Cado D. Shago M. Giguere V. Genes & Dev. 1991; 5: 1333-1344Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar) into the BamHI sites of a Bluescript SK+ plasmid (Stratagene). Each intron was then amplified by PCR and inserted into the unique SmaI site localized at the 5′-end of the cassette. For microinjection, each construct was separated from plasmid sequences on agarose gel after digestion with SalI-NotI.Microinjection into One-cell Mouse EmbryosLinear DNA fragments were isolated and diluted to concentration of 1 μg/ml in Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.15 mM EDTA prior to microinjection into male pronuclei of C57Bl/6J X C3H fertilized eggs. Injected embryos were transferred to the oviduct of pseudopregnant females(29.Brinster R.L. Chen H.Y. Trumbauer M. Senear A.W. Warren R. Palmiter R.D. Cell. 1981; 27: 223-231Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar). Identification of transgenic mice was carried out by Southern blot analysis of 10 μg of tail genomic DNA as described before(27.Beaudet L. Charron G. Houle D. Tretjakoff I. Peterson A. Gene (Amst.). 1992; 116: 205-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 30.Julien J.-P. Beaudet L. Tretjakoff I. Peterson A. J. Physiol. (Paris). 1990; 84: 50-52PubMed Google Scholar).RNase Protection AssayRNA was prepared from various tissues of transgenic mice by the guanidinium/phenol method (31.Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (62986) Google Scholar). A 958-bp BglII fragment spanning exon 1 and intron 1 sequences of the human NF-L gene was subcloned into the pT7/T3-18 vector (Life Technologies, Inc.). After linearization of the plasmid with HindIII, an antisense RNA probe of high specific radioactivity was generated with T7 RNA polymerase in the presence of [α-32P]CTP. An excess of RNA probe was hybridized at 45°C with 15 μg of total RNA, and RNase treatment was carried out at 34°C as described previously(32.Melton D.A. Krieg P.A. Rebagliati M.R. Maniatis T. Zinn K. Green M.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 7035-7056Crossref PubMed Scopus (4048) Google Scholar). RNase-protected fragments were resolved on denaturing 5% polyacrylamide gels. 32P-Labeled ladder (Life Technologies, Inc.) served as markers.RT-PCR20 μg of total mRNA was resuspended in 4 volumes of H2O prior to ethanol precipitation. Pellets were resuspended in 46 μl of buffer A (100 mM KCl, 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0 at 25°C), 10 mM (NH4)2SO4, 10 mM MgCl2, 0.1% Triton X-100). The first strand synthesis was performed by adding 8 μl of 1.25 mM dNTP mix and 250 ng of primers 784 and 808 in presence of 30 units of RNAguard and 20 units of avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase. Reaction mixture was incubated at 42°C during 1 h and then stopped at 95°C for 5 min. Each sample was subjected to two PCR reactions, one specific for the hNF-L transcript using primer 522 and 784 and the others to the G3PDH transcript using primers 808 and 809. The PCR reaction was done according to the manufacturer (New England Biochemicals) using of the cDNA mix as template, 0.20 μCi of [32P]dATP, and 1 unit of VENT DNA polymerase. After 25 cycles (1 min at 95°C, 1 min at 55°C, 1 min at 72°C), an aliquot of both PCR-specific reactions was electrophoresed on 1% agarose gel, blotted, and autoradiographed.OligonucleotidesPrimers 522 and 784 are specific for the first hNF-L exon. Their sequences are, respectively, GCACATCTCCAGCGTGCGT and AGATCTGCGCGTACTGGATCTGCGCC. A second pair of oligonucleotides specific for the mouse G3PDH mRNA has served to quantified amounts of RNA in each sample. Their sequences are TTGATGGTATTCGAGAGAAGGG (primer 808) and TCCAGGAGCGAGATCCCGTC (primer 809).Histochemical Staining for β-GalactosidaseThe 13.5-day-old embryos were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.8% NaCl, KCl, Na2HPO4, KH2PO4 (PBS) for 90 min at 4°C. Fixed embryos were then washed at 4°C in three changes of PBS and incubated at 30°C overnight in a solution containing 1 mg/ml X-Gal, 5 mM K4Fe(CN)6, 5 mM K3Fe(CN)6, 2 mM MgCl2, 0.01% sodium deoxycholate, and 0.02% Nonidet P-40 in PBS. After staining, some specimens were prepared for section examination by first incubation at 4°C for 1 h in PBS containing 10% sucrose and then overnight in PBS added with 15% sucrose. Embryos were embedded in Tissu-tek and frozen in isopentane cooled with liquid nitrogen. Sections (15-20 μm thick) were cut on cryostat at −22°C and recovered on Superfrost+ microscope slides (Fisher).RESULTSTranscriptional Activity of NF-L Intron SequencesTo determine the specific contribution of intragenic sequences on transcriptional regulation of the hNF-L gene, we generated transgenic mice with various DNA constructs in which introns were deleted in various combinations (Fig. 1). The presence, in exon sequences, of conserved restriction sites between the human and mouse NF-L genes allowed us to selectively swap genomic regions of the human NF-L gene with fragments of the mouse NF-L cDNA. All deletion mutants included the basal human NF-L promoter (−292 bp) and the first endogenous hNF-L polyadenylation signal.Four transgenic mouse lines have been generated with the intact 4.9-kb hNF-L gene (Fig. 2). In only one mouse line, the transgene remained silent in all tissues examined. In the other three mouse lines, expression of the NF-L transgene, as detected by RNase protection assay, was restricted to the nervous system. Fig. 3A shows the results of a RNase protection experiment carried out with RNA from an adult mouse of line 1 using an antisense RNA probe covering the first hNF-L exon/intron border.Fig. 2Summary of data generated with five different NF-L gene constructs in 16 transgenic mouse lines. ND signifies that RNA samples were not analyzed; the number of + symbols gives a relative quantification of the intensity of NF-L mRNA expression, while empty boxes indicate absence of expression.

Total RNA from various tissues of transgenic mice bearing a complete hNF-L gene (panel A) and the hNF-L/intron1,2 construct (panel B) was analyzed by an RNase protection assay for specific expression of human NF-L transcripts. The antisense RNA probe of 960 bp spanning the first hNF-L exon/intron boundary yields a protected fragment of 316 nucleotides. The control mRNA (lane 15 in B) was obtained from the mouse line 29 expressing a 21.1-kb human NF-L fragment(18.Xu Z. Cork L. Griffin J.W. Cleveland D.W. Cell. 1993; 73: 23-33Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). The negative control (lane 14) corresponds to total cortex mRNA from a normal mouse.

RNase protection analysis of the RNA from offspring revealed, in both mouse lines, a restricted expression to nervous system (Fig. 3B). In one transgenic line, ectopic expression occurred in the heart (Fig. 2).For analysis of the hNF-L/intron3, hNF-L/intronless, and the intronless/UTR~ constructs, the 960-bp human RNA probe could not be used since the human exon 1 sequences have been replaced by the corresponding mouse sequences. Therefore, to analyze transgene expression, we carried out an RT-PCR assay with a set of oligonucleotides specific for the 5′-part of the hNF-L first exon (Fig. 4A). The corresponding endogenous NF-L mRNA is not amplified with these primers (Fig. 4B, lane 1) because of species differences in the 5′-untranslated sequences. For the hNF-L/intron3, hNF-L/intronless, and the intronless-UTR~, a total of nine different transgenic mouse lines were produced, of which seven expressed their transgene (Fig. 2). All three DNA constructs yielded a restricted expression to nervous tissue. Only line 12, generated with the hNF-L/intronless construct, showed a signal in the heart (Fig. 4B, lane 30).Fig. 4Expression analysis of NF-L transgenes by an RT-PCR assay. Total mRNA from various tissues of transgenic mice was reverse transcribed prior to PCR assay. Two sets of oligonucleotides were used. The first set corresponds to oligonucleotides specific for the first exon of the human NF-L gene, and they do not amplify mouse NF-L transcripts. The second pair corresponds to the mouse G3PDH gene, which is used as an internal control. Lane 1, amplified product from mRNA of normal mouse cortex; lanes 2-11, mRNA from a hNF-L transgenic mouse; lanes 12-21, mRNA from mice with hNF-L/intron3 transgene; lanes 22-31, mRNA from mice with hNF-L/intronless; and lanes 32-41, mRNA from mice with intronless-UTR.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The removal of introns 1 and 2 resulted in decreased levels of transgene expression in the cortex and cerebellum as detected by RT-PCR (Fig. 4A, compare lane 12 with lane 2). Further deletion of intron 3 and 3′-UTR had little effect on expression pattern and intensity of the bands (Fig. 4B). These results suggested that introns 1 and 2 do contain regulatory elements that contribute to the enhancement of hNF-L expression in the cortex and cerebellum of adult mouse.Neuron-specific Expression of a lacZ Reporter Gene Driven by the hNF-L Basal PromoterThe above experiment with the hNF-L/intronless suggested that basal NF-L promoter(−292) was able to direct specific expression in the nervous system. Paradoxally, we reported previously that the same promoter was unable to direct neuronal expression of the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter gene. To further clarify the activity of this promoter (−292 to +15 bp), we tested it on the widely used Escherichia coli β-galactosidase reporter gene (lacZ). Four transgenic founders were obtained with the hNF-L/lacZ construct, of which three expressed the transgene. The 13.5-day-old embryos were stained with X-Gal. A blue coloration, indicative of lacZ expression, was found predominantly in the nervous system (Fig. 5). We noted a slight variability in the expression patterns from one embryo to another (Fig. 5), likely reflecting an influence of the chromosomal integration site. This phenomenon, which has been observed for other transgenes(33.Bonnerot C. Grimber G. Briand P. Nicolas J.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6331-6335Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 34.Cohen-Tannoudji M. Morello D. Babinet C. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1992; 33: 149-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), can result from the absence of dominant control elements that confer position-independent expression like those found in the β-globin gene(35.Grosveld F. Blom van Assendelft G. Greaves D.R. Kollias G. Cell. 1987; 51: 975-985Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1430) Google Scholar). Microscopic analysis performed on adult brain sections of line 1 showed expression to diverse population of neurons (Fig. 6). In the cortex, lacZ staining was localized in the forelimb and hindlimb area of the cortex (Fig. 6A) in neurons of the cingulum (Fig. 6C), the lateral septal (Fig. 6D), the piriform cortex (Fig. 6E), and in the hippocampus (Fig. 6F). Strong staining was found in neurons of the granule cell layer of the cerebellum (Fig. 6G). Some neurons of the molecular layer were colored, but no Purkinje cells were stained. lacZ expression was found in the dorsal horn region of the spinal cord and in the dorsal root ganglia (Fig. 6, H and I, respectively). In all regions of the nervous system, only a subset of neurons was stained. The combined results indicate that the basal hNF-L promoter does contain transcriptional elements capable to direct neuron-specific expression in both embryos and adult mice.Fig. 5Neuron-specific regulatory elements in the NF-L gene direct heterologous lacZ expression. Embryos were analyzed 13.5 days after microinjection of lacZ DNA constructs. At left is shown a schematic representation of each lacZ fusion construct. An × indicates the stained tissues, and the arrow at the end of the line indicates the embryos from which pictures were taken.

To further confirm the presence of regulatory elements in introns, the DNA fragments spanning intron sequences were tested for their activity using a hsp68/lacZ enhancer trap vector. This vector is composed of the basal promoter of the gene for the heat shock protein hsp68, followed by the E. coli β-galactosidase gene. The minimal hsp68 promoter exhibited no basal activity in transgenic mice (36.Kothary R. Clapoff S. Brown A. Campbell R. Peterson A. Rossant J.

Thus, the transcriptional activation of the basal hsp promoter reflects the activity of elements carried by a heterologous enhancer. The hNF-L introns 1, 2, and 3 were amplified by PCR and subcloned independently in front of the hsp68/lacZ enhancer trap vector to yield constructs, designated int-1, int-2, and int-3, respectively.Whole mount transgenic embryos were analyzed for expression of those constructs at 13.5 days post-fertilization. With the int-1 construct, four distinct founders were generated. All four lines expressed the lacZ transgene in the nervous tissue (Fig. 5). A mild variation in the pattern of nervous system expression was detected from one line to another. One embryo showed ectopic expression in the limb buds, while another yielded a very weak signal in the somites. Similarly, the five transgenic embryos bearing the int-2 construct presented a variegated staining in the nervous system. Only one embryo revealed ectopic expression to the apical ectoderm ridge. Of the six transgenic embryos generated with the int-3 construct, none yielded lacZ expression in the nervous system. Ectopic expression was detected at low levels in three lines (Fig. 5).These results demonstrated the existence of neuron-specific enhancers located in the first and second NF-L introns that can contribute to enhance NF-L expression in the telencephalon, diencephalon, and mesencephalon that correspond to anterior structure of the embryonic nervous system (Fig. 5). The third intron is apparently devoid of such elements. To further define enhancer regions in the first intron, we generated a construct named 5′int-1 (Fig. 5), in which the first 560-bp region of intron 1 was subcloned in front of the hsp68/lacZ gene construct in an opposite orientation (Fig. 5). Two transgenic embryos were obtained, and they both expressed lacZ in the nervous system. Our conclusion is that the 5′-region of intron 1 contains elements to enhance expression in the anterior region of the nervous system.DISCUSSIONWe report here that the minimal human NF-L promoter (−292 bp) is sufficient to direct neuronal expression both of an hNF-L/intronless and an hNF-L/lacZ reporter gene (Fig. 4, Fig. 5). Although a variegated staining occurred in transgenic embryos generated with the hNF-L/lacZ transgene, the lacZ activity was limited to the nervous tissue. This variegation is likely due to an influence of the chromosomal integration site, as chromatin assembly and/or neighboring regulatory elements could affect transcriptional activity. The neuronal expression of the hNF-L/lacZ fusion construct was an unexpected finding, as this same promoter was previously found to be unable to direct neuron-specific expression of the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter gene(27.Beaudet L. Charron G. Houle D. Tretjakoff I. Peterson A. Gene (Amst.). 1992; 116: 205-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). How could different reporter genes yield different results? It is well known that folding of the DNA in a nucleosomal structure generally decreases basal transcriptional activity (for review, see (39.Grunstein M.

The EBNA1 molecules bound to the oriP subelements interact efficiently with each other by a DNA looping mechanism. We have previously mapped a region of EBNA1 (termed the looping region) that is required to mediate the interaction of the EBNA1 molecules bound to the oriP subelements. We now demonstrate that two fragments of this region of EBNA1, which consist largely of an eight amino acid repeat, can mediate homotypic interactions when transferred to another DNA-binding protein. Protein interactions mediated by the EBNA1 looping region appear to be dependent on DNA binding since these interactions were detected between DNA-bound forms of the proteins only.

Protein interactions mediated by the EBNA1 looping region appear to be dependent on DNA binding since these interactions were detected between DNA-bound forms of the proteins only. The interaction at a distance between DNA-bound proteins by a DNA looping mechanism has been reported to underlie a variety of biological processes including transcription, DNA replication, and site-specific DNA recombination (reviewed in Matthews(1992) and Schleif(1992)). Proteins that participate in this type of interaction include the λand lac repressors (Kramer et al., 1987; Hochschild and Ptashne, 1988), the E2 protein of bovine papilloma virus (Knight et al., 1991), the Ultrabithorax homeodomain protein (Beachy et al., 1993), heat shock transcription factor 2 (Wyman et al., 1995), Mu A and B proteins (Adzuma and Mizuuchi, 1989), and the replication initiation proteins of plasmids R6K and P1 (Chattoraj et al., 1988; Mukherjee et al., 1988a, 1988b). Despite the apparent importance of this type of protein-protein interaction, the nature of the protein domains that mediate these interactions and the mechanism(s) by which they occur remain unclear. In order to address these issues, we have examined in detail the DNA looping interactions mediated by the EBNA1 protein of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV).

Epstein-Barr virus family of repeats dyad symmetry element kilobase(s) base pair(s) high performance liquid chromatography. During latent infection of human host cells, EBV genomes are maintained as double-stranded DNA episomes that replicate once every cell cycle (Adams, 1987; Yates and Guan, 1991). EBNA1, in conjunction with host replication factors, governs this replication through a direct interaction with the genetically defined latent origin of replication, oriP (Rawlins et al., 1985; Reisman et al., 1985). oriP consists of two subelements, the family of repeats (FR) and the dyad symmetry element (DS), that are separated by approximately 1 kb of DNA (Reisman et al., 1985). The DS element contains 4 EBNA1 binding sites and appears to be the actual origin of replication (Rawlins et al., 1985; Gahn and Schildkraut, 1989). The FR contains 20 EBNA1 binding sites and, when bound by EBNA1, activates DNA replication from the DS element, enhances transcription from viral promoters, and governs the stable segregation of the EBV episomes during cell division (Reisman et al., 1985; Reisman and Sugden, 1986; Krysan et al., 1989; Gahn and Sugden, 1995). Examinations of the interaction of pure EBNA1 with oriP DNA sequences have revealed that the EBNA1 dimers that assemble on the FR and DS elements of oriP interact efficiently with each other bringing the two elements together. This interaction results in the generation of looped DNA molecules (when the interaction occurs between EBNA1 bound to FR and DS elements in the same DNA molecule) and in the cross-linking of multiple DNA molecules through EBNA1 (when the interaction occurs between EBNA1 bound to FR and DS elements on different DNA molecules) (Frappier and O'Donnell, 1991a; Su et al., 1991; Middleton and Sugden, 1992). Such interactions between EBNA1 dimers depend on EBNA1 binding to DNA and do not occur between EBNA1 dimers in solution (Frappier and O'Donnell, 1991b). Interactions between EBNA1 molecules bound to the FR and DS elements stabilize EBNA1 on the DS element and likely are an important part of the mechanism by which the FR activates DNA replication from the DS element (Su et al., 1991; Frappier et al., 1994). In order to better understand the mechanism by which these interactions occur, we have used mutational analyses to identify a region of EBNA1 (termed the DNA looping region) that is required to mediate the interaction between FR- and DS-bound EBNA1 molecules (Goldsmith et al., 1993; Frappier et al., 1994). This region is distinct from the DNA binding and dimerization domains of EBNA1 and therefore likely directs the homotypic protein interaction. We now demonstrate that the DNA looping region is composed of at least two independent domains that are sufficient to mediate homotypic protein interactions and that retain the ability to mediate these interactions when transferred to another DNA-binding protein. GAL4 DNA substrates for ligation enhancement assays contain two copies of five tandem 17-bp GAL4 binding sites positioned 50 and 780 bp away from each end of the DNA fragment, respectively, and separated by 3.9 kb of DNA. oriP DNA substrates have been described previously (Goldsmith et al., 1993) and are similar in construction to the GAL4 substrates except that they contain the two oriP subelements (containing 4 and 20 copies of the EBNA1 binding site) instead of GAL4 binding sites. Both of these substrates have cohesive ends. The Gal4 DNA substrates for electron microscopy contain two copies of five tandem 17-bp GAL4 binding sites positioned 0.7 and 3 kb away from each end of the DNA fragment, respectively, and separated by 1 kb of DNA. Plasmids expressing GAL4EBNA351-377, GAL4EBNA320-355, and GAL4EBNA452-477 fusion proteins were constructed in two steps. Fragments of the EBNA1 gene encoding amino acids 351-450 or 320-450 were amplified by polymerase chain reaction and cloned between the NcoI and BamHI sites of pAS2 (a gift from Stephen Elledge; Harper et al., 1993) in-frame with the GAL4 and hemagglutinin gene fragments. The fragment of the EBNA1 gene encoding amino acids 452-641 was excised from pETEBNA452-641 constructs (Barwell et al., 1995) by digestions with NdeI and BamHI and cloned between the NdeI and BamHI sites of pAS2. In the second step, the fusion constructs were amplified from the first codon of the GAL4 gene to the 377th (for the 351-450 template), the 355th (for the 320-450 template), or the 474th (for the 452-641 template) codon of EBNA1 by polymerase chain reaction and cloned into the BamHI site of pET15b (Novagen). pET15b plasmids containing GAL4-EBNA1 fusion constructs were used to transform Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3)pLysS (Studier et al., 1990). Transformants were grown at 37°C in 2 liters of Luria broth supplemented with 50 μg/ml ampicillin and 25 μg/ml chloramphenicol until the A600 was 0.6-0.8. Isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside was then added to 1 mM. The cells were harvested 3 h postinduction, resuspended in 40 ml of 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 10% sucrose, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and frozen at −70°C for at least 1 h. After the cells were thawed, NaCl and ZnCl2 were added to final concentrations of 200 mM and 10 μM, respectively, and the lysates were sonicated to reduce the viscosity of the solution. Lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 53,000 × g for 30 min at 4°C then loaded onto a 25-ml heparin agarose column (Bio-Rad) equilibrated with buffer A (20 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, 10 μM ZnCl2, 2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) plus 200 mM NaCl. The column was developed with a linear gradient from 200 mM to 1 M NaCl in buffer A. The fractions containing the GAL4-EBNA1 fusion proteins were applied to a 5-ml HPLC metal-chelating column (PerSeptive Biosystems) charged with nickel and equilibrated in buffer B (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 200 mM NaCl, 10 μM ZnCl2, 2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) plus 5 mM imidazole. The proteins were eluted with a linear gradient from 5 mM to 1 M imidazole in buffer B. Dithiothreitol and EDTA were added immediately to the eluted proteins to a final concentration of 1 mM each, and fractions containing the GAL4-EBNA1 fusion proteins were applied to a 3-ml HPLC heparin column or a 5-ml HPLC Poros S column (PerSeptive Biosystems) equilibrated with buffer A plus 200 mM NaCl, 1 mM dithiothreitol, and 1 mM EDTA. Proteins were eluted with buffer A containing 1 M NaCl, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 1 mM EDTA and stored at −70°C. The GAL4-EBNA1 fusion proteins were identified by Western blotting using monoclonal antibodies against the hemagglutinin epitope (Boehringer Mannheim). GAL4 DNA substrates (45 fmol) were incubated with amounts of GAL4-EBNA1 fusion proteins sufficient to bind 50% of the DNA fragment in 100-μl reactions containing 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8, 150 mM NaCl, 20 mM MgCl2, 10 mM dithiothreitol, 2 mM spermidine, 2 mM ATP for 10 min at room temperature. Reactions were diluted 2-fold, and then 1 Weiss unit of T4 DNA ligase (Life Technologies Inc.) was added and incubated for 5 min at 15°C. Reactions were stopped by the addition of EDTA to 20 mM, and the DNA was precipitated with ethanol. Samples were resuspended in 1 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.1 mM EDTA, 1% SDS and subjected to electrophoresis on an 0.8% agarose gel containing 0.5 μg/ml ethidium bromide. As a positive control, the above experiment was performed using oriP DNA substrates and an amount of EBNA1 (2 pmol as dimer) sufficient to bind 100% of the DNA molecules. The EBNA1 protein was that previously described by Frappier and O'Donnell (1991b). DNA fragments (10 fmol) containing GAL4 binding sites were incubated with amounts of GAL4-EBNA1 fusion proteins sufficient to bind 100% of the DNA fragments in 20 μl of a buffer containing 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 5 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM dithiothreitol, 10 μM ZnCl2 for 10 min at room temperature. Samples were then diluted 6-fold in 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 5 mM MgCl2, 4 mM spermidine, 10 μM ZnCl2 and spread, without fixation, on glow-charged carbon-coated copper grids (400-mesh; JB EM Services). Grids were stained with 5% aqueous uranyl acetate, rotary-shadowed with tungsten, and observed using a JEM-1200 EXII electron microscope. Proteins (10 μg) at a concentration of 4.8 μM in 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 10 μM ZnCl2, 0.5 mM dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol were layered onto 2-ml 10-26% glycerol gradients containing 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 10 μM ZnCl2, 0.5 mM dithiothreitol. Gradients were subjected to centrifugation at 166,000 × g for 9 h at 20°C. Twenty fractions of equal volume were collected from the top of each gradient, and the protein in each fraction was precipitated with trichloroacetic acid using deoxycholate as a carrier. The bottom of each tube used for the sedimentation was rinsed with 10 μl of protein dye mixture (1.5 M Tris, 3.7% SDS, 37% glycerol, 185 mM dithiothreitol, 0.075% bromphenol blue) to recover any large protein aggregates. We have demonstrated previously that the interaction at a distance of DNA-bound EBNA1 molecules requires part (amino acids 351-377) of the internal basic region of EBNA1 (termed the looping region) between amino acids 327 and 377 (see Fig. 1; Frappier et al., 1994 (note that the amino-terminal amino acid numbers reported in Frappier et al.(1994) are off by 1, i.e. the 350-641 truncation mutant is really 351-641)).In order to determine whether EBNA1 amino acids 351-377 are sufficient for this interaction, we fused this portion of EBNA1 to the GAL4 DNA binding domain (Fig. 1). Since the amino acid sequence of the EBNA1 351-377 fragment is very similar to that between amino acids 327 and 350, we also tested the ability of an EBNA1 fragment spanning this region(320-355) to support DNA looping interactions. A fusion protein containing an EBNA1 fragment(452-474) previously shown to be insufficient for DNA looping (Goldsmith et al., 1993) was also constructed as a negative control (Fig. 1). The fusion proteins were overproduced in E. coli, purified to >75% purity, and assayed for DNA binding activity by electrophoretic mobility shift using DNA fragments containing 5 tandem GAL4 binding sites (data not shown). The amount of each protein required to bind 50% of the DNA molecules was then tested for the ability to mediate interactions between the GAL4 binding sites in a ligation enhancement assay (Fig. 2). In this assay, interactions between the proteins bound at their cognate DNA recognition sequences bring the cohesive ends of the DNA substrates close together, resulting in an increased ligation efficiency (Mukherjee et al., 1988a, 1988b; Miron et al., 1992). We have shown previously that EBNA1 induces the concatemerization of oriP DNA molecules in this assay due to the ability of EBNA1 to mediate interactions between multiple DNA fragments containing the oriP subelements (Goldsmith et al., 1993; Frappier et al., 1994; also see Fig. 2). When this assay was conducted with the GAL4-EBNA1 fusion proteins using DNA substrates containing 2 sets of 5 tandem copies of the GAL4 binding sites positioned close to each end of the DNA molecule, both the GAL4EBNA320-355 and the GAL4EBNA351-377 fusion proteins (where the subscript refers to the EBNA1 amino acids in the fusion protein) induced DNA concatemers indistinguishable from those induced by EBNA1 (Fig. 2). No such interactions were observed with the fusion protein containing EBNA1 amino acids 452 to 474 (Fig. 2), even when the protein concentration was increased 4-fold (data not shown). Concatemeric DNA products were not induced by any of the GAL4-EBNA1 fusion proteins when the ligation enhancement assay was performed with DNA fragments lacking GAL4 binding sites (data not shown). These results indicate that EBNA1 fragments spanning amino acids 351 to 377 and 320 to 355 are sufficient to mediate protein-protein interactions when tethered to DNA through a DNA binding domain.Figure 2:Detection of the interactions of DNA-bound GAL4EBNA320-355 and GAL4EBNA351-377 by ligation enhancement. A DNA fragment containing two sets of five tandem copies of the GAL4 recognition sequence (GAL4) was incubated with amounts of GAL4-EBNA1 fusion proteins required to bind 50% of the DNA fragments or without protein (0). After the addition of ligase, samples were incubated for 5 min at 15°C prior to ethanol precipitation and agarose gel electrophoresis in 0.5 μg of ethidium bromide per ml. Positions of the linear DNA substrate (L) as well as covalently closed circular (CCC) and concatemeric (∗) ligation products are indicated. The assay was also performed with a DNA fragment containing the oriP subelements (oriP) incubated with or without (0) EBNA1. The sizes of the largest concatemeric products cannot be determined accurately from this gel system but are greater than 20 kb.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We also used electron microscopy to visualize the structures formed upon incubation of the GAL4 fusion proteins with DNA fragments containing 2 sets of 5 tandem copies of the GAL4 binding sites separated by 1 kb of intervening DNA (the same spacing as that for the oriP subelements). In keeping with the results of the ligation enhancements assays, GAL4EBNA320-355 and GAL4EBNA351-377, but not GAL4EBNA452-474, were observed to mediate interactions between multiple DNA molecules resulting in the formation of multiple complexes shown in Fig. 3(see also Table 1). Multiple complexes were not observed when the fusion proteins were incubated with DNA fragments lacking GAL4 binding sites (data not shown). Although the majority of the DNA molecules that were bound by GAL4EBNA320-355 and GAL4EBNA351-377 were observed to be sequestered into these multiple complexes, the individual DNA molecules that were observed to have protein bound at both sets of GAL4 sites were in a looped configuration consistent with protein-mediated interactions between the two sets of sites. The frequency of multiple complexes and looped structures induced by GAL4EBNA320-355 and GAL4EBNA351-377 is almost identical with that observed previously for the EBNA351 truncation mutant bound to oriP DNA (Frappier et al., 1994).Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab In the context of the EBNA1 protein, the homotypic protein interactions mediated by the looping region of EBNA1 are dependent on DNA binding (Frappier and O'Donnell, 1991b). In order to determine whether the interactions mediated by the looping region of EBNA1 are DNA-dependent in the context of the GAL4 fusion proteins, we used glycerol gradient sedimentation to compare the native oligomerization state of GAL4-EBNA1 fusion proteins that do and do not mediate protein interactions on DNA (under protein and salt concentrations identical with those used for the ligation enhancement assay). The results in Fig. 4 show that both GAL4EBNA452-474 and GAL4EBNA351-377 migrate as discrete species with very similar sedimentation coefficients (3.2 and 3.7, respectively). Since the interaction of multiple GAL4EBNA351-377 molecules would result in complexes with much larger sedimentation coefficients, these results indicate that the interaction of multiple GAL4EBNA351-377 molecules, which occurs when this protein binds to DNA, does not occur in the absence of DNA. Therefore, interactions mediated by the EBNA1 looping region appear to be dependent on DNA binding. The results of both the ligation enhancement assay and the electron microscopy showed that both the 320-355 and 351-377 EBNA1 fragments constitute independent, transferable domains that are sufficient to mediate interactions at a distance between DNA-bound proteins. These two fragments of EBNA1 are highly conserved in sequence (53% identical according to the Lipman-Pearson protein alignment) and are composed largely of glycine and arginine residues (Fig. 5). Examination of these sequences reveals an eight amino acid repeat present in triplicate in both the 320-355 and 351-377 EBNA1 fragments (Fig. 5). Since both of these fragments are composed almost exclusively of these repeats, our results suggest that this repeated sequence can direct the interaction at a distance of DNA-bound EBNA1. Whether it is the actual sequence of the octamer repeat or the amino acid content of the repeat that is important for this interaction remains to be determined. We have shown previously that an EBNA1 truncation mutant containing three octamer repeats (EBNA351) supports efficient interactions between the FR and DS elements and that the efficiency with which these interactions occur drops dramatically when two of the octamer repeats (amino acids 351-362) are deleted. Therefore, one copy of the octamer repeat sequence of the DNA looping region is insufficient to mediate stable interactions at a distance between DNA-bound EBNA1 molecules; two or three copies are required. Three copies of the octamer repeat also appear to be sufficient to confer complete DNA looping activity, since EBNA351 mediates interactions between FR and DS elements as efficiently as a larger replication-competent EBNA1 (bEBNA1) containing six copies of the octamer repeat (Goldsmith et al., 1993; Frappier et al., 1994), and since internal deletions of EBNA1 that remove one of the six octamer repeats do not affect the ability of EBNA1 to mediate interactions between the FR and DS elements. ( 2A. Laine and L. Frappier, unpublished results.) While three copies of the octamer repeat can account for the complete looping activity of EBNA1, we have not excluded the possibility that other redundant EBNA1 sequences amino-terminal to amino acid 320 can also mediate interactions at a distance between DNA-bound EBNA1 molecules. The finding that the EBNA1 looping region does not mediate the interaction of DNA-binding proteins in solution indicates that a critical alteration in the structure of the looping region is induced by DNA binding. This alteration in structure might be transduced through the DNA binding domain upon binding to DNA or might result from a direct interaction of the looping region with the DNA. The first possibility seems unlikely given that the looping region is active in the context of both EBNA1 and GAL4 proteins. We postulate, therefore, that the EBNA1 looping region, which is positively charged and has homology to other nucleic acid-binding proteins (Burd and Dreyfuss, 1994), makes direct contact with the DNA and only then adopts a structure conducive to protein-protein interactions. A wide variety of DNA-binding proteins have been reported to participate in DNA looping interactions. Like EBNA1, the DNA looping interactions mediated by some proteins, including the E2 protein of bovine papilloma virus and the Ultrabithorax homeodomain protein, occur through a region of the protein distinct from the DNA binding and dimerization domains (Knight et al., 1991; Beachy et al., 1993). Whether the DNA looping region of these proteins retains functionality when transferred to other DNA-binding proteins remains to be determined. It is likely that DNA looping interactions can occur through different mechanisms for different DNA-binding proteins. Recently, DNA looping interactions between two lac repressor dimers have been shown to occur through an antiparallel four-helix bundle in which each monomer of the tetramer contributes one helix (Friedman et al., 1995). This mechanism of interaction is clearly different from that for EBNA1, since stable interactions between the lac repressor dimers occurs in the absence of DNA.

Aled Edwards, Jim Smiley, John Hassell, and Peter Whyte for critical reading of the manuscript and to Aled Edwards and Jim Smiley for helpful comments throughout the course of this work.

https://openalex.org/W1513848044,"To determine the role of the central aromatic residue in one of the DNA binding domains in Escherichia coli RecA protein, we have constructed a protein in which a tryptophan fluorescence reporter is inserted in the place of phenylalanine residue 203 in loop L2, a putative DNA binding site, and measured its fluorescence. The modified protein is active both in vivo and in vitro. The binding of nucleotide cofactor (ATP or its analog adenosine 5′-O-3-thiotriphosphate) does not modify the fluorescence. By contrast, the binding of DNA, both in the absence and presence of cofactor, strongly decreases the fluorescence in intensity (40-65%) and shifts the emission peak from 344 to 337 nm. The change occurs both with single- and double-stranded DNA and also upon the binding of a second single-stranded DNA. The results indicate that the residue 203 is in fact close to the first and second DNA binding sites. However, the quenching is not total and depends only slightly on the nature of DNA bases, thus suggesting an indirect interaction with DNA bases.

DNA repair is vital for both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. RecA is an ubiquitous and multi-functional enzyme involved in various steps of DNA repair: regulation of synthesis of DNA repair proteins (SOS induction), promotion of homologous recombination, and mutagenesis (For reviews, see (1.Walker G.C.

The molecular structure of the RecA filament in the absence of DNA has been determined by x-ray crystallography(9.Story R.M. Weber I.T. Steitz T.A. Nature. 1992; 355: 318-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar). A lower resolution structure of the nucleofilament (4.Egelman E.H. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1993; 3: 189-197Crossref Scopus (63) Google Scholar) and of the DNA in the complex (5.Takahashi M. Norden B. Adv. Biophys. 1994; 30: 1-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) has also been determined. These studies have shown that the DNA strands lie near the axis of the RecA-DNA filament. Determination of the DNA binding sites in RecA would allow us to build a higher resolution model of the RecA-DNA complex. Despite various studies, however, the DNA binding site(s) of RecA has not yet been determined. From the comparison of sequence with the DNA binding domain of ssDNA ( 1The abbreviations used are: ssDNAsingle-stranded DNAdsDNAdouble-stranded DNAATPγSadenosine 5′-O-3-thiotriphosphatewtwild typepoly(d∊A)poly(1, N6-ethenodeoxyadenosine)DTTdithiothreitolPIPES1, 4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid.) binding protein of the Ike phage, GP5 protein, the domain comprising residues 240-310 has been proposed as a DNA binding site(10.Prasad B.V.

But this region is in the subunit-subunit interface in the crystal of the RecA filament(9.Story R.M. Weber I.T. Steitz T.A. Nature. 1992; 355: 318-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar). Story et al.(9.Story R.M. Weber I.T. Steitz T.A. Nature. 1992; 355: 318-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar) rejected this possibility and proposed that two disordered loops that could not be traced in the x-ray analysis were the DNA binding domains because these loops line the cavity running down the middle of the RecA filament. In fact, mutations in L2 loop affect the activities of RecA(13.Cazaux C. Larminat F. Villani G. Johnson N.P. Schnarr M. Defais M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8246-8254Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), although modifications in L1 loop are easily tolerated(14.Nastri H.G. Knight K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26311-26322Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). single-stranded DNA double-stranded DNA adenosine 5′-O-3-thiotriphosphate wild type poly(1, N6-ethenodeoxyadenosine) dithiothreitol 1, 4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid. Limited proteolysis of RecA-DNA complexes in the presence of ATPγS has shown that a peptide spanning loop L2 is protected from tryptic digestion(15.Gardner R.V. Voloshin O.N. Camerini-Otero R.D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 233: 419-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In addition, peptides derived from this region, including a 20-amino acid peptide from residues 193-212 can bind to ssDNA with a high affinity. Subsequent work has shown that such a peptide can also bind to dsDNA. In addition, a phenylalanine at position 203 in loop L2 that is highly conserved between prokaryotic RecAs and their eukaryotic homologues (16.Story R.M. Bishop D.K. Kleckner N. Steitz T.A. Science. 1993; 259: 1892-1896Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 17.Shinohara A. Ogawa H. Ogawa T. Cell. 1992; 69: 457-470Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1056) Google Scholar) plays a central role in the binding. Only aromatic acid substitutions allow the peptides to bind to both ss- and dsDNA. ( 2O. N. Voloshin, L. Wang, and R. D. Camerini-Otero, submitted for publication.) With the purpose of examining the possibility that this central aromatic residue in loop L2 interacts with DNA, we inserted a tryptophan residue in this loop in the place of phenylalanine. An interaction with DNA could then be detected by a change in the tryptophan fluorescence. Our results show that the modified protein is active, and its fluorescence is strongly decreased upon binding to DNA. Wild type RecA protein was purified as described previously(19.Takahashi M. Hagmar P. FEBS Lett. 1991; 279: 270-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The mutant gene encoding RecAF203W was obtained from the wt recA gene with the use of Muta-Gene Phagemide In Vitro Mutagenesis version 2 kit (Bio-Rad) in accordance with manufacturer's recommendations. Mutant RecAF203W protein was expressed in BLR(DEL3)pLys cells carrying pET9c plasmid (Novagen) with recAF203W gene; expression was induced by 0.4 mM isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactopyranoside over a 3-h period. The cells grown in 1 liter of LB medium were collected by low speed centrifugation, resuspended in 35 ml of 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 2 mM EDTA; the suspension was frozen at −80°C, thawed in an ice-water bath, and sonicated. The crude lysate was cleared by centrifugation at 18,000 rpm for 1 h in a SS-34 Sorvall rotor. 10% solution of polymin P (pH 8.0) was added to the lysate dropwise to the final concentration of 0.5%, and the solution was stirred for 30 min. The precipitate was collected by centrifugation in SS-34 Sorvall rotor for 30 min at 12,000 rpm and resuspended in 25 ml of 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mM ammonium sulfate, 10% glycerol, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM EDTA. The suspension was centrifuged in SS-34 Sorvall rotor for 30 min at 12,000 rpm, the supernatant was discarded, and the pallet was homogenized in 25 ml of 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 300 mM ammonium sulfate, 10% glycerol, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM EDTA. After centrifugation, the supernatant was loaded directly onto a MonoQ column (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.), and the column was developed with a linear gradient of NaCl (0-1 M) in 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mM EDTA. Finally, RecAF203W fraction was run through a HiLoad Superdex 75 column (Pharmacia), and the protein was dialyzed against 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 50 mM NaCl, 0.4 mM DTT, 0.1 mM EDTA. Poly(dA) (lot no. CJ 7836103) and poly(dT) (lot no. 2067834021) were from Pharmacia. Poly(d∊A) was prepared by modification of poly(dA) by chloroacetaldehyde (Merck), as described(20.Chabbert M. Lami H. Takahashi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5395-5400Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ATPγS was purchased from Boehringer Mannheim. Concentration of materials was estimated from UV absorption using the following absorption coefficients: ∊280= 2.17 × 104M-1 cm-1 for wt RecA, ∊280 = 2.73 × 104M-1 cm-1 for RecAF203W, ∊257 = 8.60 × 103M-1 cm-1 (in bases) for poly(dA), ∊264= 8.52 × 103M-1 cm -1 (in bases) for poly(dT), ∊260= 1.32 × 104M-1 cm-1 (in base pairs) for dsDNA, and ∊257= 3.7 × 103M-1 cm-1 (in bases) for poly(d∊A). All DNA concentrations are expressed as phosphate concentrations. Oligonucleotide T-50 spanning positions 395-444 of the non-coding strand of the pUC19 plasmid and pGEM4 DNA linearized with EcoRI were used as single- and double-stranded substrates, correspondingly, in DNA binding assays. 0.5 μM T-50 was incubated with 0-200 μM RecA in 40 μl of 25 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 20 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 0.4 mM DTT, 10 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.5 mM EDTA at 37°C. Because of the inability of RecA protein to bind dsDNA at pH 7.5(21.McEntee K. Weinstock G.M. Lehman I.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 8835-8844Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the experiments on binding to dsDNA were done in buffer containing 25 mM PIPES (pH 6.2) instead of Tris-HCl (pH 7.5); dsDNA was 1.35 μM, and RecA was 0-500 μM. Complexes formed after a 30-min incubation period were filtered using a double-filter system (22.Wong I. Lohman T.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5428-5432Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar) with BA85 nitrocellulose and NA45 DEAE membranes (Schleicher & Schuell). Data were quantitated with a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). All experiments were performed at 20°C in a buffer containing 5 mM K2HPO4, 15 mM KH2PO4, and 1 mM MgCl2, pH 6.4. The concentration of RecA and ATPγS was usually 1 μM and 10 μM, respectively. This concentration of ATPγS should be sufficient to saturate 1 μM RecA(23.Kowalczykowski S.C. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 5872-5881Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 24.Wittung P. Norden B. Takahashi M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 228: 149-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). DNA-RecA complexes were formed by addition of DNA to RecA solutions. For complete formation of ATPγS-RecA-DNA complexes, the mixture was incubated at least for 30 min at 20°C. Fluorescence was measured in a FP-777 spectrofluorometer (Jasco) at 20.0°C. The excitation wavelength was set at 295 nm with a bandwidth of 3 nm for selective excitation of tryptophan residues. The emission was usually measured at 345 nm with a bandwidth of 5 nm. For the measurement of excitation spectra of poly(d∊A) fluorescence, the fluorescence was observed at 450 nm to minimize the contribution of fluorescence from tryptophan residues. The bandwidths were 3 and 5 nm for excitation and emission, respectively. Fluorescence was measured in a 1.0 × 0.4-cm quartz cell to minimize the inner filter effect. The spectra were yet corrected for inner filter effect(25.Eriksson S. Norden B. Takahashi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1805-1810Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The spectra were also corrected for background and Raman scattering by subtracting the buffer signal. Spectra were averaged over at least two scans. The absorption was measured in a J-710 spectropolarimeter (Jasco) in UV absorption mode. The quartz cell was treated by silicon (Serva) to avoid the adsorption of protein to the wall. Fluorescence polarization anisotropy was measured in a FP-777 spectrofluorometer with the aide of ADP-301 automatic anisotropy measurement apparatus (Jasco). The temperature was set at 20.0°C, and the excitation and emission wavelengths were set at 295 nm (bandwidth of 3 nm) and 345 nm (bandwidth of 5 nm), respectively. The signal was averaged over 25 measurements of 0.5 s. Using site-directed mutagenesis, we introduced single amino acid substitution Phe →Trp in loop L2 of the RecA protein. Mutant RecAF203W protein was tested in DNA binding assay, and its activity was compared with wt RecA (Fig. 1). One can see that mutant RecAF203W protein is able to bind both ss- and dsDNA at the same, or even higher affinity, compared to wt protein. These data are in good agreement with our results on synthetic peptides spanning loop L2 region; Trp-substituted peptide possesses higher affinity to both ss- and dsDNA than the wild type Phe-containing peptide.2 The capability of the mutant and wt proteins to carry out the strand exchange reaction (26.McEntee K. Weinstock G.M. Lehman I.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 857-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar) and to form synaptic complexes (27.Hsieh P. Camerini O.C. Camerini O.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6492-6496Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) was also checked, and no significant difference between the two proteins was found (data not shown). To test recombinational activity of RecAF203W mutant in vivo, we examined it in trans-complementation assay. The mutant was entirely proficient in supporting plaque formation by mutant phage λ (red−gam−) on a lawn of bacterial cells carrying a plasmid expressing RecAF203W. ( 3E. Angov, O. Voloshin, and R. D. Camerini-Otero, unpublished observation.) We noted that the secondary structure of the modified protein was very similar to that of wt RecA (judged by circular dichroism, not shown). Fig. 2 shows fluorescence emission spectra of RecAF203W protein in the presence and absence of activator ATPγS. The spectra are compared with those of wild type RecA. The intensity of RecAF203W fluorescence was about two times larger than that of wt RecA. This was certainly due to additional fluorescence from the tryptophan residue inserted at position 203 in place of the phenylalanine. The differential fluorescence spectrum (fluorescence of RecAF203W - fluorescence of wt RecA) was centered around 345 nm (Fig. 2b), indicating that Trp-203 was well exposed to the solvent(28.Burstein E. Vedenkina E. Ivkova N. Photochem. Photobiol. 1973; 18: 263-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (1093) Google Scholar). No significant fluorescence change was detected upon the addition of ATPγS both for wild type and modified RecA. A slight change was sometimes observed but was probably related to slight temperature fluctuations and/or adsorption of protein on the wall of the quartz cell. Since further addition of ATPγS up to 100 μM did not significantly alter the protein fluorescence (not shown), the absence of a fluorescence change was not due to a reduced affinity of the modified protein for ATPγS. The addition of the physiological cofactor, ATP, up to 0.5 mM did not significantly modify the fluorescence of wt RecA or RecAF203W. The cofactor did not affect the fluorescence of Trp-203 and thus did not modify its environment. The anisotropy of Trp-203 fluorescence was also not modified upon binding to ATPγS. Thus the local motion of the residue was not affected by ATPγS. The anisotropy of RecAF203W was 0.150 and as large as that of wt RecA (0.145) both in the presence and absence of ATPγS. By subtraction of contribution from Trp-290 and Trp-308, which are also present in wt RecA, we got an anisotropy value r = 0.15 for Trp-203. The value was large and indicated that the local motion of Trp-203 was restricted. The local motion was slower than the lifetime of tryptophan, which is in the order of nanoseconds. Fig. 3 shows the fluorescence change of RecAF203W upon the addition of poly(dA) or poly(dT) in absence of cofactor. There was a large decrease in the intensity of RecAF203W fluorescence in contrast to no significant change of wt RecA fluorescence. The signal was corrected for the increase of the inner filter effect upon the addition of polynucleotides. Since these fluorescence experiments were made with a selective excitation of tryptophan residues, the fluorescence change was certainly due to a quenching of Trp-203 upon the binding of ssDNA. The fluorescence change was significantly smaller for poly(dA) (21% quenching) than poly(dT) (32% quenching). The former exhibits weaker binding affinity to RecA than poly(dT)(20.Chabbert M. Lami H. Takahashi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5395-5400Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, this difference was not due to an incomplete formation of RecA-poly(dA) complex because, as Fig. 4 shows, the fluorescence change was saturated about 5 bases of polynucleotide per RecA monomer for both poly(dA) and poly(dT). A similar binding stoichiometry was observed for wt RecA(29.Takahashi M. Kubista M. Norden B. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 205: 137-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Therefore, the slight difference between poly(dA) and poly(dT) may reflect a slight difference in the binding mode or the stability of the complexes. When we consider that the difference of fluorescence between RecAF203W and wt RecA simply corresponds to the fluorescence of Trp-203, the binding of poly(dA) and poly(dT) quench about 40 and 60% of Trp-203, respectively. Fig. 5 shows fluorescence change of RecAF203W upon the binding of poly(dA), poly(dT), or plasmid dsDNA in the presence of ATPγS. We can observe a large decrease of the fluorescence of RecAF203W upon complex formation in contrast to no significant fluorescence change for wt RecA upon interaction with any DNA. The absence of change in tryptophanyl fluorescence of wt RecA upon DNA binding has been reported previously(25.Eriksson S. Norden B. Takahashi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1805-1810Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The addition of any DNA with a ratio of 3 bases (or base pairs for dsDNA) per RecA, which should be just enough to saturate first site (site I), decreases the fluorescence of the protein about 20%. There was no significant difference for different DNAs. Poly(dA), poly(dT), and linearized ds plasmid DNA quenched the fluorescence to a similar extent. Further addition up to 9 base pairs per RecA of dsDNA did not any more change the fluorescence, while the addition of single-stranded polynucleotide further decreased the fluorescence (Fig. 5). We note that RecA bound only one chain of dsDNA with a stoichiometry of 3 base pairs per subunit but can bind up to three chains of ssDNA with a stoichiometry of 3 bases per subunit for each chain(29.Takahashi M. Kubista M. Norden B. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 205: 137-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 30.Takahashi M. Schnarr M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 183: 617-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The titration experiments indicate that RecAF203W binds to DNA with a similar binding stoichiometry as wt RecA (Fig. 4b). The fact that the addition of single-stranded polynucleotides exceeding the ratio of 3 bases per RecA further modifies the protein fluorescence is in contrast to the case with dsDNA and suggests that the binding of a second ssDNA (occupation of site II), as well as that of the first ssDNA (occupation of site I), decreases the fluorescence of Trp-203. The binding of the first DNA quenched about 40% of the Trp-203 fluorescence and that of the second DNA about 20%. The binding of a third DNA (occupation of site III) did not appear to affect the fluorescence (Fig. 4b). The same conclusion was obtained using heat-denatured calf thymus DNA as ssDNA. A significant blue shift in the emission spectra was observed upon the binding of two ssDNAs (not shown). The results above indicate that Trp-203 could be close to the DNA. To gain more structural information, we have investigated the presence of singlet-singlet energy transfer from the tryptophan residue to the fluorescent nucleobase of poly(d∊A), an analog of poly(dA). The presence of energy transfer has been examined by a change in shape of excitation spectra of poly(d∊A) upon the binding of RecA as it was performed for a poly(d∊A)-GP32 protein complex by Toulme and Helene(31.Toulme J.J. Helene C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1980; 606: 95-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The emission spectrum of tryptophan fluorescence partially overlaps with the absorption spectrum of poly(d∊A). Energy transfer, therefore, can occur and should be detected by enlargement of the excitation spectra of poly(d∊A) in the tryptophan absorption region (around 280 nm). In Fig. 6, the excitation spectrum of poly(d∊A) with RecAF203W is shown and compared with the spectrum of poly(d∊A) without RecA and that with wt RecA. The fluorescence signal from the protein is subtracted. The fluorescence of poly(d∊A) is strongly enhanced upon the binding of RecAF203W, although smaller than that by wt RecA (a 6.5-fold increase compared with a 9-fold increase by wt RecA). To facilitate the comparison of spectral shape, we have computed the ratio of fluorescence of complex/fluorescence of free poly(d∊A) at various wavelengths. The ratio is almost constant and independent of wavelength. There is not a large change in spectral shape upon the binding of RecAF203W. No significant change is observed upon the binding of wt RecA as reported previously(25.Eriksson S. Norden B. Takahashi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1805-1810Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since the two chromophores (Trp-203 and DNA bases) in the complex should be oriented (judged from their large anisotropy value), the absence of a large energy transfer between them could be due to their unfavorable relative orientation. The increase of poly(d∊A) fluorescence by the modified RecA may occur by the mechanism described for wt RecA(20.Chabbert M. Lami H. Takahashi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5395-5400Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Decrease in the mobility of the DNA bases upon RecA binding prevents the base-base collision and thus the dynamic quenching of poly(d∊A) fluorescence. By monitoring the fluorescence change of a tryptophan reporter residue inserted in loop L2 of RecA, we have investigated the role of this residue in the loop in its interactions with cofactor and DNA. Loop L2 in RecA crystal does not provide x-ray diffraction and is considered to be disordered or in several different conformations(9.Story R.M. Weber I.T. Steitz T.A. Nature. 1992; 355: 318-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar). This loop was proposed as a ssDNA binding site by Story et al.(9.Story R.M. Weber I.T. Steitz T.A. Nature. 1992; 355: 318-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar). Subsequent work has confirmed this proposal (15.Gardner R.V. Voloshin O.N. Camerini-Otero R.D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 233: 419-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) and extended it by showing that this loop also binds to dsDNA.2 The tryptophan reporter was inserted in the place of phenylalanine, another aromatic amino acid, and does not appear to significantly alter the activities in vitro or in vivo of RecA. The modified RecA enhances the fluorescence of the DNA analog poly(d∊A) as does wt RecA. The binding stoichiometries are not affected by this substitution. These results also suggest that the structure of the DNA-RecA complex is not so much altered by the insertion of the tryptophan. Therefore, the conclusions obtained from this fluorescence study of this tryptophan reporter should reflect the role of Phe-203 in wt RecA. The fluorescence changes of the modified RecA can be also used, in future, for kinetic and thermodynamic analysis of RecA-DNA interaction. The distance between the two ends (residue 194 and residue 210) of loop L2 in the crystal is only 0.7 nm, whereas loop L2 is 14 amino acid residues long. The loop could exist in various conformations, and residue 203, which is at the center of the loop, could be far from the ends of the loop. The fluorescence of Trp-203 estimated from the difference between the fluorescence of modified and wt RecA is centered around 345 nm and thus indicates that the residue is exposed to solvent. A large anisotropy value indicates that the local motion of Trp-203 is restricted. Thus, the loop should not be in fast motion, and the absence of diffraction from the loop in the x-ray analysis is probably due to the presence of various conformations. Absence of a fluorescence change upon the binding of nucleotide cofactor indicates that the residue is far from the cofactor. Story and Steitz (32.Story R.M. Steitz T.A. Nature. 1992; 355: 374-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar) proposed that Gln-194 in the loop may interact with γphosphate of ATP, but we did not observe a significant fluorescence change of Trp-203. There may be a rather large distance between Phe-203 and the γphosphate of ATP. The absence of fluorescence change upon cofactor binding also suggests that the residue may not be in the subunit-subunit interface because the cofactor is known to modify the helical organization of the protein (5.Takahashi M. Norden B. Adv. Biophys. 1994; 30: 1-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 33.DiCapua E. Cuillel M. Hewat E. Schnarr M. Timmins P.A. Ruigrok R.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 226: 707-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) probably by changing subunit-subunit interactions. In fact, the fluorescence intensity of RecAF203W, as that of wt RecA, is simply proportional to the protein concentration from 10 nM to 2 μM (not shown). The fluorescence is thus independent of association and dissociation of RecA subunits. The large fluorescence change of Trp-203 upon DNA binding both in the presence and absence of cofactor suggests that this region could be a DNA binding domain, although the fluorescence change can also occur indirectly upon a conformation change induced by DNA binding. Site-directed mutagenesis made in L2 loop by Cazaux et al.(13.Cazaux C. Larminat F. Villani G. Johnson N.P. Schnarr M. Defais M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8246-8254Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) show that loop L2 is important for various activities of RecA. These results indicate that this residue is involved in DNA binding. However, the quenching of fluorescence is not total. There may not be strong stacking interaction of Trp-203 with DNA bases, although intercalation of aromatic residues between DNA bases has been proposed (34.Kim S.K. Norden B. Takahashi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14799-14804Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The degree of quenching of Trp-203 fluorescence depends little upon the nature of the DNA bases. This, together with the absence of efficient energy transfer from Trp-203 to DNA bases, also suggests absence of a direct interaction between Trp-203 and the DNA bases. The fluorescence change occurs both in the presence and absence of cofactor. This indicates that DNA interacts with the same region of RecA in the presence and in the absence of cofactor, although the cofactor modifies the DNA binding mode of RecA. Our results also suggest that the binding of the second ssDNA occurs in the same part of RecA as that of the first ssDNA, although the fluorescence change upon the binding of the second DNA is smaller and not exactly the same. This suggests that site I and site II are very close to each other. Another interesting observation is that the fluorescence change promoted by dsDNA is similar to that by one ssDNA but smaller to that by two ssDNAs. One of the strands of dsDNA may interact with RecA in a similar way as the first ssDNA. By contrast, the second strand of dsDNA may not be interacting with this part of RecA. Such a model has been proposed previously(5.Takahashi M. Norden B. Adv. Biophys. 1994; 30: 1-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The binding of a third DNA may occur in a region different from loop L2. This is rather expected because the binding mode of a third ssDNA is clearly different from the binding mode of the first and second ssDNA(18.Kubista M. Takahashi M. Norden B. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18891-18897Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30.Takahashi M. Schnarr M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 183: 617-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar)."

The results are compared to those obtained on the Rieske protein of the cytochrome b6f complex (Em= +320 mV) and the water-soluble ferredoxin (Em= −430 mV) of spinach chloroplasts, as typical representatives of the gav=1.91 and gav=1.96 class of 2Fe2S centers. Properties common to all Rieske-type clusters and those restricted to the respective centers in bacterial oxygenases are discussed. The 2-halobenzoate 1,2-dioxygenase from Burkholderia (Pseudomonas) cepacia 2CBS (Fetzner, S., Müller, R., and Lingens, F.(1992) J. Bacteriol. 174, 279-290) contains both a ferredoxin-type and a Rieske-type 2Fe2S center. These two significantly different 2Fe2S clusters were characterized with respect to their EPR spectra, electrochemical properties (Rieske-type cluster with gz= 2.025, gy= 1.91, gx= 1.79, gav= 1.91, Em= −125 ± 10 mV; ferredoxin-type center with gz= 2.05, gy= 1.96, gx= 1.89, gav= 1.97, Em= −200 ± 10 mV) and pH dependence thereof.

Properties common to all Rieske-type clusters and those restricted to the respective centers in bacterial oxygenases are discussed. 2Fe2S clusters are usually divided into two distinct groups on the basis of their EPR spectra. The ferredoxin-type 2Fe2S centers are characterized by an average g-value of gav= 1.96, whereas the so-called Rieske-type 2Fe2S centers show a pronounced g-factor anisotropy with gav= 1.91. For a long time, the membership in either of the two classes was considered to be correlated with significantly different redox midpoint potentials, i.e. with an Em( 1The abbreviations used are: Emredox midpoint potentialgavaverage value of the g tensor, gav= 1/3(gz+ gy+ gx)MOPS3'-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acidESEEMelectron spin echo envelope modulationENDORelectron nuclear double resonance.) < −400 mV for the ferredoxins and an Em> +260 mV for the Rieske centers of the cytochrome bc complexes, the enzymes in which such a 2Fe2S center had been discovered (Rieske et al., 1964). The midpoint potential of the Rieske centers was supposed to arise from a different coordination of the cluster compared to ferredoxin-type centers. redox midpoint potential average value of the g tensor, gav= 1/3(gz+ gy+ gx) 3'-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid electron spin echo envelope modulation electron nuclear double resonance. To date, crystal structures of six 2Fe2S ferredoxins are available (Tsukihara et al., 1981; Tsutsui et al., 1983; Rypniewski et al., 1991; Sussman et al., 1989; Correll et al., 1992; Jacobson et al., 1993) showing that the iron atoms are coordinated by four cysteines and are bridged by a pair of acid-labile sulfur atoms. For the Rieske centers, no x-ray structure has been solved yet. The model of the cluster suggesting a coordination via two cysteines and two histidines is supported by 15N Q band ENDOR experiments on the terminal oxygenase of the phthalate dioxygenase from Pseudomonas cepacia (Gurbiel et al., 1989). Resonances in the frequency range below 10 MHz were attributed to two slightly inequivalent nitrogen nuclei from histidines interacting with one of the iron ions. The hyperfine coupling constants were claimed to be too high for only dipolar interaction postulating a covalent binding between the iron atom and the histidines. Further ENDOR, ESEEM, and extended x-ray absorption fine structure studies as well as results obtained from site-specific mutagenesis were interpreted in favor of this model (Gurbiel et al., 1991; Britt et al., 1991; Shergill and Cammack, 1994a; Powers et al., 1989; Tsang et al., 1989; Davidson et al., 1992). During recent years, the discovery of several “odd” systems weakened the clearcut Emdistinction between the gav= 1.91 and gav= 1.96 clusters. (a) 2Fe2S clusters contained in cytochrome bc complexes involved in oxidation of menaquinol have been characterized (Liebl et al., 1992; Riedel et al., 1993). These clusters show all characteristic features of the Rieske centers of cytochrome bc complexes except that their redox midpoint potential is about 150 mV lower ranging between +100 and +165 mV. (b) In bacterial oxygenases, 2Fe2S centers with gav= 1.91 (the “Rieske-type” centers) have been reported having midpoint potentials as low as −155 mV (Geary et al. 1984; Rosche et al. 1995b). (c) Ferredoxin-type gav= 1.96 clusters were found titrating as high as −174 mV in bacterial dioxygenases (Correll et al., 1992) or even at −7 mV for the center S1 in the mitochondrial succinate dehydrogenase (Cammack and Palmer, 1977; Shergill and Cammack, 1994b). Even if the generally higher Emof the Rieske-type centers is due to a histidine ligation, other factors have to be considered to explain the wide range of redox midpoint potentials such as a varying number of coordinated histidines, electrostatic effects of the surrounding amino acids or differences in the hydrogen bonds to the cluster. In this work, the EPR spectroscopic, electrochemical, 14N ESEEM, and 1H ENDOR characteristics of the gav= 1.91 and gav= 1.96 2Fe2S centers in 2-halobenzoate 1,2-dioxygenase from Burkholderia (Pseudomonas) cepacia 2CBS (Fetzner et al., 1992) are described and compared to other examples of these two classes of 2Fe2S centers, such as the Rieske center of the cytochrome b6f complex and the water-soluble ferredoxin from spinach. B. (Pseudomonas) cepacia 2CBS (DSM 9959) was grown in a chloride-free mineral salts-medium containing 2-chlorobenzoate as the sole source of carbon and energy (Fetzner et al., 1989). The two components of the 2-halobenzoate 1,2-dioxygenase were purified as described in Fetzner et al.(1992). However, for the gel filtration step of the oxygenase component, the Sephadex G-150 column was replaced by a Superdex 200 HiLoad 16/60 column (Fast Protein Liquid Chromatography (FPLC), Pharmacia Biotech, Freiburg, Germany). Cytochrome b6f complex was isolated from spinach chloroplasts modifying the preparation of Hauska (1986) according to Rich et al.(1987). 2Fe2S ferredoxin from spinach was obtained from Fluka (Germany). Redox titrations were carried out at pH 7 (50 mM MOPS) and pH 10.4 (50 mM glycine) according to Dutton(1971) using sodium dithionite for the reductive and porphyrexide for the oxidative titrations. The following mediators were used: methyl viologen, benzyl viologen, neutral red, safranine T, anthraquinone-2-sulfonate, anthraquinone-1,5-disulfonate, 2-hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone, 2,5-dihydroxy-p-benzoquinone, indigotetrasulfonate, pyocyanine, menadione, duroquinone, toluidine blue, phenazine ethosulfate, phenazine methosulfate, toluene blue, variamine blue, 2,5-dimethyl-p-benzoquinone, each at a concentration of 50 μM. EPR and ENDOR spectra were taken on a Bruker X band ER200 spectrometer with an Oxford helium cryostat and temperature control system. For the ENDOR experiments, the Bruker ENDOR unit UN810 (cavity, synthesizer, amplifier) was used. The ENDOR spectra were recorded at 6 K, and microwave and radio frequency power levels of 12-20 milliwatts and 150 watts, respectively, were applied. The ESEEM data were collected on a BRUKER ER300 spectrometer equipped with the ESP380/HR300 FT unit and a helium bath cryostat. The measurements were performed at 4.2 K according to the 3 pulse-stimulated echo procedure (90°-τ-90°-T-90°). FT transformation was carried out by using a modified version of the dead time reconstruction method of Mims(1984). Fig. 1 a shows the EPR spectra of the 2Fe2S clusters of the 2-halobenzoate 1,2-dioxygenase from Burkholderia cepacia 2CBS after reduction with dithionite at pH 7.0. The 2Fe2S cluster in the reductase component shows a ferredoxin-type spectrum (continuous line in Fig. 1a) with gz= 2.05, gy= 1.96, and gx= 1.89 (gav= 1.966), whereas the oxygenase component has the typical Rieske-type spectrum (marked with dots in Fig. 1a) with gz= 2.025, gy= 1.91, and gx= 1.79 resulting in the lower gavof 1.91. The results of the redox titration performed on the reductase and the oxygenase components at pH 7 monitored by EPR spectroscopy are shown in Fig. 1b. The redox midpoint potential of the ferredoxin center was determined to be −200 ± 10 mV, and the Rieske-type cluster in the terminal oxygenase titrated with an Emof −125 ± 10 mV. A titration at pH 10.4 of the gav= 1.91 cluster yielded a redox potential of around −90 ± 30 mV. The instability of the dioxygenase at high pH ( 2S. Fetzner, unpublished results.) resulted in higher experimental errors for the Emvalue measured at pH 10.4. The FT ESEEM spectrum obtained on the gav= 1.91 center from the 2-halobenzoate 1,2-dioxygenase is shown in Fig. 2a. The spectrum taken on the gysignal of the EPR absorption is characterized by modulations in the frequency range from 1-8 MHz with pronounced resonances at 2.3, 4.3, 6.2, and 7.8 MHz. Fig. 2, b and c, represents the respective FT ESEEM spectra obtained on the Rieske 2Fe2S cluster of purified cytochrome b6f complex and from spinach ferredoxin, respectively. The signals of the Rieske centers in the frequency range between 6 and 8 MHz have been attributed to double quantum transitions νdq+due to the magnetic interaction of the cluster with two inequivalent nitrogen nuclei with coupling constants of A1= 3.8 MHz and A2= 4.6 MHz and quadrupolar couplings of e2qQ = 2.5-2.9 MHz ( 3For the calculation of the quadrupole coupling constant, the asymmetry parameter ηwas varied between 0 and 1.) for both nitrogen nuclei (Britt et al., 1991). The gav= 1.91 2Fe2S center from the 2-halobenzoate 1,2-dioxygenase also shows signals in this frequency range. Quantitative analysis of our data following Britt et al.(1991) yields hyperfine couplings with A1= 3.7 MHz (and e2qQ = 2.0-2.3 MHz) and A2=4.7 MHz (with e2qQ = 3.6-4.1 MHz)3rather similar to the results obtained for the spinach Rieske center. By contrast, it has been reported that no distinct modulations can be detected on the plant-type ferredoxin in this range of frequencies deriving a hyperfine constant of A = 1.1 MHz for remote nitrogens (Fig. 2c, taken from Britt et al.(1991)). Fig. 3 shows a comparison of the 1H ENDOR spectra obtained on the gypeak of the Rieske-type center of the 2-halobenzoate 1,2-dioxygenase (Fig. 3a) with the respective spectra recorded on the Rieske protein of purified cytochrome b6f complex (Fig. 3b) and on spinach ferredoxin (Fig. 3c). The spectra show symmetrical hyperfine-split doublets centered about the Larmor frequency νh, as expected for hyperfine interaction with protons (I = 1/2). For the Rieske centers, we have detected up to 8 pairs of lines with hyperfine values between 0.5 and 10 MHz. Because of the low signal to noise ratio of the outer resonances, however, only the inner lines <7 MHz can be unambiguously assigned (Table 1). For the spinach ferredoxin, 9 pairs could be identified with coupling constants ranging between 0.1 and 11 MHz. The spectra shown in Fig. 3 are recorded with a relatively low modulation amplitude of 100 kHz in order to resolve narrow lines. The complete set of hyperfine couplings summarized in Table 1, i.e. the additional broader lines at the edges were taken from spectra measured with modulation amplitudes of 250 kHz (not shown).Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab We observed symmetrical 1H ENDOR spectra in all 2Fe2S clusters examined so far. The hyperfine coupling constants, however, vary considerably between these centers (Table 1). Since the ENDOR experiments are performed on frozen solutions, these differences could be due to differing numbers and/or strength of proton couplings or to differing dihedral angles between the respective hyperfine tensors and g tensors of the clusters. To address this question, a detailed study of the 1H ENDOR resonances throughout the EPR spectrum is in progress both for the cytochrome b6f complex and the spinach ferredoxin. The Rieske-type 2Fe2S cluster of the 2-halobenzoate 1,2-dioxygenase from B. cepacia 2CBS has been studied with respect to the EPR properties, the electrochemical potential, and pH dependence thereof, as well as with respect to 14N and 1H nuclei interacting with the cluster. The midpoint potential of −125 mV (at pH 7) for the gav= 1.91 2Fe2S cluster from the 2-halobenzoate 1,2-dioxygenase lies well in the range of potentials obtained so far for analogous clusters (Rosche et al., 1995b). Thus, the difference in redox midpoint potential of ferredoxin-type and Rieske-type 2Fe2S clusters can become rather small. The Rieske-type center of the 2-halobenzoate 1,2-dioxygenase from B. cepacia 2CBS was found to be only 75 mV more positive than the ferredoxin-type cluster in the same enzyme system. Similar to what was found for the phthalate dioxygenase (Kuila and Fee, 1986) and the 2-oxo-1,2-dihydroquinoline 8-monooxygenase (Rosche et al., 1995a, 1995b), ( 4B. Rosche and A. Riedel, unpublished results.) the redox midpoint potential of the Rieske-type center in the 2-halobenzoate 1,2-dioxygenase does not depend on pH within the experimental errors between pH 6 and pH 10.4. This behavior is significantly different from what is found for the centers from cytochrome bc complexes (see below). gav= 1.91 2Fe2S clusters were found with redox midpoint potentials at (a) +400 mV in plasma membranes of the archaeon Sulfolobus acidocaldarius (Anemüller et al., 1993, 1994), (b) at around +300 mV in cytochrome bc1and b6f complexes with ubiquinonol and plastoquinol as electron donors to the complex (Ding et al., 1992; Nitschke et al., 1992), (c) at around +130 mV in the menaquinol-oxidizing cytochrome bc complexes (Liebl et al., 1992; Riedel et al. 1993), and (d) at around −100 mV in bacterial oxygenases (Mason and Cammack, 1992; Rosche et al., 1995b). The class of these 2Fe2S centers thus covers a range of more than 500 mV. The high redox midpoint potential of the gav= 1.91 class as compared to the ferredoxins was proposed to be due to non-sulfur and less-electron donating ligands to the cluster. In fact, hyperfine couplings from nitrogen nuclei on two inequivalent histidine residues were detected and the respective histidines were proposed to be ligands to the cluster (Gurbiel et al., 1989, 1991; Britt et al., 1991; Shergill and Cammack, 1994a). Since the range of redox potentials determined in the gav= 1.91 clusters (>500 mV) is significantly larger than the smallest difference between a gav= 1.91 and a gav= 1.96 center (75 mV, see above), one could speculate that the number of these crucial histidines might vary thereby tuning the electrochemical potentials. This is clearly not the case. The presence of hyperfine couplings arising from two inequivalent nitrogen nuclei seems to be a common feature of the gav= 1.91 2Fe2S centers found in the bacterial oxygenases as well as in cytochrome bc complexes (Fig. 2). According to the interpretation of Gurbiel et al.(1989), this indicates that in all these systems one of the two iron atoms is coordinated by two histidines instead of cysteines. In this context, it is worth mentioning that all Rieske centers examined so far contain (at least) four cysteines and two histidines in their amino acid sequence (for cytochrome bc complexes, see Hauska et al. (1988) and Schütz et al.(1994); for the 2-halobenzoate 1,2-dioxygenase, see Haak et al.(1995)). While the presence of strongly coupled histidines may be linked to the on average higher Emvalue of the gav= 1.91 clusters, additional effects must play important roles in modulating the redox midpoint potentials. As a possible candidate, we propose the structure of the network of hydrogen bonds toward the cluster (see also Backes et al.(1991)). In the work of Cline et al.(1985) and Telser et al. (1987), 1H ENDOR spectra of the Rieske center in the phthalate dioxygenase, in Thermus thermophilus, and the mitochondrial complex III have been reported. The respective spectra, however, were absorption spectra and significantly less well-resolved than those of Fig. 3. Furthermore, the interpretation of the data was later disclaimed by the authors themselves (Gurbiel et al., 1989). As can be seen from our data (Fig. 3) and the work of Shergill and Cammack (1994a) on the Rieske center from bovine heart mitochondria, the pattern of proton couplings varies significantly on going from the Rieske centers from cytochrome bc complexes to those of the bacterial oxygenases. As mentioned above, however, a more detailed comparison of the strengths, numbers, and spatial distribution of 1H couplings to the clusters has to await determination of complete ENDOR data sets and, if possible, the collection of data on site-directed mutants of the respective proteins. Despite their midpoint potential differing by ∼150 mV, all Rieske centers from cytochrome bc complexes share the same pH dependence, i.e. constant Embelow pH 8 and decreasing Emwith a slope > −60 mV per pH unit above pH 8.0 (Prince and Dutton, 1976; Riedel et al., 1993). In these centers, the involvement of two deprotonatable groups having distinct pK values has been proposed (Liebl et al., 1992; Nitschke et al., 1992; Link et al., 1992; Link, 1994). In the gav= 1.91 center found in the archaeon S. acidocaldarius, however, the midpoint potential becomes pH-dependent already above pH 6.0. In this system, the presence of a second deprotonatable group on the oxidized cluster could be unambiguously observed. The pK values were determined to be at 6.2 and 8.5 (Anemüller et al., 1994). By contrast, the Emof the Rieske-type clusters of the bacterial oxygenases was seen to be independent of pH between pH 7 and 10.4. If the Rieske centers of the oxygenases should behave similarly to the above described systems, then their first pK must be above pH 10.4. Previously, it was proposed for the Rieske centers in cytochrome bc complexes that the pH dependence of their Emvalues arises from the protonation/deprotonation equilibria on the N∊nitrogen atom of the two putative histidine ligands (Kuila and Fee, 1986; Liebl et al., 1992; Link et al., 1992; Link, 1994). However, the results obtained on the bacterial oxygenases (with a possible first pK not lower than pH 10.4) and those recently reported for the gav= 1.91 cluster in S. acidocaldarius (first pK at 6.2) suggest some caution concerning this interpretation. Shifts of the pK values of histidines (pK ∼6.0 for free histidine) by four pH units are at the limit of what can be expected to be induced by the protein environment of these residues. Moreover, the Emversus pH curves determined for the ferredoxin-type 2Fe2S clusters showing a decrease of the Emvalue by −30 mV/pH unit for putidaredoxin (Wilson et al., 1973) and −60 mV/pH for center N1 of beef heart mitochondria (Ingledew and Ohnishi, 1980) indicate that a significant pH dependence of the Emcan be induced by the protein environment of the clusters without having to invoke deprotonation of ligands. Therefore, we suggest that the interpretation of the pH dependence of the midpoint potential of the gav= 1.91 2Fe2S centers might be more complicated than previously proposed (see, for example, Link(1994)). It does not seem unreasonable to us that the pH dependence arises from other amino acid residues than the two histidines hyperfine-coupled to the cluster. Site-specific mutagenesis directed to possible hydrogen bond-forming residues in the cluster's binding region of the sequence or even a re-examination of already existing mutants might yield crucial information pertinent to this question. We thank David Britt (University of California, Davis), Adolf Müller-Broich (Universität Regensburg), and Günter Hauska (Universität Regensburg) for stimulating discussions."

In some bacterial cytochrome c oxidases but not in quinol oxidases, a binuclear, mixed-valence copper site called the Cua center and/or an additional low-spin heme c center(s) are located in subunit II(2.Saraste M.

Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3120-3127Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), all metal centers of the bacterial oxidases are located at subunits I and II of the superfamily. Certain bacterial cytochrome c-oxidizing heme-copper oxidases have been reported to form a stable membrane-bound cytochrome bc1-c-aa3“supercomplex” with the cognate cytochrome c and cytochrome bc1 complex, which, as a whole, functions as a terminal quinol oxidase supercomplex(18.Berry E.A.

Chem. 1987; 262: 15386-15391Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). While c-type cytochrome is absent in several aerobic respiratory archaea containing an aa3-type cytochrome oxidase(20.Anemüller S. Lübben M. Schäfer G. FEBS Lett. 1985; 193: 83-87Crossref Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 21.Wakagi T. Oshima T. Syst. Appl. Microbiol. 1986; 7: 295-304Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 22.Fujiwara T. Fukumori Y. Yamanaka T. Plant Cell Physiol. 1987; 28: 29-36Google Scholar, 23.Anemüller S. Schmidt C.L. Pacheco I. Schäfer G. Teixeira M. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1994; 117: 275-280Crossref Google Scholar), this feature has been shown to exist also in two different species of the thermoacidophilic archaea Sulfolobales, which are phylogenetically only distantly related to bacteria on the basis of the universal phylogenetic tree (24.Woese C.R. Microbiol. Rev. 1987; 51: 221-271Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25.Woese C.R. Kandler O. Wheelis M.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4576-4579Crossref PubMed Scopus (4513) Google Scholar). The first evidence for the presence of the terminal oxidase supercomplex in archaea came from the genetic and subsequent biochemical studies on the SoxABCD oxidase from the thermoacidophilic archaeon Sulfolobus acidocaldarius strain DSM 639(10.Lübben M. Kolmerer B. Saraste M. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 805-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 26.Lübben M. Warne A. Albracht S.P.J. Saraste M. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 13: 327-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), which appears to consist of a apo-cytochrome b homologue of cytochrome bc1 complex (SoxC) in addition to subunits I and II of the heme-copper oxidase superfamily and several additional small polypeptides. The authors have proposed that the SoxABCD oxidase might contain four heme AS centers and one copper (Cub), but no protoheme centers (26.Lübben M. Warne A. Albracht S.P.J. Saraste M. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 13: 327-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Quite recently, the archaeon appears to contain a second terminal oxidase supercomplex, namely SoxM oxidase, which has been partially purified but apparently in a partially denatured form(27.Lübben M. Arnaud S. Castresana J. Warne A. Albracht S.P.J. Saraste M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 224: 151-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the SoxM oxidase complex contains a Rieske-type FeS cluster in addition to both protoheme and the heme AS center in a ratio of ∼1:3(27.Lübben M. Arnaud S. Castresana J. Warne A. Albracht S.P.J. Saraste M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 224: 151-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Thus, while both terminal oxidase complexes of S. acidocaldarius apparently contain the apo-cytochrome b homologue (e.g. SoxC), it remains to be clarified why a Rieske FeS center (28.Anemüller S. Schmidt C.L. Schäfer G. Teixeira M. FEBS Lett. 1993; 318: 61-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) has been found only in the SoxM oxidase (27.Lübben M. Arnaud S. Castresana J. Warne A. Albracht S.P.J. Saraste M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 224: 151-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) but not in the SoxABCD oxidase(26.Lübben M. Warne A. Albracht S.P.J. Saraste M. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 13: 327-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Sulfolobus sp. strain 7 (formerly S. acidocaldarius strain 7) is another example of a typical thermoacidophilic archaeon, which grows optimally at 75-80°C and at pH 2.5-3. As in the cases of other aerobic respiratory archaea such as S. acidocaldarius strain DSM 639 (20.Anemüller S. Lübben M. Schäfer G. FEBS Lett. 1985; 193: 83-87Crossref Scopus (55) Google Scholar) and Halobacterium salinarium(22.Fujiwara T. Fukumori Y. Yamanaka T. Plant Cell Physiol. 1987; 28: 29-36Google Scholar), it contains only the a- and b-type cytochromes, but no c-type cytochromes(21.Wakagi T. Oshima T. Syst. Appl. Microbiol. 1986; 7: 295-304Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Because of the unique phylogenetic status of Sulfolobus in the 16 S rRNA sequence tree(24.Woese C.R. Microbiol. Rev. 1987; 51: 221-271Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25.Woese C.R. Kandler O. Wheelis M.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4576-4579Crossref PubMed Scopus (4513) Google Scholar), the elucidation of the overview of the archaeal aerobic respiratory chain is a very challenging task. As described in the preceding paper(29.Iwasaki T. Matsuura K. Oshima T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30881-30892Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), we have shown the presence of at least four distinct heme centers (b562, a583, and aa3) in the membranes of Sulfolobus sp. strain 7, which have been copurified as a novel terminal oxidase supercomplex notably containing a Rieske FeS center. In addition, we have also shown that cytochrome b562, which is probably in the upstream of the a-type cytochromes in the intramolecular electron transfer, is possibly equivalent to the heme bIIcenter of the conventional cytochrome bc1 complex (30.von Jagow G. Link T.A. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 126: 253-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar, 31.Trumpower B.L. Microbiol. Rev. 1990; 54: 101-129Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32.Trumpower B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11409-11412Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in terms of the redox function(29.Iwasaki T. Matsuura K. Oshima T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30881-30892Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Thus, while the overall feature of the purified cytochrome supercomplex resembles S. acidocaldarius SoxM oxidase complex(27.Lübben M. Arnaud S. Castresana J. Warne A. Albracht S.P.J. Saraste M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 224: 151-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), our results are in sharp contrast to the previous proposal by Lübben et al.(10.Lübben M. Kolmerer B. Saraste M. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 805-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 26.Lübben M. Warne A. Albracht S.P.J. Saraste M. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 13: 327-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) that the SoxC protein might contain two heme aS centers (cytochrome a586) but no protoheme center. On the other hand, a functional account of a high-potential and unusual a-type cytochrome a583 of Sulfolobus sp. strain 7 (Em,6,8 = +270 mV(29.Iwasaki T. Matsuura K. Oshima T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30881-30892Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar)) remains to be studied, because of the overall complexity of the archaeal purified cytochrome supercomplex. One way to overcome a complexity of a multisubunit complex metalloprotein and to elucidate possible roles of its individual redox centers, may be to resolve it into much simpler but catalytically active subcomplexes and/or subunits in vitro, as performed in the mitochondrial NADH:quinone oxidoreductase complex (the respiratory complex I)(33.Ragan C.I. Curr. Top. Bioenerg. 1987; 15: 1-36Crossref Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 34.Finel M. Skehel J.M. Albracht S.P.J. Fearnley I.M. Walker J.E. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 11425-11434Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). In this paper, we report the purification and the spectroscopic and catalytic properties of two different forms of the a-type cytochrome oxidase from Sulfolobus sp. strain 7, in order to assign a possible function of the unusual cytochrome a583 in the archaeal aerobic respiratory chain. In addition, we report the EPR evidence for non bis-histidine ligation of the low-spin heme a583 center. Furthermore, in conjunction with our data presented in the preceding paper(29.Iwasaki T. Matsuura K. Oshima T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30881-30892Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), we propose a novel conserving mechanism for the terminal oxidase supercomplex from Sulfolobus sp. strain 7, which differs considerably from the recent proposals for S. acidocaldarius Sox oxidase complexes by Lübben et al.(10.Lübben M. Kolmerer B. Saraste M. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 805-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). A preliminary account of this work has been reported elsewhere(35.Wakagi T. Yamauchi T. Oshima T. Müller M. Azzi A. Sone N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 165: 1110-1114Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). MEGA-9 ( 1The abbreviations used are: MEGA-9nanoyl-N-methylglucamideMEGA-10decanoyl-N-methylglucamideHOQNO2-heptyl-4-hydroxyquinoline-N-oxidePAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisTMPDN,N,N',N'-tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine.) and MEGA-10 were purchased from Dojin (Kumamoto, Japan), sodium cholate from Sigma, sucrose monocaprate and sucrose monolaurate from Mitsubishi Kasei Co. (Tokyo, Japan), and lauryl maltoside (n-dodecyl β-D-maltoside) from Boehringer Mannheim, respectively. DEAE-Toyopearl 650 M, hydroxylapatite (Bio-Gel HTP), and Sephacryl S-200 were purchased from Tosoh Corp., Bio-Rad, and Pharmacia Biotech Inc., respectively. Heme A and protoheme were prepared by HCl/acetone extraction from bovine heart cytochrome aa3 and hemoglobin (Sigma), respectively. Hemes O and ASwere prepared from the membrane fractions of Escherichia coli(36.Puustinen A. Wikström M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 6122-6126Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) and Thermus thermophilus(37.Hon-nami K. Oshima T. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 454-460Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 38.Lübben M. Morand K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21473-21479Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), respectively. Caldariellaquinone was isolated from the membrane of Sulfolobus sp. strain 7, as described previously by De Rosa et al.(39.De Rosa M. De Rosa S. Gambacorta A. Minale L. Thomson R.H. Worthington R.D. J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans. 1977; 1: 653-657Crossref Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Horse heart cytochrome c (type VI) was purchased from Sigma. Water was purified by the Milli-Q purification system (Millipore). Other chemicals mentioned in this study were of analytical grade. nanoyl-N-methylglucamide decanoyl-N-methylglucamide 2-heptyl-4-hydroxyquinoline-N-oxide polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis N,N,N',N'-tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine. Sulfolobus sp. strain 7 was cultivated at pH 2.5-3.0 and at 75-80°C as described previously(21.Wakagi T. Oshima T. Syst. Appl. Microbiol. 1986; 7: 295-304Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 40.Wakao H. Wakagi T. Oshima T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1987; 102: 255-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), and was harvested in the early to middle exponential phase of growth. The archaeal membranes were prepared as described in the preceding paper(29.Iwasaki T. Matsuura K. Oshima T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30881-30892Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), and immediately used for the subsequent purification of the membrane-bound cytochromes (see below). The terminal oxidase supercomplex containing both a- and b-type cytochromes was solubilized and purified from the archaeal membranes as described in the preceding paper(29.Iwasaki T. Matsuura K. Oshima T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30881-30892Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The following purification steps were carried out at 25-30°C to avoid the precipitation of MEGA-10, by following the absorption at 280 and 422 nm and the reduced-minus-oxidized difference spectrum of each fraction at different purification steps, unless otherwise specified. To the membranes were added a solution of 5% (w/v) cholate and 50 mM EDTA to final concentrations of 1% and 10 mM, respectively, and the mixture was gently stirred for 120 min at room temperature. While both the a- and b-type cytochromes were not solubilized at this stage, some loosely bound proteins (such as an NADH dehydrogenase(40.Wakao H. Wakagi T. Oshima T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1987; 102: 255-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar)) were solubilized and removed by ultracentrifugation at 130,000 × g for 60 min at 20°C. The washed membrane was made to 0.5% (w/v) MEGA-9, 1% (w/v) MEGA-10, 0.5 mM EDTA, and 20 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.5, and the resulting mixture was gently stirred for 120 min at 25-30°C. Then, the MEGA-9/MEGA-10 extract containing the solubilized cytochromes were collected by ultracentrifugation at 130,000 × g for 60 min at 25°C. The MEGA-9/MEGA-10 extract was applied to a hydroxylapatite column (3.2 × 10 cm) equilibrated with distilled water. Then, the cytochromes were eluted with a 400-ml linear gradient of 80-400 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.5, containing 0.5% (w/v) MEGA-9 and 1% (w/v) MEGA-10. At this stage, two different forms of the a-type cytochrome oxidase were separately obtained, in addition to a partially-denatured cytochrome complex containing both the a- and b-type cytochromes (29.Iwasaki T. Matsuura K. Oshima T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30881-30892Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar); of these, only two a-type cytochromes were further purified separately hereafter. Each combined fraction was then rechromatographed in the same conditions. The pooled fractions were brought to 15% with polyethylene glycol-6000, and the resulting precipitates were collected by centrifugation. They were dissolved in 20 mM potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.8, containing 0.5% (w/v) MEGA-9, 1% (w/v) MEGA-10, 0.1 mM EDTA, and ∼50% (v/v) glycerol, and then applied to a Sephacryl S-200 gel filtration column equilibrated with 100 mM potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.8, containing 0.5% (w/v) MEGA-9, 1% (w/v) MEGA-10, and 0.1 mM EDTA. The cytochrome peak fractions were collected, and checked for purity by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of SDS. The purified a-type cytochromes were stored at −80°C until use. Solubilization and purification of the archaeal membrane-bound respiratory complex II (succinate:quinone oxidoreductase complex) was carried out as described in the accompanying paper(41.Iwasaki T. Wakagi T. Oshima T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30902-30908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). A ferrocytochrome c oxidase activity was measured spectrophotometrically at 50°C according to Wakagi et al.(35.Wakagi T. Yamauchi T. Oshima T. Müller M. Azzi A. Sone N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 165: 1110-1114Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) with horse heart ferrocytochrome c as an electron donor. A caldariellaquinol oxidase activity was measured spectrophotometrically at 50°C according to Anemüller and Schäfer(42.Anemüller S. Schäfer G. FEBS Lett. 1989; 244: 451-455Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The in vitro reconstitution of the Sulfolobus succinoxidase respiratory chain was monitored polarographically at 50°C with a Clark-type oxygen electrode (Oxygen analyzer MP-1000, Iizima Products, Tokyo, Japan) equipped with temperature-controlled cells. A preliminary test for a proton pumping activity of the purified cytochrome subcomplexes of Sulfolobus was performed according to Sone and Yanagita (43.Sone N. Yanagita Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 1405-1408Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), using ferrocytochrome c as an electron donor. Absorption spectra were recorded with a Hitachi U-3210 spectrophotometer equipped with a thermoelectric cell holder, or with a Shimadzu MPS-2000 spectrophotometer. EPR measurements were carried out using a JEOL JEX-RE1X spectrometer equipped with an Air Products model LTR-3 Heli-Tran cryostat system, in which temperature was monitored with a Scientific Instruments series 5500 temperature indicator/controller. Protein was measured by the BCA assay (Pierce Chemical Co.) with bovine serum albumin as a standard. Types of hemes were determined according to Sone and Fujiwara(44.Sone N. Fujiwara Y. FEBS Lett. 1991; 288: 154-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), using hemes A, AS, and O, and protoheme as standards (36.Puustinen A. Wikström M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 6122-6126Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 38.Lübben M. Morand K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21473-21479Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The heme contents were determined by the pyridine hemochromogen method(38.Lübben M. Morand K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21473-21479Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 45.Berry E.A. Trumpower B.L. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 161: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (746) Google Scholar). The metal contents of the purified enzyme were determined by the inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry with a Seiko SPS 1500 VR instrument. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of SDS was carried out according to Laemmli (46.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207211) Google Scholar) on 13 or 15% gels, after treating proteins with 2% SDS in the presence of 5% 2-mercaptoethanol at 50-70°C for 2 min, and proteins were visualized by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining, or silver staining with a Wako Pure Chemicals kit. Fig. 1 shows a typical elution profile of the membrane-bound cytochromes of Sulfolobus sp. strain 7 solubilized in the presence of MEGA-9 plus MEGA-10, from a hydroxylapatite column. While the archaeal membrane exhibits four spectrophotometrically and potentiometrically distinct heme centers, i.e. b562, a583, and aa3(29.Iwasaki T. Matsuura K. Oshima T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30881-30892Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), this method allowed the decomposition of some amounts of the terminal cytochrome supercomplex into and the separation of two different forms of the a-type cytochromes from the rest of the cytochrome complex (Fig. 1, top). The a-type cytochrome with an absorption peak at 603 nm in the reduced minus oxidized difference spectrum is referred to as cytochrome aa3, and that with two absorption peaks at 583 and 604 nm in the reduced minus oxidized difference spectrum is referred to as cytochrome a583-aa3 subcomplex, respectively. For efficient separation of these a-type cytochromes, the presence of relatively strong detergents such as MEGA-10 and the repetition of the hydroxylapatite column chromatography step appeared to be essential factors. Typical purification data of these a-type cytochromes are summarized in Table 1. For the cytochrome a583-aa3 subcomplex, an increase in the specific ferrocytochrome c oxidase activity was nicely accompanied by an enrichment of the specific heme AS content, as the purification proceeded. On the other hand, a ferrocytochrome c oxidase activity was abolished in purified cytochrome aa3.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab Fig. 2 shows the subunit compositions of highly purified cytochrome aa3 and cytochrome a583-aa3 subcomplexs from Sulfolobus sp. strain 7. Purified cytochrome aa3 was composed of a single subunit with an apparent molecular mass of 40 kDa on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2, lane 2), while the cytochrome a583-aa3 subcomplex was composed of three different subunits with apparent molecular masses of 40, 24, and 14 kDa on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2, lane 4), respectively. Gel filtration analysis indicated that both purified a-type cytochromes have almost identical apparent molecular masses of ∼130-150 kDa (data not shown). Fig. 3 shows the optical properties of purified cytochrome aa3 and cytochrome a583-aa3 subcomplex. Heme analysis of the purified a-type cytochromes using reverse-phase column chromatography and pyridine ferrohemochrome spectra suggested the presence of only heme AS, as opposed to the case of the Sulfolobus membrane which contains both heme AS and protoheme (data not shown; cf.

The reduced minus oxidized difference spectrum of purified cytochrome aa3 exhibits maxima at 442 and 603 nm (Fig. 3A). Its CO-difference spectrum shows maxima at 429 and 595 nm and a minimum at 444 nm, which is characteristic of that of the aa3-type heme-copper oxidase (Fig. 3B).

FASEB J. 1993; 7: 896-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar)). Although WT1 is expressed in uterus, spinal cord, spleen, abdominal wall musculature, and the mesothelial lining of organs within the thoracic cavity, its highest expression is in the developing urogenital system(6.Kreidberg J.A.

The WT1 gene encodes four splice variants of a transcription factor containing a glutamine/proline-rich N terminus and four carboxyl Cys2His2 type zinc fingers, which recognize 5′-GCGGGGGCGGTG-3′ and redundant 5′-TCC-3′ cis motifs (7.Haber D.A.

Alternative splice I allows the variable insertion of exon 5 between the transactivating and DNA binding domains of WT1. Alternative splice II allows the variable insertion of nine nucleotides encoding lysine, threonine, and serine (+KTS or -KTS) between the third and fourth zinc fingers(7.Haber D.A. Sohn R.L.

WT1 cis motifs are also recognized by another Cys2His2 type zinc finger transcription factor EGR-1 also known as NGF1-A, Krox 24, TIS-8, and Zif 268, which is induced after mitogenic and differentiation cues in several cell types (reviewed in (10.Sukhatme V.P. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1990; 1: 859-866Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)). In contrast to EGR-1, WT1 appears to predominantly function as a transcriptional repressor of several growth-related genes including EGR-1, insulin-like growth factor II, platelet-derived growth factor α chain, insulin-like growth factor I receptor, colony-stimulating factor 1, transforming growth factor β1, and Pax2 (reviewed in (11.Drummond, I. A., Sukhatme, V. P. (1996) in Molecular Basis of MedicGoogle Scholar)). WT1 mutations prevent DNA binding or transcriptional repressive functions that are postulated to allow the constitutive expression of growth factors leading to renal neoplasia. Consistent with this possibility, suppression of colony formation occurs in WT cells transfected with wild type WT1 isoforms(12). Wilms' tumor phosphate-buffered saline base pair(s). Further insights into molecular cascades linking WT1 to target genes in renal cells would clearly be advantageous. WTs occur with greater frequency in pediatric kidneys containing persistent renal stem cells, a condition designated nephroblastomatosis or nephrogenic rests. WT1 mutations occur in these rests, suggesting they may represent a transitional cell preceding malignancy(13). Embryonal kidney cell tumors reminiscent of WT can be induced in rats given the alkylating agent N-nitroso-N′-methyl urea(14). However, cultured cells have yet to be developed from these sources. We have previously identified genes participatory for epithelial cell growth and differentiation events in LLC-PK1 cells, an extensively characterized cultured epithelial cell line derived from juvenile male pig kidney(15). These studies indicated that as in lower eukaryotic organisms such as Dictyostelium(16, 17, 18) and Drosophila(19), heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide binding (G) proteins are involved in signal transduction pathways required for both growth and cellular differentiation programs in renal cells. G proteins are composed of individual α, β, and γsubunits that are encoded by gene superfamilies that have been conserved by eukaryotes throughout evolution (reviewed in (20)). Most of the transducing activities of G proteins in mammalian cells are associated with the state of activation of the α subunit, which is involved in GDP/GTP exchange and GTP hydrolysis (reviewed in (21) and (22)). G proteins can alter cell growth or differentiation by participation in growth factor receptor signaling pathways that converge in the nucleus to alter gene expression. Mutations in Gαi−2 comparable with Ha-ras GP21, which decrease GTPase activity, are found in tumors of the adrenal cortex and ovary(23). Such mutations, which convert the Gαi−2 gene into the oncogene gip2 induce increased growth and oncogenic transformation in Rat-1a cells(24). Increased growth may be a consequence of persistent activation of pathways coupled to mitogen-activated protein kinase (25). The Gαi−2 subunit interacts with pathways required for differentiation of F9 teratocarcinoma cells(26). Even modest repression of Gαi−2 expression is associated with renal developmental and morphologic abnormalities in transgenic mice, underscoring its important role in renal differentiation events(27). Polarized LLC-PK1 cells contain two Gαi isoforms, Gαi−2 and Gαiα, which are involved, respectively, in the regulation of hormone-stimulated adenylyl cyclase and constitutive proteoglycan secretion through the Golgi complex(28, 29). The genes encoding both Gαi subunits are transcriptionally activated in these cells in a coordinated manner during growth and differentiation but differ in response to glucocorticoids and cAMP(30, 31, 32). We recently determined in mitotically active predifferentiated LLC-PK1 cells that the temporal expression of EGR-1 is one molecular mechanism for both maximal activation of the Gαi−2 gene and accelerated growth in these cells. These events were dependent on an enhancer area in the 5′-flanking region of the Gαi−2 gene that contains an EGR-1 motif (5′-CGCCCCCGC-3′)(33). Notably, acquisition of the polarized phenotype in LLC-PK1 cells was accompanied by loss of EGR-1 expression and occupancy of the EGR-1 site by nuclear binding proteins other than EGR-1. In the present study we determine whether one of these binding proteins is WT1. Wild type LLC-PK1 cells are a polarized epithelial cell line derived from pig kidney. Cells were grown as confluent monolayers and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10 or 0.1% fetal calf serum in a 5% CO2 atmosphere as described previously(15). Cells were plated at a density of 1 × 106/10 cm2, achieving confluence at approximately culture day 7. pRSV (WT1) and pRSV (Gαi−2) are plasmids containing, respectively, the entire coding sequence of human WT1 and the entire coding sequence of rodent G-protein αi−2 subunit driven by a Rous sarcoma virus promoter. Two plasmids m-14 LUC or m-4 LUC containing or lacking a putative EGR-1 binding sequence (5′-CGCCCCCGC-3′) were generated from nested deletions of plasmid 10-4 LUC (XmaIII), which contains an αi−2 5′-flanking sequence fused to a firefly luciferase reporter gene as described previously(30). A third plasmid-mutated m-14 LUC that replaced the nucleotides 1-5 of the EGR-1 site with adenosines was generated by polymerase chain reaction mutagenesis as described previously (33) utilizing the mutagenizing primer, 5′-CGGGCTACGAGATCCGCCAAAAACCGCCGTCGGGCAGCGGAG-3′. Plasmids containing this DNA segment were confirmed by dideoxynucleic acid sequencing. Plasmids were transfected in equimolar amounts into LLC-PK1 cells by calcium phosphate precipitation as described previously(30). Optimum transfection efficiency was obtained by the addition of 20 μg of total plasmid DNA/55-cm2 p10 plate (Falcon) followed by incubation for 20 h without glycerol shock. When required, this amount of DNA was achieved by the addition of “carrier plasmid” Bluescript II KS+. Transfection efficiency was normalized by co-transfection with 2.5 μg of pSV2Apap, a plasmid carrying a human placental alkaline phosphatase reporter gene driven by a Rous sarcoma virus promoter (generously provided by T. Kadesch, University of Pennsylvania). Forty-eight to 98 h after transfection, LLC-PK1 cells were washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline (without calcium or magnesium) and then lysed by addition of 1.0 ml of lysis buffer A (1% Triton, 25 mM glycylglycine, pH 7.8, 15 mM MgSO4, 4 mM EGTA, and 1 mM fresh dithiothreitol). Scraped lysates were transferred to Eppendorf microfuge tubes and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 5 min at 4°C. The supernatants were transferred to fresh Eppendorf tubes and briefly vortexed prior to each assay. In some experiments the cell number of each plate was determined by direct cell count of trypsinized cells utilizing inverted phase microscopy. These were performed as described previously(30). Results are expressed as percent increase ± S.E. in luciferase activity normalized for heat-insensitive alkaline phosphatase activity. Data were analyzed by the paired Student's t test. This was performed by the dye binding assay of Bradford as described by the manufacturer (Bio-Rad). Nuclear proteins were extracted from LLC-PK1 cells as described previously (33). 6 μg of nuclear extract was preincubated for 30 min in the presence of 32P end-labeled double-stranded DNA, 4-6 μg of poly(dI-dC), 140 mM KCl, 9% glycerol, 18 mM Tris, pH 7.3, and 1 mM EDTA at 4°C. Complexes were separated on 5-6% polyacrylamide gel with 89 mM Tris borate, 89 mM boric acid, 2 mM EDTA buffer (TBE) at 0.2 × concentration. The electrophoresis was carried out at 10 V/cm for 3-5 h in 0.2 × TBE buffer at 4°C. RNA from LLC-PK1 cells was separated by electrophoresis in 1.0% formaldehyde/agarose gels and then transferred to GeneScreen Plus membranes (DuPont NEN). Membranes were prehybridized for 2 h at 42°C in the presence of 1% SDS, 1 M NaCl, 10% dextran sulfate, and 50% deionized formamide. Hybridization was performed under similar conditions for 24 h in the presence of a human WT1 cDNA labeled with [α-32P]ATP by priming with random hexamers followed by extension of these primers with the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase(30). After hybridization, membranes were washed twice for 30 min each in 0.3 M NaCl, 0.03 M sodium citrate at 23°C, then in the same buffer with 1% SDS at 65°C, followed by 15 mM NaCl, 1.5 mM sodium citrate at 65°C. The membranes were dried and autoradiographed with Kodak XAR film at −80°C for 6-96 h with or without Cronex Lightning Plus intensifying screens. Quantification of hybridization signals was performed by densitometry of the autoradiograms with an LKB ultroscan XL enhanced laser densitometer. LLC-PK1 cells were washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline (without calcium or magnesium) and then lysed by addition of 1.0 ml of lysis buffer A. Scraped lysates were solubilized by boiling in sample buffer (1% SDS, 30 mM Tris, pH 6.8, 12% glycerol) and loaded onto a 10% acrylamide gel with 150 μg of protein loaded per lane. Following SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, proteins were transferred onto Immobilon membrane (Millipore), and the membrane was then stained with Coomassie Blue to ensure that all lanes contained equivalent amounts of transferred protein. The destained membrane was then blocked in blotting buffer (5% nonfat dry milk in 20 mM Tris, pH 7.4, with 0.15 M NaCl and 1% Triton X-100), incubated with either preimmune or immune rabbit IgG anti-EGR-1 Wi 21 (alpha 1) (which detects the non-zinc finger region of the EGR-1 protein corresponding to residues 29-117) or rabbit polyclonal α6F or murine monoclonal H7 antibody (which detects the 173-residue amino-terminal non-zinc finger region of the WT1 protein) diluted 1/1000 in blotting buffer and washed. In other experiments cell lysates were initially reacted with these antisera followed by precipitation with protein A prior to electrophoresis as described previously(8.Drummond I.A. Rupprecht H.D. Rohwer-Nutter P. Lopez-Guisa J.M. Madden S.L. Rauscher III, F.J. Sukhatme V.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3800-3809Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). EGR-1 and WT1-bound proteins were reacted with an enhanced chemiluminescent detection system as described by the manufacturer (Amersham Corp.) followed by autoradiography. LLC-PK1 cells plated on glass coverslips were fixed for immunofluorescent staining on Days 1-7. Cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 1 h, permeabilized in Triton X-100 for 4 min, and then incubated in PBS containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin for 5 min to reduce nonspecific background staining. The cells were incubated for 2 h in anti-EGR-1 Wi 21 (alpha 1), anti-WT1 α6F or H7, preimmune rabbit IgG, or non-immune murine ascites at 1:50 or 1:100 dilutions, washed three times in 0.1% bovine serum albumin in PBS, and then incubated for 1 h with goat anti-rabbit or anti-murine IgG conjugated to fluorescein isothiocyanate (Kirkegaard and Perry). Cells were washed three times in PBS, then mounted in 100 mM Tris-HCl:glycerol, 50:50, 2% n-propyl gallate, pH 8, and viewed on an Olympus BHS photomicroscope equipped for epifluorescence. For mobility shift and immunoblotting studies the dried gels or membranes were autoradiographed with Kodak XAR film at −80°C for 0.5-96 h with Cronex Lightning Plus intensifying screens (DuPont). Quantification of signals was performed by densitometry of the autoradiograms with an LKB Ultroscan XL enhanced laser densitometer (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). During culture, LLC-PK1 cells differentiate from a rounded cell type to a fully polarized epithelium. Prior to their polarization and tight junction formation, these cells undergo several rounds of cell division coincident with the maximal EGR-1 expression and activation of the Gαi−2 gene(31). To determine whether the WT1 gene also participates in these events a full-length human WT1 cDNA and a polyclonal (α6F) or monoclonal (H7) antibody to the 173-residue amino-terminal non-zinc finger region of the WT1 protein were used to detect its expression in LLC-PK1 cells. As seen in Fig. 1C, immunofluorescence of dividing non-confluent non-polarized cells with this antibody revealed a bright nuclear staining pattern in virtually every cell for EGR-1 whereas WT1 was not detected. By contrast, in fully polarized confluent cells this staining pattern was reversed. Quantification of EGR-1 and WT1 proteins in cells at Days 1-7 after plating by immunoblotting revealed a reciprocal pattern of expression for each protein in these cells. EGR-1 was barely detectable immediately after plating whereas WT1 was well expressed. However, by 36-48 h, when the cells were actively dividing, EGR-1 protein was maximally expressed whereas WT1 was not detectable. On later culture days 5-7, following the full polarization of these cells, EGR-1 expression fell whereas WT1 protein and mRNA expression increased (Fig. 1, A and B). In day 7 cultures there was sporadic lifting of some quiescent cell monolayers (data not shown). Ingrowth of cells occurred in the margins of denuded areas of the culture plates with a corresponding re-expression of EGR-1 protein. The pattern of maximal expression of the EGR-1 protein coincides with the temporal maximal activation of the Gαi−2 gene during growth, whereas its repression coincided with the maximal expression of the WT1 protein during cell quiescence(31). In other cell types the overexpression of the Gαi−2 subunit can activate signaling pathways that contribute to accelerated cell growth. Likewise overexpression of Gαi−2 or EGR-1 also accelerates LLC-PK1 cell growth. As WT1 expression corresponded to culture times when LLC-PK1 cells were both differentiated and growth arrested, we questioned whether expression of WT1 in predifferentiated LLC-PK1 cells would antagonize the effects of EGR-1 on cell growth during this period. LLC-PK1 cells were transiently transfected with Bluescript or plasmids encoding cDNAs for Gαi−2 (pRSV Gαi−2) or WT1 (pRSV WT1), driven by a viral Rous sarcoma promoter-enhancer to overexpress each protein. As seen in Fig. 2, by day 3 of culture predifferentiated cells transfected with plasmids encoding Gαi−2 had growth rates that were 1.8 times faster than cells transfected with Bluescript, whereas LLC-PK1 cells transfected with WT1 had growth rates that were 35% lower than Bluescript-transfected cells. Transfection efficiency in all these experiments was comparable at approximately 10-20% efficiency. Despite the initial altered growth rates of Gαi−2 and WT1-transfected cells, they still developed a normal polarized phenotype upon achieving confluence. These data suggested that both Gαi−2 and WT1 participate in signaling pathways that normally contribute to renal cell growth. We previously documented in rapidly dividing non-polarized cells a 135-bp enhancer area in the −200 to −335 region of the Gαi−2 gene. This region contains a binding site (5′-CGCCCCCGC-3′) for the EGR-1 transcription factor that provides a genomic signaling pathway for mitogenesis(33). To assess whether WT1 was repressing cell growth by repressing maximal transcriptional activation of the Gαi−2 gene, cells were co-transfected with the pRSV WT1 plasmid, and plasmids encoding firefly luciferase reporter genes fused to 5′-flanking areas of the Gαi−2 gene with (M14) or without the EGR-1 site (mutated M14 and M4). As seen in Fig. 3, a 60% repression of Gαi−2 transcription was only found in renal cells following their transfection with the M14 plasmid that contained both an intact EGR-1 binding site and also overexpressed a functional WT1 protein. These data suggested that the WT1 protein was contributing to the temporal transcriptional repression of the Gαi−2 gene in LLC-PK1 cells during culture. To determine whether the WT1 protein was directly contributing to the activation of the Gαi−2 gene, a double-stranded 23-bp DNA segment derived from the 5′-flanking sequence of the gene, which also contained the EGR-1 consensus sequence (5′-ATCCGCC CGCCCCCGCCGTCGGG-3′), was synthesized and 32P end-labeled for direct binding studies in mobility shift assays. Nuclear extracts from LLC-PK1 cells that were either actively dividing and non-polarized (culture day 1) or LLC-PK1 cells that were relatively quiescent and fully polarized (culture day 7) were examined. As seen in Fig. 4, the binding patterns of nuclear extracts from culture day 1 were different from those on culture day 7. Nuclear extracts from day 7 cells consistently demonstrated an additional faster mobility complex. We previously identified the EGR-1 protein as a predominant component of nuclear binding proteins in day 1 dividing cells but not day 7 quiescent cells (33). Based on our immunocytochemical studies it would be anticipated that the WT1 protein should be present in nuclear extracts of quiescent fully polarized LLC-PK1 cells on culture day 7. To determine whether WT1 was one of the proteins interacting with the 23-bp probe, nuclear extracts from culture days 1 and 7 were preincubated with H7 antibody. Following electrophoresis, retarded mobility of only the additional complex in nuclear extracts from culture day 7 was found. The specificity of this interaction was demonstrated by competition with the 28-kDa protein expressing the amino-terminal 173 residues of the WT1 protein. These data demonstrate that the WT1 protein was one component of these nuclear complexes. Detectability of the WT1 protein was consistent with its pattern of maximal expression in quiescent polarized LLC-PK1 cells that also have a corresponding repression of the Gαi−2 gene. These findings suggest the existence of differentiation-induced pathways in LLC-PK1 cells that alternatively abrogrates EGR-1 and promotes WT1 gene expression, thereby modulating a target protooncogene Gαi−2 that is participatory for growth and differentiation in these renal cells. These studies emphasize the usefulness of the LLC-PK1 renal cell as a model to elucidate normal programs of genetic differentiation in which WT1 participates. Further examination these pathways may provide significant insights into the molecular events involved in renal hypertrophy, nephrogenesis, and oncogenesis.

https://openalex.org/W2024839639,"Parathyroid hormone-related peptide (PTHRP) is a 141-amino acid protein identified in various carcinomas associated with humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy (HHM). Although the causal role of PTHRP in HHM syndrome has been established, the molecular and cellular mechanism by which PTHRP gene is overexpressed in certain malignancies remains unknown. We have demonstrated in the present study that PTHRP secretion was markedly induced concomitantly with the formation of transformed foci after normal rat embryo fibroblasts (REFs) were co-transfected with an activated ras (ras) and a mutated form of p53 (p53-mt) genes. In either ras- or p53-mt-transfected (nontransformed) cells, only modest or barely detectable secretion of PTHRP was observed, respectively. Northern blot analysis revealed that PTHRP mRNA was markedly induced in fully transformed cells 11 days after transfection with both ras and p53-mt genes. Inhibition of RNA synthesis with actinomycin D resulted in almost complete disappearance of PTHRP mRNA at 2-3 h, suggesting a transcriptional mechanism. Transient transfection experiments revealed that PTHRP promoter activity was induced in ras + p53-mt transfectants. REFs transformed by ras and p53-mt genes and thereby induced to secrete PTHRP in vitro produced aggressively growing tumors associated with HHM syndrome when injected into nude mice. These results suggest that activation of PTHRP gene is closely related to malignant transformation of normal mammalian cells and that ras and p53 may be important regulators of PTHRP gene transcription.

PTHRP shows structural and functional similarities to parathyroid hormone, including a sequence homology at the amino-terminal parathyroid hormone-like domain(1.Broadus A.E. Mangin M. Ikeda K.

Thus PTHRP overproduced and secreted by certain carcinomas enters the circulation(4.Burtis W.J. Brady T.G. Orloff J.J. Ersbak J.B. Warrell Jr., R.R. Olson B.R. Wu T.L. Mitnick M.E. Broadus A.E.

The findings that circulating PTHRP levels are elevated in most patients with HHM (4.Burtis W.J. Brady T.G. Orloff J.J. Ersbak J.B. Warrell Jr., R.R. Olson B.R. Wu T.L. Mitnick M.E. Broadus A.E.

Accumulating evidence suggests that PTHRP gene is expressed at low levels in a number of normal tissues and plays diverse physiological roles mainly in an autocrine/paracrine fashion(7.de Papp A.E. Stewart A.F. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 1993; 4: 181-187Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). However, the exact molecular and cellular mechanism by which PTHRP gene is overexpressed in certain carcinomas remains unknown. Carcinogenesis is a complex, multistep process, and it has been established that oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes play the fundamental role as the genetic targets, the alteration of which defines each of the distinct steps in the multistep cellular transformation(8.Bishop J.M. Science. 1987; 235: 305-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (1307) Google Scholar, 9.Weinberg R.A. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 3713-3721PubMed Google Scholar). The complex process involving the conversion of normal cells to malignant phenotypes can be reconstructed in vitro using the transfection focus formation assay, which has been elaborated to test the oncogenic potentials of various tumor-related genes. Using this assay cytoplasmic oncogenes, represented by ras and src, and nuclear oncogenes, such as myc and mutated p53, have been shown to collaborate with each other to fully transform normal rodent cells by acting in a complementary way, culminating in tumor formation in vivo(10.Weinberg R.A. Science. 1985; 230: 770-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar, 11.Land H. Parada L.F. Weinberg R.A. Nature. 1983; 304: 596-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (1960) Google Scholar, 12.Parada L.F. Land H. Weinberg R.A. Wolf D. Rotter V. Nature. 1984; 312: 649-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar). In the present study we have demonstrated that PTHRP gene expression is markedly induced in close association with transformation of normal rat embryo fibroblasts (REFs) by co-transfection of an activated ras gene and a mutated p53 gene. Furthermore, the transformed cells produced aggressively growing tumors with hypercalcemia in vivo when inoculated into nude mice. The current reconstruction system of HHM syndrome, starting with normal mammalian cells through the malignant transformation in vitro and tumor formation in vivo, may provide an excellent model to dissect the molecular and cellular events leading to the overexpression of PTHRP gene in certain malignancies. pucEJ (13.Hinds P.W.

Land H. Weinberg R.A. Wolf D. Rotter V. Nature. 1984; 312: 649-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar). Rat embryo fibroblasts (REFs) were prepared from 14-day-old Wistar rat embryos (Tokyo Laboratory Animals Science Co. Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) as described previously(15.Pollack R. Risser R. Conlon S. Rifkin D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1974; 71: 4792-4796Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), and grown for 2 days in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM, Gibco) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 60 μg/ml kanamycin. Adherent cells were trypsinized and frozen in liquid nitrogen until use. For transfection experiments REFs were plated at 3-5 ×105/6-cm dish, and a total of 20 μg of plasmid DNA consisting of test plasmids or the control plasmid (pSV-SPORT 1, Life Technologies, Inc.) and neo gene plasmid (pcDneo) was transfected on the following day by the calcium phosphate method according to Chen and Okayama(16.Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4820) Google Scholar). After 14-18 h, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and cultured in fresh medium for an additional day. Then cells were trypsinized, replated into 10-cm dishes, and fed every 3-4 days thereafter. In order to monitor successful transfection, one-tenth of cells were plated into a 6-cm dish and cultured in the presence of 400 μg/ml Geneticin (Gibco). The number of foci, the diameter of which was 3 mm or larger, was scored after Giemsa staining 11 days after the transfection. At the indicated intervals, cells and the conditioned medium were harvested separately for RNA analysis and determination of PTHRP concentrations, respectively. Actinomycin D (Sigma) was dissolved in ethanol, and control cells received an equal volume of vehicle. Five-week-old male athymic mice were purchased from Clea Japan Inc. (Tokyo, Japan), maintained in sterilized cages, and fed standard rodent chow containing 1.25% calcium and 1.06% phosphate (CE-2, Clea Japan Inc.). Tumorigenicity and the inducibility of hypercalcemia in vivo were studied by inoculating 5-10 ×106cells subcutaneously into the right flank of nude mice. Tumor size was calculated by the following formula: tumor volume (ml) = a ×b2/2, where a is the length (cm) and b is the width (cm) of the tumor. Blood was drawn every week by retroorbital plexus puncture for determination of blood ionized calcium (Ca2+). Blood Ca2+concentrations were measured by the electrode method using an autoanalyzer (M-634, Chiba Corning Diagnostics Co. Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). At sacrifice blood was drawn by cardiac puncture for determination of plasma PTHRP concentrations. The animals were treated in accordance with Chugai Pharmaceutical's ethical guidelines of animal care, handling, and termination, and the current experimental protocols were approved by the animal care committee of the institution. PTHRP concentrations were determined with a sensitive two-site IRMA for human PTHRP-(1-87) as described(17.Ikeda K. Ohno H. Hane M. Yokoi H. Okada M. Honma T. Yamada A. Tatsumi Y. Tanaka T. Saitoh T. Hirose S. Mori S. Takeuchi Y. Fukumoto S. Terukina S. Iguchi H. Kiriyama T. Ogata E. Matsumoto T. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1994; 79: 1322-1327Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, conditioned medium or plasma (200 μl) was first incubated with 100 μl of affinity-purified anti-PTHRP-(50-83) polyclonal antibody and a polystylene bead coupled to anti-PTHRP-(1-34) monoclonal antibody for 18 h. After washing with water, the bead was incubated with 125I-labeled anti-rabbit IgG goat antibody for additional 18 h, and radioactivity associated with the bead was counted after washing with water. The intraassay and interassay variations were 3.4-5.8% and 4.0-7.5%, respectively, and the detection limit, as determined by 2 standard deviations above the mean counts of nonspecific binding, was 0.5 pmol/liter(17.Ikeda K. Ohno H. Hane M. Yokoi H. Okada M. Honma T. Yamada A. Tatsumi Y. Tanaka T. Saitoh T. Hirose S. Mori S. Takeuchi Y. Fukumoto S. Terukina S. Iguchi H. Kiriyama T. Ogata E. Matsumoto T. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1994; 79: 1322-1327Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were dissolved and tumors were homogenized in guanidinium thiocyanate solution, and total cellular RNA was prepared by pelleting through cesium chloride cushion and quantitated by A250. Northern blot analysis was performed under stringent conditions as described previously(18.Ikeda K. Okazaki R. Inoue D. Ogata E. Matsumoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1174-1179Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), using a 308-base pair PvuII-SacI cDNA probe for PTHRP (19.Mangin M. Ikeda K. Dreyer B.E. Milstone L. Broadus A.E. Mol. Endocrinol. 1988; 2: 1049-1055Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) (courtesy of Drs. A. E. Broadus and M. Mangin, Yale University, New Haven, CT) and a 2.1-kb BamHI cDNA probe for human β-actin(20.Gunning P. Ponte P. Okayama H. Engel J. Blau H. Kedes L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1983; 3: 787-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (958) Google Scholar). The probes were labeled with deoxycytidine 5′-[α-32P]triphosphate (3000 Ci/mmol, Amersham Corp.) by the random primer technique (Multiprimer labeling kit, Amersham), and used after passage through Sephadex G-50 quick spin column (Boehringer Mannheim). The blots were washed in 0.1 ×SSC and 0.1% SDS at 65°C for 1 h, and the washed membranes were exposed to Kodak X-Omat film at −80°C with intensifying screens. REFs were transfected with test plasmids or the control DNA and cultured in the presence of Geneticin (500 μg/ml) for 11 days. Eighteen hours after replating, cells were co-transfected with 15 μg of a PTHRP-CAT construct containing a BamHI-BalI fragment (−638 to +105 base pairs relative to the transcription start site) of the human PTHRP gene containing the downstream TATA element (21.Mangin M. Ikeda K. Dreyer B.E. Broadus A.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 2408-2412Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar) (courtesy of Drs. A. E. Broadus and M. Mangin, Yale University, New Haven, CT) and 5 μg of RSV-β-galactosidase plasmid by the standard calcium phosphate method according to the manufacturer's instructions (5 Prime →3 Prime, Inc., Boulder, CO). After 48 hours of culture, cell extracts were assayed for protein concentration, β-galactosidase activity, and CAT activity as described previously(22.Gorman C.M. Maffat L.F. Howard B.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1982; 2: 1044-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (5294) Google Scholar). The induction of β-galactosidase activity did not differ by more than 33% among transfections. Data were expressed as mean ± S.E., and statistical significance was determined by analysis of variance. In order to examine the relationship between malignant transformation and PTHRP overproduction, we first attempted to establish an in vitro system in which normal mammalian cells could be converted to transformed cells through introduction of known oncogenes. Normal rat embryo fibroblasts (REFs) have been used in the transfection focus formation assay to test oncogenic potentials of various tumor-related genes and shown to require at least two different types of oncogenes for full transformation(11.Land H. Parada L.F. Weinberg R.A. Nature. 1983; 304: 596-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (1960) Google Scholar, 12.Parada L.F. Land H. Weinberg R.A. Wolf D. Rotter V. Nature. 1984; 312: 649-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1, no foci of morphologically altered cells were seen in the control plasmid- or p53-mt-transfected cultures, and only small number of foci were seen 11 days after transfection of ras oncogene alone (4 foci/10-cm dish). In contrast, co-transfection with ras and p53-mt induced the appearance of large numbers of overgrowing foci of cells with transformed morphology 11 days after transfection (80 foci/10-cm dish). These results are in good agreement with the previous observations that an activated ras gene and a mutated p53 gene cooperate with each other in cellular transformation(12.Parada L.F. Land H. Weinberg R.A. Wolf D. Rotter V. Nature. 1984; 312: 649-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar). We next examined the expression of PTHRP gene in the transfection-focus formation system. The conditioned medium was harvested during the last 3 days, and PTHRP concentrations were determined by a sensitive and specific IRMA for human PTHRP-(1-87) (17.Ikeda K. Ohno H. Hane M. Yokoi H. Okada M. Honma T. Yamada A. Tatsumi Y. Tanaka T. Saitoh T. Hirose S. Mori S. Takeuchi Y. Fukumoto S. Terukina S. Iguchi H. Kiriyama T. Ogata E. Matsumoto T. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1994; 79: 1322-1327Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) since no immunoassay specific to rat PTHRP was available. Amino acid sequences of PTHRP are remarkably conserved among various species up to the residue 111(1.Broadus A.E. Mangin M. Ikeda K. Insogna K.L. Weir E.C. Burtis W.J. Stewart A.F. N. Engl. J. Med. 1988; 319: 556-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar), and it has been reported that IRMA for human PTHRP-(1-74) is capable of detecting circulating PTHRP derived from a rat tumor associated with hypercalcemia(23.Gaich G. Burtis W.J. Endocrinology. 1990; 127: 1444-1449Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2, cells transfected with the control vector or p53-mt alone secreted barely detectable amounts of PTHRP, and cells transfected with ras oncogene secreted larger amounts of PTHRP, although not statistically significant. In contrast, fully transformed cells after co-transfection with ras and p53-mt genes secreted markedly elevated amounts of PTHRP per the same number of cells (Fig. 2). Dilution of the medium conditioned by ras + p53-mt transformants revealed a response curve parallel to that of human PTHRP-(1-87) standard in the IRMA, and immunoreactive PTHRP was barely detectable in plasma from non-tumor-bearing nude rats or mice (data not shown). These results suggest that the IRMA used in the current study cross-reacted with rat PTHRP, although we cannot rule out the possibility that our assay underestimated the concentrations of rat peptide. The time course of the induction of PTHRP secretion after transfection of the oncogenes is shown in Fig. 3. Cells co-transfected with ras and p53-mt genes secreted gradually increasing but modest amounts of PTHRP until day 8 and were markedly induced to secrete large amounts of PTHRP between 8 and 11 days after transfection. Again, cells transfected with ras alone secreted much smaller amounts of PTHRP during the same period (Fig. 3). In good agreement with the results of PTHRP secretion, the expression of PTHRP mRNA was markedly induced in fully transformed cells transfected with both ras and p53-mt, and only a faint band corresponding to rat PTHRP transcript was visible in cells transfected with ras alone (Fig. 4A). PTHRP mRNA was not readily detectable in control or p53-mt-transfected cells.Figure 4:Concomitant induction of PTHRP mRNA with malignant transformation after transfection with EJ-ras and p53-mt genes. A, REFs were transfected with pSV-SPORT 1 (Control), p53 mutant (p53-mt), EJ-ras alone (ras), or both EJ-ras and p53-mt genes (ras + p53-mt) together with pcDneo plasmid, and total cellular RNA was prepared 11 days after transfection. Northern blot analysis was performed using PTHRP and β-actin cDNA probes as described under “Materials and Methods.” RNA prepared from a human carcinoma associated with humoral hypercalcemia (38.Endo K.

Similar results were confirmed in three separate experiments. B, REFs were co-transfected with EJ-ras (12 μg) and p53-mt (3 μg), and 11 days after transfection cells were trypsinized, split into eight 10-cm dishes, and then cultured in the absence (Control) or presence of actinomycin D (AcD, 10 μg/ml). Total cellular RNA was prepared at the indicated times after RNA synthesis was inhibited with actinomycin D, and Northern blot analysis was performed using PTHRP and β-actin cDNA probes as described under “Materials and Methods.” Control cells received an equal volume of vehicle (ethanol).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Malignant cells are known to produce a variety of cytokines, such as hematopoietic colony-stimulating factors, interleukin 1, and interleukin 6, and it has been reported that transfection of an activated ras oncogene into normal human fibroblasts induces these cytokine genes mainly through a post-transcriptional mechanism (24.Demetri G.D. Ernst T.J. Pratt II, E.S. Zenzie B.W. Rheinwald J.G. Griffin J.D. J. Clin. Invest. 1990; 86: 1261-1269Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The PTHRP gene has certain characteristics of an early response gene, including the presence in PTHRP mRNAs of the AUUUA instability motifs at the 3′-untranslated regions(25.Shaw G. Kamen R. Cell. 1986; 46: 659-667Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3121) Google Scholar). In fact it has been demonstrated that PTHRP mRNA turns over rapidly in vitro(26.Ikeda K. Lu C. Weir E.C. Mangin M. Broadus A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5398-5402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and in vivo(27.Thiede M.A. Rodan G.A. Science. 1988; 242: 278-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar) with the reported half-life ranging from 30 min to 2 h. In order to determine whether the induction of PTHRP mRNA in ras + p53-mt transfectants occurred at a transcriptional or post-transcriptional level, the disappearance rate of PTHRP mRNA was assessed after replating the fully transformed cells. As shown in Fig. 4B, PTHRP mRNA level was markedly decreased at 2 h and disappeared at 3 h after the addition of actinomycin D, an inhibitor of RNA synthesis, suggesting that the expression of PTHRP gene was induced mainly at a transcriptional level. Furthermore, when transient transfection experiments were performed using a PTHRP-CAT reporter construct, CAT activity was markedly induced only in fully transformed cells with both ras and p53-mt genes (Fig. 5). These results not only confirm the transcriptional mechanism of PTHRP gene induction but suggest that some trans-acting cellular factor is induced in close association with malignant transformation by ras and p53-mt. The PTHRP promoter fragment used in the current transfection experiments contains binding sites for various transcription factors, including Sp 1, Ets, and AP-2(28.Mangin M. Ikeda K. Dreyer B.E. Broadus A.E. Mol. Endocrinol. 1990; 4: 851-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 29.Dittmer J. Gitlin S.D. Reid R.L. Brady J.N. J.

Chem. 1994; 269: 21428-21434Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Identification of a trans-acting factor as well as a DNA element responsible for PTHRP gene activation in ras + p53-mt-transformed cells will help gain further insight into the molecular mechanism underlying PTHRP overproduction in certain malignancies. We finally examined whether cells fully transformed by ras and p53-mt genes and thereby induced to produce large amounts of PTHRP in vitro were indeed capable of forming tumors and causing HHM syndrome in vivo. Nude mice were inoculated with ras + p53-mt transfectants and monitored for subsequent appearance of subcutaneous tumors and blood Ca2+concentrations. As shown in Fig. 6(left panel), animals inoculated with ras-transfected cells did not produce tumors or develop hypercalcemia, whereas those with the same number (1 ×107) of cells co-transfected with ras and p53-mt genes produced aggressively growing tumors and developed hypercalcemia. The ability of ras + p53-mt transfectants to induce tumors associated with marked hypercalcemia in vivo was further confirmed in three out of four nude mice inoculated with 5 ×106cells in a separate experiment (Fig. 6, right panel). The fourth animal showed marginal hypercalcemia. As shown in Fig. 7A, peak values of blood Ca2+were significantly higher in nude mice inoculated with ras + p53-mt transfectants than those in age-matched control animals, and the hypercalcemic nude mice displayed markedly elevated plasma PTHRP concentrations as compared with controls (0.6 ± 0.02 pM) (Fig. 7B). Plasma PTHRP concentrations in these hypercalcemic animals were comparable with those in patients with HHM determined with the current IRMA(17.Ikeda K. Ohno H. Hane M. Yokoi H. Okada M. Honma T. Yamada A. Tatsumi Y. Tanaka T. Saitoh T. Hirose S. Mori S. Takeuchi Y. Fukumoto S. Terukina S. Iguchi H. Kiriyama T. Ogata E. Matsumoto T. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1994; 79: 1322-1327Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Evidently the tumors associated with hypercalcemia expressed high levels of a single transcript for rat PTHRP mRNA (Fig. 7C).Figure 7:PTHRP expression in nude mice inoculated with ras + p53-mt transfectants. Blood Ca2+(A) and plasma PTHRP concentrations (B) in nude mice inoculated with ras + p53-mt transfectants (n = 3) and age-matched control animals (n = 10) were determined as described under “Materials and Methods.” Data are shown as mean ± S.E., and asterisks indicate significant difference from the control group (p < 0.001).

A family of ras genes encode highly homologous proteins with molecular mass of 21 kDa, which play pivotal roles in the transduction of extracellular signals to the nucleus(31.Barbacid M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 779-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (3772) Google Scholar). It has been shown in a human keratinocyte model that a progressive dysregulation of PTHRP gene expression occurs during the conversion from established phenotypes conferred by human papilloma virus 16 to malignant transformation induced by ras oncogene(32.Henderson J. Sebag M. Rhim J. Goltzman D. Kremer R. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 6521-6528PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, Li and Drucker (33.Li X. Drucker D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6263-6266Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have recently reported that transfection of either EJ-Ha-ras or v-src oncogene into established cell lines, NRK 49F (fibroblasts) and RCB 2.2 (osteoblast-enriched cell line), induced PTHRP mRNA expression at a transcriptional level, although it remained to be proven whether the increased production of PTHRP after transfection with either EJ-ras or v-src alone was sufficient to cause HHM syndrome in vivo. We have observed in the current study that the transfection of EJ-ras alone into REFs resulted in a modest increase in PTHRP secretion, although not statistically significant (Figure 2:, Figure 3:), and a slight induction of PTHRP mRNA on Northern analysis (Fig. 4). Taken together, it is conceivable that the activation of intracellular signal transduction pathways by ras oncogene seems to be important for PTHRP gene expression. Although ras mutations have been detected in a variety of human cancers, notably adenocarcinoma of the pancreas, the colon, and the lung and thyroid tumors(34.Bos J.L. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 4682-4689PubMed Google Scholar), most of these tumors are not frequently associated with HHM syndrome except for pancreas cancer (1.Broadus A.E. Mangin M. Ikeda K. Insogna K.L. Weir E.C. Burtis W.J. Stewart A.F. N. Engl. J. Med. 1988; 319: 556-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar, 2.Martin T.J. Moseley J.M. Gillespie M.T. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol.

Med. 1990; 41: 35-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), raising the possibility that ras mutations are not sufficient for full induction of PTHRP gene expression. In our experimental system malignant transformation by both ras and p53-mt, but not by transfection of ras alone, was associated with a marked induction of PTHRP gene transcription in vitro and the reconstitution of HHM syndrome in vivo. Taken together, it is tempting to hypothesize that the development of HHM requires another genetic alteration, such as a mutation of p53 gene in the current system or the introduction of human papilloma virus 16 DNA in the keratinocyte model (32.Henderson J.

It remains to be elucidated, however, what alteration in cellular functions the second mutation confers upon transformed cells. Our preliminary analysis showed that ras + p53-mt transfectants contained a modestly increased amount (1.5-2-fold) of ras mRNA compared with cells transfected with ras alone (data not shown), which may suggest that the effect of a mutated p53 gene is mediated, at least in part, through the up-regulation of ras gene expression. The p53 tumor-suppressor gene encodes a 53-kDa nuclear phosphoprotein involved in the control of cell proliferation(35.Levine A.J. Momand J. Finlay C.A.

Cell. 1992; 70: 523-526Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1897) Google Scholar), and its mutations have been detected in approximately half of almost all types of human cancers, as diverse as colon and breast carcinomas, lymphomas and leukemias, lung and esophageal carcinomas, and hepatocellular carcinoma(37.Harris C.C. Hollstein M. N. Engl. J. Med. 1993; 329: 1318-1327Crossref PubMed Scopus (1361) Google Scholar). Although the biochemical activities of wild-type p53 and its mutated forms are not entirely clear, there is accumulating evidence suggesting that p53 binds DNA specifically and affects the expression of various genes and that these functions of p53 are interfered with by its mutations(35.Levine A.J. Momand J. Finlay C.A. Nature. 1991; 351: 453-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (3653) Google Scholar, 36.Vogelstein B. Kinzler K.W. Cell. 1992; 70: 523-526Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1897) Google Scholar). The current system may be useful to examine the possible role for p53 mutation in the activation of PTHRP gene during the process of cellular transformation. Also, the association of HHM syndrome with the occurrence of p53 and ras mutations in human tumors remains to be elucidated. In conclusion, the results of the present study suggest that the overproduction of PTHRP and development of HHM syndrome occur during the multistep transformation of normal mammalian cells to malignant phenotypes and that ras and p53 may be important upstream regulators of PTHRP gene transcription. Since our experimental system can reproduce HHM syndrome in a relatively short period of time (11 days in vitro and 4-5 weeks in vivo), it should provide an excellent model to further dissect the molecular and cellular events involved in the overexpression of PTHRP gene in certain malignancies.
