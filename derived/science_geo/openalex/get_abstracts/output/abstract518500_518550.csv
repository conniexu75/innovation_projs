https://openalex.org/W2107776943,"In the context of the sixth wave of extinction, reliable surveys of biodiversity are increasingly needed to infer the cause and consequences of species and community declines, identify early warning indicators of tipping points, and provide reliable impact assessments before engaging in activities with potential environmental hazards. DNA metabarcoding has emerged as having potential to provide speedy assessment of community structure from environmental samples. Here we tested the reliability of metabarcoding by comparing morphological and molecular inventories of invertebrate communities associated with seagrasses through estimates of alpha and beta diversity, as well as the identification of the most abundant taxa. Sediment samples were collected from six Zostera marina seagrass meadows across Brittany, France. Metabarcoding surveys were performed using both mitochondrial (Cytochrome Oxidase I) and nuclear (small subunit 18S ribosomal RNA) markers, and compared to morphological inventories compiled by a long-term benthic monitoring network. A sampling strategy was defined to enhance performance and accuracy of results by preventing the dominance of larger animals, boosting statistical support through replicates, and using two genes to compensate for taxonomic biases. Molecular barcodes proved powerful by revealing a remarkable level of diversity that vastly exceeded the morphological survey, while both surveys identified congruent differentiation of the meadows. However, despite the addition of individual barcodes of common species into taxonomic reference databases, the retrieval of only 36% of these species suggest that the remaining were either not present in the molecular samples or not detected by the molecular screening. This finding exemplifies the necessity of comprehensive and well-curated taxonomic reference libraries and multi-gene surveys. Overall, results offer methodological guidelines and support for metabarcoding as a powerful and repeatable method of characterizing communities, while also presenting suggestions for improvement, including implementation of pilot studies prior to performing full “blind” metabarcoding assessments to optimize sampling and amplification protocols."
https://openalex.org/W2131592616,"We examine the joint contribution of urban expansion and climate change on heat stress over the Sydney region. A Regional Climate Model was used to downscale present (1990–2009) and future (2040–2059) simulations from a Global Climate Model. The effects of urban surfaces on local temperature and vapor pressure were included. The role of urban expansion in modulating the climate change signal at local scales was investigated using a human heat-stress index combining temperature and vapor pressure. Urban expansion and climate change leads to increased risk of heat-stress conditions in the Sydney region, with substantially more frequent adverse conditions in urban areas. Impacts are particularly obvious in extreme values; daytime heat-stress impacts are more noticeable in the higher percentiles than in the mean values and the impact at night is more obvious in the lower percentiles than in the mean. Urban expansion enhances heat-stress increases due to climate change at night, but partly compensates its effects during the day. These differences are due to a stronger contribution from vapor pressure deficit during the day and from temperature increases during the night induced by urban surfaces. Our results highlight the inappropriateness of assessing human comfort determined using temperature changes alone and point to the likelihood that impacts of climate change assessed using models that lack urban surfaces probably underestimate future changes in terms of human comfort."

This study aimed to describe and evaluate weak areas in knowledge, attitudes and practices with regards to brucellosis among urban and peri-urban small-scale dairy farmers in a low income country to generate information essential for control programmes and public health interventions. The cross-sectional study was conducted during six weeks in 2011. The study subjects were small-scale dairy farmers living in the urban and peri-urban area of the capital Dushanbe in Tajikistan. In total, 441 farmers were interviewed using a questionnaire with questions about demographic characteristics, knowledge, attitudes and practices relating to brucellosis. Descriptive statistics were used and a logistic regression model applied to evaluate potential predictors to knowledge about brucellosis. The majority (85%) of the farmers had never heard of brucellosis. Low educational level was found to be associated with low awareness of brucellosis (P = < 0.001). Respondents who talked about animal health issues with family members or friends were less likely to have heard of brucellosis compared to those who often talked to veterinarians (P = 0.03). Sixty three per cent of the participants wanted more information about brucellosis. Seventeen per cent sold unpasteurized dairy products on a regular basis direct to consumers. Almost 30% of the households consumed unpasteurized dairy products on regular basis. A majority of the respondents did not use any protection when handling cows having an abortion or when dealing with aborted materials. Poor knowledge, high-risk behaviours and a willingness to learn more strengthens the logic for including health education as part of control programmes."
https://openalex.org/W1998290348,"Intervertebral disc (IVD) degeneration and pathological spinal changes are major causes of back pain, which is the top cause of global disability. Obese and diabetic individuals are at increased risk for back pain and musculoskeletal complications. Modern diets contain high levels of advanced glycation end products (AGEs), cyto-toxic components which are known contributors to obesity, diabetes and accelerated aging pathologies. There is little information about potential effects of AGE rich diet on spinal pathology, which may be a contributing cause for back pain which is common in obese and diabetic individuals. This study investigated the role of specific AGE precursors (e.g. methylglyoxal-derivatives (MG)) on IVD and vertebral pathologies in aging C57BL6 mice that were fed isocaloric diets with standard (dMG+) or reduced amounts of MG derivatives (dMG-; containing 60-70% less dMG). dMG+ mice exhibited a pre-diabetic phenotype, as they were insulin resistant but not hyperglycemic. Vertebrae of dMG+ mice displayed increased cortical-thickness and cortical-area, greater MG-AGE accumulation and ectopic calcification in vertebral endplates. IVD morphology of dMG+ mice exhibited ectopic calcification, hypertrophic differentiation and glycosaminoglycan loss relative to dMG- mice. Overall, chronic exposure to dietary AGEs promoted age-accelerated IVD degeneration and vertebral alterations involving ectopic calcification which occurred in parallel with insulin resistance, and which were prevented with dMG- diet. This study described a new mouse model for diet-induced spinal degeneration, and results were in support of the hypothesis that chronic AGE ingestion could be a factor contributing to a pre-diabetic state, ectopic calcifications in spinal tissues, and musculoskeletal complications that are more generally known to occur with chronic diabetic conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2110552089,"To assess drug induced driving impairment, initial screening is needed. However, no consensus has been reached about which initial screening tools have to be used. The present study aims to determine the ability of a battery of psychometric tests to detect performance impairing effects of clinically relevant levels of drowsiness as induced by one night of sleep deprivation.Twenty four healthy volunteers participated in a 2-period crossover study in which the highway driving test was conducted twice: once after normal sleep and once after one night of sleep deprivation. The psychometric tests were conducted on 4 occasions: once after normal sleep (at 11 am) and three times during a single night of sleep deprivation (at 1 am, 5 am, and 11 am).On-the-road driving performance was significantly impaired after sleep deprivation, as measured by an increase in Standard Deviation of Lateral Position (SDLP) of 3.1 cm compared to performance after a normal night of sleep. At 5 am, performance in most psychometric tests showed significant impairment. As expected, largest effect sizes were found on performance in the Psychomotor Vigilance Test (PVT). Large effects sizes were also found in the Divided Attention Test (DAT), the Attention Network Test (ANT), and the test for Useful Field of View (UFOV) at 5 and 11 am during sleep deprivation. Effects of sleep deprivation on SDLP correlated significantly with performance changes in the PVT and the DAT, but not with performance changes in the UFOV.From the psychometric tests used in this study, the PVT and DAT seem most promising for initial evaluation of drug impairment based on sensitivity and correlations with driving impairment. Further studies are needed to assess the sensitivity and validity of these psychometric tests after benchmark sedative drug use."
https://openalex.org/W2095145021,"2-Cys peroxiredoxins belonging to the Prx1 subfamily are Cys-based peroxidases that control the intracellular levels of H2O2 and seem to assume a chaperone function under oxidative stress conditions. The regulation of their peroxidase activity as well as the observed functional switch from peroxidase to chaperone involves changes in their quaternary structure. Multiple factors can modulate the oligomeric transitions of 2-Cys peroxiredoxins such as redox state, post-translational modifications, and pH. However, the molecular basis for the pH influence on the oligomeric state of these enzymes is still elusive. Herein, we solved the crystal structure of a typical 2-Cys peroxiredoxin from Leishmania in the dimeric (pH 8.5) and decameric (pH 4.4) forms, showing that conformational changes in the catalytic loop are associated with the pH-induced decamerization. Mutagenesis and biophysical studies revealed that a highly conserved histidine (His113) functions as a pH sensor that, at acidic conditions, becomes protonated and forms an electrostatic pair with Asp76 from the catalytic loop, triggering the decamerization. In these 2-Cys peroxiredoxins, decamer formation is important for the catalytic efficiency and has been associated with an enhanced sensitivity to oxidative inactivation by overoxidation of the peroxidatic cysteine. In eukaryotic cells, exposure to high levels of H2O2 can trigger intracellular pH variations, suggesting that pH changes might act cooperatively with H2O2 and other oligomerization-modulator factors to regulate the structure and function of typical 2-Cys peroxiredoxins in response to oxidative stress. 2-Cys peroxiredoxins belonging to the Prx1 subfamily are Cys-based peroxidases that control the intracellular levels of H2O2 and seem to assume a chaperone function under oxidative stress conditions.

https://openalex.org/W1995045917,"Reactive oxygen species play an important role in the pathogenesis of diabetic retinopathy. We studied the role of adrenergic and serotonin receptors in the generation of superoxide by retina and 661W retinal cells in high glucose and of the α1-adrenergic receptor (AR) on vascular lesions of the retinopathy in experimentally diabetic C57Bl/6J mice (and controls) after 2 and 8 months. Compared with 5 mM glucose, incubating cells or retinal explants in 30 mM glucose induced superoxide generation. This response was reduced or ablated by pharmacologic inhibition of the α1-AR (a Gq-coupled receptor) or Gs-coupled serotonin (5-HT2, 5-HT4, 5-HT6, and 5-HT7) receptors or by activation of the Gi-coupled α2-AR. In elevated glucose, the α1-AR produced superoxide via phospholipase C, inositol triphosphate-induced Ca2+ release, and NADPH oxidase, and pharmacologic inhibition of these reactions prevented the superoxide increase. Generation of retinal superoxide, expression of proinflammatory proteins, and degeneration of retinal capillaries in diabetes all were significantly inhibited with daily doxazosin or apocynin (inhibitors of α1-AR and NADPH oxidase, respectively), but increased vascular permeability was not significantly affected. Adrenergic receptors, and perhaps other GPCRs, represent novel targets for inhibiting the development of important features of diabetic retinopathy.—Du, Y., Cramer, M., Lee, C.

https://openalex.org/W2012094853,"Reactive oxygen species (ROS) primarily produced via NADPH oxidase play an important role for killing microorganisms in neutrophils. In this study we examined if ROS production in Human promyelocytic leukemia cells (HL60) differentiated into neutrophil-like cells (dHL60) induces ER stress and activates the unfolded protein response (UPR). To cause ROS production cells were treated with PMA or by chronic hyperglycemia. Chronic hyperglycemia failed to induce ROS production and did not cause activation of the UPR in dHL60 cells. PMA, a pharmacologic NADPH oxidase activator, induced ER stress in dHL60 cells as monitored by IRE-1 and PERK pathway activation, and this was independent of calcium signaling. The NADPH oxidase inhibitor, DPI, abolished both ROS production and UPR activation. These results show that ROS produced by NADPH oxidase induces ER stress and suggests a close association between the redox state of the cell and the activation of the UPR in neutrophil-like HL60 cells."
https://openalex.org/W2060831484,"P1 (antigen I/II) is a sucrose-independent adhesin of Streptococcus mutans whose functional architecture on the cell surface is not fully understood. S. mutans cells subjected to mechanical extraction were significantly diminished in adherence to immobilized salivary agglutinin but remained immunoreactive and were readily aggregated by fluid-phase salivary agglutinin. Bacterial adherence was restored by incubation of postextracted cells with P1 fragments that contain each of the two known adhesive domains. In contrast to untreated cells, glutaraldehyde-treated bacteria gained reactivity with anti-C-terminal monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), whereas epitopes recognized by mAbs against other portions of the molecule were masked. Surface plasmon resonance experiments demonstrated the ability of apical and C-terminal fragments of P1 to interact. Binding of several different anti-P1 mAbs to unfixed cells triggered release of a C-terminal fragment from the bacterial surface, suggesting a novel mechanism of action of certain adherence-inhibiting antibodies. We also used atomic force microscopy-based single molecule force spectroscopy with tips bearing various mAbs to elucidate the spatial organization and orientation of P1 on living bacteria. The similar rupture lengths detected using mAbs against the head and C-terminal regions, which are widely separated in the tertiary structure, suggest a higher order architecture in which these domains are in close proximity on the cell surface. Taken together, our results suggest a supramolecular organization in which additional P1 polypeptides, including the C-terminal segment originally identified as antigen II, associate with covalently attached P1 to form the functional adhesive layer.

https://openalex.org/W2108978853,"The controversy over the existence or the need for G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) in plant G-protein signalling has overshadowed a more fundamental quest for the role of AtGCR1, the most studied and often considered the best candidate for GPCR in plants. Our whole transcriptome microarray analysis of the GCR1-knock-out mutant (gcr1-5) in Arabidopsis thaliana revealed 350 differentially expressed genes spanning all chromosomes. Many of them were hitherto unknown in the context of GCR1 or G-protein signalling, such as in phosphate starvation, storage compound and fatty acid biosynthesis, cell fate, etc. We also found some GCR1-responsive genes/processes that are reported to be regulated by heterotrimeric G-proteins, such as biotic and abiotic stress, hormone response and secondary metabolism. Thus, GCR1 could have G-protein-mediated as well as independent roles and regardless of whether it works as a GPCR, further analysis of the organism-wide role of GCR1 has a significance of its own."
https://openalex.org/W2074416707,"Ubiquitination by the E3 ligase Nedd4 and deubiquitination by the deubiquitinases USP20 and USP33 have been shown to regulate the lysosomal trafficking and recycling of agonist-activated β2 adrenergic receptors (β2ARs). In this work, we demonstrate that, in cells subjected to physiological stress by nutrient starvation, agonist-activated ubiquitinated β2ARs traffic to autophagosomes to colocalize with the autophagy marker protein LC3-II. Furthermore, this trafficking is synchronized by dynamic posttranslational modifications of USP20 that, in turn, are induced in a β2AR-dependent manner. Upon β2AR activation, a specific isoform of the second messenger cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKAα) rapidly phosphorylates USP20 on serine 333 located in its unique insertion domain. This phosphorylation of USP20 correlates with a characteristic SDS-PAGE mobility shift of the protein, blocks its deubiquitinase activity, promotes its dissociation from the activated β2AR complex, and facilitates trafficking of the ubiquitinated β2AR to autophagosomes, which fuse with lysosomes to form autolysosomes where receptors are degraded. Dephosphorylation of USP20 has reciprocal effects and blocks trafficking of the β2AR to autophagosomes while promoting plasma membrane recycling of internalized β2ARs. Our findings reveal a dynamic regulation of USP20 by site-specific phosphorylation as well as the interdependence of signal transduction and trafficking pathways in balancing adrenergic stimulation and maintaining cellular homeostasis.

https://openalex.org/W2082351949,"To evaluate the association between various components of body composition and overall survival of patients treated with targeted therapies for advanced renal cell carcinoma.This retrospective study included 124 Chinese patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma who had been treated with targeted therapy from 2008 to 2012 at Fudan University Cancer Center. The L3 plane from a computed tomography scan was analyzed. Area and density were recorded as quantitative and quality measures. Univariate and multivariate Cox proportion hazard regression models were constructed to calculate the crude and adjusted hazard ratio (HR) of various components of body composition for overall survival. X-tile software was used to search for optimal cutoffs for male and female patients and the concordance index evaluated incremental changes in prognostication.After adjusting for age, sex and Heng risk stratification, only visceral adipose tissue index (HR 0.981, p = 0.002) and subcutaneous adipose tissue index (HR 0.987, p = 0.048) were independently associated with overall survival. Visceral adipose tissue remained a significant prognostic factor (HR 0.997, p = 0.005) when the influence of body mass index was included. Using defined cutoffs, patients with low VAT had double the death rate (p = 0.007). Visceral adipose tissue also added significant benefit to Heng risk stratification. Further exploratory analysis revealed that visceral adipose tissue may be an indicator of nutritional status in patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma.Radiologic measurement of VAT is an independent prognostic factor for Asian patients treated with targeted therapy for advanced renal cell carcinoma."

Understanding EGFR regulatory mechanisms, and hence approaches for clinical intervention, has focused on ligand-receptor interactions and tyrosine kinase activity. Here, we show using the NCI-H460 lung and A431 epidermoid human cancer cell lines that EGFR binding to anterior gradient homolog 2 (AGR2) in the endoplasmic reticulum is required for receptor delivery to the plasma membrane and thus EGFR signaling. Reduced AGR2 protein levels or mutation of an essential cysteine in the active site result in decreased cell surface EGFR and a concomitant decrease in signaling as reflected by AREG, EGR1, and FOS expression. Similar to previously described EGFR nulls, an AGR2 null also resulted in embryonic lethality. Consistent with its role in regulating EGFR-mediated signaling, AGR2 expression is also enhanced in many human cancers and promotes the transformed phenotype. Furthermore, EGFR-mediated signaling in NCI-H460 cells, which are resistant to the tyrosine kinase inhibitor AG1478, is also disrupted with reduced AGR2 expression. The results provide insights into why cancer prognosis or response to therapy often does not correlate with EGFR protein or RNA levels because they do not reflect delivery to the cell surface where signaling is initiated.

https://openalex.org/W2010653992,"Vulnerability assessments have often invoked sustainable livelihoods theory to support the quantification of adaptive capacity based on the availability of capital—social, human, physical, natural, and financial. However, the assumption that increased availability of these capitals confers greater adaptive capacity remains largely untested. We quantified the relationship between commonly used capital indicators and an empirical index of adaptive capacity (ACI) in the context of vulnerability of Australian wheat production to climate variability and change. We calculated ACI by comparing actual yields from farm survey data to climate-driven expected yields estimated by a crop model for 12 regions in Australia’s wheat-sheep zone from 1991–2010. We then compiled data for 24 typical indicators used in vulnerability analyses, spanning the five capitals. We analyzed the ACI and used regression techniques to identify related capital indicators. Between regions, mean ACI was not significantly different but variance over time was. ACI was higher in dry years and lower in wet years suggesting that farm adaptive strategies are geared towards mitigating losses rather than capitalizing on opportunity. Only six of the 24 capital indicators were significantly related to adaptive capacity in a way predicted by theory. Another four indicators were significantly related to adaptive capacity but of the opposite sign, countering our theory-driven expectation. We conclude that the deductive, theory-based use of capitals to define adaptive capacity and vulnerability should be more circumspect. Assessments need to be more evidence-based, first testing the relevance and influence of capital metrics on adaptive capacity for the specific system of interest. This will more effectively direct policy and targeting of investment to mitigate agro-climatic vulnerability."
https://openalex.org/W2138265519,"The primary approach used to conserve tropical biodiversity is in the establishment of protected areas. However, many tropical nature reserves are performing poorly and interventions in the broader landscape may be essential for conserving biodiversity both within reserves and at large. Between October 2010 and 2012, we conducted bird surveys in and around a recently established nature reserve in Xishuangbanna, China. We constructed a checklist of observed species, previously recorded species, and species inferred to have occurred in the area from their distributions and habitat requirements. In addition, we assessed variation in community composition and habitat specificity at a landscape-scale. Despite the fact that the landscape supports a large area of natural forest habitat (~50,000 ha), we estimate that >40% of the bird fauna has been extirpated and abundant evidence suggests hunting is the primary cause. A large proportion (52%) of the bigger birds (>20 cm) were extirpated and for large birds there was a U-shaped relationship between habitat breadth and extirpation probability. Habitat specificity was low and bird communities were dominated by widespread species of limited conservation concern. We question whether extending tropical protected area networks will deliver desired conservation gains, unless much greater effort is channeled into addressing the hunting problem both within existing protected areas and in the broader landscape."

Because Fbw7 promotes destabilization of many oncogenic proteins and cell differentiation regulators, it is important to identify unknown substrates of Fbw7 to aid understanding of hematopoietic cell differentiation and Fbw7-associated cancer development.

Recently, we reported that hematopoietic transcription factor GATA-binding protein 3 (GATA3) is a novel target for Fbw7 (23Kitagawa K. Shibata K. Matsumoto A. Matsumoto M. Ohhata T. Nakayama K.I. Niida H. Kitagawa M. Fbw7 targets GATA3 through CDK2-dependent proteolysis and contributes to regulation of T-cell development.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2014; 34: 2732-2744Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). GATA3 is a member of the GATA family of transcription factors, which consists of GATA1, -2, -3, -4, -5, and -6 (28Rodrigues N.P. Tipping A.J. Wang Z. Enver T. GATA-2 mediated regulation of normal hematopoietic stem/progenitor cell function, myelodysplasia and myeloid leukemia.Int. J. Biochem.

We found that conditional inactivation of Fbw7 in mouse T-cell development skewed thymic CD8 single positive lineage differentiation, which exhibited a higher incidence of apoptosis (23Kitagawa K. Shibata K. Matsumoto A. Matsumoto M. Ohhata T. Nakayama K.I. Niida H. Kitagawa M. Fbw7 targets GATA3 through CDK2-dependent proteolysis and contributes to regulation of T-cell development.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2014; 34: 2732-2744Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Similar perturbations during development of CD8-positive cells were studied with transgenic mice, in which GATA3 expression was enforced throughout T-cell development. Excess GATA3 induced thymic lymphomas in the transgenic mice (30Nawijn M.C. Ferreira R. Dingjan G.M. Kahre O. Drabek D. Karis A. Grosveld F. Hendriks R.W. Enforced expression of GATA-3 during T cell development inhibits maturation of CD8 single-positive cells and induces thymic lymphoma in transgenic mice.J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 715-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Interestingly, thymic lymphomas also developed in mice when Fbw7 was conditionally ablated in the T-cell lineage alone (31Onoyama I. Tsunematsu R. Matsumoto A. Kimura T. de Alborán I.M. Nakayama K. Nakayama K.I. Conditional inactivation of Fbxw7 impairs cell-cycle exit during T cell differentiation and results in lymphomatogenesis.J. Exp. Med. 2007; 204: 2875-2888Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). It is speculated that uncontrolled GATA3 protein levels result in the formation of lymphoblastoid tumors at a specific stage of thymic development. Fbw7 binds to a high affinity recognition motif termed the Cdc4 phosphodegron (CPD), with a consensus sequence of Ser(P)/Thr(P)-Pro-X-X-Ser(P)/Thr(P)/Glu/Asp and often promotes the turnover of substrates via phosphorylation of the CPD (18Kitagawa K. Hiramatsu Y. Uchida C. Isobe T. Hattori T. Oda T. Shibata K. Nakamura S. Kikuchi A. Kitagawa M. Fbw7 promotes ubiquitin-dependent degradation of c-Myb: involvement of GSK3-mediated phosphorylation of Thr-572 in mouse c-Myb.Oncogene. 2009; 28: 2393-2405Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 32Skaar J.R. Pagan J.K. Pagano M. Mechanisms and function of substrate recruitment by F-box proteins.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2013; 14: 369-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). We found a CPD motif in GATA3 amino acid (aa) sequences and demonstrated that Fbw7-mediated ubiquitylation required phosphorylation of Thr156 in CPD in GATA3 (23Kitagawa K. Shibata K. Matsumoto A. Matsumoto M. Ohhata T. Nakayama K.I. Niida H. Kitagawa M. Fbw7 targets GATA3 through CDK2-dependent proteolysis and contributes to regulation of T-cell development.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2014; 34: 2732-2744Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). We also found the CPD motif in GATA-binding protein 1 (GATA1) and GATA-binding protein 2 (GATA2), suggesting that they might be targets for Fbw7. Among the GATA family, GATA1, -2, and -3 are classified as hematopoietic GATA factors, based on their ability to regulate distinct and overlapping aspects of hematopoiesis. Especially, aa sequences among GATA3 and GATA2 are highly conserved. GATA3 is expressed in HSCs in addition to T-lymphocytes (33Ting C.N. Olson M.C. Barton K.P. Leiden J.M. Transcription factor GATA-3 is required for development of the T-cell lineage.Nature. 1996; 384: 474-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). GATA2 is also expressed in HSCs and in hematopoietic progenitors, erythroid precursors, megakaryocytes, and eosinophils (28Rodrigues N.P. Tipping A.J. Wang Z. Enver T. GATA-2 mediated regulation of normal hematopoietic stem/progenitor cell function, myelodysplasia and myeloid leukemia.Int. J. Biochem.

GATA2 participates in proliferation and differentiation of hematopoietic cell lineages. Although GATA1 is also expressed in erythroid precursors, megakaryocytes, and eosinophils (34Shimizu R. Yamamoto M. Contribution of GATA1 dysfunction to multi-step leukemogenesis.Cancer Sci. 2012; 103: 2039-2044Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), the identity of aa among GATA3 or GATA2 and GATA1 is high in zinc finger domains but low in other regions. It was reported that mutations of one allele of GATA2 participate in hematopoietic or immune system diseases (35Ishida H. Imai K. Honma K. Tamura S.. Imamura T. Ito M. Nonoyama S. GATA-2 anomaly and clinical phenotype of a sporadic case of lymphedema, dendritic cell, monocyte, B-and NK-cell (DCML) deficiency, and myelodysplasia.Eur. J.

GATA2 deficiency: a protean disorder of hematopoiesis, lymphatics, and immunity.Blood. 2014; 123: 809-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is important to clarify the molecular mechanisms involved in the control of GATA2 levels. Although cellular GATA2 levels are regulated by transcriptional control and proteasome-mediated degradation (37Minegishi N. Suzuki N. Kawatani Y. Shimizu R. Yamamoto M. Rapid turnover of GATA-2 via ubiquitin-proteasome protein degradation pathway.Genes Cells. 2005; 10: 693-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 38Koga S. Yamaguchi N. Abe T. Minegishi M. Tsuchiya S. Yamamoto M. Minegishi N. Cell-cycle-dependent oscillation of GATA2 expression in hematopoietic cells.Blood. 2007; 109: 4200-4208Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), ubiquitin E3 ligase, which ubiquitylates GATA2 to promote degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome system, has not been identified. In the present study, we demonstrated that GATA2 is a novel CPD-dependent substrate for Fbw7. Furthermore, we identified the involvement of cyclin B-cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1), which is different from the CPD kinases identified for known substrates. We also demonstrated the physiological functions of Fbw7-dependent control of GATA2 using cultured cells and Fbw7-conditional knock-out mice. HEK293 and HeLa cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% FBS, penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml) at 37 °C. Neuro2A cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 2 mm l-glutamine, 10 ml/liter nonessential amino acids, and the above described antibiotics. K562 cells were obtained from the RIKEN Cell Bank and cultured in RPMI1640 supplemented with 10% FBS and the above described antibiotics. To obtain cell lysates synchronized at G1/S, S, and M phases, HeLa cells were treated with 1 μg/ml aphidicolin for 16 h and then released from arrest by washing with fresh medium for 10 h (G1/S and S phase cells). Then cells were treated with aphidicolin for 16 h (G1/S phase cells), then released from arrest by washing with fresh medium for 5 h, and harvested by treating trypsin (S phase cells). M phase cells were treated with 1 μg/ml aphidicolin for 16 h, released from arrest by washing with fresh medium for 4 h, treated with 100 ng/ml nocodazole for 16 h, and harvested by adding trypsin. To determine the contribution of cyclin B-CDK1, cells were treated with a CDK inhibitor, such as butyrolactone I (39Kitagawa M. Okabe T. Ogino H. Matsumoto H. Suzuki-Takahashi I. Kokubo T. Higashi H.

PE-Cy5-conjugated anti-c-Kit (2B8) was purchased from Biolegend. Biotinylated anti-CD127 (B12-1), mouse lineage depletion mixture, and streptavidin particles Plus (streptavidin-conjugated magnetic nanoparticles) were purchased from BD Bioscience. Alexa Fluor® 488-conjugated anti-GATA2 was prepared by Alexa Fluor® 488 monoclonal antibody labeling kit (Zenon). Anti-human GATA2 phosphorylated Thr176 polyclonal antibody (anti-p-T176-GATA2) was raised against keyhole limpet hemocyanin-conjugated chemically synthesized phosphorylated Thr176 peptide, corresponding to the CPD region of GATA2 (aa residues 172–181) (MBL). Antiserum obtained from an immunized guinea pig was bound to column chromatography conjugated with P-T176 peptide. The affinity-purified anti-p-T176-GATA2 was then passed through a column conjugated to nonphosphorylated Thr176 peptide (aa residues 172–181 of GATA2) to deplete antibodies against nonphosphorylated antigen. The specific binding ability of the purified antibody to P-T176 peptide was confirmed by ELISA. Human GATA2 cDNA was cloned into pcDNA3.1/myc-His (Invitrogen). Substitution of Thr176 to alanine in GATA2 was generated using PCR-based mutagenesis. cDNAs encoding mouse Fbw7 (Fbxw7α) or its ΔF mutant were subcloned into p3×FLAG-CMV 7.1 (Sigma). cDNAs encoding human Fbw7 were cloned into pCGN with an HA tag or pcDNA3 with a FLAG tag. The expression plasmid for ubiquitin (pCGN-HA-Ub) was described previously (41Nakayama K. Nagahama H. Minamishima Y.A. Matsumoto M. Nakamichi I. Kitagawa K. Shirane M. Tsunematsu R. Tsukiyama T.

Plasmids were transfected into HEK293 or HeLa cells using the calcium phosphate method or X-treme GENE 9 (Roche Applied Science), respectively. Cells were harvested by a scraper and lysed with lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 300 mm NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, 10 μg/ml each of antipain, pepstatin, E-64, leupeptin, and trypsin inhibitor, 2.5 μg/ml chymostatin, phosphatase inhibitor mix) (23Kitagawa K.

Biol. 2014; 34: 2732-2744Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). siRNA oligonucleotides for GATA2 or Fbw7 or control siRNAs were transfected into HeLa cells using RNAiMax (Life Technologies), according to the manufacturer's protocol. ON-TARGETplus human SMARTpool for GATA2 (L-009024-00-0005) was purchased from Thermoscientific Dharmacon. The nucleotide sequences of Fbw7 siRNAs were 5′-GUGUGGAAUGCAGAGACUGGAGA-3′ (Fbw7-A), 5′-AAUGAAAGCACAUAGAGUGCCAACU-3′ (Fbw7-B), 5′-ACAGGACAGUGUUUACAAA-3′ (Fbw7-C), and 5′-ACCUUCUCUGGAGAGAGAAAUGC-3′ (Fbw7-D). Total cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with 2 μg of antibodies and protein G Plus-Sepharose 4FF (GE Healthcare) at 4 °C for 2 h. Immunocomplexes were washed four times with lysis buffer. Immunoprecipitated samples and original cell lysates (input) were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred from the gel onto a PVDF membrane (Millipore), followed by immunoblotting (IB). Proteins were visualized using an enhanced chemiluminescence system (Bio-Rad). Cells lysates which were prepared with lysis buffer as described above were added to equal volume of 2× denaturing IP buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2% SDS, 10 mm dithiothreitol) and incubated at 100 °C for 8 min and then centrifuged for 13,000 rpm for 10 min. The supernatants were diluted with five volumes of lysis buffer and immunoprecipitated with 2 μg of antibodies and protein G Plus-Sepharose 4FF (GE healthcare) at 4 °C for 2 h. Immunocomplexes were washed four times with lysis buffer. Immunoprecipitated samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred from the gel onto a PVDF membrane (Millipore), followed by IB. DiPIUS-NL analysis was performed as described (42Yumimoto K. Matsumoto M. Oyamada K. Moroishi T. Nakayama K.I. Comprehensive identification of substrates for F-box proteins by differential proteomics analysis.J. Proteome Res. 2012; 11: 3175-3185Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Briefly, Neuro2A cells expressing mouse Fbw7α or its ΔF mutant were incubated for 6 h in the presence of the proteasome inhibitor MG132 (10 μm; Peptide Institute) and were then lysed in 8 ml of a solution containing 20 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1% digitonin, 10 mm NaF, 10 mm Na4P2O7, 0.4 mm Na3VO4, 0.4 mm EDTA, leupeptin (20 μg/ml), aprotinin (10 μg/ml), and 1 mm PMSF. The lysates were centrifuged at 2200 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The supernatants (20 mg of protein in 8 ml of solution) were incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with 120 μl of beads conjugated with M2 antibodies to FLAG. The beads were washed three times with 4 ml of a solution containing 10 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Triton X-100, and bead-bound proteins were then eluted with the FLAG peptide (500 μg/ml; Sigma), precipitated with ice-cold 20% trichloroacetic acid, and washed with acetone. The concentrated immunoaffinity-purified proteins were dissolved in SDS sample buffer, fractionated by SDS-PAGE, and stained with silver. Individual lanes of the stained gel were sliced into 12 pieces, and proteins within these pieces were subjected to in-gel digestion with trypsin as described previously (43Matsumoto M. Hatakeyama S. Oyamada K. Oda Y. Nishimura T. Nakayama K.I. Large-scale analysis of the human ubiquitin-related proteome.Proteomics. 2005; 5: 4145-4151Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). The resulting peptides were analyzed by an ion trap mass spectrometer (LTQ-XL, Thermo Finnigan). Peak lists were generated with lcq_dta.exe (Thermo Finnigan) and were compared with the use of the MASCOT algorithm (version 2.2.1) with the “Target-decoy” Mouse IPI database (version 3.4.4, released in June 2008; with 55,078 target sequences, searched against a total of 110,156 sequences (target and reverse/decoy)), maintained by the European Bioinformatics Institute. Assigned high scoring peptide sequences (MASCOT score >35) were processed with in-house software. If the MASCOT score was <45 (peptides for which the MS2 score was above the 95th percentile of significance), assigned sequences were manually confirmed by comparison with the corresponding collision-induced dissociation spectra on the basis of the following criteria: (i) a Δ score of >15 or (ii) at least six successive matches for y- or b-ions or at least three blocks of three successive matches for y- or b-ions. Identified peptides from independent experiments were integrated and regrouped by IPI accession number. Proteins identified in only one experiment or with a single-peptide assignment were removed from spectral counting data. Estimated false discovery rates were zero at the protein level. pcDNA3.1-GATA2-myc-His or pcDNA3.1-GATA2-T176A-myc-His was transfected with or without pcDNA3-FLAG-Fbw7 into HeLa cells. To analyze the effect of Fbw7 on the stability of endogenous GATA2, siRNA for Fbw7 or control siRNA was transfected into K562 cells using RNAiMax. After 48 h, cells were treated with 20 μg/ml cycloheximide for the indicated times. Cell lysates were subjected to IB with the indicated antibodies. The intensity of the bands was measured using image analysis software ImageJ, and the signal intensity of GATA2 in samples was normalized using levels of β-actin as a loading control. GST-fused WT or T176A mutant of GATA2 was produced in Escherichia coli BL21 and purified using glutathione-Sepharose beads (GE Healthcare). In vitro phosphorylation was described previously (23Kitagawa K. Shibata K. Matsumoto A. Matsumoto M. Ohhata T. Nakayama K.I. Niida H. Kitagawa M.

We have shown previously that Clostridium difficile toxin B (ToxB), an inhibitor of RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42, induces apoptosis of cerebellar granule neurons (CGNs).

Rho family GTPases belong to the Ras superfamily of monomeric G-proteins and include the well described proteins Rac, Rho, and Cdc42. Although Rho GTPases are best recognized for their prominent roles in regulating actin cytoskeletal dynamics, more recent studies have demonstrated an important role for Rho GTPases in regulating neuronal survival (1.Linseman D.A. Loucks F.A. Diverse roles of Rho GTPases in neuronal development, survival, and death.Front. Biosci. 2008; 13: 657-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Indeed, apoptosis induced by inhibitors of 3-HMG-CoA reductase (statins) was correlated with loss of plasma membrane-associated Rho GTPase family members in rat cortical neurons (2.Tanaka T. Tatsuno I. Uchida D. Moroo I. Morio H. Nakamura S. Noguchi Y. Yasuda T. Kitagawa M. Saito Y. Hirai A. Geranylgeranyl-pyrophosphate, an isoprenoid of mevalonate cascade, is a critical compound for rat primary cultured cortical neurons to protect the cell death induced by 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase inhibition.J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 2852-2859Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and down-regulation of Rho family GTPases is closely associated with an increase in neuronal apoptosis (3.Desagher S. Severac D. Lipkin A. Bernis C. Ritchie W. Le Digarcher A. Journot L. Genes regulated in neurons undergoing transcription-dependent apoptosis belong to signaling pathways rather than the apoptotic machinery.J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 5693-5702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). More recently, Rac has been highlighted as a specific member of the Rho GTPase family critical for maintaining neuronal survival. For example, prior studies demonstrated that either dominant negative Rac expression or siRNA-mediated knockdown of the Rac GEF Alsin (ALS2) induces apoptosis of cultured motor neurons (4.Topp J.D. Gray N.W. Gerard R.D. Horazdovsky B.F. Alsin is a Rab5 and Rac1 guanine nucleotide exchange factor.J. Biol.

Alsin/Rac1 signaling controls survival and growth of spinal motoneurons.Ann. Neurol. 2006; 60: 105-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The critical involvement of Rac in neurodegeneration is further evidenced by studies demonstrating that loss-of-function mutations in ALS2 are causative in juvenile-onset amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (6.Yamanaka K. Vande Velde C. Eymard-Pierre E. Bertini E. Boespflug-Tanguy O. Cleveland D.W. Unstable mutants in the peripheral endosomal membrane component ALS2 cause early-onset motor disease.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 16041-16046Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Collectively, these data highlight Rac as a crucial modulator of neuronal survival and suggest that Rac dysregulation may underlie some forms of neurodegenerative disease. In previous studies, we examined the neurotoxic effects of the large cytotoxin Clostridium difficile toxin B (ToxB) 2The abbreviations used are: ToxBC. difficile toxin BCGNcerebellar granule neuronMAPmitogen-activated proteinPAKp21-activated kinaseGEFguanine nucleotide exchange factorCREBcAMP response-element binding protein. in CGNs. ToxB monoglucosylates a key threonine residue in the switch 1 region of Rho GTPases, preventing Rho, Rac, and Cdc42 from interacting with their downstream effectors (7.Just I. Selzer J. Wilm M. von Eichel-Streiber C. Mann M. Aktories K. Glucosylation of Rho proteins by Clostridium difficile toxin B.Nature. 1995; 375: 500-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (881) Google Scholar). Global inhibition of Rho GTPases with ToxB induces CGN apoptosis through dysregulation of critical prosurvival and proapoptotic signaling cascades (8.Loucks F.A. Le S.S. Zimmermann A.K. Ryan K.R. Barth H. Aktories K. Linseman D.A. Rho family GTPase inhibition reveals opposing effects of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase/extracellular signal-related kinase and Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription signaling cascades on neuronal survival.J.

Chem. 2012; 287: 16835-16848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Specifically, ToxB induces down-regulation of Rac1 GTPase as well as elements of a Rac-dependent mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase pathway, including the p21-activated kinase (PAK), MEK1/2, and ERK1/2 signaling cascade. Inhibition of this pathway in CGNs induces apoptosis in part through reduced degradation of the proapoptotic BH3-only protein Bim. In addition to repression of a prosurvival MEK1/2/ERK1/2 signaling cascade, we have reported previously that broad Rho GTPase inhibition with ToxB induces CGN death through activation of a JNK/c-Jun pathway that stimulates transcription of Bim (10.Le S.S. Loucks F.A. Udo H. Richardson-Burns S. Phelps R.A. Bouchard R.J. Barth H. Aktories K. Tyler K.L. Kandel E.R. Heidenreich K.A. Linseman D.A.

Therefore, ToxB globally suppresses Rho GTPase function and induces CGN apoptosis through dysregulation of specific MAP kinase signaling cascades, leading to enhanced expression and diminished degradation of the proapoptotic BH3-only protein Bim. C. difficile toxin B cerebellar granule neuron mitogen-activated protein p21-activated kinase guanine nucleotide exchange factor cAMP response-element binding protein. The focus of this study was to compare the effects of ToxB on neuronal survival to those of a more targeted inhibitor of Rac GTPase. Although ToxB has been shown to inhibit Rac, Rho, and Cdc42, NSC23766 suppresses a more discrete pool of Rho family GTPases through inhibition of the Rac-specific GEFs Tiam1 and Trio, two of the most prominent regulators of Rac in the brain (11.Schmidt A. Hall A. Guanine nucleotide exchange factors for Rho GTPases: turning on the switch.Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 1587-1609Crossref PubMed Scopus (978) Google Scholar). The application of this targeted Rac inhibitor allows for a refined understanding of the Rho family GTPase-regulated signaling pathways essential to neuronal survival. Contrary to our results with ToxB, we demonstrate that targeted inhibition of Rac with NSC23766 does not turn off prosurvival MEK1/2/ERK1/2 signaling in CGNs, nor does it activate the JNK/c-Jun cascade. Instead, NSC23766 induces apoptosis via repression of the distinct MAP kinase pathway MEK5/ERK5. Further establishing these findings, adenoviral expression of constitutively active MEK5 significantly protects CGNs from NSC23766-mediated Rac inhibition but is unable to protect CGNs from ToxB-mediated global Rho GTPase inhibition. We report that loss of MEK5/ERK5 signaling in NSC23766-treated CGNs results in deactivation of the downstream effectors p90Rsk and Akt, leading to induction, dephosphorylation, and mitochondrial localization of the BH3-only, proapoptotic protein Bad. These findings are novel in that they are the first to distinguish the precise MAP kinase signaling pathways that regulate neuronal apoptosis in response to selective inhibition of Rac versus global suppression of Rho family GTPases. NSC23766, JNK inhibitor II (SP600125), and the caspase inhibitors BOC, LEHD, and QVD (non-O-methylated) were obtained from Calbiochem. ZVAD was purchased from Enzo Lifesciences (Farmingdale, NY).

The rabbit monoclonal antibody for Bad (N-term) was purchased from Millipore (Billerica, MA). Horseradish peroxidase-linked secondary antibodies and reagents for enhanced chemiluminescence detection were from Amersham Biosciences. CGNs were isolated from 7-day-old Sprague-Dawley rat pups of both sexes (15–19 g) as described previously (12.Linseman D.A. Laessig T. Meintzer M.K. McClure M. Barth H. Aktories K. Heidenreich K.A.

Briefly, neurons were plated on 35-mm-diameter plastic dishes coated with poly-l-lysine at a density of ∼2.0 × 106 cells/ml in basal modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 25 mm KCl, 2 mm l-glutamine, and penicillin (100 units/ml)/streptomycin (100 μg/ml) (Life Technologies). 24 h after plating the CGNs, cytosine arabinoside (10 μm) was added to the culture medium to limit the growth of non-neuronal cells. In general, experiments were performed after 6–7 days in culture. Following treatment as described under “Results,” cell lysates were prepared for Western blotting as described previously (8.Loucks F.A. Le S.S. Zimmermann A.K. Ryan K.R. Barth H. Aktories K.

Rho family GTPase inhibition reveals opposing effects of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase/extracellular signal-related kinase and Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription signaling cascades on neuronal survival.J. Neurochem. 2006; 97: 957-967Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The protein concentration of the samples was determined using a protein assay kit (BCA, Thermo Scientific), and SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed using equal amounts of protein followed by transfer to PVDF membranes (Amersham Biosciences). The entire PVDF membranes, when processed, were blocked in PBS (pH 7.4) containing 0.1% Tween 20 (PBS-T) and 1% BSA for 1 h at room temperature (25 °C). Subsequently, membranes were incubated for 1 h with primary antibodies diluted in blocking solution. Excess primary antibody was removed by washing the membranes with PBS-T five times over 25 min. The corresponding horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies diluted in PBS-T were incubated with the membranes for 1 h following the washes. Excess secondary antibody was removed by washing with PBS-T five times over 25 min. Immunoreactive proteins were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence. Quantitative changes in the phosphorylation or expression levels of individual proteins were assessed by densitometry of Western blots. When appropriate, expression levels of assessed proteins were normalized to a loading control. In general, phosphospecific bands were normalized to the total expression level for a given protein. All quantitative data are on the basis of an analysis of blots obtained from at least three independent experiments. The protein expression level or phosphorylation level of the control cell lysates was set at 100%, and all other values are reported relative to the control value. Statistical differences in phosphorylation or protein expression between control cell lysates and lysates from cells treated with the Rac inhibitor were analyzed by paired Student's t test. All statistical analyses were performed by comparing raw densitometric values. After treatment, CGNs were washed once with PBS (1 ml/well) and then fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (1 ml/well) for 1 h at room temperature (25 °C). Cells were washed once with PBS (1 ml/well) and then permeabilized and blocked in 0.2% Triton X-100 and 5% BSA in PBS (pH 7.4). Primary antibodies were diluted in 2% BSA and 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS. Cells were incubated in the primary antibody for 1 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C depending on the antibody. After incubation, cells were washed five times in PBS (5 min per wash) and then incubated for 1 h at 25 °C with Cy3- or FITC-conjugated secondary antibodies and DAPI-diluted in 2% BSA and 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS. Following the second incubation, neurons were washed an additional five times with PBS (5 min per wash) before the addition of anti-quench (0.1% p-phenylenediamine in 75% glycerol) in PBS. Fluorescent images were captured by using a ×63 oil immersion objective on a Zeiss Axioplan 2 microscope equipped with a Cooke Sensicam deep-cooled charge-coupled device camera and a Slidebook software analysis program for digital deconvolution (Intelligent Imaging Innovations, Inc., Denver, CO). Following treatment, Hoechst dye (8 μg/ml final concentration) was added directly to each well and incubated at 25 °C for 30 min to stain CGN nuclei. Cells were then washed with PBS (1 ml/well) and fixed by incubation in 4% paraformaldehyde (in PBS) for 30 min at 25 °C. Cells were subsequently washed twice with PBS (1 ml/well). To quantify apoptosis, CGNs displaying condensed chromatin or nuclear fragmentation were scored as apoptotic. Approximately 300 neurons were counted in a minimum of three ×63 fields of a 35-mm dish, and final counts represent data collected from a minimum of three independent experiments performed in duplicate. Adenoviral constitutively active MEK5 was purchased from Cell BioLabs (San Diego, CA), and adenoviral GFP was a gift from Marja T. Nevalainen (Thomas Jefferson University) and was prepared as described previously (13.Ahonen T.J. Xie J. LeBaron M.J. Zhu J. Nurmi M. Alanen K. Rui H. Nevalainen M.T. Inhibition of transcription factor STAT5 induces cell death of human prostate cancer cells.J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 27287-27292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). CGNs were infected on day 5 in vitro with adenovirus with a multiplicity of infection of 35 carrying GFP or constitutively active MEK5. 48 h post-infection, some cells were treated with 175 μm NSC23766 for an additional 48 h. 72 h post-infection, another group of cells was treated with 60 ng/ml ToxB for an additional 24 h. 96 h post-infection, cells were fixed for fluorescent imaging and quantification of apoptosis as described above. In general, qualitative Western blotting observations were made on the basis of three independent experiments. Graphical data represent the mean ± S.E. for the number of independent experiments performed (n). Statistical differences between the means of unpaired sets of data were assessed by one-way analysis of variance and further analyzed using a post hoc Tukey's test. p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. The targeted Rac inhibitor NSC23766 selectively and reversibly hinders GDP/GTP exchange carried out by the Rac-specific GEFs Tiam1 and Trio. Specifically, this cell-permeable pyrimidine compound targets a tryptophan within the GEF binding site, prohibiting Tiam1 and Trio from binding and activating Rac (14.Gao Y. Dickerson J.B. Guo F. Zheng J. Zheng Y. Rationale design and characterization of a Rac GTPase-specific small molecule inhibitor.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 7618-7623Crossref PubMed Scopus (916) Google Scholar). Consistent with this mechanism of inhibition, CGNs incubated for 48 h with NSC23766 (200 μm) exhibited significantly decreased immunoreactivity for active Rac (Rac-GTP) compared with control CGNs (Fig. 1). Consistent with the involvement of Rac in regulating actin assembly, inhibition of Rac for 48 h resulted in marked fragmentation of the actin cytoskeletal network (Fig. 2A). The maintenance of an intact microtubule network, visualized by β-tubulin and MAP2 immunoreactivity, confirmed that the relative lack of Rac-GTP staining observed in NSC23766-treated cells was not due to the global absence or disruption of cellular components (Fig. 2B, top row). Moreover, examination of nuclei by Hoechst staining revealed significantly increased apoptotic cell death in NSC23766-treated CGNs compared with untreated controls, as evidenced by nuclear fragmentation and/or condensation (Fig. 2, B, bottom row, and C). Collectively, these data indicate that the targeted inhibition of a select pool of Rac GTPase activated by Tiam1 and Trio is sufficient to induce CGN apoptosis.FIGURE 2NSC23766 disrupts the actin cytoskeleton and induces apoptosis. A, cells were incubated for 48 h in either control medium alone (Con) or medium containing NSC23766 (NSC, 200 μm). Cells were fixed, nuclei were stained with DAPI, and the actin cytoskeletal was visualized with an antibody against actin. Scale bar = 10 μm. B, cells were incubated for 48 h in either control medium alone or medium containing NSC23766 (200 μm). Cells were fixed, and their nuclei were stained with DAPI. The microtubule network was visualized using a monoclonal antibody for β-tubulin conjugated with Cy3 Alexa Fluor 555 and a mouse monoclonal MAP2 antibody followed by a FITC-conjugated secondary antibody. Although the microtubule network remains largely intact, CGNs display condensed or fragmented nuclei characteristic of apoptosis following treatment with NSC23766.

Jänicke R.U. Emerging roles of caspase-3 in apoptosis.Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 99-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (2857) Google Scholar). In agreement with this mechanism of cell death, CGNs treated with NSC23766 displayed increased immunoreactivity for active (cleaved) caspase-3 (Fig. 3A) and demonstrated enhanced activation of caspases that were blocked by inclusion of pan-caspase inhibitors in a caspase-3/7 activation assay (data not shown). To definitively establish the involvement of caspase-3 activation in NSC23766-mediated CGN death, we next examined the potential protective effects of caspase inhibitors. CGN viability assessed by nuclear staining was notably reduced in NSC23766-treated cells compared with untreated controls. However, inclusion of the pan-caspase inhibitors BOC, QVD, or ZVAD had no apparent protective effects against this Rac inhibitor (Fig. 3B). In marked contrast, incubation with either BOC or LEHD (a caspase-9 inhibitor) alone significantly protected CGNs treated with the global Rho GTPase inhibitor ToxB (Fig. 3C). These data suggest that CGN death induced by targeted inhibition of Rac GTPase occurs via a mechanism that involves a dispensable activation of caspase-3. We have reported previously that broad Rho GTPase inhibition with ToxB deactivates a prosurvival MAP kinase signaling cascade involving PAK1/2/3, MEK1/2, and ERK1/2. Therefore, we examined whether this signaling cascade was similarly suppressed in NSC23766-treated CGNs. Although decreased levels of pPAK1/2/3 were detected in CGNs incubated with NSC23766 for 48 h (Fig. 4, A and D), specific Rac inhibition did not result in significantly decreased phosphorylation of MEK1/2 or ERK1/2 (Fig. 4, B, C, and E). These data suggest that targeted inhibition of a select pool of Rac activated by Tiam1 and Trio in CGNs induces cell death through a mechanism that is distinct from global inhibition of Rho GTPases with ToxB. The above results suggest the possibility that the more targeted Rac inhibitor may work through suppressing MEK5 and ERK5, components of an alternative MAP kinase signaling cascade, to repress prosurvival signaling downstream of Rac and PAK. Indeed, an immunoblot analysis indicated that NSC23766 treatment caused significantly decreased phosphorylation of both MEK5 and ERK5 in CGNs (Fig. 5, A–C). MEK5 is also cleaved in response to NSC23766 treatment in CGNs, resulting in reduced levels of total MEK5 (Fig. 5A). Conversely, ToxB treatment had little to no effect on the phosphorylation of either MEK5 or ERK5 in CGNs (Fig. 5, A–C). These data indicate that the targeted inhibition of Rac GTPase may elicit cell death via deactivation of an alternative prosurvival MAP kinase pathway downstream of PAK and MEK5/ERK5 compared with ToxB-treated CGNs. A recent study has demonstrated that neuronal cell death induced by deletion of ERK5 is correlated with a marked decrease in phosphorylation of p90Rsk and Akt (16.Finegan K.G. Wang X. Lee E.J. Robinson A.C. Tournier C. Regulation of neuronal survival by the extracellular signal-related protein kinase 5.Cell Death Differ. 2009; 16: 674-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). To determine whether the loss of ERK5 phosphorylation induced by selective inhibition of Rac has a similar effect in CGNs, we examined the phosphorylation of p90Rsk and Akt in NSC23766-treated CGNs. Consistent with this previous study, we report distinct decreases in phosphorylated p90Rsk and Akt in NSC23766-treated CGNs compared with controls (Figs. 6, A, B, and E). One of the shared prosurvival functions of p90Rsk and Akt is to suppress the expression of Bad via repression of Bad transcription by the cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) (16.Finegan K.G.

We report that treatment with the targeted Rac inhibitor NSC23766 resulted in up-regulation of proapoptotic Bad, an effect that was not observed with ToxB (Fig. 6C).

But given the unavailability of ATP or a proton gradient across the OM, it is unknown what energy source(s) drives this process. Here we used a combination of computational and experimental approaches to quantitatively compare proposed AT OM translocation mechanisms. We show directly for the first time that when translocation was blocked an AT passenger remained unfolded in the periplasm. We demonstrate that AT secretion is a kinetically controlled, non-equilibrium process coupled to folding of the passenger and propose a model connecting passenger conformation to secretion kinetics. These results reconcile seemingly contradictory reports regarding the importance of passenger folding as a driving force for OM translocation but also reveal that another energy source is required to initiate translocation.

https://openalex.org/W2037747486,"CEP55 was initially described as a centrosome- and midbody-associated protein and a key mediator of cytokinesis. More recently, it has been implicated in PI3K/AKT pathway activation via an interaction with the catalytic subunit of PI3K. However, its role in embryonic development is unknown. Here we describe a cep55 nonsense mutant zebrafish with which we can study the in vivo physiologic role of Cep55. Homozygous mutants underwent extensive apoptosis by 24 hours postfertilization (hpf) concomitant with cell cycle defects, and heterozygous carriers were indistinguishable from their wild-type siblings. A similar phenotype was also observed in zebrafish injected with a cep55 morpholino, suggesting the mutant is a cep55 loss-of-function model. Further analysis revealed that Akt was destabilized in the homozygous mutants, which partially phenocopied Akt1 and Akt2 knockdown. Expression of either constitutively activated PIK3CA or AKT1 could partially rescue the homozygous mutants. Consistent with a role for Cep55 in regulation of Akt stability, treatment with proteasome inhibitor, MG132, partially rescued the homozygous mutants. Taken together, these results provide the first description of Cep55 in development and underline the importance of Cep55 in the regulation of Pi3k/Akt pathway and in particular Akt stability.—Jeffery, J., Neyt, C., Moore, W., Paterson, S., Bower, N.

https://openalex.org/W2081192477,"Inflammation plays a key role in coronary artery disease (CAD) and other manifestations of atherosclerosis. Recently, urinary proteins were found to be useful markers for reflecting inflammation status of different organs. To identify potential biomarker for diagnosis of CAD, we performed one-dimensional SDS-gel electrophoresis followed by liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Among the proteins differentially expressed in urine samples, monocyte antigen CD14 was found to be consistently expressed in higher amounts in the CAD patients as compared to normal controls. Using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays to analyze the concentrations of CD14 in urine and serum, we confirmed that urinary CD14 levels were significantly higher in patients (n = 73) with multi-vessel and single vessel CAD than in normal control (n = 35) (P < 0.001). Logistic regression analysis further showed that urinary CD14 concentration level is associated with severity or number of diseased vessels and SYNTAX score after adjustment for potential confounders. Concomitantly, the proportion of CD14+ monocytes was significantly increased in CAD patients (59.7 ± 3.6%) as compared with healthy controls (14.9 ± 2.1%) (P < 0.001), implicating that a high level of urinary CD14 may be potentially involved in mechanism(s) leading to CAD pathogenesis. By performing shotgun proteomics, we further revealed that CD14-associated inflammatory response networks may play an essential role in CAD. In conclusion, the current study has demonstrated that release of CD14 in urine coupled with more CD14+ monocytes in CAD patients is significantly correlated with severity of CAD, pointing to the potential application of urinary CD14 as a novel noninvasive biomarker for large-scale diagnostic screening of susceptible CAD patients."

https://openalex.org/W2082927983,"Macrophage accumulation is one of the hallmarks of progressive kidney disease. Resting macrophages have a finite lifespan, but become resistant to apoptosis in response to pathogenic cues, whereas the underlying mechanism remains unknown. Tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA), a protease up-regulated in the kidneys with chronic injury, has been shown to promote macrophage accumulation and renal inflammation. We hypothesized that tPA may be the endogenous factor that promotes macrophage survival and extends their lifespan that leads to their accumulation in the injured kidneys. We examined the role of tPA in macrophage survival, and found that tPA protected macrophages from both staurosporine and H2O2-induced apoptosis. tPA promoted the survival of both resting and lipopolysaccharide- or interferon-γ-induced M1 macrophages, but failed to do so in the interleukin 4 (IL4)-induced M2 macrophages. In the kidneys with unilateral ureteral obstruction, there were significantly more apoptotic M1 macrophages in tPA-deficient mice than their wild-type counterparts, and obstruction-induced M1 macrophages accumulation and M1 chemokine expression were markedly reduced in these knock-out mice. The cytoprotective effect of tPA required its receptor, LDL receptor-related protein-1 (LRP-1). tPA induced the phosphorylation of Erk1/2, p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK), and p38 in a temporal order. The tPA-mediated macrophage survival was eliminated by PD98059, BI-D1870, or sc68376, the specific inhibitors for Erk1/2, p90RSK, or p38, respectively. Thus, it is clear that tPA promoted M1 macrophage survival through its receptor LRP-1-mediated novel signaling cascade involving Erk1/2, p90RSK, and p38, which leads to the accumulation of these cells in the injured kidneys."
https://openalex.org/W1972683089,"Dandy-Walker-like malformation (DWLM) is the result of aberrant brain development and mainly characterized by cerebellar hypoplasia. DWLM affected dogs display a non-progressive cerebellar ataxia. Several DWLM cases were recently observed in the Eurasier dog breed, which strongly suggested a monogenic autosomal recessive inheritance in this breed. We performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) with 9 cases and 11 controls and found the best association of DWLM with markers on chromosome 1. Subsequent homozygosity mapping confirmed that all 9 cases were homozygous for a shared haplotype in this region, which delineated a critical interval of 3.35 Mb. We sequenced the genome of an affected Eurasier and compared it with the Boxer reference genome and 47 control genomes of dogs from other breeds. This analysis revealed 4 private non-synonymous variants in the critical interval of the affected Eurasier. We genotyped these variants in additional dogs and found perfect association for only one of these variants, a single base deletion in the VLDLR gene encoding the very low density lipoprotein receptor. This variant, VLDLR:c.1713delC is predicted to cause a frameshift and premature stop codon (p.W572Gfs*10). Variants in the VLDLR gene have been shown to cause congenital cerebellar ataxia and mental retardation in human patients and Vldlr knockout mice also display an ataxia phenotype. Our combined genetic data together with the functional knowledge on the VLDLR gene from other species thus strongly suggest that VLDLR:c.1713delC is indeed causing DWLM in Eurasier dogs."
https://openalex.org/W2048625887,"Grooming is one of the most conspicuous social interactions among nonhuman primates. The selection of grooming partners can provide important clues about factors relevant for the distribution of grooming within a social group. We analyzed grooming behavior among 17 semi-free ranging female Barbary macaques (Macaca sylvanus). We tested whether grooming is related to kinship, rank and friendship. Furthermore, we tested whether grooming is reciprocated or exchanged for rank related benefits (i.e. lower aggression and increased tolerance whilst feeding). We found that in general grooming was reciprocally exchanged, directed up the hierarchy and at the same time affected by friendship and kinship. Grooming was more frequent among individuals with higher friendship values as well as amongst related individuals. We also divided our data set on the basis of rank difference and tested if different power asymmetries between individuals affected the tendency to exchange grooming for rank related benefits and grooming reciprocation. In support of our initial hypothesis our results show that the reciprocation of grooming was a significant predictor of grooming interactions between individuals of similar rank, but not between those individuals more distantly separated in the social hierarchy. However, we did not find any evidence for grooming being exchanged for rank related benefits in either data set. Our results, together with previously published studies, illustrate the behavioral flexibility of macaques. It is clear that multiple studies of the same species are necessary to gather the data required for the solid comparative studies needed to shed light on patterns of grooming behavior in primates."

CaMKII showed increased expression and phosphorylation during metamorphosis. 20E elevated CaMKII phosphorylation. However, the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) and ryanodine receptor inhibitor suramin, the phospholipase C inhibitor U73122, and the inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate receptor inhibitor xestospongin C suppressed 20E-induced CaMKII phosphorylation. Two ecdysone-responsible GPCRs and Gαq protein were involved in 20E-induced CaMKII phosphorylation by RNA interference analysis. 20E regulated CaMKII threonine phosphorylation at amino acid 290, thereby inducing CaMKII nuclear translocation. CaMKII knockdown by dsCaMKII injection into the larvae prevented the occurrence of larval-pupal transition and suppressed 20E response gene expression.

Previously reported recessive mutations within ILDR1 have been shown to cause severe to profound nonsyndromic sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL), DFNB42. Whole-exome sequencing of a Korean multiplex family segregating partial deafness identified a novel homozygous ILDR1 variant (p.P69H) within the Ig-like domain. To address the pathogenicity of p.P69H, the angulin-2/ILDR1 p.P69H variant protein, along with the previously reported pathogenic ILDR1 mutations, was expressed in angulin-1/LSR knockdown epithelial cells. Interestingly, partial mislocalization of the p.P69H variant protein and tricellulin at TCs was observed, in contrast to a severe mislocalization and complete failure of tricellulin recruitment of the other reported ILDR1 mutations. Additionally, three-dimensional protein modeling revealed that angulin-2/ILDR1 contributed to tTJ by forming a homo-trimer structure through its Ig-like domain, and the p.P69H variant was predicted to disturb homo-trimer formation. In this study, we propose a possible role of angulin-2/ILDR1 in tTJ formation in the inner ear and a wider audiologic phenotypic spectrum of DFNB42 caused by mutations within ILDR1."

In some experiments, Alexa Fluor 555-conjugated wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) or fluorescently conjugated phalloidin (Molecular Probes) was used according to the manufacturer's protocol for labeling pre-fixed eukaryotic cells. Human breast cancer cell lines HCC1937, MDA-MB-231, and MCF-7 were obtained from Dr. Mary-Claire King (University of Washington). Cells cultured in 6-well format were washed twice with ice-cold PBS (2.67 mm potassium chloride, 1.47 mm monobasic potassium phosphate, 138 mm sodium chloride, and 8.1 mm dibasic sodium phosphate, pH 7.4). Ice-cold cell homogenization buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, and 250 mm sucrose) was supplemented with protease inhibitor mixture for mammalian tissues (Sigma). Lysates were centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 20 min, a small aliquot was removed for protein quantitation by BCA (Pierce), and samples were either placed in sample loading buffer containing SDS and 2% β-mercaptoethanol or immunoprecipitated with the appropriate antibody. Immunoprecipitations were performed by incubating 90 μl of cleared cell lysate with 1 μg of primary antibody and 250 μl of simple immunoprecipitation wash buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100, and 5% (v/v) glycerol) overnight at 4 °C with gentle agitation, after which 25 μl of a 50% slurry of protein A-Sepharose CL-4B (GE Healthcare) was added and further incubated for 1 h. Sepharose beads were then washed three times with 0.5 ml of ice-cold simple immunoprecipitation wash buffer. The final wash was removed, 20 μl of 1.5× SDS sample loading buffer (94 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 3.0% (w/v) SDS, 0.03% (w/v) bromphenol blue, 15% (v/v) glycerol, and 3% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol) was added, and the samples boiled for 5 min. All samples were separated on Ready Gel or Criterion (18-well) Tris-HCl precast 4–20% acrylamide gel (Bio-Rad) following the manufacturer's recommendations, and SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting were performed as described previously (12.Kanning K.C. Hudson M. Amieux P.S. Wiley J.C. Bothwell M. Schecterson L.C. Proteolytic processing of the p75 neurotrophin receptor and two homologs generates C-terminal fragments with signaling capability.J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 5425-5436Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For immunoprecipitation from primary tissues, brains were harvested from decapitated postnatal day 0 mouse pups. Dissection was performed in ice-cold PBS, pH 7.4, and collected tissues were kept on ice until lysis in cell homogenization buffer. At ∼24 h post-transfection, cells were rinsed three to five times with ice-cold PBS, pH 8.0, and left to stabilize for 15–30 min at 4 °C. EZ-Link sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin (Pierce), freshly prepared at 2 mg/ml in ice-cold PBS, pH 8.0, was added to each well, and culture dishes were incubated on ice at 4 °C for 30 min. Cells were then rinsed three to five times with PBS and 100 mm glycine, incubated at 4 °C for 5 min in the final rinse, lysed in cell homogenization buffer, and immunoprecipitated with ImmunoPure-immobilized streptavidin beads (50 μl/lysates; Pierce). For experiments employing biotinylation to identify cell surface proteins of cortical neurons, as a control to demonstrate the capacity of intracellular proteins to be biotinylated, cultures were briefly exposed to the biotinylation reagent after permeabilization in PBS/0.1% saponin. C57BL/6 postnatal day 0 mouse pup brains were removed and dissociated as described previously (14.Dilly K.W. Rossow C.F. Votaw V.S. Meabon J.S. Cabarrus J.L. Santana L.F. Mechanisms underlying variations in excitation-contraction coupling across the mouse left ventricular free wall.J. Physiol. 2006; 572: 227-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Purified neural cultures were plated at 1.25 × 105 to 2.5 × 105 cells/18 mm on glass coverslips coated with poly-d-lysine (0.1 mg/ml in distilled H2O; Sigma) and allowed to grow for 5–7 days in complete Neurobasal A medium (Invitrogen). The medium was not changed during the course of incubation. For studies of cellular distribution of LINGO in heart cells, dissociated cardiac myocytes were prepared as described previously (14.Dilly K.W. Rossow C.F. Votaw V.S. Meabon J.S. Cabarrus J.L. Santana L.F. Mechanisms underlying variations in excitation-contraction coupling across the mouse left ventricular free wall.J. Physiol. 2006; 572: 227-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Coverslip-grown cultures were rinsed with PBS, pH 7.4, and fixed with 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde in PBS for 30 min. Coverslips were then rinsed with PBS and permeabilized with 0.25% (v/v) Triton X-100 in PBS for 15 min. Permeabilization was followed by another PBS rinse. Coverslips were then blocked with 10% (w/v) BSA in PBS for 15 min and incubated overnight at 4 °C in primary antibody mixtures. The following primary antibodies were used: rabbit anti-LINGO-1 (1:1000; Upstate), mouse anti-LINGO-1 (1:500; R&D Systems), mouse anti-FLAG (1:1000; Sigma), mouse anti-V5 (1:1000; Invitrogen), mouse anti-c-Myc (1:500) (12.Kanning K.C. Hudson M. Amieux P.S. Wiley J.C. Bothwell M. Schecterson L.C. Proteolytic processing of the p75 neurotrophin receptor and two homologs generates C-terminal fragments with signaling capability.J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 5425-5436Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), mouse anti-EEA1 (1:500; BD Transduction Laboratories), mouse anti-Rab11 (1:500; Millipore), mouse anti-Rab7 (1:500; Sigma), mouse anti-Rab5 (1:250; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), mouse anti-GM130 (1:500; Abcam), mouse anti-mannose 6-phosphate receptor (1:1000; Abcam), mouse anti-β-coatomer protein (β-COP; 1:2000; Sigma), and goat anti-LAMP2 (1:200; Santa Cruz Biotechnology). After incubation, the primary antibodies were removed, and coverslips were rinsed three times with PBS (once quickly and twice for 10 min each). Coverslips were then incubated for 3 h at 4 °C with the appropriate secondary reagents (Molecular Probes): Alexa Fluor 568-conjugated donkey anti-goat IgG (1:1000), Alexa Fluor 555-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG (1:1000), Alexa Fluor 568-conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgG (1:1000), Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG (1:1000), and/or Alexa Fluor 546-conjugated streptavidin (1:2000). Coverslips were washed six times with cold PBS (three times quickly and three times for 10 min each), incubated with Hoechst 33258 (1:20,000) in distilled H2O for 7 min, post-fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min, rinsed with PBS, and washed twice for 10 min with distilled H2O. Coverslips were mounted onto slides with 1:1 glycerol/distilled H2O (plus 0.01% thimerosal, final concentration). All primary and secondary antibody mixtures were in 2.5% BSA in PBS. Fixed cells were imaged using a Zeiss LSM 510 META confocal microscope. 405 nm diode, 488 nm argon, and 543 HeNe excitation lasers were used. Images were routinely acquired at a depth yielding maximum fluorophore signals throughout the highest amount of neurite arborization resolvable. Only healthy-appearing cells with normal morphology and non-pyknotic nuclei were imaged. In studies using cells transfected with LINGO-1 plasmid, we used the smallest concentration of construct that would achieve readily detectable levels of LINGO-1 immunoreactivity to avoid possible effects of overexpression on intracellular trafficking of LINGO-1. Images were obtained at ×40 or ×63 (oil immersion) in multitrack multiframe mode with line averaging (set to 4). For co-localization studies, images were analyzed with the Imaris (Bitplane) co-localization plug-in and two-channel thresholding held constant within image sets to measure the percent region of interest co-localized between LINGO and the queried markers. The mean percent region of interest co-localization values obtained for all images were then determined using Microsoft Excel. AlignX (Vector NTI, Invitrogen), which uses a modified ClustalW algorithm, was employed for alignment of LINGO-1 sequences according to the developer's suggestions and parameters using mouse LINGO-1 (NP_851419.1) as a reference sequence for comparison with human (NP_116197.4), chicken (NP_001019748.1), Xenopus (NP_001093719.1), and elephant shark (AAVX01545473.1) LINGO-1 sequences. Cultured cerebellar granule neurons represent one system in which LINGO-1-dependent MAIF-induced neurite outgrowth inhibition has been reported (1.Mi S. Lee X. Shao Z. Thill G. Ji B. Relton J. Levesque M. Allaire N. Perrin S. Sands B. Crowell T. Cate R.L. McCoy J.M. Pepinsky R.B. LINGO-1 is a component of the Nogo-66 receptor/p75 signaling complex.Nat. Neurosci. 2004; 7: 221-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar). We characterized the distribution of LINGO-1 immunoreactivity by immunofluorescence confocal microscopy of dissociated cerebellar granular neurons from neonatal mice. The antibody we used reacts equally well with LINGO-1, LINGO-2, and LINGO-3 (data not shown); hence, we will hereafter refer to the protein identified generically as LINGO unless the identity of the LINGO paralog responsible was identified. To clearly delineate the plasma membrane, membrane proteins were covalently labeled with biotin by exposure to the membrane-impermeant reagent sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin, and biotin distribution was revealed by reaction with fluorescently labeled streptavidin. To our surprise, we could not detect LINGO immunoreactivity at the plasma membrane (Fig. 1A). Instead, LINGO immunoreactivity was observed as intracellular puncta, presumably representing intracellular membrane vesicles. This finding is consistent with a previous study that showed abundant intracellular localization of LINGO-1 immunoreactivity in differentiating neural stem cells (9.Lööv C. Fernqvist M. Walmsley A. Marklund N. Erlandsson A. Neutralization of LINGO-1 during in vitro differentiation of neural stem cells results in proliferation of immature neurons.PLoS ONE. 2012; 7: e29771Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). To assess whether a similar intracellular distribution characterizes other types of neurons, we localized LINGO-1 in neonatal mouse cortical neurons by immunofluorescence microscopy, as LINGO-1 is highly expressed in the developing mouse cortex (15.Carim-Todd L. Escarceller M. Estivill X. Sumoy L. LRRN6A/LERN1 (leucine-rich repeat neuronal protein 1), a novel gene with enriched expression in limbic system and neocortex.Eur. J. Neurosci. 2003; 18: 3167-3182Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). For this study, we used an antibody against the extracellular domain of LINGO-1, as this epitope should be accessible to antibody in intact non-permeabilized cells only if it is expressed in the plasma membrane. LINGO-1 immunoreactivity was not detected in non-permeabilized cells, but was detected in intracellular puncta, presumably representing intracellular membranes, in detergent-permeabilized cells (Fig. 1B). As an alternative approach to assess whether LINGO-1 is expressed at the cell surface, we examined the ability of the membrane-impermeant reagent sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin to biotinylate LINGO-1 in cultured neonatal mouse cortical neurons. Biotinylation was performed either with intact viable cells or after permeabilization of cells by exposure to 0.1% saponin. Following biotinylation, cells were washed and then solubilized in Triton X-100-containing buffer. Biotinylated proteins were isolated by precipitation with streptavidin-coated beads and resolved by SDS-PAGE, after which the quantity of several proteins, including LINGO, was assessed by immunoblot analysis. Immunoreactive Trk neurotrophin receptor protein (a mixture of TrkB and TrkC in cortical neurons) was used as a representative protein that distributes in both plasma membrane and intracellular membrane compartments, whereas pyruvate kinase was used as marker of the cytoplasmic compartment. Fig. 1C shows that for cells biotinylated after permeabilization, the biotin-containing fraction of protein contained pyruvate kinase, Trk, and LINGO-1. However, when cells were biotinylated without prior permeabilization, the biotinylated fraction of protein contained Trk, but not pyruvate kinase or LINGO. Thus, LINGO behaved as an exclusively intracellular protein in biotinylation experiments. Although LINGO-1 is most highly expressed in neural tissue, other tissues express one or more of the LINGO paralogs. We performed LINGO immunoprecipitation followed by immunoblot analysis to survey several mouse tissues for LINGO expression, as illustrated in Fig. 1D. Consistent with previously published studies, we found that LINGO expression was higher in neural tissues than in non-neural tissues, but significant LINGO immunoreactivity was present in a few non-neural tissues, including heart and lung. To determine whether LINGO proteins are restricted to intracellular membranes in non-neural cells as they are in neurons, we examined the subcellular distribution of LINGO in cultured mouse cardiac cells by immunofluorescence microscopy using mitochondria as a marker of the cytoplasmic compartment. As shown in Fig. 1E, LINGO immunoreactivity was abundantly present as intracellular puncta, whereas no cell-surface LINGO immunoreactivity was apparent. As the immunoblot analysis shown in Fig. 1D revealed that LINGO is expressed in several epithelial tissues such as skin and lung, we performed immunofluorescence microscopy and immunoblot analysis to screen several human epithelial cell lines, and we identified three human breast carcinoma cell lines (MCF-7, HCC1937, and MDA-MB-231) that express LINGO. We examined LINGO subcellular distribution in these cell lines by immunofluorescence microscopy. The results for MCF-7 cells are shown in Fig. 1F. LINGO was present as intracellular puncta, presumably reflecting expression on intracellular membranous organelles, whereas no LINGO could be detected at the cell surface. Because of the uncertainty concerning whether these results reflected LINGO-1 or another LINGO paralog, we assessed the expression of LINGO-1 in cultured human epithelial cells by transfecting an epithelial cell line that normally lacks LINGO immunoreactivity (HeLa cells) with LINGO-1 plasmid. In these experiments, we adjusted the quantity of LINGO-1 plasmid transfected to avoid expressing LINGO-1 at levels higher than those observed in cell types that natively express LINGO proteins. As shown in Fig. 1G, we again found that LINGO-1 was localized as intracellular puncta, and there was no evidence for LINGO-1 at the plasma membrane. The extracellular domains of LINGO family members share several structural motifs, including a series of leucine-rich repeat motifs (which are flanked by N- and C-terminal leucine-rich repeat cap variants) and an IgC2 domain proximal to the type 1 transmembrane domain. Clustal alignment of various vertebrate LINGO-1 sequences revealed that the LINGO-1 ICD sequence has been highly conserved through evolution (Fig. 2A), suggesting that this sequence is functionally important. ICDs of membrane proteins commonly bind cytoplasmic proteins that control trafficking between membrane subcompartments. Because the ICD of LINGO-1 is quite short, any alteration of this sequence is likely to impact LINGO-1 trafficking. Several previous studies demonstrating expression of LINGO-1 in the plasma membrane relied on overexpression of LINGO-1 constructs bearing C-terminal epitope tags. We reasoned that such modifications might disrupt the mechanisms that normally control intracellular trafficking of LINGO-1. To examine this possibility, we constructed plasmids encoding a series of LINGO-1 mutants (Fig. 2B) and compared the distribution of wild-type and mutant forms of LINGO-1 in transiently transfected HEK293 cells by confocal immunofluorescence microscopy (Fig. 2C). Untagged wild-type LINGO-1 was expressed as discrete microdomains, suggesting intracellular puncta. Because of our concern that protein binding might mask the antibody epitope in the C terminus of LINGO-1, we constructed N-terminal FLAG-tagged LINGO-1 (FLAG-LINGO-1). When stained with an anti-FLAG antibody, FLAG-LINGO-1 displayed punctum-like localization identical to that of wild-type LINGO-1. However, LINGO-1 altered by the addition of a C-terminal V5 tag (LINGO-1-V5) or by truncation of the C-terminal residues (LINGO-1-ΔICD-V5) was expressed in a lamellar distribution, suggesting close association with and potential insertion into the plasma membrane. WGA is a lectin that binds to sialic acid and N-acetylglucosaminyl residues found in the extracellular domains of membrane glycoproteins and is used to stain surface membranes. To extend the methods used to determine the relationship between these LINGO-1 constructs and the cell surface, we applied fluorescently conjugated WGA to briefly fixed HEK293 cells expressing wild-type LINGO-1 or LINGO-1-V5. Wild-type LINGO-1 was expressed in a punctate distribution in the interior part of the cell not labeled with WGA (Fig. 2D). However, LINGO-1-V5 co-localized extensively with the WGA-labeled cell surface. These results demonstrate that an intact and untagged LINGO-1 C terminus is essential for normal retention of LINGO-1 on intracellular membranes. Endogenously expressed LINGO-1 or LINGO-1 expressed from transfected plasmids appeared on immunoblots as two distinct bands, which we refer to as high molecular mass (HMM; ∼100 kDa) and low molecular mass (LMM; ∼90 kDa) LINGO-1 (Fig. 1B). Such heterogeneity in apparent molecular mass is commonly observed for membrane glycoproteins, which are typically modified by the addition of high-mannose core N-glycans in the endoplasmic reticulum, followed by modification of these N-glycans in the cis-Golgi. LINGO-1 is known to be modified by N-glycosylation (16.Mosyak L. Wood A. Dwyer B. Buddha M. Johnson M. Aulabaugh A. Zhong X. Presman E. Benard S. Kelleher K. Wilhelm J. Stahl M.L. Kriz R. Gao Y.

https://openalex.org/W2129939805,"Complications associated with the use of bisphosphonate (BP) have risen over the years due to an increase in the prescription of BP. BP-related osteonecrosis of jaw (BRONJ), one of the complications linked to the consumption of BP, greatly affects patients with minor dental trauma, incurring a long healing period. While BRONJ afflicts only a minority of patients prescribed with BP, BRONJ is a multigenic disease affected both by environmental and genetic factors having a distinctive phenotype. This study aims to discover genetic biomarkers associated with BRONJ via whole exome sequencing (WES) followed by statistical analysis. Sixteen individuals who had been prescribed with bisphosphonate medication and diagnosed as BRONJ were chosen and each individual’s saliva sample was collected for WES. 126 randomized subsamples from the GSK project representing 109 male and 17 female Koreans were used as a control data set. Fisher’s exact test was carried out to assess the significance of genetic variants in BRONJ patients. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) (DAVID Bioinformatics Resource 6.7) was used to perform a cluster analysis of variants found from Fisher‘s exact test. The results from this study suggest that BRONJ-inducing factors are genetically associated and BRONJ occurs due to the malfunctioning of post-translational modification in osteoclast leading to the impairment of cell morphology and adhesion."
https://openalex.org/W2145286433,"Water homeostasis and the structural integrity of the vertebrate lens is partially mediated by AQP0 channels. Emerging evidence indicates that external pH may be involved in channel gating. Here we show that a tetraploid teleost, the Atlantic salmon, retains 4 aqp0 genes (aqp0a1, -0a2, -0b1, and -0b2), which are highly, but not exclusively, expressed in the lens. Functional characterization reveals that, although each paralog permeates water efficiently, the permeability is respectively shifted to the neutral, alkaline, or acidic pH in Aqp0a1, -0a2, and -0b1, whereas that of Aqp0b2 is not regulated by external pH. Mutagenesis studies demonstrate that Ser38, His39, and His40 residues in the extracellular transmembrane domain of α-helix 2 facing the water pore are critical for the pH modulation of water transport. To validate these findings, we show that both zebrafish Aqp0a and -0b are functional water channels with respective pH sensitivities toward alkaline or acid pH ranges and that an N-terminal allelic variant (Ser19) of Aqp0b exists that abolishes water transport in Xenopus laevis oocytes. The data suggest that the alkaline pH sensitivity is a conserved trait in teleost Aqp0 a-type channels, whereas mammalian AQP0 and some teleost Aqp0 b-type channels display an acidic pH permeation preference.—Chauvigné, F., Zapater, C., Stavang, J.

https://openalex.org/W2042785984,"Background Dietary phytosterols, plant sterols structurally similar to cholesterol, reduce intestinal cholesterol absorption and have many other potentially beneficial biological effects in humans. Due to limited information on phytosterol levels in foods, however, it is difficult to quantify habitual dietary phytosterol intake (DPI). Therefore, we sought to identify a plasma biomarker of DPI. Methods and Findings Data were analyzed from two feeding studies with a total of 38 subjects during 94 dietary periods. DPI was carefully controlled at low, intermediate, and high levels. Plasma levels of phytosterols and cholesterol metabolites were assessed at the end of each diet period. Based on simple ordinary least squares regression analysis, the best biomarker for DPI was the ratio of plasma campesterol to the endogenous cholesterol metabolite 5-α-cholestanol (R2 = 0.785, P < 0.0001). Plasma campesterol and 5-α-cholestanol levels varied greatly among subjects at the same DPI level, but were positively correlated at each DPI level in both studies (r > 0.600; P < 0.01). Conclusion The ratio of plasma campesterol to the coordinately regulated endogenous cholesterol metabolite 5-α-cholestanol is a biomarker of dietary phytosterol intake. Conversely, plasma phytosterol levels alone are not ideal biomarkers of DPI because they are confounded by large inter-individual variation in absorption and turnover of non-cholesterol sterols. Further work is needed to assess the relation between non-cholesterol sterol metabolism and associated cholesterol transport in the genesis of coronary heart disease."
https://openalex.org/W2054312816,"Cerebellar malformations can be inherited or caused by insults during cerebellar development. To date, only sporadic cases of cerebellar malformations have been reported in dogs, and the genetic background has remained obscure. Therefore, this study`s objective was to describe the clinical characteristics, imaging features and pedigree data of a familial cerebellar hypoplasia in purebred Eurasier dogs. A uniform cerebellar malformation characterized by consistent absence of the caudal portions of the cerebellar vermis and, to a lesser degree, the caudal portions of the cerebellar hemispheres in association with large retrocerebellar fluid accumulations was recognized in 14 closely related Eurasier dogs. Hydrocephalus was an additional feature in some dogs. All dogs displayed non-progressive ataxia, which had already been noted when the dogs were 5 – 6 weeks old. The severity of the ataxia varied between dogs, from mild truncal sway, subtle dysmetric gait, dysequilibrium and pelvic limb ataxia to severe cerebellar ataxia in puppies and episodic falling or rolling. Follow-up examinations in adult dogs showed improvement of the cerebellar ataxia and a still absent menace response. Epileptic seizures occurred in some dogs. The association of partial vermis agenesis with an enlarged fourth ventricle and an enlarged caudal (posterior) fossa resembled a Dandy-Walker-like malformation in some dogs. Pedigree analyses were consistent with autosomal recessive inheritance."

We retrospectively reviewed records from all hospitalized patients who had liver biopsy at a single hospital in South Africa from 2001 to 2009 and compared diagnosis by HIV status. During the period of study 262 patients had liver biopsy, 108 (41%) were HIV-infected, 25 (10%) were HIV-sero-negative, and 129 (49%) had unknown or unrecorded HIV status. Overall 81% of biopsies provided additional diagnostic data. Malignancy was the most common finding reported on 56 (21%) biopsies followed by granuloma or TB, hepatic steatosis, and fibrosis or cirrhosis. HIV-infected patients were more likely to have granulomas and steatosis. Half of patients with granulomas were already on TB treatment, suggesting paradoxical reactions or drug induced liver injury may have been important causes of liver inflammation among these patients. We note that TB, paradoxical reactions during TB treatment, possible drug induced liver injury, and hepatic steatosis are important causes of liver pathology among HIV-infected hospitalized patients with unclear etiology of liver disease after initial assessment. Among HIV sero-negative patients, malignancy was the major cause of liver disease. Our findings re-enforce the importance of TB as a diagnosis among HIV-infected individuals."
https://openalex.org/W2158232507,"Humanized hapten-binding IgGs were designed with an accessible cysteine close to their binding pockets, for specific covalent payload attachment. Individual analyses of known structures of digoxigenin (Dig)- and fluorescein (Fluo) binding antibodies and a new structure of a biotin (Biot)-binder, revealed a ""universal"" coupling position (52(+2)) in proximity to binding pockets but without contributing to hapten interactions. Payloads that carry a free thiol are positioned on the antibody and covalently linked to it via disulfides. Covalent coupling is achieved and driven toward complete (95-100%) payload occupancy by spontaneous redox shuffling between antibody and payload. Attachment at the universal position works with different haptens, antibodies, and payloads. Examples are the haptens Fluo, Dig, and Biot combined with various fluorescent or peptidic payloads. Disulfide-bonded covalent antibody-payload complexes do not dissociate in vitro and in vivo. Coupling requires the designed cysteine and matching payload thiol because payload or antibody without the Cys/thiol are not linked (<5% nonspecific coupling). Hapten-mediated positioning is necessary as hapten-thiol-payload is only coupled to antibodies that bind matching haptens. Covalent complexes are more stable in vivo than noncovalent counterparts because digoxigeninylated or biotinylated fluorescent payloads without disulfide-linkage are cleared more rapidly in mice (approximately 50% reduced 48 hour serum levels) compared with their covalently linked counterparts. The coupling technology is applicable to many haptens and hapten binding antibodies (confirmed by automated analyses of the structures of 140 additional hapten binding antibodies) and can be applied to modulate the pharmacokinetics of small compounds or peptides. It is also suitable to link payloads in a reduction-releasable manner to tumor- or tissue-targeting delivery vehicles."
https://openalex.org/W2065212988,"Protein phosphorylation mediates essentially all aspects of cellular life. In humans, this is achieved by ∼500 kinases, each recognizing a specific consensus motif (CM) in the substrates. The majority of CMs are surface-exposed and are thought to be accessible to kinases for phosphorylation. Here we investigated the archetypical protein kinase A (PKA)-mediated phosphorylation of filamin, a major cytoskeletal protein that can adopt an autoinhibited conformation. Surprisingly, autoinhibited filamin is refractory to phosphorylation by PKA on a known Ser2152 site despite its CM being exposed and the corresponding isolated peptide being readily phosphorylated. Structural analysis revealed that although the CM fits into the PKA active site its surrounding regions sterically clash with the kinase. However, upon ligand binding, filamin undergoes a conformational adjustment, allowing rapid phosphorylation on Ser2152. These data uncover a novel ligand-induced conformational switch to trigger filamin phosphorylation. They further suggest a substrate shape-dependent filtering mechanism that channels specific exposed CM/kinase recognition in diverse signaling responses."
https://openalex.org/W1978117567,"It was reported that the aluminosilicate material mica activated macrophages and showed its immunostimulating effects. However, the mechanisms by which it exerts these effects are unclear. To address this, we evaluated the effects of mica fine particles (MFP, 804.1 ± 0.02 nm) on the murine macrophage cell line, RAW 264.7. Specifically, RAW 264.7 cells were treated with 100 and 500 μg/mL MFP and their proliferative response was determined using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. Changes in global gene expression upon MFP treatment for 12 and 48 h were also determined using microarrays. Following the MFP treatment, RAW 264.7 cells showed a low level of proliferation compared to nontreated cells (p < 0.01). There was a change in an expression level of 1,128 genes after 48 h treatment. Specifically, genes associated with the cell cycle, DNA replication, and pyrimidine and purine metabolisms, were down-regulated in cells treated with MFP, which resulted in reduction of cell proliferation. MFP treatment also up-regulated genes associated with lysosome and phagosome function, which are both required for macrophage activities. We speculate that activation of macrophages by mica is in part derived from up-regulation of these pathways."
https://openalex.org/W1993596109,"Co-evolution of transcription factors (TFs) with their respective cis-regulatory network enhances functional diversity in the course of evolution. We present a new approach to investigate transactivation capacity of sequence-specific TFs in evolutionary studies. Saccharomyces cerevisiae was used as an in vivo test tube and p53 proteins derived from human and five commonly used animal models were chosen as proof of concept. p53 is a highly conserved master regulator of environmental stress responses. Previous reports indicated conserved p53 DNA binding specificity in vitro, even for evolutionary distant species. We used isogenic yeast strains where p53-dependent transactivation was measured towards chromosomally integrated p53 response elements (REs). Ten REs were chosen to sample a wide range of DNA binding affinity and transactivation capacity for human p53 and proteins were expressed at two levels using an inducible expression system. We showed that the assay is amenable to study thermo-sensitivity of frog p53, and that chimeric constructs containing an ectopic transactivation domain could be rapidly developed to enhance the activity of proteins, such as fruit fly p53, that are poorly effective in engaging the yeast transcriptional machinery. Changes in the profile of relative transactivation towards the ten REs were measured for each p53 protein and compared to the profile obtained with human p53. These results, which are largely independent from relative p53 protein levels, revealed widespread evolutionary divergence of p53 transactivation specificity, even between human and mouse p53. Fruit fly and human p53 exhibited the largest discrimination among REs while zebrafish p53 was the least selective."
https://openalex.org/W2036653437,"Transforming growth factor (TGF)-β2 is an important anti-inflammatory protein in milk and colostrum. TGF-β2 supplementation appears to reduce gut inflammatory diseases in early life, such as necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) in young mice. However, the molecular mechanisms by which TGF-β2 protects immature intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) remain to be more clearly elucidated before interventions in infants can be considered. Porcine IECs PsIc1 were treated with TGF-β2 and/or lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and changes in the cellular proteome were subsequently analyzed using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis-MS and LC-MS-based proteomics. TGF-β2 alone induced the differential expression of 13 proteins and the majority of the identified proteins were associated with stress responses, TGF-β and Toll-like receptor 4 signaling cascades. In particular, a series of heat shock proteins had similar differential trends as previously shown in the intestine of NEC-resistant preterm pigs and young mice. Furthermore, LC-MS-based proteomics and Western blot analyses revealed 20 differentially expressed proteins following treatment with TGF-β2 in LPS-challenged IECs. Thirteen of these proteins were associated with stress response pathways, among which five proteins were altered by LPS and restored by TGF-β2, whereas six were differentially expressed only by TGF-β2 in LPS-challenged IECs. Based on previously reported biological functions, these patterns indicate the anti-stress and anti-inflammatory effects of TGF-β2 in IECs. We conclude that TGF-β2 of dietary or endogenous origin may regulate the IEC responses against LPS stimuli, thereby supporting cellular homeostasis and innate immunity in response to bacterial colonization, and the first enteral feeding in early life."
https://openalex.org/W2054287151,"Alzheimer disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia. As with many complex diseases, the identified variants do not explain the total expected genetic risk that is based on heritability estimates for AD. Isolated founder populations, such as the Amish, are advantageous for genetic studies as they overcome heterogeneity limitations associated with complex population studies. We determined that Amish AD cases harbored a significantly higher burden of the known risk alleles compared to Amish cognitively normal controls, but a significantly lower burden when compared to cases from a dataset of unrelated individuals. Whole-exome sequencing of a selected subset of the overall study population was used as a screening tool to identify variants located in the regions of the genome that are most likely to contribute risk. By then genotyping the top candidate variants from the known AD genes and from linkage regions implicated previous studies in the full dataset, new associations could be confirmed. The most significant result (p = 0.0012) was for rs73938538, a synonymous variant in LAMA1 within the previously identified linkage peak on chromosome 18. However, this association is specific to the Amish and did not generalize when tested in a dataset of unrelated individuals. These results suggest that additional risk variation in the Amish remains to be identified and likely resides outside of the classical protein coding gene regions."
https://openalex.org/W2140369456,"A20 protects against pathologic vascular remodeling by inhibiting the inflammatory transcription factor NF-κB. A20's function has been attributed to ubiquitin editing of receptor-interacting protein 1 (RIP1) to influence activity/stability. The validity of this mechanism was tested using a murine model of transplant vasculopathy and human cells. Mouse C57BL/6 aortae transduced with adenoviruses containing A20 (or β-galactosidase as a control) were allografted into major histocompatibility complex-mismatched BALB/c mice. Primary endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, or transformed epithelial cells (all human) were transfected with wild-type A20 or with catalytically inactive mutants as a control. NF-κB activity and intracellular localization of RIP1 was monitored by reporter gene assay, immunofluorescent staining, and Western blotting. Native and catalytically inactive versions of A20 had similar inhibitory effects on NF-κB activity (-70% vs. -76%; P > 0.05). A20 promoted localization of RIP1 to insoluble aggresomes in murine vascular allografts and in human cells (53% vs. 0%) without altering RIP1 expression, and this process was increased by the assembly of polyubiquitin chains (87% vs. 28%; P < 0.05). A20 captures polyubiquitinated signaling intermediaries in insoluble aggresomes, thus reducing their bioavailability for downstream NF-κB signaling. This novel mechanism contributes to protection from vasculopathy in transplanted organs treated with exogenous A20."
https://openalex.org/W2015020746,"Contagious bovine pleuropneumonia (CBPP) is a cattle disease that has hampered the development of the livestock sector in sub-Saharan Africa. Currently, vaccination with a live vaccine strain is its recommended control measure although unofficial antimicrobial use is widely practiced. Here, modelling techniques are used to assess the potential impact of early elimination of infected cattle via accurate diagnosis on CBPP dynamics. A herd-level stochastic epidemiological model explicitly incorporating test sensitivity and specificity is developed. Interventions by annual vaccination, annual testing and elimination and a combination of both are implemented in a stepwise manner and their effectiveness compared by running 1000 simulations per intervention over ten years. The model predicts that among the simulated interventions, the ones likely to eliminate the disease from an isolated herd all involved annual vaccination of more than 75% of the animals with a vaccine that protects for at least 18 months combined with annual testing (and elimination of positive reactors) of 75% of the animals every six months after vaccination. The highest probability of disease elimination was 97.5% and this could occur within a median of 2.3 years. Generally, our model predicts that regular testing and elimination of positive reactors using improved tests will play a significant role in minimizing CBPP burden especially in the current situation where improved vaccines are yet to be developed."
https://openalex.org/W1997026546,"Mitochondria play a key role in diverse processes including ATP synthesis and apoptosis. Mitochondrial function can be studied using inhibitors of respiration, and new agents are valuable for discovering novel mechanisms involved in mitochondrial regulation. Here, we screened small molecules derived from slime molds and other microorganisms for their effects on mitochondrial oxygen consumption. We identified Ppc-1 as a novel molecule which stimulates oxygen consumption without adverse effects on ATP production. The kinetic behavior of Ppc-1 suggests its function as a mitochondrial uncoupler. Serial administration of Ppc-1 into mice suppressed weight gain with no abnormal effects on liver or kidney tissues, and no evidence of tumor formation. Serum fatty acid levels were significantly elevated in mice treated with Ppc-1, while body fat content remained low. After a single administration, Ppc-1 distributes into various tissues of individual animals at low levels. Ppc-1 stimulates adipocytes in culture to release fatty acids, which might explain the elevated serum fatty acids in Ppc-1-treated mice. The results suggest that Ppc-1 is a unique mitochondrial regulator which will be a valuable tool for mitochondrial research as well as the development of new drugs to treat obesity."
https://openalex.org/W2021196840,"Objectives To investigate a multimodal, multiparametric perfusion MRI / 18F-fluoro-deoxyglucose-(18F-FDG)-PET imaging protocol for monitoring regorafenib therapy effects on experimental colorectal adenocarcinomas in rats with immunohistochemical validation. Materials and Methods Human colorectal adenocarcinoma xenografts (HT-29) were implanted subcutaneously in n = 17 (n = 10 therapy group; n = 7 control group) female athymic nude rats (Hsd:RH-Foxn1rnu). Animals were imaged at baseline and after a one-week daily treatment protocol with regorafenib (10 mg/kg bodyweight) using a multimodal, multiparametric perfusion MRI/18F-FDG-PET imaging protocol. In perfusion MRI, quantitative parameters of plasma flow (PF, mL/100 mL/min), plasma volume (PV, %) and endothelial permeability-surface area product (PS, mL/100 mL/min) were calculated. In 18F-FDG-PET, tumor-to-background-ratio (TTB) was calculated. Perfusion MRI parameters were correlated with TTB and immunohistochemical assessments of tumor microvascular density (CD-31) and cell proliferation (Ki-67). Results Regorafenib significantly (p<0.01) suppressed PF (81.1±7.5 to 50.6±16.0 mL/100mL/min), PV (12.1±3.6 to 7.5±1.6%) and PS (13.6±3.2 to 7.9±2.3 mL/100mL/min) as well as TTB (3.4±0.6 to 1.9±1.1) between baseline and day 7. Immunohistochemistry revealed significantly (p<0.03) lower tumor microvascular density (CD-31, 7.0±2.4 vs. 16.1±5.9) and tumor cell proliferation (Ki-67, 434.0 ± 62.9 vs. 663.0 ± 98.3) in the therapy group. Perfusion MRI parameters ΔPF, ΔPV and ΔPS showed strong and significant (r = 0.67-0.78; p<0.01) correlations to the PET parameter ΔTTB and significant correlations (r = 0.57-0.67; p<0.03) to immunohistochemical Ki-67 as well as to CD-31-stainings (r = 0.49-0.55; p<0.05). Conclusions A multimodal, multiparametric perfusion MRI/PET imaging protocol allowed for non-invasive monitoring of regorafenib therapy effects on experimental colorectal adenocarcinomas in vivo with significant correlations between perfusion MRI parameters and 18F-FDG-PET validated by immunohistochemistry."
https://openalex.org/W1985583055,"Autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) is a feasible procedure for human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) lymphoma patients, whose underlying disease and intrinsic HIV-1- and ASCT-associated immunodeficiency might increase the risk for γ-herpesvirus load persistence and/or reactivation. We evaluated this hypothesis by investigating the levels of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)- and Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV)-DNA levels in the peripheral blood of 22 HIV-1-associated lymphoma patients during ASCT, highlighting their relationship with γ-herpesvirus lymphoma status, immunological parameters, and clinical events. EBV-DNA was detected in the pre-treatment plasma and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of 12 (median 12135 copies/mL) and 18 patients (median 417 copies/106 PBMCs), respectively; the values in the two compartments were correlated (r = 0.77, p = 0.0001). Only EBV-positive lymphomas showed detectable levels of plasma EBV-DNA. After debulking chemotherapy, plasma EBV-DNA was associated with lymphoma chemosensitivity (p = 0.03) and a significant higher mortality risk by multivariate Cox analysis adjusted for EBV-lymphoma status (HR, 10.46, 95% CI, 1.11–98.32, p = 0.04). After infusion, EBV-DNA was detectable in five EBV-positive lymphoma patients who died within six months. KSHV-DNA load was positive in only one patient, who died from primary effusion lymphoma. Fluctuations in levels of KSHV-DNA reflected the patient’s therapy and evolution of his underlying lymphoma. Other γ-herpesvirus-associated malignancies, such as multicentric Castleman disease and Kaposi sarcoma, or end-organ complications after salvage treatment were not found. Overall, these findings suggest a prognostic and predictive value of EBV-DNA and KSHV-DNA, the monitoring of which could be a simple, complementary tool for the management of γ-herpesvirus-positive lymphomas in HIV-1 patients submitted to ASCT."
https://openalex.org/W2063087105,"Proteasome-mediated proteolysis provides dynamic spatial and temporal modulation of protein concentration in response to various intrinsic and extrinsic challenges. To gain a better understanding of the role of the proteasome in DNA repair, we systematically monitored the stability of 26 proteins involved in nucleotide excision repair (NER) under normal growth conditions. Among six NER factors found to be regulated by the proteasome, we further delineated the specific pathway involved in the degradation of Rad25, a subunit of TFIIH. We demonstrate that Rad25 turnover requires the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme Ubc4 and the ubiquitin ligase Ufd4. Interestingly, the deletion of UFD4 specifically suppresses the rad25 mutant defective in transcription. Our results reveal a novel function of the Ufd4 pathway and another tie between the proteasome and NER regulators."
https://openalex.org/W2008412576,"Researchers are regularly interested in interpreting the multipartite structure of data entities according to their functional relationships. Data is often heterogeneous with intricately hidden inner structure. With limited prior knowledge, researchers are likely to confront the problem of transforming this data into knowledge. We develop a new framework, called heat-passing, which exploits intrinsic similarity relationships within noisy and incomplete raw data, and constructs a meaningful map of the data. The proposed framework is able to rank, cluster, and visualize the data all at once. The novelty of this framework is derived from an analogy between the process of data interpretation and that of heat transfer, in which all data points contribute simultaneously and globally to reveal intrinsic similarities between regions of data, meaningful coordinates for embedding the data, and exemplar data points that lie at optimal positions for heat transfer. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the heat-passing framework for robustly partitioning the complex networks, analyzing the globin family of proteins and determining conformational states of macromolecules in the presence of high levels of noise. The results indicate that the methodology is able to reveal functionally consistent relationships in a robust fashion with no reference to prior knowledge. The heat-passing framework is very general and has the potential for applications to a broad range of research fields, for example, biological networks, social networks and semantic analysis of documents."
