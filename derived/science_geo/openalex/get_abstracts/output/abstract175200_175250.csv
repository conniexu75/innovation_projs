https://openalex.org/W2148596731,"The pattern of local image velocities on the retina encodes important environmental information. Although humans are generally able to extract this information, they can easily be deceived into seeing incorrect velocities. We show that these 'illusions' arise naturally in a system that attempts to estimate local image velocity. We formulated a model of visual motion perception using standard estimation theory, under the assumptions that (i) there is noise in the initial measurements and (ii) slower motions are more likely to occur than faster ones. We found that specific instantiation of such a velocity estimator can account for a wide variety of psychophysical phenomena."

They are characterized by the presence of seven conserved amino acid residues involved in coordinating the dimetal nuclear center in their reactive site. We compared the 29 PAPs predicted for Arabidopsis thaliana in their varieties of potential metal-ligating residues. Although 24 members possessed sets of metal-ligating residues typical of known PAPs, 1 member lacked four of the seven residues. For the remaining four members, potential metal-ligating residues were generally more similar to those in metal-dependent exonucleases and related proteins. Evidence was obtained for the expression of the majority of the 29 PAPs. To facilitate future investigations, a scheme for naming Arabidopsis PAPs and a system for classifying the 29 PAPs are proposed. The cDNA sequences and the responses to phosphate deprivation of sevenArabidopsis PAPs (AtPAP7–AtPAP13) were characterized. For some AtPAPs analyzed, there were fully processed transcripts as well as splice variants. The splice variants of AtPAP10 were found to associate with polyribosomes and may be translated into a NH2-terminal truncated protein. Phylogenetic investigations showed that AtPAPs 7 and 8, together with similar enzymes from other plant species, formed the low molecular weight plant PAP group. Members of this group were more closely related to PAPs from mammalian cells. AtPAPs 9–13, together with kidney bean PAP, formed the high molecular weight PAP group. In phosphate deprivation experiments, gene transcription of AtPAP11 and AtPAP12 was induced and increased, respectively, whereas that of the remaining five AtPAPs was not affected by phosphate deprivation. The present work demonstrates that structure variation and expression regulation of plant PAPs are more complex than previously described and provides a framework for comprehensive molecular genetic and biochemical studies of allArabidopsis PAPs in the future.

Gene (Amst.). 2000; 250: 117-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The definition of the conserved sequence motifs has also aided identification of potential PAP coding sequences from bacterial species (4Schenk G. Guddat L.W., Ge, Y. Carrington L.E. Hume D.A.

Evolutionarily, PAPs belong to the metallo-phosphoesterase family of proteins, members of which also include phosphoprotein phosphatases, diadenosine tetraphosphatases, exonucleases, 5′-nucleotidases, and other types of phosphomonoesterases (1Klabunde T.

The structure motif conserved in metallo-phosphoesterases is the β-α-β-α-β fold (1Klabunde T. Strater N. Frohlich R. Witzel H. Krebs B. J. Mol.

The amino acid residues involved in coordinating the dimetal nuclear center (Fe(III)-M(II)) are located at the carboxyl ends of the parallel β-strands of the β-α-β-α-β fold. The complement of amino acid residues involved in metal ligation in different types of metallo-phosphoesterases has recently been investigated based on the alignment of conserved sequence motifs. For PAPs, a comparison of multiple sequences from both eukaryotic and prokaryotic organisms has delineated seven invariant residues contained in five blocks of conserved amino acid sequences being the ones required for metal coordination (4Schenk G. Guddat L.W., Ge, Y. Carrington L.E. Hume D.A. Hamilton S. de Jersey J. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 250: 117-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 5Schenk G. Korsinczky M.L. Hume D.A.

For exonucleases and structurally related proteins, there are also seven potential metal-ligating residues that distribute in five blocks of conserved amino acid sequences (D X H/GD XXX/GNH(D/E)/XX(G/A)H/(G/A)H X H) (1Klabunde T. Strater N. Frohlich R. Witzel H. Krebs B. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 259: 737-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). For phosphoprotein phosphatases and structurally related proteins, there are only six metal-coordinating residues (D X H/GD XXX/GNH(D/E)/XXX H/XXX H) (1Klabunde T. Strater N. Frohlich R. Witzel H. Krebs B. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 259: 737-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). It is clear that different metallo-phosphoesterases share similarities in both the number and composition of their metal-ligating residues. The purple color in the purified proteins of known PAPs is caused by a charge transfer transition at −560 nm from the metal-coordinating tyrosine residue to the metal ligand Fe(III). Despite the presence of conserved structural and sequence motifs, PAPs from different, or even the same, species can differ from each other in the composition of their dimetal nuclear center and their overall structures. The composition of the dimetal nuclear center in mammalian PAPs is Fe(III)-Fe(II), whereas in plants it is either Fe(III)-Zn(II) (as in KBPAP and PAP from soybean) or Fe(III)-Mn(II) (as in one of the PAPs from sweet potato) (17Klabunde T.

Acta. 1986; 869: 61-68Crossref Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Structurally, the high molecular weight (HMW) plant PAPs (typified by KBPAP) possess two domains (1Klabunde T. Strater N. Frohlich R. Witzel H. Krebs B. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 259: 737-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar, 3Strater N. Klabunde T. Tucker P. Witzel H. Krebs B. Science. 1995; 268: 1489-1492Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). The NH2-domain does not have catalytic function. It is composed of two sandwiched β-sheets. By homology modeling, the structure formed by the two sandwiched β-sheets is later found to resemble the fibronectin type III domain commonly seen in animal proteins (21Tsyguelnaia I. Doolittle R.F. J. Mol. Evol. 1998; 46: 612-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The COOH-domain has the metal center and is the catalytic domain of the enzyme. It consists of two sandwiched mixed β-sheets that include two β-α-β-α-β motifs. In contrast, mammalian PAPs (typified by tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase and uteroferrin) have only one domain in their structure with an overall fold similar to that of the catalytic domain of KBPAP (13Uppenberg J. Lindqvist F. Svensson C., Ek- Rylander B. Andersson G. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 290: 201-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 22Lindqvist Y. Johansson E. Kaija H. Vihko P. Schneider G. J. Mol.

Des. 1999; 7: 757-767Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (163) Google Scholar). The low molecular weight (LMW) plant PAPs have been described only recently, and are substantially smaller in size compared with HMW plant PAPs (4Schenk G. Guddat L.W., Ge, Y. Carrington L.E. Hume D.A. Hamilton S. de Jersey J. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 250: 117-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Homology modeling shows that LMW plant PAPs lack the equivalent of the NH2-domain of KBPAP and are hence structurally similar to mammalian PAPs (4Schenk G. Guddat L.W., Ge, Y. Carrington L.E. Hume D.A. Hamilton S. de Jersey J. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 250: 117-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Biochemically, HMW plant PAPs function as homodimeric proteins with a molecular mass of ∼55 kDa/monomer, whereas mammalian PAPs are typically monomeric proteins with a molecular mass of ∼35 kDa (1Klabunde T. Strater N. Frohlich R. Witzel H. Krebs B. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 259: 737-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar, 2Klabunde T. Strater N. Krebs B. Witzel H.

Des. 1999; 7: 757-767Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Many PAPs are glycoproteins that are targeted to the secretary pathway (4Schenk G. Guddat L.W., Ge, Y. Carrington L.E. Hume D.A. Hamilton S. de Jersey J. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 250: 117-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). One PAP from Spirodela oligorrhiza has been found to be glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchored in the cell (24Nakazato H. Okamoto T. Nishikoori M. Washio K. Morita N. Haraguchi K. Thompson G.A., Jr. Okuyama H. Plant Physiol. 1998; 118: 1015-1020Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Another PAP from Lupinus albus may contain a third domain (with a structure resembling that of sterol desaturases) at the carboxyl terminus (25Wasaki J. Omura M. Osaki M. Ito H. Matsui H. Shinano T. Tadano T. Soil Sci. Plant Nutr. 1999; 45: 439-449Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 26Miller S.S. Liu J. Allan D.L. Menzhuber C.J. Fedorova M. Vance C.P. Plant Physiol. 2001; 127: 594-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). It is not known how common the latter two forms of posttranslational modification are in PAPs from other species. In in vitro reactions, PAPs have been shown to catalyze the hydrolysis of activated phosphoric acid esters and anhydrides at a pH range of 4–7 (1Klabunde T. Strater N. Frohlich R. Witzel H. Krebs B. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 259: 737-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). However, the in vivo function of PAPs remains largely unknown. Mammalian PAPs may play a variety of physiological roles, including resorption of bone and cartilage breakdown, iron transport, and generation of reactive oxygen species in a Fenton-like reaction (27Hayman A.R. Jones S.J. Boyde A. Foster D. Colledge W.H. Carlton M.B. Evans M.J. Cox T.M. Development. 1996; 122: 3151-3162Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Nuttleman P.R. Roberts R.M. J. Biol.

In higher plants, PAPs have mostly been studied for their potential involvement in phosphorus nutrition because their hydrolytic activity may aid the release of inorganic P (Pi) from organic P that is not readily available to plant cells. Two PAPs (secreted PAP, membrane PAP) from L. albus have been shown to be highly inducible by phosphate deprivation (25Wasaki J. Omura M. Osaki M. Ito H. Matsui H. Shinano T. Tadano T. Soil Sci. Plant Nutr. 1999; 45: 439-449Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 26Miller S.S. Liu J. Allan D.L. Menzhuber C.J. Fedorova M. Vance C.P. Plant Physiol. 2001; 127: 594-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). The induction and secretion of secreted PAP are specific to proteoid roots, a structure that is specifically formed inL. albus as one of the adaptations to phosphorus deficiency, indicating that, at least in this species, PAPs may play an important part in phosphorus nutrition (26Miller S.S. Liu J. Allan D.L. Menzhuber C.J. Fedorova M. Vance C.P. Plant Physiol. 2001; 127: 594-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 30Johnson J.F. Vance C.P. Allan D.L. Plant Physiol. 1996; 112: 31-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). AtACP5, a PAP fromArabidopsis thaliana, is induced by both phosphate deprivation and oxidative stress (31del Pozo J.C. Allona I. Rubio V. Leyva A. de la Pena A. Aragoncillo C. Paz-Ares J. Plant J. 1999; 19: 579-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). This enzyme may be involved in phosphate mobilization as well as the metabolism of reactive oxygen species in stressed or senescent plant tissues (31del Pozo J.C. Allona I. Rubio V. Leyva A. de la Pena A. Aragoncillo C. Paz-Ares J. Plant J. 1999; 19: 579-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). The promoter of a separate Arabidopsis PAP gene has also been shown to be inducible by phosphate deprivation, although in this case the corresponding PAP enzyme has not been characterized (32Haran S. Logendra S. Seskar M. Bratanova M. Raskin I. Plant Physiol. 2000; 124: 615-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). In addition, several Arabidopsis PAPs may possess phytase activity because their proteins show high levels of homology to a phytase recently reported from soybean (33Hegeman C.E. Grabau E.A. Plant Physiol. 2001; 126: 1598-1608Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Given the structural and biochemical diversities described above, it is likely that PAPs from higher plants may have yet undiscovered functions, the elucidation of which may contribute significantly to the understanding of important aspects of plant biology. Genetically, higher plant species often contain multiple genes coding for different PAPs. In sweet potato four PAPs have been described (4Schenk G. Guddat L.W., Ge, Y. Carrington L.E. Hume D.A. Hamilton S. de Jersey J. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 250: 117-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar,18Schenk G. Carrington L.E. Hamilton S.E. de Jersey J. Guddat L.W. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

Biochem. 1999; 260: 709-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 34Durmus A. Eicken C. Spener F. Krebs B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1434: 202-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In Arabidopsis, the AGI project has annotated 16 different PAP genes searchable at the Institute for Genomic Research (TIGR) Arabidopsis data base. The existence of multiple PAPs in the same species may hinder functional investigations because of potential genetic and functional redundancies. Additionally, studies on PAP may be complicated by the presence in higher plants of other types of acid phosphatases, which often react to environmental stimuli in ways similar to PAPs. For example, the LePS2 acid phosphatase is strongly induced by phosphate deprivation (35Baldwin J.C. Karthikeyan A.S. Raghothama K.G. Plant Physiol. 2001; 125: 728-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). However, molecular investigations show that LePS2 is related to a new class of phosphohydrolases rather than to PAPs (35Baldwin J.C. Karthikeyan A.S. Raghothama K.G. Plant Physiol. 2001; 125: 728-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). To study the function of PAPs in plant biology systematically, it is desirable to employ a plant species for which genetic knowledge on PAPs as well as other types of acid phosphatases is already available. We have selected the model plant species A. thaliana in our studies on higher plant PAPs. A search of the annotated genome data base of Arabidopsis reveals that, in addition to PAP genes, this species also contains genes encoding several other types of phosphatases that may share some similarities with PAPs in reacting to physiological and environmental cues. These enzymes include histidine acid phosphatase (1 gene), vegetative storage protein type of acid phosphatases (10 genes), and phosphatidic acid phosphatase (4 genes). However, PAPs form by far the largest group of acid phosphatases inArabidopsis with 16 different members in the TIGR data base. In this paper we report the finding of more Arabidopsis PAP members from data base searching, comparative analysis of conserved metal-ligating amino acid residues in 29 PAPs, and propose schemes for naming and classifying these PAPs. We also describe cDNA cloning and amino acid sequence analysis for seven PAPs encoded by chromosome 2. The patterns of primary structure variation in both LMW and HMWArabidopsis PAPs are also reported. As an entry point to functional dissection, the response of the seven PAPs to phosphate deprivation in suspension cells is examined. Based on the work presented here, effective strategies for further studies ofArabidopsis PAPs are discussed. Initially, a search using the phrase “purple acid phosphatase” was conducted at the TIGR web site (www.tigr.org/tdb/e2k1/ath1/GeneNameSearch.shtml). This search resulted in the retrieval of the predicted amino acid sequences of 16 different PAPs. In the second stage, the predicted protein sequences were each used as query sequences for Blastp searches at the TAIR A. thaliana genomic blast web page (arabidopsis.org/Blast/index.html) using the default setting. Identification of additional predicted PAPs in the Blastp search was based on two criteria: at least 20% identical to the query sequence and the possession of amino acid sequence elements that could be related to the conserved sequence motifs (D XG/GD XX Y/GNH(E/D)/VX 2 H/GH X H) defined previously for PAPs. Thirteen additional predicted PAPs were found in this step. In the third stage, the predicted protein sequences of the newly retrieved 13 PAPs were each used as query sequences for another round of Blastp search at the TAIR web site. However, no more predicted PAPs were found, suggesting that the total number of predicted PAPs in the Arabidopsis genome was likely to be 29. To identify expressed sequence tags and/or cDNA sequences for the 29 PAPs, several nucleic acid and protein data bases, including the TIGR Arabidopsis Gene Index (www.tigr.org/tdb/agi/, this site also contains full-length cDNA sequences for 5000Arabidopsis genes), MIPS (mips.gsf.de/proj/thal/db/index.html), and GenBankTM (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/), were searched. For naming the 29 Arabidopsis PAPs according to their positions on the different chromosomes, the prefix “AtPAP” (for A. thaliana PAP) was used. To establish a classification scheme for Arabidopsis PAPs, clustering analysis of amino acid sequences was conducted. It is known from previous work and from our study (see “Results”) that the predicted protein sequences of some Arabidopsis genes contained localized errors because of imprecise prediction of intron and exon boundaries during the annotation process. To improve the accuracy of the clustering analysis, two measures were taken. First, for the seven PAPs (AtPAP7–AtPAP13; Table III) investigated in this study and the three PAPs (AtPAP3, AtPAP17, AtPAP18; Table III) studied by previous researchers, amino acid sequences derived from cDNAs were used. Consequently, in only 19 of the 29 ArabidopsisPAPs, the predicted amino acid sequences were employed for the clustering analysis. Second, during the analysis, the “complete deletion option” was chosen with respect to sites involved in alignment gaps. The incorrectly predicted amino acid sites would cause gaps in multiple alignment of sequences. The adoption of the complete deletion option may minimize the impact of the prediction errors on the clustering analysis (37Nei N. Kumar S. Molecular Evolution and Phylogenetics. Oxford University Press, Oxford, United Kingdom2000Google Scholar). The protein sequences of 29 PAPs were aligned using the program ClustalW 1.8 (searchlauncher.bcm.tmc.edu/multi-align/multi-align.html) (36Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (56002) Google Scholar).

For phosphate deprivation of suspension cells, cells grown in phosphate-sufficient liquid medium (1 mm Pi, in the form of NaH2PO4) were collected by vacuum, washed three times using sterile distilled water, and dispersed into the low phosphate liquid medium (0.01 mm Pi). A cell sample was immediately taken as the day 0 control. Further samples were collected at 1, 3, and 5 days later. Control cell samples were also taken at identical points from suspension cells grown in the phosphate-sufficient medium.

Total RNA was extracted from cell and tissue samples using the RNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen). RNA concentrations were determined with the aid of a spectrophotometer (BioPhotometer, Eppendorf AG). Using nucleotide sequence information of the predicted PAPs, PCR primers were synthesized for amplifying cDNAs corresponding to the coding regions of 20 of the 29 predicted PAPs.

A yeast two-hybrid screen using full-length OSBP as bait was undertaken to identify partner proteins that would provide clues to the function of OSBP. This resulted in the cloning of vesicle-associated membrane protein-associated protein-A (VAP-A), a syntaxin-like protein implicated in endoplasmic reticulum (ER)/Golgi vesicle transport, and phospholipid regulation in mammalian cells and yeast, respectively. By using a combination of yeast two-hybrid, glutathione S-transferase pull-down and immunoprecipitation experiments, the VAP-A-binding region in OSBP was localized to amino acids 351–442. This region did not include the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain but overlapped with the N terminus of the oxysterol binding and OSBP homology domains. C- and N-terminal truncations or deletions of VAP prevented interaction with OSBP but did not affect VAP multimerization. Although the OSBP PH domain was not necessary for VAP-A binding in vitro, interaction with VAP-A was enhanced in cells by mutation of the conserved PH domain tryptophan (OSBP W174A) or deletion of the C-terminal half of the PH domain (OSBP Δ132–182). OSBP W174A retained oxysterol binding activity, association with phospholipid vesicles via the PH domain, and localized with VAP in unusual ER-associated structures. At 40 °C, misfolded ts045-vesicular stomatitis virus G protein fused to green fluorescent protein was co-localized with VAP-A/OSBP W174A structures on the ER but was exported to the Golgi when folded normally at 32 °C. A fluorescent ceramide analogue also accumulated in these ER inclusions, and export to the Golgi was partially inhibited as indicated by decreased Golgi staining and a 30% reduction in sphingomyelin synthesis. These studies show that OSBP binding to the ER and Golgi apparatus is regulated by its PH domain and VAP interactions, and the complex is involved at a stage of protein and ceramide transport from the ER.

Initial analysis of the distribution of this gene family suggested that ORPs and OSBP share related functions in cells or have tissue-specific activities. The precise nature of these activities is unclear, but preliminary evidence in yeast and mammalian cells suggests a role in vesicular trafficking and lipid and sterol regulation (3Xu Y. Liu Y.

Cool L. Phillips J. Rine J. Genetics. 2001; 157: 1117-1140Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).OSBP, the first member of the gene family to be characterized, was identified by Kandutsch and Shown (8Kandutsch A.A. Shown E.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 13068-13073Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as a high affinity cytosolic receptor for a variety of oxysterol regulators of cholesterol synthesis, such as 25-hydroxycholesterol. Based on a correlation between the potency of oxysterols to suppress 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase activity and affinity for OSBP, it was proposed that OSBP played a role in mediating the effects of oxysterols on cholesterol homeostasis (9Taylor F.R. Saucier S.E. Shown E.P. Parish E.J. Kandutsch A.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 12382-12387Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cloning and expression studies revealed that OSBP was a soluble protein that underwent translocation from a cytosolic/vesicular compartment to the Golgi apparatus when cells were challenged with exogenous 25-hydroxycholesterol (10Ridgway N.D. Dawson P.A., Ho, Y.K. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 307-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Interaction with the Golgi apparatus has since been shown to involve the OSBP PH domain and is mediated by phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI-4,5-P2) and possibly other unidentified protein or lipid factors (6Lagace T.A. Byers D.M. Cook H.W. Ridgway N.D. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 205-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 11Levine T.P. Munro S. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 729-739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). The interaction of OSBP with the Golgi apparatus via the PH domain is important for function since overexpression of OSBP mutants with deletions of the PH domain did not cause alterations in cholesterol homeostasis that were evident with wild-type protein (6Lagace T.A. Byers D.M. Cook H.W. Ridgway N.D. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 205-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). In a model for oxysterol-mediated translocation, 25-hydroxycholesterol binding to the C-terminal region of OSBP could unmask the PH domain and thus facilitate binding to lipid or protein targets in the Golgi apparatus. Expression of the OSBP PH domain alone was sufficient to disrupt Golgi structure and interfered with transport of vesicular stomatitis virus G (VSVG) protein in the Golgi apparatus (11Levine T.P. Munro S. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 729-739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). This suggests that an unidentified important step(s) in vesicle transport is regulated by OSBP, and this activity either directly or indirectly affects sterol regulation.OSBP also translocated to the Golgi in response to factors other than oxysterols. For instance, depletion of cellular cholesterol with cyclodextrins (12Ridgway N.D. Lagace T.A. Cook H.W. Byers D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31621-31628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), by somatic mutations in CHO cells (13Storey M.K. Byers D.M. Cook H.W. Ridgway N.D. Biochem. J. 1998; 336: 247-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), or the Niemann-Pick C disorder (14Mohammadi A. Perry R.J. Storey M.K. Cook H.W. Byers D.M. Ridgway N.D. J. Lipid Res. 2001; 42: 1062-1071Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) promoted OSBP localization to the Golgi. Because some of these models produced severe cholesterol depletion, it was unlikely that endogenous oxysterol production could account for translocation. Depletion of plasma membrane sphingomyelin (SM) and phosphatidylcholine with bacterial phospholipases also promoted translocation of OSBP to the Golgi apparatus (12Ridgway N.D. Lagace T.A. Cook H.W. Byers D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31621-31628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). This raised the intriguing possibility that OSBP movement is linked to the production of the bioactive lipids ceramide and diglyceride. In yeast, a functional link has been established between diglyceride, phosphatidic acid, and Golgi vesicle biogenesis, mediated by the phosphatidylinositol/phosphatidylcholine transfer protein Sec14p (15Xie Z. Fang M. Rivas M.P. Faulkner A.J. Sternweis P.C. Engebrecht J.A. Bankaitis V.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12346-12351Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 16Kearns B.G.

Deletion of the yeast OSBP homologue 4 (OSH4)KES1 bypassed the requirement forSEC14 in regulation of Golgi vesicular transport, suggesting Osh1p/Kes1p regulates Golgi secretory function in response to these lipids (18Fang M. Kearns B.G. Gedvilaite A. Kagiwada S. Kearns M. Fung M.K. Bankaitis V.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6447-6459Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Although none of the seven yeast OSH-encoded proteins were essential, deletion of the entire gene family was lethal (7Beh C.T. Cool L. Phillips J. Rine J. Genetics. 2001; 157: 1117-1140Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Depletion of all or some combinations of OSH genes was accompanied by perturbations in ergosterol metabolism and membrane function (7Beh C.T. Cool L. Phillips J. Rine J. Genetics. 2001; 157: 1117-1140Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Fang M. Kearns B.G. Gedvilaite A. Kagiwada S. Kearns M. Fung M.K. Bankaitis V.A.

To address this question we undertook the identification of proteins that interact with OSBP using the yeast two-hybrid method. The sole OSBP-binding protein identified in our screen was vesicle-associated membrane protein (VAMP)-associated protein-A (VAP-A), one of a pair (VAP-A and -B) of related integral membrane proteins localized to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)/Golgi pathway (20Skehel P.A. Martin K.C. Kandel E.R. Bartsch D. Science. 1995; 269: 1580-1583Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar,21Soussan L. Burakov D. Daniels M.P. Toister-Achituv M. Porat A. Yarden Y. Elazar Z. J.

Klip A. Trimble W.S. Biochem. J. 1998; 333: 247-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) suggested a role in vesicle transport. In support of this, VAP proteins have been shown to have a number of potential functions related to vesicle transport including regulation of COPI vesicle transport in the ER/Golgi pathway (21Soussan L.

A. 2000; 97: 1101-1106Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) and tight junctions (26Lapierre L.A. Tuma P.L. Navarre J. Goldenring J.R. Anderson J.M. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 3723-3732Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study we define the regions of VAP-A and OSBP that mediate interaction in the Golgi apparatus, and we show that the VAP-A/OSBP interaction in vivo is regulated by the PH domain and involved at a stage of protein and lipid export from the ER.DISCUSSIONBy virtue of its oxysterol binding activity and altered localization and phosphorylation in response to cholesterol levels and transport, OSBP has been implicated in regulation of lipid and sterol homeostasis. This could be the result of interaction with components of the vesicle transport machinery since OSBP localized to the Golgi apparatus in an oxysterol-dependent manner (10Ridgway N.D. Dawson P.A., Ho, Y.K. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 307-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar), and the OSBP PH domain was shown to alter secretory function when expressed in cells (11Levine T.P. Munro S. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 729-739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). In further support of this conclusion, we have shown that OSBP interacts with VAP-A and that OSBP PH domain mutations constitutively interact with VAP in the ER resulting in aberrant compartmentation and export of VSVG and ceramide.VAP-A is a type II integral membrane protein with a large N-terminal domain facing the cytoplasm and a small 4-amino acid C terminus (21Soussan L. Burakov D. Daniels M.P. Toister-Achituv M. Porat A. Yarden Y. Elazar Z. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 301-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). VAP contains three distinctive domains as follows: an 18-amino acid segment proximal to the N terminus that is highly conserved among different species (35Kagiwada S. Hosaka K. Murata M. Nikawa J. Takatsuki A. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 1700-1708Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), a coiled-coil motif, and a transmembrane region at the C terminus. The function of these domains is unknown, but their deletion effectively blocked OSBP binding, but not VAP multimerization, as measured by yeast two-hybrid interaction (Fig. 2) (21Soussan L. Burakov D. Daniels M.P. Toister-Achituv M. Porat A. Yarden Y. Elazar Z. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 301-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, VAP has been implicated in vesicle transport but at precisely which stage is unknown (20Skehel P.A. Martin K.C. Kandel E.R. Bartsch D. Science. 1995; 269: 1580-1583Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 21Soussan L. Burakov D. Daniels M.P. Toister-Achituv M. Porat A. Yarden Y. Elazar Z. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 301-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 24Foster L.J. Weir M.L. Lim D.Y. Liu Z. Trimble W.S. Klip A. Traffic. 2000; 1: 512-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In the case of VAP-B, neutralizing antibodies as well as recombinant VAP-B were shown to inhibit in vitro intra-Golgi transport (21Soussan L. Burakov D. Daniels M.P. Toister-Achituv M. Porat A. Yarden Y. Elazar Z. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 301-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The accumulation of COPI-coated vesicles in the presence of VAP antibody suggested that VAP was involved in the uncoating of vesicles during retrograde transport between the Golgi apparatus and ER. Whether VAMP or another SNARE is involved in these activities is unclear since VAMP and VAP did not co-localize in cells, and reported interactions with other components of the vesicle transport machinery were in vitro (22Weir M.L. Xie H. Klip A. Trimble W.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 286: 616-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar,23Weir M.L. Klip A. Trimble W.S. Biochem. J. 1998; 333: 247-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar).Analysis of OSBP mutants by yeast two-hybrid and GST pull-down assays was used to identify a region between amino acids 351 and 442 that mediated VAP-A binding. This region overlapped with the N terminus of the oxysterol binding domain and included a portion of the OH domain between amino acids 416 and 442 that is shared by all OSBP family members (1Lehto M. Laitinen S. Chinetti G. Johansson M. Ehnholm C. Staels B. Ikonen E. Olkkonen V.M. J. Lipid Res. 2001; 42: 1203-1213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have evidence that two other OSBP family members interact with VAP in yeast two-hybrid assays and by immunoprecipitation thus supporting the concept that the OH region is involved and that VAP is a partner for other OSBP family members.2 The truncation mutant OSBP-(1–442) did not bind oxysterols (10Ridgway N.D. Dawson P.A., Ho, Y.K. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 307-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar), but a similar truncation mutant (OSBP-(1–441)) interacted with GST-VAP, indicating that intact oxysterol binding activity is not necessary for VAP-A binding. In vitro VAP-A/OSBP interaction did not require the PH domain; however, mutations of this domain caused enhanced localization to ER-associated structures in intact cells. A possible explanation for this result is that the PH domain is required for targeting of OSBP to the Golgi apparatus, whereas VAP-A is primarily involved in OSBP interaction at the ER. In support of this concept the isolated OSBP PH localized to the Golgi apparatus in cells and to isolated Golgi membranes in vitro (11Levine T.P. Munro S. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 729-739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). In CHO cells, endogenous VAP co-localized with OSBP in a diffuse reticular network but also in a perinuclear region that could correspond to the Golgi apparatus. When the OSBP PH domain was mutated, it appeared that the VAP-A interaction was dominant, and OSBP was constitutively localized with VAP-A in ER structures. This is not a simple matter of competition for OSBP binding to two receptors since complete deletion of the OSBP PH domain rendered the protein cytoplasmic (6Lagace T.A. Byers D.M. Cook H.W. Ridgway N.D. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 205-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), and the W174A mutant retained binding to PtdIns-4,5-P2, a proposed target in the Golgi. Instead, our results suggest that another unidentified activity associated with the PH domain is involved in stabilizing the interaction with VAP-A. This could be another protein or lipid partner whose affinity is altered by the W174A mutation or truncation of the PH domain. For example RACK1, a WD-40 motif-containing scaffold protein, binds the OSBP PH domain in vitro (38Rodriguez M.M. Ron D. Touhara K. Chen C.H. Mochly-Rosen D. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 13787-13794Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), and the OSBP PH domain is reported to have other phosphatidylinositide ligands (Fig. 7) (37Rameh L.E. Arvidsson A. Carraway III, K.L. Couvillon A.D. Rathbun G. Crompton A. VanRenterghem B. Czech M.P. Ravichandran K.S. Burakoff S.J. Wang D.S. Chen C.S. Cantley L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22059-22066Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). Finally, The OSBP W174A phenotype is not due to misfolding or denaturation of the mutant protein as indicated by retention of the following: 1) VAP-A binding, 2) 25-hydroxycholesterol binding, and 3) interaction of the PH domain mutant with vesicles containing phosphatidylinositides.The finding that fluorescent ceramide accumulated in the VAP/OSBP W174A ER inclusions and SM synthesis was partially suppressed was not unexpected since OSBP and oxysterols have been linked previously to SM metabolism (12Ridgway N.D. Lagace T.A. Cook H.W. Byers D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31621-31628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 45Lagace T.A. Byers D.M. Cook H.W. Ridgway N.D. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 109-116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 46Ridgway N.D. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 1345-1358Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Ceramide and protein transport from the ER appear to involve different pathways (47Yasuda S. Kitagawa H. Ueno M. Ishitani H. Fukasawa M. Nishijima M. Kobayashi S. Hanada K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43994-44002Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 48Fukasawa M. Nishijima M. Hanada K. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 673-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar); thus, it is unclear why ceramide and VSVG would occupy the same compartment in OSBP W174A-expressing cells. It is possible that the primary effect of W174A OSBP expression was on ceramide transport, and VSVG was nonspecifically localized to the distorted ER. Indeed, VSVG was also found in the normal reticular network and exited from VAP/OSBP W174A structures at the permissive temperatures (Fig. 9). This was not the case for C5-DMB-ceramide, which was retained in these structures and appeared to have delayed export to the Golgi apparatus.The appearance and accumulation of misfolded VSVG and ceramide in ER inclusions formed by constitutive interaction between VAP-A and OSBP suggests a role in an ER export or protein maturation pathway. This would occur at a relatively early stage since these complexes did not involve ER export sites (sec31) or the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment (p58). The presence of misfolded VSVG suggests that OSBP/VAP-A is involved in a protein folding pathway; misfolded VSVG was present in the complexes, as were PDI and other soluble luminal chaperones (HSP 90, results not shown). As stated above, VSVG-GFP could be non-specifically concentrated in these structures and not distinguish them from the normal ER. However, a relationship betweenSCS2, the yeast VAP homologue, and the unfolded protein response suggests that mammalian VAP and OSBP could have a related function (49Nikawa J. Murakami A. Esumi E. Hosaka K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1995; 118: 39-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Deletion of SCS2 resulted in inositol auxotrophy above 34 °C, a defect that was rescued by Ino1p overexpression. Genetic interactions between SCS2, phospholipid regulation, and the unfolded protein response were indicated by the rescue of inositol auxotrophy in IRE1/HAC1mutants by Scs2p overexpression (49Nikawa J. Murakami A. Esumi E. Hosaka K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1995; 118: 39-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Ire1p is a transmembrane protein kinase/endoribonuclease that transduces the signals for the unfolded protein response from the ER lumen to the nucleus by assisting in splicing of the HAC1 transcription factor mRNA, resulting in increased protein chaperone expression and lipid synthesis (50Kaufman R.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1211-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (1919) Google Scholar). Increased lipid synthesis could expand the ER to accommodate the increased pool of unfolded proteins. Considering its proposed role in vesicle transport in mammalian cells, SCS2 could affect the unfolded protein response of IRE1 mutants by altering lipid synthesis or export from the ER during a stress response thus leading to the observed phenotypes. It is feasible that the interaction between OSBP and VAP could mediate a similar stress-activated response that affects the export of specific proteins from the ER to the Golgi apparatus. One such stress response could be to oxysterols, which are apoptotic agents (51Miyashita Y. Shirai K. Ito Y. Watanabe J. Urano Y. Murano T. Tomioka H. J. Atheroscler. Thromb. 1997; 4: 73-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) and suppress sterol synthesis. As a specific example, export of the sterol regulatory element-binding protein/sterol regulatory element-binding protein-cleavage activating protein complex from the ER is regulated by oxysterols (52Nohturfft A. Yabe D. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Espenshade P.J. Cell. 2000; 102: 315-323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar), but it is unknown if VAP or OSBPs are involved in this process.Recently, a large scale characterization of yeast multiprotein complexes included analysis of a complex that was isolated using Scs2p as bait (53Gavin A.C. Bosche M. Krause R. Grandi P. Marzioch M. Bauer A. Schultz J. Rick J.M. Michon A.M. Cruciat C.M. Remor M. Hofert C. Schelder M. Brajenovic M. Ruffner H. Merino A. Klein K. Hudak M. Dickson D. Rudi T.

Superti-Furga G. Nature. 2002; 415: 141-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (3974) Google Scholar). This resulted in identification of nine Scs2p interacting components that included Osh1p and Osh2p, members of the yeast OSBP family that contain N-terminal PH and ankyrin domains (7Beh C.T. Cool L. Phillips J. Rine J. Genetics. 2001; 157: 1117-1140Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although precise relationships between members of this complex remain to be determined, it is notable that the complex also contained Opi1p, a negative transcription regulator of inositol metabolism (54Bachhawat N. Ouyang Q. Henry S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25087-25095Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), and Stt4p, a phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase (55Cutler N.S. Heitman J. Cardenas M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27671-27677Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). These findings further confirm that OSBPs and SCS2 are involved at the interface between lipid regulation and the unfolded protein response in yeast, and together with our data demonstrate that interactions between VAP and the ORP family is conserved among species. The presence of multiple OSBP family members that potentially interact with VAP indicates that numerous and related activities could be regulated by this complex. Oxysterol-binding protein (OSBP)1 and 11 other related proteins constitute the recently identified OSBP-related (ORP) gene family. Family members share amino acid sequence identity in a 350-amino acid C-terminal OSBP homology (OH) domain that is encompassed in the oxysterol-binding region of OSBP. Most ORPs also contain an N-terminal pleckstrin homology (PH) domain (1Lehto M. Laitinen S. Chinetti G. Johansson M. Ehnholm C. Staels B. Ikonen E. Olkkonen V.M. J.

https://openalex.org/W2042344678,"Inhibitors of apoptosis (IAPs) inhibit caspases, thereby preventing proteolysis of apoptotic substrates. IAPs occlude the active sites of caspases to which they are bound1,2,3 and can function as ubiquitin ligases. IAPs are also reported to ubiquitinate themselves and caspases4,5. Several proteins induce apoptosis, at least in part, by binding and inhibiting IAPs. Among these are the Drosophila melanogaster proteins Reaper (Rpr), Grim, and HID, and the mammalian proteins Smac/Diablo and Omi/HtrA2, all of which share a conserved amino-terminal IAP-binding motif6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14. We report here that Rpr not only inhibits IAP function, but also greatly decreases IAP abundance. This decrease in IAP levels results from a combination of increased IAP degradation and a previously unrecognized ability of Rpr to repress total protein translation. Rpr-stimulated IAP degradation required both IAP ubiquitin ligase activity and an unblocked Rpr N terminus. In contrast, Rpr lacking a free N terminus still inhibited protein translation. As the abundance of short-lived proteins are severely affected after translational inhibition, the coordinated dampening of protein synthesis and the ubiquitin-mediated destruction of IAPs can effectively reduce IAP levels to lower the threshold for apoptosis."

We have previously demonstrated that PATJ, Pals1, and CRB1 can form a tripartite tight junction complex in epithelial cells and that PATJ recruits Pals1 to tight junctions. Here, we observed that the Pals1/PATJ interaction was not crucial for the ultimate targeting of PATJ itself to tight junctions. This prompted us to examine if any of the 10 post-synaptic density-95/Discs Large/zona occludens-1 (PDZ) domains of PATJ could bind to the carboxyl termini of known tight junction constituents. We found that the 6thand 8th PDZ domains of PATJ can interact with the carboxyl termini of zona occludens-3 (ZO-3) and claudin 1, respectively. PATJ missing the 6th PDZ domain was found to mislocalize away from cell contacts. Surprisingly, deleting the 8th PDZ domain had little effect on PATJ localization.

Furuse M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 13-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar, 2Madara J.L. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1998; 60: 143-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). Substances are transported across epithelia mainly via two mechanisms: the paracellular route, which allow molecules to cross through spaces existing between epithelial cells, and the transcellular route, which involve vectorial transport of molecules through epithelial cells. The latter pathway relies on the demarcation of the apical and basolateral plasma membranes that are composed of distinct proteins and lipids. Tight junctions (TJs)1 are essential for both pathways in that they serve as selective paracellular barriers (“gates”) and “fences” preventing the intermixing of apical and basolateral membrane constituents (3Zahraoui A. Louvard D. Galli T. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: F31-F36Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 4Cereijido M. Valdes J. Shoshani L. Contreras R.G. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1998; 60: 161-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Upon visualization by freeze-fracture electron microscopy, TJs simply appear as a network of continuous, anastomosing fibrils at the apical aspect of cell-cell contacts (5Tsukita S. Furuse M. Genes Cells. 1998; 3: 569-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). However, the number of proteins known to compose TJs has grown considerably making it clear that TJs have a complex molecular architecture (6Mitic L.L. Anderson J.M. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1998; 60: 121-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar, 7Fanning A.S. Mitic L.L. Anderson J.M. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1999; 10: 1337-1345PubMed Google Scholar, 8Lapierre L.A. Adv. Drug Deliv. Rev. 2000; 41: 255-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The first integral membrane protein found to compose TJs was occludin (9Furuse M. Hirase T. Itoh M. Nagafuchi A. Yonemura S. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1777-1788Crossref PubMed Scopus (2073) Google Scholar) and it was initially thought that this protein was responsible for generating TJ fibrils. However, the claudin family of proteins was shown to be directly responsible for forming TJ strands (10Furuse M. Sasaki H. Fujimoto K. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 391-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (763) Google Scholar). Junctional adhesion molecule (JAM) is another integral membrane protein that has been shown to co-localize with occludin and claudins to TJs (11Martin-Padura I. Lostaglio S. Schneemann M. Williams L. Romano M. Fruscella P. Panzeri C. Stoppacciaro A. Ruco L. Villa A. Simmons D. Dejana E. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 117-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (1116) Google Scholar, 12Itoh M. Sasaki H. Furuse M. Ozaki H. Kita T. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 491-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). Although only three distinct classes of integral membrane proteins are known to exist at TJs, many peripheral membrane TJ proteins have been identified (3Zahraoui A. Louvard D. Galli T. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: F31-F36Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 8Lapierre L.A. Adv. Drug Deliv. Rev. 2000; 41: 255-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 13Gonzalez-Mariscal L. Betanzos A. Avila-Flores A. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 11: 315-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). Some of these interact directly with the cytoplasmic carboxyl-terminal tails of occludin, claudins, and/or JAM. For instance, three members of the membrane-associated guanylate kinase (MAGUK) family, ZO-1, ZO-2, and ZO-3, are known to bind the last 150 residues of occludin (14Wittchen E.S. Haskins J. Stevenson B.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35179-35185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar, 15Haskins J., Gu, L. Wittchen E.S. Hibbard J. Stevenson B.R. J.

Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1617-1626Crossref PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar). They also interact via their first PSD-95/Discs Large/ZO-1 (PDZ) domain with the extreme carboxyl termini of claudins, most of which end in YV (17Itoh M. Furuse M. Morita K. Kubota K. Saitou M. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 1351-1363Crossref PubMed Scopus (883) Google Scholar). These MAGUK proteins also interact with the cortical actin cytoskeleton allowing for the tethering of the TJ fibrils to F-actin (7Fanning A.S. Mitic L.L. Anderson J.M. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1999; 10: 1337-1345PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, although the extreme carboxyl terminus of ZO-1 does not conform to any known PDZ binding consensus sequence, ZO-2 and ZO-3 terminate in TEL and TDL, respectively. These carboxyl termini fit the class I PDZ ligand consensus sequence, (S/T)X(V/I/L)-COOH, where Xrepresents any amino acid (18Songyang Z. Fanning A.S., Fu, C., Xu, J. Marfatia S.M. Chishti A.H. Crompton A. Chan A.C. Anderson J.M. Cantley L.C. Science. 1997; 275: 73-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (1209) Google Scholar). To date, there are no reports describing the PDZ domain proteins that interact with the carboxyl termini of ZO-2 and ZO-3. Recently, two TJ complexes involved in the establishment and/or maintenance of epithelial cell polarity have been described (19Tepass U. Tanentzapf G. Ward R. Fehon R. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2001; 35: 747-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). First, the Par-6·ASIP·aPKC complex was shown to be important for the formation of TJs (20Yamanaka T. Horikoshi Y. Suzuki A.

Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 540-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). This complex is conserved inDrosophila (DPar-6/Bazooka/DaPKC) and Caenorhabditis elegans (Par-6/Par-3/aPKC). The other polarity complex consists of the mammalian homologues of Drosophila Stardust, Discs Lost, and Crumbs: Pals1, Pals1-associated tight junction protein (PATJ), and human Crumbs homologue 1 (CRB1), respectively. Fly embryos missing Discs Lost, Stardust, or Crumbs fail to form polarized epithelia during development and fail to progress to adulthood (24Tepass U. Knust E. Dev. Biol. 1993; 159: 311-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 25Bhat M.A. Izaddoost S., Lu, Y. Cho K.O. Choi K.W. Bellen H.J. Cell. 1999; 96: 833-845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). We recently reported that PATJ, Pals1, and CRB1 can form a ternary complex at TJs (26Roh M.H. Makarova O. Liu C. Shin K. Lee S. Laurinec S. Goyal M. Wiggins R. Margolis B. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 161-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). PATJ was isolated based on its ability to bind and recruit the MAGUK protein, Pals1, to TJs. PATJ consists of an amino-terminal MAGUK recruitment (MRE) domain followed by 10 PDZ domains. The MRE domain of PATJ interacts specifically with Pals1 and is directly responsible for targeting Pals1 to TJs (26Roh M.H. Makarova O. Liu C. Shin K. Lee S. Laurinec S. Goyal M. Wiggins R. Margolis B. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 161-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, it was unclear as to the exact domain(s) that contributes to the proper targeting of PATJ itself to TJs. PATJ is a paralogue of multiple PDZ protein 1 (MUPP1), a protein containing a single MRE domain and 13 PDZ domains. Like PATJ, MUPP1 was reported to localize to TJs based on its association with the carboxyl termini of JAM and claudins (27Hamazaki Y. Itoh M. Sasaki H. Furuse M. Tsukita S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 455-461Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Here, we investigate the PDZ domain-based protein interactions between PATJ and known TJ constituents. Furthermore, we extend this analysis to identifying the domains that are responsible for targeting PATJ to TJs. The cloning of full-length PATJ into the pcDNA3.1(−)/HA and pEYFP-N1 vectors has been described previously (26Roh M.H. Makarova O. Liu C. Shin K. Lee S. Laurinec S. Goyal M. Wiggins R. Margolis B. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 161-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). The PATJ open reading frame was amplified by PCR and inserted into the pRK5-Myc vector. The cDNA encoding for PATJ missing its last two or five PDZ domains was also generated by PCR and cloned into both pcDNA3.1(−)/HA and pEYFP-N1. The first 125 residues (encompassing the MRE domain) were deleted from the pEYFP-N1-PATJ construct using a previously described method (28Makarova O. Kamberov E. Margolis B. BioTechniques. 2000; 29: 970-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Internal PDZ domain deletions were generated in the pRK5-Myc-PATJ and pEYFP-N1-PATJ constructs in a similar fashion. Specifically, we deleted residues 1065–1156 (PATJΔPDZ6), 1239–1315 (PATJΔPDZ7), and 1432–1522 (PATJΔPDZ8). The DNA encoding the regions of PATJ encompassing the 6th through 7th and the 8th through 10th PDZ domains (PDZ6-PDZ7 and PDZ8-PDZ10, respectively) were generated by PCR and inserted into pRK5-Myc. The EYFP-PATJ mutant constructs were used to study the targeting of PATJ mutants in MDCK cells. The full-length and mutant HA-PATJ and Myc-PATJ constructs were used to transiently express the various PATJ proteins in HEK293 cells for use in in vitro binding studies. The pGSTag and pET15b vectors were used to express GST- and His6-tagged fusion proteins in BL21 bacterial cells, respectively. Constructs encoding for GST fused to the last 20 amino acids of human paracellin-1/claudin-16 (PCLN-1), ZO-2, ZO-3, JAM, and mouse claudin 1 were made using a previously described method (29Straight S.W. Chen L. Karnak D. Margolis B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1329-1340Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). DNA encoding the first 181 amino acids of Pals1 was generated by PCR and cloned into the pGSTag vector. The DNA encoding residues 1–238 of PATJ was cloned into both pET15b and pGSTag. Finally, the carboxyl-terminal vesicular stomatitis viral G protein (VSVG)-tagged ZO-3 cDNA was subcloned from the pBK-CMV-ZO3 plasmid (a gift from Erika Wittchen and Bruce Stevenson) into pRK5-Myc usingBamHI and XbaI sites. To remove the VSVG epitope tag, the pBK-CMV-ZO3 plasmid was digested with XhoI andXbaI. This removes ∼100 bp at the 3′ end of the ZO3-VSVG plasmid insert. Two complementary oligos, 5′-TCGAGATGTGGAGTCCTCCGATGA GGACGGCTATGACTGGGGACCAGCAACAGACCTGTAAT-3′ and 5′-CTAGATTACAGGTCTGTTGCTGGTCCCCAGTCATAGCCGTCCTCATCGGAGGACTCCACATC-3′ were annealed and subsequently ligated into the digested pBK-CMV-ZO3 plasmid. The non-tagged ZO-3 cDNA in the resulting construct was also subcloned into pRK5-Myc using BamHI andXbaI restriction sites. The sequences of the inserts in all plasmid constructs were verified by automated sequencing at the University of Michigan DNA Sequencing Core. The affinity purification of rabbit polyclonal antibodies directed against Pals1 has been described previously (26Roh M.H. Makarova O. Liu C. Shin K. Lee S. Laurinec S. Goyal M. Wiggins R. Margolis B. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 161-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). These antibodies were used at 1:500 dilution for immunoblotting experiments. For generation of anti-PATJ antisera, rabbits were injected with a GST-PATJ-(1–238) fusion protein. Anti-PATJ antibodies were affinity purified using an Affi-Gel 10 column (Bio-Rad) previously coupled to His6-tagged PATJ-(1–238). The anti-Myc mouse monoclonal antibody (9E10) was used at 1:1,000 dilution for immunoblotting experiments. The mouse anti-hemagglutinin (HA) monoclonal antibody (clone 12CA5), obtained from Roche Molecular Biochemicals, was used for immunoblotting. For immunoprecipitation and immunoblot detection of EYFP fusion proteins, rabbit polyclonal and mouse monoclonal anti-EYFP antibodies (CLONTECH) were used, respectively. Mouse monoclonal anti-ZO1 antibodies used for immunostaining were obtained from Zymed Laboratories Inc. Mouse monoclonal anti-ZO-3 antibodies (Chemicon) were used in immunostaining and immunoprecipitation experiments. Finally, secondary antibodies conjugated to Alexa Fluor 488, 594, and 647 were purchased from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR). MDCK and HEK293 cells were grown and propagated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 2 mml-glutamine, and 10% fetal bovine serum. FuGENE 6 was used according to the manufacturer's instructions to transfect MDCK and HEK293 cells. 48 h after transfection, HEK293 cells were harvested in Triton lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1.5 mmMgCl2, and 1 mm EGTA) supplemented with 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin. MDCK cells were split into and grown in selection media containing 600 μg/ml G418. MDCK clones expressing the various EYFP-PATJ fusion proteins were isolated and propagated in medium containing 300 μg/ml G418. For immunostaining experiments, wild type MDCK cells and stable MDCK clones were seeded at high confluency onto Transwell membrane filters (0.4-μm pore size; Corning Costar Corp.) and grown for 3–5 days. Immunostaining was performed as described previously (26Roh M.H. Makarova O. Liu C. Shin K. Lee S. Laurinec S. Goyal M. Wiggins R. Margolis B. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 161-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar, 29Straight S.W. Chen L. Karnak D. Margolis B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1329-1340Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Briefly, MDCK cells grown on filters were fixed in 4% formaldehyde/PBS for 15–20 min, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100/PBS, and blocked with 2% goat serum/PBS. Filters were then excised from their plastic casing and incubated with primary antibodies in 2% goat serum/PBS (rabbit anti-PATJ at 1:100, mouse anti-ZO-1 at 1:1000, and mouse anti-ZO-3 at 1:200) overnight at 30 °C in a humidified chamber. After extensive washes with 2% goat serum/PBS, filters were incubated with fluorochrome-conjugated secondary antibody (at 1:1,000 dilution in 2% goat serum/PBS) for 1–2 h at 30 °C. Subsequently, filters were washed several times with 2% goat serum/PBS and mounted on glass slides with ProLong antifade reagent (Molecular Probes, Inc.). Immunofluorescence microscopy was performed at the University of Michigan Morphology and Image Analysis Laboratory with a Zeiss LSM510 Axiovert 100M inverted confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss, Inc., Thornwood, NY). GST pull-down and immunoprecipitation experiments were performed as described previously (30Kamberov E. Makarova O. Roh M. Liu A. Karnak D. Straight S. Margolis B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11425-11431Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Briefly 5 μg of GST fusion proteins or 5 μg of antibody (immobilized on glutathione-agarose or Protein A-Sepharose beads, respectively) were incubated overnight at 4 °C with 293 or MDCK cell lysates. Precipitated proteins were washed 3 times with cold PBS supplemented with 10% glycerol, eluted with sample buffer, and resolved on 4–12% gradient bis-Tris gels using the NuPAGE electrophoresis system (Invitrogen). Proteins were electrophoretically transferred from the gels onto nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were blocked in 5% bovine serum albumin/TBS for 30 min and then incubated with primary antibody in 5% bovine serum albumin/TBS for 2 h at room temperature. After extensive washing with 0.1% Triton X-100/TBS, membranes were soaked in TBS supplemented with 5% skim milk and secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase. Incubation with secondary antibody was performed for 1 h at room temperature or 4 h at 4 °C. Membranes were washed with 0.1% Triton X-100/TBS and bands were visualized using ECL reagent (AmershamBiosciences). Recently, we isolated and identified a novel multiple PDZ domain protein, PATJ, as a binding partner for Pals1 in MDCK cells (26Roh M.H. Makarova O. Liu C. Shin K. Lee S. Laurinec S. Goyal M. Wiggins R. Margolis B. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 161-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). PATJ contains 10 PDZ domains in tandem (Fig.1A) and is a paralogue of MUPP1 that contains 13 PDZ domains. PATJ is the orthologue of Discs Lost, a Drosophila polarity protein containing 4 PDZ domains (25Bhat M.A. Izaddoost S., Lu, Y. Cho K.O. Choi K.W. Bellen H.J. Cell. 1999; 96: 833-845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). PATJ and MUPP1 contain single amino-terminal MRE domains that are capable of binding to the L27N domain of Pals1. Discs Lost also contains an MRE domain that binds to the single L27 domain of the Pals1 orthologue, Stardust (26Roh M.H. Makarova O. Liu C. Shin K. Lee S. Laurinec S. Goyal M. Wiggins R. Margolis B. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 161-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). MUPP1 was previously shown to localize to TJs in MDCK cells (27Hamazaki Y. Itoh M. Sasaki H. Furuse M. Tsukita S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 455-461Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Likewise, we also demonstrated by confocal microscopy that an EYFP-PATJ fusion protein expressed in MDCK cells targets to TJs (26Roh M.H. Makarova O. Liu C. Shin K. Lee S. Laurinec S. Goyal M. Wiggins R. Margolis B. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 161-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). We first sought to verify the subcellular localization of endogenous PATJ in polarized MDCK cells. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies were raised against GST fused to the first 238 amino acids of PATJ. Previously, we showed that this antibody could recognize endogenous PATJ in MDCK cell lysates (26Roh M.H. Makarova O. Liu C. Shin K. Lee S. Laurinec S. Goyal M. Wiggins R. Margolis B. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 161-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). Here, we performed immunostaining experiments using this antibody on fixed, permeabilized MDCK cells. Confocal microscopy revealed that endogenous PATJ localizes to TJs (Fig.1B). The MRE domain of PATJ is responsible for targeting Pals1 to the TJ. We next wondered if the association between PATJ and Pals1 was important for localizing PATJ itself to TJs. To address this issue, we expressed an EYFP-PATJ mutant protein missing the MRE domain (EYFP-PATJΔMRE) in MDCK cells. This protein still localized to TJs albeit with decreased efficiency (Fig.2A). As predicted, we could show in MDCK cells that full-length EYFP-PATJ could co-immunoprecipitate with endogenous Pals1 (Fig. 2B), which was previously shown to appear as a ∼70-kDa doublet on immunoblots (26Roh M.H. Makarova O. Liu C. Shin K. Lee S. Laurinec S. Goyal M. Wiggins R. Margolis B. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 161-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). In contrast, EYFP-PATJΔMRE failed to bind Pals1. In Fig.2B, there was a slight upward shift in mobilities of the proteins in the immunoprecipitated (“IP”) lanes relative to those in the “Input” lanes. However, we have consistently observed these molecular weight shifts when immunoprecipitating other proteins and resolving them using the NuPAGE electrophoresis system. Thus, we believe that the mobility shifts of the immunoprecipitated proteins in Fig. 2B represent artifacts attributable to the NuPAGE bis-Tris gels. Given the above results, we deduced that the PATJ/Pals1 interaction most likely contributes to the stability of PATJ at TJs but is not crucial for ultimately targeting PATJ to TJs. Deleting the MRE domain of PATJ did not completely affect the localization of PATJ to TJs. Thus, we hypothesized that one or more of the PDZ domains were involved in targeting PATJ to TJs. We examined the extreme carboxyl termini of known TJ constituents to search for TJ proteins that could bind class I or class II PDZ domains. Those with PDZ binding consensus sequences were shown in Fig.3A. The carboxyl termini of ZO-2, ZO-3, and PCLN-1 (claudin 16) are predicted to bind class I PDZ domains, nonetheless, the PDZ proteins that bind to them remain elusive. On the other hand, the carboxyl terminus of JAM interacts with class II PDZ domains present in proteins such as CASK/mLin-2, ZO-1, AF-6, and ASIP/Par-3 (12Itoh M. Sasaki H. Furuse M. Ozaki H. Kita T. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 491-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar, 31Ebnet K. Suzuki A. Horikoshi Y. Hirose T. Meyer Zu Brickwedde M.K. Ohno S. Vestweber D.

Chem. 2001; 276: 9291-9296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). To determine whether any of these four proteins could associate with PATJ via their carboxyl termini, we fused the last 20 residues of each protein onto GST and the resulting GST fusion proteins were used inin vitro binding experiments. GST fused to the carboxyl terminus of ZO-3 (GST-ZO-3) interacted with PATJ (Fig. 3B). However, the carboxyl termini of ZO-2, PCLN-1, and JAM clearly failed to pull down PATJ. We could also show that PATJ binds to a GST-Pals1-(1–181) fusion protein which contains the L27N domain of Pals1 (positive control). Next, we sought to narrow down the region of PATJ that could bind to the ZO-3 tail. We expressed truncated versions of PATJ in 293 cells and investigated whether any of these mutants could bind GST-ZO-3. Deleting the last two PDZ domains of PATJ does not abolish binding to the ZO-3 tail. However, PATJ missing its last five PDZ domains fails to interact with the carboxyl terminus of ZO-3 (Fig.4A). We then wondered if these two truncated PATJ mutants localized to sites of cell contacts. EYFP-PATJΔPDZ (9Furuse M. Hirase T. Itoh M. Nagafuchi A. Yonemura S. Tsukita S. J.

Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 391-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (763) Google Scholar), was observed to localize to cell adhesions (Fig. 4B). This suggests that PATJ might be recruited to the TJ through its association with ZO-3 and that the region encompassing the 6th through 8th PDZ domain of PATJ may mediate this targeting. The above data alone do not provide unequivocal evidence for the notion that the ZO-3/PATJ interaction involves PDZ domains. To better understand the nature of the ZO-3/PATJ association, we sought to determine whether the last three residues (TDL) of ZO-3 were necessary for ZO-3 to bind PATJ. Whereas GST-ZO-3 could interact with PATJ, GST-ZO-3 missing its last three amino acids (GST-ZO-3ΔTDL) could not (Fig.5A). Based on Fig.4A, we suspected that the 6th, 7th, or 8th PDZ domain of PATJ represented the binding site for the extreme carboxyl terminus of ZO-3. Therefore, we individually deleted each of these three PDZ domains and repeated the in vitro binding assay with GST-ZO-3 and GST-ZO-3ΔTDL beads. As expected, GST-ZO-3ΔTDL beads failed to pull down any of the PATJ deletion mutants. GST-ZO-3 interacted with both Myc-PATJΔPDZ7 and Myc-PATJΔPDZ8 but not with Myc-PATJΔPDZ6 (Fig. 5B). While this study was in progress, it was shown that the carboxyl-terminal YV sequence of claudin 1 (and presumably many other members of the claudin family) was crucial for the ability of this protein to bind the 10th PDZ domain of MUPP1 (27Hamazaki Y. Itoh M. Sasaki H. Furuse M. Tsukita S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 455-461Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). This domain of MUPP1 is highly similar in sequence to the 8thPDZ domain of PATJ. In fact, these respective PDZ domains represent the region of the highest amino acid sequence identity between MUPP1 and PATJ (26Roh M.H. Makarova O. Liu C. Shin K. Lee S. Laurinec S. Goyal M. Wiggins R. Margolis B. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 161-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). As the claudin 1 carboxyl terminus was shown to interact with MUPP1, we could also demonstrate that a GST-claudin 1 fusion protein (GST-CLDN1) binds PATJ (Fig.5A). As expected, the GST-CLDN1 missing the last two amino acids (GST-CLDN1ΔYV) failed to interact with PATJ. To further characterize the interaction between PATJ and claudin 1, we performed GST-CLDN1 pull downs with Myc-PATJΔPDZ6, Myc-PATJΔPDZ7, and Myc-PATJΔPDZ8. The GST-CLDN1 fusion protein bound both Myc-PATJΔPDZ6 and Myc-PATJΔPDZ7 but failed to interact with Myc-PATJΔPDZ8 (Fig. 5C). We also investigated the binding between the carboxyl termini of ZO-3 and claudin 1 and two short fragments of PATJ: PDZ6-PDZ7 and PDZ8-PDZ10. We again observed that the tails of ZO-3 and claudin 1 associate with PATJ at distinct sites as GST-ZO-3 could only bind to a PDZ6-PDZ7 containing fragment and GST-CLDN1 could only pull down a fragment of PATJ containing PDZ8-PDZ10 (Fig. 5D). As expected, both GST-ZO-3ΔTDL and GST-CLDN1ΔYV did not significantly interact with either of the two PATJ fragments. Therefore, we conclude that the extreme carboxyl termini of ZO-3 and claudin 1 interact with the 6th and 8th PDZ domains of PATJ, respectively. In Fig.4B, we show that the region of PATJ encompassing the 6th through 8th PDZ domain was important for the recruitment of PATJ to cell contacts. Upon closer examination of the data in Fig. 5, we noticed that the interaction between GST-CLDN1 and PATJ was weaker than that between GST-ZO-3 and PATJ. However, the relative affinities observed in these in vitro pull-down assays may not accurately reflect the true affinities between these proteins in vivo. Thus, we wanted to determine the degree to which the 6th, 7th, and 8th PDZ domains each contributed to the targeting of PATJ. We individually deleted these three PDZ domains from EYFP-PATJ and expressed the resulting deletion mutants in MDCK cells. EYFP-PATJ missing the 6th PDZ domain was predominantly mislocalized from cell contacts (Fig. 6). This was observed in several clones expressing this protein (results not shown). However, EYFP-PATJ missing the 7th PDZ domain still co-localized with ZO-1 to TJs. Surprisingly, deleting the 8th PDZ domain, which binds to the carboxyl terminus of claudin 1, had little effect on the targeting of the EYFP-PATJΔPDZ8 protein to TJs (Fig.6). These results suggest that the interaction between claudin 1 and PATJ may be dispensable in the targeting of PATJ to TJs, whereas that between ZO-3 and PATJ may be crucial for properly localizing PATJ to TJs. To determine whether full-length ZO-3 could form a complex with full-length PATJ, we performed reciprocal co-immunoprecipitation experiments on lysates derived from 293 cells expressing Myc-ZO-3 and Myc-PATJ. Anti-ZO-3 monoclonal antibodies and anti-PATJ antisera were used to immunoprecipitate Myc-ZO-3 and Myc-PATJ, respectively. On the other hand, the anti-Myc monoclonal antibody was used to simultaneously detect both proteins. We observed that PATJ indeed co-precipitates with ZO-3 (Fig.7A). As a negative control, the identical co-immunoprecipitations were carried out using 293 lysates containing Myc-PATJ and Myc-ZO-3 containing a carboxyl-terminal VSVG epitope tag (denoted as Myc-ZO-3vsvg). The VSVG tag masks the extreme carboxyl-terminal PDZ binding TDL sequence of ZO-3. Hence, Myc-ZO-3vsvg was not expected to bind the PDZ domains. As predicted, the Myc-ZO-3vsvg protein failed to co-immunoprecipitate with Myc-PATJ (Fig. 7A). Finally, we were able to demonstrate that endogenous PATJ and ZO-3 co-localize to TJs in an MDCK epithelial monolayer (Fig. 7B). Collectively, our results indicate that ZO-3 binds to the 6th PDZ domain of PATJ via its extreme carboxyl terminus. This interaction is likely important for recruiting PATJ and its binding partners such as Pals1 to TJs (Fig.8).Figure 8Model depicting the interaction of the PATJ·Pals1·Crumbs complex with TJ constituents in epithelial cells. The 6th PDZ domain of PATJ interacts with the extreme carboxyl-terminal TDL sequence of ZO-3. The 8th PDZ domain of PATJ binds to the carboxyl termini of members of the claudin family which end in the YV sequence. The 1st PDZ domain of ZO-3, as well as ZO-1 and ZO-2 (not shown), also interacts with the carboxyl-terminal YV sequence of claudins (26Roh M.H. Makarova O. Liu C. Shin K. Lee S. Laurinec S. Goyal M. Wiggins R. Margolis B. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 161-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). The L27N domain of the MAGUK protein, Pals1, binds to the amino-terminal MRE domain of PATJ. In addition, the single PDZ domain of Pals1 binds to the extreme carboxyl-terminal ERLI sequence of the integral membrane protein, Crumbs. It was previously shown that PATJ, Pals1, and Crumbs co-localize to TJs (26Roh M.H. Makarova O. Liu C. Shin K. Lee S. Laurinec S. Goyal M. Wiggins R. Margolis B. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 161-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar).

Makarova O. Liu C. Shin K. Lee S. Laurinec S. Goyal M. Wiggins R. Margolis B. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 161-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). PATJ contains an amino-terminal MRE domain that mediates the interaction between PATJ and Pals1. Whereas this interaction was crucial for properly targeting Pals1 to TJs, we observed that this was not the case for PATJ (Fig. 2A). In addition, PATJ contains 10 tandemly arranged PDZ domains whose ligands were unknown. We hypothesized that one or more of these PDZ domains conferred the ability of PATJ to localize to TJs. Here, we have identified ZO-3 and claudin 1 as ligands for the 6th and 8th PDZ domains of PATJ, respectively. Because many claudin family members terminate in the YV carboxyl-terminal sequence, it seems likely that other claudins also bind to the 8th PDZ domain of PATJ in epithelial cells. MUPP1, a paralogue of PATJ, was also shown to localize to TJs in MDCK cells (27Hamazaki Y. Itoh M. Sasaki H. Furuse M. Tsukita S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 455-461Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). MUPP1 contains 13 PDZ domains in tandem and JAM and claudin 1 were identified as binding partners for the 9th and 10th PDZ domains of MUPP1, respectively. The expression of JAM in non-polarized L cell fibroblasts, which lack endogenous claudins and other cell adhesion molecules, was sufficient for recruiting exogenously expressed MUPP1 to the plasma membrane. This suggests that in polarized epithelial cells, the JAM/MUPP1 interaction may be sufficient for and that the claudin/MUPP1 interaction may not be crucial for recruiting MUPP1 to TJs. Here, we find that in contrast to MUPP1, PATJ does not bind to the extreme carboxyl terminus of JAM. Similar to MUPP1, we observe that PATJ can indeed bind the tail of claudin 1. Furthermore, the 8th PDZ domain of PATJ, which was highly similar in sequence to the 10th PDZ domain of MUPP1, was shown to mediate this interaction. Nonetheless, we found that claudin 1/PATJ association does not contribute to the targeting of PATJ to TJs as PATJ that was missing the 8th PDZ domain still localizes properly to TJs. Deleting the 6thPDZ domain of PATJ, the binding site for the ZO-3 carboxyl terminus, abolishes the targeting of PATJ to TJs. This suggests that the ZO-3/PATJ interaction could be responsible for recruiting PATJ to TJs. The converse, however, was not true considering that the amino-terminal half of ZO-3, which lacks the Src homology 3 domain, guanylate kinase-like domain, and the extreme carboxyl terminus, localizes to TJs (15Haskins J., Gu, L. Wittchen E.S. Hibbard J. Stevenson B.R. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 199-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). It should also be noted that the 6th PDZ domain of PATJ is a class I PDZ domain (34Vaccaro P. Brannetti B. Montecchi-Palaizz L. Philipp S. Citterich M.H. Cesareni G. Dente L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42122-42130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Our observation that the extreme carboxyl-terminal TDL sequence of ZO-3 binds this PDZ domain was consistent with that notion. The PATJ·Pals1·Crumbs and Discs Lost·Stardust·Crumbs complexes exist just superior to adherens junctions in mammalian andDrosophila epithelia, respectively (19Tepass U. Tanentzapf G. Ward R. Fehon R. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2001; 35: 747-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar, 26Roh M.H. Makarova O. Liu C. Shin K. Lee S. Laurinec S. Goyal M. Wiggins R. Margolis B. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 161-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). The localization of the latter complex to the subapical complex (SAC) was shown to be crucial for establishment and maintenance of polarity in ectodermally derived epithelia (25Bhat M.A. Izaddoost S., Lu, Y. Cho K.O. Choi K.W. Bellen H.J. Cell. 1999; 96: 833-845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar, 35Bachmann A. Schneider M. Theilenberg E. Grawe F. Knust E.

Skaer H. Development. 1996; 122: 951-959PubMed Google Scholar). In fly embryos lacking Stardust expression, Discs Lost fails to localize to the SAC in epithelial cells established during cellularization (35Bachmann A. Schneider M. Theilenberg E. Grawe F. Knust E. Nature. 2001; 414: 638-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). In these embryos, Crumbs also fails to localize properly (36Hong Y. Stronach B. Perrimon N. Jan L.Y. Jan Y.N. Nature. 2001; 414: 634-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Therefore, Stardust seems to be required for the proper recruitment of Crumbs and Discs Lost to the SAC. In contrast, we find that while the PATJ/Pals1 interaction was necessary for targeting Pals1 to TJs, it does not seem to be crucial for localizing PATJ itself to TJs. In agreement with the Drosophila studies, we have also observed that Crumbs targeting was dependent on its interaction with Pals1. 2M. Roh and B. Margolis, unpublished data. Therefore, in mammalian epithelia, it appears that the individual components of the PATJ·Pals1·Crumbs complex could be recruited to TJs in sequential fashion. Specifically, ZO-3 may function to recruit PATJ to TJs and in turn PATJ targets Pals1 and Crumbs to TJs. Interestingly, the Drosophila SAC has been compared with mammalian TJs because several homologues of known TJ proteins such as Par-6, aPKC, and ASIP (DPar-6, DaPKC, and Bazooka, respectively) were known to localize to the SAC (19Tepass U. Tanentzapf G. Ward R. Fehon R. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2001; 35: 747-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). Because these three proteins were shown to play a crucial role in the biogenesis of TJs, the SAC likely represents the region of the plasma membrane where TJs will form. It should still be noted that no claudin, occludin, ZO-2, or ZO-3 homologues have been shown to exist within the SAC. The ZO-1 homologue, Polychaetoid (Pyd), has been recently reported to exist as two isoforms, one of which localizes to adherens junctions and the other that displays a broader plasma membrane localization (39Wei X. Ellis H.M. Mech. Dev. 2001; 100: 217-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, the precise relationship between Pyd and the SAC, if there is any, remains unclear. Neither the carboxyl termini of ZO-1 nor Pyd are predicted to bind PDZ domains. Collectively, it is tempting to speculate that the presence of additional PDZ domains in PATJ, relative to Discs Lost, correlates with its localization to TJs in mammalian epithelia. Previously, it was reported that the Par-6·ASIP·aPKC polarity complex was recruited to TJs possibly through the association of the ASIP PDZ domain and the extreme carboxyl terminus of JAM. Here, we have provided insight as to how the PATJ·Pals1·Crumbs polarity complex is localized to TJs as two of the 10 PDZ domains of PATJ were shown to interact with ZO-3 and claudin 1. It will be interesting to identify the proteins that bind to the other eight PATJ PDZ domains. Surely, this will shed more light on how the PATJ·Pals1·Crumbs complex may function and add to the growing list of molecules that contribute to the complex molecular architecture of TJs in mammalian epithelial cells.

https://openalex.org/W2061156310,"Our previous results run counter to the hypothesis that S-nitrosohemoglobin (SNO-Hb) serves as anin vivo reservoir for NO from which NO release is allosterically linked to oxygen release. We show here that SNO-Hb undergoes reductive decomposition in erythrocytes, whereas it is stable in purified solutions and in erythrocyte lysates treated with an oxidant such as ferricyanide. Using an extensively validated methodology that eliminates background nitrite and stabilizes erythrocyte S-nitrosothiols, we find the levels of SNO-Hb in the basal human circulation, including red cell membrane fractions, were 46 ± 17 nm in human arterial erythrocytes and 69 ± 11 nm in venous erythrocytes, incompatible with the postulated reservoir function of SNO-Hb. Moreover, we performed experiments on human red blood cells in which we elevated the levels of SNO-Hb to 10,000 times the normal in vivo levels. The elevated levels of intra-erythrocytic SNO-Hb fell rapidly, independent of oxygen tension and hemoglobin saturation. Most of the NO released during this process was oxidized to nitrate. A fraction (25%) was exported as S-nitrosothiol, but this fraction was not increased at low oxygen tensions that favor the deoxy (T-state) conformation of Hb. Results of these studies show that, within the redox-active erythrocyte environment, the β-globin cysteine 93 is maintained in a reduced state, necessary for normal oxygen affinity, and incapable of oxygen-linked NO storage and delivery. Our previous results run counter to the hypothesis that S-nitrosohemoglobin (SNO-Hb) serves as anin vivo reservoir for NO from which NO release is allosterically linked to oxygen release. We show here that SNO-Hb undergoes reductive decomposition in erythrocytes, whereas it is stable in purified solutions and in erythrocyte lysates treated with an oxidant such as ferricyanide.

Although it is generally believed that endothelium-derived NO is the primary determinant of NO-mediated control of basal blood flow in humans (4Gladwin M.T. Shelhamer J.H. Schechter A.N. Pease-Fye M.E. Waclawiw M.A. Panza J.A. Ognibene F.P. Cannon III, R.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 11482-11487Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar, 5Cannon III, R.O.

Such molecules include high and low molecular weight S-nitrosothiols in plasma (6Stamler J.S. Jaraki O. Osborne J. Simon D.I. Keaney J. Vita J. Singel D. Valeri C.R. Loscalzo J. Proc. Natl. Acad.

In addition, NO reacts reversibly with hemoglobin to form an NO-heme adduct, iron-nitrosyl-hemoglobin (HbFeIINO),1 and can also nitrosate a surface thiol on cysteine 93 of the β-globin chain to form S-nitrosohemoglobin (SNO-Hb). The potential role of S-nitrosated hemoglobin as an NO transporter is particularly appealing, because the environment of β-cysteine 93 is sensitive to the R ↔ T conformational equilibrium of hemoglobin. The conformational transition from the R- to T-state could thus promote the allosteric delivery of both oxygen and NO to regions with low oxygen tension. Two central observations supporting this SNO-Hb hypothesis are reports of observed arterial-venous gradients of SNO-Hb in the rat (suggesting a dynamic cycle) and evidence that delivery of oxygen and NO are allosterically coupled events (12Jia L. Bonaventura C. Bonaventura J. Stamler J.S. Nature. 1996; 380: 221-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (1480) Google Scholar, 13Stamler J.S. Jia L., Eu, J.P. McMahon T.J. Demchenko I.T. Bonaventura J.

However, the evidence for a dynamic cycle is brought into question by widely varying reports for the basal levels of intracellular SNO-Hb in arterial and venous blood. The reported levels vary from 200 nm to 5 μm. These levels were determined using a variety of different assays, mostly based on photolysis or chemically mediated release of NO gas and subsequent detection by the ozone-based chemiluminescent analyzer (8Gladwin M.T. Ognibene F.P. Pannell L.K. Nichols J.S. Pease-Fye M.E. Shelhamer J.H. Schechter A.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9943-9948Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 9Jourd'heuil D.

We have developed methodologies to selectively oxidize the NO first from iron-nitrosyl-hemoglobin followed by reduction of the S-NO bond from hemoglobin in solutions of I3−, releasing NO gas from the cysteine for ozone-based chemiluminescent detection (4Gladwin M.T.

In addition to liberating NO gas from both S-nitrosothiols and iron-nitrosyls, both systems reduce nitrite to NO, requiring extensive treatment of samples through molecular sizing columns. However, hemoglobin possesses anion binding sites that may retain nitrite, raising concerns that the measured NO levels may be overestimated as a result of conversion of hemoglobin-bound nitrite to NO (17Imai K. Imai K. Allosteric Effects in Haemoglobin. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, United Kingdom1982: 39-45Google Scholar). In addition, there have been a number of challenges to the second core principle of the SNO-Hb hypothesis, that NO is released during the oxygen-linked conformational shift of hemoglobin from its R- to T-state. Although both kinetic and thermodynamic arguments have been made to support the allosterically mediated release of NO from SNO-Hb (12Jia L. Bonaventura C. Bonaventura J. Stamler J.S. Nature. 1996; 380: 221-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (1480) Google Scholar, 14Gow A.J. Stamler J.S. Nature. 1998; 391: 169-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar, 16McMahon T.J. Exton Stone A.

In the present studies we present a methodology for the stabilization SNO-Hb in red cell lysates, the elimination of all background nitrite signal, and the specific detection of SNO-Hb in human blood down to 5 nm concentration (0.00005% SNO/heme). Very low levels of SNO-Hb were found in both arterial and venous erythrocytes with this improved detection method, and no significant arterial-venous gradients were observed. To evaluate the allosteric properties of SNO-Hb within intact erythrocytes, we modified human red cells so that they contained up to 10,000 times the normal in vivo levels of SNO-Hb and evaluated the effects of hemoglobin oxygen saturation on its levels and on NO export. In these experiments we found that, within the redox-active erythrocyte environment, the β-globin cysteine 93 is maintained in a reduced state, which may be necessary for normal oxygen affinity, and that SNO-Hb is rapidly degraded independent of hemoglobin oxygen saturation. The reductive decomposition of SNO-Hb in the erythrocytes provides an explanation for why SNO-Hb levels in human blood are low. Because the lifetime of SNO-Hb in erythrocytes is both transient and insensitive to oxygen tension, its participation in NO storage, delivery, and regulation of human blood flow under normal physiological conditions appears unlikely. It remains possible that SNO-Hb may participate in NO-dependent events in vivo during pathological conditions associated with red cell oxidation or under circumstances where NO generation is increased in response to infection or pharmacological NO treatment. All protocols were approved by the Institutional Review Board of the NHLBI (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD) following formal scientific review. All subjects signed an informed consent. All chemicals and NO gas, unless otherwise stated, were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. Hemolysates of cells containing native human hemoglobin (Hb A0) were used to prepare purified Hb by the ammonium sulfate method with chromatographic purification with a fast protein liquid chromatography system. Pure red cell lysates from freshly obtained venous or arterial blood were used when indicated. S-Nitrosothiol reagents were prepared by reaction of the acidified amino acid with nitrite, neutralized to pH 7.4 using 5 n NaOH and measured by both the I3− (22Samouilov A. Zweier J.L. Anal. Biochem. 1998; 258: 322-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) and Cu+/l-cysteine (7Fang K. Ragsdale N.V. Carey R.M. MacDonald T. Gaston B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 252: 535-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) chemiluminescence assays, and compared with SNO-glutathione (Calbiochem) and nitrite standards. Oxyhemoglobin was equilibrated in 2% borate buffer at pH 9.2 or in PBS at pH 7.4, temperature 4 °C, and then treated with S-nitrosocysteine at a ratio of 10:1 (CysNO to heme) for 30 min, followed by extensive dialysis or Sephadex G25 desalting (8Gladwin M.T. Ognibene F.P. Pannell L.K. Nichols J.S. Pease-Fye M.E. Shelhamer J.H. Schechter A.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9943-9948Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 18Bonaventura C.

Methods Enzymol. 1999; 301: 99-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Human and bovine albumin (Sigma; 40 mg/ml with 0.5 μm EDTA in PBS) was reduced with dithiothreitol (3–5 mm); passed through Sephadex G25 columns to remove dithiothreitol, nitrite, and small thiols; and incubated with S-nitrosocysteine (final concentration at 2 mm) for 30 min at room temperature in the dark to form SNO-albumin. This solution was then dialyzed at 4 °C against 3 × 3 liters of 0.5 μm diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA) in PBS for 24 h. Whole blood was collected from normal volunteers in EDTA followed by an overnight incubation in room air with a 10% volume of 100 ml of phosphate-buffered saline with citrate, dextrose, and adenine (CPD-A solution; Baxter, Covina, CA). Blood samples were centrifuged at 750 × g for 5 min and adjusted to a 50% hematocrit by removal of small amounts of plasma. To elevate intra-erythrocytic SNO-Hb levels, S-nitrosocysteine (10 mm final concentration) was incubated with these whole blood samples for 3 h at 4 °C (on ice). To ensure the removal of all of theS-nitrosocysteine, the cells were centrifuged, plasma and buffy coat discarded, and cells then washed with a 25-fold excess 4 °C PBS for 5 min. The PBS was removed and the wash repeated for a total of five 5-min washes. The final wash PBS was collected, and the residual S-nitrosothiol in the wash was less than 50 nm. Red blood cells prepared by this methodology contained 1.1 ± 0.2% SNO/heme (220 μm intracellular SNO-Hb), 0% iron-nitrosyl-hemoglobin, and 8.7% methemoglobin. To measureS-nitrosothiol and nitrite levels, standards of SNO-Hb or SNO-albumin (prepared as described above) were added to 1.7-ml reaction tubes cooled on ice. After cooling, 100 μl of sulfanilamide/HgCl2 solution (16% sulfanilamide, 0.2% HgCl2 in 2 m HCl), or sulfanilamide alone, was added to the reaction mixtures followed by a balance of PBS/DTPA (100 μm) to make a final volume of 1100 μl. After 5 min of incubation in the dark at room temperature, 100 μl of 1.6%N-(1-naphthyl)ethenediamine in 2 m HCl was added to the reaction mixture and again the sample was allowed to incubate in the dark for 5 min. Following the second incubation, the reaction mixtures were centrifuged at 17,900 × g for 5 min, and 1 ml of supernatants were transferred to optical cuvettes to measure absorbance at 540 nm. Subtraction of appropriate blanks and of values for samples treated without HgCl2 determined the levels ofS-nitrosothiol without nitrite. The concentration ofS-nitrosothiol or nitrite was calculated using the extinction coefficient of 50,000 m−1cm−1 and with standards of known concentrations of GSNO. Different chemical reagents are mixed in a glass purge vessel. Helium gas is bubbled sequentially through the purge vessel, through 15 ml of 1 mNaOH, and then into the chemiluminescent nitric oxide analyzer (model 280 NO analyzer; Sievers, Boulder, CO), which can detect upward from 0.3 pmol of NO gas. The following chemicals were placed in the purge vessel for the experiments described herein. The method for the measurement of nitrite and S-nitrosothiols by reaction with I3− to release NO gas (22Samouilov A. Zweier J.L. Anal. Biochem. 1998; 258: 322-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) was applied to hemoglobin (8Gladwin M.T. Ognibene F.P. Pannell L.K. Nichols J.S. Pease-Fye M.E. Shelhamer J.H. Schechter A.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9943-9948Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). In brief, 7 ml of glacial acetic acid and 2 ml of distilled water were mixed with 100 mg of KI. A crystal of I2 was added to yield a concentration of ∼20–30 mm. Alternatively, to allow for the injection of large volumes of solutions with high protein concentration, a stock solution of I3− was prepared each day. Serial injections of S-nitrosoglutathione and nitrite were used over 4 h to document the stability of the I3− stock solution exposed to air. There was no decrease in NO release from S-nitrosothiols over this time period. This allowed us to change the reagent prior to each injection of hemoglobin solutions and removed variability produced by increasing protein concentrations and foaming. To specifically identify nitrite versus S-nitrosothiol, samples were incubated with and without acidified sulfanilamide (as described below) and reacted in the I3− reductant. Specific treatment of red cell and hemoglobin samples prior to reaction in the I3− reductant is described below. Nitrate was measured by reduction in vanadium(III) at 90 °C (24Ewing J.F. Janero D.R. Free Radical Biol. Med. 1998; 25: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). To reduce foaming during the analysis of nitrate levels in plasma, the samples were treated with a 2:1 volume of cold ethanol and centrifuged at 17,900 × g for 5 min. The value for nitrate was determined by subtraction of the nitrite and S-nitrosothiol values, derived by I3− assay, from the result derived from vanadium assay. To eliminate nitrite contamination from human hemoglobin samples, Sephadex G25 desalted samples were reacted with and without 5 mmHgCl2 and then treated with a 10% volume of 5% sulfanilamide in 1 n HCl as described under “Results” (10Marley R. Feelisch M. Holt S. Moore K. Free Radical Res. 2000; 32: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). These solutions completely abolished contaminating nitrite signal, whereas purified SNO-Hb was completely stable. The levels of SNO-Hb after acidified sulfanilamide treatment as measured by the I3− chemiluminescent assay were the same as the levels measured by the Griess-Saville assay after subtraction of the nitrite background, suggesting that some nitrite is associated with preparations of SNO-Hb even after extensive dialysis or column separation. Red blood cell pellet samples (100 μl) were lysed in 900 μl of PBS with KCN/K3FeIII(CN)6 (4 mm), NEM (10 mm), DTPA (100 μm), and 1% Nonidet P-40 (to solubilize membrane, which may containS-nitrosated anion exchange protein 1 (Ref. 25Pawloski J.R. Hess D.T. Stamler J.S. Nature. 2001; 409: 622-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar)). The pH of this solution was 7.2. Lysed red blood cell samples were incubated in this solution at room temperature for 5 min and 500 μl passed through a prerinsed 9.5-ml bed volume Sephadex G25 column. The hemoglobin aliquots from 3–3.7 ml were collected, separated into two fractions (270 μl each), and reacted with and without HgCl2 (final concentration 5 mm) for 2 min. 10% volume of 5% sulfanilamide in 1 n HCl was added to the hemoglobin solutions and incubated for 5 min (final concentration of 0.5% sulfanilamide in 0.1 n HCl). 300-μl volumes of the hemoglobin solutions, with and without HgCl2 treatment (to specify S-nitrosothiol), were injected into 8 ml of I3− solution in the reaction chamber (see “I3− Reagent”). The I3− was replaced for each injection from a stock solution prepared fresh each day and no antifoam agent was used. The quantity of NO released was determined by calculation of the area under the curve (see “Statistical Analysis”), corrected for the dilution of added HgCl2 and acidified sulfanilamide, and the value divided by the concentration of heme measured spectrally in Drabkin's reagent (prior to addition of HgCl2 and acidified sulfanilamide). For the determination of the in vivolevels of red blood cell SNO, whole blood was drawn from 8 normal volunteers from the artery and vein into vacuum containers with sodium heparin (to preserve physiological arterial and venous hemoglobin oxygen saturations). Samples were spun at 750 × g for 5 min and plasma discarded. 100 μl of the red cell pellet below the buffy coat was removed and immediately lysed in 900 μl of PBS with 1% Nonidet P-40, KCN/K3FeIII(CN)6(4 mm), NEM (10 mm), and DTPA (100 μm). The pH of this solution was 7.2. Following Sephadex G25 desalting, hemoglobin concentration was measured in Drabkin's reagent, and samples were reacted with and without 5.0 mmHgCl2 for 2 min, then with 10% volume of 5% sulfanilamide in 1 n HCl for 3 min, followed by NO measurement by I3− chemiluminescent assay. Erythrocytes containing elevated levels of SNO-Hb were prepared as described above. Only samples with less than 10% methemoglobin were used. One ml of pre-agitated (to ensure mixing) erythrocyte suspension was added to 9 ml of buffer in two tonometers. As described under “Results,” the tonometers alternatively contained human plasma collected from the same individual who donated the red cells, PBS with 24 mm NaHCO3 (distilled water added to keep sodium concentration 140 mm), and PBS with 24 mm NaHCO3 and 400 μm GSH. GSH was added as a thiol acceptor for potential erythrocyte-derived trans-nitrosation reactions (26Lipton A.J. Johnson M.A. Macdonald T. Lieberman M.W. Gozal D. Gaston B. Nature. 2001; 413: 171-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). One tonometer was pre-equilibrated for 60 min with 21% oxygen and 5% CO2 gases and the second tonometer with 0% oxygen and 5% CO2. The tonometers were protected from light and agitated on a rocker platform. Following the addition of cells, 1-ml samples were withdrawn every 5 min using Hamilton syringes. Samples were added to 8 mm NEM and 100 μm DTPA to stabilize S-nitrosothiols (10Marley R. Feelisch M. Holt S. Moore K. Free Radical Res. 2000; 32: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) and centrifuged at 750 × g for 5 min. The cells and buffer were separated and flash-frozen on dry ice. The buffer nitrite, nitrate, and S-nitrosothiol content and red cell SNO-Hb was subsequently measured by chemiluminescence (as described above). Samples were also withdrawn at the same 5-min intervals for determination of hemoglobin saturation (by co-oximetry), pO2, pCO2, and pH (i-STAT Corp., East Windsor, NJ). Methemoglobin concentrations were measured by absorption spectroscopy at 700, 630, 576, and 560 nm using the Winterbourn relationship (27Winterbourn C.C. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 186: 265-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). Oxygen dissociation curve measurements of SNO-Hb-containing red blood cells were performed using the Hemox-Analyzer (TCS Scientific Corp., New Hope, PA) (28Gladwin M.T. Schechter A.N. Shelhamer J.H. Pannell L.K. Conway D.A. Hrinczenko B.W. Nichols J.S. Pease-Fye M.E. Noguchi C.T. Rodgers G.P. Ognibene F.P. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 104: 937-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). We have found that the Sievers analytical software (model 280 NO analyzer) produces some error when measuring the area under the curve for samples with 0.3–5 pmol of NO. We therefore transferred raw data from the Sievers program to Origin (Microcal Software, Inc., Northampton, MA). The data were smoothed using the Savitzky-Golay filter method provided with the software (symmetric, 21-point window; polynomial degree = 2). Two-tailed paired t tests were used to analyze differences in the values of paired samples before, during, and after experiments. For time-course experiments, the data were analyzed by repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA). Data are reported as the mean ± the standard error of the mean. To validate our standards and improved chemiluminescent methodologies, preparations of SNO-Hb and SNO-albumin were analyzed by both the I3− chemiluminescent assay and by the Griess-Saville assay. As shown in Fig. 1(A and B), the I3−chemiluminescent assay compared favorably with the well established Griess-Saville assay over a wide range of concentrations for both SNO-Hb and SNO-albumin. To determine the limits of sensitivity, purified samples of synthesized SNO-Hb were added to freshly drawn, washed (in PBS), lysed erythrocyte pellets at concentrations from 200 nm (0.002% S-NO/heme) to 3,200 nm(0.032% S-NO/heme). Following treatment with ferricyanide and cyanide (described below) to eliminate iron-nitrosyl signal and to stabilize SNO-Hb in red blood cell lysates, the hemoglobin samples were passed through a prerinsed G25 Sephadex sizing column and injected into the I3− reagent. The NO recovery was stoichiometric with an r 2 value of 0.996 (Fig.1, C and D; p < 0.001;n = 4). Levels of SNO-Hb measured by other laboratories using UV photolysis have been reported to be as high as 0.001/hemoglobin tetramer or 2.5 μm in whole blood. As can be seen in Fig. 1 (C and D), such levels would be readily measured using our assay. We have used solutions of KCN and K3FeIII(CN)6to selectively oxidize the NO from the heme while preserving theS-nitrosothiol linkage. This sample treatment allows us to first remove the NO bound to the heme group so that we can specifically measure the NO release from cysteine 93 in the I3− chemiluminescence-based assay. The standards of SNO-Hb shown in Fig. 1 (C and D) were pretreated with KCN/K3FeIII(CN)6 prior to reaction in the I3− chemiluminescence-based assay (8Gladwin M.T. Ognibene F.P. Pannell L.K. Nichols J.S. Pease-Fye M.E. Shelhamer J.H. Schechter A.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9943-9948Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). SNO-Hb is stable in a large molar excess of KCN and K3FeIII(CN)6. This was shown using three approaches. In the first experiment (Fig.2 A), 10-μl volumes of solutions containing SNO-Hb (0.9 mm SNO), nitrite (10 mm), nitrate (10 mm), and HbFeIINO (0.67 mm) were injected into a purge vessel containing 0.2m KCN/K3FeIII(CN)6 in PBS. The reaction chamber was purged with helium in-line with the chemiluminescent NO analyzer to detect released NO gas. As shown in Fig. 2 A, SNO-Hb, nitrite, and nitrate are stable in this solution (i.e. do not release appreciable amounts of NO), whereas NO gas is released from HbFeIINO. The small NO signal from the injection of SNO-Hb derives from small amounts of iron-nitrosyl-hemoglobin formed in the synthesis of SNO-Hb (see small mercury-stable peak in Fig. 2 B). In the second set of experiments, SNO-Hb was measured using the I3−chemiluminescence-based assay with and without cyanide/ferricyanide and HgCl2 pretreatments. Briefly, 10 μl of 0.9 mmSNO-Hb was incubated for 30 min in 90 μl of PBS, 90 μl of 0.2m KCN/K3FeIII(CN)6 in PBS, or 90 μl of 0.5 mm HgCl2 and then passed through a Sephadex G25 sizing column. The samples were then injected into a reaction vessel containing the I3−reagent. The reaction chamber was purged with helium in-line with the chemiluminescent NO analyzer to detect released NO gas. As shown in Fig. 2 B, there is no loss of SNO-Hb that has been incubated in a large molar excess of KCN/K3FeIII(CN)6, in the absence of HgCl2, whereas it is completely decomposed by incubation with HgCl2. In the final experiment, SNO-H"

Modifications of low density lipoprotein (LDL), such as oxidation, are prerequisite events for the formation of foam cells. We demonstrate here that group X secretory phospholipase A2 (sPLA2-X) may be involved in this process. sPLA2-X was found to induce potent hydrolysis of phosphatidylcholine in LDL leading to the production of large amounts of unsaturated fatty acids and lysophosphatidylcholine (lyso-PC), which contrasted with little, if any, lipolytic modification of LDL by the classic types of group IB and IIA secretory PLA2s. Treatment with sPLA2-X caused an increase in the negative charge of LDL with little modification of apolipoprotein B (apoB) in contrast to the excessive aggregation and fragmentation of apoB in oxidized LDL. The sPLA2-X-modified LDL was efficiently incorporated into macrophages to induce the accumulation of cellular cholesterol ester and the formation of non-membrane-bound lipid droplets in the cytoplasm, whereas the extensive accumulation of multilayered structures was found in the cytoplasm in oxidized LDL-treated macrophages. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed marked expression of sPLA2-X in foam cell lesions in the arterial intima of high fat-fed apolipoprotein E-deficient mice. These findings suggest that modification of LDL by sPLA2-X in the arterial vessels is one of the mechanisms responsible for the generation of atherogenic lipoprotein particles as well as the production of various lipid mediators, including unsaturated fatty acids and lyso-PC.

Initiation of atherosclerosis is characterized by the appearance of fatty streaks underlying the endothelium of large arteries. Recruitment of macrophages and their subsequent uptake of low density lipoprotein (LDL)1-derived cholesterol are the major cellular events contributing to fatty streak formation (1Ross R. Nature. 1993; 362: 801-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (10002) Google Scholar, 2Glass C.K. Witztum J.L. Cell. 2001; 104: 503-516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2654) Google Scholar). Oxidative modifications in the lipid and apolipoprotein B (apoB) components of LDL are thought to drive the formation of fatty streaks (2Glass C.K. Witztum J.L. Cell. 2001; 104: 503-516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2654) Google Scholar, 3Navab M. Berliner J.A. Watson A.D. Hama S.Y. Territo M.C. Lusis A.J. Shih D.M. Van Lenten B.J.

Biol. 1996; 16: 831-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar), because oxidized LDL can be incorporated into the macrophages via scavenger receptors leading to the formation of foam cells that contain massive amounts of cholesterol esters. In addition, there is substantial evidence that LDL oxidation occurs in both animals and humans during the progression of atherogenesis (4Napoli C. D'Armiento F.P. Mancini F.P. Postiglione A. Witztum J.L. Palumbo G. Palinski W. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 2680-2690Crossref PubMed Scopus (814) Google Scholar). However, prospective clinical trials with antioxidants, such as vitamin E and beta carotene, in patients with pre-existing atherosclerosis, have thus far been disappointing (5Yusuf S. Dagenais G. Pogue J. Bosch J. Sleight P. N. Engl. J. Med. 2000; 342: 154-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (1777) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that other types of LDL modifications, such as that resulting from lipolytic enzymes (6Hakala J.K. Oorni K. Ala-Korpela M. Kovanen P.T. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1999; 19: 1276-1283Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), also play pivotal roles in the formation of foam cells. Phospholipase A2 (PLA2) are a diverse family of lipolytic enzymes that hydrolyze the sn-2 fatty acid ester bond of glycerophospholipids to produce free fatty acids and lysophospholipids (7Vadas P. Pruzanski W. Lab. Invest. 1986; 55: 391-404PubMed Google Scholar, 8Arita H. Nakano T. Hanasaki K. Prog. Lipid Res. 1989; 28: 273-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Over the past two decades, a number of PLA2s have been identified and classified into different families based on their biochemical features and primary structures (9Balsinde J. Balboa M.A. Insel P.A. Dennis E.A. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1999; 39: 175-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar,10Six D.A. Dennis E.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1488: 1-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (1223) Google Scholar). Among them, secretory PLA2 (sPLA2) have several characteristics, including a low molecular mass (13–18 kDa) and an absolute catalytic requirement for millimolar concentrations of Ca2+ (10Six D.A.

At present, nine different groups of sPLA2s have been identified in humans (IB, IIA, IID, IIE, IIF, III, V, X, and XII) (10Six D.A. Dennis E.A. Biochim. Biophys.

Recent studies have shown that group IIA sPLA2 (sPLA2-IIA) is expressed in the atherosclerotic arterial intima and is associated with extracellular matrix structures and lipid droplets (15Elinder L.S. Dumitrescu A. Larsson P. Hedin U. Frostegard J. Claesson H.E. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1997; 17: 2257-2263Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 16Romano M. Romano E. Bjorkerud S.

In addition, sPLA2-IIA was shown to induce the lipolysis of LDL leading to enhanced retention of LDL to human aortic proteoglycans (19Hakala J.K. Oorni K. Pentikainen M.O. Hurt-Camejo E. Kovanen P.T. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2001; 21: 1053-1058Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 20Hurt-Camejo E. Camejo G. Peilot H. Oorni K. Kovanen P. Circ. Res. 2001; 89: 298-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar), suggesting a potential role of sPLA2-IIA in the accumulation of LDL in the proteoglycan matrix on the subendothelial layer of the arterial intima. However, potent modifications of LDL leading to increased uptake by macrophages were reported with the type III bee venom sPLA2 but not with sPLA2-IIA (21Aviram M. Maor I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 185: 465-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The differences in the potency of LDL modification might be due to discrepancies in substrate specificity in the mixed micelle assay, because sPLA2-IIA preferably hydrolyzes anionic phospholipids (22Ono T. Tojo H. Kuramitsu S. Kagamiyama H. Okamoto M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 5732-5738Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) such as phosphatidylglycerol and phosphatidylserine and has a very low enzymatic activity toward phosphatidylcholine (PC), a major phospholipid component of LDL (23Hevonoja T.

Saiga A. Morioka Y. Ikeda M. Kawamoto K. Higashino K. Nakano K. Yamada K. Ishizaki J. Arita H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34203-34211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) have shown that, among the endogenous sPLA2s in mammals, group X sPLA2 (sPLA2-X) is one of the enzymes with a potent hydrolyzing activity toward PC. sPLA2-X has 16 cysteine residues located at positions characteristic of the classic types of group IB sPLA2(sPLA2-IB) and sPLA2-IIA and has an amino acid C-terminal extension that is typical of group II sPLA2subtypes (25Cupillard L. Koumanov K. Mattei M.G. Lazdunski M. Lambeau G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15745-15752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). We have shown that sPLA2-X can induce potent release of arachidonic acid leading to cyclooxygenase (COX)-dependent prostaglandin formation, as well as marked production of lysophosphatidylcholine (lyso-PC) in various cell types, including macrophages, spleen cells, and colon cancer cells (26Saiga A.

Arita H. Hanasaki K. FEBS Lett. 2000; 487: 262-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). During the process of these cell-based experiments, we found that sPLA2-X elicits potent release of unsaturated fatty acids from the culture medium containing fetal calf serum (FCS) in cell-free systems. These observations prompted us to examine its potential role in lipolysis of human serum lipoproteins. In the present study, we first evaluated the potencies of three types of human sPLA2s (sPLA2-IB, -IIA, and -X) with respect to the release of fatty acids and the contents of PC and lyso-PC in LDL. We then compared the characteristics of sPLA2-X-modified LDL with oxidized LDL in terms of phospholipid composition, negative charge, and apoB aggregation as well as for the efficacy in uptake into macrophages. We found that sPLA2-X induced potent lipolysis of LDL leading to the formation of numerous lipid droplets in the macrophages. Finally, we showed elevated expression of sPLA2-X in the foam cells in the atherosclerotic arterial wall in high fat-fed mice deficient in apolipoprotein E (apoE). Purified recombinant human sPLA2-IB, sPLA2-X, and mouse sPLA2-X proteins were prepared as described previously (24Hanasaki K. Ono T. Saiga A. Morioka Y. Ikeda M. Kawamoto K. Higashino K. Nakano K.

Recombinant human sPLA2-IIA was a generous gift from Dr. Ruth Kramer (Eli Lilly, Indianapolis, IN). Rabbit anti-human sPLA2-X Ab was prepared as described previously (24Hanasaki K. Ono T. Saiga A. Morioka Y. Ikeda M. Kawamoto K. Higashino K. Nakano K. Yamada K. Ishizaki J. Arita H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34203-34211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), and anti-sPLA2-IB and anti-sPLA2-IIA Abs were purchased from Cayman Chemicals. Bovine serum albumin (BSA), indomethacin (COX inhibitor), and nordihydroguaiaretic acid (NDGA, lipoxygenase (LOX) inhibitor) were obtained from Sigma Chemical Co. Indoxam (sPLA2 inhibitor) was synthesized at Shionogi Research Laboratories (29Hagishita S. Yamada M. Shirahase K. Okada T. Murakami Y. Ito Y. Matsuura T. Wada M. Kato T. Ueno M. Chikazawa Y.

Very low density lipoprotein (VLDL, density less than 1.006 g/ml), LDL (d = 1.019–1.063 g/ml), and high density lipoprotein (HDL,d = 1.085–1.210 g/ml) were isolated from plasma of healthy and fasting donors by sequential ultracentrifugation, as described previously (30Hara S. Shike T. Takasu N. Mizui T. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1997; 17: 1258-1266Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). For modification of LDL with sPLA2s, 1 mg/ml LDL was incubated with various concentrations of sPLA2-IB, -IIA, or -X at 37 °C in buffer composed of 1 mm CaCl2, 12.5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.25 m NaCl, and 0.0125% BSA. The reaction was stopped by addition of EDTA at a final concentration of 5 mm. For oxidative modification, 1 mg/ml LDL was incubated with 20 μm CuSO4 at 37 °C and then dialyzed against 150 mm NaCl containing 0.24 mm EDTA (pH 7.4). LDL prepared by incubation without any modification was used as native LDL. Human LDL (1 mg/ml) was preincubated for 10 min at 37 °C and stimulated with various concentrations of sPLA2 enzymes in a final volume of 40 μl. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 160 μl of Dole's reagent, and the released fatty acids were extracted, labeled with 9-anthryldiazomethane (Funakoshi, Japan), and analyzed by reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) on a LiChroCART 125-4 Supersphere 100 RP-18 column (Merck), as described previously (24Hanasaki K. Ono T. Saiga A. Morioka Y. Ikeda M. Kawamoto K. Higashino K. Nakano K. Yamada K. Ishizaki J. Arita H. J. Biol.

Lipid Res. 1993; 34: 837-844Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For measurement of the amounts of PC and lyso-PC in LDL, lipids were extracted with organic solvent as described previously (26Saiga A. Morioka Y. Ono T. Nakano K. Ishimoto Y. Arita H. Hanasaki K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1530: 67-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The extracted phospholipids were then separated by normal-phase HPLC on Ultrasphere silica 4.6 × 250 mm (Beckman) with a guard column of 4.6 × 45 mm using a solvent of acetonitrile/methanol/sulfuric acid (100:7:0.05, v/v) with a flow rate of 1 ml/min at room temperature. Fractions corresponding to authentic PC orl-α-lyso-PC (Sigma Chemical Co.), detected at the wavelength of 202 nm, were pooled and subjected to quantitative phosphorus analysis (32Chalvardjian A. Rudnicki E. Anal. Biochem. 1970; 36: 225-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Following modification with sPLA2s and CuSO4 oxidation, lipid peroxidation was assessed by the following procedures. The peroxides were quantified in terms of thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS) according to the method of Nagano et al. (33Nagano Y. Arai H. Kita T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 6457-6461Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Conjugated dienes were determined by monitoring the changes in absorbance of A 234 at a final concentration of 200 μg/ml LDL, as reported previously (34Esterbauer H. Striegl G. Puhl H. Rotheneder M. Free Radic. Res. Commun. 1989; 6: 67-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (1692) Google Scholar). The electrophoretic mobility of LDL was analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis (Titan Gel Lipoproteins, Helena Laboratories, Japan), as described previously (35Noble R.P. J. Lipid Res. 1968; 9: 693-700Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For analysis of apoB modification, LDL was delipidated and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) in 4% acrylamide, as described previously (36Tong H. Knapp H.R. VanRollins M. J. Lipid Res. 1998; 39: 1696-1704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mouse peritoneal macrophages were obtained from the peritoneal cavity of male C57BL/6J mice (8 weeks) 5 days after injection of 3% thioglycolate (Difco Laboratories). The cells were washed, resuspended in serum-free medium, X-VIVO 15 (BioWhittaker), and plated in 24-well plates (Costar) (5 × 105cells/well). Non-adherent cells were removed by washing and adherent macrophages were incubated with native LDL or modified LDL (200 μg/ml) for 48 h. The lipid extracts of macrophages were prepared, evaporated, dissolved with isopropanol and the cholesterol mass was quantified by enzyme fluorometry (37Gamble W. Vaughan M. Kruth H.S. Avigan J. J. Lipid Res. 1978; 19: 1068-1070Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The amount of esterified cholesterol was calculated by subtracting the free cholesterol from total cholesterol. The amounts of cellular proteins were quantified with BCA Protein Assay reagent (Pierce) after dissolving the cells in 0.2 n NaOH. Mouse peritoneal macrophages were prepared as described above and cultured in four-well tissue culture chambers (Iwaki, Japan, 1.25 × 105cells/well). The adherent macrophages were incubated with either native LDL or modified LDL (200 μg/ml) for 48 h at 37 °C. After incubation, the cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and fixed with 11% formaldehyde in PBS for 15 min. They were then stained with oil red O for 30 min and counterstained with Meyer's hematoxylin for 1 min. The stained cells were examined by light microscopy. All procedures were performed at room temperature. Macrophages were prepared as described above and cultured in four-well glass slides (Lab-Tek II chamber slide, Nalge Nunc International Corp.). Acetylation of LDL was performed as described previously (38Zhang H. Yang Y. Steinbrecher U.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5535-5542Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After incubation with native LDL or modified LDL (200 μg/ml) for 24 or 48 h at 37 °C, the cells were fixed with 0.5% glutaraldehyde and 2% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 mphosphate buffer, pH 7.2. Samples were rinsed in 7% sucrose in 0.1m phosphate buffer, post-fixed in 1% OsO4, dehydrated, and then embedded in epoxy resin. Ultrathin sections were cut, stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate, and examined with a Jeol 1200EX microscope. ApoE-deficient mice (8 weeks) were obtained from The Jackson Laboratory, and age-matched C57BL/6J mice were obtained from Clea Japan. They were fed a high fat and high cholesterol diet (15.8% cocoa butter, 1.25% cholesterol, 0.5% sodium cholate) for 9 weeks then flushed with PBS via the abdominal aorta under pentobarbital anesthesia and perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS. Segments of the proximal aorta and the portions of the heart containing the aortic arches were swiftly removed and cut into small pieces, which were then immersed in the same fresh fixative at 4 °C overnight. Fixed samples were thoroughly rinsed with PBS and subsequently dehydrated by passage through an alcohol series diluted with double-distilled water followed by n-butyl alcohol. The tissue preparations were then passed into paraffin at 56 °C. Transversal tissue sections (6-μm thickness) were cut from embedded paraffin blocks and mounted on slides freshly thin-coated with 3-aminoprophyltriethoxysilane. Immunohistochemistry was performed after paraffin dewaxing. The tissue slides were incubated in methanol containing 0.3% H2O2 for 30 min and then treated with 5% normal rabbit serum for 20 min. The slides were incubated with anti-sPLA2-X Ab (6 μg/ml), anti-sPLA2-IB Ab (5 μg/ml), or anti-sPLA2-IIA Ab (7 μg/ml) in PBS containing 0.1% BSA for 1 h at room temperature. After rinsing with PBS, they were incubated with biotin-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG for 30 min followed by treatment with horseradish peroxidase avidin-biotin complex reagent (Vector Laboratories). After washing, the peroxidase activity was visualized by 10-min incubation in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6) containing 200 μg/ml 3,3′-diaminobenzidine and 0.006% H2O2. After counterstaining of the nuclei with 0.4% hematoxylin, the preparations were mounted in Malinol resinous medium (Muto Pure Chemicals, Japan). Positive signals were detected as dark brown diaminobenzidine deposits. Neutralization of sPLA2-X-specific signals was performed by incubating anti-sPLA2-X Ab with purified mouse sPLA2-X protein (60 μg/ml) for 2 h at room temperature followed by addition to the slides. In separate experiments, the slides were incubated with rat anti-mouse macrophage F4/80 Ab (Serotec, UK) and then incubated with biotin-conjugated rabbit anti-rat IgG Ab followed by treatment with peroxidase avidin-biotin complex reagent. We first examined the potency of three types of human sPLA2 for the release of fatty acids in human plasma at a concentration of 50 nm and found that sPLA2-X induced the most potent release of unsaturated fatty acids (data not shown). We then prepared three types of lipoprotein fraction (VLDL, HDL, and LDL) from freshly isolated human plasma and then examined the potencies of sPLA2s for the release of fatty acids. As shown in Fig.1, sPLA2-X elicited marked release of various types of unsaturated fatty acids from human LDL in the following order: linoleic acid (C18:2) > arachidonic acid (C20:4) > oleic acid (C18:1) ≈ docosahexaenoic acid (C22:6), whereas sPLA2-IB and -IIA caused little release. In contrast, there was little, if any, release of saturated fatty acids, including myristic acid, palmitic acid, and stearic acid, from LDL after sPLA2-X treatment. The profiles of free fatty acids released by sPLA2-X were almost identical among LDL, HDL, and VLDL. In addition, there were no significant changes in the contents of sphingomyelin in LDL and HDL (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 2 A, sPLA2-X induced time-dependent release of arachidonic acid from LDL. In contrast, no significant release was observed during treatment with sPLA2-IB or -IIA for 4 h. Fig. 2 Bshows the dose-dependent release of arachidonic acid by three types of sPLA2 during 1-h incubation. sPLA2-X induced significant release at 5 nm, whereas sPLA2-IB evoked slight but significant release at 500 nm. There was little, if any, release with sPLA2-IIA treatment even at 500 nm, demonstrating that sPLA2-X elicits more potent release of unsaturated fatty acids from human LDL as compared with sPLA2-IB and -IIA.Figure 2Time- and dose-dependent release of arachidonic acid by sPLA2s in LDL.

LDL (1 mg/ml) was incubated with various concentrations of purified human sPLA2s for 1 h at 37 °C. The released arachidonic acid was quantified as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The results are shown after subtracting the values obtained with incubation in the absence of sPLA2s at each time point. Each point represents the mean ± S.D. of triplicate measurements. The data are representative of three experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Because PC is a major component of phospholipids in LDL (23Hevonoja T. Pentikainen M.O. Hyvonen M.T. Kovanen P.T. Ala-Korpela M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1488: 189-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar), we next examined the PC contents in LDL after treatment with sPLA2s or CuSO4. As shown in Fig.3 A, PC contents were time-dependently decreased after treatment with 50 nm sPLA2-X and oxidation. Over half of the PC was diminished in LDL by sPLA2-X within 3 h, and PC was completely degraded after 24-h treatment. Corresponding to the reduction of PC contents, the amounts of lyso-PC in LDL was increased up to 24 h after sPLA2-X treatment (Fig.3 B). Incubation with the sPLA2-specific inhibitor indoxam (10 μm) or anti-sPLA2-X Ab (100 μg/ml), both of which have been shown to block the enzymatic activity of sPLA2-X (24Hanasaki K. Ono T. Saiga A. Morioka Y. Ikeda M. Kawamoto K. Higashino K. Nakano K. Yamada K. Ishizaki J. Arita H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34203-34211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), resulted in significant suppression of sPLA2-X-induced lipolysis of LDL (data not shown). In contrast, treatment with sPLA2-IB or -IIA caused little change in either PC or lyso-PC contents in LDL. Oxidation of LDL with CuSO4 also caused significant production of lyso-PC. However, the amount of lyso-PC produced during 24-h oxidation was about 30% of that induced by sPLA2-X, although PC was degraded similarly by both treatments. In addition, there was no significant release of long chain unsaturated fatty acids examined during oxidation of LDL (data not shown). Treatment of LDL with CuSO4 caused an increase in TBARS (Table I) as well as the production of conjugated dienes (data not shown), whereas treatment with three types of sPLA2 did not alter these oxidative parameters. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that sPLA2-X induces PC hydrolysis in LDL leading to the production of large amounts of lyso-PC and unsaturated fatty acids without any oxidative modification.Table IAmounts of TBARS in LDL treated with human sPLA2s or CuSO4TreatmentTBARSnmol/mg proteinNone5.70 ± 1.40sPLA2-IB8.09 ± 3.08sPLA2-IIA4.15 ± 0.89sPLA2-X5.60 ± 2.40CuSO436.5 ± 8.561-ap < 0.01 compared to no treatment.Human LDL was incubated with 50 nm human sPLA2s or 20 μm CuSO4 for 3 h at 37 °C, and the amounts of TBARS were measured as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Each value for TBARS represents the mean ± S.D. of triplicate measurements.

The data are representative of three experiments. Statistical significance was determined by Student'st test. Modifications of apolipoproteins or surface lipids in LDL were shown to affect the cellular uptake of LDL and hence the formation of foam cell macrophages (2Glass C.K. Witztum J.L. Cell. 2001; 104: 503-516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2654) Google Scholar). We then examined the effects of sPLA2-X treatment on the electronic charge of LDL by agarose gel electrophoresis. As shown in Fig.4, oxidized LDL was characterized by increased anodic migration compared with native LDL. Treatment with sPLA2-X also caused enhanced mobility of LDL. Small but significant migration was detected after 3 h of treatment, and marked migration was observed after 24 h of treatment with sPLA2-X. In contrast, the mobility of LDL after treatment with sPLA2-IB or -IIA was not changed during 24-h incubation. Addition of anti-sPLA2-X Ab (100 μg/ml) resulted in complete blockade of sPLA2-X-induced mobilization (data not shown), demonstrating that the increase of negative charge in LDL is dependent on the enzymatic activity of sPLA2-X. Next, we examined the effects of sPLA2-X on the modification of apoB by SDS-PAGE analysis. As shown in Fig.5, excessive aggregation and proteolytic fragmentation of apoB was detected in oxidized LDL even at 3 h of incubation. In contrast, apoB in the sPLA2-X-treated LDL was almost intact with slight aggregation at 24 h of treatment compared with native LDL. There were no changes in apoB of LDL treated with sPLA2-IB and -IIA even at 500 nm (data not shown). These findings demonstrate that sPLA2-X induced an increase in the negative charge of LDL with little modification of apoB. Next, we examined the potency of sPLA2-X-treated LDL for uptake into macrophages. After exp"

The detailed understanding of the mechanism of protein targeting to the Tat pathway has been hampered by the lack of screening or selection systems suitable for genetic analysis. We report here the development of a highly quantitative protein reporter for genetic analysis of Tat-specific export. Specifically, export via the Tat pathway rescues green fluorescent protein (GFP) fused to an SsrA peptide from degradation by the cytoplasmic proteolytic ClpXP machinery. As a result, cellular fluorescence is determined by the amount of GFP in the periplasmic space. We used the GFP-SsrA reporter to isolate gain-of-function mutants of a Tat-specific leader peptide and for the genetic analysis of the “invariant” signature RR dipeptide motif. Flow cytometric screening of trimethylamine N-oxide reductase (TorA) leader peptide libraries resulted in isolation of six gain-of function mutants that conferred significantly higher steady-state levels of export relative to the wild-type TorA leader. All the gain-of-function mutations occurred within or near the (S/T)RRXFLK consensus motif, highlighting the significance of this region in interactions with the Tat export machinery. Randomization of the consensus RR dipeptide in the TorA leader revealed that a basic side chain (R/K) is required at the first position whereas the second position can also accept Gln and Asn in addition to basic amino acids. This result indicates that twin arginine translocation does not require the presence of an arginine dipeptide within the conserved sequence motif.

Neupert W. Nature. 2000; 406: 575-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar): the general secretory (Sec)1 pathway (2Danese P.N. Silhavy T.J. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1998; 32: 59-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 3Pugsley A.P. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 57: 50-108Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the signal recognition particle (SRP)-dependent pathway (4Meyer D.I. Krause E. Dobberstein B. Nature. 1982; 297: 647-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar), the recently discovered YidC-dependent process (5Samuelson J.C. Chen M. Jiang F. Moller I. Wiedmann M. Kuhn A. Phillips G.J. Dalbey R.E. Nature. 2000; 406: 637-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar), and the twin arginine translocation (Tat) system (6Berks B.C. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 22: 393-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar). The first three of these pathways involve a threading mechanism whereby the polypeptide chain is translocated across the membrane in a largely unfolded state. Protein export through these pathways also requires the participation of the SecYEG translocon and is driven by the hydrolysis of ATP (7Schatz G. Dobberstein B. Science. 1996; 271: 1519-1526Crossref PubMed Scopus (920) Google Scholar). Protein translocation via the Tat pathway is fundamentally different from the Sec pathway in that Tat substrates are at least partially folded prior to export. Moreover, the driving force for protein translocation is not provided by the hydrolysis of ATP but instead by the asymmetric distribution of protons across the membrane (ΔpH) (8Cline K. Ettinger W.F. Theg S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2688-2696Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The Tat pathway was first discovered in the thylakoid membranes of photosynthetic organisms and subsequently in bacteria (9Settles A.M. Yonetani A. Baron A. Bush D.R. Cline K. Martienssen R. Science. 1997; 278: 1467-1470Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 10Weiner J.H. Bilous P.T. Shaw G.M. Lubitz S.P. Frost L. Thomas G.H. Cole J.A. Turner R.J. Cell. 1998; 93: 93-101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). It derives its name from the signature Arg-Arg motif found in the leader peptides of proteins that are engaged in this mode of export from the cytoplasm. Estimates based on proteomic and bioinformatic analyses indicate that 5–8% of secreted proteins in bacteria such asEscherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis are translocated via the Tat pathway (11Berks B.C. Sargent F. Palmer T. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 35: 260-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). Many of these natural substrates are proteins that have to fold in the cytoplasm to acquire a range of cofactors such as FeS centers or molybdopterin. However, proteins that do not require cofactors have also been reported to traverse the cytoplasmic membrane via the Tat pathway, perhaps because they fold too rapidly or tightly for Sec-dependent transport (6Berks B.C. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 22: 393-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar, 11Berks B.C. Sargent F. Palmer T. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 35: 260-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). How large molecules are allowed to pass through the membrane without perturbing the cell remains a mystery. Nonetheless, large proteins of molecular mass up to 120 kDa have been documented to be exported through the Tat pathway. A combination of homology searches and biochemical studies have so far established that the integral membrane proteins TatABC are essential components of the Tat translocase inE. coli (10Weiner J.H.

Stanley N.R. Wexler M. Robinson C. Berks B.C. Palmer T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3640-3650Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar) and, in conjunction with TatE, form a translocation pore (13Sargent F. Gohlke U., De Leeuw E. Stanley N.R. Palmer T. Saibil H.R. Berks B.C. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 3361-3367Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The TatA and TatB proteins are predicted to contain one transmembrane α-helix, while the TatC protein has six predicted transmembrane helices and has been proposed to function both as the principal component of the translocation channel and as a receptor for preproteins (11Berks B.C. Sargent F. Palmer T. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 35: 260-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar, 14Bogsch E.G. Sargent F. Stanley N.R. Berks B.C. Robinson C. Palmer T. J. Biol.

Microbiol. 1998; 30: 674-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Mutagenesis of either TatB or TatC completely abolishes export (10Weiner J.H. Bilous P.T. Shaw G.M. Lubitz S.P. Frost L.

Chem. 1998; 273: 18003-18006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar), and purification of the Tat complex from solubilized E. coli membranes was found to contain only TatABC (16Bolhuis A. Mathers J.E. Thomas J.D. Barrett C.M. Robinson C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20213-20219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). In support of this finding, in vitro reconstitution of the translocation complex demonstrated a minimal requirement for TatABC and an intact membrane potential (17Yahr T.L. Wickner W.T. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2472-2479Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Tat-specific leader peptides exhibit several distinct differences compared with sequences capable of directing proteins to the Sec or SRP pathways (18Cristobal S. de Gier J.W. Nielsen H. von Heijne G. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2982-2990Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 19Lee H.C. Bernstein H.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3471-3476Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Specifically, Tat signals are longer because of the extended n-region, have a significantly less hydrophobic h-region and display more basic residues in the c-region (18Cristobal S. de Gier J.W. Nielsen H. von Heijne G. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2982-2990Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). A hallmark of both plant and prokaryotic Tat leader peptides is the presence of an (S/T)RRXFLK sequence motif at the n-region/h-boundary of the leader (6Berks B.C. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 22: 393-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar). Earlier studies have indicated that the twin arginine dipeptide is an essential determinant for targeting to the Tat pathway (18Cristobal S. de Gier J.W. Nielsen H. von Heijne G. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2982-2990Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). However, Stanley et al. (20Stanley N.R. Palmer T. Berks B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11591-11596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar) reported that for theE. coli SufI protein, substitution of an arginine for a lysine allowed Tat export, albeit at a slower rate. Furthermore, a naturally occurring Tat leader peptide containing a Lys residue at the first position of the dipeptide has been reported inSalmonella enterica (21Hinsley A.P. Stanley N.R. Palmer T. Berks B.C. FEBS Lett. 2001; 497: 45-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The analysis of the salient features of Tat-specific leader peptides and, for that matter of the biochemical components involved in the export pathway, have been hampered by the absence of suitable protein reporters useful for genetic analysis. Commonly used reporter proteins such as alkaline phosphatase and β-galactosidase, which had proved invaluable for the genetic dissection of the Sec pathway cannot be employed for the analysis of the Tat pathway (2Danese P.N. Silhavy T.J. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1998; 32: 59-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 22Sargent F. Trends Microbiol. 2001; 9: 196-198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar, 23Stanley N.R. Sargent F. Buchanan G. Shi J. Stewart V. Palmer T. Berks B.C. Mol.

Specifically, the former cannot fold within the bacterial cytoplasm thereby precluding Tat export (Ref.22Sargent F. Trends Microbiol. 2001; 9: 196-198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar), 2M. P. DeLisa and G. Georgiou, unpublished observations. whereas the β-galactosidase tetramer is presumably too large to be accommodated by the Tat translocase. We have developed a facile and quantitative protein reporter system suitable for the genetic analysis of the Tat pathway, and here we report its application to the mutational analysis of the E. coli trimethylamine N-oxide reductase (TorA) leader peptide. Fusion of green fluorescent protein (GFP) to the TorA leader peptide (but not to a Sec-specific leader peptide) results in accumulation of correctly folded, fluorescent GFP in the E. coli periplasmic space (25Santini C.L. Bernadac A. Zhang M. Chanal A. Ize B. Blanco C. Wu L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8159-8164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 26Thomas J.D. Daniel R.A. Errington J. Robinson C. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 39: 47-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). However, in bacteria expressing TorA-GFP about 50% of the protein fails to be exported and remains localized in the cytoplasm in an active, fluorescent form. The whole cell fluorescence is the sum of the intensity of the exported GFP and that of TorA-GFP trapped in the cytoplasm, and therefore it is not useful as a reporter of the amount of protein secreted via the Tat pathway. We show that the TorA-GFP remaining in the cytoplasm could be eliminated by appending a C-terminal SsrA peptide, which targets the protein for rapid degradation by the ClpAP proteolytic machinery (27Karzai A.W. Roche E.D. Sauer R.T. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 449-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). Only export from the cytoplasm via the Tat pathway can rescue the TorA-GFP-SsrA from proteolysis and thus confer increased cell fluorescence (Fig. 1A). The level of single cell fluorescence in a population can be conveniently measured by flow cytometry, and desired clones can be readily isolated by sorting (28Georgiou G. Adv. Protein Chem. 2000; 55: 293-315Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Here the GFP-SsrA reporter was exploited to isolate the first ever gain-of-function mutants of a Tat-specific leader and also to define genetically the range of permissible amino acid substitutions within the signature twin arginine dipeptide.

Plasmid pGS was made similarly using the primers GFPXbaI and GFPSsrA (5′-GCGATGAAGCTTGCATGCTTAAGCTGCTAAAGCGTAGTTTTCGTCGTTTGCTGCGTCGACTTTGTATAGTTCATCCATGCC-3′) to introduce the unique SsrA recognition sequence to the C terminus of GFP.

This sequence was then inserted intoSacI-XbaI-digested pGFP or pGS plasmid DNA. Plasmid pPGS was constructed identically using primers phoASacI (5′-GCGATGGAATTCGAGCTCTTAAAGAGGAGAAAGGTCGTGAAACAAAGCACTATTGCACTG-3′) and phoAXbaI (5′-GCGATGAAGCTTTTATTTCAGCCCCAGAGCGGCTT-3′) to PCR-amplify the leader sequence of E. coli alkaline phosphatase (PhoA).

Overnight cultures of XL1-Blue cells harboring GFP-based plasmids were subcultured into fresh LB medium with chloramphenicol and induced with 0.2% arabinose in mid-exponential phase growth. After 6 h, cells were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline, and 5 μl of washed cells were diluted into 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline prior to analysis using a BD Pharmingen FACSort. A library of random mutants was constructed by error-prone PCR of thetorA gene sequence using 0.5 mmMn2+, 3.32 or 4.82 mm Mg2+ (33Daugherty P.S. Chen G. Iverson B.L. Georgiou G. Proc. Natl. Acad.

All libraries were SacI-XbaI restriction-digested and ligated into plasmid pGS betweenSacI-XbaI placing the library upstream of thegfp-ssrA sequence. Reaction mixtures were electroporated into electrocompetent XL1-Blue cells (Stratagene), and serial dilutions were plated on selective plates to determine the number of independent transformants. Transformants were grown at 37 °C in LB medium with chloramphenicol, induced with 0.2% arabinose for 6 h and diluted 200-fold in 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline. FACS gates were set based upon FSC/SSC and FL1/FL2. Prior to sorting, the library cell population was labeled with propidium iodide for preferential labeling of non-viable cells (33Daugherty P.S. Chen G. Iverson B.L. Georgiou G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 2029-2034Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Typically, ∼3 × 106 cells were examined in 30 min, and 250–1000 events were collected. The collected solution was sterile-filtered (0.45 μm, Millipore), and the filters were placed on LB plates with chloramphenicol. After 12 h of incubation at 37 °C, individual colonies were inoculated into LB with chloramphenicol in triplicate 96-well plates. Following 12 h of growth at 37 °C, cells were similarly subcultured into triplicate 96-well plates containing LB with chloramphenicol and 0.2% arabinose and grown 6 h at 37 °C. Individual clones were screened via flow cytometry and a fluorescent plate reader (Bio-Tek FL600, Bio-Tek Instruments, Winooski, VT) for verification of fluorescent phenotype. The fraction of periplasmic proteins was obtained by spheroplasting bacteria by lysozyme-EDTA treatment under isotonic conditions according to the procedure of Kaback (35Kaback H.R. Methods Enzymol. 1971; 22: 99-120Crossref Scopus (554) Google Scholar). Specifically, cells were collected by centrifugation and resuspended to an OD600 of 10 in a buffer containing 100 mmTris-Cl (pH 8.0), 0.5 m sucrose, and 1 mmNaEDTA. Lysozyme (Sigma) was added to 50 μg/ml, and cells were incubated for up to 1 h at room temperature to generate spheroplasts. The latter were pelleted by 15 min of centrifugation at 3,000 × g, and the supernatant containing periplasmic proteins was collected for electrophoretic analysis. The pellet containing spheroplasts was resuspended in 10 ml of TE (10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 2.5 mm NaEDTA) and homogenized in a French press cell (Carver) at 2,000 lb/in2. To analyze total proteins of untreated cells, direct resuspension in 10 ml of TE followed by subjection to French press homogenization was performed. Western blotting was according to Chen et al. (36Chen G. Hayhurst A. Thomas J.G. Harvey B.R. Iverson B.L. Georgiou G. Nat. Biotechnol. 2001; 19: 537-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The following primary antibodies were used: monoclonal mouse anti-GFP (CLONTECH) diluted 1:5,000, monoclonal rabbit anti-DsbA (gift from John Joly, Genentech) diluted 1:10,000, and monoclonal rabbit anti-GroEL (Sigma) diluted 1:10,000. The secondary antibody was 1:10,000 goat anti-mouse and goat anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase. Membranes were first probed with anti-GFP and anti-DsbA antibodies and, following development, were stripped in Tris-buffered saline/2% SDS/0.7 mβ-mercaptoethanol. Stripped membranes were reblocked and probed with anti-GroEL antibody. A cDNA encoding the complete amino acid sequence (amino acids 1–46) of the E. coli TorA leader peptide plus the first eight residues of mature TorA was fused in-frame to the mutant2 green fluorescent protein variant (GFPmut2, Ref. 32Crameri A. Whitehorn E.A. Tate E. Stemmer W.P. Nat. Biotechnol. 1996; 14: 315-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (1060) Google Scholar), downstream from a pBAD arabinose-inducible promoter. In agreement with earlier reports (25Santini C.L. Bernadac A. Zhang M. Chanal A. Ize B. Blanco C. Wu L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8159-8164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar,26Thomas J.D. Daniel R.A. Errington J. Robinson C. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 39: 47-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar) 40–50% of the total fluorescence emission at 509 nm (and of the GFP protein as determined by Western blotting) was localized in the periplasmic fraction of E. coli XL1-Blue cells. In contrast >95% of the total cell fluorescence and of the GFP protein band on Western blots was found in the cytoplasm of E. coli XL1-tatB in which the tatB gene, required for protein translocation via the Tat pathway (29Sargent F. Stanley N.R. Berks B.C. Palmer T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36073-36082Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar), has been inactivated (Fig.1B). To generate a protein reporter for Tat-specific export, we sought to reduce GFP fluorescence arising from TorA-GFP that remains in the cytoplasm (Fig. 1A). Previous reports have demonstrated that the C-terminal fusion of the SsrA sequence (AANDENYALAA) to GFP targets the protein to rapid and efficient degradation by the cytoplasmic proteases, ClpXP and ClpAP (27Karzai A.W. Roche E.D. Sauer R.T. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 449-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar, 37Andersen J.B. Sternberg C. Poulsen L.K. Bjorn S.P. Givskov M. Molin S. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1998; 64: 2240-2246Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Preliminary experiments revealed that the level of accumulation of GFP-SsrA is highly dependent on the plasmid copy number and promoter used; at high levels of expression, e.g. from a Trc promoter or from high copy number plasmids, the intracellular concentration of GFP-SsrA saturates the SsrA-dependent proteolytic machinery resulting in a high cell fluorescence. 3P. Samuelson and G. Georgiou, results not shown. Fig.1B shows the fluorescence histograms of cells expressing GFP-SsrA, TorA-GFP-SsrA, and TorA-GFP from cultures grown and induced under identical conditions. A comparison of the mean fluorescence intensities (M) conferred by GFP-SsrA or TorA-GFP-SsrA expressed in either wild-type E. coli or in atatB-null mutant strain shows that export via the Tat pathway rescues a portion of the SsrA-tagged GFP from proteolysis resulting in 4–6-fold higher fluorescence signal. Importantly, replacing the twin arginines with twin lysine residues (TorA(R11K:R12K)), amino acid substitutions that had been reported to completely block export (18Cristobal S. de Gier J.W. Nielsen H. von Heijne G. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2982-2990Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar), results in non-fluorescent cells. The mean fluorescence for TorA-GFP was 556 au but as noted above, 50% of the fluorescence signal is due to the periplasmic GFP, whereas the rest is contributed by translocation-incompetent protein in the cytoplasm. A mutation that renders all TorA-GFP-SsrA translocation-competent and allows complete rescue from SsrA-mediated degradation would be expected to result in a level of fluorescence comparable with that observed by TorA-GFP (i.e. 556 au) (assuming that the periplasmic and cytoplasmic GFP produced from the TorA-GFP construct have the same specific fluorescence intensity). Thus, the mean fluorescence that might be obtained with the TorA-GFP-SsrA system can range from <12 (for mutations that block Tat-mediated export) to >500 providing a wide dynamic range that allows the selection of either loss- or gain-of-function mutants. The protein flux through the Tat pathway is relatively low compared with export via the Sec-dependent pathway (11Berks B.C. Sargent F. Palmer T. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 35: 260-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). Recent evidence indicates that the protein flux can be modulated by substitutions within the consensus motif (20Stanley N.R. Palmer T. Berks B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11591-11596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar) and may be limited by the initial interaction of the leader peptide with the Tat export apparatus (13Sargent F. Gohlke U., De Leeuw E. Stanley N.R. Palmer T. Saibil H.R. Berks B.C. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 3361-3367Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). We examined whether mutations in the TorA leader could increase export and result in a higher steady-state accumulation of GFP in the perplasmic space. The TorA leader peptide was mutagenized by error-prone PCR under conditions that result in expected mutation frequencies of 0.5, 1.5, or 3.5% nucleotide substitutions per gene (33Daugherty P.S.

Biochem. 1995; 224: 347-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Actual error rates of 0.4, 1.2, and 3.1, respectively, were determined by sequencing 20 randomly selected library clones. Libraries between 106 and 107 transformants were obtained and screened by FACS to isolate clones exhibiting a higher fluorescence than cells expressing the wild-type TorA-GFP-SsrA. A total of six highly fluorescent clones were obtained from the more heavily mutagenized libraries (three from the 1.5% library and three from the 3.5% library). The high fluorescence phenotype was shown to be plasmid-encoded and was completely lost in a tatB mutant strain where export via the Tat pathway is impaired (Table II). DNA sequencing of the entir"

This high degree of localization suggests the EGFR contains targeting information for lipid domains. We have used mutagenesis to determine that the region of the receptor that controls targeting to caveolae/rafts resides in the juxtamembrane, second cysteine-rich region. A 60-amino acid-long sequence within this region that is continuous with the transmembrane domain was sufficient to target the transmembrane and cytoplasmic tails of both EGFR and the low density lipoprotein receptor to caveolae/rafts. TwoN-linked sugars in this segment were not required for proper targeting, although unglycosylated wild-type receptors did not localize properly. We conclude that, in contrast to signals for coated pit localization that are in the cytoplasmic tail, the targeting information for caveolae/rafts is on the extracellular side of the EGFR very close to the membrane.

Bioessays. 2000; 22: 697-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Members of this family include EGFR/ErbB1 (HER1), ErbB2 (Neu or HER2), ErbB3 (HER3), and ErbB4 (HER4). These receptors are highly conserved during evolution and function in various cellular signaling processes that include cell proliferation, adhesion, migration, differentiation, survival, and apoptosis (1Carpenter G.

Prior to ligand binding to EGFR1 in quiescent fibroblasts, a significant portion (65%) of the receptor is in the low density plasma membrane fractions that contain caveolae and non-caveolae rafts (5Mineo C. Gill G.N. Anderson R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30636-30643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). After ligand binding, activated receptors rapidly move from this membrane fraction to bulk plasma membrane where they are internalized by clathrin-coated pits (1Carpenter G. Bioessays. 2000; 22: 697-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar, 6Sorkin A. Waters C.M. Bioessays. 1993; 15: 375-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 7Alexander S. Front. Biosci. 1998; 3: D729-D738Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Movement to the non-raft fraction is dependent on an active kinase domain in the receptor, the presence of at least one tyrosine residue in the regulatory region of the cytoplasmic region, and an unphosphorylated threonine 654 (5Mineo C. Gill G.N. Anderson R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30636-30643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Whereas the motifs for receptor internalization and degradation appear to be located in the cytoplasmic portion of EGFR (6Sorkin A. Waters C.M. Bioessays. 1993; 15: 375-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar), receptors lacking the entire cytoplasmic region still concentrate in the caveola/raft fraction (5Mineo C. Gill G.N. Anderson R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30636-30643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). This suggests that either the transmembrane domain or the extracellular region of EGFR contains the targeting information for caveolae/rafts. We have used genetic engineering to distinguish between these two possibilities. Mutant EGF receptors were genetically engineered (Fig. 1), inserted into mammalian expression vector, and transiently expressed in B82 mouse fibroblasts that lack endogenous EGFR. The distribution of the various constructs on the plasma membrane was then quantified using cell fractionation. We were able to localize the principle caveola/raft targeting information in EGFR to a 60-amino acid-long (residues 581–641) juxtamembrane region in the extracellular portion of the receptor. Attachment of this sequence to the transmembrane and cytoplasmic tail of either the EGFR or the LDLR was sufficient to target the molecule to the caveola/raft fraction. Human EGFR cDNA and B82 cell lines were kindly provided by Dr. Gordon Gill. High fidelity DNA polymerase (Pfu) was purchased from Invitrogen. T4 DNA ligase and all restriction enzymes were purchased from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). Mammalian expression vector pcDNA3.1 and pcDNA3.1+Myc-His were from CLONTECH. Plasmid preparation kits and transfection reagents (Superfect) were from Qiagen (Valencia, CA). Low glucose DMEM and Optiprep were from Invitrogen. Fetal bovine serum was purchased from Atlanta Biologicals (Atlanta, GA). Percoll was purchased from Amersham Biosciences. A protease inhibitor mixture was from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. α-EGFR pAb was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). α-Caveolin-1 pAb was from BD PharMingen. α-Myc pAb was from Upstate Biotechnology (Waltham, MA). α-LDLR pAb was kindly provided by Dr. Joachim Herz. All reagents for SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis were from Bio-Rad. Polyvinylidene difluoride membrane was from Millipore (Bedford, MA). Enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) reagent was from Amersham Biosciences. The FluorChem 8000 was from Alpha Innotech Corp. (San Leandro, CA). A novel technique was developed to produce the EGFR constructs needed for this study. Instead of using restriction sites to cut and join DNA in the EGFR cDNA, compatible cohesive ends at the desired ligation sites were generated using PCR. For each site, two sets of oligonucleotides were designed for generating sticky ends at the site where the mutation was to be introduced. Two pieces of DNA were amplified from these two sets of oligonucleotides and from the primers at either the 5′-end (containingKpnI sites) or the 3′-end (containing XbaI sites) of EGFR cDNA. The DNA products were mixed together, denatured, and reannealed. One-quarter of the reannealed products corresponded to cDNA inserts with the correct compatible ends. DNA products were then cut with KpnI and XbaI and ligated together with linearized pcDNA3.1+ expression vector using standard ligation methods. To generate Myc-tagged constructs, the cDNAs were cloned into KpnI and XbaI sites of a pcDNA3.1+Myc-His expression vector. Automated DNA sequencing analysis was used to confirm that each construct was correct. We used this method to generate 11 different cDNAs (Fig.1). Normal human fibroblasts and transformed mouse fibroblasts that lack endogenous EGFR (B82 cell lines) were used in this study. Normal human fibroblasts were obtained by skin biopsy, cultured in a monolayer, and set up according to a standard format. On day 0, 2.5 × 105 cells were seeded into 100-mm dishes with 5 ml of minimum Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. The medium was changed on day 3 and day 5. All experiments were carried out on day 8. For detection of LDLR, the cells were grown overnight in DMEM on day 7. B82 cell lines were grown in low glucose DMEM plus 10% fetal bovine serum in a 37 °C incubator containing 5% CO2. One day prior to transfection, 1 × 106 cells were seeded into 100-mm dishes. Thirty-six hours after transfection, cells were ∼90% confluent. DNA was prepared using an endotoxin-free plasmid preparation kit (EndoFree Maxi kit) from Qiagen and transfected into B82 cell lines using Superfect transfection reagent according to the manufacturer's protocol. A ratio of DNA to transfection reagent at 1:10 was used in all experiments. We typically achieved 75–80% transfection efficiency with very little cell death. All experiments were done 36 h after transfection. Caveolae/rafts were prepared using the detergent-free method of Smart et al. (8Smart E.J. Ying Y.-S. Mineo C. Anderson R.G.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10104-10108Crossref PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar) with the following modifications for B82 cells. A plasma membrane fraction was prepared from five 100-mm dishes after 36 h of transfection. A glass tissue grinder (Wheaton, catalog no. 357538) was used instead of a Teflon homogenizer. The isolated plasma membrane was sonicated three successive times at a power setting of 50 J/watt·s. EGFR was detected by immunoblotting using an α-EGFR pAb as the primary antibody, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated α-rabbit IgG as a secondary antibody, and ECL to visualize the protein. The ECL image was recorded using the FluorChem 8000, and the optical density of an equal surface area for each band was determined using NIH image version 1.6 software. The total optical density value of the bands in 13 fractions equaled 100%. The percentage of signal from fractions 1 to 7 was calculated as the amount of EGFR in the caveola/raft fractions. A standard cell fraction assay has been developed that can distinguish whether a protein of interest is in caveolae/rafts (8Smart E.J. Ying Y.-S. Mineo C. Anderson R.G.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10104-10108Crossref PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar). The light buoyant density of caveolae/rafts allows one to separate them from bulk membrane once the plasma membrane has been fragmented by sonication. Equal volume loads of each fraction were separated on SDS-PAGE gels and immunoblotted to detect the indicated protein (Fig.2). Protein determinations (data not shown) and Coomassie Blue staining (Fig. 2, Protein) of the transferred gels both showed that most of the membrane protein was in the dense fractions 8–13. The relative amount of the immunoblotted protein in the caveola/raft fraction (the sum of fractions 1–7) was then quantified by gel densitometry. Using caveolin-1 as a standard marker for caveolae/rafts, on average >74% of this protein was in this fraction (Fig. 2, Caveolin-1). By contrast, we found that the receptor for activated C kinase was excluded from the caveolin-rich fraction (Fig. 2, RACK-1). Only 27% of the LDLR was in fractions 1–7, but these fractions contained 63% of the EGFR. Importantly the LDLR was confined to a region in the middle of the gradient that overlapped with the densest population of caveolin-rich membranes (fractions 5–7), while the EGFR was enriched throughout fractions 1–7 just like caveolin-1. Previously we showed that a truncated EGFR containing only a 20-amino acid cytoplasmic segment was enriched in the caveolae/raft fraction (5Mineo C. Gill G.N. Anderson R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30636-30643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). We confirmed that the cytoplasmic region is not involved by constructing an EGFR with a Myc tag in place of the normal cytoplasmic tail (Fig. 1, construct 9). The fractionation pattern of this EGFR expressed in B82 cells was identical to the wild-type protein (Fig. 3 A, compareWT and NoCy). Therefore, targeting information for caveolae/rafts is either in the transmembrane or the extracellular region of the molecule. To distinguish between these possibilities, we expressed an EGFR that had the transmembrane segment replaced with the one from the LDL receptor (Fig. 1, construct 1 versus construct 2). Fractionation of the plasma membrane from these cells showed that swapping the transmembrane region had no effect on targeting the receptor to the caveolae/raft fractions (Fig. 3 A, compare WT with TMS). By contrast, swapping the EGFR and LDLR extracellular regions (Fig. 1,construct 5) shifted the EGFR hybrid molecule to the bulk membrane fractions (Fig. 3 A, L/E). We conclude that targeting of the EGFR to caveolae/rafts depends on information in the 615-amino acid-long extracellular domain of the receptor. There are 11 N-linked glycosylation sites in the extracellular region of EGFR (Fig. 1, WT) that collectively or individually could be involved in EGFR targeting to caveolae/rafts. We used tunicamycin to block glycosylation and then determine the distribution of the unglycosylated receptor in light and heavy membrane fractionations (Fig. 3 B). Cells were incubated in the presence (Tunica) or absence (Control) of tunicamycin (4 μg/ml) for 18 h, fractionated, and immunoblotted for EGFR. The EGFR from control cells had a normal fractionation pattern. Tunicamycin-treated cells, by contrast, had an EGFR band with the molecular weight of EGFR (Fig. 3 B, upper arrow) and a lower band that was the right size for unglycosylated EGFR (Fig. 3 B, lower arrow). The lower band was clearly shifted toward the dense membrane fraction relative to the upper band (compare upper and lower arrows). The turnover of the receptor apparently is too slow to replace completely the glycosylated species during the time course of this experiment. To circumvent this problem, we incubated cells in the presence of EGF to stimulate EGFR degradation before exposing the cells to tunicamycin. Nearly all of the receptors were unglycosylated and shifted toward the more dense, bulk membrane fractions (Fig. 3 B, EGF+ Tunica). These results confirm that the extracellular domain directs EGFR to caveolae/rafts and suggests that glycosylation plays a role in the targeting process. Most likely EGFR clustering in caveolae/rafts depends on a specific amino acid sequence in the extracellular region. To find the location of this sequence, we constructed EGF receptors that were missing specific segments of the molecule (Fig. 1). Previously we showed that an oncogenic form of EGFR (de7-2) that lacks the first 267 amino acids (Fig. 1, construct 3) was enriched in caveolae/rafts (5Mineo C. Gill G.N. Anderson R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30636-30643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Fig. 4 shows that B82 cells transfected with cDNA coding for either the wild-type or the de7-2 receptor had the same proportion of receptors in the caveolae/raft fraction (∼64%). By contrast, when we removed the 174-amino acid, cysteine-rich region between residues 639 and 465 just above the membrane-spanning region (Fig. 1, construct 6), nearly all of the receptors were shifted to the dense membrane fractions (Fig.4 A, NoCr2). Likewise, removal of the entire extracellular region (Fig. 1, construct 4) shifted the truncated receptor into the dense membrane fraction (Fig.4 A, NoX). An oncogenic form of the EGFR, v-ErB, is missing the first 580 amino acids (9Yamamoto T. Nishida T. Miyajima N. Kawai S. Ooi T. Toyoshima K. Cell. 1983; 35: 71-78Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 10Downward J. Yarden Y. Mayes E. Scrace G. Totty N. Stockwell P. Ullrich A. Schlessinger J.

Cell. 1985; 41: 719-726Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The remaining 60 extracellular amino acids (residues 581–641) have been designated the vX region. When we expressed the vX EGFR in B82 cells and prepared membrane fractions, its distribution was exactly like the wild-type receptor (Fig.4 A, compare WT with vX). A comparison with the distribution of the truncated (NoX) EGFR suggests the vX region is sufficient to target a membrane protein to caveolae/rafts. To determine whether this was correct, we constructed a cDNA coding for a protein that has the vX region attached to the transmembrane and cytoplasmic portions of the LDLR and expressed it in B82 cells (Fig. 1, construct 11). Fractionation of the plasma membrane showed that ∼75% of the protein was in the caveolae/raft fraction (Fig. 4 A, vXLDLR-myc). The same result was obtained when vX was attached to the transmembrane domain of EGFR (Fig. 4 A, vXTmCy-myc). Curiously, when we constructed a receptor with the vX region deleted (Fig. 1,construct 7), the mutant EGFR was equally distributed between heavy and light membrane fractions (Fig. 4 A, ΔvX). We conclude that although the vX region is sufficient for moving the transmembrane and cytoplasmic region of both EGFR and LDLR to caveolae/rafts, additional parts of the second cysteine-rich region may be needed to target the whole receptor. The vX region contains N-linked glycosylation sites at positions 603 and 623. We did two experiments to see whether these positions were part of the targeting machinery. We grew cells stably expressing vX EGFR in the presence (Fig. 4 B,Tunica) or absence (Control) of tunicamycin. Unlike the whole receptor (Fig. 3), the lower molecular weight unglycosylated vX EGFR (Fig. 4 B, lower arrow) was concentrated in caveolae/rafts to the same extent as both the glycosylated vX EGFR (Fig. 4 B, Tunica,upper arrow) and the vX EGFR from untreated cells (Fig.4 B, Control). Likewise, changing the two asparagines to glutamine had little effect on the localization of vX EGFR to the caveolae/raft fraction (Fig. 4 B, N to Q). The goal of this study was to identify the region within the EGFR that controls traffic of the receptor to caveolae/rafts in quiescent cells. Just as the cytoplasmic tail of occupied EGFR contains targeting information for coated pits (1Carpenter G. Bioessays. 2000; 22: 697-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar), we thought the unoccupied receptor should contain information for targeting to caveolae/rafts. We systematically deleted different regions of EGFR and analyzed the distribution of each mutant protein. In agreement with our previous observations (5Mineo C. Gill G.N. Anderson R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30636-30643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar), we could not find any requirement for the cytoplasmic tail (Fig. 3 A). By contrast, removal of the second cysteine-rich region quantitatively shifted EGFR to the bulk membrane fraction, and a 60-amino acid-long sequence within this region, designated vX, was sufficient to shift the transmembrane and cytoplasmic parts of EGFR from the bulk membrane to the caveolae/raft fraction. The vX region was also able to target the LDLR transmembrane and cytoplasmic tail to caveolae/rafts. We conclude that the vX region contains a molecular address for caveolae/rafts. The membrane fractionation protocol we used in these studies does not use detergents and can only determine whether EGF receptors are in plasma membrane caveolae/rafts. A popular method for isolating caveolae/rafts relies on the intrinsic insolubility of these domains in Triton X-100 at 4 °C (12Sargiacomo M. Sudol M. Tang Z. Lisanti M.P. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 789-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (860) Google Scholar, 13Brown D.A. Rose J.K. Cell. 1992; 68: 533-544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2604) Google Scholar), but we could not use this method because Triton X-100 extracts EGFR from caveolae/rafts. Detergent insolubility, however, has been used to identify two motifs that appear to be involved in the association of integral membrane proteins with caveolae/rafts during apical sorting from the Golgi apparatus of polarized cells. These are the transmembrane domains of influenza virus hemagglutinin (14Scheiffele P. Roth M.G. Simons K. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5501-5508Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar) and neuraminidase (15Barman S. Nayak D.P. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 6538-6545Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) and theO-glycosylation stalk of neurotrophin (16Monlauzeur L. Breuza L. Le Bivic A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30263-30270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 17Yeaman C., Le Gall A.H. Baldwin A.N. Monlauzeur L., Le Bivic A. Rodriguez-Boulan E. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 929-940Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar) and sucrase isomaltase (18Jacob R. Alfalah M. Grunberg J. Obendorf M. Naim H.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6566-6572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). These motifs seem not to be involved in the sorting of EGFR to plasma membrane caveolae/rafts because the transmembrane domain of the LDLR could substitute for the EGFR (Fig. 3 A), and EGFR does not have an O-glycosylation stalk. Importantly there is an O-glycosylation stalk in the juxtamembrane region of the LDLR extracellular domain, but apparently it cannot substitute for the EGFR extracellular domain (Fig.3 A). N-Glycosylation has also been implicated in raft-dependent apical sorting (19Scheiffele P. Peranen J. Simons K. Nature. 1995; 378: 96-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). We found a significant shift of unglycosylated EGFR from caveolae/rafts to the bulk membrane fraction when cells were incubated in the presence of tunicamycin, suggesting that glycosylation is important (Fig.3 B). Tunicamycin, however, had no effect on the ability of the vX EGFR construct to collect in caveolae/rafts. Moreover, mutating asparagine 603 and 623 to glutamine had no effect on vX EGFR targeting. The unglycosylated EGF receptors produced in the presence of tunicamycin may be misfolded (20Fernandes H. Cohen S. Bishayee S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5375-5383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) and, as a result, not targeted properly to caveolae/rafts. The common theme emerging from these studies is that the information for sorting to caveolae/rafts is not in the cytoplasmic tail of transmembrane receptors like EGFR but instead resides close to the extracellular side of the membrane. Both the vX region in EGFR and theO-glycosylation stalk in neurotrophin and sucrase isomaltase are continuous with the extracellular end of the transmembrane domain. Furthermore, the sorting information in the transmembrane domain of hemagglutinin has been localized to that portion in the extracellular half of the membrane (14Scheiffele P. Roth M.G. Simons K. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5501-5508Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar). The location of this sorting information raises the possibility that the mechanism of molecular capture by caveolae/rafts depends on an interaction between the sorting region of the protein and lipids enriched in the lipid domain. One class of lipids that is enriched is the sphingolipids. A combinatorial extension analysis of a 3-D structural data base has revealed a motif common to β-amyloid and prion, two proteins that are frequently found in caveolae/rafts (21Mahfoud R. Garmy N. Maresca M. Yahi N. Puigserver A. Fantini J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11292-11296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). This motif binds sphingolipids and is located near the membrane insertion site for these proteins. The same motif is also found in the V3 loop of human immunodeficiency virus gp120 where it mediates viral attachment to lipid domains. Although this motif has a similar 3-D structure in these three proteins, the primary sequences are not homologous. Further work will be required to determine whether the vX region binds sphingolipids and has a similar 3-D structure.

The EGFR kinase-specific compound PD158780 substantially diminished EGFR internalization. PP2, an inhibitor of SFK, had a moderate effect on EGFR internalization in several types of cells, including cells lacking SFK, indicating that the inhibition of endocytosis by PP2 is mediated by kinases other than SFK. In contrast, SU6656, a more specific inhibitor of SFK, did not affect EGFR internalization. To examine what stage of internalization requires receptor kinase activity, we established a quantitative assay based on three-dimensional fluorescence microscopy that measures co-localization of an EGF-rhodamine conjugate and a fluorescently tagged clathrin adaptor protein complex, AP-2. Interestingly, recruitment of EGFR into coated pits did not require physiological temperature because the maximal accumulation of EGFR in coated pits was observed at 4 °C. Pretreatment of the cells with PD158780 prevented EGFR recruitment into coated pits, whereas the inhibitor did not block the internalization of receptors that had first been allowed to enter the coated pits at 4 °C.

Cell. 2000; 103: 211-225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3482) Google Scholar). Tyrosine phosphorylation alters enzymatic activity of proteins or creates binding sites for proteins containing Src homology 2 and phosphotyrosine-binding domains. The initiation of multiple protein-protein interactions together with activation of various cytosolic enzymes ultimately transmutes into altered gene expression in the nucleus. Thus, tyrosine kinase activity plays an essential role in signal transduction by growth factors. Although “kinase-dead” EGFR mutants can mediate signaling by EGF (2Selva E. Raden D.L. Davis R.J. J.

A. 1994; 91: 6967-6971Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), this type of signaling appears to require heterodimerization of kinase-negative EGFR with ErbB2, subsequently resulting in activation of ErbB2 tyrosine kinase (4Ewald J.A.

Chem. 1995; 270: 12085-12093Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Furthermore, cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases, mainly kinases of the Src family (SFK), are also involved in EGFR signaling (6Biscardi J.S. Maa M.C. Tice D.A. Cox M.E. Leu T.H. Parsons S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8335-8343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar, 7Tice D.A. Biscardi J.S. Nickles A.L. Parsons S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1415-1420Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar).Concurrently with initiation of the signaling process, the activation of EGFR dramatically accelerates endocytosis of EGF-receptor complexes through clathrin-coated pits. This effect of EGF is particularly pronounced in cells expressing physiological levels of EGFR (8Lund K.A. Opresko L.K. Strarbuck C. Walsh B.J. Wiley H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15713-15723Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, in cells overexpressing EGFR, activated receptors can also be endocytosed in a coated pit-independent manner (with the slower kinetics) if the rapid coated pit pathway is saturated by the large number of EGF-occupied receptors (9Wiley H.S. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 801-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). After internalization through both pathways, EGFRs are efficiently sorted via endosomes to the lysosomal compartments where they are degraded by proteolytic enzymes. Accelerated internalization and lysosomal targeting result in down-regulation of EGFR, leading to attenuation of growth factor signaling.The molecular mechanisms of both rate-limiting steps of down-regulation, internalization via coated pits, and sorting to lysosomes remain elusive. Whereas definite advances have been made in elucidation of the role of receptor phosphorylation and ubiquitination in endosomal sorting of EGFR (10Levkowitz G. Waterman H. Ettenberg S.A. Katz M.

Yarden Y. FEBS Lett. 2001; 490: 142-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar), the role of tyrosine kinases in clathrin-mediated internalization is not understood. The low rates of internalization of the kinase-negative receptor mutants have been reported in several studies (8Lund K.A. Opresko L.K. Strarbuck C. Walsh B.J. Wiley H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15713-15723Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Chen W.S. Lazar C.S. Lund K.A. Welsh J.B. Chang C.P. Walton G.M. Der C.J. Wiley H.S. Gill G.N. Rosenfeld M.G.

Schmid S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 47-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that residual kinase-independent endocytosis is not mediated by clathrin-coated pits, although this hypothesis needs experimental proof (8Lund K.A. Opresko L.K. Strarbuck C. Walsh B.J. Wiley H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15713-15723Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Wiley H.S. Herbst J.J. Walsh B.J. Lauffenberger D.A. Rosenfeld M.G. Gill G.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11083-11094Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, EGFR activation of c-Src tyrosine kinase has been implicated in the regulation of clathrin-dependent endocytosis of the EGFR through the ability of Src to phosphorylate clathrin heavy chain (16Wilde A. Beattie E.C. Lem L. Reithof D.A. Liu S.-H. Mobley W.C. Soriano P. Brodsky F.M. Cell. 1999; 96: 1-20Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar).Given the importance of tyrosine phosphorylation in signaling by growth factors, specific inhibitors of tyrosine kinase activity are important tools for studying EGFR. The use of such inhibitors may be advantageous compared with the utilization of kinase-negative EGFR mutants for elucidation of the role of tyrosine kinase activity in endocytosis and signaling, because these compounds also inhibit highly homologous kinases of other ErbB proteins (17Bos M. Mendelsohn J. Kim Y.M. Albanell J. Fry D.W. Baselga J. Clin. Cancer Res. 1997; 3: 2099-2106PubMed Google Scholar). EGFR and other members of ErbB family are implicated in the pathogenesis of many types of cancer, and the inhibitors specific to these kinases have a considerable potential in cancer therapy (18Mendelsohn J. Baselga J. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 6550-6565Crossref PubMed Scopus (1207) Google Scholar). For instance, ZD1839 (IRESSA) is currently being tested in clinical trials (18Mendelsohn J. Baselga J. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 6550-6565Crossref PubMed Scopus (1207) Google Scholar, 19Dancey J.E. Schoenfeldt M. Oncology. 2001; 15 (, 756–748): 748-750PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the analysis of the effects of tyrosine kinase inhibitors on EGFR trafficking and signaling may provide important information about the mechanisms of inhibitor action on a cellular level and unravel new insights into the various aspects of EGFR function in vitro and in vivo.Here we compared the effects of EGFR and SFK inhibitors on EGFR internalization through clathrin-coated pits. The data indicated that the EGFR kinase activity is critical for EGFR internalization, whereas SFKs are not essential for EGFR endocytosis. In particular, receptor kinase activity seems to control the initial stages of endocytosis, specifically the recruitment of activated EGFR into coated pits.DISCUSSIONThe activation of intrinsic or associated tyrosine kinases is the key feature of the signal transduction process initiated by growth factor receptors, and the importance of kinase activity and tyrosine phosphorylation in growth factor-induced endocytosis of these receptors is predictable. Indeed, studies of endocytosis of kinase-negative mutants of EGFR and several other growth factor receptors suggested that kinase activity is necessary for the maximal rate of internalization and down-regulation (36Glenney J.R., Jr. Chen W.S.

Chem. 1994; 269: 17056-17061Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the exact role of tyrosine phosphorylation as well as the steps of the internalization process that require receptor activity are not well defined. For instance, internalization rates of kinase-negative mutants of EGFR and platelet-derived growth factor receptor β are higher than the minimal rates observed for certain truncated mutants of these receptors (13Wiley H.S.

In the case of EGFR, one possible explanation for these observations is that kinase-negative EGFR can trigger signals sufficient to maintain moderate endocytosis through the formation of heterodimers with endogenous ErbB2.Another approach to study the role of kinase activity in EGFR endocytosis is the use of specific inhibitors. This approach has two advantages. First, the inhibitors inactivate kinases of all ErbBs, thus preventing cross-phosphorylation of kinase-negative EGFR. Second, the cells expressing endogenous EGFR can be studied. Hence, we compared the effects of inhibitors of EGFR/ErbB and SFK on EGFR internalization. Genistein and lavendustin A, tyrosine kinase inhibitors of a broader specificity, were previously utilized to study EGFR endocytosis (15Lamaze C. Schmid S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 47-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar,43Onoda T. Isshiki K. Takeuchi T. Tatsuda K. Umezawa K. Drugs Exp. Clin. Res. 1990; 16: 249-253PubMed Google Scholar). However, these compounds had either a moderate effect on EGFR internalization or were not specific for EGFR, which also affected transferrin endocytosis (15Lamaze C. Schmid S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 47-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). We report here that PD158780 imposes a profound, rapid, and specific inhibition of EGF internalization in all types of cells tested. In contrast, inhibitors of SFK, PP2 and SU6656, had moderate or no effect, respectively, on EGF internalization under the conditions of our experiments. The experiments with PP2 exposed an inherent limitation of the inhibitory analysis: the possibility of nonspecific and indirect effects. PP2 and an analogous compound PP1 have been used in several studies of endocytosis, and the observed effects were attributed to c-Src (16Wilde A. Beattie E.C. Lem L. Reithof D.A. Liu S.-H. Mobley W.C. Soriano P. Brodsky F.M. Cell. 1999; 96: 1-20Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar, 44Ahn S. Maudsley S. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. Daaka Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1185-1188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). However, our experiments with SFK-null cells (Fig. 5) indicate that some inhibitory effects of PP2 and PP1 may not be mediated through the inhibition of c-Src.More than two decades of studies unveiled multiple pathways and mechanisms of EGFR endocytosis that involve various protein-protein interactions, which often cannot be reconciled. Likewise, our experiments showed that the Src-dependent pathway of endocytosis is redundant. Analysis of EGFR mutants (Fig. 7) showed that tyrosine phosphorylation of both the receptor itself and other cellular proteins might be involved in the coated pit internalization of the EGFR.In particular, the data rule out the indispensable roles of Tyr992, Tyr1148, and Tyr1173 and suggest that phosphorylation sites Tyr1068 and Tyr1086 and proteins interacting with these sites (c-Cbl and Grb2) might be important for internalization of the full-length receptor. Clearly, endocytosis of the truncated receptors (Dc165 and Dc164/992F) does not require these phosphotyrosines and is mediated by alternative mechanisms. It remains to be determined whether these alternative mechanisms are utilized by the full-length receptor or can be used only when the carboxyl terminus of the EGFR is truncated.Endocytosis of the Dc165 mutant has a kinase-dependent component and a kinase-independent residual component. Indeed, the inhibition of kinase activity of Dc165 receptor by either PD158780 (Fig. 7) or by mutational inactivation of the kinase (12Chen W.S. Lazar C.S. Lund K.A. Welsh J.B. Chang C.P. Walton G.M. Der C.J. Wiley H.S. Gill G.N. Rosenfeld M.G. Cell. 1989; 59: 33-43Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar) decreased the internalization rate to a similar level. We propose that this residual internalization may be mediated by cryptic signals that are exposed as the result of the carboxyl-terminal truncation. The sequence motifs, which function in kinase-independent manner, seem not be involved in endocytosis of the full-length receptor.Because PD158780 had the strongest impact on internalization, we use this compound to study the role of kinase activity at different steps of the clathrin-mediated process. To analyze the EGFR recruitment step, we performed quantitative analysis of the localization of EGF-Rh relative to coated pits labeled with β2-YFP within the entire cell. The use of direct fluorescence of labeled proteins circumvents problems arising from cell permeabilization and the use of immunodetection. A new generation of charged coupled device detection arrays with high sensitivity to red fluorescence and excellent linearity in the full range of signal intensity, combined with very low background noise, allows acquisition and quantitative analysis of three-dimensional images without significant photobleaching.Importantly, the sensitivity of the experimental system enabled us to use low concentrations of EGF-Rh, so that the specific pathway is not saturated, and the bulk of surface EGF-Rh/receptor complexes are capable of coated pit endocytosis. About 8% of EGF-Rh was located in coated pits under these conditions. This value is the result of the dynamic equilibrium between the pools of receptors moving between uncoated and coated areas of the membrane. It is, however, difficult to directly compare our data with the previous estimations of cargo localization in coated pits. To our knowledge, previous studies of EGFR clustering in coated pits using electron microscopy were performed mostly in A-431 cells and utilized high concentrations of EGF. Under these conditions a substantial pool of EGF-receptor complexes internalized through the clathrin-independent pathway (45Haigler H.T. McKanna J.A. Cohen S. J. Cell Biol. 1979; 81: 382-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). In contrast, autoradiography analysis in normal human fibroblasts expressing low levels of EGFR showed that 35% of 125I-EGF was located in coated pits (46Gorden P. Carpentier J.-L. Cohen S. Orci L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 5025-5029Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Studies of transferrin receptor yielded values that varied 6–15% (47Iacopetta B.J. Rothenberger S. Kuhn L.C. Cell. 1988; 54: 485-489Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 48Miller K. Shipman M. Trowbridge I.S. Hopkins C.R. Cell. 1991; 65: 621-632Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). In general, conventional electron microscopy techniques have substantial limitations in accounting for receptors diffusely dispersed in the plane of the membrane, in detection of flat clathrin lattices, and in the capability to provide quantitative data for the entire cell.Fluorescence microscopy analysis revealed that the accumulation of EGF-Rh in coated pits is dependent on tyrosine kinase activity but does not require physiological temperature (Fig. 3). Internalization is completely blocked at 4 °C, and it has been generally assumed that effective clustering of cargo in coated pits also requires 37 °C. For instance, the amount of EGFR co-purified with coated vesicles was negligible at 4 °C but dramatically increased at 37 °C (31Hanover J.A. Willingham M.C. Pastan I. Cell. 1984; 39: 283-293Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The nature of this temperature dependence is not understood. The EGFR is fully activated, highly phosphorylated, and capable of interacting with most of its effectors at 4 °C. The lateral mobility of EGFR is only three times slower at 5 °C than at 37 °C, which allows every receptor in the cell to reach a coated pit in less than 3 s (49Hillman G.M. Schlessinger J. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 1667-1672Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). One explanation for the results obtained in biochemical studies (31Hanover J.A. Willingham M.C. Pastan I. Cell. 1984; 39: 283-293Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) is that the immunoabsorbed coated vesicles may correspond to the budding pits and vesicles formed after the initial recruitment step at temperature-dependent stages of the endocytic process. Our results are in strong agreement with the first electron microscopy study of EGF endocytosis in fibroblasts in which 125I-EGF was detected into coated pits at 4 °C (46Gorden P. Carpentier J.-L. Cohen S. Orci L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 5025-5029Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar).The observation that kinase activity controls the initial step of EGFR recruitment in coated pits is consistent with the earlier data suggesting that constitutively internalized receptors can be found in the same coated pit with activated EGFR and are then internalized in the same coated vesicle (29Carpentier J.-L. Gorden P. Anderson R.G.W. Brown M.S. Cohen S. Orci L. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 95: 73-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 31Hanover J.A. Willingham M.C. Pastan I. Cell. 1984; 39: 283-293Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Our data, therefore, support the notion that the rate-limiting and EGF-dependent step of induced internalization is the recruitment of receptors into coated pits. Another view on endocytosis of the EGFR is that the receptor activity leading to, for instance, tyrosine phosphorylation of Eps15, is necessary for coated vesicle budding (50Confalonieri S. Salcini A.E. Puri C. Tacchetti C. Di Fiore P.P. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 905-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). This model predicts the existence of “specialized” coated pits for EGFR, because in a “common” coated pit, EGF-triggered events would regulate endocytosis of all cargoes present in the same pit, in addition to the regulation of EGFR endocytosis. However, no effect of EGF on endocytosis of transferrin receptors was observed (9Wiley H.S. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 801-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Even though the formation of specialized coated pits could not be ruled out, our results suggest that the late stages of coated vesicle formation do not require the preservation of EGFR phosphorylation and kinase activity and therefore do not depend on its interactions with proteins, such as Grb2 or Cbl. It is possible, however, that in our experiments, certain proteins important for vesicle formation are phosphorylated at 4 °C and remain to be phosphorylated during the treatment of cells with the EGFR inhibitors, thus allowing coated vesicles to bud independently of receptor kinase activity. The analysis of the coated pit recruitment process in living cells is in progress to determine whether EGFR are recruited into preexisting coated pits or EGF stimulation leads to formation of new coats. Binding of epidermal growth factor (EGF)1 or other ligands to EGF receptors (EGFR) on the cell surface triggers activation of the receptor tyrosine kinase, which results in phosphorylation of the tyrosine residues in EGFR carboxyl terminus and other cellular proteins (1Schlessinger J. Cell. 2000; 103: 211-225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3482) Google Scholar). Tyrosine phosphorylation alters enzymatic activity of proteins or creates binding sites for proteins containing Src homology 2 and phosphotyrosine-binding domains. The initiation of multiple protein-protein interactions together with activation of various cytosolic enzymes ultimately transmutes into altered gene expression in the nucleus. Thus, tyrosine kinase activity plays an essential role in signal transduction by growth factors. Although “kinase-dead” EGFR mutants can mediate signaling by EGF (2Selva E. Raden D.L. Davis R.J. J.

A. 1994; 91: 6967-6971Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), this type of signaling appears to require heterodimerization of kinase-negative EGFR with ErbB2, subsequently resulting in activation of ErbB2 tyrosine kinase (4Ewald J.A.

Furthermore, cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases, mainly kinases of the Src family (SFK), are also involved in EGFR signaling (6Biscardi J.S. Maa M.C. Tice D.A. Cox M.E. Leu T.H. Parsons S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8335-8343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar, 7Tice D.A. Biscardi J.S. Nickles A.L. Parsons S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1415-1420Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). Concurrently with initiation of the signaling process, the activation of EGFR dramatically accelerates endocytosis of EGF-receptor complexes through clathrin-coated pits. This effect of EGF is particularly pronounced in cells expressing physiological levels of EGFR (8Lund K.A. Opresko L.K. Strarbuck C. Walsh B.J. Wiley H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15713-15723Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, in cells overexpressing EGFR, activated receptors can also be endocytosed in a coated pit-independent manner (with the slower kinetics) if the rapid coated pit pathway is saturated by the large number of EGF-occupied receptors (9Wiley H.S. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 801-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). After internalization through both pathways, EGFRs are efficiently sorted via endosomes to the lysosomal compartments where they are degraded by proteolytic enzymes. Accelerated internalization and lysosomal targeting result in down-regulation of EGFR, leading to attenuation of growth factor signaling. The molecular mechanisms of both rate-limiting steps of down-regulation, internalization via coated pits, and sorting to lysosomes remain elusive. Whereas definite advances have been made in elucidation of the role of receptor phosphorylation and ubiquitination in endosomal sorting of EGFR (10Levkowitz G. Waterman H. Ettenberg S.A. Katz M.

Yarden Y. FEBS Lett. 2001; 490: 142-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar), the role of tyrosine kinases in clathrin-mediated internalization is not understood. The low rates of internalization of the kinase-negative receptor mutants have been reported in several studies (8Lund K.A. Opresko L.K. Strarbuck C. Walsh B.J. Wiley H.S. J. Biol.

Chem. 1992; 267: 8672-8678Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These mutants have also been shown to inefficiently sequester in coated pits in in vitroendocytosis assays (15Lamaze C. Schmid S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 47-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that residual kinase-independent endocytosis is not mediated by clathrin-coated pits, although this hypothesis needs experimental proof (8Lund K.A. Opresko L.K. Strarbuck C. Walsh B.J. Wiley H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15713-15723Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Wiley H.S. Herbst J.J. Walsh B.J. Lauffenberger D.A. Rosenfeld M.G. Gill G.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11083-11094Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, EGFR activation of c-Src tyrosine kinase has been implicated in the regulation of clathrin-dependent endocytosis of the EGFR through the ability of Src to phosphorylate clathrin heavy chain (16Wilde A. Beattie E.C. Lem L. Reithof D.A. Liu S.-H. Mobley W.C. Soriano P. Brodsky F.M. Cell. 1999; 96: 1-20Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Given the importance of tyrosine phosphorylation in signaling by growth factors, specific inhibitors of tyrosine kinase activity are important tools for studying EGFR. The use of such inhibitors may be advantageous compared with the utilization of kinase-negative EGFR mutants for elucidation of the role of tyrosine kinase activity in endocytosis and signaling, because these compounds also inhibit highly homologous kinases of other ErbB proteins (17Bos M. Mendelsohn J. Kim Y.M. Albanell J. Fry D.W. Baselga J. Clin. Cancer Res. 1997; 3: 2099-2106PubMed Google Scholar). EGFR and other members of ErbB family are implicated in the pathogenesis of many types of cancer, and the inhibitors specific to these kinases have a considerable potential in cancer therapy (18Mendelsohn J. Baselga J. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 6550-6565Crossref PubMed Scopus (1207) Google Scholar). For instance, ZD1839 (IRESSA) is currently being tested in clinical trials (18Mendelsohn J. Baselga J.

A variety of proteins have been identified within the junctional complex; they include integral membrane proteins (such as claudins, occludin, and E-cadherin), signaling molecules (protein kinase C, Src tyrosine kinases, small G proteins, and heterotrimeric Gα subunits), and potential scaffolding proteins (ZO-1, ZO-2, and ZO-3; for reviews, see Refs. 1Denker B.M.

The ZO proteins are multidomain MAGUK (membrane-associated guanylate kinase) family members that contain a potential guanylate kinase domain, multiple PDZ domains, and a SH3 domain (see Fig. 1). Although ZO-1 is expressed in multiple cell types, in epithelial cells it is localized only in the tight junction, the most apical component of the junctional complex. The two related family members, ZO-2 and ZO-3, form a complex with ZO-1 in the TJ and link to the actin cytoskeleton (3Wittchen E.S. Haskins J. Stevenson B.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35179-35185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). The function of ZO proteins in regulating the junction is unknown, but based upon their domain structure, they have been proposed to be scaffolding proteins (4Itoh M. Furuse M. Morita K. Kubota K. Saitou M. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 1351-1363Crossref PubMed Scopus (915) Google Scholar).

Regulation of the junctional complex by heterotrimeric G proteins was suggested in early experiments (5Balda M.S. Gonzalez-Mariscal L. Contreras R.G. Macias-Silva M. Torres-Marquez M.E.

Subsequent studies have demonstrated that pertussis toxin-sensitive family members, Gαi2 and Gαo, localize in the tight junction of Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells and affect both tight junction assembly and base-line properties (6Denker B.M.

However, to date, there has been no direct demonstration of an interaction between G protein signaling molecules and TJ proteins. Utilizing in vitro binding studies and inducible expression in MDCK cells, we demonstrate that Gα12 directly binds to ZO-1 through the SH3 domain and that activated Gα12 regulates paracellular permeability. cDNAs for mouse wild-type α12(wtα12) and constitutively active α12(Q229L) QLα12 were provided by Henry Bourne (University of California, San Francisco), Gα13 was provided by D.

Tet-Off MDCK cells were cultured as described by Jou et al. (12Jou T.S. Nelson W.J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Cells were transfected using linearized plasmid and pTK-Hyg with FuGENE 6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Resistant clones were maintained in medium containing 100 μg/ml hygromycin, 100 μg/ml G418, and 40 ng/ml doxycycline. Subsequent experiments were carried out in medium without hygromycin and G418 and with or without doxycycline. Gα12- and QLα12-transfected Tet-Off MDCKcells were grown to confluency with or without doxycycline for specific times.

Antibodies against ZO-1 (rat) or Gα12 (rabbit) were added to the lysate overnight at 4 °C. Beads were washed with buffer B, and proteins were eluted in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Western blot analysis using chemiluminescence detection (Pierce) was performed as described previously (13Meyer T.N. Schwesinger C., Ye, J. Denker B.M. Nigam S.K. J. Biol.

MDCK cells were plated on polycarbonate filters (Transwell, Costar) at confluent density (∼2 × 105cells/cm2), and TER was measured at different time points using a Millipore ERS electrical resistance system. Measurements are expressed in ohm × cm2 as a mean of the original readings after subtraction of background values. Paracellular flux was measured as described previously (14Sanders S.E. Madara J.L. McGuirk D.K. Gelman D.S. Colgan S.P. Epithelial Cell Biol. 1995; 4: 25-34PubMed Google Scholar) using cells cultured on Transwell filters for 3 days with or without doxycycline. FITC-labeled 70-kDa dextran (concentration, 3.5 μm; Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) was added into the apical chamber, and aliquots were taken from the lower chamber after 20, 40, and 60 min. FITC-dextran concentrations were determined using a fluorescent plate reader and standard curves (excitation, 485 nm; emission, 530 nm; Cytofluor 2300, Millipore Corp., Waters Chromatography, Bedford, MA) as described previously (14Sanders S.E.

The function(s) for multiple ZO proteins within the TJ is unknown, but other PDZ family members have been shown to provide a scaffold for signaling complexes.

FEBS Lett. 1996; 399: 326-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 18Balda M.S. Matter K. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2024-2033Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar, 19Stuart R.O. Nigam S.K. Proc.

To address whether heterotrimeric Gα subunits can directly interact with ZO-1 or ZO-2, we tested whether GST fusion proteins of Gαs, Gαi2, Gαq, Gα12, or Gα13 could interact with in vitro translated ZO-1 and ZO-2. We found that only GST-Gα12 consistently interacted with ZO-1 and ZO-2 in pull-down experiments (Fig.1 A). The failure to detect an interaction with the other Gα subunits could result from conformational constraints of fusion proteins or differences in protein stability. To confirm the Gα12/ZO-1 interaction and identify the ZO-1 domain interacting with Gα12, we testedin vitro translated Gα12 and QLα12 for interaction with a series of GST fusion proteins containing various regions of ZO-1 (kindly provided by M. Balda, University of London). Fig. 1 B shows ZO-1 domain structure and GST fusion proteins A–F. Fig. 1 C compares the binding of in vitro translated Gα12, QLα12, Gαi2, and Gα13 with GST alone, A fusion protein (amino acids 295–633, containing PDZ3 and SH3 domains), and B fusion protein (PDZ3 domain only). There was no detectable interaction of the in vitro translated Gα subunits with GST alone or the PDZ3 domain (Fig. 1 C, B fusion protein). When normalized to the starting material, the A fusion protein interacted significantly better with Gα12 and QLα12 (>10% bound, n = 3) than with Gα13 or Gαi2 (<1%). We next tested Gα12 and QLα12 for interactions with C, D, E, and F fusion proteins and found that both Gα12subunits interacted with C and D GST fusion proteins, but there was no significant interaction with F fusion protein or with GST alone (Fig.1 D). In these experiments with in vitrotranslated proteins, we did not detect interactions with the E fusion protein (SH3). However, when these GST binding experiments were repeated with lysates from Gα12 expressed in MDCK cells, there was a readily detectable interaction with the SH3 (E fusion protein) domain (see Fig. 2 D). Gα12 proteins expressed in vitro may have a lower affinity for ZO-1 than proteins expressed in cells due to the absence of lipid modifications. To see whether SH3 domains from other proteins could interact with Gα12, we tested GST-SH3 domains from several other proteins (kindly provided by Dr. Bruce Mayer) and found no detectable interactions with in vitrotranslated Gα12 (Fig. 1 E). Gα12 is difficult to study in cells due to its low levels of expression. Therefore, we established a model system in MDCK cells. Similar to other reports (12Jou T.S. Nelson W.J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 20Jou T.S. Schneeberger E.E. Nelson W.J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 101-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar), we utilized Tet-Off inducible MDCK cell lines to express wtα12 and QLα12. wtα12 and QLα12 proteins were expressed within 24–48 h after the removal of doxycycline (Fig. 2 A). Protein levels remained constant for up to 10 days in the absence of doxycycline, and expression of Gα12 proteins could be resuppressed within 48 h with the readdition of doxycycline (not shown). Gα12 had previously been demonstrated to co-localize with ZO-1 in MDCK cells by confocal microscopy (16Dodane V. Kachar B. J. Membr. Biol. 1996; 149: 199-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Endogenous Gα12 was barely detectable by Western blot and confocal microscopy in the presence of doxycycline (Fig. 2,A and panels a and e in B), but after 48 h of Gα12 expression (−dox) there was co-localization with ZO-1 in the TJ (Fig. 2 B, panels b and d). Expression of QLα12 in MDCK cells resulted in an altered cell phenotype and a complex staining pattern for QLα12 and ZO-1 (Fig. 2 B,panels f and h). Some QLα12 was localized intracellularly, and this could occur from overexpression and/or reduced affinity for the plasma membrane. Although the staining patterns of QLα12 and ZO-1 were different, there appeared to be partial overlap in the lateral margins of the cell. Consistent with this observation, immunoprecipitation of Gα12 from both wild-type and QL-expressing cells co-precipitated ZO-1 (Fig.2 C). In the absence of Gα12 expression (+dox) or with no added antibody (Fig. 2 C, last lane) there was no detectable ZO-1. The expression levels of ZO-1 were not affected by wtα12 or QLα12 expression (determined by Western blot, not shown), and the increased immunoreactivity in QL lysates was unique to this experiment. We next utilized the ZO-1-GST fusion proteins (Fig. 1 B) and Western blots to determine whether wtα12 or QLα12expressed in MDCK cells could bind to specific ZO-1 domains. The ZO-1 SH3 domain (E fusion protein) was capable of binding to both wtα12 and QLα12 from cell lysates prepared from −dox cells (Fig. 2 D). Identical to the in vitro results (Fig. 1), the B and F fusion proteins did not interact (not shown), and GST alone was negative (Fig. 2 D). These results indicate that the SH3 domain is sufficient for interactions with Gα12 but do not exclude contributions from other ZO-1 domains. The disrupted appearance of ZO-1 in the lateral membrane of QLα12-expressing MDCK cells (Fig. 2 B) suggested that barrier function might be altered in these cells. To address this question, we measured TER and paracellular flux. Base-line TER was comparable in MDCK Tet-Off cells, uninduced wtα12, and QLα12 MDCK cell lines (Fig.3 A, +dox atT = 0). There was some variability in base-line TER as seen with the two sets of QLα12 cells atT = 0, but this was comparable to other reports (20Jou T.S. Schneeberger E.E. Nelson W.J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 101-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Expression of wtα12 protein resulted in a small decrease in TER after 24 h but remained nearly identical to Tet-Off MDCK cells throughout the remainder of the experiment (Fig. 3 A,open and closed squares). Although we cannot exclude a subtle role for overexpressing wtα12 on the junction, these effects did not correlate with wtα12protein expression (±dox). However, inducing QLα12expression consistently caused a significant fall in TER to ∼25 ohm × cm2 within 48 h (Fig. 3 A,n = 7). This fall in TER was reversible as switching to +dox medium resulted in TER returning to normal over the next 24–48 h. There was a brief “overshoot” of base-line TER during TJ formation in QLα12 MDCK cells similar to what is typically observed during TJ assembly (21Gonzalez-Mariscal L. Contreras R.G. Bolivar J.J. Ponce A. Chavez de Ramirez B. Cereijido M. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 259: C978-C986Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The decrease in TER was sustained in QLα12 MDCK cells if doxycycline remained absent but could be reversed at any time by the readdition of doxycycline (not shown). We also measured paracellular flux of 70-kDa FITC-dextran in both Gα12 MDCK cell lines cultured ± doxycycline for 3 days (Fig. 3 B). Induction of QLα12 expression led to a greater than 3-fold increase in flux rate (12.8 ± 1.5–40.3 ± 10.4 pmol/min × cm2,n = 7), while there was no significant change in wtα12 MDCK cells ± doxycycline (6.5 ± 1.4versus 9.4 ± 2.5 pmol/min × cm2,n = 7, Fig. 2 B, left panel). As an additional control, we counted trypan blue-positive cells in QLα12 monolayers ± doxycycline and found no significant difference. Taken together, these results indicate that expression of QLα12, but not wtα12, reversibly increases paracellular permeability, and these observations are consistent with the changes in ZO-1 staining pattern seen in QLα12-expressing cells. In recent years, the identification of integral membrane proteins in the TJ has resulted in significant progress toward understanding the structural features of the barrier. Claudins are essential for barrier function (2Tsukita S. Furuse M. Itoh M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 285-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (2060) Google Scholar) and for paracellular regulation of specific ions (22Simon D.B., Lu, Y. Choate K.A. Velazquez H., Al- Sabban E. Praga M. Casari G.

Activation and overexpression of protein kinase C isoforms or monomeric G proteins results in disruption of junctions and increased leakiness in kidney epithelial cells (12Jou T.S. Nelson W.J. J.

Rosson D. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: C544-C554Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, we have previously shown that activated Gαi2 and Gαs increase base-line TER in MDCK cells (7Saha C. Nigam S.K. Denker B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21629-21633Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 8Saha C. Nigam S.K. Denker B.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 285: 250-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The finding that activation of Gα12 lowers TER and increases paracellular permeability raises the possibility that multiple G proteins function in concert to regulate base-line TJ properties. For the first time, we have demonstrated that ZO-1 directly interacts with a G protein α subunit and propose that ZO-1 functions to scaffold Gα12. ZO proteins may organize signaling complexes within a discrete membrane microdomain, the TJ. Considering the complex signaling pathways that regulate the TJ, we would suggest that there are likely to be other direct interactions between signaling proteins and ZO proteins. We show that Gα12 can also interact with ZO-2 (Fig. 1 A), and other lower affinity interactions may not have been detected. The finding that wtα12 and QLα12 interact similarly with ZO-1 suggests that the interaction is independent of Gα12conformation and supports the notion that ZO-1 scaffolds Gα12. Although we cannot exclude the possibility that ZO-1 directly regulates Gα12, we found that the GST-ZO-1-A fusion protein (Fig. 1 B) has no effect on GTPγS binding to Gα12. 2B. Denker, unpublished observation. The mechanism(s) for Gα12 regulation of paracellular properties within the TJ and the role of the interaction with ZO-1 remain to be determined. One possibility is that through its interaction with ZO-1, Gα12 is placed within close proximity to other regulatory proteins that also bind to ZO-1. Our experiments were not designed to distinguish between a role for the ZO-1/Gα12 interaction and other possible Gα12 downstream signaling pathways (such as through Rho). Gα13 (67% amino acid identity to Gα12), did not interact with ZO-1 or ZO-2. Since Gα13 shares some downstream pathways with Gα12, a comparison of Gα13 and Gα12 cell lines may permit us to distinguish the role of ZO-1 binding from other mechanisms regulating the junction. Our results indicate that the SH3 domain of ZO-1 is sufficient for binding to Gα12, and there may be a putative Gα12 binding motif contained within the ZO-1 SH3 domain. The cytoplasmic domain of E-cadherin binds to Gα12 and Gα13, and although E-cadherin is expressed in the adherens junction, this interaction regulates association of the transcriptional activator β-catenin (30Meigs T.E. Fields T.A. McKee D.D. Casey P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 519-524PubMed Google Scholar). Recently a cluster of charged amino acids within the C-terminal domain of E-cadherin has been shown to be required for Gα12 binding (amino acids 854–864, Ref. 31Kaplan D.D. Meigs T.E. Casey P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44037-44043Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Comparison of these amino acids with the SH3 domain of ZO-1 identifies a highly conserved group of charged residues at amino acids 514–518 (EX(D/E)K(D/E)). The SH3 domain of ZO-2 contains an identical sequence, and ZO-2 also binds to Gα12 (Fig. 1 A). However, the SH3 domain of ZO-3 is lacking the last two charged amino acids, and we were unable to detect an interaction of in vitro translated ZO-3 with Gα12 (results not shown). Finally, a recent report identified an interaction between Gα12 and Hsp90, and Hsp90 also contains this identical cluster of charged residues (32Vaiskunaite R. Kozasa T. Voyno-Yasenetskaya T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46088-46093Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Other motifs have also been identified for Gα12 binding (33Jiang Y., Ma, W. Wan Y. Kozasa T. Hattori S. Huang X.Y. Nature. 1998; 395: 808-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Taken together, these findings support a scaffolding function for ZO-1 and suggest a similar role for ZO-2 and ZO-3 within the TJ. Unraveling the specific connections between ZO proteins and other signaling molecules will help provide the keys to understanding TJ regulation. We are indebted to Dr. Maria S. Balda (University of London) and Dr. Bruce Mayer (Children's Hospital) for sharing ZO-1 and SH3 constructs, respectively. We thank Michelle Lowe for excellent technical assistance with the confocal microscope and Sean Colgan for help with the flux measurements."

Two experimental systems have been used extensively: vertebrate (chick, zebrafish, and mouse) embryos have been used to define the signals involved in patterning and commitment of cells during embryonic muscle development (1Cossu G.

Particularly important has been the identification of four basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors (myogenic regulatory factors (MRFs))1 that were able to force non-myogenic cells into a myogenic lineage in vitro (MyoD, myf5, myogenin, and MRF4) (4Davis R.L.

Studies have included definition of binding partners, binding site sequences (E-boxes), downstream target promoters, modulation by acetylation, and timing of expression during development and differentiation, bothin vivo and in vitro (8Puri P.L. Sartorelli V. J. Cell. Physiol. 2000; 185: 155-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). The most extensively studied MRF is MyoD. MyoD binding sites have been defined in a series of downstream target muscle genes, where either single binding sites of variable affinity or multiple cooperative binding sites have been defined (9Weintraub H. Davis R. Lockshon D. Lassar A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5623-5627Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 10Wentworth B.M. Donoghue M. Engert J.C. Berglund E.B. Rosenthal N.

Chem. 2001; 276: 20719-20726Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). MyoD forms hetero- or homodimers with E proteins and has been shown to bind specific sequences known as E-boxes (CAnnTG) (13Buskin J.N. Hauschka S.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 2627-2640Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). E-boxes have been found in the promoters of many skeletal muscle-specific genes, and they mediate gene activation in the presence of MyoD (14Rudnicki M.A. Jaenisch R. Bioessays. 1995; 17: 203-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). More recent studies have begun to define chromatin remodeling induced by MyoD binding (requiring SWI/SNF complexes) (15de la Serna I.L. Carlson K.A. Imbalzano A.N. Nat.

Sartorelli V. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 885-897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). In addition, MyoD transcriptional complexes can be modulated by MAPK signaling, specifically MEK1, although this does not involve direct phosphorylation of MyoD (23Perry R.L. Parker M.H. Rudnicki M.A. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 291-301Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Although cultured cell transfection experiments have suggested binding site selection for MyoD and the other MRFs based on differential activation of downstream targets during overexpression of these factors, these have not led to the definition of discriminatory sequences that dictate specific MRF protein binding at specific target genes during myogenic development (24Blackwell T.K. Weintraub H. Science. 1990; 250: 1104-1110Crossref PubMed Scopus (759) Google Scholar, 25Liu S. Spinner D.S. Schmidt M.M. Danielsson J.A. Wang S. Schmidt J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 41365-41368Google Scholar). Indeed, it has also become clear that both the transcription factors and DNA target sequences are promiscuous, with MyoD, myf-5, and myogenin all capable of binding the same downstream target promoter in differentiating cultured myogenic cells by chromatin immunoprecipitation assays (25Liu S. Spinner D.S. Schmidt M.M. Danielsson J.A. Wang S. Schmidt J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 41365-41368Google Scholar). Likewise, recent dominant-negative fusion construct studies have shown that the protein binding partner selection of MyoD and myogenin in vitro may not reflect binding preference in vivo, despite co-expression of the factors in the myogenic cells under study (26Becker J.R. Dorman C.M. McClafferty T.M. Johnson S.E. Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 267: 135-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Murine knock-outs of the MRF genes have provided an additional perspective in defining the roles of MyoD and others.MyoD knock-outs show relatively little overt phenotype, which has been interpreted as being indicative of functional redundancy of the MRFs (27Rudnicki M.A. Braun T. Hinuma S. Jaenisch R. Cell. 1992; 71: 383-390Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (760) Google Scholar). However, MyoD−/− animals show defective myogenic differentiation in culture and slowed regeneration of skeletal muscle in vivo (28Megeney L.A. Kablar B. Garrett K. Anderson J.E. Rudnicki M.A. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1173-1183Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar, 29Yablonka-Reuveni Z. Rudnicki M.A. Rivera A.J. Primig M. Anderson J.E. Natanson P. Dev.

Cytochem. 2000; 48: 1531-1544Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The phenotype of MyoDknock-out muscle and cultured cells has been difficult to integrate with the DNA/protein interaction data into a specific molecular genetic pathway, perhaps because MyoD may have different roles in embryonic development, muscle maturation, and differentiation in cultured cells. The specific hierarchy of MRFs and co-regulatory proteins (sonic hedgehog family, MEFs, E proteins, and others) has been similarly difficult to dissect in studies of embryogenesis. AlthoughMyoD clearly seems to be regulated by sonic hedgehog, Wnt factors, and other signals, it is not known how MyoDtranscription is initiated and maintained by these signals (33Chen J.C. Love C.M. Goldhamer D.J. Dev. Dyn. 2001; 221: 274-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). For example, in zebrafish knock-outs for sonic hedgehog, MyoD, and myf5 seem to be appropriately expressed initially, but then maintenance of expression is sustained in some regions but not others (3Coutelle O. Blagden C.S. Hampson R. Halai C. Rigby P.W. Hughes S.M. Dev. Biol. 2001; 236: 136-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Muscle tissue, and the constituent terminally differentiated muscle fibers, are able to regenerate after damage. The regeneration process is known to re-capitulate many of the features of myogenic development, with activation of myogenic stem cells (satellite cells), proliferation, differentiation, and fusion of these cells into myotubes, and then maturation into the large syncytial myofibers. Studies of MRFs during muscle regeneration in vivo have shown clear temporal patterns of expression, which correlate with the differentiation state of the cells in the regenerating muscle (34Cooper R.N. Tajbakhas S. Mouly V. Cossu G. Buckingham M. Butler-Browne G.S. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 2895-2901Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 35Launay T. Armand A.S. Charbonnier F. Mira J.C. Donsez E. Gallien C.L. Chanoine C. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 2001; 49: 887-899Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Thus, staged regeneration of muscle serves as a model for cell commitment, differentiation, and maturation. We sought to dissect the likely highly complex cascade of transcription factors and downstream targets using a more global, non-“candidate gene” approach. Dissection of novel transcriptional pathways has been accomplished in yeast by staging yeast cultures, exposing the cultures to a specific stimulus, and then conducting temporal expression profiling (microarrays) to define coordinately regulated genes (36Eisen M.B. Spellman P.T. Brown P.O. Botstein D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 95: 14863-14868Crossref Scopus (13231) Google Scholar,37Tavazoie S. Hughes J.D. Campbell M.J. Cho R.J. Church G.M. Nat. Genet. 1998; 22: 281-285Crossref Scopus (1969) Google Scholar). However, such studies have not yet been reported in higher organisms, presumably due to the difficulty in staging mammalian cellsin vivo, and the greater cellular and molecular complexity of experimental systems. Importantly, the sensitivity of human expression profiling resources is quickly approaching that of yeast, with a two-chip set containing every transcription unit in the human genome to be released shortly. 2Affymetrix, personal communication. Increasingly accurate bioinformatic-driven probe design and synthesis, the correlation of expressed sequence tag databases with genomic data, and the use of a high level of redundancy in testing of each transcript unit serve to make emerging oligonucleotide-based GeneChips quite sensitive and specific tools. We hypothesized that staged induction of muscle degeneration in murine muscle and expression profiling of specific time points during regeneration would allow us to define coordinately expressed genes and, thereby, define novel downstream targets of MyoD. Here, we report the successful identification of novel downstream targets of MyoD using this global genomics approach and show that one of the novel downstream targets, Slug, is necessary for appropriate muscle regeneration. These data also provide the first intersection between two important transcriptional pathways, namely the bHLH MRF pathway, and the snail/Slug developmental pathway. The publicly available transcription profiles can be used to define the temporal clusters for any transcription factor and downstream target and should greatly assist in the definition of the in vivo gene pathways for a popular experimental system for studying molecular development. Staged skeletal muscle degeneration/regeneration was induced by injection of cardiotoxin into mouse gastrocnemius muscle. Injection was done by using a custom injection manifold, Microlab 500 series (Hamilton), which has 10 needles in a 1-cm2 area. Two-month-old C57BL10 mice (JAX mice, Bar Harbor, ME) were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of xylazine (7 mg/kg body weight) and ketamine HCl (70 mg/kg body weight). Each muscle was injected with 100 μl of 10 mm cardiotoxin (Calbiochem). Both contralateral gastrocnemius muscles were injected. Two mice were injected and then sacrificed at each of the following time points: time 0 (no injection), 12 h, day 1, day 2, day 4, and day 10. Gastrocnemius muscles were carefully dissected at tendon insertion points and flash-frozen in isopentane cooled in liquid nitrogen. Thus, four muscles were harvested at each time point. Each muscle was examined histologically in the belly (center) of the muscle. Cryosections (8 μm) were cut using an IEC Minotome cryostat, collected on Superfrost Plus slides (Fisher Scientific), and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. At each time point, two of the four muscles showing the most extensive and consistent histological changes were used for expression profiling on individual GeneChips. Selected gastrocnemius muscles were homogenized in guanidinium thiocyanate homogenization buffer (4.0m guanidinium thiocyanate, 0.1 m Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 1% β-mercaptoethanol) using a Polytron homogenizer (Brinkmann Instruments). Total RNA was extracted by centrifuging the homogenate at 25,000 rpm for 24 h in a CsCl cushion (5.7 m CsCl, 0.01 m EDTA, pH 7.5). Double-stranded cDNA was synthesized from 8 μg of total RNA using SuperScript Choice system (Invitrogen) and T7-(dT24) primer (Geneset Corp). cDNA was purified using a Phase Lock Gel (Eppendorf-5 Prime). Biotin-labeled cRNA was then synthesized from double-stranded cDNA by in vitro transcription using a BioArray HighYield RNA transcript labeling kit (Affymetrix). cRNA was purified using an RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen), fragmented, and hybridized to Murine Genome U74A version 1 chips for 16 h. GeneChips were then washed and stained on the Affymetrix Fluidics Station 400 following protocols of Affymetrix. Staining images were read using the Hewlett-Packard G2500A Gene Array Scanner and stored in an Affymetrix Microarray Laboratory Information Management System. Gene lists with -fold changes at each time point are available on our web site (microarray.cnmcresearch.org, Programs in Genomic Applications). More detailed descriptions of methods for generating gene lists are also on the website (microarray.cnmcresearch.org/programs in genomic application). All image files (.dat) and absolute analysis files (.chip) corresponding to each expression profile are also available on our website. Primary data analysis was done using Affymetrix Microarray Suite 4.0. This includes absolute analysis and comparison analysis. Absolute analysis calculates the intensity of the hybridization signals from a single array and determines whether a transcript is present or absent in the sample based on hybridization of 16–20 perfect match and mismatch probe pairs for each gene under study. Comparison analysis compares signals from two probe arrays and assigns a difference call to each transcript that indicates expression changes. In comparison analysis, time 0 arrays were used as the baseline. At each time point, four pair-wised comparison analysis results were done as we have previously described (38Chen Y.-W. Zhao P. Boroup R. Hoffman E.P. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 1321-1336Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). Comparison analysis results were further processed to select genes with >2-fold changes and to provide an average -fold change using a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet. Absolute analysis results derived from Microarray Suite 4.0 were used for temporal clustering as follows. First, an SAS program was written and used to exclude the probe sets that showed absent calls in all 12 expression profiles. Then, the average difference (absolute analyses) of the surviving probe sets was loaded into GeneSpring for all 12 profiles. A hierarchical clustering algorithm was used to temporally group those probe sets based on their expression pattern across the six time points. Gene lists nucleated with a single gene were generated by using a 0.95 or 0.97 standard correlation coefficient to the expression of the nucleating gene. Five μg of total RNA was used to synthesize cDNA using oligo(dT) primer (Invitrogen) in a 20-μl reaction. One μl of cDNA was then used for RT-PCR. Primers used for RT-PCR are Slug (U79550) forward: 5′-gcagtaatacaatgcccctcc-3′, Slug reverse: 5′-ggcgtggctattaaccgtacc-3′; NIPI-like protein (U67328) forward: 5′-aacagggaacctatggtggc-3′, reverse: 5′-ctgtccacagggtgactgaag-3′; CMP-N-acetylneuraminic acid synthetase (AJ006215) forward: 5′-gacctagtcttgctccgacctc-3′, reverse: 5′-caggggtgtcttaccagactc-3′. Forward primers were labeled with an infrared fluorescent dye (IRDye 700, LI-COR). PCR were done at 94 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s for 15 cycles, and then a 72 °C extension for 7 min. Multiplex RT-PCR products were run and quantitated on a 5.5% gel using a LI-COR DNA analyzer. PCR products were 135 bp (Slug), 142 bp (NIPI-like protein), and 128 bp (CMP-N-acetylneuraminic acid synthetase). PCR products were quantitated using Gene ImagIR 3.56 (LI-COR). Expression ofSlug was normalized to that of NIPI-like protein (control1) and CMP-N-acetylneuraminic acid synthetase (control2) by using the formula, (Slug/control1 +Slug/control2)/2. 21- or 22-bp double-stranded oligonucleotide probes selected from putative promoter regions of mouse and human Slug, human calpain 6, IGF-1, Peg3, sFRP4, and TM4SF6 genes were used for MyoD gel shift assay. A 21-bp MyoD binding probe from muscle creatine kinase (MCK) promoter (Geneka Biotech) was used as a control. The oligonucleotide probes were labeled with [γ-32P]ATP and purified with MicroSpin G-25 columns (Amersham Biosciences). The gel shift assay was done using a MyoD gel shift kit (Geneka Biotech). Nuclear extracts (10 μg) from C2C12 cells were incubated with binding buffer for 20 min at 4 °C and then incubated with 5 ng of labeled oligonucleotide probes for an additional 20 min at 4 °C. For the competition test, 100 times more of unlabeled wild-type or mutant MCK probes (500 ng) were added to each reaction. For the supershift assay, 1 μl of antibodies against MyoD (M318X, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or rabbit IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were incubated with nuclear extract mix for 20 min before adding labeled oligonucleotide probes. The reaction mixture was subjected to 10% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis at 90 V for 2.5 h. Gels were dried and exposed to x-ray film. Murine myoblast (C2C12) were cultured in 10-cm plates in 20% fetal bovine serum until 75% confluent. Then serum was withdrawn, and the cells were allowed to differentiate for 2 days. MyoD-negative murine fibroblasts (NIH 3T3) were cultured until 100% confluent. The cells were fixed with 1% of formaldehyde to cross-link protein and DNA then harvested, and chromatin was extracted. Chromatin was sonicated to about 600-bp fragments. Chromatin fragments were pre-cleared with protein A-agarose (Invitrogen) and then incubated with anti-MyoD antibody (M318X, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or rabbit IgG and rotated overnight at 4 °C. Chromatin bound by antibody was then precipitated with protein A-agarose, washed as described in Boyd et al. (39Boyd K.E. Wells J. Gutman J. Bartley S.M. Farnham P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13887-13892Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar), and eluted with 50 mm NaHCO3 and 1% SDS. Protein and DNA cross-linking was reversed by incubating at 67 °C in 0.3m NaCl for 5 h. DNA was then ethanol-precipitated, digested with proteinase K, and extracted with phenol/chloroform. A 240-bp sequence in mouse Slug promoter region (AF079305) was amplified by PCR (primers: 5′-tgccatgagcagcccattttg-3′ and 5′-ataacatcgcggtggctcagg-3′; conditions: 94 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s for 25 cycles, then an extension at 72 °C for 10 min). This fragment contains the E-box tested for the gel shift assay. Genomic DNA was isolated from C2C12 skeletal muscle cells and mildly sheared with an 18-gauge syringe needle before PCR-mediated amplification of a 240-bp Slug genomic region (see “Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assay” for primers and PCR conditions). An XhoI site was added to the “sense” primer, and a HindIII site was added to the “antisense” primers. After PCR amplification, the Sluggenomic products were digested with XhoI and HindIII. The Slug-restricted fragments were subcloned in the pGL2 luciferase reporter vectors pGL2 Basic, pGL2-Promoter, and pGL2-Enhancer (Promega) digested withXhoI and HindIII. Two single-point mutations were introduced in the E-box (CAGCTG to AAGCTC) of the Slug promoter using the QuikChange kit (Stratagene). The mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing of the Slug constructs. C2C12 skeletal muscle cells were cultured in growth medium (GM, DMEM supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum). To induce differentiation, cells were switched to differentiation medium (DM, DMEM supplemented with 2% horse serum and 1× insulin, transferrin, and selenium). C3H10T1/2 mouse fibroblasts were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. The CMV-MyoD expression vector has been described in Sartorelli et al. (16Sartorelli V. Puri P.L. Hamamori Y. Ogryzko V. Chung G. Nakatani Y. Wang J.Y. Kedes L. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 725-734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Transfections were performed with FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), and luciferase activity was assayed with a Dual Luciferase Reporter Assay kit (Promega) on a microtiter luminescence detection system (MLX, Dynex). Luciferase assays were done in triplicate points and repeated twice. Temporal expression profiling of C2C12 cell differentiation was done at 0, 4, 12, 24, and 48 h after cells were switched into differentiation medium. Two plates were done at each time point. Total RNA was isolated using TRIzol (Invitrogen). Expression profiling was done using Affymetrix GeneChips as described above. Staged skeletal muscle degeneration/regeneration was induced by intramuscular injection of cardiotoxin (CTX) using a custom injection manifold (10 needles in 1 cm2). Twelve mice were injected in both gastrocnemii, and four muscles were collected at each of six time points following CTX injection (0, 12 h, 1 day, 2 days, 4 days, and 10 days). Cryosections from the center (belly) of each muscle were histologically examined and showed the expected, staged features of myofiber degeneration and regeneration (Fig.1). Two of the four muscles from each time point were selected for expression profiling, based upon the observation of the most consistent histopathology throughout the muscle for that time point. Because some replicates were from the same animal, and some were from different animals, it was possible that the coefficient of variance was greater between inbred mice, compared with that within the same mouse, and this could skew our data interpretation. We therefore analyzed a large series of expression profiles by correlation coefficients to determine if inter-animal variability was greater than intra-animal variability for any specific time point following regeneration. We examined a large (27 time points, 54 GeneChip profiles) muscle regeneration expression profiling dataset 3P. Zhao and E. P. Hoffman, unpublished data. with duplicates of each time point derived from muscles of the same animal (18 time points) or different animals (9 time points). Correlation coefficients (R) of the two replicate profiles at each time point were calculated. The average of the R values of the expression profiles for replicates from the same animal (r = 0.97 ± 0.03 (±S.D.)) was identical to that for replicates from different animals (r = 0.97 ± 0.03). Student's t test showed that R values from the two groups were not different (p = 0.96). This suggests that inbred mice are highly similar to each other and that that variation between individual inbred mice is not a significant source of variability of expression profiling data. The two gastrocnemii for each time point were independently solubilized, RNA was purified, and biotinylated cRNA was produced. Biotinylated cRNA samples (10 μg) were hybridized individually to U74A version 1 murine oligonucleotide arrays. Quality control measures included >4-fold cRNA amplification (from total RNA/cDNA), scaling factors <2 to reach a whole-chip normalization of 800, and visual observation of hybridization patterns for chip defects (see microarray.cnmcresearch.org for further descriptions). A data mask was used to filter out incorrect probe sets on the version 1 U74A chip, and the remaining 10,000 genes were used for data analysis. Data was analyzed by two methods. First, Affymetrix software was used to interpret the hybridization patterns across the 20 probe pairs (40 oligonucleotides) for each gene and each profile independently, with default assignment of present/absent calls, and avg diff hybridization intensity values (.cel files). We then used our previously reported iterative comparison survival method (38Chen Y.-W. Zhao P. Boroup R. Hoffman E.P. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 1321-1336Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar), where each pair of profiles per time point (derived from independent muscle samples) was compared with the time 0 profiles, with four resulting comparison analyses. Those genes showing a >2-fold expression change by Affymetrix Microarray Suite 4.0 in each of the four possible comparisons were then retained as “significantly changed” expression. We have shown this method to be a highly specific and stringent, but relatively insensitive analytical method (40Bakay M. Chen Y.-W. Borup R. Zhao P. Nagaraju K. Hoffman E. BMC Bioinformatics. 2002; 3: 4Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). The total number of up-regulated and down-regulated genes using this method showed a gradual increase until day 4, whereupon expression changes decreased at day 10 (Fig.2A). Most of the genes up-regulated at 12 h were associated with inflammation and immune responses, consistent with the extensive necrosis and macrophage infiltration seen by hematoxylin and eosin (Fig. 1). The second analytical method used was temporal clustering using a data-scrubbing method, followed by statistical and temporal analyses by GeneSpring software. Data scrubbing was necessary due to non-expression or a low level (near background) of about one-third of the genes studied, as is typically seen in most Affymetrix profiling experiments in all organisms. Inclusion of the avg diff values for all “absent calls” leads to considerable artificial noise in temporal clustering, with random fluctuations at or below background hybridization levels showing “statistically significant” clustering with user- or candidate gene-defined patterns. We therefore required that each probe set show at least two “present calls” in the 12 expression profiles studied. This filtering was done using an SAS routine, where detection of two present calls leads to the inclusion ofall avg diff values from all profiles for that probe set. A total of 6487 probe sets survived the selection by the SAS program, and then the absolute intensities for all 6487 probe sets for all profiles were input into the GeneSpring analytical package. A hierarchical clustering algorithm was then used to group probe sets based on shared expression patterns over the six time points (Fig. 2B). From this dendrogram, clusters of genes whose expression levels were up-regulated at the different stages of degeneration/regeneration are easily visualized (Fig. 2B). As expected, genes known to be involved in inflammation and immune response were up-regulated at early stages then down-regulated afterward. In contrast, expression of muscle-specific genes was down-regulated at early stages and then up-regulated at late stages (Fig. 2B). Further analysis of the profiles was restricted to"
https://openalex.org/W1997219785,"Of the 20 cysteines of rat brain tubulin, some react rapidly with sulfhydryl reagents, and some react slowly. The fast reacting cysteines cannot be distinguished with [14C]iodoacetamide,N-[14C]ethylmaleimide, or IAEDANS ([5-((((2-iodoacetyl)amino)ethyl)amino) naphthalene-1-sulfonic acid]), since modification to mole ratios ≪1 cysteine/dimer always leads to labeling of 6–7 cysteine residues. These have been identified as Cys-305α, Cys-315α, Cys-316α, Cys-347α, Cys-376α, Cys-241β, and Cys-356β by mass spectroscopy and sequencing. This lack of specificity can be ascribed to reagents that are too reactive; only with the relatively inactive chloroacetamide could we identify Cys-347α as the most reactive cysteine of tubulin. Using the 3.5-Å electron diffraction structure, it could be shown that the reactive cysteines were within 6.5 Å of positively charged arginines and lysines or the positive edges of aromatic rings, presumably promoting dissociation of the thiol to the thiolate anion. By the same reasoning the inactivity of a number of less reactive cysteines could be ascribed to inhibition of modification by negatively charged local environments, even with some surface-exposed cysteines. We conclude that the local electrostatic environment of cysteine is an important, although not necessarily the only, determinant of its reactivity.

Requirements for a few of the SH groups have been identified. Thus, Cys-12β is near the binding site of the exchangeable GTP of β-tubulin (1Shivanna B.D. Mejillano M.R. Williams T.D. Himes R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 127-132Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and a C12Sβ mutation is lethal in haploid yeast, although a C12Aβ mutation is survivable (2Gupta M.L. Bode C.J. Dougherty C.A. Marquez R.T. Himes R.H. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 2001; 49: 67-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Cys-241β 1Because of a difference in alignment in the electron diffraction structure of β-tubulin, Cys-241 corresponds to Cys-239, and Cys-356 corresponds to Cys-354 in the linear sequence. and Cys-356β are near or are part of the binding site for colchicine and other agents (3Uppuluri S.

What the precise role of the involvement of these cysteines may be is for the most part not clear. Some of the SH groups of tubulin form thioesters with palmitic acid both in vivo and in vitro; these may be responsible for membrane localization of tubulin (6Zambito A.M. Wolff J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 239: 650-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 7Caron J.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 8: 621-636Crossref Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 8Wolff J. Zambito A.M. Britto P.J.

Commun. 2001; 283: 42-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). One of these has been located as Cys-376α (10Ozols J. Caron J.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 637-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Except for this palmitoylation site, no specific functions have been identified for the 12 SH groups of α-tubulin, and the order of reactivities of the SH groups has not been definitively established. It has been repeatedly demonstrated (11Luduena R.F. Roach M.C. Pharmacol. Ther. 1991; 49: 133-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar) that reaction of an equivalent of 1 or 2 SH groups with the usual alkylating agents abolished polymerization competence, but their location in the sequence has not been unambiguously determined. Loss of colchicine binding requires modification of additional SH groups by these nonspecific SH reagents. For this reason we have approached the reactivity of tubulin SH groups in a more general sense, comparing the effects of thioether, disulfide, and thioester formation as well as their location in α-tubulin and β-tubulin. Protein sulfhydryl groups can be involved in numerous reactions such as oxidation, disulfide interchange, thioether, and thioester formation. For the purpose of this discussion, we shall exclude oxidation. Although free radical reactions of SH groups are known, the remaining reactions all involve the thiolate anion as the reactive species, whereas the thiol group has very much lower reactivity (12Friedman M. The Chemistry and Biochemistry of the Sulfhydryl Group in Amino Acids, Peptides, and Proteins. Pergamon Press Ltd., Oxford1973Google Scholar). Cysteine reactivity toward various sulfhydryl reagents is regulated by a number of factors including first, exposure to the solvent, and second, dissociation of the thiol to the thiolate anion. RS− is a strong nucleophile (stronger than RO−) normally leading to SN2 reactions. Ionization is suppressed by neighboring acidic groups and enhanced by basic amino acids (12Friedman M. The Chemistry and Biochemistry of the Sulfhydryl Group in Amino Acids, Peptides, and Proteins. Pergamon Press Ltd., Oxford1973Google Scholar). Although the great preponderance of SH groups involved catalytically in enzyme reactions have low pK a values for dissociation to the thiolate anion, less is known about pK a values of SH groups of cysteines not directly involved in catalysis. The tubulin cysteine pK a values are not known. In general it is assumed and has been shown in certain cases that these approach the “normal” SH pK a values near pH 8.5–9.0. Third, cysteine reactivity is regulated by the reactivity of the SH reagent. For disulfide interchange, the pK a is aryl-SH ≪ alkyl-SH, making the former more reactive. Thus, DTNB2 is highly reactive with respect to rate and extent of reaction with native tubulin. Factors outlined fourth and sixth (in the next paragraphs) also contribute to this high reactivity of DTNB. It must be remembered that many of the SH reagents can also react with undissociated thiols albeit at a much lower rate. This must be kept in mind when ascribing low pK a values for SH groups from reactivity with a thiol reagent. Fourth, cysteine reactivity is regulated by charge compatibility between the reagent and the cysteine environment, e.g.iodoacetate versus iodoacetamide or DTNB versus2,2′-dipyridyl disulfide (13Brocklehurst K. Little G. Biochem. J. 1973; 133: 67-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). 2,2′-Dipyridyl disulfide yields significant reaction with cysteine at pH 2. Because the tubulin pK a values are not known, we tested cysteine (assuming a pK a ∼ 8.5) reactivity at pH 2.0 and found a brisk reaction with this reagent. Presumably, this indicates that the weakly nucleophilic, undissociated thiol was one of the reactants. Fifth, cysteine reactivity is regulated by the stability of the bonds formed (in decreasing order), thioether > disulfide > thioester. Most studies on tubulin SH groups have used thioether formation with iodoacetate or iodoacetamide or their derivatives or maleimides. The former react relatively slowly with native protein and with a rather limited number of cysteines (11Luduena R.F. Roach M.C. Pharmacol. Ther. 1991; 49: 133-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Sixth, cysteine reactivity is regulated by the nature of the leaving group of the sulfhydryl reagent, e.g. a thiolate, as found in DTNB, is a good leaving group as are other negatively charged species. The great difficulty in analyzing very hydrophobic peptides produced by palmitoylation led us to take advantage of the greater stability and hydrophilicity of the thioether bond for subsequent manipulations such as the analysis of tryptic peptides. In the present study we have focused on the comparative reactivities for thioether formation of the SH groups of tubulin. In a subsequent study we shall compare this with disulfide and thioester bond formation, the effect of the loss of the fast or slow reacting cysteines, and the effect of the size of the substituents on the ability of tubulin to polymerize and to react with ligands. N-[ethyl-1-14C]Ethylmaleimide (50 mCi/mmol) in n-pentane, [1-14C]iodoacetamide (50 mCi/mmol) in ethanol, and [carbonyl-14C]chloroacetamide (55 mCi/mmol) were purchased from American Radiolabeled Chemicals (St. Louis, MO). N-Ethylmaleimide and iodoacetamide were from Sigma, and 1,5-IAEDANS [5-((((2-iodoacetyl)amino)ethyl)amino) naphthalene-1-sulfonic acid] was from Molecular Probes.syn-Monobromobimane (Molecular Probes) and Thioglo 1 (Calbiochem) were used from their acetonitrile stock solutions. Trypsin-TPCK was obtained from Worthington. All other reagents were the highest grade available from Sigma unless otherwise noted. Pure (>99%) rat brain tubulin was prepared as described (14Wolff J. Knipling L. Sackett D.L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5910-5920Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). All the experiments were performed with buffer (0.3 m Mes, pH 6.9, 1.0 mm EGTA, and 1.0 mm MgCl2) in the dark, and tubulin concentration was 30 μm in all experiments. Stock solutions of the sulfhydryl reagents were prepared fresh in Mes assembly buffer (0.1 m Mes, 1.0 mmEGTA, 1.0 mm MgCl2, pH 6.9). The specific activities of 14C-labeled reagents were adjusted with unlabeled compounds whenever necessary. The reverse phase HPLC columns were obtained from Phenomenex. Two types of experiments were performed, 1) a time course of tubulin sulfhydryl modification at 37 °C at low (1:2) and high (50:1) molar ratios of reagent to tubulin and 2) an 8-h incubation at 4 °C with varying molar ratios (1:5, 1:2, 1:1, 3:1, 5:1, and 10:1) of reagent to tubulin. Reactions were stopped by adding β-mercaptoethanol to a final concentration of 5 mm, and samples were sonicated and placed on ice. The modified tubulin was separated immediately from the unreacted reagent and β-mercaptoethanol by passing through a Sephadex G25 medium column (25 × 0.7 cm) equilibrated with 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.5. The protein fractions were pooled, and protein was estimated using the bicinchoninic acid assay (15Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fujimoto E.K. Goeke N.M. Olson B.J. Klenk D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (18709) Google Scholar). The radioactivity was measured using a TRI-CARB liquid scintillation analyzer (model 1900CA) with 5 ml of scintillation liquid (Ultima GOLD, Packard) plus 5–20 μl of sample. The mole ratio of14C bound per tubulin dimer was calculated for each sample. For 1,5-IAEDANS-modified tubulin samples, 8 or 10 μmmodified tubulin solutions were made (from the pooled fraction) in 0.1m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0 buffer, and the absorbance spectra (Cary 300 spectrophotometer) were recorded for each sample. AEDANS has an absorbance maximum at 330 nm at pH 8.0 with an ε = 5.7 × 103m−1 cm−1. From the absorbance at 330 nm and the extinction coefficient, the concentration of bound AEDANS to tubulin dimer was estimated. In addition, time courses of syn-monobromobimane (λex = 392 nm, λem = 480 nm, at a mole ratio of 67:1) (16Radkowski A.E. Kosower E.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1986; 108: 4527-4531Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar) and Thioglo 1 (λex = 379 nm, λem = 510 nm, at a mole ratio of 40:1) (17Wright S.K. Viola R.E. Anal. Biochem. 1998; 265: 8-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) modifications of tubulin were done at room temperature by following the fluorescence of the product in a PerkinElmer LS-50B fluorimeter using 3-mm masked cells. The14C-modified tubulin samples were subjected to electrophoresis in 10% polyacrylamide gels (1.0-, 2.0-, and 3.0-mm thick gels were used) to separate α- and β-subunits as described by Knipling et al. (18Knipling L. Hwang J. Wolff J. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1999; 43: 63-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). After the run, the gels were equilibrated in the transfer buffer (10 mm CAPS in 20% methanol, pH 11) for 1–2 h and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Immobilon PVDF from Millipore) by applying 1–1.5 mA/cm2 over 5–8 h using a Amersham Biosciences Multiphor II unit. The membranes were air dried overnight and exposed to phosphorimaging plates (BAS-IP MS 2340) for 10–20 days at room temperature. Then the imaging plates were scanned in an FLA3000G image analyzer (FujifilmTM I&I Imaging, Fuji Medical Systems). The IAEDANS-modified tubulin samples were subjected to electrophoresis in 10% polyacrylamide gels (3.0 mm thick). The fluorescent gel bands were imaged using FluorChemTM8000 Advanced Fluorescence, Chemiluminescence, and Visible Imaging Software. The gel was excited at 302 nm to see the emission at 490 nm. The modified tubulin samples (0.5–1.0 mg) were digested with trypsin-TPCK (1:20 weight ratio) at 37 °C for 15–24 h in 0.1 m Tris buffer, pH 8.5, with 5 mm CaCl2. The trypsin digests of modified tubulin were subjected to electrophoresis in 16% or 10–20% Tris-Tricine Novex precast gels. To obtain a higher yield of labeled peptides, we used a preparative (250 × 10 mm, pore size 300 Å, particle size 10 μm) C18 reverse phase column. 500–700 μg of the protein digest (in 150–200 μl) containing 4–6m guanidine-HCl was sonicated and centrifuged before injection into the column. A PerkinElmer series 410 LC pump with a LC-95 UV-visible spectrophotometer was used to apply solvent gradients. We used methanol instead of acetonitrile, and the fractionation of labeled tubulin digest was achieved by applying the following gradient (flow rate, 1.0 ml/min): 5% methanol plus 95% water, 5 mmammonium acetate for 20 min; 5% methanol plus 95% water, 5 mm ammonium acetate to 50% methanol plus 50% water, 5 mm ammonium acetate over a period of 150 min; 50% methanol plus 50% water, 5 mm ammonium acetate to 95% methanol plus 5% water, 5 mm ammonium acetate over a period of 45 min; 95% methanol plus 5% water, 5 mm ammonium acetate for 40 min. This gradient gave us good reproducibility and recovery of radioactivity (greater than 80%). A C12 reverse phase column (50 × 4.6 mm, pore size 90 Å, particle size 4 μm) was used for further purification of peptides. The absorbance at 214 nm was monitored; the peaks were collected manually and counted. The radioactive and the fluorescent peaks were concentrated on a Speedvac instrument and sent for matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) and N-terminal sequence analysis to the Macromolecular Structure Facility, Michigan State University. The masses of the peptides were calculated from the Protein and Peptide Software developed by Dr. Lewis Pannell, NIH (sx102a.niddk.nih.gov/peptide). RASMOL (19Sayle R. Milner-White E.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 374-376Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2323) Google Scholar) was used to visualize and generate tubulin structure (Protein Data Bank code1JFF). It has been proposed that several SH groups of tubulin may form disulfide bonds (20Chaudhuri A.R. Khan I.A. Luduena R.F. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 8834-8845Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), but in the hands of most investigators the 20 SH groups (12 in α- and 8 in β-tubulin) are readily shown to be reduced, and the rat brain tubulin used here consistently yields >19 SH groups by titration with excess DTNB in the absence of any denaturing agent. Moreover, the electron diffraction structure shows no disulfide bonds (21Löwe J. Li H. Downing K.H. Nogales E. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 313: 1045-1057Crossref PubMed Scopus (998) Google Scholar). The time courses of thioether formation with iodoacetamide, IAEDANS, or the maleimides were compared in an excess of reagent (reagent to tubulin = 50:1 or 2.5:1 per SH group at pH 6.9 and 37 °C (Fig.1 A). Both SN2 displacing reagents, iodoacetamide and IAEDANS, showed a slow progressive increase in the number of cysteines reacting over a period of 3 h. Of considerable interest is the finding that the bulky IAEDANS reacted at the same rate as iodoacetamide. Another reagent in this class is syn-monobromobimane (16Radkowski A.E. Kosower E.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1986; 108: 4527-4531Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar), whose progress curve can by followed by fluorescence (excitation = 392 nm, emission = 480 nm, quantum yield 0.2–0.3), as the reagent itself is negligibly fluorescent. The initial rate of reaction is not much faster than iodoacetamide, and the extent of reaction is comparable. As has been reported for small thiols (16Radkowski A.E. Kosower E.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1986; 108: 4527-4531Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar), the reaction is pH-sensitive and is a linear function of the OH− concentration (over the pH range available due to the pI of the protein) (data not shown). As might be expected, monochlorobimane reacts much more slowly than its bromo congener (data not shown). Unfortunately, monobromobimane is subject to photolysis leading to fluorescent products; hence, minimal light exposure and careful blank corrections are critical at all time points. Because separation of excess reagent is required, we have not further pursued this labeling procedure. Nevertheless, all three reagents react with ∼9 of the 20 SH residues in 3 h (Fig.1 A). Thioether formation with maleimides occurs by nucleophilic addition to a double bond rather than by nucleophilic displacement. As shown in Fig. 1 A (top curves), this is a much faster and more extensive reaction. Thus, at 15 min and 37 °C, virtually all of the cysteines have reached the plateau value seen at 2 h. 3–4 SH groups did not react over the 2-h time period. Interaction with a fluorescent maleimide analogue, Thioglo 1 (17Wright S.K. Viola R.E. Anal. Biochem. 1998; 265: 8-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), occurs at an equally rapid rate under these conditions, and again, ∼3–4 cysteines failed to react in the time allowed. It is of interest that here, too, a bulky fluorophore in no way impeded access to 16–17 cysteines of tubulin nor does the fluorophore significantly accelerate interaction, as has been noted for long chain alkylmaleimides on proteins but not small thiols (22Denicola-Seoane A. Anderson B.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1040: 84-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). Thus, although reaction conditions are not identical, it is apparent that thioether formation by nucleophilic displacement is substantially slower than by the addition to double bonds. This difference in rates has been observed previously for small thiols; second order rate constants differ by between 1 and 2 orders of magnitude (23Gorin G. Martic P.A. Doughty G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1966; 115: 593-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 24Hanson H. Hermann P. Bull. Soc. Chim. Biol. 1958; 40: 1835-1847PubMed Google Scholar, 25Steenkamp D.J. Biochem. J. 1993; 292: 295-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). There are clearly fast and slow reacting SH groups in tubulin; the latter become fast upon denaturation with urea such that the full increase in fluorescence occurs virtually instantaneously (data not shown). With progressively increasing urea concentrations, two reaction classes (initial slopes) are observed, a relatively slow rate up to ∼1.5 m urea and a faster rate with urea >1.5m. Because the main objective of the present study is to discover the location of the most reactive cysteines of tubulin, it is necessary to devise conditions for attaining limited stoichiometries by using low mole ratios of reagent to tubulin, low temperatures, or low pH. To minimize reactions with less reactive cysteines, we used mole ratios of 1:2 at 37 °C at pH 6.9 for varying times. Under these conditions the available iodoacetamide was not used up at 3 h (Fig.1 B), and, although there was very low incorporation at early time intervals (e.g. 0.09 SH/dimer), these amounts proved to be useful for further analysis as discussed below. It is well known that tubulin decays at 37 °C (26Wilson L. Biochemistry. 1970; 9: 4999-5007Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar, 27Prakash V. Timasheff S.N. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 295: 137-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Therefore, to minimize any contribution from denaturation to the accessibility or reactivity of tubulin cysteines, experiments were carried out at 4 °C with 30 μm tubulin at mole ratios of reagent/tubulin of 1:5 to 10:1 at pH 6.9 for prolonged periods. As shown in Fig. 1 C, the 8-h incorporation rose gradually as a function of the mole ratio for both iodoacetamide and IAEDANS but never exceeded 4 SH/dimer. These samples also served as samples for tryptic peptide analysis. About twice as much substitution occurred with NEM. In preliminary experiments to compare the distribution of label between the two tubulin monomers, we used 0.06–0.6 mol of [14C]NEM/dimer, 0.05–0.3 mol of [14C]iodoacetamide/dimer, or 0.5–4.0 mol of IAEDANS/dimer. 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gels were used to separate α- and β-tubulin followed by transfer to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, phosphorimaging (Figs.2, A and B), or fluorescence analysis (Fig. 2 C). Under various incubation conditions using different temperatures, times, or mole ratios, no conditions could be found that led to unique labeling of only one monomer at the expense of the other. Even with mole ratios as low as 0.06 (Fig. 2 A) of label/dimer both monomers were labeled. Identical results were obtained with [14C]NEM (Fig.2 B) or with IAEDANS (Fig. 2 C). Although the literature deals almost exclusively with modification of SH groups on β-tubulin, the α-tubulin SH groups appear to react at least as vigorously, and in the case of IAEDANS, α-tubulin labeling exceeds that of β-tubulin. This suggests possibly fast, but partial, reactions on several cysteine residues whose reactivity cannot be distinguished by these reagents; moreover, it is clear that incorporation of 1 eq of any of these three sulfhydryl reagents cannot be unambiguously interpreted in terms of a single cysteine residue. The modified tubulin, digested with trypsin-TPCK for 24 h at 37 °C, was separated on a 16% Tris-Tricine gel. 12 Cysteines of 20 are present in larger (≥2.4 kDa) tryptic peptides that could be identified in 16% Tris-Tricine gels. The following 4 α-tubulin tryptic peptides contain 7 cysteines: 1) residues 3–40 (3.8 kDa), including Cys-4, Cys-20, and Cys-25; 2) residues 125–156 (3.2 kDa), including Cys-129; 3) residues 167–214 (4.8 kDa), including Cys-200 and Cys-213; 4) residues 281–304 (2.4 kDa), including Cys-295. The following three β-tubulin tryptic peptides contain 5 cysteines: 1) residues 123–154 (3.2 kDa), including Cys-129 and Cys-131; 2) residues 175–213 (3.9 kDa), including Cys-201 and Cys-211; 3) residues 217–241 (2.5 kDa), including Cys-241. Most of the bound radioactivity (75 to 80%) was lost during the electrophoresis. This clearly indicates that the smaller tryptic peptides contained the most reactive cysteines. Therefore, the following 11 tubulin cysteines could be eliminated safely as the reactive cysteines: Cys-4α, Cys-20α, Cys-25α, Cys-129α, Cys-200α, Cys-213α, Cys-295α, Cys-129β, Cys-131β, Cys-203β, and Cys-213β. Nine cysteines, Cys-305α, Cys-315α, Cys-316α, Cys-347α, Cys-376α, Cys-12β, Cys-305β, and Cys-356β plus Cys-241β, should contain the fast reacting cysteines of tubulin. Tryptic peptides from tubulin, labeled at low mole ratios, were analyzed by HPLC, mass spectroscopy, and N-terminal sequencing. To identify the most reactive tubulin cysteines with iodoacetamide, the following two samples were used. Tubulin (30 μm) was incubated 1) with [14C]iodoacetamide (15 μm, 56 dpm/pmol) and 2) with [14C]iodoacetamide (1.5 mm, 2.44 dpm/pmol) for 60 min at 37 °C. The samples were processed according to the procedure described under “Experimental Procedures.” The iodoacetamide to tubulin ratio was 1:2 in the former case and 50:1 in the latter, and the moles of 14C incorporated were 0.16 and 5.6, respectively. To obtain a higher yield of labeled peptides, 1) we digested the whole tubulin rather than separating and purifying α- and β-tubulins and 2) used a preparative (250 mm × 10 mm) C18 column. The formation of soluble peptide aggregates impeded the progress of the experiment, so a high concentration of about 4–6 m guanidine-HCl was used for sample preparations. The common acetonitrile gradient did not give reproducible results with good recovery of radioactivity. We used methanol instead of acetonitrile for the fractionation of labeled tubulin digest. This gradient yielded good reproducibility and recovery of radioactivity (>80%). Fig. 3 A shows the HPLC chromatogram of a digest of tubulin modified with [14C]iodoacetamide to a mole ratio of 0.16/dimer. We identified five peaks, labeled as 1*, 2*, 3*, 4*, and 5*, with significant radioactivity (Fig. 3 A). The inset in Fig. 3 A shows the radioactivity of the peaks. Even though the mole ratio of 14C bound per tubulin dimer was 0.16, we observed 5 radioactive peaks, later identified as 3 coming from α-tubulin and 2 from β-tubulin (see below). Fig.3 B shows the HPLC chromatogram of [14C]iodoacetamide-reacted tubulin with a mole ratio of 5.6 per dimer. Again the radioactivity was localized on the same five peaks as at low mole ratios. Thus, there are at least five fast-reacting cysteines present in tubulin, and all of them react with iodoacetamide even at substoichiometric labeling. Similar results were obtained when tubulin was labeled with [14C]NEM. Fig.4 A shows chromatograms of tubulin modified at a mole ratio of 14C to dimer of 0.45. Under these conditions seven labeled peaks could be identified (*) despite a total labeling stoichiometry of ≪1 NEM/dimer. This greater number of modified cysteines is expected because of the greater reactivity of NEM. When a much higher mole ratio of 5.1 NEM/dimer was used, only 1 additional labeled peptide was obtained as shown in Fig.4 B. In addition to the peaks labeled with iodoacetamide above, several of these peaks could not be identified on the basis of their masses, and these were not pursued further. Our failure to identify a single most reactive cysteine using either iodoacetamide or N-ethylmaleimide suggested the use of a less potent reagent such as chloroacetamide. When [14C]chloroacetamide (1.5 mm with 30 μm tubulin for 3 h at 37 °C) was used for kinetic analysis, the moles of 14C incorporated per dimer were only 0.2 as compared with 8 when iodoacetamide was used under the same conditions. When 1/10 as much chloroacetamide was used (Fig. 5), 0.02 mol of 14C were incorporated per dimer. Analysis of the tryptic peptides revealed a single radioactive peak corresponding to Cys-347α (that was also labeled by the other reagents as shown above) (Fig. 5, inset). It is clear that by this approach the one most reactive cysteine could be selected from the other fast-reacting cysteine residues. The tryptic peptides obtained from IAEDANS-, iodoacetamide-, and NEM-modified tubulin after HPLC separation (TableI, actual mass) are compared with their calculated masses (Table I, calculated mass). These values are in good agreement. Subsequent N-terminal sequencing revealed that each peptide had one or two unidentified residues in the cysteine position of the primary sequence. This accounted for the expected mass of the particular modification of the peptide. Table IA lists the four IAEDANS-modified peptides containing five cysteines, Cys-305α, Cys-315α-Cys-316α, Cys-347α and Cys-356β. For reasons we don't understand at present, iodoacetamide modified five peptides (see also Fig. 3, A and B), but one (peak 1) could not be identified. The modified cysteines are Cys-305α (peak 2), Cys-347α (peak 4), Cys-241β (peak 5), and Cys-356β (peak 3)."
https://openalex.org/W2090734530,"Transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) functions as an antiproliferative factor for hepatocytes. However, for unexplained reasons, hepatocytes become resistant to TGF-β signals and can proliferate despite the presence of TGF-β during liver regeneration. TGF-β is up-regulated during liver regeneration, although it is not known whether it is active or latent. TGF-β activity may be examined by assessing Smad activation, a downstream signaling pathway. Smad pathway activation during liver regeneration induced by partial hepatectomy or CCl4 injury was examined by assessing the levels of phospho-Smad2 and Smad2-Smad4 complexes. We found that Smad proteins were slightly activated in quiescent liver, but that their activation was further enhanced in regenerating liver. Interestingly, TGF-β/Smad pathway inhibitors (SnoN and Ski) were up-regulated during regeneration, and notably, SnoN was induced mainly in hepatocytes. SnoN and Ski are transcriptional repressors that may render some cells resistant to TGF-β via binding Smad proteins. Complexes between SnoN, Ski, and the activated Smad proteins were detected from 2 to 120 h during the major proliferative phase in regenerating liver. Inhibitory complexes decreased after liver mass restitution (5–15 days), suggesting that persistently activated Smad proteins might participate in returning the liver to a quiescent state. Our data show that active TGF-β/Smad signals are present during regeneration and suggest that SnoN/Ski induction might explain hepatocyte resistance to TGF-β during the proliferative phase."

In transient transfection systems, the two receptors have markedly different transcriptional effects (1Tung L. Mohamed M.K. Hoeffler J.P. Takimoto G.S. Horwitz K.B. Mol.

Antiprogestins have partial agonist effects only on PR-B, whereas PR-A function as repressors (1Tung L. Mohamed M.K. Hoeffler J.P. Takimoto G.S. Horwitz K.B. Mol.

Microarray analyses demonstrate that the two PRs up- and down-regulate different subsets of genes in breast cancer cells (5Richer J.K. Jacobsen B.M. Manning N.G. Abel M.G. Wolf D.M. Horwitz K.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5209-5218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). For example, although the genes encoding the cell cycle regulatory proteins p21 and cyclin D1 are equally well up-regulated by both receptors (6Richer J.K. Lange C.A. Manning N.G. Owen G. Powell R. Horwitz K.B. J. Biol.

An additional complexity arises from the fact that the two isoforms are coexpressed in the same cell. Therefore, the function of PR-A/PR-B heterodimers may differ from that of the homodimers. Because of this, the ratio of PR-A to PR-B in a tissue is likely to control its response to progesterone. In the uterus, PR-A/PR-B ratios vary extensively during the menstrual cycle (7Mote P.A.

PR knockout mice and transgenic mice that overexpress one PR isoform demonstrate the importance of a balanced isoform ratio. Mice that express only PR-B exhibit normal mammary gland development, but have severe reproductive tract anomalies (9Mulac-Jericevic B. Mullinax R.A. DeMayo F.J. Lydon J.P. Conneely O.M. Science. 2000; 289: 1751-1754Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar), indicating that isoform expression defects are tissue-specific. Transgenic mice that overexpress PR-A exhibit abnormal mammary gland development, including ductal hyperplasia, extensive ductal branching, and decreased cell-to-cell adhesion, all features associated with neoplasia (10Shyamala G. Yang X. Silberstein G. Barcellos-Hoff M.H. Dale E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 696-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). In contrast, overexpression of PR-B reduces ductal branching and alveolar development (11Shyamala G. Yang X. Cardiff R.D. Dale E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3044-3049Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Taken together, the data suggest that PR-A and PR-B have physiologically different tissue-specific functions and that maintenance of appropriate isoform ratios is required for normal progesterone responses. The two PRs are expressed at equimolar levels in the normal human breast during the menstrual cycle (12Mote P.A. Bartow S. Tran N. Clarke C.L. Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 2002; 72: 163-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Whether the PR ratio fluctuates during development or pregnancy is unknown. In human breast cancers, measurement of total PR levels is an important guide to disease prognosis and response to hormone therapies (13Horwitz K.B. Wei L.L. Sedlacek S.M. d'Arville C.N. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 1985; 41: 249-316PubMed Google Scholar, 14McGuire W.L. Semin. Oncol. 1978; 5: 428-433PubMed Google Scholar). However, the role of each isoform in clinical decision-making is unknown, but three studies have addressed this (12Mote P.A. Bartow S. Tran N. Clarke C.L. Breast Cancer Res.

Immunoblot analyses of 202 PR-positive breast cancers show that in ∼50% of tumors, one isoform exceeds the other (12Mote P.A. Bartow S. Tran N. Clarke C.L. Breast Cancer Res.

Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 5063-5068PubMed Google Scholar). Among such invasive tumors, PR-A predominates in ∼80% of cases (12Mote P.A. Bartow S. Tran N. Clarke C.L. Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 2002; 72: 163-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Tumors that overexpress PR-A are less differentiated than tumors that overexpress PR-B (15Bamberger A. Milde-Langosch K. Schulte H. Loning T. Horm. Res. (Basel). 2000; 54: 32-37Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, in culture, human breast cancer cells that overexpress PR-A detach from the monolayer in response to progesterone (17McGowan E.M. Clarke C.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 1657-1671Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), a phenotype associated with high-grade malignancies. In PR-positive T47Dco human breast cancer cells, the two isoforms are constitutively expressed at equimolar levels (18Horwitz K.B. Alexander P.S. Endocrinology. 1983; 113: 2195-2201Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 19Horwitz K.B. Francis M.D. Wei L.L. DNA (N. Y.). 1985; 4: 451-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). These cells are ideal models to study progesterone action because PR induction does not require estrogen pretreatment. In previous studies, a PR-negative subline (T47D-Y cells) was isolated from T47Dco cells and used to stably reintroduce constitutively expressed PR-A (T47D-YA cells) or PR-B (T47D-YB cells) (20Sartorius C.A. Groshong S.D. Miller L.A. Powell R.L. Tung L. Takimoto G.S. Horwitz K.B. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 3868-3877PubMed Google Scholar). Using the ecdysone-inducible system (21No D. Yao T.P. Evans R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 3346-3351Crossref PubMed Scopus (753) Google Scholar), we have now used these cells to engineer five new cell lines. T47D-Y cells were used to create cells that inducibly express (i) no PR (Y iNull cells), (ii) PR-A (Y iA cells), or (iii) PR-B (Y iB cells). Additionally, to manipulate isoform ratios, (iv) T47D-YA cells were modified to inducibly express PR-B (A iB cells), and (v) T47D-YB cells were modified to inducibly express PR-A (B iA cells). The five cell lines all have the same parental cell background. Four express ponasterone A (ponA)-inducible PRs in a tightly regulated manner; and in the cells that express one isoform constitutively, the PR-A/PR-B ratio can be controlled by induction of the other isoform. We demonstrate that liganded, induced receptors undergo progesterone-dependent phosphorylation and down-regulation and control exogenous progesterone-responsive promoters and endogenous gene transcription. A novel finding is that upon receptor induction, subsets of genes defined by microarrays are regulated even in the absence of ligand. One of these genes encodes prolactin receptors (PRLRs). The PR-positive T47Dco breast cancer cell line, isolation of its PR-negative clonal derivative T47D-Y, and construction of PR-positive T47D-YA and T47D-YB cells have been described (20Sartorius C.A.

Cells were routinely cultured in 75-cm2plastic flasks and incubated in 5% CO2 at 37° C in a humidified environment. The stock medium consisted of minimum essential medium (MEM) with Earle's salts containingl-glutamine (292 μg/liter) buffered with sodium bicarbonate (2.2 μg/liter), insulin (6 ng/ml), and 5% fetal calf serum (Hyclone Laboratories, Logan, UT). The T47D-YA and T47D-YB cells were grown in 200 μg/ml G418 (Sigma). The Y iNull, Y iA, Y iB, A iB, and B iA cells were maintained in medium as described above with 300 μg/ml Zeocin (Invitrogen) and 145 units/ml hygromycin B (Calbiochem). A iB and B iA cells were also maintained in 200 μg/ml G418. The ecdysone-inducible mammalian expression plasmids, and the pVgRXR, pInd/hygro, and pInd/LacZ plasmids were from Invitrogen. Five μg of the pInd/hygro vector containing the hygromycin B resistance gene were digested with EcoRV and dephosphorylated. The PR-B cDNA (human PR1, gift of P. Chambon) (23Kastner P. Krust A. Turcotte B. Stropp U. Tora L. Gronemeyer H. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1603-1614Crossref PubMed Scopus (1323) Google Scholar) was released withEcoRI, and its ends were filled with Klenow and ligated to the EcoRV-digested pInd/hygro vector to generate pIndB/hygro. pIndA/hygro was created by BamHI digestion of pIndB/hygro to excise the 5′-PR-B cDNA region (B-upstream segment), followed by religation. DNAs were sequenced for orientation and content. Approximately 3 million T47D-Y, T47D-YA, or T47D-YB cells were transfected with 15 μg of the pVgRXR plasmid. After 48 h, the cells were placed in medium containing 500 μg/ml Zeocin to kill untransfected cells. Positive clones were expanded and tested for VgRXR expression and function by β-galactosidase expression from the transiently transfected pInd/LacZ vector containing five VgRXR-binding sites (ecdysone/glucocorticoid response element) upstream of the LacZ reporter. Cells were induced for 24–48 h with 10 μmponA (Invitrogen) and lysed in 1× lysis buffer (Pharmingen, San Diego, CA), and β-galactosidase assays were performed as described (6Richer J.K. Lange C.A. Manning N.G. Owen G. Powell R. Horwitz K.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31317-31326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Three clones with the highest induction (T47D-YV, T47D-YAV, and T47D-YBV) were selected and used to generate secondary stable cells. T47D-YV cells were transfected by electroporation with 15 μg of the pIndA/hygro, pIndB/hygro, or pIndNull/hygro construct; T47D-YAV cells were transfected with pIndB/hygro; and T47D-YBV cells were transfected with pIndA/hygro. After 48 h, cells were placed in medium containing hygromycin B (195 units/ml). Surviving clones were expanded and assayed for PR expression by immunoblotting after 24 or 48 h of induction with 10 μm ponA. pIndNull/hygro (Y iNull) cells were screened for an intact inducible promoter region by PCR (data not shown). Cells were harvested, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and resuspended in medium containing 6% charcoal-stripped serum (CSS). Four million cells, 12 μg of pMMTV-Luc reporter (a gift of S. Nordeen) (24Nordeen S.K. BioTechniques. 1988; 6: 454-458PubMed Google Scholar) or pPRE2-TATAtk-Luc, and 1 μg of pCMV-β-gal as an internal control were electroporated at 220 V and 950 microfarads. Replicate sets were plated in four 35-mm dishes in MEM containing CSS, induced with 10 μm ponA or Me2SO for 24 h, and then treated with EtOH or 10 nm R5020 for 24 h. Cells were harvested, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed with 1× lysis buffer. Luciferase and β-galactosidase assays were performed as described (6Richer J.K. Lange C.A. Manning N.G. Owen G. Powell R. Horwitz K.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31317-31326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Whole cell extracts (WCEs) were prepared in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer with protease inhibitors as described (6Richer J.K. Lange C.A. Manning N.G. Owen G. Powell R. Horwitz K.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31317-31326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar) from cells that were induced or not for 24 h with 10 μm ponA. Extracts (200 μg) were resolved on a 7.5% denaturing polyacrylamide gel, transferred to nitrocellulose, blocked, and probed for PR with a mixture of AB-52 and B-30 antibodies (25Graham M.D. Bunn P.J. Jewett P.B. Gonzalez A.C. Horwitz K.B. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 3934-3942PubMed Google Scholar). Protein bands were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (AmershamBiosciences) and quantified by densitometry (Alpha Imager, Alpha Innotech Corp., San Leandro, CA). For PR induction, cells in log phase were harvested, and 1.3 million were plated in 60-mm dishes containing MEM and CSS with vehicle or 10 μm ponA. Cells were harvested at specified times (3–72 h), and WCEs were immunoblotted. For PR turnover, cells in log phase were plated at 1.3 million cells/60-mm plate and treated with Me2SO or 10 μm ponA for 24 h. One of three treatments followed: 1) removal of ponA and addition of Me2SO, 2) removal of ponA and addition of R5020, or 3) continued ponA and addition of R5020. Cells were harvested at the specified times, and WCEs were immunoblotted. Cells in log phase were changed into antibiotic-free MEM and 6% CSS containing Me2SO or 10 μm ponA, induced for 24 h, and then treated with EtOH or progesterone (10 nm) for the specified times. Cells were harvested and washed, and total RNA was prepared. RT-PCR was performed using conditions as reported (5Richer J.K. Jacobsen B.M. Manning N.G. Abel M.G. Wolf D.M. Horwitz K.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5209-5218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar) with GAPDH as an internal control for each sample. PRLR primers were as follows: PRLRfwd, 5′-gcagctgagtgggagatcc-3′; and PRLRrev, 5′-ggacagccacagagatccac-3′. Other primer sequences were previously reported (5Richer J.K. Jacobsen B.M. Manning N.G. Abel M.G. Wolf D.M. Horwitz K.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5209-5218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). Samples were resolved on 2% agarose gels and stained with ethidium bromide (reverse images are shown.) Densitometry was performed, and samples were normalized to GAPDH prior to calculation of -fold changes. Immunoblotting was performed to monitor PR induction. Y iA or Y iNull cells in log phase were changed into antibiotic-free MEM and 6% CSS containing Me2SO or 10 μm ponA, induced for 24 h, and then treated with EtOH or progesterone (10 nm) for 6 h. Cells were harvested and washed, and total RNA was isolated. Poly(A)+ RNA was prepared; samples were labeled; and microarray analysis was performed with Affymetrix gene chips (HuFL-U95Av2) as described (5Richer J.K. Jacobsen B.M. Manning N.G. Abel M.G. Wolf D.M. Horwitz K.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5209-5218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). RNA samples were prepared from cells independently induced in three (Y iA) or two (Y iNull) time-separated experiments. Data were plotted (GeneSpring Version 4.0, Silicon Genetics, Redwood City, CA), normalized, and analyzed as previously described (5Richer J.K. Jacobsen B.M. Manning N.G. Abel M.G. Wolf D.M.

An asterisk denotes a statistically significant difference as assessed by one-way analysis of variance using ap < 0.05 cutoff followed by a Tukey multiple comparison test between Me2SO-treated and ponA-treated cells. The ecdysone-inducible mammalian expression system (21No D. Yao T.P. Evans R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 3346-3351Crossref PubMed Scopus (753) Google Scholar) was used to construct cells that inducibly express one or the other PR isoform in the background of PR-negative T47D-Y cells (20Sartorius C.A. Groshong S.D. Miller L.A. Powell R.L. Tung L. Takimoto G.S. Horwitz K.B. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 3868-3877PubMed Google Scholar). The cells were stably transfected with the VgRXR plasmid, which encodes both the modified ecdysone receptor (Vg) and retinoid X receptor (RXR) regulatory proteins; selected in antibiotic; and expanded. Cells were transiently transfected with the inducible LacZ-positive control plasmid and induced with ponA, and the clone with the highest induction of β-galactosidase (termed T47D-YV) was stably transfected with plasmids containing five VgRXR-binding sites upstream of the PR-A (pIndA/hygro) or PR-B (pIndB/hygro) cDNA or no cDNA (pInd/hygro). Transfected cells were selected in antibiotic; expanded; induced with ponA; and screened by immunoblotting or RT-PCR to select clonal lines that inducibly express PR-A (Y iA cells), PR-B (Y iB cells), or no PR (Y iNull cells). Fig.1 shows an immunoblot from the three cell lines treated either with vehicle or with ponA. PR regulation was tightly controlled, and PRs were undetectable in the uninduced cells and the control Y iNull cells. Multiple independent clones were characterized, and no significant differences were observed among them. Therefore, one representative clone for each inducible cell type is shown. T47D-YA and T47D-YB cells, which constitutively express PR-A and PR-B, respectively, were transfected with the VgRXR plasmid; selected in antibiotic; expanded; and screened with the inducible LacZ construct. The highest expressors, called T47D-YAV and T47D-YBV, were used to create the secondary cells. YAV cells received the IndB construct; YBV cells received the IndA construct. Positive clones were selected in hygromycin B, expanded, and screened by immunoblotting (Fig. 1). In the absence of inducer, only the constitutive isoform was expressed. Upon addition of ponA, the second isoform appeared. Expression of the inducible isoform did not affect expression of the constitutive isoform, and receptor levels were similar to those found in T47Dco cells, which express both PR-A and PR-B naturally (Fig. 1). Because heterodimerization of the VgRXR regulatory protein is dependent on binding of ponA, inducer concentration determines the amount of protein produced by the target gene. To demonstrate this, cells were treated with increasing concentrations of ponA (Fig.2). PR induction was detectable with 1–3 μm ponA in Y iA and Y iB cells (Fig. 2 A). In A iB cells, the PR-A/PR-B ratio ranged from 2.3 to 0.9 depending on the ponA dose (Fig. 2 B). In B iA cells, the PR-A/PR-B ratio ranged from 0.3 (at 3 μm ponA) to 2.5 (at 10 μm ponA) (Fig. 2 B). For the studies described below, a 10 μm ponA dose was used. Cells were treated with vehicle or ponA for 3 to 72 h (Fig.3). PR induction was readily observed at 12 h and peaked at 24 h (Fig. 3, A andB). Without addition of fresh ponA, PRs stayed at high levels for varying periods of time: 72 h in Y iB and Y iA cells (Fig. 3 A) and 34–48 h in B iA and A iB cells (Fig.3 B). For the studies described here, a 24-h induction time was used. These time course and ponA concentration data are similar to those reported for induction of β-galactosidase in CV-1 cells (26Saez E. Nelson M.C. Eshelman B. Banayo E. Koder A. Cho G.J. Evans R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 14512-14517Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Wild-type PRs undergo ligand-dependent down-regulation coincident with strong transcriptional activation (27Lange C.A. Shen T. Horwitz K.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1032-1037Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). To determine whether the inducible PRs exhibit this physiologically important response, Y iB cells were treated with or without ponA for 24 h and then with or without the progestin R5020 for 72 h while ponA was continued (Fig.4). In the absence of R5020, PR-B were detectable for at least 72 h (Fig. 4 A, left panel). In the presence of R5020, PR-B were ∼70% down-regulated by 12 h and 95% down-regulated by 24 h (Fig. 4 A,right panel). This time course of down-regulation was identical to that observed for PRs expressed by their endogenous promoters in T47D cells and for PR expression driven by the exogenous SV40 promoter in the T47D-YA and T47D-YB cells. It occurred despite the continuous presence of ponA and indicates that down-regulation is a post-transcriptional phenomenon. The molecular mass upshift of R5020-occupied PR-B in the right panel is indicative of ligand-dependent phosphorylation (28Sheridan P.L. Evans R.M. Horwitz K.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 6520-6528Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Bagchi M.K. Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.-J. O'Malley B.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A. 1992; 89: 3050-3054Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). To define the time course of PR disappearance after ponA withdrawal, Y iB cells were induced with ponA for 24 h. ponA was then washed out; cells were treated with or without R5020; and PR-B levels were measured for 0–72 h thereafter (Fig. 4 B). In the absence of R5020, PR-B declined by 39% at 12 h and by 93% at 24 h following ponA removal (Fig. 4 B, left panel). The PR loss in the absence of R5020 was due to a halt in transcription coupled with protein turnover. Ligand-dependent down-regulation due to R5020 treatment (Fig. 4 B, right panel) accelerated this process, with 98% loss of PR-B by 12 h. To test whether the induced receptors are functional as homo- or heterodimers, cells were transiently transfected with MMTV (24Nordeen S.K. BioTechniques. 1988; 6: 454-458PubMed Google Scholar) or PRE2-TATAtk promoter-luciferase reporters and treated for 24 h with 1) vehicle, 2) R5020, 3) ponA, or 4) ponA and R5020 (Fig. 5). In Y iA cells, no transcription above basal levels was observed except in set 4, which received ponA and R5020. Transcription induced by PR-A homodimers was lower from the simple PRE2-TATAtk promoter (2–3-fold) than from the complex MMTV promoter (10-fold) (Fig. 5,upper left panel). The pattern in Y iB cells was similar, except for the typically much higher levels of transcription observed with PR-B homodimers from both PRE2-TATAtk(50-fold) and MMTV (60-fold) due to activation function 3 of PR-B (Fig. 5, upper right panel, set 4). Note the 10-fold difference in the scales of the two panels. No stimulation was observed in Y iNull cells transfected with PRE2-TATAtk-Luc and treated with ponA and progesterone, demonstrating that VgRXR is not activated by progesterone and is not functional on a PRE (data not shown). To study the influence of heterodimers, A iB and B iA cells were treated with or without ponA for 24 h, followed by vehicle or R5020 for 24 h (Fig. 5, lower panels). A iB cells express PR-A constitutively, so in the absence of ponA, R5020 induced the PRE2 reporter by 3-fold and the MMTV reporter by 20-fold (set 2), as expected for PR-A homodimers. The contribution of PR-B resulting from ponA induction led to marked rises in transcription levels to 15- and 80-fold, respectively (set 4). However, maximum levels in A iB cells (∼45,000 luciferase units) did not approach the levels seen in Y iB cells (∼200,000 units). At equimolar levels of PR expression, binomial distribution analysis predicts that ∼50% of PRs are heterodimers and that 25% are PR-A or PR-B homodimers (31DeMarzo A.M. Beck C.A. Onate S.A. Edwards D.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 72-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The repressor contribution of PR-A as the homodimer and/or heterodimer requires further study. Similarly, in the B iA cells, the strong transcription observed with constitutively expressed PR-B homodimers (120–130-fold induction over base-line levels from both reporters) (set 2) was reduced by ∼75% (PRE2-TATAtk) and 50% (MMTV) upon induction of PR-A (set 4). Thus, paradoxically, although the induced cells contain higher total PR levels, their transcription levels are lower. These experiments document the inhibitory actions of PR-A on PR-B-mediated transcription in transient transfection assays (1Tung L. Mohamed M.K. Hoeffler J.P. Takimoto G.S. Horwitz K.B. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 1256-1265PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar, 3Vegeto E. Shabaz M.M. Wen D.X. Goldman M.E. O'Malley B.W. McDonnell D.P. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 1244-1255Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar), using models in which the mechanisms can be addressed. In exogenous expression systems, coexpression of the two PRs leads to transcription levels that differ from those seen with each receptor alone (Fig. 5). This has led to the long-held generalization that PR-A are repressors of PR-B activity. Without appropriate experimental models, however, this has not been analyzable on endogenous genes. The new cell lines were designed to address this deficiency since our long-term goal is to analyze this issue in a global manner. In Fig. 6, we show preliminary results using two endogenous genes:bcl-x L , which we previously showed to be up-regulated specifically by PR-A; and tissue factor, which we previously showed to be up-regulated specifically by PR-B (5Richer J.K.

We now investigated what happens to the endogenous regulation of each gene when the other PR isoform is added, using the four PR-expressing cell lines. Each transcript was measured by RT-PCR after treatment with 1) vehicle, 2) progesterone, 3) ponA, or 4) ponA plus progesterone. Immunoblotting was performed to quantify PR induction (data not shown, but see"
https://openalex.org/W2075202596,"Abstract We previously found that the JNK-interacting proteins JIP1b and JIP2 associate with the cytoplasmic domain of the Alzheimer's amyloid precursor protein (APP) (Taru, H., Iijima, K., Hase, M., Kirino, Y., Yagi, Y., and Suzuki, T. (2002) J. Biol. Chem. 277, 20070–20078). This interaction involves the carboxyl-terminal phosphotyrosine interaction (PI) domain of JIP1b or JIP2 and the GYENPTY motif in the APP cytoplasmic domain. The expression of JIP1b stabilizes immature APP and suppresses the production of a secreted large extracellular amino-terminal domain of APP, the generation of a cleaved intracellular carboxyl-terminal fragment of APP, and the secretion of β-amyloid 40 and 42. Deletion of the PI domain or alteration of PI amino acid residues prevents JIP1b from interacting with APP and affecting its metabolism, but deletion of the JNK-binding domain of JIP1b has no effect. JIP2, a weaker APP-binding protein, does not influence the processing of APP, although it is known that both JIP1b and JIP2 equally regulate the JNK signaling cascade. The present results suggest that JIP1b can directly modulate APP metabolism by interacting with the APP cytoplasmic domain, independent of its regulation of the JNK signaling cascade."

To date, seven Na+-H+ exchangers have been identified in mammals, and although several members of this family have been extensively studied and characterized, it is clear that there are major gaps in our understanding with respect to the remaining family members. To initiate the study of Na+-H+ exchangers in a genomically defined and genetically tractable model system, we have cloned the complete cDNAs and analyzed splice site variation for nine putative homologs from the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, which we have called NHX-1 through -9. The expression patterns and cellular distributions of the NHX proteins were determined using transcriptional and translational promoter-transgene fusion constructs to green fluorescent protein. Four of the putative exchangers were expressed at the cell surface, whereas five of the exchangers were associated with the membranes of intracellular organelles. Individual isoforms were expressed exclusively in the intestine, seam cells, hypodermal cells of the main body syncytium, and the excretory cell, all of which are polarized epithelial cells, suggesting a role for these proteins in epithelial membrane transport processes in the nematode. Other isoforms were found to express either ubiquitously or in a pan-neural pattern, suggesting a more conserved role in cell pH regulation or neuronal function. Finally, we show that recombinant NHX-4, the ubiquitous nematode Na+-H+ exchanger, mediates Na+-dependent pH recovery after intracellular acidification.

Although Na+-H+exchange activity is present in organisms ranging from bacteria, yeast, and plants to animals, the functional basis for these activities is in some cases quite different. Bacteria exhibit electrogenic Na+-H+ exchange, with a stoichiometry of 1Na/2H; as a result of the net uptake of protons for net loss of sodium, the organism is able to live in extreme hypersaline or hyperalkaline environments (3Taglicht D. Padan E. Schuldiner S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5382-5387Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The bacterial Na+-H+ exchange proteins are generally around 332 amino acids in length and contain 10 transmembrane domains (4Waser M. Hess-Bienz D. Davies K. Solioz M. J. Biol.

These exchangers are typically from 600 to 700 amino acids in length, contain 10–12 predicted transmembrane domains, and have a large, exposed cytoplasmic carboxyl terminus. NHE1 is expressed ubiquitously and is believed to play a housekeeping role in establishing cytosolic pH (22Noel J. Pouyssegur J. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 1995; 268: 283-296Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas NHE2, -3, -4, and -5 display more restricted tissue distributions, perhaps reflecting more specialized functions (19Wang Z. Orlowski J. Shull G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11925-11928Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Tse C.M. Levine S.A. Yun C.H. Montrose M.H. Little P.J. Pouyssegur J. Donowitz M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11917-11924Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). NHE6 and NHE7 are expressed ubiquitously and appear to be intracellular exchangers (15Numata M. Orlowski J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17387-17394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar,18Numata M. Petrecca K. Lake N. Orlowski J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6951-6959Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Insights into the function of the NHE exchanger family have come lately from gene ablation studies on mouse isoforms 1, 2, and 3. Targeted disruption of the ubiquitously expressed NHE1 was expected to be lethal; however, null mutant mice were not only viable but exhibited only a slightly retarded postnatal growth rate (24Bell S.M. Schreiner C.M. Schultheis P.J. Miller M.L. Evans R.L. Vorhees C.V. Shull G.E. Scott W.J. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 1999; 276: 788-795Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because NHE1 is generally expressed at low levels in the brain, it was surprising to find that NHE1-null mice exhibited ataxia and epileptic-like seizures. Consistent with NHE1 playing a “housekeeping” role in maintaining intracellular pH, fibroblasts and lacrimal and salivary acinar cells from NHE1−/− mice appear to lack the means to recover effectively from an intracellular acid load (24Bell S.M. Schreiner C.M. Schultheis P.J. Miller M.L. Evans R.L. Vorhees C.V. Shull G.E. Scott W.J. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 1999; 276: 788-795Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Nguyen H.V. Shull G.E.

Indeed, lack of NHE1 resulted in a dramatic reduction in salivation, consistent with a role in promoting chloride flux via functionally coupled Cl−-HCO3− exchangers by increasing the pHi during sustained secretion (28Park K. Evans R.L. Watson G.E. Nehrke K. Richardson L. Bell S.M. Schultheis P.J. Hand A.R. Shull G.E. Melvin J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27042-27050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Loss of NHE2 led to structural abnormalities in the oxyntic mucosa of the gastric corpus as well as a reduction in net gastric acid secretions in adults (29Schultheis P.J. Clarke L.L. Meneton P. Harline M. Boivin G.P. Stemmermann G. Duffy J.J. Doetschman T. Miller M.L. Shull G.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1243-1253Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). It is thought that the phenotypic effects of NHE2 loss are related to survival of parietal cells rather than the ability to secrete acid per se. Loss of NHE3 led to renal and intestinal absorptive defects, such as a mild tubular acidosis and slight diarrhea as well as a decreased ability to absorb fluid and HCO3− in the proximal convoluted tubules (30Schultheis P.J. Clarke L.L. Meneton P. Miller M.L. Soleimani M. Gawenis L.R. Riddle T.M. Duffy J.J. Doetschman T. Wang T. Giebisch G. Aronson P.S. Lorenz J.N. Shull G.E. Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 282-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (703) Google Scholar). A reduction in blood pressure, increased absorptive area provided by swelling of the cecum, and elevated levels of blood aldosterone were postulated to compensate partially for loss of NHE3. Further evidence of compensation was noted in that the levels of kidney renin, AE1 (anion exchanger type 1), and ENaC (epithileal sodium channel) mRNA as well as other mRNAs were altered substantially in homozygous null mice. These results suggest that the proteins and processes involved in Na+ reabsorption in the kidney and intestine are tightly coupled functionally and that NHE3 plays a major role in promoting sodium homeostasis in these tissues. Thus, although a great deal is known about the function of several Na+-H+ exchanger isoforms in mammals, there are major gaps in our understanding of the remaining family members. In addition, the advent of compensatory mechanisms after mammalian gene ablation creates some difficulties in correlating physiological membrane transport processes with the existing null phenotypes. To broaden our understanding of how individual Na+-H+ isoforms enable epithelial membrane transport processes and contribute to maintaining cellular Na+, pH, and fluid homeostasis, we have chosen to studyCaenorhabditis elegans as a model system. This soil nematode is similar to mammals in many ways. Despite there being only roughly 1000 cells in the adult hermaphrodite, the worm possesses multiple distinct tissues that are conserved in mammals. Indeed, on a genomic level, many of the ion transport families in mammals are reflected in worms, with a similar diversity found among family members, suggesting that the basic physiological functions of nematode cells are conserved as well. One of the many benefits of working with C. elegansis that it is a genomically defined and genetically tractable model. Obtaining transgenic lines for expression analysis is relatively straightforward. Similarly, double-stranded RNA-mediated gene interference (RNAi) allows a rapid means of pheno-copying loss-of-function alleles. To gain an understanding of acid-base physiology in the nematode, we have cloned nine cDNAs representing the entire Na+-H+ exchanger family from C. elegans. A comparison of these sequences to the seven highly related mammalian NHE exchangers leads us to believe that they may possess evolutionarily conserved functions at the cellular level. As a first step toward elucidating the role of these putative exchangers in C. elegans, we have investigated the expression patterns of the nine exchangers and, using translational fusions to GFP, have examined protein targeting to cellular and organelle membranes. A functional characterization of the ubiquitously expressed NHX-4 protein confirms that members of this family can function as Na+-H+ exchangers and reveals some of the basic physiological characteristics of the transport process. Basic local alignment search tool (BLAST) homology searches of WormPep (a predictive data base) and the C. elegans genome with NHE1 yielded nine putative Na+-H+ exchanger cDNAs (B0395.1, B0495.4, C54F6.13, F14B8.1, F57C7.2, F58E1.6, K09C8.1, Y18D10A.6, ZK822.3); several other clones with homology to E. coli napA were not studied. A multiple sequence alignment of conceptually translated predicted cDNAs was used to design probes based upon conserved domains within the amino terminus of each of the proteins. Isoform-specific probes were generated by reverse-PCR using mixed stageC. elegans 1st strand cDNA. Using these probes, twoC. elegans cDNA libraries, an oligo(dT)-primed cDNA library (λ-ACT-RB1) and a random-primed cDNA library (λ-ACT-RB2) (kindly provided by Dr. R. Barstead, University of Wisconsin-Madison), were screened as described previously (31Nehrke K. Begenisich T. Pilato J. Melvin J.E. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2000; 279: 2052-2066Crossref Google Scholar). Multiple clones for 8 of the 9 NHE homologs were obtained. Additional sequence information at the 5′ end of each clone was derived from 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends using the SL1 trans-spliced leader sequence as an anchored primer in combination with nested isoform-specific primers. For NHX-6 mRNA, 3′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends analysis was used to establish the distal coding region and 3′-untranslated region. Each cDNA clone was sequenced fully on both strands to assess splice site variation, and the full-length cDNAs were submitted to GenBankTM and WormBase using the gene family name nhx as assigned by the C. elegans Genomics Center. These sequences are found under the accession numbers AF497823-AF497835. Transcriptional promoter fusions to GFP were created by PCR amplification of 4 kb of genomic sequence from upstream of the first start codon for each isoform using restriction site-tagged oligonucleotide primers that contained a mutated start codon complement (ATG to TTG) to prevent translational initiation. The PCR products were cloned into the complementary sites of the vector pFH6.II (courtesy of F. Hagen, University of Rochester, Rochester, NY), which is a derivative of pPD 95.81 (courtesy of A. Fire, Carnegie Institute of Washington, Baltimore, MD) to create pJP109-nhx-N (where N is 1–9). Translational promoter fusions (pJP113-nhx-N) were created similarly but instead used a downstream genomic primer that annealed immediately before the stop codon (rather than start codon), and the PCR product was cloned so that GFP would be translated in-frame with the full NHX protein-coding region. Because of size limitations and stability issues, the NHX-5, -7, and -8::GFP translational fusion constructs contained only 1.5 kb of promoter sequence upstream of the initiator codon. Nematodes (Bristol N2 strain) were cultured at 14 or 22 °C on nematode growth medium plates seeded with HB101 or OP50 bacteria from an overnight culture using standard techniques. GFP fusion construct and pRF4, which produces a rol-6 roller phenotype (32Kramer J.M. French R.P. Park E.C. Johnson J.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 2081-2089Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar), were mixed at 75 mg/ml each in injection buffer (composition) then co-injected into the gonad of young adult Bristol-N2 nematodes as described (33Mello C.C. Kramer J.M. Stinchcomb D. Ambros V. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3959-3970Crossref PubMed Scopus (2443) Google Scholar). After 4 days, rollers were picked from at least 10 injections to separate plates to look for germ-line transmission. The nematodes were imaged on 2% M9-agarose pads using a Nikon Eclipse E800 microscope equipped with a Nikon 10, 20, 60, or 100× Apo series objectives under 100-W mercury illumination and a GFP or 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole filter set, as appropriate. The images were captured using a Spot2 camera and analyzed in Adobe Photoshop (Adobe Systems, San Jose, CA). Alternatively, images were captured using a Leica confocal microscope under 488 nm laser illumination and a fluorescein isothiocyanate filter set. The full coding region for NHX-4a was amplified from a λ cDNA clone and ligated into the vector pcDNA3.1/V5/His/topo (Invitrogen). The NHX-4a expression vector pPM1 and the CD8 expression plasmid pID3-CD8 (courtesy of Dr. Brian Seed, Harvard University) were transiently transfected at a 10:1 ratio into the Na+-H+ exchanger-deficient cell line AP1 (courtesy of Dr. Sergio Grinstein, University of Toronto) using Superfect reagent (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Immediately after transfection, the cells were trypsinized and plated onto 10 mm glass coverslips. Twenty-four hours later, cells were loaded with the fluorescent pH indicator BCECF (2 μm) at room temperature for 30 min in 1 ml of a normal, low potassium buffer (135 mm NaCl, 5.4 mm KCl, 0.4 mmKH2PO4, 0.33 mmNaH2PO4, 10 mm glucose, 20 mm HEPES, 1.2 mm CaCl2, 0.8 mm MgSO4; the pH was adjusted to 7.4 with Tris base. The coverslips were then moved to a perfusion chamber mounted on the microscope and superfused with normal buffer. Individual CD8+ cells were identified by incubating with anti-CD8 antibody-coated Dynabeads M-450 (Dynal, Oslo, Norway). A dual wavelength excitation system (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA) rigged to a Nikon inverted microscope equipped with a CCD camera detection system (Cooke, Germany) was used to monitor pH changes. The fluorescent emissions were measured at 530 nm after excitation at 440 and 490 nm. An acute acid load was induced by the NH4+/NH3 prepulse technique (34Roos A. Boron W.F. Physiol. Rev. 1981; 61: 296-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (2288) Google Scholar). Briefly, 60 mm NaCl in the above normal solution was replaced by NH4Cl, and after several minutes of perfusion, the cells were then switched to a solution containing 135 mmn-methyl-d-glucamine-HCl in place of sodium. Recovery upon sodium readdition was monitored by image acquisition using AXON Image2.1 software, then analyzed using Microcal Origin 6.0. The derivative fluorescent ratio was converted to pHi by in situ calibration using the high K+/nigericin technique. In all experiments, CD8+ cells were matched with non-transfected cells, which never exhibited pHi recovery. Approximately 8–10 CD8+ cells were imaged per coverslip. To address Na+ dependence, NaCl in the above normal buffer was replaced with the appropriate amount ofn-methyl-d-glucamine-HCl, and to address Cl− dependence, KCl and NaCl in the above normal solution were replaced with potassium and sodium gluconate, respectively. We isolated cDNAs encoding nine different proteins with homology to the mammalian NHE family of Na+-H+ exchangers, which we have called NHX-1 through NHX-9; the nhx gene designation has been registered with the Caenorhabditis Genetics Center. In general, each predicted NHX protein was from 600 to 750 amino acids in length, with the exception of NHX-1, which was the smallest member of the family, at 480 amino acids, and each protein was predicted to contain from 10 to 12 transmembrane domains with a large exposed C terminus, as is found in all members of the mammalian NHE family. An alignment of the cDNA and corresponding genomic sequences resulted in the schematic shown in Fig.1 A. Multiple variants were identified for four of the isoforms. NHX-4 mRNA was unique in that two distinct SL1 splice sites were used, separated by three exons and ∼3 kb of genomic sequence, resulting in NHX-4a and NHX-4b mRNA variants (Fig. 1 A). NHX-5 mRNA also exhibited splice variation and was the only nematode Na+-H+ exchanger that had a variable C terminus (NHX-5a and NHX-5b). NHX-8a mRNA contained a coding sequence derived from an additional upstream exon and lacked an SL1 leader compared with NHX-8b mRNA, suggesting that it may represent an unprocessed mRNA, whereas the NHX-9a mRNA variant contained an alternate exon 1 that had an SL1 trans-spliced leader (Fig. 1) and, thus, appeared to be the result of true alternative splicing. However, exon1 from NHX-9b mRNA was not preceded by an SL1 leader. And in an interesting twist, both the NHX-8b and NHX-9b mRNA variants contained out-of-frame ATGs that preceded the start of the putative open reading frames. This is unusual in worms, where the first ATG after the SL1 leader typically initiates translation. We do not know the reason behind this anomaly. Based upon homology, the seven known mammalian NHE proteins can be grouped into two distinct branches. The first of these contains the plasma membrane exchangers NHE1 through NHE5, whereas the second contains the intracellular ion transport proteins NHE6 and NHE7. We aligned the predicted proteins NHX-1 through NHX-9 with human (NHE1, -2, -3, -5, -6, and -7) and rat (NHE4) Na+-H+exchanger proteins and used the resulting alignment to create a phylogram showing relatedness among family members (Fig.1 B). There was generally between 20 and 40% identity and from 40 to 60% homology across the core conserved region both within the family and when compared with the mammalian Na+-H+ exchangers, with several pairs of exchangers exhibiting higher levels of homology (for example, as mentioned above, see NHX-2 versus NHX-6 and NHX-3versus NHX-9, or in the case of the mammalian exchangers, NHE3 versus NHE5). As in mammals, the C. elegansexchangers appear to be grouped into at least two distinct branches, with NHX-1, -2, -3, -6, and -9 on one branch and NHX-4, -5, -7, and -8 on the other; NHX-5 and -8 of the latter branch appear to be closely related to the human intracellular exchangers NHE6 and NHE7. It is important to note, however, that NHX-3 is not the worm ortholog of NHE3, and so on, for the entire family. We first created transgenic animals expressing GFP from promoter-transgene reporter fusion constructs driven by a 4-kb genomic fragment from upstream of the first putative start codon for each NHX family mRNA (see Fig. 1). In each case, the start codon was modified by mutagenesis such that it would not be utilized. Transgenic animals were identified based upon co-injection of a plasmid encoding the rol-6 marker, which results in a roller phenotype (32Kramer J.M. French R.P. Park E.C. Johnson J.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 2081-2089Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). One caveat in the interpretation of these results is that the injected plasmids are inherited as non-physiological multi-copy extra-chromosomal arrays and may lack sequences that are necessary for cell-specific regulation; thus, these results should be considered an approximation of the nhx gene family cell expression patterns until verified by the use of specific antibodies or in situ analysis. In addition, the loss of the array during cell division produces a phenomenon known as mosaicism; individual animals may not exhibit the full repertoire of cells that are known to express the transgene. Thus, the results shown in Figs.2 and 3represent images of multiple animals taken from at least three separate transgenic lines.Figure 3Fluorescent profiles of transgenic nematodes expressing NHX:: GFP translational fusion proteins. A genomic fragment containing the promoter and entire open reading frame of each nhx gene was fused in-frame to GFP (see “Experimental Procedures”). The subcellular location of each NHX::GFP fusion protein was determined by either conventional or confocal fluorescent microscopy. Fluorescent images are shown next to the corresponding differential interference contrast photomicrographs. A and B, a transgenic line expressing a translational NHX-1::GFP fusion protein fluoresced in a wide variety of tissues, including muscle and hypodermal cells as well as in the pharynx. The fusion protein had an intracellular distribution (inset of panel A).C and D, NHX-2::GFP is targeted to the luminal surface of intestinal cell membranes, as demonstrated by confocal microscopy. The granular staining in the intestine is comprised of auto-fluorescent granules; using a system where color resolution is available, these granules will fluoresce yellow (see below).E and F, NHX-7:GFP is located on the basolateral surface of the posterior intestinal cells. G andH, NHX-6::GFP is expressed through the entire intestine, but the targeting of NHX-6::GFP is basolateral at the posterior and anterior ends of the intestine and apical in the middle, where the expression level is relatively weak. I and J, NHX-4::GFP is expressed ubiquitously and is localized to the plasma membrane (inset of panel I). K andL, NHX-3::GFP is expressed in the hypodermal cells of the main body syncitium as well as the ut1 cells of the vulva and the spermathecal junction cell (inset of panel K). Expression of the NHX-3::GFP protein appears to occur in a punctate pattern that is evenly distributed throughout the hypodermal cells (panels M and N). O and P, NHX-5 is a pan-neural Na+-H+ exchanger that resides intracellularly, as shown in this fluorescent micrograph of the lumbar ganglion from NHX-5::GFP transgenic worms. Q andR, NHX-8::GFP is expressed in the seam cells and other tissues (see “Results”), and the NHX-8::GFP protein appears to accumulate in a punctate, perinuclear expression pattern (inset of Q). S and T, NHX-9::GFP is targeted to an intracellular domain, as shown in this confocal micrograph taken through the excretory cell body. NHX-9::GFP is expressed uniformly along both processes of the excretory cell in young larva (inset of S), but the intracellular localization becomes more restricted and appears like beads-on-a-string in the adults.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) When GFP expression was driven by the promoter sequences upstream of the NHX-1-, NHX-2-, NHX-6-, or NHX-7-coding sequences, fluorescence was found nearly exclusively in the intestine of the worm (Fig. 2,panels A–H). The entire intestine was labeled evenly in thenhx-1:: GFP and nhx-2:: GFP transgenic animals (panels A–D); however, the nhx-1:: GFP labeling was most likely an artifact, as discussed below. nhx-2:: GFPlabeling was strong in both L1 and L2 larval animals, then diminished with age (data not shown). The anterior and posterior intestinal segments were labeled in the nhx-6:: GFP animal, with a distinct gradient observed along the anterior segment (panels G and H). In contrast, the nhx-7:: GFPreporter resulted in fluorescence specifically and exclusively in the posterior cells of the intestine (panels E andF). Similarly, GFP expression was restricted primarily to a single cell or cell type in a surprisingly large number of transgenic strains (see Fig. 4 for schematic and synopsis). Thenhx-3 promoter drove GFP expression in the hypodermal cells of the main body syncytium (Fig. 2, panels I andJ), whereas expression from the nhx-8:: GFPtransgene resulted in fluorescence exclusively in the hypodermal seam cells (Fig. 2, panels O and"

Hemmerich P. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1980; 8: 246-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). It catalyzes dehydrogenation of the d-isomer of the amino acids to give the corresponding α-imino acids and, after subsequent hydrolysis, α-keto acids and ammonia (for a review see Refs. 2Curti B.

DAAO shows a broad substrate specificity; the best substrates are apolar d-amino acids, but it is also active on polar and basic d-amino acids. The acidic d-amino acids glutamate and aspartate are the only d-amino acids not oxidized by DAAO; they are substrates of d-aspartate oxidase (EC 1.4.3.1, DASPO). DAAO from the yeast Rhodotorula gracilis (RgDAAO) possesses peculiar properties, such as highly efficient catalysis and tight binding with the coenzyme FAD, properties which distinguish it from the mammalian enzyme (2Curti B.

Beef kidney DASPO and pig kidney DAAO show a high degree of similarity in terms of molecular weight, primary sequence, and interaction between FAD and the flavin-binding site (14Negri A. Massey V. Williams C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10026-10034Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), as well as in the ability to act on d-proline and thiazolidine-2-carboxylic acid (15Burns C.L. Main D.E. Buckthal D.J. Hamilton G.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1984; 125: 1039-1045Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Despite these similarities, the kinetic mechanism (the main difference concerns the step where the product is released) (16Porter D.J.T. Voet J.G. Bright H.J. J. Biol.

Chem. 1988; 263: 13557-13563Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the substrate specificity of the two oxidases differ. The mammalian DAAO and DASPO differ from the yeast DAAO in that the kinetic efficiency is lower (mainly due to a different location of the rate-limiting step) (6Pollegioni L. Langkau B. Tischer W.

Industrially, the DAAO reaction has mainly been used to remove the side chain of cephalosporin C to give 7-aminocephalosporanic acid, a key intermediate for the production of semi-synthetic cephalosporin antibiotics (18Pilone M.S. Pollegioni L. Biocat. Biotrans. 2002; 20: 145-159Crossref Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The redox reaction of DAAO can also be exploited in the production of α-keto acids, in the resolution of racemic mixtures of amino acids, and in the analytical determination ofd-amino acids (3Pilone M.S. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2000; 57: 1732-1747Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). d-Isomers of amino acids, formed during food processing as well as originating from microbial sources, are considered indicators of food quality (for a review see Ref. 19Friedman M. J. Agric. Food Chem. 1999; 47: 3457-3479Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar) and may become part of the human diet. As a means of quickly and selectively detecting and determining d-amino acid content, an amperometric and a colorimetric biosensor have been devised recently (20Sacchi S. Pollegioni L. Pilone M.S. Rossetti C. Biotechnol. Tech. 1998; 12: 149-153Crossref Scopus (47) Google Scholar) using RgDAAO. However, because the enzyme does not oxidize acidic d-amino acids, it cannot be used to detect the total amount of d-amino acids in biological samples. We attempted to use rational design as a strategy for understanding the modulation of the substrate specificity exerted by the active site residues of RgDAAO, to obtain an enzyme that is increasingly more suitable for biotechnological applications. In the present study we investigated the features of substrate recognition by DAAO, combining the structural and functional information available on DAAO and DASPO with the simulated annealing docking of d-aspartate at the active site of DAAO and at the active site of a model of DASPO. We thus report on the rational design and the characterization of a single point mutant (M213R) and of a double mutant (M213R/Y238R) of RgDAAO with a broader substrate specificity, and thus active on both neutral and acidic d-amino acids. Enzymatic DNA modifications were carried out according to the manufacturer's instructions and essentially as described in Sambrook et al.(21Sambrook J. Fritsch E.P. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The M213R mutant was generated by site-directed mutagenesis (Altered Sites® II kit, Promega), using the cDNA coding for the wild-type RgDAAO subcloned into the pAlterTM vector (8Harris C.M. Molla G. Pilone M.S. Pollegioni L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36233-36240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 9Molla G. Porrini D. Job V. Motteran L. Vegezzi C. Campaner S. Pilone M.S. Pollegioni L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24715-24721Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The mutation was introduced using the following 31-mer mutagenic oligonucleotide GCAAGCGATGCACGCGTGACTCGTCCGACCC. The mutant cDNA (confirmed by automated DNA sequencing) was subcloned into theEcoRI restriction site of the pT7.7A expression vector (pT7-M213R). The double mutant was generated using the cDNA coding for M213R and Y238R single-point mutants. pT7-M213R and pT7-Y238R vectors were digested with NdeI and SexAI. The two NdeI-SexAI-digested fragments containing the M213R and the Y238R mutation (of 702 and 2967 bp, respectively) were ligated to give the pT7-M213R/Y238R expression plasmid. The introduction of the desired mutations was confirmed by automated DNA sequencing. DAAO activity was assayed with an oxygen electrode at pH 8.5 and 25 °C, using 28 mmd-alanine as substrate (4Pilone M.S. Pollegioni L. Casalin P. Curti B. Ronchi S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 180: 199-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). One DAAO unit was defined as the amount of enzyme that converted 1 μmol ofd-alanine per min at 25 °C. The kinetic parameters of the DAAO reaction with different d-amino acids were determined in 100 mm sodium pyrophosphate buffer, pH 8.5, at 25 °C (22Pollegioni L. Falbo A. Pilone M.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1120: 11-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The spectral experiments were carried out in 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, 5 mm2-mercaptoethanol, and 0.3 mm EDTA at 15 °C. The extinction coefficient for the oxidized M213R mutant DAAO was determined by measuring the change in absorbance after release of the flavin by heat denaturation (an extinction coefficient of 11,300m−1 cm−1 at 450 nm for free FAD was used). Photoreduction experiments were carried out at 15 °C using an anaerobic cuvette containing 8 μm enzyme, in the buffer described above which contained 5 mm EDTA and 0.5 μm 5-deazaflavin and was made anaerobic by alternative cycles of vacuum and O2-free argon (8Harris C.M.

Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 9-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). The thermodynamic stability of the semiquinone was determined by adding 5 μm benzyl viologen from a side arm of the cuvette after photoreduction had completed. Redox potentials of the M213R mutant were determined by the method of dye equilibration (24Minnaert K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1965; 110: 42-56Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using the xanthine/xanthine oxidase reduction system (25Massey V. Curti B. Ronchi S. Zanetti G. Flavins and Flavoproteins. Walter de Gruyter & Co., Berlin1991: 59-66Google Scholar) at 15 °C and in the absence of EDTA and 2-mercaptoethanol. The reaction was initiated by the addition of 10 nm xanthine oxidase to an anaerobic cuvette containing ∼10 μm enzyme, 0.2 mmxanthine, 5 μm benzyl viologen, and 1.5–10 μm of the appropriate dye (25Massey V. Curti B. Ronchi S. Zanetti G. Flavins and Flavoproteins. Walter de Gruyter & Co., Berlin1991: 59-66Google Scholar, 26Pollegioni L. Porrini D. Molla G. Pilone M.S. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 6624-6632Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The amount of oxidized and reduced dye and of oxidized, semiquinone, and reduced enzyme was determined spectrophotometrically either at an isosbestic point for the dye or by subtraction of the dye contribution in the 400–500 nm region (26Pollegioni L. Porrini D. Molla G. Pilone M.S. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 6624-6632Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The redox potential, Eh, for the system at equilibrium was calculated from the Nernst Equation1, Eh=Em+(2.3RT/nF)log((oxidized form)/(reduced form))Equation 1 where R is the gas constant; Tis the absolute temperature; F is Faraday's constant; andn is the number of electrochemical equivalents. The data were then plotted as described by Minnaert (24Minnaert K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1965; 110: 42-56Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), i.e. the log(oxidized/reduced) couples for the enzyme was plotted against log(oxidized/reduced) concentration ratio for the dye. TheEm value for the enzyme (two-electron transfer) was determined from the ΔEm value between the standard dye and DAAO from the value of log(oxidized/reduced) for the enzyme when the log(oxidized/reduced) for the dye is zero. The oxidation/reduction potential for one-electron transfer for the coupleEFlox/EFlseq(E1) was determined by plotting the ratio of the concentrations of the oxidized and semiquinone forms of DAAO, and the one-electron transfer potential for the coupleEFlseq/EFlred(E2) was similarly determined by plotting the ratio of the concentration of the semiquinone and reduced forms of the enzyme. The separation between the two single-electron transfers was also estimated from the maximal percentage of the semiquinone form of the enzyme reached during a reduction experiment in the absence of the reference dye (25Massey V. Curti B. Ronchi S. Zanetti G. Flavins and Flavoproteins. Walter de Gruyter & Co., Berlin1991: 59-66Google Scholar, 26Pollegioni L. Porrini D. Molla G. Pilone M.S. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 6624-6632Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) (Equations 2 and 3). ΔEm=59mV×logKEquation 2 K=[EF1seq]2/[EF1red][EF1ox]Equation 3 Dissociation constants for ligands were measured spectrophotometrically by addition of small volumes of concentrated stock solutions to samples containing 1 ml of ∼10 μmenzyme, at 15 °C. The change in absorbance was plotted as a function of ligand concentration, after correcting for any volume change. The possibility to use DAAO mutants in a biosensor (Midaspro, Sartorius A.G.) for the detection ofd-amino acid concentration was evaluated by means of amperometry in stirred solutions essentially as described previously (20Sacchi S. Pollegioni L. Pilone M.S. Rossetti C. Biotechnol. Tech. 1998; 12: 149-153Crossref Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Small volumes (25–200 μl) of concentrated d-amino acid solution were added to 5 ml of 100 mm sodium pyrophosphate buffer, pH 8.5, in the cell, while stirring at a constant rate and applying a fixed voltage (+400 mV versus Ag/AgCl). The steady-state anodic currents were recorded ∼3 min after a fixed amount of enzyme had been added in the measuring cell (the time required to reach 95% of the steady-state anodic current). Previously, it was demonstrated for wild-type DAAO that the slope of the current intensity increase, as well as the finale value reached, depends on thed-amino acid concentration (20Sacchi S. Pollegioni L. Pilone M.S. Rossetti C. Biotechnol. Tech. 1998; 12: 149-153Crossref Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In complex with trifluoro-d-alanine, the Protein Data Bank code is1c0p (7Umhau S. Pollegioni L. Molla G. Diederichs K. Welte W. Pilone M.S. Ghisla S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12463-12468Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar); in complex with anthranilate the Protein Data Bank accession code is 1c0i. The active site of RgDAAO in a complex with trifluoro-d-alanine showed that the α-carboxylic group of the d-amino acid interacts electrostatically with the γ- and ε-amino groups of Arg-285 (at ∼2.8 Å), and it was H-bound to the hydroxyl groups of Tyr-223 and Tyr-238. The substrate α-amino group was H-bound symmetrically to the backbone C=O group of Ser-335 and to an active site water molecule, whereas the substrate side chain was oriented toward the hydrophobic binding pocket of the active site (see Fig. 1A) (7Umhau S. Pollegioni L. Molla G. Diederichs K. Welte W. Pilone M.S. Ghisla S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12463-12468Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). The substrate-binding pocket was encompassed by the side chains of Asn-54, Thr-56, Phe-58, Met-213, Tyr-223, Ile-225, Tyr-238, Arg-285, and Ser-335 (all of these residues are at a distance ≤6 Å from the β-carbon of the d-amino acid). In particular the side chain of Met-213 was 3.8 Å from the β-C group of trifluoro-d-alanine. By using the Swiss model software at the ExPASy facility (27Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2714-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (9641) Google Scholar), a model of the three-dimensional structure of DASPO was predicted, using the protein sequence of DASPO from bovine kidney (27 and 40% amino acid sequence identity with RgDAAO and pig kidney DAAO, respectively) (28Faotto L. Pollegioni L. Ceciliani F. Ronchi S. Pilone M.S. Biotechnol. Lett. 1995; 17: 193-198Crossref Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 29Negri A. Ceciliani F. Tedeschi G. Simonic T. Ronchi S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11865-11871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the crystal structure of DAAO (7Umhau S. Pollegioni L. Molla G. Diederichs K. Welte W. Pilone M.S. Ghisla S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12463-12468Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 11Mattevi A. Vanoni M.A. Todone F. Rizzi M. Teplyakov A. Coda A. Bolognesi M. Curti B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7496-7501Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). A comparison of the active site of DAAO with the model derived for DASPO showed the presence of two additional arginines in the active site of the latter, which are not present in RgDAAO (Fig. 1B); Arg-216 and Arg-237 seemed to be located in a position resembling that of Met-213 and Tyr-238 in DAAO. d-Aspartate binding into the active site of both RgDAAO and DASPO model was achieved using a Monte Carlo-simulated annealing algorithm that predicted the bound conformations of flexible ligands to macromolecules (AutoDock 2.4 software) (30Goodsell D.S. Olson D.J. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1990; 8: 195-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (1053) Google Scholar, 31Morris G.M. Goodsell D.S. Huey R. Olson D.J. J. Comput. Aided Mol. Des. 1996; 10: 293-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (944) Google Scholar). Among the theoretical DAAO-d-aspartate complexes, the one possessing the lowest energy conformation contained the substrate in a reverse configuration with respect to that observed with trifluoro-d-alanine, i.e. the acidic group of the side chain was located in the position normally occupied by the α-carboxylic group of the substrate (Fig.2A). This alteration of the orientation of the αC-H bond with respect to the N(5)-flavin position may explain the inactivity of wild-type DAAO toward acidicd-amino acids. In the DASPO model the carboxylic side chain group was involved in a network of electrostatic and hydrogen bonding with neighboring amino acids (in particular with Arg-216 and Arg-237, see Fig. 1B) that correspond to the shell residues with neutral or slightly polar characteristics in DAAO. Therefore, in an effort to stabilize the binding of d-aspartate in the correct orientation at the active site of RgDAAO, the Met-213 residue was mutated in arginine. A theoretical model of the simulated docking of d-aspartate at the active site of the mutant is depicted in Fig. 2B. It clearly shows an electrostatic interaction of the carboxylic side chain of d-aspartate with the positively charged side chain of Arg-213 (distance ≤3.3 Å). With the same aim, an additional arginine was introduced by replacing Tyr-238 in DAAO active site, a position corresponding to Arg-237 in DASPO model (double-point mutant M213R/Y238R DAAO, see Fig. 2C). The M213R mutant was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified using the protocol reported for the wild-type RgDAAO (32Molla G. Vegezzi C. Pilone M.S. Pollegioni L. Protein Expression Purif. 1998; 14: 289-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Starting from a 10-liter fermentation broth, 12 mg of pure enzyme with a specific activity of 3.5 units/mg protein was achieved (compared with a figure of 180 mg of pure enzyme with a specific activity of 110 units/mg protein obtained for the recombinant wild-type DAAO) (32Molla G. Vegezzi C. Pilone M.S. Pollegioni L. Protein Expression Purif. 1998; 14: 289-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The lower expression of the mutant was not due to protein instability or proteolytic processes, because no proteolysis products have been detected on Western blot of crude extracts. In addition, comparison by Western blot analysis of the amount of DAAO present in the whole cell paste and in the crude extracts excluded inclusion bodies formation. An overall purification yield of ≥30% was obtained. The protein was about 95% pure and yielded a single band at ∼40 kDa in SDS-PAGE. Like the wild-type enzyme, the purified variant DAAO was a dimeric holoenzyme and was stable when stored at −20 °C for several months. The visible spectrum of the oxidized form of the mutant enzyme showed a hyperchromic change of the flavin peaks (TableI), indicative of a more polar microenvironment surrounding the flavin coenzyme. Anaerobic addition of an excess of d-alanine resulted in the instantaneous and full reduction of the mutant enzyme during mixing (data not shown) (4Pilone M.S. Pollegioni L. Casalin P. Curti B. Ronchi S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 180: 199-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), demonstrating that the M213R mutant of RgDAAO was competent in catalysis. The specific activity on d-alanine as substrate was significantly reduced in the mutant (Table I). Under anaerobic conditions, the M213R mutant forms an anionic (red) flavin semiquinone on photoreduction (23Massey V. Hemmerich P. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 9-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). Both wild-type and M213R DAAO undergo quite complete semiquinone formation on light irradiation in the presence of EDTA (Table I).Table IComparison of properties of wild-type and M213R mutant of R. gracilisd-amino-acid oxidaseWild-typeM213RGeneral properties Aggregation stateDimeric1-aFrom Ref. 32.Dimeric Specific activity (units/mg)1101-aFrom Ref. 32.3.5Flavin properties ɛ455nm oxidized form (mm−1cm−1)12.61-aFrom Ref. 32.13.5 A274/A455ratio8.29.7 Semiquinone measured (%)≥951-bFrom Ref 4.97 pKa N(3)H10.6 ± 0.21-cFrom Ref. 38.10.6 ± 0.1Binding properties1-dWavelengths used for Kd determinations were 458 nm for l(+)-tartrate and for sodium sulfite, 482 nm for sodium benzoate and oxalacetate, and 544 nm for sodium anthranilate.

To investigate the substrate specificity of M213R DAAO mutant, air-saturated solutions of different substrates were tested by measuring oxygen consumption using a Rank electrode (4Pilone M.S. Pollegioni L. Casalin P. Curti B. Ronchi S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 180: 199-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) in both wild-type and M213R DAAOs. We reported previously (22Pollegioni L. Falbo A. Pilone M.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1120: 11-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) that RgDAAO does not oxidize acidicd-amino acids (no oxygen consumption was detected under standard conditions). The recent observation (7Umhau S. Pollegioni L. Molla G. Diederichs K. Welte W. Pilone M.S. Ghisla S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Under similar experimental conditions, even d-aspartate and d-glutamate reduced the flavin coenzyme of wild-type RgDAAO (data not shown). Although the polarographic assay did not show a measurable O2 consumption under standard conditions when an acidicd-amino acid was used as substrate, a detectable trace could be observed by using a large amount (∼30–80 μg) of pure wild-type DAAO and a very high concentration of acidicd-amino acids. On the other hand, the recombinant M213R DAAO showed a detectable trace using the polarographic assay ond-alanine, d-aspartate, andd-glutamate as substrates in the presence of the same low amount of enzyme in the polarographic assay (2–6 μg). A comparison of the kinetic parameters of M213R DAAO, determined at a fixed (0.253 mm) O2 concentration using variousd-amino acids, with the values determined for wild-type DAAO and with those reported for beef DASPO is shown in TableII.

Because hypertriglyceridemia is an independent risk factor in coronary artery disease and the presence in plasma of triglyceride-rich remnant lipoproteins is correlated with atherosclerosis, considerable research efforts have been focused on the identification of factors regulating apoCIII gene expression to decrease its production. Here we report that the orphan nuclear hormone receptor Rev-erbα regulates the human apoCIII gene promoter. In apoCIII expressing human hepatic HepG2 cells, transfection of Rev-erbα specifically repressed apoCIII gene promoter activity. We determined by deletion and site-directed mutagenesis experiments that Rev-erbα dependent repression is mainly due to an element present in the proximal promoter of the apoCIII gene. In contrast, we found no functional Rev-erbα response elements in the convergently transcribed human apoAI gene or the common regulatory enhancer. The identified Rev-erbα response element coincides with a RORα1 element, and in the present study we provide evidence that functional cross-talk between these orphan receptors modulates the apoCIII promoter. In vitro binding analysis showed that monomers of Rev-erbα bound this element but not another upstream RORα1 response element. In addition, we showed that the closely related nuclear orphan receptor RVR also specifically repressed the human apoCIII gene. These studies underscore a novel physiological role for members of the Rev-erb family of nuclear receptors in the regulation of genes involved in triglyceride metabolism and the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis.

Therefore, the identification of factors capable of decreasing plasma apoCIII concentrations by down-regulation of its expression is of major importance for the treatment of dyslipidemia.In humans, apoCIII is synthesized in the liver and, to a much lesser extent, in the intestine. The expression of apoCIII is strongly regulated at the transcriptional level, and the regulatory sequences responsible for the tissue-specific expression pattern of the apoCIII gene and for its modulation by signal transduction pathways have been extensively described (reviewed in Ref. 24Zannis V.I. Kan H.Y. Kritis A. Zanni E.E. Kardassis D. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 2001; 12: 181-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The 5′-flanking region of the human apoCIII gene contains a proximal promoter and a distal regulatory enhancer (25Ogami K. Hadzopoulou-Cladaras M. Cladaras C. Zannis V.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9808-9815Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The gene for apoCIII resides in an apolipoprotein gene cluster on chromosome 11q23 between the apoAI and apoAIV genes (26Karathanasis S.K. McPherson J. Zannis V.I. Breslow J.L. Nature. 1983; 304: 371-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 27Karathanasis S.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 6374-6378Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). The product of the convergently transcribed apoAI gene is the major protein component of high density lipoproteins. Plasma levels of apoAI and high density lipoprotein cholesterol correlate with each other, and both correlate inversely with the incidence of coronary heart disease (28Miller N.E. Am.

Importantly, the distal regulatory region of apoCIII acts as a common enhancer for the three genes of the cluster (24Zannis V.I. Kan H.Y. Kritis A. Zanni E.E. Kardassis D. Curr. Opin.

Rev-erbα mRNA is induced dramatically during adipogenesis (45Chawla A. Lazar M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16265-16269Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and a role has also been proposed for both Rev-erbα and RVR in myogenesis (46Burke L. Downes M. Carozzi A. Giguère V. Muscat G.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 3481-3489Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the specific biological functions of these receptors in adipogenesis or in other physiological processes are still unknown.Monomers of Rev-erbα and RVR bind to the six-nucleotide core motif PuGGTCA preceded by a 6-bp AT-rich region (36Dumas B. Harding H.P. Choi H.S. Lehmann K.A. Chung M. Lazar M.A. Moore D.D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 996-1005PubMed Google Scholar, 37Forman B.M. Chen J. Blumberg B. Kliewer S.A. Henshaw R. Ong E.S.

Biol. 1995; 15: 4791-4802Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). In addition, homodimers of Rev-erbα and RVR bind to a direct repeat of the core sequence separated by two nucleotides with an AT-rich 5′ extension (Rev-DR2) (40Adelmant G. Bègue A. Stéhelin D. Laudet V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 3553-3558Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 48Harding H.P. Lazar M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4791-4802Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Although the core binding site is recognized by the P-box/first helix of the DNA-binding domain, the precise recognition of the sequences 5′ to the core binding site is determined by the C-terminal extension of the zinc finger domains (49Hsu M.H. Palmer C.N. Song W. Griffin K.J. Johnson E.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27988-27997Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Rev-erbα and RVR share a high degree of sequence similarity with the C-terminal extension/third helix of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) (NR1C) and retinoic acid-related orphan receptors (RORs, also termed RZRs) (NR1F). As a consequence, Rev-erbα binds to the PPAR response elements of CYP4A6 and the hydratase/dehydrogenase bifunctional enzyme genes and interferes with the PPAR-dependent transactivation of the former gene (42Kassam A. Capone J.P. Rachubinski R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22895-22900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 49Hsu M.H. Palmer C.N. Song W. Griffin K.J. Johnson E.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27988-27997Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Conversely, the Rev-DR2 site described in the promoter of the human Rev-erbα gene is also a PPAR response element (50Gervois P Chopin-Delannoy S. Fadel A. Dubois G. Kosykh V. Fruchart J.C. Najib J. Laudet V. Staels B. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 400-409PubMed Google Scholar). It should be noted that although the sequence determinants required for Rev-erbα and PPAR bindings are similar, they are not identical as evidenced by the incapacity of Rev-erbα to bind to the fatty acyl-CoA oxidase PPAR response element (42Kassam A. Capone J.P. Rachubinski R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22895-22900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 49Hsu M.H. Palmer C.N. Song W. Griffin K.J. Johnson E.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27988-27997Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The gene for N-myc, as well as the rat α-fetoprotein and apoAI genes, have been shown to contain elements that bind and are regulated by members of both Rev-erb and RORα groups (41Dussault I. Giguère V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1860-1867Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 43Bois-Joyeux B. Chauvet C. Nacer-Chérif H. Bergeret W. Mazure N. Giguère V. Laudet V. Danan J.L.

Chem. 1998; 273: 25713-25720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). The sequence requirements for RORα, Rev-erbα, and RVR are closely related (37Forman B.M. Chen J. Blumberg B. Kliewer S.A. Henshaw R. Ong E.S. Evans R.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 1253-1261Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, they are not identical (49Hsu M.H. Palmer C.N. Song W. Griffin K.J. Johnson E.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27988-27997Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), so the putative cross-talk between those nuclear receptors should be analyzed in terms of case-by-case studies.We have learnt from Staels and co-workers (51Raspé E. Duez H. Gervois P. Fiévet C. Fruchart J.C. Besnard S. Mariani J. Tedgui A. Staels B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2865-2871Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) that RORα1 regulates apoCIII gene transcription through binding sites located in its proximal promoter. The importance of RORα in apoCIII expression was underscored by studies with the staggerer mice, which carry a natural deletion in the RORα gene (52Hamilton B.A. Frankel W.N. Kerrebrock A.W. Hawkins T.L. FitzHugh W. Kusumi K. Russell L.B. Mueller K.L. van Berkel V. Birren B.W. Kruglyak L. Lander E.S. Nature. 1996; 379: 736-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). These mice show decreased plasma triglyceride and apoCIII levels compared with wild type mice (51Raspé E. Duez H. Gervois P. Fiévet C. Fruchart J.C. Besnard S. Mariani J. Tedgui A. Staels B. J.

Rev-erbα represses transcription through one of the functional RORα1 response elements present in the apoCIII gene proximal promoter. Our results suggest a novel role for Rev-erbα in regulating triglyceride metabolism.DISCUSSIONIt is well established that the expression of human apoCIII plays a key role in hypertriglyceridemia (10Ginsberg H.N., Le, N.A.

Am. Heart J. 1987; 113: 589-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar, 56Paszty C. Maeda N. Verstuyft J. Rubin E.M. J. Clin.

Looking for factors capable of reducing the expression of apoCIII without having negative effects on human apoAI or other lipid-related genes, we found that human apoCIII is a selective target gene for orphan nuclear receptor Rev-erbα. Here we show that this transcription factor specifically represses apoCIII through an element present in the promoter, which coincides with one of the two functional RORα1 response elements described previously (51Raspé E. Duez H. Gervois P. Fiévet C. Fruchart J.C. Besnard S. Mariani J. Tedgui A. Staels B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2865-2871Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Our results identify cross-talk between human Rev-erbα and RORα1 that is restricted to apoCIII proximal promoter and is not present in the distal common regulatory enhancer or in the promoter of human apoAI. Interestingly, this Rev-erbα response element (nt −29/−18) overlaps the TATA box of apoCIII promoter (Fig. 4A). It remains as an interesting question for future research to determine whether modulation of transcription by Rev-erbα could also involve cross-talk with the TATA-binding protein in this promoter. However, the contribution of this putative cross-talk to the net repression should not play an important part because we have demonstrated that this element can confer Rev-erbα responsiveness when cloned in front of the TK promoter. Strikingly, the Rev-erbα response element of the rat apoAI promoter (nt −32/−21) also overlaps the TATA box. This phenomenon gives further insight into the understanding of the process of the evolution of the apoAI and apoCIII genes from a common ancestor (58Haddad I.A. Ordovas J.M. Fitzpatrick T. Karathanasis S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 13268-13277Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Importantly, our findings are in accord with data showing an increase in the hepatic apoCIII mRNA levels in Rev-erbα-deficient mice (59Duez H.M. Mansén A. Fruchart J.C. Vennström B. Fiévet C. Staels B. Circulation. 1998; 98: I449-I450Google Scholar). Based on the similarity between the sequence of the Rev-erbα-responsive element of the mouse apoCIII gene promoter and its human counterpart (55Januzzi J.L. Azrolan N. O'Connell A. Aalto-Setälä K. Breslow J.L. Genomics. 1992; 14: 1081-1088Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), these results in vivo can most likely be extended to the human apoCIII gene. On the other hand, although we have found that RVR also represses the apoCIII gene promoter, the Rev-erbα knockout mice data would indicate that RVR has no complete overlapping function compared with Rev-erbα. Even so, it remains to be determined whether mice carrying at the same time disruptions of both Rev-erbα and RVR genes could have even higher levels of apoCIII expression.Luciferase reporter assays made in the context of the natural promoter suggest that the other functional RORE, located in nt −82/−71, might have a slight contribution to Rev-erbα-mediated repression of human apoCIII gene. However, in contrast to the site at −29/−18, it does not confer Rev-erbα responsiveness to a heterologous promoter. In addition, gel shift assays show that the binding of Rev-erbα, if any, should be very weak. Conversely, we and others have shown that it confers a weak RORα1 responsiveness to the TK promoter and is capable of binding RORα1 in vitro (51Raspé E. Duez H. Gervois P. Fiévet C. Fruchart J.C.

This site discrimination underlines a somewhat different affinity of binding to DNA and suggests the hypothesis that functional ROREs in other promoters could be unresponsive to Rev-erbα.Our data and those reported previously demonstrate that the Rev-erb subfamily functions as dominant transcriptional repressors (40Adelmant G.

Chem. 1998; 273: 25713-25720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Some crystallography studies suggest that Rev-erbα is de facto an orphan receptor because of the small size or absence of a ligand pocket (60Renaud J.P. Harris J.M. Downes M. Burke L.J. Muscat G.E. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 700-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in contrast to most ligand-activated factors, RORα receptors, which also still remain as orphan, and Rev-erb have arthropod homologues. Thus, it has been suggested that such orphans may represent ancestral receptors, before the evolution of ligands and/or ligand binding (61Escriva H. Safi R. Hänni C. Langlois M.C. Saumitou-Laprade P. Stehelin D. Capron A. Pierce R. Laudet V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6803-6808Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). The lack of ligand have hampered further assessment on the biological role of both receptors. Nevertheless, the convergence of the opposite transcriptional effects played by Rev-erb and RORα on a same gene suggests the existence of an orphan receptor-based signaling pathway. This mechanism should provide a fine tuning required for expression in response to a particular environmental or physiological cue. Because both subfamilies of receptors are expressed in human liver, the expression of apoCIII could be dictated, in part, by the ratio between the Rev-erb and RORα hepatic expression levels. In addition, the regulation of those signals could presumably come from the cellular status of some coregulators that interplay with the orphans (62Sauvé F. McBroom L.D. Gallant J. Moraitis A.N. Labrie F. Giguère V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 343-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar).Regulation of Rev-erbα expression has been achieved by treatment with fibrates (44Vu-Dac N.

Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 3799-3806Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because fibrates increase the hepatic expression of Rev-erbα through a PPARα-mediated activation of the Rev-erbα gene promoter, it has been pointed out that Rev-erbα could play a functional role in the transcriptional repression of rat apoAI by fibrates (44Vu-Dac N. Chopin-Delannoy S. Gervois P. Bonnelye E. Martin G. Fruchart J.C. Laudet V. Staels B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25713-25720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). As we have demonstrated, apoCIII promoter is repressed by Rev-erbα. Therefore, it is tempting to speculate that Rev-erbα is involved in the previously reported repression of apoCIII gene by fibrates. Studies with PPARα knockout mice have clearly demonstrated that PPARα is required in the negative regulation of apoCIII gene expression by fibrates (64Peters J.M. Hennuyer N. Staels B. Fruchart J.C. Fievet C. Gonzalez F.J. Auwerx J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27307-27312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). In contrast, the involvement of other factors in the transcriptional repression by these agents is still unclear. The hepatocyte nuclear factor-4 (HNF-4) (NR2A1) is a receptor required for the hepatic expression of apoCIII (24Zannis V.I. Kan H.Y. Kritis A. Zanni E.E. Kardassis D. Curr. Opin.

(1Matson G.A. Swanson J. Noades J. Sanger R. Race R.R. Am. J. Hum.

Swanson J. Noades J. Sanger R. Race R.R. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1959; 11: 26-34PubMed Google Scholar). Further studies later showed the P antigen to be globotetraosylceramide (Gb4Cer, globoside, GalNAcβ3Galα4Galβ4GlcCer),1the most abundant neutral glycolipid in the erythrocyte membrane (2Naiki M. Marcus D.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1974; 60: 1105-1111Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) as well as in other mesodermally derived tissues (3Cooling L.L. Koerner T.A. Naides S.J. J.

Later it was found that human fibroblasts with the Pk phenotype were deficient in β-N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase activity (5Kijimoto-Ochiai S. Naiki M. Makita A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5407-5410Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). With only few exceptions the molecular basis of the major human blood group antigens have been determined and the genes responsible for erythroid expression of the various phenotypes cloned and characterized. However, the biochemistry and molecular genetics behind the carbohydrate-based P1 antigen in the P blood group system (numerical nomenclature 003001 according to the International Society of Blood Transfusion, ISBT) 2Blood group antigens, phenotypes, and antibodies are designated according to the nomenclature recommended by the ISBT working party on terminology for red cell surface antigens.and the P, Pk, and LKE antigens in the GLOB collection (ISBT no. 209001, 209002, and 209003) are complex and not yet fully understood (6Daniels G.L.

Fig. 1 shows the biosynthetic route to these glycosphingolipid antigens by the sequential addition of monosaccharide residues to ceramide by different glycosyltransferases (7Marcus D.M. Immunol.

The key enzyme for initiation of globo-series glycolipid synthesis, UDP-galactose:lactosylceramide 4-α-galactosyltransferase (Gb3Cer/Pk/CD77 synthase, α4Gal-T), was independently cloned by three research teams in the year 2000 (8Steffensen R.

Attempts to find polymorphisms in the α4Gal-T gene correlating with P1+/P1− status were fruitless, however (8Steffensen R. Carlier K. Wiels J. Levery S.B. Stroud M. Cedergren B. Nilsson S.B.

Therefore, it is still unclear if another gene codes for P1 synthase (also an α4Gal-T) or if other mechanisms exist. Recently, the UDP-N-acetylgalactosamine:globotriaosylceramide 3-β-N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase (Gb4Cer/globoside synthase, EC 2.4.1.79, β3GalNAc-T1) gene and its product was characterized by Okajima et al.(12Okajima T. Nakamura Y. Uchikawa M. Haslam D.B. Numata S.I. Furukawa K. Urano T. Furukawa K. J. Biol.

Surprisingly enough, it turned out to be identical to a previously cloned gene, initially included in the 3-β-galactosyltransferase family based on genetic homology (13Amado M. Almeida R. Carneiro F. Levery S.B. Holmes E.H. Nomoto M. Hollingsworth M.A. Hassan H. Schwientek T. Nielsen P.A. Bennett E.P. Clausen H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12770-12778Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Although it resembled other 3-β-galactosyltransferases no enzymatic activity could be defined in the original study (13Amado M. Almeida R. Carneiro F. Levery S.B. Holmes E.H. Nomoto M.

Cells of the p phenotype, which lack P1/P/Pk antigens; of the P2k phenotype, which lack P1/P antigens; and of the P1k phenotype, which lack the P antigen are of principal interest because of potent naturally occurring antibodies that are regularly present in plasma. As in the ABO blood group system, antibodies of the IgM and IgG class (anti-PP1Pk, anti-P1P or anti-P) are made against the missing blood group antigens. While the frequency of the p phenotype in general has been estimated at 5.8 per million (14Race R.R. Sanger R. The P Blood Groups, Blood Groups in Man. Blackwell Scientific Publications, Oxford, UK1975: 139-177Google Scholar) it is considerably higher in certain populations, especially in Northern Sweden (15Cedergren B. Hereditas. 1973; 73: 27-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The frequency of the Pk phenotype is not known but it is generally accepted to be even rarer than p. The frequencies are possibly slightly higher in Finland and Japan but not as marked as for p in Northern Sweden (16Daniels G. P Blood Groups, Human Blood Groups. Blackwell Scientific, Oxford, UK1995: 227-256Google Scholar). There are several reasons for the scientific and medical attention spent investigating patients with these rare phenotypes (17Spitalnik P.F. Spitalnik S.L. Transfus. Med. Rev. 1995; 9: 110-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). P-related antibodies are implicated in hemolytic transfusion reactions if random antigen-positive blood is transfused. The P, P1, and Pkantigens are well developed on fetal erythrocytes but in most cases relatively mild hemolytic disease of the newborn because of the anti-PP1Pk or anti-P has been reported (16Daniels G. P Blood Groups, Human Blood Groups. Blackwell Scientific, Oxford, UK1995: 227-256Google Scholar). Women of the p and Pk phenotypes suffer a higher frequency of spontaneous abortion than normal, a phenomenon that is most likely due to the IgG anti-P component (18Cantin G. Lyonnais J. Transfusion. 1983; 23: 350-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The placenta expresses high levels of P and Pk antigen (as opposed to the early fetus itself) and has been suggested as the prime target for these antibodies (19Lindstrom K. Dem Borne A.E. Breimer M.E. Cedergren B. Okubo Y. Rydberg L. Teneberg S. Samuelsson B.E. Glycoconj. J. 1992; 9: 325-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Another anti-P-mediated disease usually seen in children following a viral infection is paroxysmal cold hemoglobinuria in which P-positive erythrocytes are lysed by a transient auto-anti-P (20Heddle N.M. Transfus. Med. Rev. 1989; 3: 219-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Globoside/P antigen has also been identified as a cellular receptor for parvo-B19 virus (21Brown K.E. Anderson S.M. Young N.S. Science. 1993; 262: 114-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar) that causes erythema infectiosum, also known as fifth disease, in children and sometimes is complicated by severe aplastic anemia. Complete viral replication and subsequent cell lysis are limited to early erythroid precursor cells expressing the globoside receptor (22Brown K.E. Young N.S. Blood Rev. 1995; 9: 176-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Individuals lacking the receptor appear to be naturally resistant to this infection (23Brown K.E. Hibbs J.R. Gallinella G. Anderson S.M. Lehman E.D. McCarthy P. Young N.S. N. Engl. J. Med. 1994; 330: 1192-1196Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Finally, it has also been shown that some P-fimbriated E. coli express globoside-binding molecules (PapF and PapG) at the tips of their pili (24Lindberg F.P. Lund B. Normark S. EMBO J. 1984; 3: 1167-1173Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), a finding with possible implications for their uropathogenicity. Because of the relationship to many human pathogens and diseases the interest in glycolipid-based blood group antigens remains high. In this study we tested the hypothesis that the reported β3GalNAc-T1/globoside synthase (12Okajima T. Nakamura Y. Uchikawa M. Haslam D.B. Numata S.I. Furukawa K. Urano T. Furukawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40498-40503Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) is indeed the enzyme responsible for synthesis of P blood group antigen. By analyzing the coding DNA sequence of the corresponding gene we show here for the first time that mutations capable of abolishing enzyme function are present in individuals with the Pk phenotype. Four blood samples of the Pkphenotype (one P1k and three P2k) were obtained from the liquid nitrogen in-house collection of test cells at the International Blood Group Reference Laboratory (IBGRL). The phenotype of the cells and presence of anti-P in serum were confirmed by standard serological methods at IBGRL and in two cases also by other reference laboratories. For screening of the detected missense mutations blood samples from apparently healthy random blood donors of mixed European descent were used. DNA was prepared from EDTA or acid-citrate-dextrose blood at the Blood Centre in Lund by a salting out method modified from Miller et al. (25Miller S.A. Dykes D.D. Polesky H.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 1215Crossref PubMed Scopus (17908) Google Scholar) and dissolved in H2O at a concentration of 100 ng/μl. Oligonucleotide primers were synthesized by DNA Technology ApS (Aarhus, Denmark). For each reaction 5 pmol of primers P-(-6)-F and P-1015-R or P-123-F and P-891-R (Table I) were mixed with 100 ng of genomic DNA, 2 nmol of each dNTP, 2% glycerol, 1% cresol red, and 0.5 units of AmpliTaq Gold (PerkinElmer/Roche Molecular Biochemicals) in the buffer supplied. The final reaction volume was 11 μl. Thermocycling was undertaken in a GeneAmp PCR system 2400 (PerkinElmer Cetus). Initial denaturation at 96 °C for 7 min was followed by 35 cycles at 94 °C for 30 s, 64 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 1 min, and a final extension for 2 min. PCR products were excised from 3% agarose gels (Seakem, FMC Bioproducts, Rockland, ME) stained with ethidium bromide (0.56 mg/liter gel, Sigma Chemicals) and purified using the QiaQuick gel extraction kit (Qiagen GmbH, Hilden, Germany). The Big Dye Terminator Cycle sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems Group) and an ABI PRISM 310 Genetic Analyser (Applied Biosystems Group) were used for direct DNA sequencing according to the manufacturer's instructions. Besides the PCR primers, internal primers (Table I) were used as sequencing primers. To avoid artifacts, sequencing was performed on both strands using independently obtained PCR fragments. Sequence analysis was performed with SeqEd software 1.03 (Applied Biosystems Group).Table IOligonucleotide primers used in this studyPrimer nameNucleotide sequence (5′→3′)FunctionP-(-6)-FGCTCGCGTGCTTCTGAGCTGa,bP-123-FACCTCAGCCTTCCCCACTACa,bP-238-RGGAGGTCACCAGAATGACCAGbP-263-FCATTCTGGTGACCTCCCACCbP-684-FAACCCATATTTCTTACCAGGAGbP-737-RTCCTTGGCACCAAATCTCTGGbP-797C-F(null)ACGTAAAACCCATCAAGTTTGCcP-797A-FCACGTAAAACCCATCAAGTTTGAcP-811A-F(null)ATCAAGTTTGAAGATGTTTATGTCAcP-811G-FTCAAGTTTGAAGATGTTTATGTCGcP-891-RCGTCTCAGTTGACAGACATCCa,bP-1015-RAAAGTATCCTGTCCTTCTAGGCa,b,cJK-F3LGCATGCTGCCATAGGATCATTGCcJK-R3LGAGCCAGGAGGTGGGTTTGCCcaPrimer used for amplification of PCR fragments for sequencing.bPrimer used as sequencing primer.cPrimer used for PCR-SSP to screen for presence of and confirm homozygosity for the two missense mutations.

For A797 → C detection 2.5 pmol of primer P-797C-null-F and P-1015-R were used together with 0.5 pmol of internal control primers JK-F3L and JK-R3L, modified from Ref. 26Olsson M.L. Irshaid N.M.

For G811 → A detection 7.5 pmol of primer P-811A-null-F and P-1015-R were used instead. For confirmation of homozygosity consensus primers P-797A-F and P-811G-F substituted P-797C-null-F and P-811A-null-F at 5 and 10 pmol per reaction, respectively. The annealing temperature for the latter reaction was increased to 65 °C for optimal specificity. Using the oligonucleotide primers shown in Table Ithe entire coding region of the β3GalNAc-T1 was amplified in one fragment in samples from donors with the phenotype P1k (n = 1, English), P2k (n = 3, Arabian, French, Finnish), or common GLOB collection/P blood group phenotypes (n = 2, Swedish). Sequence analysis of the amplified gene fragments was performed and compared with sequences deposited in GenBankTM: AB050855 (12Okajima T. Nakamura Y. Uchikawa M. Haslam D.B. Numata S.I. Furukawa K. Urano T. Furukawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40498-40503Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) and Y15062 (13Amado M. Almeida R. Carneiro F. Levery S.B. Holmes E.H.

The Swedish random donors had β3GalNAc-T1 gene sequences identical to the consensus GenBankTM entries. However, in two of the P2k samples homozygosity for two distinct nonsense mutations resulting in premature stop codons were detected. The Finnish sample was homozygous for C202 → T resulting in an immediate stop codon following residue 67. The Arabian sample was homozygous for a single adenosine insertion at nucleotide (nt) 537–538 (AG → AAG), here designated 538insA. This insertion causes a frameshift from amino acid 180 and a premature stop at codon 182 (consensus-Arg180-His181-Stop). The remaining two samples were homozygous for two different missense mutations. In the English P1k sample glycine at residue 271 is substituted for arginine because of G811 → A whereas glutamic acid is changed to alanine at residue 266 because of an A797 → C substitution in the French P2k sample. DNA sequencing chromatograms visualizing the detected sequences from wild-type and Pkdonors are found in Fig. 2.

No other deviations from the β3GalNAc-T1 consensus sequence were encountered in any of the analyzed samples. No mRNA studies could be undertaken due to lack of fresh samples. Because no other polymorphisms were detected in the β3GalNAc-T1 gene we ensured that both alleles were amplified for sequence analysis by using two independent PCR primer pairs, P-(-6)-F and P-1015-R or P-123-F and P-891-R. In two of the samples the presence of missense mutations and absence of consensus sequence were confirmed with genomic DNA and sequence-specific primers. Representative electrophoretograms are shown in Fig. 5. DNA samples of 220 mixed European blood donors were screened for the two missense mutations found during the study to exclude that they constitute common polymorphisms in the gene. Neither mutation was detected in any of the 440 alleles analyzed. Representative results outlining the screening procedure are shown in Fig. 5. The data presented in this report show that mutations in the recently cloned β3GalNAc-T1 gene are associated with the clinically important Pk phenotype in which synthesis of the globoside/P antigen cannot take place. The four samples analyzed were homozygous for rare alleles, which is not unexpected considering the low frequency of this phenotype in all populations. This is most probably due to consanguineous marriages as previously shown in at least 7 of 33 studied propositi of the Pk phenotype (16Daniels G. P Blood Groups, Human Blood Groups. Blackwell Scientific, Oxford, UK1995: 227-256Google Scholar). As is often the case with rare phenotypes when propositi from different ethnic groups and/or geographic areas are studied the molecular background for the samples in this study was quite heterogeneous. Similar data have been obtained for almost all rare blood group phenotypes with sporadic cases in most populations. Some of these variant phenotypes have a higher frequency in geographically isolated populations. A slightly increased frequency of the Pkphenotype has been noted in Japanese and Finns (16Daniels G. P Blood Groups, Human Blood Groups. Blackwell Scientific, Oxford, UK1995: 227-256Google Scholar). It is therefore possible that the allele with C202 → T encountered in the Finnish sample is a founder gene responsible for the Pkphenotype also in other Finnish cases similar to the situation with the rare Jk3 negative blood group phenotype in Finns (27Irshaid N.M. Henry S.M. Olsson M.L. Transfusion. 2000; 40: 69-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In two of the investigated samples nonsense mutations at nt 202 or 538 truncate the protein to 20 and 55% of its native length, respectively, thereby making any retention of enzymic activity impossible because the enzymatically active domain is in the carboxyl-terminal portion. This agrees well with other blood group-related glycosyltransferases that lose activity if severely truncated. For example, the commonO allele (O1) in the ABO blood group system has a single guanosine deletion at nt 261 causing a reading frameshift that truncates any translated product at residue 117 (28Yamamoto F. Clausen H. White T. Marken J. Hakomori S. Nature. 1990; 345: 229-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (893) Google Scholar) leaving no resemblance to A or B transferase after residue 86 (thus 25% of the amino acid sequence remains intact). Other examples are inactive forms of the FUT2 gene product, the 2-α-fucosyltransferase of the H blood group system, which are truncated at 55 and 61% of the full reading frame (29Koda Y. Soejima M. Liu Y. Kimura H. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1996; 59: 343-350PubMed Google Scholar). The other two Pk samples had missense mutations changing amino acids in the functionally active globular domain in the carboxyl-terminal portion of the transferase (30Paulson J.C. Colley K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17615-17618Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). By comparing the amino acid sequence of homologous genes (Fig. 4) it was shown that the mutated residues are either invariant or highly conserved among the sequences compared, suggesting their importance for the function of β3GalNAc-T. Furthermore, they are located in an evolutionarily conserved cluster of amino acids found in glycosyltransferases belonging to different functional families (β3Gal-T, β3GalNAc-T, and β3GlcNAc-T) in humans and also in a Drosophilahomologue, suggestive of importance for this region across species boundaries and enzyme specificities. Although not expressed and experimentally proven non-functional by enzyme analysis the data presented make it highly probable that both the E266A change from a large negatively charged to a small hydrophobic residue and the G271R change from a small non-charged to a large positively charged residue causes enough disturbance in this well conserved region to render the protein inactive. Again, analogy can be taken from the ABO system where the full-length O2 protein is rendered non-functional by a G268R change (31Yamamoto F. McNeill P.D. Yamamoto M. Hakomori S. Bromilow I.M. Duguid J.K. Vox Sang. 1993; 64: 175-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 32Yamamoto F. McNeill P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10515-10520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) at a conserved residue proposed to be exposed in the substrate-binding pocket of the 3-α-galactosyltransferase family (33Gastinel L.N. Bignon C. Misra A.K. Hindsgaul O. Shaper J.H. Joziasse D.H. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 638-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it has been shown unambiguously (14Race R.R. Sanger R. The P Blood Groups, Blood Groups in Man. Blackwell Scientific Publications, Oxford, UK1975: 139-177Google Scholar) that the P1 antigen (putative gene located on chromosome 22) is inherited independently from the P antigen (globoside synthase gene located on chromosome 3). Thus, there is no reason to believe that G271R and E266A are specific for the P1k and P2kphenotypes, respectively. The frequency of the P1 antigen among Caucasians is ∼75%. Any correlation of G811 → A (G271R) to P1+ status was effectively ruled out by PCR-SSP screening of the 220 samples, none of which were positive for the mutation while the majority was P1+. The P antigen may now be extracted from the GLOB collection and promoted to constitute a blood group system of its own according to the inclusion criteria set up by the ISBT working party on terminology for red cell surface antigens. The rule is that a blood group system has to be defined by a single genetic locus or possibly two (or three) closely linked loci so that the antigens included in that system are localized to the same (type of) molecule. Based on the data presented here the P antigen is now tied to a defined genetic locus different from other blood group loci and the molecular basis of the null (P1k and P2k) phenotypes of the system has been identified.

https://openalex.org/W2108456606,"Cingulin, a protein component of the submembrane plaque of tight junctions (TJ), contains globular and coiled-coil domains and interacts in vitro with several TJ and cytoskeletal proteins, including the PDZ protein ZO-1. Overexpression of Xenopus cingulin in transfected Xenopus A6 cells resulted in the disruption of endogenous ZO-1 localization, suggesting that cingulin functionally interacts with ZO-1. GlutathioneS-transferase pull-down experiments showed that a conserved ZO-1 interaction motif (ZIM) at the NH2 terminus of cingulin is required for cingulin-ZO-1 interaction in vitro. An NH2-terminal region of cingulin, containing the ZIM, was sufficient, when fused to coiled-coil sequences, to target transfected cingulin to junctions. However, deletion of the ZIM did not abolish junctional localization of transfected cingulin in A6 cells, suggesting that cingulin can be recruited to TJ through multiple protein interactions. Interestingly, the ZIM was required for cingulin recruitment into ZO-1-containing adherens junctions of Rat-1 fibroblasts, indicating that cingulin junctional recruitment does not require the molecular context of TJ. Cingulin coiled-coil sequences enhanced the junctional accumulation of expressed cingulin head region in A6 cells, but purified recombinant cingulin did not form filaments under physiological conditions in vitro, suggesting that the cingulin coiled-coil domain acts primarily by promoting dimerization."
https://openalex.org/W1980699866,"Integrin adhesion receptors appear to be regulated by molecules that bind to their cytoplasmic domains. We previously identified a 22-kDa, EF-hand-containing protein, CIB, which binds to the αIIb cytoplasmic tail of the platelet integrin, αIIbβ3. Here we describe regions within CIB and αIIb that interact with one another. CIB binding to αIIb cytoplasmic tail peptides, as measured by intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence, indicates a CIB-binding site within a hydrophobic, 15-amino acid, membrane-proximal region of αIIb. This region is analogous to the α-helical targets of other EF-hand-containing proteins, such as calcineurin B or calmodulin. A homology model of CIB based upon calcineurin B and recoverin indicated a conserved hydrophobic pocket within the C-terminal EF-hand motifs of CIB as a potential integrin-binding site. CIB engineered to contain alanine substitutions in the implicated regions retained wild type secondary structure as determined by circular dichroism, yet failed to bind αIIb in 11 of 12 cases, whereas CIB mutated within the N terminus retained binding activity. Thus, specific hydrophobic residues in the C terminus of CIB appear necessary for CIB binding to αIIb.

The major integrin adhesion receptor on platelets is αIIbβ3, or glycoprotein IIb-IIIa, which functions to support platelet aggregation and clot retraction. In resting platelets, αIIbβ3 is present in a low affinity state for its major ligand, plasma fibrinogen. When platelets become activated by various agonists, “inside-out” signaling results in the rapid activation of αIIbβ3 to a high affinity state. Ligand binding to activated αIIbβ3 then stimulates “outside-in” signaling, resulting in the recruitment of signaling molecules, further platelet activation, and cytoskeletal rearrangements. Although the mechanism of this bi-directional integrin signaling is unclear, it has been proposed to involve the binding of specific molecules to the integrin α and β cytoplasmic tails (reviewed in Refs. 1Parise L.V. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 597-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar and 2Shattil S.J. Kashiwagi H. Pampori N. Blood. 1998; 91: 2645-2657Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The cytoplasmic tails of most integrin α and β subunits are relatively short (from 20 to 70 amino acids). Although β subunits are generally more conserved than α subunits, the α subunits contain conserved N-terminal membrane-proximal elements with more varied C termini (3Simon K.O. Burridge K. Cheresh D.A. Mecham R.P. Integrins: Molecular and Biological Responses to the Extracellular Matrix. Academic Press, Orlando1994: 49-78Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The cytoplasmic tails of the αIIbβ3 integrin have been shown to form complexes in solution (4Haas T.A. Plow E.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6017-6026Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), whereas mutations in either the α or β cytoplasmic domain that are predicted to disrupt this interaction result in integrin activation (5Hughes P.E.

Other manipulations of the α and β cytoplasmic domains that also result in integrin activation include the disruption of a β-turn in the αIIb cytoplasmic domain by the substitution of alanines for 2 consecutive prolines (6Leisner T.M. Wencel-Drake J.D. Wang W. Lam S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12945-12949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) and the complete truncation of the β3 cytoplasmic domain or deletion of 7 membrane-proximal amino acids, which support the concept of membrane-proximal amino acids that are required to maintain the integrin in a default low affinity state (7Hughes P.E.

Furthermore, multiple proteins have been identified that bind to integrin cytoplasmic domains, the binding of which may serve to ultimately regulate integrin function. Proteins reported to bind to the β3 cytoplasmic domain include talin (8Knezevic I. Leisner T.M. Lam S.C. J. Biol.

J. 1999; 342: 729-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), have been described as binding to the cytoplasmic domain of αIIb. CIB (also CIB1, SIP2–28) is a 22-kDa protein that is present in platelets but also widely distributed (14Shock D.D. Naik U.P. Brittain J.E. Alahari S.K. Sondek J. Parise L.V. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 729-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). CIB binding to the αIIb cytoplasmic domain has been detected in multiple assays, including the yeast two-hybrid system (13Naik U.P.

Chem. 2002; 277: 1919-1923Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). One study has suggested that CIB binds preferentially to the activated conformation of αIIbβ3, implicating a role for CIB in outside-in signaling (15Vallar L. Melchior C. Plancon S. Drobecq H. Lippens G. Regnault V. Kieffer N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17257-17266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). In another study it was reported that CIB binds to Rac3 and that coexpression of active Rac3 and CIB in Chinese hamster ovary cells also expressing αIIbβ3results in enhanced αIIbβ3-mediated cell adhesion and spreading on fibrinogen (17Haataja L. Kaartinen V. Groffen J. Heisterkamp N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8321-8328Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Finally, a separate study recently implicated CIB in inside-out integrin activation in platelets (16Tsuboi S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1919-1923Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). CIB contains at least two functional C-terminal EF-hand domains, as well as two N-terminal EF-hand-like sequences also likely to be functional. CIB is homologous to other EF-hand-containing proteins such as the regulatory molecules, calcineurin B (CnB, 58% homology) and calmodulin (CaM, 56% homology) (13Naik U.P. Patel P.M. Parise L.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4651-4654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Members of the EF-hand superfamily of proteins undergo conformational changes upon Ca2+ binding to the helix-loop-helix structures that regulate interaction with target proteins (18Yap K.L. Ames J.B. Swindells M.B. Ikura M. Proteins. 1999; 37: 499-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Thus, it is not unexpected that CIB binds in a calcium-dependent manner to the αIIb cytoplasmic tail, as we previously demonstrated by ITC (14Shock D.D. Naik U.P. Brittain J.E. Alahari S.K. Sondek J. Parise L.V. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 729-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Like other close relatives in the EF-hand superfamily, CIB contains an N-terminal myristoyl group (19Stabler S.M. Ostrowski L.L. Janicki S.M. Monteiro M.J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 1277-1292Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), which is predicted to promote an association of CIB with the cell membrane and which points to CIB as a member of the Ca2+-myristoyl switches, a newly recognized family of proteins that regulate effector protein function at the membrane in a calcium-dependent manner (20Meyer T. York J.D. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: E93-E95Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Here we identify a limited region of the αIIb cytoplasmic domain, including a portion of the predicted membrane-spanning region, and critical hydrophobic residues therein that mediate CIB binding. In addition, we find that CIB is detected exclusively in membrane-containing fractions of N2-cavitated platelets, consistent with a potential in vivo interaction of CIB with the membrane-proximal region of αIIb. Furthermore, we identify a hydrophobic pocket within the C-terminal EF-hand/Ca2+-binding motifs of CIB that appears necessary for binding to the αIIb integrin. The identity of these regions suggests a largely hydrophobic interaction between αIIb and CIB and will facilitate the future development of molecular tools to further understand the structure-function relationship of CIB to αIIbβ3 signaling in platelets. N-terminally acetylated peptides corresponding to the C-terminal portion of the αIIbintegrin (LVLAMWKVGFFKRNRPPLEEDDEEGQ) were synthesized and purified using high performance liquid chromatography by the Protein Chemistry Laboratory of the University of North Carolina (Chapel Hill, NC). For ITF binding studies, recombinant CIB was expressed and purified as previously described (14Shock D.D. Naik U.P. Brittain J.E. Alahari S.K. Sondek J. Parise L.V. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 729-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Briefly, human CIB was expressed in Escherichia colias a fusion protein with glutathione S-transferase in pGEX-2T (APBiotech). Cells were lysed in buffer A (phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.5, containing 5 mm dithiothreitol, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) by passage through a French press (SLM Instruments, Urbana, IL). Cell lysate was clarified by centrifugation, loaded onto a glutathione-Sepharose 4B column (APBiotech), and eluted in buffer containing 10 mm reduced glutathione. The eluate was incubated with bovine α-thrombin (APBiotech) at 10 units/mg of protein, for 2–4 h at ambient temperature. CIB was further purified by gel exclusion using a HiPrep 16/60 S-200 column (Amersham Biosciences) followed by passage over a glutathione-Sepharose 4B (AmershamBiosciences) column to remove residual glutathioneS-transferase. A final purification of recombinant CIB was performed over a Resource Q column (Amersham Biosciences) eluted in a linear gradient of 0–500 mm NaCl. Fractions containing pure CIB were concentrated by ultrafiltration and stored at −80 °C. CIB purity was determined to be >99% on Coomassie Brilliant Blue-stained polyacrylamide gels. For CIB used in circular dichroism (CD) studies, wild type and mutant CIB constructs were expressed in BL21 cells using the pPROEX HTa vector (Invitrogen). For protein extraction, induced cells were resuspended in lysis buffer (20 mm NaPO4, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, 1:200 protease inhibitor mixture (Calbiochem), 0.1 mphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and lysed in a French press as above. For protein purification, the samples were separated on nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose columns (Talon resin, CLONTECH) and His-tagged labeled proteins were eluted with 250 mm imidazole. The purified proteins were stored at −80 °C in 10% glycerol. ITF was measured using a PerkinElmer Life Sciences LS-50B luminescent spectrophotometer. The fluorescent spectra of αIIb cytoplasmic domain peptides in ITF buffer (1–10 μm in 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 137 mm NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2) were measured at 20 °C. The excitation wavelength was set at 295 nm with a slit width of 10 nm, and emission was measured from 310 to 420 nm. Trp988 emission was maximal at ∼350 nm; in the presence of saturating concentrations of CIB, the ITF of αIIbincreased ∼75% at λmax. Saturation binding isotherms were generated by sequential additions of 5-μl aliquots of 0.5 mm CIB to 2 ml of ITF buffer containing 10 μmαIIb peptide and plotting the change in fluorescence (ΔF) against the molar ratio of CIB to αIIb. The stoichiometry of binding was determined from the initial slope of the percentage of saturation of ΔF plotted against the concentration of CIB, whereas a dissociation constant (K d) was calculated by extrapolating the amount of free CIB from the percentage of saturation of ΔF. Washed platelets were prepared as described previously (14Shock D.D. Naik U.P. Brittain J.E. Alahari S.K. Sondek J. Parise L.V. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 729-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Platelets were centrifuged at 750 × gand resuspended in cavitation buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 1 mm MgCl2, 500 μmCaCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 4 °C) to a concentration of ∼2 × 109 platelets/ml. Suspended platelets were disrupted by nitrogen cavitation using a cell disruption bomb (Parr, Molina, IL) at 1500 p.s.i., three times for 20 min. Cavitated platelets were collected and centrifuged at 100,000 ×g for 1 h at 4 °C. Supernatants were collected as the cytosolic fraction. Pellets were resuspended with cavitation buffer, layered over 30% sucrose, and centrifuged at 100,000 ×g for 1 h at 4 °C. The interphase of proteins was recovered as the purified membrane fraction. Cytosol and membrane fractions were solubilized in sample buffer containing 2% SDS and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. CIB was also immunoprecipitated from membrane and cytosol fractions, first by preclearing with control IgG and GammaBind G (Amersham Biosciences), followed by immunoprecipitation with 10 μg/ml CIB-specific mAb, UN2, or isotype-matched control IgG1. Samples were separated on 4–12% Novex pre-cast gels, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride, and visualized by ECL (APBiotech). A homology-based model of calcium-occupied CIB was generated with Modeler from Insight II (Molecular Simulations, San Diego, CA) using structures of other calcium-binding proteins homologous to CIB. Calcineurin B (subunit B of Protein Data Bank (PDB) identification code 1TCO) (21Griffith J.P. Kim J.L. Kim E.E. Sintchak M.D. Thomson J.A. Fitzgibbon M.J. Fleming M.A. Caron P.R. Hsiao K. Navia M.A. Cell. 1995; 82: 507-522Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (774) Google Scholar) and recoverin ((PDB identification code 1JSA) (22Ames J.B. Ishima R. Tanaka T. Gordon J.I. Stryer L. Ikura M. Nature. 1997; 389: 198-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar) were identified as templates for the CIB sequence using the Find_Structures option from the Profiles-3D application in Insight II. The CIB sequence was aligned to the calcium-binding proteins using the Align2D option from Modeler, and the alignment was compared with results from other alignment programs. Models of CIB were built using Modeler from the Homology module in Insight II using both templates as reference structures. To construct an 8-amino acid insert in the N terminus and a 5-amino acid insert in the C terminus, multiple loops were generated for the model. All homology models constructed were evaluated using the Profiles-3D Verify function. The homology model identified as being most compatible with the CIB sequence was used for further analysis. CIB was previously identified in a yeast two-hybrid screen as an interacting protein with the αIIb integrin cytoplasmic tail (13Naik U.P. Patel P.M. Parise L.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4651-4654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene) of CIB in pGAD10 was used to generate 14 single, double, and triple alanine substitutions in the CIB sequence. The CIB constructs were transformed into yeast strain Y187 and mated with Y190 cells containing the αIIb cytoplasmic tail in the pGBT9 vector (CLONTECH). For each mutant, three colonies were chosen, grown in selection media (Leu−,Trp− SD media), and assayed for β-galactosidase activity withO-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (protocol PT3024-1, CLONTECH). Expression of the CIB- and αIIb-GAL4 fusion proteins was confirmed by immunoblotting yeast lysates with monoclonal antibodies against the activation domain or the DNA-binding domain of GAL4 (CLONTECH). The secondary structure of recombinantly expressed wild type and mutant CIB were verified by CD analysis, using a Pistar-180 CD Spectrometer (Applied Photophysics, Leatherhead, UK). Proteins were first dialyzed into a buffer containing 10 mmK2HPO4, 10 mmKH2PO4, pH 6.8, and 250 μmCaCl2, and protein concentrations were determined via BCA protein assay (Pierce). The CD spectra were read from 190 to 260 nm at 20 °C. Secondary structure was predicted from the CD spectrum using the program CDsstr (23Sreerama N. Woody R.W. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 287: 252-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (2538) Google Scholar). We previously reported that CIB bound to the cytoplasmic tail of the αIIb integrin as detected by yeast two-hybrid screening (13Naik U.P. Patel P.M. Parise L.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4651-4654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar) and by ITC (14Shock D.D. Naik U.P. Brittain J.E. Alahari S.K. Sondek J. Parise L.V. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 729-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). To identify the binding domain for CIB within the integrin tail, we measured CIB binding to various αIIb integrin peptides via ITF. Because the 191-amino acid sequence of CIB does not contain any tryptophan residues, whereas the integrin cytoplasmic tail contains Trp988, CIB binding could be characterized by changes in the ITF of αIIb upon titration with CIB. The emission spectrum of the full-length, wild type αIIb cytoplasmic tail exhibited a λmax at ∼ 350 nm (Fig.1 A). Saturating concentrations of CIB resulted in an ∼75% increase in fluorescence intensity at λmax. CIB addition also resulted in a very slight blue-shift (<2 nm) of the tryptophan emission. A saturation binding isotherm representing the interaction of CIB with the wild type αIIb cytoplasmic tail, as detected by ITF (Fig. 1 B), indicated a 1:1 stoichiometry of binding and a dissociation constant (K d) of 0.3 μm, similar to values previously obtained by ITC (14Shock D.D. Naik U.P. Brittain J.E. Alahari S.K. Sondek J. Parise L.V. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 729-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Because the membrane-proximal region of αIIb is hydrophobic and determined to be α-helical (24Vinogradova O. Haas T. Plow E.F. Qin J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1450-1455Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) like other targets for EF-hand-containing proteins, such as the α-helical region of calcineurin A (CnA) that binds to CnB, we predicted that this region of αIIb might be critical for binding to CIB. To test this hypothesis, a series of truncated αIIb peptides were examined by ITF for their ability to bind CIB. Peptides lacking the last 8 (Leu983–Leu1000) or 11 (Leu983–Arg997) C-terminal amino acids retained the CIB-induced change in fluorescence (Fig.2 A), indicating an interaction with CIB and suggesting that CIB binding activity resides within in the N-terminal, membrane-proximal portion of the αIIb tail. The 11-amino acid deletion peptide (Leu983–Arg997) retained aK d for CIB similar to the full-length peptide (determined by titration as in Fig. 1 B; data not shown). To further confirm this observation, we asked whether a peptide containing only the charged C-terminal amino acids of αIIb(Ac-LEEDDEEG) had any detectable CIB binding activity. Because this peptide lacked a tryptophan necessary for ITF, we tested its ability in a competition assay to inhibit the CIB-induced ΔF of the full-length αIIb cytoplasmic domain peptide. However, the C-terminal peptide failed to attenuate the CIB-induced ΔF(data not shown.) These data further support the conclusion that the membrane-proximal, N-terminal portion of the αIIbcytoplasmic tail contains the binding site for CIB. The importance of specific hydrophobic residues within the CIB-binding region of αIIb was probed by alanine substitution. Substitution of alanine for Leu983, Phe992, or Phe993 resulted in a complete loss of the CIB-induced ΔF, implicating these residues as essential for CIB binding (Fig. 2 B). Additionally, a truncated Trp988 →Tyr peptide (Ac-LVLAMYKVGFFKRNR) was unable to attenuate the CIB-induced ΔF of the truncated αIIb peptide (Leu983–Arg997), suggesting that Trp988 is critical for CIB binding to the αIIb integrin (Fig. 2 C). A minimal CIB binding sequence in αIIb, extending from residue Leu983 to Arg997, is summarized in Fig.2 D. Of note, this predicted CIB-binding region extends by ∼6 amino acids (Leu983–Trp988) to within the putative membrane-spanning region of αIIb (3Simon K.O. Burridge K. Cheresh D.A. Mecham R.P. Integrins: Molecular and Biological Responses to the Extracellular Matrix. Academic Press, Orlando1994: 49-78Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Because the CIB binding site appears to extend into the predicted membrane-spanning region of αIIb, we asked whether CIB distributes with the membrane fraction derived from nitrogen-cavitated platelets. We found that CIB fractionates exclusively with platelet membranes, as detected by immunoblotting both membrane and cytosolic fractions with the CIB-specific mAb, UN2 (Fig. 3). To further confirm a lack of CIB in the cytosolic fraction, CIB in each fraction was concentrated by immunoprecipitation, followed by immunoblotting, but, again, no CIB was detected in the cytosolic fraction (Fig. 3). CIB therefore appears to be membrane-associated in platelets, increasing the likelihood of a potential in vivointeraction between CIB and the αIIb integrin subunit. In predicting the sites within CIB that bind to αIIb, we first noted that the primary sequence of CIB best fit the structures of CnB (21Griffith J.P. Kim J.L. Kim E.E. Sintchak M.D. Thomson J.A. Fitzgibbon M.J. Fleming M.A. Caron P.R. Hsiao K. Navia M.A. Cell. 1995; 82: 507-522Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (774) Google Scholar) and recoverin (22Ames J.B. Ishima R. Tanaka T. Gordon J.I. Stryer L. Ikura M. Nature. 1997; 389: 198-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). Furthermore, many EF-hand domains bind amphipathic α-helical regions through complementary hydrophobic surfaces (25Ikura M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 14-17Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar), and we noticed a striking similarity in the amphipathic character of the αIIb cytoplasmic tail that forms an α-helix (24Vinogradova O. Haas T. Plow E.F. Qin J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1450-1455Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), and the C-terminal portion of CnA that binds CnB. Similarly, many of the hydrophobic residues within the C-terminal EF-hand domains of CnB implicated in binding CnA are highly conserved in CIB (13Naik U.P. Patel P.M. Parise L.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4651-4654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar), suggesting a common mode of complex formation. Therefore, the structure of CnB bound to CnA (Fig. 4 A) together with a multiple sequence alignment of proteins containing EF-hand domains (only CIB and CnB are shown in Fig. 4 B) were used to identify highly conserved residues within CIB most likely necessary for productive interaction with αIIb. These residues were mutated and the functional consequences assessed to identify residues potentially critical for CIB binding to αIIb. CIB mutants were generated with alanine substitutions by site-directed mutagenesis. Although most mutations were of hydrophobic residues based on the model of CIB as compared with CnA and CnB (Fig. 4, A andB), we also targeted two sequential arginines (residues 32 and 33) in the N terminus of CIB that had been previously implicated as part of a potential site of integrin binding (26Hwang P.M. Vogel H.J. J. Mol. Recognit. 2000; 13: 83-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The ability of the CIB mutants to interact with the αIIb cytoplasmic tail was analyzed in the yeast two-hybrid system (Fig. 4 C). As previously reported (13Naik U.P. Patel P.M. Parise L.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4651-4654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar), wild type CIB interacted positively with the αIIb cytoplasmic tail, compared to an empty vector control. Although alanine substitutions for the sequential arginines (Arg32 → Ala/Arg33 → Ala) in the N terminus of CIB had no effect on CIB binding to the αIIb tail, 11 of 12 mutations to Ala and 1 to Thr of hydrophobic residues in the C-terminal EF-hands of CIB resulted in a loss of interaction. The apparent loss of interaction could not be accounted for by a loss of mutant CIB expression, as Western blotting of yeast extracts demonstrated equal expression of the wild type and mutant CIB/Gal4 activation domain fusion proteins (data not shown). Moreover, the inability of most of the CIB mutants to interact with αIIb could not be accounted for by a global loss of secondary structure, as verified by CD spectroscopy (Fig.4 D). The CD spectrum of CIB predicts a secondary structure that is composed of 46% α-helix and 12% β-sheet, similar to predictions derived from the homology model of CIB (TableI). As compared with wild type CIB, most of the mutants retained substantially similar secondary structure predictions of a highly α-helical protein (Fig. 4 D). The only mutants where overall secondary structure appears to be slightly affected include Phe115 → Ala, Phe173 → Ala, and the multiple mutation of Leu131-Val-Asn-Cys-Leu135 to Ala-Ala-Asn-Cys-Ala. Based on this analysis, the loss of CIB binding activity in most mutants is unlikely to be explained by a global change in conformation.Table ISecondary structure predictions of CIB from homology model versus circular dichroism analysisα-Helixβ-SheetTurnRandom coil%%%%Homology model523837Circular dichroism1-aSecondary structure values were computed with the CDsstr program from three CD spectra of wild-type CIB from 260 to 190 nm.46 ± 0.412 ± 0.420 ± 0.419 ± 2.11-a Secondary structure values were computed with the CDsstr program from three CD spectra of wild-type CIB from 260 to 190 nm. Open table in a new tab To visualize the location of these critical amino acids within a three-dimensional structure, we built a homology model of CIB from the published structures of CnB (PDB identification code 1TCO) (21Griffith J.P.

Ikura M. Nature. 1997; 389: 198-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). Although CIB is also reasonably homologous to CaM, the CIB sequence fit structures of CaM poorly (PDB identification code 1CKK) (27Osawa M. Tokumitsu H. Swindells M.B. Kurihara H. Orita M. Shibanuma T. Furuya T. Ikura M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 819-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 28Ikura M. Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. Zhu G. Klee C.B. Bax A. Science. 1992; 256: 632-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (1182) Google Scholar). The final homology model of CIB (Fig. 4 E) contained 52% α-helix, consistent with the helical content of full-length CIB as determined by CD spectra (Table I). The residues in CIB that are essential for αIIb binding and that do not compromise the overall protein fold upon substitution are highlighted in red in the homology model of CIB (Fig.4 E). We previously identified CIB in the yeast two-hybrid system as a binding partner for the cytoplasmic tail of the αIIb integrin subunit (13Naik U.P. Patel P.M. Parise L.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4651-4654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar) and further demonstrated that this binding occurs in a Ca2+-dependent manner (14Shock D.D. Naik U.P. Brittain J.E. Alahari S.K. Sondek J. Parise L.V. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 729-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Moreover, recent studies have provided evidence that CIB, in conjunction with Rac3, activates αIIbβ3-mediated adhesion and spreading in cultured cells (17Haataja L. Kaartinen V. Groffen J. Heisterkamp N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8321-8328Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) and that CIB binding to αIIbβ3 may activate the soluble fibrinogen-binding function of purified and platelet-associated αIIbβ3 (16Tsuboi S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1919-1923Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Because of the potential for CIB to regulate αIIbβ3 integrin function in platelets, it was of interest to identify the CIB-binding region within the αIIb cytoplasmic domain and the integrin-binding region within CIB. We localized the CIB binding site on αIIb to within a 15-amino acid stretch that includes residues within the membrane-proximal cytoplasmic region as well as several residues within the predicted membrane-spanning region of αIIb. Furthermore, four hydrophobic amino acids within this 15-amino acid sequence were shown to be critical for high affinity αIIb peptide binding to CIB. Finally, we have identified an apparent hydrophobic binding pocket within CIB for the αIIb cytoplasmic domain. CIB binding to αIIb cytoplasmic tail peptides was detected by an increase in ITF of these peptides. Intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence, in the presence of calcium, indicated a 1:1 stoichiometry and a K d of 0.3 μm for recombinant CIB binding to the αIIb cytoplasmic tail peptides. These values are similar to those previously reported with ITC (1:1 stoichiometry, K d 0.7 μm (Ref. 14Shock D.D. Naik U.P. Brittain J.E. Alahari S.K. Sondek J. Parise L.V. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 729-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar)), further verifying the usefulness of ITF for this study. In addition, ITF has the advantage over ITC of requiring much less protein for detection of binding interactions. The increase in αIIbfluorescence is presumably because of a decrease in solvent quenching of the tryptophan emission upon formation of a CIB-αIIbcomplex (29Guilbault G.G. Practical Fluorescence: Theory, Methods and Techniques. Marcel Dekker, New York1973Google Scholar). As measured by ITF, CIB binds with equal affinity to both the full-length αIIb peptide (Leu983–Gln1008) corresponding to the cytoplasmic tail plus 6 amino acids within the putative membrane-spanning region, as to a truncated peptide (Leu983–Arg997) lacking the last 11 amino acids. It is noteworthy that, although CIB binds to αIIbin a membrane-proximal region that is highly conserved among α subunits (reviewed in Ref. 3Simon K.O. Burridge K. Cheresh D.A. Mecham R.P. Integrins: Molecular and Biological Responses to the Extracellular Matrix. Academic Press, Orlando1994: 49-78Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar), it binds exclusively to the integrin αIIb subunit. In fact, the integrin subunit most homologous to αIIb in this region is αv, yet we previously observed with multiple attempts in the yeast two-hybrid system that CIB does not bind to the αvcytoplasmic domain (13Naik U.P. Patel P.M. Parise L.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4651-4654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). 2W. T. Barry, C. Boudignon-Proudhon, and L. V. Parise, unpublished observations. This can most easily be explained by a tyrosine in αv in a position corresponding to a critical tryptophan residue (Trp988) in αIIb. Indeed, the single conservative substitution of a tyrosine for tryptophan in this position of αIIb causes an apparent loss of CIB binding activity (Fig. 2 C). The substitution of alanine for other hydrophobic residues in the αIIb cytoplasmic tail (i.e.Leu983, Phe992, and Phe993) also disrupted binding to CIB. These results further substantiate the hypothesis that αIIb and CIB bind primarily through hydrophobic interactions. Such a set of interactions is analogous to those seen in complexes formed with other calcium binding proteins such as CnB (21Griffith J.P. Kim J.L. Kim E.E. Sintchak M.D. Thomson J.A. Fitzgibbon M.J. Fleming M.A. Caron P.R. Hsiao K. Navia M.A. Cell. 1995; 82: 507-522Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (774) Google Scholar). Two of the critical residues in αIIb, Leu983 and Trp988, are considered to be within the transmembrane domain of the integrin (3Simon K.O. Burridge K. Cheresh D.A. Mecham R.P. Integrins: Molecular and Biological Responses to the Extracellular Matrix. Academic Press, Orlando1994: 49-78Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar), indicating that CIB should localize to the platelet membrane at least part of the time to interact physiologically with αIIb. Although CIB contains an N-terminal myristoylation site and was recently shown to be myristoylated in HeLa cells (19Stabler S.M. Ostrowski L.L. Janicki S.M. Monteiro M.J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 1277-1292Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), it was unknown whether CIB associates with membranes in platelets. In nitrogen-cavitated platelets, we observed that CIB is retained exclusively with the membrane fraction, consistent with the potential for an in vivo interaction of CIB with αIIbthat involves several amino acids of αIIb potentially inserted into the plasma membrane. In addition, CIB is homologous to calcium-myristoyl switch proteins such as recoverin (22Ames J.B. Ishima R. Tanaka T. Gordon J.I. Stryer L. Ikura M. Nature. 1997; 389: 198-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). However, whether CIB actually functions in the same manner to extrude its myristoyl group with increasing Ca2+ concentrations and translocate to membranes is currently unknown. In any case, because CIB binds to these intramembraneous amino acids, an interesting hypothesis is suggested for integrin activation, whereby the application of an intramembraneous force to the αIIb subunit alters the αIIbβ3 complex in a manner similar to the integrin-hinge hypothesis proposed by Hughes et al.(5Hughes P.E. Diaz-Gonzalez F. Leong L. Wu C. McDonald J.A. Shattil S.J. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6571-6574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). The homology between CIB and the EF-hand-containing proteins, calcineurin B (58%) and calmodulin (56%), suggested that CIB might bind to the α-helical region of the αIIb cytoplasmic domain by a mechanism similar to that used by other EF-hand-containing proteins. Calcium binding to a number of other EF-hand-containing proteins is known to substantially alter the tertiary structure of these proteins, exposing the binding sites for effector molecules (18Yap K.L. Ames J.B. Swindells M.B. Ikura M. Proteins. 1999; 37: 499-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar), and we previously demonstrated that CIB binding to αIIbwas Ca2+-dependent (14Shock D.D. Naik U.P. Brittain J.E. Alahari S.K. Sondek J. Parise L.V. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 729-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Building a homology model of CIB based upon the published structures of calcium-occupied CnB and recoverin allowed us to identify a hydrophobic region in CIB that is potentially exposed on the surface of the molecule. This C-terminal hydrophobic pocket was highly conserved between CnB and CIB, and is also part of the binding domain for the catalytic subunit of calcineurin, CnA. Furthermore, the CnB binding site on CnA consists of a long, amphipathic α-helix, similar to the binding site identified on αIIb (21Griffith J.P. Kim J.L. Kim E.E. Sintchak M.D. Thomson J.A. Fitzgibbon M.J. Fleming M.A. Caron P.R. Hsiao K. Navia M.A. Cell. 1995; 82: 507-522Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (774) Google Scholar). This evidence led us to target the hydrophobic pocket in CIB as a potential integrin-binding site. In our mutational analysis, we also targeted two arginine residues in the N terminus previously implicated as a potential site of integrin interaction (26Hwang P.M. Vogel H.J. J. Mol. Recognit. 2000; 13: 83-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Circular dichroism demonstrated the percent α-helical, β-sheet, and random coil content of wild type CIB and indicated that most of the CIB mutants retain a nearly identical structure, with only three of the mutant CIB molecules deviating perceptibly in structural composition. As demonstrated in the yeast two-hybrid analysis, αIIb binding to CIB is dependent upon hydrophobic residues in the C terminus of CIB, and not the charged residues mutated in the N terminus. Therefore, CIB binds to the membrane-proximal region of the αIIb cytoplasmic tail through a hydrophobic interaction that is regulated by calcium occupancy of the EF-hands in CIB. Although a very recent study suggested that the extreme C terminus of CIB contains an αIIb binding site, the ability of this region to interact directly with αIIb was not demonstrated (16Tsuboi S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1919-1923Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Moreover, our mutations would suggest that the CIB binding site extends beyond and/or outside of this region to include the hydrophobic binding pocket visualized in Fig. 4 E. In conclusion, we have narrowed down the CIB binding site in αIIb to an N-terminal region of the cytoplasmic domain that partially extends into the putative membrane spanning region. In addition, we have identified specific residues within a hydrophobic pocket in CIB that appear to mediate integrin binding. These results demonstrate interacting regions of CIB and αIIb and offer a potential mechanism of αIIbβ3 regulation by CIB. This knowledge will be applicable to future structure/function studies of CIB both in vitro and in vivo.

https://openalex.org/W2010749889,"Mitochondrial DNA synthesis is a thermosensitive process in the yeast <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>. We found that restoration of mtDNA synthesis following heat treatment of cells is dependent on reactivation of the mtDNA polymerase Mip1p through the action of a mitochondrial bichaperone system consisting of the Hsp70 system and the Hsp78 oligomeric protein. mtDNA synthesis was inefficiently restored after heat shock in yeast lacking either functional component of the bichaperone system. Furthermore, the activity of purified Mip1p was also thermosensitive; however, the purified components of the mitochondrial bichaperone system (Ssc1p, Mdj1p, Mge1p, and Hsp78p) were able to protect its activity under moderate heat shock conditions as well as to reactivate thermally inactivated Mip1p. Interestingly, the reactivation of endogenous Mip1p contributed more significantly to the restoration of mtDNA synthesis than did import of newly synthesized Mip1p from the cytosol. These observations suggest an important link between function of mitochondrial chaperones and the propagation of mitochondrial genomes under ever-changing environmental conditions."

Studies in vitro on members of this family have shown two distinctive properties: an ability to synthesize past template lesions that would cause stalling of the “classical” replicative and repair polymerases, and a remarkably low fidelity when copying an undamaged DNA template (see e.g. Refs. 4Matsuda T. Bebenek K. Masutani C. Hanaoka F. Kunkel T.A. Nature. 2000; 404: 1011-1013Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar, 5Tang M. Pham P. Shen X. Taylor J.S. O'Donnell M. Woodgate R. Goodman M.F.

Nature. 2000; 406: 1015-1019Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar). It is thought that these DNA polymerases function in vivo to allow replication forks to bypass blocking lesions, and that each bypass polymerase may have specificity for one or a subset of lesions. Low fidelity may be merely a consequence of the active site features that allow lesion bypass, or it may be an additional survival strategy, allowing increased mutation rate as a response to environmental stress (7McKenzie G.J. Rosenberg S.M. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2001; 4: 586-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar).At a molecular level, an obvious question is what modifications to the classical polymerase active site are responsible for the novel properties of the lesion bypass polymerases. Several recently published crystallographic studies have begun to address these issues (8Zhou B.-L. Pata J.D. Steitz T.A. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 427-437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 9Trincao J. Johnson R.E. Escalante C.R. Prakash S. Prakash L. Aggarwal A.K. Mol.

Biol. 2001; 8: 984-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). They show a polymerase domain that is clearly related to the classical polymerases, in that it can be described as having the familiar right-handed arrangement of palm, fingers, and thumb subdomains (12Joyce C.M. Steitz T.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 777-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar). Moreover, the palm subdomain shows the classical “polymerase fold,” the well-conserved secondary structure elements that provide the scaffold for the polymerase active site. Both homology-modeled and directly observed ternary complexes provide plausible explanations for the characteristic biochemical properties of the bypass polymerases. First, the bypass polymerases appear to make fewer contacts with their substrates when compared with other DNA polymerase ternary complex structures (reviewed in Ref. 13Doublié S. Sawaya M.R. Ellenberger T. Structure. 1999; 7: R31-R35Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Second, the relative positions of the fingers and palm subdomains suggest that the bypass polymerases may undergo very little shift in conformation in the transition from apo-enzyme to ternary complex. By contrast, other DNA polymerases show a substantial movement of the fingers subdomain on formation of the ternary complex (14Doublié S. Tabor S. Long A. Richardson C.C. Ellenberger T.

The Dbh (DinBhomolog) and Dpo4 proteins are both from the DinB branch of the bypass polymerase family. Both have substantial sequence homology to the Escherichia coliDinB protein (18Kulaeva O.I.

We have generated a mutational spectrum of the errors produced by this enzyme to determine whether its resemblance to E. coli DinB encompasses similar enzymatic behavior. We have also carried out kinetic studies that explain the prevalence of some types of errors made by this polymerase. In the past few years it has become apparent that the DNA repair proteins of the UmuC/DinB/Rev1/Rad30 family are in fact DNA polymerases, now called the Y family (1Goodman M.F. Tippin B. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2000; 10: 162-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 2Friedberg E.C. Feaver W.J. Gerlach V.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Prakash S. Todo T. Walker G.C. Wang Z. Woodgate R. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 7-8Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar). Studies in vitro on members of this family have shown two distinctive properties: an ability to synthesize past template lesions that would cause stalling of the “classical” replicative and repair polymerases, and a remarkably low fidelity when copying an undamaged DNA template (see e.g. Refs. 4Matsuda T. Bebenek K. Masutani C. Hanaoka F. Kunkel T.A. Nature. 2000; 404: 1011-1013Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar, 5Tang M. Pham P. Shen X. Taylor J.S. O'Donnell M. Woodgate R. Goodman M.F.

Nature. 2000; 406: 1015-1019Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar). It is thought that these DNA polymerases function in vivo to allow replication forks to bypass blocking lesions, and that each bypass polymerase may have specificity for one or a subset of lesions. Low fidelity may be merely a consequence of the active site features that allow lesion bypass, or it may be an additional survival strategy, allowing increased mutation rate as a response to environmental stress (7McKenzie G.J. Rosenberg S.M. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2001; 4: 586-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). At a molecular level, an obvious question is what modifications to the classical polymerase active site are responsible for the novel properties of the lesion bypass polymerases. Several recently published crystallographic studies have begun to address these issues (8Zhou B.-L. Pata J.D. Steitz T.A. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 427-437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 9Trincao J. Johnson R.E. Escalante C.R. Prakash S. Prakash L. Aggarwal A.K. Mol.

Biol. 2001; 8: 984-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). They show a polymerase domain that is clearly related to the classical polymerases, in that it can be described as having the familiar right-handed arrangement of palm, fingers, and thumb subdomains (12Joyce C.M. Steitz T.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 777-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar). Moreover, the palm subdomain shows the classical “polymerase fold,” the well-conserved secondary structure elements that provide the scaffold for the polymerase active site. Both homology-modeled and directly observed ternary complexes provide plausible explanations for the characteristic biochemical properties of the bypass polymerases. First, the bypass polymerases appear to make fewer contacts with their substrates when compared with other DNA polymerase ternary complex structures (reviewed in Ref. 13Doublié S. Sawaya M.R. Ellenberger T. Structure. 1999; 7: R31-R35Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Second, the relative positions of the fingers and palm subdomains suggest that the bypass polymerases may undergo very little shift in conformation in the transition from apo-enzyme to ternary complex. By contrast, other DNA polymerases show a substantial movement of the fingers subdomain on formation of the ternary complex (14Doublié S. Tabor S. Long A. Richardson C.C. Ellenberger T. Nature. 1998; 391: 251-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (1099) Google Scholar, 15Li Y. Korolev S. Waksman G. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7514-7525Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar, 16Huang H. Chopra R.

Pressure-induced aggregation was nucleation-dependent and first-order in protein concentration and could be seeded. The insoluble aggregates were mixtures of amyloid fibrils and amorphous aggregates. Activation volumes, activation surface areas, and activation waters of hydration were larger for aggregate growth than for prenucleation assembly or nucleation, although activation free energies were similar for the three processes. Activation free energies for each of the transition states were dominated by the unfavorable free energy of solvation of newly exposed surfaces. Equilibrium dissociation and unfolding of the dimer showed a much larger volume change than those required to form the transition states for the three processes. Thus, the transition states for these steps are similar to the native state, and their formation requires only small structural perturbations. Finally, the presence of Congo red during amyloid fibril formation shortened lag times and caused pressure insensitivity of nucleation, suggesting that this compound or its analogs may not be effective as inhibitors of amyloidosis.

In vitro studies have documented that many amyloidogenic proteins assemble irreversibly into fibrils via a nucleation-dependent pathway (3Jarrett J.T. Berger E.P. Lansbury P.T., Jr. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 4693-4697Crossref PubMed Scopus (1729) Google Scholar, 4Harper J.D. Lansbury P.T., Jr. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 385-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (1402) Google Scholar). Protein aggregation occurs through specific intermediates, which are structurally perturbed relative to the native conformation (1Wetzel R. Cell. 1996; 86: 699-702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 5Speed M.A. Wang D.I. King J. Nat.

Numerous studies have focused on spectroscopic characterization of the aggregation-competent conformation under non-native conditions where it is highly populated. However, insight into the mechanisms of aggregation requires quantitative assessment of the transition state between the native protein and the aggregation-competent, structurally perturbed intermediate. Furthermore, strategies to inhibit aggregate formation should focus on increasing the energetic barriers to transition state formation. In this study, we chose the immunoglobulin light chain (LC)1 as a model amyloidogenic protein. LCs deposit pathologically in vivo as amyloid fibrils (light chain-associated amyloidosis) and amorphous granular aggregates (light chain deposition diseases) (2Wetzel R. Adv. Protein Chem. 1997; 50: 183-242Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We employed hydrostatic pressure, a co-solute (sucrose), and temperature to quantify the magnitude of the structural change (activation volume and specific surface area of activation) and energetics needed to form the transition states for prenucleation assembly, nucleation, and growth of LC aggregates and amyloid fibrils. Pressure is a fundamental variable that has often been manipulated to probe the thermodynamics and kinetics of protein folding and unfolding (7Silva J.L. Weber G. Annu. Rev. Phys. Chem. 1993; 44: 89-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar, 8Gross M. Jaenicke R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 221: 617-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar, 9Mozhaev V.V. Heremans K.

Sci. 2001; 26: 612-618Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). However, the power of high-pressure studies to gain insight into transition states associated with protein aggregation has not been fully exploited; only a single study has been published, which characterized the transition state between the native and aggregation-competent forms of interferon-γ (11Webb J.N. Webb S.D. Cleland J.L. Carpenter J.F. Randolph T.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7259-7264Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Likewise, manipulation of solution thermodynamics by the addition of co-solutes such as sucrose can be used to characterize transition states associated with protein aggregation (11Webb J.N. Webb S.D. Cleland J.L. Carpenter J.F. Randolph T.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7259-7264Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar,12Kendrick B. Carpenter J.F. Cleland J.L. Randolph T.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14142-14146Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), but this method has not been applied to an amyloidogenic protein. We used in situ high-pressure UV-visible spectroscopy to investigate the kinetics of aggregation and amyloid fibril nucleation and growth as well as the thermodynamics of unfolding and dissociation. Furthermore, we followed fibril formation under pressure using in situ Congo red (CR) binding. Recombinant LC variable domain (VL) SMA was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified (>99% by SDS-PAGE) as described previously (13Kim Y.-S. Cape S.P. Chi E. Raffen R. Wilkins-Stevens P.

Recombinant SMA has the same sequence as the VL that originated from lymph node-derived amyloid fibrils of a patient with light chain-associated amyloidosis (14Wilkins-Stevens P. Raffen R. Hanson D.K. Deng Y.L. Berrios-Hammond M. Westholm F.A. Murphy C. Eulitz M. Wetzel R. Solomon A. Schiffer M. Stevens F.J. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 421-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). SMA forms both amorphous aggregates and amyloid fibrils, depending on solution conditions (15Khurana R. Gillespie J.R. Talapatra A. Minert L.J. Ionescu-Zanetti C. Millett I. Fink A.L. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 3525-3535Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Dithiothreitol (DTT) and CR were purchased from Sigma. Highly purified sucrose was from Pfanstiehl Laboratories, Inc. Other chemicals were from Sigma and were of reagent or higher grade. All experiments were carried out in 10 mm Tris-HCl and 100 mm NaCl (pH 7.4) (buffer A), which is insensitive to pH change with pressure (9Mozhaev V.V. Heremans K. Frank J. Masson P. Balny C. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1996; 24: 81-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar). UV-visible absorbance spectra were measured using a high-pressure cell with two sapphire windows in a PerkinElmer Life Sciences Lambda 35 UV-visible spectrophotometer (11Webb J.N. Webb S.D. Cleland J.L. Carpenter J.F. Randolph T.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7259-7264Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Temperature was controlled within ±0.5 °C with a circulating ethylene glycol bath (Julabo F25) connected to a heat exchanger mounted on the bottom of the cell and was monitored with a thermocouple inserted into the top of the pressure cell. 0.5 mg/ml SMA in buffer A with 2 m urea and 0.5 or 1 mg/ml SMA in buffer A were equilibrated overnight at room temperature, loaded into a 12-mm diameter × 13-mm height quartz cell, and placed in the high-pressure unit. After thermal equilibration, hydrostatic pressure was gradually increased to 330 MPa in 10- or 20-MPa increments. At each pressure, conformational transitions were monitored by recording second-derivative UV spectra from 270 to 300 nm at 0.1-nm intervals. Approximately 10 min were required to reach conformational equilibrium at each pressure. Urea-induced unfolding was also performed at atmospheric pressure for 0.5 mg/ml SMA at 32 °C after equilibration of the samples at room temperature overnight. Unfolding curves were constructed by plotting the wavelength of the intensity minimum around 284 nm of the second-derivative UV spectra, which reflects the polarity near tyrosine residues (16Ragone R. Colonna G. Balestrieri C. Servillo L. Irace G. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 1871-1875Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar), versus pressure or [urea]. All aggregation experiments were conducted in buffer A containing 10 mm DTT. Preliminary experiments indicated that the presence of DTT, which presumably reduces the intramolecular disulfide bridge between Cys-23 and Cys-88 in SMA (17Huang D.B. Chang C.H. Ainsworth C. Johnson G. Solomon A. Stevens F.J. Schiffer M. Mol. Immunol. 1997; 34: 1291-1301Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), was required to foster protein aggregation under pressure at reasonable rates (e.g. process complete within 8 h; data not shown). In pressure studies, 1 mg/ml SMA was incubated at 80, 120, 160, 200, and 240 MPa and 32 °C. Aggregation of 1 mg/ml SMA samples (200 MPa) was also measured at 30, 32, 34, 36, and 38 °C and at 32 °C in 0.125, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, and 1 m sucrose. Aggregation rates as a function of protein concentration (200 MPa and 32 °C) were determined with 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1, and 1.25 mg/ml SMA. Aggregation was monitored by optical density at 320 nm (OD320) as described for nucleation-dependent growth of Aβ peptides (3Jarrett J.T. Berger E.P. Lansbury P.T., Jr. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 4693-4697Crossref PubMed Scopus (1729) Google Scholar). Protein conformational transitions were monitored with second-derivative UV spectra. The time from application of pressure to acquisition of the first UV scan was ∼10 min. To prepare “seeds,” aggregates formed at 200 MPa and 32 °C were washed (three times) by centrifugation and resuspension with 1 volume of buffer A. The suspension was sonicated for 10 s and cooled on ice for 30 s (12 times) with output cycle 5 and 50% duty on a Branson sonifier (VWR Scientific). To prepare seeds from amyloid fibrils generated at atmospheric pressure, 1 mg/ml SMA in buffer A was agitated at 37 °C for 96 h (13Kim Y.-S. Cape S.P. Chi E. Raffen R. Wilkins-Stevens P. Stevens F.J. Manning M.C. Randolph T.W. Solomon A. Carpenter J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1626-1633Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) and sonicated as described above. To study effects of seeding on aggregation, samples containing 1 mg/ml SMA and 0.1 mg/ml seeds were incubated either at 200 MPa and 32 °C with 10 mm DTT or at atmospheric pressure and 37 °C with agitation in buffer A alone (13Kim Y.-S. Cape S.P. Chi E. Raffen R. Wilkins-Stevens P. Stevens F.J. Manning M.C. Randolph T.W. Solomon A. Carpenter J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1626-1633Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). A 300–400 μm CR stock solution was freshly prepared in water containing 10% (v/v) ethanol as described by Klunk et al. (18Klunk W.E. Jacob R.F. Mason R.P. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 309: 285-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Buffer A containing 1 mg/ml SMA with 10 mm DTT and 12 μm CR was incubated at 80, 120, 160, 200, and 240 MPa and 32 °C. As a non-aggregating control, a sample without DTT was incubated at 200 MPa and 32 °C. Spectra were collected between 350 and 700 nm every 3.2 min (18Klunk W.E. Jacob R.F. Mason R.P. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 309: 285-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). To subtract the contributions from light scattering to the raw spectrum, a series of spectra from aggregation experiments without CR were obtained, and a reference spectrum was created by interpolation to match the OD700 of the raw spectrum in the presence of CR. The interpolated spectrum was subtracted from the raw spectrum using GRAMS/32® software (Galactic Industries Corp.). The resulting difference spectrum was used to calculate a second-derivative spectrum using a 120-point Savitsky-Golay derivative function with GRAMS/32®software. CR binding was monitored by the intensity of second-derivative spectra at 542 nm. At the completion of pressure-induced aggregation, pressure was released, and the aggregates were analyzed. To determine whether they were covalently cross-linked by disulfide bonds, aggregates were washed three times with buffer A by centrifugation and resuspension to remove DTT and analyzed by reducing and nonreducing SDS-PAGE. Aggregate pellets were also resuspended in 7m guanidine HCl in buffer A, incubated for 1 h, and analyzed by size-exclusion HPLC. ThT assay for protein fibrils was performed as described (13Kim Y.-S.

FT-IR spectroscopy was used to determine the secondary structure of native SMA (20 mg/ml in buffer A), pure SMA amyloid fibrils (generated by incubation at atmospheric pressure by agitation for 96 h and concentrated 20-fold), and the insoluble aggregates formed under high pressure after washing three times with buffer A and concentrating 20-fold (13Kim Y.-S.

The linear extrapolation method was used to calculate the fraction of native protein (fN) present during pressure- and urea-induced unfolding (19Kim Y.-S. Wall J.S. Meyer J. Murphy C. Randolph T.W.

From data for urea-induced dissociation and unfolding at atmospheric pressure, the free energy of dissociation in buffer A alone, ΔGd (buffer A), was obtained by extrapolation of the plot of ΔGd versus [urea] to 0 m urea, where ΔGd = −RTln(4C0(1 −fN)2/fN), andC0 is the initial protein concentration in mg/ml, R is the gas constant, and T is temperature (7Silva J.L.

For the pressure experiments in the absence of urea, unfolding was incomplete due to experimental pressure limitations of the UV cell.fN was estimated using the post-transition region base line from the pressure-induced unfolding curve in the presence of 2 m urea in which complete unfolding occurred (11Webb J.N.

The equilibrium dissociation volume change (ΔVd) for the homodimer of SMA was obtained in the transition region of unfolding from the slope of a plot of ΔGd versus P, where P is the pressure (7Silva J.L.

For the aggregation studies, the lag time, tlag(min), for nucleation was calculated by extrapolation of the linear region of the growth phase to the base line of the lag phase (13Kim Y.-S. Cape S.P. Chi E. Raffen R. Wilkins-Stevens P. Stevens F.J. Manning M.C. Randolph T.W. Solomon A. Carpenter J.F. J. Biol.

The first-order prenucleation assembly rate constant, kprenuc(min−1), and the growth rate constant,kgrowth (min−1), were determined from the initial maximum slope of the plot of ln((OD320,f − OD320,t)/(OD320,f − OD320,0)) versus time in the prenucleation assembly and growth regions, respectively, where OD320,f is the final OD320 and OD320,t is at time = t and OD320,0 is at time = 0. For the CR binding kinetics, the intensity of second-derivative absorbance spectra at 542 nm was used instead of OD320. From the pressure-dependent aggregation kinetics, the partial molar volume changes (ΔV*) between the native state (N) and the aggregation transition state (N*) were determined for prenucleation assembly (ΔV*prenuc), nucleation (ΔV*nuc), and growth (ΔV*growth) using Equations Equation 2, Equation 3, Equation 4 (8Gross M.

The apparent activation energies (Ea) for prenucleation assembly, nucleation, and growth were determined from Arrhenius plots (23Smith J.M. Kirkpatrick S.D. Chemical Engineering Series. McGraw-Hill Inc., New York1956: 41-84Google Scholar). Activation enthalpies (ΔH*) and activation entropies (ΔS*) for each transition were calculated using the Eyring transition model (23Smith J.M. Kirkpatrick S.D. Chemical Engineering Series. McGraw-Hill Inc., New York1956: 41-84Google Scholar) and used for the calculation of activation free energies (ΔG*) using ΔG* = ΔH* − TΔS*. ΔG*, TΔS*, and ΔH* were separated into those from solvation (ΔG*solv,TΔS*solv, and ΔH*solv) and those arising from all other effects, including protein conformational changes (ΔG*conf,TΔS*conf, and ΔH*conf). ΔG*solv was estimated from a surface tension of water at 32 °C of 42.6 kJ/mol/nm2 (24Vargaftik N.B. Volkov B.N. Voljak L.D. J. Phys. Chem. Ref. Data. 1983; 12: 817-820Crossref Scopus (852) Google Scholar) multiplied by the measured Δa*for each transition state. ΔS*solv was estimated from a reported value for entropy of hydration of −4.2 J/mol/K/water molecule (25Ashbaugh H.S. Paulaitis M.E. J. Phys. Chem. 1996; 100: 1900-1913Crossref Scopus (93) Google Scholar) multiplied by the average value of changes in waters of hydration between N and N* (Δnw*), which was determined from ΔV* and Δa* for each transition state (11Webb J.N.

Errors associated with parameters obtained from linear regression are reported as 95% confidence limits on the fit. Fig.1A shows the second-derivative UV spectra of SMA as a function of pressure up to 330 MPa in 2m urea at 32 °C. At atmospheric pressure, the midpoint for urea-induced dissociation and unfolding of 0.5 mg/ml SMA was 4.4m urea, and the onset for unfolding occurred at 2.8m urea (data not shown). The pressure-induced equilibrium unfolding curve was typical of a two-state transition (Fig.1B), with clear isosbestic points in second-derivative UV spectra (Fig. 1A). In the absence of urea, unfolding was incomplete over this pressure range. Unfolding curves (37 °C) shifted to higher pressures with increases in protein concentration (Fig. 1B). A plot of ΔGd versus P for the two protein concentrations yielded a straight line (r 2 = 0.99) (Fig.1B, inset), strongly suggesting that dissociation is concomitant with protein unfolding (7Silva J.L.

From pressure-induced dissociation data, ΔVd, P12, and ΔGd (0.1 MPa) were calculated (TableI). ΔVd values were independent of protein concentration and temperature within experimental errors, with an average value of −113 ± 11 ml/mol. The partial molar surface area change for dissociation (Δad) was estimated as 9.0 nm2/molecule by Δad = −0.079 × ΔVd (11Webb J.N. Webb S.D. Cleland J.L. Carpenter J.F. Randolph T.W. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Open table in a new tab The reference state is 1 mg/ml SMA, and ± values indicate 95% confidence limits from linear regression. In the absence of DTT, insoluble aggregates of SMA (1 mg/ml) did not form under pressure (e.g. 100 MPa at 37 °C for 3 days) even in the presence of urea (0–5 m) (data not shown). Thus, all the aggregation studies under high pressure were performed in buffer A containing 10 mm DTT. Pressure-, protein concentration-, sucrose concentration-, and temperature-dependent aggregation under high pressure showed kinetics typical of nucleation-dependent growth (Fig. 2), characterized by an initial lag phase, followed by an exponential growth phase (3Jarrett J.T. Berger E.P. Lansbury P.T., Jr. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 4693-4697Crossref PubMed Scopus (1729) Google Scholar, 4Harper J.D. Lansbury P.T., Jr. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 385-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (1402) Google Scholar). Prenucleation assembly rates increased, nucleation lag times decreased, and exponential growth rates increased with increases in protein concentration, pressure, and temperature and with decreases in sucrose concentration (Fig. 2). The aggregation kinetics were highly reproducible, e.g. kprenuc = 6 × 10−4 ± 4 × 10−5 min−1,tlag = 71.2 ± 3.1 min, andkgrowth = 0.060 ± 0.001 min−1(mean ± S.D.) for triplicate samples of 1 mg/ml SMA at 200 MPa and 32 °C. At 200 MPa, prenucleation assembly, nucleation, and growth kinetics were first-order in protein concentration, as determined from the slopes of log-log plots of prenucleation assembly rates (0.92 ± 0.59, r 2 = 0.92), 1/tlag (0.72 ± 0.08,r2 = 0.99), and growth rates (1.29 ± 0.33,r2 = 0.98), respectively, versusdimer concentration. Interestingly, in all instances, nucleation occurred only after OD320 reached 0.10 ± 0.02 (Fig.2), implying that the critical nucleus size is independent of pressure, sucrose concentration, protein concentration, and temperature over the ranges studied. Values for ΔV*prenuc, ΔV*nuc, and ΔV*growth(Table II) corresponded to ∼13, 11, and 26% of ΔVd, respectively. Similarly, values for Δa*prenuc, Δa*nuc, and Δa*growth (Table II) were ∼17, 18, and 32% of Δad, respectively. As Webb et al. (11Webb J.N. Webb S.D. Cleland J.L. Carpenter J.F. Randolph T.W. Proc.

Measured and interconverted ΔV* and Δa* values for prenucleation assembly, nucleation, and growth showed internal consistency (Table II). Δnw* values for prenucleation assembly, nucleation, and growth were estimated as 9, 8, and 18 mol of H2O/mol of dimer from ΔV* and 12, 12, and 23 mol of H2O/mol of dimer from Δa*, respectively.Table IIKinetic parameters for the formation of N* for prenucleation assembly, nucleation, and growth of SMA aggregationParametersPeffectsς effectsΔV*prenuc, ml/mol dimer−14.5 ± 3.0−18.9Δa*prenuc, nm2/molecule1.21.5 ± 0.3Δnw*prenuc, mol H2O/mol dimer8.911.6ΔV*nuc, ml/mol dimer−12.4 ± 6.7−20.2Δa*nuc, nm2/molecule1.01.6 ± 0.3Δnw*nuc, mol H2O/mol dimer7.612.4ΔV*growth, ml/mol dimer−29.8 ± 3.3−36.6Δa*growth, nm2/molecule2.42.9 ± 0.5Δnw*growth, mol H2O/mol dimer18.322.5Boldface values were from experimental data, and other values were calculated as described in detail in Table II of Webb et al.(11Webb J.N.

In circulating, quiescent peripheral blood cells, both cytoplasmic phospholipase A2 and 5-LO are localized to the cytoplasmic compartment, whereas FLAP is localized to the inner and outer nuclear membrane, preventing the release of AA and the formation of LTs. When leukocytes and mast cells are activated, cytoplasmic phospholipase A2 translocates to the nuclear envelope. At the same time, 5-LO translocates to the inner and outer nuclear membranes. The association of 5-LO with these membranes is regulated, in part, by FLAP (7Woods J.W. Evans J.F. Ethier D. Scott S. Vickers P.J. Hearn L. Heibein J.A. Charleson S. Singer I.I. J. Exp.

LTC4 synthase and FLAP are closely related 17-kDa transmembrane proteins, and both are predicted to have three hydrophobic domains. The region that extends from the first predicted hydrophilic loop to the third hydrophobic domain is highly homologous between the two proteins (Fig.1). The localization of LTC4 synthase has not been characterized in detail. FLAP is distributed between the inner and outer nuclear membranes and peripheral ER. The first hydrophilic loop of FLAP was localized to the lumen of the nuclear membrane (7Woods J.W. Evans J.F. Ethier D. Scott S. Vickers P.J. Hearn L. Heibein J.A. Charleson S. Singer I.I. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 178: 1935-1946Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar), but the topology of the second hydrophilic loop and the C and N termini of FLAP are unknown, although a model with three transmembrane domains was proposed (8Mancini J.A.

Chem. 1997; 272: 13923-13928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). GSH conjugation is determined by amino acid residue Tyr93 in the second hydrophilic loop, suggesting that the hydrophilic loops are on the same, cytoplasmic side of the membrane (Fig. 1 B). No experimental determination of the topology has been made to support this model, and other relationships between the hydrophilic loops and the C-and N termini may exist (Fig.1, C–G).We have analyzed the distribution and topology of LTC4synthase using a combination of immunofluorescence, confocal, and electron microscopy combined with differential membrane permeabilization by streptolysin O (SLO). Surprisingly, and in contrast to the closely related FLAP protein, LTC4 synthase is distributed on the outer nuclear membrane and in the peripheral ER but is strictly excluded from the inner nuclear membrane. Furthermore, the active site of LTC4 synthase is localized in the lumen of the nuclear envelope and ER. These results support the possibility that the intracellular synthesis of LTB4 and LTC4may be differentially compartmentalized and that LTC4 is synthesized on the luminal face of the ER membrane from where it must be returned to the cytoplasm for eventual export by MRP. In addition, the differential localization of two integral membrane proteins of essentially the same size, with a high degree of identity, indicates that mechanisms other than size-dependent exclusion regulate the passage of integral membrane proteins to the inner nuclear membrane.DISCUSSIONEndogenous or overexpressed LTC4 synthase show the same characteristic dense staining in the nuclear envelope extending to the peripheral ER (Fig. 2), which was clearly distinct from that of lamin A/C. The digital overlap with lamin showed a bright yellow rim surrounding the nucleus. Since lamin A/C was restricted to a tight nuclear rim, this suggested that the distribution of LTC4synthase extended well into the peripheral ER. This distribution was seen for FLAP in peripheral blood human monocytes (7Woods J.W. Evans J.F. Ethier D. Scott S. Vickers P.J. Hearn L. Heibein J.A. Charleson S. Singer I.I. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 178: 1935-1946Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). When examined by EM, FLAP was distributed almost equally to the inner and outer nuclear membrane (7Woods J.W. Evans J.F. Ethier D. Scott S. Vickers P.J. Hearn L. Heibein J.A. Charleson S. Singer I.I. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 178: 1935-1946Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). Furthermore, 5-LO, which was localized in the cytosol of resting monocytes and neutrophils, was associated with the outer and inner nuclear membrane after cell activation. This movement of 5-LO through the nuclear pore has been well characterized (23Brock T.G. McNish R.W. Peters-Golden M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21652-21658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 24Chen X-S. Zhang Y-Y. Funk C.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31237-31244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) and is mediated by a nuclear localization sequence at the C-terminal of the molecule (24Chen X-S. Zhang Y-Y. Funk C.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31237-31244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 25Lepley R.A. Fitzpatrick F.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 356: 71-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Recently, LTA4 hydrolase has been shown to have the potential to move through nuclear pores and target to the nucleus in RBL cells (26Brock T.G. Maydanski E. McNish R.W. Peters-Golden M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35071-35077Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), indicating that LTB4 would be synthesized in the nuclear compartment. It was not determined whether LTA4 hydrolase was translocated to the cell membrane after activation.LTC4 synthase and FLAP share 52% identity between amino acids 41 and 97 of FLAP and amino acids 45–101 of LTC4synthase, which includes the two loops of the active site. Because of this high identity and the small 17-kDa size of these two proteins, it was highly surprising that the distribution of LTC4synthase between the inner and outer nuclear membrane was distinct from that of FLAP (Fig. 7). This restriction of LTC4 synthase to the outer nuclear membrane combined with the observation that LTB4 may be made within the nucleus suggests that the synthesis of LTB4 and LTC4 can be differentially compartmentalized within cells. This points to potential differences in their role in intracellular function and intracellular trafficking. Various studies have suggested a role for LTB4in gene transcription as a ligand for peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (27Devchand P.R. Keller H. Peters J.M. Vazquez M. Gonzalez F.J. Wahli W. Nature. 1996; 384: 39-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (1199) Google Scholar). The exclusion of LTC4 synthase from the inner nuclear membrane suggests that LTC4 is less likely than LTB4 to play an intracellular role in modulating nuclear function and in transcriptional regulation.It is generally accepted that after their synthesis and insertion in the ER, integral membrane proteins become localized to the inner nuclear membrane by lateral diffusion through the proteolipid bilayer of the outer nuclear membrane followed by diffusion around the nuclear pore (28Soullam B. Worman H.J. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 15-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 29Ellenberg J. Siggia E.D. Moreira J.E. Smith C.L. Presley J.F. Worman H.J. Lippincott-Schwartz J. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 1193-1206Crossref PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar). In this model, the proteins are subsequently immobilized in the inner membrane by binding to immobile nucleoskeletal or nucleoplasmic ligands or by multimerization. The main mechanism excluding proteins from entry into the inner membrane is based on size, so that proteins with cytosolic/nucleoplasmic domains greater than 70 kDa fail to localize to the inner nuclear membrane (28Soullam B. Worman H.J. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 15-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Proteins that do not fall into either category would be potentially free to diffuse between all contiguous membrane domains and be equally represented in the inner and outer nuclear membrane. FLAP fulfills these postulates and fits in the latter group, being equally represented in the inner and outer membrane (7Woods J.W. Evans J.F. Ethier D. Scott S. Vickers P.J. Hearn L. Heibein J.A. Charleson S. Singer I.I. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 178: 1935-1946Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). LTC4 synthase contradicts them, being a small protein essentially the same size as FLAP but being excluded from the inner nuclear membrane. Thus, a different mechanism must exist that allows FLAP free entry into the inner nuclear membrane and excludes LTC4 synthase. This includes the possibility that the primary sequence of FLAP contains a signal that allows it entry to the inner membrane or that LTC4 synthase contains a sequence that signals its exclusion.The orientation of the N and C termini to the cytoplasm (Fig. 2) and the loops of the active site to the ER lumen (Figs. 4 and 5) support the model of membrane topology shown in Fig 1 F. As described above, the release of LTC4 is dependent on its export from cells by the MRP-1 protein, which translocates its substrates from the cytosol to the extracellular space (12Lam B.K. Owen Jr., W.F. Austen K.F. Soberman R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12885-12889Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Jedlitschky G. Buchholz U. Keppler D. Eur. J.

Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 1275-1279Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). LTC4 does not diffuse across membranes and must reenter the cytoplasmic compartment to be accessible to the MRP-1 protein. The mechanism by which this occurs is not known. LTC4 is formed at the luminal face of the ER, where GSH concentrations are 2–3 mm (30Hwang C. Sinskey A.J. Lodish H.F. Science. 1992; 257: 1496-1502Crossref PubMed Scopus (1569) Google Scholar). GSH within the ER has been suggested to play a role mostly as a redox buffer controlling the state of sulfhydryl bonds (31Lundström-Ljung J. Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7822-7828Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Our data suggest that GSH in the ER can serve as an enzymatic substrate in additional reactions. Both prostaglandin H synthases have also been shown to have their active site oriented toward the ER lumen. As for prostaglandin endoperoxides generated by prostaglandin H synthase-1 and -2 (32Spencer A.G. Woods J.W. Arakawa T. Singer I.I. Smith W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9886-9893Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar), how LTC4 moves from the luminal surface to be accessible to intracellular transport and export by the MRP protein remains an open question. Leukotrienes (LTs)1 are proinflammatory products of arachidonic acid (AA) metabolism. LTC4, the parent sulfidopeptide LT, is converted to LTD4 by γ-glutamyl transpeptidase. LTC4 and LTD4 have been implicated in the pathogenesis of asthma, renal disease (1Lewis R.A. Austen K.F. Soberman R.J. N. Engl. J. Med. 1990; 323: 645-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (1166) Google Scholar), and dendritic cell trafficking (2Robbiani D.F. Finch R.A. Jager D. Muller W.A. Sartorelli A.C. Randolph G.J. Cell. 2000; 103: 757-768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). LTC4is formed in four biochemical steps. First, cytoplasmic phospholipase A2 releases AA from phospholipids (3Clark J.D. Lin L.L. Kriz R.W. Ramesha C.S. Sultzman L.A. Lin A.Y. Milona N. Knopf J.L.

Five-lipoxygenase-activating protein (FLAP) then mediates the interaction between five-lipoxygenase (5-LO) and AA (5Dixon R.A. Diehl R.E. Opas E. Rands E. Vickers P.J. Evans J.F. Gillard J.W.

U. S. A. 1986; 83: 857-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). LTC4 synthase then catalyzes the conjugation of GSH with LTA4 to form LTC4 (10Penrose J.F. Gagnon L. Goppelt-Struebe M.

Beijnen J.H. van der Valk M. P. Krimpenfort P. Borst P. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 1275-1279Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). A major strategy used by cells to prevent the formation of these bioactive molecules under resting conditions is compartmentalization of the biosynthetic enzymes. In circulating, quiescent peripheral blood cells, both cytoplasmic phospholipase A2 and 5-LO are localized to the cytoplasmic compartment, whereas FLAP is localized to the inner and outer nuclear membrane, preventing the release of AA and the formation of LTs. When leukocytes and mast cells are activated, cytoplasmic phospholipase A2 translocates to the nuclear envelope. At the same time, 5-LO translocates to the inner and outer nuclear membranes. The association of 5-LO with these membranes is regulated, in part, by FLAP (7Woods J.W. Evans J.F. Ethier D. Scott S. Vickers P.J. Hearn L. Heibein J.A. Charleson S. Singer I.I. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 178: 1935-1946Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar, 16Glover S. Bayburt T. Jonas M. Chi E. Chi E. Gelb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15359-15567Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). LTC4 synthase and FLAP are closely related 17-kDa transmembrane proteins, and both are predicted to have three hydrophobic domains. The region that extends from the first predicted hydrophilic loop to the third hydrophobic domain is highly homologous between the two proteins (Fig.1). The localization of LTC4 synthase has not been characterized in detail. FLAP is distributed between the inner and outer nuclear membranes and peripheral ER. The first hydrophilic loop of FLAP was localized to the lumen of the nuclear membrane (7Woods J.W. Evans J.F. Ethier D. Scott S. Vickers P.J. Hearn L. Heibein J.A. Charleson S. Singer I.I. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 178: 1935-1946Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar), but the topology of the second hydrophilic loop and the C and N termini of FLAP are unknown, although a model with three transmembrane domains was proposed (8Mancini J.A. Abromowitz M. Cox M.E. Wong E. Charleson S. Perrier H. Wang Z. Peptiboon P. Vickers P. FEBS Lett. 1993; 318: 277-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1 A). The first hydrophilic loop of LTC4 synthase binds LTA4 (8Mancini J.A. Abromowitz M. Cox M.E. Wong E. Charleson S. Perrier H. Wang Z. Peptiboon P. Vickers P. FEBS Lett. 1993; 318: 277-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 17Lam B.K. Penrose J.F. Xu K. Baldasaro M.H. Austen K.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13923-13928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). GSH conjugation is determined by amino acid residue Tyr93 in the second hydrophilic loop, suggesting that the hydrophilic loops are on the same, cytoplasmic side of the membrane (Fig. 1 B). No experimental determination of the topology has been made to support this model, and other relationships between the hydrophilic loops and the C-and N termini may exist (Fig.1, C–G). We have analyzed the distribution and topology of LTC4synthase using a combination of immunofluorescence, confocal, and electron microscopy combined with differential membrane permeabilization by streptolysin O (SLO). Surprisingly, and in contrast to the closely related FLAP protein, LTC4 synthase is distributed on the outer nuclear membrane and in the peripheral ER but is strictly excluded from the inner nuclear membrane. Furthermore, the active site of LTC4 synthase is localized in the lumen of the nuclear envelope and ER. These results support the possibility that the intracellular synthesis of LTB4 and LTC4may be differentially compartmentalized and that LTC4 is synthesized on the luminal face of the ER membrane from where it must be returned to the cytoplasm for eventual export by MRP. In addition, the differential localization of two integral membrane proteins of essentially the same size, with a high degree of identity, indicates that mechanisms other than size-dependent exclusion regulate the passage of integral membrane proteins to the inner nuclear membrane. DISCUSSIONEndogenous or overexpressed LTC4 synthase show the same characteristic dense staining in the nuclear envelope extending to the peripheral ER (Fig. 2), which was clearly distinct from that of lamin A/C. The digital overlap with lamin showed a bright yellow rim surrounding the nucleus. Since lamin A/C was restricted to a tight nuclear rim, this suggested that the distribution of LTC4synthase extended well into the peripheral ER. This distribution was seen for FLAP in peripheral blood human monocytes (7Woods J.W. Evans J.F. Ethier D. Scott S. Vickers P.J. Hearn L. Heibein J.A. Charleson S. Singer I.I. J. Exp.

Furthermore, 5-LO, which was localized in the cytosol of resting monocytes and neutrophils, was associated with the outer and inner nuclear membrane after cell activation. This movement of 5-LO through the nuclear pore has been well characterized (23Brock T.G. McNish R.W. Peters-Golden M. J. Biol.

Recently, LTA4 hydrolase has been shown to have the potential to move through nuclear pores and target to the nucleus in RBL cells (26Brock T.G. Maydanski E. McNish R.W. Peters-Golden M. J. Biol.

Worman H.J. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 15-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Proteins that do not fall into either category would be potentially free to diffuse between all contiguous membrane domains and be equally represented in the inner and outer nuclear membrane. FLAP fulfills these postulates and fits in the latter group, being equally represented in the inner and outer membrane (7Woods J.W. Evans J.F. Ethier D. Scott S. Vickers P.J. Hearn L. Heibein J.A. Charleson S. Singer I.I. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 178: 1935-1946Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). LTC4 synthase contradicts them, being a small protein essentially the same size as FLAP but being excluded from the inner nuclear membrane. Thus, a different mechanism must exist that allows FLAP free entry into the inner nuclear membrane and excludes LTC4 synthase. This includes the possibility that the primary sequence of FLAP contains a signal that allows it entry to the inner membrane or that LTC4 synthase contains a sequence that signals its exclusion. The orientation of the N and C termini to the cytoplasm (Fig. 2) and the loops of the active site to the ER lumen (Figs. 4 and 5) support the model of membrane topology shown in Fig 1 F. As described above, the release of LTC4 is dependent on its export from cells by the MRP-1 protein, which translocates its substrates from the cytosol to the extracellular space (12Lam B.K.

Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 1275-1279Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). LTC4 does not diffuse across membranes and must reenter the cytoplasmic compartment to be accessible to the MRP-1 protein. The mechanism by which this occurs is not known. LTC4 is formed at the luminal face of the ER, where GSH concentrations are 2–3 mm (30Hwang C. Sinskey A.J. Lodish H.F. Science. 1992; 257: 1496-1502Crossref PubMed Scopus (1569) Google Scholar). GSH within the ER has been suggested to play a role mostly as a redox buffer controlling the state of sulfhydryl bonds (31Lundström-Ljung J. Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7822-7828Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Our data suggest that GSH in the ER can serve as an enzymatic substrate in additional reactions. Both prostaglandin H synthases have also been shown to have their active site oriented toward the ER lumen. As for prostaglandin endoperoxides generated by prostaglandin H synthase-1 and -2 (32Spencer A.G. Woods J.W. Arakawa T. Singer I.I. Smith W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9886-9893Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar), how LTC4 moves from the luminal surface to be accessible to intracellular transport and export by the MRP protein remains an open question.

https://openalex.org/W2103235308,"Abstract c-Abl is a non-receptor tyrosine kinase implicated in DNA damage-induced cell death and in growth factor receptor signaling. To further understand the function and regulation of c-Abl, a yeast two-hybrid screen was performed to identify c-Abl-interacting proteins. Here we report the identification of Abl-philin 2 (Aph2), encoding a novel protein with a unique cysteine-rich motif (zf-DHHC) and a 53-amino acid stretch sharing homology with the creatine kinase family. Thezf-DHHC domain is highly conserved from yeast to human. Two proteins containing this motif, Akr1p and Erf2p, have been characterized in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, both implicated in signaling pathways. Deletion analysis by two-hybrid assays revealed that the N-terminal portion of Aph2 interacts with the C terminus of c-Abl. Aph2 was demonstrated to interact with c-Abl by co-immunoprecipitation assays. Aph2 is expressed in most tissues tested and is localized in the cytoplasm, mainly in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The sequences required for ER location reside in the N terminus and the zf-DHHC motif of Aph2. It has been reported that a portion of c-Abl is localized in the ER. We demonstrate here that Aph2 and c-Abl are co-localized in the ER region. Overexpression of Aph2 leads to apoptosis as justified by TUNEL assays, and the induction of apoptosis requires the N terminus. Co-expression of c-Abl and Aph2 had a synergistic effect on apoptosis induction and led to a decreased expression of both proteins, suggesting either that these two proteins are mutually down-regulated or that cells expressing both c-Abl and Aph2 rapidly disappeared from the culture. These results suggest that Aph2 may be involved in ER stress-induced apoptosis in which c-Abl plays an important role."

Grb7 has been implicated as a downstream mediator of integrin-FAK signal pathways in the regulation of cell migration, although the molecular mechanisms are still not well understood. In this paper, we investigated the potential role and mechanisms of PH domain in Grb7 in the regulation of cell migration. We found that the PH domain mediated Grb7 binding to phospholipids bothin vitro and in intact cells. Furthermore, both Grb7 and its PH domain preferentially interacted with phosphatidylinositol phosphates showing strongest affinity to the D3- and D5-phosphoinositides. The PH domain interaction with phosphoinositides was shown to play a role in the stimulation of cell migration by Grb7. It was also shown to be necessary for Grb7 phosphorylation by FAK, although it was not required for Grb7 interaction with FAK or recruitment to the focal contacts. Last, we found that PI 3-kinase activity played a role in both Grb7 association with phosphoinositides and its stimulation of cell migration. In addition, both FAK binding to PI 3-kinase via its autophosphorylated Tyr397 and integrin-mediated cell adhesion increased Grb7 association with phosphoinositides. Together, these results identified the Grb7 PH domain interaction with phosphoinositides and suggested a potential mechanism by which several signaling molecules including Grb7, FAK, and PI 3-kinase and their interactions cooperate to mediate signal transduction pathways in integrin-mediated cell migration.

Cell migration is a multistep process that involves extension of lamellipodia in response to environmental cues, contraction of cell bodies regulated by the cytoskeleton, and detachment from adhesion sites at the rear of cells (1Horwitz A.R. Parsons J.T. Science. 1999; 286: 1102-1103Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). Initiation of cell migration involves sensing of the gradients of soluble chemoattractants and/or immobilized extracellular matrix proteins or other cell surface molecules by cell surface receptors. In mammalian fibroblasts, various growth factor receptors and the integrin family of cell adhesion receptors have been shown to play essential roles in the initiation and regulation of cell migration. Recent studies have suggested that focal adhesion kinase (FAK)1 serves as a major mediator of integrin signaling in the regulation of cell migration (2Ilic D. Damsky C.H. Yamamoto T. J.

Furthermore, several different signaling pathways downstream of FAK have been implicated in cell migration. These include formation of signaling complexes between FAK and Src and their subsequent phosphorylation of p130cas (7Cary L.A. Chang J.F. Guan J.L. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 1787-1794Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Cary L.A. Han D.C. Polte T.R. Hanks S.K. Guan J.L. J.

Our recent studies also suggest that FAK binding and phosphorylation of the adaptor molecule Grb7 play an important role in the regulation of cell migration (12Han D.C. Guan J.L. J. Biol.

Grb7 is a family member of Src homology 2 (SH2) domain-containing adaptor molecules that also include Grb10 and Grb14 (14Margolis B. Silvennoinen O. Comoglio F. Roonprapunt C. Skolnik E. Ullrich A.

Oncogene. 2001; 44: 6315-6321Crossref Scopus (141) Google Scholar). The Grb7 family members share similar structural organizations, including an amino-terminal proline-rich region; a central segment termed the GM region (for Grb and Mig), which includes a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain and shares sequence homology with theCaenorhabditis elegans protein, Mig-10, and a carboxyl-terminal SH2 domain. Like other adaptor molecules, Grb7 family members have been shown to interact with a variety of cell surface receptors and other signaling proteins (17Han D.C. Shen T.L. Guan J.L. Oncogene. 2001; 44: 6315-6321Crossref Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Most of these interactions are mediated by the SH2 domain of the Grb7 family members and a phosphotyrosine motif in the activated receptors/other signaling molecules. It is likely that these binding partners are upstream regulators for the Grb7 family molecules. In contrast, little is known about potential downstream effectors of the Grb7 family proteins. Given the role of Grb7 family proteins as adaptor molecules, it is likely that potential downstream effectors will interact with other conserved domains of Grb7 like the Pro-rich region or the GM region. The high homology of Grb7 family proteins with the C. elegans protein Mig-10, which is involved in the regulation of neuronal cell migration during embryonic development (18Manser J. Roonprapunt C. Margolis B. Dev. Biol. 1997; 184: 150-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 19Manser J. Wood W.B. Dev. Genet. 1990; 11: 49-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), suggests that Grb7 may play a role in the regulation of mammalian cell migration. This is supported by our recent data showing the role of Grb7 in mediating the FAK downstream pathways in cell migration (12Han D.C. Guan J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24425-24430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar,13Han D.C. Shen T.L. Guan J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28911-28917Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). We found that the SH2 domain of Grb7 can directly interact with autophosphorylated Tyr397 of FAK in a cell adhesion-dependent manner. Association of Grb7 with FAK promotes its recruitment to focal contacts and phosphorylation by FAK, which are both critical for Grb7 to mediate FAK-stimulated cell migration. These studies also suggested an important role for the central GM region of Grb7 in cell migration. Furthermore, we showed that the formation of the FAK-Grb7 complex was independent of the FAK complexes with Src or its binding to PI 3-kinase (13Han D.C. Shen T.L. Guan J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28911-28917Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 20Reiske H.R. Zhao J. Han D.C. Cooper L.A. Guan J.L. FEBS Lett. 2000; 486: 275-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). It is not clear, however, whether the FAK/Grb7 pathway cooperates with these other two pathways triggered by FAK in the regulation of cell migration. PH domains are a module of about 100 amino acids that has been reported in a variety of signaling molecules including protein kinases, phospholipases, GTPases, adaptor proteins, and cytoskeletal proteins (21Rebecchi M.J. Scarlata S. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1998; 27: 503-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 22Lemmon M.A. Ferguson K.M. Biochem. J. 2000; 350: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar). Besides interactions with other proteins, PH domains have been shown to interact with phospholipids (23Kavran J.M. Klein D.E. Lee A.

Fournier E. Isakoff S.J. Skolnik E.Y. Lemmon M.A. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 373-384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Interestingly, a number of proteins showed specific binding to the PI 3-kinase product D3 phosphoinositides through their PH domains, which are consistent with their role as downstream mediators of PI 3-kinase (25Isakoff S.J. Cardozo T. Andreev J. Li Z. Ferguson K.M. Abagyan R. Lemmon M.A. Aronheim A. Skolnik E.Y. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5374-5387Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). The presence of the PH domain in Grb7 suggested its possible interactions with phospholipids, which could potentially contribute to regulation of cell migration by Grb7. Furthermore, this interaction could also play a role in the cooperation between FAK/Grb7 and FAK/PI 3-kinase signaling pathways in cell migration. In this report, we investigated the potential role and mechanisms of the PH domain of Grb7 in the regulation of cell migration as well as the potential cooperation of FAK/Grb7 signaling pathway with the PI 3-kinase signaling pathway.

They were then induced with 0.5 mmisopropyl-β-thiogalactopyranoside for 2–4 h at 30 °C. The bacteria were pelleted and lysed with 5 mg/ml lysozyme in TEN buffer (40 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl) on ice for 5 min followed by three cycles of freezing/thawing in PBS with 20 mm EDTA. The lysates were then made up to 1% Triton X-100, 500 mm NaCl, and 10 mm dithiothreitol before shearing by repeated passages through a 21-gauge needle as described by Drugan et al.(28Drugan J.K. Rogers-Graham K. Gilmer T. Campbell S. Clark G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35021-35027Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). They were then clarified by centrifugation and immobilized on glutathione-agarose beads for 4 h at 4 °C. The beads were then washed with PBS and stored at −80 °C. For protein-lipid overlay assays, the fusion proteins were eluted with 5 mmglutathione as described previously (12Han D.C. Guan J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24425-24430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). 293 cells were phosphate-starved for 4 h by incubation in phosphate-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) at 37 °C. The cells were then labeled with 0.1 mCi/ml 32Pifor another 4 h at 37 °C. Cell lysates were prepared in ice-cold lipid lysis buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 2 mm Na3VO4, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mg/ml aprotinin, 20 mg/ml leupeptin, 30 mm sodium pyrophosphates). Equal amounts of the lysates were then incubated with GST fusion proteins immobilized on glutathione-agarose beads on ice for 1 h. After washing three times with the lipid lysis buffer, the bound lipids were extracted from half of the beads by mixing with methanol/chloroform (1:1) and 1 n HCl sequentially. They were then spotted on TLC plates and developed as described previously (29Martel V. Racaud-Sultan C. Dupe S. Marie C. Paulhe F. Galmiche A. Block M.R. Albiges-Rizo C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21217-21227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). The 32P-radiolabeled phospholipids spots were then quantified by a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). The remaining half of the beads were then boiled in SDS-PAGE sample buffer and analyzed on SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie Blue staining to confirm similar amounts of GST fusion proteins. For detection of association of Grb7 or its segments with phospholipids in intact cells, 293 or CHO cells were transfected with pDHGST vectors encoding Grb7 or its segments. In some experiments, another expression vector was co-transfected. In other experiments, the cells were treated with 50 nm LY294002, 15 μmwortmannin, or Me2SO alone prior to cell lysis. Twenty-four hours after transfection, the cells were phosphate-starved and labeled with 0.1 mCi/ml 32Pi, and lysates were prepared, as described above. The GST fusion proteins containing Grb7 or its segments were pulled down by glutathione-agarose beads as described previously (12Han D.C. Guan J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24425-24430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar), and the associated phospholipids were analyzed as described above. Membrane arrays (PIP-StripsTM) spotted with 100 pmol of phospholipids were purchased from Echelon Research Laboratories (Salt Lake City, UT) and used for protein-lipid overlay assays by following the manufacturer's guidelines. Briefly, membranes were blocked with 3% (w/v) fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin (Sigma) in TBST (10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20) for 1 h at room temperature. Blocked membranes were incubated with 0.5 μg/ml GST fusion proteins overnight at 4 °C with gentle agitation. They were then washed three times (10 min each) with TBST plus 3% fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin. After washing, membranes were subjected to Western blotting using anti-GST to detect the bound GST fusion proteins, as described below. Cell migration assays for transiently transfected CHO cells were performed as described previously (13Han D.C. Shen T.L. Guan J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28911-28917Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), except that constructs encoding GFP fusion proteins were used directly (instead of co-transfection with a vector encoding GFP) to identify positively transfected cells in some experiments. For experiments with the PI 3-kinase inhibitors wortmannin and LY294002, cells were pretreated for 30 min with the inhibitors prior to initiation of the cell migration assays in the presence of 50 nm LY294002, 15 μm wortmannin, or Me2SO alone. Subconfluent cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and then lysed with 1% Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 137 mmNaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 1 mmNa3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mg/ml aprotinin, and 20 mg/ml leupeptin). Lysates were cleared by centrifugation, and total protein concentration was determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay. Immunoprecipitations were carried out by incubating cell lysates with appropriate antibodies for 3 h at 4 °C, followed by incubation for 1 h with protein A-Sepharose 4B (Sigma) or Protein G Plus (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) beads. After washing, immune complexes were resolved using SDS-PAGE. Western blotting was carried out using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated IgG as a secondary antibody and the AmershamBiosciences ECL system for detection. CHO cells were transfected with pEGFP-Grb7 or pEGFP-Grb7-R239L using the LipofectAMINE transfection reagents (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's guidelines. One day after transfection, the cells were processed for immunofluorescence staining as described previously (30Shen T.L. Guan J.L. FEBS Lett. 2001; 499: 176-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were plated on 12-mm coverslips that had been coated with 10 μg/ml human plasma fibronectin overnight at 4 °C. They were incubated in a 37 °C, 5% CO2 incubator to allow for cell attachment and spreading. Cells were then fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature, washed three times with PBS, and then permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 for 10 min at room temperature. After washing three times with PBS, the cells were stained with polyclonal anti-GFP (1:300; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and anti-vinculin monoclonal antibody (1:50; Sigma) in the presence of 10% goat serum for 1 h at 37 °C. After washing three times with PBS, the bound primary antibody was detected using fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (1:150) and Texas Red-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (1:100) antibodies, respectively. Images of stained cells were captured using an immunofluorescence microscope under a 100× oil immersion objective and a CCD camera. To investigate potential functions of the PH domain in Grb7, we first examined whether it could bind phospholipids using both in vitro and in vivobinding assays. GST fusion proteins containing full-length Grb7, its SH2 domain, or its PH domain (Fig.1 A) were incubated with lysates prepared from 293 cells that had been metabolically labeled with 32Pi as described under “Materials and Methods.” The bound phospholipids were extracted and analyzed by thin layer chromatography and quantified using a PhosphorImager. As shown in Fig. 1 B, GST-Grb7 exhibited increased binding to phospholipids compared with the GST control. Furthermore, GST-PH also showed a similar increase in phospholipid binding, whereas GST-SH2 did not. Duplicate samples were analyzed by Coomassie Blue staining to show similar amounts of the fusion proteins present in all samples (Fig.1 C). These results suggest that Grb7 can bind to phospholipids through its PH domain. We also examined the association of Grb7 with phospholipids in intact cells. Mammalian expression vectors encoding GST-tagged Grb7 or its mutants (see Fig. 1 A) were transiently transfected into 293 cells. The cells were then metabolically labeled with32Pi as described under “Materials and Methods.” Cell lysates were prepared, and GST-Grb7 or its mutants were precipitated with glutathione-coupled agarose beads. The bound phospholipids were then extracted and analyzed by thin layer chromatography and quantified using a PhosphorImager. As shown in Fig.1 D, Grb7 as well as its PH domain alone associated with phospholipids in intact cells. Based on site-directed mutagenesis and x-ray crystal structures for PH domains in a number of proteins, several highly conserved residues within PH domains play critical roles for their association with phospholipids (24Ferguson K.M.

To determine whether the Grb7 PH domain also requires these critical residues for phospholipid binding, we generated several point mutations at these sites. Mutation of Arg239 in the PH domain (R239L mutant) as well as other key residues (data not shown) abolished binding of Grb7 to phospholipids. These data are consistent with the in vitro binding results that the PH domain in Grb7 can mediate its binding to phospholipids. They also suggest that it interacted with phospholipids in a similar manner as other PH domain because the same critical residues were necessary for the binding. To evaluate the binding specificity of the Grb7 PH domain to various phospholipids, we employed a protein-lipid overlap assay using membranes that had been spotted with an equal amount (100 pmol) of different phospholipids (Fig.2 A). The purified GST fusion proteins containing Grb7 or its mutants were incubated with the membrane strips as described under “Materials and Methods.” After washing, the bound GST fusion proteins were detected by Western blotting with anti-GST antibody. As expected, the GST control did not bind to any of the phospholipids (Fig. 2 B). On the other hand, GST-Grb7 showed binding to several phosphatidylinositol phosphates with various affinity (Fig. 2 C). It bound to PtdIns-3-P and PtdIns-5-P with the greatest strength, followed by moderate binding to PtdIns-4-P and PtdIns-3,5-P2, and a very weak binding to PtdIns-3,4-P2 and PtdIns-3,4,5-P3. Similarly, the PH domain alone also bound to these phosphatidylinositol phosphates, although it exhibited a slightly stronger binding to PtdIns-3,4,5-P3 than the full-length Grb7 (Fig. 2 E). Mutation of the critical Arg239 residue (R239L mutant) abolished the binding of full-length Grb7 to all phosphatidylinositol phosphates (Fig.2 D), and the SH2 domain alone did not bind to any of the phospholipids (Fig. 2 F). Together, these results indicated that Grb7 preferentially interacted with D3- and D5- phosphoinositides via its PH domain. To investigate the role of the Grb7 PH domain and its interaction with phosphatidylinositol phosphates in cell migration, we compared the effects of R239L mutant and wild type Grb7 on cell motility using a time-lapse imaging-based computerized motility analysis method called OMAware, as described previously (13Han D.C. Shen T.L. Guan J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28911-28917Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). CHO cells were transiently transfected with expression vectors encoding Grb7 or its mutants with GFP fused at their N termini. The expression of transfected Grb7 or its mutants was verified by Western blotting using anti-GFP (Fig. 3 A). The effects of these constructs on cell motility were then evaluated using OMAware. Fig. 3 B shows that GFP-Grb7 stimulated cell migration when compared with untransfected cells, which is consistent with our previous results using Grb7 alone (13Han D.C. Shen T.L. Guan J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28911-28917Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). In contrast, the GFP-R239L mutant did not stimulate but actually inhibited cell migration. This inhibitory effect could be due to its functioning as a dominant negative mutant by competing with endogenous Grb7 for binding to FAK (via its still intact SH2 domain (see Ref. 12Han D.C. Guan J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24425-24430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar and Fig.4 B)) yet failing to interact with phosphatidylinositol phosphates to trigger downstream events. The Grb7 PH domain alone also inhibited cell migration. This domain may function in a dominant negative manner by competing with endogenous Grb7 for binding phosphatidylinositol phosphates yet failing to associate with FAK due to lack of the SH2 domain. This possibility is supported by the lack of an effect on cell migration by the corresponding PH domain mutant with Arg239 mutated to Leu. The PH domain from Akt did not affect cell migration either, providing further support for a specific role of the Grb7 PH domain in the regulation of cell migration. Together, these data suggested that the Grb7 PH domain and its interaction with phosphatidylinositol phosphates play a critical role in the regulation of cell migration.Figure 4Subcellular localization and tyrosine phosphorylation of Grb7 and R239L mutant.

We now report its complete amino acid sequence determined by Edman degradation and its biological effects on mouse and human vascular endothelial cells. ICPP is a homodimeric protein linked by cysteine disulfide bonds of 25115 Da revealed by mass spectrometry. Each monomer is composed of 110 amino acids including eight cysteine residues and a pyroglutamic acid at the N-terminal extremity. ICPP shares 52% sequence identity with human VEGF but lacks the heparin binding domain and Asn glycosylation site. Besides its strong capillary permeability activity, ICPP was found to be a potent in vitro angiogenic factor when added to mouse embryonic stem cells or human umbilical vein endothelial cells. ICPP was found to be as potent as human VEGF165 in activating p42/p44 MAPK, in reinitiation of DNA synthesis in human umbilical vein endothelial cells, and in promoting in vitro angiogenesis of mouse embryonic stem cells. All these biological actions, including capillary permeability in mice, were fully inhibited by 1 μm of a new specific VEGF receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor (ZM317450) from AstraZeneca that belongs to the anilinocinnoline family of compounds. Indeed, up to a 30 times higher concentration of inhibitor did not affect platelet-derived growth factor, epidermal growth factor, FGF-2, insulin, α-thrombin, or fetal calf serum-induced p42/p44 MAPK and reinitiation of DNA synthesis. Therefore, we conclude that this venom-derived ICPP exerts its biological action (permeability and angiogenesis) through activation of VEGF receptor signaling (VEGF-R2 and possibly VEGF-R1).

It is also associated with a number of pathological situations including diabetic retinopathy, inflammation, brain edema following ischemic stroke, solid tumor growth, and metastasis. A number of polypeptide growth factors have been demonstrated to induce and regulate angiogenesis in vivo, among them fibroblast growth factor (FGF),1 platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), epidermal growth factor (EGF), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A (1Folkman J. Klagsbrun M. Science. 1987; 235: 442-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (4022) Google Scholar, 2Carmeliet P. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 389-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (3426) Google Scholar). Although the mode of activation at the receptor level differs, all these mitogens activate the ubiquitously expressed isoforms of mitogen-activated protein kinases referred to as p42/p44 MAPK or Erk, two essential transducers of growth, survival, and differentiation signals.VEGF was the first mitogenic growth factor proven to have endothelial cell specificity and to be critical for blood vessel formation. The vascular endothelium-specific growth factors are now known to include five members of the VEGF family, four members of the angiopoietin family, and at least one member of the large ephrin family (3Yancopoulos G.D. Davis S. Gale N.W. Rudge J.S. Wiegand S.J. Holash J. Nature. 2000; 407: 242-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (3253) Google Scholar). VEGF is a multifunctional cytokine that is produced by virtually every tissue and overexpressed upon hypoxic stress and oncogenic transformation (4Mazure N.M. Chen E.Y. Yeh P. Laderoute K.R. Giaccia A.J. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 3436-3440PubMed Google Scholar). It is a homodimeric glycoprotein, expressed as several spliced variants; the major forms contain 121, 165, 189, and 206 amino acids. VEGF121 differs from the larger VEGF isoforms in that it is the only VEGF type that does not possess heparin binding ability (5Houck K.A. Leung D.W. Rowland A.M. Winer J. Ferrara N. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 26031-26037Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These isoforms act in a coordinate fashion to recruit and expand the tumor vasculature (6Grunstein J. Masbad J.J. Hickey R. Giordano F. Johnson R.S. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 20: 7282-7291Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). The main receptors that seem to be involved in initiating signal transduction cascades in response to VEGFs comprise a family of closely related receptor tyrosine kinases that are expressed almost exclusively on neovasculature and on the tumor endothelium. They consist of three members now termed VEGFR-1 (Fms-like tyrosine kinase, Flt-1), VEGFR-2 (kinase insert domain-containing receptor (KDR)), and the VEGF-C and -D receptor, VEGFR-3 (known previously as Flt-3). Some other accessory receptors (neuropilins) that seem to be involved primarily in modulating binding to the main receptors have also been reported (7Soker S. Takashima S. Miao H. Neufeld G. Klagsbrun M. Cell. 1998; 92: 735-745Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2058) Google Scholar). Their roles in signaling have not yet been fully elucidated (3Yancopoulos G.D. Davis S. Gale N.W. Rudge J.S. Wiegand S.J. Holash J. Nature. 2000; 407: 242-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (3253) Google Scholar). VEGFR-2, however, via activation of intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity, appears to mediate all the major actions of VEGF: capillary permeability, chemotaxis, cell survival, and cell division (8Matsumoto T. Claesson-Welsh L. Sci. STKE. 2001. 2001; 112: RE21www.stke.sciencemag.orgGoogle Scholar).The possibility that vascular growth factors may help prevent or repair damaged and leaky vessels offers therapeutic hope for ischemic diseases, diabetic retinopathy, or inflammatory setting (9Ferrara N. Alitalo K. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 1359-1364Crossref PubMed Scopus (908) Google Scholar, 10Thurston G. Rudge J.S. Ioffe E. Zhou H. Ross L. Croll S.D. Glazer N. Holash J. McDonald D.M. Yancopoulos G.D. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 460-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (1078) Google Scholar). In opposition, new antitumoral approaches targeting the tumor vasculature via inhibition of VEGF signaling are actively being developed; they include neutralizing anti-VEGF antibodies, anti-VEGF receptor antibodies, soluble VEGF receptors, antisense VEGF techniques, and VEGF receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (11Gasparini G. Harris A.L. J. Clin. Oncol. 1995; 13: 765-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar).We have previously isolated a protein from Vipera lebetinavenom based on its potent ability to increase capillary permeability. The partial sequence of this protein, referred to as increasing capillary permeability protein (ICPP), revealed a VEGF-like structure (12Gasmi A. Abidi F. Srairi N. Oijatayer A. Karoui H. Elayeb M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 268: 69-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In this report, we present the complete amino acid sequence of ICPP and demonstrate that this venom related-VEGF is capable of inducing p42/p44 MAPK activity and DNA synthesis in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) and of promoting in vitro angiogenesis. Interestingly, all these ICPP-induced biological actions are fully inhibited by a new VEGF receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor, as presented here.DISCUSSIONSnake venoms represent an extraordinary source of biological molecules that have been invaluable to our knowledge and understanding of basic biological processes. Besides the toxins acting directly in the nervous system, many venom proteins target blood capillaries, preventing blood coagulation via disintegrins and enzymes degrading fibrinogens, whereas others increase the permeability of blood capillaries. This is the case for bradykinin potentiating factors purified from B. jararaca that convert angiotensin I into angiotensin II and phospholipase A2 purified fromTrimeresurus mucrosquamatus, which induces release of histamine from mast cell degranulation (32Markland F.S. Toxicon. 1998; 36: 1749-1800Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar). In this context, it is remarkable to see the emergence of a new set of selected molecules with permeability capacity in snake venoms. ICPP, an increasing capillary permeability protein of V. lebetinavenom, is indeed a VEGF-related molecule highly homologous to the HF with vascular permeability activity (23Komori Y. Nikai T. Taniguchi T. Masuda K. Sugihara H. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 11769-11803Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar). During the preparation of this manuscript, another report demonstrated the expression of related VEGF molecules in the venom of Bothrops jararaca (pit viper) (24Junqueira de Azevedo I.L. Farsky S.H. Oliveira M.L. Ho P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39836-39842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), a result extending the notion that many snakes have evolved to specifically express in their venoms VEGF-like molecules, the most potent permeability factors described so far in vertebrates. During evolution, the co-selection in snake venoms of potent toxins together with the most effective permeability factors was certainly crucial for rapid dissemination of the toxins in the general circulation of the prey.In the present study, we determined the complete amino acid sequence of ICPP, confirming that it is structurally related to the PDGF family. This protein consists of two homodimers of 110 amino acids having a molecular mass of 25115 Da. ICPP shares the highest sequence identity with HF, the hypotensive factor purified from V. aspis aspis(23Komori Y. Nikai T. Taniguchi T. Masuda K. Sugihara H. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 11769-11803Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar), and the recently identified svVEGF from B. insularispit viper venom (24Junqueira de Azevedo I.L. Farsky S.H. Oliveira M.L. Ho P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39836-39842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). ICPP, together with the other snake svVEGFs, shares about 50% identity with human VEGF-A (22Leung D.W. Cachiane G. Kuang W.J. Goddel D.V. Ferrara N. Science. 1989; 246: 1306-1309Crossref PubMed Scopus (4413) Google Scholar). ICPP, like HF and svVEGF, differs in length from VEGF165, lacking a heparin binding domain and a potential N-linked glycosylation site. The recombinant protein svVEGF from the B. insularis pit viper was biologically characterized only by its ability to increase vascular permeability (24Junqueira de Azevedo I.L. Farsky S.H. Oliveira M.L. Ho P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39836-39842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). However, in addition to increasing permeability, HF has been shown to also exert a strong hypotensive effect and have a mitogenic effect on endothelial cells. The mitogenic activity of HF was 5–10 times lower than that of VEGF and was inhibited by cycloheximide. The authors speculated that this protein may induce a signaling response and increase protein synthesis in endothelial cells, but studies examining the mechanism of action have not been reported (23Komori Y. Nikai T. Taniguchi T. Masuda K. Sugihara H. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 11769-11803Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar).VEGF functions by interacting with two well characterized high affinity tyrosine kinase receptors, VEGF-R1 and VEGF-R2, that are selectively expressed on endothelium. VEGF-R2 appears to be the dominant signaling receptor in VEGF- induced mitogenesis, and permeability increases (33Waltenberger J. Claesson-Welsh L. Siegbahn A. Shibuya M. Heldin C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26988-26995Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Korpelainen E.I. Alitalo K. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 159-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar), whereas the role of VEGF-R1 in endothelial cell function is much less clear. Recent findings suggest that VEGF-R1 may have a negative role, either by acting as a decoy receptor or by suppressing signaling through VEGF-R2 (35Rahimi N. Dayanir V. Lashkari K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16986-16992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar).Plasmin cleavage of VEGF165 generates a 110-residue long N-terminal fragment (VEGF110) that lacks the heparin binding domains. VEGF110 is thought to maintain the ability to bind to the VEGF receptors, but its endothelial cell mitogenic potency is decreased substantially (100-fold) relative to VEGF165, indicating that the heparin binding domains are critical for stimulating endothelial cell proliferation (36Keyt B.A. Berleau L.T. Nguyen H.V. Chen H. Heinsohn H. Vendleu R. Ferrara N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7788-7795Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar). This finding also concurs with experiments using VEGF121, which does not bind to either heparan sulfates or to the extracellular matrix. VEGF121 has been described as being 10–100-fold less potent than VEGF165 at inducing biological responses in endothelial cells (37Ogawa S. Oku A. Sawano A. Yamaguchi S. Yazaki Y. Shibuya M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31273-31282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). The effect of glycosylation of VEGF165 on receptor binding has also been studied by Keyt et al. (25Keyt B.A. Nguyen H.V. Berleau L.T. Ouarta C.M. Park J. Chen H. Ferrara N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5638-5646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar) using a constructed unglycosylated form of VEGF. They showed that N-linked carbohydrate at Asn-75 does not appear to have an effect in mediating VEGF receptor binding and the precise role of glycosylation remains to be elucidated.ICPP and VEGF165 were tested in parallel in various bioassays including MAP kinase activation, in vitro angiogenesis, and capillary permeability. In this regard, our studies have shown that ICPP, like VEGF165 and FGF-2, stimulates p42/p44 MAP kinases in HUVEC. The activity of ICPP was found to be at least 1.5 times more potent than human recombinant VEGF165 and mediated via signaling through endogenous VEGF receptors. The requirement for VEGF receptor signaling in transduction of a biological response to ICPP was demonstrated using VTKI, an antagonist that can selectively inhibit the kinase activity associated with VEGF-R2 and VEGF-R1. This inhibitor ablates fully ICPP- and VEGF-induced MAPK activation (IC50 of ∼100 nmversus both) but does not affect that induced by FGF-2. The specificity of VTKI has been further demonstrated in ER22 cells, where it was found to not affect PDGF-, EGF-, or FGF-2-mediated MAPK activation at a concentration of 30 μm. Furthermore, VTKI did not inhibit the MAP kinase activation in response to the G protein-coupled receptor agonist, α-thrombin, or fetal calf serum.When the mitogenic action of ICPP was studied, it was found to be as potent if not slightly more potent than VEGF165 at reinitiating DNA synthesis in HUVEC. This ICPP-induced response was fully suppressed by VTKI. In addition, we have observed that ICPP promotes DNA proliferation in HUVEC and induces growth and differentiation of mouse embryonic endothelial cells. VTKI can also inhibit these ICPP-induced angiogenic and permeability responses, indicating an involvement of VEGF receptor signaling. In each biological response examined, ICPP was found to possess remarkably similar and at least three times more potent bioactivity than VEGF165 despite the absence of a heparin binding domain. The structural differences between ICPP and VEGF, in particular the absence in ICPP of heparin binding domains and consensusN-glycosylation sites, suggest that some of their biological activities might be different.In conclusion, we have shown that the amino acid sequence of ICPP displays a high similarity to that of VEGF and that capillary permeability, angiogenesis, endothelial cell mitogenicity, and MAP kinase activation induced by ICPP were mediated through VEGF receptor signaling. These findings provide the first evidence that ICPP is a novel member of the family of VEGF-like growth factors. Moreover, considering the therapeutic impact of VEGF-A in the treatment of coronary heart disease or critical limb ischemia (38Waltenberger J. Circulation. 1997; 96: 4083-4094Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 39Folkman J. Circulation. 1998; 97: 1108-1110Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), ICPP, which appears more potent than VEGF, may represent a novel candidate for therapeutic angiogenic approaches aimed at growing new vasculature. Angiogenesis is a tightly regulated process occurring physiologically during embryonic development, during the menstrual cycle, and in wound healing. It is also associated with a number of pathological situations including diabetic retinopathy, inflammation, brain edema following ischemic stroke, solid tumor growth, and metastasis.

Gale N.W. Rudge J.S. Wiegand S.J. Holash J. Nature. 2000; 407: 242-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (3253) Google Scholar). VEGFR-2, however, via activation of intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity, appears to mediate all the major actions of VEGF: capillary permeability, chemotaxis, cell survival, and cell division (8Matsumoto T. Claesson-Welsh L. Sci. STKE. 2001. 2001; 112: RE21www.stke.sciencemag.orgGoogle Scholar). The possibility that vascular growth factors may help prevent or repair damaged and leaky vessels offers therapeutic hope for ischemic diseases, diabetic retinopathy, or inflammatory setting (9Ferrara N. Alitalo K. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 1359-1364Crossref PubMed Scopus (908) Google Scholar, 10Thurston G. Rudge J.S. Ioffe E. Zhou H. Ross L. Croll S.D. Glazer N. Holash J. McDonald D.M. Yancopoulos G.D. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 460-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (1078) Google Scholar). In opposition, new antitumoral approaches targeting the tumor vasculature via inhibition of VEGF signaling are actively being developed; they include neutralizing anti-VEGF antibodies, anti-VEGF receptor antibodies, soluble VEGF receptors, antisense VEGF techniques, and VEGF receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (11Gasparini G. Harris A.L. J. Clin. Oncol. 1995; 13: 765-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). We have previously isolated a protein from Vipera lebetinavenom based on its potent ability to increase capillary permeability. The partial sequence of this protein, referred to as increasing capillary permeability protein (ICPP), revealed a VEGF-like structure (12Gasmi A. Abidi F. Srairi N. Oijatayer A. Karoui H. Elayeb M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 268: 69-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In this report, we present the complete amino acid sequence of ICPP and demonstrate that this venom related-VEGF is capable of inducing p42/p44 MAPK activity and DNA synthesis in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) and of promoting in vitro angiogenesis. Interestingly, all these ICPP-induced biological actions are fully inhibited by a new VEGF receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor, as presented here. DISCUSSIONSnake venoms represent an extraordinary source of biological molecules that have been invaluable to our knowledge and understanding of basic biological processes. Besides the toxins acting directly in the nervous system, many venom proteins target blood capillaries, preventing blood coagulation via disintegrins and enzymes degrading fibrinogens, whereas others increase the permeability of blood capillaries. This is the case for bradykinin potentiating factors purified from B. jararaca that convert angiotensin I into angiotensin II and phospholipase A2 purified fromTrimeresurus mucrosquamatus, which induces release of histamine from mast cell degranulation (32Markland F.S. Toxicon. 1998; 36: 1749-1800Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar). In this context, it is remarkable to see the emergence of a new set of selected molecules with permeability capacity in snake venoms. ICPP, an increasing capillary permeability protein of V. lebetinavenom, is indeed a VEGF-related molecule highly homologous to the HF with vascular permeability activity (23Komori Y. Nikai T. Taniguchi T. Masuda K. Sugihara H. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 11769-11803Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar). During the preparation of this manuscript, another report demonstrated the expression of related VEGF molecules in the venom of Bothrops jararaca (pit viper) (24Junqueira de Azevedo I.L. Farsky S.H. Oliveira M.L. Ho P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39836-39842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), a result extending the notion that many snakes have evolved to specifically express in their venoms VEGF-like molecules, the most potent permeability factors described so far in vertebrates. During evolution, the co-selection in snake venoms of potent toxins together with the most effective permeability factors was certainly crucial for rapid dissemination of the toxins in the general circulation of the prey.In the present study, we determined the complete amino acid sequence of ICPP, confirming that it is structurally related to the PDGF family. This protein consists of two homodimers of 110 amino acids having a molecular mass of 25115 Da. ICPP shares the highest sequence identity with HF, the hypotensive factor purified from V. aspis aspis(23Komori Y. Nikai T. Taniguchi T. Masuda K. Sugihara H. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 11769-11803Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar), and the recently identified svVEGF from B. insularispit viper venom (24Junqueira de Azevedo I.L. Farsky S.H. Oliveira M.L. Ho P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39836-39842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). ICPP, together with the other snake svVEGFs, shares about 50% identity with human VEGF-A (22Leung D.W. Cachiane G. Kuang W.J. Goddel D.V. Ferrara N. Science. 1989; 246: 1306-1309Crossref PubMed Scopus (4413) Google Scholar). ICPP, like HF and svVEGF, differs in length from VEGF165, lacking a heparin binding domain and a potential N-linked glycosylation site. The recombinant protein svVEGF from the B. insularis pit viper was biologically characterized only by its ability to increase vascular permeability (24Junqueira de Azevedo I.L. Farsky S.H. Oliveira M.L. Ho P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39836-39842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). However, in addition to increasing permeability, HF has been shown to also exert a strong hypotensive effect and have a mitogenic effect on endothelial cells. The mitogenic activity of HF was 5–10 times lower than that of VEGF and was inhibited by cycloheximide. The authors speculated that this protein may induce a signaling response and increase protein synthesis in endothelial cells, but studies examining the mechanism of action have not been reported (23Komori Y. Nikai T. Taniguchi T. Masuda K. Sugihara H. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 11769-11803Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar).VEGF functions by interacting with two well characterized high affinity tyrosine kinase receptors, VEGF-R1 and VEGF-R2, that are selectively expressed on endothelium. VEGF-R2 appears to be the dominant signaling receptor in VEGF- induced mitogenesis, and permeability increases (33Waltenberger J. Claesson-Welsh L. Siegbahn A. Shibuya M. Heldin C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26988-26995Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Korpelainen E.I. Alitalo K. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 159-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar), whereas the role of VEGF-R1 in endothelial cell function is much less clear. Recent findings suggest that VEGF-R1 may have a negative role, either by acting as a decoy receptor or by suppressing signaling through VEGF-R2 (35Rahimi N. Dayanir V. Lashkari K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16986-16992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar).Plasmin cleavage of VEGF165 generates a 110-residue long N-terminal fragment (VEGF110) that lacks the heparin binding domains. VEGF110 is thought to maintain the ability to bind to the VEGF receptors, but its endothelial cell mitogenic potency is decreased substantially (100-fold) relative to VEGF165, indicating that the heparin binding domains are critical for stimulating endothelial cell proliferation (36Keyt B.A. Berleau L.T. Nguyen H.V. Chen H. Heinsohn H. Vendleu R. Ferrara N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7788-7795Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar). This finding also concurs with experiments using VEGF121, which does not bind to either heparan sulfates or to the extracellular matrix. VEGF121 has been described as being 10–100-fold less potent than VEGF165 at inducing biological responses in endothelial cells (37Ogawa S. Oku A. Sawano A. Yamaguchi S. Yazaki Y. Shibuya M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31273-31282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). The effect of glycosylation of VEGF165 on receptor binding has also been studied by Keyt et al. (25Keyt B.A. Nguyen H.V. Berleau L.T. Ouarta C.M. Park J. Chen H. Ferrara N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5638-5646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar) using a constructed unglycosylated form of VEGF. They showed that N-linked carbohydrate at Asn-75 does not appear to have an effect in mediating VEGF receptor binding and the precise role of glycosylation remains to be elucidated.ICPP and VEGF165 were tested in parallel in various bioassays including MAP kinase activation, in vitro angiogenesis, and capillary permeability. In this regard, our studies have shown that ICPP, like VEGF165 and FGF-2, stimulates p42/p44 MAP kinases in HUVEC. The activity of ICPP was found to be at least 1.5 times more potent than human recombinant VEGF165 and mediated via signaling through endogenous VEGF receptors. The requirement for VEGF receptor signaling in transduction of a biological response to ICPP was demonstrated using VTKI, an antagonist that can selectively inhibit the kinase activity associated with VEGF-R2 and VEGF-R1. This inhibitor ablates fully ICPP- and VEGF-induced MAPK activation (IC50 of ∼100 nmversus both) but does not affect that induced by FGF-2. The specificity of VTKI has been further demonstrated in ER22 cells, where it was found to not affect PDGF-, EGF-, or FGF-2-mediated MAPK activation at a concentration of 30 μm. Furthermore, VTKI did not inhibit the MAP kinase activation in response to the G protein-coupled receptor agonist, α-thrombin, or fetal calf serum.When the mitogenic action of ICPP was studied, it was found to be as potent if not slightly more potent than VEGF165 at reinitiating DNA synthesis in HUVEC. This ICPP-induced response was fully suppressed by VTKI. In addition, we have observed that ICPP promotes DNA proliferation in HUVEC and induces growth and differentiation of mouse embryonic endothelial cells. VTKI can also inhibit these ICPP-induced angiogenic and permeability responses, indicating an involvement of VEGF receptor signaling. In each biological response examined, ICPP was found to possess remarkably similar and at least three times more potent bioactivity than VEGF165 despite the absence of a heparin binding domain. The structural differences between ICPP and VEGF, in particular the absence in ICPP of heparin binding domains and consensusN-glycosylation sites, suggest that some of their biological activities might be different.In conclusion, we have shown that the amino acid sequence of ICPP displays a high similarity to that of VEGF and that capillary permeability, angiogenesis, endothelial cell mitogenicity, and MAP kinase activation induced by ICPP were mediated through VEGF receptor signaling. These findings provide the first evidence that ICPP is a novel member of the family of VEGF-like growth factors. Moreover, considering the therapeutic impact of VEGF-A in the treatment of coronary heart disease or critical limb ischemia (38Waltenberger J. Circulation. 1997; 96: 4083-4094Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 39Folkman J. Circulation. 1998; 97: 1108-1110Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), ICPP, which appears more potent than VEGF, may represent a novel candidate for therapeutic angiogenic approaches aimed at growing new vasculature.

To remove RNA left after polymerization, the RT aligns to cut 18 nucleotides in from the 5′ RNA end. The enzyme then repositions, making a secondary cut 8 nucleotides from the RNA 5′ end. Transfer of the minus strong stop DNA during viral replication requires cleavage of template RNA. Removal of the terminal RNA segment is a special case because the RNA-DNA hybrid forms a blunt end, shown previously to resist cleavage when tested in vitro. We show here that the structure of the substrate extending beyond the RNA 5′ end is an important determinant of cleavage efficiency. A short single-stranded DNA extension greatly stimulated the secondary cleavage. Annealing an RNA segment to the DNA extension was even more stimulatory. Recessing the DNA from a blunt end by even one nucleotide caused the RT to reorient its binding, preventing secondary cleavage. The presence of the cap at the 5′ end of the viral RNA did not improve the efficiency of secondary cleavage. However, NC protein greatly facilitated the secondary cut on the blunt-ended substrate, suggesting that NC compensates for the unfavorable substrate structure.

This multi-functional enzyme has RNA- and DNA-dependent DNA polymerase, strand displacement, strand transfer, and RNase H activities. The RNase H activity degrades the RNA genome during and after synthesis of the first or minus DNA strand (1Champoux J.J. Skalka A.M. Goff S.P. Reverse Transcriptase.

The RNase H is used to clear the new minus DNA strand of the genomic RNA fragments, in preparation for minus-strand transfer and synthesis of the plus DNA strand. RNase H activity is also required for the generation of the polypurine tract primers that initiate plus-strand synthesis, and for the removal of the minus- and plus-strand primers (Refs. 1Champoux J.J.

The structure of the RNase H subdomain of HIV-1 RT resembles that of Escherichia coli RNase H except that RT lacks the helix C motif, which in E. coli RNase H is important for binding substrate (17Katayanagi K.

The RNase H subdomain expressed independently is inactive since it cannot bind the RNA/DNA hybrid without the thumb and connection domains (19Smith J.S. Roth M.J. J.

During minus-strand synthesis, RT is positioned on the substrate with its polymerase active site at the 3′ terminus of the DNA primer. This places the RNase H active site 18 nt away on the RNA template (21Levin J.G. Crouch R.J. Post K. Hu S.C. McKelvin D. Zweig M. Court D.L. Gerwin B.I. J.

Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 5343-5356Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), allowing RT to make endonucleolytic cuts within the RNA as the RNA/DNA substrate is created. This is the polymerase-dependent mode of RNase H cleavage (6Gopalakrishnan V. Peliska J.A. Benkovic S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The RNase H activity is not strictly coupled with the polymerase function. It is distributive, periodically cleaving the RNA to leave fragments (24DeStefano J.J. Mallaber L.M. Fay P.J. Bambara R.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 3793-3800Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Because a virus contains 50–100 copies of RT and only two RTs can be involved in synthesis at any given time, the residual RTs are available to rebind and degrade the fragmented genome. This mode of cleavage is referred to as the polymerase-independent RNase H and occurs in the absence of synthesis. We have previously characterized the polymerase-independent RNase H activity (25DeStefano J.J. Mallaber L.M. Fay P.J. Bambara R.A.

Although the orientation of RT on the RNA/DNA hybrid is the same as during polymerization, the recessed 5′ end of the RNA fragment directs the positioning (Fig.1). Binding of RT to the RNA/DNA duplex at the RNA fragment 5′ end places the RNase H active site 18 nt into the RNA, where the enzyme makes a primary cut. RT then positions 8–9 nt toward the 5′ end of the RNA to make an 8–9-nt secondary product or backward to the 3′ end of the RNA, creating a 5-nt product (27Wisniewski M. Balakrishnan M. Palaniappan C.

Ultimately the RNA is degraded into small fragments that dissociate or are displaced during plus-strand synthesis. Interestingly, the primary, secondary, and 5-nt cuts are independent of each other, each with a characteristic rate (27Wisniewski M. Balakrishnan M. Palaniappan C. Fay P.J. Bambara R.A. J. Biol.

Blunt end substrates in which the RNA 5′ end and the DNA 3′ end are flush display a diminished rate of secondary cleavage compared with substrates in which the RNA segment is recessed on the DNA (6Gopalakrishnan V.

Science. 1992; 258: 1112-1118Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). These results suggest that RT requires a 3′ DNA extension to bind appropriately for secondary cleavage. Significantly, a blunt end intermediate is created during reverse transcription, when RT synthesizes to the 5′ end of the RNA genome to create the minus strong stop DNA. Presumably the virus has evolved a mechanism to effectively remove this RNA. Previous work suggests a role for the viral nucleocapsid (NC) protein in degradation of blunt-ended RNA-DNA hybrids. Peliska et al. (32Peliska J.A. Balasubramanian S. Giedroc D.P. Benkovic S.J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 13817-13823Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) demonstrate that the presence of NC enhanced the rate of cleavage of the 5′-terminal RNA segment of a blunt-ended RNA-DNA hybrid. They proposed that NC interacts with RT to tether the enzyme to the substrate for more effective cleavage. Although these studies were done before our understanding of primary and secondary cuts, they are useful in providing insights into RNase H mechanism. We were therefore interested in reexamining secondary cuts and the effects of NC using the authentic 5′ end sequence of the genome. Here we have examined structural features of the substrate that are required to create RT RNase H secondary cuts. We determined how different lengths of 3′ DNA and 5′ RNA overhangs compared with blunt-ended hybrid influence the rate of the secondary cut. These results show the region of the substrate that is important for contact with the RT during secondary cleavage. Furthermore, we have determined the rate of secondary cleavage on the natural blunt-ended substrate, which contains a m7Gppp cap. Results show that the presence of the cap does not facilitate secondary cleavages at the blunt end. Nucleocapsid (NC), however, enhances the overall efficiency of RT RNase H cuts on blunt-ended substrates while specifically increasing secondary cut efficiency.

NC stocks were resuspended in NC dilution buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and 5 mm dithiothreitol and stored in 5–10-μl aliquots at −80 °C until use. For RNase H assays done in the presence of NC, the protein was added (3.5 nt/NC) to the reaction and incubated at 37 °C for 5 min before the addition of RT. For control reactions without NC, an equal volume of NC dilution buffer was added instead. All RNAs were generated by in vitro run-off transcription using the Ambion T7-MEGAshortscript kit (Austin, TX) as per the manufacturer's protocol. The 41-nt RNA was generated from AccI-linearized pBSM13+ plasmid as previously described (26Palaniappan C. Fuentes G.M. Rodriguez-Rodriguez L. Fay P.J. Bambara R.A. J. Biol.

All RNAs used in the study were PAGE-purified and resuspended in 10 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA buffer (pH 8.0). RNAs were quantitated by using Ribogreen assay supplied by Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). To generate hybrid substrates, the labeled RNA was annealed to the appropriate DNA template at a ratio of 1:3 in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 80 mm KCl, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. Components were mixed, heated to 95 °C for 5 min, and slow cooled to room temperature. Reactions were performed as described previously (26Palaniappan C. Fuentes G.M. Rodriguez-Rodriguez L. Fay P.J. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2063-2070Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Briefly, reactions contained 50 mmTris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1.0 mmEDTA, 34 mm KCl, 4 nm substrate, and 32 nm HIV-1 RT. The reaction mixture was incubated for 2 min at 37 °C to allow prebinding of RT to substrate. Reactions were then started by the addition of the MgCl2 at 6 mmfinal concentration and incubated at 37 °C. Reactions were terminated at the appropriate time with a 2× termination dye (10 mm EDTA (pH 8.0), 90% formamide (v/v), and 0.1% xylene cyanol and bromphenol blue). Control reactions did not contain RT and were incubated at 37 °C for a period equaling the longest experimental time point. RNA ladders were created by base hydrolysis and RNase T1 digestion. Samples were subjected to 10% (15% for 28-nt RNA) denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, visualized using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager, and analyzed using ImageQuant software (version 1.2). Synthesis of minus-strand DNA to the 5′ end of the RNA template results in a blunt-ended substrate in which the DNA 3′ end is flush with the RNA 5′ end. Previously studies show that RNase H cleavage at such blunt ends is very inefficient (27Wisniewski M. Balakrishnan M. Palaniappan C. Fay P.J. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37664-37671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that the inefficiency in processing the 5′-most RNA segment is because the blunt end RNA-DNA substrate lacks structural features needed for positioning of the enzyme for secondary cuts. We therefore set out to define the necessary structure requirements and to determine whether the other reaction components present in vivo compensate for the missing structures. We have previously shown that a blunt end substrate in which the RNA 5′ end flush with the DNA 3′ end sustains a particularly slow secondary cleavage compared with an RNA that is recessed on the DNA template (27Wisniewski M. Balakrishnan M. Palaniappan C. Fay P.J. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37664-37671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Because this suggested that the DNA 3′ extension stimulates secondary cleavage, we proposed to determine the minimum length of extension necessary to affect the cleavage (Fig.2, D–G). Substrates with 3′ end DNA extensions of 1, 3, 5, or 7 nt were generated by annealing the 5′ end-labeled 41-nt RNA to a 51, 53, 55, or 57-nt DNA template (Fig.2 A, substrates 3, 4, 5, and6). The recessed (Fig. 2 A, substrate1) and blunt end substrates (Fig. 2 A, substrate2) were used as controls. These substrates contained a 41-nt RNA annealed to a 77-nt DNA to create the recessed substrate in which the DNA 3′ end extends 21 nt beyond the RNA 5′ end or to a 50-nt DNA to produce a substrate with the DNA 3′ terminus flush with the RNA 5′ end. Equal amounts of each substrate were subjected to RNase H cleavage. As previously shown (27Wisniewski M. Balakrishnan M. Palaniappan C. Fay P.J. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37664-37671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 28Wisniewski M. Balakrishnan M. Palaniappan C. Fay P.J. Bambara R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 11978-11983Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), the control substrate having the 21-nt 3′ DNA extension sustained an efficient secondary cut (Fig.2 B). The 8-nucleotide secondary product appeared within 15 s and became the major labeled product over the measured time course. The primary product is created more rapidly (28Wisniewski M. Balakrishnan M. Palaniappan C. Fay P.J. Bambara R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 11978-11983Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) but did not accumulate to a high level in this experiment because this 18-nt fragment was processed efficiently into the secondary product. The 15-nt product was observed as a minor product, as shown before (27Wisniewski M. Balakrishnan M. Palaniappan C. Fay P.J. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37664-37671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar,28Wisniewski M. Balakrishnan M. Palaniappan C. Fay P.J. Bambara R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 11978-11983Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). By 16 min the majority of the 41-nt RNA was cleaved into the secondary product. In comparing cleavage patterns, processing of the blunt-ended substrate over time was distinctly different, although the same size products were generated: the 18-nt primary, 8-nt secondary, and the 15-nt product (Fig. 2 C). As previously shown (27Wisniewski M. Balakrishnan M. Palaniappan C. Fay P.J. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37664-37671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), although the 18-nt product was efficiently formed, it was poorly processed to the 8-nt secondary product. Instead some accumulation of the 15-nt product was observed with time. Unlike with the recessed substrate, the secondary cut product with the blunt end substrate appeared in detectable quantities only by 2 min and accumulated at a slower rate. A reasonable explanation is that the RT cannot move readily on the blunt end substrate to the appropriate position for the secondary cleavage. Instead, most enzymes move 3 nt to make the 15-nt product. Over a longer time course, enzymes ultimately make the secondary product. When the template had a 1-nt DNA 3′ extension, the overall cleavage product profile was similar to that of the blunt end substrate (compare Fig. 2 D to Fig. 2 C). The secondary cut was inefficient and not detectable until 2 min. At 16 min, the amount of 8-nt product formed was only 25% of that observed with the 21-nt overhang substrate. Extending the overhang to 3 nt noticeably enhanced the efficiency of the secondary cut (Fig. 2 E). Here the 8-nt secondary product was detectable at the 1-min time point, a 2× faster rate than observed with the blunt end and 1-nt DNA overhang substrates. At 16 min, the secondary cut was about 40% of that observed with the 21-nt overhang substrate (compare Fig. 2 E to Fig.2 C). Increasing the overhang to 5 and 7 nt further enhanced the secondary cut efficiency (compare Fig. 2, F and2 G, to Fig. 2 C). The 8-nt product was detectable as early as 15 s and was about 50% of that formed by the 21-nt overhang substrate at 16 min. Although the cleavage efficiency was enhanced, it was still not as high as that observed with the 21-nt overhang (Fig. 2 B). Because DNA 5′ overhangs do not affect primary and secondary cleavages at the RNA 5′ end (data not shown), differences in this region of the substrate could not explain the low efficiency of secondary cuts observed on substrates 2–6. Clearly the process of cleavage enhancement is gradual with the length of extension, suggesting that the longer 3′ DNA extensions allow for the most optimal contacts with RT that are relevant to the secondary cut. Because reduced 3′ DNA extension inhibited secondary cleavage, we determined the effect of continuing this structural change beyond the blunt configuration into what might be considered a negative DNA extension (Fig. 3). RT normally encounters such a substrate configuration during minus-strand synthesis, where the extending primer terminus is recessed on the RNA template. To test the effect of RNA 5′ overhangs on secondary cleavages, the 5′ end-labeled 41-nt RNA was annealed to a 49-, 45-, 43-, or 41-nt DNA template to create hybrid substrates with 1-, 5-, 7-, or 9-nt 5′ RNA single-strand extensions. The configuration at the RNA 3′/DNA 5′ end was kept the same for these substrates (Fig.3 A, substrates 7, 8, 9, and 10). Equal amounts of each substrate were subjected to RNase H, and the profiles of cleavage products were compared with that of the blunt end hybrid substrate (compare Figs. 3, B–E, to Fig. 2 C). Surprisingly, a 1-nucleotide RNA 5′ extension eliminated the 8-nt product (Fig. 3 B). The 15-nt product was still produced but with noticeably lower efficiency. More interestingly, efficiency of the 18-nt primary product formation was also reduced, with the product accumulating only at the later time points. Instead, a 19-nt product was generated with high efficiency, suggesting that on this substrate most RTs use the DNA 3′ end rather than the RNA 5′ end for initial alignment. The 19-nt product was then the result of a primary cleavage in the polymerization-dependent binding mode for RNase H cleavage. As the RNA 5′ end extension was further increased, the products of cleavage were consistent with DNA 3′ end-directed alignment of the RT (Fig. 3). The 18-nt product, expected from RNA 5′ end alignment, was very minor, suggesting that binding to generate this cut is unstable. The 15-nt product also was formed with less efficiency as the RNA overhang length increased. RNase H cleavages on the 3- and 5-nt RNA overhang substrates produced 21- and 23-nt primary cleavage products that accumulated with time, expected from 3′ DNA end positioning (Fig.3 C and data not shown). As with the 1-nt overhang substrate, very few of these products sustained secondary cuts, suggesting that short RNA 5′ overhangs restrict the realignment of RT for efficient secondary cleavage. The 7- and 9-nt RNA 5′ extension substrates produced the 25- and 27-nt products expected from RT alignment with the DNA 3′ end (Figs. 3, D and E). Although trace amounts of the 15-nt product were observed at the later time points with the 7-nt RNA extension substrate (Fig. 3 D), this product was almost undetectable with the 9-nt extension (Fig.3 E). In contrast to the situation with 1-, 3-, and 5-nt overhang substrates, the DNA 3′-directed primary cleavage products decreased with time. Specifically, the 25- and 27-nt primary cleavage products were further processed into smaller fragments. We interpret the major 18–19-nt product as the result of a secondary cut. Overall, the results show that the polymerization-directed binding orientation predominated on substrates with recessed DNA 3′ ends. Primary cleavage products from this binding orientation were efficiently formed with all of the overhang substrates. However, subsequent secondary and smaller cleavages were facilitated only in the presence of overhangs of 7 nt and longer. This suggests that RT can utilize an RNA overhang of 7 nt or longer to position for secondary cleavages. We anticipated that the RT would have evolved to efficiently cleave adjacent RNA segments annealed to a DNA, since these substrate are structures likely to be formed during polymerization of the minus DNA strand. To make such a substrate, we annealed an 18-nt RNA oligomer immediately 5′ of the RNA in the 77-nt DNA/41-nt RNA substrate employed above (Fig. 3 A, substrate11). The 41-nt downstream RNA was 5′ end-labeled, allowing us to assess its cleavage efficiency in the context of an upstream RNA-DNA hybrid region. Fig. 4 shows that the expected 18- and 8-nt products appeared over time. Depletion of the starting substrate and appearance of secondary cleavage products was distinctly faster than in the absence of the upstream RNA primer (compare with Fig. 2 B). Other interesting products were also observed. In the absence of the upstream RNA primer, the major secondary product was 8 nt in length (Fig. 2 B). The 7- and 9-nt products occurred to a much lesser extent than the 8-nt product. When an RNA oligomer was annealed upstream of the 41-nt RNA (Fig. 4), products shorter than 8 nt appeared and accumulated. These might be made directly or result from additional cleavage of the 8-nt product. A reasonable explanation is that the double-stranded hybrid is a particularly good substrate for RT binding compared with the DNA single strand extension. This allowed RT to stably translocate even further from the primary cut site and to make very short products. As discussed earlier, synthesis of the minus-strand strong stop DNA results in the formation of a blunt-ended hybrid substra"

The essential role of GATA factors in the development of hematopoietic lineage was first established by the fact that the functionally important GATA motifs were identified in virtually all erythroid-specific genes (14Orkin S.H. Blood. 1992; 80: 575-581Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Weiss M.J. Orkin S.H. Exp. Hematol. 1995; 23: 99-107PubMed Google Scholar). Further characterization of the GATA-1 and GATA-2-null embryonic stem cells through targeted gene disruption reconfirmed their essential role in hematopoietic differentiation phenotype (16Pevny L. Simon M.C. Robertson E. Klein W.H. Tsai S.F. D'Agati V. Orkin S.H. Costantini F. Nature. 1991; 349: 257-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (1028) Google Scholar, 17Tsai F.Y. Keller G. Kuo F.C. Weiss M. Chen J. Rosenblatt M. Alt F.W. Orkin S.H. Nature. 1994; 371: 221-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (1171) Google Scholar). However, these studies also revealed that GATA-1 and GATA-2 were essential to support the viability of red cell precursors and early progenitors, respectively, by suppressing apoptosis (16Pevny L. Simon M.C. Robertson E. Klein W.H. Tsai S.F. D'Agati V. Orkin S.H. Costantini F. Nature. 1991; 349: 257-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (1028) Google Scholar, 17Tsai F.Y. Keller G. Kuo F.C. Weiss M. Chen J. Rosenblatt M. Alt F.W. Orkin S.H. Nature. 1994; 371: 221-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (1171) Google Scholar). Although several GATA-binding motif-containing genes, including erythropoietin receptor, SCL/tal-1, and the cytosolic glutathione peroxidase genes, possess anti-apoptotic activity, their expression appears to be unaffected in GATA-1-deficient proerythroblasts (18Weiss M.J. Keller G. Orkin S.H. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1184-1197Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). Therefore, the direct anti-apoptotic target(s) of GATA-1 in proerythroblasts remains elusive. The E4BP4 (adenovirus E4 promoter-binding protein) protein was initially identified by its ability to recognize and repress the adenovirus E4 promoter (19Cowell I.G. Skinner A. Hurst H.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3070-3077Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 20Cowell I.G. Hurst H.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 59-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) and was subsequently identified as NF-IL3A in T cells to be capable of binding and activating the human IL-31 promoter (21Zhang W. Zhang J. Kornuc M. Kwan K. Frank R. Nimer S.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6055-6063Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). E4BP4 is a protein of 462 amino acids and is a member of the basic region/leucine zipper transcription factor superfamily (19Cowell I.G. Skinner A. Hurst H.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3070-3077Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). The basic region/leucine zipper domain in E4BP4 is highly related to the basic region/leucine zipper domains of Caenorhabditis elegans cell death specification protein CES-2 (22Metzstein M.M. Hengartner M.O. Tsung N. Ellis R.E. Horvitz H.R. Nature. 1996; 382: 545-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia oncoprotein E2A-HLF (23Hunger S.P. Ohyashiki K. Toyama K. Cleary M.L. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 1608-1620Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 24Inaba T. Roberts W.M. Shapiro L.H. Jolly K.W. Raimondi S.C. Smith S.D. Look A.T. Science. 1992; 257: 531-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). The consensus E4BP4-binding DNA sequence, i.e. (G/A)T(G/T)A(C/T)GTAA(C/T) (19Cowell I.G. Skinner A. Hurst H.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3070-3077Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), is also similar to the consensus binding sequences for CES-2 and E2A-HLF proteins (22Metzstein M.M. Hengartner M.O. Tsung N. Ellis R.E. Horvitz H.R. Nature. 1996; 382: 545-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Because both CES-2 and E2A-HLF were involved in cell death regulation, it was predicted that E4BP4 might be related to death control in hematopoietic cells. Further experiments indeed demonstrated that this is the case. In an IL-3-dependent pro-B cell line, Ba/F3, E4bp4 expression was activated by the IL-3 signaling pathway, and enforced expression of E4BP4 delayed apoptosis caused by IL-3 deprivation without promoting cell division (25Ikushima S. Inukai T. Inaba T. Nimer S.D. Cleveland J.L. Look A.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2609-2614Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Furthermore, overexpression of the dominant-negative form of E4BP4 attenuated the survival response of IL-3 (26Kuribara R. Kinoshita T. Miyajima A. Shinjyo T. Yoshihara T. Inukai T. Ozawa K. Look A.T. Inaba T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2754-2762Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). These findings clearly suggest that E4bp4 is one component of the transcription network that contributes to the survival activity of IL-3. In this study, we tried to determine the mechanism responsible for IL-3 induction of the survival gene E4bp4. We have demonstrated that IL-3 activation of the E4bp4 gene is regulated at the transcriptional level. Through promoter analysis we identified that a GATA motif downstream of a major transcription initiation site is essential for E4bp4 expression in the IL-3-dependent Ba/F3 cell line. We also demonstrated that GATA-binding factors, most likely GATA-1 and GATA-2, play an important role in the transcriptional activation of E4bp4 and are involved in the anti-apoptotic signaling of IL-3. Murine IL-3-dependent pro-B cell line Ba/F3 was maintained in medium containing murine IL-3, as described previously (27Lee S.F. Huang H.M. Chao J.R. Lin S. Yang-Yen H.F. Yen J.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7399-7409Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For restimulation experiments, 100 units/ml of recombinant IL-3 (R & D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) was added back to cells that had been previously cultivated in low serum medium containing no cytokine. For culturing Ba/F3 derivatives stably overexpressing GATA factors, the regular growth medium supplemented with 200 μg/ml of G418 was used. Bone marrow-derived IL-3-dependent primary cells were isolated and cultured as described previously by Rodriguez-Tarduchy et al.(28Rodriguez-Tarduchy G. Collins M. Lopez-Rivas A. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2997-3002Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Total cellular RNA was isolated from Ba/F3 cells and bone marrow-derived IL-3-dependent primary cells with the Trizol reagent kit (Invitrogen) according to a procedure recommended by the manufacturer. Equal amounts of total RNA (30 μg) from each treatment were then subjected to the standard Northern blot analysis using probes specific to the E4bp4 or the G3pdh(glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase) gene. Specific signals on the Northern blot were quantified either with Instant Imager (Packard Instrument Co., Meriden, CT) or with a densitometer (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). A nuclear run-on assay to determine the rate of transcription of the E4bp4 gene was performed essentially as described (29Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001: 17.23-17.29Google Scholar), with nuclei prepared as described by Dignam et al. (30Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9132) Google Scholar). The murine E4bp45′-flanking region was obtained by PCR amplification of a murine genomic library (Genome Walker kits; CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) using two sets of nested primers as recommended by the manufacturer. One set of the nested primers contains sequences complementary to the flanking adaptors and was provided by the vendor. The other set of the nested primers with the following sequences was designed according to the coding sequence of E4bp4: E1 primer, 5′-GCCACCTCAGCTAAGGCAGAGTTCAGC-3′, and E2 primer, 5′-AGCATCTTGTCTGAGCTGCTGGTAGGA-3′. The sequencing of this DNA fragment confirmed that it contains 1,139 bp of the 5′-flanking sequence (GenBankTM accession number AF512511) and the first 77 bp of the open reading frame of the murine E4bp4cDNA. The transcriptional initiation site of the E4bp4 gene was determined by both primer extension analysis and S1 nuclease protection as described (29Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001: 17.23-17.29Google Scholar). The PE1 primer (5′-AGACCGGATGGAGGAGACAAATCACTTCCCCAGTCTTC-3′; see also Fig.2A) was used both for the primer extension as well as for the sequencing reaction. For the S1 nuclease protection assay, a32P-labeled single-stranded DNA probe spanning the region between −274 and −24 (see Fig. 2A) was used to form a specific DNA-RNA hybrid prior to being digested with nuclease S1. This probe was synthesized with the 32P-labeled PE1 primer and the denatured plasmid DNA template p(−1139/+1) e4bp4-luc (see below) using a procedure essentially as described in Ref. 29Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001: 17.23-17.29Google Scholar. The 1140-bp DNA fragment of theE4bp4 gene spanning the region between −1139 and +1 (relative to the translational start site) was subcloned into theSmaI and HindIII sites of a promoter-less luciferase reporter vector pGL2-basic (Promega, Madison, WI) to generate the reporter construct p(−1139/+1) e4bp4-luc. The reporter constructs of p(−821/+1)e4bp4-luc, p(−451/+1)e4bp4-luc, p(−205/+1)e4bp4-luc, and p(−1139/-205)e4bp4-luc were generated by isolating corresponding inserts from p(−1139/+1)e4bp4-luc via digestion with appropriate restriction enzymes and subcloning them into the SmaI/HindIII orSmaI/NheI sites of pGL2-basic. The reporter plasmids of p(−194/+1)e4bp4-luc, p(−166/+1)e4bp4-luc, p(−135/+1)e4bp4-luc, and p(−205/-138)e4bp4-luc were generated by PCR synthesizing the corresponding fragments with an appropriate pair of primers as described below and subsequently cloning these PCR fragments into the multiple cloning sites of the pGL-2-basic vector. The 5′ primers for making these constructs are as follows: mE4P5(−194)NheI (5′-GCTAGCTGCCCAAGGGACTCACTG-3′), mE4P5(−166)NheI (5′-GCTAGCTTTATTGCAGATAACCCA-3′), mE4P5(−135)NheI (5′-GCTAGCGACAGATTTACCCTGTGC-3′), and mE4P5(−205)NheI (5′-GCTAGCACACAGCTGCCCAAGGGA-3′). The 3′ primer for the first three constructs is mE4P3(+1)HindIII (5′-AAGCTTCAGAAAGGACCTCCTCGT-3′), and the 3′ primer for the last construct is mE4P3(−138) BglII (5′-AGATCTGAGCCTTTCATGGGTTAT-3′). Plasmids p(−205/+1mE) e4bp4-luc, p(−205/+1mG)e4bp4-luc, and p(−205/+1mEmG)e4bp4-luc were derived from p(−205/+1)e4bp4-luc by PCR-assisted, site-directed mutagenesis of each individual sequence element as indicated in the schemes shown in Fig.4A. Plasmid p(−1139/+1mG)e4bp4-luc was generated by replacing the region between −205 and +1 of p(−1139/+1)e4bp4-luc with a corresponding fragment from p(−205/+1mG)e4bp4-luc. All of the constructs generated via methods involving the PCR step were confirmed by sequencing. Ba/F3 cells were transiently transfected with plasmids by electroporation using a Bio-Rad Gene Pulser II RF module system and assayed for luciferase activity as described previously (31Chen W., Yu, Y.L. Lee S.F. Chiang Y.J. Chao J.R. Huang J.H. Chiong J.H. Huang C.J. Lai M.Z. Yang-Yen H.F. Yen J.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4636-4646Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). To analyze the effect of the dominant-negative mutant of GATA-1 in the reporter gene assays, the electroporated cells were recovered in mIL-3-containing medium for 12 h and then deprived of mIL-3 for 8 h before restimulation of cells with mIL-3 was initiated. Three hours after mIL-3 restimulation, the cell lysates were prepared and assayed for luciferase activity. Nuclear extracts were prepared according to the method described by Dignamet al. (30Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9132) Google Scholar). Binding reactions were performed as described by Wadman et al. (32Wadman I.A. Osada H. Grutz G.G. Agulnick A.D. Westphal H. Forster A. Rabbitts T.H. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3145-3157Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar). An E4bp4 GATA element (GATA probe, 5′-TTTATTGCAGATAACCCATGAAAGGCTC-3′) or a 4-bp mismatched MutGATA element (MutGATA probe, 5′-TTTATTGCAagccACCCATGAAAGGCTC-3′) was used in the EMSA. The competition and supershift experiments were performed as described previously (31Chen W., Yu, Y.L. Lee S.F. Chiang Y.J. Chao J.R. Huang J.H. Chiong J.H. Huang C.J. Lai M.Z. Yang-Yen H.F. Yen J.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4636-4646Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The GATA-1-containing complex was supershifted with an anti-GATA-1 antibody (N6; Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.; Santa Cruz, CA), and the GATA-2-containing complex was supershifted with a rabbit polyclonal anti-GATA-2 antibody (H-116; Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.). The murine GATA-1 cDNA encompassing the entire coding region (∼1.2 kb) was synthesized by PCR amplification of a murine cDNA library (CLONTECH) with the following two primers: sense, 5′-GGATCCGATTTTCCTGGTCTAGGG-3′, and antisense, 5′-CTTAAGTCAAGAACTGAGTGGGGC-3′ (33Tsai S.F. Martin D.I. Zon L.I. D'Andrea A.D. Wong G.G. Orkin S.H. Nature. 1989; 339: 446-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar). The PCR-amplified murine GATA-1 cDNA fragment was digested with restriction enzymesBamHI and EcoRI and cloned into theBamHI and EcoRI sites of the pCMVflag vector to generate the expression vector pCMVflag-mGATA-1. The expression vector pcDNA3-HA-mGATA-2 was generated by PCR amplifying the murine GATA-2 cDNA with the following two primers: sense, 5′-GAATTCGAGGTGGCTCCTGAGCAG-3′, and antisense, 5′-CTCGAGCTAGCCCATGGCAGTCAC-3′; and the resultant PCR product was subcloned into the EcoRI and XhoI sites of the pcDNA3 vector. The dominant-negative mutant of mGATA-1 (34Visvader J.E. Crossley M. Hill J. Orkin S.H. Adams J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 634-641Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) containing only the C-terminal zinc finger (amino acids 230–336) was generated by PCR amplification of the murine GATA-1 cDNA template with the following two primers (N-terminal primer GATA230P5, 5′-GGATCCTTGTATCACAAGATGAAT-3′; C-terminal primer GATA336P3, 5′-TCACACCATGAAGCCACCTGC-3′). The resultant DNA fragment was subcloned into the pcDNA3-HA vector to yield the expression vector pcDNA3-HA-mGATA-1-dn. All constructs generated via methods involving the PCR step were confirmed by sequencing to be free of base mutations in the amplified region. Antibody specific for GATA-1 was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (N6; Santa Cruz, CA). Antibody for FLAG tag was purchased from Sigma (M2), and antibody for hemagglutinin (HA) tag was purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals (monoclonal antibody 12CA5; Mannheim, Germany). The cell lysates were prepared and analyzed by Western blotting as described previously (31Chen W., Yu, Y.L. Lee S.F. Chiang Y.J. Chao J.R. Huang J.H. Chiong J.H. Huang C.J. Lai M.Z. Yang-Yen H.F. Yen J.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4636-4646Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The specific signals were visualized by an ECL Western blot system (Amersham Biosciences). The release of nucleosome into the cytosolic fraction was used to determine the degree of cells undergoing apoptosis and was performed as described previously (35Huang H.M., Li, J.C. Hsieh Y.C. Yang-Yen H.F. Yen J.J. Blood. 1999; 93: 2569-2577Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The viability of cells was determined by Trypan blue exclusion staining. The ChIP assay was carried out according to a published protocol (36Saccani S. Pantano S. Natoli G. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 193: 1351-1359Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). Briefly, cross-linked chromatin prepared from rapid growing cells cultured in IL-3-containing medium was sonicated to an average size of 400 bp prior to being immunoprecipitated with either anti-GATA-1 antibody or control rat IgG (anti-murine CD44) at 4 °C overnight. The immunoprecipitated chromatin, after reversal of cross-linking, was PCR-amplified with various sets of primers that either specific to the E4bp4 or a negative control gene (mouse mcl-1) (see below). The amplified DNA product was then resolved by agarose gel electrophoresis or further transferred onto membrane and subjected to Southern blot analysis using 32P-labeled E4bp4promoter-specific oligonucleotide containing the GATA motif (5′-CTACTTTATTGCAGATAACCCATGAAAGGC-3′). For PCR amplification of a specific region (F1–F5; see Fig. 6A) of theE4bp4 genomic locus, the following sets of primers were used: F1 (nucleotides −1020 to −724), mE4P5–1020 (5′-ATCTTAACTTTCAAGAGAGCTGTGTTTTAA-3′) and mE4P3–724 (5′-TGTTAACCTGCTGTCCCACCTCTGAGGGCC-3′); F2 (nucleotides −663 to −414), mE4P5–663 (5′-GGGCAGCACTCGTGTTCTGGTCACCATTGT-3′) and mE4P3–414 (5′-ACTTGGACCCATGCAATCCTTTCGTCTAGT-3′); F3 (nucleotides −360 to +1), mE4P5–360 (5′-TCTGCTGGACCACATAGTCCAAGGCAAAGA-3′) and mE4P3+1 (5′-CAGAAAGGACCTCCTCGTCCTACAGACCGG-3′); F4 (nucleotides +122 to +372), mE4P5+122 (5′-CAGGTGAAGATTTGCTCCTGAACGAAGGGA-3′) and mE4P3+372 (5′-TAATTTCAGGGAGAGCAGCTCAGCTTTTAA-3′); F5, (nucleotides +421 to +734), mE4P5+421 (5′-CTCAGTAATTCCACAGCTGTCTACTTTCAG-3′) and mE4P3+734 (5′-TGGTAGATGGAGGTGGAATACGTGCCCCGC-3′). The primers used to amplify themcl-1 gene promoter (53Chao J.R. Wang J.M. Lee S.F. Peng H.W. Lin Y.H. Chou C.H., Li, J.C. Huang H.M. Chou C.K. Kuo M.L. Yen J.J.Y. Yang-Yen H.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4883-4898Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) are as follows: mMclP5–420 (5′-ACGAGAAAGGCTAAGGCAGGACTGC-3′) and mMclP3+20 (5′-CGCCGCAGGCTGAGGGGAAGGAGCG-3′). E4bp4 is a survival gene known to be activated by IL-3 in a murine pro-B cell line Ba/F3 (25Ikushima S. Inukai T. Inaba T. Nimer S.D. Cleveland J.L. Look A.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2609-2614Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). In this study, our initial goal was to understand the mechanism by which IL-3 regulates E4bp4 gene expression. We first examined whether IL-3 stimulation of the E4bp4mRNA expression could also be observed in bone marrow-derived primary IL-3-dependent cells. To address this issue, a Northern blot analysis was carried out, and the results are shown in Fig. 1A. As in the case of Ba/F3 cells (lanes 1–5), IL-3 stimulation of the primary cells resulted in an increase of the E4bp4 mRNA levels (Fig. 1A, lanes 6–8). The induction fold (∼8-fold) and kinetics (peaks at 1 h) observed with the primary cells were also very similar to those observed with the Ba/F3 cells. To determine whether IL-3 stimulation of E4bp4 mRNA expression was regulated at the transcriptional level, the nuclear run-on assay was carried out with nascent RNA probes prepared from Ba/F3 cells with or without IL-3 stimulation. As shown in Fig.1B, the transcription activity of E4bp4, like that of the positive control JunB, was markedly increased upon IL-3 stimulation, whereas transcription of either G3pdhor β-actin was unaffected by IL-3 (Fig. 1B, compare lanes 1 and 2). We next determined whether the stability of E4bp4 transcripts in response to IL-3 stimulation might also be affected. To address this issue, we measured the half-life of the E4bp4 mRNA in cells with or without IL-3 stimulation. As illustrated in Fig. 1C, the levels of E4bp4 mRNA in cells with or without IL-3 stimulation both decreased dramatically within 1 h after treatment of cells with a potent transcription inhibitor, actinomycin-D (Fig.1C). Under the same conditions no significant decline was observed with the levels of G3pdh mRNA (data not shown). The estimated half-life of E4bp4 mRNA was around 30 min regardless of the presence or absence of IL-3 (Fig. 1C). These results together with those observed with the nuclear run-on assay suggest that IL-3 stimulation of the E4bp4 mRNA expression is mainly regulated at the transcriptional level. To characterize the IL-3 signaling pathway that leads to transcriptional activation of the E4bp4 gene, the genomic DNA spanning theE4bp4 promoter region was PCR-amplified from theSspI-cut, adapter-tagged murine genomic DNA using a pair of nested primers (Fig. 2A, E1 and E2) as described under “Experimental Procedures.” To further confirm the identity of the cloned E4bp4 promoter locus, other restriction enzyme-digested adaptor-tagged murine genomic DNA was used as a template to amplify the E4bp4 promoter region using the same set of E4bp4 nested primers. All of the resulting DNA fragments were found to overlap with each other, and the sequence of the longest clone is shown in Fig. 2A. To map potential transcription start site(s) in the 5′-flanking region of E4bp4, both primer extension and S1 nuclease protection analyses were performed. In primer extension analysis (Fig.2B), multiple potential transcriptional initiation sites were reproducibly observed with RNA isolated from IL-3-stimulated cells, with one major site positioned at −167 (relative to the translation start site) and a minor one at −136 (Fig. 2B,lanes 2 and 3). The minor site at −136 was likely to be an artifact generated because of a secondary structure formed at the 5′ end of the E4bp4 transcript, because this band became more obscure when an identical experiment was repeated at 42 °C (data not shown). On the other hand, a single major transcriptional initiation site at −158 was mapped when the S1 nuclease protection assay was carried out with RNA isolated from IL-3-stimulated cells (Fig. 2C, lane 1). Under the same conditions, neither RNA from IL-3-deprived cells nor yeast control RNA gave any extended products (Fig. 2B, lanes 1 and 2) or protected bands (Fig. 2C,lanes 2 and 3). An A/T-rich sequence between −167 and −158, which tends to cause breathing of double-stranded DNA and shortening of the protected fragments in the exonuclease reaction, might have accounted for the discrepancy in mapping the transcription initiation site by these two methods. The sequence surrounding the transcription initiation site at −167 (5′-C-T-A+1-C-T-T-T-A-3′) is highly homologous to the consensus of the initiator element of eukaryotic genes (5′-Y-Y-A+1-N-T/A-Y-Y-Y-3′) (37Smale S.T. Jain A. Kaufmann J. Emami K.H., Lo, K. Garraway I.P. Cold Spring Harb. Symp. Quant.

To further demarcate the critical promoter sequence in the 5′-flanking region ofE4bp4, luciferase reporters driven by various regions of theE4bp4 promoter were transiently transfected into Ba/F3 cells, and their responses to IL-3 were analyzed. As shown in Fig.3, the 5′-flanking DNA fragment between −1139 to +1, when placed in front of the promoter-less pGL2-basic luciferase vector, exhibited some basal promoter activity without the stimulation of IL-3 (Fig. 3B, compare pGL2-basicand −1139/+1). Exposure of cells transfected with this reporter to IL-3 resulted in an ∼4-fold increase in luciferase activity (Fig. 3), suggesting that there is a basal promoter as well as an IL-3 response element present in this region. Reporters containing various 5′ deletions between −1139 and −205 still retained nearly full inducibility by IL-3. However, further 5′ deletions into nucleotide −194 resulted into the decrease of induction fold to ∼2.6 (Fig. 3A). Furthermore, the −166/+1 and the −205/−138 constructs that lack the potential initiator consensus A at −167 or the sequence downstream of −138, respectively, exerted a basal promoter activity very similar to that of the other constructs mentioned above (Fig. 3B). Both of the constructs still responded to IL-3 induction, although their induction responses were decreased to ∼2-fold. On the other hand, the DNA fragment spanning either between −135 and +1 or between −1139 and −205 exerted a much weaker basal promoter activity as compared with others mentioned above. Furthermore, neither of these latter two reporters responded to IL-3"

Neither subunit on its own interacts with promoter DNA, but the combined holo-RNAP recognizes and selectively initiates from promoters related to the consensus sequence ATATAAGTA. To pursue the question of why Rpo41, which resembles the single polypeptide RNAPs from bacteriophage T7 and T3, requires a separate specificity factor, we analyzed a collection of Mtf1 point mutations that confer an in vivo petite phenotype. These mutant proteins are able to interact with Rpo41 and are capable of nearly wild type levels of initiation in vitro with a consensus promoter-containing template (14 S rRNA). However, the petite phenotype of two mutants can be explained by the fact that they exhibit dramatic transcriptional defects on non-consensus promoters.

Although only the yeast mitochondrial RNAP has been fully characterized in terms of the composition and activity of the holo-RNAP, it appears to be a relevant model for most, if not all, eukaryotic mitochondria. The yeast mitochondrial RNAP is composed of two nuclear encoded subunits, a single polypeptide core RNAP, Rpo41 (3Kelly J.L. Greenleaf A.L. Lehman I.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 10348-10351Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and a specificity factor, Mtf1 (4Lisowsky T. Michaelis G. Mol. Gen.

Rpo41 and Mtf1 interact in solution in the absence of DNA creating a holo-RNAP that can bind to the simple nonanucleotide promoter (consensus ATATAAGTA) and initiate transcription (6Mangus D.A. Jang S.H. Jaehning J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26568-26574Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mtf1 remains associated with Rpo41 during initiation and in the early stages of elongation; this association changes dramatically after a short RNA chain is synthesized and Rpo41 enters into the elongation mode. At this point Mtf1 is readily released from the elongating RNAP (6Mangus D.A. Jang S.H. Jaehning J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26568-26574Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the absence of Mtf1, Rpo41 can initiate transcription non-selectively from a synthetic DNA polymer template poly[d(A-T)]. However, for promoter recognition and selective initiation, Mtf1 is absolutely required (5Jang S.H. Jaehning J.A. J. Biol.

Rpo41 is a 150-kDa protein with striking amino acid sequence similarity to the T7 and T3 bacteriophage single polypeptide RNAPs (10Masters B.S. Stohl L.L. Clayton D.A. Cell. 1987; 51: 89-99Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). Several genes encoding T7-like Rpo41 homologues have been identified in other eukaryotes (reviewed in Ref. 2Cermakian N. Ikeda T.M. Miramontes P. Lang B.F. Gray M.W. Cedergren R. J. Mol. Evol. 1997; 45: 671-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), and although there are only a few cases where the gene product has been demonstrated to have RNAP activity (11Nam S.C. Kang C. Protein Expr. Purif. 2001; 21: 485-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), or to be important for in vivo mitochondrial function (12Chang C.C. Sheen J. Bligny M. Niwa Y. Lerbs-Mache S.

It is intriguing that a recombinant form of the human Rpo41 homologue is transcriptionally active in vitro on synthetic polymeric templates (11Nam S.C. Kang C. Protein Expr. Purif. 2001; 21: 485-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) but inactive on a human mitochondrial promoter and is presumed to be missing an Mtf1-like specificity factor (14Prieto-Martin A. Montoya J. Martinez-Azorin F. FEBS Lett. 2001; 503: 51-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). We are left with an important unanswered question: why do the single polypeptide mitochondrial RNAPs differ from the bacteriophage RNAPs in requiring a dissociable specificity factor? Early mitochondria used a bacterial-like multisubunit RNAP and, presumably, a sigma-like specificity factor for transcription of promoters that still resembled those from bacteria (15Lang B.F. Burger G. O'Kelly C.J. Cedergren R. Golding G.B. Lemieux C. Sankoff D. Turmel M. Gray M.W. Nature. 1997; 387: 493-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). In this regard, it is interesting that Mtf1 has some amino acid sequence similarity to the family of bacterial sigma factors (5Jang S.H. Jaehning J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22671-22677Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the AT-rich yeast mitochondrial promoter is recognized as a −10 promoter element by the bacterial RNAP (7Winkley C.S. Keller M.J. Jaehning J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 14214-14223Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Some of the amino acids shared by sigma factor and Mtf1 include residues important for interactions with their respective core RNAPs (16Cliften P.F. Park J.Y. Davis B.P. Jang S.H. Jaehning J.A. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2897-2909Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Like sigma factors, Mtf1 is only required for initiation (6Mangus D.A. Jang S.H. Jaehning J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26568-26574Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and its association with the core RNAP suppresses nonspecific interactions with DNA (7Winkley C.S. Keller M.J. Jaehning J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 14214-14223Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Schinkel A.H. Koerkamp M.J. Touw E.P. Tabak H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 12785-12791Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The limited amino acid sequence similarity with sigma factors may not reflect a similar three-dimensional structure. The recent report of an Mtf1 crystal structure has revealed clear similarity to the family of RNA and DNA methyltransferases (17Schubot F.D. Chen C.J. Rose J.P. Dailey T.A. Dailey H.A. Wang B.C. Prot. Sci. 2001; 10: 1980-1988Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Based on this similarity, Schubotet al. (17Schubot F.D. Chen C.J. Rose J.P. Dailey T.A. Dailey H.A. Wang B.C. Prot. Sci. 2001; 10: 1980-1988Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) speculate that Mtf1 may not be a promoter specificity factor but may instead bind to Rpo41, converting the enzyme to a promoter recognizing form, or that Mtf1 may act to bind the nascent RNA chain. In this work we have analyzed a collection of point mutants in Mtf1 that are defective for in vivo function but that retain the ability to form a stable complex with Rpo41 and to suppress its nonspecific interactions with DNA. Among these mutants we have identified two, Y54F and C192F, that are still capable of directing transcription from a consensus promoter but that have lost the ability to transcribe non-consensus variants. These results strongly support the theory that Mtf1 itself, like sigma factor, plays a central role in mitochondrial promoter recognition and the initiation of transcription. Plasmid DNAs containing GST-Mtf1 fusion constructs (16Cliften P.F. Park J.Y. Davis B.P. Jang S.H. Jaehning J.A. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2897-2909Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) were transformed into Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) codon plus RIL cells (Stratagene). Cells were grown in a buffered YT medium containing 1.4% yeast extract, 0.8% Tryptone, 75 mm K2HPO4, 8.8 mmKH2PO4, and 1% glucose. One-liter cultures inoculated to an A 600 of 0.1 were incubated in a 20 °C shaking water bath for 6 h and induced for 11 h at 20 °C with 0.1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. Cultures were harvested by centrifugation; cell pellets were washed with 100 mm Tris, pH 7.9, resuspended in 150 ml of T(50) (100 mm Tris, pH 7.9, 2 mm EDTA, 5% glycerol, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm DTT, 50 mm KCl), and stored at −80 °C. To purify GST-Mtf1, the cells were thawed and the buffer was adjusted to 2 mm DTT, 1 mg/ml lysozyme, and protease inhibitors (1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.35 μg/ml bestatin, 0.4 μg/ml pepstatin, 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 20 μg/ml benzamidine). This mixture was incubated on ice for 1 h then sonicated (Fisher 550 Sonic Dismembrator, large tip) with four 1-min pulses. Nonidet P-40 was added to 0.5%, and the extract was centrifuged at 35,000 ×g for 45 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was filtered through a 0.22-μm PES filter and then incubated with 5 ml of glutathione-agarose (Pierce) equilibrated with T(50) plus 2 mm DTT and protease inhibitors. This mixture was stirred in the cold for 1.5 h and then loaded into a 10-ml disposable column. The column was washed with 100 ml of T(50) plus 2 mm DTT and protease inhibitors and then eluted with 50 ml of T(50) plus 2 mm DTT, protease inhibitors, and 10 mm reduced glutathione. Peak protein containing fractions were pooled and dialyzed against three 1-liter changes of T(50) containing 10% glycerol, 0.1 mm DTT, and protease inhibitors. Aliquots were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C. The purity of the samples was assessed by electrophoresis on 4–12% Bis-Tris NuPAGE acrylamide gels (Invitrogen). A 4078-bpRPO41 fragment generated from yeast strain pJH22 (16Cliften P.F. Park J.Y. Davis B.P. Jang S.H. Jaehning J.A. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2897-2909Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) was cloned into the baculovirus transfer vector pAcHLTA (BD PharMingen). The primers used for this PCR reaction were: StuI, 5′-GAAGGCCTATGCTGAGACCGGCCTATAAATC and SacI, 5′-GCTCTAGAGAGCTCTCACGAGAAAAAATATTGAC. Transfection of Sf9 insect cells and growth of HIS-Rpo41-producing clones was carried out by the University of Colorado Health Sciences Center Tissue Culture Core Facility. A cell pellet from a 500-ml culture of productively infected Sf9 cells was processed to obtain the HIS-Rpo41 protein. Cells were lysed in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.9, 100 mm KCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, and protease inhibitors (see previous section) by vortexing the cell suspension for eight 10-s pulses. The resulting lysate was centrifuged at 3000 ×g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was combined with 1.5 ml of charged nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin (Qiagen) equilibrated with 20 mm Tris, pH 7.9, 500 mmKCl, 10 mm B-mecaptoethanol, 10% glycerol, 0.5 mm imidazole, and protease inhibitors. This mixture was incubated overnight at 4 °C then transferred to a 5-ml disposable column. The resin was washed with 10 column volumes of 20 mm Tris, pH 7.9, 500 mm KCl, 2.5 mmimidazole, 10% glycerol, and protease inhibitors and eluted with 10 column volumes of 20 mm Tris, pH 7.9, 100 mmKCl, 40 mm imidazole, 10% glycerol, and protease inhibitors. Non-selective in vitro transcription reactions (18Mangus D.A. Jaehning J.A. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 264: 57-66Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were performed on these fractions to identify those containing RNAP activity. Fractions containing peak activity were pooled and dialyzed against M(0) buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.9, 5% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm DTT, and protease inhibitors). This dialyzed sample was then bound to an Amersham Biosciences fast-protein liquid chromatography Mono Q column, the HIS-Rpo41 was eluted with a linear gradient of M(0) to M(250) buffer (numbers in parenthesis indicate millimolar amounts of KCl), and non-selective in vitrotranscription reactions were performed on the eluted fractions to identify those containing RNAP activity. Peak activity fractions were pooled, bovine serum albumin was added to 50 μg/ml, and the pool was dialyzed against T(50) storage buffer (30 mm Tris, pH 7.9, 2 mm EDTA, 5% glycerol, 10 mmMgCl2, 0.1 mm DTT, protease inhibitors, and 50 mm KCl). Small aliquots were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C. Promoter-containing templates were generated by PCR from genomic sequences of yeast mitochondrial DNA. Specific primers were used to create DNA fragments, which were then cloned using a TA cloning kit with vector pCR 2.1 (Invitrogen). Primer sequences were: 14 S rRNA #365, 5′-GGACTAATTTAACTTTT; #366, 5′-CCTAATAAAATTACTCACG; COX2 #85, 5′-AAAAAGGTGGGGTTTGGTAA; #86, 5′-TTGGTACATCATTCATAATG; tRNACys #89, 5′-CTTAATATTTATTATCATTATTTC; and #28, 5′-CTCTTAATAAGTAGATTTGCAATC. Ligated products were transformed into E. coli DH5α cells. Constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing by the UCHSC Cancer Center Core Facility. One-liter cultures of strains containing promoter clones were processed for plasmid DNA using a Qiagen GIGA kit. Strain identifications are: 14 S rRNA-pJJ1305, COX2-pJJ1109, and tRNACys-pJJ1110. Plasmid DNA was linearized withBamHI and then purified using Qiagen Q-500 tips. The 20-μl reactions contained 50 mm Tris, pH 7.9, 20 mmMgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 500 μm each of ATP, CTP, and GTP, 100 μm UTP, [α-32P]UTP (1000 cpm/pmol UTP), 20 μg/ml linearized template, 0.16–0.8 pmol of GST-Mtf1, and 0.41 pmol of HIS-Rpo41. Enzyme samples were diluted with T(50) containing 50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin and 1 mmDTT immediately prior to use. Reactions were incubated at 30 °C for 10 min and stopped by adding 25 μl of formamide dye mix containing 50 mm EDTA, and the products were resolved on 7 murea, 8% polyacrylamide gels. For the minus CTP reactions to compare activity on linear and supercoiled templates, conditions were as described above except for the absence of CTP and an increase in the specific activity of [α-32P]UTP to 2000 cpm/pmol. Products were resolved on 7 m urea, 11% polyacrylamide gels. For dinucleotide reactions, the appropriate (corresponding to +1 and+2 bases of the transcript) or inappropriate dinucleotides (Sigma Chemical Co.) were present at 50 μm. Autoradiographs were quantitated with Molecular Dynamics ImageQuaNT software, version 1.2. We have previously described a collection of point mutations in the yeast MTF1 gene produced by PCR mutagenesis and identified as defective in mitochondrial function (petite phenotype) by a plasmid shuffle protocol (16Cliften P.F. Park J.Y. Davis B.P. Jang S.H. Jaehning J.A. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2897-2909Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The two-hybrid technique was used to discriminate among these mutations those that had lost the ability to interact with Rpo41 (16Cliften P.F. Park J.Y. Davis B.P. Jang S.H. Jaehning J.A. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2897-2909Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The functional defects of the remaining six mutations were not defined, but, based on both two-hybrid interactions and in vitro protein/protein interaction assays (summarized in Table I), all of these mutants are correctly folded such that they are able to interact with Rpo41 as well as does wild type Mtf1. Also included in Table I is information on the L53H mutant, a non-interacting, temperature-sensitive (ts) petite mutation of the amino acid that is immediately adjacent to the interacting, but petite Y54F mutation; this non-interacting mutation serves as a control in several of the experiments below.Table IMTF1 petite mutationsMutationPhenotypeCore interactionL53Hts petiteDefectiveY54FPetiteNormalS81NPetiteNormalE114Vts petiteNormalC192Fts petiteNormalQ219Rts petiteNormalL228SPetiteNormalThe in vivo phenotype and ability to interact with Rpo41 are summarized from Cliften et al.

To elucidate the defects in the interacting mutant proteins summarized in Table I, we first used promoter-selective in vitrotranscription reactions. These run-off transcription reactions use templates that contain a yeast mitochondrial promoter sequence upstream of a restriction enzyme cleavage site (Fig.1 A). Three yeast mitochondrial promoters were used in these experiments: the 14 S rRNA promoter that contains an exact match to the nonanucleotide consensus ATATAAGTA (19Osinga K.A., De Haan M. Christianson T. Tabak H.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1982; 10: 7993-8006Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), the variant COX2 promoter (20Cameron V.L. Fox T.D. Poyton R.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13391-13394Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the weak tRNACys promoter (21Wettstein-Edwards J. Ticho B.S. Martin N.C. Najarian D. Getz G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 2905-2911Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Promoters like 14 S rRNA and COX2 with a purine at the +2 position are generally strong promoters (22Biswas T.K. Gene (Amst.). 1996; 170: 23-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 23Biswas T.K. Ticho B. Getz G.S. J. Biol.

Chem. 1990; 265: 19053-19059Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), as can be seen in the in vitro transcription reaction using mitochondrial RNAP reconstituted from recombinant His-tagged Rpo41 and GST-tagged wild type Mtf1 (Fig. 1 B). Substitution of a pyrimidine for the purine at position +2, as found in the tRNACys promoter, results in a much weaker promoter (25Biswas T.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9338-9342Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1 B). Each of the Mtf1 mutations listed in Table I was expressed in E. coli as a GST fusion protein and purified using glutathione-agarose chromatography (Fig. 1 C). We have previously demonstrated that addition of the GST tag to Mtf1 does not interfere with the protein's ability to interact with Rpo41 or to direct selective transcription (6Mangus D.A. Jang S.H. Jaehning J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26568-26574Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Equal amounts of the purified proteins shown in Fig. 1 C were used in the in vitro transcription reactions with a purified baculovirus-expressed form of His-tagged Rpo41. Similar results were obtained using untagged Rpo41 purified from yeast (data not shown). We were surprised to discover that all of the petite and ts petite Mtf1 mutants were capable of transcription from the consensus 14 S rRNA promoter at levels very similar to that observed for wild type Mtf1 (Fig. 2, A and B). Notice that the non-interacting L53H mutation was completely incapable of directing promoter selective transcription by Rpo41. This non-interacting mutation also does not suppress the nonspecific transcription of the DNA template visible as a faint background smear of nucleotide incorporation in this experiment (Fig. 2 A; see also below). With transcription by wild type Mtf1 set to 100%, the activity of the mutant Mtf1s ranged from just over 50% to 150%. The less than 2-fold reductions observed with the S81N and C192F mutations seem unlikely to account for the petite and ts petite phenotypes of these mutations. All of the interacting Mtf1 mutations can transcribe the consensus 14 S rRNA promoter. However, the yeast mitochondrial genome has multiple promoters with both consensus and non-consensus sequences driving the expression of many RNA and protein coding genes (reviewed in Refs. 26Costanzo M.C. Fox T.D. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1990; 24: 91-113Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Dieckmann C.L. Staples R.R. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1994; 152: 145-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 28Jang S.-H.

Gene (Amst.). 1998; 212: 305-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). To determine whether any of the mutant Mtf1s had selectively lost the ability to recognize variant mitochondrial promoters, we carried out in vitrotranscription reactions using the COX2 promoter. As seen in Fig.1 A, the COX2 promoter varies from the consensus, and the 14 S rRNA promoter, in three positions: T instead of A at −8; A instead of T at −5; and G instead of A at +2. None of these substitutions has a major affect on the ability of this sequence to be recognized as a promoter by the wild type mitochondrial holo-RNAP (20Cameron V.L. Fox T.D. Poyton R.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13391-13394Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Biswas T.K. Ticho B. Getz G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 13690-13696Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), as shown in a direct comparison with transcription from the 14 S rRNA promoter (Fig. 1 B). Most of the interacting mutants were capable of nearly wild type levels of transcription with the COX2 promoter (Fig.3). However, Mtf1 carrying the C192F mutation was incapable of transcription from this variant promoter (Fig. 3). Note that the C192F mutation is still capable of suppressing Rpo41's nonspecific interaction with DNA (compare transcription by L53H to C192F in Fig. 3 A), even though promoter specific transcription is reduced over 10-fold relative to wild type Mtf1 (Fig.3 B). In addition to the strong COX2 promoter, we also tested the Mtf1 mutations on the weak tRNACys promoter (21Wettstein-Edwards J. Ticho B.S. Martin N.C. Najarian D. Getz G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 2905-2911Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This promoter varies from the consensus and the 14 S rRNA promoter at two positions: T instead of A at −8 and T instead of A at +2 (Fig. 1 A). The substitution of a pyrimidine for a purine at +2 makes the tRNACys promoter “weak” (30Biswas T.K. Getz G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 3927-3930Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), resulting in 3-fold lower transcription from this template by wild type RNAP than from the strong 14 S rRNA and COX2 promoters (Fig. 1 B). We found that most of the mutant Mtf1s were still capable of transcribing the tRNACys promoter at levels indistinguishable from wild type (Fig. 4, A and B). However, the C192F mutation, previously shown to be defective on the COX2 promoter, was also completely defective for transcription from the tRNACys promoter, with transcript abundance reduced below the limits of detection (Fig. 4 B). In addition, the Y54F mutation also demonstrated a significant reduction in transcription, with levels 4- to 5-fold lower than wild type Mtf1 (Fig.4 B). Again, note the ability of both the Y54F and C192F mutations to reduce nonspecific interactions of Rpo41 with DNA relative to the non-interacting mutant L53H (Fig. 4 A). The inability of the Mtf1 mutations to transcribe the variant promoters could be due to defects in DNA binding, promoter melting, open complex formation, nucleotide binding, first bond formation, or promoter escape (31McClure W.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 5634-5638Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). We first asked whether the defect was at the level of first bond formation by testing the response to addition of dinucleotide primers to the transcription reactions. Biswas (24Biswas T.K. Getz G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19053-19059Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Biswas T.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9338-9342Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) has shown that transcription from weak promoters such as tRNACys is significantly improved when a dinucleotide corresponding to the +1 and +2 positions is provided, whereas transcription from promoter variants with sequence alterations toward the 5′-end is unaffected by the addition of dinucleotides. Consistent with these observations, we found little or no effect of dinucleotide addition on transcription of the COX2 promoter by either wild type or mutant Mtf1 (Fig.5 A). In contrast, we found that addition of the appropriate initiating dinucleotide, AU, to tRNACys reactions significantly improved transcription both by wild type Mtf1 and by the Y54F, S81N, and C192F mutations (Fig.5 B). Transcription by Y54F was restored to levels indistinguishable from wild type, and although the signal from the C192F transcription reactions was still much lower than wild type, it was now detectable. Addition of an inappropriate dinucleotide, AA, had no effect on transcription. These experiments establish that the Y54F and C192F Mtf1 mutations have specific defects in initiation from a weak mitochondrial promoter that can be partially or fully corrected by the addition of an appropriate dinucleotide. We also asked whether the mutant specificity factors had defects in promoter melting by comparing transcription from linear templates to that from supercoiled templates, because supercoiling reduces the energy needed for open promoter complex formation (reviewed in Refs. 32deHaseth P.L. Helmann J.D. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 16: 817-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholarand 33Helmann J.D. deHaseth P.L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5959-5967Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). For these experiments we took advantage of the sequences downstream of the tRNACys promoter. The first C residue in the tRNACys transcript is not encountered until the transcript is 38 bases long, so omission of CTP from the reactions produces a 38-nucleotide transcript from both linear and supercoiled circular templates for direct comparison. We found that transcription by wild type Mtf1 and the S81N mutant was relatively unaffected by the template topology, whereas transcription by both the Y54F and the C192F mutations was dramatically increased when the supercoiled template was used (Fig. 5 C). These results indicate that both of these mutant proteins have defects in creating or maintaining an open promoter complex that can be corrected by DNA supercoiling. Mtf1 was designated a “specificity factor” for the yeast mitochondrial RNAP based on the fact that it is required, in combination with the Rpo41 core RNAP, for selective transcription of promoter-containing templates (5Jang S.H. Jaehning J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22671-22677Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, whether promoter recognition was actually a function of Mtf1 or if instead Mtf1 acted to convert Rpo41 into a form competent for promoter recognition was not elucidated in prior studies. By analyzing mutants in Mtf1 that are defective for in vivo function, we have identified specific amino acids required for the utilization of nonconsensus yeast mitochondrial promoters. The Y54F and C192F mutations do not alter the folded structure of Mtf1; proteins bearing these mutations can still associate with Rpo41 an"

Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 717-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (1595) Google Scholar). It contains an F1 sector with subunits for nucleotide binding and catalysis and an F0 sector, which conducts protons across the membrane. Five different subunits are found in the E. coli F1 (α, β, γ, δ, and ε) with a stoichiometry of 3:3:1:1:1. Three different subunits are found in the E. coli F0(a, b, and c) with a stoichiometry of 1:2:9–12 (2Foster D.L. Fillingame R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 2009-2015Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The mechanism by which an electrochemical proton gradient across the membrane drives ATP synthesis involves the rotation of the subunitc oligomer of F0, which drives the rotation of γ and ε as a rotor with subunits a and bfunctioning as the stator along with δ, α, and β. The crystallization of F1 from bovine mitochondria led to a high resolution structure of the α3β3 hexamer plus the parts of γ in the central core (3Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G.W. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2753) Google Scholar). This structural information led to the numerous studies that have provided evidence supporting the hypothesis of rotation (4Noji H. Yasuda R. Yoshida M.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 898-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The mechanism of proton translocation in F0 remains to be understood. The information regarding the tertiary and quarternary structures of the F0 subunits is needed to understand how protons move through F0. Subunit b seems to be embedded in the membrane via a span of hydrophobic amino acids at its N terminus. A truncated soluble form of subunit b has been shown to be extended and dimeric (9Dunn S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7630-7636Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). NMR studies have shown a α-helical hairpin structure for subunit c with two transmembrane spans connected by a polar loop (10Girvin M.E. Rastogi V.K. Abildgaard F. Markley J.L. Fillingame R.H. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 8817-8824Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar, 11Girvin M.E. Fillingame R.H. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 12167-12177Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The number of c subunits that make up the oligomer in F0 of E. coli is still uncertain, but atomic force microscopy (12Seelert H. Poetsch A. Dencher N.A. Engel A. Stahlberg H. Müller D.J. Nature. 2000; 405: 418-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar, 13Stahlberg H. Müller D.J. Suda K. Fotiadis D. Engel A. Meier T. Matthey U. Dimroth P.

A. 2001; 98: 4966-4971Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar) indicates that the probable stoichiometric number for subunitc in E. coli is 10. Electron spectroscopic imaging has provided evidence for a ring of c subunits next to a and b subunits (15Birkenhäger R. Hoppert M. Deckers-Hebestreit G. Mayer F. Altendorf K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 230: 58-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). A 3.9-Å crystal structure of the ATP synthase from Saccharomyces cerevisiaerevealed the c subunit to be an oligomer of 10 subunits (16Stock D. Leslie A.G. Walker J.E. Science. 1999; 286: 1700-1705Crossref PubMed Scopus (1087) Google Scholar). This structure is in agreement with a model proposed for theE. coli c oligomer with the exception that theE. coli oligomer is predicted to contain 12 csubunits (17Dmitriev O.Y. Jones P.C. Fillingame R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7785-7790Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). This would place the conserved carboxylate (cD61 in E. coli), believed to be the proton binding site, in approximately the middle of the bilayer. Recent cross-linking experiments have demonstrated the Na+-binding site in a homologous enzyme from Propionigenium modestum to be found within the lipid bilayer (18von Ballmoos C. Appoldt Y.

Lacking structural information of subunit a by x-ray diffraction or NMR, other lower resolution methods have been employed to understand its arrangement in the membrane and its relationship to the other subunits of the F1F0-ATP synthase. Previously, the surface labeling of uniquely engineered cysteine residues was used to establish the number of transmembrane spans and locate the termini of subunit a (19Long J.C. Wang S. Vik S.B. J.

Five transmembrane spans were identified with the N terminus in the periplasm and the C terminus in the cytoplasm as shown in Fig.1. Substitution mutagenesis has been used to determine that residues important for function reside in transmembrane spans 4 and 5 (22Cain B.D. Simoni R.D. J. Biol.

Cross-linking studies have shown that a surface of transmembrane span 4 between residues 207 and 225 of subunit a appears to be in contact with subunit c(28Jiang W. Fillingame R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6607-6612Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). This region includes aR210, which is strictly conserved among all known species, and in E. coli, all of the known mutations at this position result in the inability to grow on succinate minimal medium and in a loss of ATP-driven proton translocation. Only an alanine substitution at this position allows for passive proton permeability (27Valiyaveetil F.I. Fillingame R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32635-32641Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 29Hatch L.P. Cox G.B. Howitt S.M. J. Biol.

It is probable thataR210 interacts with the essential residue cD61 during coupled proton translocation. It is not clear exactly how subunit a contributes to the proton conducting the path of the F1F0-ATP synthase, but it does play an essential role in this function. Models have been proposed in which subunit a contributes amino acids that make up two half-channels, one opening to the periplasm and one to the cytoplasm, that allow access to the proton binding site on subunit c(30Junge W.

This study is the first in a series of studies designed to elucidate details regarding the secondary, tertiary, and quarternary structures of subunit a to establish what structural features are important to its role in the function of the F1F0 ATP synthase. We began with the first cytoplasmic loop and a highly conserved glutamic acid (Glu-80 inE. coli) found there. Surface-labeling techniques were used to determine the accessibility of the residues found between the first and second transmembrane spans, substitution mutagenesis was used to study the role of the conserved Glu-80, and cross-linking was used to show the proximity of this loop to the other subunits of F0. Restriction endonucleases and T4 DNA ligase were obtained from New England Biolabs. Plasmid mini-prep kits were obtained from Promega. The synthetic oligonucleotides were obtained from Operon Technologies. MPB,1 ACMA, and TFPAM-3 were obtained from Molecular Probes. Ni-NTA resin was obtained from Qiagen. Octyl glucoside, deoxycholate, cholate, andn-dodecylmaltoside were obtained from Sigma or Anatrace. Polyclonal anti-a rabbit antibody was a gift from Karlheinz Altendorf (Universität Osnabrück), and monoclonal anti-b mouse antibody was a gift from Roderick A. Capaldi (University of Oregon). Immunoblotting reagents and a protein assay kit were obtained from Bio-Rad. Automated DNA sequencing was done by Lone Star Laboratories (Houston TX). Plasmids pLN6-HisHA (21Wada T. Long J.C. Zhang D. Vik S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17353-17357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) and pLN7-HisHA (see below) were used for the construction of mutants. These plasmids produce versions of subunita that include both a His6 tag and a HA epitope at the C terminus of the protein. pLN7-HisHA was constructed by first eliminating the AseI site in pLN6-HisHA by digestion, filling in the ends using the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I, and religating. The modified pLN6-HisHA was digested with DraIII and PvuI, and the 2.96-kb fragment was isolated. A similar digest was carried out on pSBV17 (33Vik S.B. Antonio B.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30364-30369Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the 0.37-kb fragment was isolated and then ligated to the 2.96-kb fragment to make pLN7-HisHA. The plasmid pSBV17 is identical to pSBV16 (33Vik S.B. Antonio B.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30364-30369Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with the exception that the region between the two BamHI sites in uncB is wild type. An amino acid substitution was carried out using cassette mutagenesis and pairs of synthetic oligonucleotides as described previously (34Vik S.B. Cain B.D. Chun K.T. Simoni R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6599-6605Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For expression, E. coli RH305 (uncB205, recA56,srl::Tn10, bgl R,thi-1, rel-1, HfrPO1) (35Humbert R. Brusilow W.S. Gunsalus R.P. Klionsky D.J. Simoni R.D. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 153: 416-422Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was used as the host strain for pLN6-HisHA and pLN7-HisHA. RH305 produces a form of subunit a, which is truncated near Pro-240 and cannot be detected in cells (36Hartzog P.E. Cain B.D. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 1337-1343Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It can be complemented by plasmids containing a wild type uncB gene. The subcloning and growth of cultures were carried out as described previously (19Long J.C. Wang S. Vik S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16235-16240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Inside-out membrane vesicles were prepared as described previously (19Long J.C. Wang S. Vik S.B. J.

Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16235-16240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) using the conditions of 120 μm MPB at room temperature for 15 min. After labeling with MPB, subunita was purified using Ni-NTA as described previously (19Long J.C. Wang S. Vik S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16235-16240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined by a detergent-compatible protein assay using bovine serum albumin as standard. Fluorescence assays and measurement of ATP hydrolysis were performed as described previously (31Vik S.B. Patterson A.R. Antonio B.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16229-16234Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Membrane vesicles were incubated with 350 μm TFPAM-3 for 1 h at room temperature. After the quenching of excess reagent with 15 mm cysteine, photolysis was carried out for 2 h at room temperature in a microcentrifuge tube (1.5 ml) at a distance of 3 cm from a 6-watt, 365-nm UV lamp (model UVL-56 Blak-Ray lamp, UVP, Inc.) according to a previously published procedure (37Aggeler R. Chicas-Cruz K. Cai S.X. Keana J.F. Capaldi R.A. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 2956-2961Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The purification of subunit a following procedures for labeling or cross-linking was performed according to methods described previously (19Long J.C. Wang S. Vik S.B. J. Biol.

A series of unique cysteine mutants was constructed in the first cytoplasmic loop of subunit a at residues 73–98. Each of these mutants was found to grow normally on succinate minimal medium. Each mutant was tested individually in membrane vesicles for accessibility of the unique cysteine to the surface label MPB, and the results are shown in Figs. 2 and3. In each figure, panel A shows the reaction for each residue with MPB, whereaspanel B is the corresponding immunoblot for subunit a. In Fig. 2B, the samples were probed with an antibody to subunit a, whereas in Fig. 3Ban anti-HA antibody was used. In Fig. 2, residues 67 and 69 are positive controls from previous studies (19Long J.C. Wang S. Vik S.B. J. Biol.

Labeling is also apparent for residues 73 and 74, and, to a less extent, for residue 76, whereas residues 75, 77, and 78 show at most a trace of labeling. In Fig. 3, residues 84, 87, 88, and 91–98 are all readily labeled. Residues 80, 81, 85, 86, and 90 show only a trace of labeling, whereas 79, 82, 83, and 89 are not labeled. All of the mutants that were not accessible to MPB in membrane vesicles were subjected to labeling after solubilization in detergent (1.5% octylglucoside, 0.1% deoxycholate, and 0.5% cholate) to confirm the presence of the cysteine substitutions. All of the mutants tested for labeling with MPB reacted with the reagent in detergent solution to a similar extent (results not shown).Figure 3MPB labeling of subunit ausing anti-HA antibodies for detection. Residues indicated were mutated to cysteine and probed in membrane vesicle preparations with MPB as described under “Experimental Procedures.”Lanes at each end show the protein standards of 28 and 36 kDa.

To probe its possible functional properties, four substitution mutations were made at the aE80 position: alanine, glutamine, leucine, and lysine. All of the mutants were grown on succinate minimal medium to confirm ATP synthase activity. All showed normal growth after 48 h with the exception of E80K, which showed marginal growth. The aE80A, aE80K,aE80L, and aE80Q mutants were further characterized in a quantitative fashion using minimal A medium and a limiting amount of glucose. The results of the growth yield measurements expressed relative to that of the wild type (pLN7HisHA) were aE80A (89%), aE80K (59%), aE80L (92%), aE80Q (86%), and RH305 (50%). The level of subunita present in the membranes of these four mutants was tested by immunoblotting using the anti-a antibody, and the results are shown in Fig. 4. The level of subunita in membranes from the aE80K mutant was clearly somewhat lower than in the wild type or other mutants. Membrane vesicles from all of the four mutants and wild type were prepared and assayed for ATP hydrolysis with the results shown in TableI. The specific activity of theaE80K mutant is only half of the wild type level, andaE80A and aE80L are also somewhat lower. When ATP hydrolysis was carried out in the presence of LDAO, which releases an uninhibited ATPase from the membranes (38Lötscher H.R. deJong C. Capaldi R.A. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 4140-4143Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), the results showed that all of the mutants have within 85% of the total ATPase activity of the wild type.

Open table in a new tab Proton translocation by the aE80 mutants was studied by observing the ability of membrane vesicle preparations to generate a proton gradient as indicated by quenching the fluorescence of the dye ACMA. This experiment was done in three ways, and the results presented are typical of traces from at least three different experiments using at least two different membrane preparations. First, as shown in Fig.5A, a proton gradient was generated by the addition of NADH, which drives proton translocation via the electron transport chain. This serves to verify the integrity of the membrane vesicles. The four mutants, the wild type (pLN7-HisHA), and the negative control (RH305) all quench the fluorescence of ACMA at approximately the same rate. Second, the proton translocation was driven by the addition of ATP as shown in Fig. 5B. This measures the ability of the ATP synthase to pump protons. Proton translocation by aE80K is much slower than that of the wild type (pLN7-HisHA). aE80A and aE80L show some impairment, and aE80Q quenching is approximately the same as the wild type. Third, the proton permeability of F0 alone was measured, and the results are shown in Fig. 3B. The membranes first are stripped of F1, and then proton translocation is driven by NADH. Since F1 is absent, the F0 channel is “open” to passive proton movement and therefore, little quenching is seen in the wild type andaE80Q. At the other extreme, the negative control (RH305) quenches to the same level as seen in the unstripped membranes (Fig. 5A), because it lacks a functional subunita and the F0 channel cannot form.aE80K quenches nearly as much as RH305, whereasaE80A and aE80L are again intermediate. Eight of the accessible cysteine mutants near the conserved aE80 were subjected to cross-linking experiments using the bifunctional UV-activated cross-linker, TFPAM-3. At the maleimidyl end, TFPAM-3 can react with the free sulfhydryl group of an available cysteine, and when activated by UV light, its nitrene can insert into nearby C–H bonds. The results are shown in Fig. 6. The immunoblots were incubated with antibodies against subunit a(panel A) or b (panel B) as indicated. A distinct band is present in both blots for mutant aK74C that migrates to approximately 47 kDa, a position consistent with an a/b cross-link (subunita, 30.2 kDa; subunit b, 17.2 kDa). A similar-sized band seems to be present for aK91C, although its intensity is much less. The cross-linking appeared to have little effect on proton translocation as seen in Fig. 7. The ATP driven proton translocation was not significantly affected by the cross-linking procedure for both the wild type (pLN7-HisHA) and theaK74C mutant as shown in Fig. 7. The proton permeability of F0 in stripped membranes was also not affected significantly (data not shown). In addition, the residues in the second cytoplasmic loop found in a previous study (19Long J.C. Wang S. Vik S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16235-16240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) to be accessible to MPB were subjected to cross-linking with TFPAM-3. No cross-links were detected for residues 172, 176, or 196 (data not shown). The transmembrane topology of subunit a has been investigated previously with a chemical-labeling approach using mutants with substitutions of unique cysteine residues (19Long J.C. Wang S. Vik S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16235-16240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 20Valiyaveetil F.I. Fillingame R.H. J. Biol.

Chem. 1999; 274: 17353-17357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). In that approach, relatively small numbers of residues in each exposed region of the protein were probed with maleimide reagents. The results indicated a model with five transmembrane spans, the N terminus located in the periplasm, and the C terminus located in the cytoplasm as shown in Fig. 1. In addition, two long loops of 35–40 residues were placed on the cytoplasmic side, and two shorter loops of 3–11 residues were placed on the periplasmic side. In this study, we expanded the analysis to nearly all of the residues in the first cytoplasmic loop between transmembrane spans 1 and 2. This loop is characterized by two lysines (residues 65 and 66) at its N-terminal region near transmembrane span 1 and two additional lysines (residues 97 and 99) at its C-terminal region near transmembrane span 2. This region is shown schematically in Fig.8. The overall hydrophobicity of the intervening region is moderately hydrophobic but less than that of a typical membrane-spanning region (39Vik S.B. Dao N.N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1140: 199-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The most hydrophobic segment, FQTAIELVIGF (residues 75–85), lies just between two predicted turns, VPGK and VNGSV. Previous labeling studies had found that after mutagenesis to cysteine, residues 67–71 were readily labeled by maleimide reagents (19Long J.C. Wang S. Vik S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16235-16240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 20Valiyaveetil F.I. Fillingame R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16241-16247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 21Wada T. Long J.C. Zhang D. Vik S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17353-17357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Here it was shown thataG73C and aK74C, the last two residues in the predicted turn, are also readily labeled. Among the 16 residues fromaF75C to aV90C, only three positions were readily labeled (aG84C, aI87C, and aG88C), and seven more residues showed a trace of labeling. In contrast, all of the residues from 91 to 98 (KDMYHGKS) could be labeled to a significant extent. Overall, the labeling pattern of the residues between the two pairs of lysines can be described as follows. The eight residues closest to the lysines near the membrane interface can be labeled, whereas most of the intervening 16 residues are rather resistant to labeling. The labeling results indicate that the regions of the polypeptide that extend out from the transmembrane spans are highly exposed. This would be consistent with a peripheral location of these transmembrane spans relative to spans 3–5 of subunita, the two transmembrane spans of subunit b, and the oligomer of subunit c. Such an arrangement would allow access of the bulky MPB to five or more consecutive residues in the polypeptide chain. The labeling pattern also suggests a relatively fixed conformation for the central region of this loop in which the more hydrophobic residues are shielded. Such shielding could be from lipids, other regions of subunit a, or from other subunits. The lipids would seem to be the least likely source for the shielding of a loop based on the observation of the loops of membrane proteins of known three-dimensional structures. The interaction with other regions of subunit a or with subunit b is more probable based on our results of cross-linking and analysis of Glu-80 mutants. Glu-80 is a conserved residue that has been found in all of the bacterial and chloroplast sequences examined so far. It is found in the middle of a generally hydrophobic stretch of seven residues, and it always follows a conserved glutamine, Gln-76, in E. coli. The mutagenesis of Glu-80 had only minor effects, except when the substitution was lysine. Although immunoblots showed that the level of protein in the membranes from the aE80K strain is somewhat reduced relative to wild type, it is not probable that this is the primary explanation for the altered properties seen. For example, it has been shown that only ∼10–15% of the normal level of ATP synthase is sufficient for growth on a minimal succinate medium (40Boogerd F.C. Boe L. Michelsen O. Jensen P.R. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 5855-5859Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Here, the analysis of ATP hydrolysis indicates that a normal level of F1-ATPase was present in membranes from all of the four mutants and that even the aE80K mutant showed substantial sensitivity of ATP hydrolysis to inhibition by DCCD. In addition, whereas aE80Q is essentially normal with respect to ATP-driven proton translocation, the other mutants and especiallyaE80K showed a diminished ability to generate a proton gradient. Finally, the fluorescence traces of stripped membranes indicated that all of the four mutants have diminished rates of passive proton movement through F0 with aE80K showing the lowest permeability and aE80Q showing a nearly wild type rate. These results suggest that aE80K disrupts to some degree the assembly of the F0 sector, resulting in a reduced level of subunit a and in somewhat altered properties of the assembled complex. The rather low specific activity of the aE80K membranes might be explained by the enhanced inhibition of ATP hydrolysis by ε as is seen in free F1-ATPase. Upon the addition of LDAO, which releases F1 from F0 and from inhibition by ε, the rate was stimulated almost 6-fold compared with ∼3-fold for the wild type. The results also indicate that in the aE80K mutant, some F1 is bound loosely to the membrane. Glu-80 shares some similarities with Glu-196 (34Vik S.B. Cain B.D. Chun K.T. Simoni R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6599-6605Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as a conserved residue on the cytoplasmic side of subunit a that may be involved in shuttling protons at least indirectly to and from the subunit c oligomer. Because of the partial (aE196Q) or substantial (aE80Q) growth yields and rates of proton translocation, these residues cannot be considered as obligatory sites of protonation/deprotonation. Rather, the strength of the effect of the mutations might reflect the relative proximity of these residues to protonation sites in subunit c as well as the nature of the substitution. Whether there is a proton access channel or half-channel from the cytoplasmic surface through subunita to a Asp-61 site in subunit c, the evidence so far indicates that the two cytoplasmic loops rather than transmembrane spans are key elements. In this regard, the two access channels (31Vik S.B. Patterson A.R. Antonio B.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16229-16234Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) would be quite different, because evidence indicates that on the periplasmic side, residues within the transmembrane spans are important for proton translocation. The cross-linking results presented here are the first in which a photoactivated cross-linker was attached to a specific site in subunita and was found to attach covalently to subunitb. The converse reaction from bR36C to subunita using the bifunctional cross-linker benzophenone-4-maleimide was reported by McLachlin et al.(41McLachlin D.T. Coveny A.M. Clark S.M. Dunn S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17571-17577Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), indicating that these subunits have interactions outside the lipid bilayer. Much earlier studies had addressed the role of interactions between subunits a and b. Chemical cross-linking studies had identified the close proximity of these subunits (42Aris J.P. Simoni R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 14599-14609Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 43Hermolin J. Gallant J. Fillingame R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 14550-14555Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The studies by Kumamoto and Simoni (44Kumamoto C.A. Simoni R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 10037-10042Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) showed thataP240A or aP240L could partially suppress the deleterious effects of bG9D, a site that is most probably within the lipid bilayer. The demonstration that antibodies against F1 subunits could co-immunoprecipitate subunitsa and b in stoichiometric complexes (45Vik S.B. Simoni R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 8340-8346Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) suggested strong interactions between the two subunits. The results presented here support the recent findings of McLachlin et al. (41McLachlin D.T. Coveny A.M. Clark S.M. Dunn S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17571-17577Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) that that subunits a and b interact within the cytoplasm and demonstrate that the first cytoplasmic loop of subunit a is involved in those interactions. The role of ana·b2 complex as a stator (30Junge W. Lill H. Engelbrecht S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 420-423Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar) during ATP synthesis or hydrolysis is supported by the finding that proton translocation is not significantly affected by the cross-linking of the two subunits. In summary, the cross-linking and labeling results indicate that this cytoplasmic loop of subunit a is in close proximity to one or both b subunits. An analysis of aE80 mutants is consistent with a role for this residue in interactions with theb subunits. The conservation pattern of aE80 is also consistent with such a role in that this glutamatic acid is conserved among bacteria and chloroplasts, both of which have twob subunits, although it is not conserved among mitochondria ATP synthases that have a single b subunit (47Collinson I.R. Skehel J.M. Fearnley I.M. Runswick M.J. Walker J.E. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 12640-12646Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Furthermore, bacterial and chloroplast b subunits contain a conserved arginine (48Caviston T.L. Ketchum C.J. Sorgen P.L. Nakamoto R.K. Cain B.D.

The remainder of PNG that is not absorbed is likely to be accounted for through fecal losses. This laboratory has examined the intracellular (i.e.cytosolic) hydrolysis of PNG in mammalian small intestinal mucosa. Intestinal cytosolic PNG hydrolysis was initially thought to be catalyzed by a broad specificity β-glucosidase (BSβG) (EC 3.2.1.21) (11Daniels L.B. Coyle P.J. Chiao Y.-B. Glew R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 13004-13013Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a cytosolic enzyme found in the intestine and liver (12Trumbo P.R. Banks M.A. Gregory J.F. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol.

Gregory J.F. J. Nutr. 1995; 125: 2751-2762PubMed Google Scholar). Cytosolic PNG hydrolysis was also reported to be inversely related to vitamin B6 nutritional status in rodents (13Banks M.A. Porter D.W. Martin W.G. Gregory J.F. J. Nutr. Biochem. 1994; 5: 238-242Crossref Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 14Nakano H. Gregory J.F. J. Nutr. 1995; 125: 2751-2762PubMed Google Scholar). To further study cytosolic PNG hydrolysis, this laboratory purified BSβG from pig intestinal mucosa, which led to the identification and subsequent purification of a distinct and novel cytosolic β-glucosidase, designated pyridoxine-5′-β-d-glucoside hydrolase (PNG hydrolase) (15McMahon L.G. Nakano H. Levy M.-D. Gregory J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32025-32033Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). It was found that PNG hydrolase, not BSβG, was responsible for the cytosolic cleavage of PNG. Partial characterization of cytosolic PNG hydrolase revealed its ability to hydrolyze PNG as well as lactose and cellobiose but not sucrose (15McMahon L.G. Nakano H. Levy M.-D. Gregory J.F. J. Biol.

LPH is the only mammalian brush border β-glucosidase; thus, we hypothesize that LPH is responsible for the hydrolysis of PNG, a β-glucoside. LPH has two distinct catalytic active sites, one for the hydrolysis of lactose and flavonoid glucosides and another, phlorizin hydrolase, for the hydrolysis of phlorizin and β-glucosylceramides (19Wacker H.

LPH was purified according to the Triton X-100 solubilization method of Wacker et al. (19Wacker H. Keller P. Falchetto R. Legler G. Semenza G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18744-18752Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with the exceptions of Sephacryl S200 substituted for Sephadex G-200 and omission of the final anti-lactase affinity purification column. During this purification, all materials were kept on ice or at 4 °C. Brush border membrane was isolated from rat intestine for the purification of LPH according to the method of Kessler et al. (22Kessler M. Acuto O. Storelli C. Murer H. Muller M. Semenza G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1978; 506: 136-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (1022) Google Scholar) with some modifications (23Menard M.P. Cousins R.J. J. Nutr. 1983; 113: 1434-1442Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Weanling male and female rats (Hsd:Sprague-Dawley, Harlan, Indianapolis, IN) (n = 45) were used for the purification of LPH. Small intestine was harvested, flushed with 0.9% (w/v) NaCl, and cut longitudinally, and mucosa was scraped with a glass slide, yielding ∼20 g of total mucosa. Electrophoretic characterization of the purified enzyme was performed under denaturing conditions using 8% (w/v) polyacrylamide gels according to Laemmli (24Laemmli E.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207129) Google Scholar) using a mini-gel electrophoresis apparatus from Novex (Invitrogen). A commercially available prestained protein molecular mass standard (Invitrogen) ranging from 10–173 kDa was used. The gel was stained with Simply Blue SafeStain for 1 h followed by destaining overnight in distilled deionized water. The peptide CTLFHFDLPQALEDQG was synthesized with an additional cysteine at the carboxyl terminus and verified by mass spectrometry amino acid analysis by Research Genetics (Huntsville, AL). This peptide was conjugated at the terminally added cysteine residue to maleimide-activated KLH according to the manufacturer's instructions. KLH-conjugated peptide was injected into New Zealand white rabbits (Cocalico Biologicals, Reamstown, PA) for production of polyclonal antiserum. Immunoblotting or Western analyses were done as described by Harlow and Lane (25Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: a Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor1988: 471-510Google Scholar). Purified LPH protein was resolved on an 8% (w/v) SDS-PAGE gel at 130 V for 2 h. The gel was electroblotted to polyvinyldifluoride for 2.5 h at 12 V in a transfer buffer containing 192 mm glycine, 25 mm Tris, 0.05% SDS, 10% methanol. The blot was stained with Amido Black and destained. For the protein detection, the stained blot was cut into strips for different antiserum treatments. Primary antibody treatments included whole immune serum, pre-immune serum, and peptide-competed serum. The peptide-competed serum was prepared by incubating the whole immune serum (0.5 ml) with 10 μg of peptide at room temperature for 1 h prior to application to the blot. The strips were blocked in phosphate-buffered saline (PBST) (137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 5.4 mm Na2HPO4, 1.8 mm KH2PO4, 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20) containing 5% (w/v) nonfat dry milk (NFDM) for 1 h. Primary antibody treatments were applied at 1:500 dilution (in PBST-NFDM) followed by washing with PBST without NFDM and subsequent addition of the secondary antibody (goat anti-rabbit IgG horseradish peroxidase conjugate) at 1:5000 dilution. Unbound secondary antibody was removed by washing with PBST (no NFDM). A chemiluminescent/fluorescent substrate (ECL-Plus) was then applied and incubated at room temperature for 5 min. The excess substrate was blotted away, and protein bands were visualized by fluorescence emission (Storm 840 fluorescent optical scanner; Amersham Biosciences). The standard assay for PNG hydrolytic activity was performed according to Nakano and Gregory (14Nakano H. Gregory J.F. J. Nutr. 1995; 125: 2751-2762PubMed Google Scholar). Standard activity assays for PNG hydrolysis were performed in a reaction mixture containing 10 μg of purified LPH and 0.25 mm PNG in 80 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.0, that was incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. Pyridoxine release was measured using reverse-phase HPLC with fluorometric detection (21Gregory J.F. Nakano H. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 280: 58-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Lactase activity was measured according to the method of Dahlqvist (26Dahlqvist A. Anal. Biochem. 1964; 7: 18-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (1723) Google Scholar) with a modification of the 50 mm maleate buffer to a 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.0, assay buffer. Standard activity assays for the hydrolysis of lactose and other disaccharides were performed using 25 mm disaccharide. Glucose release was quantified using a reagent kit based on the glucose oxidase reaction with colorimetric detection. Phlorizin hydrolase activity was measured by reverse-phase HPLC with UV detection of the aglycone, phloretin (27Rivera-Sagredo A. Canada F.J. Nieto O. Jimenez-Barbero J. Martin-Lomas M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 209: 415-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Standard assay mixtures contained 100 mmphlorizin in 50 mm sodium citrate, pH 5.9. All activity assays were conducted under conditions that allowed measurement of initial rate. For kinetic studies, reactions involving LPH-catalyzed hydrolysis of PNG and lactose were conducted at various concentrations as specified in the text or the table. Experiments examining active site inhibition, along with selective active site protection using 2F-DNPGlc and a glycal (d-glucal), were conducted as described by Dayet al. (18Day A.J. Canada F.J. Diaz J.C. Kroon P.A. McLauchlan R. Faulds C.B. Plumb G.W. Morgan M.R.A. Williamson G. FEBS Lett. 2000; 468: 166-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar) and Arribas et al. (20Arribas J.C.D. Herrero A.G. Martin-Lomas M. Canada F.J., He, S. Withers S.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 6996-7005Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Other potential inhibitors as specified were added to standard reaction mixtures without preincubation of enzyme. Kinetic constants (Km, Vmax, andKi) were calculated by nonlinear regression using SigmaPlot Enzyme Kinetics Module, v 1.0 (SPSS, Inc., San Rafael, CA) software. Protein concentration was determined by a colorimetric method (28Markwell M.A. Haas S.M. Bieber L.L. Tolbert N.E. Anal. Biochem. 1978; 87: 206-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (5326) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as the standard. To obtain molecular mass and fragmentation information regarding a novel reaction product formed during incubation of purified LPH with PNG and lactose, LC-MS and LC-MS/MS analyses were performed in atmospheric pressure chemical ionization mode (APCI) (LC: Hewlett Packard model 1100, Agilent, Palo Alto, CA; and MS: Thermo Finnigan model TSQ7000; San Jose, CA). The HPLC separation was performed isocratically using 5 mm ammonium acetate with 0.1% (v/v) acetic acid as the mobile phase at a flow rate of 0.6 ml/min with a reverse-phase column (C18 Phenosphere, 50 × 4.6 mm, 5 μm column; Phenomenex, Torrance, CA). The analysis was conducted by monitoring ions from 75–600 m/z. For the MS-MS analysis, a collision energy of 30 V was used to fragment the parent mass (M+1) ofm/e 494. LPH from rat small intestinal mucosa was purified 300-fold relative to the lactase activity measured in mucosal crude homogenate. The enzyme was purified to near homogeneity, and the purification was repeated with similar results. The approximate molecular mass of purified LPH by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was 135–140 kDa. In the published method used for purification, an anti-lactase antibody affinity column was used to further separate LPH from aminopeptidase N (molecular mass, 145 kDa) (19Wacker H. Keller P. Falchetto R. Legler G. Semenza G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18744-18752Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This investigation did not use an affinity chromatography purification step to remove peptidase activity. Although aminopeptidase N may not have been separated completely from the final purified LPH, the enrichment of lactase activity from the crude homogenate was consistent with that reported in the purification method (19Wacker H. Keller P. Falchetto R. Legler G. Semenza G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18744-18752Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Staining of the SDS-PAGE revealed two major bands of protein, one at ∼135–140 kDa and another at ∼200–220 kDa (Fig.1A). The band of protein at 135–140 kDa corresponds to mature LPH. The band at 200–220 kDa is consistent with the molecular mass of a precursor form of LPH (29Dudley M.A. Shulman R.J. Reeds P.J. Rosenberger J.N. Putman M. Johnston P.K. Perkinson J.S. Nichols B.L. J. Pediatr. Gastroenterol. Nutr. 1992; 15: 260-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Western analyses were performed to confirm further the relative purity of the enzyme preparation (Fig. 1B). The peptide used for antibody production had amino acid sequence homology with regions in the precursor and mature forms of LPH but no other mammalian intestinal enzymes cataloged in Swiss-Prot and GenBankTM databases. No protein bands were detected in the blot strips incubated with PBST-NFDM alone and the secondary antibody alone (Fig. 1B, lanes 1 and 2, respectively). The whole immune serum-treated strip revealed three immunogenic protein bands (lane 3), which were not visible in the peptide-competed antibody treatment (lane 4). The fourth visible band (∼60 kDa) was found to be an artifact of the antibody under the conditions of this analysis. The band at ∼80 kDa detected by the whole immune serum was also detected by the pre-immune serum, indicating that the recognition of the band by the whole immune serum was not sequence-specific (lane 5). The protein bands at 135–140 and 220–220 kDa that were recognized by this polyclonal antibody appear to be the mature and precursor forms of LPH. However, upon closer inspection of the Coomassie Blue-stained gel, trace amounts of additional high molecular mass bands were observed. Further assays for disaccharidase activity of the purified LPH preparation revealed residual maltase-glucoamylase (EC 3.2.1.20 and 3) at a specific activity of 3.8 μmol/min·mg protein. This activity was controlled for in later kinetic characterization studies. Purified LPH from rat small intestinal mucosa catalyzed the hydrolysis of PNG and followed Michaelis-Menten kinetics. Values for Km,Vmax, and kcat were lower when PNG was used as the substrate as compared with lactose. Values forkcat andVmax/Km indicated that lactose hydrolysis was catalyzed more efficiently than the hydrolysis of PNG (Table I).Table IKinetic parameters of purified rat LPH using PNG and lactose as substratesSubstratePNGLactoseKm(mm)1.0 ± 0.116 ± 1Vmax (μmol/min · mg LPH)0.11 ± 0.015.0 ± 0.1kcat(s−1)1.047kcat/Km(mm−1s−1)1.02.9Vmax/Km0.110.31 Open table in a new tab The substrate PNG exhibited substrate inhibition at concentrations greater than 3 mm (Fig.2). Because of limited availability of PNG, only concentrations ranging from 0.01 to 5 Kmwere tested. The reaction products (glucose and pyridoxine), lactose, and other disaccharides also were tested for inhibitory properties. Pyridoxine (0.5–10 mm) did not inhibit LPH-catalyzed PNG hydrolysis, but the monosaccharide glucose inhibited the reaction at concentrations ≥ 25 mm (Ki equal to 64 ± 5 mm). The primary substrate for LPH, lactose (25–100 mm), inhibited PNG hydrolysis competitively with aKi equal to 56 ± 8 mm (Fig.3). This suggests that the two substrates (PNG and lactose) are hydrolyzed at the same active site. Cellobiose, maltose, lactose, sucrose, and trehalose (25–100 mm) also were added individually to standard reaction mixtures containing PNG (0.01–0.25 mm) and purified LPH. Although sucrose and trehalose did not affect PNG hydrolysis, cellobiose and maltose inhibited the enzymatic release of PN. The inhibition of PNG hydrolysis by maltose was reduced by 35–40% in the presence of 2.0 μm 1-deoxynojirimycin, an inhibitor of maltase-glucoamylase activity (30Breitmeier D. Gunther S. Heymann H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 346: 7-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar).Figure 3Lineweaver-Burk and Michaelis-Menten (inset) plots of LPH-catalyzed hydrolysis of PNG with increasing amounts of lactose as inhibitor.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The inhibitor 2F-DNPGlc binds to both the lactase and phlorizin hydrolase active sites, inhibiting both hydrolytic activities (31Withers S.G. Street I.P. Bird P. Dolphin D.H. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1987; 109: 7530-7531Crossref Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 32Williams S. Withers S.G. Carbohydr. Res. 2000; 327: 27-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). The lactase activity was preserved by preincubation withd-glucal, which yields reversible blockage of the lactase active site (20Arribas J.C.D. Herrero A.G. Martin-Lomas M. Canada F.J., He, S. Withers S.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 6996-7005Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Subsequent addition of 2F-DNPGlc to the glucal-modified LPH led to the selective inhibition of the phlorizin hydrolase active site (20Arribas J.C.D. Herrero A.G. Martin-Lomas M. Canada F.J., He, S. Withers S.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 6996-7005Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). This experimental protocol allowed the contribution of each activity from the respective active sites to be calculated (20Arribas J.C.D. Herrero A.G. Martin-Lomas M. Canada F.J., He, S. Withers S.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 6996-7005Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Hydrolysis of PNG and lactose was reduced 100-fold in the presence of 2F-DNPGlc without glucal as compared with the uninhibited enzyme. Phloretin release was reduced by 85–90% in the presence of 2F-DNPGlc with or without glucal as compared with the activity of the free enzyme. Incubation of purified LPH with glucal prior to the addition of 2F-DNPGlc maintained the hydrolytic activities toward lactose and PNG to 50–65% of the uninhibited enzyme (Fig.4). These findings strongly suggest that PNG was hydrolyzed at the lactase active site of LPH. HPLC analyses of enzyme reaction mixtures containing LPH, PNG (substrate), and lactose (inhibitor) detected not only the product, PN, and the substrate, PNG, but also another fluorescent compound with a retention time of 5.3 min (Fig. 5). The amount of this compound formed was dependent on the concentration of lactose. Initial LC-MS (APCI positive ion mode) analysis of the enzyme reaction mixture showed the unidentified compound to have M+1 ion of 494 (m/z), corresponding to a disaccharide of pyridoxine. This was further supported by an MS/MS experiment on the M+1 ion using a collision energy of 30 V (Fig. 5). In addition to the residual M+1 ion of the disaccharide, major fragments were observed at m/z 332 and 170, corresponding to the M+1 ions of pyridoxine glucoside and pyridoxine (Fig.6). The LC-MS and MS/MS experiments produced the same results when the HPLC-purified disaccharide from the enzyme reaction mixture was utilized. This pyridoxine disaccharide has a pyridoxine molecule with the 5′-β-d-glucoside and another glucose or galactose moiety. Similar to the observation of the pyridoxine disaccharide formed in the presence of lactose, two other disaccharides tested in the LPH inhibition experiments, cellobiose and maltose, also formed fluorescent compounds that exhibited retention times different from that formed with lactose. These compounds, although detectable, were minor in relation to the amount of the PN-disaccharide formed in the presence of lactose and were independent of disaccharide concentration.Figure 6LC-MS/MS analysis in the APCI positive ion mode (MS/MS experiment on the ion at m/e 494; collision energy, 30 V) of the PN-disaccharide product formed during the incubation of LPH with PNG and lactose. The predominant ions are parent molecular ion (M+1) atm/e 494, M+1 ion of pyridoxine glucoside atm/e 332, and M+1 ion of pyridoxine atm/e 170. The other significant ions atm/e 476, 314, and 152 are produced by the loss of water from the respective M+1 ions.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The finding of PNG as a novel substrate for LPH has extended our understanding of mechanisms governing vitamin B6bioavailability and has added to the growing evidence that LPH catalyzes the hydrolysis of not only lactose but other β-glucosides such as plant β-glucans, flavonoid glucosides, and isoflavonoid glucosides (18Day A.J. Canada F.J. Diaz J.C. Kroon P.A. McLauchlan R. Faulds C.B. Plumb G.W. Morgan M.R.A. Williamson G. FEBS Lett. 2000; 468: 166-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar, 33Freund J.-N. Gosse F. Raul F. Enyzme. 1991; 45: 71-74Google Scholar). Dietary PNG exhibits only 50–60% of the bioavailability of free PN as a source of vitamin B6 for humans (3Gregory J.F. Trumbo P.R. Bailey L.B. Toth J.P. Baumgartner T.G. Cerda J.J. J. Nutr. 1991; 121: 177-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 4Nakano H. McMahon L.G. Gregory J.F. J. Nutr. 1997; 127: 1508-1513Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), which is due to incomplete hydrolysis of the glycosidic linkage of PNG. The results reported in the present study suggest that the digestion of PNG may commence at the intestinal brush border where LPH can catalyze the hydrolysis of PNG to release free PN, which is then passively absorbed. This extends our previous findings of the hydrolysis of PNG that can occur immediately after absorption into the cytosolic compartment by PNG hydrolase. This LPH-catalyzed hydrolysis may be an important determinant of the bioavailability of PNG. In populations with lactase deficiency, the hydrolysis, and hence the nutritional utilization of PNG, may be less efficient than in populations that exhibit lactase persistence. LPH was purified from 20-day-old rats to ensure reasonable lactase activity with an adequate amount of starting tissue. The recognition of both the mature and precursor forms of LPH by our antibody in the Western analysis allowed us to verify the qualitative abundance of our purified enzyme. This recognition was sequence-specific, since the pre-immune serum and peptide-competed antibody did not detect the high molecular mass bands that were recognized by the whole immune serum. Values of Km and Vmax(lactose) calculated for purified rat LPH were consistent with published values (27Rivera-Sagredo A. Canada F.J. Nieto O. Jimenez-Barbero J. Martin-Lomas M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 209: 415-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 34Schlegel-Haueter S. Hore P. Kerry K.R. Semenza G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1972; 258: 506-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) (Table I). The kinetic parameters (for lactose and PNG) appeared to be representative of the concentrations of substrates that would be encountered physiologically by LPH. However, under typical dietary conditions, the amount of PNG in digesta entering the small intestine would be in the micromolar concentration range, whereas the concentration of lactose (millimolar range) would greatly exceed that of PNG. The relatively high Km value for PNG (1.0 mm) suggests that LPH has the capacity to hydrolyze physiological concentrations of PNG, but fractional saturation of substrate of the enzyme would be low. Similarly, kinetic ratios also indicated that LPH favors the hydrolysis of lactose over PNG. Although LPH-catalyzed PNG hydrolysis was inhibited by one of its products, glucose, the concentration at which inhibition occurred may not be physiologically relevant (≥25 mm). Accounting for the stoichiometry of the hydrolytic reaction of PNG, the amount of glucose released (micromolar concentration) would not be sufficient to cause product inhibition. However, the glucose released from the hydrolysis of other disaccharides such as lactose may contribute to the observed inhibition by glucose. The observed competitive inhibition of lactose on LPH-catalyzed PNG hydrolysis is consistent with the fact that PNG and lactose are hydrolyzed at the same active site. The inhibition may not have a dramatic effect on bioavailability because foods that contain PNG are of plant origin, which are devoid of lactose. Unless a dairy product and plant-derived food were consumed together, PNG should be at least partially hydrolyzed by LPH. TheKi for lactose (56 ± 8 mm) did not agree with the calculated Km for lactose (16 ± 1 mm). One possible explanation for this discrepancy may be in the formation of alternative pyridoxine glucosides. Some PNG may be diverted from its β-glucosidic hydrolysis process to a trans-glycosylation reaction that yields a pyridoxine disaccharide and a reduction in free PN. Alternatively, PNG may be hydrolyzed to liberate PN, which may undergo enzymatic modification to form PNG or PN-disaccharide. The mechanism of the hydrolysis/trans-glycosylation was not examined further in this study. Cellobiose, although not present in appreciable amounts in the human diet, also is a substrate for LPH (17Skovbjerg H. Sjostrom H. Noren O. Eur. J. Biochem. 1981; 114: 653-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 35Skovbjerg H. Noren O. Sjostrom H. Danielson E.M. Enevoldsen B.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 707: 89-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar); therefore, it was not unexpected that this β-linked disaccharide would also inhibit PNG hydrolysis. The α-disaccharide, maltose, also inhibited the release of PN by LPH, which was not anticipated. The subsequent detection of maltase-glucoamylase activity (EC 3.2.1.20 and EC 3.2.1.3) (36Naim H.Y. Sterchi E.E. Lentze M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 19709-19717Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as a contaminant of the LPH preparation is consistent with the presence of minor high molecular mass protein bands (200–220 kDa) faintly stained in the SDS-PAGE. Western analysis using our antibody that was sequence-specific to LPH but not maltase-glucoamylase showed that the more prominently stained high molecular mass band was likely to be a precursor form of LPH and not maltase-glucoamylase. Despite the relatively low abundance of the maltase-glucoamylase contaminant, its hydrolytic activity toward maltose had an effect on LPH-catalyzed PNG hydrolysis. What appeared to be the inhibition of PN release actually may have been the LPH-catalyzed formation of another maltose- or glucose-derived pyridoxine oligosaccharide from PN, PNG, or both. Alternatively, the hydrolysis of maltose released monosaccharide units (d-glucose), which could inhibit PNG hydrolysis as catalyzed by LPH. Maltase-glucoamylase activity was reduced by 63% in the presence of 2.0 μm 1-deoxynojirimycin without affecting lactose hydrolysis. In reaction mixtures containing LPH, PNG, maltose (≥25 mm), and deoxynojirimycin, the release of PN was increased by an average of 35%, and the formation of other pyridoxine disaccharides was decreased compared with reactions without deoxynojirimycin. Increasing the concentration of 1-deoxynojirimycin likely may have negated this inhibition; however, at higher concentrations deoxynojirimycin also is a competitive inhibitor of lactase (19Wacker H. Keller P. Falchetto R. Legler G. Semenza G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18744-18752Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although maltase-glucoamylase was present in the purified LPH preparation, it appears that it does not alter the kinetics of PNG hydrolysis in the absence of α-disaccharides. This is further supported by the inhibition experiment with β-glucosidase inhibitor 2F-DNPGlc. When LPH is inhibited completely with this fluoroglucoside, the release of PN is negligible, indicating that maltase-glucoamylase alone is not capable of hydrolyzing PNG. Maltase-glucoamylase that had been co-purified with lactase by papain solubilization from 15-day-old rat intestine was reported to have a final specific activity of 36 μmol/min·mg protein in another study (34Schlegel-Haueter S. Hore P. Kerry K.R. Semenza G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1972; 258: 506-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), which is ∼10× the specific activity measured in the current study. Fluoroglucosides are used widely as general inhibitors of β-glucosidases (32Williams S. Withers S.G. Carbohydr. Res. 2000; 327: 27-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). 2F-DNPGlc is a mechanism-based inhibitor of β-glucosidases, and it exerts its effect by forming a stable covalent linkage of the 2′-position of the fluoroglucoside to glutamic acid residues at the active sites of LPH. The use of glucal in conjunction with the inhibitor in the protocol allows individual examination of the lactase and phlorizin hydrolase active sites on LPH (20Arribas J.C.D. Herrero A.G. Martin-Lomas M. Canada F.J., He, S. Withers S.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 6996-7005Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The deglycosylation of flavonoid and isoflavonoid glucosides was studied using this same experimental procedure (18Day A.J. Canada F.J. Diaz J.C. Kroon P.A. McLauchlan R. Faulds C.B. Plumb G.W. Morgan M.R.A. Williamson G. FEBS Lett. 2000; 468: 166-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar). Inhibition of the phlorizin hydrolase site with 2F-DNPGlc did not diminish the hydrolysis of the quercetin glucosides. Similar to the results reported for the flavonoid and isoflavonoid glucosides (18Day A.J. Canada F.J. Diaz J.C. Kroon P.A. McLauchlan R. Faulds C.B. Plumb G.W. Morgan M.R.A. Williamson G. FEBS Lett. 2000; 468: 166-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar), we concluded that PNG is hydrolyzed at the lactase active site of LPH. Various pyridoxine glucosides, including several pyridoxine oligosaccharide derivatives, are known to exist widely in nature (37Gregory J.F. Esen A. β-Glucosidases: Biochemistry and Molecular Biology. American Chemical Society, Washington1993: 113-131Google Scholar); however, the formation of pyridoxine disaccharide catalyzed by enzymes in the small intestine has not been reported. Future research will address the nutritional significance of LPH hydrolysis of PNG, with particular attention to the vitamin in human LPH expression and activity and the inhibition of PNG hydrolysis by lactose."

Electrophoretic mobility shift assay showed specific binding of pituitary nuclear extracts to radiolabeled GAGA oligonucleotides, which increased following restraint stress in rats, a condition associated with V1bR up-regulation. DNA-binding activity involved a protein complex because it was abolished by deoxycholate. Size-exclusion column chromatography showed a complex of 127 kDa, which dissociated into ∼70-kDa components after deoxycholate/Nonidet P-40 treatment. This study demonstrates that interactions of GAGA-binding proteins with the GAGA box of the V1bR promoter activate V1bR gene expression and provides a potential mechanism for physiological regulation of V1bR transcription. adrenocorticotropic hormone V1b receptor reverse transcription electrophoretic mobility shift assay fast performance liquid chromatography The hypothalamic nonapeptide arginine vasopressin is an important regulator of pituitary ACTH1secretion (1Antoni F.A. Front. Neuroendocrinol. 1993; 14: 76-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar, 2Aguilera G. Front. Neuroendocrinol. 1994; 15: 321-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar). The pituitary actions of vasopressin are mediated by vasopressin receptors of the V1b subtype (V1bR), located in the plasma membrane of the pituitary corticotroph (3Jard S. Barberis C. Audigier S. Tribollet E. Prog. Brain Res. 1987; 72: 173-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The vasopressin V1bR is a G protein-coupled receptor associated with phospholipase C/calcium/phospholipid-dependent signaling mechanisms (4Gallo-Payet N. Guillon G. Balestre M.N. Jard S. Endocrinology. 1986; 119: 1042-1047Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). This receptor is structurally different from the V1a receptor, which mediates vasoconstrictor and metabolic actions of vasopressin, and the V2 receptor responsible for water conservation in the kidney, which is coupled to adenylate cyclase (5Lolait S.J. O'Carroll A.M. McBride O.W. Konig M. Morel A. Brownstein M.J. Nature. 1992; 357: 336-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). Previous studies have shown that a good correlation exists between vasopressin binding and pituitary responsiveness, suggesting that the number of vasopressin V1b receptors in the corticotroph plays an important role in determining the sensitivity of the ACTH responses during stress (6Rabadan-Diehl C. Lolait S.J. Aguilera G. J. Neuroendocrinol. 1995; 7: 903-910Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 7Aguilera G. Pham Q. Rabadan-Diehl C. J.

To study the regulation of the V1bR, we (10Rabadan-Diehl C. Lolait S. Aguilera G. J. Neuroendocrinol. 2000; 12: 437-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) and others (9Nomura A. Iwasaki Y.

Physiol. 2001; 280: E780-E787PubMed Google Scholar) have recently isolated and characterized the 5′-flanking region of the rat V1bR. Computer analysis of the putative promoter region (bp −2161 to +377, corresponding to 2.1 kb of the putative promoter, exon 1, intron 1, and 164 bp of exon 2) showed no TATA box, but several potential sites for glucocorticoid, AP1, and cAMP regulation. In addition, the promoter region of the rat V1bR includes structural features not common in G protein-coupled receptors, such as CA repeats (CACA box) and an unusually large stretch of 134 CT repeats (inverted GAGA box). GAGA repeats were first described in Drosophila heat shock protein and histone gene promoters, where they were found to bind a protein called the GAGA factor, encoded by the essentialTrithorax-like (Trl) gene (11Farkas G. Gausz J. Galloni M. Reuter G. Gyurkovics H. Karch F. Nature. 1994; 371: 806-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar, 12Biggin M.D. Tjian R.

The GAGA factor has been implicated in chromatin structure and remodeling and normal expression of several developmental genes inDrosophila (11Farkas G. Gausz J. Galloni M. Reuter G. Gyurkovics H.

Development. 1996; 122: 1113-1124Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Involvement of GAGA-binding protein in transcription has also been reported for vertebrate genes such as the serine protease inhibitor-2.1 gene, the type 1 angiotensin II receptor gene, and the Xenopus stromelysin-3 gene (16Simar-Blanchet A.E. Legraverend C. Thissen J.P. Le Cam A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 391-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 17Wyse B.D. Linas S.L. Thekkumkara T.J. J. Mol.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 3018-3025Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The consensus GAGA binding sequence consists of ∼3.5 GA repeats, but longer repeats have been described in some promoters, including hsp26, hsp70, his3, andhis4 (13Gilmour D.S. Thomas G.H. Elgin S.C. Science. 1989; 245: 1487-1490Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 19Granok H. Leibovitch B.A. Shaffer C.D. Elgin S.C. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 238-241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Because the V1bR promoter contains a prominent GAGA box near the transcriptional start point (10Rabadan-Diehl C. Lolait S. Aguilera G. J. Neuroendocrinol. 2000; 12: 437-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), in this study, we address the question whether a GAGA-binding protein plays a role in V1bR transcription. Using V1bR promoter-driven luciferase constructs and aDrosophila GAGA expression vector in rat H32 hypothalamic cells, which express endogenous V1b receptors, we provide evidence that a GAGA-binding protein complex is involved in the transcriptional regulation of the V1bR. A construct containing a 2.5-kbNcoI fragment of the V1bR gene from bp −2161 to +377 (+1 was assigned to the proximal transcriptional start point; corresponding to 2.1 kb of the putative promoter, exon 1, intron 1, and 164 bp of exon 2) cloned into the luciferase reporter vector pGL3-basic (Promega) (10Rabadan-Diehl C. Lolait S. Aguilera G. J. Neuroendocrinol. 2000; 12: 437-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) was used to prepare the following restriction fragments of the V1bR promoter: a 830-bp fragment (bp −453 to +377; obtained bySmaI digestion) spanning the SmaI sites in the multiple cloning site of the vector and bp −453 in the V1bR promoter region, a 670-bp fragment (bp −294 to +377; produced byBglII digestion) from the multiple cloning site to theBglII site at bp −294 in the V1bR promoter, and a 470-bp fragment (bp −90 to +377; obtained by digestion with MluII) from the multiple cloning site to BssHI at bp −90 in the V1bR promoter region. The restriction fragments were separated on a 1% agarose gel; the bands were excised; and the DNA was eluted using a QIAquick gel extraction kit (QIAGEN Inc., Valencia, CA) and ligated using T4 DNA ligase (Promega) into pGL3-basic to obtain the constructs pGL3-V1bRp830, pGL3-V1bRp670, and pGL3-V1bRp470, respectively. An additional construct, pGL3-V1bRp830ΔGAGA (bp −453 to −303 and bp −90 to +377), was created byBglII/BssHII digestion of pGL3-V1bRp830 and ligation after generation of blunt ends using PfuTurbo® (Stratagene). The Drosophila GAGA factor cDNA was obtained by PCR from a clone in the pET-14b vector (kindly provided by Dr. Jordi Bernues, Departamento de Biologia Molecular Cellular, Instituto de Biologia Molecular, Barcelona, Spain). The cDNA fragment (pCR3.1-GAGA construct) was generated using primers 5′-ggcagccatatgtcgctgccaa-3′ (forward) and 5′-cgggctttgttagcagccggat-3′ (reverse), spanning 13 bp of the pET-14b vector and 9 bp of the 3′-untranslated region of Drosophila GAGA, and subcloned into the mammalian expression vector pCR3.1 (Invitrogen). PCR was performed using 100 ng of plasmid template DNA and 2.5 units of Platinum® Pfx DNA polymerase (Invitrogen). Amplification was performed using an initial cycle at 94 °C for 2 min, followed by 30 PCR cycles at 94 °C for 30 s, 65 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min and a 10-min final extension at 72 °C. The ligation reaction was used to transform TOP 10F′ competent cells (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's protocol. All constructs were purified using Wizard Plus® Miniprep (Promega) or Maxiprep (QIAGEN) procedures. The accuracy of the PCR product was verified by sequencing (Veritas, Rockville, MD). Male Sprague-Dawley rats (Harlan Sprague Dawley, Inc., Indianapolis, IN) weighing 250–300 g were housed three per cage in a controlled environment with free access to food and water. After at least a 5-day stabilization period, rats were killed by decapitation, and tissues were removed and rapidly frozen on dry ice for preparation of nuclear extracts. To determine whether the up-regulation of the V1bR observed after stress (6Rabadan-Diehl C. Lolait S.J. Aguilera G. J. Neuroendocrinol. 1995; 7: 903-910Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) is associated with changes in GAGA-binding activity, groups of rats were subjected to restraint stress for 15–90 min using 2.5 × 6-inch plastic restrainers (20Hauger R.L. Lorang M. Irwin M. Aguilera G. Brain Res. 1990; 532: 34-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Rats were killed by decapitation 15, 30, and 90 min after initiation of the stress. Pituitaries were rapidly removed, dissected from the neurointermediate lobes, and frozen in dry ice for nuclear protein extraction. Fragments of liver from control and stressed rats were collected as a control. The hypothalamic cell line H32 (produced by Dr. Joachim Spiess, Max Planck Institute for Experimental Medicine, Göttingen, Germany) (21Mugele K. Kugler H. Spiess J. DNA Cell Biol. 1993; 12: 119-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) was cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), 10% horse serum, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen). Preliminary experiments in our laboratory using RT-PCR showed that this hypothalamic cell line expresses V1bR mRNA. 2M. Nikodemova, S. Volpi, J. Spiess, and G. Aguilera, unpublished data. Cells were plated in 24-wells plates at a density of 20 × 103 cells/well and cultured at 37 °C under 5% CO2 and 95% air. After 24 h of culture, cells were transfected with 0.4 μg of DNA (pGL3-V1bRp (deletion constructs) or the empty vector pGL3-basic) using LipofectAMINE Plus®(Invitrogen). For cotransfection experiments, cells were transfected either with 0.4 μg of reporter plasmid pGL3-V1bRp, pGL3-V1bRp830, or pGL3-V1bRp830ΔGAGA and 25–50 ng of pCR3.1-GAGA or the empty expression vector. After transfection, H32 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 2.5% fetal bovine serum/horse serum for 24 h and then lysed using 1× reporter lysis buffer (Promega) and processed for luciferase assay (Promega). To determine whether differences in transfection efficiency could account for the increases in promoter activity of the V1bR promoter-luciferase deletion constructs, the amount of luciferase DNA was quantitated by Southern blot analysis after transfection of pGL3-V1bRp2.5, pGL3-V1bRp830, and pGL3-V1bRp670 into H32 cells. A33P-radiolabeled luciferase probe was prepared by random primer labeling of a HindIII/XbaI restriction fragment of pGL3-basic purified on a 1% agarose gel. Fifty ng of luciferase DNA were denatured by heating for 3 min at 95 °C, immediately placed on ice for 2 min, added to reaction mixture beads (Ready-To-GoTM DNA labeling beads (without dCTP),Amersham Biosciences) together with 50 μCi of [α-33P]dCTP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. The labeled probe was purified using a Sephadex G-25 column (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Cells plated in 10-mm Petri dishes to 70% confluence were transfected with 4 μg of DNA. One day after transfection, cells were removed from the dish and washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, and the pellets were resuspended in lysis buffer (87.5% Tris/EDTA (pH 8), 1% SDS, and 0.5 mg/ml proteinase K) and incubated overnight at 37 °C. Cellular DNA was purified by extracting three times with phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1), followed by ethanol precipitation and resuspension in diethyl pyrocarbonate/water. Ten μg of DNA were digested with 20 units of NcoI enzyme and separated on a 0.8% agarose gel containing 1× Tris acetate/EDTA. DNA loading was quantified from the ethidium bromide staining of the gel using Kodak 1D image analysis software. For Southern blot analysis, the gel was washed with HCl (1:50) for 15 min, followed by 2 × 15-min rinses in DNA-denaturing solution and 2 × 10-min rinses in DNA-neutralizing solution (purchased from Quality Biological, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD). DNA was transferred overnight from the gel into Tropilon PlusTM (positively charged nylon membrane; Tropix Inc., Bedford, MA) by capillary using 10× SSC. After UV cross-linking, the membrane was incubated in prehybridization buffer (50% formamide, 5× saline/sodium phosphate/EDTA, 5× Denhardt's solution, 0.5% SDS, and 0.1 mg/ml salmon sperm DNA) for 3 h at 42 °C. Hybridization was conducted overnight at 42 °C in the same buffer containing 2 × 107 dpm of the luciferase probe. The membrane was washed twice at room temperature with 2× SSC and at 63 °C for 30 min with 2× SSC and 0.5% SDS. Bands were visualized and quantified using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager after overnight exposure at room temperature. For quantitative RT-PCR of V1bR mRNA, cells were plated in 10-mm culture dishes, transfected with 4 μg of pCR3.1-GAGA expression vector or the empty vector pCR3.1, and cultured for 24 h before mRNA isolation using RNAzolTM B (Tel-test, Inc.) following the manufacturer's protocol. Poly(A)+ RNA was isolated from the total RNA using oligo(dT) PolyATtract mRNA isolation systems (Promega). RNA was subjected to digestion with 1 unit of DNase I, Amplification Grade (Invitrogen) to eliminate contaminant endogenous DNA and quantified by UV spectrometry. Five aliquots of each poly(A)+ preparation (50–100 ng) were used for synthesis of double-stranded DNA and PCR amplification using the SUPERSCRIPTTM One-Step RT-PCR PlatinumTM Taq system (Invitrogen) and rat V1bR primers 5′-ggatgagaatgcccccaatgaaga-3′ (forward) and 5′-gagagagagtggcccatacctaca-3′ (reverse). Rat cyclophilin primers used as internal controls were as follows: 5′-tgggaaggtgaaagaagg-3′ (forward) and 5′-gctagacttgaaggggaatg-3′ (reverse). Single-stranded cDNA was synthesized at 55 °C for 30 min, followed by 3 min at 94 °C. The five aliquots of each sample were subjected to a different number of PCR cycles (20, 25, 30, 35, and 40) to determine the linear range for quantification of the endogenous rat V1bR after transfection with Drosophila GAGA protein. Each cycle consisted of 40 s at 94 °C, 40 s at 58 °C, and 40 s at 72 °C, followed by a 10-min extension at 72 °C. The PCR products were separated and visualized on a 2% Tris acetate/EDTA-agarose gel containing ethidium bromide and sized using PCR markers (Promega). The image was captured electronically, and the bands were quantified using Kodak 1D image analysis software. Nuclear extracts from different rat tissues were prepared using NE-PERTM nuclear and cytoplasmic extraction reagent (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's protocol using a final concentration of 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Sigma) and 100× protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma). Protein concentration was quantified by spectrophotometry using the Bio-Rad protein assay. Double-stranded oligonucleotide probes were synthesized as complementary single strands (Sigma) and annealed at 80 °C for 20 min, followed by slow cooling to room temperature overnight. Aliquots of 25 pmol of GAGA or mutant GAGA double-stranded oligonucleotides were end-labeled using T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs Inc.) and 50 pmol of [γ-33P]ATP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for 45 min at 37 °C in a total volume of 50 μl. The labeled GAGA and mutant probes were purified by centrifugation on a Sephadex G-25 column. The sequences of the probes contained three to five GAGA repeats, and upstream and downstream sequences flanking the GAGA box in the V1bR promoter were as follows: GAGA probe, GTGACA(GAGA)3 or (GAGA)5GGGAAA; (GAGA)3 mutant probe, GTGACAGTCACCGATTGTGGGAAA. The incubation mixture contained 0.5–10 μg of nuclear extract, 25 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 0.5 mm EDTA, 12.5 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 125 mm KCl, 0.05 μg/μl poly(dI-dC), and 1 μg/μl bovine serum albumin (Sigma) in a total volume of 20 μl. One ng of radiolabeled oligonucleotide was added to the reaction and incubated for 20 min at room temperature. For competition, unlabeled oligonucleotides (5-, 10-, 30-, and 50-fold) were added prior to incubation with the probe. When necessary, binding reactions were performed in the presence of sodium deoxycholate (Sigma) and/or Nonidet P-40 (Fluka). Comparison of GAGA-binding activity between control and stressed rats was performed using 1 μg of nuclear extract protein prepared from pools of two anterior pituitaries. In these experiments, protein concentrations were determined using the sensitive BCA protein assay (Pierce) before and after adjusting the protein concentration to 0.3 μg/μl. Reaction products were electrophoresed on a 5% polyacrylamide gel (29:1 acrylamide/bisacrylamide) in 0.5× Tris borate/EDTA at room temperature for 90 min at 150 V. Gels were vacuum heat-dried, and bands were visualized and quantified using the Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager after 2 h of exposure at room temperature. To determine the apparent molecular mass of the GAGA-binding protein complex, ∼500 μg of rat pituitary nuclear extract in 250 μl were subjected to size-exclusion chromatography on a Sephadex G-75 column using an FPLC system (Amersham Biosciences) at 4 °C. The column was equilibrated with buffer containing 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 20% (v/v) glycerol, 100 mmKCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, and 0.5 mm dithiothreitol at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min and then calibrated by multiple runs with protein standards (ribonuclease A (13.7 kDa), chymotrypsinogen A (25 kDa), ovalbumin (43 kDa), and albumin (67 kDa); Amersham Biosciences). A standard curve was obtained from a plot of the distribution coefficient K av versus log(molecular mass). The nuclear extract, diluted in the equilibration buffer, was then run on the column, and fractions of 400 μl were collected for analysis of GAGA-binding activity by EMSA. Prior to each run, freshly prepared 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride (0.5 mm; ICN, Costa Mesa, CA) was added to the equilibration buffer to prevent low level proteolysis of the nuclear proteins during the runs. To test whether the apparent mass of the binding activity could be shifted in the presence of 0.8% deoxycholate (a mild ionic detergent known to disrupt protein-protein interaction), the fractionation was repeated in the presence of this detergent, and the fractions were analyzed for GAGA-binding activity after reconstitution of the proteins with Nonidet P-40. The apparent molecular masses of the peaks of GAGA-binding activity were calculated using the standard curve. A 2.5-kb fragment of the 5′-flanking region of the rat V1bR containing 2.1 kb upstream of the transcriptional start point, exon 1, intron 1, and 164 bp of exon 2 was previously shown to have promoter activity in several heterologous cell lines (10Rabadan-Diehl C. Lolait S. Aguilera G. J. Neuroendocrinol. 2000; 12: 437-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). To determine the minimal promoter sequence required for transcriptional activation, we examined the activity of the full-length 2.5-kb fragment and several deletion fragments linked to a luciferase reporter gene after transfection into the hypothalamic cell line H32 (21Mugele K. Kugler H. Spiess J. DNA Cell Biol. 1993; 12: 119-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), which expresses V1bR mRNA. As shown in Fig.1 A, the 2.5-kb construct (V1bRp2.5-Luc) showed 5-fold higher luciferase activity than the pGL3-basic empty vector. In addition, as previously described in other cell lines (10Rabadan-Diehl C. Lolait S. Aguilera G. J. Neuroendocrinol. 2000; 12: 437-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), a V1bR promoter construct lacking the intron had no promoter activity in H32 cells (data not shown). The 830- and 670-bp proximal fragments (V1bRp830-Luc and V1bRp670-Luc, respectively) showed significantly higher luciferase activity than the full-length 2.5-kb fragment, with 11- and 12.5-fold increases, respectively. To determine whether the higher luciferase activity was due to higher promoter activity or to an increase in transfection efficiency, we used Southern blot analysis to evaluate the amount of plasmid DNA after transfection of H32 cells with the V1bRp2.5-Luc, V1bRp830-Luc, and V1bRp670-Luc constructs. The transfection efficiency of V1bRp830-Luc and V1bRp670-Luc was similar to that of the 2.5-kb construct, indicating that V1bRp830-Luc and V1bRp670-Luc have higher promoter activity (Fig.1, B–D). The 470-bp proximal fragment lacking the GAGA box had no promoter activity. This suggests the presence of repressor elements upstream of bp −294 and that the region between bp −294 and +377 (containing an AP2 site, the GAGA and CACA boxes, and intron 1) is responsible for minimal promoter activity. Deletion of the GAGA box (bp −303 to −90; V1bRp830ΔGAGA) from the 830-bp construct abolished promoter activity, suggesting that the GAGA box is important for V1bR gene transcription. To determine whether a recognized GAGA-binding protein can affect V1bR promoter activity, we cotransfected the 2.5-kb V1bR promoter-luciferase construct (V1bRp2.5-Luc) with an expression vector containing theDrosophila GAGA factor (pCR3.1-GAGA) into H32 cells. As shown in Fig. 2, cotransfection of V1bRp2.5-Luc and pCR3.1-GAGA into H32 cells caused a 11-fold increase in luciferase activity compared with cotransfection with the empty expression vector. Cotransfection of pCR3.1-GAGA had no effect on luciferase activity of the pGL3-basic empty reporter vector. Deletion of the GAGA repeats in the V1bR promoter significantly decreased basal V1bR promoter activity and abolished the stimulatory effect of theDrosophila GAGA factor. Because H32 cells express endogenous V1bR, we investigated the effect of Drosophila GAGA-binding protein on the expression of the endogenous V1bR gene. To address this issue, we transfected H32 cells with the pCR3.1 empty vector or the construct containing the GAGA protein (pCR3.1-GAGA) and measured V1bR mRNA by quantitative RT-PCR using cyclophilin as a control and under conditions yielding PCR products for both genes in the linear range. As shown in Fig. 3 (A and B), transfection of Drosophila GAGA had no effect on the 250-bp cyclophilin band, but it increased the 509-bp band corresponding to the V1bR mRNA by 6-fold. Similar increases in endogenous V1bR mRNA were found after transfection of MCF-7 cells with theDrosophila GAGA factor (data not shown). To determine whether the V1bR GAGA box interacts with pituitary nuclear proteins, we performed EMSA after incubation of pituitary nuclear extracts with (GAGA)3 or (GAGA)5 repeat oligonucleotides flanked by the sequences found in the V1bR promoter. A shifted band of increasing intensity was observed with increasing amounts of nuclear extract from 0.5 to 3 μg; binding maintained a plateau up to 10 μg of protein. A similar binding pattern was observed using either the (GAGA)3 or (GAGA)5 repeat probe, but the amount of probe shifted was higher for the (GAGA)5oligonucleotide than for the (GAGA)3 repeats (Fig.4). Binding of pituitary nuclear extracts to radiolabeled (GAGA)3 and (GAGA)5 repeats was effectively competed by the homologous unlabeled oligonucleotide (Fig.5 A). For both probes, addition of five times the molar concentration of unlabeled oligonucleotides caused ∼80% inhibition of the shifted bands. A progressive but slower binding inhibition was observed with higher concentrations of unlabeled oligonucleotide, with ∼5% of the binding remaining in the presence of 50 times the molar concentration of competitors (Fig.5 B). In contrast, no inhibition of the binding of the (GAGA)3 probe to nuclear proteins was observed after addition of a mutant oligonucleotide (Fig. 5 C). Furthermore, the radiolabeled mutant oligonucleotide did not bind nuclear proteins (Fig. 5 C). The time course of the binding of GAGA repeat oligonucleotides to pituitary nuclear proteins is shown in Fig.6 A. Binding was already marked after 3 min, reached equilibrium by 18 min, and maintained a plateau for up to 1 h. Consistent with the data in Fig. 4, using equimolar concentrations of probe, the percentage of radiolabeled probe shifted was much higher for the (GAGA)5 repeat oligonucleotide. Dissociation of DNA-protein complexes by addition of the competitor at the time when binding of radiolabeled (GAGA)3oligonucleotides to pituitary nuclear extracts had reached equilibrium was very rapid. One min after addition of unlabeled (GAGA)3and (GAGA)5 repeats, 55 and 63% binding inhibition was already observed, respectively (Fig. 6 B). A slow further decline in binding was observed from 1 to 16 min after addition of the competitor. GAGA-binding activity was not confined to pituitary nuclear proteins, but was present in nuclear extracts from a number of rat tissues (Fig. 7). The highest binding was observed in the brain cortex, hypothalamus, and kidney, followed by moderate binding in the pituitary, liver, thymus, and ovary and very low binding in the spleen.Figure 7Gel shift assay (A) and quantitative analysis of bands (B) following incubation of the (GAGA)3 repeat probe with nuclear extracts from different rat tissues.

PhosphorImager analysis of the shifted bands revealed an increase in binding of pituitary nuclear proteins from stressed rats to radiolabeled GAGA oligonucleotides compared with nuclear extracts from non-stressed control rats. The increases in binding were minor by 15 min, reached a significant 40% by 30 min, and declined again by 90 min (Fig. 8). In contrast, no increases in intensity of the shifted bands were observed in EMSA using liver nuclear extracts (data not shown). To determine whether the GAGA-binding activity observed in pituitary nuclear extracts involves a single protein or a protein complex, binding of the nuclear extracts to the radiolabeled GAGA oligonucleotide was performed in the presence of increasing concentrations of sodium deoxycholate. It has been shown that this treatment dissociates protein-protein complexes without affecting DNA-protein interaction, an effect that is revers"

Throughout evolution, the functional diversity of the Mediator complex has been enhanced to meet the increasing requirements for sophisticated gene regulation. It is likely that greater structural complexity is thus required to accomplish these new, complex regulatory functions. In this study, we took systematic steps to examine various types of Mediator complexes in Drosophila melanogaster. Such efforts led to the identification of three distinct forms of Mediator complexes. In exploring their compositional and functional heterogeneity, we found that the smallest complex (C1) is highly enriched in a certain type of Drosophila cells and possesses novel Mediator proteins. The subunits shared among the three Mediator complexes (C1, C2, and C3) appear to form a stable modular structure that serves as a binding surface for transcriptional activator proteins. However, only C2 and C3 were able to support activated transcription in vitro. These findings suggest that different cell types may require distinct Mediator complexes, some of which may participate in nuclear processes other than the previously identified functions.

RNA polymerase II matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight glutathione S-transferase soluble nuclear fraction transcription factor Eukaryotic gene transcription is driven by RNA polymerase II (pol II)1 and ancillary basal transcription factors and is controlled at multiple levels by several classes of multisubunit co-regulator complexes (1Lemon B.

Intriguingly, metazoan Mediator complexes are more intricate than yeast Mediator and show structural diversity that may reflect the elaborate mechanisms for transcriptional regulation observed in higher eukaryotes (13Malik S. Roeder R.G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 277-283Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). To fully decipher the mechanisms by which Mediator regulates transcription, two aspects of the heterogeneity of Mediator complexes (functional and compositional) must be considered. With respect to functional multiplicity, Mediator complexes behave as both positive and negative transcriptional signal integrators. In yeast, individual activators and repressors interact with distinct subunits of Mediator (14Park J.M. Kim H.-S. Han S.J. Hwang M.S. Lee Y.C. Kim Y.-J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8709-8719Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 15Han S.J. Lee J.-S. Kang J.-S. Kim Y-J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37020-37026Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Thus, both the positive and negative regulatory functions appear to coexist in the same complex. Human Mediator complexes were also shown to carry out diverse transcription-related functions (6Gu W. Malik S. Ito M. Yuan C.-Z. Fondell J.D. Zhang X. Martinez E. Qin J. Roeder R.G. Mol.

Heterogeneity of Mediator complexes is also detectable in their subunit compositions. Mammalian Mediator complexes share some subunits, but also have complex-specific components (6Gu W. Malik S. Ito M. Yuan C.-Z. Fondell J.D. Zhang X. Martinez E. Qin J. Roeder R.G. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 97-108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 8Näär A.M. Beaurang P.A.

Recently, a small core form of Mediator was identified in yeast nuclear extracts (18Liu Y. Ranish J.A. Aebersoldi R. Hahn S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7169-7175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). However, whether the identification of this small Mediator in human and yeast indeed reflects the heterogeneity of Mediator complexes in vivo has yet to be determined. Drosophila embryo nuclear extracts have been shown to contain a 2-MDa complex (dMediator) that is homologous to the larger yeast and human Mediator complexes (12Park J.M. Gim B.S. Kim J.M. Yoon J.H. Kim H.-S. Kang J.-G. Kim Y.-J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 2312-2323Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Whether distinctDrosophila Mediator complexes that differ from dMediator in subunit composition and/or function exist in these nuclear extracts is unknown. In this study, we scrutinized nuclear extracts prepared from different types of Drosophila cells in an attempt to identify as yet uncharacterized Mediator complexes. Such efforts led to the discovery of three chromatographically distinct Mediator complexes. We present the biochemical properties of these Mediator complexes and the identification of novel Mediator proteins that are conserved in human cells. SL2 (Schneider line-2) cells were grown in serum-free medium to a density of 8 × 106 cells. SL2 cell nuclei were isolated as described previously (19Dignam J.D. Martin P.L. Shastry B.S. Roeder R.G. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 101: 582-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (744) Google Scholar). The nuclei were resuspended in 4 packed nuclear volumes of buffer containing 15 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.6), 110 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm sodium metabisulfite. An aliquot (0.1 volume) of 4 mammonium sulfate (pH 7.0) was added to the nuclear suspension, which was then mixed by rotation for 20 min. After centrifugation at 35,000 rpm for 1 h in a Ti-45 rotor (Beckman Instruments), the supernatant was decanted, mixed with 0.3 g of ammonium sulfate/1 ml of supernatant, and stirred. After centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 30 min in a JA-25.50 rotor (Beckman Instruments), the pellet was resuspended in buffer containing 50 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.6), 10% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 100 mm potassium acetate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitors. Mediator complexes enriched in the SL2 cell extracts were purified by a series of column chromatography steps as described (12Park J.M. Gim B.S. Kim J.M. Yoon J.H. Kim H.-S. Kang J.-G. Kim Y.-J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 2312-2323Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The peak fractions of Mediator proteins were pooled and incubated with anti-dSOH1 (where “d” is Drosophila), anti-dMED6, or anti-Trfp antibody beads. The beads were washed with buffer containing 20 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.6), 10% glycerol, 0.1 mmEDTA, and 300 mm potassium acetate containing 0.2% Nonidet P-40, and the bound proteins were eluted twice with 0.1 mglycine (pH 2.5). The eluted fractions were neutralized with 0.1 volume 1.0 m Tris-HCl (pH 8.8). The gel slices of Coomassie Blue-stained protein bands were excised and subjected to in-gel tryptic digestion. Peptide mixtures were analyzed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry using a delayed ion extraction and ion mirror reflector mass spectrometer (Voyager-DE STR, Applied Biosystems, Inc.). For interpretation of the mass spectra, we used the Ms-Fit program. 2Available at www.prospector.ucsf.edu/. pol II complexes were purified from SL2 cells expressing FLAG-tagged dRPB9 by conventional and affinity chromatography. Mediator protein-containing complexes in the Mono S fractions were incubated with purified core pol II in buffer A (25 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.6), 20% glycerol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 12.5 mm magnesium acetate, 100 mm potassium acetate, 1.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, and protease inhibitors) for 5 h. Then, 10 μl of anti-FLAG antibody M2-agarose pre-equilibrated with buffer A was added and allowed to interact with FLAG-tagged protein complexes for 12 h at 4 °C with constant inversion. The resin was washed with buffer A, and bound proteins were eluted with SDS gel sample buffer. GST fusion proteins used in GST pull-down assays were expressed inEscherichia coli and purified on glutathione-Sepharose resin (Amersham Biosciences) as described (20Lee Y.C. Park J.M. Min S. Han S.J. Kim Y.-J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2967-2976Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Ten microliters of the beads, which retained 1 μg of each GST fusion protein, was incubated with35S-labeled proteins synthesized in TnT reticulocyte lysates (Promega). The beads were washed, and bound proteins were analyzed by autoradiography. In vitrotranscription using Drosophila embryo soluble nuclear fractions (SNFs) (21Kamakaka R.T. Tyree C.M. Kadonaga J.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 1024-1028Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) and immunodepletion experiments were carried out as previously described (12Park J.M. Gim B.S. Kim J.M. Yoon J.H. Kim H.-S. Kang J.-G. Kim Y.-J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 2312-2323Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). For reconstituted transcription assays,Drosophila TFIIA, TFIIB, TFIID, TFIIE, TFIIF, TFIIH, and pol II were included in the reactions. TFIIA, TFIIB, and TFIIE were expressed in and purified from E. coli BL21(DE3). TFIIF was expressed in Sf9 cells infected with baculovirus expression constructs. TFIID, TFIIH, and pol II were purified fromDrosophila embryo nuclear extracts as described (22Austin R.J. Biggin M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5788-5792Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Individual DNA fragments that were ∼0.5–1.0 kb in length were inserted into pBluescript KSa(+) (Stratagene) and then digested with BssHII to generate 5′-overhangs so that we could obtain runoff transcripts. After purification of the DNA fragments, in vitro transcription reactions were performed with the RiboMAX RNA production kit (Promega), and the reaction mixtures were incubated at 37 °C for 4 h. RNA products were purified by ethanol precipitation and annealed by incubating at 65 °C for 30 min, followed by slow cooling to room temperature. Cellfectin (Invitrogen) was used to transfect double-stranded RNA (2.5 μg) into SL2 cells, which were plated at a density of 1 × 106 cells/well of a six-well dish. The cells were incubated for 5 h at 25 °C, and then the medium was replaced with 2 ml of fresh medium. After an additional 5 days of incubation, the protein composition of the cell lysate was analyzed by immunoblotting. Mammalian Mediator complexes isolated at different laboratories have shown similar but distinct subunit compositions. Some of these discrepancies may arise from differences in the purification procedures used in each laboratory, but some may result from the isolation of distinct Mediator complexes with divergent functions in transcriptional regulation. As our source of Mediator, we used transcriptionally activeDrosophila embryo SNFs (21Kamakaka R.T. Tyree C.M. Kadonaga J.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 1024-1028Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), which we subjected to gel filtration on a Superose 6 column. Immunoblot analysis of known Mediator proteins in the fractions from the column showed that the SNFs were highly enriched in a 2-MDa Mediator complex, but had only small amounts of Mediator proteins in fractions that corresponded to lower molecular masses (Fig. 1A). This result suggests that, even if there are multiple Mediator complexes in Drosophila embryos, nearly all are in the 2-MDa size range. However, Drosophila embryos consist of diverse types of differentiated embryonic cells; thus, the possibility that smaller Mediator complexes exist in a tiny fraction of the cells could not be ruled out. To overcome this problem, we purified Mediator complexes from SL2 cells and compared their Superose 6 profile with that of the embryos. Immunoblot analysis of the Superose 6 fractions from the SL2 SNF revealed a pattern of Mediator components that was quite different from that of the embryonic SNF. Mediator proteins in the SL2 SNF eluted broadly in fractions that ranged in size from 2 to 0.5 MDa, with the majority of the Mediator proteins eluting in the 0.5-MDa range (Fig.1A). It was possible that this difference in the Mediator protein profiles resulted from a purification artifact due to unstable structural integrity of the Mediator complexes. Therefore, we monitored the relative abundances of the various Mediator complexes in embryonic and SL2 SNFs under two different salt concentrations (0.2 and 0.8m potassium acetate) using Superose 6 column chromatography. As shown in Fig. 1B, high salt conditions had no major effect on the overall size profiles of the Mediator complexes in either type of SNF; the majority of embryonic Mediator complexes were >1.5 MDa in size, and the broad migration profile of the SL2 Mediator complexes was unchanged. When we prepared nuclear extracts from embryos and SL2 cell nuclei under more stringent extraction conditions (the extraction buffer contained 0.4m ammonium sulfate), the embryo- and SL2-specific patterns of Mediator complex sizes were unchanged (Fig. 1C). These results indicate that the 0.5-MDa Mediator complex is not a breakdown product of a larger Mediator complex and that it exists in higher concentrations in SL2 cells than in the embryonic cell population. Although the high salt extraction had no major effect on the Mediator size profiles of the two cell populations, we did observe a small shift in the Superose 6 peak fraction of embryonic Mediator proteins toward lower molecular mass positions (Fig. 1C). The shift of the Superose 6 peak fraction also occurred as a result of high salt concentrations used in the gel filtration column (Fig. 1B). Taken together, these results show that it is highly likely that the 1.5-MDa complex is a subcomplex generated by a partial loss of some unstable components from the intact 2-MDa dMediator. To purify the differently sized Mediator complexes, we fractionated the SL2 SNF as shown Fig. 2A. Column chromatography fractions were examined for the presence of Mediator complexes by immunoblotting with antibodies specific to six known components of dMediator (dTRAP80, dMED6, dSOH1, dp34, Trfp, and dSRB7). During the multiple chromatography steps, the Mediator proteins were resolved into three distinct co-fractionated complexes, tentatively termed C1, C2, and C3, respectively, according to the order of elution from the hydroxylapatite column. On the basis of the elution profile of the hydroxylapatite column, C3 likely corresponds to dMediator purified from embryonic extracts (12Park J.M. Gim B.S. Kim J.M. Yoon J.H. Kim H.-S. Kang J.-G. Kim Y.-J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 2312-2323Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The molecular mass of purified C3 was comparable to that of dMediator, as determined by Superose 6 chromatography (Fig. 2B). The Superose 6 analyses of purified C1 and C2 showed that their molecular masses are 0.5 and 1.5 MDa, respectively, indicating that C1 may correspond to the 0.5-MDa complex that is specifically enriched in SL2 cells, whereas C2 may represent the 1.5-MDa subcomplex, which is probably generated from dMediator by a partial disruption of some components during the purification procedure (Figs. 1B and 2B). All three Mediator complexes were then subjected to ion exchange chromatography on a Mono S column, and the column fractions were subjected individually to immunoprecipitation with anti-dMED6, anti-Trfp, and anti-dSOH1 antibodies to purify each complex to homogeneity. C1 was efficiently immunoprecipitated by anti-dMED6 antibody and, to a lesser extent, by anti-Trfp antibody, but not by anti-dSOH1 antibody. In contrast, C2 and C3 were efficiently immunoprecipitated by all three antibodies (data not shown). Immunoblot analysis of the immunoprecipitated complexes showed that all six Mediator-specific antibodies were able to detect their cognate Mediator components in C2 and C3, whereas only dTRAP80, dMED6, and Trfp were detected in C1 (Fig. 2C). Next, we explored the functional properties of the three Mediator complexes. In our previous study, dMediator was shown to play a critical role in transcriptional activation in vitroand to interact with pol II (12Park J.M. Gim B.S. Kim J.M. Yoon J.H. Kim H.-S. Kang J.-G. Kim Y.-J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 2312-2323Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Here, we first checked the abilities of C1, C2, and C3 to associate with pol II. Purified core pol II containing a FLAG-tagged dRPB9 subunit was mixed with each of the Mediator complexes. The mixture was then incubated with anti-FLAG antibody M2-agarose beads, and the bead-bound proteins were analyzed by immunoblotting. C3 was able to form a complex with core pol II, whereas C1 and C2 were not (Fig. 3A). Therefore, it is likely that the Mediator proteins present in C3, but not in C1 and C2, are required to form an interface for stable binding to pol II. We then examined whether C1 and C3 are able to interact with various transcriptional activator proteins. Each of the purified Mediator complexes was mixed individually with four recombinant GST-fused activator proteins (Armadillo (23Behrens J. von Kries J.P. Kuhl M. Bruhn L. Wedlich D. Grosschedl R. Birchmeier W. Nature. 1996; 382: 638-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (2560) Google Scholar), Dx (24Isoda K. Roth S. Nusslein-Volhard C. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 619-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), heat shock transcription factor HSF (25Fernandes M. Xiao H. Lis J.T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4799-4804Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), and Notch (26Struhl G. Adachi A. Cell. 1998; 93: 649-660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar)), and their associations were examined using a GST pull-down assay, followed by immunoblot analysis with anti-dTRAP80 antibody. Although only C3 interacted with pol II, both C1 and C3 interacted strongly with all of the activator proteins tested (Fig. 3B). Therefore, the Mediator proteins shared by C1 and C3 can function as transcriptional activator-binding subunits. To determine whether the affinities of the Mediator complexes for pol II and/or the transcriptional activator proteins correlate with the transcriptional coactivator activity of the complexes, we tested the ability of C1, C2, and C3 to support activated transcription in vitro. To this end, SNFs were immunodepleted of endogenous Mediator proteins by incubation with anti-dMED6 antibodies and used for in vitro transcription assays (Fig.4A). When the transcriptional activator protein Gal4-VP16 was added to the transcription reaction mixture, it selectively activated, in a Mediator-dependent manner, transcription of the template that contained the Gal4 activator-binding sites (G5-Adh), but did not activate the templates that contained only the core promoter (Adh) (Fig.4A, lanes 1–4). When the Mediator-depleted SNFs were supplemented with a comparable amount of each of the three purified Mediator complexes, C2 and C3, but not C1, restored transcriptional activation by Gal4-VP16 (lanes 8–10). In contrast, none of the complexes affected the level of basal transcription (lanes 5–7). The coactivator activities were further confirmed using a highly purified transcription system consisting of recombinant or purified general transcription factors (TFIIA, TFIIB, TFIID, TFIIE, TFIIF, and TFIIH) and pol II. This reconstituted system supported Gal4-VP16-driven transcriptional activation when embryonic dMediator was added to the mixture (Fig. 4B, lane 4). Again, in this system, C2 and C3 supported a moderate level of transcriptional activation by Gal4-VP16 (lanes 8 and 10), whereas C1 was unable to promote activated transcription (lane 6). As was seen with the SNF system, none of the complexes affected the level of reconstituted basal transcription (lanes 5, 7, and 9). Therefore, our results show that C2 and C3 are able to mediate transcriptional activation in vitro, but strong association of the complexes with core pol II sufficient to be detectable in our in vitro assay is not necessary for this activation function. In addition, if C2 is indeed a subcomplex of C3 and does not have any unique components, the transcriptional coactivator function of C3 must be dependent on the subset of the subunits that the two complexes have in common. On the other hand, C1 did not show any pol II transcription-related activity (including transcriptional repression) in our in vitro assays and may have functions distinct from those of dMediator and other Mediator complexes identified in yeast and human. Although we did not observe transcriptional activation activity for C1 in an in vitro assay, its activator-binding activity and abundance in a specific cell type suggest that C1 may participate in an as yet undefined reaction in SL2 cells that involves interaction with transcriptional regulatory proteins. Therefore, we purified C1 to homogeneity and used MALDI-TOF analysis to determine its entire polypeptide composition. We then confirmed the association of the various C1 subunits in a co-immunoprecipitation assay. Multiple peptide sequences derived from individual C1 subunits revealed the presence of the following proteins: dTRAP80, dMED6, CRSP34, dTrfp, and dp28b. In addition to these previously identified subunits of the dMediator complex, several of the C1 subunits were encoded by novel genes (Fig.5A and TableI). One of these novel genes encodes a 35-kDa polypeptide that was identified as CG17183, which is theDrosophila homolog of the recently identified TRAP25 (27Baek H.J. Malik S. Qin J. Roeder R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 2842-2852Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The 20-, 19-, and 15-kDa polypeptides were found to correspond to the CG6884, CG5121, and BACR7A4.6 gene products, respectively; and we named these genes dMED21, dMED23, anddMED24, respectively. Each of these novel Mediator subunits has a highly conserved human homolog (Fig.5C).Table IResults of MALDI-TOF analysis for C1 complex compositionProteinMOWSE scoreNo. of peaks identifiedMasses matchedProtein massAccession No.%kDadTRAP802.39e + 009153771.6AE003721dMED204.8e + 00393035.3AE003469dMED617.382828.2AE003684CRSP346.47e + 004113233.9AE003602dp28b1.94e + 00372924.7AE003422Trfp527e + 004134627.6AE003619dMED215754719.6AE003519dMED23521124221.1AE003752dMED241.32e + 00393416.6AE003419 Open table in a new tab To verify that these novel subunits are indeed components of the Mediator complex, a FLAG-tagged version of the putative Mediator genes was transfected into SL2 cells, and its association with other Mediator proteins was examined by co-immunoprecipitation. When the transfected cell extracts were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibody M2-agarose, FLAG-tagged versions of the dTRAP25, dMED21, dMED23, and dMED24 proteins were co-immunoprecipitated with the dTRAP80, dMED6, and Trfp Mediator proteins, but not with the TATA-binding protein (Fig. 5B; Trfp data not shown). These results confirmed that the newly identified proteins (dTRAP25, dMED21, dMED23, and dMED24) are genuine components of the DrosophilaMediator complex. To further demonstrate that these subunits are bona fidecomponents of C1, we established a stable SL2 cell line expressing FLAG-tagged dTRAP25 and purified a dTRAP25-containing complex from C1-enriched hydroxylapatite fractions using two successive immunoprecipitations with anti-FLAG and anti-dMED6 antibodies. Silver staining analysis revealed that the composition of the purified complex was identical to that of C1 (data not shown). These results confirmed that the C1 Mediator complex is composed of both newly identified Mediator subunits (dTRAP25, dMED21, dMED23, and dMED24) and previously identified dMediator proteins (dTRAP80, dMED6, CRSP34, Trfp, and dp28b). Among the subunits of the C1 Mediator complex, dTRAP80, dMED6, CRSP34, Trfp, and dp28b are shared with dMediator. dMED21, one of the newly identified Mediator subunits, was also found in dMediator by immunoblot analysis performed with anti-dMED21 antibody (data not shown). The presence of the other novel C1 Mediator subunits (dTRAP25, dMED23, and dMED24) in dMediator was not confirmed due to the difficulty in raising functional antibodies to these subunits. However, the identification of a dTRAP25 homolog in the human Mediator complex that corresponds to dMediator suggests that dTRAP25 may also be shared by the C1 and dMediator complexes. To examine whether these shared subunits are physically associated in cells, we generated dTRAP80 mutant SL2 cells using double-stranded RNA interference (28Clemens J.C. Worby C.A. Simonsom-Leff N. Muda M. Maehama T. Hemminds B.A. Dixin J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6499-6503Crossref PubMed Scopus (703) Google Scholar). Transfection of dTRAP80 double-stranded RNA into SL2 cells inhibited dTRAP80 protein synthesis by causing the specific degradation of dTRAP80 transcripts. Five days after the double-stranded RNA transfection, the level of dTRAP80 protein dropped significantly, so only a trace amount of dTRAP80 protein was detected by immunoblot analysis (Fig.6A). In the dTRAP80-deficient SL2 cell extracts, we examined the concentrations of the shared Mediator proteins as well as those of the dMediator-specific subunits (Cdk8 and dSOH1) using specific antibodies. Interestingly, the levels of dMED6 and Trfp were reduced to barely detectable levels, and the amount of dp28b protein was reduced slightly. However, the amounts of the dMediator-specific proteins were not changed by the loss of dTRAP80 (Fig. 6A). When dSOH1, a dMediator-specific subunit, was removed from cells using a similar approach, none of the shared Mediator proteins were lost from the extracts. These results suggest that when dTRAP80 was not present in the cell extracts, the subunits shared between C1 and dMediator, including dMED6 and Trfp, were lost from both types of Mediator complexes, implying that these proteins interact physically. GST pull-down analysis confirmed the direct interaction between dMED6, Trfp, and dTRAP80 (Fig. 6B). Therefore, these subunits shared by the two Mediator complexes may form a distinct modular structure, which could be C1 itself, to mediate interaction with transcriptional regulatory proteins. In this study, we examined Drosophila nuclear extracts for the presence of alternative Mediator complexes that are distinct from the previously identified dMediator (12Park J.M. Gim B.S. Kim J.M. Yoon J.H. Kim H.-S. Kang J.-G. Kim Y.-J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 2312-2323Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Even though several Mediator complexes have been identified in human, it is unclear whether these complexes represent the actual repertoire of Mediator complexesin vivo. This is because the subunit composition of the assorted human Mediator complexes varies according to the purification and assay methods used (13Malik S. Roeder R.G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 277-283Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). Instead of pursuing specific functional activities, we analyzed Drosophila embryonic and SL2 nuclear extracts by column chromatography and immunoblot analysis to trace the entire spectrum of Mediator proteins. Such an approach permitted us to recognize the existence of smaller complexes containing dMediator components and ultimately to isolate the novel complex whose existence cannot be detected by conventional approaches. Our analysis provides strong circumstantial evidence that C2 is a subcomplex that separated from dMediator. This mode of Mediator diversification is not unprecedented and actually is reminiscent of the human PC2 complex, which is regarded as a submodule of human Mediator TRAP/SMCC (17Malik S., Gu, W., Wu, W. Qin J. Roeder R.G. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 753-760Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Although it is still unclear whether C2 is theDrosophila counterpart of human PC2, both C2 and PC2 can act as transcriptional coactivators in vitro. Although we could not detect an interaction between pol II and C2, addition of C2 was sufficient to support transcriptional activation in Mediator-deficient SNFs and in a defined transcription system reconstituted with general transcription factors and pol II (Fig. 4, A andB). This implies that, at least for transcriptional activation in vitro, a tight association between pol II and Mediator proteins is dispensable (or that the conditions used in thein vitro binding assay were not ideal for detection of weakin vitro binding of C2 and pol II). These experiments also show that the dMediator components that are absent in C2 are not essential for the mediation of transcriptional activation by Gal4-VP16. Hence, C2 may function as a core coactivator, whereas other Mediator proteins may serve as auxiliary molecules that are critical in the transcriptional regulation of specific subsets of genes. Our observations that C1 exists separate from dMediator, does not support transcriptional activation by Gal4-VP16 in vitro, and does not associate with core pol II raise several possibilities regarding the significance of the existence and function of C1. First, novel subunits may endow C1 with a distinctive character different from that of dMediator. The putative process that requires the function of C1 is not necessarily confined to the transcriptional activation arena. C1 may be involved in gene transcription, but may be required by only specific types of transcriptional regulators. Another possibility is that C1 is a subcomplex of dMediator, but can exist on its own or in a complex with other proteins depending on the developmental process or physiological conditions. The fact that dMED6 and Trfp interact with dTRAP80 and disappear along with dTRAP80 in RNA interference experiments is reminiscent of the modular structure of the yeast Gal11 module proteins (Gal11, Med2, and Hrs1). It is intriguing that both of these modular domains in yeast and metazoans are involved in activator binding. Thus, C1 may be an alternative form of dMediator that is regulated by developmental signals, and the shared subunits may interact with regulatory proteins to function (mediate or squelch regulatory processes) in response to specific signals. Further studies of the functions of C1 are needed to extend our understanding of the physiological roles of metazoan Mediator complexes. We thank B. H. Hwang, J. M.

Despite numerous attempts to modify solution conditions to favor the assembly of paired-helical filaments, we consistently observed that wild-type MAP2 MTBR could not form PHF structures. By contrast, Tau MTBR readily adopts both SF and PHF morphologies, leading to our hypothesis that one or more residues within the Tau microtubule-binding region play a major role in determining filament morphology. Although the amino acid sequences of the Tau and MAP2 MTBRs are highly related (5Lewis S.A. Wang D.H. Cowan N.J. Science. 1988; 242: 936-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar, 6Ennulat D.

Commun. 1999; 2: 71-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), we noticed differences, especially with respect to charged residues that were clustered within two short stretches of residues. To evaluate the structural significance of these modules, we employed site-directed mutagenesis to replace certain MAP2 residues in each of these stretches by the residues at the corresponding locations in Tau. We also investigated the impact of single site substitutions. Our findings indicate that a small number of residues play a critical role in determining Tau filament morphology. While assessing intracellular turnover of Tau filaments is not currently feasible in humans, our mutagenesis studies suggest that a few morphology-conferring regions may help to explain the enhanced accumulation of neurofibrillary tangles in certain naturally occurring Chromosome-17 tauopathies. We used the pETh-3b vector, a derivative of pBR-322, for both cloning and expression (16Di Noto L. DeTure M.A. Purich D.L. Mol. Cell Biol. Res.

Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA) One-Shot competent cells or DM1 competent cells (Invitrogen) were used for cloning, andEscherichia coli BL21 (DE3) pLYS S competent cells (Novagen, Inc., Madison, WI) were used for protein expression.

Sitting-bridge crystallization cells were obtained from Hampton Research (Laguna Niguel, CA). Paired helical filaments from Alzheimer brain tissue were the generous gift from Dr. Peter Davies of Albert Einstein College of Medicine. All MAP2 MTBRs were cloned into pETh-3b using the 5′NdeI site and the 3′ EcoRV site and expressed as described elsewhere (14Zhang E.Y. DeTure M.A. Bubb M.R. Caviston T.L. Erdos G.W. Whittaker S.D.

Cell Biol. Res. Commun. 1999; 2: 71-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The cDNA sequence corresponding to the 99-residue MAP2-MTBR was mutated to code for the specified Tau Module-A residues by use of cassette mutagenesis. The mutation sites are flanked by a BamHI site on their 5′ side and an AflII site on their 3′ side. Oligonucleotides were designed that annealed to one another, coded for the mutations of interest, created overhangs that complemented the BamHI and AflII sticky ends, and destroyed the BamHI and AflII sites once inserted into the cDNA sequence. Cloning involved digesting MAP2–123 with BamHI and AflII, purifying the released fragment from the plasmid by gel electrophoresis, and ligating the annealed oligonucleotides into the plasmid. Transformed Invitrogen One-Shot competent cells were plated, and colonies were screened for their plasmids. The nucleotide sequence encoding Module-B of MAP2-MTBR was mutated to include the Gln, Glu, Lys, and Glu residues of Tauusing four-primer PCR. Complementary internal primers were designed to contain the mutations and to provide a silent mutation site for Hind III on the 3′ side of the mutations to facilitate screening. These primers were used individually with primers for the ends of the clone that contained restriction sites for cloning. The PCR products for the front and back of the molecule were purified by gel electrophoresis and used as template in a second reaction with the primers for the ends of the molecule. The PCR reaction product was digested with NdeI and EcoRI and cloned into the pETh-3b plasmid that had been digested with the same restriction enzymes and purified. Plasmids from colonies were screened for the addition of the HindIII site, and positives were grown and sequenced. Individual point mutations in Module-B were also generated using cassette mutagenesis. Module-B is flanked on the 5′ side by theStuI site and on the 3′ side by the Hind III site introduced for screening in the MAP2–123 Module-B mutant. Oligonucleotides were designed that annealed to one another, coded for the mutation of interest, had a blunt 5′ end, created a 3′ overhang, which complemented the Hind III sticky end, and destroyed the HindIII site when inserted into the MAP2–123 cDNA sequence. Plasmid containing MAP2–123 (Module-B) digested with StuI andHindIII was gel-purified to remove the small released fragment and incubated with the annealed oligonucleotides. The mixture was then ligated and transformed into Invitrogen One-Shot competent cells. Plasmids were purified from different colonies and screened for the loss of the Hind III site. Positives for each point mutation were sequenced. Protein isolation and high performance liquid chromatography purification is described elsewhere (16Di Noto L. DeTure M.A. Purich D.L. Mol. Cell Biol. Res. Commun. 1999; 2: 71-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Samples (1–2 mg/ml after the purification and dialysis) were assembled in 100 mm Tris at pH 6.8. Samples were concentrated ∼10 times in a Centricon apparatus with a 3-kDa molecular mass cut-off. Lowry assays were used to determine the MAP concentration (17Coffey R.L. Joly J.C. Cain B.D. Purich D.L. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 13199-13207Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Buffers were then changed to 0.2m Tris, 0.2 m sodium acetate, pH 6.8, by diluting with 1.0 m stock solutions of Tris and sodium acetate, pH 6.8. Samples (50–800 μm in 20 μl) were placed in a sitting-bridge crystallization cells in sealed vapor equilibrium chamber containing 1 ml 0.6 m Tris acetate, pH 6.8, at room temperature for 1–6 weeks. Some samples were polymerized at 10–200 μm in 1.5-ml Eppendorf tubes containing tRNA (0.01–0.50 mg/ml). Optimal tRNA concentrations were lower than needed for Tau (18Goedert M. Jakes R.

Carbon-coated films were prepared by vapor adsorption of elemental carbon onto mica strips and floated on water prior to transfer to the grids. Carbon-coated grids were prepared by coating 400-mesh copper grids with grid glue (i.e. 1-inch Scotch tape washed into 10 ml of chloroform) to ensure proper adhesion of carbon films. The sample was added by floating a grid on a drop of sample for 30 s. Nonadsorbed sample was then wicked off and the grid was negatively stained by floating it on a drop of 1% uranyl acetate or 1% phosphotungstic acid for 30 s. Grids were examined after 15 min on a Hitachi H-7000 transmission electron microscope at 75 kV. We used two parameters to determine the frequency of SF and PHF formation by examining negatively stained electron micrographs of assembled filaments. The transmission electron microscope was calibrated by using a high-magnification grating replica cross-ruled at 2160 lines/mm (Electron Microscopy Sciences, Inc., Fort Washington, PA). To avoid inherent limitations on calibrations of over- or underfocused micrograph prints, we only used the actual negatives. The bars presented in the micrographs therefore correspond to the measurements made on the actual negatives. Finally, based on the distinctive morphologies of SFs and PHFs, we counted the SFs and PHFs on a series of randomly chosen micrographs. Because Crowther (21Crowther R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2288-2292Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar) previously demonstrated that SF and PHF structures have virtually identical masses per unit length, we estimated the relative abundance of protein in the SF and PHF structures by determining the total length of SFs and PHFs in each set of electron micrographs. Tau and MAP2 each possess a projection arm, hinge domain, and MTBR, the latter consisting of three or four nonidentical 31-residue repeats (Fig. 1). Although the amino acid sequences of their MTBRs are in fact very similar (with only 16 nonconservative differences), a surprising fact is that the MTBR of Tau forms both straight filaments and paired helical filaments (see Fig. 1,inset, for typical morphologies), whereas the MTBR of MAP2 only forms straight filaments. Because bacterially expressed MAP2 MTBR and Tau MTBR have the same filament polymerization habits as the proteins isolated directly from brain tissue (13Schweers O. Mandelkow E.M. Biernat J.

Neurochem. 1996; 67: 1183-1190Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar), post-translational modification is not required for these differences in filament morphology. We therefore considered the possibility that one or more amino acid residues in their MTBRs is(are) somehow playing a morphology-determining role. Upon closer examination, we observed two relatively short stretches, designated here as Module-A and Module-B, that contained 9 of the 16 nonconservative differences between Tau and MAP2 MTBRs. As indicated in Fig. 1, the Module-A of Tau contains His, Gly, Lys, Tyr, and Pro in positions that correspond to Tyr, Lys, Gln, Thr, and Lys residues in MAP2. Moreover, while the amino acid residues in Module-A in both Tau and MAP2 have net charge of +2, their locations of charged residues are altered. We also observed that the Module-B of Tau contains Gln, Glu, Lys, and Glu in place of Arg, Lys, Glu, and Val residues in MAP2, again exhibiting an intriguing reversal of charge at certain positions. Upon consulting the Swiss-Prot Data base, we found that these differences are consistently present in human, mouse, rat, and bovine proteins. For these reasons, these two modules appeared to be highly promising site-specific mutagenesis targets in efforts to identify key residues favoring PHF formation. Thus, while MAP2 is not involved in any known neuropathy, this approach offered the opportunity to assess the significance of particular Tau protein residues in PHF formation. To assess the importance of Module-A in determining PHF morphology, we used site-directed mutagenesis to replace the Tyr, Lys, Gln, Thr, and Lys residues in MAP2 by the corresponding His, Gly, Lys, Tyr, and Pro residues in Tau. We purified this bacterially expressed mutant polypeptide, designated MTBR-modA(HGKYP), to homogeneity, as confirmed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Upon overnight dialysis in the absence of a thiol reducing agent, MTBR-modA(HGKYP) formed the disulfide cross-linked dimer (lane 1 of Fig. 3 A) which is known to hasten filament self-assembly (13Schweers O.

(Other lanes in Fig.2 document the purity and dimerization of two other MAP2 MTBR mutants described later in this report.) When incubated in the absence of polyanions, MTBR-modA(HGKYP) formed filaments slowly, usually requiring 7–10 days. In the presence of tRNA, however, the full extent of filament self-assembly required only 1–2 days. In any case, only straight filaments assembled from the MTBR-modA(HGKYP) mutant (see micrographs in Fig.3), suggesting that Module-A is not a PHF morphology-determining region.Figure 2SDS gel electrophoresis of MAP2 Module-A and Module-B mutants in the presence and absence of dithiothreitol.The mutant forms are indicated beneath each pair of lanes.Odd-numbered lanes contain protein incubated in the absence of dithiothreitol, and even-numbered lanes contain protein treated with dithiothreitol for 30 min prior to loading the samples for electrophoresis.

When assembled in the presence of tRNA, the MTBR modB(QEKE) filaments of MAP2 were predominantly of the paired-helical type (see montage in Fig.4).

Compared with Tau PHFs (see inset to Fig. 1), the filaments formed from the modB(QEKE) mutant have an exceptionally regular cable-like morphology. Their helical periodicity is 45–55 nm for the modB(QEKE) mutant versus 80–90 nm observed for Alzheimer PHFs and those formed in other neurodegenerative diseases. To determine the relative importance of individual Module-B residues in promoting the formation of PHF-like structures, we prepared the four single-residue mutants: modB(Arg-to-Gln), modB(Lys-to-Glu), modB(Glu-to-Lys), and modB(Val-to-Glu). All four polymerized into filaments, and each had its own characteristic frequency of PHF formation, indicated as the number of PHF-like structures divided by the total number of assembled filaments (Fig. 5 A). We also determined the relative abundance of protein present as paired helical filament structure, indicated by the total length of PHF-like structures divided by the total length of all assembled filaments (Fig.5 B). In the latter case, we assumed that SF and PHF structures have the same mass per unit length, based on image reconstruction work on Tau filaments (21Crowther R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2288-2292Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). By far, the most interesting Module-B point mutant was the modB(Val-to-Glu), whose purity and dimerization properties are shown in lanes 5 and 6 of Fig. 2. As shown in Fig. 6, this single-point MAP2 MTBR mutant preferentially assembled into PHF-like polymers. These data, which show that a single residue can have profound effects on PHF formation, underscore the idea that Module-B residues comprise the morphology-determining region in microtubule-associated proteins. Neurofibrillary tangles are a complex aggregate comprised of straight filaments and/or paired helical filaments, with the microtubule-binding region of Tau serving as the basic building block. Although image reconstruction studies indicate that straight filaments and paired helical filaments arise from two distinct filament-packing schemes (21Crowther R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2288-2292Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar), surprisingly little is known about what residues in the MTBR control filament morphology. By identifying Tau residues that induce MAP2 to form paired helical filaments, we localized a cluster of key morphology-conferring residues. We found that MAP2 modB(QEKE), which contains four Tau Module-B residues, formed PHF-type filaments. Moreover, introduction of individual charged residues from Tau's Module-B into the Module-B of MAP2 likewise resulted in the formation of PHF-like structures, albeit with lower frequency. In the context of the three-repeat microtubule-binding region, the only known tauopathy mutations are those located at positions 272, 337, and 342. The G272V mutation is situated in Module-A, whereas the two other, V337M and E342V, lie squarely within Module-B. Mutations at position 337 form PHF-type filaments from all six Tau isoforms (23Goedert M. Crowther R.A. Spillantini M.G. Neuron. 1998; 21: 955-958Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar), and the E342V mutant is known to alter the abundance of three- and four-repeat Tau in favor of the latter. It should be mentioned that PHFs isolated from AD neurofibrillary tangles typically exhibit 80-nm helical periodicities, whereas those in Chromosome-17 tauopathies range from 90 to 120 nm. Detailed morphological studies of neuropathic filaments are limited by slight irregularities in Tau filament morphology. In fact, image reconstruction on Tau filaments has failed to reveal the boundaries of each repeating unit, denying the opportunity to establish the number of MTBRs per unit length. Electron-opaque uranyl acetate apparently does not penetrate the boundaries of each morphological unit and fails to reveal the longitudinal-repeat periodicity. In this regard, there is an obvious need to identify filament structures that are more suitable for establishing the MTBR packing scheme. Although beyond the scope of this study, the remarkably regular morphology of MTBR modB(QEKE) filaments (shown in Fig. 4) may provide important clues for refining the structure of Tau PHFs. We have also addressed the question of whether the equivalent MAP2 residues substituted into Tau would prevent the formation of Tau PHFs. In principle, if the introduced mutations were the sole morphology-determining factors, the MAP2 mutants should have formed structures that were indistinguishable from wild-type Tau filaments. We tested this possibility by replacing the Tau residues in the Module-A and Module-B regions by those found in MAP2. We consistently observed that the Tau Module-A mutants formed fewer filaments, and those that were formed were predominantly straight filaments, like those observed with MAP2 (data not shown). On the other hand, the Tau Module-B mutants containing the corresponding MAP2 residues were largely indistinguishable from wild-type Tau filaments assembled in vitro. These unpublished findings suggest that other residues outside Module-A and/or Module-B must also play some role in promoting PHF formation. Further work is needed to understand the significance of the persistently different locations of charged residues in both Module-A and Module-B of Tau and MAP2. In the absence of reducing agents, Tau and MAP2 form Tau-S-S-Tau and MAP2-S-S-MAP2 homodimers that bind to assembled microtubules (16Di Noto L. DeTure M.A. Purich D.L. Mol. Cell Biol. Res. Commun. 1999; 2: 71-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) and also facilitate SF and PHF formation (13Schweers O. Mandelkow E.M. Biernat J. Mandelkow E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8463-8467Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar, 14Zhang E.Y. DeTure M.A. Bubb M.R. Caviston T.L. Erdos G.W. Whittaker S.D. Purich D.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

DeTure, L. Di Noto, and D. L. Purich, unpublished data. Because Module-A and Module-B regions flank the only thiol group in three-repeat MAPs, one cannot dismiss the possibility that the arrangement of charged residues may prevent Tau-MAP2 heterodimer formation. In conclusion, while the Module-B of Tau appears to be an especially important determinant of filament morphology, our findings do not exclude the possibility that other residues play a role. Our discovery of this PHF morphology determinant may also provide new tools for examining the factors affecting the formation and stability of neuropathic filaments."
