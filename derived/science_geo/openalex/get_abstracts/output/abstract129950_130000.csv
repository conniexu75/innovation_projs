Diverse stimuli appear to utilize reactive oxygen species (e.g. hydrogen peroxide) as common effectors for activating NF-κB. Antioxidants govern intracellular redox status, and many such molecules can reduce H2O2. However, functionally, it does appear that different antioxidants are variously selective for redox regulation of certain transcription factors such as NF-κB. For NF-κB, thioredoxin has been described to be a more potent antioxidant than either glutathione orN-acetylcysteine. Thioredoxin peroxidase is the immediate enzyme that links reduction of H2O2 to thioredoxin. Several putative human thioredoxin peroxidases have been identified using recursive sequence searches/alignments with yeast or prokaryotic enzymes. None has been characterized in detail for intracellular function(s). Here, we describe a new human thioredoxin peroxidase, antioxidant enzyme AOE372, identified by virtue of its protein-protein interaction with the product of a proliferation associationgene, pag, which is also a thiol-specific antioxidant. In human cells, AOE372 defines a redox pathway that specifically regulates NF-κB activity via a modulation of IκB-α phosphorylation in the cytoplasm. We show that AOE372 activity is regulated through either homo- or heterodimerization with other thiol peroxidases, implicating subunit assortment as a mechanism for regulating antioxidant specificities. AOE372 function suggests thioredoxin peroxidase as an immediate regulator of H2O2-mediated activation of NF-κB. Reduction-oxidation (redox) plays a critical role in NF-κB activation.

AOE372 function suggests thioredoxin peroxidase as an immediate regulator of H2O2-mediated activation of NF-κB. Living organisms produce reactive oxygen species such as H2O2 during physiological processes and in response to external stimuli such as UV radiation. To cope with potentially destructive reactive oxygen species, cells have evolved antioxidant defenses (reviewed in Ref. 1Scandalios J.G. Oxidative Stress and the Molecular Biology of Antioxidant Defenses. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1997Google Scholar). A delicate balance between oxidants and antioxidants is pivotally important for homeostasis. Several lines of evidence suggest that the regulation of intracellular redox, a process highly conserved in organisms ranging from bacteria to human, is a versatile control mechanism in signal transduction and gene expression (reviewed in Ref. 2Sen C.K. Packer L. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 709-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (1781) Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, intracellular redox status has been linked to cellular differentiation, immune response, growth control, tumor promotion, and apoptosis, as well as activation of viruses, notably HIV, 1The abbreviations used are: HIV, human immunodeficiency virus; TNF, tumor necrosis factor; TR, thioredoxin reductase; Trx, thioredoxin; Tpx, thioredoxin peroxidase; bp, base pair(s); PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase; SRE, serum response element; HTLV, human T-cell lymphotrophic virus; LTR, long terminal repeat; α-Pag, anti-Pag antibody; TPA, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate; PDC, paraquat dichloride. from latency (3Schreck R.

A. 1991; 88: 986-990Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). One redox-regulated protein is NF-κB. NF-κB is a member of the Rel family of transcription factors that exist ambiently in the cytoplasm via association with inhibitor protein, IκB (reviewed in Refs. 5Verma I.M. Stevenson J.K. Schwarz E.M. Antwerp D.V. Miyamoto S. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2723-2735Crossref PubMed Scopus (1665) Google Scholar and6Baeuerle P.A. Baltimore D. Cell. 1996; 87: 13-20Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2935) Google Scholar). A wide variety of stimuli including tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), phorbol ester, bacterial lipopolysaccharide, and virus infection can activate NF-κB. Studies have implicated reactive oxygen species (i.e. H2O2) as one common signal transducer for these diverse stimuli (7Baeuerle P.A. Henkel T. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 141-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (4602) Google Scholar, 8Anderson M.T. Staal F.J.T. Gilter C. Herzenberg L.A. Herzenberg L.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11527-11531Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). How H2O2 might affect cytoplasmic and nuclear events that lead to the activated function of NF-κB is an important issue that remains incompletely elucidated. One pathway of NF-κB activation involves site-specific phosphorylation of IκB-α on serine residues 32 and 36. It has been suggested that serine phosphorylation targets IκB to the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway for degradation (9Palombella V.J. Rando O.J. Goldberg A.L. Maniatis T. Cell. 1994; 78: 773-785Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1922) Google Scholar, 10Traenckner E.B.-M. Pahl H.L. Henkel T. Schmidt K.N. Wilk S. Baeuerle P.A.

IκB inactivation, without proteolytic degradation, has also been reported to occur as a consequence of tyrosine phosphorylation on residue 42 (12Imbert V. Rupec R.A. Livolsi A. Pahl H.L. Traenckner E.B.-M. Mueller-Dieckmann C. Farahifar D. Rossi B. Auberger P. Baeuerle P.A. Peyron J.-F. Cell. 1996; 86: 787-798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar). In both instances, phosphorylation results in an unmasking of the NF-κB nuclear localization signal facilitating nuclear entry of protein. Thus, for stimuli such as oxidative stress, which potently and rapidly modulates the nuclear activity of NF-κB, IκB-α may represent a critical activation target (5Verma I.M. Stevenson J.K. Schwarz E.M. Antwerp D.V. Miyamoto S. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2723-2735Crossref PubMed Scopus (1665) Google Scholar). Antioxidants govern intracellular redox status. Inside cells, glutathione, glutaredoxin, and thioredoxin (13Thomas J.A. Poland B. Honzatko R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 319: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar) represent the major reducing agents. It is reasonable, although the evidence is not clear-cut, that different antioxidants should have preferential specificities for discrete redox pathways. A number of studies have suggested that thioredoxin is a specifically potent antioxidant for NF-κB activation (14Schenk H. Klein M. Erdbrugger W. Droge W. Schulze-Osthoff K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1672-1676Crossref PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar, 15Okamoto T. Ogiwara H. Hayashi T. Mitsui A. Kawabe T. Yodoi J. Int.

Thioredoxin reductase (TR), thioredoxin (Trx), and thioredoxin peroxidase (Tpx) are three linked components in a redox chain that couples peroxide reduction to NADPH oxidation (17Chae H.Z. Chung S.J. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27670-27678Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In such a scheme, within cells, Tpx is the immediate enzyme that detoxifies hydrogen peroxide. Thioredoxin peroxidases are highly conserved in eukaryotes and prokaryotes (18Yamamoto T. Matsui Y. Natori S. Obinata M. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 80: 337-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 19Ishii T. Yamada M. Sato H. Matsue M. Taketani S. Nakayama K. Sugita Y. Bannai S. J. Biol.

Muller-Eberhard U. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13398-13406Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Their high degree of conservation suggests a biological importance of this type of enzyme. Some putative “Tpx” proteins have been identified by sequence alignment searches with yeast or bacteria enzymes. 2We have recently suggested a new nomenclature for mammalian peroxiredoxins, Prx, that classifies them based on amino acid sequences and immunological reactivities (S. W. Kang, H. Z. Chae, H. J. Kim, K. Kim, I. C. Baines, and S. G. Rhee, manuscript in preparation). At present, however, the functions or properties of human thioredoxin peroxidase remain ill defined. One step toward better physiological understanding is to identify and characterize the intracellular activities of bona fide thiol-specific enzymes. With the idea that redox enzymes might be regulated through protein-protein interactions, we searched for human cellular partners of a known thiol-specific antioxidant, Pag (20Prosperi M.-T. Ferbus D. Karczinski I. Goubin G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11050-11056Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Chae H.Z. Robison K. Poole L.B. Church G. Storz G. Rhee S.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7017-7021Crossref PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar). Using a yeast two-hybrid approach, we isolated (as Pag partner) a cDNA that encodes a new prototype peroxiredoxin. This peroxiredoxin, designatedantioxidant enzyme AOE372 (and classified in a new nomenclature2 as subfamily IV), is a human thioredoxin peroxidase. AOE372 defines a redox pathway that leads to NF-κB activation. The biological activity of AOE372 implicates a role for human thioredoxin peroxidase in modulating IκB-α phosphorylation in the cytoplasm. AOE372 cDNA was isolated from a human HeLa S3 Matchmaker cDNA library (HL4000A1;CLONTECH). The 5′ 95-bp sequence was obtained from the same library by the rapid amplification of cDNA ends procedure. Double-stranded AOE372 cDNA was sequenced on both strands by the dideoxy method using Sequenase 2.0 (U.S. Biochemical Corp.) as per the manufacturer's protocol. Nucleotide and peptide sequences were analyzed with the Wisconsin software package (version 8.1, Genetics Computer Group, Inc.). Multiple alignments of protein sequences were generated with a progressive pairwise algorithm (26Jin L. Nei M. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1990; 7: 82-102PubMed Google Scholar). Phylogenetic analysis was based on a matrix of evolutionary distances, and the phylogeny was reconstructed using the UPGMA algorithm (27Felsenstein J. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 266: 418-427Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Yeast two-hybrid screening was performed in yeast strain CG-1945 according to the Matchmaker Two-hybrid System 2 protocol (CLONTECH). CG-1945 was transformed with bait plasmid (pAS2–1/Pag) and then screened with a human HeLa S3 cell line Matchmaker cDNA library constructed in plasmid pGADGH (HL4000A1; CLONTECH). Positive clones were selected for expression of His3p and β-galactosidase. Plasmid DNA was recovered from CG-1945 and electroporated intoEscherichia coli. Reporter assays were performed as described previously (28Jin D.-Y. Jeang K.-T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 378-387Crossref Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Monolayer HeLa and HepG2 cells in a 100-mm Petri disk were harvested in 2 ml of immunoprecipitation buffer (PBS, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1 μg/ml antipain, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 mg/ml aminoethyl benzenesulfonyl fluoride, and 1 μg/ml aprotinin) and disrupted by repeated aspiration through a 21-gauge needle. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation. One ml of cell extract was incubated with 2 μg of mouse monoclonal antibody for 1 h at 4 °C. 20 μl of protein G-agarose was added, and the mixture was rotated overnight at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitates were collected by centrifugation, washed three times with immunoprecipitation buffer, and resuspended in SDS gel loading buffer (60 mm Tris base, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 5% 2-mercaptoethanol). Rabbit anti-Pag antiserum (α-Pag) was raised against a full-length recombinant Pag protein produced in E. coli. Human multiple tissue Northern blots (CLONTECH) were probed individually with an 850-bp 32P-labeled BamHI-XhoI fragment of human AOE372, a 900-bp EcoRI-XhoI fragment of human Pag, and a 2-kilobase pair human β-actin cDNA probe as per the CLONTECH protocol. Protein samples were solubilized in SDS gel loading buffer, separated by 12% SDS-PAGE, and electroblotted onto Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore Corp.) using a semidry blotter (MilliBlot-SDE, Millipore). Blots were visualized by chemiluminescence (Western-Light, Tropix). Monolayer HeLa cells were grown overnight on 18-mm diameter number 1 glass coverslips in 60 mm-diameter tissue culture dishes with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, and antibiotics. Cells were washed with PBS and fixed for 10 min at −20 °C with absolute methanol. Diluted antibodies were added in 60-μl volumes on tissue culture dishes, and the coverslips with fixed cells were inverted onto the antibodies. Antibodies were typically incubated for 1 h at room temperature. Fixative and excess antibodies were removed by several washes with PBS. Coverslips were mounted on slides with Fluormount (Virotech International). Double label immunofluorescence experiments were performed by using primary antibodies from different species of animal (rabbit and mouse) and species-specific secondary antibodies conjugated to different fluorophores (fluorescein and Texas Red). 1 × 107 HeLa cells were harvested and washed twice with PBS. The cell pellet was resuspended in 400 μl of extraction buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 10 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 1 μg/ml antipain, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 mg/ml aminoethyl benzenesulfonyl fluoride, and 1 μg/ml aprotinin) and was incubated on ice for 15 min to swell cells. 25 μl of 10% Nonidet P-40 (or IGEPAL CA-630 from Sigma) was added, and the mixture was vortexed for 10 min at 4 °C. Cells were then spun briefly at top speed to separate the cytosolic (supernatant) and the nuclear (pellet) fractions. GST-AOE372 fusion protein was expressed in E. coli from plasmid pGEX-4T-3 (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) with an insert coding for the full-length mature AOE372 protein as indicated in Fig. 1. GlutathioneS-transferase fusion protein was purified through glutathione Sepharose 4B affinity columns using Pharmacia's procedures. Pag and the mature form of native AOE372 were expressed in E. coli from plasmid pKK223–3 (Pharmacia) with a pag or AOE372 insert. Recombinant AOE372 and Pag proteins were purified by ammonium sulfate fractionation (40–60% saturation) and sequential HPLC on DEAE-Sephacel ion exchange and TSK heparin-5PW columns. Target proteins were followed by glutamine synthetase protection assay and by immunoblotting. The glutamine synthetase protection assay, indirect peroxidase assay, and in vivo oxidant (i.e. paraquat dichloride or t-butyl hydroperoxide) resistance assay were performed essentially as described (17Chae H.Z. Chung S.J. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27670-27678Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Kim K. Kim I.H. Lee K.-Y. Rhee S.G. Stadtman E.R. J. Biol.

Yeast cultivation and yeast transformation have also been described (28Jin D.-Y. Jeang K.-T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 378-387Crossref Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Probe labeling and gel mobility shift assay were performed as described previously (28Jin D.-Y. Jeang K.-T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 378-387Crossref Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Two oligonucleotides 5′-AGCTTGGGGAATCTCCGGATCCGGGGAATCTCCA-3′ and 5′-AGCTTGGAGATTCCCCGGATCCGGAGATTCCCCA-3′ were used to produce a consensus κB site probe. Calcium phosphate transfection of HeLa cells and the CAT assay were performed as described previously (31Graham F.L. Van der Eb A.J. Virology. 1973; 52: 457-467Crossref Scopus (6499) Google Scholar, 32Gorman C.M. Moffat L.F. Howard B.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1982; 2: 1044-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (5292) Google Scholar). Radioactivity on TLC plates was quantitated with a Fuji BAS2000 phosphor imager. Reporter plasmids driven individually by HTLV-1 LTR and HIV-1 LTR (pU3RCAT and pBENNCAT) have been described elsewhere (33Sodroski J.G. Rosen C.A. Haseltine W. Science. 1984; 225: 381-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar,34Gendelman H.E. Phelps W. Feigenbaum L. Ostrove J.M Adashi A. Howley P.M. Khoury G. Ginsberg H.S. Martin M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 9759-9763Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Reporter plasmids containing synthetic NF-κB motif, Sp1 motif, SRE, and the HTLV-1 21-bp motif were based on pCAT-Basic (Promega). Oligonucleotides used to produce these motifs are as follows: NF-κB motif, 5′-AGCTTGGGGAATCTCCGGATCCGGGGAATCTCCA-3′ and 5′-AGCTTGGAGATTCCCCGGATCCGGAGATTCCCCA-3′; Sp1 motif, 5′-AGCTTGGGGAGTGGCGGATCCGGGGAGTGGCA-3′ and 5′-AGCTTGCCACTCCCCGGATCCGCCACTCCCCA-3′; SRE, 5′-AGCTACCATATTAGGATCCATATTAGGT-3′ and 5′-AGCTACCTAATATGGATCCTAATATGGT-3′; HTLV-1 21-bp motif, 5′-AGCTTAGGCCCTGACGTGTCCCCCTGGATCCTAGGCCCTGACGTGTCCCCCTA-3′ and 5′-AGCTTAGGGGGACACGTCAGGGCCTAGGATCCAGGGGGACACGTCAGGGCCTA-3′. HIV infection, Western blot analysis of viral protein p24, and reverse transcriptase assay were performed as previously reported (35Huang L.-M. Jeang K.-T. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 6937-6944Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Peroxiredoxins are highly conserved in many mammalian species including human, mouse, rat, and bovine (18Yamamoto T. Matsui Y. Natori S. Obinata M. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 80: 337-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 19Ishii T. Yamada M. Sato H. Matsue M. Taketani S. Nakayama K. Sugita Y. Bannai S. J. Biol.

A. 1994; 91: 7017-7021Crossref PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar). The emerging importance of redox in various aspects of gene expression (2Sen C.K. Packer L. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 709-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (1781) Google Scholar) prompted us to investigate the function(s) of human peroxiredoxins. An initial approach employing degenerate polymerase chain reaction was attempted but found to be unsuccessful. Subsequently, we used the yeast two-hybrid assay (36Fields S. Song O. Nature. 1989; 340: 245-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (4880) Google Scholar) to identify protein-protein partners for the human thiol-specific antioxidant, Pag (20Prosperi M.-T. Ferbus D. Karczinski I. Goubin G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11050-11056Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Chae H.Z. Robison K. Poole L.B. Church G. Storz G. Rhee S.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7017-7021Crossref PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar). From 1 × 109 individual transformants in a HeLa cDNA library, we identified six interactive clones. Interestingly, two of the six were derivatives ofpag, indicating that Pag protein can homodimerize. The other four clones all contained portions of the same cDNA. A full-length cDNA was constructed (clone 372) with the 5′-sequence repaired using 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends. In the intact cDNA, a Kozak sequence (GTGGTCATGG) (37Kozak M. Cell. 1986; 44: 283-292Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3599) Google Scholar) is present at the in frame initiation codon, and a poly(A) tail is found at the 3′-end of the 0.95-kilobase pair sequence (Fig. 1). AOE372 is a novel 271-amino acid protein (apparent molecular mass of 31 kDa) that has motifs consistent with a peroxiredoxin. AOE372 has a distinctly hydrophobic region at its N terminus, which is compatible with a signal peptide (38von Heijne G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 4683-4690Crossref PubMed Scopus (3693) Google Scholar) that has putative cleavage sites at either Ser77 and Lys78 or Ala79 and Lys80. The protein sequence of AOE372 has 40–85% homology with known peroxiredoxins including yeast thiol-specific antioxidant (70% identity, 82% similarity) (30Chae H.Z. Kim I.-H. Kim K. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16815-16821Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and bacterial AhpC (alkyl hydroperoxide reductase 22-kDa protein component; 51% identity, 67% similarity) (25Chae H.Z. Robison K. Poole L.B. Church G. Storz G. Rhee S.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7017-7021Crossref PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar). An amino acid alignment of AOE372 with four known human peroxiredoxins is presented in Fig. 1 B. Notably, AOE372 conserves the two critical motifs found in all human peroxiredoxins (i.e. the cysteine-containing segments surrounding Cys47 (FFYPLDFTFVCPTEI) and Cys168 (HGEVCPA)). These cysteine motifs have been implicated as being important for catalysis of peroxides (17Chae H.Z. Chung S.J. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27670-27678Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Chae H.Z. Uhm T.B. Rhee S.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Stadtman E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15315-15321Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). At the same time, many residues in AOE372 (e.g.Thr67, Arg106, Tyr114, Lys186, Leu187, and Lys188) differ from consensus found for the other peroxiredoxins (Fig. 1 B). Because peroxiredoxin subfamilies diverge in sequence by approximately 5–10% (21Chae H.Z. Uhm T.B. Rhee S.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7022-7026Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar, 24Iwahara S. Satoh H. Song D.-X. Webb J. Burlingame A.L. Nagae Y. Muller-Eberhard U. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13398-13406Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), AOE372 phylogenetically segregates from known peroxiredoxins into a new subfamily branch (Fig. 1 C). (A new suggested nomenclature for the AOE372 subfamily is peroxiredoxin IV. By this convention, Pag, thiol-specific antioxidant/Tpx, and MER5 represent prototypes for the peroxiredoxin I, II, and III subfamilies, respectively.)2 We wished to assess the antioxidant activity of AOE372. We overexpressed full-length protein inE. coli and purified it to stainable single polypeptide homogeneity. Purified AOE372 was assessed by reducing SDS-PAGE (e.g. Fig. 6 A) and was verified to be a single discrete band. Using this preparation, we assayed the antioxidant potential of AOE372. A known peroxiredoxin activity is the protection of glutamine synthetase from inactivation by thiol-dependent metal-catalyzed oxidation (25Chae H.Z. Robison K. Poole L.B. Church G. Storz G. Rhee S.G.

Commun. 1994; 201: 8-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). We performed two assays for glutamine synthetase protection and for thioredoxin-linked thiol peroxidase activity. In both assays, AOE372 was highly active (Fig.2, A and B). Accordingly, recombinant AOE372 scavenged H2O2in the presence of thioredoxin, thioredoxin reductase, and NADPH with reaction kinetics and potency virtually identical to a previously characterized peroxiredoxin, thiol-specific antioxidant (17Chae H.Z. Chung S.J. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27670-27678Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These results biochemically identify AOE372 as a functional human thioredoxin peroxidase. Expression of AOE372 mRNA in human tissues and cell lines was analyzed by Northern blotting. AOE372 transcript has an apparent size of 1.0 kilobase pair (Fig.3, upper panel). AOE372 mRNA is ubiquitously expressed in all tested human cell lines including promyelocytic leukemia HL60, HeLa S3, chronic myelogenous leukemia K562, lymphoblastic leukemia MOLT-4, Burkitt's lymphoma Raji, colorectal adenocarcinoma SW480, lung carcinoma A549, and melanoma G361 (Fig. 3 C). However, the expression levels vary significantly between different tissues, with pancreas > liver > heart, (skeletal) muscle, colon (mucosal lining) and testis > ovary > placenta, lung, kidney, and prostate > (small) intestine, thymus, spleen, and brain (Fig. 3, A and B). By Northern blotting, AOE372 mRNA was not detected in peripheral blood leukocytes. To check that peroxiredoxins could be differentially regulated at the level of tissue-specific expression, we also probed for the expression profile of pag mRNA. We found that the AOE372 and pag expression patterns contrasted distinctly (compare Fig. 3, top panels, AOE372; with Fig. 3,middle panels, pag). In the same blots, whereaspag was preferentially abundant in spleen, thymus, and brain, AOE372 was more highly expressed in tissues such as pancreas (Fig. 3). Thus, there exist tissue-distinct expression profiles for different peroxiredoxins. To characterize AOE372, we raised rabbit antiserum (372-1) to a keyhole limpet hemocyanin-conjugated C-terminal AOE372 peptide (see Fig. 1 for sequence of synthetic peptide). Antibody 372-1 reacts specifically with either recombinant GST-AOE372 fusion protein (55 kDa) or native HeLa cell AOE372 protein (23 kDa) (Fig. 4,A and B, lane 2). We used this antibody to assess the protein expression of AOE372 by Western blotting. As shown in Fig. 4 C, the protein patterns (pancreas > liver > heart > spleen and thymus) are generally consistent with the mRNA profiles (Fig. 3, Aand B). Because the location of a protein inside cells can provide important information toward function, we stained human cells to determine the subcellular locale(s) for AOE372. AOE372 was found predominantly in the cytoplasm (Fig. 5 A,panel 2). Control stainings performed with either preimmune serum (Fig. 5 A, panel 1) or 372-1 antibody first neutralized with an excess of immunizing peptide (Fig. 5 A,panel 3) verified the specificity of the stained signals. The cytoplasmic staining of AOE372 is consistent with a similar compartmentalization for Pag (Fig. 5 A, panel 4). The immunostainings were verified biochemically by parallel detergent fractionations of cells. Fig. 5 B shows that AOE372 and Pag co-fractionated with β-tubulin (a well characterized cytoplasmic protein) and were separated distinctly from NuMA (nuclear/mitotic apparatus protein, a well characterized nuclear marker) (42Compton D.A.

Standard state redox potential (E°′) values for glutaredoxins are presently unknown, and use of glutathione/glutathione disulfide (GSH/GSSG) redox buffers for determining E°′ resulted in variable levels of GSH-mixed disulfides. To overcome this complication, we have used reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography to separate and quantify the oxidized and reduced forms present in the thiol-disulfide exchange reaction at equilibrium after mixing one oxidized and one reduced protein. This allowed for direct and quantitative pair-wise comparisons of the reducing capacities of the proteins and mutant forms. Equilibrium constants from pair-wise reaction with thioredoxin or its P34H mutant, which have accurately determined E°′ values from their redox equilibrium with NADPH catalyzed by thioredoxin reductase, allowed for transformation into standard state values. Using this new procedure, the standard state redox potentials for the Escherichia coliglutaredoxins 1 and 3, which contain identical active site sequences CPYC, were found to be E°′ = −233 and −198 mV, respectively. These values were confirmed independently by using the thermodynamic linkage between the stability of the disulfide bond and the stability of the protein to denaturation. Comparison of calculatedE°′ values from a number of proteins ranging from −270 mV for E. coli Trx to −124 mV for DsbA obtained using this method with those determined using glutathione redox buffers provides independent confirmation of the standard state redox potential of glutathione as −240 mV. Determining redox potentials through direct protein-protein equilibria is of general interest as it overcomes errors in determining redox potentials calculated from large equilibrium constants with the strongly reducing NADPH or by accumulating mixed disulfides with GSH.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 2275-2279Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). The presence of an additional hydrogen donor system for ribonucleotide reductase was postulated since a double mutant lacking both Grx1 and Trx was viable (2Russel M. Holmgren A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 990-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The search for this third hydrogen donor system resulted in the isolation of two additional glutaredoxins in E. coli, Grx2 and Grx3 (3Åslund F. Ehn B. Miranda-Vizuete A. Pueyo C. Holmgren A. Proc.

The recent structural characterization of Grx3 showed that in addition to the 33% amino acid sequence identity with Grx1, the two proteins have highly conserved secondary structure elements and overall fold (4Åslund F.

However, despite Grx1 and Grx3 being closely related 9-kDa redox proteins with identical active-site sequences (CPYC), Grx3 exhibits only a fraction of the activity of Grx1 as a reductant of ribonucleotide reductase (NrdAB and NrdEF; Refs. 3Åslund F.

One possible explanation for these observed differences would be a difference in redox potential between the two glutaredoxins. Considerable experimental and theoretical effort has been focused on the role the residues between the active site cysteines (CX 1 X 2C) play as a determinant for the standard state redox potential (E°′) of the thioredoxin superfamily of proteins. The first mutagenesis studies (6Joelson T. Sjoberg B.M. Eklund H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3183-3188Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Krause G. Lundström J. Lopez-Barea J. Pueyo de la Cuesta C. Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9494-9500Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrated that redox potential of a protein could be made more oxidizing or reducing by simply substituting the residuesX 1 and X 2 for those of a protein whose redox potential was either more oxidizing or reducing, respectively. For example, the mutant TrxPDI, mimicking the active site of protein disulfide isomerase (PDI), results in a change of 35 mV in the expected direction (more oxidizing), yet this value remains far from that of PDI (7Krause G. Lundström J. Lopez-Barea J. Pueyo de la Cuesta C. Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9494-9500Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The redox potential for the DsbATrx mutant (−214 mV 2M. Huber-Wunderlich and R. Glockshuber, personal communication. ), although 90 mV more reducing than the wild-type protein, is still far from the value ofE°′ = −270 mV determined for Trx (6Joelson T. Sjoberg B.M. Eklund H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3183-3188Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A similar mutation of one of the Trx-like domains of PDI decreased E°′ from −145 to −215 mV (8Kortemme T. Darby N.J. Creighton T.E. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 14503-14511Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). A subsequent study confirmed these findings using a more extensive set of mutants (9Grauschopf U. Winther J.R. Korber P. Zander T. Dallinger P. Bardwell J.C.A. Cell. 1995; 83: 947-955Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar), demonstrating that at least for DsbA, a relationship between the redox potential and the pK a value of the N-terminal active-site cysteine residue exists (9Grauschopf U. Winther J.R. Korber P. Zander T. Dallinger P. Bardwell J.C.A. Cell. 1995; 83: 947-955Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar), as predicted by the Brønsted relationship using small thiol-containing molecules (10Szajewski R.P. Whitesides G.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1980; 102: 2011-2026Crossref Scopus (385) Google Scholar). Whereas the thioredoxin superfamily of oxidoreductases have redox potentials spanning a wide range, peptides containing the active-site sequences of selected oxidoreductases have surprisingly similar redox potentials (11Siedler F. Rudolph-Böhner S. Doi M. Musiol H.J. Moroder L. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 7488-7495Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). This observation underscores the fact that redox potentials of native proteins are determined by interactions in the folded state resulting in a rather poor predictive ability of the active site sequence even when present in a common three-dimensional framework (6Joelson T. Sjoberg B.M. Eklund H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3183-3188Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Krause G. Lundström J. Lopez-Barea J. Pueyo de la Cuesta C. Holmgren A. J. Biol.

Cell. 1995; 83: 947-955Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). This is the case with Grx1 and Grx3, which have identical active-site sequences yet only 33% sequence identity in their overall similar fold (4Åslund F. Nordstrand K. Berndt K.D. Nikkola M.

Knowledge of the redox potentials of these two glutaredoxins is important in light of their catalytic properties, which on one hand show similar activity in reducing GSH-mixed disulfides (3Åslund F.

A. 1994; 91: 9813-9817Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), a property that does not involve the intramolecular disulfide form of the protein (12Bushweller J.H. Åslund F. Wüthrich K. Holmgren A. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 9288-9293Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar), and on the other hand display large differences in the capacity to reduce protein disulfides, e.g. ribonucleotide reductase or insulin (4Åslund F. Nordstrand K. Berndt K.D. Nikkola M. Bergman T. Ponstingl H. Jörnvall H. Otting G. Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6736-6745Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The standard state redox potential E°′ for a protein can be calculated from the equilibrium constant of the redox reaction involving a reference with known redox potential using the Nernst equation. The commonly used references are defined glutathione/glutathione disulfide (GSH/GSSG) buffers or NADPH/NADP+ coupled via an appropriate reductase (13Gilbert H.F. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1990; 63: 69-172PubMed Google Scholar). Standard state redox potentials within the thioredoxin family of thiol-disulfide oxidoreductases range from E°′ = −124 (14Zapun A. Bardwell J.C.A. Creighton T.E. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 5083-5092Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 15Wunderlich M. Jaenicke R. Glockshuber R. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 233: 559-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) to −270 mV (7Krause G. Lundström J. Lopez-Barea J. Pueyo de la Cuesta C. Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9494-9500Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), corresponding to an overall equilibrium constant of nearly 105. Since the precision in the determination of an equilibrium constant is highest the closer the equilibrium constant is to unity, one reference is insufficient to obtain accurate data within this span of redox potentials. In addition, the lack of a consensus for the value of the standard state redox potential of a commonly used redox reference standard contributes to apparently conflicting data in the literature. For example, cited values for the standard state redox potential of glutathione ( EGSH°′) range from −205 to −260 mV (10Szajewski R.P. Whitesides G.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1980; 102: 2011-2026Crossref Scopus (385) Google Scholar, 13Gilbert H.F. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1990; 63: 69-172PubMed Google Scholar, 16Rost J. Rapoport S.

Largely as a consequence of this ambiguity, in addition to technical difficulties in quenching a thiol-disulfide interchange reaction (18Darby N.J. Creighton T.E. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 16770-16780Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), the reported redox potential for some proteins, such as protein disulfide isomerase (PDI), ranges fromE°′ = −110 (19Hawkins H.C. de Nardi M. Freedman R.B. Biochem. J. 1991; 275: 341-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) to −190 mV (20Lundström J. Holmgren A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 6649-6655Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), a discrepancy of no less than a factor of 500 in equilibrium constant. We have developed a method for the determination of redox potentials by direct protein-protein equilibration that has a number of advantages compared with commonly used techniques for redox determinations. Direct equilibration techniques have been used successfully with low molecular weight thiols (10Szajewski R.P. Whitesides G.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1980; 102: 2011-2026Crossref Scopus (385) Google Scholar), peptides, and proteins (8Kortemme T. Darby N.J. Creighton T.E.

Biol. 1993; 233: 559-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) in equilibration with low molecular weight thiols (e.g. GSSG or β-hydroxyethylene disulfide). Here we demonstrate that direct protein-protein equilibration can also be used successfully to determine redox potential differences between proteins. When applied toE. coli Grx1 and Grx3, standard state redox potentialsE°′ = −198 and −233 mV were obtained, which were confirmed using a thermodynamic linkage relationship between the stability of the protein and the stability of the disulfide bond (i.e. the redox potential). Through multiple independent pair-wise linkages of protein-protein redox equilibria, we have established an accurate relative redox scale that is linked to the well defined standard state of NADPH of E°′ = −315 mV (21Clark W.M. Oxidation Potentials of Organic Systems. Williams & Wilkins, Baltimore1960: 471-514Google Scholar), which presents a unifying picture of the thioredoxin superfamily of thiol-disulfide oxidoreductases. A mutant of E. coli Grx3 with Cys-65 replaced by tyrosine, available from this laboratory, 3A. Sandström, K. D. Berndt, F. Åslund, A. Holmgren, and G. Otting, unpublished results. was selected for this work. The absence of the third, nonactive-site cysteine in position 65 eliminates the tendency of this protein to form intermolecular disulfide-linked multimers (dimers, trimers, and tetramers) as well as the formation of a mixed disulfide with GSH with accompanying decreased catalytic activity.3 This mutant has essentially identical enzymatic activity as the wild-type enzyme3 and will be referred to throughout this work simply as Grx3. Overexpressed Grx3 displays some heterogeneity due to variable degrees of cleavage of the N-terminal Met residue (4Åslund F. Nordstrand K. Berndt K.D. Nikkola M. Bergman T. Ponstingl H. Jörnvall H.

To circumvent this problem, we have used a preparation of Grx3 that was found to be essentially 100% in the non-Met form. E. coliGrx1 (22Björnberg O. Holmgren A. Protein Expression Purif. 1991; 2: 287-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), Trx (23Dyson H.J. Holmgren A. Wright P.E.

Chem. 1991; 266: 9494-9500Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were homogenous preparations from this laboratory. The DsbA mutant with the active-site tetrapeptide sequence changed into that of thioredoxin, DsbATrx,2 was generously provided by Dr. Martina Wunderlich and Professor Rudi Glockshuber, ETH- Hönggerberg, Zürich Switzerland. Protein-protein equilibrium reactions (100 μl) typically contained 50 μm each of two redox-active proteins in a degassed and N2-purged solution of 100 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, 1 mm EDTA. The reduced form of a protein was prepared immediately before use by incubation of protein (1 mm) for 1 h at room temperature in the presence of 10 mm dithiothreitol, followed by Sephadex G-25 gel filtration chromatography (NAP-5, Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). Redox reactions between two proteins were initiated by adding one of the two proteins in the reduced state and the other in the oxidized state, whereafter the sample was left to equilibrate at room temperature. After 4 and 12 h, aliquots (20 μl) of each sample were quenched by the addition of 10 μl of 1 m phosphoric acid to a final pH of 2.5 followed by immediate HPLC analysis. The oxidized and reduced forms of the proteins present in the samples were separated by reverse-phase HPLC (Pharmacia SMART micropurification system) on a C8 column (2.1 mm × 10 cm) using a gradient from 22–50% (v/v) acetonitrile, 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid in 120 min at a flow rate of 0.1 ml/min at room temperature. Column effluent was monitored at 214 and 280 nm. The amounts of oxidized and reduced forms of each protein in the quenched equilibrium mixture was obtained from peak areas after integration of the chromatograms. Essentially identical results were obtained from analysis of chromatograms recorded at 214 and 280 nm, and the former was used in subsequent analysis. The mechanism of thiol-disulfide exchange is believed to be a two-step reaction proceeding through a mixed disulfide intermediate (Eq. 1). The breakdown of the protein-protein-mixed disulfide appears to be very rapid, as it is not normally populated under standard conditions. The apparent concentration equilibrium constant,K 12′, for the thiol disulfide exchange reaction between protein A and protein B involves only the oxidized forms (ASS, BSS) and reduced forms (ASHSH, BSHSH) of the two proteins involved (Eq.2). ASHSH+BSS⇌K1′[ASHS⎻⎻HSSB]⇌K2′ASS+BSHSHEquation 1 K1′·K2′=K12′=[ASS][BSHSH][ASHSH][BSS]Equation 2 EA°′−EB°′=ΔEAB°′=RTnFlnK12′Equation 3 The difference in redox potentials between the two proteins, ΔEAB°′, can then be obtained using the Nernst equation (Eq. 3), where n is the number of electrons transferred in the reaction (here n = 2),F is Faraday's constant (23,040.612 cal·mol−1·V−1), and R is the gas constant (1.987 cal·K−1·mol−1). Redox equilibria were established by incubating Grx1, Grx3, and TrxPDI at a concentration of 50 μm each protein in a degassed and nitrogen-purged redox buffer containing 10 mm GSH and 1 mm GSSG in 100 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, 1 mm EDTA, and 6 m GdnHCl. As a control, a parallel sample containing the folded forms of the proteins was prepared in an identical buffer without GdnHCl. The reactions were equilibrated for 12 h at room temperature followed by acid quenching (as described above) and immediate HPLC separation. The concentration of GSH in the redox buffer was measured by determination of the total thiol content spectrophotometrically (ε412 = 13,600 m−1·cm−1) using 5,5′-dithiobis(nitrobenzoic acid) both at the beginning and at the end of the equilibrium reaction. The concentrations of the oxidized and the reduced forms of each protein were obtained from the corresponding peak areas (214 nm) in the HPLC chromatograms. From the thiol-disulfide exchange reaction of the unfolded protein with glutathione (Eq. 4), the overall equilibrium constantK 12′ can be calculated (Eq.5). Given the 1 m standard state redox potential of GSH, EGSH°′ (−240 mV, see below), the standard state redox potential of the denatured state, EU°′, is obtained according to Equation 6.

Unfolding was monitored by ellipticity at 222 nm (Aviv 62DS spectropolarimeter; Aviv Associates Inc., Lakewood, NJ) as additions of GdnHCl were made automatically from an identical solution containing, in addition, 5.7 mGdnHCl, as determined by refractometry (24Nozaki Y. Methods Enzymol. 1972; 26: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar) using a computer-controlled microtitrator (Hamilton 540B, Reno, NV). After each addition, 5 min was allowed for equilibration, during which time the cuvette was stirred with the spectrophotometer shutters closed. Parallel experiments using manual titration and protein concentrations of 17 and 43 μm for Grx1 and Grx3, respectively, were analyzed after an overnight equilibration. The manual experiments were designed to contain a minimum of 10 points in each of the pre-transition, transition, and post-transition regions of the unfolding curves. The raw CD data (θ, in units of millidegrees were first transformed to units of molar CD of the amide chromophore Δε (M−1·cm−1) using the relationship, Δε=θ32980·l·cEquation 7 where l is the sample path length (cm) andc is the residue molar concentration of protein. The data (Δε versus [GdnHCl]) were fit using nonlinear regression (Igor Pro software package; WaveMetrics, Lake Oswego, OR) to a general equation (Eq. 8) describing the experimentally observable Δε as a function of denaturant concentration, [D], which includes the linear extrapolation method (25Santoro M.M. Bolen D.W. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 8063-8068Crossref PubMed Scopus (1609) Google Scholar). Δε=(ΔεN+mN[D])+(ΔεU+mU[D])·e(−(ΔGH2O°+mG[D])RT1+e(−(ΔGH2O°+mG[D])RTEquation 8 Here ΔεN and ΔεU are the molar CD values of the native and unfolded protein, respectively, extrapolated to zero M denaturant, and m N andm U are the slopes of the pre- and post-transition region base lines. The parametersm G and ΔGH2O° are the values of the slope and intercept, respectively, of the linear extrapolation of unfolding Gibbs energy changes versusdenaturant concentration. For purposes of presentation only, Δε was converted to fraction of unfolded protein (f u ) with the relationship f u = [(ΔεN +m N) − Δε]/[(ΔεN +m N) − (ΔεU +m U)] using the values of ΔεN, ΔεU, m N, andm U obtained from Eq. 8. The popular method of determining a redox potential using defined ratios of GSH/GSSG as redox references (Eq. 4–6) is complicated in the case of glutaredoxins due to the presence of significant amounts of the GSH-mixed disulfide intermediates (Fig.1 A), which may be unique to the glutaredoxins that have been shown to contain a binding site for glutathione (4Åslund F. Nordstrand K. Berndt K.D. Nikkola M. Bergman T. Ponstingl H. Jörnvall H. Otting G. Holmgren A. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 9288-9293Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Under certain circumstances, β-mercaptoethanol-mixed disulfides with Trx have been trapped successfully and were used for the determination of the equilibrium constants K1′ and K2′ (26Wynn R. Cocco M.J. Richards F.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11807-11813Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). We found that the amounts of the GSH-mixed-disulfide form of the glutaredoxins recovered by HPLC varied substantially depending on the quenching procedure. In view of the apparent problem of perturbing the equilibrium of this mixture upon quenching in the presence of the large excess of GSH/GSSG, we searched for more direct methods of determining redox potentials. In principle, differences in redox potential between two proteins, ΔEAB°′, could be obtained by determining the concentrations of their oxidized and reduced forms (Eq.1–3) at equilibrium. The success of such a method would rely on the nonspecificity of the thiol-disulfide exchange and the ability to quench and subsequently quantify equilibrium populations. The latter two are conveniently achieved by acidification followed by reverse-phase HPLC separation and quantification of the individual species. To ensure that a true state of redox equilibrium between the two proteins in question was obtained in incubations for 4 h, we verified with each protein pair that essentially identical equilibrium constants were obtained irrespective of the redox state of the initial mixture (i.e. ASS and BSHSH or BSS and ASHSH). Several reactions were subjected to a second analysis after 12 h of incubation at room temperature to ensure that the reactions were at equilibrium at 4 h. The elution times of the fully oxidized and fully reduced (with excess dithiothreitol) proteins were obtained in separate runs by injecting identical amounts of each protein. This procedure also revealed essentially identical molar extinction coefficients for the reduced forms compared with the oxidized forms of each protein, as might be expected at 214 and 280 nm. Using this method, we determined a value for ofK 12′ = 15.2 between Grx1 and Grx3 at pH 7.0 (Fig. 2 A). Thus, according to Eq. 3, Grx3 is 35 mV more oxidizing than Grx1, a fact that is rationalized at least qualitatively by noticing that in Fig. 2 A, the equilibrium concentration of Grx3red is greater than that of Grxox, whereas the opposite is true of Grx1. The validity of the redox potential difference measured in this way can be assessed by independently measuring the pair-wise differences of Grx1 and Grx3 to a third, common redox-active partner. As an example, Figs. 2, B andC show chromatograms of the quenched pair-wise equilibria of Grx3 and Grx1, respectively, with TrxPDI. This mutant was chosen over wild-type Trx, as it has a more favorable redox potential for comparison with the more oxidizing glutaredoxins. From these chromatograms, we determinedK 12′ = 17.78 for the Grx3/TrxPDI pair andK 12′ = 1.17 for the Grx1/TrxPDI pair, corresponding to redox potential differences of ΔEAB°′ = 37 and 2 mV, respectively. The difference between these values (35 mV) confirms the result obtained from direct equilibration between Grx1 and Grx3. Following this strategy, we extended our comparisons to establish a network of differences based on pair-wise equilibria between selected thiol-disulfide oxidoreductases, which resulted in an unambiguous relative scaling of their reducing capacities summarized in Fig. 3.Figure 3Overall scheme of standard state redox potentials of the thioredoxin family of thiol-disulfide oxidoreductases.

The protein kinase C isozyme that mediates preconditioning has not yet been identified. Using a cell culture model of hypoxic preconditioning, we found that cardiac myocyte viability after 9 h of hypoxia was increased by more than 50% over control. Preconditioning activated protein kinase C isozymes as evidenced by translocation from one cell compartment to another as follows: there was a 2.1-fold increase in ε-protein kinase C activation, a 2.8-fold increase in δ-protein kinase C activation, and no increase in βI-protein kinase C activation. 4β-Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate mimicked hypoxic preconditioning, increasing myocyte survival after prolonged hypoxia by 34% compared with control. We previously identified an ε-protein kinase C-selective antagonist, εV1-2 peptide, that inhibits ε-protein kinase C translocation and function in cardiac myocytes (Johnson, J. A., Gray, M. O., Chen, C.-H., and Mochly-Rosen, D. (1996) J. Biol. Chem. 271, 24962–24966). εV1-2 peptide abolished hypoxic preconditioning and phorbol ester-mediated cardiac protection. Therefore, preconditioning can be induced in this culture model, and activation of ε-protein kinase C is critical for cardiac myocyte protection.

Therefore, preconditioning can be induced in this culture model, and activation of ε-protein kinase C is critical for cardiac myocyte protection. Identification of novel therapeutic targets for the prevention of ischemia-induced cardiac injury has been an area of intense investigation for the past 10 years. First described in a canine heart model (1Murry C.E. Jennings R.B. Reimer K.A. Circulation. 1986; 74: 1124-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (7040) Google Scholar), preconditioning of cardiac tissue with one or more brief episodes of ischemia remains one of the most potent experimental means of reducing irreversible tissue injury during subsequent prolonged ischemia. However, the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying this protective phenomenon remain obscure. Numerous molecules such as adenosine, α1-agonists, angiotensin II, bradykinin, and opioids have been invoked as potential mediators of ischemic preconditioning in whole heart models (2Liu Y. Gao W.D. O'Rourke B. Marban E. Circ. Res. 1996; 78: 443-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 3Hu K. Nattel S. Circulation. 1995; 92: 2259-2265Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 4Liu Y.

Res. 1996; 78: 1100-1104Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). Although the exogenous mediators of preconditioning have not been definitively identified, there is substantial experimental evidence that one of the major intracellular signal transduction pathways underlying cardiac protection involves activation of protein kinase C (PKC). 1The abbreviations used are: PKC, protein kinase C; LDH, lactate dehydrogenase; PMA, 4β-phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate. At least six different PKC isozymes have been identified in rat cardiac myocytes (7Rybin V.O. Steinberg S.F. Circ. Res. 1994; 74: 299-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar,8Disatnik M.-H. Buraggi G. Mochly-Rosen D. Exp. Cell Res. 1994; 210: 287-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar), where PKC regulates a number of functions such as force of contraction (9Capogrossi M.C. Kaku T. Filbarn C.R. Pelto D.J. Hansford R.G. Spurgeon H.A. Lakatta E.G. Circ. Res. 1990; 66: 1143-1155Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), atrial natriuretic factor secretion (10Irons C.E. Sei C.A. Hidaka H. Glembotski C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5211-5216Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and gene expression (11Kariya K. Karns L.R. Simpson P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10023-10026Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Individual isozymes translocate to characteristic intracellular sites following activation (12Disatnik M.-H. Jones S. Mochly-Rosen D. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1995; 27: 2473-2481Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 13Henry P. Demolombe S. Pucéat M. Escande D. Circ. Res. 1996; 78: 161-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) with each isozyme playing a different role in myocyte function (14Johnson J.A. Mochly-Rosen D. Circ. Res. 1995; 76: 654-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 15Jiang T. Pak E. Zhang H. Kline R.P. Steinberg S.F. Circ. Res. 1996; 78: 724-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Activation of PKC correlates closely with the cardiac protection mediated by ischemic preconditioning in rat whole heart models. For example, PKC stimulation with dioctanoylglycerol protected adult rat heart during 45 min of regional ischemia, whereas PKC inhibition with chelerythrine abolished protection mediated by ischemic preconditioning (16Speechly-Dick M.E. Mocanu M.M. Yellon D.M. Circ. Res. 1994; 75: 586-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). In addition, activation of PKC by transient ischemia or α1-agonists in an isolated rat heart model induced protection against global ischemia/reperfusion injury that was inhibited by PKC antagonists (17Mitchell M.B. Meng X. Ao L. Brown J.M. Harken A.H. Banerjee A. Circ. Res. 1995; 76: 73-81Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Studies of ischemic preconditioning in whole heart models have been limited by technical issues such as the relatively low specificity of available antagonists for PKC versus other kinases, the inability of agonists and antagonists to discriminate among multiple PKC isozymes, and the difficulty of examining signal transduction mechanisms at the level of the individual cell. Cardiac myocyte culture models may provide complementary approaches to the investigation of signal transduction in preconditioning. In one such culture model, a 25-min exposure to hypoxia followed by reoxygenation protected cardiac myocytes against membrane damage for up to 6 h of severe hypoxia, and pretreatment of cells with phorbol ester mimicked the protective effects of hypoxic preconditioning (18Webster K.A. Discher D.J. Bishopric N.H. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1995; 27: 453-458Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In this study, we identified two hypoxic preconditioning protocols that substantially improved the viability of cultured neonatal rat cardiac myocytes following several hours of profound hypoxia. We found that both protocols induced a selective activation of PKC isozymes as evidenced by translocation and that direct activation of PKC with a phorbol ester mimicked the protective effect of hypoxic preconditioning. Moreover, we used a novel 8-amino acid antagonist of εPKC, εV1-2 peptide, to identify the isozyme that mediates this protective effect. We previously proposed the use in general of such isozyme-selective peptide inhibitors of PKC translocation and function (19Mochly-Rosen D. Science. 1995; 268: 247-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar). εV1-2 peptide is derived from the first unique region (V1) of εPKC (amino acids 14–21), and its action as a selective antagonist of εPKC translocation and function in cardiac myocytes has been characterized in detail (20Johnson J.A. Gray M.O. Chen C.-H. Mochly-Rosen D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24962-24966Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). Introduction of this peptide into myocytes selectively inhibited PMA-induced translocation of εPKC but not the translocation of other PKC isozymes (20Johnson J.A. Gray M.O. Chen C.-H. Mochly-Rosen D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24962-24966Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). Furthermore, there was a selective loss of regulation of contraction rate in the presence of εV1-2 that was not seen with βC2-4, a translocation inhibitor selective for the cPKC isozymes (20Johnson J.A. Gray M.O. Chen C.-H. Mochly-Rosen D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24962-24966Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar, 21Ron D. Luo J. Mochly-Rosen D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24180-24187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Using εV1-2 in a different cell culture model, we also showed that εPKC mediates, at least in part, glucose-induced insulin secretion in pancreatic cells (22Yedovitzky M. Mochly-Rosen D. Johnson J.A. Gray M.O. Ron D. Abramovitch E. Cerasi E. Nesher R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1417-1420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). In the present study, we introduced εV1-2 peptide into cardiac myocytes and showed for the first time that isozyme-selective inhibition of εPKC translocation and function inhibited the protective effect of preconditioning. These data indicate a major role for the εPKC isozyme in cardiac myocyte protection by hypoxic preconditioning. Primary cultures were prepared as described previously (23Simpson P. McGrath A. Savion S. Circ. Res. 1982; 51: 787-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). After removal of non-myocytes in a preplating step, isolated myocytes (90–95% of the cells) were seeded at 800 cells per mm2 into 8-well glass chamber slides (Nunc) for cell viability assays and immunofluorescence staining, into 6-well plastic culture plates (Fisher) for lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) assays, or into 100-mm glass culture dishes for Western blot analysis. On culture day 4, myocytes were placed in defined medium (23Simpson P. McGrath A. Savion S. Circ. Res. 1982; 51: 787-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar) then fed with fresh defined medium on the evening prior to treatment (days 6–8). For hypoxic preconditioning and prolonged hypoxic challenges, myocytes were transferred into and out of a plexiglass glove box (Anaerobic Systems) maintained at 37 °C with a humidified atmosphere of 1% CO2, less than 0.5% O2, and the balance N2. Monitoring with a Fyrite Gas Analyzer (United Technologies) verified O2concentrations between 0.2 and 0.5%. Lysis of samples for Western blot analyses and fixation of myocytes for immunofluorescence staining were performed without reoxygenation. Normoxic incubations of myocytes were conducted in a water-jacketed incubator (Forma Scientific) gassed with 99% air and 1% CO2 at 37 °C. Hypoxic preconditioning initially consisted of four 90-min periods of hypoxia alternating with 60-min normoxic incubations. Myocytes were kept in 5 mm glucose defined medium throughout the protocol. For subsequent single cycle preconditioning experiments, myocytes were fed pre-equilibrated, glucose-free defined medium within the hypoxia chamber for 30 min. For phorbol ester preconditioning experiments, myocytes were stimulated with 10 nm PMA for 10 min then washed with fresh 5 mm glucose defined medium. We previously reported that 2 h of hypoxia resulted in a medium pO2 of 23.9 ± 1.5 torr, pH of 7.34 ± 0.02, and pCO2 of 46.6 ± 0.7 torr. LDH release from glucose-supplemented myocytes subjected to 2 h of hypoxia and from glucose-deprived myocytes subjected to 30 or 60 min of hypoxia was no different from normoxic control cells (24Rocha-Singh K.J. Honbo N.Y. Karliner J.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 88: 204-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). These data suggested that hypoxic preconditioning does not cause irreversible cellular damage, an assumption that we verified using a cell viability assay (see below). In all cases, myocytes were subjected to a prolonged hypoxic challenge by transfer into the plexiglass chamber followed by feeding with glucose-free defined medium pre-equilibrated for several hours within the hypoxic environment. Cells were removed 7–9 h later and immediately underwent the indicated analysis. Western blot analysis was carried out as described previously in our laboratory (14Johnson J.A. Mochly-Rosen D. Circ. Res. 1995; 76: 654-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) using monoclonal anti-αPKC and anti-βPKC antibodies (Seikagaku) diluted 1:1000 and then rabbit anti-mouse IgG antibodies (Cappel) at 1:1000 dilution or using rabbit polyclonal anti-δPKC and anti-εPKC antibodies (Life Technologies, Inc.) at 1:300 dilution, followed by125I-protein A (ICN) and detection of PKC immunoreactive bands by autoradiography. Following treatment of myocytes grown on chamber slides, living and dead cells were distinguished using the EukolightTM Viability/Cytotoxicity assay (Molecular Probes). Culture medium was replaced with 2 μm calcein acetoxymethyl ester and 4 μm ethidium homodimer-1. Slides were viewed with a Zeiss IM35 microscope using a 40 × water immersion objective. Viable (green fluorescent by calcein) and non-viable (red fluorescent by ethidium) myocytes present in 10–20 random microscopic fields per condition per experiment were recorded. Immunofluorescence staining was carried out using identical antibodies as described previously (8Disatnik M.-H. Buraggi G. Mochly-Rosen D. Exp. Cell Res. 1994; 210: 287-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar, 20Johnson J.A. Gray M.O. Chen C.-H. Mochly-Rosen D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24962-24966Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). Isozyme-specific rabbit polyclonal antibodies (R & D Antibodies) directed against βIPKC, δPKC, or εPKC were used at 1:100 dilution followed by fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG antibodies (Cappel) diluted 1:1000 and were viewed with a Zeiss IM35 microscope using a 40 × water immersion objective. Images were recorded on Kodak TMAX 400 film with exposure time of 1 s for all photomicrographs and were processed by an automated, commercial developer without additional adjustment. The specificity of the immunostaining technique used to detect εPKC in the present study has been confirmed previously. First, pre-absorption of primary antibody with the immunizing peptide (8Disatnik M.-H. Buraggi G. Mochly-Rosen D. Exp. Cell Res. 1994; 210: 287-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar) or with the corresponding recombinant PKC expressed in Sf9 cells (20Johnson J.A. Gray M.O. Chen C.-H. Mochly-Rosen D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24962-24966Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar) abolished specific staining (see also Fig. 3 C). Second, there was a direct correlation between translocation of εPKC measured by Western blot analysis and that measured by immunofluoresence staining (14Johnson J.A. Mochly-Rosen D. Circ. Res. 1995; 76: 654-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 20Johnson J.A. Gray M.O. Chen C.-H. Mochly-Rosen D. J. Biol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 24180-24187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Finally, the immunostaining pattern seen with commercial antibody was identical to that found using monoclonal antibody (CK 1.4) to εPKC (25Mochly-Rosen D. Henrich C.J. Cheever L. Khaner H. Simpson P.C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1990; 1: 693-706Crossref Scopus (224) Google Scholar). The effect of hypoxia on LDH release from cardiac myocytes was assessed as described previously (24Rocha-Singh K.J. Honbo N.Y. Karliner J.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 88: 204-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Following each treatment, culture media were stored at 4 °C. An equal volume of cold lysing buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and 1 mm EDTA) was added to each well, and lysates were centrifuged at 4 °C for 15 min at 50,000 × g. Aliquots from culture media samples (released LDH) and from supernatants of cell lysates (retained LDH) were analyzed using an assay in which the rate of decrease in absorbance of the sample at 340 nm is directly proportional to LDH activity (Sigma). LDH activity was expressed as units per liter, where 1 unit is defined as the amount of enzyme catalyzing the formation of 1 μmol/liter NAD per min under the conditions of the assay. Transient permeabilization of cardiac myocytes was carried out exactly as described previously using buffer containing saponin (50 μg/ml) and ATP (6 mm) at 4 °C (26Johnson J.A. Gray M.O. Karliner J.S. Mochly-Rosen D. Circ. Res. 1996; 79: 1086-1099Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Permeabilization carried out according to this protocol did not alter myocyte viability, spontaneous or stimulated contraction rates, basal or hormone-induced expression of c-fos mRNA, or growth factor-induced hypertrophy (26Johnson J.A. Gray M.O. Karliner J.S. Mochly-Rosen D. Circ. Res. 1996; 79: 1086-1099Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). All peptides used in this study, εV1-2 (EAVSLKPT, εPKC-(14–21)), εV1-3 (LAVFHDA, εPKC-(81–87)), and βC2-4 (SLNPEWNET, βPKC-(218–226)), were synthesized at the Beckman Center Protein and Nucleic Acid Facility at Stanford University and more than 95% pure. Phorbol esters were purchased from LC Laboratories. Monoclonal anti-human Hsp70 antibody was purchased from StressGen Biotechnologies. All other reagents were from Sigma. All data were expressed as mean ± S.E. Numerical data were compared using Student's t test for paired observations between two groups and by analysis of variance followed by the Bonferroni t test when more than two groups were analyzed. A p value of <0.05 was considered significant. Our original preconditioning paradigm consisted of four 90-min periods of hypoxia alternating with 60-min normoxic incubations. The hypoxic period was based on our observation that myocytes incubated in glucose-supplemented medium tolerated up to 2 h of hypoxia without reduction of viability (24Rocha-Singh K.J. Honbo N.Y. Karliner J.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 88: 204-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The number of cycles was based on the study of preconditioning in canine myocardium in which four brief coronary artery occlusions protected cardiac tissue from prolonged ischemia (1Murry C.E. Jennings R.B. Reimer K.A. Circulation. 1986; 74: 1124-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (7040) Google Scholar). The protective effect of our protocol was determined using an assay that discriminated between living and dead myocytes upon completion of a prolonged hypoxic challenge. This method has been validated with a variety of adherent cell types (27Hauser J.M.L. Buehrer B.M. Bell R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6803-6809Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as well as with primary cultures of neonatal rat cardiac myocytes (28Kirshenbaum L.A. Schneider M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7791-7794Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The proportion of viable (green fluorescent) cardiac myocytes under normoxic conditions was consistently greater than 95% (Fig. 1 A). Following transfer, non-viable (red fluorescent) cardiac myocytes exceeded 50% after 7–9 h of exposure to the hypoxic environment (Fig.1 B). In two independent experiments, 20 random microscopic fields per condition (600 cells each) were scored just after the final preconditioning cycle. The proportion of viable cells in the preconditioned group was no different from that of normoxic control cells (96.5 ± 0.7 versus 97.2 ± 0.8%). Therefore, hypoxic preconditioning had no immediate effect on myocyte survival. In contrast, hypoxic preconditioning had a profound effect on expression of the inducible 72-kDa member of the heat shock protein 70-kDa family (Hsp70). In control myocytes Hsp70 was barely detectable by Western blot analysis, whereas preconditioning up-regulated the expression of Hsp70 by severalfold (Fig.2 A). Others (29Marber M.S. Mestril R. Chi S.-H. Sayen M.R. Yellon D.M. Dillmann W.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 1446-1456Crossref PubMed Scopus (767) Google Scholar) have reported that overexpression of rat Hsp70 improved contractile function and reduced the zone of infarction following 20 min of zero-flow ischemia in hearts harvested from transgene-positive mice compared with hearts from transgene-negative littermates. Also, specific induction of Hsp70 in cultured neonatal rat cardiac myocytes by the tyrosine kinase inhibitor herbimycin-A increased cell survival during subsequent lethal heat stress and simulated ischemia (30Morris S.D. Cumming D.V.E. Latchman D.S. Yellon D.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 706-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). We found that preconditioning increased the proportion of surviving myocytes by 52% compared with control (66.5 ± 1.4 versus 43.7 ± 3.3%) following 9 h of hypoxia (Fig. 2 B). Therefore, we have identified a cardiac myocyte culture model for hypoxic preconditioning. We first determined whether hypoxic preconditioning activated PKC using an immunofluorescence assay in which myocytes were stained with isozyme-specific anti-PKC antibodies. Activated PKC isozymes translocate to distinct, characteristic subcellular locations; εPKC translocates from the nucleus to perinuclear, cell-cell contact, and cross-striated structures. δPKC translocates from the nucleus to perinuclear structures. βIPKC translocates from the cytosol into the nucleus (8Disatnik M.-H. Buraggi G. Mochly-Rosen D. Exp. Cell Res. 1994; 210: 287-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). Individual myocytes can then be scored as basal or activated, and the proportions of each were compared with those of cell populations stimulated with known activators of PKC such as norepinephrine. This immunofluorescence technique is extremely sensitive in demonstrating translocation because it does not disrupt cell structure and because dissociation from the translocation site does not occur in cells fixed immediately after treatment. We found that hypoxic preconditioning produced a 2.1-fold increase in εPKC activation (49.9 ± 2.8 versus 23.6 ± 2.6% for control) and a 2.8-fold increase in δPKC activation (58.4 ± 2.9versus 20.7 ± 2.8% for control), an effect comparable to that induced by stimulation with 2 μm norepinephrine under normoxic conditions. No activation of βIPKC by hypoxic preconditioning was observed (Fig.3). Therefore, hypoxic preconditioning selectively activated δ- and εPKC isozymes in cultured cardiac myocytes. A recent study using a similar myocyte culture model reported redistribution of εPKC in response to hypoxia using Western blot analysis (31Goldberg M. Zhang H.L. Steinberg S.F. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 55-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), thereby providing independent corroboration of our observations. We also determined whether direct activation of PKC with phorbol ester could protect cardiac myocytes from hypoxic damage. We stimulated myocytes with 10 nm PMA for 10 min since this concentration and incubation period induced a robust, selective activation of δ- and εPKC by Western blot analysis (Fig.4). As we previously reported, there was no activation of αPKC and minimal activation of βPKC using <10 nm PMA (14Johnson J.A. Mochly-Rosen D. Circ. Res. 1995; 76: 654-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). In contrast, where activation of these isozymes has been observed, the concentration of PMA used was 100 nm to 1 μm (7Rybin V.O. Steinberg S.F. Circ. Res. 1994; 74: 299-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 32Puceat M. Hilal-Dandan R. Strulovici B. Brunton L.L. Brown J.H. J. Biol.

Physiol. 1995; 269: H1087-H1097PubMed Google Scholar). This pattern of PKC activation by 10 nm PMA was comparable to that observed with hypoxic preconditioning as determined by immunofluorescence staining (Fig. 3). Furthermore, PMA-mediated preconditioning protected cardiac myocytes, increasing the proportion of surviving myocytes by 34% compared with control (59.3 ± 1.9 versus44.1 ± 2.1%) following 9 h of hypoxia (Fig.5 A). PMA-mediated preconditioning was also protective during prolonged hypoxia by an independent assay of cell viability and retained LDH activity. Under normoxic conditions PMA had no effect on retained LDH activity (data not shown). However, PMA increased retained LDH activity by 42% compared with control (387 ± 18 units/liter versus274 ± 24 units/liter in four independent experiments,p < 0.05) following 9 h of hypoxia. Therefore, PMA treatment of myocytes in culture mimicked hypoxic preconditioning.Figure 5Activation of εPKC is required for PMA- and hypoxic preconditioning-induced protection of cardiac myocytes from subsequent prolonged hypoxia. A, myocytes were permeabilized to introduce a peptide inhibitor of εPKC (εV1-2), control peptide (εV1-3), or no peptide (–). Cells were then stimulated with 10 nm for 10 min (Phorbol Ester) or vehicle (Control), washed, and subjected to 9 h of hypoxia. 10 random fields per condition in each of four independent experiments were scored for cell viability. Preconditioning increased the proportion of surviving myocytes by 34% versus control. Protection was abolished by the εPKC-selective antagonist εV1-2.

B, myocytes were permeabilized to introduce εV1-2, control (βC2-4), or no peptide (–) and then exposed to 30 min of hypoxia in the absence of glucose (Preconditioned). After 30 min of recovery under normoxic conditions, preconditioned and control cells were subjected to 9 h of hypoxia. 20 random fields in each of two independent experiments were scored for cell viability. Preconditioning increased the proportion of surviving cells by 86%versus control. Protection was abolished by εV1-2. Thenumber in each bar represents the total number of cells scored per condition. ††, p < 0.05versus control cells. **, p < 0.05versus preconditioned cells permeabilized in the absence of peptide (–) or in the presence of control peptide (βC2-4).C, left, myocytes were either maintained in glucose-supplemented medium under normoxic conditions (Nx) or incubated in glucose-free medium under hypoxic conditions (Hypoxia) for the times indicated. Western blot analysis revealed translocation of εPKC from the soluble to the particulate fraction following 30–120 min of hypoxia. Result is representative of two independent experiments. Densitometry revealed a 70% reduction in signal intensity at 120 min compared with normoxia in the soluble fraction and a 42% increase in the particulate fraction. C, right, myocytes were permeabilized in the presence of εV1-2 (+) or in the absence of peptide (−) and then either incubated under normoxic conditions (Nx) or exposed to 1 h of hypoxia (Hx) in glucose-free medium. Hypoxia induced translocation of εPKC from the soluble to the particulate fraction that was inhibited by the εPKC-selective peptide antagonist. Result is representative of two independent experiments. By densitometry, hypoxia caused reductions of 40 and 45%, respectively, in signal intensity in the second and third lanes of the soluble fraction compared with normoxia. The corresponding increase in the particulate fraction in the second lane was 47%, which was reduced by εV1-2 to less than half (21% increase).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In many cell types, activation of PKC isozymes is associated with translocation from the cell soluble to the cell particulate fraction (34Kraft A.S. Anderson W.B. Nature. 1983; 301: 621-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (1002) Google Scholar). In addition to binding to lipids, activated PKC isozymes bind to specific anchoring proteins within the particulate fraction termed RACKs, for receptors for activated protein kinase C (35Mochly-Rosen D. Khaner H. Lopez J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3997-4000Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). If stimulation-induced translocation of a PKC isozyme to its appropriate intracellular target is required for its function, then peptides that compete for binding of activated PKC isozymes to their RACKs should act as isozyme-selective inhibitors of PKC translocation and function. For example, a 9-amino acid peptide derived from the second common region (C2) of βPKC, termed βC2-4 (SLNPEWNET, βPKC-(218–226)), selectively inhibited insulin-induced βPKC tran"
https://openalex.org/W1963943602,"The activity of BiP, the major chaperone of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) lumen, is known to be Ca2+-regulated; however, the participation of this protein in the ER storage of the cation has not yet been investigated. Here such a role is demonstrated in human epithelial (HeLa) cells transiently transfected with the hamster BiP cDNA and incubated in Ca2+-free medium, as revealed by two different techniques. In the first, co-transfected aequorin was employed as a probe for assaying either the cytosolic of the mitochondrial free Ca2+ concentration. By this approach higher Ca2+ release responses were revealed in BiP-transfected cells by experiments in which extensive store depletion was induced either by repetitive stimulation with inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate-generating agonists or by treatment with the Ca2+ ionophore, A23187. In the second technique the cells were loaded at the equilibrium with 45Ca, and the release of the tracer observed upon treatment with thapsigargin, a blocker of the ER Ca2+ ATPases, was larger in BiP-transfected than in control cells. The latter results were obtained also when BiP was overexpressed not via transfection but as a response to ER stress by tunicamycin. These results are sustained by increases of the ER Ca2+ storage capacity rather than by artifacts or indirect readjustments induced in the cells by the overexpression of the chaperone since (a) the exogenous and endogenous BiP were both confined to the ER, (b) the expression levels of other proteins active in the ER Ca2+ storage were not changed, and (c) effects similar to those of wild type BiP were obtained with a deletion mutant devoid of chaperone activity. The specificity of the results was confirmed by parallel 45Ca experiments carried out in HeLa cells transfected with two other Ca2+-binding proteins, calreticulin and CaBP2(ERp72), only the first of which induced increases of Ca2+ capacity. We conclude that BiP has a dual function, in addition to its chaperone role it is a bona fide ER lumenal Ca2+ storage protein contributing, under resting cell conditions, to around 25% of the store, with a stoichiometry of 1-2 moles of calcium/mole of BiP."
https://openalex.org/W2080515968,"The induction of vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) expression by tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α requires the activation of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) via a process involving the phosphorylation and degradation of its cytoplasmic inhibitor, IκBα. We have shown that nitric oxide (NO) decreases VCAM-1 expression via inhibition of NF-κB activation. To determine how NO inhibits NF-κB, we studied the fate of IκBα following TNF-α stimulation in the presence of NO donorsS-nitrosoglutathione and sodium nitroprusside. Activation of NF-κB by TNF-α occurred within 15 min and coincided with rapid degradation of IκBα. Co-treatment with NO donors did not prevent IκBα phosphorylation or degradation. However, after 2 h of TNF-α stimulation, NO donors inhibited NF-κB activation and augmented IκBα resynthesis and nuclear translocation by 2.5- and 3-fold, respectively. This correlated with a 75% reduction in TNF-α-induced VCAM-1 expression. In a time-dependent manner, NO donors alone caused the nuclear translocation of IκBα. To confirm that NO donors have similar effects as endogenously derived NO, murine macrophage-like cells, RAW264.7, were co-cultured with endothelial cells. Induction of RAW264.7-derived NO inhibited lipopolysaccharide-induced endothelial VCAM-1 expression, which was reversed by the NO synthase inhibitorN ω-monomethyl-l-arginine.

The adhesion of circulating leukocytes to the vessel wall is an initiating event in atherogenesis and vascular inflammation (1Cybulsky M.I.

Pathol. 1993; 171: 223-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar). Under certain conditions, the “activated” endothelium expresses cell surface adhesion molecules which mediate specific interactions between the endothelium and circulating leukocytes (3Mackay C.R. Imhof B.A. Immunol. Today. 1993; 3: 99-102Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (243) Google Scholar, 4Smith C.W. Semin. Hematol. 1993; 30: 45-53PubMed Google Scholar). Factors that affect the induction of endothelial cell adhesion molecules such as vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM-1) 1The abbreviations used are: VCAM-1, vascular cell adhesion molecule-1; TNF-α, tumor necrosis factor-α; IFN-γ, interferon-γ; mIFN-γ, murine interferon-γ; GSNO,S-nitrosoglutathione; IκBα, inhibitor κBα; LPS, bacterial lipopolysaccharide; LNMA,N ω-monomethyl-l-arginine; NF-κB, nuclear factor-κB; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; NO, nitric oxide. therefore may be important in regulating vascular inflammatory processes. Recent studies suggest that the activation of the pleotropic transcription factor nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) is required for the transcriptional induction of endothelial cell adhesion molecules (5Collins T. Read M.A. Neish A.S. Whitley M.Z. Thanos D. Maniatis T. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (1578) Google Scholar). The activation of NF-κB involves the degradation of its cytoplasmic inhibitor, IκB (6Baeuerle P.A. Baltimore D. Cell. 1996; 87: 13-20Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2935) Google Scholar, 7Zabel U. Baeuerle P.A. Cell. 1990; 61: 255-265Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Presently, five distinct IκB proteins have been shown to functionally retain NF-κB in the cytoplasm and render it inactive (6Baeuerle P.A. Baltimore D. Cell. 1996; 87: 13-20Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2935) Google Scholar). These IκB proteins contain ankyrin repeat motifs that mask the nuclear localization sequence of NF-κB subunits such as RelA (p65), c-Rel, and RelB (8Beg A.A. Ruben S.M. Scheinmann R.I. Haskill S. Rosen C.A. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 1899-1913Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar, 9Hatada E.N. Naumann M. Scheidereit C. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2781-2788Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Of the different IκB proteins, the best described is IκBα. Following cytokine stimulation, IκBα is phosphorylated by a novel ubiquitinated serine kinase (10Chen Z.J. Parent L. Maniatis T. Cell. 1996; 84: 853-862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (871) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of IκBα targets the IκBα for ubiquitination and rapid degradation by 26 S proteasomes (10Chen Z.J. Parent L. Maniatis T. Cell. 1996; 84: 853-862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (871) Google Scholar, 11Palombella V.J. Rando O.J. Goldberg A.L. Maniatis T. Cell. 1994; 78: 773-785Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1922) Google Scholar). The degradation of IκBα then allows the unbound NF-κB to translocate into the nucleus, where it can transactivate the enhancer elements of many proinflammatory genes (5Collins T. Read M.A. Neish A.S. Whitley M.Z. Thanos D. Maniatis T. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (1578) Google Scholar). Modulation of IκBα function and expression has been shown to regulate NF-κB activation. For example, the phosphorylation of IκBα is a key regulatory step in the activation of NF-κB (11Palombella V.J. Rando O.J. Goldberg A.L. Maniatis T. Cell. 1994; 78: 773-785Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1922) Google Scholar,12Brown K. Gerstenberger S. Carlson L. Franzoso G. Siebenlist U. Science. 1995; 267: 1485-1488Crossref PubMed Scopus (1317) Google Scholar). Indeed, recent studies indicate that salicylates and antioxidants inhibit NF-κB and endothelial cell activation by preventing IκBα phosphorylation and subsequent degradation (13Kopp E. Ghosh S. Science. 1994; 265: 956-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (1621) Google Scholar, 14Pierce J.W. Read M.A. Ding H. Luscinskas F. Collins T. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 3961-3969PubMed Google Scholar, 15Sun S.C.

EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5433-5441Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar). Alternatively, the nuclear accumulation of IκBα resulting from overexpression of IκBα or following stimulation with tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α has been shown to displace NF-κB from its cognate DNA and terminate NF-κB-mediated transcriptional activity (17Zabel U. Henkel T. dos Santos Silva M. Baeuerle P.A. EMBO J. 1993; 10: 4159-4167Google Scholar, 18Read M.A. Neish A.S. Gerritsen M.E. Collins T. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 3472-3479PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, some of the anti-inflammatory effects of glucocorticoids may be mediated through their inhibitory effects on NF-κB, since glucocorticoids are known to induce IκBα expression (19Scheinman R.I. Cogswell C.P. Lofquist A.K. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Science. 1995; 270: 283-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (1601) Google Scholar, 20Auphan N. DiDonato J. Rosette C. Helmberg A. Karin M. Science. 1995; 270: 286-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (2169) Google Scholar). We and others have shown that nitric oxide can inhibit NF-κB and endothelial cell activation through non-cGMP-dependent mechanisms (21De Caterina R. Libby P. Peng H.B. Thannickal V.J.

Medford R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9114-9119Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). Although NO donors appear to “stabilize” the NF-κB-IκBα heterotrimeric complex (23Peng H.-B. Libby P. Liao J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14214-14219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar), the possibility that newly synthesized IκBα could account for this stabilization has not been excluded. Furthermore, it is not known whether the induction of IκBα expression by NO donors could actually lead to an increase in cytoplasmic or nuclear IκBα protein levels. The purpose of this study, therefore, is to determine the mechanism(s) by which NO inhibits of NF-κB activation and VCAM-1 expression in terms of its effects on IκBα phosphorylation, expression, and nuclear accumulation.

Low molecular weight protein standards were purchased from Bio-Rad. Human saphenous vein endothelial cells of less than four passages were cultured in a growth medium containing M199, 5% fetal calf serum, 50 μg/ml endothelial cell growth factor (Pel-Freez Biological, Rogers, AK), and 100 μg/ml heparin sulfate. For cell surface immunoassays, endothelial cells were grown on gelatin-coated 96-well microplates (Greiner, Nürtingen, Germany). All cell cultures were incubated at 37 °C with 5% CO2atmosphere. Endothelial cells were identified by their typical morphological pattern (cobblestone morphology) and by immunostaining of representative plates for von Willebrandt factor antigen as described previously (25Peng H.-B. Rajavashisth T.B. Libby P. Liao J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17050-17055Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). For the separated co-culture system, endothelial cells were grown on coverslips coated with 0.1% gelatin in 6-well culture dishes (Falcon, Franklin Lakes, NY). Murine macrophage-like cells, RAW264.7, were grown on inserts with 0.4-μm pore size (Falcon). These inserts were placed above the underlying endothelial cells and shared the same culture medium of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal calf serum and 50 μg/ml endothelial cell growth factor. Endothelial cells were stimulated with TNF-α (1000 units/ml) in the presence and absence of the indicated concentrations of NO donors. The preincubation period was 30 min for GSNO, 10 min for SNP, and 60 min for N-acetylcysteine (30 mm) before TNF-α stimulation. Degradation of phosphorylated IκBα was inhibited in the presence of a 26 S proteasome inhibitor, MG132 (10 μm), which was added 30 min prior to TNF-α stimulation. Following incubation with the indicated agents, representative endothelial cell plates were tested for cellular viability by trypan blue exclusion. Only endothelial cell monolayers with more than 95% viable cells were used in experiments. For enzyme immunoassays, each experiment was performed in quadruplicate. The separated co-culture system was stimulated with LPS (10 ng/ml), mIFN-γ (400 units/ml), alone or in combination, in the presence or absence of 3 mm N ω-monomethyl-l-arginine (LNMA) for 24 h. Enzyme immunoassays were performed on confluent human endothelial cell monolayers using a monoclonal VCAM-1 antibody. Nonbinding control antibodies (OX 6, against MHC class II antigen) were used in each experiment. The monolayers were washed with PBS. Following 4 h of stimulation with TNF-α, endothelial cells were fixed on 96-well microtiter plates with 1% paraformaldehyde for 45 min and then incubated with the indicated monoclonal antibodies (1:100 dilution in PBS). Following 45 min of incubation with the primary antibody at 37 °C, the alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary anti-mouse antibody was applied. Finally, the phosphatase substrate,p-nitrophenyl phosphate disodium, was added in an alkaline buffer solution, pH 10.3. Alkaline phosphatase activity was measured after 30 min at an absorbance wavelength of 405 nm with a Milenia microtiter plate reader (DPC MKA 220, DPC, Los Angeles, CA). Endothelial cells grown on coverslips in the separated co-culture system were fixed with 4% formaldehyde at 4 °C for 10 min and then incubated with VCAM-1 antibody for 1 h. After three washing steps in PBS, a biotinylated anti-mouse antibody (Bio Genex, San Ramon, CA) was added for 20 min. Following further washing steps, the cells were incubated with a streptavidin alkaline phosphatase-conjugated antibody and stained with fast red substrate (Dako, Carpinteria, CA). Immunostaining was visualized using a Nikon Optiphot-2 microscope. Endothelial cells were grown on gelatin-coated coverslips in 6-well plates. Following incubation with TNF-α or NO donors for the indicated time intervals, cells were fixed and permeabilized with acetone at −20 °C for 2 min (RelA) or with 100% methanol at −20 °C for 7 min (IκBα). Blocking was performed with 3% normal goat serum for 20 min. Cells were incubated with a rabbit polyclonal antibody directed against the NF-κB subunit, RelA (p65), or with anti IκBα for 1 h at room temperature. A biotinylated goat anti-rabbit antibody was used as secondary antibody. After 45 min of incubation with the secondary antibody, streptavidin-fluorescein isothiocyanate was added for 45 min. Immunofluorescence was visualized using an Olympus BX 60F microscope. Photographic images were taken from four random fields. The NO production was determined by assaying for nitrite accumulation. Briefly, following stimulation of the separated co-culture system with the indicated agents, a small aliquot of medium (50 μl) was added to equal volumes (100 μl) of 0.5% naphthylethylenediamine dihydrochloride and 1% sulfanilamide in 2.5% phosphoric acid (Griess reagents). Absorbance was measured at 543 nm, and nitrite concentration was determined using a standard curve of sodium nitrite concentrations from 1.6 to 200 nmol/ml. In some experiments, the medium was first treated with nitrate reductase (Sigma) to convert all of the nitrate to nitrite before applying the Griess reagents. Preliminary studies indicate that the nitrite to nitrate ratio in all treatment conditions was always greater than 5:1. Endothelial cells were harvested by scraping in ice-cold PBS. Nuclear extracts were prepared as described (23Peng H.-B. Libby P. Liao J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14214-14219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar), and protein concentrations were determined by BCA assay. Agarose-conjugated rabbit polyclonal RelA (p65) antibody (20 μl) was incubated with nuclear extracts (100 μg) in immunoprecipitation buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate in PBS) for 12 h at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitates were centrifuged at 2500 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C, the supernatant was discarded, and the pellet was washed four times with 1 ml of immunoprecipitation buffer. The immunoprecipitates were then resuspended in 40 μl of electrophoresis sample buffer (125 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 20% glycerol, 10% 2-mercaptoethanol), boiled for 5 min, and the supernatant was separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (12% running, 4% stacking). After specific incubation periods with TNF-α and NO donors, endothelial cells were rinsed once with ice-cold PBS before addition of the lysis buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 4% SDS, 20% glycerol, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm NaF, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) to the dishes on an ice tray. The cell lysates were scraped, boiled, and centrifuged for 2 min at 14,000 × g. Total cell lysates (100 μg of protein) and low molecular weight markers were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (12% running, 4% stacking) and electrophoretically transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride membranes (Immobilon P, 0.45 μm pore size). Immunodetection was accomplished using the enhanced chemoluminescence kit (ECL Kit, Amersham Corp.). Densitometry was performed using the NIH Image 1.49 program (26Rasband W. NIH Image, Version 1.49. National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD1993Google Scholar). Readings from enzyme immunoassays are expressed as mean ± S.D. Means were compared by Student's pairedt-test. A confidence level of p < 0.05 was taken to represent a significant difference between two means. Multiple comparisons were done by analysis of variance. The NO donor, GSNO, inhibited TNF-α-induced VCAM-1 expression in a concentration-dependent manner (IC50 = ∼30 μm) (Fig. 1). Maximal 75% inhibition was achieved at a GSNO concentration of 200 μm. The highest concentration of GSNO used in our experiments (1 mm) did not alter cell viability as assessed by cell number, cellular morphology, DNA content, and trypan blue exclusion. To confirm that the effects of the NO donors are comparable to the effects of endogenously derived NO, we developed a separated co-culture system where murine macrophage-like cells, RAW264.7, were grown on culture inserts above endothelial cell monolayers, but sharing the same culture medium (Fig. 2). In this separated co-culture system, no basal endothelial VCAM-1 expression or RAW264.7-derived NO production was observed (Fig. 2 B and Table I). Treatment with LPS (10 ng/ml) induced VCAM-1 expression in endothelial cells but not in RAW264.7 (Fig. 2 D). Murine IFN-γ was inactive in human endothelial cells (i.e. no MHC class II expression) and, by itself, could not induce Type II NO synthase (iNOS) expression in RAW264.7 cells (data not shown). The combination of LPS and mIFN-γ induced iNOS expression and NO production in RAW264.7 but not in human endothelial cells.Table IEffect of macrophage NO on endothelial VCAM-1 expressionCondition for co-cultureNitrite accumulation (μm/24 h)VCAM-1 expression (% of LPS)Control0.6 ± 0.31 ± 2%LNMA (3 mm)0.5 ± 0.212 ± 4%*LPS (10 ng/ml)0.9 ± 0.3100 ± 6%*mIFN-γ (400 units/ml)0.5 ± 0.32 ± 3%LPS + mIFN-γ27.3 ± 4.5*24 ± 5%*LPS + mIFN-γ + LNMA2.4 ± 0.4*/**119 ± 9%*/**The separated co-culture system consisting of RAW264.7 and endothelial cells was stimulated with the indicated conditions for 24 h as described.

Experiments were performed three times in quadruplicate. *p < 0.05 compared with control (no stimulation). **p < 0.01 compared with LPS and mIFN-γ. When the separated co-culture system was stimulated with the combination of LPS and mIFN-γ, NO production was increased significantly (0.6 ± 0.1 μm to 27.3 ± 4.5 μm, p < 0.01), while endothelial VCAM-1 expression was decreased by 76% compared with stimulation with LPS alone (Fig. 2 E and Table I). However, addition of the iNOS inhibitor, LNMA (3 mm), to the separated co-culture system that had been stimulated with LPS and IFN-γ inhibited NO production by 91% and augmented endothelial VCAM-1 expression by 5-fold compared with the level of VCAM-1 expression stimulated with LPS and IFN-γ (Fig. 2 F). Interestingly, treatment with LNMA alone resulted in mild endothelial VCAM-1 expression (12% of LPS-induced expression), suggesting that basal endothelial NO production can functionally and tonically inhibit VCAM-1 expression (Fig. 2 C). Stimulation of endothelial adhesion molecule expression requires the activation of NF-κB (5Collins T. Read M.A. Neish A.S. Whitley M.Z. Thanos D. Maniatis T. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (1578) Google Scholar). Since the activation of NF-κB involves the nuclear translocation of NF-κB subunits, we followed the intracellular localization of NF-κB subunit, RelA, by immunofluorescence following TNF-α stimulation in the presence or absence of GSNO. In unstimulated endothelial cells, RelA is predominantly localized to the cytoplasm with little, if any, present in the nucleus (Fig.3 A). Within 15 min following TNF-α stimulation, there is observable nuclear accumulation of RelA, which was sustained at 2 h (Fig. 3, B andD). Treatment with GSNO (200 μm) did not prevent the nuclear translocation of RelA after 15 min of TNF-α stimulation (Fig.3 C). After 2 h of TNF-α and GSNO, however, RelA was localized to both the cytoplasm and nucleus, suggesting partial inhibition of NF-κB activation and possible reverse nuclear to cytoplasmic translocation of NF-κB by GSNO (Fig. 3 E). Treatment with GSNO alone did not activate NF-κB at the 2 h time point (Fig. 3 F). Specificity was determined by the absence of RelA immunofluorescence when nonimmune serum was used instead of RelA antibody. These results indicate that the inhibitory effects of NO donors on NF-κB activation had a delayed onset (i.e. > 15 min) and suggest that NO does not prevent the initial degradation of IκBα following TNF-α stimulation. Since the activation of NF-κB involves the phosphorylation and subsequent degradation of its cytoplasmic inhibitor, IκBα, we followed the fate of IκBα after stimulation with TNF-α (1000 units/ml) in the presence and absence of GSNO (200 μm). Stimulation with TNF-α for 15 min caused an almost complete disappearance of IκBα, which was not prevented by co-treatment with GSNO (Fig.4). Since phosphorylated IκBα has a very short half-life and is difficult to visualize by immunoblotting, we treated endothelial cells with a relatively specific IκBα 26S proteasome inhibitor, MG132 (10 μm), to “protect” phosphorylated IκBα. In the presence of MG132, stimulation with TNF-α for 15 min produced two bands corresponding to phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated IκBα. Treatment with GSNO (200 μm) did not prevent TNF-α-stimulated IκBα phosphorylation when compared with that of TNF-α alone (Fig. 4). Incubation with a higher concentration of GSNO (500 μm) or with a second NO donor, SNP (500 μm), also had no effect on TNF-α-stimulated IκBα phosphorylation (data not shown). Treatment withN-acetylcysteine (30 mm) stabilized IκBα and prevented its degradation following TNF-α stimulation. In contrast to MG132, a nonspecific proteasome inhibitor, ALL (10 μm), did not prevent IκBα degradation following IκBα phosphorylation. To investigate the effects of NO on IκBα expression, endothelial cells were incubated for longer time periods with GSNO. Stimulation with TNF-α (1000 units/ml) resulted in almost complete IκBα degradation by 15 min, followed by the reappearance or resynthesis of IκBα at 2 h (Fig. 5 A). Co-treatment with GSNO (200 μm) did not prevent TNF-α-induced IκBα degradation at 15 min but did augment TNF-α-induced IκBα expression by 2.5-fold after 2 h compared to that of TNF-α alone. Treatment with GSNO alone produced a time-dependent 1.5- and 2.5-fold increase in IκBα levels above basal levels after 1 and 2 h, respectively (Fig. 5 B). To determine whether NO can affect the cellular localization of IκBα, we performed immunofluorescence studies of IκBα following GSNO treatment. In unstimulated endothelial cells, IκBα is predominantly localized to the cytoplasm with little, if any, localized to the nucleus (Fig. 6 A). In a time-dependent manner, treatment with GSNO (200 μm) caused a progressive nuclear accumulation of IκBα (Fig. 6, B–D). Incubation with nonimmune serum yielded no appreciable immunofluorescence (data not shown). The nuclear translocation of IκBα by NO, therefore, occurred in the absence of NF-κB activation, since GSNO alone does not activate NF-κB (Fig.3 F). To determine whether the nuclear accumulation of IκBα induced by NO can terminate NF-κB signaling in the nucleus by binding to RelA, we studied the appearance of RelA-associated IκBα in the nucleus. Immunoblotting of nuclear extracts that have been immunoprecipitated with agarose-conjugated anti-RelA antibody demonstrated that RelA-associated IκBα begins to accumulate in the nuclear extracts of endothelial cells following 2 h of TNF-α (1000 units/ml) stimulation (Fig. 7). This time frame is consistent with the appearance of IκBα in the nucleus following GSNO treatment (Fig. 6, C and D). Compared withTNF-α alone, co-treatment with GSNO (200 μm) caused a further increase in nuclear RelA-associated IκBα levels resulting in a 3-fold increase after 6 h (Fig. 7). Possible cytoplasmic contamination of the nuclear extracts was excluded by the absence of G-protein αi2 subunit in the nuclear extracts. In addition, IκBα, which is present in the cytoplasm of unstimulated endothelial cells, was not observed in the corresponding nuclear extracts. The mechanism by which NO inhibits endothelial VCAM-1 expression occurs, in part, via the inhibition of NF-κB (21De Caterina R. Libby P. Peng H.B. Thannickal V.J. Rajavashisth T.B. Gimbrone Jr., M.A. Shin W.S. Liao J.K. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 60-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (1586) Google Scholar, 22Khan B.V. Harrison D.G. Olbrych M.T. Alexander R.W. Medford R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9114-9119Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). Since the activation of NF-κB is dependent upon its association with its inhibitor, IκBα, which not only binds and prevents the nuclear translocation of NF-κB (6Baeuerle P.A. Baltimore D. Cell. 1996; 87: 13-20Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2935) Google Scholar, 7Zabel U. Baeuerle P.A. Cell. 1990; 61: 255-265Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar) but also may displace nuclear NF-κB from its cognate DNA (16Traenckner E.B. Wilk S. Baeuerle P.A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5433-5441Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar), the level of IκBα in both the cytoplasm and nucleus may be important in determining the time of onset, duration, and magnitude of NF-κB activation. Regulation of NF-κB activation by IκBα therefore may ultimately determine the level of VCAM-1 expression in response to cytokines. We find that NO inhibits NF-κB activation and VCAM-1 expression by increasing cytoplasmic and nuclear levels of IκBα. The NO donor, GSNO, has been shown to slowly release NO under physiological pH conditions (27Singh R.J. Hogg N. Joseph J. Kalyanaraman B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18596-18603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the findings of the separated co-culture system suggest that the effects of the NO donors is most likely due to biologically active NO and not some other metabolite. However, we cannot exclude possible interactions of NO with other reactive oxygen intermediates such as superoxide anion to form another NO derivative such as peroxynitrite (28Beckman J.S. Beckman T.W. Chen J. Marshall P.A. Freeman B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1620-1624Crossref PubMed Scopus (6731) Google Scholar). Neither the NO donors used in our experiments nor endogenously derived NO from RAW264.7 cells cause any cellular toxicity as determined by cell count, DNA content, cellular morphology, and trypan blue exclusion. Thus it is unlikely that changes in NF-κB activation or VCAM-1 expression were due to direct or indirect toxic effects of NO. Furthermore, we have previously shown that two constitutively expressed endothelial cell surface proteins, E1/1 and MHC class I, were not affected by similar treatment with these NO donors (21De Caterina R. Libby P. Peng H.B. Thannickal V.J. Rajavashisth T.B. Gimbrone Jr., M.A. Shin W.S. Liao J.K. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 60-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (1586) Google Scholar). We find that the induction of IκBα by NO or TNF-α resulted in a delayed increase in IκBα protein levels (i.e. ≥2 h). Higher levels of IκBα protein in the cytoplasm could replace the initially degraded IκBα and help retain and “stabilize” the NF-κB/IκBα complex in the cytoplasm. The binding of newly synthesized IκBα to cytoplasmic NF-κB therefore may prevent further nuclear translocation of NF-κB subunits and limit VCAM-1 gene transcription. Treatment with NO donors, however, did not inhibit IκBα phosphorylation or degradation by 26 S proteasomes following TNF-α stimulation. This is in contrast to our previous study, which suggested that NO may stabilize IκBα (23Peng H.-B. Libby P. Liao J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14214-14219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar). In the present study, a more detailed analysis using shorter stimulation periods indicates that stabilization of latent IκBα is not responsible for inhibition of NF-κB. Retention of NF-κB in the cytoplasm occurs later only after IκBα resynthesis. An increase in IκBα protein level in the nucleus may also serve to terminate NF-κB-mediated VCAM-1 gene transcription by displacing NF-κB from its putative cis-acting element(s) (16Traenckner E.B. Wilk S. Baeuerle P.A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5433-5441Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar). This is consistent with our finding that following treatment with NO, and to a lesser extent TNF-α, IκBα not only accumulates in the nucleus but also is bound to nuclear translocated RelA. Binding of RelA to IκBα may also serve to expel RelA from the nucleus into the cytoplasm. Thus, the observed increase in nuclear IκBα levels and possible reverse translocation of NF-κB may be additional mechanisms by which NO can rapidly terminate NF-κB-mediated gene transcription. It is not known, however, whether this increase in nuclear IκBα levels is due to enhanced nuclear translocation of IκBα or occurs indirectly as a result of stoichiometric increases in cytoplasmic IκBα levels. The activation of NF-κB following TNF-α stimulation leads to the transcriptional induction of IκBα via κB cis-acting elements in the IκBα promoter (29de Martin R. Vanhove B. Cheng Q. Hofer E. Csizmadia V. Winkler H. Bach F. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2773-2779Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar, 30Le Bail O Schmidt-Ullrich R. Israel A.

The induction of IκBα by NF-κB, therefore, serves as an autoregulatory mechanism for terminating NF-κB-mediated gene transcription (15Sun S.C. Ganchi P.A. Ballard D.W. Greene W.C. Science. 1993; 259: 1912-1915Crossref PubMed Scopus (958) Google Scholar, 31Chiao P.J. Miyamoto S. Verma I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 28-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). In our studies, the induction of IκBα by NO donors occurred independent of NF-κB activation in unstimulated human endothelial cells. The induction of IκBα by NO, however, is somewhat similar to the effect of glucocorticoids, which have also been shown to induce IκBα gene transcription (19Scheinman R.I. Cogswell C.P. Lofquist A.K. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Science. 1995; 270: 283-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (1601) Google Scholar, 20Auphan N. DiDonato J. Rosette C. Helmberg A. Karin M. Science. 1995; 270: 286-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (2169) Google Scholar). Although the NO-responsivecis-acting element(s) has yet to be identified, analysis of the −2.1-kilobase porcine, −1.6-kilobase murine, and −385-base pair human IκBα promoter does not reveal site corresponding to putative glucocorticoid response elements (GRE) (29de Martin R. Vanhove B. Cheng Q. Hofer E. Csizmadia V. Winkler H. Bach F. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2773-2779Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar, 30Le Bail O Schmidt-Ullrich R. Israel A.

Thus, it is interesting to speculate whether NO and glucocorticoids share a similar transcriptional signaling pathway leading to the transactivation of the IκBα gene. In summary, NO inhibits VCAM-1 expression in cultured human vascular endothelial cells via a novel mechanism involving the induction and nuclear translocation of IκBα. These effects of NO appear to be distinct from that of antioxidants and salicylates, which prevent IκBα phosphorylation and degradation (13Kopp E. Ghosh S. Science. 1994; 265: 956-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (1621) Google Scholar, 14Pierce J.W. Read M.A. Ding H. Luscinskas F. Collins T. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 3961-3969PubMed Google Scholar, 15Sun S.C.

EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5433-5441Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar). Further investigation into how NO donors induce IκBα gene transcription and modulate NF-κB activity may provide greater insights into the role of NO in the vascular wall."
https://openalex.org/W2061054148,"Ewing's family of tumors is characterized by a well described reciprocal translocation, t(11;22)(q24;q12), which produces a fusion protein (EWS/FLI-1) that transforms mouse fibroblasts.

The EWS domain is a potent transcriptional activator, whereas the FLI-1 or ERG domain contains a highly conserved DNA binding domain (5May W.A. Lessnick S.L. Braun B.S. Klemsz M. Lewis B.C.

The EWS/ets translocation and the resulting fusion protein are thought to play a role in both the etiology and growth promotion of ESFT. The EWS/FLI-1 fusion protein appears to play a role in maintaining cell growth. Growth inhibition has been demonstrated by three methods of inhibiting the EWS/FLI-1 fusion protein: 1) RNA antisense (9Ouchida M. Ohno T. Fujimura Y. Rao V.N. Reddy E.S. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 1049-1054PubMed Google Scholar), 2) a dominant negative truncated protein with an intact DNA binding domain (10Kovar H. Aryee D.N. Jug G. Henockl C. Schemper M. Delattre O. Thomas G. Gadner H. Cell Growth Differ. 1996; 7: 429-437PubMed Google Scholar), and 3) antisense oligodeoxynucleotides (11Tanaka K. Iwakuma T. Harimaya K. Sato H. Iwamoto Y. J. Clin.

Each of these models demonstrates that when the fusion protein or its transcript is decreased, tumor cell growth is reduced. The chimeric EWS/FLI-1 fusion protein generated as a result of the translocation transforms mouse fibroblasts, and this transformation requires both the EWS and FLI-1 functional domains to be intact (13May W.A. Gishizky M.L. Lessnick S.L. Lunsford L.B. Lewis B.C. Delattre O. Zucman J. Thomas G. Denny C.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5752-5756Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar). The mechanism whereby the EWS/FLI-1 fusion protein transforms cells remains unknown. The insulin-like growth factor-I receptor (IGF-IR) is an α2-β2 heterodimeric receptor where the α-subunit contains the extracellular ligand binding domain and the β-subunit contains the transmembrane and intracellular tyrosine kinase domains. The IGF-IR binds IGF-I and IGF-II and to a lesser extent insulin. The receptor transduces its signal via autophosphorylation of tyrosine residues with subsequent tyrosine phosphorylation of downstream targets, including insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1), IRS-2, Shc, and Crk (14Rubin R. Baserga R. Lab. Invest. 1995; 73: 311-331PubMed Google Scholar). The receptor is critical for many physiologic functions including development, cell growth, transformation, and prevention of apoptosis (15Resnicoff M. Burgaud J.L. Rotman H.L. Abraham D. Baserga R. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 3739-3741PubMed Google Scholar, 16Resnicoff M. Abraham D. Yutanawiboonchai W. Rotman H.L. Kajstura J. Rubin R. Zoltick P. Baserga R. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 2463-2469PubMed Google Scholar). Embryos from mice with a targeted disruption of the IGF-IR were 45% of normal size and nonviable at birth (17Liu J.P. Baker J. Perkins A.S. Robertson E.J. Efstratiadis A. Cell. 1993; 75: 59-72Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2597) Google Scholar). Blockade of ligand-mediated signal transduction through the IGF-IR using a monoclonal antibody inhibits tumor growth in many model systems (18Furlanetto R.W. Harwell S.E. Baggs R.B.

Transformation occurs when the IGF-IR is overexpressed in mouse fibroblasts but only in the presence of ligand (20Kaleko M. Rutter W.J. Miller A.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 464-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). Until recently, all oncogenes investigated were found to require the presence of the IGF-IR. However, a constitutively active G-protein mutant Gα13 transforms R− cells, which do not express IGF-IR. 2J.-L. Liu and D. LeRoith, personal communication. The oncogenes that require the IGF-IR to transform cells and their IGF-IR-dependent pathways are currently being elucidated. EWS/FLI-1 fusion protein functions as an aberrant transcription factor, but as yet there is no mechanism for how this protein transforms cells. The IGF-IR is expressed in ESFT cell lines; inhibition of IGF-IR signaling, by blocking ligand stimulation, has reduced the growth of these cells (21Scotlandi K. Benini S. Sarti M. Serra M. Lollini P.L. Maurici D. Picci P. Manara M.C. Baldini N. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 4570-4574PubMed Google Scholar, 22Yee D. Favoni R.E. Lebovic G.S. Lombana F. Powell D.R. Reynolds C.P. Rosen N. J. Clin. Invest. 1990; 86: 1806-1814Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Because investigators have shown that other transforming proteins, including SV-40 large T antigen (23Sell C. Rubini M. Rubin R. Liu J.P. Efstratiadis A. Baserga R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11217-11221Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar), requires the presence of IGF-IR to transform cells, we sought to determine whether the presence of these receptors was required for the transforming activity of the EWS/FLI-1 fusion protein. To perform this study, we used two previously described cell lines, R− and W, derived from an IGF-IR knockout mouse and a wild-type littermate, respectively (24Sell C. Dumenil G. Deveaud C. Miura M. Coppola D. DeAngelis T. Rubin R. Efstratiadis A. Baserga R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3604-3612Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). Both cell lines were transfected, individual clones were selected, and clones were evaluated for anchorage-independent growth. We show here that the IGF-IR is required for the EWS/FLI-1 fusion protein to transform mouse fibroblasts. We also demonstrate that the presence of the EWS/FLI-1 fusion protein leads to altered signal transduction through the IGF-IR. W and R− cell lines were a generous gift of R. Baserga (Philadelphia, PA), whereas R+ cells are transfected R− cells that overexpress wild-type IGF-IR. All cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagles medium + 10% fetal bovine serum. ESFT cell lines TC-32, CHP-100, and RD-ES have previously been shown to contain the t(11;22) translocation (25Whang P.J. Triche T.J. Knutsen T. Miser J. Kao S.S. Tsai S. Israel M.A. Cancer Genet.

All cells were maintained in humidified, 6% CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C. EWS/FLI-1 type I cDNA was a gift of C. Denny (Los Angeles, CA). Lyophilized αIR−3 (IGF-IR antibody) was purchased from Oncogene Science Inc. (Cambridge, MA), and the IgG1 isotype-matched antibody MOPC 21 was purchased from Sigma. IGF-IR β-subunit antibody was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Phosphotyrosine antibodies 4G10 and PY-20 were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. (Lake Placid, NY) and Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY), respectively. IRS-1 antibodies, both pleckstrin and carboxyl domains, were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. Grb2 antibody was purchased from Transduction Laboratories. IGF-I was obtained from Ci77ba-Geigy. Immunoblot analysis for the β-subunit of the IGF-IR was performed on W, R−, and R+ cells stimulated with 20 nm IGF-I. Lysates were prepared in Tris/sodium chloride buffer with Nonidet P-40, vanadate, and protease inhibitors (12Toretsky J. Connell Y. Neckers L. Bhat N. J. Neuro-Oncol. 1997; 31: 9-16Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and 500 μg were immunoprecipitated with αIR−3. Separation on a polyacrylamide gel was followed by transfer to nitrocellulose and blotting with anti-phosphotyrosine (4G10), followed by chemiluminescent detection, described below. Solution hybridization assays were performed as previously reported (27Lowe W. Roberts C. Lasky S. LeRoith D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Soft agar assays were performed with 5000 cells/well in 0.3% agarose on top of a 0.6% feeder layer. Colonies greater than 0.12 mm were scored and counted as previously reported (29D'Ambrosio C. Hongo A. Li S. Baserga R. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 371-378PubMed Google Scholar, 30Fei Z.L. D'Ambrosio C. Li S. Surmacz E. Baserga R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4232-4239Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A 1400-bp HindIII/XbaI fragment containing the EWS/FLI-1 fusion cDNA was transferred to a shuttle vector, pSP72 (Promega, Madison, WI), that was modified to contain NotI restriction sites at each end of the multiple cloning region. TheNotI fragment was bidirectionally cloned into the pCI.Neo vector (Promega), and orientation was determined with restriction mapping. In vitro translation of the EWS/FLI-1 fusion cDNA yielded a full-length protein as described previously (11Tanaka K. Iwakuma T. Harimaya K. Sato H. Iwamoto Y. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 239-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Plasmids were purified using ion exchange chromatography (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA) according to instructions from the manufacturer. Plasmids were introduced into W and R− cells by electroporation in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagles medium in a 0.4-cm gap chamber with 350 V at 1600 microfarad. Cells were then transferred to prewarmed medium. 24 h after electroporation, 400 μg/ml G418 was added. Clones were isolated with cloning rings when macroscopic and grown in the continued presence of G418. Clones were frozen at regular intervals, and experiments were performed on similar passage clones. Clones were initially screened using DNA prepared from 105 cells in K Buffer consisting of 50 mm KCl, 10 mmTris, pH 8, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5% Tween 20, and 100 μg/ml proteinase K. DNA was amplified using a sense primer from within the distal cytomegalovirus promoter, CI.758 (5′-GCTTTATTGCGGTAGTTTATCACAG-3′) and an antisense primer complimentary to the 3′ end of the cDNA, FLI-C (5′-CCACGCGGATCCAGCTTCTAGTAGTAGCTGCCTAAGTG-3′). PCR was performed using a kit according to instructions from the manufacturer (Perkin-Elmer, Branchberg, NJ) for 40 cycles. Cycle parameters were: annealing at 65 °C for 2 min, extension at 72 °C for 3 min, and denaturing at 95 °C for 1 min. PCR products were separated on 2% agarose gels. Those clones containing the 2000-bp sequence including the distal one-third of the cytomegalovirus promoter and the entire cDNA were further evaluated for fusion message expression using reverse transcriptase PCR. RNA was extracted using RNAzol (Tel-Test Inc., Friendswood, TX) according to instructions from the manufacturer. 2 μg of RNA was then digested with DNase I (Boehringer Mannheim) at 37 °C for 1 h and then separated into two parts. Reverse transcriptase was added to one part and water to the other. cDNA synthesis was then performed according to instructions from the manufacturer using random hexamer priming (Perkin-Elmer). Expression of EWS/FLI-1 fusion message was shown using primers EWS-1 (5′-ATGGCGTCCACGGATTACAGTACC-3′) and FLI-A (5′-GACTGCTGGTCGGGCCCAGG-3′). RNA integrity was confirmed using mouse β-actin primers A (5′-GCTGCGCTGGTCGTCG-3′) and B (5′-ATCCTGTCAGCAATGCCTGG-3′). PCR cycle parameters were as above, and PCR products were separated on 2% agarose gels. Nomenclature for the clones is: W cells or R− cells that express the fusion message are designated WF, or R−F respectively, followed by a clone number (i.e. WF3, R−F17), whereas clones that contain the control vector but lack the fusion protein insert are designated by W or R− followed by clone number (i.e. W5, R−6). Doubling times of wild-type and clonal cell lines were determined by plating equal numbers of cells in duplicate 96-well plates and evaluating cell growth daily for 7 days. Cultures were analyzed for viable cells using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (Sigma). Absorbance was analyzed at 540 nm, and cell number was determined using a standardized curve created with the software Kaleidagraph (Synergy Software, Reading, PA). The doubling time was calculated from the maximal slope of the cell growth curve. Clonally derived cell lines were evaluated in soft agar as described above. Near-confluent monolayers of cells were washed and placed in serum-free medium for 12 h prior to stimulation with IGF-I. IGF-I (20 nm) was added for 3 min at 37 °C. Lysates were prepared as previously reported (31Beitner-Johnson D. LeRoith D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5187-5190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), and protein concentration was determined for each lysate according to manufacturers instruction (BCA, Pierce) and either resolved directly on an 8% polyacrylamide gel or immunoprecipitated from fresh lysates. Immunoprecipitated proteins were removed from protein A-Sepharose beads and resolved in a polyacrylamide gel. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose using a semi-dry transfer apparatus. Membranes were blocked in 5% nonfat milk (Carnation, Glendale, CA) and blotted with antibodies described above. Antibodies were prepared in Tris-sodium-EDTA-Tween 20 buffer with either 1% bovine serum albumin (Miles Inc., Kankakee, IL) or 2.5% nonfat dry milk. Chemiluminescent detection was performed following incubation with secondary anti-mouse or anti-rabbit antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Corp.) with Renaissance (Dupont) according to instructions from the manufacturer and exposure to X-Omat film (Eastman Kodak Co.). Blots were stripped with β-mercaptoethanol buffer (2% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 100 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 63 mmTris, pH 6.8) at 70 C, reblocked, and then probed with various antibodies as described above. Films were evaluated for band density by digitizing films using a CCD camera into a Macintosh computer, checking the threshold on all bands, and analyzing with NIH Image version 1.61 software. Phosphorylation levels were corrected based upon IGF-IR or IRS-1 protein levels on each immunoblot. The density of the phosphotyrosine band was divided by the density of the protein band, either IGF-IR or IRS-1. Fold stimulation was calculated by dividing the corrected stimulated phosphotyrosine band by the unstimulated phosphotyrosine band. The equation appears in Table II. Statistics were performed using Microsoft Excell version 5.0 software.Table IISummary of densitometric evaluation of immunoblotsIGF-I-induced phosphorylation (fold stimulation)Fig. 4Fig. 6IGF-IRSDt testIRS-1SDttestWF clones9.68.7p < 0.256.04.1p < 0.05W clones6.25.41.50.14Films shown in Figs. 4 and 6 were digitized with a CCD camera, and band densities were obtained with NIH Image software.

Fold stimulation=(stimulated PY/stimulated IGF­IR or IRS­1)(unstimulated PY/unstimulated IGF­IR or IRS­1where PY indicates phosphotyrosine. The R− and W cell lines were obtained from a mouse with a targeted disruption of IGF-IR and a wild-type littermate, respectively, whereas R+ cells overexpress the IGF-IR. IGF-IR could not be detected on the surface of W nor R− cells by fluorescent automated cell sorting analysis, whereas the R+ cells demonstrated the presence of receptor (data not shown). To demonstrate that the R− cells did lack the IGF-IR and confirm expression in the W cells, we used a solution hybridization assay. Only the RNA from W cells hybridizes to and protects a 300-bp fragment of the probe (Fig.1, lane 3), whereas R− cell RNA does not contain IGF-IR message (Fig. 1, lane 4). An internal 18S ribosomal probe indicates the presence of RNA in both hybridizations. The pCI.Neo.EWS/FLI-1 vector was electroporated into W and R− cells. DNA from G418 selected clones was screened using PCR with the 5′ primer located in the cytomegalovirus promoter, CI.758, and the distal primer at the 3′ end of the cDNA, FLI-C. Fig.2 demonstrates the isolation of six typical W clones, five of which were stably transfected with the EWS/FLI-1 fusion cDNA based on a 2000-bp PCR product (lanes B–F). This screening did not identify clones based upon expression of the fusion message, so following initial screening, clones were expanded for extraction of RNA. Fig. 3 shows an example of six clones evaluated for expression of the fusion message using reverse transcriptase PCR. RNA was extracted from the clones, and following this, residual DNA was eliminated by DNase digestion. Reverse transcription took place in parallel tubes, one of which contained no reverse transcriptase and acted as a control to avoid amplification of genomic (incorporated plasmid) DNA sequences. The top panelof Fig. 3 demonstrates fusion message expression in clones WF3, WF6, R−F2, R−F17, and WF12. W5 indicates an empty vector clone that does not transcribe the fusion message. The lack of bands in themiddle panel indicates that DNase digestion successfully eliminated residual DNA. Therefore any amplification seen in the reverse transcriptase treated RNA indicates true cDNA amplification. The bottom panel indicates the presence of β-actin and demonstrates intact mRNA in all samples. Liquid culture growth based on doubling time did not distinguish W or R− clones that expressed the EWS/FLI-1 fusion protein (data not shown). Soft agar cloning was used to assay for anchorage-independent growth, a marker of transformation. Clones were tested in soft agar assays utilizing 5000 cells/35-mm2 dish. A colony was defined as a cluster of cells larger than 0.12 μm in diameter after 14 days in culture. A summary of the soft agar experiments is shown in TableI. We found that all five of our clones that express both the IGF-IR and the EWS/FLI-1 fusion protein produce colonies. Neither W (expressing IGF-IRs but lacking EWS/FLI-1), R−F (lacking IGF-IR, but expressing EWS/FLI-1), nor R− (lacking both IGF-IR and EWS/FLI-1) produced colonies.Table ISoft agar clo-genic assayCloneFusion proteinIGF-IRNumber of experimentsAverageWF6++763WF22++48WF3++6138WF7++532WF36++225R − F2+−20R − F17+−20R − 10−−20R − 4−−20R − 8−−20W5−+60W6−+20W8−+21W13−+205000 cells were plated in 0.3% agarose in 35-mm2 dishes and incubated at 37 °C with 5% CO2 for 14 days.

Open table in a new tab 5000 cells were plated in 0.3% agarose in 35-mm2 dishes and incubated at 37 °C with 5% CO2 for 14 days. Colonies >0.12 μm were counted with an inverted microscope. Results here are reported as colonies/well. We first determined whether the EWS/FLI-1 fusion protein induced the synthesis or direct activation of IGF-IR. Cells were incubated in serum-free medium overnight to synchronize the cells and achieve basal phosphorylation of the IGF-IR. Identical cultures were lysed either before or after a 3-min exposure to IGF-I to stimulate the IGF-IR. Equal amounts of protein were immunoprecipitated with an IGF-IR antibody, followed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and blotting with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies is shown in Fig.4 (upper panel). The blot was then stripped and probed with IGF-IR β-subunit antibody (Fig. 4,lower panel). Densitometry was performed on all phosphotyrosine and IGF-IR blots. The fold increases in phosphorylation, after correction for IGF-IR levels, were averaged for all WF and W clones (Table II). WF clones absolute IGF-IR autophosphorylation did not differ significantly from W clones, with an average 9.6-fold stimulation compared with 6.2-fold stimulation, respectively (Student's t test,p < 0.25). Total protein lysates without immunoprecipitation were evaluated by immunoblot for IGF-IR levels and showed equal amounts of IGF-IR in both WF and W clones (data not shown). Because neither IGF-IR protein levels nor activity was significantly altered by the EWS/FLI-1 message, we sought to determine if IGF-I-stimulated signaling distal to the IGF-IR differed between WF and W clones. Paired IGF-I stimulated/unstimulated lysates were prepared as described above. Fig. 5 (upper panel) shows a phosphotyrosine immunoblot from 100 μg of total protein, with alternate lanes being stimulated with IGF-I. The most striking difference between WF and W clones was the presence of an accentuated band in the stimulated WF lanes occurring at approximately 180 kDa. We confirmed this band to be the 180-kDa protein IRS-1 by stripping the membrane followed by specific blotting with anti-IRS-1 (Fig. 5, lower panel). Each pair of samples are shown here to have equal amounts of IRS-1 protein, indicating that the phosphorylation difference represents increased protein phosphorylation rather than higher protein levels. Densitometry revealed a trend of increased absolute IRS-1 phosphorylation in WF clones (data not shown), so that we chose to focus our study on IRS-1 phosphorylation. We evaluated the tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 by preparing lysates in the manner described in the legend to Fig. 4 and then immunoprecipitating with a pleckstrin homology domain IRS-1 antibody from equal amounts of protein lysates (Fig.6). The transferred blot was cut at the 43-kDa standard following blocking. The top panel was blotted for phosphotyrosine residues, whereas the middle panel was blotted for the co-precipitant Grb2. The top panel of Fig. 6 shows phosphorylation levels of IRS-1. The clones that express the fusion message, WF3 and WF36, have lower basal prestimulation levels of IRS-1 phosphorylation, whereas the two clones without the fusion message, W5 and W17, have relatively increased basal phosphorylation. A comparison of band density, with correction for IRS-1 protein levels, was performed, similar to that in Fig. 4. WF clones absolute IGF-I-induced IRS-1 phosphorylation differed significantly from W clones, with an average 6.0-fold stimulation compared with 1.5-fold stimulation, respectively (Table II, Student'st test, p < 0.05). Grb2, an adapter molecule that binds only phosphorylated IRS-1, will co-precipitate with IRS-1. We found that the levels of Grb2 in both unstimulated and stimulated lysate correspond to the phosphorylation state of IRS-1,i.e. lower Grb2 levels in unstimulated WF3 and WF36 lysates compared with unstimulated W5 and W17 lysates (Fig. 6, middle panel). The bottom panel in Fig. 6 demonstrates IRS-1 protein levels in the phosphotyrosine immunoblot following stripping and reprobing with IRS-1 carboxyl-terminal antibody. Ewing's family of tumors contain an EWS/ets gene translocation in 95% of tumors studied (1Delattre O. Zucman J. Melot T. Garau X.S. Zucker J.M. Lenoir G.M. Ambros P.F. Sheer D. Turc C.C. Triche T.J.

The fusion protein generated as a result of the translocation transforms fibroblasts, and inhibition of the fusion protein reduces cell growth (9Ouchida M. Ohno T. Fujimura Y. Rao V.N. Reddy E.S. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 1049-1054PubMed Google Scholar, 12Toretsky J. Connell Y. Neckers L. Bhat N. J. Neuro-Oncol. 1997; 31: 9-16Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13May W.A. Gishizky M.L. Lessnick S.L.

The combination of the ubiquitous nature of the translocation, the transformation properties of the fusion protein, and the growth inhibition by the reduction of fusion protein expression indicates that the EWS/ets translocation plays a significant role in the biology of ESFT. The IGF-IR plays a critical role in growth and development (17Liu J.P. Baker J. Perkins A.S. Robertson E.J. Efstratiadis A. Cell. 1993; 75: 59-72Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2597) Google Scholar, 24Sell C. Dumenil G. Deveaud C. Miura M. Coppola D. DeAngelis T. Rubin R. Efstratiadis A. Baserga R. Mol. Cell.

Cell. 1993; 75: 73-82Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2072) Google Scholar). Ligand stimulation of the IGF-IR generates a mitogenic signal, and when overexpressed, the IGF-IR can be independently transforming (20Kaleko M. Rutter W.J. Miller A.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 464-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). ESFT cells express the IGF-IR, and blockade of ligand binding results in decreased cell growth (21Scotlandi K. Benini S. Sarti M. Serra M. Lollini P.L. Maurici D. Picci P. Manara M.C. Baldini N. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 4570-4574PubMed Google Scholar, 22Yee D. Favoni R.E. Lebovic G.S. Lombana F. Powell D.R. Reynolds C.P. Rosen N. J. Clin. Invest. 1990; 86: 1806-1814Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that the IGF-IR signaling pathway is important for the growth of ESFT. We developed a model to evaluate the effect of the EWS/FLI-1 fusion protein upon cells in the presence and the absence of the IGF-IR. R− cells lack the IGF-IR, whereas the W cells express the IGF-IR. We first sought to determine whether the EWS/FLI-1 fusion protein would transform primary mouse fibroblast cells (not all primary cell lines have been able to be transformed with this protein), 3C. Denny, personal communication. and if so, would they transform cells from littermate animals without the IGF-IR. Most oncogenes thus far described have not transformed the R− cells, including a combination of activated ras and SV40 large T antigen (23Sell C. Rubini M. Rubin R. Liu J.P. Efstratiadis A. Baserga R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11217-11221Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar, 29D'Ambrosio C. Hongo A. Li S. Baserga R. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 371-378PubMed Google Scholar, 30Fei Z.L. D'Ambrosio C. Li S. Surmacz E. Baserga R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4232-4239Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A constitutively active G-protein mutant Gα13 does, however, transform R− cells.2This recent finding indicates that in fact not all transformation events require the presence of the IGF-IR. We show here that W cells transfected with the EWS/FLI-1 fusion protein (WF cells) do grow in an anchorage-independent fashion, whereas the R− cells transfected with the same cDNA (R−F cells) do not. Thus the answer to our initial question is that the EWS/FLI-1 requires the presence of the IGF-IR to transform cells. To confirm that the IGF-IR pathway was activated in some way by the EWS/FLI-1 fusion protein, we selected a series of WF and W clones and analyzed the effect of ligand stimulation in the presence or the absence of the EWS/FLI-1 fusion protein. Neither IGF-IR levels nor ligand-induced receptor activation changes as a result of the presence of the EWS/FLI-1 fusion protein. When values were averaged, there was a slight difference between WF and W clones; however, this was not significant. The docking protein IRS-I, known to bind directly to the IGF-IR (14Rubin R. Baserga R. Lab. Invest. 1995; 73: 311-331PubMed Google Scholar), demonstrated an apparent hypophosphorylation in WF compared with W cells preceding IGF-I stimulation. IRS-1 phosphorylation was then specifically evaluated by immunoprecipitation and phosphotyrosine analysis. We show decreased basal levels of IRS-1 phosphorylation in the unstimulated WF clones, which contain the EWS/FLI-1 fusion protein. The observed absolute increase in phosphorylation of IRS-1 in response to ligand stimulation of WF cells is therefore due to an altered (lower) basal phosphorylation state. We corroborated our findings with the coprecipitation of Grb2, an SH2 domain-containing adapter protein that only binds to phosphorylated sites on IRS-1. In these studies, co-precipitated Grb-2 levels were lower in unstimulated WF cells compared with W cells, thus corroborating the decreased basal phosphorylation of IRS-1 in the unstimulated WF clones. When either WF or W cells were stimulated, coprecipitated Grb-2 levels rose in tandem with the rise in IRS-1 phosphorylation. Our finding of increased ligand-stimulated IRS-1 phosphorylation in WF clones compared with W clones is likely a reflection of the communication between the fusion protein and the IGF-IR pathway. The data indicate that the communication between IGF-IR signaling and the target genes of the EWS/FLI-1 fusion protein occurs downstream of the IGF-IR, based on IGF-IR protein levels and autophosphorylation activity, which are similar in both W or WF cells. This may represent a unique interaction in the ESFT or may turn out to be characteristic of how novel chimeric transcription factors function in transformation. The precise communication between the fusion protein and the IGF-IR signaling pathway remains to be specifically elucidated. One hypothesis we are currently testing is that Syp or another protein tyrosine phosphatase may be a downstream target of the EWS/FLI-1 fusion protein. Syp, for example, is a SHPTP2 protein that is directly activated by IGF-IR (34Seely B.L. Reichart D.R. Staubs P.A. Jhun B.H. Hsu D. Maegawa H. Milarski K.L. Saltiel A.R. Olefsky J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19151-19157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) and as an activated tyrosine phosphatase is mitogenic (35Xiao S. Rose D.W. Sasaoka T. Maegawa H. Burke Jr., T.R. Roller P.P. Shoelson S.E. Olefsky J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21244-21248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Additional studies have shown that Syp is required for effective signaling through the insulin receptor (36Yamauchi K. Ribon V. Saltiel A.R. Pessin J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17716-17722Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 37Yamauchi K. Milarski K.L. Saltiel A.R. Pessin J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In addition, this protein binds to phosphotyrosine residues within the SH2 domains of Grb2 and other growth regulatory receptors such as the platelet-derived growth factor receptor (39Li W.

Both the activation of Syp by IGF-IR, albeit not the only activator of Syp, and IRS-1 as a target of activated Syp, may explain the difference in basal IRS-1 phosphorylation. Syp may therefore play a key role in the communication between the EWS/FLI-1 protein and the IGF-IR pathway. It is also possible that although the IGF-IR appears to be required in our system, what may really be required is the activation of a downstream target, like IRS-1. Combinations of transfections into R− cells including an oncogene, SV40 large T antigen, plus either IRS-1 or Grb2 (adapter protein downstream of many receptor tyrosine kinases, including the IGF-IR), produce cells capable of anchorage-independent growth (29D'Ambrosio C. Hongo A. Li S. Baserga R. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 371-378PubMed Google Scholar, 30Fei Z.L. D'Ambrosio C. Li S. Surmacz E. Baserga R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4232-4239Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Transformation that occurs by combining a known transforming oncogene, SV-40 large T Ag, with the overexpression of targets known to be downstream of the IGF-IR indicates that potentially converging pathways may allow for a bypass of the IGF-IR. We conclude that the EWS/FLI-1 fusion protein requires the IGF-IR to transform cells. Our model shows that clones expressing the EWS/FLI-1 fusion protein had increased IRS-1 phosphorylation compared with those clones without the fusion protein. Based on this, we presume that communication occurs between the EWS/FLI-1 fusion protein and the IGF-IR signaling pathway; however, the mechanism is not yet described. Further investigation is needed to elucidate alterations in signaling pathways that result from the aberrent EWS-FLI-1 fusion protein during transformation.

https://openalex.org/W2062465228,"The insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) are transported by a family of high-affinity binding proteins (IGFBPs) that protect IGFs from degradation, limit their binding to IGF receptors, and modulate IGF actions. The six classical IGFBPs have been believed to have no affinity for insulin. We now demonstrate that IGFBP-7/mac25, a newly identified member of the IGFBP superfamily that binds IGFs specifically with low affinity is a high-affinity insulin binding protein. IGFBP-7 blocks insulin binding to the insulin receptor and thereby inhibiting the earliest steps in insulin action, such as autophosphorylation of the insulin receptor beta subunit and phosphorylation of IRS-1, indicating that IGFBP-7 is a functional insulin-binding protein. The affinity of other IGFBPs for insulin can be enhanced by modifications that disrupt disulfide bonds or remove the conserved COOH terminus. Like IGFBP-7, an NH2-terminal fragment of IGFBP-3 (IGFBP-3((1-87))), also binds insulin with high affinity and blocks insulin action. IGFBPs with enhanced affinity for insulin might contribute to the insulin resistance of pregnancy, type II diabetes mellitus, and other pathological conditions."

The genomic RNA contains 10,723 nucleotides that contains a single open reading frame encoding a polyprotein precursor of 3391 amino acid residues with a gene order of 5′-C-prM-E-NS1-NS2A-NS2B-NS3-NS4A-NS4B-NS5–3′ (in New Guinea C-strain (1Irie K. Mohan P.M. Sasaguri Y. Putnak R. Padmanabhan R. Gene (Amst .). 1989; 75: 197-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar)). The 5′-end of the genomic RNA has a type I cap, and the 3′-end is devoid of a poly(A) tail (for review, see Ref. 2Chambers T.J. Hahn C.S. Galler R. Rice C.M. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1990; 44: 649-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (1613) Google Scholar). The polyprotein precursor is processed into three structural proteins that are assembled into the virion (C, prM, and E) and at least seven nonstructural proteins, NS1 to NS5, which are expressed in infected cells (2Chambers T.J. Hahn C.S. Galler R. Rice C.M. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1990; 44: 649-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (1613) Google Scholar). The processing of the N-terminal region of the polyprotein precursor that encodes the structural proteins (C, prM, and E) is carried out by the host signal peptidase associated with the endoplasmic reticulum (3Svitkin Y.V.

Virology. 1989; 171: 637-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Further studies showed that the protease activity of NS3 was dependent on the presence of NS2B. Moreover, NS2B and NS3 form a complex in virus-infected cells (8Arias C.F. Preugschat F. Strauss J.H. Virology. 1993; 193: 888-899Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 9Chambers T.J.

These cleavage sites have the consensus sequence of two amino acids (KR, RR, RK, and occasionally QR) at the −2 and −1 positions, followed by Gly, Ala, or Ser at the +1 position (2Chambers T.J. Hahn C.S. Galler R. Rice C.M. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1990; 44: 649-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (1613) Google Scholar). The cleavage that converts prM to M protein occurs at a late step during viral morphogenesis and is mediated by a cellular protease located in a post-Golgi acidic compartment of the cell (24Randolph V.B. Winkler G. Stollar V. Virology. 1990; 174: 450-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). The goal of the current study was to develop an in vitroprocessing system for characterization of the role of NS2B in the activation of NS3 protease. When NS2B and NS3 were coexpressed in mammalian cells using a recombinant vaccinia virus expression system, the protease activity that cleaved the NS4B-NS5(93 aa) substratein vitro partitioned with the membrane fraction. Using the coupled in vitro transcription/translation system, we demonstrated that cotranslational insertion of the NS2B-NS3(Pro) precursor into the endoplasmic reticulum membranes markedly enhanced the NS3-dependent cis and transcleavages. However, this membrane-dependent enhancement was nullified by deletion of the hydrophobic regions of NS2B. Under these conditions, the cleavage of the 2B/3 site in the precursor occurred with increased efficiency in the absence of membranes.

Gene (Amst .). 1993; 129: 197-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) was digested with NcoI (nt 6818) and EcoRI (nt 7639), and the resulting fragment (821 base pairs) was cloned into the pTM1-ndNS4B-NS5(93 aa)-PFH vector digested with NcoI (in vector) and EcoRI (nt 7639) to yield pTM1-NS4B-NS5(93 aa)-PFH (Fig. 1 H). The recombinant vaccinia viruses encoding NS2B-PFH and NS3(Pro)-PFH (vvNS2B-PFH and vvNS3(Pro)-PFH) were prepared as described previously (29Chen H. Padmanabhan R. Methods Mol. Biol. 1997; 62: 199-206PubMed Google Scholar). The rabbit reticulocyte coupled transcription/translation system (TnT) was used for expression of proteins in vitro. Plasmid DNAs purified by CsCl-ethidium bromide ultracentrifugation (1 μg/reaction) were used for the TnT reactions carried out at 30 °C for 90 min in a total volume of 25 μl. T7 RNA polymerase, trans-[35S]methionine label (20 μCi) and canine pancreatic microsomal membranes (3 μl unless otherwise indicated) were added to the TnT reactions. When microsomal membranes were isolated, TnT reactions were centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 15 min, and the isolated membrane pellet was subsequently washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The TnT reactions were terminated by addition of cycloheximide (0.6 mg/ml), cold methionine (1 mm), and RNase (1 μg) and incubation at 30 °C for 20 min. To determine the effect of post-translational addition of membranes, the TnT reactions after termination were incubated for 3 h at 30 °C. Subconfluent monolayers of HeLa cells (3 × 106 in a 25-cm2 tissue culture flask) were infected with 10 plaque forming units/cell of vTF7-3 and transfected with 5 μg of the indicated expression constructs using liposome-mediated DNA uptake. The cells were incubated at 37 °C for 4 h after which time fresh media containing fetal bovine serum (10%) was added. Incubation was continued for an additional 15 h at 37 °C. Cells were subsequently harvested and washed with PBS, pH 7.4, and lysed with 0.1 ml of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) lysis buffer (65 mmTris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 5% 2-mercaptoethanol, and 0.001% bromphenol blue). Proteins were resolved on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and subjected to immunoblot analysis using the commercially available FLAG monoclonal antibody. BHK-21 monolayers were infected with vTF7-3 and the specified recombinant vaccinia viruses at 10 plaque-forming units/cell. Approximately 16 h postinfection, the cells were harvested by scraping and washed with PBS. The cell pellet was then resuspended in 50 μl of lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.25 mg/ml cycloheximide, and 0.5% Triton X-100) and incubated on ice for 1 h. The lysate was then centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 20 min, and the resulting pellet was resuspended in 50 μl of the above buffer. For trans cleavage assays, 25 μl of the soluble or the resuspended pellet fraction obtained by centrifugation was incubated with the NS4B-NS5(93 aa) precursor. The NS4B-NS5(93 aa) precursor was synthesized in the presence and absence of microsomal membranes as indicated. Reactions were incubated at 30 °C for 3 h and subsequently terminated by addition of the SDS loading buffer. Microsomal membranes were isolated by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 15 min following TnT and were washed once with PBS, pH 7.2. The washed membrane pellets were then resuspended in either 80 μl of PBS, pH 7.2, or 80 μl of 100 mm sodium carbonate, pH 11.5, and incubated on ice for 30 min. Membranes were then pelleted by centrifugation at 200,000 ×g for 1 h at 4 °C. Proteins associated with the membrane pellet and supernatant fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography of the gel (Fujiki et al.(31Fujiki Y. Fowler S. Shio H. Hubbard A.L. Lazarow P.B. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 93: 103-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar)). Analysis of membrane-associated NS3(Pro)-PFH and NS2B-PFH expressed from recombinant vaccinia viruses in BHK-21 cells was carried out as follows. Cell pellets (from 6-well plates) were resuspended in 80 μl of H buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 5 mmKCl, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and lysed by passage through a 27.5-gauge needle. The lysate was subjected to centrifugation at 200,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. The soluble fraction was saved. The pellet was resuspended in 80 μl of 100 mm sodium carbonate, pH 11.5, and sonicated (4 × 30-s bursts in ice) using a cup-horn sonicator (Heat Systems Ultrasonics, model 185 F) at power setting of 7. The lysate was centrifuged as before to obtain the soluble and pellet fractions. Proteins from each fraction were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blot analysis using the FLAG monoclonal antibody. The goal of this study was to develop an in vitro processing system for biochemical characterization of the viral encoded NS2B/NS3 protease. The initial strategy for developing this in vitro processing system was to express NS2B and the N-terminal protease domain of NS3 (NS3(Pro)) using the recombinant vaccinia virus expression system. To facilitate purification of NS2B and NS3(Pro), the coding sequences of both proteins were modified by a C-terminal fusion of 27 amino acid residues (PFH) consisting of a protein kinase A phosphorylation site, a synthetic FLAG epitope recognized by a monoclonal antibody, and a hexahistidine tag (25Zhao L.J. Narayan O. Gene (Amst .). 1993; 137: 345-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). First, we verified that this C-terminal modification of NS2B and NS3 did not affect their biological activity in the processing of NS3-NS4A-NS4B-NS5 polyprotein substrate in vivo. When the protease components and the substrate were coexpressed in vivo, the efficiency of processing was similar to that of unmodified NS2B and NS3(Pro) reported earlier (16Zhang L. Mohan P.M. Padmanabhan R. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 7549-7554Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (data not shown). To establish an in vitro processing system that can carry out trans cleavages, BHK-21 cells were infected with recombinant vaccinia viruses encoding the T7 RNA polymerase (vTF7-3), NS2B-PFH, and NS3(Pro)-PFH. NS2B and NS3 coding sequences in these recombinant viruses are under the control of T7 promoter/encephalomyocarditis virus 5′-untranslated region (30Moss B. Elroy-Stein O. Mizukami T. Alexander W.A. Fuerst T.R. Nature. 1990; 348: 91-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar) which requires T7 RNA polymerase (from vTF7-3 infection) for expression. Infected cells were then treated with Triton X-100 lysis buffer, and the lysates were fractionated into cytoplasmic and membrane fractions by centrifugation (15,000 × g). NS2B-PFH and NS3(Pro)-PFH fractionated into the pellet fraction (Fig.2 A, lanes 1–3). The pellet fraction was resuspended in a buffer containing Triton X-100 and assayed for protease activity using the substrate NS4B-NS5(93 aa)-PFH labeled with [35S]methionine in the TnT reaction. Processing of the NS4B-NS5(93 aa)-PFH substrate was observed only when the substrate was incubated with the membrane-associated pellet fraction but not with the supernatant fraction (Fig. 2 B, compare lanes 3 and 4). In this experiment the detection of NS5(93 aa) was obscured by the endogenously produced globin. Since NS4B is a membrane-associated protein, the NS4B-NS5(93 aa)-PFH precursor was synthesized in vitro in the presence of microsomal membranes. In this manner, it was possible to make the NS4B-NS5(93 aa)-PFH substrate associated with the membranes and remove the endogenous globin by centrifugation (15,000 × g). This substrate was incubated with the microsomal pellet fraction isolated from cells expressing the NS2B and NS3(Pro) or from the vTF7-3-infected cells as control. As shown in Fig.2 C, processing of the NS4B-NS5(93 aa)-PFH substrate was observed by the membrane-associated NS2B-PFH and NS3(Pro)-PFH. These results taken together indicated that NS2B-PFH and NS3(Pro)-PFH are associated with the membrane fraction of the infected cell lysates and are active in trans cleavage of the 4B/5 site. The association of the protease activity of NS2B-PFH and NS3(Pro)-PFH with the membrane pellet fraction of recombinant vaccinia virus-infected BHK-21 cell lysates could be explained by two possible scenarios. First, overexpression of proteins in the recombinant vaccinia virus expression system could result in aggregation and partitioning of the protein into the membrane pellet fraction. Second, NS2B-PFH and NS3(Pro)-PFH have intrinsic properties for association with the membranes, and this membrane association is required for optimal protease activity. To investigate these possibilities, the cis cleavage of the 2B/3 site was examined using an expression plasmid encoding the NS2B-NS3(Pro)-PFH precursor. The NS2B-NS3(Pro)-PFH precursor was expressed in HeLa cells by plasmid transfection followed by infection with vTF7-3 to provide T7 RNA polymerase (30Moss B. Elroy-Stein O. Mizukami T. Alexander W.A. Fuerst T.R. Nature. 1990; 348: 91-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). The processing was monitored by Western blot analysis using the FLAG monoclonal antibody. As shown in Fig.3 A (lane 2), the processing of NS2B-NS3(Pro)-PFH precursor in vivo was very efficient as little unprocessed precursor was detected. Expression of the NS2B-NS3(Pro)-PFH precursor in vitro using the TnT reaction yielded markedly different results. In contrast to the efficient processing of the NS2B-NS3(Pro)-PFH precursor observedin vivo, only a trace amount of precursor underwent processing in vitro in the absence of microsomal membranes. Therefore, the TnT reactions were conducted in the presence or absence of canine pancreatic microsomal membranes to determine whether membranes influenced the cleavage efficiency. As shown in Fig.3 B, only a faint band was observed in the 36-kDa size range which is the expected size of NS3(Pro)-PFH liberated by ciscleavage of the 2B/3 junction (Fig. 3 B, lane 2). However,in vitro processing assays conducted in the presence of microsomal membranes significantly enhanced the efficiency of cleavage of the 2B/3 site (Fig. 3 B, lane 3). The possibility that a contaminating protease in the microsomal membrane preparation was cleaving the NS2B-NS3(Pro)-PFH precursor was considered. To eliminate this possibility the precursor NS2B-NS3*(Pro) containing a His51 → Ala mutation within the catalytic triad of NS3 was translated in the presence of microsomal membranes. Expression of the NS2B-NS3*(Pro) precursor in the presence of microsomal membranes did not result in any detectable cleavage of the precursor (Fig.3 B, lane 1). These results indicated that processing of the NS2B-NS3(Pro)-PFH precursor is markedly stimulated on microsomal membranes and the wild type protease domain of NS3. When total lysates were resolved by SDS-PAGE, NS2B was obscured by co-migration of endogenously produced globin. To definitively identify both NS2B and NS3(Pro)-PFH, the lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation using a mixture of anti-NS2B and anti-NS3 antibodies (Fig. 3 C, lanes 1–3) or anti-NS3 alone (Fig.3 C, lanes 4–6). Analysis of the immunoprecipitates by SDS-PAGE revealed the identity of both proteins. Immunoprecipitates from translation reactions in which the NS2B-NS3(Pro)-PFH precursor was expressed in the presence of membranes resulted in increased amounts of immunoprecipitated NS2B and NS3(Pro)-PFH. Furthermore, NS2B and NS3(Pro) were not detected in the immunoprecipitates of TnT reactions in which the NS2B-NS3*(Pro) precursor containing the His51 → Ala mutation was expressed (Fig. 3 C, lanes 1 and 4). The results obtained thus far established that processing of the NS2B-NS3(Pro)-PFH precursor is markedly enhanced by microsomal membranes. Next, it was examined whether the precursor protein or the products of processing were associated with the membranes. The NS2B-NS3*(Pro) and NS2B-NS3(Pro)-PFH precursors were expressed in the TnT reaction in the presence and absence of microsomal membranes. The reactions were then subjected to centrifugation (15,000 × g) to recover the microsomal membranes. As shown in Fig.4, in the absence of microsomal membranes both the NS2B-NS3*(Pro) and NS2B-NS3(Pro)-PFH precursors were recovered predominantly in the supernatant fraction (Fig. 4, compare lanes 1 and 5, 3 and 7, respectively). Only a faint band was observed in the 36-kDa region in the NS2B-NS3(Pro)-PFH reactions indicating that very little processing of the precursor occurred in the absence of microsomal membranes confirming the results shown in Fig. 3 (Fig. 4, lanes 3 and7). When the NS2B-NS3*(Pro) and NS2B-NS3(Pro)-PFH precursors were translated in the presence of microsomal membranes, polypeptides corresponding to the unprocessed precursors were recovered from both the supernatant and membrane pellet fractions (Fig. 4, lanes 2 and 6, 4 and 8, respectively). However, the cleavage products, NS3(Pro)-PFH and NS2B, were found predominantly in the membrane pellet fraction (Fig. 4, comparelane 4 and 8). Furthermore, both NS3(Pro)-PFH and NS2B were clearly resolved when the membrane pellet fractions were analyzed. Analysis of the membrane pellet from reactions expressing the NS2B-NS3*(Pro) precursor revealed only a band corresponding to the unprocessed precursor. Thus, in the absence of a functional protease domain, the precursor was still associated with the membrane, but the precursor did not undergo processing (Fig. 4, lane 6), suggesting that the increased processing efficiency of the NS2B-NS3(Pro)-PFH precursor in membrane-supplemented reactions was not the result of a contaminating protease. The previous experiments clearly showed that microsomal membranes increased the processing efficiency of the NS2B-NS3(Pro)-PFH precursor and that proteins liberated during processing were essentially membrane-associated. The presence of a large amount of unprocessed precursor suggested that microsomal membranes were limiting in the TnT reaction. To examine this possibility, the NS2B-NS3(Pro)-PFH precursor was expressed in the TnT reaction in the presence of increasing amounts of microsomal membranes, and both the total lysate and the membrane pellet fractions obtained by centrifugation were analyzed. Analysis of the total lysates revealed that processing efficiency increased with increasing amounts of microsomal membranes added to the TnT reactions as shown by the increasing amounts of NS3(Pro)-PFH produced (Fig.5, lanes 1–4). Detection of NS2B in total lysates was obscured by co-migration of endogenously produced globin (Fig. 5, lanes 1–4). Therefore, aliquots of total cell lysates were fractionated into soluble and membrane pellet fractions by centrifugation (15,000 × g). Analysis of the microsomal pellet fractions showed that increasing amounts membranes added cotranslationally proportionately increased the cleavage products NS3(Pro)-PFH and NS2B (Fig. 5, lanes 5–8). Next, we sought to determine whether the membrane-dependent enhancement of the processing of NS2B-NS3(Pro)-PFH precursor is a cotranslational or post-translational event. To address this question, the NS2B-NS3(Pro)-PFH precursor was expressed using the TnT reaction in the absence of microsomal membranes. RNase, cycloheximide, and cold methionine were added to terminate the TnT reaction. To one-half of the TnT reaction microsomal membranes were added post-translationally, and the reactions were incubated for an additional 3 h at 30 °C. As a positive control, the NS2B-NS3(Pro)-PFH precursor was expressed cotranslationally with microsomal membranes, and following termination of the TnT reaction u"

Previous studies with cell lines have focussed on α1β1 and α2β1, the principal collagen-binding integrins, but have yielded conflicting data. We have examined this issue in wound healing in the liver, isolating the myofibroblast population (activated stellate cells) and quantitating expression of the α1 and α2 integrin subunits during the in vivo injury. Normal stellate cells displayed α1 but no detectable α2. During injury, α1 expression was maintained; α2 became detectable at the mRNA level but at all times was <8% of α1 mRNA. Contraction of collagen lattices, studied with 24-h cultured cells and initiated by endothelin 1, was blocked 70% by anti-α1 and 30% by anti-α2 (both significant, p< 0.05). The inhibition by anti-α2, which was unexpected, was attributable to culture-induced change in integrin expression; both the mRNA and protein for α2 increased strikingly within 24 h of plating stellate cells on a collagen gel. We conclude that α1β1 is the sole integrin utilized by contracting myofibroblasts in vivo. Although α2β1 is capable of mediating contraction, its expression by myofibroblasts occurs largely, if not exclusively, in response to culture.

We conclude that α1β1 is the sole integrin utilized by contracting myofibroblasts in vivo. Although α2β1 is capable of mediating contraction, its expression by myofibroblasts occurs largely, if not exclusively, in response to culture. Wound repair is a multi-step process in which contraction is an important element (1Skalli O. Gabbiani G. Clark R.A.F. Henson P.M. The Molecular and Cellular Biology of Wound Repair. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1988: 373-402Crossref Google Scholar). In its initial phase, mesenchymal cells are drawn to the injury site, where they deposit a collagen-rich extracellular matrix (ECM). 1The abbreviations used are: ECM, extracellular matrix; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. The ECM undergoes organization, with alignment of collagen fibrils. Myofibroblasts attach via matrix-binding surface receptors, which provide points of traction as cells shorten. The contractile action compacts the ECM lattice, promoting wound closure and restoring tissue integrity. Although this process is vital to host defense, it has a negative side. In epithelial tissues, repetitive injury leads to multiple cycles of wound repair with extensive deposition of ECM. Contraction in this setting may distort and disrupt tissue structure with undesirable consequences. For example, strips of cirrhotic liver are contractile (2Irle C. Kocher O. Gabbiani G. J. Submicrosc. Cytol. 1980; 12: 209-217Google Scholar), a property that may contribute to the portal hypertension that accompanies chronic liver disease. For these reasons the molecular basis of contraction is under study. An important goal is characterizing the receptors that mediate the binding of myofibroblasts to ECM, as these are potential targets for therapeutic modulation of contraction. Given the importance of an organized collagen matrix to the contraction process, the “classical” collagen-binding receptors, α1β1 and α2β1 integrins, have come under particular scrutiny. Several investigations have taken advantage of the fact that cell lines with myofibroblast-like characteristics express one or both of these integrins (3Carver W. Molano L. Reaves T.A. Borg T.K.

Cell. 1991; 67: 403-410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). The conclusions have varied. A persuasive study with skin fibroblasts found that α2β1 was essential and sufficient for contraction (7Schiro J.A. Chan B.M.C. Roswit W.T. Kassner P.D. Pentland A.P. Hemler M.E. Eisen A.Z. Kupper T.S. Cell. 1991; 67: 403-410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). In contrast, a recent report described a smooth muscle cell line that expresses α1β1 only and is fully contractile; the same study found α2β1 is not detectable by immunohistochemistry during vascular wound healing (4Gotwals P.J. Chi-Rosso G. Lindner V. Yang J. Ling L. Fawell S.E. Koteliansky V.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 2469-2477Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), raising questions about the in vivo relevance of α2 expression in culture. The present studies address the role of these integrins in vivo, in liver undergoing wound repair. Two models of liver injury have been used: total ligation of the bile duct and administration of dimethylnitrosamine. Both procedures reproducibly induce wound repair as evidenced by the appearance in the liver of myofibroblasts and fibrogenesis. The myofibroblast population in liver derives largely from stellate cells, which are liver pericytes (also known as Ito cells, fat-storing cells, or lipocytes) (8Ballardini G. Fallini M. Biagini G.

In injury, stellate cells undergo a transition to myofibroblasts that is well-documented and has been termed activation (10Friedman S.L. N. Engl. J. Med. 1993; 328: 1828-1835Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). The singular advantage of the liver model for studies of wound repair is the availability of methods for preparing mass isolates of stellate cells. By analysis of isolates at various time points during the evolution of the injury, direct information on gene expression and function is obtained, representing a profile of in vivo integrin expression. Amplification of cells in culture, which routinely results in phenotypic change (10Friedman S.L. N. Engl. J. Med. 1993; 328: 1828-1835Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar, 11Bissell D.M. Guzelian P.S. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1980; 349: 85-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar), is avoided. The isolated cells are suitable also for direct in vitro assessment of their ECM binding activity and contractility. Monoclonal blocking antibodies against rat α1 (clone Ha31/8), α2 (clone Ha1/29), β1 (clone Ha2/11), and murine α1 (clone 3A3) integrin subunits were gifts from V. Koteliansky (Biogen Inc., Boston, MA) (12Mendrick D.L. Kelly D.M. Lab. Invest. 1993; 69: 690-702PubMed Google Scholar, 13Mendrick D.L. Kelly D.M. DuMont S.S. Sandstrom D.J. Lab.

Santoro (St. Louis, MO) (15Wu J.E. Santoro S.A. Dev. Dyn. 1994; 199: 292-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 16Wu J.E. Santoro S.A. Dev.

Tarone (Torino, Italy). Monoclonal antibody against murine αv integrin subunit was obtained from Pharmingen (San Diego, CA). The probe for α1 integrin subunit was a 479-base pair cDNA (nucleotides 1871–2350) subcloned into pGEM4Z (Promega, Madison, WI) from a full-length cDNA provided by M. J. Ignatius (Berkeley, CA) (17Ignatius M.J. Large T.H. Houde M. Tawil J.W. Barton A. Esch F. Carbonetto S. Reichardt L.F. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 709-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The probe for the α2 integrin subunit was an 843-base pair cDNA (nucleotides 1456–2299) subclone in pBluescript II SK- kindly provided by S. A. Santoro (St. Louis, MO) (15Wu J.E. Santoro S.A. Dev. Dyn. 1994; 199: 292-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Hepatic injury was induced in male Sprague-Dawley rats (500–600 g) by ligation of the biliary duct. Bile duct ligation is well characterized with respect to the time course and extent of fibrogenesis (18Bienkowski R.S. Cowan M.J. McDonald J.A. Crystal R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 4356-4363Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Maher J.J. McGuire R.F. J. Clin. Invest. 1990; 86: 1641-1648Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). Sham-operated animals underwent laparotomy and bile duct manipulation without ligation. Animals were maintained postoperatively on food and water ad libitum. In some studies, hepatic fibrosis was induced by intraperitoneal injection of dimethylnitrosamine in a dose of 1 μl (diluted 1:100 in 0.15 m NaCl)/100 g body weight given on the first 3 days of each week (20Ala-Kokko L. Pihlajaniemi T. Myers J.C. Kivirikko K.I. Savolainen E.-R. Biochem. J. 1987; 244: 75-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Stellate cells were isolated as described (21Jarnagin W.R.

Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 2037-2048Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar) by liver perfusion with Pronase (Boehringer Mannheim) and collagenase (Crescent Serva, Hauppause, NY) followed by ultracentrifugation on a discontinuous gradient of Accudenz® (8.2 and 15.6% w/v) (Accurate Chemicals, Westbury, NY). The top interface contained stellate cells, which were collected and washed twice in culture medium to remove debris. Stellate cells were identified by their intrinsic vitamin A autofluorescence (22Friedman S.L. Roll F.J. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 161: 1233-1247Crossref Scopus (311) Google Scholar) and by staining for the intermediate filament, desmin (9Rockey D.C. Boyles J.K. Gabbiani G. Friedman S. J. Submicrosc. Cytol. Pathol. 1992; 24: 193-203PubMed Google Scholar). Their purity was >95%. They were used fresh or plated in a modified medium 199 (23Irving M.G. Roll F.J. Huang S. Bissell D.M. Gastroenterology. 1984; 87: 1233-1247Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) containing 20% serum (10% horse, 10% calf; Life Technologies, Inc.). Total RNA was extracted from stellate cells using Tri Reagent® (Molecular Research Center Inc., Cincinnati, OH) (24Chomczynski P. BioTechniques. 1993; 15: 532-537PubMed Google Scholar). Sample quality was assessed by agarose/formaldehyde gel electrophoresis. Radiolabeled antisense RNA probes were synthetized with the appropriate RNA polymerase (Promega) in the presence of [α-32P]CTP (>800 Ci/mmol; Amersham Corp.). Hybridization was performed in solution as described previously using equivalent amounts of RNA as determined byA 260 readings of the extracts (21Jarnagin W.R. Rockey D.C. Koteliansky V.E. Wang S.-S. Bissell D.M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 2037-2048Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). Samples for a given experiment were run as a group, using the same preparation of probe(s) and gel analysis. Unhybridized RNA was digested with ribonuclease T2 (19Maher J.J. McGuire R.F. J. Clin. Invest. 1990; 86: 1641-1648Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). Intact hybrids were precipitated, denatured by boiling for 3 min in electrophoresis buffer, and separated by electrophoresis in a 5% polyacrylamide/urea gel. After drying, gels were applied to X-OMAT AR-5 film (Eastman Kodak, Rochester, NY). Scanning densitometry (Hoefer Scientific Instruments, San Francisco, CA) was used to quantitate the autoradiographic signals. RNA samples were also hybridized with a cDNA encoding 585 base pairs of the ribosomal protein S14 (25Rhoads D.D. Dixit A. Roufa D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 2774-2783Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) as an internal control for the amount of mRNA present in an individual assay. S14 mRNA varies minimally after bile duct ligation (21Jarnagin W.R. Rockey D.C. Koteliansky V.E. Wang S.-S. Bissell D.M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 2037-2048Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). Densitometric data were normalized to S14 expression. Isolated cells were washed with PBS containing Ca2+ and Mg2+, and 200,000–500,000 cells were incubated in a blocking solution consisting of 10% goat serum in PBS for 15 min at room temperature. The primary antibody (clone Ha31/8 for α1, clone Ha1/29 for α2, and clone Ha2/11 for β1) was added to the cell sample and incubated for 25 min on ice. After washing with PBS, the cells were resuspended in phycoerythrin-conjugated anti-hamster IgG diluted in PBS (10 μg/106 cells) (Caltag, South San Francisco, CA), incubated for 20 min on ice in the dark, and then washed. The cells were analyzed for fluorescence on a FACStarPLUS Flow Cytometer (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA). For control samples, the primary antibody was replaced by non-immune IgG. The liver was perfused under low pressure in situ with PBS via the portal vein until free of blood and then removed and cut into small pieces, which were snap-frozen in isopentane prechilled in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C. Immunohistology was performed on 8-μm thick cryostat sections fixed for 10 min in −20 °C acetone (15Wu J.E. Santoro S.A. Dev. Dyn. 1994; 199: 292-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 16Wu J.E. Santoro S.A. Dev. Dyn. 1996; 206: 169-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Sections were incubated 15–30 min in a blocking solution containing 1% fish gelatin (Sigma) in PBS and then incubated with either 3A3 anti-α1 monoclonal antibody (1:500 dilution in blocking solution) (14Turner D.C. Flier L.A. Carbonetto S. J. Neurosci. 1989; 9: 3287-3296Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or with MA2 anti-α2 polyclonal antibody (1:200 dilution) (15Wu J.E. Santoro S.A. Dev. Dyn. 1994; 199: 292-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar,16Wu J.E. Santoro S.A. Dev. Dyn. 1996; 206: 169-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). A biotinylated sheep anti-mouse IgG (1:200) (Amersham Corp.) or a biotinylated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:200) (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) was added. After further washes, the sections were exposed to streptavidin-linked Texas Red (Amersham Corp.) (1:1,000) for 30 min, washed with PBS, and mounted in glycerol for fluorescence microscopy (Dako Corp., Carpinteria, CA). For negative controls, the primary antibody was omitted. Results were recorded with a Nikon Microphot-FX fluorescence microscope and Ilford HP5-plus (ASA 400) film. Cell attachment to collagen was performed as described (26Weinacker A. Chen A. Agrez M. Cone R.I. Nishimura S. Wayner E. Pytela R. Sheppard D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6940-6948Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, untreated polystyrene 96-well flat-bottom microtiter plates (Lindro®/Titertek®, Flow Laboratories, McLean, VA) were coated with collagen type I or IV (10 μg/ml in PBS) (Sigma) or with 1% bovine serum albumin (Sigma) in PBS. Plates were washed with PBS and then blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin for 1 h. Cells were plated at a density of 100,000 cells/well in 200 μl of serum-free medium. For blocking experiments, they were preincubated with antibodies for 15 min at 4 °C before plating. After a 2-h incubation at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator, non-adherent cells were removed by three washes with PBS. The attached cells were fixed and stained with a solution containing 3% formaldehyde, 10% methanol, and 0.5% crystal violet for 1 h. After washing with PBS to eliminate excess dye, the wells were drained, and the absorbance at 595 nm was measured in a microplate reader (Bio-Rad). Values were corrected for background defined as adhesion to bovine serum albumin alone. Each assay was performed in triplicate. Contraction of stellate cells on collagen lattices was examined in 24-well flat-bottom tissue culture plates (Corning Glass Works, Corning, NY) as described previously (27Rockey D.C. Housset C.N. Friedman S.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 1795-1804Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Briefly, culture vessels were preincubated with PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin (Sigma) (500 μl per well) for at least 1 h at 37 °C and then washed twice with PBS and air dried. The gel mixture consisted of 8 parts Vitrogen (Celltrix Corp., Santa Clara, CA), 1 part (10 ×) minimal essential medium (Life Technologies, Inc.), and 1 part 0.2 m HEPES, pH 9.0, which resulted in a final collagen concentration of 2.4 mg/ml. It was prepared at 4 °C, added to the culture vessel, and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C to allow gelation. Stellate cells isolated from animals 6 days after bile duct ligation were plated on top of the gels. After cell attachment for 24 h, serum-free conditions were introduced and endothelin-1 (10−8m, Peninsula Laboratories, Belmont, CA) was added to elicit contraction (27Rockey D.C. Housset C.N. Friedman S.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 1795-1804Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Contraction was monitored as the change in lattice area over time. For integrin-blocking experiments, the appropriate antibodies (clones Ha31/8 for α1, Ha1/29 for α2 and Ha2/11 for β1) were added at plating. The antibody concentration was one that produced 95–100% of maximal inhibition, as determined in preliminary experiments. For anti-α1, this was 217 μg/ml; for anti-α2 it was 223 μg/ml, and for anti-β1 it was 235 μg/ml (all as purified IgG). Stellate cells were metabolically labeled with [35S]methionine (5 mCi/100-mm plate; ICN, Irvine, CA) overnight in medium without methionine and cysteine. Cellular proteins were solubilized in immunoprecipitation buffer (100 mm Tris/HCl pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% Nodinet P-40, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μg of aprotinin, 20 μg of leupeptin) for 30 min at 4 °C. The cell lysate was centrifuged 10 min at 10,000 ×g, and the supernatant was precleared by incubation with protein A-Sepharose CL-4B beads (1:1, v/v, slurry in immunoprecipitation buffer; Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) for 45 min at 4 °C. Incubation with appropriate monoclonal antibody (clone Ha31/8 for α1, clone Ha1/29 for α2, and clone Ha2/11 for β1) was carried out overnight at 4 °C. Rabbit anti-hamster IgG (Pierce) was added 1 h before the end of the incubation, followed by addition of protein A-Sepharose beads. After a 45-min incubation, the beads with attached immune complexes were washed five times with immunoprecipitation buffer and then eluted by boiling for 5 min in 2 × Laemmli loading buffer and resolved in an 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Dried gels were exposed to X-OMAT AR-5 film (Kodak). For studies of cellular localization of α1 and α2, double labeling experiments were performed on stellate cells after 3 days in primary culture. Cells were fixed with 1.5% paraformaldehyde, 0.1% Triton X-100 for 10 min and then immunostained as described above (see “Immunohistochemistry on Liver Sections”). For evaluating co-localization of α1 or α2 and the actin cytoskeleton, double labeling using anti-talin antibody (1:100) (Amersham Corp.) was performed. Staining was analyzed with a confocal microscope (Meridian ACAS 570, Ohemos, MI). Generated images were corrected for compensation and threshold. Values are expressed as mean ± S.E. Statistics were performed with one-way analysis of variance with multiple comparisons. Statistical significance was assigned at probability value less than 0.05. The expression of α1 and α2 mRNA was examined in freshly isolated stellate cells and at various time points after bile duct ligation or dimethylnitrosamine treatment. In stellate cells from normal liver, α1 mRNA was readily detected (Fig.1, A and B), and after bile duct ligation, it remained essentially constant over the 6-day period of observation (Fig. 1, A and C). In contrast, α2 mRNA was undetectable in normal stellate cells (Fig.1, A and B). Although measurable after bile duct ligation (Fig. 1, A and C), at all time points it was less than 8% of α1 mRNA. To test whether these findings were peculiar to bile duct ligation, which causes periportal injury (28Kountouras J. Billing B.H. Scheuer P.J. Br. J. Exp. Pathol. 1984; 65: 305-311PubMed Google Scholar), we carried out a similar study in rats treated for 1 week with dimethylnitrosamine. This chemical causes midzonal and pericentral necrosis (29Tsukamoto H. Matsuoka M. French S.W. Semin. Liver Dis. 1990; 10: 56-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). The profiles of α1 and α2 expression were entirely similar (Fig. 1, B and C). Expression at the protein level was assessed with specific antibodies to α1, α2, and β1 subunits on stellate cells freshly isolated as above. Bound antibody was quantitated by flow cytometry. To ensure that the integrin subunits of interest were not altered by the proteases used in cell isolation, we carried out control studies with WKY cells, a smooth muscle line that is known to express both α1β1 and α2β1 (4Gotwals P.J. Chi-Rosso G. Lindner V. Yang J. Ling L. Fawell S.E. Koteliansky V.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 2469-2477Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Prior to analysis, WKY cells were exposed to Pronase and collagenase as for isolation of stellate cells and then washed and analyzed. All three subunits α1, α2, and β1 were detected (Fig.2 A). In normal stellate cells (Fig. 2 B), α1 and β1 were present but not α2. At 12 h (Fig. 2 C) and 6 days (Fig. 2 D) after induction of injury, the findings were essentially the same: α2 was not detectable despite the observed, albeit small, increase in α2 mRNA at these time points (Fig. 1). In immunohistology of normal liver, α1 appeared as a sharp linear stain along the sinusoids consistent with its localization to stellate or endothelial cells. At 6 days after bile duct ligation, staining was unchanged. In neither setting was α2 detectable, in agreement with the fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis. The reactivity of the α2 antibody in immunohistology was verified by positive staining of rat footpad skin (30Zutter M.M. Santoro S.A. Am. J. Pathol. 1990; 137: 113-120PubMed Google Scholar) (data not shown). Stellate cells were isolated 6 days after bile duct ligation, and their adhesion to collagen was tested. Antibody to α1 integrin reduced adhesion to collagen type I by 90% and to collagen type IV by 95% (Fig.3). Antibody to α2 had no effect, and the combination of anti-α1 and anti-α2 had effects similar to those of anti-α1 alone. Anti-β1 inhibited 55% of the binding to collagen type I and 80% of the binding to collagen type IV. Although the effect of anti-β1 was on average less than that of anti-α1, the difference was not significant. Anti-αv had no effect on binding to either type of collagen. From these results, and studies at both the mRNA and the protein levels, we conclude that expression of α2 integrin is negligible both in normal liver and in the setting of wound healing. For studies of contraction, stellate cells were isolated 6 days after bile duct ligation at which time they exhibit myofibroblast characteristics, attaching rapidly to collagen gels. Contraction was elicited by endothelin 1 (27Rockey D.C. Housset C.N. Friedman S.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 1795-1804Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 31Kawada N. Klein H. Decker K.

Invest. 1992; 90: 642-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar), and the decrease in lattice area was monitored in the presence or absence of blocking antibodies to α1, α2, or β1 integrin subunits. Base-line contraction (indicated as 100% contraction) was established in plates treated with non-immune IgG and exposed to endothelin 1 (Fig.4); the gel area was 40–50% that of non-contracted controls. Anti-α1 blocked contraction significantly. Unexpectedly, the effect of anti-α2 also was significant although less than that of anti-α1. Given together, anti-α1 and anti-α2 were additive, completely inhibiting contraction, and anti-β1 was similarly effective. Antibody to αv, which does not bind collagen, had no effect. When the morphology of cultures on collagen gels was examined, the effect of an individual antibody on cell processes correlated closely with its effect on contraction. Processes were numerous in control cultures or in cultures exposed to anti-αv (Fig.5, a and f). By contrast, in cultures exposed to anti-α1 or anti-α2 (Fig. 5,b and c), processes were reduced, and they were virtually eliminated in cultures containing both anti-α1 and anti-α2 or anti-β1 (Fig. 5, d and e). None of the antibodies altered cell attachment to the gel.Figure 5Effect of blocking antibody to α1, α2, or β1 integrin subunits on stellate cell morphology. Hepatic stellate cells isolated from livers 6 days after bile duct ligation were plated on top of collagen I gels in the absence or presence of specific monoclonal antibodies.

In the control and in cultures treated with anti-αv, numerous cell processes are present (arrows); these are reduced in the presence of either anti-α1 or anti-α2 and nearly abolished by the combination of anti-α1 and anti-α2 or by anti-β1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) A salient difference between these and the preceding experiments is the fact that the flow cytometry and collagen-binding studies were conducted with fresh isolates, whereas the contraction studies required a minimum period in culture (about 24 h) for attachment of the cells to the gel. Because phenotypic adaptation to culture is known to occur within this time frame (10Friedman S.L. N. Engl. J. Med. 1993; 328: 1828-1835Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar,11Bissell D.M. Guzelian P.S. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1980; 349: 85-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar), we evaluated α2 integrin mRNA expression early after cell plating. Cells from 6-day bile duct ligated liver were isolated and placed on collagen gels, and α1 and α2 mRNA were quantitated. As shown (Table I), α2 mRNA increased strikingly after just 24 h of culture, and synthesis of its protein was readily detected by immunoprecipitation after metabolic labeling. By contrast, α1 expression did not change either at the mRNA or protein level during 24 h of culture on collagen gels (Fig. 6). The rapid up-regulation of α2β1 in culture appears to explain its participation in contraction.Table IRegulation of α1 and α2 mRNA expression by activated stellate cells in culture for 24 hours on collagen gelsDensitometric unitsFold increase at 24 hFresh isolates24-h cultureα1 mRNA5982 ± 9075255 ± 5450.88α2 mRNA449 ± 613465 ± 15151-ap < 0.05 compared to fresh isolates.7.71Hepatic stellate cells were isolated from livers 6 days after bile-duct ligation.

In solution, the interaction of human CD2 with its ligand CD58 is of low affinity (500 mm−1) and the interaction of rat CD2 with its ligand CD48 is of still lower affinity (40 mm−1). At the molecular level, however, the two systems are likely to be topologically identical. Fluorescently labeled glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored CD48 and CD58 were prepared and incorporated into supported phospholipid bilayers, in which the ligands were capable of free lateral diffusion. Quantitative fluorescence imaging was used to study the binding of cell surface human and rat CD2 molecules to the fluorescent ligands in contact areas between Jurkat cells and the bilayers. These studies provide two major conclusions. First, CD2/ligand interactions cooperate to align membranes with nanometer precision leading to a physiologically effective two-dimensional affinity. This process does not require the intact cytoplasmic tail of CD2. Second, the degree of membrane alignment that can be achieved by topologically similar receptors deteriorates with decreasing affinity. This suggests an affinity limit for the ability of this mode of cooperativity to achieve stable cell-cell adhesion at approximately 10 mm−1.

This suggests an affinity limit for the ability of this mode of cooperativity to achieve stable cell-cell adhesion at approximately 10 mm−1. Many biologically important events are initiated and sustained through low affinity binding interactions in cell-cell and cell-matrix contact areas. Several models suggest that active intracellular mechanisms are engaged to assist these low affinity interactions (1Ward M.D. Dembo M. Hammer D.A. Biophys. J. 1994; 67: 2522-2534Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 2Burridge K. Fath K. Kelly T. Nuckolls G. Turner C. Annu. Rev.

This intracellular regulation can occur through the cytoplasmic domains of the adhesion molecules as in integrins and cadherins (4Nagafuchi A. Takeichi M. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 3679-3684Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar, 5Hibbs M.L. Xu H. Stacker S.A. Springer T.A.

Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 1047-1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar). Other models hypothesize that the ectodomains of low affinity adhesion molecules can oligomerize to produce stable arrays that enhance the intrinsic affinity of the ectodomain interaction (7Shapiro L. Fannon A.M. Kwong P.D. Thompson A. Lehman M.S. Grübel G. Legrand J.F. Als-Nielsen J. Colman D.R. Hendrickson W.A. Nature. 1995; 374: 327-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (974) Google Scholar, 8Shapiro L.

Today. 1995; 16: 581-587Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Testing of these models has been limited by the absence of quantitative affinity measurements in contact areas. The fluid mosaic membrane can be viewed as a nearly two-dimensional solution in which diffusion is constrained to the plane of the membrane, with a small third dimension arising from the flexible tethering of the membrane anchored adhesion molecules (10Singer S.J. Nicolson G.L. Science. 1972; 175: 720-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (6089) Google Scholar). The contact area between two apposing membranes may have additional depth in the third dimension due to fluctuations in the distance between the two membranes. The thesis of this study is that low affinity adhesion interactions can succeed in forming many bonds between cells by organizing the two apposing membranes so that the depth of the third dimension is small and optimal for the relevant adhesion molecule pair. When the third dimension is minimized by this cooperativity, the adhesion molecule concentration is increased and bond formation is strongly favored. In this study, we tested this hypothesis using the human and rat CD2 adhesion systems. CD2 is an adhesion molecule expressed primarily on T lymphocytes in human, rat and other mammalian species. In all species, CD2 is a type I transmembrane protein with two immunoglobulin-like domains and a 115–116-amino acid cytoplasmic tail. The most potent ligand in the human system is CD58 (11van der Merwe P.A. Barclay A.N. Mason D.W. Davies E.A. Morgan B.P. Tone M. Krishnam A.K.C. Ianelli C. Davis S.J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10149-10160Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 12Sandrin M.S. Mouhtouris E. Vaughan H.A. Warren H.S. Parish C.R. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 4606-4613PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, CD48 is the CD2 ligand in rats and mice (13Davis S.J. van der Merwe P.A. Immunol. Today. 1996; 17: 177-187Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). The CD2 cytoplasmic domain is highly conserved, suggesting that rat CD2 would recognize the appropriate cytoplasmic factors in human cells (14Melton E. Sarner N. Torkar M. van der Merwe P.A. Russell J.Q. Budd R.C. Mamlaki C. Tolaini M. Kioussis D. Zamoyska R. Eur. J. Immunol. 1996; 26: 2952-2963Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The solution affinity of human CD2 for human CD58 is 500 mm−1 at 25 °C, while the affinity of rat CD2 for rat CD48 is 40 mm−1 at 25 °C (this study). CD58 and CD48 are structurally very similar; both are glycolipid-anchored molecules with two Ig-like domains and six and five sites of N-linked glycosylation, respectively. Rat CD2 has been transfected into human Jurkat T lymphoma cells (15He Q. Beyers A.D. Barclay A.N. Williams A.F. Cell. 1988; 54: 979-984Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), such that rat and human CD2 can be compared in the same cellular background. We have previously described a method for determining the number of molecular bonds formed between T cells expressing CD2 and glass-supported planar bilayers bearing laterally mobile, fluorescein-labeled CD58 (16Dustin M.L. Ferguson L.M. Chan P.Y. Springer T.A. Golan D.E. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 465-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). The binding of CD58 by T cell CD2 is visualized as an accumulation of fluorescence in the contact area. CD2/CD58 binding is dynamic in that the CD58 molecules in the contact area turn over completely every 5–10 min (17Dustin M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15782-15788Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In this study, human Jurkat T cells were used in the native state for studies with human CD2, or were transfected with rat CD2. Bond formation was determined over a wide range of CD58 (human) and CD48 (rat) ligand densities. A recently developed method was used to determine the two-dimensional dissociation constants (2DK d 1The abbreviations used are: 2DK d , two-dimensional dissociation constant; 3DK d , three-dimensional dissociation constant; CD, cluster of differentiation; DIC, differential interference contrast; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; FL, fluorescence units; FPR, fluorescence photobleaching recovery; IRM, interference reflection microscopy; LFA, lymphocyte function-associated antigen; NBD, 7-nitro-2–1,3-benzoxadiazol-4-yl; SPR, surface plasmon resonance; TCR, T cell receptor; WT, wild type. 1The abbreviations used are: 2DK d , two-dimensional dissociation constant; 3DK d , three-dimensional dissociation constant; CD, cluster of differentiation; DIC, differential interference contrast; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; FL, fluorescence units; FPR, fluorescence photobleaching recovery; IRM, interference reflection microscopy; LFA, lymphocyte function-associated antigen; NBD, 7-nitro-2–1,3-benzoxadiazol-4-yl; SPR, surface plasmon resonance; TCR, T cell receptor; WT, wild type.values) for the CD2/ligand interactions. 2D.-M. Zhu, M. L. Dustin, and D. E. Golan, manuscript in preparation. 2D.-M. Zhu, M. L. Dustin, and D. E. Golan, manuscript in preparation. We found that the 2D K d for interaction of human CD2 with CD58 is 43-fold lower than the 2D K d for interaction of rat CD2 with CD48. Deletion of the cytoplasmic tail of rat CD2 did not substantially alter the 2D K d or the efficiency of adhesion. The calculated confinement regions for human CD2/CD58 and rat CD2/CD48 were 3.9–5.5 nm and 15 nm, respectively. The confinement region is a measure of membrane alignment: the smaller the confinement region, the more precisely aligned the apposing membranes. These results strongly support the hypothesis that alignment of apposing membranes by the cooperative activity of CD2/ligand bonds is responsible for the efficiency of CD2/ligand-mediated adhesive interactions in contact areas. The decrease in alignment with decreasing affinity suggests a limit for this mode of cooperativity, and may define an affinity threshold beyond which specific oligomerization or cytoskeletal regulation strategies are required to enhance binding. Jurkat cells selected for the ability to produce interleukin-2 in response to T cell receptor (TCR) cross-linking were provided by A. Chan (Washington University, St. Louis, MO). Jurkat cells with low human CD2 expression and transfected with different rat CD2 forms have been described previously (15He Q. Beyers A.D. Barclay A.N. Williams A.F. Cell. 1988; 54: 979-984Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) were produced from hybridoma culture supernatants or from ascites produced in SCID mice. TS2/18 is specific for human CD2 (adhesion blocking) (18Sanchez-Madrid F. Krensky A.M. Ware C.F. Robbins E. Strominger J.L. Burakoff S.J. Springer T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Fab fragments of TS2/18 were generated by digestion with immobilized papain (21Parham P. Androlewicz M.J. Brodsky F.M. Holmes N.J. Ways J.P. J. Immunol. Methods. 1982; 53: 133-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Cells were incubated with 50 μg/ml mAbs and then with FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (FITC:IgG, 4:1). Cells were washed three times after each staining incubation with antibodies and analyzed on a FACScan (Becton Dickinson, Mountain View, CA). In some experiments adherent cells from planar bilayers were gently eluted by incubation with anti-CD2 mAb, washed, stained as above, and subjected to flow cytometry. Recombinant rat CD2 was coupled to the BIAcore (Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden) flow cell through random primary amines as described previously (22van der Merwe P.A. Brown M.H. Davis S.J. Barclay A.N. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4945-4954Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Unlabeled or FITC-labeled CD48 was injected at a flow rate of 20 μl/min for 6 s, and the SPR response was measured at 25 °C in flow cells with CD2 or a control coating. The specific increase in response units was determined by subtracting the response unit signal on the control surface. Binding data were analyzed as described previously to determine off-rates and K d values (22van der Merwe P.A. Brown M.H. Davis S.J. Barclay A.N. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4945-4954Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Rat CD48 was purified from rat thymuses on OX45-Sepharose (20van der Merwe P.A. McPherson D.C. Brown M.H. Barclay A.N. Cyster J.G. Williams A.F. Davis S.J. Eur. J. Immunol. 1993; 23: 1373-1377Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The CD48 was labeled with 8 mm FITC while bound to OX45-Sepharose and eluted at pH 3. Human CD58 was isolated from human erythrocytes on TS2/9-Sepharose (23Dustin M.L. Sanders M.E. Shaw S. Springer T.A. J. Exp. Med. 1987; 165: 677-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). The CD58 was labeled with 8 mm FITC while bound to TS2/9-Sepharose and eluted at pH 3. Residual free dye was removed from the protein samples after elution from the affinity columns by ultrafiltration over a M r 30,000 cut-off membrane (Centricon, Amicon, Danvers, CT). The labeled protein was analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, followed by fluorescence imaging on a Storm Imager (Molecular Dynamics, San Cupertino, CA). This allowed assessment of both protein purity and absence of free dye, which co-migrated with bromphenol blue. The solution K d , as analyzed by SPR, of FITC-labeled CD48 binding to rat CD2 (70 μm) was not significantly different from the solution K d for binding of unlabeled CD48 to CD2 (56 μm) (data not shown). These data are within the range of K d values determined previously for unlabeled CD48 binding to CD2 that had been immobilized on a sensor chip with a random orientation (22van der Merwe P.A. Brown M.H. Davis S.J. Barclay A.N. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4945-4954Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Thus, the adhesion molecule labeling procedure established originally for human CD58 was shown here to result in full retention of binding activity for rat CD48. Proteins were reconstituted with 0.4 mm egg phosphatidylcholine by detergent dialysis (24Mimms L.T. Zampighi G. Nozaki Y. Tanford C. Reynolds J.A. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 833-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar). Liposome suspensions were also prepared without added protein (0.4 mm egg phosphatidylcholine only) or with 2 mol% 7-nitro-2–1,3-benzoxadiazol-4-yl (NBD) phosphatidylethanolamine. The initial bilayer preparation contained 2200 molecules/μm2CD48 or 1600 molecules/μm2 CD58 assayed by immunoradiometric methods using iodinated OX45 IgG or TS2/9 IgG, respectively. Dilution of the initial liposome preparation with egg phosphatidylcholine liposomes resulted in a range of FITC-CD48 or FITC-CD58 surface densities that was linear with the dilution factor (data not shown). The fluorescence signal from these bilayers under a standard set of conditions was also linear with surface density, allowing determination of a specific activity in fluorescence (FL) units/molecule (see Table I).Table IDefinitions of terms and methods of measurementSymbolDefinitionMeasurementN tTotal number of CD2 molecules per cell, averaged over a population of cellsIodinated IgG or Fab bindingN bTotal number of bound ligand molecules (molecules/contact)B × S b (see below)BBound ligand density (molecules/μm2)(FLcontact − FLbilayer − FLautofluor) ÷ specific activity (FL/molecule)FFree ligand density (molecules/μm2)FLbilayer ÷ specific activity (FL/molecule)S cSurface area of cell (μm2)4πr 2, where r is the radius of osmotically swelled cellsS bSize of contact area (μm2)Interference reflection microscopy (IRM)pS b ÷S cnTotal number of cells analyzed per bilayerCInitial ligand density (molecules/μm2)Immunoradiometric assay on bilayer of known areafFractional mobilityFPRΠCPercentage of cells bound at initial ligand densityCComparison between IRM (total contacts) and DIC (total cells) imagesςConfinement region (nm)(2DK d ÷ 3D K d ) × 1000 Open table in a new tab Planar bilayers were prepared in a parallel plate flow cell (Bioptechs, Butler, PA). Up to five bilayers could be prepared in one flow cell by sandwiching 1-μl aliquots of liposome suspension between the micro-aqueduct slide and a clean no. 1 coverslip (40 mm diameter). The coverslip and micro-aqueduct slide were separated by a 250-μm silicon rubber gasket such that each bilayer was about 2 mm across. The flow cell was flushed with 5% nonfat dry milk in phosphate-buffered saline and incubated with this solution for at least 20 min at 24 °C. The medium for adhesion assays was Hepes-buffered saline (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 137 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 0.7 mmNaHPO4, 5 mmd-glucose, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 1% bovine serum albumin). In some experiments 1% bovine serum albumin was replaced by 10% fetal bovine serum. Adhesion assays were performed at 24 °C, at which temperature the CD2 adhesion mechanism functioned efficiently. Images of bilayers, cell, and contact areas were acquired using an inverted microscope (Yona Microscopes, Silver Spring, MD). Stable epi-fluorescence illumination was provided by a xenon arc lamp (Opti-Quip, Highland Mills, NY). Images were acquired with a cooled CCD camera (PXL, KAF1400 chip, Photometrics, Tuscon, AZ). The system was interfaced with a computer (Apple, Cupertino, CA) running IP lab software (Signal Analytics, Vienna, VA). Contact areas were directly visualized by interference-reflection microscopy (25Izzard C.S. Lochner L. J. Cell Sci. 1976; 21: 129-159Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All images were flat-field corrected using averaged images of NBD-phosphatidylethanolamine (2%) bilayers. Images of cells on unlabeled bilayers were always acquired in parallel to allow correction for cell and media autofluorescence. The two-dimensional affinity analysis required that the average number of CD2 molecules per cell (N t, see Table I for other symbols) was constant over all data points, although at low ligand density the cells with higher cell surface expression of CD2 were selectively bound (see “Results”). The normalization assumed that, when the percentage of cells adhering to a substrate was less than 100%, that the cells with the highest expression of CD2 adhere first. This assumption is consistent with the law of mass action and with data provided under “Results.” Normalization therefore required direct determination of the percentage of cells bound at each bilayer density (ΠC). Values ofN b, B × p, andB/F for each contact area at a given initial ligand density were arranged in columns and sorted for decreasingN b. The highest (ΠC(low) ÷ ΠC) × n values were averaged and used to generate a Zhu-Golan plot (see “Results”). The average surface area of the Jurkat cells used in this study was 800 μm2, based either on the diameter of osmotically swelled cells (average diameter, 16 ± 3.3 μm, n = 86) or on the diameter of cells in isotonic medium (average diameter, 11.4 ± 1.8 μm, n = 25) multiplied by 1.8, a correction factor for the surface roughness of activated T cells (26Mege J.L. Capo C. Benoliel A.M. Foa C. Galindo R. Bongrand P. J. Theor. Biol. 1986; 119: 147-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). For osmotic swelling, the Jurkat cells were resuspended in Hepes-buffered saline diluted 1:9 with water. After 15 min all cells appeared “swelled” and were imaged by differential interference contrast microscopy (DIC); cell diameters were measured using IP Lab software. FPR experiments were performed as described previously (17Dustin M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15782-15788Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). A focused Gaussian beam from a 2W argon laser (Coherent, Palo Alto, CA) was merged with the xenon arc lamp illumination using a 50% beam splitter. Imaging and bleaching were controlled by an IP Lab script. Soluble human CD58 (sCD58) was purified from supernatants of Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells transfected with a construct encoding truncated, two-Ig domain sCD58 (27Miller G.T. Hochman P.S. Meier W. Tizard R. Bixler S.A. Rosa M.D. Wallner B.P. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 178: 211-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). The sCD58 was iodinated with IODOGEN using 1 mCi of 125I/mg of protein. Binding of iodinated sCD58 to Jurkat cells was performed in a 100-μl volume of Hepes-buffered saline/bovine serum albumin at 24 °C. After incubation for 5 min, 90 μl of the cell suspension was transferred to a microsediment tube (Sarstedt) containing 100 μl of oil (1.5 parts dibutylphthalate and 1 part dioctylphthalate). The tube was centrifuged for 3 min at 8000 rpm in a microcentrifuge. The tip containing the cell pellet was cut off using a heated scalpel, and both the tip and top parts of the tube were counted. Nonbound and nonspecifically bound counts in the tip were determined by performing the binding reaction in the presence of 100 μg/ml of TS2/18. The binding data were analyzed both by the method of Scatchard (28Scatchard G. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1949; 51: 660-672Crossref Scopus (17799) Google Scholar) and by using a nonlinear fitting routine (Regression, Blackwell Scientific Publications, Oxford, United Kingdom), with similar results. We set out to test the hypothesis that the CD2/ligand interaction aligns membranes, by using a chemical analysis of the CD2/ligand interaction in a model cell-cell contact area. The interaction of human CD2 with CD58 in T-lymphocyte-to-supported-planar-bilayer contact areas is an equilibrium binding process that follows the law of mass action and can thus be described by an affinity constant (16Dustin M.L. Ferguson L.M. Chan P.Y. Springer T.A. Golan D.E. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 465-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Because both CD2 and CD58 are tethered to membranes, their concentrations are measured in two-dimensional (surface) units and their interaction is described by a two-dimensional affinity or the reciprocal 2D K d . Previously we utilized the Scatchard analysis to fit CD2/CD58 binding data and determine the 2D K d , assuming that all cell surface CD2 molecules were available in the contact area (i.e. that the total number if receptors was a constant). However, it is more likely that the movement of laterally mobile CD2, like that of CD58, follows the law of mass action and, at equilibrium, will be distributed between the contact and noncontact areas of the cell membrane. Consistent with this postulate, human CD2 displays a high degree of lateral mobility on Jurkat cells, with a diffusion coefficient (D) of 0.072 μm2/s and a fractional mobility (f) of 0.7 (29Liu S.J. Hahn W.C. Bierer B.E. Golan D.E. Biophys. J. 1995; 68: 459-470Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). A novel analytical approach to determining the 2D K d was developed, using the assumption that the laterally mobile CD2 was available for binding to CD58. The derivation of this analysis will be described in detail elsewhere.2 The important conceptual feature of the analysis is that the free, laterally mobile CD2 is assumed to diffuse over the entire cell surface. Under these conditions, the following relationship should be satisfied. (B÷F)=[(Nt×f)÷(Kd×Sc)]−[(B×p)÷Kd]Equation 1 The terms in Equation 1 are defined in TableI. Graphical analysis of this relationship involved plotting B × p as the abscissa and B ÷ F as the ordinate for a well distributed series of data points at different ligand densities in the planar bilayer. The 2D K d was determined from the negative reciprocal of the slope. The total number of receptor molecules (N t) on the cell was calculated by the following relationship. Nt=(xintercept×Sc)÷fEquation 2 For brevity, we will refer to this graphical representation as a “Zhu-Golan plot.” This novel analysis required determination of the bound ligand density, the free ligand density, the size of the contact area, and the average surface area of the cell for several different initial ligand densities. The novel analysis method assumes that the ligand is freely mobile in the planar bilayer. We have demonstrated previously that FITC-CD58 is laterally mobile in glass-supported planar bilayers (16Dustin M.L. Ferguson L.M. Chan P.Y. Springer T.A. Golan D.E. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 465-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). The lateral mobility of FITC-CD48 was measured by FPR (17Dustin M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15782-15788Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 30Axelrod D. Koppel D.E. Schlessinger J. Elson E.L. Webb W.W. Biophys. J. 1976; 16: 1055-1069Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2030) Google Scholar). FITC-CD48 displayed the same fluorescence recovery profile as NBD-phosphatidylethanolamine (2%) in egg phosphatidylcholine bilayers (Fig. 1). The FITC-CD48 had a lateral diffusion coefficient of 1 μm2/s and a fractional recovery of greater than 90%. This result confirmed that glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored CD48 and a model phospholipid interacted identically with bulk lipids in the planar bilayer. The time course of adhesion mediated by the CD2/CD48 interaction was examined at 24 °C. Bilayers bearing 1500 molecules/μm2 FITC-CD48 were formed in a parallel plate flow cell. Jurkat T cells expressing rat CD2 were injected into the flow cell and settled on the bilayer. The time course of CD48 accumulation in the forming contact areas was followed by fluorescence imaging. Accumulation of bound CD48 increased for 15 min at 24 °C and reached a steady state level by 20 min (Fig.2). This time course was similar to that reported previously for adhesion mediated by human CD2/CD58 on Jurkat cells (16Dustin M.L. Ferguson L.M. Chan P.Y. Springer T.A. Golan D.E. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 465-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Both cell adhesion and ligand binding in contact areas were reversed within 10 min by addition of 100 μg/ml OX34 mAb against rat CD2 (data not shown). Jurkat cells lacking rat CD2 did not accumulate FITC-CD48 or adhere to FITC-CD48 bilayers (data not shown). A key part of the Zhu-Golan analysis is to determine ligand binding over a range of initial ligand densities. The human CD2/CD58 interaction was chosen to illustrate pictorially the multiparameter image collection used to generate these data. Fig.3 shows representative images of Jurkat T cell adhesion to bilayers containing densities of CD58 ranging from 13 to 200 molecules/μm2 at 24 °C. The images show pseudocolor representations of fluorescence images calibrated in molecules/μm2, and images of adherent and nonadherent cells and contact areas in the same field obtained using DIC and interference reflection microscopy (IRM), respectively. Several key features of the interaction are apparent. The percentage of cells forming contacts, the size of the contact area, and the amount of CD58 accumulated all increased with increasing initial density of CD58 in the bilayers. The images of cells on bilayers with no CD58 showed that autofluorescence was low but detectable and relatively uniform, allowing simple subtractive corrections for autofluorescence and bilayer fluorescence to determine the amount of ligand bound in the contact areas (see Table I). The accumulation of FITC-CD58 was rapidly reversed by addition of 100 μg/ml TS2/18 mAb against human CD2. This treatment also reversed contact formation based on IRM imaging. Thus, both the human and rat systems required the CD2/ligand interaction to achieve contact formation and ligand accumulation. To obtain a Zhu-Golan plot with well distributed points, it was necessary to utilize low ligand densities at which a small percentage of cells were adherent. A flow cytometry experiment was performed to determine whether the WT rCD2 cells that adhered selectively at low CD48 density expressed higher levels of CD2. WT rCD2 cells adherent to bilayers bearing 200 molecules/μm2 rat CD48 expressed, on average, a 2-fold higher level of CD2 than that expressed on cells adherent to bilayers bearing 1200 molecules/μm2 CD48 (Fig.4 A). These data demonstrated that the average amount of CD2 on a population of adherent cells increased as the percent of total cells that were adherent decreased. Because there was no ligand-based selection for cell size (Fig.4 B), the increased CD2 expression on cells adherent to low density CD48 bilayers reflected a concomitant increase in CD2 surface density. The analysis assumes that the average number of CD2 molecules per adherent cell is equal at all initial ligand densities. Therefore, the result above required that the data sets be normalized to a single level ofN t, based on the assumption that the cells with highest CD2 were preferentially adherent at low initial ligand densities. The effect of this normalization is demonstrated in Fig.5. Fig. 5 A shows frequency histograms of total CD48 bound per contact between WT rCD2 cells and four bilayers containing different initial"
https://openalex.org/W2156779372,"Nerve fiber elongation involves the input of lipids to the growing axons. Since cell bodies are often a great distance from the regenerating tips, alternative sources of lipids have been proposed. We previously demonstrated that axonal synthesis of phosphatidylcholine is required for axonal growth (Posse de Chaves, E., Vance, D. E., Campenot, R. B. and Vance, J. E. (1995) J. Cell Biol. 128, 913–918; Posse de Chaves, E., Vance, D. E., Campenot, R. B. and Vance, J. E. (1995) Biochem. J. 312, 411–417). In contrast, cholesterol is not made in axons. We now show that when compartmented cultures of rat sympathetic neurons are incubated with pravastatin, in the absence of exogenously supplied lipids, cholesterol synthesis is inhibited and axonal growth is impaired. The addition of cholesterol to the axons or cell bodies of neurons treated with this inhibitor restores normal axonal elongation. Similarly, a supply of cholesterol via lipoproteins restores normal axonal growth. In contrast, lipoproteins do not provide axons with sufficient phosphatidylcholine for normal elongation when axonal phosphatidylcholine synthesis is inhibited. Thus, our studies support the idea that during axonal regeneration lipoproteins can be taken up by axons from the microenvironment and supply sufficient cholesterol, but not phosphatidylcholine, for growth. We also show that neither apoE nor apoA-I within the lipoproteins is essential for axonal growth. Nerve fiber elongation involves the input of lipids to the growing axons. Since cell bodies are often a great distance from the regenerating tips, alternative sources of lipids have been proposed.

We also show that neither apoE nor apoA-I within the lipoproteins is essential for axonal growth. During nerve regeneration, large amounts of lipids are required for remyelination and expansion of axonal membranes. Synthesis of new myelin by Schwann cells in the regenerating peripheral nerve has been extensively studied (1Gould R.M. Holshek J. Silverman W. Spivack W. J. Neurochem. 1987; 48: 1121-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 2Ledeen R.W. Golly F. Haley J. Mol. Neurobiol. 1992; 6: 179-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 3Boiron F.

An interesting model for regeneration of injured peripheral nerve, involving apolipoprotein E (apoE) 1The abbreviations used are: apo, apolipoprotein; HDL, high density lipoprotein; LDL, low density lipoprotein; PtdCho, phosphatidylcholine; VLDL, very low density lipoprotein. and the coordinated storage and redistribution of cholesterol, has been proposed (5Mahley R.W. Science. 1988; 240: 622-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (3395) Google Scholar) and supported by experimental evidence (6Boyles J.K. Zoellner C.D. Anderson L.J. Kosic L.M. Pitas R.E. Weisgraber K.H.

After peripheral nerve injury, axon degeneration and myelin destruction proceed rapidly. The degenerating nerve is infiltrated by blood-derived macrophages that are responsible for clearing axonal and myelin debris (4Goodrum J.F. Earnhardt T. Goines S. Bouldin T.W. J.

Med. 1987; 165: 1218-1223Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that most of the cholesterol, and possibly other key lipids released by degenerating axons and myelin, accumulate within Schwann cells and macrophages that remain in the area of degeneration. The salvaged cholesterol appears to be reutilized by the regenerating myelin membranes (4Goodrum J.F. Earnhardt T. Goines S. Bouldin T.W. J.

However, direct evidence for the reutilization of cholesterol by axons has not been provided. After nerve injury, synthesis of several proteins is induced in the distal, but not the proximal, segment of the injured nerve (11Müller H.W. Ignatius M.J. Hangen D.H. Shooter E.M. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 393-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). One protein in particular, apoE, is produced by infiltrating macrophages and accumulates to levels 100–200-fold greater than in uninjured nerve (12Skene J.H.P. Shooter E.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

Posse de Chaves, unpublished results. It has been proposed that apoE, together with apoA-I, which enters the nerve from the circulation, play a central role in the reutilization of cholesterol (6Boyles J.K. Zoellner C.D. Anderson L.J. Kosic L.M. Pitas R.E. Weisgraber K.H. Hui D.Y. Mahley R.W. Gebicke-Harter P.J. Ignatius M.J. Shooter E.M. J. Clin.

Current evidence suggests that cholesterol from the cellular and myelin debris is first stored in endoneurial macrophages and is subsequently secreted by the macrophages to form cholesterol-rich, apoE/A-I-containing lipoproteins. When regeneration begins, the proximal stump of the nerve sends out numerous neurites. The tips of the neurites, as well as Schwann cells, express high levels of LDL receptors, which have been postulated to participate in uptake of these lipoproteins (6Boyles J.K. Zoellner C.D. Anderson L.J. Kosic L.M. Pitas R.E. Weisgraber K.H. Hui D.Y. Mahley R.W. Gebicke-Harter P.J. Ignatius M.J. Shooter E.M. J. Clin.

More recently, studies on mice lacking functional apoE, apoA-I, or both apoE and apoA-I genes revealed that neither apoE nor apoA-I is required for nerve regeneration in the peripheral nervous system (20Popko B. Goodrum J.F. Bouldin T.W. Zhang S.H. Maeda N. J. Neurochem. 1993; 60: 1155-1158Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 21Goodrum J.F. Bouldin T.W. Zhang S.H. Maeda N. Popko B. J. Neurochem. 1995; 64: 408-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). These data suggest that cholesterol reutilization by Schwann cells can occur in the absence of these apolipoproteins, favoring the idea that considerable redundancy is built into the lipoprotein-assisted process of cholesterol reutilization (20Popko B. Goodrum J.F. Bouldin T.W. Zhang S.H. Maeda N. J. Neurochem. 1993; 60: 1155-1158Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 21Goodrum J.F. Bouldin T.W. Zhang S.H. Maeda N. Popko B. J. Neurochem. 1995; 64: 408-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Although the assumption has been that lipoprotein-derived cholesterol is used for nerve regeneration, the use of cholesterol from this source for axonal growth has not been directly demonstrated. Moreover, the fate of other lipoprotein-derived lipids, such as phospholipids, in relation to axonal regeneration is unknown. The model proposed above for peripheral nerve regeneration by reutilization of exogenously supplied cholesterol departs from the generally accepted idea that nearly all membrane materials (i.e. proteins and lipids) required for axonal growth are synthesized in the cell bodies and transported by anterograde transport mechanisms into the axons, where these molecules are utilized for the assembly of new membranes (22Ledeen R.W. Eichberg J. Phospholipids in Nervous Tissues. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1985: 135-172Google Scholar, 23Alberts B. Bray D. Lewis J. Roberts Watson J.D. Molecular Biology of the Cell. 2nd Ed. Garland Press, New York1989: 1059-1136Google Scholar). It is now clear that axons of rat sympathetic neurons synthesize significant amounts of the major phospholipids (PtdCho, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylinositol, and sphingomyelin) as well as fatty acids (24Vance J.E. Pan D. Vance D.E. Campenot R.B. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 1061-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 25Vance J.E. Pan D. Campenot R.B. Bussière M. Vance D.E. J. Neurochem. 1994; 62: 329-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Of the total amount of PtdCho present in axons, at least 50% is made locally in the axons. Indeed, axonal synthesis of PtdCho is essential for normal axonal growth (26Posse de Chaves E. Vance D.E. Campenot R.B. Vance J.E. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 913-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In contrast, cholesterol synthesis does not occur in axons (25Vance J.E. Pan D. Campenot R.B. Bussière M. Vance D.E. J. Neurochem. 1994; 62: 329-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). In the present study, we demonstrate that lipoproteins can be used by axons of rat sympathetic neurons as a source of cholesterol, but not PtdCho, for axonal elongation. We also show that the presence of apoE and/or apoA-I within the lipoproteins is not essential for axonal growth. [1-14C]Acetic acid, sodium salt (specific activity 58 mCi/mmol) was purchased from Amersham Canada (Oakville, Ontario, Canada). Water-soluble cholesterol (methyl-β-cyclodextrin-cholesterol) was provided by Sigma. Pravastatin was a gift from Dr. Shinji Yokoyama (University of Alberta).

Mouse 2.5S nerve growth factor was obtained from Cedarlane Laboratories Ltd. (Hornby, Ontario, Canada). Rat serum was provided by the University of Alberta Laboratory Animal Services. Polyclonal antibodies directed against human apoB were purchased from Boehringer Mannheim (Germany). Polyclonal antibodies directed against rat apoE and apoA-I were generated in rabbits and characterized in our laboratories by standard procedures (27Rusiñol A. Verkade H. Vance J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3555-3562Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The reagents used for electrophoresis were supplied by Bio-Rad. Polyvinylidene difluoride membranes were from Millipore Corp. All other reagents were obtained from Sigma or Fisher. Procedures for growth of rat sympathetic neurons in compartmented cultures have been previously reported (28Campenot R.B. Walji A.H. Draker D.D. J. Neurosci. 1991; 11: 1126-1139Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Medium supplied to the compartment containing cell bodies (Fig. 1 a) was supplemented with 2.5% rat serum, 1 mg/ml ascorbic acid, 10 mm cytosine arabinoside, and 10 ng/ml nerve growth factor. Cytosine arabinoside was added to prevent the growth of nonneuronal cells, resulting in cultures that were purely neuronal in gross appearance. In all growth experiments, delipidated rat serum (29Yao Z. Vance D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 2998-3004Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was used. Medium supplied to the axon-containing compartments contained 100 ng/ml nerve growth factor. After 6 days, cytosine arabinoside treatment was discontinued, and nerve growth factor was confined to the axon-containing compartments (30Campenot R.B. Draker D.D. Neuron. 1989; 3: 733-743Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Culture medium was changed every 3–6 days. Cells were cultured for 14 days prior to the start of experiments. For center-plated cultures, the center compartment contained cell bodies with some proximal axons; the left and right compartments each contained growing distal axons without cell bodies (Fig. 1 b). Typically, the axons increased in length by ∼ 1 mm/day. In most experiments, as noted, cell bodies were plated in the left compartment, and the center and right compartments contained distal axons (Fig.1 c). When the neurons are plated in the left compartment, the center compartment is occupied by numerous distal axons that can be treated separately from cell bodies, and at the same time neurite elongation can be evaluated in the right compartment. One advantage of the three-compartment model for neuron culture is that metabolic events occurring in axons alone can be studied independently of those in cell bodies. This model is also applicable for studying axonal regeneration, since neurites can be mechanically removed from the side compartments and axonal extension can be accurately measured as neurites regenerate. Neurons were plated in the center compartment of compartmented dishes and cultured for 14 days. The radioactive cholesterol precursor [1-14C]acetic acid (10 μCi/ml) was added to the cell body-containing compartment. After incubation periods of 1 day and 2 days, the radioactive medium was removed, the cells were washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline, and cellular material was harvested by the addition of methanol/water (1:1, v/v) to the center and side compartments separately. The lipids were extracted by the addition of chloroform to a final chloroform/methanol/water ratio of 2:1:1 (v/v) (31Folch J. Lees M. Sloane-Stanley G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1959; 226: 497-509Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). The lipid samples were applied to thin layer chromatography plates, which were developed in the solvent system diisopropyl ether/acetic acid (96:4, v/v) using unlabeled cholesterol as carrier. The band corresponding to authentic cholesterol was scraped from the plate and radioactivity was measured. Radioactivity was normalized to total phospholipid mass measured in the same extract (32Chalvardjian A. Rudnicki E. Anal. Biochem. 1970; 36: 225-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). To evaluate the effect of pravastatin on the incorporation of [1-14C]acetic acid into cholesterol, neurons (14 days old) cultured in 24-well dishes were incubated with medium containing [1-14C]acetic acid in the presence or absence of 50 μm pravastatin. Pravastatin was dissolved in water to make a 10 mm stock solution, which was added to culture medium to give the desired final concentration of inhibitor. Extraction of lipids and isolation of cholesterol was performed as indicated for compartmented cultures. VLDL, LDL, and HDL were isolated from human plasma by sequential ultracentrifugation on a benchtop Beckman TL-100 ultracentrifuge as described by Brousseau et al. (33Brousseau T. Clavey V. Bard J.M. Fruchart J.C. Clin. Chem. 1993; 39: 960-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), which allows the separation to be completed in 1 day. HDL3 and HDL2 subfractions were further separated by heparin-Sepharose affinity chromatography (34Weisgraber K.H. Mahley R.W. J. Lipid Res. 1980; 21: 316-325Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The apolipoprotein content of the lipoprotein fractions was determined by sensitive Coomassie Blue staining (Sigma) and immunoblotting, using polyclonal antibodies directed against human apoB, rat apoE, and rat apoA-I. Proteins were separated by electrophoresis on 3–15% gradient polyacrylamide gels that contained 0.1% SDS and then transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes for 12 h at 50 V, and immunoblotting was performed as described previously (27Rusiñol A. Verkade H. Vance J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3555-3562Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For measurement of axonal extension, distal axons were mechanically removed from left and right compartments in the case of center-plated neurons, or from the right compartment for left-plated neurons, with a jet of sterile distilled water delivered with a syringe through a 22-gauge needle. The water was aspirated, and the wash was repeated twice followed by the addition of fresh culture medium. This procedure, termed axotomy, effectively removes all visible traces of axons from the side compartments. Neurite growth was measured as described previously (35Campenot R.B. Stevenson R.B. Gallin W.J. Paul D.L. Cell-Cell Interactions: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1992: 275-298Google Scholar). In previous studies using the compartment model for culture of neurons (25Vance J.E. Pan D. Campenot R.B. Bussière M. Vance D.E. J. Neurochem. 1994; 62: 329-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), we detected no cholesterol biosynthesis, as measured by incorporation of [1-14C]acetic acid into cholesterol, in axons of rat sympathetic neurons. We have now shown that under normal culture conditions cholesterol is synthesized in the cell body-containing compartment and efficiently transported into the distal axons. Rat sympathetic neurons (14 days old), cultured in three-compartment dishes, were incubated with [14C]acetate in the cell body-containing compartment alone. Radiolabeled cholesterol was isolated from the cell body-containing compartment and also from the left and right distal axon-containing compartments after time intervals of 1–3.5 days, and radioactivity was measured. Since the amount of neuronal material was small, we were unable to measure the mass of cholesterol. Instead, in this and other experiments, we related the radioactivity in cholesterol to the mass of cellular phospholipids. Fig.2 shows that [1-14C]acetate had been efficiently incorporated into cholesterol in the cell body-containing compartment by 24 h, and some radiolabeled cholesterol had been transported into the distal axons. After 3.5 days, the amount of radiolabeled cholesterol in the distal axons corresponded to approximately 50% of total neuronal [14C]cholesterol present, and newly synthesized cholesterol had equilibrated throughout all compartments. This experiment implies that under these culture conditions cholesterol utilized for axonal membrane biosynthesis is derived from synthesis in the cell bodies, since no external source of cholesterol was provided to the axons. We next determined if inhibition of cholesterol synthesis would inhibit axonal growth. Since in several cell types cholesterol synthesis is reduced by inhibitors of the rate-limiting enzyme of cholesterol biosynthesis, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase (36Tsujita Y. Kuroda M. Shimada Y. Tanzawa K. Arai M. Kaneko I. Tamaka M. Masuda H. Tamuri C. Watanabe Y. Fujii S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 877: 50-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar, 37Nakaya N. Homma Y. Tamachi H. Goto Y. Atherosclerosis. 1986; 61: 125-128Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), we examined the effect of one of these inhibitors, pravastatin, on cholesterol synthesis in rat sympathetic neurons. Neurons cultured in 24-well dishes for 14 days were incubated with [1-14C]acetate in the presence or absence of 50 μm pravastatin. Fig. 3shows that pravastatin had reduced the incorporation of [14C]acetate into cholesterol by approximately 83% at 24 h, demonstrating that cholesterol synthesis is inhibited by pravastatin in rat sympathetic neurons. The response of neurite growth to the presence of pravastatin and the corresponding reduction of cholesterol biosynthesis was investigated. Neurons were plated in the center compartment of compartmented culture dishes for 14 days. Distal axons were removed from the side compartments by axotomy, and the neurons were subsequently incubated with 50 μm pravastatin in either the center, cell body-containing compartment or the distal, axon-containing compartments. Axon extension was measured every day for the next 3.7 days (Fig. 4). Cultures that had been given pravastatin in the cell body-containing compartment alone had essentially stopped growing after 2.7 days. At all time points, axonal extension of pravastatin-treated neurons was statistically different from that of untreated neurons (p ≤ 0.008). As expected, since cholesterol synthesis is restricted to cell bodies, axons of cultures to which pravastatin had been added to the distal axon-containing compartments alone continued to elongate at the same rate as cells grown in the absence of pravastatin during the 3.7-day treatment period (Fig. 4). The effect of pravastatin on axonal growth was specifically related to the inhibition of cholesterol synthesis at the level of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase, since the addition of mevalonic acid, the product of the reaction catalyzed by 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase, reversed the effect of pravastatin on axonal growth in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 5). When mevalonic acid was added in the absence of pravastatin, axon growth was the same as in untreated cells (data not shown).Figure 5Mevalonic acid reverses the effect of pravastatin on axonal growth. Neurons (14 days old) were cultured as indicated in the legend to Fig. 4. Axons in the side compartments were axotomized, and medium containing either pravastatin (50 μm) alone or the indicated concentrations of mevalonic acid (100–500 μm) with pravastatin was given to the cell body-containing compartment (CB). Control cultures were given medium lacking both pravastatin and mevalonic acid. Axonal extension was measured 3 days after axotomy. Results are means ± S.E. of measurements from 60–64 tracks for each treatment. The experiment was repeated twice with similar results. Theasterisk signifies the statistical difference between cultures treated with pravastatin in the presence or absence of mevalonic acid (p < 0.01).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We conclude from these experiments that active cholesterol synthesis is required for normal axonal elongation of cultured rat sympathetic neurons and that synthesis of cholesterol in cell bodies supplies sufficient cholesterol for normal axonal extension. Since in most cases in animals the tips of regenerating axons are localized at distances greatly removed from the cell bodies, cholesterol transport from the cell bodies to the regenerating sprout may not be the sole source of axonal cholesterol. An alternative scenario is that axons would “recycle” cholesterol salvaged from degeneration of both myelin and axons. We therefore investigated the ability of axons to utilize exogenous sources of cholesterol for elongation. Sympathetic neurons were plated in the left compartment of the three-compartment dishes (Fig. 1 c) and allowed to grow for 14 days. Distal axons were removed from the right compartment, and the axons were allowed to regenerate under the following conditions. Incubation of neurons with pravastatin in the left, cell body-containing compartment impaired axonal extension, in agreement with the data shown in Figs. 4 and 5. Incubation of neurons with pravastatin and water-soluble cholesterol (cholesterol incorporated into β-cyclodextrin) in the cell body-containing compartment, or with pravastatin in the cell body-containing compartment and cholesterol in the axon-containing compartments (center and right compartments), allowed normal axonal growth (Fig.6). (All values were not statistically different from controls at p < 0.1). Cultures incubated without pravastatin in all three compartments were used as controls (Fig. 6). This experiment demonstrates that sympathetic neurons can use exogenous cholesterol added to either cell bodies or axons for axonal membrane biogenesis. Cholesterol is normally delivered from the circulation to cells in the form of lipoproteins. The presence of lipoproteins has been demonstrated in the vicinity of regenerating and remyelinating nerves; however, no lipoprotein particles have been identified in noninjured nerves (6Boyles J.K. Zoellner C.D. Anderson L.J. Kosic L.M. Pitas R.E. Weisgraber K.H. Hui D.Y. Mahley R.W. Gebicke-Harter P.J. Ignatius M.J. Shooter E.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1989; 83: 1015-1031Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). These lipoproteins contain apoE and apoA-I as the major or exclusive apolipoproteins. We investigated the ability of lipoproteins to provide cholesterol for axonal growth. Three different preparations of human plasma lipoproteins were used as sources of cholesterol for axonal regeneration of cultured sympathetic neurons: LDL containing apoB; HDL2 containing apoE, apoA-I, and apoA-II; and HDL3 with apoA-I and apoA-II but with no apoE. The apoprotein content of the lipoproteins was verified by immunoblotting with anti-apoB, anti-apoA-I, and anti-apoE antibodies (data not shown). Sympathetic neurons were plated in the left compartment and allowed to grow for 14 days. At that time, the cells were axotomized, and cholesterol synthesis was inhibited by the addition of pravastatin to the cell body-containing compartment. To some cultures, lipoproteins were supplied to the distal axon-containing compartments alone, whereas to other cultures lipoproteins were added to only the cell body-containing compartment. The concentration of lipoproteins was normalized in terms of total cholesterol (100 μg/ml of medium). A few cultures were given cholesterol (100 μg/ml medium) for comparison. Axonal extension was measured after 4.2 days. In pravastatin-treated cultures, axonal extension was 54% less than in untreated cultures (Fig. 7). Cholesterol and all of the lipoproteins, when added to the distal axon-containing compartments, were able to overcome pravastatin inhibition of axonal elongation (Fig. 7), even LDL that lacked apoE and apoA-I. However, when given to the cell body-containing compartment alone (Fig. 7), only LDL, but not HDL2 or HDL3, was as effective as cholesterol in restoring neurite growth. This experiment indicates that cholesterol supplied to the regenerating axons via exogenous delivery of lipoproteins satisfies the cholesterol requirement for axonal extension. Since HDL3 contains no apoE and LDL contains neither apoA-I nor apoE, we conclude that neither apoE nor apoA-I is required for delivery of lipoprotein cholesterol for growth of distal axons. Since lipoproteins contain not only cholesterol but also phospholipids, we tested the hypothesis that lipoproteins can provide PtdCho for axonal growth. We have previously shown that when axonal PtdCho synthesis is inhibited by incubation of distal axons with choline-deficient medium (26Posse de Chaves E. Vance D.E. Campenot R.B. Vance J.E. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 913-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) or with alkylphosphocholines (38Posse de Chaves E. Vance D.E. Campenot R.B. Vance J.E. Biochem. J. 1995; 312: 411-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), neurite growth is strongly impaired. Axonal growth is also inhibited during global choline deficiency. However, decreased PtdCho synthesis in the cell bodies does not inhibit axon extension (26Posse de Chaves E. Vance D.E. Campenot R.B. Vance J.E. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 913-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). From these experiments, we concluded that PtdCho synthesis in distal axons, but not cell bodies, is required for normal axonal growth. Neurons plated in the left compartment of three-compartment dishes were incubated with medium lacking choline in all three compartments for 3 days (preincubation). The axons in the right compartment were then axotomized and allowed to regenerate in the presence or absence of choline or PtdCho-containing lipoproteins. Axonal extension was measured every day for 5 days (Fig. 8). In c"

Ras plays a pivotal role in the signaling cascade that governs chemotaxis of fibroblasts toward platelet-derived growth factor-BB (PDGF-BB). Ras activates multiple downstream pathways, which include the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), Rac, and Ral signaling cascades. We therefore investigated the role of the Rac and ERK pathways in cell migration. We showed that migration of fibroblasts toward PDGF-BB is inhibited by expression of dominant negative Asn-17 Rac1. Blocking of the ERK pathway by either expression of dominant negative Ala-218/Ala-222-mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (A218/A222-MEK1) or by a MEK-specific inhibitor did not inhibit migration toward PDGF-BB. In contrast, migration toward soluble fibronectin was suppressed by inhibition of the ERK pathway but not by Asn-17 Rac1 expression. These results indicate that directed cell migration mediated by different receptor classes in response to different ligands differentially utilizes the Rac and ERK pathways and suggest that Rac might play a critical role in pathological processes such as angiogenesis and metastasis.

Directed cell migration or chemotaxis is a critical feature of several physiological and pathological processes, including development, wound healing, atherosclerosis, immunity, angiogenesis, and metastasis (1Bornfeldt K.E.

Chemotaxis involves the sensing of a concentration gradient of chemoattractant, reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton, and subsequent movement toward the chemoattractant. Cytokine-induced reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton is mediated by members of the Rho family of GTP-binding proteins. Rho regulates stress fiber assembly, Rac controls lamellipodia formation, and Cdc42 directs the dynamics of filipodia (5Ridley A.J. Paterson H.F. Johnston C.L. Diekman D. Hall A.

However, the pathways downstream of Ras that control cell motility remain unknown. Ras activates several distinct effector pathways, including the ERK cascade, the pathway controlled by Rac, and the pathway initiated by RalGDS, the guanine nucleotide dissociation stimulator for RalA and -B, which are close relatives of Ras (10White M.A. Nicolette C.

A possible role for Rac in directed migration is also suggested by observations showing that Ras- and growth factor-induced activation of Rac are mediated by phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (17Rodriguez-Viciana P.

In this study, therefore, we investigated the role of Rac in different types of cell migration: directed migration toward PDGF-BB and soluble fibronectin and random migration stimulated by lysophosphatidic acid (LPA). Derivatization, properties, and growth conditions of Asn-17 Rac1 (N17-Rac1)-expressing Rat1 fibroblasts have been previously described (12Qiu R.-G. Chen J. Kirn D. McCormick F. Symons M. Nature. 1995; 374: 457-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (814) Google Scholar). ERK activation by 2.5 ng/ml PDGF-BB or 1 μg/ml LPA in these mutant Rac1-expressing lines is similar to that of control cells, indicating that the changes in cell migration stimulated by PDGF-BB and LPA are not a consequence of changes in expression level of the PDGF-β and LPA receptors. For the establishment of A218/A222-MEK1-expressing lines, Glu-tagged full-length A218/A222-MEK1 (kindly provided by S. Macdonald and E. Porfiri, ONYX) was subcloned as a BamHI–NotI fragment into the expression plasmid pAUCT. This is a pBR-based vector that contains the neomycin resistance gene under the control of the thymidine kinase promoter, the Tet repressor-VP16 fusion cDNA under the control of the cytomegalovirus promoter, and the Tet operator driving the expression of the gene of interest (kindly provided by A. Fattaey, ONYX). Rat 1 fibroblast lines expressing A218/A222-MEK1 or the pAUCT vector control were established after DNA transfection by selecting G418-resistant clones growing in the presence of tetracycline to maintain the expression of recombinant MEK1 mutant at low levels. Clones were maintained in high glucose (4.5 g/liter) Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, 100 units of penicillin, and 2 μg/ml streptomycin, 400 μg/ml G418, and 2 μg/ml tetracycline and kept at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Prior to experimental analysis, induction of recombinant Rac and MEK mutants was achieved by removing tetracycline for 24 h. Expression levels of the Myc-tagged Rac mutants were obtained by immunoblotting using the 9E10 monoclonal antibody as in Ref. 23Qiu R.-G. Abo A. McCormick F. Symons M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3449-3458Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar. Expression levels of the Glu-Glu-tagged MEK1 mutant were determined using an anti-Glu-Glu monoclonal antibody (24Grussenmeyer T. Scheidtmann K.E.K.H. Hutchinson M.A. Walter G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 7952Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). A218/A222-MEK1 expression was induced by removal of tetracycline for 24 h. Subsequently, cells were starved from serum for 18 h and induced with 10 nm epidermal growth factor for various periods of time. Cells were lysed in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 137 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 1 mm Pefabloc, 20 μm leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 50 mm NaF. Cleared lysates were incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with anti-ERK1 E1.2 crude serum and protein A-Sepharose. The beads were washed twice with lysis buffer and once with kinase buffer (30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 20 mm MgCl2, and 2 mmMnCl2). The kinase reaction was initiated by adding 30 μl of kinase buffer (10 μm cold ATP, 2.5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, and 7 μg of myelin basic protein) to the beads. After incubation for 30 min at 30 °C, reactions were stopped by adding sample buffer. Phosphorylated myelin basic protein was resolved on 14% SDS-PAGE and revealed by autoradiography. Cell migration through collagen-coated filters was assayed as described previously (9Kundra V. Anand-Apte B. Feig L.A. Zetter B.R. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 725-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Cell binding to the collagen-coated filters of the various lines and control cells was determined at various times after incubation in the chemotaxis chamber. Nonadherent cells were washed off with phosphate-buffered saline, and adherent cells were counted under the microscope. Statistical analysis (two sample t test) was performed on the values for stimulated migration corrected for background migration (in the absence of stimulus). Serum-starved cells were transferred to bicarbonate-free medium and mounted in a homemade observation chamber. Cell behavior was followed by means of video time lapse microscopy. Video frames were collected every 10 s with a Hamamatsu C2400 camera mounted on a Zeiss Axiovert 100TV inverted microscope provided with a × 40 Plan-NeoFluor NA 0.75 objective. Images were stored on a Panasonic TQ 2028F optical memory disk recorder. The number of ruffles per cell larger than 10 μm was determined at 2-min time intervals. To investigate the function of Rac in cell migration, we employed Rat1 fibroblast lines expressing N17-Rac1 (12Qiu R.-G. Chen J. Kirn D. McCormick F. Symons M. Nature. 1995; 374: 457-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (814) Google Scholar). We first characterized the migratory response of control Rat1 fibroblasts toward PDGF-BB, using a multiwell Boyden chamber assay (25Boyden S.J. J. Exp. Med. 1962; 115: 453-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (2049) Google Scholar). This assay measures the movement of cells across a porous membrane in response to a concentration gradient of a chemoattractant and has been shown previously to provide quantitative measurement of lymphocyte, endothelial cell, and tumor cell motility in response to a variety of physiological effectors. Control vector-transfected cells showed optimal migration toward a gradient generated by concentrations of 2.5–5 ng/ml PDGF-BB in the bottom well. Checkerboard analysis in which the amount of attractant was varied in both the top and bottom wells of the Boyden chamber indicated that the Rat1 fibroblasts display predominantly directional motility (chemotaxis) toward a PDGF-BB gradient, with a minor component attributed to an increase in random motility (data not shown). Relative to vector control cells, the three independent clones of Rat1 fibroblasts expressing N17-Rac1 tested were strongly inhibited in their migration toward PDGF-BB (p< 0.0005), whereas their basal unstimulated motility was not altered (Fig. 1 a). These results indicate that Rac is a key element in the signaling pathway involved in directional migration induced by PDGF-BB. Basal cell movement, in contrast, does not depend on Rac. To further study the role of Rac in the regulation of cell motility, we investigated the response of the lines expressing mutant Rac proteins to LPA, a ligand that activates a G protein-coupled receptor (26Moolenaar W.H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 203-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Checkerboard analysis demonstrated that LPA stimulates random, nondirectional migration (chemokinesis) in contrast to PDGF-BB, which stimulates directed cell migration. Here again, Rat1 fibroblasts expressing N17-Rac1 showed a strong reduction in LPA-stimulated migration (p < 0.0005) (Fig. 1 b), indicating that Rac also plays an essential role in a signaling pathway utilized by LPA to control cell motility. Together with the previous data, these results also indicate that both random and directed stimulated cell motility are Rac-dependent and that motility signaling pathways triggered by tyrosine kinase and G protein-coupled receptors both employ Rac as a mediator. To test whether the Rac pathway controls cell locomotion stimulated by other factors, we studied directed migration toward soluble fibronectin (FN), an integrin-mediated response. We previously showed that FN-stimulated migration is independent of Ras activity (9Kundra V. Anand-Apte B. Feig L.A. Zetter B.R. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 725-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). At this moment it is not clear, however, whether migration toward soluble FN is chemotactic or haptotactic (migration guided by a gradient of increasing substrate adhesiveness). Migration toward FN was not significantly inhibited by expression of N17-Rac (Fig. 1 c). This indicates that, in contrast to motility stimulated by the growth factors PDGF-BB and LPA, Rac activity is not essential for migration toward fibronectin. These observations also further differentiate the motility pathway stimulated by fibronectin from those activated by the growth factors PDGF and LPA. In addition to activating Rac, Ras also stimulates the ERK pathway, which is required for cell proliferation and transformation (11Cowley S. Paterson H. Kemp P. Marshall C.J. Cell. 1994; 77: 841-852Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1857) Google Scholar). The potential role of the ERK cascade in the regulation of cell motility is not yet clear, however. To study whether activation of the ERK pathway is necessary for cell migration, we used Rat1 fibroblast lines expressing dominant-negative A218/A222-MEK1 (11Cowley S. Paterson H. Kemp P. Marshall C.J. Cell. 1994; 77: 841-852Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1857) Google Scholar) from a tetracycline-repressible promotor (27Gossen M. Bujard H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5547-5551Crossref PubMed Scopus (4291) Google Scholar). Although these lines showed greatly diminished ERK activation in response to growth factors (up to 90% inhibition of ERK activation for the line shown in Fig. 2), migration toward PDGF-BB was unaltered (Fig. 2 a). In addition, although LPA stimulates ERK activity in a Ras-dependent fashion (28Cook S.J. Rubinfeld B. Albert I. McCormick F. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3475-3485Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar), A218/A222-MEK1 expressing lines did not show any inhibition in LPA-stimulated motility (Fig.2 b). Thus, Rac controls PDGF- and LPA-stimulated motility independently of the ERK pathway. In contrast to the above results, A218/A222-MEK1-expressing lines were significantly inhibited in migration toward soluble fibronectin (p < 0.0005) (Fig. 2 c). The inhibition of fibronectin-stimulated migration was not caused by decreased adhesion of the A218/A222-MEK1-expressing lines to the filter separating the two chambers. Indeed, adhesion to the Boyden chamber collagen-coated filter of all of the cell lines used in this study (including the lines expressing the various Rac mutants) was indistinguishable from those of controls, and adhesion was independent of the presence of growth factors or soluble fibronectin in the bottom chamber (data not shown). We further tested the role of the ERK pathway in cell migration using PD98059, a MEK-specific inhibitor (29Pang L. Sawada T. Decker S.J. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13585-13588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (897) Google Scholar), to block MEK activation. PD98059 at a concentration of 10 μm, which inhibits growth factor activation of ERK by 50–60% in Rat1 fibroblasts (30Cook S.J. Beltman J. Cadwallader K.A. McMahon M. McCormick F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13309-13319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), significantly inhibited migration of vector control lines toward FN (p < 0.0005) but did not affect migration stimulated by either PDGF-BB or LPA (Fig. 3,a–c). These results confirm that activation of the ERK pathway is necessary for migration toward soluble fibronectin, indicating a novel function for the ERK pathway in integrin-mediated cell migration. The control of cell migration by Rac might be expected to involve the regulation of lamellipodial dynamics, which has been shown to be controlled by Rac (5Ridley A.J. Paterson H.F. Johnston C.L. Diekman D. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 401-410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3095) Google Scholar). We therefore quantified PDGF-induced ruffling in Rat1 fibroblasts expressing N17-Rac1 and controls (Fig.4). PDGF-induced ruffling was strongly inhibited by expression of N17-Rac1 in Rat1 fibroblasts, in agreement with results obtained in other cell types (5Ridley A.J. Paterson H.F. Johnston C.L. Diekman D. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 401-410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3095) Google Scholar, 19Hawkins P.T. Eguinoa A. Qiu R.-Q. Stokoe D. Cooke F. Walters R. Wennstrom S. Claesson-Welsh L. Evans T. Symons M. Stephens L. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 393-403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). However, LPA at concentrations up to 1 μg/ml did not induce any ruffling response in Rat1 fibroblasts (data not shown), in line with earlier observations in Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts (6Ridley A.J. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 389-399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3856) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that Rac may regulate cell motility independently of its role in lamellipodia formation. Our data indicate that the Rac and ERK pathways mediate different types of migratory behavior, with the Rac pathway controlling motility stimulated by PDGF-BB and LPA and the ERK pathway controlling motility stimulated by FN (Fig. 5). Because Ras is essential for both PDGF- and LPA-stimulated motility (9Kundra V. Anand-Apte B. Feig L.A. Zetter B.R. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 725-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), our results also indicate that the Rac and ERK pathways can differentially mediate signals that emanate from Ras. This is consistent with results obtained with Ras effector loop mutants, which indicated that membrane ruffling and ERK activation are mediated by distinct Ras effectors (17Rodriguez-Viciana P.

White M.A. Wigler M.H. Bar-Sagi D. Science. 1996; 271: 810-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). The recent observation that Ras activation of Rac is mediated by phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, is also in line with previous findings that chemotaxis toward PDGF is phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-dependent (20Kundra V. Escobedo J.A. Kazlauskas A. Kim H.K. Rhee S.G. Williams L.T. Zetter B.R. Nature. 1994; 367: 474-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar, 21Wennstrom S. Siegbahn A. Yokote K. Arvidsson A.-K.

Chem. 1997; 272: 11307-11312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Interestingly, Ras, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, and Rac have also been shown to be necessary for hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor-induced dispersion of Madin-Darby canine kidney cells (31Hartmann G. Weidner K.M. Schwarz H. Birchmeier W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21936-21939Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Royal I. Park M. J. Biol.

Biol. 1995; 15: 1110-1122Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), indicating that this signaling cascade may be utilized in a variety of motile responses and may play an important role in mammalian development (34Bronner-Fraser M. Trends Genet. 1995; 11: 423-425Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Adhesion to fibronectin has been shown to activate ERK and may be responsible for shape-dependent cell proliferation (35Chen Q. Kinch M.S. Lin T.H. Burridge K. Juliano R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26602-26605Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Schlaepfer D.D. Hanks S.K. Hunter T. van der Geer P. Nature. 1994; 372: 786-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (1447) Google Scholar, 37Zhu X. Assoian R.K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 273-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). Our results indicate an additional role for the ERK pathway in fibronectin-stimulated migration. These results are consistent with a recent report, which shows that activation of the ERK pathway is necessary for haptotaxis stimulated by a collagen gradient (38Klemke R.L. Shuang C. Giannini A.L. Gallagher P.J. de Lanerolle P. Cheresh D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 481-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (1104) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that migration toward soluble fibronectin is Ras-independent (9Kundra V. Anand-Apte B. Feig L.A. Zetter B.R. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 725-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Whether Ras plays a role in integrin-induced activation of ERK still remains to be resolved, however (39Clark E.A. Hynes R.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14814-14818Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 40Chen Q. Lin T.H. Der C.J. Juliano R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18122-18127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which Rac controls migration remains to be elucidated. The inhibition of LPA-stimulated motility by N17-Rac1 suggests that the role of Rac in cell migration could be independent of its function in the control of lamellipodia. Although this may come as a surprise, it is consistent with recent studies on actin filament dynamics and ultrastructure in locomoting heart fibroblasts, which showed that the rate of cell locomotion correlates with the flow of actin filaments in the cell body and not with that in lamellipodia (41Cramer L. Siebert M. Mithchison T.J. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 1287-1305Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Therefore, in addition to regulating the formation of lamellipodia, Rac may control more subtle cytoskeletal features, which still remain to be defined. Rac could also regulate cell migration by inducing the expression of matrix-degrading proteases, since AP1 and PEA3, two elements that are implicated in the control of matrix metalloprotease expression (42Crawford H.C. Matrisian L.M. Enzyme Protein. 1996; 49: 20-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), are both activated by Rac (43Minden A. Lin A. Claret F.-X. Abo A. Karin M. Cell. 1995; 81: 1147-1157Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1447) Google Scholar, 44O'Hagan R.C. Tozer R.G. Symons M. McCormick F. Hassell J.A. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 1323-1333PubMed Google Scholar). A similar mechanism might be used by the ERK pathway to control cell migration toward fibronectin. Alternatively, the ERK pathway could control migration toward FN via activation of myosin light chain kinase, as was shown to be the case for collagen-mediated haptotaxis (38Klemke R.L. Shuang C. Giannini A.L. Gallagher P.J. de Lanerolle P. Cheresh D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 481-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (1104) Google Scholar). The function of Rac in the regulation of directed cell migration is in line with the role of Tiam1, a Rac guanine nucleotide exchange factor, which facilitates cell invasion (45Habets G.G.M. Scholtes E.H.M. Zuydgeest D. van der Kammen R.A. Stam J.C. Berns A. Collard J.G. Cell. 1994; 77: 537-549Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar, 46Michiels F. Habets G.G.M. Stam J.C. van der Kammen R.A. Collard J.G. Nature. 1995; 375: 338-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar). Furthermore, directed migration is a critical component in angiogenesis (4Stokes C.L. Lauffenburger D.A. J. Theor. Biol. 1991; 152: 377-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Thus, the data presented in this paper suggest that Rac, in addition to its role in tumorigenicity (12Qiu R.-G. Chen J. Kirn D. McCormick F. Symons M. Nature. 1995; 374: 457-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (814) Google Scholar, 13Khosravi-Far R. Solski P.A. Clark G.J. Kinch M.S. Der C.J. Mol. Cell.

Fattaey for gifts of plasmids. We also thank J. Folkman and A. Balmain for critical reading of the manuscript."

To understand the molecular mechanisms that regulate human CCR5 gene expression, we initiated studies to determine its genomic and mRNA organization. Previous studies have identified a single CCR5 mRNA isoform whose open reading frame is intronless. We now report the following novel findings. 1) Complex alternative splicing and multiple transcription start sites give rise to several distinct CCR5 transcripts that differ in their 5′-untranslated regions (UTR). 2) The gene is organized into four exons and two introns. Exons 2 and 3 are not interrupted by an intron. Exon 4 and portions of exon 3 are shared by all isoforms. Exon 4 contains the open reading frame, 11 nucleotides of the 5′-UTR and the complete 3′-UTR. 3) The transcripts appear to be initiated from two distinct promoters: an upstream promoter (PU), upstream of exon 1, and a downstream promoter (PD), that includes the “intronic” region between exons 1 and 3. 4) PU and PD lacked the canonical TATA or CAAT motifs, and are AT-rich. 5) PD demonstrated strong constitutive promoter activity, whereas PU was a weak promoter in all three leukocyte cell environments tested (THP-1, Jurkat, and K562). 6) We provide evidence for polymorphisms in the noncoding sequences, including the regulatory regions and 5′-UTRs. The structure of CCR5 was strikingly reminiscent of the overall structure of other chemokine/chemoattractant receptors, underscoring an important evolutionarily conserved function for a prototypical gene structure. This is the first description of functional promoters for any CC chemokine receptor gene, and we speculate that the complex pattern of splicing events and dual promoter usage may function as a versatile mechanism to create diversity and flexibility in the regulation of CCR5 expression.

In contrast, individuals who display theCCR5/ΔCCR5 genotype can develop HIV-1 infection, however, their progression to AIDS may be slower. Interestingly, in individuals who display the CCR5/CCR5 genotype, the cell surface expression of CCR5 can be highly variable (13Wu L. Paxton W.A. Kassam N. Ruffing N. Rottman J.B. Sullivan N. Choe H.

These observations suggest that a therapeutic or preventive strategy based on targeting CCR5 cell surface expression could potentially be quite beneficial. Toward this end, we have initiated studies to define the structural organization of CCR5 and molecular factors that regulate its expression. Phylogenetic analysis of the G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily indicates that replication of a progenitor gene may have given rise to clusters of evolutionarily related receptor genes (14Murphy P.M. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 593-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (1131) Google Scholar,15Murphy P.M. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 1996; 7: 47-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Two such GPCR clusters are members of the chemokine receptor subclass, and receptors for the classical chemoattractants, such as theN-formyl peptide receptor. To date, the complete mRNA and genomic organization of only a limited number of human chemokine receptors has been described (16Iwamoto S. Li J. Omi T. Ikemoto S. Kajii E.

Gene (Amst.). 1993; 133: 285-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). 1) Their ORFs are usually intronless or contain a single intron interrupting the amino-terminal coding region, as is the case for the C5a receptor (21Gerard N.P. Bao L. Xiao-Ping H. Eddy Jr., R.L. Shows T.B. Gerard C. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 1243-1250Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). 2) Their 5′-untranslated regions (UTR) can have a surprisingly complex organization. Unlike most GPCRs, the 5′ UTRs for these genes reside on multiple exons and alternative splicing may generate multiple mRNA isoforms. 3) Splicing of the untranslated exons to form the mature transcripts occurs at a common 3′-splice junction that is a short distance upstream of the start of the translation. Thus, the transcription and translation start sites can be separated by long intervening sequences. 5) Although they are products of distinct genes, they tend to be physically clustered on a single chromosome (14Murphy P.M. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 593-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (1131) Google Scholar, 15Murphy P.M. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 1996; 7: 47-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar,19Ahuja S.K.

For example, CCR5 and several other CCRs co-localize on chromosome 3p21.3-p24 (25Samson M. Soularue P. Vassart G. Parmentier M. Genomics. 1996; 36: 522-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), whereas several of the chemoattractant receptors co-localize to 19q13.3 (21Gerard N.P. Bao L. Xiao-Ping H. Eddy Jr., R.L. Shows T.B. Gerard C. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 1243-1250Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). These similarities suggest that despite coding for receptors that have diverse ligand-receptor relationships, these two subclasses of receptors have retained a remarkably conserved structural organization. Some of these prototypical structural features also appears to be true for human CCR5. First, a partial length gene (1376 bp) has been cloned and it has an intronless CCR5 ORF (Ref. 1Samson M. Labbe O. Mollereau C. Vassart G. Parmentier M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 3362-3367Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar; position 240 to 1298). Second, cDNA clones for CCR5 have been cloned and reported by two groups (2Combadiere C. Ahuja S.K. Tiffany H.L. Murphy P.M. J.

Comparison of the partialCCR5 sequence with that of the cDNA clones, and restriction mapping of P1 clones suggests the presence of a single ∼1.9-kb intron between position −11 and −12 relative to the start of translation (1Samson M.

The cDNA clone reported by Raport et al. (3Raport C.J. Gosling J. Schweickart V.L. Gray P.W. Charo I.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17161-17166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar) also contains a poly(A) tail, suggesting a full-length 3′-end. Nevertheless, the exact location of the remainder of the reported CCR5 5′-UTR sequence on the gene, and the nature of thecis-acting elements is not known. Expression of CCR5 at the mRNA level suggests that CCR5may contain tissue-specific cis-acting elements. An ∼4-kb human CCR5 transcript has been observed in several human cell lines, and in human thymus, spleen, small intestine, and peripheral blood leukocytes (1Samson M. Labbe O. Mollereau C.

Leukocyte Biol. 1996; 60: 147-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar) have shown that human CCR5 transcripts are present in primary adherent monocytes but are absent from the primary neutrophils and eosinophils. Carrollet al. (26Carroll R.G. Riley J.L. Levine B.L. Feng Y. Kaushal S. Ritchey D.W. Bernstein W. Weislow O.S. Brown C.R. Berger E.A. June C.H. Science. 1997; 276: 273-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) have reported recently that human unstimulated CD4+ cells do not express CCR5 mRNA. However, CD4+ cells activated by phytohemagglutinin (PHA)/IL-2 expressed CCR5 mRNA, whereas those costimulated with immobilized antibodies to CD3/CD28 did not. Both unstimulated CD4+ cells and CD4+ cells costimulated with CD3/CD28 were resistant to infection by macrophage-tropic strains of HIV-1 in vitro, whereas phytohemagglutinin/interleukin-2 activated CD4+ cells could be infected, further highlighting the importance of understanding the molecular mechanisms that regulate CCR5 expression. The present study represents a first step toward addressing some of the issues outlined above. Unlike reported previously, we demonstrate that the mRNA structure of human CCR5 is not monomorphic. Instead transcript analysis by 5′-RACE and RT-PCR (reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction) revealed complex alternative splicing patterns in the 5′-UTRs of CCR5: alternative splicing of four exons that span ∼6 kb of CCR5 give rise to multiple CCR5 transcripts that differ in their 5′-UTRs. Although the generation of multiple CCR5 transcripts has no effect on the protein sequence of CCR5, it does have consequences for the regulation of the gene as we demonstrate that CCR5 transcription is regulated by at least two promoters, and we ascribe an important role for the 5′-UTR and intron sequences in regulating CCR5 expression. In this report we also provide evidence that the regulatory sequences and noncoding exons of CCR5 are polymorphic. After obtaining informed consent, normal adult donors were pretreated with granulocyte colony stimulating factor (Amgen; 10 μg/kg body weight, subcutaneously) for 5 days, and then their low density cells in the peripheral blood were collected by apheresis. These cells were enriched for CD34+ progenitor cells by positive selection, using the Ceprate SC column (CellPro, Bothell, WA). The purified CD34+ cells were differentiated into dendritic cells by culturing them in a cytokine mixture for 7 days. The cytokine mixture contained stem cell factor (20 ng/ml), granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor (20 ng/ml), and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α (2 ng/ml; R & D Systems). The culture conditions were similar to those described previously (27Ahuja S.S. Brown M.R. Fleisher T.A. Ahuja S.K. Malech H.L. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 4345-4353PubMed Google Scholar), and included Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium and 20% fetal calf serum (Life Technologies). We confirmed that the cells derived from the cytokine-stimulated CD34+ cells had a dendritic cell phenotype by two independent criteria (data not shown): first, by fluorescence-activated cell sorter they expressed a high percentage of cell surface markers characteristic of dendritic cells; and second, dendritic cells pulsed with tetanus toxoid and purified-protein derivative stimulated the proliferation of autologous T cells. Density gradient Ficoll centrifugation was used to isolate peripheral blood mononuclear cells from whole blood and the cells obtained from the apheresis flow-through. Monocytes were isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells by plastic adherence for 6 h. CD4+ cells were purified by positive selection using the Ceprate LC4 column (CellPro). To prepare activated CD4+ T lymphocytes, resting CD4+ T lymphocytes were stimulated with irradiated autologous dendritic cells. Lymphocytes, monocytes, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells were cultured in RPMI and 10% fetal bovine serum. The apheresis protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio, TX. Total RNA was extracted from human leukocytes, including dendritic cells and the cell lines (THP-1 and Jurkat), using commercially purchased reagents according to instructions of the manufacturer (Trizol; Life Technologies). The template for 5′-RACE was total RNA (1 μg) isolated from dendritic cells. For RT-PCR, the template was 1 μg of total RNA isolated from human leukocytes, including dendritic cells. We used a 5′-RACE kit (5′-RACE System, Life Technologies) as per instructions of the manufacturer. The sequences of the reverse and forward primers (primary and nested) corresponded to the amino terminus of the CCR5 ORF and the anchor primer, respectively. The 5′-RACE products were subcloned into pBlueScript II SK(+) and the nucleotide sequence was determined on both strands. To confirm the sequence composition of the 5′-RACE products we performed RT-PCR reactions on the aforementioned RNA templates. A reverse primer complementary to the amino terminus of CCR5 was first extended by avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen), and then PCR was performed with a forward primer that was specific to the 5′-most unique sequence segment identified by 5′-RACE and a reverse primer specific to the CCR5 ORF; semi-nested PCR was then performed on this PCR template with primers specific to the 5′-UTR (Fig. 1 B). The RT-PCR products were subcloned into pBlueScript II SK(+) and sequenced. Oligonucleotides were synthesized by the Advanced DNA Technology Unit, University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio, TX. DNA sequence analysis was performed by the dideoxy method according to the manufacturer's instructions (U. S. Biochemical Corp.) and also by the Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing method using an automated fluorescent sequencer (Applied Biosystem 373). The genomic region upstream of the 5′-UTR sequence reported by Raport et al. (3Raport C.J. Gosling J. Schweickart V.L. Gray P.W. Charo I.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17161-17166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar) was cloned by using the Human PromoterFinder Kit (CLONTECH) according to the manufacturer's protocols. The forward and reverse primers (primary and nested) were complementary to the adaptor ligated to the genomic DNA fragments in each library, and the 5′-UTR sequence reported by Raport et al. (3Raport C.J. Gosling J. Schweickart V.L. Gray P.W. Charo I.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17161-17166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar), respectively. A series of overlapping genomic DNA amplification products were also generated using PCR primer sets specific to the following regions: 1) 5′-UTR and amino terminus of the ORF; 2) amino terminus and the intracellular carboxyl-tail of the ORF (28Alkhatib G. Ahuja S.S. Light D. Mummidi S. Berger E.A. Ahuja S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19771-19776Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar); and 3) the intracellular carboxyl-tail of the ORF and a reverse primer whose 3′ terminus is immediately upstream to the polyadenylation signal sequence AAATAA in the 3′-UTR. The PCR amplification products were subcloned into pBlueScript II SK(+) and the nucleotide sequence was obtained for both strands. Nucleotide sequences were analyzed by algorithms in the GCG software (BLAST, FASTA, BestFit) and GeneWorks (IntelliGenetics, CA). The promoter sequences were analyzed for the presence of potential transcription factor binding sites by the SIGSCAN (http://bimas.dcrt.nih.gov/molbio/signal; Ref. 29Prestridge D.S. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1991; 7: 203-206PubMed Google Scholar) and MatInspector (http://transfac.gbf-braunschweig.de/TRANSFAC/; Ref. 30Quandt K. Frech K. Karas H. Wingender E. Werner T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4878-4884Crossref PubMed Scopus (2428) Google Scholar) programs. Convenient restriction endonuclease sites and/or PCR were used to create a series of gene fragments of varying lengths from different regions ofCCR5, and they were cloned into the promoterless pGL3-Basic vector (Promega) upstream of the firefly luciferase gene. Nucleotide fidelity was confirmed by sequencing. The cell lines (K562, Jurkat, and THP-1) were obtained from ATCC (Rockville, MD). The promoter constructs were transfected into the cell lines as described previously (18Ahuja S.K. Shetty A. Tiffany H.L. Murphy P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26381-26389Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Transfection efficiency was normalized by cotransfecting either the promoterless vector pGL3-Basic or the CCR5 promoter constructs with 0.5 μg of renilla luciferase vector, pRL-CMV (Promega). Forty hours post-transfection the cells were pelleted, washed in Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 1 × passive lysis buffer (Promega). The firefly and renilla luciferase activities were determined according to manufacturer's instructions (Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System, Promega) in a luminometer (Turner TD-20/20). In initial experiments, we determined that the protein concentration in the cell lysates as measured by the Bradford method were comparable between and within experiments. The “relative luciferase activity” reported is derived from: (firefly luciferase activity ofCCR5 promoter construct ÷ renilla luciferase activity of co-transfected pRL-CMV) ÷ (firefly luciferase of promoterless vector pGL3-Basic ÷ renilla luciferase activity of co-transfected pRL-CMV). A single CCR5 mRNA isoform that contains a 5′-UTR of 54-nucleotides in length has been reported (3Raport C.J. Gosling J. Schweickart V.L. Gray P.W. Charo I.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17161-17166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). Since alternative splicing in the 5′-UTRs appears to be a feature common to several human chemokine and chemoattractant receptors (18Ahuja S.K. Shetty A. Tiffany H.L. Murphy P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26381-26389Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Mutoh H. Bito H. Minami M. Nakamura M. Honda Z. Izumi T. Nakata R. Kurachi Y. Terano A. Shimizu T.

Gene (Amst.). 1993; 133: 285-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that this might also be true for CCR5. To test this hypothesis, we designed a strategy that involved 5′-RACE and RT-PCR techniques, and probed the diversity in the CCR5 mRNA structure in several primary human cell types and the human cell lines THP-1 and Jurkat. By this strategy, we identified PCR products of ∼100 to ∼350 bp in length from human dendritic cells, suggesting the possibility of novel 5′-UTR sequences. These PCR products were subcloned, and a schematic illustration of their sequence composition is shown in Fig.1 A. Based on sequence analysis and criteria outlined below, we have arbitrarily segregated these cDNA clones into two categories, representing either “full-length” or “truncated” CCR5 transcripts. The two full-length CCR5 transcripts, designated as CCR5A and CCR5B, shared three sequence segments but differed by the presence or absence of a 235-bp sequence segment in the 5′-UTR (Fig. 1). As demonstrated later, these sequence segments were identified on CCR5, and based on their location on the gene they were designated as exons 1–4; exon 2 corresponded to the 235-bp sequence segment that is unique to CCR5A. Exons 1, 3, and 4 were common to both CCR5-A and -B, and the ORF, 11-bp of the 5′-UTR and the 3′-UTR resided in exon 4 (Fig.1 A). The cDNA clones that lacked sequences corresponding to the 5′-most unique sequence segment, i.e. exon 1, were arbitrarily classified as truncated CCR5 mRNA isoforms. The 5′-termini of the truncated clones relative to their position on CCR5A are shown in Fig. 1. It should be emphasized that the truncated CCR5 transcripts could also represent incomplete cDNA synthesis by the reverse transcriptase. However, two findings suggest that this may not be the case. 1) From a single RT-PCR, we cloned products whose lengths were significantly longer than the truncated transcripts (Fig.1 A). 2) Except in a single instance, several clones had identical 5′ termini, suggesting that they may represent transcripts that originate from distinct transcription start sites. It should also be noted that the presence of additional CCR5 isoforms that may have unique 5′-noncoding exons or novel splice patterns cannot be excluded. The cDNA sequence reported by Raport et al. (3Raport C.J. Gosling J. Schweickart V.L. Gray P.W. Charo I.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17161-17166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar) lacked in-frame stop codons in the 5′-UTR, raising the possibility of a longer CCR5 ORF initiated at an upstream methionine. In-frame stop codons were identified 26 and 12 amino acids upstream of the currently assigned translation initiation codon in CCR5A and CCR5B, respectively. None of the upstream in-frame amino acids were a methionine, excluding the possibility of a longer transcript that could encode a protein isoform with an amino-terminal extension. Interestingly, four upstream AUG triplets were found in the 5′-UTR of both CCR5A and CCR5B, but they were followed by downstream termination codons, and the two longest minicistrons were 9 and 15 amino acids in length. The 5′-UTR sequences of the full-length and truncated CCR5 transcripts appeared to be highly conserved in evolution as GenBank data base analysis revealed strong sequence homology with the 5′-UTRs of mouse and rat CCR5 cDNAs (Fig. 1 B). The 5′ termini of the 5′-UTRs of mouse and rat cDNAs reside in a region that corresponds to exon 2 of human CCR5A. Whether additional upstream mRNA sequences exists in these two species is not known. It is interesting that 12 bp upstream of the start of the translation start site, all the human C"

In vitro, the binding of the ARF1 GTPase-activating protein to lipid vesicles and its activity on membrane-bound ARF1GTP are increased by diacylglycerols with monounsaturated acyl chains, such as those arising in vivo as secondary products from the hydrolysis of phosphatidylcholine by ARF-activated phospholipase D. Thus, the phospholipase D pathway may provide a feedback mechanism that promotes GTP hydrolysis on ARF1 and the consequent uncoating of vesicles.

Thus, the phospholipase D pathway may provide a feedback mechanism that promotes GTP hydrolysis on ARF1 and the consequent uncoating of vesicles.

Following a GDP to GTP exchange catalyzed by a guanine nucleotide exchange factor, ARF1GTP tightly associates with the Golgi membrane and triggers the assembly of a coat protein complex termed coatomer (1Rothman J.E. Nature. 1994; 372: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (2011) Google Scholar). These events result in the budding of a transport vesicle. The subsequent hydrolysis of ARF1-bound GTP triggers vesicle uncoating, a prerequisite for vesicle fusion (2Tanigawa G. Orci L. Amherdt M. Ravazzola M. Helms J.B. Rothman J.E. J.

In the GTP state, ARF1 is attached to vesicles through the insertion of its myristate and of hydrophobic residues of its N-terminal amphipathic helix in the membrane lipids and through electrostatic interaction between basic residues and the polar head of acidic lipids, without specificity for phosphatidylserine (PS), phosphatidylglycerol, PA or even Pip2 (10Antonny B. Beraud-Dufour S. Chardin P. Chabre M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4675-4684Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). The membrane attachment of ARF1GTPimplies that catalysis of GTP hydrolysis by ARF1 GAP occurs at the membrane surface. Here, we show that the membrane binding of ARF1 GAP and its activity on ARF1GTP are dramatically increased by diacylglycerols with monounsaturated acyl chains. All lipids were of the highest available purity (>98%). Brain PA, egg PC, egg phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), brain PS, and brain PIP2 were obtained from Sigma. Synthetic lipids were obtained from Sigma except for 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycerol and 1-stearoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-phosphatidylcholine, which were obtained from Avanti Polar Lipids (Birmingham, AL). Unilamellar vesicles were prepared by the extrusion method as described previously (9Chardin P. Paris P. Antonny B. Robineau S. Béraud-Dufour S. Jackson C.L. Chabre M. Nature. 1996; 384: 481-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar, 10Antonny B. Beraud-Dufour S. Chardin P. Chabre M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4675-4684Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Briefly, solutions of lipids in chloroform:methanol or, in the case of PIP2, in chloroform:methanol:H2O:1 n HCl (20:9:1:0.1) were mixed in the required proportion. A film was formed from the lipid mixture in a rotatory evaporator and resuspended in 50 mmHepes, pH 7.5, and 100 mm KCl. The suspension was vortexed for 20 min and then freeze-thawed 5 times. Unilamellar vesicles were produced by extrusion through a 0.1-μm pore size polycarbonate filter (isopore, Millipore) using an extrusion apparatus. For sucrose-loaded vesicles, the same procedure was used except that the buffer was 220 mm sucrose, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, and that 0.4-μm pore size polycarbonate filters were used. After extrusion, the sucrose-loaded vesicles were diluted 1:5 in 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, and 120 mm NaCl, centrifuged for 10 min at 400,000 × g, and resuspended in the same buffer before use. 1–257GAP, the longest form of ARF1 GAP that can be expressed in Escherichia coli, and the full-length yeast homolog Gcs1 were expressed in BL21 E. coli with an N-terminal hexahistidine tag (4Cukierman E.

Proteins were solubilized from inclusion bodies in 6 m guanidine, 20 mm Tris, 100 mm sodium phosphate pH 8. After centrifugation, the supernatant was mixed with Ni-NTA beads and stirred for 45 min. The beads were washed with the same guanidine solution, transferred to a column, and then washed with 6 mguanidine, 100 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.3. Proteins were eluted with the same solution supplemented with 0.5 mimidazole. After addition of 5 mm dithiothreitol, proteins were dialyzed overnight against 25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, and 2 mm dithiothreitol.1–257GAP was further purified by Mono Q chromatography using a NaCl gradient in 25 mm Tris, pH 7.5.1–257GAP and Gcs1 were stored at −20 °C with 33% glycerol. As judged by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, ARF1 GAP and Gcs1 were 80% pure. Recombinant ARNO and myristoylated ARF1 were purified as described (9Chardin P. Paris P. Antonny B. Robineau S. Béraud-Dufour S. Jackson C.L. Chabre M. Nature. 1996; 384: 481-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar, 12Franco M. Chardin P. Chabre M. Paris S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1337-1341Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). ARF1GTP shows an intrinsic fluorescence that is 3 times as high as ARF1GDP(10Antonny B. Beraud-Dufour S. Chardin P. Chabre M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4675-4684Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). This difference was used to monitor in real time ARF1 activation upon GDP to GTP exchange and ARF1 deactivation upon GTP hydrolysis. All measurements were performed at 37 °C in 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, and 2 mm dithiothreitol and with unilamellar vesicles (final lipid concentration, 250–500 μm). 1–257GAP (1.5 μm) or Gcs1 (1 μm) was incubated at room temperature in 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 120 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, and 2 mm dithiothreitol with sucrose-loaded vesicles (final lipid concentration, 2.5 mm). After centrifugation (400,000 × g, 15 min), the relative amounts of protein in the supernatant and the pellet were determined by densitometry of SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis after Coomassie Blue staining. It must be noted that the lipid pellet includes a small but significant volume of external solution and therefore traps about 2% of any soluble protein. Therefore, only values of membrane binding >5% are significant. The kinetics of GAP-catalyzed GTP hydrolysis on ARF1 does not fit to a single exponential function. This is probably linked to the fact that the reaction does not occur in solution but at the membrane surface. For each fluorescence recording, the apparent half-time (t½) of ARF deactivation was determined graphically. Variation in the value of 1/t½ was <5% when determined from duplicate experiments using the same batch of vesicles and <30% when different lipid vesicle preparations were used. To examine whether ARF1 GAP interacts specifically with certain lipids, we analyzed the activity of a truncated but fully active form of ARF1 GAP, 1–257GAP, on ARF1GTP bound to unilamellar lipid vesicles of controlled composition, always including 30% PS. The decrease of ARF1 tryptophan fluorescence that occurs upon GTP hydrolysis was used to monitor the reaction in real time. With vesicles containing 70% egg PC, the deactivation of ARF1 upon the addition of a catalytic amount of ARF1 GAP occurred very slowly (Fig.1 A). The kinetics was not accelerated by incorporating 10% PA or 5% PIP2 at the expense of PC. By contrast, a 10-fold increase in the rate of GAP-catalyzed hydrolysis of GTP on ARF1 was observed upon the incorporation of 10% 1,2-dioleoylglycerol (1,2-DOG), a diacylglycerol with two monounsaturated acyl chains (C18:1). An opposite pattern emerged when the same lipids were tested for their effects on the exchange activity of ARNO (Fig. 1 B). With 1,2-DOG- or PA-containing vesicles, ARNO-catalyzed activation of ARF1 was as slow as with control vesicles, but in the presence of 5% PIP2it was dramatically increased, in agreement with our previous study demonstrating the binding of ARNO to PIP2-containing vesicles through its PH domain (9Chardin P. Paris P. Antonny B. Robineau S. Béraud-Dufour S. Jackson C.L. Chabre M. Nature. 1996; 384: 481-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). Thus, the two reactions of the activation/deactivation cycle of ARF1 are differentially regulated by lipids: PIP2 accelerates ARNO-catalyzed GDP/GTP exchange, whereas 1,2-DOG accelerates GAP-catalyzed hydrolysis of GTP on ARF1. Several diacylglycerols (DAGs) were compared for their ability to activate ARF1 GAP (Fig. 2 A). Three striking observations were made. First, 1,3-DOG was as active as 1,2-DOG. Therefore, a specific recognition by ARF1 GAP of the esterified positions of the glycerol backbone, like that found for the interaction of protein kinase C with DAG (13Newton A.C. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1993; 22: 1-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), can be ruled out. It is noteworthy that TPA, a phorbol ester that mimics the glycerol part of DAG and activates protein kinase C, did not activate ARF1 GAP (data not shown). Second, the DAG dose responses were nonlinear. This also rules out a simple 1:1 lipid-protein interaction. Third, activation of ARF1 GAP by DAG was highly dependent on the nature of the acyl chains, another difference from protein kinase C for which large changes in the composition of the acyl chains are tolerated (13Newton A.C. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1993; 22: 1-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). DAGs with two saturated acyl chains had only marginal effects on ARF1 GAP activity. Only DAGs with one or two monounsaturated acyl chains (oleoyl) were potent activators of ARF1 GAP. Surprisingly, 1-stearoyl-2-arachidonoyl-glycerol, a DAG containing one saturated acyl chain and one polyunsaturated acyl chain, was inactive. It is noteworthy that monounsaturated and polyunsaturated DAGs are generated by different phospholipid signaling pathways. Monounsaturated DAGs derive mainly from the hydrolysis of PC into DAG by the sequential action of PLD and phosphatidate phosphatase, whereas polyunsaturated DAGs derive almost exclusively from the hydrolysis of PIP2by PI-phospholipase C (14Pessin M.S. Raben D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8729-8738Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Pettitt T.R. Martin A. Horton T. Liossis C. Lord J.M. Wakelam M.J.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17354-17359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Therefore, the activation of ARF1 GAP by DAGs with monounsaturated acyl chains suggests that ARF1 GAP activity is controlled by the PLD pathway. In the Golgi, the level of DAG is mainly in balance with that of PC. Indeed, not only the PLD pathway but also the sphingomyelin pathway generate DAGs at the expense of PC, whereas the CDP-choline pathway consumes DAG in favor of PC synthesis (16Moreau P. Cassagne C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1197: 257-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 17van Meer G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 661-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Interestingly, 1,2-DOG and PC have opposing effects on ARF1 GAP activity. PC seems inhibitory when compared with the other major neutral phospholipid component of membranes, PE, which differs from PC only by having a smaller and less hydrated polar head. When the proportion of PC was reduced in favor of PE, the basal ARF1 GAP activity in the absence of DAG was increased, and the 1,2-DOG dose response curve was shifted to lower surface concentrations (Figs. 2 B and3 A). Similar enhancements were observed when other phospholipids (PS, phosphatidylglycerol, or PA) were incorporated at the expense of PC (data not shown), suggesting that ARF1 GAP activity is inhibited by PC rather than activated by a specific phospholipid. By combining the opposite effects of 1,2-DOG and PC, the activity of ARF1 GAP may be varied in vitro by 2 orders of magnitude. This high sensitivity to membrane composition implies that any lipid pathway that modifies the relative amounts of PC and 1,2-DOG at the cytoplasmic surface of Golgi vesicles will have a dramatic effect on ARF1 GAP activity. To determine whether 1,2-DOG acts directly on ARF1 GAP, we studied the binding of 1–257GAP to ARF-free lipid vesicles by sedimentation. The presence of 10% 1,2-DOG and the substitution of PE for PC enhanced the binding of 1–257GAP to vesicles (Fig.3 B), whereas the presence of 1-stearoyl-2-arachidonoyl-glycerol did not (data not shown). Thus, a good correlation was observed between 1–257GAP activity on membrane-bound ARF1GTP (Fig. 3 A) and1–257GAP translocation to vesicles (Fig. 3 B). By contrast, the near total partitioning of ARF1GTP with the membrane was not affected by these changes in the lipid composition (data not shown). Thus, 1,2-DOG stimulates the activity of ARF1 GAP by promoting its membrane recruitment, hence favoring its interaction with membrane-bound ARF1GTP, whereas PC inhibits ARF1 GAP activity by hindering its translocation to vesicles. Similar experiments were performed with Gcs1, a yeast homolog of ARF1 GAP that can be produced as a full-length protein in E. coli(10Antonny B. Beraud-Dufour S. Chardin P. Chabre M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4675-4684Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Gcs1 was one-fourth as active on bovine ARF1GTP as1–257GAP, but it was similarly affected by 1,2-DOG and PC for its activity (Fig. 3 C) and for its binding to vesicles (Fig. 3 D). Gcs1 and ARF1 GAP show a high degree of similarity in their first 100 amino acids, which include a zinc finger motif (4Cukierman E. Huber I. Rotman M. Cassel D. Science. 1995; 270: 1999-2002Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 11Poon P.P. Wang X. Rotman M. Huber I. Cukierman E. Cassel D. Singer R.A. Johnston G.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Jackson T.R. Profit A.A. Blader I.J. Turck C.W. Prestwich G.D. Theibert A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18859-18868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 19Tanaka K.

However, this does not preclude additional or different mechanisms for regulation by lipids. Partially purified ARF1 GAP proteins, distinct from the protein studied here, have been shown to be activated by phosphoinositides (21Ding M. Vitale N. Tsai S.-C. Adamik R. Moss J. Vaughan M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24005-24009Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 22Randazzo P.A. Biochem. J. 1997; 324: 413-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). To further analyze the mechanisms by which PC hinders and 1,2-DOG promotes the binding of ARF1 GAP or Gcs1 to lipid vesicles, we systematically varied the vesicle composition, using synthetic lipids of strictly defined acyl chains. A simple rule emerged: the activity of ARF1 GAP is a function of the relative volumes occupied by the polar head and the hydrocarbon chains of the lipids. ARF1 GAP activity increased when the size of the polar head decreased (PC < PE < PA < DAG; Fig. 4 A) and when the number of monounsaturated acyl chains in DAG (Fig.2 A) or even in PC (Fig. 4 B) increased (C16:0-C16:0 < C16:0-C18:1 < C18:1-C18:1). Thus, the inhibition of ARF1 GAP by PC and its activation by 1,2-DOG have the same physical basis: 1,2-DOG is a cone-shaped lipid. It lacks a polar head and occupies a large hydrophobic volume because the cis double bond induces a bend at the middle of the hydrocarbon chain. By contrast, saturated PCs have a large hydrated polar head, and their acyl chains occupy a cylindrical hydrophobic volume of small section. Other lipids display intermediate shapes between these two extreme cases. We speculate that rather than involving a specific lipid recognition, the binding of ARF-GAP1 to membranes is mainly driven by hydrophobic contact of the protein with the lipid hydrocarbon chains near their interface with the glycerol backbone (Fig. 4 C). Such a relatively deep penetration is probably hindered by large lipid polar head groups and favored by monounsaturated acyl chains. By spreading apart, these bent acyl chains leave intermolecular “cavities,” in which hydrophobic amino acids of ARF1 GAP could insert. The striking observation that 1-stearoyl-2-arachidonoyl-glycerol behaves like a saturated DAG rather than a DAG with a monounsaturated oleoyl chain was also demonstrated with the corresponding fatty acids: addition to the vesicles of 10% oleate significantly increased ARF1 GAP activity, whereas the same amount of arachidonate or palmitate did not (data not shown). This agrees with model studies suggesting that the conformation of the arachidonoyl chain in the lipid layer is closer to that of a rigid saturated alkyl chain than to that of a bent oleoyl chain (23Applegate K.R. Glomset J.A. J. Lipid Res. 1991; 32: 1645-1655Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Alternatively, the arachidonoyl chain could adopt a hairpin shape. Such a conformation could also be unfavorable for the penetration of hydrophobic residues because it does not create a cavity below the glycerol backbone but rather a steric hindrance. Our finding that PC-derived DAGs activate ARF1 GAP by promoting its translocation to the vesicle has several implications. First, it suggests a function for PC-derived DAGs, which in vivo do not activate most protein kinase C isozymes because the PLD pathway, in contrast to the phospholipase C pathway, is not accompanied by an increase in intracellular calcium (24Leach K.L. Ruff V.A. Wright T.M. Pessin M.S. Raben D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3215-3221Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Ha K.-S. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10534-10539Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A recent study on yeast strains with secretion defects highlights the role of DAG in Golgi vesicular transport (26Kearns B.G. McGee T.P. Mayinger P. Gedvilaite A. Phillips S.E. Kagidawa S. Bankaitis V.A. Nature. 1997; 387: 101-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). The Sec14 protein negatively regulates the CDP-choline pathway, which consumes DAG to produce PC. Sec14p is essential for vesicular transport, but this requirement is bypassed upon blocking the CDP-choline pathway or overproducing DAG by another lipid pathway. Thus, preservation of a DAG pool at the expense of PC seems essential for Golgi function in yeast. ARF1 GAP could be one of the putative DAG “sensors.” Finally, the activation of ARF1 GAP by PC-derived DAG suggests a feedback loop linking the translocation of ARF1 GAP to vesicles with the activation of PLD by ARF1GTP(Fig. 5). The production of PA from PC hydrolysis by ARF1-activated PLD contributes to the binding of the coatomer to vesicles (7Ktistakis N.T. Brown H.A. Waters M.G. Sternweis P.C. Roth M.G. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 295-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). After a sustained activation of PLD by ARF1GTP, DAGs may accumulate and trigger ARF1 GAP translocation to vesicles, leading to GTP hydrolysis on ARF1 and coatomer disassembly. This would ensure a fine control of the duration of vesicle coating. We thank S. Beraud-Dufour and S. Robineau for help in protein expression and purification and P. Chardin for helpful comments."

Via a distinct domain, amphiphysin I was reported to interact with the appendage domain of the plasma membrane clathrin adaptor AP2 (4David C. McPherson P.S. Mundigl O. De Camilli P. Proc. Natl.

Chem. 1995; 270: 10079-10083Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). It has therefore been suggested that amphiphysin I may be implicated in the control of synaptic vesicle endocytosis. This possibility was recently supported by experiments carried out at the giant reticulospinal synapse of the lamprey (14Shupliakov O. Low P. Grabs D. Gad H. Chen H. David C. Takei K. De Camilli P. Brodin L. Science. 1997; 276: 259-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). Injection in the presynaptic compartment of peptides that disrupt SH3-mediated interactions of dynamin, including the interaction with amphiphysin I, was shown to produce a potent inhibition of synaptic vesicle endocytosis at the stage of invaginated clathrin-coated pits. Furthermore, the SH3 domain of amphiphysin I inhibits receptor-mediated endocytosis when transfected in fibroblastic cells (64Wigge P. Vallis Y. McMahon T. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 554-560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar).A role of amphiphysin I in endocytosis is further suggested by genetic studies in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Disruption of the genes encoding the homologue of amphiphysin, Rvs167, or the closely related protein Rvs161, produces a potent inhibition both of receptor-mediated and fluid phase endocytosis (15Munn A.L. Stevenson B.J. Geli M.I. Riezman H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 1721-1742Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Mutation of theRVS161 and RVS167 genes also produces other pleotropic effects (16Crouzet M. Urdaci M. Dulau L. Aigle M.

The latter phenotype is consistent with the general link between actin function and endocytosis, which has emerged from genetic studies in yeast (15Munn A.L. Stevenson B.J. Geli M.I. Riezman H. Mol.

Many of these proteins undergo an increase in phosphorylation after stimulation of neurotransmitter release (23Wang J.K. Walaas S.I. Greengard P. J.

Because amphiphysin I contains many putative phosphorylation sites (3Lichte B. Veh R.W. Meyer H.E. Kilimann M.W. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2521-2530Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 5David C. Solimena M. De Camilli P. FEBS Lett. 1994; 351: 73-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), we investigated whether amphiphysin I as well is regulated by phosphorylation in nerve terminals. We report here that amphiphysin I is a phosphoprotein that undergoes stimulationdependent dephosphorylation in parallel with its binding proteins, dynamin I and synaptojanin I. We also show by electron microscopy that amphiphysin I partially colocalizes with dynamin I on endocytic membrane intermediates. These findings provide new evidence for the hypothesis that amphiphysin I participates in some aspects of synaptic vesicle endocytosis.DISCUSSIONThe results of this study demonstrate that in the nerve terminal amphiphysin I undergoes constitutive phosphorylation and that stimulation by depolarization produces a decrease of its state of phosphorylation. This dephosphorylation and its pharmacological properties strikingly parallel the stimulation-dependent dephosphorylation of its two binding proteins, dynamin I (25Robinson P.J. Sontag J.M. Liu J.P. Fykse E.M. Slaughter C. McMahon H. Südhof T.C. Nature. 1993; 365: 163-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar) and synaptojanin I (26McPherson P.S. Takei K. Schmid S.L. De Camilli P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30132-30139Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The dephosphorylation of all three proteins is dependent on Ca2+ influx and is inhibited by inhibitors of the Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent phosphatase calcineurin. As previously shown for dynamin I (25Robinson P.J. Sontag J.M. Liu J.P. Fykse E.M. Slaughter C. McMahon H. Südhof T.C.

Trends Neurosci. 1994; 17: 348-353Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), the dephosphorylation of amphiphysin I is reversed by repolarization. The stimulation-dependent dephosphorylation of amphiphysin I, dynamin I, and synaptojanin I strikingly contrasts with the stimulation-dependent increase in the state of phosphorylation observed for several other nerve terminal phosphoproteins (23Wang J.K. Walaas S.I. Greengard P. J. Neurosci. 1988; 8: 281-288Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) including synapsin I and II, two proteins implicated in the exocytic branch of the synaptic vesicle cycle (37De Camilli P. Benfenati F. Valtorta F. Greengard P. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1990; 6: 433-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). These observations add further support to the hypothesis that dynamin I, synaptojanin I, and amphiphysin I are physiological partners in the endocytic reaction (12Cremona O. De Camilli P. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1997; 7: 323-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar).This hypothesis is further corroborated by results of electron microscopy immunocytochemistry. Amphiphysin I was previously shown by immunofluorescence and by immunoperoxidase to be concentrated in nerve terminals (1Folli F. Solimena M. Cofiell R. Austoni M. Tallini G. Fassetta G. Bates D.

Using the higher resolution afforded by immunogold, we have now analyzed the localization of amphiphysin I on nerve terminal membranes incubated under conditions that enhance formation of endocytic intermediates. We show that the protein is partially associated with clathrin-coated membranes and dynamin-coated membrane tubules. On both structures, amphiphysin I has a scattered distribution. Thus, amphiphysin I is not a structural partner of dynamin within dynamin rings. The similar sparse distribution of amphiphysin I and dynamin I on clathrin lattices fits with the proposal (4David C. McPherson P.S. Mundigl O. De Camilli P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 331-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar, 14Shupliakov O. Low P. Grabs D. Gad H. Chen H. David C. Takei K.

This hypothesis is strongly supported by peptide injection studies (14Shupliakov O. Low P. Grabs D. Gad H. Chen H. David C. Takei K. De Camilli P. Brodin L. Science. 1997; 276: 259-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar) at the giant synapse of lamprey. Disruption of the interaction of dynamin I with amphiphysin I (and possibly other SH3 domain-containing proteins) at this synapse was found to produce a potent block of synaptic vesicle endocytosis at the level of invaginated clathrin-coated pits. The necks of these pits were not surrounded by a dynamin ring, as if dynamin recruitment or oligomerization had been impaired (14Shupliakov O. Low P. Grabs D. Gad H. Chen H. David C. Takei K. De Camilli P. Brodin L. Science. 1997; 276: 259-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar).Amphiphysin I is homologous to the yeast protein Rvs167 (5David C. Solimena M. De Camilli P. FEBS Lett. 1994; 351: 73-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), which has been implicated both in endocytosis and in actin function (6Sivadon P. Bauer F. Aigle M. Crouzet M. Mol. Gen.

Both amphiphysin I and dynamin I immunoreactivities were detectable in the cytoskeletal matrix of nerve terminals. The abundance of this immunoreactive material suggests that it does not simply represent pools of amphiphysin I and dynamin I associated with coat structures grazing into the section. This observation raises the possibility that amphiphysin I may interact with the actin cytoskeleton and suggests a link between amphiphysin I function and actin even in mammalian cells (see also Ref. 65Mundigl O. Ochoa G.C. David C. Slepnev V.I. Cabana A. De Camilli P. J. Neurosci. 1997; (in press)Google Scholar).An analysis of the amphiphysin I sequence reveals the presence of several potential phosphorylation sites for protein kinase C and casein kinase II both in the NH2-terminal coiled-coil region and in the COOH-terminal region. Our results are consistent with multisite phosphorylation of amphiphysin I and strongly suggest that calcineurin dephosphorylates the site(s) implicated in the striking electrophoretic shift of the protein. The phosphorylation-dephosphorylation of this site(s) is likely to be mediated by a cytosolic kinase in nerve terminals because it is regulated by depolarization and because the amphiphysin I doublet is enriched in synaptosomal preparations.The physiological significance of the changes in the phosphorylation state of amphiphysin I remains to be clarified. Both the upper and lower amphiphysin I bands were affinity purified by the recombinant proline-rich regions of dynamin I and synaptojanin I (data not shown). Furthermore, both bands were recovered in particulate and cytosolic fractions. Effects of phosphorylation at specific phosphorylation sites on amphiphysin I interactions need to be further investigated. Because the parallel dephosphorylations of amphiphysin I, dynamin I, and synaptojanin I occur in response to a stimulus that triggers exocytosis, and therefore compensatory endocytosis, these covalent modifications are likely to favor the endocytic reaction. In fact, dephosphorylation of dynamin I was reported to correlate with an enhanced recovery in particulate fractions (25Robinson P.J. Sontag J.M. Liu J.P. Fykse E.M. Slaughter C. McMahon H. Südhof T.C. Nature. 1993; 365: 163-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar) (possibly reflecting dynamin assembly) and with a decrease in the GTPase activity (46Liu J.P. Powell K.A. Südhof T.C. Robinson P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21043-21050Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (thus enhancing the proportion of GTP-dynamin). The state of phosphorylation of the clathrin adaptor AP2, which also binds to amphiphysin I (4David C. McPherson P.S. Mundigl O. De Camilli P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 331-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar, 13Wang L.-H. Südhof T.C. Anderson R.G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10079-10083Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), but at a site distinct from the SH3 domain (4David C. McPherson P.S. Mundigl O. De Camilli P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 331-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar), was not investigated in this study. However, it is of interest that AP2 assembly into coat structures was found to correlate with a decreased level of its state of phosphorylation (47Wilde A. Brodsky F.M. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 635-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Clearly, amphiphysin I dephosphorylation is an event that occurs upstream rather than downstream to the endocytic reaction because it occurs even when synaptic vesicle exocytosis (and therefore compensatory endocytosis) is blocked by tetanus toxin.The sensitivity of amphiphysin I dephosphorylation to calcineurin inhibitors provides new evidence for a regulatory role of this protein phosphatase in synaptic vesicle recycling. Although several studies have suggested a role of calcineurin in the regulation of the synaptic vesicle cycle, results have been contradictory (38Nichols R.A. Suplick G.R. Brown J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23817-23823Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 48Kuromi H. Yoshihara M. Kidokoro Y. Neurosci. Res. 1997; 27: 101-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 49Yakel J.L. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1997; 18: 124-134Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Our findings suggest that calcineurin is a positive regulator of synaptic vesicle endocytosis. Calcineurin, in turn, may be one of the effectors of calmodulin and Ca2+ in endocytosis. An important function of calmodulin in this process is suggested by genetic studies in yeast (50Kübler E. Schimmöller F. Riezman H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5539-5546Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) as well as by biochemical (51Creutz C.E. Harrison J.R. Nature. 1984; 308: 208-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), capacitance (52Artalejo C.R. Elhamdani A. Palfrey H.C.

Cell Biol. 1980; 87: 132-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar) in mammalian cells. The role of Ca2+in synaptic vesicle endocytosis is controversial. Some studies have suggested independence of extracellular Ca2+ (54Ryan T.A. Reuter H. Wendland B. Schweizer F.E. Tsien R.W. Smith S.J. Neuron. 1993; 11: 713-724Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar), and other studies have shown inhibition (55von Gersdorff H. Matthews G. Nature. 1994; 370: 652-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar) or delay (56Smith C.B. Betz W.J. Nature. 1996; 380: 531-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar) by high intracellular Ca2+. However, most studies have demonstrated a requirement of extracellular Ca2+ or elevation of intracellular Ca2+ (57Ceccarelli B. Hurlbut W.P. J.

In particular, a recent study at the giant reticulo-spinal synapse of the lamprey has shown that reformation of synaptic vesicles after their depletion produced by high frequency electrical stimulation is completely blocked by a prolonged depletion of extracellular Ca2+ (63Gad H. Shupliakov O. Pieribone V.A. Brodin L. Soc. Neurosci. Abstr. 1995; 21: 332Google Scholar). The parallel dephosphorylation of amphiphysin I, dynamin I, and synaptojanin I by the calcium/calmodulin-regulated protein phosphatase calcineurin may be one of the steps mediating the regulatory effects of Ca2+on synaptic vesicle endocytosis and may prime the nerve terminal for endocytic activity after a Ca2+-induced burst of exocytosis. Amphiphysin I, an autoantigen in neurological autoimmune paraneoplastic conditions (1Folli F. Solimena M. Cofiell R. Austoni M. Tallini G. Fassetta G. Bates D. Cartlidge N. Bottazzo G.F.

Grabs D. Sossin W.S. Bauerfeind R. Nemoto Y. De Camilli P. Nature. 1996; 379: 353-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). Via a distinct domain, amphiphysin I was reported to interact with the appendage domain of the plasma membrane clathrin adaptor AP2 (4David C. McPherson P.S. Mundigl O. De Camilli P. Proc. Natl.

It has therefore been suggested that amphiphysin I may be implicated in the control of synaptic vesicle endocytosis. This possibility was recently supported by experiments carried out at the giant reticulospinal synapse of the lamprey (14Shupliakov O. Low P. Grabs D. Gad H. Chen H. David C. Takei K. De Camilli P. Brodin L. Science. 1997; 276: 259-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). Injection in the presynaptic compartment of peptides that disrupt SH3-mediated interactions of dynamin, including the interaction with amphiphysin I, was shown to produce a potent inhibition of synaptic vesicle endocytosis at the stage of invaginated clathrin-coated pits. Furthermore, the SH3 domain of amphiphysin I inhibits receptor-mediated endocytosis when transfected in fibroblastic cells (64Wigge"
https://openalex.org/W2092066822,"Bad, an inducer of programmed cell death, was recently isolated from a mouse cDNA library by its ability to bind to the anti-apoptotic protein BCL-2. Sequence analysis suggested that Bad was a member of the <i>BCL</i>-2 gene family that encodes both inducers and inhibitors of programmed cell death. To further analyze the role of BAD in the network of homo- and heterodimers formed by the BCL-2 family, we have cloned the human homologue of <i>BAD</i> and assessed its biological activity and its interactions with wild type and mutant BCL-2 family proteins. Our results indicate that the human BAD protein, like its mouse homologue, is able to induce apoptosis when transfected into mammalian cells. Furthermore, in yeast two-hybrid assays as well as quantitative <i>in vitro</i> interaction assays, human Bad interacted with BCL-2 and BCL-X<sub>L</sub>. Sequence alignments of human BAD revealed the presence of a BH-3 homology domain as seen in other BCL-2 family proteins. Peptides derived from this domain were able to completely inhibit the dimerization of BAD with BCL-X<sub>L</sub>. Thus, as previously shown for BAX, BAK, BCL-2, and BCL-X<sub>L</sub>, the BH3 domain of BAD is required for its dimerization with other BCL-2 family proteins. BAD was further analyzed for its ability to bind to various mutants of BCL-2 and BCL-X<sub>L</sub> that have lost the ability to bind BAX and BAK, some of which retain biological activity and some of which do not. Surprisingly, all of the mutated BCL-2 and BCL-X<sub>L</sub> proteins analyzed strongly interacted with human BAD. Our data thus indicate that mutations in BCL-2 and BCL-X<sub>L</sub> can differentially affect the heterodimeric binding of different death-promoting proteins and have implications concerning the relationship between heterodimerization and biological activity."
https://openalex.org/W2023999919,"Thioredoxin (Trx) is a small ubiquitous protein that displays different functions mainly via redox-mediated processes. We here report the cloning of a gene (trxC) coding for a novel thioredoxin in Escherichia coli as well as the expression and characterization of its product. The gene encodes a protein of 139 amino acids (Trx2) with a calculated molecular mass of 15.5 kDa. Trx2 contains two distinct domains: an N-terminal domain of 32 amino acids including two CXXC motifs and a C-terminal domain, with the conserved active site, Trp-Cys-Gly-Pro-Cys, showing high homology to the prokaryotic thioredoxins. Trx2 together with thioredoxin reductase and NADPH is an efficient electron donor for the essential enzyme ribonucleotide reductase and is also able to reduce the interchain disulfide bridges of insulin. The apparent K m value of Trx2 for thioredoxin reductase is similar to that of the previously characterized E. coli thioredoxin (Trx1). The enzymatic activity of Trx2 as a protein-disulfide reductase is increased by preincubation with dithiothreitol, suggesting that oxidation of cysteine residues other than the ones in the active site might regulate its activity. A truncated form of the protein, lacking the N-terminal domain, is insensitive to the presence of dithiothreitol, further confirming the involvement of the additional cysteine residues in modulating Trx2 activity. In addition, the presence of the N-terminal domain appears to confer heat sensitivity to Trx2, unlike Trx1.

Oxidized thioredoxin, Trx-S2, can be reduced by NADPH and the flavoenzyme thioredoxin reductase, the so-called thioredoxin system (Reaction 1) (1Holmgren A. Annu. Rev.

In Escherichia coli, thioredoxin was first identified as an electron donor for ribonucleotide reductase (RNR), the enzyme that reduces ribonucleotides to deoxyribonucleotides for DNA synthesis and repair (2Laurent T.C. Moore E.C. Reichard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 3436-3444Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). E. coli thioredoxin can also function as a hydrogen donor for 3′-phosphoadenosine 5′-phosphosulfate reductase in the sulfate assimilation pathway as well as methionine sulfoxide reductase (3Tsang M.L.

Virol. 1974; 14: 509-516Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and analysis of these mutants led to the identification of a novel cofactor, glutaredoxin-1 (Grx1), as an efficient substitute of thioredoxin for RNR and 3′-phosphoadenosine 5′-phosphosulfate reductase enzymatic activity (20Holmgren A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 2275-2279Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar, 21Tsang M.L. J. Bacteriol. 1981; 146: 1059-1066Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, Grx1 could neither substitute for thioredoxin in methionine sulfoxide reduction nor in bacteriophage growth or assembly (5Chamberlin M. J. Virol. 1974; 14: 509-516Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Russel M. Model P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 29-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 7Lim C.J. Haller B. Fuchs J.A.

Chem. 1986; 261: 14997-15005Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which thus remained typical phenotypes of E. coli thioredoxin mutants. The isolation of an E. coli double mutant in thioredoxin/glutaredoxin-1 allowed the identification of two novel glutaredoxins, Grx2 and Grx3, but only Grx3 is able to serve as a hydrogen donor for RNR (23Miranda-Vizuete A.

Holmgren A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9813-9817Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Thus, it seemed that only one thioredoxin did exist in E. coli. However, the existence of another thioredoxin has been suggested to be necessary for the maintenance of the reducing environment in E. coli cytoplasm (25Derman A.I. Prinz W.A. Belin D. Beckwith J. Science. 1993; 262: 1744-1747Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). In addition, a triple Trx, Grx1, and Grx3 mutant was viable (26Prinz W.A. Åslund F. Holmgren A. Beckwith J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15661-15667Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar), indicating the presence of an alternative protein capable of reducing RNR in vivo. We report here the cloning of a DNA sequence coding for a novelE. coli thioredoxin (Trx2) based upon biological activity data and protein homology. We also present evidence that the protein is normally expressed in E. coli cells and that the N-terminal sequence of the protein contains a novel domain with four cysteine residues that partly regulates its enzymatic activity as protein-disulfide reductase. E. coli K-12 was a stock from our laboratory. K38 (wild type) and A179 (trxA::kan) (27Russel M. Model P. J. Bacteriol. 1984; 159: 1034-1039Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) strains were a kind gift from Prof. Arne Holmgren (Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm). Cells were grown in LB medium supplemented (when necessary) with 50 μg/ml ampicillin or kanamycin. A thioredoxin-like sequence (Trx2) containing an open reading frame coding for a protein of 139 amino acids (GenBankTMaccession number 1788936), 2The sequence is available on the World Wide Web at the server for the E. coli data base collection (http://susi.bio.uni-giessen.de/ecdc.html). was used to design the specific mutagenic primers EcTrx2-NdeI, 5′-TCCCGAGGTTACATATGAATACCGTTTG-3′ (forward), and EcTrx2-BamHI, 5′-CAAGATGGGATCCGGTAAGATTAAAGAGATTC-3′ (reverse), that introduce an NdeI site and aBamHI site at the N terminus and C terminus of the coding sequence, respectively. These primers were used to amplify E. coli K-12 genomic DNA by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with the ExpandTM Long Template PCR System (Boehringer Mannheim) (30 cycles at 94 °C for 20 s, 58 °C for 30 s, and 68 °C for 2 min, linked to a 68 °C for 30 min cycle). The PCR product was cloned into the pGEM-T Easy Vector System I (Promega) and sequenced. The insert of Trx2 cloned into the pGEM-T vector was digested with NdeI and BamHI and cloned into theNdeI/BamHI sites of the pET-15b expression vector (AMS Biotechnology). The recombinant plasmid was designated pET-Trx2.E. coli BL21 (DE3) was transformed with the pET-Trx2 construct, and a single positive colony was inoculated in 1 liter of LB medium plus ampicillin and grown at 37 °C untilA 600 = 0.5. Then fusion protein was induced by the addition of 0.5 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, and growth was continued for another 3.5 h. The cells were harvested by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min, and the pellet was resuspended in 50 ml of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Lysozyme was added to a final concentration of 0.5 mg/ml with stirring for 30 min on ice. Subsequently, MgCl2 (10 mm), MnCl2 (1 mm), DNase I (10 μg/ml), and RNase (10 μg/ml) were added, and the incubation was continued for another 45 min on ice. The cells were sonicated, and the supernatant was cleared by centrifugation at 15,000 ×g for 30 min and loaded onto a Talon Resin Column (CLONTECH). The His-Trx2 protein was eluted with 50 mm imidazole, dialyzed against 20 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, and concentrated with Centricon concentrators (Amicon Inc.), and the size and purity of His-Trx2 was determined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. When indicated, the His tag was removed by thrombin incubation. Protein concentrations were determined from the absorbance at 280 nm using a molar extinction coefficient of 14,180m−1 cm−1 for E. coliTrx1 and 17,790 m−1 cm−1 forE. coli Trx2. The truncated form of Trx2 (ΔTrx2) lacking the first 32 amino acids at the N-terminal part of the protein was amplified using the primer EcΔTrx2-NdeI 5′-GCGGTCACGACCATATGGACGGAGAGGTG-3′ as forward primer and EcTrx2-BamHI as a reverse primer. The cloning, overexpression, and purification of this truncated form was identical to that described above for the full-length one. Protein concentration was determined from the absorbance at 280 nm using a molar extinction coefficient of 13,310 m−1cm−1 for ΔTrx2. For antibody production, we used a modification of the method described by Song et al. (28Song C.S. Yu J.H. Bai D.H. Hester P.Y. Kim K.H. J. Immunol. 1985; 135: 3354-3359PubMed Google Scholar). Female chickens were injected (once every 15 days during 6 weeks) subcutaneously at multiple sites with 100 μg (in 0.25 ml) of His-Trx2 in complete adjuvant. After the second injection, eggs were collected daily, and when a suitable number of eggs were obtained antibodies were purified as follows. Egg yolks were separated from whites by dropping the egg contents on a funnel placed in a graduated cylinder. An equal volume of buffer S (10 mm phosphate, pH 7.5, 0.1 m NaCl, containing 0.01% sodium azide) was added to the yolks and stirred. Next, 10.5% PEG 8000 (Sigma) in buffer S was added to a final concentration of 3.5%. The mixture was stirred for 30 min at room temperature and centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 20 min. The supernatant was filtered through two layers of 3MM Whatman chromatography paper, and 42% PEG 8000 in buffer S was added to a final concentration of 12%. The mixture was stirred thoroughly and centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 20 min. The supernatant was discharged, and the pellet was redissolved in 12% PEG in buffer S to the original yolk volume. After centrifugation, the pellet was dissolved in 30 ml of buffer S and dialyzed overnight against buffer S without NaCl. Affinity-purified antibodies were prepared using a cyanogen bromide-activated Sepharose 4B column where 1 mg of Trx2, in which the His tag had been removed by thrombin, had been coupled following the procedure recommended by the manufacturer (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). The specificity of the antibodies was tested by Western blotting using recombinant Trx2 and total cell extracts. For immunoblotting, samples were subjected to 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and the separated proteins were electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Hybond-C Super, Amersham Corp.). The membranes were blocked with phosphate-buffered saline containing 8% dry fat-free milk powder, 2% bovine serum albumin (BSA), 150 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20 and further incubated with affinity-purified anti-Trx2 antibodies. Immunodetection was performed with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-chicken IgG (Sigma) diluted 1:5000, following the ECL protocol (Amersham). Cells were harvested atA 600 = 0.5 and washed three times in 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0. The pellet was resuspended in the same buffer plus 2 mm MgCl2 and 2 mg/ml lysozyme at an A 600 = 40, incubated for 30 min on ice, and centrifuged at 14,000 rpm at 4 °C for 1 min. The supernatant after centrifugation was collected as the periplasmic lysate fraction. The pellet was resuspended in the same volume of 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 2 mm MgCl2 and kept as the cytosolic fraction. Cells were harvested and washed as in the previous treatment. The pellet was resuspended in 50 mmTris, pH 8.0, 2 mm MgCl2 at the sameA 600 and quickly frozen in a dry ice/ethanol bath. The frozen suspension was slowly thawed in an ice bucket, and this cycle was repeated three times. The suspension was centrifuged, and periplasmic and cytosolic fractions were collected as described above. For crude bacteria extracts, exponentially growing cells were harvested by centrifugation, and the pellet was resuspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA. Cells were sonicated, and the supernatant was cleared by centrifugation for 15,000 × g at 4 °C for 30 min. Heated extracts were prepared by heating crude extracts for 5 min, placing them on ice and spinning as described above. The activity of E. coli Trx2 was determined by the DTNB and insulin assays. The DTNB assay was performed essentially as described elsewhere (29Holmgren A. Björnstedt M. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 252: 199-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (815) Google Scholar). Briefly, the reaction mix contained 200 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, 2 mm EDTA, 0.1 mg/ml BSA, 1 mm DTNB, and 0.5 mm NADPH. The reactions containing 0.5–8 μm Trx1, Trx2, or ΔTrx2 were started by the addition of 10 nm E. colithioredoxin reductase (IMCO, Sweden). The reaction was followed at 412 nm against a blank containing thioredoxin reductase in a SpectraMaxTM 250 Microplate Spectrophotometer (Molecular Devices Corp.) for 7 min at 25 °C in a final volume of 100 μl. Insulin was used to determine the protein-disulfide reductase activity of thioredoxin as described previously (29Holmgren A. Björnstedt M. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 252: 199-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (815) Google Scholar). The rate of DTNB reduction was calculated from the increase in A412 using a molar extinction coefficient of 27,200 m−1 cm−1, since reduction of DTNB by 1 mol of Trx-(SH)2 yields 2 mol of 3-carboxy-4-nitrobenzenethiol each with a molar extinction coefficient of 13,600 m−1 cm−1(29Holmgren A. Björnstedt M. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 252: 199-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (815) Google Scholar). Values of ΔA412 were multiplied by a factor of 4.3 to give the ΔA412 of a cuvette with a path length of 1 cm. Reduction by DTT was carried out by preincubation of aliquots of Trx2 at 37 °C for 20 min with 2 μl of 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 100 μg/ml BSA, and 2 mm DTT. The ability of E. coli Trx1 and Trx2 to serve as hydrogen donor for NrdAB and EF reductases was determined using the standard ribonucleotide reductase assay (30Thelander L. Eriksson S. Sjöberg B.M. Methods Enzymol. 1978; 51: 227-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Stoichiometric amounts (1 μm final concentration) of R1A/R2B and R1E (1.8 μg)/R2F (0.6 μg) were incubated for 20 min at 37 °C with Trx1 (IMCO) or Trx2 in a final volume of 50 μl containing 0.5 mm[3H]CDP (19,100 cpm/nmol), 10 mmMgCl2, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mmNADPH, 0.1 μm E. coli thioredoxin reductase, and 0.3 mm dATP (for NrdEF) or 1.5 mm ATP (for NrdAB). The reaction was stopped with 0.5 ml of HClO4, and the [3H]dCDP formed was determined by liquid scintillation after ion exchange chromatography on Dowex 50 columns. One enzyme unit is the activity that produces 1 nmol of dCDP during 1 min under these conditions. The identification of a novel thioredoxin sequence in the E. coli genome appeared serendipitously when using the recently described mammalian Trx2 (31Spyrou G. Enmark E. Miranda-Vizuete A. Gustafsson J.-Å. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2936-2941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar) cDNA as probe in a Northern blot analysis with E. coligenomic DNA as a negative control. The strong signal obtained (data not shown) prompted us to search for the tentative E. colihomologue of the mammalian Trx2. We identified a DNA sequence in theE. coli genome (not completed at the time of this search) that displayed high homology with mammalian Trx2, but when translated to protein in the three possible reading frames only short peptide sequences were obtained. These short peptide sequences could be due to a possible sequencing mistake (an additional deoxycytidine) that, when removed, resulted in an open reading frame of 417 base pairs encoding a protein of 139 amino acids with the typical thioredoxin active site WCGPC. To further confirm the existence of this sequence coding for a new thioredoxin in the E. coli genome, we used two primers, EcTrx2-NdeI and EcTrx2-BamHI (see “Materials and Methods”) to amplify a fragment of 420 base pairs from genomicE. coli K-12 DNA. This PCR fragment was further cloned into pGEM-T Easy vector, and sequencing confirmed the absence of the additional deoxycytidine. The sequence of the Trx2 is positioned at min 58.5 in the E. coli chromosome map downstream of the uracyl DNA glycosylase gene. The nucleotide sequence of the E. coli Trx2 gene and flanking regions is given in Fig. 1 together with the deduced amino acid sequence. The open reading frame extends from the methionine codon, ATG, at coordinate +1 to the termination codon, TAA, at coordinate 417. This region codes for a protein of 139 amino acids with a estimated molecular mass of 15.5 kDa, containing the classical active site of thioredoxins WCGPC. The methionine +1 codon is preceded by a potential ribosome binding site at position −9 including six out of nine bases of the consensus ribosome binding sequence (32Chen H. Bjerknes M. Kumar R. Jay E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4953-4957Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar) and an upstream in frame TAA stop codon. There is a putative −10 region centered at position −73 that conforms quite well to the consensus Pribnow box ofE. coli. If we assume a standard 16–18-base pair spacing region, a putative −35 region, TTGTCT, can be defined (Fig. 1). The DNA sequence following the coding part of the Trx2 gene contains a putative transcriptional Rho-independent terminator detected as an inverted repeat of 10 nucleotides followed by a stretch of T bases (33Rosenberg M. Court D. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1979; 13: 319-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (1701) Google Scholar). This is followed by another open reading frame of 723 nucleotides coding for a putative 27-kDa protein with no clear homology with any other protein in the data base. The main difference in Trx2 protein sequence with respect to the well known Trx1 is the presence of an extra stretch of 32 amino acids at the N terminus. The C-terminal half of the protein contains the active site found in all thioredoxins (Fig. 2). Recently, Lim et al. (34Lim C.J. Sa J.H. Fuchs J.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1307: 13-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar) have described a third thioredoxin inCorynebacterium nephridii, which displays a similar structure to E. coli Trx2 with an extra N-terminal domain of 32 amino acids and a C-terminal domain homologous to the rest of the prokaryotic thioredoxins (Fig. 2). E. coli Trx2 displays a 29% identity with E. coli Trx1 and 37% with C. nephridii Trx3 and is less similar to the mammalian Trx1 and Trx2. A phylogenetic analysis of several thioredoxins places E. coli Trx2 and C. nephridii Trx3 in the same branch of the tree between E. coli Trx1 and mammalian Trx2 (data not shown). To establish that the putative Trx2 does in fact encode a protein with thioredoxin activity, we cloned the Trx2 gene into the pET-15b expression vector under the control of a T7 promoter. The resulting plasmid pET-Trx2 was transformed in E. coli BL21 (DE3), and the expression of His-Trx2 was induced by the addition of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 3.5 h. The recombinant protein was expressed to levels of approximately 20% of the total soluble protein and was purified almost to homogeneity by affinity chromatography with a Talon column (Fig.3, inset). Recombinant Trx2 (with or without the His tag) was used to examine the reduction of insulin, a classical assay in which thioredoxin catalyzes disulfide reduction of insulin in a coupled reaction with NADPH in the presence of E. coli thioredoxin reductase. As shown in Fig. 3, oxidized Trx2 was active as a disulfide reductase; however, it exhibited approximately 5-fold lower activity than Trx1 at concentrations between 0.2 and 0.5 μm and 1.5–2-fold lower activity between 0.5 and 2 μm. At these higher thioredoxin concentrations, the efficiency of thioredoxin reductase is the rate-limiting step, since the reactivity of Trx-(SH2) and insulin is known to be very fast (35Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 9113-9119Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 9627-9632Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To understand the role of the extra cysteines present at the N terminus of Trx2, we preincubated Trx2 with DTT. As shown in Fig.4, the ability of Trx2 to reduce insulin was increased to levels similar to that of Trx1 (compare with Fig. 3). The fact that Trx2 activity was enhanced after reduction of the protein suggested that cysteine residues in Trx2 other than those in the active site could be involved in regulating its enzymatic activity. We used the truncated form of Trx2 (ΔTrx2) lacking the N-terminal portion, including the four cysteine residues, to further test this possibility. Fig. 4 shows that ΔTrx2 has thioredoxin activity independent of DTT reduction, similar to Trx1. Furthermore, the activity is similar to the reduced Trx2 and higher than the one displayed by the full-length oxidized protein, indicating that the N-terminal portion of the protein partly regulates the activity of Trx2. DTNB is an artificial disulfide substrate and a fast oxidant of Trx-(SH)2, which keeps the concentration of Trx-S2 constant. DTNB is often used in the assay of thioredoxin reductase, where one molecule of DTNB is split into two 5′-thionitrobenzoic acid molecules by reduced Trx1 (1Holmgren A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 237-271Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The DTNB assay and low concentrations (10 nm) of thioredoxin reductase to obtain saturation Michaelis-Menten kinetics were used to calculate theK m of Trx2 for E. coli thioredoxin reductase at pH 7.0 and 25 °C. The values obtained were used to calculate the k cat as well as thek cat/K m or apparent second order rate constant for the reaction between thioredoxin reductase and Trx-S2. The K m value for Trx2 and thek cat/K m were similar to Trx1. The ΔTrx2 has a lower K m value, and thek cat is approximately halved. TableI shows the comparison of Trx1 and Trx2 kinetic parameters.Table IKinetics parameters of Trx1 and Trx2 for thioredoxin reductaseK mK catk cat/K mμms −1m −1 s −1Trx11.9 ± 0.211.3 ± 0.66.3 × 106Trx22.4 ± 0.412.8 ± 1.05.4 × 106Δ Trx21.5 ± 0.16.5 ± 0.54.7 × 106The assay was carried out as described under “Materials and Methods.” Three separate measurements were made for each protein, and the mean value derived from Lineweaver-Burk plots of 1/[S]versus 1/V is shown.

E. coli contains genetic information for three different ribonucleotide reductases. The NrdAB is active during aerobiosis. NrdDG is active during anaerobiosis and uses formate as an electron donor. NrdEF is a cryptic enzyme that uses Grx1 but not Trx1 as an electron donor (37Fontecave M. Nordlund P. Eklund H. Reichard P. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol.

https://openalex.org/W2042141509,"Human multidrug resistance protein (MRP) was expressed at high levels in stably transfected baby hamster kidney (BHK-21) cells. These cells exhibited a pattern of cross-resistance to several different drugs typical of an MRP-mediated phenotype despite the addition of 10 histidine residues at the C terminus to facilitate purification. Consistent with this functional evidence of the presence of MRP at the surface of these transfectants, strong signals were detected by immunoblotting and immunofluorescence using a specific monoclonal antibody to MRP. There was intense uniform staining of the cell surface as well as weaker staining of intracellular membranes. MRP-containing membranes were solubilized in 1%N-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside in the presence of 0.4% sheep brain phospholipids. Two sequential affinity purification steps on Ni-NTA agarose and wheat germ agglutinin agarose provided substantial enrichment, and contaminating bands were not detected. ATPase activity of the purified protein was assayed in the presence of the phospholipids, which had been maintained throughout all purification steps. ATP was hydrolyzed in proportion to the amount of purified protein assayed, and typical Michaelis-Menten behavior was exhibited, yielding estimations of K m of ∼3.0 mm and V max of 0.46 μmol mg−1 min−1. This activity was moderately stimulated by the drugs that others have shown to be transported by MRP-containing membrane vesicles. This stimulation was enhanced by reduced glutathione as is its drug transport, and oxidized glutathione, itself a substrate for transport, caused a strong stimulation.

Results of these studies are consistent with the notion that the protein brings about the active export of a number of anti-tumor drugs provided that intracellular glutathione is present (12Zaman G.J.

More recently, cDNAs have been cloned for several so-called multispecific organic anion transporters, and their sequences indicate that they are homologs of MRP (22Paulusma C.C. Bosma P.J. Zaman G.J.

Liver Dis. 1996; 16: 211-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The sequences of these molecules indicate that they all contain two nucleotide binding domains, and their transport functions require ATP. Therefore, they may all be transport ATPases. However, although ATP has been shown to bind to MRP (24Almquist K.C. Loe D.W. Hipfner D.R. Mackie J.E. Cole S.P. Deeley R.G. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 102-110PubMed Google Scholar), ATPase activity has not yet been demonstrated for any of the MRP or multispecific organic anion transporters, indeed none of the proteins have yet been purified. To fill these gaps in our understanding of MRP, we have cloned its cDNA in a plasmid (pNUT; Ref. 25Palmiter R.D. Behringer R.R. Quaife C.J. Maxwell F. Maxwell I.H. Brinster R.L. Cell. 1987; 50: 435-443Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar) enabling high level stable expression in mammalian cells, generating sufficient protein for purification to homogeneity and assay of ATPase activity in a lipid environment in the absence and presence of compounds that it is able to transport.

Oligonucleotides were synthesized by the Molecular Biology Core of Mayo Clinic Arizona. 2 μg of total RNA isolated from the J2C Hela cell line selected for doxorubicin resistance by R. Baker (SUNY, Buffalo) was used as template in reverse transcription. Oligo(dT)12–18 was used as primer for the first strand cDNA synthesis. The reverse transcription was performed according to the manufacturer's recommendation (Life Technologies, Inc., AMV reverse transcriptase system). As shown in Fig.1, the following primers were used to amplify individual MRP cDNA fragments according to the original sequence of Cole et al.(1Cole S.P. Bhardwaj G. Gerlach J.H. Mackie J.E. Grant C.E. Almquist K.C. Stewart A.J. Kurz E.U. Duncan A.M. Deeley R.G.

These PCR-amplified fragments were cloned into pBluescript, digested with the restriction endonucleases indicated in Fig. 1, and ligated together to generate a complete MRP cDNA (from nucleotide 197 to nucleotide 4824) (1Cole S.P. Bhardwaj G. Gerlach J.H. Mackie J.E. Grant C.E. Almquist K.C. Stewart A.J. Kurz E.U. Duncan A.M. Deeley R.G. Science. 1992; 258: 1650-1654Crossref PubMed Scopus (2995) Google Scholar). This MRP cDNA was sequenced completely. To facilitate the purification of MRP, we inserted sequence coding for 10 histidine residues before the stop codon. Two primers were used in the PCR reaction to insert the 10 His residues: MRPm (CCT GTT TGC GGT GAT CTC CA) and MRP/His/3′ (TGA TAT CTA GTG ATG GTG ATG GTG ATG GTG ATG GTG ATG CAC CAA GCC GGC GTC TTT GGC). The sequences of this fragment generated by PCR were fully verified after its insertion in the MRP cDNA. This modified full-length MRP cDNA with 10 C-terminal histidine residues was inserted into the pNUT expression vector, which we have employed previously (26Chang X.B. Tabcharani J.A. Hou Y.X.

Baby hamster kidney (BHK-21) cells were cultured at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Subconfluent cells were transfected with pNUT-MRP/His in the presence of 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.05), 137 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 0.7 mm Na2HPO4, 6 mm dextrose, and 125 mm CaCl2(26Chang X.B. Tabcharani J.A.

The cells were shocked 5 h later with 25% glycerol. After a further 24 h, 500 μm methotrexate was added to the medium. Cells continued to grow in the selective medium for about 10 days. Surviving individual colonies were picked and amplified in the selective medium. To detect MRP expression in BHK cells by immunofluorescence, cells grown on coverslips were fixed in 70% cold methanol for 10 min. The cells were subsequently permeabilized in 1% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline at room temperature for 5 min and blocked with 0.5% goat serum. The permeabilized cells were incubated with the rat monoclonal antibody MRPr1 (27Flens M.J. Izquierdo M.A. Scheffer G.L. Fritz J.M. Meijer C.J. Scheper R.J. Zaman G.J. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 4557-4563PubMed Google Scholar) at room temperature for 60 min. After rinsing several times, the cells were incubated with goat anti-rat antibody-fluorochrome conjugates. To detect MRP protein in whole cell lysates by immunoblotting, cultures grown up from individual colonies were lysed with 1% SDS, and DNA was sheared by cycling through a 30-gauge needle before SDS-PAGE (6% polyacrylamide gel). The sheared cell lysate was mixed with sample buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE. Amounts of lysate protein loaded are indicated in the figure legends. The samples (after electrophoresis) were electroblotted to nitrocellulose membrane and probed with the rat anti-MRP monoclonal antibody MRPr1. The secondary antibody was anti-rat Ig conjugated with horseradish peroxidase. Chemiluminescent film detection was performed according to the manufacturer's recommendations. The resistance of MRP/His expressing cells to anticancer agents was tested using the MTT assay (28Cole S.P. Downes H.F. Slovak M.L. Br. J. Cancer. 1989; 59: 42-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Briefly, the parental BHK cells or the MRP-expressing BHK cells were plated in a volume of 200 μl at 2.5 × 104 cells per well in 96-well plates. After incubation at 37 °C overnight, the media were replaced with fresh media containing different concentrations of drugs. The cells were incubated for a further 4 days. At the end of drug exposure, media containing 0.5 mg/ml MTT were added to the wells, and the plates were incubated for an additional 4 h. The media were removed, and the plates were dried overnight. 200 μl of isopropanol:1 N HCl (24:1) were added to solubilize the formazan crystals at 37 °C for 1 h, and then the absorbance at 570 nm was determined. IC50 was defined as being the dose of drug that reduced this absorbance to 50% of control values. A crude membrane fraction was prepared from BHK cells expressing MRP/His by homogenizing them in a cold (4 °C) hypotonic buffer A containing 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4). Nuclei were removed by centrifugation at 300 × gfor 15 min. Membranes were collected at 31,000 × g for 30 min. The pellet was resuspended in buffer B (0.6 ml/15-cm-diameter dish) containing 20 mm Tris/HCl (pH 7.9), 300 mm NaCl, 5 mm imidazole, 1% (w/v)n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside (DDM), 20% glycerol, and 0.4% sheep brain lipid. The sample was sonicated, and the insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 10,000 ×g for 15 min. The supernatant was applied onto a His.Bind Resin column, which had been pre-equilibrated with buffer B. The column was then washed with 6 column volumes of buffer B containing 0.1% DDM and 25 mm imidazole. The column was washed once more with 6 column volumes of buffer B containing 0.1% DDM and 40 mmimidazole. The protein was eluted with 2 column volumes of buffer B containing 0.1% DDM and 300 mm imidazole. The eluate was diluted with an equal volume of buffer C containing 50 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.4), 2 mm MgCl2, 20% glycerol, 0.4% sheep brain lipid, and 0.2% β-mercaptoethanol. The diluted sample was mixed with buffer C pre-equilibrated wheat germ lectin Sepharose 6MB and shaken for 2 h. The wheat germ lectin Sepharose 6MB beads were packed into a small column and washed with 10 column volumes of buffer C. The bound proteins were eluted with 2 column volumes of buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 20% glycerol, 0.4% sheep brain lipid, and 0.3 m N-acetylglucosamine. ATPase activity was assayed employing the methods of Gibson et al. (29Gibson S.L. al-Shawi M.K. Senior A.E. Hile R. Photochem. Photobiol. 1995; 61: 390-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Briefly, the reaction buffer (40 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mmMgCl2), [γ-32P]ATP (1 μCi), and ATP (2 mm or as otherwise indicated in the figure legends) was placed in an ice bath and mixed with transported substrates where indicated. The purified MRP protein was added last, mixed well, transferred to a 37 °C water bath, and incubated for 1 h. The reaction was stopped by adding 20 reaction volumes of ice-cold stop buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 2 mmKH2PO4, 9 mm ATP, 5.6 mm MgSO4, and 8.2% HClO4. The released Pi was precipitated with 21 reaction volumes of ice-cold precipitation solution containing 3% (w/v) ammonium molybdate, 67 mm HCl, 1% (v/v) triethylamine, and 1% (v/v) bromine water. After incubation on ice for 20 min, the precipitate was separated from supernatant by centrifugation in a microfuge for 5 min. The supernatant was transferred to a scintillation vial, and the pellet was then washed once with 1 ml of 1 NHCl. The pellet was dissolved in 0.6 ml of 1 N NaOH and transferred to another scintillation vial. The amounts of32P radioactivity in supernatant and pellet were counted separately, and specific ATPase activity was calculated. Sequencing on both strands of the full-length cDNA generated from Hela cell RNA as described under “Experimental Procedures” and Fig.1 indicated identity with the human MRP sequence originally determined by Cole et al. (1Cole S.P. Bhardwaj G. Gerlach J.H. Mackie J.E. Grant C.E. Almquist K.C. Stewart A.J. Kurz E.U. Duncan A.M. Deeley R.G. Science. 1992; 258: 1650-1654Crossref PubMed Scopus (2995) Google Scholar) except for single nucleotide substitutions at nine positions. These differences and the resulting amino acid changes are as follows: Thr434to Gly (L80V), Cys546 to Thr (T117M), Cys1304 to Gly (L370V), Thr1880 to Cys (L582L), Thr2250 to Cys (L685S), Ala2283 to Gly (D696G), Cys4040 to Gly and Gly4041 to Cys (R1282A), and Gly4732 to Ala (S1512S). The changes underlined were also found by Zaman et al. (10Zaman G.J. Flens M.J. van Leusden M.R. de Haas M. Mulder H.S. Lankelma J. Pinedo H.M. Scheper R.J. Baas F. Broxterman H.J. et al.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8822-8826Crossref PubMed Scopus (697) Google Scholar) in a cDNA synthesized with RNA from a human tumor cell line as template for reverse transcription. L685S and R1282A changes were also found by Stride et al. (31Stride B.D. Valdimarsson G. Gerlach J.H. Wilson G.M. Cole S.P. Deeley R.G. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 49: 962-971PubMed Google Scholar). The locations of the amino acid changes with respect to the putative domain structure and membrane topology are as follows. The first two, L80V and T117M fall within the 220-residue N-terminal extension, which distinguishes MRP and some other organic ion transporters from members of the superfamily such as P-glycoprotein and CFTR; however, no specific function has yet been assigned to this putative domain (30Tusnady G.E. Bakos E. Varadi A. Sarkadi B. FEBS Lett. 1997; 402: 1-3Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). L370V represents a conservative hydrophobic replacement in TM2 of the currently favored topology model (31Stride B.D. Valdimarsson G. Gerlach J.H. Wilson G.M. Cole S.P. Deeley R.G. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 49: 962-971PubMed Google Scholar). L685S is immediately C-terminal of the Walker A lysine residue of NBF1; interestingly, a hydroxyl amino acid is frequently found at this position in the P-loop of other ATPases (32Riordan J.R. Rommens J.M. Kerem B.-S. Alon N. Rozmahel R. Grzelczak Z. Zielenski J. Lok S. Plavsic N. Choug J.-L. Drumm M.L. Iannuzzi M.C. Collins F.S. Tsui L.-C. Science. 1989; 245: 1066-1073Crossref PubMed Scopus (5908) Google Scholar). Similarly, an acidic residue is sometimes present in these other molecules at the position comparable with the D696G change. It is difficult to speculate on the possible significance of the R1282A substitution because positively charged residues usually are present at this position in the hydrophilic region between the last TM and NBF2. In fact, some of these nucleotide substitutions could just reflect PCR or other cloning artifacts or polymorphisms among the individuals from which the RNA originated. Regardless of their basis, the potential consequences of amino acid changes were of primary concern in the present context. Therefore, it was important to demonstrate that the cDNA imparted drug resistance on cells into which it was transfected. Functional testing was also essential to detect any possible deleterious effects of the C-terminally added 10 histidine residues. When examined by immunofluorescence (Fig. 2 A), stable transfectants of BHK cells stained strongly with an MRP-specific monoclonal antibody (MRPr1) (27Flens M.J. Izquierdo M.A. Scheffer G.L. Fritz J.M. Meijer C.J. Scheper R.J. Zaman G.J. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 4557-4563PubMed Google Scholar). Greatest intensity is observed at the cell surface but also in association with intracellular membranes including the perinuclear region, which may represent the Golgi apparatus as well as some more diffuse reticular structures typical of the endoplasmic reticulum. Untransfected BHK cells were essentially unstained (Fig. 2 B). Western blots (Fig. 2 C) of lysates of the same clonal MRP-expressing BHK cells stained in Fig.2 A revealed a single strong MRPr1 antibody-reactive band with an apparent molecular mass of approximately 190 kDa, similar to that seen in other MRP-expressing cells (24Almquist K.C. Loe D.W. Hipfner D.R. Mackie J.E. Cole S.P. Deeley R.G. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 102-110PubMed Google Scholar, 33Ma L. Krishnamachary N. Center M.S. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 3338-3343Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). MRP was not detected in a lysate of the parental BHK cells nor was their endogenous gene amplified or induced during the methotrexate selection because it was also not detected in BHK cell transfectants similarly selected for CFTR expression. Its expression was readily detected with the CFTR-specific antibody M3A7 (34Kartner N. Augustinas O. Jensen T.J. Naismith A.L. Riordan J.R. Nat. Genet. 1992; 1: 321-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar) as shown in Fig. 2 D. P-glycoprotein expression could not be detected in similar blots of any of the three cell lines used in Fig. 2 (not shown). To determine whether MRP is functional in these BHK cells, their survival when grown in the continued presence of several cancer drugs was measured employing the MTT assay (28Cole S.P. Downes H.F. Slovak M.L. Br. J. Cancer. 1989; 59: 42-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). As indicated in TableI, the MRP-expressing cells were approximately 5-fold more resistant to colchicine than untransfected BHK cells, 5-to-10-fold in the case of the anthracyclines, doxorubicin and daunomycin, and more than 20-fold more resistant to vincristine. Although not as highly resistant as tumor cells actively selected from survival in these agents (2Mirski S.E. Gerlach J.H. Cole S.P. Cancer Res. 1987; 47: 2594-2598PubMed Google Scholar, 35Cole S.P. Cancer Chemother. Pharmacol. 1990; 26: 250-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), these BHK cells do exhibit a cross-resistance pattern typical of MRP overexpressing variants of several different cell types (8Grant C.E.

Resistance factor was calculated as IC50 of BHKMRP/IC50 of BHK. A crude microsomal membrane fraction containing a large proportion of the human MRP expressed in BHK cells was employed as starting material. To solubilize the protein from these membranes, the non-ionic detergent,n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside, was effective in either the presence or absence of added phospholipids. Because of the requirement of P-glycoprotein ATPase activity for phospholipids (37Urbatsch I.L. al-Shawi M.K. Senior A.E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7069-7076Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar,38Sharom F.J. Yu X. Chu J.W. Doige C.A. Biochem.

Fig.3 illustrates the fractionation of total membranes and MRP during the two-step purification. Under the conditions of loading and washing of Ni-NTA agarose beads, which were arrived at empirically (see “Experimental Procedures”), the MRP/His was quantitatively bound and, upon elution with elevated imidazole (lane 5), was already very highly enriched and readily detectable by Coomassie Blue staining. However, when the gel was loaded to allow detection at this level, the presence of multiple additional bands was observed. The N-linked oligosaccharide chains demonstrated to be present on MRP (24Almquist K.C. Loe D.W. Hipfner D.R. Mackie J.E. Cole S.P. Deeley R.G. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 102-110PubMed Google Scholar) made the use of the lectin-affinity chromatography an obvious choice for further purification. When the MRP-containing material eluted from the Ni-NTA agarose was applied to wheat germ lectin Sepharose, not all MRP was bound. Some was detectable in both the flow-through (lane 6) and wash (lane 7). However, a larger proportion did bind specifically via N-acetylglucosamine-containing determinants and was eluted by a high concentration of this monosaccharide (lane 8).

Current studies demonstrate that the PI 3-K inhibitor wortmannin inhibits both basal and insulin-stimulated PI 3-K activities. Wortmannin and LY 294002, two structurally distinct PI 3-K inhibitors, prevent insulin-dependent inhibition of apoB secretion in a dose-dependent manner.To link PI 3-K activation to insulin action on apoB, we investigated whether insulin induced localization of activated PI 3-K to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where apoB biogenesis is initiated. Insulin action results in a significant redistribution of PI 3-K to a low density microsome (LDM) fraction containing apoB protein and apoB mRNA. Insulin stimulates a significant increase in PI 3-K activity associated with insulin receptor substrate-1 as well as an increase in insulin receptor substrate-1/PI 3-K mass in LDM. Subfractionation of LDM on sucrose density gradients shows that insulin significantly increases the amount of PI 3-K present in an ER fraction containing apoB. Insulin stimulates PI 3-K activity in smooth and rough microsomes isolated from rat hepatocytes, the latter of which contain rough ER as demonstrated by electron microscopy. Studies indicate that 1) PI 3-K activity is necessary for insulin-dependent inhibition of apoB secretion by rat hepatocytes; 2) insulin action leads to the activation and localization of PI 3-K in an ER fraction containing apoB; and 3) insulin stimulates PI 3-K activity in the rough ER. Insulin inhibits apolipoprotein B (apoB) secretion by primary rat hepatocytes through activation of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI 3-K).

Chem. 1994; 269: 3568-3573Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, PI 3-K activation is required for insulin-dependent inhibition of apoB secretion by rat hepatocytes (22Sparks J.D. Phung T.L. Bolognino M. Sparks C.E. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 567-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar).Although insulin and platelet-derived growth factor stimulate a similar increase in PI 3-K activity, only insulin causes a substantial increase in glucose transport, lipogenesis, and glycogen synthesis in adipocytes (23Wiese R.J.

Skolnik E.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10247-10251Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). This indicates that PI 3-K activation is necessary but not sufficient to elicit insulin-specific metabolic responses. Insulin and platelet-derived growth factor have been shown to differentially regulate PI 3-K by recruitment of the enzyme to specific intracellular sites (25Navé B.T. Haigh R.J. Hayward A.C. Siddle K. Shepherd P.S. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 55-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 26Ricort J.-M. Tanti J.-F. Obberghen E. Le Marchand-Brustel Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 239: 17-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Furthermore, PI 3-K activation is necessary for insulin-induced translocation of GLUT 4 transporters (19Okada T. Kawano Y. Sakakibara T. Hazeki O. Ui M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3568-3573Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Clarke J.F. Young P.W. Yonezawa K. Kasuga M. Holman G.D. Biochem. J. 1994; 300: 631-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar), and PI 3-K has been shown to localize in vesicles containing GLUT 4 transporters (27Heller-Harrison R.A. Morin M. Guilherme A. Czech M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10200-10204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that both activation of PI 3-K and localization of the active enzyme to a specific subcellular compartment are necessary to selectively elicit metabolic responses to insulin.Current studies extend previous observations, which indicate that activation of PI 3-K by insulin is required in the regulation of apoB secretion by insulin in rat hepatocytes (22Sparks J.D. Phung T.L. Bolognino M. Sparks C.E. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 567-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Wortmannin inhibits basal and insulin-stimulated PI 3-K activities without interfering with insulin-induced association of IRS-1 with PI 3-K. Wortmannin and LY 294002, two chemically distinct PI 3-K inhibitors, prevent insulin-dependent inhibition of apoB secretion in a dose-dependent manner. To link PI 3-K activation to insulin action on apoB metabolism, we investigated whether insulin induced the localization of activated PI 3-K to an intracellular compartment involved in apoB biogenesis. Results indicate that PI 3-K activity is necessary for insulin-dependent inhibition of apoB secretion by rat hepatocytes and that insulin action leads to the activation and localization of PI 3-K in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Localization of PI 3-K in the ER correlates with the site of insulin action on apoB.DISCUSSIONInsulin-dependent inhibition of apoB secretion by rat hepatocytes can be blocked by wortmannin, an inhibitor of PI 3-K activity, indicating that insulin action on apoB requires PI 3-K activation (22Sparks J.D. Phung T.L. Bolognino M. Sparks C.E. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 567-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Current studies were performed to further characterize the effect of wortmannin on apoB secretion and to extend studies using the PI 3-K inhibitor, LY 294002 with different inhibitory specificities than wortmannin. We compared the ability of wortmannin and LY 294002 to alter insulin action on apoB secretion by rat hepatocytes. Wortmannin inhibits basal and insulin-stimulated PI 3-K activities without interfering with insulin-induced association of IRS-1 with PI 3-K. Wortmannin prevents insulin-dependent inhibition in apoB secretion in a dose-dependent manner. Results using wortmannin were confirmed with studies using LY 294002, which specifically inhibits PI 3-K activity, but not the activities of a number of other protein and lipid kinases including protein kinase C, protein kinase A, S6 kinase, mitogen-activated protein kinase, and phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase (41Vlahos C.J. Matter W.F. Hui K.Y. Brown R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5241-5248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Together, results indicate that activation of PI 3-K by insulin is necessary in the regulation of apoB secretion by insulin.PI 3-K activation alone may be necessary, but not sufficient to mediate insulin-dependent inhibition of apoB secretion by rat hepatocytes. Both insulin and epidermal growth factor activate PI 3-K (10Brown A.H. Gutowski S. Moomaw C.R. Slaughter C. Sternweis P.C. Cell. 1993; 75: 1137-1144Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (820) Google Scholar, 54Bjorge J.D. Chan T.-O. Antczak M. Kung H.-J. Fujita D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Metabolism. 1994; 43: 681-690Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Recent studies suggest that both activation of PI 3-K and localization of the active enzyme to a specific subcellular compartment are required to selectively elicit metabolic responses to insulin (23Wiese R.J.

Biochem. 1996; 239: 17-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). PI 3-K activation is necessary for insulin-induced translocation of GLUT 4 transporters to the plasma membrane (19Okada T. Kawano Y. Sakakibara T. Hazeki O. Ui M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3568-3573Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Clarke J.F. Young P.W. Yonezawa K. Kasuga M. Holman G.D. Biochem. J. 1994; 300: 631-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar), and PI 3-K has been shown to localize in vesicles containing GLUT 4 transporters (27Heller-Harrison R.A. Morin M. Guilherme A. Czech M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10200-10204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). In the absence of growth factor stimulation, localization of PI 3-K to the membrane alone is sufficient to induce PI 3-K-dependent responses, including activation of the downstream effectors p70 ribosomal protein S6 kinase, protein kinase B (also called Akt), and Jun N-terminal kinase (55Klippel A. Reinhard C. Kavanaugh M. Apell G. Escobedo M.-A. Williams L.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4117-4127Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar).For PI 3-K to mediate insulin action on apoB secretion, we hypothesize that PI 3-K must extend its effects to the secretory compartment. This hypothesis is the basis for further studies to identify insulin-dependent localization of PI 3-K to the ER, where apoB biogenesis is initiated. We chose a rapid subcellular fractionation technique (30Kelly K.L. Ruderman N.B. Chen K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3423-3428Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 43Kelly K.L. Ruderman N.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4391-4398Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to test this hypothesis because fractions can be isolated without apparent dephosphorylation of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins or loss of PI 3-K activity. In addition, using this method, we have demonstrated intact apoB protein (Fig. 3) and apoB mRNA (data not shown). Studies show that insulin induces a significant redistribution of PI 3-K to an LDM fraction containing apoB protein and apoB mRNA. Insulin stimulates a significant increase in PI 3-K activity associated with IRS-1 as well as an increase in IRS-1·PI 3-K mass in LDM. Subfractionation of LDM on sucrose density gradients indicates that insulin action significantly increases the amount of PI 3-K present in an ER fraction containing apoB. To distinguish more precisely the region of the ER where this activity is found, insulin-stimulated PI 3-K activity was measured in smooth and rough microsomes isolated from hepatocytes according to a classical procedure (34Depierre J. Dallner G. Maddy A.H. Biochemical Analysis of Membranes. Chapman & Hall, London1976: 79-131Google Scholar). Insulin stimulates PI 3-K activity in both smooth and rough microsomes, the latter of which contain rough ER as demonstrated by electron microscopy. Together, results indicate that insulin stimulates PI 3-K activity in the rough ER and that insulin action leads to the activation and localization of PI 3-K in the ER compartment that is also shown to contain apoB.ApoB is an unique secretory protein in that, unlike other secretory proteins such as albumin, apoB secretion is regulated by insulin (1Sparks J.D. Sparks C.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1215: 9-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar,56Sparks J.D. Sparks C.E. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1993; 4: 177-186Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar). ApoB is synthesized in the ER and assembles with lipids before its secretion as a component of VLDL. Although additional action of PI 3-K in later vesicular trafficking cannot be ruled out, there appears to be a requirement for PI 3-K in targeting of apoB for degradation in an early stage of assembly. This is consistent with studies indicating that insulin interferes with the assembly of VLDL as denser apoB-containing lipoproteins continue to be secreted in the presence of insulin (57Björnsson O.G. Duerden J.M. Bartlett S.M. Sparks J.D. Sparks C.E. Gibbons G.F. Biochem. J. 1992; 281: 381-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The observation that insulin increases the amount of PI 3-K present in an ER compartment containing apoB suggests that localization of PI 3-K may be important in insulin action on apoB. Current studies indicate that IRS-1 plays a role in the localization of p85, since increases in p85 mass and PI 3-K activity were demonstrated following IRS-1 immunoprecipitations. Our data cannot rule out additional roles of other IRS-like molecules in PI 3-K-targeting events. Further studies will be necessary to delineate the kinetics of movement of IRS-1, PI 3-K, and other IRS molecules to the ER following insulin stimulation.Characterization of subcellular fractions from rat hepatocytes based on organelle marker proteins shows that most ER marker proteins are present in HDM and LDM, and most Golgi marker proteins are in PLS (Fig.2). Assuming that the distribution of organelle markers correctly reflects the distribution of ER- and Golgi-derived membranes, the results indicate that HDM and LDM are enriched in ER membranes, and PLS is enriched in Golgi membranes. However, using a similar fractionation method in rat adipocytes, other laboratories reported that HDM is enriched in ER membranes, while LDM is enriched in Golgi membranes, with significant cross-contamination of ER and Golgi marker enzymes between HDM and LDM (30Kelly K.L. Ruderman N.B. Chen K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3423-3428Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 58Simpson I.A. Yver D.R. Hissin P.J. Wardzala L.J. Karnieli E. Salans L.B. Cushman S.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 763: 393-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). Disparities in organelle marker distribution observed in our studies and those of others may reflect differences in the cellular composition of hepatocytes and adipocytes and in fractionation of whole tissue versus isolated cells. It is also possible that homogenization of cells in the absence of RNase inhibitors may alter characteristics of the subcellular fractions obtained.Immunoblot analysis of apoB distribution in subcellular fractions show that, on average, 95% of cellular apoB48 and 91% of cellular apoB100 are recovered in HDM plus LDM (Fig. 3). Thus, most cellular apoB isolated by this fractionation procedure is located in ER-enriched fractions. This finding is consistent with results previously reported in cultured hepatocytes and in liver, where 60–90% of apoB is localized in the ER (59Cartwright I.J. Higgins J.A. Biochem. J. 1992; 285: 153-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 60Wong L. Pino R.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 164: 357-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 61Borchardt R.A. Davis R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 16394-16402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Most apoB mRNA is present in HDM and LDM, with 70% of apoB mRNA found in LDM. The finding of most apoB mRNA in LDM may relate to the aberrant sedimentation velocity of apoB mRNA, since hepatic apoB polysomes sediment just after monosomes and not with polysomes (62Chen X. Sparks J.D. Yao Z. Fisher E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21007-21013Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The aberrant sedimentation velocity is observed in apoB polysomes isolated in the presence and absence of detergents, indicating that apoB polysomes exhibit unusual sedimentation characteristics whether or not they are membrane-associated.Several studies have reported the effects of insulin and other growth factors on the subcellular distribution of PI 3-K in adipocytes (25Navé B.T. Haigh R.J. Hayward A.C. Siddle K. Shepherd P.S. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 55-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar,26Ricort J.-M. Tanti J.-F. Obberghen E. Le Marchand-Brustel Y. Eur. J.

Ester C.J. Young P.W. Kasuga M. Holman G.D. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 125-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). However, the subcellular distribution of PI 3-K in hepatocytes has not been studied. Current studies show that insulin induces the redistribution of p85 from PLS to LDM (Fig. 4). This finding is consistent with results from studies of adipocytes in which insulin increases the amount of p85 in microsomes (25Navé B.T. Haigh R.J. Hayward A.C. Siddle K. Shepherd P.S. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 55-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 26Ricort J.-M. Tanti J.-F. Obberghen E. Le Marchand-Brustel Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 239: 17-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Although it has been proposed that tyrosine-phosphorylated IRS-1 may deliver PI 3-K to specific intracellular sites (64Heller-Harrison R.A. Morin M. Czech M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24442-24450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), little is known about the mechanism(s) by which PI 3-K is recruited to intracellular membranes. Since there is evidence that inhibition of PI 3-K activity by wortmannin does not block insulin-stimulated localization of PI 3-K to microsomes (25Navé B.T. Haigh R.J. Hayward A.C. Siddle K. Shepherd P.S. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 55-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), it is unlikely that PI 3-K activity is necessary for the recruitment of PI 3-K to intracellular membranes. IRS-1-associated PI 3-K activity appears to be confined to LDM and PLS fractions from rat hepatocytes treated with insulin (Fig. 5). These results are consistent with recent studies in adipocytes demonstrating that most insulin-stimulated PI 3-K activity is present in LDM (25Navé B.T. Haigh R.J. Hayward A.C. Siddle K. Shepherd P.S. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 55-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 43Kelly K.L. Ruderman N.B. J. Biol.

Biochem. 1996; 239: 17-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Whether the redistribution of p85 from the cytosol to the LDM is the sole consequence of interaction with activated IRS-1 cannot be evaluated from the current studies. Such an analysis would have to include time course studies and evaluation of other potential insulin receptor substrate molecules.Insulin has been shown to stimulate PI 3-K activity in plasma membranes, in a low density microsome fraction enriched in GLUT 4-containing vesicles, and possibly in GLUT 4-containing vesicles themselves (25Navé B.T.

Several lines of evidence support this conclusion. First, the LDM fraction, which is enriched in both IRS-1-associated PI 3-K activity and IRS-1·PI 3-K mass in response to insulin, contains significant amounts of ER marker proteins and only trace amounts of Golgi marker proteins (Fig. 2). Second, the majority of apoB mRNA is isolated in LDM, indicating that at least a portion of microsomes in the LDM fraction are rough microsomes containing apoB mRNA (Fig. 3). Third, subfractionation of LDM on sucrose density gradients shows that vesicles derived from the ER are effectively separated from Golgi vesicles based on distribution of organelle marker proteins (Fig. 8). Upon insulin stimulation, the amount of p85 (PI 3-K) increases significantly in microsome fractions containing calnexin, NADPH-cytochrome creductase, and protein-disulfide isomerase, consistent with rough ER (Fig. 7). Finally, insulin stimulates PI 3-K activity in classically isolated rough microsomes (Fig. 10), shown to be composed of rough ER by electron microscopy (Fig. 9).In summary, current studies suggest that insulin action leads to the localization of activated PI 3-K to the ER, which correlates with the site of apoB biogenesis and lipoprotein assembly. Mechanisms involving the inhibition of neutral lipid assembly into VLDL or the targeting of newly synthesized apoB from the ER to a degradation compartment are possible. Consistent with the latter hypothesis are the observations that insulin-induced degradation of apoB in rat hepatocytes occurs in a post-ER compartment and involves a vesicular traffic event sensitive to brefeldin A (22Sparks J.D.

A role of PI 3-K in vesicular traffic is further supported, since PI 3-K is required for the traffic of GLUT 4 transporters in adipocytes (19Okada T. Kawano Y. Sakakibara T. Hazeki O. Ui M. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W2108253100,"We have identified a novel missense mutation in a pseudoachondroplasia (PSACH) patient in one of the type III repeats of cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP). Enlarged lamellar rough endoplasmic reticulum vesicles were shown to contain accumulated COMP along with type IX collagen, a cartilage-specific component. COMP was secreted and assembled normally into the extracellular matrix of tendon, demonstrating that the accumulation of COMP in chondrocytes was a cell-specific phenomenon. We believe that the intracellular storage of COMP causes a nonspecific aggregation of cartilage-specific molecules and results in a cartilage matrix deficient in required structural components leading to impaired cartilage growth and maintenance. These data support a common pathogenetic mechanism behind two clinically related chondrodysplasias, PSACH and multiple epiphyseal dysplasia."
https://openalex.org/W1979211309,"It has been previously reported that baculovirus homologous regions, the regions of baculovirus genomes that contain the origins of DNA replication, can augment the expression of a small number of baculovirus genes in vitro. We are now reporting that a region of the genome of Bombyx mori nuclear polyhedrosis virus (BmNPV) containing the homologous region 3 (HR3) acts as an enhancer for the promoter of a nonviral gene, the cytoplasmic actin gene of the silkmoth B. mori. Incorporation of the HR3 sequences of BmNPV into an actin promoter-based expression cassette results in an augmentation of transgene expression in transfected cells by two orders of magnitude relative to the control recombinant expression cassette. This increase is due to a corresponding increase in the rate of transcription from the actin promoter and not to replication of the expression cassette and occurs only when the HR3 element is linked to the expression cassette in cis. A comparable degree of enhancement in the activity of the silkworm actin promoter occurs also in heterologous lepidopteran cells. Concomitant supplementation of transfected cells with the BmIE1 trans-activator, which was previously shown to be capable of functioning in vitro as a transcriptional co-activator of the cytoplasmic actin gene promoter, results in more than a 1,000-fold increase in the level of expression of recombinant proteins placed under the control of the actin gene promoter. These findings provide the foundation for the development of a nonlytic insect cell expression system for continuous high-level expression of recombinant proteins. Such a system should provide levels of expression of recombinant proteins comparable to those obtained from baculovirus expression systems and should also have the additional advantage of continuous production in a cellular environment that, in contrast to that generated by a baculovirus infection, supports continuously proper posttranslational modifications of recombinant proteins and the capability of expression of proteins from genomic as well as cDNA sequences.

Summers M.D. Guarino L.A. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 945-951Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, the AcNPV HR5 element was also shown to be capable of enhancing another viral promoter of nonbaculovirus origin, the Rous sarcoma virus long terminal repeat promoter (14Guarino L.A. Summers M.D. J. Virol. 1987; 61: 2091-2099Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In a previous communication (17Johnson R. Meidinger R.G. Iatrou K. Virology. 1992; 190: 815-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), we reported on the development of anin vitro expression system that employed the promoter of the silkmoth A3 (cytoplasmic) actin gene (18Mounier N. Prudhomme J.-C. Biochimie (Paris). 1986; 68: 1053-1061Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 19Mounier N. Prudhomme J.-C. Insect Biochem. 1991; 21: 293-301Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar) as a driver of foreign gene expression in lepidopteran cells. Furthermore, we also reported previously that a baculovirus transcriptional activator, BmIE1, that is encoded by an immediate early gene of BmNPV, functions as co-activator of the cytoplasmic actin gene promoter in transfected cells and increases the level of transcription from this promoter by two orders of magnitude (20Lu M. Johnson R. Iatrou K. Virology. 1996; 218: 103-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In an attempt to increase the general utility of the actin gene promoter as a component of expression vectors for production of foreign proteins in insect cells, we have looked for additional genetic elements that can stimulate further the expression of the actin promoter. Because baculoviruses have evolved both to cooperate and compete with cellular genes and to take advantage of cellular structures by enhancing general cell maintenance functions, and in view of the previous reports regarding the in vitro effects of baculovirus HRs for a few viral genes, we have asked whether the enhancing properties of HR elements can also be seen when these elements are linked to gene promoters of the host cell and introduced into lepidopteran insect cells. We are now reporting that, when linked to gene constructs expressing reporter proteins under the control of the cytoplasmic actin gene promoter of B. mori, a DNA fragment containing the HR3 of BmNPV enhances significantly the in vitro expression of the reporter proteins. The observed stimulation is due to increases in the rate of transcription of the actin gene promoter. In accordance with the definition for enhancer elements, the BmNPV genomic fragment is capable of mediating its effect only in cis and in a position and orientation-independent manner. Finally, we show that linkage of the HR3 enhancer to the actin gene promoter combined with the presence of the BmIE1 protein in the transfected cells results in an augmentation in the level of actin promoter strength by three orders of magnitude relative to that of the basic actin gene promoter. These results set the stage for the development of a stable insect cell transformation system for overexpression of recombinant proteins. Such a system should provide levels of expression similar to those achieved by recombinant baculoviruses but should be devoid of the limitations inherent to baculovirus expression systems. Well known limitations of baculovirus expression systems include first, a reduction in proper posttranslational modification of recombinant proteins during the high production phase (late stages of infection) due to damaging of the insect cell's protein modification machinery; second, the general inability of baculovirus-infected cells to process during the late stages of infection, complex, intron-containing transcripts and produce recombinant proteins from genomic sequences; and third, difficulties associated with the purification of recombinant proteins as a result of cell lysis at the end of the infection process, and release of proteases that cause degradation of the overexpressed products. None of these problems should occur in an insect cell expression system in which the cells remain intact for the duration of the production phase. A 6.6-kb ClaI fragment of BmNPV genomic DNA (map units 49.94–54.94) containing genes p39,cg30, and p15 and a region with multipleEcoRI sites was previously cloned (Fig. 1 A) (21Lu M. Iatrou K. J. Gen. Virol. 1996; 77: 3135-3148Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar,22Lu M. Iatrou K. Gene (Amst.). 1997; 185: 69-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). A 1.2-kb SspI subfragment of the cloned fragment (map unit 51.8–52.7) containing multiple EcoRI sites (HR3 element of BmNPV) was subcloned into the SmaI site of vector pBluescript-SK+ (pBS; Stratagene). Two plasmids, p153 and p133, containing the 1.2-kb insert in opposite orientations were obtained and used subsequently for generating various expression cassettes. Plasmid pBmA.cat, which contains the Escherichia coli chloramphenicol acetyl transferase (CAT) open reading frame (ORF) under the control of the cytoplasmic actin A3 gene promoter ofB. mori (17Johnson R. Meidinger R.G. Iatrou K. Virology. 1992; 190: 815-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), was digested with SstI, and a 3.0-kb SstI fragment containing the actin.catgene fusion was isolated and inserted in two orientations into theSstI sites of plasmids p133 and p153 to generate the recombinant expression cassettes p13314, p13315, p15316, and p15317 (Fig. 2 A). Plasmids pIE1/133 and pIE1/153, which contain the HR3 enhancer and the ie1 gene of BmNPV (20Lu M. Johnson R. Iatrou K. Virology. 1996; 218: 103-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), were made by inserting a 3.8-kb ClaI fragment containing theie1 gene into the ClaI site of plasmids p133 and p153, respectively, removing unwanted restriction sites in the polylinker of these plasmids by double digestion with SacII and BamHI, blunt-ending with T4 DNA polymerase and self-ligating the resultant plasmids. The double-enhanced expression cassettes pIE1/133A and pIE1/153A were generated by inserting a 2.2-kbSacI fragment containing the basic actin expression cassette from plasmid pBmA (17Johnson R. Meidinger R.G. Iatrou K. Virology. 1992; 190: 815-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) into the unique SacI sites of plasmids pIE1/133 and pIE1/153, respectively. The recombinant expression vectors pIE1/133A.cat and pIE1/153A.cat were generated by inserting a 0.9-kb BamHI fragment, obtained from plasmid pBmA.cat and containing the ORF for CAT, into the uniqueBamHI sites of the expression cassettes pIE1/133A and pIE1/133A, respectively.

Virology. 1996; 218: 103-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Finally, the double-enhanced expression vector pIE1/153A.jhe(kk) was generated by first isolating a 1.8-kb EcoRI fragment containing the ORF for JHE (kk) from plasmid pAcUW21-KK (23Bonning B.C.

They were transfected with various plasmid DNAs in 6-well microtiter plates (106 cells/well in 2 ml of medium) as described previously (20Lu M. Johnson R. Iatrou K. Virology. 1996; 218: 103-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), except that cells in each well were transfected with 0.5 ml of transfection solution (20Lu M. Johnson R. Iatrou K.

Transfected cells were pelleted 48 h posttransfection and washed three times with 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline (10 mmKH2PO4, 2 mmNaH2PO4, 140 mm NaCl, 40 mm KCl). 90% of the cells were used to extract soluble protein, and 10-mg aliquots of the extracted protein were used for CAT assays as described (20Lu M. Johnson R. Iatrou K. Virology. 1996; 218: 103-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The remaining 10% of the transfected cells were used for Dot Blot DNA hybridization analysis. The cells were counted with a hemocytometer and Dot-blotted directly onto Hybond-N+ membranes (Amersham). The membranes were treated sequentially with 0.5 n NaOH and 0.5 mTris-HCl, pH 7.5. Labeling of a 900-bp BamHI fragment of pBmA.cat containing the CAT ORF (17Johnson R. Meidinger R.G. Iatrou K.

For JHE assays, cells were harvested as above, and their media were assayed as described previously (20Lu M. Johnson R. Iatrou K.

For quantitative measurements, samples were diluted to obtain juvenile hormone to juvenile hormone acid conversion rates between 10 and 50%, and activities were calculated on the basis of the dilution factors. Total nucleic acid from transfected cells was extracted as described (20Lu M. Johnson R. Iatrou K. Virology. 1996; 218: 103-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), treated with RNase-free DNase, and reverse-transcribed using as primer oligo(dT)12–18. Aliquots of cDNA reactions were subjected to semiquantitative PCR amplification using cat gene and chorion gene-specific primers as described previously (20Lu M. Johnson R. Iatrou K. Virology. 1996; 218: 103-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Nuclei were isolated from pBmA.cat and p13315-transfected cells, and nuclear run-on reactions were carried out as described (20Lu M. Johnson R. Iatrou K. Virology. 1996; 218: 103-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Nuclear RNA labeled with [α-32P]CTP and [α-32P]GTP was used as probe against a dilution series of a 900-bp BamHI cat gene fragment isolated from plasmid pBmA.cat (17Johnson R. Meidinger R.G. Iatrou K. Virology. 1992; 190: 815-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) and immobilized on Hybond-N+ membrane as described previously (20Lu M. Johnson R. Iatrou K. Virology. 1996; 218: 103-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The nucleotide sequence of the portion of the 1.2-kb SspI fragment (GenBankTMaccession no. U77353) containing the HR3 element of BmNPV is shown in Fig. 1 B. The HR3 element consists of a 72-bp sequence motif that is repeated completely four times and incompletely once. The fourth repeat unit is missing 45 bp of the repeat, whereas the first one contains two insertions, 14 and 56 bp (Fig. 1 B, X and Y, respectively). Each repeat unit contains an EcoRI site located at the center of a 30-bp imperfect palindrome. The nucleotide sequence of HR3 presented here is somewhat different from that reported previously (GenBankTM accession no. L33180), especially in the rightward half of the repeat unit (data not shown). This difference is probably due to the fact that different BmNPV isolates were used. Derivatives of the expression vector pBmA.cat, which contains the CAT ORF under the control of the silkmoth cytoplasmic actin gene promoter, were constructed by inserting the 1.2-kb SspI fragment in four different combinations of position and orientation relative to the actin gene promoter (Fig.2 A). The ability of the HR3 fragment to enhance the actin promoter was assessed by transfecting Bm5 cells with pBmA.cat or each of the four HR3-containing plasmids. As shown in Fig. 2 B, although some variability was observed between CAT activities obtained from constructs containing the HR3 element in various spatial arrangements relative to the actin promoter, the same fundamental result was obtained from all four HR3 configurations tested; cells transfected with actin expression cassettes containing the HR3 element resulted in expression of higher CAT activities than cells transfected with the basal expression vector. Quantitative analysis of the results shown in Fig. 2 Brevealed a 35-, 88-, 15-, and 23-fold stimulation in actin promoter-driven expression of cat gene expression in cells transfected with plasmids p13314, p13315, p15316, and p15317, respectively. For example, whereas Bm5 cells transfected with pBmA.cat contained 0.33 units CAT activity per mg of soluble cellular protein, cells transfected with vector p13315 contained 29.5 units per mg (not shown). To ensure that the observed differences in CAT activity in transfected cells were not due to differences in transfection efficiencies between constructs or to plasmid DNA replication, we carried out hybridization-based determinations of plasmid copy numbers present in the cells. As shown in Fig. 2 C, equivalent hybridization signals were obtained from cells transfected with each of the five plasmids indicating that they contained equimolar amounts of expression plasmids. To exclude the possibility that an unknown gene product encoded by sequences present in the 1.2 kb sequence was responsible for the observed increases in actin promoter-driven cat gene expression, we carried out co-transfections of Bm5 cells with pBmA.cat and p133 or p153, each of which contains the 1.2-kb HR3 fragment. The CAT assays shown in Fig. 2 D showed that neither p133 nor p153 was able to increase CAT expression from pBmA.cat intrans. Therefore, because the HR3 element is capable of stimulating the level of expression of the actin gene promoter only incis and in a position- and orientation-independent manner, it can be defined as an enhancer of the cytoplasmic actin gene promoter. Finally, to test whether the HR3 element is also functional in other lepidopteran cells, we transfected Spodoptera frugiperda(Sf21) tissue culture cells with plasmids pBmA.cat and p13315. As shown in Fig. 2 E, the CAT assays revealed that the BmNPV HR3 element functions in these cells in a manner analogous to that seen in Bm5 cells. To find out whether the observed increases in CAT activity obtained in the presence of the HR3 element were due to corresponding increases in the accumulation of CAT mRNA in the transfected cells, we carried out a semiquantitative RT-PCR analysis of CAT mRNA present in cells transfected with different plasmids. As shown in Fig.3 A (upper panel), cells transfected with vector p13315, which contains the enhancer upstream of the actin promoter (see Fig. 2 A for its orientation), contained much higher quantities of CAT mRNA than cells transfected with vector pBmA.cat. Nuclear run-on transcription assays were also performed to determine whether the observed increases in CAT mRNA accumulation observed in the presence of the HR3 element were due to corresponding changes in rates of transcription. As shown in Fig. 3 B, an average of a 16-fold higher hybridization signal was detected with the run-on RNA probe obtained from nuclei of p13315-transfected cells than with the probe obtained from pBmA.cat-transfected cells. These results indicate that the HR3 element stimulates the expression of theactin.cat fusion gene by increasing the rate at which this gene is transcribed. The immediate early gene ie1 of baculoviruses is transcribed in infected lepidopteran cells by the host transcriptional machinery in the absence of any accessory viral products. We have previously shown that BmIE1, the protein encoded by the ie1 gene of BmNPV, functions as co-activator of the actin gene promoter in vitro and potentiates the level of expression of the actin gene promoter also by approximately two orders of magnitude (20Lu M. Johnson R. Iatrou K. Virology. 1996; 218: 103-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). To determine whether BmIE1 and HR3 can act synergistically on the actin gene promoter, we co-transfected Bm5 cells with plasmid pBmIE1 and each of the four HR3/actin-cat constructs. As shown in Fig.4, the CAT assays showed that CAT activity in the presence of both BmIE1 and HR3 was higher than that obtained in the absence of either BmIE1 or HR3, irrespective of whether the BmIE1 gene was present in the same plasmid as the HR3-enhanced actin promoter construct or supplied to the cells as a separate plasmid. Quantification of the observed enzyme activities (TableI) revealed that cells co-transfected with pBmIE1 and each of HR3/actin-cat constructs contained more than 1,000-fold higher CAT activity than cells transfected with plasmid pBmA.cat. Primer extension experiments (not shown) revealed that the increases in actin-cat gene expression mediated by BmIE1 and HR3 resulted from increases in transcription rates and that the transcription start sites were the same as those observed with the basal actin expression cassette.Table IActin-cat and actin-jhe(kk) gene expression in the presence of BmIE1 and HR3Transfection plasmidAverage units of activityAverage relative activitypBS0 (3)0pBmA.cat0.336 (3)1HR3/pBmA.cat (p13315)29.47 (3)87.7pBmA.cat + BmIE122.92 (2)68.2HR3/pBmA.cat (p13315) + BmIE1382.80 (1)1,139.3BmIE1/HR3/pBmA.cat (pIE1/133A.cat and pIE1/153A.cat)549.09 (2)1,634.2pBmA.jhe(kk)1.18 × 10−3 (5)1pBmA.jhe(kk) + BmIE10.114 (5)96.9BmIE1/HR3/pBmA.jhe(kk) (pIE1/153A.jhe(kk)1.37 (3)1,160The indicated plasmid DNAs were (co-)transfected into Bm5 cells.

Numbers in parentheses indicate time of repeat transfections for each vector combination. Finally, to demonstrate that the observed increases in transgene expression observed in the presence of the HR3 enhancer and the BmIE1 factor were not transgene specific, we tested the activity of two additional plasmids, pBmA.jhe(kk) and pIE1/153A.jhe(kk), in transfected Bm5 cells. These two plasmids contain the ORF for a modified version of the enzyme juvenile hormone esterase (JHE), a secreted glycoprotein ofHeliothis virescens, under the control of the basal actin promoter or under the control of the double-enhanced (HR3 and BmIE1) actin promoter, respectively. As shown in Table I, JHE activity in the medium of cells transfected with plasmid pIE1/133A.jhe(kk) was over 1,000-fold higher than that obtained from cells transfected with the basic recombinant vector pBmA.jhe(kk). Therefore, the HR3-enhancing effect on transgene expression under the control of the silkmoth cytoplasmic gene promoter is promoter rather than transgene specific. Furthermore, considering that BmIE1 alone increases the activity of the actin promoter by approximately 100-fold (Table I) (20Lu M. Johnson R. Iatrou K. Virology. 1996; 218: 103-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), these results also demonstrate that the BmIE1 protein and the HR3 enhancer are capable of increasing each other's effect on the in vitrotranscriptional stimulation of the cytoplasmic actin gene promoter by an additional order of magnitude. It was previously shown that AcNPV HRs can enhance the expression of some early baculovirus genes, such as 35k,39k, and ie2, as well as that of the Rous sarcoma virus long terminal repeat promoter (3Guarino L.A. Summers M.D. J. Virol. 1986; 60: 215-223Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Guarino L.A. Gonzalez M.A. Summers M.D. J. Virol. 1986; 60: 224-229Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Nissen M.S. Friesen P.D.

In the present study, we have demonstrated that a DNA fragment containing the HR3 sequences of BmNPV can function in vitroas an enhancer for the cytoplasmic actin promoter of B. mori. The definition of the HR3-containing fragment as an enhancer is based on three criteria: first, this fragment is capable of augmenting the level of foreign gene expression directed by the actin gene promoter in a position- and orientation-independent manner; second, it is unable to stimulate the expression of the actin gene promoter in trans; and, third, increased transgene expression from the HR3-enhanced actin promoter is due to significant increases in transcription rates. Through the results presented in this paper, we have also demonstrated that a baculovirus transcription factor, BmIE1, that was previously shown to act as a transcriptional co-activator of the silkmoth actin gene promoter in transfected lepidopteran cells (20Lu M. Johnson R. Iatrou K. Virology. 1996; 218: 103-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) acts cooperatively with HR3 and mediates a further increase in the transcriptional activity of the actin gene promoter. The resultant overall enhancement in transcriptional activity mediated by the combined action of the HR3 enhancer and the IE1 trans-activator is three orders of magnitude over the level of the basal actin gene promoter. At present, neither the mode of function of the HR3 sequence-containing fragment nor the mechanism of the cooperative activation effected by the BmIE1 gene product are known. For the HR3 enhancer, however, it is likely that control is exerted through binding of a cellulartrans-activator(s) or basal transcription factor(s) to the HR3 sequences. The case of the simian virus 40 (SV40) enhancer, which is composed of two 72-bp repeats and is capable of stimulating the expression of both early viral and cellular genes (26Benoist C. Chambon P. Nature. 1981; 290: 304-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar, 27Gruss P. Dhar R. Khoury G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Trends Genet. 1985; 1: 224-230Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (293) Google Scholar), may be analogous to that of HR3. Mutagenesis and competition experiments have shown that the SV40 enhancer activity is mediated by multipletrans-activators, such as TET-1, HIP116, and Oct proteins (30Davidson I. Xiao J.H. Rosales R. Staub A. Chambon P. Cell. 1988; 54: 931-942Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 31Sheridan P.L. Schorpp M. Voz M.L. Jones K.A. J. Biol.

Genes Dev. 1987; 1: 1147-1160Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Here, it is also worth noting that the cytoplasmic actin gene promoter and the baculovirus genes that are known to be enhanced by HR sequences are all transcribed by RNA polymerase II (33Blissard G.W. Rohrmann G.F. Annu. Rev. Entomol. 1990; 35: 127-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar, 34Dickson J.A. Friesen P.D. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 4006-4016Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 35Hoopes R.R.

Virol. 1994; 68: 813-822Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and also, as was shown by the studies presented here, that the enhancing effect also occurs in heterologous S. frugiperda cells. Therefore, although the mechanism by which the HR3 sequences exert their enhancing function is at present unknown, their enhancing capacity, at least in transfected cells, must be controlled by host factors that have been conserved during evolution. Whether BmIE1, the viral trans-activator that stimulates the actin promoter in the absence of HR3 element (Fig. 4) (20Lu M. Johnson R. Iatrou K. Virology. 1996; 218: 103-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) and augments the level of cis activation affected by the HR3 element (Fig. 4), is acting exclusively on the actin promoter sequences or if in the presence of the HR3 enhancer it also interacts with the latter remains to be investigated. Worth noting, however, is a previous finding that an AcNPV HR element-binding protein could be detected in insect cells following transfection with the AcNPV ie1 gene and that no obvious binding activity could be detected in control cells (37Guarino L.A. Dong W. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 3676-3680Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, it appears that in addition to binding to the actin promoter sequences, the BmIE1 protein may also bind to the HR3 enhancer and further augment its enhancing activity. In conclusion, the work described in this paper has demonstrated that two baculovirus-specific genetic elements, the HR3 sequence-containing fragment and the ie1 gene product, are capable of enhancing cooperatively the activity of the silkmoth cytoplasmic actin gene promoter by three orders of magnitude in a virus-free environment. This finding provides an opportunity to develop a recombinant gene expression system in a baculovirus-free insect system. We anticipate that coupling of the enhanced actin promoter-based expression cassette with an appropriate antibiotic selection scheme for generating stably transformed cell lines containing chromosomally integrated copies of this recombinant expression cassette, should result in an insect cell expression system capable of yielding quantities of recombinant proteins comparable to those achieved through conventional infection with baculovirus expression vectors. Such a system should have the additional advantages of continuous production in a cellular environment that, in contrast to that generated by a baculovirus infection, supports continuously proper posttranslational modifications of recombinant proteins."

It has more potent hemagglutinating activity against human A-type erythrocytes than a previously identified hemocyte lectin with an affinity toN-acetylglucosamine, tachylectin-2. The purified tachylectin-4 is an oligomeric glycoprotein of 470 kDa, composed of subunits of 30 and 31.5 kDa. Ca2+ at 10 mmenhanced the hemagglutinating activity 4-fold, and the activity was inhibited by EDTA and o-phenanthroline.l-Fucose and N-acetylneuraminic acid at 100 mm completely inhibited the activity of tachylectin-4. The activity was also inhibited more strongly by bacterial S-type lipopolysaccharides (LPS) but not by R-type LPS lacking O-antigen. The most effective S-type LPS was from Escherichia coliO111:B4, and the minimum concentration required for inhibiting agglutination against human A-type erythrocytes (0.1 μg/ml) was 160-fold lower than those of S-type LPS from Salmonella minnesota. Therefore, colitose (3-deoxy-l-fucose), a unique sugar present in the O-antigen of E. coli O111:B4 with structural similarity to l-fucose, is the most probable candidate for a specific ligand of tachylectin-4.A cDNA coding for tachylectin-4 was isolated from a hemocyte cDNA library.

Arthropods have developed a unique immune system without the acquired immunoglobulin-dependent immunity found in vertebrates. Therefore, innate immunity, the pre-existing and immediate ability to prevent and limit invading microbes and pathogens, is likely to be a major host defense system in arthropods. The hemolymph of horseshoe crabs contains three abundant proteins, hemocyanin, C-reactive protein, and α2-macroglobulin, and one type of granular cell, accounting for 99% of the total hemocytes (1Armstrong P.B. Gupta A.P. Immunology of Insects and Other Arthropods. CRC Press, London1991: 4-17Google Scholar, 2Toh Y. Mizutani A. Tokunaga F. Muta T. Iwanaga S. Cell Tissue Res. 1991; 266: 137-147Crossref Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The granular cells are extremely sensitive to bacterial endotoxin,i.e. lipopolysaccharides (LPS), 1The abbreviations used are: LPS, lipopolysaccharide(s); HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; ConA, concanavalin A. and the cells release granular components in response to LPS stimulation (3Iwanaga S.

This response is thought to be important for host defense in engulfing and killing invading microbes, in addition to preventing the leakage of hemolymph. The hemocytes contain large and small granules that selectively store proteins and defense molecules, including serine protease zymogens, a clottable protein that participates in the coagulation cascade, protease inhibitors, antibacterial peptides, lectins, and others (6Kawabata S. Muta T. Iwanaga S. Söderhäll K. Iwanaga S. Vasta G.R. New Directions in Invertebrate Immunology. SOS Publications, Fair Haven, NJ1996: 255-283Google Scholar). Many kinds of lectins play crucial roles in innate immunity and host defense not only in vertebrates but also in invertebrates, with involvement in processes such as non-self recognition, inflammation, opsonization, cell-cell or cell-extracellular matrix interactions, fertilization, development, and regeneration (7Vasta G.R.

To better understand the biological role of lectins in host defense of the horseshoe crab, we have studied various lectins found in hemolymph of this animal (6Kawabata S. Muta T. Iwanaga S. Söderhäll K. Iwanaga S. Vasta G.R. New Directions in Invertebrate Immunology. SOS Publications, Fair Haven, NJ1996: 255-283Google Scholar). Recently, we identified new horseshoe crab hemocyte-derived lectins, named tachylectin-1 (L6) (12Saito T. Kawabata S. Hirata M. Iwanaga S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14493-14499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) and tachylectin-2 (L10) (13Okino N. Kawabata S. Saito T. Hirata M. Takagi T. Iwanaga S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31008-31015Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Tachylectin-1 displays LPS-binding potential with antibacterial activity toward Gram-negative bacteria, but it has no hemagglutinin activity for human, sheep, and rabbit erythrocytes. On the other hand, tachylectin-2 has hemagglutinating activity against human A-type erythrocytes with specificity forN-acetylglucosamine. Furthermore, tachylectin-2 has agglutination activity against Staphylococcus saprophyticusKD. Both tachylectin-1 and tachylectin-2 are composed of unique tandem sequence repeats with no significant sequence similarity with other known proteins, including various animal and plant lectins. While continuing these studies on horseshoe crab lectins, we have now identified a new hemocyte lectin, which we named tachylectin-4; it has more potent hemagglutinating activity than tachylectin-2, shows a unique binding specificity to O-antigen of LPS, and has sequence similarity to the NH2-terminal domain with unknown functions of Xenopus pentraxin 1. Hemocytes lysate from the Japanese horseshoe crab (Tachypleus tridentatus) was prepared as described (14Nakamura T. Morita T. Iwanaga S. J. Biochem.

The samples were reduced andS-alkylated with iodoacetamide in 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 8 m urea (15Stone K.L. LoPresti M.B. Crawford J.M. DeAngelis R. Williams K.R. Matsudaira P.T.

TheS-alkylated protein (5 μg) was incubated with 0.1 unit ofN-glycosidase F (Boehringer Mannheim) in 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 2 m urea at 37 °C for 18 h and subjected to SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions. Purified tachylectin-4 was applied to a Superdex 200 HR10/30 column, equilibrated with 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 0.15 m NaCl at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Reference proteins for molecular weight determination were thyroglobulin (M r = 669,000), apoferritin (M r = 443,000), alcohol dehydrogenase (M r = 150, 000), bovine serum albumin (M r = 67,000), and carbonic anhydrase (M r = 30,000). SDS-PAGE was performed in 15% slab gels, according to Laemmli (16Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207529) Google Scholar). The gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. The reference proteins were phosphorylaseb (M r = 94,000), bovine serum albumin (M r = 67,000), ovalbumin (M r = 43,000), carbonic anhydrase (M r = 30,000), soybean trypsin inhibitor (M r = 20,000), and α-lactoalbumin (M r = 14,400). Tachylectin-4 (100 μg) was reduced and then S-alkylated with iodoacetamide (15Stone K.L. LoPresti M.B. Crawford J.M. DeAngelis R. Williams K.R. Matsudaira P.T.

The S-alkylated protein was digested with lysyl endopeptidase (enzyme/substrate = 1/100, w/w) in 0.1m NH4HCO3 containing 2m urea at 37 °C for 24 h. The peptides were separated by reverse-phase HPLC using a Chemcosorb 5-ODS-H column (2.1 × 150 mm, Chemco Scientific Co., Ltd., Osaka). Peptides were eluted from the column with a linear gradient of 0–80% acetonitrile in 0.06% trifluoroacetic acid at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min. Absorbance was monitored at 210 nm. Amino acid sequence analyses were performed using an Applied Biosystems 473A or 477A sequencer with the chemicals and programs supplied by the manufacturer (Perkin-Elmer Japan Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). Samples were hydrolyzed in 6m HCl containing 1% phenol at 110 °C for 20 h in evacuated tubes. The hydrolysates were analyzed using a Pico-Tag system (Waters Japan Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) (17Heinrikson R.L. Meredith S.C. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 136: 65-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (1364) Google Scholar). The degenerate nucleotide sequences of the primers used for PCR were based on the peptides derived from lysyl endopeptidase digestion (-Asn-Ala-Tyr-Val-Glu-Thr- and -Ile-Thr-Asp-Asp-Tyr-Val-) of tachylectin-4. Sense and antisense nucleotides were synthesized with anEcoRI site at the 5′ end. Reactions for PCR contained the cDNA template (corresponding to 0.1 μg of poly(A)+RNA) and 100 pmol each of the primer were carried out in a Perkin-Elmer Cetus thermal cycler. The PCR products were treated withEcoRI and purified with agarose gel electrophoresis. Fragments of interest were then ligated into plasmid Bluescript II SK (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) for sequence analysis, as described (18Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). One clone (0.4 kilobase), containing the sequence of tachylectin-4, was used as a probe to screen the λZipLox cDNA library. The PCR fragment, labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using a Ready-To-Go™ DNA-labeling kit (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) served as a probe. After secondary screening, the plasmids containing the cDNA insert were prepared from the positive plaques, following the manual supplied by the manufacturer. Amino acid sequence was compared with all entries in the SWISS-PROT protein data base by the FASTA homology search system of the European Bioinformatics Institute. The lysate prepared from 100 g (wet weight) of hemocytes was first fractionated on a dextran sulfate-Sepharose CL-6B column (4.5 × 20 cm) with increasing concentrations of NaCl from the range of 0.15–2.0m (14Nakamura T. Morita T. Iwanaga S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1985; 97: 1561-1574Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), and a typical elution pattern and hemagglutinating activity against human A-type erythrocytes is shown in Fig.1 A. The activity in the flow-through fraction is derived from tachylectin-2 (13Okino N. Kawabata S. Saito T. Hirata M. Takagi T. Iwanaga S. J. Biol.

The 0.15m NaCl fractions containing a new lectin, named tachylectin-4, indicated by a bar were pooled and applied to a ConA-Sepharose column (3 × 15 cm), equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 0.15 m NaCl. After washing with equilibration buffer, proteins were eluted with the same buffer containing 1 mα-methyl-d-glucoside (Fig. 1 B). The lectin fractions indicated by a bar were pooled and dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 0.15m NaCl. The dialyzed sample was then applied to anl-fucose-immobilized agarose column equilibrated with the same buffer. The column was washed extensively with the equilibration buffer, and then proteins were eluted with the same buffer containing 1ml-fucose (Fig. 1 C). All steps of the purification procedures were performed at 4 °C. The purification scheme is summarized in Table I. The tachylectin-4 was purified about 600-fold with a yield of 56%, as calculated from the pooled fraction of dextran-sulfate-Sepharose CL-6B chromatography free from the hemagglutinating activity of tachylectin-2.Table IPurification of tachylectin-4 from horseshoe crab hemocyte lysatePurification stepTotal protein1-aFor the determination of protein concentrations,A 280 = 10 for 1% protein solution, was assumed.Total activitySpecific activityPurificationYieldmgtiterstiters/mg-fold%Hemocyte lysate21,152604,16029Dextran sulfate-Sepharose CL-6B1,208243,2002011100ConA-Sepharose160153,6009624.863Fucose-agarose1.1135,171122,328611561-a For the determination of protein concentrations,A 280 = 10 for 1% protein solution, was assumed. Open table in a new tab The purified tachylectin-4 gave a doublet on SDS-PAGE under reducing (M r = 30,000 and 31,500) and non-reducing (M r = 23,500 and 26,000) conditions (Fig.1 D). On the other hand, an apparent molecular weight of tachylectin-4 in solution was determined by gel filtration to be 470,000, indicating an oligomeric protein. The two subunits of 31.5 and 30 kDa could be separated by reverse-phase HPLC on a YMC C4 column (4.6 × 150 mm, Yamamura Chemical Laboratories Co., Ltd., Kyoto, Japan) (data not shown), and their NH2-terminal sequences proved to be identical up to 18 residues as follows: Trp-Arg-Met-Leu-Tyr-Leu-Pro-Val-Ile-Val-Lys-Tyr-Gly-X-Met-Lys-Leu-Asp-. Furthermore, amino acid compositions of 20-h hydrolysates and peptide mapping patterns of the two subunits were almost indistinguishable (data not shown). The purified tachylectin-4 was treated with N-glycosidase F and subjected to SDS-PAGE (Fig.2). The N-glycosidase F treatment resulted in disappearance of the upper band, and the lower band was only observed in the gel with the same mobility as the untreated lower band (lanes 2 and 3), indicating that the different molecular weights between the subunits is caused by partial modification of the subunit with N-linked sugar(s). The extinction coefficient of tachylectin-4 at 280 nm for 1.0% solution in Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5) was calculated from data derived from amino acid analysis. The value of 14.0 was used for subsequent determinations of tachylectin-4 concentrations. Tachylectin-4 agglutinated all types of human erythrocytes and A-type erythrocytes were most sensitive (Table II). In the presence of 10 mm CaCl2, tachylectin-4 agglutinated A-type erythrocytes at the minimum concentration of 0.014 μg/ml, and 60- and 120-fold higher concentrations were required for O-type and B-type erythrocytes, respectively. No hemagglutination was observed for erythrocytes derived from horse, rabbit, and sheep (TableII). The hemagglutinating activity for A-type erythrocytes was enhanced 4-fold by 10 mm Ca2+, but other divalent cations including Zn2+, Co2+, Cu2+, and Mn2+ at 0.1 mm and 10 mm had no effects. The agglutinating activity was completely inhibited by 10 mm EDTA and 0.2 mm o-phenanthroline, suggesting the presence of metal ion(s) other than Ca2+ in tachylectin-4.Table IIHemagglutinating of activity of tachylectin-4ErythrocytesMinimum agglutination concentrationμg/mlHuman A-type0.014 B-type1.7 O-type0.86HorseNot agglutinated2-aNot agglutinated at 12.5 μg/ml.RabbitNot agglutinatedSheepNot agglutinated2-a Not agglutinated at 12.5 μg/ml. Open table in a new tab Effects of various carbohydrates on the hemagglutinating activity of tachylectin-4 are shown in Table III. For mono- and disaccharides, l-fucose and N-acetylneuraminic acid at the minimum concentration of 100 mm inhibited the hemagglutination. On the other hand, a bacterial cell wall component, LPS, was a more potent inhibitor. An LPS derived from E. coli O111:B4 was the most potent inhibitor at the minimum concentration of 0.1 μg/ml. Interestingly, LPS isolated from rough mutants of E. coli O111:B4 (smooth) such as E. coli J5 (Rc) and E. coli F583 (Rd) showed no inhibitory effect, suggesting that the O-antigen of the S-type E. coliis a determinant for carbohydrate recognition of tachylectin-4. This was the case for other Gram-negative bacteria. LPS derived from S-types of both S. minnesota and S. typhimurium inhibited the hemagglutinating activity at the minimum concentrations of 15.6 and 7.8 μg/ml, respectively, but LPS isolated from several rough mutants had no effect. To confirm the binding activity to O-antigen, hemagglutinating activity was measured using sheep erythrocytes coated with LPS derived from a S-strain (E. coli O111:B4) and a rough mutant (S. minnesota R595 (Re). Tachylectin-4 significantly agglutinated sheep erythrocytes sensitized with LPS ofE. coli O111:B4, but not those sensitized with LPS ofS. minnesota R595 (Re). This agglutinating activity was inhibited by free LPS derived from E. coli O111:B4, but not from S. minnesota R595 (Re). Lipoteichoic acid, a cell wall component of Gram-positive bacteria, also inhibited the hemagglutination, but lipoteichoic acid from Bacillus subtilis was not so effective (Table III).Table IIIInhibition of agglutinating activity of tachylectin-4ComponentMinimum inhibitory concentration3-aMinimum concentrations required for inhibition of two hemagglutinating titers of tachylectin-4 against human A-type erythrocytes.mmμg/mll-Fucose100d-GlucoseNI3-bNI, not inhibited at 100 mm or 1000 μg/ml.d-GalactoseNId-MannoseNIl-RhamnoseNId-XyloseNId-GlucosamineNId-GalactosamineNIN-Acetylneuraminic acid100N-Acetyl-d-glucosamineNIN-Acetyl-d-galactosamineNIN-Acetyl-d-mannosamineNILactoseNIN-AcetylallolactosamineNIMethyl α-d-mannosideNIMethyl β-d-glucosideNIHyaluronic acidNILaminarinNILPS: E. coli O111:B4 (smooth)0.1LPS: E. coli J5 (Rc)NILPS: E. coli F583 (Rd)NILPS: S. minnesota (smooth)15.6LPS: S. minnesotaR595 (Re)NILPS: S. minnesota R7 (Rd1)NILPS: S. typhimurium(smooth)7.8LPS: S. typhimurium TV119 (Ra)NILPS: S. typhimurium SL684 (Rc)NILipoteichoic acid: Staphylococcus aureus31.3Lipoteichoic acid: Streptococcus faecalis31.3Lipoteichoic acid: Streptococcus mutans62.5Lipoteichoic acid: Streptococcus sanguis62.5Lipoteichoic acid: Streptococcus pyogenes125Lipoteichoic acid: B. subtilis5003-a Minimum concentrations required for inhibition of two hemagglutinating titers of tachylectin-4 against human A-type erythrocytes.3-b NI, not inhibited at 100 mm or 1000 μg/ml. Open table in a new tab The tachylectin-4-specific probe of 0.4 kilobase was identified with oligonucleotides corresponding to peptides derived from tachylectin-4, using PCR and DNA sequence analysis. When the probe was used to screen a hemocyte cDNA library (400,000 recombinant phages), one positive clone with a 1.3-kilobase pair insert was subjected to restriction mapping followed by sequence determination of both strands and by sequential exonuclease digestion. The nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences are shown in Fig.3. The cDNA included 1,344 nucleotides with an open reading frame of 699 nucleotides. The open reading frame for the cDNA encoded for a mature protein of 232 amino acid residues with the calculated molecular weight of 26,625, and a signal sequence of 23 residues with a typical hydrophobic core. The candidate for an initiation codon ATG was found at nucleotide position 21. The stop codon at position 786 was followed by a polyadenylation signal, AATAAA, starting at position 1322. Amino acid sequences of the isolated peptides derived from tachylectin-4 corresponded exactly to the protein sequence deduced from the cDNA sequence, clearly indicating that the isolated cDNA clone codes for tachylectin-4. The deduced protein sequence contains one potential N-linked glycosylation site at Asn-108. Tachylectin-4 was sensitive toN-glycosidase F treatment (Fig. 2) and contained glucosamine, based on amino acid analysis (data not shown), indicating the presence of an N-linked sugar chain at this site. The isoelectric point of tachylectin-4 was calculated from amino acid composition to be 6.05 (19Skoog B Wichman A. Trends Anal. Chem. 1986; 5: 82-83Crossref Scopus (184) Google Scholar), which is rather acidic, compared with findings in tachylectin-1 (9.69) and tachylectin-2 (9.63). A search of SWISS-PROT showed the sequence similarity of tachylectin-4 to Xenopus laevis pentraxin 1 (20Seery L.T. Schoenberg D.R. Barbaux S. Sharp P.M. Whitehead A.S. Proc. R. Soc. Lond. B. 1993; 253: 263-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Tachylectin-4 has a 24% sequence identity to the NH2-terminal domain of Xenopuspentraxin 1 and the sequence of Pro-120 to Lys-159 of tachylectin-4 is highly conserved in the corresponding region of Xenopuspentraxin 1 (50% identity), as shown in Fig.4. We previously identified two kinds of lectins with no significant sequence similarity with other known proteins. These were named tachylectin-1 with LPS binding activity (12Saito T. Kawabata S. Hirata M. Iwanaga S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14493-14499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) and tachylectin-2 with hemagglutinating activity against human A-type erythrocytes (13Okino N. Kawabata S. Saito T. Hirata M. Takagi T. Iwanaga S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31008-31015Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In the present study, we identified a horseshoe crab hemocyte lectin, tachylectin-4, with hemagglutinating activity against human erythrocytes and with binding specificity to O-antigen of bacterial LPS. Tachylectin-4 has different characteristics from both tachylectin-1 and tachylectin-2. 1) The minimum agglutination concentration of tachylectin-4 required for human A-type erythrocytes (0.014 μg/ml) is about 100-fold lower than that of tachylectin-2 (1.6 μg/ml) (13Okino N. Kawabata S. Saito T. Hirata M. Takagi T. Iwanaga S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31008-31015Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). 2) The addition of Ca2+ at 10 mmenhances the hemagglutinating activity of tachylectin-4 by 4-fold, whereas Ca2+ is not required for the activity of tachylectin-2 and EDTA has no effect on the activity of tachylectin-2 (13Okino N. Kawabata S. Saito T. Hirata M. Takagi T. Iwanaga S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31008-31015Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). However, the hemagglutinating activity of tachylectin-4 was completely inhibited by EDTA or o-phenanthroline, indicating that tachylectin-4 contains metal ion(s) with an important role for the sugar binding. 3) The activity of tachylectin-2 is inhibited by 0.1 mm N-acetylglucosamine (13Okino N. Kawabata S. Saito T. Hirata M. Takagi T. Iwanaga S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31008-31015Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), which had no effect on the activity of tachylectin-4 at 100 mm. On the other hand, l-fucose (6-deoxy-l-galactose) specifically inhibits the activity of tachylectin-4, with no inhibition for tachylectin-2. l-Rhamnose (6-deoxy-l-mannose), a stereoisomer of l-fucose at C-2 and C-4, has no effect on the activity of tachylectin-4, suggesting an important role for the configuration of C-2 or C-4 in sugar recognition. 4) Tachylectin-2 (27 kDa) exists as a monomer in solution (13Okino N. Kawabata S. Saito T. Hirata M. Takagi T. Iwanaga S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31008-31015Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), whereas tachylectin-4 is present as a high molecular mass oligomer of 470 kDa. Based on an assumption of 30 kDa for one subunit, tachylectin-4 is composed of 15–16 subunits, under physiological conditions. 5) Tachylectin-1 agglutinates sheep erythrocytes coated with LPS derived from both a wild-type (smooth) and a Re mutant of S. minnesota (12Saito T. Kawabata S. Hirata M. Iwanaga S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14493-14499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In contrast, the hemagglutinating activity of tachylectin-4 was inhibited by S-type LPS, not by R-type LPS lacking O-antigen. The LPS from E. coli O111:B4 was most effective, and the minimum concentration required to inhibit hemagglutination for human A-type erythrocytes was 160-fold and 80-fold lower than those of LPS from S. minnesota (smooth) and S. typhimurium(smooth), respectively. The O-antigen of E. coli O111:B4 is built up by a unique repeating unit of a main chain containingd-galactose, d-glucose, andd-N-acetylgalactosamine, and a monosaccharide side chain of colitose (3,6-dideoxy-l-galactose or 3-deoxy-l-fucose) (21Knirel Y.A. Kochetkov N.K. Biochemistry (Moscow). 1994; 59: 1325-1383Google Scholar). In these monosaccharides, colitose is the most probable candidate for a specific ligand of tachylectin-4, since it is a unique monosaccharide present in the O-antigen ofE. coli O111:B4, its structure is similar to that ofl-fucose, and three other monosaccharides had no effect on the hemagglutinating activity of tachylectin-4 (Table III). On the other hand, the O-antigen of S. typhimurium is composed of a main chain containing of d-mannose, l-rhamnose, and d-galactose, and two monosaccharide side chains ofd-glucose and abequose (3,6-dideoxy-d-galactose or 3-deoxy-d-fucose) (21Knirel Y.A. Kochetkov N.K. Biochemistry (Moscow). 1994; 59: 1325-1383Google Scholar). Abequose is also a candidate for another ligand, since the hexoses except abequose have no effect on the activity of tachylectin-4 (Table III). Abequose is thed-isomer of colitose, which may cause a reduced affinity to tachylectin-4. A sequence homology search showed no significant sequence similarity between tachylectin-4 and other known LPS-binding lectins, such asLimulus endotoxin-binding protein-protease inhibitor (22Minetti C.A.S.A. Lin Y.A. Cislo T. Liu T.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20773-20780Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), mammalian plasma LPS-binding protein (23Schumann R.R. Leong S.R. Flaggs G.W. Gray P.W.

Biol. 1996; 26: 355-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), whereas the search indicates the sequence similarity of tachylectin-4 to X. laevis pentraxin 1 (20Seery L.T. Schoenberg D.R. Barbaux S. Sharp P.M. Whitehead A.S. Proc. R. Soc. Lond. B. 1993; 253: 263-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4). Pentraxins are decameric or dodecameric proteins composed of identical protomers, arranged in two pentameric or hexameric rings interacting face-to-face (26Emsley J. White H.E. O'Hara B.P. Oliva G. Srinivasan N. Tickle I.J. Blundell T.L. Pepys M.B. Wood S.P. Nature. 1994; 367: 338-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar, 27Shrive A.K. Cheetham G.M.T. Holden D. Myles D.A.A. Turnell W.G. Volanakis J.E. Pepys M.B. Bloomer A.C. Greenhough T.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 346-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). They constitute a family of carbohydrate binding proteins with divalent cation dependence, and some pentraxins, such as human C-reactive protein, belong to acute phase proteins, rapidly increasing their concentrations in response to stress, injury or infection (7Vasta G.R. Marchalonis J.J. Reinisch C.L. Defense Molecules. Wiley-Liss, New York1990: 183-199Google Scholar, 28Osmand A.P. Friedenson B. Gewurz H. Painter R. Hofmann T. Shelton E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1994; 22: 74-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). However, Xenopus pentraxin 1 gene, identified from aXenopus cDNA library using pentraxin-specific oligonucleotide probes, unexpectedly encodes a novel fusion protein with an NH2-terminal domain of a unique sequence and the COOH-terminal domain with sequence similarity to C-reactive proteins. The sequence similarity of tachylectin-4 to the NH2-terminal domain suggests that Xenopuspentraxin 1 is a chimeric protein with two different lectin-like activities. The binding activities of tachylectin-4 with LPS and lipoteichoic acids suggest that tachylectin-4 plays a important role in recognition of invading bacteria. There is no evidence that horseshoe crabs have immunoglobulins (31Finstad C.L. Litman G.W. Finstad J. Good R.A. J. Immunol. 1972; 108: 1704-1711PubMed Google Scholar), the recognition molecules produced by gene rearrangements, which help to distinguish self from non-self. Horseshoe crabs, however, do have an innate constitutive immune system that includes recognition by cell surface receptors or diverse lectin-like substances, phagocytosis (32Armstrong P.B. Cohen E. Biomedical Applications of the Horseshoe Crab (Limulidae). Alan R. Liss, Inc., New York1979: 73-92Google Scholar), and killing reactions by antimicrobial molecules. Therefore, horseshoe crabs may oppose invaders through a combinatorial method using preexisting components in hemolymph plasma and hemocytes. Co-localization of these defense molecules in granules and their release into the hemolymph, in response to the stimulation of LPS, suggest that they serve synergistically to accomplish an effective host defense system against invading microbes and foreign substances. We are grateful to W. Kamata for expert technical assistance with peptide sequencing and amino acid analyses and to M. Ohara for helpful comments on the manuscript."

It is composed of three domains: an amino-terminal SacI homology region, a central inositol 5′-phosphatase homology region, and a carboxyl-terminal proline-rich region. We have now identified and characterized a novel form of synaptojanin, synaptojanin 2, which has a broader tissue distribution. Synaptojanin 2 cDNA from rat brain library encodes a protein of 1,248 amino acids with a predictedM r of 138,268. The two synaptojanin isoforms share 57.2 and 53.8% amino acid identity in their SacI and phosphatase domains, respectively. In marked contrast, their carboxyl-terminal proline-rich regions bear little homology. Expression of synaptojanin 2 in COS7 cells produced a 140-kDa protein with inositol 5′-phosphatase actvity. Protein binding assays demonstrated that among the major src homology 3-proteins known to bind to the proline-rich region of synaptojanin 1, Grb2, amphiphysin, and members of SH3p4/8/13 protein family, only Grb2 bound to that of synaptojanin 2. Furthermore, subcellular fractionation studies in transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells revealed that synaptojanin 2 was predominantly associated with the particulate fraction while synaptojanin 1 was mainly localized in the soluble fraction. This observation suggests that the proline-rich regions of synaptojanins 1 and 2 are implicated in different protein-protein interactions and direct the two isoforms to different subcellular compartments.Our results demonstrate the presence of a family of synaptojanin-type inositol 5′-phosphatases with different tissue and subcellular distributions, which may be involved in distinct membrane trafficking and signal transduction pathways in mammalian cells.

Our results demonstrate the presence of a family of synaptojanin-type inositol 5′-phosphatases with different tissue and subcellular distributions, which may be involved in distinct membrane trafficking and signal transduction pathways in mammalian cells. Inositol metabolism is now considered to play essential roles in membrane trafficking processes within the cell, apart from its well established role in signal transduction (1Divecha N. Irvine R.F.

Of particular importance, distinct phosphoinositides seem to be involved in specific vesicle transport steps, as demonstrated by critical requirement of several enzymes responsible for synthesis and metabolism of phosphoinositides in different membrane trafficking pathways (4DeCamilli P.

It has a 3-domain structure in which the central inositol 5′-phosphatase domain is flanked by a proline-rich domain at the carboxyl-terminal side and by a domain homologous to the yeast protein SacI (8Cleves A.E. Novick P.J. Bankaitis V.A. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 2939-2950Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar) at the amino-terminal side. Synaptojanin is concentrated in nerve terminals and localized in close proximity to clathrin- and dynamin-coated endocytic intermediates (9Haffner C. Takei K. Butler M. David C. Hudson A. Grabs D. DeCamilli P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 78aGoogle Scholar). Synaptojanin and dynamin 1 are the major interacting proteins for amphiphysin 1, another nerve terminal protein with a putative role in synaptic vesicle endocytosis (7McPherson P.S. Garcia E.P.

In addition, synaptojanin, dynamin 1, and amphiphysin 1 undergo parallel dephosphorylation upon nerve terminal depolarization (6McPherson P.S. Takei K. Schmid S.L. DeCamilli P. J. Biol.

These properties suggest that synaptojanin, together with dynamin 1, participates in synaptic vesicle recycling. Clathrin-mediated synaptic vesicle recycling in neuronal cells is believed to be a specialized form of general receptor-mediated endocytosis (15DeCamilli P. Takei K. Neuron. 1996; 16: 481-486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). It is anticipated that components of the machinery required for these endocytic pathways are related. To extend our understanding of the role of inositol metabolism in membrane trafficking pathways, we have searched for novel synaptojanin isoforms. We report here the structure and the properties of a synaptojanin isoform with more widespread tissue distribution and distinct protein interaction property. Henceforth, the previously identified synaptojanin is referred to as synaptojanin 1 and the novel isoform as synaptojanin 2.

These sequences included the Saccharomyces cerevisiae SacI protein (8Cleves A.E. Novick P.J. Bankaitis V.A. J.

Two amino acid sequences, (G/A)NF(V/N)ETE and P(A/S)(W/Y)(T/C)DR(V/I), were chosen from the regions conserved among SacI- and inositol 5′-phosphatase-related proteins, respectively, to synthesize degenerate oligonucleotide primers for polymerase chain reaction (PCR); 5′-G(G/C)(G/A/T/C)AA(T/C)TT(T/C)(G/A)(A/T)(G/A/T/C)GA(G/A)AC(G/A/T/C)GA-3′ for sense primer and 5′-A(T/C)(G/A/T/C)C(GT)(G/A)TC(G/A/T/C)(G/C)(A/T)(G/A/C)(T/C)A(G/A/T/C)(G/C)(A/T/C)(G/A/T/C)GG-3′ for antisense primer. PCR was performed using adult rat brain cDNA as template. The amplified product was ligated into pCRII vector (Invitrogen). Sequence analysis identified a clone with the insert encoding a novel synaptojanin-related protein. The DNA fragment was radiolabeled with [α-32P]dCTP (Amersham Life Science, Inc.) and used as a probe to screen rat brain λZAPII cDNA libraries following standard techniques (20Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The cDNA inserts covering the open reading frame were sequenced on both strands. An anti-synaptojanin 1 mouse monoclonal antibody (AC1) was raised against a GST fusion protein containing amino acids 1156–1286 of synaptojanin 1. An anti-synaptojanin 2 rabbit polyclonal antibody was generated against the 16-amino acid carboxyl-terminal peptide coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin following standard procedures (21Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar). The sequence encoding an 8-amino acid FLAG epitope, DYKDDDDK, was inserted next to the initiation codon of rat synaptojanin cDNAs by a PCR-mediated procedure. The FLAG-tagged cDNA was subcloned into the eukaryotic expression vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). COS7 cells (1.0 × 106 cells/10-cm dish) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal calf serum and transfected with the empty vector or FLAG-tagged synaptojanin construct using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.). After incubation for 24 h, the cells were lysed with 1 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 250 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 5 mm MgCl2, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm benzamidine, 10 μg/ml antipain, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml pepstatin). The lysate was incubated with 10 μg of anti-FLAG antibody M5 (Eastman Kodak Co.) overnight at 4 °C. Immune complexes were collected on protein G-Sepharose beads (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.), and inositol phosphatase activity was assayed using 3H-labeled inositol phosphates (NEN Life Science Products) as described (7McPherson P.S. Garcia E.P. Slepnev V.I. David C. Zhang X. Grabs D. Sossin W.S. Bauerfeind R. Nemoto Y. DeCamilli P. Nature. 1996; 379: 353-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). A Northern blot filter with 2 μg of poly(A)+ RNA from various adult rat tissues (CLONTECH) was probed for synaptojanins 1 and 2 under stringent conditions. DNA fragments used as probes correspond to nucleotides 3,185–4,066 of synaptojanin 1 and nucleotides 3,143–3,799 of synaptojanin 2, i.e. the regions encoding the proline-rich domain. Two probes, corresponding to the 5′-untranslated region and a part of coding sequence (nucleotide 1–340) and to the 3′-untranslated region (nucleotide 4, 489–5033) of synaptojanin 2, were also used. DNA fragments encoding the proline-rich regions of synaptojanins (amino acids 1,015–1,317 of synaptojanin 1, and amino acids 1,030–1,248 of synaptojanin 2) with maltose-binding protein (MBP) at the amino termini and six histidine residues at the carboxyl termini were generated by PCR and subcloning into pMalC2 vector (New England Biolabs). The dually tagged proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 and purified by two consecutive affinity chromatography on amylose resin (New England Biolabs) and Ni-nitriloacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen). The pGEX constructs for production of GST fusion proteins of entire Grb2 or the SH3 domains of amphiphysin 1, SH3p4, and SH3p13 have been described (5McPherson P.S. Czernik A.J. Chilcote T.J. Onofri F. Benfenati F. Greengard P. Schlessinger J. DeCamilli P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6486-6490Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar,14Ringstad N. Nemoto Y. De Camilli P.

FEBS Lett. 1994; 351: 73-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells (1.0 × 105 cells/35-mm dish) were transfected with FLAG-tagged synaptojanin constructs using LipofectAMINE. The cells from a 35-mm dish were scraped into 300 μl of a hypotonic buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 2 mmMgCl2, 0.5 mm EGTA, and protease inhibitors and lysed by sonication. After removal of undisrupted cells by brief centrifugation, the supernatant was further separated into soluble and particulate fractions by centrifuging at 60,000 rpm for 30 min in a Beckman TL-100 centrifuge. FLAG-tagged synaptojanin in each fraction was detected by immunoblotting using anti-FLAG M5 antibody. SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting was performed as described (5McPherson P.S. Czernik A.J. Chilcote T.J. Onofri F. Benfenati F. Greengard P. Schlessinger J. DeCamilli P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6486-6490Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Rat brain fractions were prepared as described (23Huttner W.B. Schiebler W. Greengard P. DeCamilli P. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 96: 1374-1388Crossref PubMed Scopus (894) Google Scholar). Overlay assays and affinity chromatography with recombinant proteins were performed as described (5McPherson P.S. Czernik A.J. Chilcote T.J. Onofri F. Benfenati F. Greengard P. Schlessinger J. DeCamilli P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6486-6490Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). For affinity chromatography, 5 μg of GST fusion protein prebound to glutathione-Sepharose beads was equilibrated in lysis buffer and incubated with lysates of COS7 cells transfected with FLAG-tagged synaptojanin constructs. Bound proteins were released by boiling in SDS sample buffer and detected by immunoblotting with anti-FLAG M5 antibody. The distinguishing structural feature of synaptojanin among inositol 5′-phosphatases is the presence of an amino-terminalSacI domain preceding the inositol 5′-phosphatase domain (7McPherson P.S. Garcia E.P. Slepnev V.I. David C. Zhang X. Grabs D. Sossin W.S. Bauerfeind R. Nemoto Y. DeCamilli P. Nature. 1996; 379: 353-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar,24Majerus P.W. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1051-1053Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). We therefore designed degenerate primers to sequences conserved among SacI domains and inositol 5′-phosphatase domains to amplify synaptojanin-related cDNA fragments from adult rat brain mRNA by reverse transcriptase PCR. By sequence analysis, one of the PCR products was found to encode a portion of a novel synaptojanin-related protein, which we refer to as synaptojanin 2. The PCR fragment was used as probe to screen rat brain libraries to identify the synaptojanin 2 cDNA. Sequence analysis of the composite synaptojanin 2 cDNA revealed an open reading frame of 3,747 nucleotides encoding a protein of 1,248 amino acids with a predicted M r of 138,268, highly homologous to synaptojanin 1 (Fig. 1). The first ATG in the cDNA sequence is likely to represent the initiatior codon for rat synaptojanin 2, as the surrounding sequence conforms well to the functional eukaryotic initiation consensus (25Kozak M. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 229-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (2810) Google Scholar), and it aligns with the initiator codon of synaptojanin 1. The deduced synaptojanin 2 amino acid sequence has the same 3 domain structure as synaptojanin 1: an amino-terminal SacI homology region, a central inositol 5′-phosphatase homology region, and a carboxyl-terminal proline-rich region. Hydropathy analysis indicates the absence of a transmembrane domain in both synaptojanin isoforms. The amino-terminal portions of two synaptojanin isoforms are very similar, with 57.2% and 53.8% identity in their SacI and phosphatase domains, respectively. By contrast, the carboxyl-terminal proline-rich regions differ markedly in length and amino acid sequence. We expressed FLAG epitope-tagged synaptojanin 2 in COS7 cells to test its enzymatic activity. As shown in Fig.2 A, FLAG-tagged synaptojanin 2 cDNA induces the expression of a 140-kDa protein, which migrates slightly faster than FLAG-tagged synaptojanin 1, in good agreement with the predicted M r of synaptojanin 2. The 140-kDa protein was specifically recognized by an antibody raised against the the carboxyl terminus of synaptojanin 2 but not by an anti-synaptojanin 1 antibody, as expected from the divergence of their proline-rich regions used as antigens. Recombinant synaptojanin 2 immunoprecipitated from COS7 cells dephosphorylated inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate to generate inositol 1,4-bisphosphate and inositol 1,3,4-trisphosphate, respectively (Fig. 2 B). Neither inositol 1,4-bisphosphate nor inositol 1,3,4-trisphosphate were hydrolyzed (data not shown). These results indicate that synaptojanin 2 has an inositol 5′-phosphatase activity, as does synaptojanin 1. The tissue distributions of synaptojanins 1 and 2 were determined by Northern blot analysis. Fig. 3 shows the results obtained with probes derived from their most divergent carboxyl-terminal proline-rich regions. In agreement with previous studies (6McPherson P.S. Takei K. Schmid S.L. DeCamilli P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30132-30139Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Ramjaun A.R. McPherson P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24856-24861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), a single 7.5-kb transcript was detected by the synaptojanin 1 probe, which is expressed predominantly in rat brain but also in all other tissues at much lower levels. By contrast, the synaptojanin 2 probe detected multiple transcripts in various tissues. The same blot was hybridized with other probes derived from the 5′- and 3′-noncoding regions of the synaptojanin 2 cDNA. The 5′-probe hybridized to all the transcripts while the 3′-probe hybridized to the 7.5-, 7.2-, 6.0-, and 5.2-kb transcripts but not to a testis-specific 3.5-kb transcript (data not shown). Taken together with the high stringency condition used, we concluded that the observed bands represent multiple synaptojanin 2 transcripts, probably generated by alternative splicing. Proline-rich peptides are implicated in protein-protein interaction with several specific motifs such as SH3 domains and WW domains (27Pawson T. Nature. 1995; 373: 573-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (2234) Google Scholar, 28Sudol M. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1996; 65: 113-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Earlier studies have identified the SH3 domains of Grb2, amphiphysins 1 and 2, and SH3p4/8/13 proteins as interacting partners for the proline-rich region of synaptojanin 1 (5McPherson P.S. Czernik A.J. Chilcote T.J. Onofri F. Benfenati F. Greengard P. Schlessinger J. DeCamilli P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6486-6490Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar,10David C.

Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1355-1367Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). To compare the SH3 domain binding properties of synaptojanins 1 and 2, we first overlaid bacterially expressed proline-rich portions of the two synaptojanins with GST-Grb2 and GST-fusion proteins of other SH3 domains. Consistent with earlier reports (6McPherson P.S. Takei K. Schmid S.L. DeCamilli P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30132-30139Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7McPherson P.S. Garcia E.P.

U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8569-8574Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar), the proline-rich region of synaptojanin 1 binds to Grb2, as well as to SH3 domains of amphiphysin, SH3p4p, and SH3p13p. In contrast, the proline-rich region of synaptojanin 2 binds only to GST-Grb2 and not detectably to the GST fusions of the other SH3 domains (Fig.4 A). To examine whether full-length synaptojanin 2 would specifically associate with Grb2, we then conducted affinity chromatography onto the GST-fusion proteins using FLAG-tagged synaptojanins expressed in COS7 cells. Again, synaptojanin 2 binds only to GST-Grb2 in the assay (Fig.4 B). The absence of the interaction between the proline-rich region of synaptojanin 2 and the SH3 domain of amphiphysin 1, amphiphysin 2, SH3p4, SH3p8, or SH3p13 was further corroborated by yeast 2-hybrid assays (data not shown; Ref. 14Ringstad N. Nemoto Y. De Camilli P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8569-8574Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). These results indicate that the protein binding properties of the proline-rich regions of synaptojanin isoforms are quite different, and that, despite the close structural similarity among the SH3 domains of Grb2 and SH3p4/8/13 proteins (14Ringstad N. Nemoto Y. De Camilli P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8569-8574Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar), only Grb2 specifically associates with the proline-rich region of synaptojanin 2 in vitro. The proline-rich regions in several proteins are known to mediate their subcellular localizations (27Pawson T. Nature. 1995; 373: 573-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (2234) Google Scholar). We therefore examined the subcellular distribution of epitope-tagged synaptojanin isoforms in the transfected cells. As shown in Fig. 5, synaptojanin 1 was mainly located in the cytosolic fraction, and a small portion was present in the particulate fraction, in agreement with previous results on the subcellular distribution of native synaptojanin 1 (145-kDa form) in rat tissues (6McPherson P.S. Takei K. Schmid S.L. DeCamilli P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30132-30139Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Ramjaun A.R. McPherson P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24856-24861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). By contrast, recombinant synaptojanin 2 was recovered predominantly in the particulate fraction. Since the initial description of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate 5′-phosphatase activity in human erythrocytes (30Downes C.P. Mussat M.C. Michell R.H. Biochem. J. 1982; 203: 169-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar), the enzyme activity was detected in various tissues, and several enzymes were purified and characterized (reviewed in Ref. 31Majerus P.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 225-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). The multiplicity of this group of enzymes has been expanded by the recent identification of several inositol 5′-phosphatases with molecular cloning techniques (24Majerus P.W. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1051-1053Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Of the mammalian inositol 5′-phosphatases identified so far, only synaptojanins 1 and 2 have the same unique domain structure. Among the purified enzymes whose identity has not been established, a 160-kDa inositol 5′-phosphatase in rat brain (32Hansen C.A. Johanson R.A. Williamson M.T. Williamson J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 17319-17326Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and a 155-kDa phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate 5′-phosphatase in bovine brain (33Palmer F.B. Theolis Jr., R. Cook H.W. Byers D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3403-3410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have molecular masses close to that of synaptojanin 2. However, they were isolated from cytosolic fraction. Their subcellular localization is not consistent with the particulate localization of synaptojanin 2, which is suggested by the analysis on recombinant synaptojanin 2 expressed in cultured cells. To our knowledge, so far there has been no report of a membrane-associated 140-kDa inositol 5′-phosphatase. In many tissues such as erythrocytes, liver, pancreas, macrophages, and brain, the major inositol 5′-phosphatase activity resides in the particulate fraction (Ref. 31Majerus P.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 225-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar and references therein). These particulate activities have not been thoroughly characterized, and their relationship to synaptojanin 2 remains to be defined. Two well characterized inositol 5′-phosphatases, the 43-kDa type I 5′-phosphatase and the 75-kDa type II 5′-phosphatase, which are present both in cytosolic and membrane fractions in various tissues (34Erneux C. Lemos M. Verjans B. Vanderhaeghen P. Delvaux A. Dumont J.E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 181: 317-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 35Mitchell C.A. Connolly T.M. Majerus P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8873-8877Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), have consensus motifs for isoprenylation at the carboxyl termini. The modification is shown to be responsible for their membrane attachment (36De Smedt F. Boom A. Pesesse X. Schiffmann S.N. Erneux C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10419-10424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 37Jefferson A.B. Majerus P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9370-9377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Conceivably, membrane association of inositol 5′-phosphatases would place the enzymes in proximity to membrane inositol phospholipids, thereby making them more accessible to membrane inositol phospholipids than to soluble inositol phosphates. Indeed, Jefferson and Majerus reported that the non-isoprenylated carboxyl-terminal cysteine mutant of 75-kDa type II 5′-phosphatase was relatively less active than the wild-type enzyme toward phosphatidyl 4,5-bisphosphate (37Jefferson A.B. Majerus P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9370-9377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). As the predicted amino acid sequence for synaptojanin 2 does not end with an isoprenylation consensus motif, the membrane association of synaptojanin 2 must be regulated through a different mechanism, possibly by protein-protein interaction at the proline-rich region. The high degree of homology in the amino-terminal SacI and central inositol 5′-phosphatase domains of synaptojanin isoforms suggests that these domains perform a common biochemical function and that their divergent carboxyl-terminal proline-rich regions play an important role in specifying the physiological function. This scenario is reminiscent of what has been found for mammalian isoforms of dynamin, a GTPase critically required for endocytosis (38Urrutia R. Henley J.R. Cook T. McNiven M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 377-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). However, the protein binding properties of the proline-rich regions of synaptojanins 1 and 2 are strikingly different, whereas dynamin isoforms exhibit very similar SH3-protein binding patterns (39Okamoto P.M. Herskovits J.S. Vallee R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11629-11635Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). This implys that synaptojanin isoforms interact with a unique combination of partner proteins, are recruited to different subcellular destinations, and selectively act on specific pools of inositol metabolites. The recent completion of yeast genome sequencing has revealed that S. cerevisiae has four inositol 5′-phosphatase-related genes and that three of the gene products have the same three-domain architecture as synaptojanin (40Goffeau A. et al.Nature. 1997; 387: 1-105Google Scholar, 41Srinivasan S. Seaman M. Nemoto Y. Daniell L. Suchy S.F. Emr S. DeCamilli P. Nussbaum R. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 73 (in press)Google Scholar). This underscores the fundamental importance of synaptojanin-related enzymes in cell physiology. We therefore speculate that mammalian synaptojanin family members participate in the regulation of diverse cellular processes. Future studies on the synaptojanin family may lead to the elucidation of novel aspects of inositol metabolism in membrane dynamics and signal transduction pathways (3Toker A. Cantley L.C. Nature. 1997; 387: 673-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (1229) Google Scholar, 4DeCamilli P. Emr S.D. McPherson P.S. Novick P. Science. 1996; 271: 1533-1539Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar).

A series of TRAF3 deletion mutants reveal that a subregion of the coiled coil motif is required for efficient recruitment to the LTβR. Furthermore, the ability of TRAF3 to self-associate maps to an adjacent subregion. A TRAF3 deletion mutant that lacks the N-terminal zinc RING and zinc finger motifs, but retains the coiled coil and TRAF-C motifs, competitively displaces endogenous TRAF3 from the LTβR. A second TRAF3 mutant that lacks the receptor binding domain, yet contains the TRAF3 self-association domain, prevents TRAF3 homodimers from being recruited to the LTβR. Both of these mutants have a dominant negative effect on cell death and demonstrate that the recruitment of TRAF3 oligomers is necessary to initiate signal transduction that activates the cell death pathway.

Cell surface LT is comprised of two subunits, LTα and β, arranged as a heterotrimer of LTα1β2 stochiometry (2Androlewicz M.J. Browning J.L. Ware C.F. J. Biol.

LTβR is expressed on most cell types, including cells of epithelial and myeloid lineages but is conspicuously absent on T and B lymphocytes (3Force W.R. Walter B.N. Hession C. Tizard R. Kozak C.A.

TRAF molecules display a distinct arrangement of structural motifs with multiple zinc binding motifs at the N terminus, which includes a RING finger and several zinc fingers (16Freemont P.S. Ann. N.

Cell. 1994; 78: 681-692Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (929) Google Scholar). The N-terminal region of TRAFs 2, 5, and 6 is the effector domain that controls activation of NFκB (14Nakano H.

The C-terminal half of a TRAF molecule is known as the “TRAF” domain that displays a high degree of sequence homology that defines the TRAF family of signal transducers. The TRAF domain can be subdivided into N-terminal (TRAF-N) and C-terminal (TRAF-C) domains. The TRAF-N domain contains a region of α-helix-forming potential, which in TRAF3 and TRAF5 is an extended coiled coil domain (14Nakano H. Oshima H. Chung W. Williams-Abbott L. Ware C. Yagita H. Okumura K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14661-14664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). The TRAF domain is thought to be responsible for binding to the cytoplasmic tail of the TNFRs as defined by protein interaction assays, such as yeast-2 hybrid or GST fusion proteins (12Mosialos G.

TRAF3 interacts with several members of the TNFR superfamily including LTβR, CD40, CD30, and TNFR80 (CD120b) (9VanArsdale T.L. VanArsdale S.L. Force W.R. Walter B.N. Mosialos G. Kieff E. Reed J.C.

Dixit V.M. Goeddel D.V. Science. 1995; 269: 1424-1427Crossref PubMed Scopus (975) Google Scholar), a feature observed for other TRAFs. TRAF3 association with the LTβR is ligand-dependent and occurs within a minute following addition of LTα1β2 or agonist antibodies, whereas its association with LMP1 is constitutive (9VanArsdale T.L. VanArsdale S.L. Force W.R. Walter B.N. Mosialos G. Kieff E. Reed J.C. Ware C.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2460-2465Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 12Mosialos G.

Mice lacking TRAF3 by gene deletion exhibit a profound failure in homeostasis of the hemopoietic system and other organ systems, and exhibit a specific defect in T cell responses to antigens (24Xu Y. Cheng G. Baltimore D. Immunity. 1996; 5: 407-415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). It is unclear how TRAF3 signals these functions; however, a role for TRAF3 is beginning to emerge as a regulator of cell viability. Deletion of the N-terminal half of TRAF3 creates a dominant negative mutant that effects LTβR-mediated death but not activation of NFκB (9VanArsdale T.L. VanArsdale S.L. Force W.R. Walter B.N. Mosialos G. Kieff E. Reed J.C. Ware C.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2460-2465Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) indicating a bifurcation in the LTβR signaling pathway. This mutant did not alter death induced by Fas, clearly distinguishing those pathways initiated by the death domain receptors and the TRAF binding receptors, all of which can induce apoptosis in different contexts (9VanArsdale T.L. VanArsdale S.L. Force W.R. Walter B.N. Mosialos G. Kieff E. Reed J.C. Ware C.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2460-2465Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Additional evidence linking TRAF3 to cell growth regulation was shown with a dominant negative mutant that suppressed tumor growth mediated by CD40 or LMP1 (21Eliopoulos A.G. Dawson C.W. Mosialos G. Floettmann J.E. Rowe M. Armitage R.J. Dawson J. Zapata J.M. Kerr D.J. Wakelam M.J. Reed J.C. Kieff E. Young L.S. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 2243-2254PubMed Google Scholar). Overexpression of TRAF3 does not directly activate NFκB, unlike TRAF2, 5, or 6 (14Nakano H. Oshima H. Chung W. Williams-Abbott L. Ware C. Yagita H. Okumura K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14661-14664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar, 23Rothe M. Sarma V. Dixit V.M. Goeddel D.V.

Nature. 1996; 383: 443-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (1117) Google Scholar), but TRAF3 was shown to suppress NFκB activity induced by CD40, TNFR80, and LMP1 (23Rothe M. Sarma V. Dixit V.M. Goeddel D.V.

Science. 1996; 274: 782-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (2931) Google Scholar, 28Van Antwerp D.J. Martin S.J. Kafri T. Green D.R. Verma I.M. Science. 1996; 274: 787-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (2445) Google Scholar) further implicates TRAF3 as a regulator of cell death. Our previous study of a TRAF3 mutant (Δ1–367) that blocked cell death signaled by LTβR indicated that the mutant protein did not displace endogenous TRAF3 from the LTβR but was recruited to the LTβR at an equimolar ratio with endogenous TRAF3 (9VanArsdale T.L. VanArsdale S.L. Force W.R. Walter B.N. Mosialos G. Kieff E. Reed J.C. Ware C.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2460-2465Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). The simplest explanation of this data was that the TRAF3 mutant-blocked recruitment of an effector molecule, possibly TRAF3 itself, implying that self-association of TRAF3 may be crucial for propagation of signals for cell death. To address this issue we have made several deletion mutants of TRAF3 to assess their function in cell death mediated by LTβR by measuring their ability to directly bind LTβR, to self-associate and to form signaling complexes with the LTβR. The results indicate that the formation of TRAF3 oligomers is required for signal transduction through LTβR and that the coiled coil region of TRAF3 is critical for recruitment to the LTβR. Recombinant human TNF (29Browning J. Ribolini A. J. Immunol. 1989; 143: 1859-1867PubMed Google Scholar) and soluble LTα1β2 (30Browning J.L. Miatkowski K. Griffiths D.A. Bourdon P.R. Hession C.

Anti-Fas mouse IgM monoclonal CH11 was obtained from MBL, Nagoya, Japan. M2 and M5 anti-Flag IgG1 monoclonal antibodies were obtained from Eastman Kodak Co. HT29.14s cells were obtained from Jeffrey Browning (6Browning J.L. Miatkowski K. Sizing I. Griffiths D.A. Zafari M. Benjamin C.D. Meier W. Mackay F. J. Exp.

Myc-LTβR-293 cells were generated by infection with retrovirus expressing the Myc-epitope-tagged LTβR as described below. Overexpression of Myc-LTβR was confirmed by flow cytometric analysis of Myc-LTβR-293 cells with an anti-Myc monoclonal antibody 9E10 (data not shown). All cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) with 10% fetal bovine serum. The Flag epitope-tagged TRAF3 (Flag-TRAF3) mutants were created by PCR amplification from TRAF3 coding sequences using the pSG5-LAP1 vector as template (12Mosialos G. Birkenbach M. Yalamanchili R. VanArsdale T. Ware C. Kieff E. Cell. 1995; 80: 389-399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (903) Google Scholar) and oligonucleotide pairs as shown below. The resulting PCR products were digested with EcoRI/BamHI and ligated into theEcoRI/BamHI site of pFlag-CMV-2 (Kodak). The following primer pairs were used for T3(Δ117–568), A and J; T3(Δ274–578), A and B, T3(Δ382–568), A and G; T3(aa114–381), F and G, T3(aa114–273), F and B; T3(Δ1–339), K and H; T3(Δ1–388), C and H; T3(Δ1–258), D and H; T3(Δ1–114), F and H. Primer sequences are as follows: A, 5′-GTATGAATCAGAGTCGAGTAAAAAGATGG-3′; B, 5′-TTAGGATCCCTT CTTTTCGAGCGAGTT-3′; C, 5′-GTATGAATTCAGACCAGATGCTGAGTGT-3′; D, 5′-GTATGAATTCACACGTCAACCTGCTGA-3′; F, 5′-GTATGAATTCACAG ATCTATTGTCGGAATG-3′; G, 5′-TTATGGATCCAGCAGGCCTGTGTTC; H, 5′-TATGGATCCTACTTATCAGGGATCGG-3′; J, 5′-TTAGGATCCACAATAGATC TGAAGAGCC-3′; K, 5′-TTAGGATCCTTCCGGCAGAACTGGGAG-3′. The coding regions of the Flag-TRAF3 mutants were inserted into the Moloney murine leukemia virus-based vector pBABEpuro, which contains a puromycin resistance gene (31Morgenstern J.P. Land H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). TRAF3 mutants in pFlag-CMV-2 were used as a template for PCR. The PCR products were generated using the following primer pair; 5′-GTGGAGCGAGATCTACCATGGACTAC-3′ and 5′-GATACCGTCGACTGGAGTGGCAACTT-3′. PCR products were digested withBglII/SalI and ligated into theBamHI/SalI site of pBABEpuro. Myc-LTβR-pBABE was constructed by replacing the N-terminal 27 amino acids of human LTβR with a type I leader sequence and a c-Myc decapeptide epitope followed by subcloning into pBABEpuro using the following strategy. Human LTβR cDNA sequence was generated by PCR using a 5′ primer containing an AlwNI site (5′-CCGGTCCAGAAGCTGTCGCAGCCCCAGGCGGTGCCT-3′), a 3′ primer containing aSalI site (5′-GGAACGCGTCGACCCGTCAGTCATGGGTGATAAATTGGT-3′), and LTβR cDNA as a template (1Crowe P.D.

The 1255-base pair LTβR PCR product was digested with SalI and subjected to partial digestion withAlwNI to produce a 1235-base pairAlwNI/SalI fragment. The c-Myc cassette complete with leader sequence was obtained by linearization of sLTβ-Myc in pCDM8 on the 3′ side of c-Myc with AlwNI followed by ligation of the c-Myc coding region, in frame, to the 1235-base pairAlwNI/SalI LTβR fragment (1Crowe P.D.

The ligation mix was subjected to PCR using a 5′ primer containing a BglII site 5′-GGAACGCGTCGACCCGTCAGTCATGGGTGA-3′ and the 3′ primer 5′-CCGTCCCACCATCGGGCGCGGATCAGATCT-3′ to amplify the desired full-length 1400-base pair Myc-tagged LTβR PCR product. The PCR product was purified, cut with BglII and SalI, and ligated into the BamHI and SalI sites of pBABEpuro to create Myc-LTβR-pBABE. PCR was performed using pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). PCR and ligation products were purified using Wizard PCR Preps DNA purification system (Promega, Madison, WI). Moloney retroviral virions were produced as described (32Pear W.S. Nolan G.P. Scott M.L. Baltimore D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8392-8396Crossref PubMed Scopus (2291) Google Scholar). Briefly, the Phoenix (φNX) amphotrophic packaging cell line was plated at 2.5 × 106cells/10-cm2 culture dish for 18–24 h before transfection (33Shaw M.K. Lorens J.B. Dhawan A. DalCanto R. Tse H.Y.

Cells were transfected with 7 μg of the desired pBABEpuro construct using a standard calcium phosphate protocol as described (34Force W.R. Tillman J.B. Sprung C.N. Spindler S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8863-8871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) except chloroquine (25 μm final) was added to the cells 5 min prior to addition of the CaPO4 DNA precipitate. For production of control virus supernatants used for mock infections, Phoenix cells were transfected with the pBABEpuro vector. After 24 h the cells were gently washed, and fresh medium was added. Virus-containing supernatant was harvested at 24 h after transfection and stored at 4 °C. For virus infection HT29.14s or 293 cells plated at 1 × 106/10-cm2 dish (approximately 30% confluency) were infected with 3 ml of viral supernatant containing 5 μg/ml polybrene for 3 h. The virus supernatant was diluted with 5 ml of fresh medium containing 5 μg/ml polybrene, and the cells were then cultured overnight. 48 h after infection, cells were selected with puromycin (1 μg/ml). Typically 50–90% of the infected cells survived puromycin selection, and all assays described were performed within 1–2 weeks following selection. TRAF proteins were generated in vitro using a TnT T7 coupled wheat germ extract kit (Promega) and [35S]methionine (1175 Ci/mmol, in vitro translation grade, ICN, Costa Mesa, CA). A T7 promoter was introduced 5′ of the TRAF coding region by PCR using the TRAF mutants in pFlag-CMV-2 as template and the primers 5′-TAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAGGTCTATATAAGCAG-3′ and 5′-CTAGAGATGGGGTCACAGGGATG-3′. The PCR products (∼1 μg each) were used directly as templates for the in vitrotranscription/translation reaction. Construction of the fusion proteins between LTβR cytoplasmic domain and glutathioneS-transferase (LTβR-GST) have been described (9VanArsdale T.L. VanArsdale S.L. Force W.R. Walter B.N. Mosialos G.

Binding assays using LTβR-GST or GST (2 μg of protein/reaction) bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads were incubated with 18 fmol of each35S-labeled protein in 0.5 ml of binding buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol in phosphate-buffered saline) as described (12Mosialos G. Birkenbach M. Yalamanchili R. VanArsdale T. Ware C. Kieff E. Cell. 1995; 80: 389-399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (903) Google Scholar). Dried gels were visualized using PhosphorImaging (Molecular Dynamics Storm). 35[S]methionine-TRAF3 was quantitated by trichloroacetic acid precipitation and scintillation counting of thein vitro translation product. A reference gel relating density volume of the band image to radioactivity was generated by Molecular Dynamics ImageQuant software. The moles of TRAF3 or mutants in the receptor-bound fraction were then calculated from the image density. Nonspecific binding of 35S-TRAF3 or mutants to GST alone was <0.04% of the input. For metabolic labeling of HT29.14s cells and direct immunoprecipitation of TRAFs with the anti-Flag monoclonal M2, HT29.14s were plated at 1.5 × 106 cells/10 cm2, 18 h prior to labeling with [35S]methionine (Express Label, NEN life Science Products, 45.3 TBq/mmol) as described (9VanArsdale T.L.

Detergent lysates were prepared with 1% Nonidet P-40 nonionic detergent. Extracts were precleared twice with 25 μl of protein G-Sepharose beads and 5 μg of mouse IgG1. Immunoprecipitation of Flag-tagged proteins was then carried out by the addition of 5 μg of M2 and 25 μl of protein G-Sepharose beads followed by mixing for 2 h. The beads were washed, and the proteins were eluted and subjected to SDS-PAGE as described (9VanArsdale T.L. VanArsdale S.L. Force W.R. Walter B.N. Mosialos G. Kieff E. Reed J.C. Ware C.F. Proc.

Cell monolayers were extracted with a 1% Triton X-100 containing buffer and subjected to immunoprecipitation with goat anti-LTβR IgG. After SDS-PAGE, the gel was blotted onto polyvinylidene fluoride membrane, and TRAF3 was detected with a rabbit anti-TRAF3 antiserum (9VanArsdale T.L. VanArsdale S.L. Force W.R. Walter B.N.

The TRAF3 antiserum was used at a 1:1000 dilution and showed no cross-reactivity in Western blots with TRAF1, 2 or 5. For demonstration of TRAF3 self-association 293 cells (2 × 106) were transfected with 7 μg of pSG5-TRAF3 along with 7 μg of the indicated TRAF3 mutant in pFlag-CMV-2. DNA content was normalized to 14 μg total using the appropriate parent vector. Cells were harvested 48 h after transfection as described above and immunoprecipitated with N-terminal specific anti-TRAF3 antibody (rabbit anti-CRAF1, [H2O] Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. Santa Cruz, CA). Flag-TRAF3 proteins were detected by Western analysis using Immobilon-P transfer membrane (Millipore, MA). After transfer the membrane was blocked in 2% gelatin in TBS (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl) for 2 h at 37 °C followed by blocking with 7.5% skim milk in TBS for 2 h at room temperature. Flag-TRAF3 proteins were detected using an anti-Flag monoclonal antibody M5 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) at 2 μg/ml in TBS-Tween (0.05% Tween 20) for 30 min at room temperature. After two brief washes in TBS-Tween, membranes were treated with sheep anti-mouse Ig (horseradish peroxidase conjugated, Amersham) and illuminated using an ECL detection kit (Amersham). To detect binding of the Flag-TRAF3 mutants to LTβR in 293 cells, Myc-LTβR-293 cells were transfected with 7 μg of the indicated TRAF3 plasmid. 48 h after transfection the cells were treated with LTα1β2 for 15 min prior to harvesting. Cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with a goat anti-LTβR antibody (9VanArsdale T.L. VanArsdale S.L. Force W.R. Walter B.N. Mosialos G. Kieff E. Reed J.C. Ware C.F. Proc. Natl. Acad.

For preparation of whole cells extract, 5 × 105 cells were lysed by boiling in lysis buffer (1% SDS, 50 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 20 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaF, 1 mmorthovanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2.5% 2-mercaptoethanol) for 15 min. Cell viability in response to cytokines or antibodies was determined by a mitochondria dye-reduction assay using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) as described (9VanArsdale T.L. VanArsdale S.L. Force W.R. Walter B.N. Mosialos G. Kieff E. Reed J.C. Ware C.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2460-2465Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). For dose response curves HT29.14s cells were treated with the indicated amount of TNF or LTα1β2in the presence of 80 units/ml human interferon gamma (IFNγ)(6). Cells were subjected to MTT analysis 72 h later. TRAF3 is comprised of an N-terminal zinc RING and zinc finger motif and a C-terminal TRAF domain that is divided into an N- and C-terminal region (Fig.1). Separating these domains is a region of high α-helix potential, the coiled coil or leucine zipper domain, which precedes the TRAF-N domain. The coiled coil domain of TRAF3 is predicted to be tripartate in structure with three distinct coil regions (Fig. 1) (35Lupas A. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 266: 513-525Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 36Parry D.A. Biosci. Rep. 1982; 2: 1017-1024Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar) where coils 1 and 2 are separated by a single amino acid. Deletion mutants of TRAF3 that roughly demarcate the domains of TRAF3 were studied for their ability to bind LTβR (Fig.1). LTβR-GST binds full-length TRAF3 with high efficiency with >20% of the input TRAF3 represented in the bound fraction (Fig.1 B). LTβR bound to the RING finger deletion mutant T3(Δ1–113) and the RING/zinc finger mutant T3(Δ1–258) with efficiency comparable to wild type TRAF3. By contrast deletion of coils 1 and 2 of the coiled coil domain with T3(Δ1–339) resulted in a >90% loss of TRAF3 binding to LTβR-GST illustrating the importance of coils 1 and 2 to TRAF3-receptor interactions. Deletion of coil 3 resulted in an additional loss of binding demonstrating that the TRAF-C domain is only capable of weakly interacting with LTβR. T3(Δ382–568) and T3(aa114–381) contain coils 1 and 2 and failed to bind LTβR-GST suggesting that sequences, which are C-terminal to all three coils, are necessary to support high efficiency binding of TRAF3 to LTβR. To compare the recruitment efficiency of the TRAF3 mutants in intact cells, Myc-LTβR-293 cells were transfected with each of the Flag-TRAF3 deletion mutants. Full-length Flag-TRAF3 co-immunoprecipitated with the LTβR as expected (Fig.2 A). TRAF3 mutants T3(Δ1–113) and T3(Δ1–258), which contain the entire coiled coil domain, were also recruited to the receptor-sig"

Recently the small GTPases Rac and Cdc42 have been shown to selectively activate c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling without affecting MAP kinase (MAPK), 1The abbreviations used are: MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; IL-1, interleukin-1; TNF-α, tumor necrosis factor-α; PI 3-kinase, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; kb, kilobase(s); PCR, polymerase chain reaction; TPA, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase; bp, base pair(s); INF-γ, interferon-γ; GDI, guanine-dissociation inhibitor; UVC, UV light (254 nm). 1The abbreviations used are: MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; IL-1, interleukin-1; TNF-α, tumor necrosis factor-α; PI 3-kinase, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; kb, kilobase(s); PCR, polymerase chain reaction; TPA, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase; bp, base pair(s); INF-γ, interferon-γ; GDI, guanine-dissociation inhibitor; UVC, UV light (254 nm). whereas RhoA does not act on JNK nor MAPK (11Minden A.

JNK represents a family of closely related enzymes which are activated by cellular stress; they are therefore also named as stress-activated protein kinases (p46/p54 SAPK) (14Kyriakis J.M.

Karin M. Davis R.J. Cell. 1994; 76: 1025-1037Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2949) Google Scholar). JNK activity is strongly stimulated by inhibitors of protein biosynthesis, such as cycloheximide and anisomycin, by inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α and IL-1 and by ultraviolet (UV) light or other DNA-damaging agents (14Kyriakis J.M.

Activated JNKs are thought to phosphorylate the transactivation domain of c-Jun, thereby strongly increasing the transactivating activity of AP-1. This is the way the expression of various AP-1 dependent genes, including c-junitself, is controlled (17Angel P. Bhattari K. Smeal T. Karin M. Cell. 1988; 55: 875-885Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (986) Google Scholar).Recently, it turned out that JNK-dependent phosphorylation of ATF-2, which can dimerize with c-Jun, is the major mechanism mediating c-jun induction upon genotoxic stress (18van Dam H. Wilhelm D. Herr I. Steffen A. Herrlich P. Angel P. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1798-1811Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar). The finding that UV-induced expression of c-fos is regulated by JNK-mediated phosphorylation of TCF/Elk-1 (19Cavigelli M. Dolfi F. Claret F.-X. Karin M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5957-5964Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar) indicates a central role of JNK (stress-activated protein kinases) in the regulation of DNA damage-induced expression of the immediate-early genes c-junand c-fos. It has been supposed that the protein kinase phosphorylating c-Jun in response to TPA treatment is distinct from JNK and does not act on ATF-2 (18van Dam H. Wilhelm D. Herr I. Steffen A. Herrlich P. Angel P. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1798-1811Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar). Another important mechanism involved in the regulation of early mammalian responses to genotoxic stress is based on the activation of tyrosine kinases, c-Ha-ras and MAPK (20Sachsenmaier C. Radler-Pohl A. Zinck R. Nordheim A. Herrlich P. Rahmsdorf H.J. Cell. 1994; 78: 963-972Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar,21Devary Y. Gottlieb R.A. Smeal T. Karin M. Cell. 1992; 71: 1081-1091Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (795) Google Scholar). Since overexpression of activated Ha-Ras elicits JNK activity (15Derijard B. Hibi M. Wu I.H. Barrett T. Deng T. Karin M. Davis R.J. Cell. 1994; 76: 1025-1037Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2949) Google Scholar), a cross-talk between JNK and MAPK signaling appears to be possible. JNK are not activated by TPA, and to a much lesser extent by growth factors than ERK1/2 (14Kyriakis J.M. Banerjee P. Nikolakaki E. Dai T. Rubie E.A. Ahmad M.F. Avruch J. Woodgett J.R.

Chem. 1995; 270: 5620-5624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Furthermore, induction of c-fos and c-jun by inhibitors of protein biosynthesis is thought to be mainly due to the activation of JNK (22Cano E. Hazzalin C.A. Mahadevan L.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7352-7362Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar,23Zinck R. Cahill M.A. Kracht M. Sachsenmaier C. Hipskind R.A. Nordheim A. Mol. Cell.

Recently it was shown that, beside JNK and ERK, p38 MAP kinase cascade also interferes with stress-induced signaling (24Wang X.Z. Ron D.

Cell Biol. 1995; 73: 703-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). This signaling pathway can also be stimulated by Cdc42 and Rac (28Zhang S. Han J. Sells M.A. Chernoff J. Knaus U.G.

Kaina B. Aktories K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25172-25177Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). RhoB distinguishes from other Rho species (e.g. RhoA and RhoC) in its inducibility by both growth factors and DNA damaging agents, such as UV light and alkylating agents (30Fritz G. Kaina B. Aktories K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25172-25177Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 31Jähner D. Hunter T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3682-3690Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), as well as by its intracellular localization (32Adamson P. Paterson H.F. Hall A. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 617-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). Thus, the physiological function of RhoB appears to be different from RhoA and RhoC which are thought to function mainly in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton (10Hall A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 3: 475-479Crossref Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Similar to c-fos and c-jun, the amount of rhoB mRNA is very rapidly enhanced after treatment of cells with cycloheximide, growth factors, and genotoxic agents. However, in contrast to c-fosand c-jun, the phorbol ester TPA did not elicit increase inrhoB mRNA expression (30Fritz G. Kaina B. Aktories K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25172-25177Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 31Jähner D. Hunter T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3682-3690Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). This lack of TPA response prompted us to hypothesize that the regulation of rhoBexpression is different from that of c-jun and c-fos.In the present study, we aimed at elucidating the regulation ofrhoB on the level of the promoter. Having cloned the mouse gene for rhoB and analyzed its promoter region, we demonstrate that rhoB promoter activity is autoregulated by small GTPases of the Rho family. Furthermore, based on sequence data as well as inhibitor studies, we suggest a signal transduction pathway which is independent from JNK, ERK, and p38 MAP kinase to be involved in the UV stimulation of the rhoB promoter.DISCUSSIONExposure of eukaryotic cells to genotoxic agents induces a variety of responses including the activation of cellular growth factor receptors and Src tyrosine kinases (20Sachsenmaier C.

Among the DNA damage inducible genes, most interest has focused on the immediate-early genes c-fos and c-jun. It is believed that both the receptor mediated activation of MAPK (20Sachsenmaier C.

Karin M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5957-5964Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar, 59Hill C.S. Treisman R. Cell. 1995; 80: 201-211Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (1195) Google Scholar). The induction of therhoB gene, which codes for a Ras-related small GTPase, is another very early event after exposure of cells to DNA damaging agents (30Fritz G. Kaina B. Aktories K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25172-25177Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Induction of RhoB appears to be of particular interest because GTP-binding proteins can induce changes in the activity of their downstream targets very rapidly. Thus they may quickly trigger subsequent responses which are supposed to be protective. In contrast to c-fos and c-jun, rhoB expression is not stimulated by the phorbol ester TPA (30Fritz G. Kaina B. Aktories K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25172-25177Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 31Jähner D. Hunter T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3682-3690Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) which indicates that different signal transduction pathways are involved in the regulation of these immediate-early genes. In this study, we aimed at elucidating mechanisms controlling rhoB expression.To this end, we cloned and analyzed the promoter of the mouserhoB gene. We demonstrate here that the activity of the rhoB promoter was stimulated by genotoxic treatments such as UVC, methyl methanesulfonate, and hydrogen peroxide. The sequence data obtained revealed that the rhoB promoter contains TATA, Sp1, and CAAT box elements as well as consensus sequences for AP-2, AP-4, and p53. Interestingly, consensus sequences for known, UV-activated transcription factors (e.g. AP-1, c-Jun/ATF-2, Elk-1, or CHOP (gadd153)) were not present within the rhoB promoter. Generation of a set of rhoB promoter deletion constructs let us to identify a 0.17-kb rhoB promoter fragment which still retained activator activity upon UV irradiation. Furthermore, this fragment was also subject of stimulation by coexpression of Rac and inhibition by coexpression of RhoB to a similar extend as the original 3.5-kb fragment. Thus we suggest that the regulatory elements required for both positive and negative regulation of rhoB are located within this minimal 0.17-kb rhoB promoter fragment. With the exception of the CAAT and TATA box, the 0.17-kb fragment lacks any binding site for known transcription factors. As indicated by the data obtained from sequence and deletion analysis, two mediators of the UV response, namely AP-1 and p53, appear not to be involved inrhoB regulation. This hypothesis is supported by the finding that cells deficient in either c-fos or p53responded in the same way as wild-type cells do with regard to the extent of UV-induced increase in the amount of rhoB mRNA (data not shown). Thus, our data give evidence for the existence of a novel regulatory element within the rhoB promoter, mediating UV induction according to a yet not described mechanism.To address the question of what kind of signaling might be involved inrhoB induction, we analyzed the effect of overexpression of various small GTPases of the Rho family, which have been shown to participate in genotoxic stress signaling (11Minden A. Lin A. Claret F.-X. Abo A. Karin M. Cell. 1995; 81: 1147-1157Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1444) Google Scholar, 13Coso A.A. Chiariello M. Yu J.-C. Teramoto H. Crespo P. Xu N. Miki T. Gutkind J.S. Cell. 1995; 81: 1137-1146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1559) Google Scholar), on the activity of the rhoB promoter. Interestingly, overexpression of wild-type Rac was sufficient to strongly stimulate rhoBpromoter, whereas wild-type Cdc42 had no effect. As might have been expected, V12Rac exerted a stronger stimulatory effect onrhoB than the wild-type form did. However, even the use of V12Cdc42 did not elicit rhoB promoter activity. Thus, although Rac and Cdc42 share the same signaling activities in respect to activation of JNK and p38 MAP kinase, they obviously distinguish from each other in respect to rhoB regulation. Notably, despite their identical signaling activities on JNK and p38, different physiological activities of Rac and Cdc42 have also been described. For example, Rac has been demonstrated to be involved in the formation of lamellipodia, whereas Cdc42 interferes with the generation of filopodia (60Nobes C.D. Hall A. Cell. 1995; 81: 53-62Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3700) Google Scholar). Furthermore, TNF-α-dependent activation of NF-κB is reported to depend on Cdc42 but not on Rac (61Perona R. Montaner S. Saniger L. Sanchez-Perez I. Bravo R. Lacal J.C. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 463-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). These reports agree with our data in that they clearly show the involvement of Rac and Cdc42 also in different signaling pathways. Although JNK and p38 kinase are known as important kinases in stress-induced signaling, it appears unlikely that these kinases are involved in rhoB regulation because of the following reasons. (i) As mentioned above, no target sequences for transcription factors regulated by these kinases (e.g. c-Jun, ATF-2, Elk-1, and CHOP) were detected within the rhoB promoter. (ii) Inhibition of PI 3-kinase by wortmannin rather blocked UV-mediated activation of JNK and p38 kinase but did not affect UV response of rhoB. (iii) IL-1β rather activated JNK but failed to increase rhoB expression. (iv) p38 inhibitor SB203580 did not inhibit UV stimulation ofrhoB and (v) wild-type Rac is sufficient to activaterhoB but even V12Cdc42 fails to do so. Bearing in mind that TPA is unable to increase rhoB expression and that the MEK inhibitor PD98059 did not block UV stimulation of rhoB, it further appears that ERK also do not participate in rhoBregulation upon UV irradiation. The observation that down-modulation of signaling by TPA pretreatment results in a partial block of UV-inducedrhoB mRNA expression (30Fritz G. Kaina B. Aktories K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25172-25177Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) and also rhoBpromoter activity (data not shown) does not contradict this hypothesis because TPA induced PKC signaling is not limited to ERK. Furthermore, the finding that INF-γ failed to increase rhoB expression may be taken as an indication that JAK's, which are generally activated by INF-γ, are also not involved in rhoBexpression.A further interesting feature of rhoB regulation is its negative feedback regulation by rhoB itself. In this context we would like to emphasize that the inhibitory effect of RhoB on its own expression is already seen with wild-type RhoB. This is important to notice, because it reflects the physiological situation after UV-induced increase in the amount of RhoB. Thus, the responsiveness ofrhoB to wild-type RhoB also provides strong evidence that the observed autoregulation of rhoB is physiologically relevant. Since inhibition of rhoB expression was already ∼90% with wild-type RhoB, it was difficult to detect stronger effects even by use of activated RhoB. Thus it was not surprising that we observed V14RhoB to elicit a similar inhibition of rhoBexpression as wild-type RhoB did (data not shown). The same is true if expression vectors coding for either V14RhoA or wild-type RhoA were used (data not shown). The activity of RhoA and RhoB as inhibitors ofrhoB expression is also supported by the finding that blockage of Rho (RhoA, RhoB) activity by overexpression of the Rho inhibitory molecule Rho-GDI resulted in a strong increase in the activity of the rhoB promoter. Rho-GDI was also shown to be a negative regulator of Rac (41Fukumoto Y. Kaibuchi K. Hori Y. Jujioka H. Araki S. Ueda T. Kikuchi T. Takai Y. Oncogene. 1990; 9: 1321-1328Google Scholar). However, its inhibitory effect on Rho proteins (both RhoA and RhoB) obviously becomes predominant under conditions of overexpression, resulting in activation of therhoB promoter. The assumption of a preferential action of Rho-GDI on Rho, at least under conditions of Rho-GDI overexpression, is in agreement with the observation that microinjection of Rho-GDI causes cell rounding which is supposed to be mainly due to inactivation of RhoA (62Miura Y. Kikuchi A. Musha T. Kuroda S. Yaku H. Sasaki T. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 510-515Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, overexpression of Rho-GDI exerted no effect on Rac-mediated activation of JNK (13Coso A.A. Chiariello M. Yu J.-C. Teramoto H. Crespo P. Xu N. Miki T. Gutkind J.S. Cell. 1995; 81: 1137-1146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1559) Google Scholar). Rho proteins are known to participate in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton (7Ridley A.J. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 389-399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3797) Google Scholar, 8Paterson H.F. Self A.J. Garrett M.D. Just I. Aktories K. Hall A. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 11: 1001-1007Crossref Scopus (567) Google Scholar, 10Hall A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 3: 475-479Crossref Scopus (173) Google Scholar) and cooperative action of Rho and Rac on actin cytoskeleton has been described (63Downward J. Nature. 1992; 359: 273-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). On the other hand, opposite effects of Rac/Cdc42 and RhoA have been shown on neurite outgrowth (64Kozma R. Sarner S. Ahmed S. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1201-1211Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar). This finding indicates that RhoA and Rac inversively interfere with signal mechanisms involved in neurite development and collapse, respectively. Thus, it appears likely that Rac has stimulating effects whereas RhoA,B exerts inhibitory activity on the signaling which is involved in the regulation of rhoB expression upon UV irradiation.In summary, having cloned and analyzed the promoter of the mouserhoB gene, we present evidence that the rhoBpromoter is activated by UVC and other forms of genotoxic stress, and that UV activation of rhoB does not require JNK, ERK, and p38 MAP kinase. Therefore, the UV activation of the rhoBgene is different from other immediate-early genes such as c-jun and c-fos. Furthermore, rhoBactivity is stimulated by Rac but not by Cdc42 and is down-modulated by its own product RhoB and the related RhoA protein. This negative regulatory feedback might be functionally important in restoring the steady-state level of RhoB upon exposure of cells to UVC and other genotoxic agents.AcknowledgmentWe thank T.

The N terminus of MDM2 interacts with p53, whereas the properties of the rest of the molecule are poorly understood. We show that MDM2 binds to the general transcription factor TFIID in vivo. The C-terminal Ring finger interacts with TAFII250/CCG1, and the central acidic domain interacts with TBP. Expression of MDM2 activates the cyclin A gene promoter but not c-fos, showing that the effects of MDM2 are specific. Deletion of the C-terminal region of MDM2 abolishes activation, showing that the C-terminal domain of MDM2 is functionally important. We found that increasing MDM2 expression to higher levels inhibits the cyclin A promoter. Inhibition appears to result from titration of general transcription factors because MDM2 overexpression inhibits c-fos as well as other promoters in vivo and basal transcription in vitro. The mechanisms of repression of the cyclin A andfos promoters appear to be different. Cyclin A repression is lost by deleting the C terminus, whereas that of c-fosis lost by removal of the acidic domain. These results reinforce the conclusion that the C terminus of MDM2 mediates effects on the cyclin A promoter. MDM2 transformed cells contain elevated levels of cyclin A mRNA, showing that activation occurs under physiological conditions. There is a positive correlation between MDM2 binding to TAFII250 and MDM2 activation of the cyclin A promoter. The C-terminal region of MDM2, which contains the Ring finger, interacts with TAFII250 and is required for regulation of the cyclin A promoter by MDM2.

The association of E2F1 and p107 with both regulation of the cyclin A promoter and the activities of MDM2 suggests that cyclin A expression could be affected by MDM2.We have found that MDM2 interacts physically with TAFII250/CCG1, a specific transcription accessory factor for the cyclin A promoter (56Wang E.H.

In the case of the human osteocalcin gene, which is transcriptionally repressed by glucocorticoids, a specific binding element for the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) overlaps a noncanonical TATA box. In the present study, the relevance and function of the TATA element in glucocorticoid-mediated repression of the human osteocalcin gene was characterized. Mutating this noncanonical TATA box into a consensus TATA box within the context of the osteocalcin promoter greatly decreased hormone-dependent transcriptional repression by GR. TATA-binding protein (TBP) bound this mutated element much more strongly suggesting a physiologically relevant role for the weak osteocalcin TATA element in the regulation of this bone specific gene. The optimization of the putative transcription factor IIB recognition site did not affect the level of GR-mediated repression. Our results support a model wherein competitive DNA binding of GR and TBP for their overlapping sites explains conditional repression of the osteocalcin gene by glucocorticoids.

Transcription of RNA polymerase II-dependent genes requires, in addition to the enzyme itself, a number of general factors that form a specific multiprotein complex near the transcription start site by interacting with basal promoter elements. The most well studied core promoter element is the TATA box, which is typically located 25–30 base pairs upstream of the transcription start site of many eukaryotic genes (1Breathnach R. Chambon P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1981; 50: 349-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (3298) Google Scholar). The central step in formation of the preinitiation complex at TATA-containing promoters involves the binding of transcription factor IID (TFIID) 1The abbreviations used are: TFIID, transcription factor IID; dexamethasone, 9α-fluoro-16α-methyl-11β,17,21-trihydroxy-pregna-1,4-diene-3,20-dione; GR, glucocorticoid receptor; GRE, glucocorticoid response element; nGRE, negative GRE; NR, nuclear receptor protein; TBP, TATA-binding protein; TFIIB, transcription factor IIB; WT, wild type. to the TATA box (2Burley S.K. Roeder R.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 769-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar). TFIID consists of the TATA-binding protein (TBP) and a fairly large number of associated factors (3Goodrich J.A. Cutler G. Tjian R. Cell. 1996; 84: 825-830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). The affinity of the TBP/TATA box interaction has been proposed to contribute to promoter strengthin vivo and in vitro, and subsequent assembly of the other general transcription factors into a functional preinitiation complex is dependent upon this initial interaction at the TATA box (1Breathnach R. Chambon P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1981; 50: 349-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (3298) Google Scholar,4Colgan J. Manley J.L. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 304-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 5Myers R.M. Tilly K. Maniatis T. Science. 1986; 232: 613-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 6Wobbe C.R. Struhl K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 3859-3867Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). In addition to its role as a nucleation point for preinitiation complex assembly, the TATA box can also have an important function with respect to cell type or stage specific modulation of gene activity. In several reported cases, minor deviations from the consensus TATA box DNA sequence (TATA(A/T)A(A/T)A) are thought to be critical for proper regulation. For example, in the case of the rabbit uteroglobin gene, two factors, one cell type specific and the other ubiquitously expressed, have been proposed to facilitate the interaction of TBP with the weak TATA box, TACAAA, by binding the TACA site (7Klug J. Knapp S. Castro I. Beato M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6208-6218Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Another example is the unusual inverted TTTATA sequence that is involved in the negative regulation of the bone sialoprotein gene (8Li J.J. Kim R.H. Sodek J. Biochem. J. 1995; 310: 33-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Several examples of repression of gene activity by competitive binding at the TATA box have also been postulated. In these cases, the overlap or close location of binding sites for other sequence specific transcription factors and the TATA box suggest that repression of gene expression is the result of a competition between TFIID and a sequence specific factor (9Chatterjee V.K. Lee J.K. Rentoumis A. Jameson J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 9114-9118Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 10Ray A. LaForge K.S. Sehgal P.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 5736-5746Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Thus, when the sequence specific factor is bound, no preinitiation complex can form as TFIID cannot bind. Several cases of competitive binding with other transcription activators have been reported for gene regulation by nuclear hormone receptors (NRs), a family of ligand-dependent transcription factors that includes the receptors for steroid hormones. Upon ligand binding, NRs interact with genomic response elements and directly alter the transcription levels of linked genes. Modulation of gene activity by NRs through steric hindrance of TFIID at the TATA box has been proposed for thyroid hormone-dependent repression of the thyroid-stimulating hormone α-gene and for the bone sialoprotein, which is negatively regulated by vitamin D (9Chatterjee V.K. Lee J.K. Rentoumis A. Jameson J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 9114-9118Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 11Karagianni N. Tsawdaroglou N. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 2327-2334PubMed Google Scholar). In the latter case, a vitamin D receptor element overlaps the TATA box. A further example of gene repression by glucocorticoids involving the promoter region around −30 is reported for the type 1 vasoactive intestinal polypeptide receptor gene (12Pei L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20879-20884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). A DNA binding site recognized by the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) that partly overlaps the TATA box within the promoter region of the human osteocalcin gene has been identified spanning nucleotides −35/−14 relative to the transcription start site (Fig. 1) (13Strömstedt P.E. Poellinger L. Gustafsson J.-Å. Carlstedt-Duke J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3379-3383Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The strategic and central position of the GRE makes it likely that the negative glucocorticoid effect at this gene is mediated by inhibition of formation of a functional preinitiation complex by displacement of TFIID from the TATA box. In the present work we have analyzed the importance of the sequence of osteocalcin TATA box on glucocorticoid-mediated transcription repression of osteocalcin gene activity. We demonstrate that mutating the osteocalcin TATA box into a consensus TATA element greatly diminished repression by hormone-activated GR. The mutation does not influence the specific GR binding suggesting that the osteocalcin TATA box has an active function in the regulatory process. Finally, we present preliminary evidence that suggests that displacement of another polymerase II general transcription factor, TFIIB, is not important for regulation of the osteocalcin gene by mutating promoter positions reported to be responsible for efficient TFIIB function. Mutations were introduced into pOS-344Luc (14Meyer T. Gustafsson J.-Å. Carlstedt-Duke J. DNA Cell Biol. 1997; 16: 919-927Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) within the promoter region of the human osteocalcin gene by standard protocols (15Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (4903) Google Scholar) using the following oligonucleotides: wild type,+9CTCAGCTGGCCAGCCCCGCCAGCCTCCAGCACTGTTTATACCCTCTGGGC−38;TATAAAA,+9CTCAGCTGGCCAGCCCCGCCAGCCTCCAGCACTTTTTATACCCTCTGGGC−38;TACAAAA,+9CTCAGCTGGCCAGCCCCGCCAGCCTCCAGCACTTTTTGTACCCTCTGGGC−38;TACAAAC,+9CTCAGCTGGCCAGCCCCGCCAGCCTCCAGCACTGTTTGTACCCTCTGGGC−38;TFIIB,+9CTCAGCTGGCCAGCCCCGCCAGCCTCCAGCACTGTTTATACCCTCCGGGC−38. An MscI site was introduced by mutating the A at −3 to T to simplify screening. This mutation was shown to have no effect on reporter expression levels (data not shown). COS-7 cells were cultured at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified medium buffered with bicarbonate and supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum, penicillin (100 IU/ml) and streptomycin (0.1 mg/ml). Cells were seeded in 6-cm plates 24 h before a transfection experiment and transfected at a confluence of 40–50% using the calcium phosphate coprecipitation technique. The precipitate contained 5 μg of supercoiled luciferase reporter plasmid DNA and varying amounts (0–3 μg) of different expression plasmids. The overall amount of DNA was kept constant by the addition of parent expression vector. After 12–14 h of exposure to the calcium phosphate precipitate, medium was changed and the cells were treated for 24 h with 20 nmdexamethasone. Transfected cells were subsequently harvested for the luciferase assay by scraping the cells in 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline, centrifuging for 10 min in a microcentrifuge and resuspending in 50 μl of lysis buffer (25 mm Tris-acetate, pH 7.8, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 1.5 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, and 1% Triton X-100). All experiments were performed three times in triplicate. Luciferase activity was monitored according to GenGlow luciferase assay kit (Bio Orbit) using an anthos lucy 1 luminometer (Anthos Labtec Instuments GmbH, Salzburg, Austria). The results are expressed as light units measured. Human glucocorticoid receptor protein was expressed in Sf9 insect cells using a baculovirus expression system as described previously (16Srinivasan G. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 857-860PubMed Google Scholar, 17Kallio P.J. Palvimo J.J. Mehto M. Xie Y.B. Sui Y.P. Janne O.A. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1993; 684: 233-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). The human TBP was produced in a vaccinia virus system (18De Vos P. Schmitt J. Verhoeven G. Stunnenberg H.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 1161-1166Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Cytosolic extracts of infected cells were used in the DNA binding assays. As control extracts (C) we used either extracts of cells infected with WT baculovirus or WT vaccinia virus. GR and TBP DNA binding activity was monitored by an electrophoretic gel mobility shift assay. A32P-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotide spanning the GRE sequence and TATA box of the human osteocalcin promoter (−41/−9) or mutated versions of this DNA were used as specific probes (see Fig.1 C). Recombinant GR was incubated for 10 min on ice in a buffer containing 0.5 μg poly(dI·dC), 60 mm KCl, 10 mm Hepes pH 7.9, 0.1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, and 5 mm dithiothreitol. In reactions containing recombinant TBP, the poly(dI·dC) was replaced by poly(dG·dC). After addition of the specific DNA probe, the mixture was incubated for 20 min at room temperature. Protein-DNA complexes were resolved on 5% native polyacrylamide gels (5% polyacrylamide, 0.25 × TBE). Quantification of specific DNA binding was carried out by densitometric analysis of the autoradiograms for the bands corresponding to the specific complexes. One mechanism by which basal levels of transcription are established is through the binding of TFIID to the TATA box. However, in some cases it appears that the TATA box may also be involved in the regulation of gene expression by an occlusion mechanism analogous to that found in a number of prokaryotic systems. For example, in the case of the human osteocalcin gene, the TATA box overlaps a binding site for a ligand-activated transcriptional regulator, the GR (13Strömstedt P.E. Poellinger L. Gustafsson J.-Å. Carlstedt-Duke J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3379-3383Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Induction of this NR with glucocorticoids leads to a repression of osteocalcin gene activity to 40% of basal levels (19Morrison N.A. Shine J. Fragonas J.C. Verkest V. McMenemy M.L. Eisman J.A. Science. 1989; 246: 1158-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). Since we have defined the function of the glucocorticoid responsive element in previous studies (14Meyer T. Gustafsson J.-Å. Carlstedt-Duke J. DNA Cell Biol. 1997; 16: 919-927Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), we were interested in studying the role of the sequence of the noncanonical osteocalcin TATA box in glucocorticoiddependent repression of osteocalcin levels. Consistent with several other genes regulated by events directly involving the TATA box, the osteocalcin gene contains a noncanonical TATA element (Fig. 1 B) (in this case, TATAAAC, in which the A at position 7 is replaced by a C). Previous reports suggest that TBP binds this sequence poorly and that it directs decreased basal levels of transcription (6Wobbe C.R. Struhl K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 3859-3867Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 20Starr D.B. Hoopes B.C. Hawley D.K. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 250: 434-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 21Singer V.L. Wobbe C.R. Struhl K. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 636-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). To determine if the weakness of the osteocalcin TATA box is important for glucocorticoid-mediated transcription repression, we mutated this element to a canonical TATA box, TATAAAA, and tested the effect of this mutation in cellular transfection experiments using an osteocalcin promoter construct driving the firefly luciferase gene as a reporter system. For these studies, the construct was transfected into COS7 cells where the endogenous GR is expressed at very low levels and is virtually undetectable by ligand binding or immunochemical assays (22Alksnis M. Barkhem T. Strömstedt P.E. Ahola H. Kutoh E. Gustafsson J.-Å. Poellinger L. Nilsson S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10078-10085Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2, mutation of the TATA box to TATAAAA increased basal osteocalcin promoter activity 1.7-fold. In additional experiments, the cotransfected and ligand-activated GR efficiently repressed the WT osteocalcin promoter to a level between 30 and 40% in agreement with previously published results (Fig.3 A). Strikingly, equivalent amounts of GR failed to repress the osteocalcin promoter containing the consensus TATA box upon hormone induction (Fig. 3 B). Thus, the nonconsensus osteocalcin TATA sequence is crucial for proper osteocalcin regulation.Figure 3Glucocorticoid-dependent repression is reduced by a consensus TATA box. COS 7 cells were either transfected with a luciferase reporter gene driven by nucleotides −344/+34 of the human osteocalcin promoter (TATAAAC) (A) or a construct containing a canonical TATA box (TATAAAA) (B) together with an expression vector for GR. The cells were incubated with (▪) or without (□) 20 nmdexamethasone (Dex). Luciferase activity was assayed in cells from 6-cm plates and related to the activity in cells transfected with GR in the absence of dexamethasone. The figure shows the mean + S.D. of three experiments, each carried out with three independent triplicate analyses.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Although the mutated residue of the TATA box should not compromise GR binding as it is located in the 3-base pair spacer region, we performedin vitro binding studies using either a WT or the TATAAAA mutated form of a DNA fragment containing the human osteocalcin promoter-spanning nucleotides −41/−9 (Fig. 1 C). In gel mobility shift assays using virally expressed GR, we showed that the receptor protein binds both fragments similarly (Fig.4 A, lanes 3 and4). Mutation of the nGRE sequence (Fig. 1 C; GREmut) eliminates the GR-specific complex, whereas nonspecific complexes were not affected (Fig. 4, A, lane 6,B, lane 5). Furthermore, this band was supershifted to a slower migrating species following incubation with antibodies against GR (data not shown). A mutation within the first putative GRE halfsite (TACAAAA), creating a binding site described for optimal GR function, enhanced GR-DNA interaction (compare Fig.4 B, lanes 3 and 4). Since we are proposing that a prerequisite for effective repression of the osteocalcin gene by glucocorticoids is a noncanonical TATA element that influences the TBP/TATA box interaction, we directly determined if TBP could distinguish between the WT and the A mutant by using virally expressed TBP in gel mobility shift assays. As shown in Fig.5, TBP induced a specific protein-DNA complex on a DNA fragment containing the WT osteocalcin promoter fragment −41/−9. However, under the same experimental conditions, TBP bound a fragment containing a consensus TATA box within the context of the osteocalcin promoter with apparently higher affinity (Fig. 5,lane 3). The specificity of this interaction was established by using a similar element containing a G in the second position of the TATA element (TGTAAAC; Fig. 5, lanes 4 and 8). This mutation completely abolished the TBP-DNA interaction as described previously (23Strubin M. Struhl K. Cell. 1992; 68: 721-730Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The use of a synthetic DNA fragment containing an alternative mutation within the strong consensus TATA box element (TACAAAA) resulted in a TBP-induced complex formation comparable in intensity to the weak WT osteocalcin TATA box (Fig. 5, lanes 6 and 7). When we used our osteocalcin reporter construct containing TGTAAAC, TACAAAC, or TACAAAA as TATA element, the reporter gene activity was decreased to background levels (data not shown). This result suggests that the binding affinity of TBP to the osteocalcin TATA box is one of the major determinants for GR action at the osteocalcin promoter. The basis of our model for the glucocorticoid-dependent down-regulation of the osteocalcin gene is competitive binding between the basal transcription factor TFIID and a conditionally active transcription regulator, the glucocorticoid receptor, for overlapping binding sites. In this model, the relative affinity of each factor for its respective binding site is crucial for the proper regulation of the osteocalcin gene with neither factor binding too strongly. To more accurately assess the relative binding strengths of TBP and GR for the osteocalcin GRE/TATA box, we compared the binding affinities of TBP and GR to the osteocalcin GRE/TATA box to their respective consensus binding sites contained within the osteocalcin promoter background. In agreement with our proposed model, both TBP and GR bound the osteocalcin GRE/TATA box more weakly than they bound their consensus binding sites. As shown in Fig. 6, TBP binds the osteocalcin TATA box 5-fold less strongly than to the consensus TATA box, TATAAAA, over a wide range of protein concentrations (Fig. 6 A), and GR binds the osteocalcin GRE 5-fold less strongly than to the consensus GRE, GGTACA, over a wide range of protein concentrations (Fig. 6 B). If mutually exclusive binding of the two transcription factors is a prerequisite for the glucocorticoid-mediated transcription repression effect, then an increase in GR concentration should be sufficient to perturb the enhanced binding of TFIID to the consensus TATA box within the osteocalcin gene. We therefore tested whether increased amounts of GR expression vector would be capable of repressing the mutated osteocalcin reporter construct that contains the consensus TATA box in the above described cellular transfection system. The use of an excess of GR expression vector resulted in a concentration-dependent decrease of osteocalcin reporter gene activity comparable to the level of repression at the WT osteocalcin promoter construct. The use of 5–10-fold more expression vector resulted in a similar decrease in reporter gene activity (Fig.7). These results are indicative of equilibrium binding of GR and its competitive factor TFIID in the proposed mechanism and, furthermore, that the reduced affinity of TFIID for its DNA recognition site is critical for negative gene regulation of the human osteocalcin gene by glucocorticoids. During the formation of the preinitiation complex, several other basal factors stabilize the TFIID-DNA complex. Among them, TFIIB is essential for the formation of the polymerase II initiation complex as it interacts with the TBP-DNA complex and recruits the polymerase. TFIIB requires at least 7 base pairs of DNA on either side of the TATA box to form a stable TFIIB-TBP-DNA complex (24Lee S. Hahn S. Nature. 1995; 376: 609-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 25Nikolov D.B. Chen H. Halay E.D. Usheva A.A. Hisatake K. Lee D.K. Roeder R.G. Burley S.K.

A. 1996; 93: 10620-10625Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Lagrange et al. 2T. Lagrange, A. Kapanidis, H. Tang, D. Reinberg, and R. H. Ebright, personal communication. have presented evidence for the importance of two G bases at positions −3 and −6 upstream of the TATA box (positions −36 and −33 in the human osteocalcin gene) (Fig. 8 A). In the case of the osteocalcin promoter, only the proximal G is conserved, which motivated us to study a possible stabilization effect of TFIIB on TFIID binding. We therefore introduced an additional mutation targeting the nonconserved A at position −6 with respect to the TATA box in the osteocalcin promoter fragment driving the luciferase reporter gene (−36 with regard to the human osteocalcin gene). In cellular transfection assays, cotransfection of GR and the mutated osteocalcin reporter construct containing the two described G residues resulted in repression of reporter gene activity upon hormone addition. Comparable to the WT promoter, the reporter gene activity was repressed to a level of 40% (Fig. 8 B). Even if this base change did not directly target the putative GRE, we showed that this mutation did not disturb the GR/DNA interaction using the above described DNA binding assay. As shown in Fig. 4 A, lane 5, no change in GR/DNA binding strength was detected when compared with the WT fragment. This observation strengthened the notion that only TBP binding to the osteocalcin TATA box has a central and dominant function in glucocorticoid mediated repression of osteocalcin expression level. The affinity of sequence specific transcription factors for their binding sites is a major determinant for their action. Consensus binding sites have been defined for most of the known DNA binding transcription factors with these sites yielding maximal effects on gene transcription. Additionally, many cases have been described where nonconsensus binding sites are important for the transmission of a specific regulatory effect. This is also true for the basal transcriptional element, the TATA box, where several sites have been described in which proper regulation requires sequences divergent from that of a consensus TATA box, TATAAAA (23Strubin M. Struhl K. Cell. 1992; 68: 721-730Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). For example, the rabbit uteroglobin gene depends upon a noncanonical TATA box for transmission of cell specific effects (7Klug J. Knapp S. Castro I. Beato M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6208-6218Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) and in the bone sialoprotein promoter, a noncanonical TATA box, TTTATA, may be involved in vitamin D-dependent gene repression (8Li J.J. Kim R.H. Sodek J. Biochem. J. 1995; 310: 33-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Thus, at times a nonconsensus DNA sequence may be a prerequisite for proper gene regulation. Competitive binding of transcription factors to a common binding site has been proposed in many cases as a functional regulatory mechanism for gene transcription. Signal transduction by steroid hormones through NRs provides several well documented examples of this mode of gene regulation. For example, in the case of the c-fos gene, the GR competes for binding with the serum response factor for a common binding site, and in the case of the bovine prolactin gene, competition takes place between GR and a cell specific positive acting DNA binding factor (11Karagianni N. Tsawdaroglou N. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 2327-2334PubMed Google Scholar, 27Cairns C. Cairns W. Okret S. DNA Cell Biol. 1993; 12: 695-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Both of these examples are quite complex in that the fundamental mechanism of repression in which displacement of an activator with another activator (GR) results in repression remains unknown. However, in the example studied here, the mechanism by which GR binding represses transcription is much simpler to understand in that GR binding displaces the basal factor TFIID from the TATA box, thus disrupting the preinitiation complex that is required for transcription to occur. For competitive binding to be an effective mode of transcriptional regulation, the two factors must be able to displace one another. Thus, in theory, neither factor should bind its site too tightly (although regulatory schemes involving ligand-dependent transcriptional regulators, such as NRs, should be able to bypass this requirement for that particular factor). This is particularly true with schemes that involve TFIID as one of the members as it binds a consensus TATA box with an off-rate in excess of 2 h making displacement more difficult (28Hoopes B.C. LeBlanc J.F. Hawley D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11539-11547Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with this hypothesis, we show here that in the case of the human osteocalcin gene, a weaker nonconsensus TATA box is absolutely essential for glucocorticoid-mediated repression. We found that by altering the WT human osteocalcin TATA box, TATAAAC, to a consensus TATA box sequence, TATAAAA, the negative transcriptional effect of glucocorticoids on the osteocalcin transcription rate was decreased without affecting GR binding. Additionally, as predicted from previously published work (6Wobbe C.R. Struhl K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 3859-3867Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 20Starr D.B. Hoopes B.C. Hawley D.K. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 250: 434-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), we show that the TBP binds the consensus TATA box much more strongly than the WT osteocalcin TATA box and that the WT nonconsensus TATA box supports lower levels of transcription. Thus, when taken together, these results are consistent with glucocorticoid-mediated repression occurring via a competitive binding mechanism between TFIID and GR at the human osteocalcin promoter. The findings we obtained with the different TATA box variants may represent two different prerequisites for gene regulation by an occlusion mechanism, the affinity of a transcription factor for its binding site and the availability of a site because of particular DNA architecture. Failure to repress at the WT TATAAAA sequence may occur because of one or both of these criteria. For example, GR may simply have more difficulty displacing TFIID from TATAAAA as TFIID binds this site too tightly. Alternatively, GR may have difficulty displacing TFIID from TATAAAA because the architecture of the DNA in these two TBP-TATA box complexes is predicted to be different. Several reports have suggested that TBP binding to the TATA box element induces a bend within the target site and that the degree and magnitude of this bend is directly correlated to the strength of TBP binding (29Kim Y. Geiger J.H. Hahn S. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1993; 365: 512-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (1016) Google Scholar, 30Kim J.L. Nikolov D.B. Burley S.K. Nature. 1993; 365: 520-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (972) Google Scholar, 31Horikoshi M. Bertuccioli C. Takada R. Wang J. Yamamoto T. Roeder R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1060-1064Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The bend angle for a consensus TATA box has been described to be 93 °C as compared with a TATAAAC element which bends the DNA 34 °C (20Starr D.B. Hoopes B.C. Hawley D.K. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 250: 434-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The moderate distortion of the target DNA element observed with TATAAAC may increase the chance for a competitive factor to bind to an overlapping binding site. At this time there is no way to distinguish between these two models as no TATA box mutation has been reported that separates binding affinity from architecture. In fact, it may be that GR-mediated displacement of TFIID is hampered by both steric hinderance of the structure of the DNA as well as the off-rate of TFIID. The observation that an optimized TFIIB recognition site2obtained from studies with promoters containing a standard strong TATA element did not affect GR-mediated repression of the osteocalcin gene, supports our notion that TFIID binding has a central role in our defined model system. We conclude that the reduced binding affinity and/or DNA bend angle of the TFIID-TATA box complex at the osteocalcin promoter is a major precondition for GR-mediated repression at that promoter. This supports a model involving competitive DNA binding of GR and TFIID as an explanation for conditional repression of the osteocalcin gene by glucocorticoids."

Antibody molecules bind antigens with high affinity and specificity by synergistically using multiple noncovalent forces. The combining site (paratope), whose shape is complementary to the epitope on the antigen, is made up of the hypervariable regions, also called complementarity determining regions (CDRs) 1The abbreviations used are: CDR, complementarity determining region; VH, variable region of the heavy chain; VL, variable region of the light chain; Fmoc,N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography.

It is commonly accepted that there are three CDRs in the light chain (L1, L2, and L3) and in the heavy chain (H1, H2, and H3). These CDRs fold into turn structures that are stabilized by the β-sheet framework of the variable domains. The interface between antibodies and antigens has been precisely described by x-ray crystallographic studies, and several complexes between Fab fragments of monoclonal antibodies and peptide or protein antigens have been recently described (for reviews see Refs.2Davies D.

The structures of antibody-antigen complexes indicate that at least four of the CDRs, and in some cases all six CDRs, contribute to antigen binding (5Wilson I. Stanfield R. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1993; 3: 113-118Crossref Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Residues in the framework have rarely been reported to participate in this interaction (6Sheriff S. Silverton E. Padlan E. Cohen G.

Antibody-peptide or antibody-protein complexes are excellent model systems to study the physicochemical requirements for molecular recognition. Unfortunately, it is a difficult task to obtain crystals suitable for the structural elucidation of antibody fragments in complex with proteins or peptides. Therefore, other approaches to obtain information about the key residues involved in the interaction would be very useful, in particular for paratope mutagenesis.

However, the capacity of synthetic peptides derived from the variable regions of a given antibody to bind an antigen has never been probed in a systematic manner, i.e. in assessing the antigen binding capacity of every overlapping peptide from the VH and VL sequences. In this study, we present the results obtained by measuring the ability of an antigen to bind to sets of immobilized overlapping peptides of uniform size covering the amino acid sequences of the VHand VL domains of three different antibodies. The peptides were prepared by the Spot method (16Frank R. Tetrahedron. 1992; 48: 9217-9232Crossref Scopus (925) Google Scholar), which has previously been successfully used to identify peptide epitopes recognized by anti-protein antibodies and further developed to map protein-protein interaction sites (17Reineke U. Sabat R. Kramer A. Stigler R.D. Seifert M. Michel T. Volk H.D. Schneider-Mergener J. Mol. Diversity. 1996; 1: 141-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Our results indicate that numerous peptides show antigen binding capacity, most of them exhibiting measurable affinities in BIAcore, and that paratope residues important for antigen recognition can be identified by peptide analysis. Hen egg white lysozyme was from Sigma, and human thyroglobulin was from UCB-Pharma (Nanterre, France). Synthetic angiotensin II and an N-terminally biotinylated derivative were prepared as described below. 2 mg of the antigen in 2 ml of bicarbonate buffer (pH 8.6) were biotinylated by using a commercial reagent (Amersham RPN2202) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Biotinylated antigens were incubated with 0.1 m glycine (1 h, 37 °C) and then stored in phosphate-buffered saline at −20 °C. The numbering of the amino acid sequences of the variable regions was that of Wu and Kabat (1Wu T. Kabat E. J. Exp. Med. 1970; 132: 211-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (935) Google Scholar). The amino acid sequence of the anti-angiotensin II antibody 4D8 was established by sequencing the cDNAs corresponding to the heavy and light chains after reverse transcription of the mRNA from the 4D8 hybridoma (18Simon D. Romestand B. Huang H. Badouaille G. Fehrentz J.A. Pau B. Marchand J. Corvol P. Clin. Chem. 1992; 38: 1963-1967Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The amino acid sequences of the anti-lysozyme antibody HyHEL-5 and the anti-human thyroglobulin Tg10 antibody were taken from the literature (19Padlan E. Mol. Immunol. 1994; 31: 169-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (790) Google Scholar, 20Noel D. Bernardi T. Navarro-Teulon I. Marin M. Martinetto J.-P. Ducancel F. Mani J.C. Pau B. Piechaczyk M. Biard-Piechaczyk M. J. Immunol. Methods. 1996; 193: 177-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The general protocol has been described previously (21Molina F. Laune D. Gougat C. Pau B. Granier C. Peptide Res. 1996; 9: 151-155PubMed Google Scholar). Membranes were obtained from Abimed (Langenfeld, Germany). Fmoc amino acids andN-hydroxybenzotriazole were from Novabiochem. An ASP222 robot (Abimed) was used for the coupling steps. All peptides were acetylated at their N terminus. After the peptide sequences had been assembled, the side-chain protecting groups were removed by trifluoroacetic acid treatment (16Frank R. Tetrahedron. 1992; 48: 9217-9232Crossref Scopus (925) Google Scholar). The general protocol was the same as for epitope analysis (16Frank R. Tetrahedron. 1992; 48: 9217-9232Crossref Scopus (925) Google Scholar) except for the use of a biotinylated antigen (90-min incubation at 37 °C). After washing the membrane, a 1:3000 dilution of an alkaline phosphatase-streptavidin conjugate (Sigma) was incubated for 30 min at room temperature. Binding was revealed by addition of a phosphatase substrate (5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate-3-(4,5-dimethyl thiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide, Sigma), giving a blue precipitate on those spots having bound the alkaline phosphatase-streptavidin conjugate. A plot of spot intensities was obtained with the NIH Image software after scanning the membrane as described (21Molina F. Laune D. Gougat C. Pau B. Granier C. Peptide Res. 1996; 9: 151-155PubMed Google Scholar). Color intensities were calculated with reference to a black spot taken as the maximum of a 0–255 scale (arbitrary units). To allow the reuse of the membrane, it was sequentially treated by dimethylformamide, 6 m urea, and 10% acetic acid in ethanol so as to remove the precipitated dye and molecules bound to peptides. The reactivity of each antigen was assessed in two or three independent experiments. All soluble peptides were synthesized on an Abimed AMS 422 synthesizer by Fmoc chemistry. Except for angiotensin II, a spacer sequence (YKK) was added at the N terminus of every peptide followed by a biotin residue. Peptides were deprotected and released from the resin by trifluoroacetic acid treatment in the presence of appropriate scavengers. Peptides were lyophilized, and their purity was assessed by HPLC. When necessary, peptides were purified to greater than 90% HPLC homogeneity. The BIAcore apparatus was from BIAcore (Uppsala, Sweden). All experiments were carried out at 25 °C. N-terminally biotinylated peptides (5 μg/ml in Hepes-buffered saline buffer) were immobilized on a streptavidin-coated sensor chip. The injection was performed at a flow rate of 5 μl/min. The net surface plasmon resonance signal for immobilized peptides was found to be about 25–30 resonance units after completion of the chip regeneration cycle, which corresponds to 25–30 pg/mm2 (12–15 fmol/mm2). The binding kinetics of lysozyme to immobilized peptides was determined by injecting lysozyme (2–4 μm) in Hepes-buffered saline buffer (running buffer) at a flow rate of 10 μl/min. Dissociation was observed in running buffer without dissociating agents at a flow rate of 10 μl/min. The kinetic parameters of the binding reactions were determined using BIAevaluation 2.1 software (22Karlsson R. Roos H. Fägerstam L. Persson B. Methods (Orlando). 1994; 6: 99-110Crossref Scopus (284) Google Scholar). The dissociation rate (off-rate) constant k d was determined from a plot of ln(R 0/R) versus time,R being the surface plasmon resonance signal at timet; the association rate constant (on-rate)k a was determined from a plot of ln[abs(dR/dt)] versus time. The apparent equilibrium dissociation constant was calculated from the kinetic constants: K D =k d /k a . The coordinates of the HyHEL-5-lysozyme complex (3hfl; Ref. 23Cohen G.H. Sheriff S. Davies D.R. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. D. 1996; 52: 315-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) were used with the Insight II software to identify CDR residues in contact (i.e. less than 3.4 Å apart) with amino acids from the framework that were found to be important by Spot peptide analysis. The capacity of short peptides derived from the variable regions of three different antibodies to bind the cognate antigen was investigated in a systematic manner. The VH and VL amino acid sequences were presented as sets of 110 overlapping dodecapeptides (2-residue frameshift) synthesized according to the Spot method (16Frank R. Tetrahedron. 1992; 48: 9217-9232Crossref Scopus (925) Google Scholar, 21Molina F. Laune D. Gougat C. Pau B. Granier C. Peptide Res. 1996; 9: 151-155PubMed Google Scholar). In this method, the peptides remain attached to the cellulose membrane used for their synthesis, and their immunoreactivity is probed by incubating the membrane with a solution containing the ligand. As an example, Fig.1 shows the results obtained with peptides derived from the variable regions of HyHEL-5, an anti-lysozyme antibody (6Sheriff S. Silverton E. Padlan E. Cohen G. Smith-Gill S. Finzel B. Davies D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 8075-8079Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar). Biotinylated lysozyme (1 μg/ml; 6 × 10−8m) bound to several peptides derived from the VH and VL sequences of HyHEL-5 (Fig.1 A). A detailed analysis of this interaction is provided under “Relationships between the Sequence of Antigen-binding Peptides and CDR Location in the HyHel-5 Model.” The binding pattern was not affected by incubating the biotinylated lysozyme in a 50-fold dilution of normal human serum, i.e. in the presence of a high concentration of proteins unrelated to lysozyme (Fig. 1 B). However, when lysozyme (100 μg/ml) was added to the incubation mixture, binding no longer occurred (Fig. 1 C). No binding was observed with the alkaline phosphatase-streptavidin complex (Fig.1 D) except on two control peptides that have the HPQ sequence recognized by streptavidin (24Devlin J. Panganiban L. Devlin P. Science. 1990; 249: 404-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (822) Google Scholar). The binding of lysozyme to immobilized peptides is therefore specific. In the second model studied, biotinylated thyroglobulin (1 μg/ml; 3 × 10−9m) was also found to bind several peptides from the VH and VL domains of the anti-thyroglobulin antibody Tg10 (25Piechaczyk M. Chardes T. Cot M.C. Pau B. Bastide J.M. Hybridoma. 1985; 4: 361-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The reactivity was observed in six regions of the membrane that broadly corresponded to peptides containing CDR residues (data not shown). The reactivity was abolished in the presence of an excess of thyroglobulin. In another set of experiments, the VH and VLdomains of the high affinity anti-angiotensin II antibody 4D8 (K D = 1.3 × 1011m; 18) were scanned by overlapping dodecapeptides. Biotinylated angiotensin II (1 μg/ml; 1 × 10−6m) bound to peptides corresponding broadly to the three CDRs of VL and to H1, whereas peptides corresponding to H2 and H3 showed less intense reactivity (not shown). When biotinylated angiotensin II (1 μg/ml) was incubated with 1 mg/ml angiotensin II, the signal markedly decreased. No cross-reactivity was observed with any of the three antigens on peptides derived from unrelated antibodies. All of these results showed that 12-mer peptides derived from the amino acid sequence of the VH and VLdomains of three different antibodies are capable of being specifically recognized by their cognate antigen. TableI shows the results of the quantitative analysis of the binding of biotinylated lysozyme to cellulose-bound peptides derived from the amino acid sequence of HyHEL-5. The majority of peptides containing only framework residues displayed no binding activity (peptides 3–8, 20–21, 34–39, 51–58, 84, and 86–87). However, several peptides (31–33, 40, 59, 68–69, 85, 88–90, and 92–93) that also contained only framework residues were reactive. The possible molecular basis for this reactivity is discussed under “Precise Identification of Residues Contributing to Antigen Binding and Camparison with Contact Residues Defined by X-ray Crystallography”. Analysis of the relationships between the amino acid sequence and the binding properties (Table I) indicated that strong binding capacity was detectable when certain CDR residues were present in the peptide sequence. For example, the sequence VTMTCSASSSVN from L1 (peptide 12) had no activity, but the following (overlapping) sequence MTCSASSSVNYM (peptide 13) possessed activity; therefore, the motif YM clearly contributed to binding. Other residues from CDRs were thus identified as contributors: DT from L2 at peptide 22, SD from H1 at peptide 60, and YH from H2 at peptide 75. Some residues not belonging to CDRs also apparently contributed to binding activity: GS at peptide 29, YY at peptide 40, TF at peptide 59, KQ at peptide 64, GL at peptide 67, LT at peptide 88, and YY at peptide 92. Also, a decrease in the binding capacity of certain peptides occurred when residues from the CDRs disappeared from the peptide sequence, e.g. the difference in the activities of peptides 19 and 20 could be attributed to the absence of YW in peptide 20. The following CDR residues were thus identified: QW from L3 (difference in binding to peptide 47versus 48), SD from H1 (peptide 65 versus 66), GS from H2 (peptide 77 versus 78), and DF from H3 (peptide 101versus 102). When certain residues not belonging to the CDR were removed from the amino acid sequence of a binding peptide, the antigen binding capacity was reduced: absence of RW in the sequence of peptide 26, of FS in peptide 34, of AS in peptide 63, of EW in peptide 74, and of YM in peptide 91. Therefore, it seems that the binding of antigen to cellulose-bound peptides is based on the presence in their sequence of certain residues from the CDRs and in several instances of certain framework residues neighboring the CDRs.Table ISequences of the dodecapeptides derived from the VH and VL of antibody HyHel-5 and their reactivity with biotinylated lysozymeView Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Framework residues are colored in black, and CDR residues are in red.

Shaded areas correspond to peptides showing significant binding. Alanine scanning of hexapeptides derived from each previously identified binding sequence from the VH and VL domains of HyHEL-5 was performed to identify the exact residues contributing to antigen binding. The study of the CDR L1 region is given as a detailed example (Fig.2; see legend of Fig. 3 for the amino acid numbering of the VH and VL sequences). Three hexapeptides (SSVNYM, SVNYMY, and VNYMYW) and each of their six alanine analogs were synthesized by the Spot method and tested for reactivity with biotinylated lysozyme. Replacing Ser27 of peptide SSVNYM by an alanine residue led to a fall in the antigen binding capacity, whereas alanine replacement of Tyr32 led to disparition of the binding. Changing any of the other amino acids of the peptide SSVNYM did not modify the binding (Fig. 2 A). For peptide SVNYMY, the three amino acids Asn31, Tyr32, and Tyr34 appeared to be important (Fig.2 B). Alanine scanning of peptide VNYMYW indicated that only Asn31 is important (Fig. 2 C). In preliminary experiments, we noted that the contribution of a given amino acid to binding was not always the same when the surrounding sequence varied, probably reflecting conformational effects. Indeed, Tyr32appeared to be a contributor in peptides SSVNYM and SVNYMY but not a contributor in peptide VNYMYW; also, the influence of Asn31was apparently more critical in sequence VNYMYW than in other sequences. In fact, several hexapeptides had to be analyzed to define the residues contributing to the binding.Figure 3Comparison of residues found to contribute to the binding of lysozyme to peptides with residues involved in the paratope-epitope interface in the HyHEL-5 lysozyme complex (23Cohen G.H.

Using the same alanine-scanning approach, contributors were determined for each CDR region. For the L2 region, the motif was identified as 46RWIYD50 (Fig. 3); one residue (Asp50) belonged to the CDR, and four residues were from the framework sequence preceding L2. For the L3 region, the contributing motif was 91WGR-P-F98 (Fig. 3). Residues Trp, Gly, Arg, and Pro were part of the CDR, Phe98being in the framework. For the H1 region, the contributing motif27Y-FSDYW-EW36 comprised four residues (DYW-E) from the CDR and four residues from the framework. For the H2 region, the motif comprised a framework residue, Trp47, and six residues in the middle of the CDR (54S-S-NYHE61). For the H3 region, the motif91YC–HGNYDF-W103 had five amino acids from the CDR (GNYDF) and four residues from the framework (YC–H and Trp, respectively on the N- and C-terminal sides of the CDR). The determination of critical residues for binding the antigen provided a possible explanation for the reactivity of certain framework sequences; for example, peptides 29–34 (Table I) contain an SGS sequence that is part of the CDR H2; peptides 68 and 69, could be reactive because of the presence of the LEW sequence very similar to the IEW motif of H1. The reactivity of peptide 88 could be due to a strong sequence similarity with peptides 16–18 from the L1 region (SSTAYM as compared with SSVNYM). Thus, a cross-reactivity phenomenon may explain some of the reactivities in framework peptides; however, no similar explanation for the reactivity of peptides 40, 59, 89–90, and 92–93 was found. The residues identified here as important for the binding of lysozyme to peptides derived from the sequence of the VH and VL domains of HyHEL-5 were then compared with the residues involved in antigen binding in the crystal structure of HyHEL-5 Fab-lysozyme (6Sheriff S. Silverton E. Padlan E. Cohen G. Smith-Gill S. Finzel B. Davies D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 8075-8079Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar, 23Cohen G.H. Sheriff S. Davies D.R. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. D. 1996; 52: 315-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3). For the L1 region, three amino acids (NY-Y) identified by peptide analysis are implicated in the crystallographic antigen-antibody interaction; Ser27 was found to be a contributor in our analysis only. For the L2 region, only one CDR amino acid (Asp50) was implicated by crystallography in the antigen-antibody complex. Alanine scanning of reactive peptides from this region pointed out the role of both Asp50 and of the stretch of four residues preceding it. For the L3 region, the 91WGR-P96 residues of the antigen-antibody complex were identified by peptide analysis with, however, the implication of an additional residue (Phe98). For the H1 region, four CDR residues (DYW-E) and one framework residue (Ser30) were found by crystallography to be implicated in antigen recognition; by alanine scanning of hexapeptides, the same five amino acids, 30SDYW-E35, were found to be contributors. However, three other amino acids (Y-F——W) outside the CDR seemed to be implicated in the interaction of the peptide with the antigen. For the H2 region, which is a 17-residue long CDR, seven amino acids from the CDR and one in the framework play a role in the antigen-antibody interaction as determined by x-ray crystallography. By using the Spot method, the importance of three amino acids of the CDR (Ser54, Ser56, and Asn58) and of the Trp47 residue of the framework was determined. Whereas the crystallographic results implicate the N-terminal part and the middle of the CDR, the C-terminal part of the CDR (motif YHE) seemed to play an important role when peptides were used. For the H3 region, the motif GNYD found by crystallography is similar to the motif found by the alanine scanning of hexapeptides. However, five amino acids, which were defined by spot peptide analysis as contributors, were not implicated in the HyHEL-5-lysozyme interaction as defined in the crystal structure. Of these five contributors, four of them belonged to the framework (91YC–H95, N-terminal to the CDR, and Trp103, C-terminal to the CDR). The comparison between residues (totaling 38) important for lysozyme binding to VH- and VL-derived peptides and residues involved in HyHEL-5-lysozyme interaction permitted us to identify 14 of the 18 residues in direct crystallographic contact with the antigen (78%) and 22 of the 32 (69%) residues that are either in contact or partially buried at the antigen-antibody interface (23Cohen G.H. Sheriff S. Davies D.R. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. D. 1996; 52: 315-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3). Sixteen residues that were found to be important in the binding of biotinylated lysozyme to peptides did not correspond to amino acids at the antigen-antibody interface. The majority of them (12 of 16) were framework residues. Table IIshows that all five contributors from the VL framework and six of nine important residues from the VH framework belong to the subset of framework residues from the “Vernier” zone,i.e. defined as residues that may adjust CDR structure and fine tune the fitting to antigen (26Foote J. Winter G. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 224: 487-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). By using the atomic coordinates of the HyHel-5-lysozyme complex, it was found that, except for Tyr91H and Cys92H (not in the Vernier zone), all the other framework residues identified as contributors to antigen binding by peptide analysis make contacts in the crystal structure with at least adjacent residues from the CDR (Table II). Therefore, this subset of residues could contribute by giving the peptide an appropriate conformation for antigen recognition.Table IICharacterization of framework residues found to be important for antigen binding by peptide analysisContributing residue from the frameworkBelonging to the Vernier zone2-aRef. 26.Contact residue from the adjacent CDR (CDR)2-bContact as defined under “Experimental Procedures.” The list of contacts is not exhaustive.Arg46LYesAla55L(CDR L2)Trp47LYesLeu54L, Ala55L (CDR L2)Ile48LYesThr51L, Ser52L, Lys53L (CDR L2)Tyr49LYesAsp50L, Lys53L, Leu54L, Ala55L (CDR L2)Phe98LYesThr97L, Gln89L, Pro95L (CDR L3)Tyr27HYesTyr32H (CDR H1)Phe29HYesAsp31H, Try32H(CDR H1)Ser30HYesAsp31H (CDR H1)Trp36HIle34H, Glu35H(CDR H1)Trp47HYesGlu50H, His60H (CDR H2)Try91HCys92HHis94HYesG95H, N96H, F100H, D101H (CDR H3)Trp103HYesD101H, G102H (CDR H3)2-a Ref. 26Foote J.

In the virions, NCp15 is cleaved by the viral protease to form NCp7 and p6 (15Di Marzo Veronese F. Rahman R. Copland T.D. Orozlan S. Gallo R.C. Sarngadharan M.G. AIDS Res. Hum. Retroviruses. 1987; 3: 253-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). NCp7 is a small basic protein of 72 amino acids (see Fig.1 A) characterized by the presence of two spatially close zinc fingers of the CX 2CX 4HX 4C type (16Morellet N. Jullian N. de Rocquigny H.

Biol. 1994; 235: 287-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), NCp7 exhibits nucleic acid binding and annealing activities in vitro and is required for proviral DNA synthesis and virion formation in vivo (reviewed in Ref.18Darlix J.L. Lapadat-Tapolsky M. de Rocquigny H. Roques B.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 254: 523-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). The function of p6 remains unclear, although mutations in the sequence of this protein cause alterations in a late step of viral budding (19Göttlinger H.G. Dorfman T. Sodroski J.E. Haseltine W.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3195-3199Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar). Vpr was recently reported to interact with NCp7 in vitro (20Li M.-S. Garcia-Asua G. Bhattacharyya U. Mascagni P. Austen B.M. Roberts M.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 218: 352-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) in agreement with experiments in which Vpr was co-precipitated with Gag products from infected cells (11Lavallée C. Yao X.J. Ladha A. Göttlinger H.G. Haseltine W.A. Cohen E.A. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 1926-1934Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and with results showing that virus mutants with truncation of the C-terminal domain of Gag were unable to export Vpr from the cell (9Lu Y.-L. Spearman P. Ratner L. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 6542-6550Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Paxton W. Connor R.I. Landau N.R. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 7229-7237Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).

Mammano F. Cohen E.A. Göttlinger H.G. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 2759-2764Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The leucine-rich motif LXSLFG of p6 was suggested to be critical for virion association of Vpr (13Lu Y.-L. Bennett R.B. Wills J.W. Gorelick R. Ratner L. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 6873-6879Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Kondo E. Göttlinger H.G. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 159-164Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, all the chimeric HIV-1 Gag polyproteins leading to Vpr incorporation contained NCp12 from avian leukosis sarcoma virus or NCp10 from MoMuLV in place of the native NCp7, suggesting that the presence of a nucleocapsid protein preceding the p6 sequence could play a role in incorporation of Vpr in virions. This hypothesis is supported by the observed replacement of a NC protein by another nucleocapsid protein in some steps of the retroviral life cycle (21Berkowitz R.D. Ohagen A. Höglund S. Goff S.P. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 6445-6456Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Zhang Y. Barklis E. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 5716-5722Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and by the similarities in the tridimensional structure of NCp7 and NCp10 (16Morellet N. Jullian N. de Rocquigny H. Maigret B. Darlix J.L. Roques B.P. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3059-3065Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar,23Déméné H. Jullian N. Morellet N. de Rocquigny H. Cornille F. Maigret B. Roques B.P. J. Biomol. NMR. 1994; 4: 153-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Moreover, the sequence of Vpr necessary for its incorporation into virions remains to be elucitated because the C-terminal domain was suggested to be involved (10Paxton W. Connor R.I. Landau N.R. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 7229-7237Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas other groups have proposed the involvement of the N-terminal sequence (24Yao X.-J. Subbramanian R.A. Rougeau N. Boisvert F. Bergeron D. Cohen E.A. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 7032-7044Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Mahalingam S. Khan S.A. Murali R. Jabbar M.A. Monken C.E. Collman R.G. Srinivasan A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3794-3798Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). With the aim to characterize more precisely, the interaction of Vpr with the maturation products of NCp15, various in vitrotests were performed using the first chemically synthesized active Vpr.In vitro interactions of this protein with synthetic NCp7, p6, and cellular extracts containing Gag and NCp15 were measured by various methods. In these conditions, Vpr was shown to interact with NCp7 but not with p6. The zinc finger domains of NCp7 and the C-terminal part of Vpr are involved in the complex whose formation is strongly reduced by mutation of the Trp residue on the NCp7 distal zinc finger. NCp10 from MoMuLV, which share common structural features with NCp7 but not with unrelated basic proteins was also found able to recognize Vpr. These results were confirmed and extended by means of site-directed mutagenesis done in the nucleocapsid domain of the molecular clone pNL4.3, suggesting that NCp7 and p6 could cooperate to encapsidate Vpr. Moreover, the NCp7-Vpr complex could play a role in the functions of both proteins during virus replication as recently shown for the activation of the phosphatase protein phosphatase 2A involved in cell division (26Lim T.H.Y. de Rocquigny H.

A biotinyl group was added on the N-terminal residue of peptides when necessary. Amino acids chains were protected byt-butyloxycarbonyl or trityl groups and Nα by a Fmoc. The hydroxymethylphenoxy-methyl-polystyrene resin was used, and amino acids were incorporated using N,N′-dicyclohexyl carbodiimide/hydroxybenzotriazole as a coupling reagent. At the end of the synthesis, the peptidyl resin was treated for 2 h with trifluoroacetic acid in the presence of scavengers to obtain the crude peptide.

https://openalex.org/W2155889476,"Bovine α-lactalbumin (α-LA) has been shown by intrinsic protein fluorescence and electron spin resonance methods to interact with the spin-labeled fatty acid analog, 5-doxylstearic acid, as well as stearic acid. An intrinsic fluorescence titration of various α-LA forms with 5-doxylstearic acid causes first an increase and then a decrease in emission intensity with concomitant shifts in tryptophan emission wavelength. In some cases, up to three steps in the fluorescence titration curves were visible, which were fit to apparent binding steps from 10−6 to 10−4m. The binding parameters of 5-doxylstearic acid for apo- and Ca2+-α-LA were an order of magnitude different from one another; the stronger one, apo-α-lactalbumin, exhibited aK d of 35 μm. Electron spin resonance titrations of 5-doxylstearic acid-loaded apo-α-LA with stearate (micelles) seem to suggest separate binding loci if α-LA indeed binds stearate at these concentrations. The titration of α-LA by stearic acid results in a fluorescence emission red shift and an apparent stepped increase in fluorescence intensity. Lipid-protein association occurred at concentrations at which stearic acid micelles and aggregates begin to form in the absence of protein. Nonetheless, the relatively strong association between stearic acid and apo-α-LA was also confirmed by means of the fluorescent indicator acrylodated fatty acid binding protein, in which addition of α-LA to the stearate-loaded indicator protein reverses the decrease in fluorescence of the acrylodan chromophore conjugated to the protein.

Biochem. 1984; 140: 394-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). However, significant association between α-LA and fatty acid had not been observed with these lipids to date (3Puyol P. Perez M.D. Ena J.M. Calvo M. Agric. Biol. Chem. 1991; 55: 2515-2520Crossref Scopus (1) Google Scholar). This is perplexing because significant quantities of α-LA were found to be associated with milk fat globule membranes, suggesting a possible role for this protein in fat digestion or transport.α-LA and β-lactoglobulin are structurally distinct, as α-LAs possess homologies to c-type lysozymes (14Acharya K.R. Stuart D.I. Walker N.P.C. Lewis M. Phillips D.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 208: 99-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar, 15Acharya K.R. Ren J. Stuart D.I. Phillips D.C. Fenna R.E. J Mol. Biol. 1991; 77: 571-581Crossref Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Another significant difference is that α-LA has a strong Ca2+-binding site, which competitively binds Na+, K+, Mg2+ (16Hiraoka Y.

Protein Chem. 1991; 10: 577-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Changes in the metal-bound state (or pH) of the protein have been shown to modulate both the conformation of α-LA and its interactions with hydrophobic ligands. For example, apo-α-LA binds more effectively to model membranes (9Berliner L.J. Koga K. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 3006-3009Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) and possesses higher affinity for hydrophobic probes than does Ca2+-α-LA (7Permyakov E.A. Grishchenko V.M.

Furthermore, under acidic conditions (molten globule), α-LA associates readily with these lipophiles (23Hanssens I. Houthuys C. Herreman W. van Cauweleart F.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1980; 602: 539-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 24Mulqueen P.M. Kronman M.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1982; 215: 28-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar).We have speculated recently that α-LA may also function as a transport protein for lipophilic substances (25Hirai Y. Permyakov E.A. Berliner L.J. J. Protein Chem. 1992; 11: 51-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) because it is also possible that earlier studies of the low affinity calcium form of the protein (3Puyol P. Perez M.D. Ena J.M. Calvo M. Agric. Biol. Chem. 1991; 55: 2515-2520Crossref Scopus (1) Google Scholar) may have missed strong α-LA-fatty acid association. The present work examines the association of α-lactalbumin with fatty acid spin-labeled analogs by several physical methods.DISCUSSIONThe results clearly show that α-LA binds both stearic acid and its spin-labeled (doxyl) analog. The binding data are summarized in Table I. We have introduced a novel use of the ADIFAB reagent to measure fatty acid binding to proteins by competitive binding. This should prove to be a sensitive method for other systems as well.Table IBinding constants for 5-doxylstearic acid and stearic acid interacting with various α-LA formsK d (n), mapo-α-LACa2+-α-LACa2+,Zn2+-α-LAAcidic α-LA5-DSA (intrinsic fluorescence)25 × 10−6 (∼3–4)50–100 × 10−6 (∼3–4)280 × 10−6(∼3–4)3 × 10−65-DSA (ESR)35 × 10−6 (2)300–500 × 10−6ND≤1 × 10−6 (1)Stearate (intrinsic fluorescence)2.3 × 10−6 (1)0.4 × 10−6, 11–20 × 10−6NDNDADIFAB2.3 × 10−6 (1)NDNDNDApo-α-lactalbumin was obtained by addition of 0.98 mmEGTA.

Buffer was 50 mm bis-tris propane, pH 7.5, at 22 °C. Acidic α-LA was measured at pH 2. Protein concentration was 1.3–1.6 μm. ND, not determined. Open table in a new tab There are at least two binding sites in apo-α-LA, as evidenced by both the ESR and fluorescence titrations shown above. The intrinsic fluorescence emission red shift and general increase resembles studies in which apo-α-LA was transferred from aqueous media and embedded in the surface of liposomes (11Grishchenko V.M. Kalinichenko L.P. Deikus G.Y. Veprintsev D.B. Cawthern K.M. Berliner L.J. Permyakov E.A. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int. 1996; 38: 453-466PubMed Google Scholar, 12Cawthern K.M. Permyakov E.A. Berliner L.J. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 1394-1405Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Although there are several mechanisms to explain the fluorescence changes, one model could even be consistent with identical binding sites for both stearic acid and 5-DSA. Spin labels can cause contact quenching of tryptophan residues when the nitroxide group is bound at or near the indole ring. In the case of stearic acid, the observed emission enhancements by might be due to reduced solvent accessibility. Nonetheless, the ESR experiments with stearate (micelles) seem to suggest separate binding loci if α-LA indeed binds stearate at these concentrations. Certainly, the intrinsic and ADIFAB fluorescence data confirm strong α-LA:stearate complex formation.Certainly, the binding constant of the second phase of the 5-DSA fluorescence titrations for apo-loaded α-LA was in generally good agreement with that of Ca2+-loaded α-LA (i.e., within an order of magnitude). The first phase (i.e., a small fluorescence emission enhancement in every case) was reproducible, but it was difficult to reconcile with the ESR equilibrium studies. This type of behavior has been noted earlier in studies with phospholipase A2 by Jain and co-workers (32Volwerk J.J. Filthruth E. Griffith O.H. Jain M.K. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3464-3474Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In any case, the fluorescence titrations clearly indicate fatty acid binding effects on the protein.Apo-α-LA had a substantially stronger K d , in good agreement with the ESR studies (Fig. 2). The experiments were complicated by the tendency of stearic acid to form dimers and higher aggregates (particularly micelles) at concentrations above 2–6 μm. The ESR results suggest that only two lipid molecules may bind per protein molecule, although α-LA binding to micellar lipid aggregates may be more similar to liposome binding.Blg is frequently a minor contaminant (2–3%) in apo-α-LA preparations, and it is extremely difficult to remove. We recently showed by ESR that 5-DSA binds to Blg in the 0.8 μm range and that both 5-DSA binding and palmitate binding to Blg cause intrinsic fluorescence emission enhancements (33Narayan M. Berliner L.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 190-1911Crossref Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Such minor contaminants would be transparent in the apo-α-LA binding experiments (and, in this study, with the Ca2+-loaded α-LA binding experiments) but would be quite prominent in intrinsic fluorescence titrations in the sub-μm to 1 μm range. Nonetheless, the ADIFAB studies showed conclusively that stearate binds to apo-α-LA with high affinity.Last, the biological relevance of this binding should be considered in nutrition and other transport processes, such as neonatal gastroenterology, where the gut or small intestine may have a lower pH, favoring the molten globule or apo-like forms. Many milk protein components, particularly the whey proteins and caseins, are known to be lipophilic under certain conditions.

Biochem. 1984; 140: 394-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). However, significant association between α-LA and fatty acid had not been observed with these lipids to date (3Puyol P. Perez M.D. Ena J.M. Calvo M. Agric. Biol. Chem. 1991; 55: 2515-2520Crossref Scopus (1) Google Scholar). This is perplexing because significant quantities of α-LA were found to be associated with milk fat globule membranes, suggesting a possible role for this protein in fat digestion or transport. α-LA and β-lactoglobulin are structurally distinct, as α-LAs possess homologies to c-type lysozymes (14Acharya K.R. Stuart D.I. Walker N.P.C. Lewis M. Phillips D.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 208: 99-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar, 15Acharya K.R. Ren J. Stuart D.I. Phillips D.C. Fenna R.E. J Mol. Biol. 1991; 77: 571-581Crossref Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Another significant difference is that α-LA has a strong Ca2+-binding site, which competitively binds Na+, K+, Mg2+ (16Hiraoka Y.

Protein Chem. 1991; 10: 577-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Changes in the metal-bound state (or pH) of the protein have been shown to modulate both the conformation of α-LA and its interactions with hydrophobic ligands. For example, apo-α-LA binds more effectively to model membranes (9Berliner L.J. Koga K. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 3006-3009Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) and possesses higher affinity for hydrophobic probes than does Ca2+-α-LA (7Permyakov E.A. Grishchenko V.M.

Furthermore, under acidic conditions (molten globule), α-LA associates readily with these lipophiles (23Hanssens I. Houthuys C. Herreman W. van Cauweleart F.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1980; 602: 539-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 24Mulqueen P.M. Kronman M.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1982; 215: 28-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). We have speculated recently that α-LA may also function as a transport protein for lipophilic substances (25Hirai Y. Permyakov E.A. Berliner L.J. J. Protein Chem. 1992; 11: 51-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) because it is also possible that earlier studies of the low affinity calcium form of the protein (3Puyol P. Perez M.D. Ena J.M. Calvo M. Agric. Biol. Chem. 1991; 55: 2515-2520Crossref Scopus (1) Google Scholar) may have missed strong α-LA-fatty acid association. The present work examines the association of α-lactalbumin with fatty acid spin-labeled analogs by several physical methods. DISCUSSIONThe results clearly show that α-LA binds both stearic acid and its spin-labeled (doxyl) analog. The binding data are summarized in Table I. We have introduced a novel use of the ADIFAB reagent to measure fatty acid binding to proteins by competitive binding. This should prove to be a sensitive method for other systems as well.Table IBinding constants for 5-doxylstearic acid and stearic acid interacting with various α-LA formsK d (n), mapo-α-LACa2+-α-LACa2+,Zn2+-α-LAAcidic α-LA5-DSA (intrinsic fluorescence)25 × 10−6 (∼3–4)50–100 × 10−6 (∼3–4)280 × 10−6(∼3–4)3 × 10−65-DSA (ESR)35 × 10−6 (2)300–500 × 10−6ND≤1 × 10−6 (1)Stearate (intrinsic fluorescence)2.3 × 10−6 (1)0.4 × 10−6, 11–20 × 10−6NDNDADIFAB2.3 × 10−6 (1)NDNDNDApo-α-lactalbumin was obtained by addition of 0.98 mmEGTA.

Open table in a new tab There are at least two binding sites in apo-α-LA, as evidenced by both the ESR and fluorescence titrations shown above. The intrinsic fluorescence emission red shift and general increase resembles studies in which apo-α-LA was transferred from aqueous media and embedded in the surface of liposomes (11Grishchenko V.M. Kalinichenko L.P. Deikus G.Y. Veprintsev D.B. Cawthern K.M. Berliner L.J. Permyakov E.A. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int. 1996; 38: 453-466PubMed Google Scholar, 12Cawthern K.M. Permyakov E.A. Berliner L.J. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 1394-1405Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Although there are several mechanisms to explain the fluorescence changes, one model could even be consistent with identical binding sites for both stearic acid and 5-DSA. Spin labels can cause contact quenching of tryptophan residues when the nitroxide group is bound at or near the indole ring. In the case of stearic acid, the observed emission enhancements by might be due to reduced solvent accessibility. Nonetheless, the ESR experiments with stearate (micelles) seem to suggest separate binding loci if α-LA indeed binds stearate at these concentrations. Certainly, the intrinsic and ADIFAB fluorescence data confirm strong α-LA:stearate complex formation.Certainly, the binding constant of the second phase of the 5-DSA fluorescence titrations for apo-loaded α-LA was in generally good agreement with that of Ca2+-loaded α-LA (i.e., within an order of magnitude). The first phase (i.e., a small fluorescence emission enhancement in every case) was reproducible, but it was difficult to reconcile with the ESR equilibrium studies. This type of behavior has been noted earlier in studies with phospholipase A2 by Jain and co-workers (32Volwerk J.J. Filthruth E. Griffith O.H. Jain M.K. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3464-3474Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In any case, the fluorescence titrations clearly indicate fatty acid binding effects on the protein.Apo-α-LA had a substantially stronger K d , in good agreement with the ESR studies (Fig. 2). The experiments were complicated by the tendency of stearic acid to form dimers and higher aggregates (particularly micelles) at concentrations above 2–6 μm. The ESR results suggest that only two lipid molecules may bind per protein molecule, although α-LA binding to micellar lipid aggregates may be more similar to liposome binding.Blg is frequently a minor contaminant (2–3%) in apo-α-LA preparations, and it is extremely difficult to remove. We recently showed by ESR that 5-DSA binds to Blg in the 0.8 μm range and that both 5-DSA binding and palmitate binding to Blg cause intrinsic fluorescence emission enhancements (33Narayan M. Berliner L.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 190-1911Crossref Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Such minor contaminants would be transparent in the apo-α-LA binding experiments (and, in this study, with the Ca2+-loaded α-LA binding experiments) but would be quite prominent in intrinsic fluorescence titrations in the sub-μm to 1 μm range. Nonetheless, the ADIFAB studies showed conclusively that stearate binds to apo-α-LA with high affinity.Last, the biological relevance of this binding should be considered in nutrition and other transport processes, such as neonatal gastroenterology, where the gut or small intestine may have a lower pH, favoring the molten globule or apo-like forms.

In addition to deoxyinosine-containing DNA, the enzyme cleaves DNA containing urea residues, AP sites, base mismatches, insertion/deletion mismatches, flaps, and pseudo-Y structures. The gene coding for the enzyme was identified to beorf 225 or nfi(e n donuclease fi ve). Using enzyme purified from an overproducing strain, the deoxyinosine- and mismatch-specific activities of endonuclease V was found to have different divalent metal requirements. The affinity of the enzyme is greater than 20-fold higher for DNA containing deoxyinosine than deoxynebularine or base mismatches. Under optimal cleavage conditions, endonuclease V forms two stable complexes with DNA containing deoxyinosine, but not with DNA containing base mismatches or deoxynebularine, suggesting that the 6-keto group of hypoxanthine in DNA is critical for stable interactions with the protein. The enzyme recognizes deoxyuridine in DNA but exhibits a much lower affinity to DNA containing deoxyuridine compared with DNA containing deoxyinosine. Interestingly, deoxyuridine-specific endonuclease activity of endonuclease V has a divalent metal requirement similar to the mismatch activity.

Interestingly, deoxyuridine-specific endonuclease activity of endonuclease V has a divalent metal requirement similar to the mismatch activity. A model for the mechanism of substrate recognition is proposed to explain these different activities. Recently, we and others (1Guo G. Ding Y. Weiss B. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 310-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 2Yao M. Kow Y.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30672-30676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) have shown that deoxyinosine 3′-endonuclease is identical to endonuclease V, previously characterized as an enzyme with endonuclease activity toward DNA treated with acid, alkali, OsO4, or 7-bromomethyl-benz[a]anthracen (3Gates III, F.T. Linn S. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 1647-1653Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Demple B. Linn S. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 2848-2855Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The gene coding for endonuclease V (nfi, e n donuclease fi ve) was found to be identical to orf 225, located at 90 minutes of the Escherichia coligenome (GenBankTM ascension no. U00006) (5Blattner F.R. Burland V.D. Plunkett III, G. Sofia H.J. Daniels D.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 5408-5417Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). In addition to the less defined substrates, we have shown that homogenous preparations of endonuclease V purified from the wild type E. coli cells recognize several well defined DNA lesions, including deoxyinosine (6Yao M. Hatahet Z. Melamede R.J. Kow Y.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16260-16268Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), urea residues (6Yao M. Hatahet Z. Melamede R.J. Kow Y.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16260-16268Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), AP sites (6Yao M. Hatahet Z. Melamede R.J. Kow Y.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16260-16268Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), base mismatches (7Yao M. Kow Y.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31390-31396Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), loops and hairpins (2Yao M. Kow Y.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30672-30676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), flaps, and pseudo-Y DNA structures (2Yao M. Kow Y.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30672-30676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The ability of endonuclease V to recognize mismatches and abnormal replicative DNA structures suggests that the enzyme might play an important role in DNA metabolism (2Yao M. Kow Y.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30672-30676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Unlike DNA N-glycosylases, endonuclease V cleaves the DNA strand containing lesions at the second phosphodiester bond 3′ to the lesion, leaving a nick with 3′-hydroxyl and 5′-phosphoryl groups. However, the lesion is not removed from the DNA by the enzyme. Endonuclease V forms stable complexes with DNA containing deoxyinosine both before and after cleavage, showing similar affinity to both the substrate and the product (8Yao M. Kow Y.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28609-28616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Based on these results, we have proposed earlier (8Yao M. Kow Y.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28609-28616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) that, besides its endonuclease activity, the enzyme might function to target other repair protein(s) to the lesion. Therefore, it is possible that endonuclease V could initiate a novel repair pathway. Endonuclease V cleaves DNA containing base mismatches in a strand-specific manner; it cleaves the DNA strand containing mismatch closer to the 5′ terminus (7Yao M. Kow Y.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31390-31396Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, the mismatch-specific activity of the enzyme is reduced when the mismatch is flanked by GC pairs; however, its deoxyinosine-specific activity is not influenced by the sequence context. These results suggest that endonuclease V might have different modes of interaction between DNA containing deoxyinosine and mismatches. It is, therefore, important to understand the mechanism governing the recognition of various DNA lesions by this small protein (24,900 Da). To understand the possible mechanism that is involved in the substrate recognition by endonuclease V, we cloned the gene coding for the enzyme (2Yao M. Kow Y.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30672-30676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) so that a large quantity of the protein can be obtained rapidly for further biochemical and physical characterization. All reagents were of analytical grade of purity. Restriction enzymes were purchased from New England Biolabs. General molecular biology procedures used were adapted from the protocols described in Sambrook et al. (9Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Homogeneous endonuclease V was purified from 400 g ofE. coli paste according to the procedures described previously (6Yao M. Hatahet Z. Melamede R.J. Kow Y.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16260-16268Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fraction V, which was judged to be homogeneous by silver staining, was blotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and sent to the University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston for N-terminal amino acid sequencing. The first 24 amino acid residues obtained for the N terminus of endonuclease V were determined to be MDLASLRAQQIELASSVIREDRLD. When sequence homology for this amino acid sequence was searched through the GenBankTM using the Blast program (10Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Meyers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 203: 403-410Crossref Scopus (69694) Google Scholar), the N-terminal amino acid sequence was found to be almost identical to the N-terminal sequence of a hypothetical protein (24.9 kDa) translated from orf 225 (GenBankTM access no. U00006) (5Blattner F.R. Burland V.D. Plunkett III, G. Sofia H.J. Daniels D.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 5408-5417Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). The only difference was that the hypothetical protein had two extra amino acid residues at the N terminus, that is, the translated N-terminal amino acid sequence derived from orf 225 was MIMDLASLRAQQIELASSVIREDRLD. To confirm that orf 225 is the gene coding for endonuclease V, orf 225 was amplified from E. coli genomic DNA by the polymerase chain reaction using flanking primers derived from the genomic DNA sequences obtained from the GenBankTM. The 5′ primers and the 3′ primer contained a NdeI restriction site (underlined) and an AvaI restriction site (underlined), respectively. Since the genomic sequence of orf 225 obtained from the GenBankTM (access no. U00006) (5Blattner F.R. Burland V.D. Plunkett III, G. Sofia H.J. Daniels D.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 5408-5417Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) revealed two potential start codons for orf 225, two different 5′ primers were used: 5′ primer 1, CTGGGAATTCCATATGATTATGGATCTCGCGTCA, 5′ primer 2, CTGGGAATTCCATATGGATCTCGCGTCATTACGC. The sequence for the 3′ primer was CGACGATCCCTCGAGCTGAATTAGGGCTGATTTGC. Polymerase chain reactions were carried out using TaqDNA polymerase (Boehringer Mannhein). The polymerase chain reaction fragment amplified with 5′ primer 1 and the 3′ primer was cloned into the NdeI and the AvaI sites of pET22b(+) vector (Novagen) to generate the plasmid pETI-1. The polymerase chain reaction fragment amplified with 5′ primer 2 and the 3′ primer was cloned into pET22b(+), yielding the plasmid pETI-2. Both the pETI-1 and the pETI-2 plasmids were transformed into E. coli strain BL21(DE3) by electroporation. When BL21(DE3) carrying plasmid pETI-1 or pETI-2 was grown and induced with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, the overexpression of a 25-kDa protein was observed to exhibit activities identical to endonuclease V (data not shown). Based on the above observations, endonuclease V was then purified from an overexpressing host BL21(DE3) carrying pETI-2. The protein produced by the gene cloned in pETI-2 has the same N-terminal sequences as determined for endonuclease V. Four liters of BL21(DE3) carrying pETI-2 were grown in Luria broth containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin to an absorbance at 600 nm of 0.4. Isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was then added to the culture at a final concentration of 1 mm, followed by further incubation at 37 °C for 3 h. Bacteria were harvested by centrifugation and endonuclease V was purified according to earlier published protocol (2Yao M. Kow Y.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30672-30676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 11Savva R. McAuley-Hecht K. Brown T. Pearl L. Nature. 1995; 373: 487-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). The sequences of the oligonucleotides used in this study were as follows: oligo(A), 5′-GGTCGACTAGGAGGATCCCCGGGTAC; oligo I, 5′-GGTCGACTIAGGAGGATCCCCGGGTAC (I = deoxyinosine); oligo N, 5′-GGTCGACTNAGGAGGATCCCCGGGTAC (N = deoxynebularine); oligo G, 5′-GGTCGACTGAGGAGGATCCCCGGGTAC; oligo U, 5′-GGTCGACTUAGGAGGATCCCCGGGTAC (U = deoxyuridine). Oligonucleotides were 5′-end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP (DuPont NEN) using T4 polynucleotide kinase (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). Excessive [γ-32P]ATP was separated by gel filtration through Sephadex G50 (Pharmacia). The labeled oligonucleotides were annealed to oligo B, 5′-CCGGGGATCCTCCTAAGTCGACCTGCA, in a 1:1 ratio in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1 m NaCl by heating to 90 °C and cooling down gradually to room temperature, giving rise to duplexes I/A (X = dI), A/A (X = dA), G/A (X = dG), N/A (X = dN) or U/A (X = dU): 5'-GGTCGACTXAGGAGGATCCCCGGGTAC-3'3'-ACGTCCAGCTGAA_TCCTCCTAGGGGCC-5'Equation 1 Single-stranded SK(−) DNA was recovered and purified as described previously (6Yao M. Hatahet Z. Melamede R.J. Kow Y.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16260-16268Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Plasmid pSK(−) T/A was generated by cloning duplex T/A into PstI andKpnI sites of plasmid SK(−). Duplex T/A was formed by annealing oligonucleotide 5′-GGTCGACTTAGGAGGATCCCCGGGTAC to oligonucleotide 5′-CCGGGGATCCTCCTAAGTCGACCTGCA. Single-stranded DNA of the plasmid pSK (−) T/A was also recovered and purified as described for pSK(−). The standard reaction mixture for assaying deoxyinosine-specific activity (10 μl) contained 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mm MgCl2, 20 fmol of end-labeled oligodeoxynucleotide, and an appropriate amount of enzyme. The reaction mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 10 min and stopped by the addition of 10 μl of loading buffer (90% formamide, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% xylene cyanol, and 0.1% bromphenol blue). Three to five μl of the reaction mixture were loaded onto a 12.5% denaturing polyacrylamide gel (National Diagnostics) and electrophoresed at 2000 V for 1.5 h. The polyacrylamide gel was then dried under vacuum and exposed to x-ray film or analyzed by Fuji Bio-Imaging analyzer. The standard reaction mixture for assaying mismatch-specific activity was the same as that for deoxyinosine-specific activity assay, except 0.34 mm MnCl2 was used instead of 2 mm MgCl2. The standard binding reaction mixture (10 μl) contained 10 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 2 mmMgCl2, 5% glycerol, 20 fmol of 5′-end-labeled oligodeoxynucleotide duplexes, and varying amounts of endonuclease V. The reaction mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 10 min and electrophoresed on a 10% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel. In the binding reactions with duplexes containing base mismatches, MgCl2 was replaced by 0.34 mm MnCl2or 0.1 m NaCl. The polyacrylamide gel (10%) contained acrylamide/N,N′-methylenebisacrylamide at a 19.76/0.24 ratio in TBE buffer (89 mm Tris, 89 mm boric acid, pH 8.3, and 2.5 mm EDTA). The gels were preelectropheresed at 300 V (4 °C) for 30 min, samples were applied, and electrophoresis was continued at 300 V (4 °C) for 150 min. Following electrophoresis, the gels were dried under vacuum and exposed to x-ray film. The radioactive bands in the dried gels were quantified with a Fuji Bio-Imaging analyzer. We have shown previously (6Yao M. Hatahet Z. Melamede R.J. Kow Y.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16260-16268Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that MnCl2 can replace MgCl2 and support the endonuclease activities of endonuclease V. An optimal MnCl2 concentration (0.34 mm) supports about 60–70% of deoxyinosine-specific endonuclease activity of endonuclease V at optimal MgCl2(6Yao M. Hatahet Z. Melamede R.J. Kow Y.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16260-16268Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, the mismatch-specific endonuclease activity of the enzyme is more than 20-fold higher in the presence of Mn2+(0.34 mm) than Mg2+ (2 mm) (data not shown), showing sharp differences in the divalent ion requirements for the deoxyinosine-specific activity and mismatch-specific activity. Endonuclease V was shown to have an optimal pH above 9.0 by earlier investigators using partially purified enzyme preparations (3Gates III, F.T. Linn S. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 1647-1653Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Demple B. Linn S. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 2848-2855Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, highly purified endonuclease V prepared from an overproducingE. coli strain did not agree with these findings. Consistent with our results published earlier (6Yao M. Hatahet Z. Melamede R.J. Kow Y.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16260-16268Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), endonuclease V cleaves deoxyinosine-containing DNA at a pH range from 6.0 to 9.5, with an optimal pH between 7.0 to 7.5. Less than 30% of deoxyinosine-specific activity remained when the pH was higher than 9.0. Similarly, the enzyme has a sharp pH optimum of 8.0 for the mismatch-specific endonuclease activity. Only 50% of mismatch-specific activity remained at either pH 7.5 or 8.5, and less than 10% of the optimal activity when the pH of the reaction was higher than 9.0. We have showed previously (8Yao M. Kow Y.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28609-28616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) that endonuclease V purified from the wild type E. coli strain forms two complexes with DNA containing deoxyinosine with observedK d 1 andK d 2 for complexes I and II of 4 and 400 nm, respectively. In agreement with the earlier results, endonuclease V purified from the overproducing strain formed two stable complexes with oligodeoxynucleotide containing deoxyinosine (Fig.1). TheK d 1 andK d 2 (2 nm and 60 nm, respectively, data not shown) were lower than those observed previously using endonuclease V purified from wild typeE. coli cells (8Yao M. Kow Y.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28609-28616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). This is probably due to a higher amount of active fraction in the enzyme preparation prepared from the overproducing strain. Under optimal cleavage conditions (i.e. in the presence of 2 mm MgCl2, 37 °C) most of the dI-containing oligonucleotides remains bound with endonuclease V as protein-DNA complexes, with less than 10% of total radioactive material migrated as cleaved oligonucleotide (8Yao M. Kow Y.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28609-28616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). In contrast, DNA-protein complexes formed between endonuclease V and mismatch-containing DNA were relatively unstable, either in the presence of Mg2+ or Mn2+. In the presence of Mn2+, the majority of the radioactive material migrated as cleaved oligonucleotides in an EMSA when duplex A/A was used as DNA substrate (Fig. 1). Fig.2 showed the quantitative results of an EMSA for endonuclease V with duplex A/A (with a 5′-end-labeled top strand) in the presence of 0.34 mm MnCl2. It was interesting to note that there were two new electrophoretic migration species observed in the EMSA with duplex A/A as compared with that with duplex I/A (see Fig. 1). One appeared at high enzyme concentrations, migrated slower than the corresponding complex II. This higher complex was probably due to binding of additional protein molecule(s) to complex II and was quantified as complex II in Fig.2 B. Another species migrated slightly faster than did complex I. This might be complex I that assumed a slightly different conformation and was thus quantified as complex I. Fig. 2 Bshows that, under optimal cleavage conditions and at all enzyme concentrations examined, less than 10% of the radioactivity was found to be associated with complex I. When the enzyme concentration was increased to above 6.5 nm, the formation of complex II was observed. Increasing enzyme concentrations led to a higher percentage of complex II (as much as 40% of total radioactivity); however, the amount of complex I remained relatively unchanged. At all enzyme concentrations, the total amount of complexes formed was less than the amount of cleaved oligonucleotide. This is in sharp contrast to the interaction of endonuclease V with deoxyinosine-containing oligonucleotide in which most of oligonucleotides were found to be associated with the enzyme as complex I and complex II (Fig. 1) (8Yao M. Kow Y.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28609-28616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In the absence of a divalent cation and in the presence of 100 mm NaCl, without substrate cleavage, both complexes I and II were formed with an apparent K d of 58 and 62 nm, respectively (data not shown) (Fig.3). Endonuclease V exhibits similar binding pattern with duplexes G/A and N/A, both in the presence and absence of Mn2+ (data not shown).Figure 3Binding of endonuclease V to DNA containing an A/A mismatch under noncleavage conditions. Panel A, duplex A/A with the top strand 5′-end-labeled was incubated with the indicated amount of endonuclease V under standard binding reaction conditions in the presence of 0.1 m NaCl. Binding reactions were analyzed by an electrophoresis mobility shift assay as described under “Materials and Methods.” Panel B, the gel was dried under vacuum and quantified by Fuji Bio-Imaging analyzer. The percentage of the radioactive signal of complex I (•) and complex II (○) was plotted against the total enzyme concentration. The protein concentrations used for the binding reactions ranged from 0.82 to 130 nm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In our earlier studies, we found that endonuclease V could not cleave deoxyuridine-containing oligodeoxynucleotides (6Yao M. Hatahet Z. Melamede R.J. Kow Y.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16260-16268Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since partially purified endonuclease V preparations from earlier investigators were shown to recognize deoxyuridine-containing DNA (1Guo G. Ding Y. Weiss B. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 310-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar,3Gates III, F.T. Linn S. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 1647-1653Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Demple B. Linn S. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 2848-2855Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we decided to reexamine whether a highly purified endonuclease V preparation could recognize DNA containing deoxyuridine in various sequence contexts. Oligonucleotides U24 and U21 were annealed to single-stranded SK(−) DNA to form the following duplexes which are identical to duplexes F and H used in earlier studies (6Yao M. Hatahet Z. Melamede R.J. Kow Y.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16260-16268Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar): 5'-GGCGGCCGCTCTU_GAACTAGTGGA-3'3'-TACCGCCGGCGAT_CTTGATCACCTAGG-Sk(-)Duplex FEquation 2 5'-CCCCCGGGCTU_CAGGAATTCG-3'3'-TAGGGGGCCCGAC_GTCCTTAAGCTA-SK(-)Duplex HEquation 3 The endonucleolytic activity of endonuclease V on these two DNA duplexes were compared with that on duplex I/SK which was formed by annealing oligo I to single-stranded SK(−) T/A (see Equation 4). 5'-GGTCGACTI_AGGAAGGATCCCCGGGTAC-3'3'-GGGCCCGACGTCCAGCTGAA_TCCTCCTAGGGGCCCATGGGTTAAGC-SK(−)T/AEquation 4 Fig. 4 shows that in the presence of 2 mm MgCl2, the endonucleolytic activity of endonuclease V on deoxyuridine-containing DNA was much lower compared with that on deoxyinosine-containing DNA. The enzyme cleaved deoxyuridine-containing DNA only at a high enzyme concentration, and the activity did not appear to increase proportionally with an increase in enzyme concentration. Since duplex F and duplex H contained U/T and U/C mispairs, respectively, cleavage activity on these duplexes could be due to the mismatch-specific activity of endonuclease V. We have shown earlier that the mismatch-specific activity of endonuclease V was much higher in the presence of Mn2+ than Mg2+, and we thus examined whether endonuclease V had increased endonucleolytic activity on duplexes F and H when reactions were performed in the presence of Mn2+. In the presence of Mn2+, endonuclease V had a much higher activity on deoxyuridine-containing DNA, about 20-fold higher than in the presence of Mg2+ at most enzyme concentrations tested (Fig.5). Interestingly, in the presence of Mn2+, the endonucleolytic activity of endonuclease V on duplexes F and H increased proportionally to the increase in the amount of enzyme. In contrast to the earlier observations (7Yao M. Kow Y.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31390-31396Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Yao M. Kow Y.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28609-28616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), the deoxyuridine-specific endonuclease activity of endonuclease V was found to have an optimal pH between 8.0 and 8.5, which is similar to the optimal pH observed for mismatch- and deoxyinosine-specific activity (data not shown). However, the deoxyuridine endonuclease activity of endonuclease V was less sensitive to higher pH values; 60–70% of the deoxyuridine endonuclease activity remained when the pH of the reaction was increase to 9.5. At this pH, both the mismatch- and deoxyinosine-specific activity of the enzyme was inhibited to less than 20% of the optimum activity (data not shown).Figure 5Comparison of deoxyuridine-specific activity of endonuclease V in the presence of Mg2+ and Mn2+. Endonucleolytic activity of endonuclease V on U21/SK and U24/SK were assayed either in the presence of Mg2+ (solid bar) or in the presence of Mn2+ (open bar) with the indicated amount of endonuclease V. When performed in the presence of Mg2+, the reactions followed the standard endonuclease assay conditions for deoxyinosine-specific activity. When performed in the presence of Mn2+, the reactions followed the standard endonuclease assay conditions for mismatch-specific activity. The protein concentrations used for the cleavage reactions ranged from 0.65 to 130 nm. The percentage of substrate cleavage was quantified and plotted against the enzyme concentration.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Since duplex F and duplex H contain a U/T and U/C mispair, respectively, it is uncertain whether the endonucleolytic activity observed on these duplexes is due to the specific recognition of dU or to the base mismatch. To determine whether endonuclease V has a specific recognition for deoxyuridine, we prepared the following oligonucleotide duplexes: 5'-GGTCGACTU_AGGAGGATCCCCGGGTAC-3'3'-ACGTCCAGCTGAXTCCTCCTAGGGGCC-5'Duplex U/XEquation 5 5'-GGTCGACTXAGGAGGATCCCCGGGTAC-3'3'-ACGTCCAGCTGAU_TCCTCCTAGGGGCC-5'Duplex X/UEquation 6 In these duplexes, X stands for either dA, dT, dC, or dG. Thus, Duplex U/X can contain either U/A pair or U/T, U/C, or U/G mispair and duplex X/U can contain either an A/U pair or a T/U, C/U, or G/U mispair. Fig. 6 shows that endonuclease V cleaved oligo U in these duplexes efficiently in the presence of Mn2+, no matter whether dU was paired with dA or mispaired with other bases. We have shown earlier (7Yao M. Kow Y.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31390-31396Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that if X/U or U/X (X being any of the four bases) in these duplexes were replaced by mismatched pairs, endonuclease V cleaved only the top strand whose 5′ terminus is closer to the mismatches. However, if U/X or X/U was replaced with I/X orX/I, the enzyme cleaves the strand containing deoxyinosine whether it is on the top strand or the bottom strand. Since endonuclease V cleaved the deoxyuridine-containing strand in both duplex U/X and duplex X/U (Fig. 6, Aand B), the enzyme specifically recognizes deoxyuridine in a manner similar to the recognition of deoxyinosine. In addition, endonuclease V possesses a very weak activity on single-stranded DNA containing deoxyuridine (data not shown), further indicating that the enzyme recognizes deoxyuridine specifically in the DNA. However, it is interesting to note that the deoxyuridine-specific activity of the enzyme had a similar divalent ion requirement as the mismatch-specific activity. Even on Duplex U/A, which contains a U/A pair, the endonucleolytic activity of the enzyme was 5-fold more active in the presence of Mn2+ than in the presence of Mg2+. Furthermore, in the presence of Mn2+, although endonuclease V binds more tightly to duplex U/A than to duplex A/A, more than 20% of radioactive material migrated as cleaved oligonucleotides in an EMSA when duplex U/A was used as DNA substrate (data not shown). Thus, the deoxyuridine endonuclease activity of endonuclease V exhibit features that is distinct from the deoxyinosine- and mismatch-specific endonuclease activity. To further understand the mechanism involved in the substrate recognition by endonuclease V, the gene coding for the enzyme was cloned into an overproducing pET plasmid and large quantities were purified. In agreement with earlier studies (8Yao M. Kow Y.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28609-28616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), purified endonuclease V formed two stable complexes with DNA containing deoxyinosine, both under optimal cleavage and noncleavage conditions. The estimated affinity of endonuclease V for dI-containing oligonucleotides in complexes I and II were 2 and 60 nm, respectively. In contrast, the enzyme exhibits a much weaker interaction with DNA containing base mismatches. Under noncleavage conditions,i.e. in the presence of NaCl, theK d 1 andK d 2 determined for complexes I and II with mismatched DNA was 58 and 62 nm, respectively. Under optimal cleavage conditions (i.e. in the presence of Mn2+), most of the radioactive material was found to be associated with the cleaved products that were not complexed with endonuclease V. These data indicate that endonuclease V has a poor affinity to nicked mismatch-containing DNA, suggesting that the enzyme dissociates from mismatched DNA after cleavage. This is in sharp contrast to the interaction of the enzyme with deoxyinosine-containing DNA in which the enzyme remains bound to DNA containing deoxyinosine even after cleavage (Fig. 1) (8Yao M. Kow Y.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28609-28616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The much largerK d 1 of the enzyme for DNA containing base mismatches further demonstrates a weaker interaction of endonuclease V with DNA containing mismatches. Interestingly, theK d 2 of the enzyme for DNA containing base matches is similar to that for DNA containing deoxyinosine. This is in agreement with our earlier studies (8Yao M. Kow Y.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28609-28616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) which suggest that complex II is formed through protein-protein interaction by binding of a second molecule of endonuclease V to the first molecule of endonuclease V in complex I. Thus, K d 2 reflects the affinity of the second molecule of endonuclease V to complex I. It is interesting to note that, under optimal cleavage conditions, although less than 10% of complex I was formed between the enzyme and mismatch-containing DNA, close to 40% of complex II was formed at a high enzyme concentration (130 nm). These data suggest that the second molecule of the enzyme stabilizes the interaction between the enzyme and the nicked mismatch-containing DNA, probably by bridging together the DNAs 5′ and 3′ to the nick. The result also indicates that the formation of complex I is a critical step in the interaction of the enzyme with DNA containing mismatch. The large difference in stability between the complex I derived from the interaction of endonuclease V with deoxyinosine- and deoxynebularine-containing DNA suggests that the 6-keto group of deoxyinosine is critical for the binding of the enzyme to the DNA. The role of the 6-keto group has been suggested earlier to be important for the specific recognition of deoxyinosine both in single- and double-stranded DNA (7Yao M. Kow Y.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31390-31396Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with this hypothesis, we showed here that the stability of complex I formed with different substrates were as follows, deoxyinosine ≫ deoxyuridine > deoxynebularine, single base mismatches. It is possible that this 6-keto group interacts specifically with positively charged group(s) of the protein through an ionic interaction. However, endonuclease V did not form stable complexes with DNA containing a guanine which possesses a 6-keto and a 2-amino group. It is possible that the 2-amino group of guanine extends outside the “binding pocket” of endonuclease V, thus providing steric hindrance to the interaction of endonuclease V with the 6-keto group. Furthermore, the ability of endonuclease V to recognize deoxyuridine in DNA, as demonstrated by the ability of endonuclease V to nick both single- and double-stranded DNA containing deoxyuridine, suggests that the 4-keto group of uracil can interact favorably with endonuclease V and deoxyuridine can also enter the binding pocket of the protein. Similar to guanine, the 5-methyl group of thymine might also provide steric hindrance to the unique interaction of endonuclease V with dU. The inability of endonuclease V to bind to thymine is thus reminiscent of the failure of uracil DNAN-glycosylase to recognize thymine in DNA (11Savva R. McAuley-Hecht K. Brown T. Pearl L. Nature. 1995; 373: 487-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar, 12Mol C.D. Arvai A.S. Slupphaug G. Kavli B. Alseth I. Krokan H.E. Tainer J.A. Cell. 1995; 80: 869-878Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). The interaction of endonuclease V with DNA can be best illustrated in Scheme FS1 in which deoxyuridine is shown overlaying with deoxyinosine, deoxycytidine with deoxyadenosine, and thymidine with deoxyguanosine. Endonuclease V interacts specifically with the 6-keto group of hypoxanthine and 4-keto group of uracil, probably through an ionic interaction (Scheme FS1 A). The complexes formed by the enzyme with duplex U/A is much less stable than those formed with duplex I/A. The weaker interaction of the enzyme with DNA containing deoxyuridine can be explained by the fact that the keto group of uracil (4-keto) is located in a position toward the imidazole ring of hypoxanthine, perhaps further away from the group(s) in the protein that give rise to the strong interaction with the 6-keto group of hypoxanthine. When the keto groups are replaced by amino groups (Scheme FS1 B), no specific interaction of endonuclease V with the DNA was observed, demonstrating the importance of the keto groups for the specific interaction. For thymine and guanine (SchemeFS1 C), although both bases have the required keto group for specific interaction with endonuclease V, the presence of a 5-methyl (thymine) or a 2-amino group (guanine) seems to abolish this specific interaction, presumably due to steric hindrance. However, endonuclease V can still interact with these bases in a strand specific manner when they are present in a base mismatches, probably due to changes in the secondary structures of DNA. Based on this model, it is thus expected that mutation of some specific amino acid residues might affect only the deoxyinosine-specific endonuclease activity but not the mismatch-specific activities of endonuclease V.

Cbl is a cytosolic protein found in all hematopoietic cell lineages and some non-hematopoietic tissues such as testis, lung, and brain. It is a major target of tyrosine phosphorylation after the engagement of multiple receptor types, including the antigen receptors for T and B cells; Fc receptors; receptors for EGF, colony-stimulating factor-1, and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor; and the thrombopoietin and erythropoietin receptors, suggesting that Cbl is involved in signal transduction pathways triggered by these distinct receptors (15Donovan J.A.

However, the presence of multiple sites within Cbl with the potential for binding to SH2 and SH3 domains and the finding that Cbl interacts with a wide variety of proteins involved in signal transduction suggest that it may function as a complex adapter molecule (24Tsygankov A.Y.

Grb2 has recently been implicated as a regulator of the Ras activation pathway after TCR engagement by virtue of its ability to mediate the translocation of the guanine nucleotide exchange factor Sos from the cytosol to the membrane, where it can interact with and activate Ras (34McCormick F. Nature. 1993; 363: 15-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar, 35Holsinger L.J. Spencer D.M. Austin D.J. Schreiber S.L. Crabtree G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Nature. 1993; 363: 45-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (1008) Google Scholar). In Caenorhabditis elegans, a Cbl homolog, Sli-1, acts as a negative regulator of the Ras homolog, Let60, possibly by regulating the activity of Sem5, a Grb2 homolog (37Yoon C.H. Lee J. Jongeward G.D. Sternberg P.W. Science. 1995; 269: 1102-1105Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). In addition, a transforming mutant Cbl protein, 70Z/3, has been implicated in the activation of Ras-dependent signaling pathways that are involved in the induction of NF-AT, a transcriptional regulator involved in interleukin-2 (IL-2) gene expression (38Liu Y.-C. Elly C. Langdon W.Y. Altman A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 168-173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Ras activation in T lymphocytes controls the assembly of the AP1 complex, a transcription factor complex that binds to site(s) within the IL-2 gene enhancer (11Crabtree G.R. Clipstone N.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 1045-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar). We have therefore evaluated whether Cbl can regulate Ras-dependent signaling in T lymphocytes by using Cbl overexpression in conjunction with an AP1 reporter gene construct. We have found that Cbl overexpression inhibited TCR-induced AP1 and Erk2 activation. We further observed a T cell activation-induced exchange of Cbl for Sos on Grb2, suggesting one potential mechanism by which Cbl could regulate Ras activation in T lymphocytes. 4β-Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) was from Calbiochem Corp. (Nottingham, United Kingdom). The anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody (OKT3) was a generous gift from Ortho Biotech, Inc. (Raritan, NJ). The rabbit anti-Cbl antibody (C-15) that recognizes amino acids 892–906, the rabbit anti-Grb2 antibody (C-23), and the anti-Erk2 antibody (C-14) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). The anti-active mitogen-activated protein kinase antibody was from Promega (Madison, WI). The mouse anti-Sos1 antibody was from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). The R5 anti-Cbl antibody, which is directed against the carboxyl-terminal region of the Cbl protein (amino acids 143–450), was provided by Dr. W. Langdon (University of Western Australia) (39Blake T.J. Heath K.G. Langdon W.Y. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2017-2026Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The anti-hemagglutinin (HA) monoclonal antibody (12CA5) was used as ascites from the corresponding hyridoma. All restriction enzymes were from New England Biolabs Inc. (Beverly, MA) or Life Technologies, Inc. The AP1 reporter vector (AP1-SEAP) and the myristoylated Sos expression plasmid (MSosE) were provided by Dr. G. Crabtree (Stanford University Medical School) (35Holsinger L.J. Spencer D.M. Austin D.J. Schreiber S.L. Crabtree G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Laborda (Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, Food and Drug Administration) (40Benito M. Porras A. Nebreda A.R. Santos E. Science. 1991; 253: 565-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). The tagged Erk2 expression plasmid pcDNAIII HA-erk2 (Erk2-HA) was provided by Dr. S. Gutkind (National Institutes of Health). The human Cbl expression plasmid pCI-Cbl was generated by excising the Cbl cDNA from pJZen-Cbl (39Blake T.J. Heath K.G. Langdon W.Y. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2017-2026Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) with BamHI and cloning it into the BamHI site of pGEM-11Zf+(Promega). Orientation was confirmed by restriction digestion. Cbl cDNA was then excised from a pGEM-11 clone with the correct orientation using XhoI and NotI and cloned into the expression vector pCI-neo (Promega) through the XhoI andNotI sites. The pCI-c/v-Cbl expression construct was made in an identical manner except that the cDNA was excised from pJZen-c/v-Cbl (39Blake T.J. Heath K.G. Langdon W.Y. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2017-2026Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The Jurkat cell line used was a high CD4-expressing line generated by Drs. T. Oravecz and M. Norcross (Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, Food and Drug Administration). Jurkat cells were maintained and transfected by electroporation as described (41Rellahan B.L. Jensen J.P. Weissman A.M. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 1529-1534Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Jurkat cells (107) were transfected with 4 μg of AP1-SEAP and the indicated expression vectors. Multiple transfections were pooled and allowed to rest for 24 h. The cells were then resuspended in fresh medium, divided into wells at ∼3.3 × 106 cells/well, and either left unstimulated or activated with immobilized OKT3 (20 μg/well) or 10 nm PMA for 12 h. All stimulations were done in duplicate. The supernatant was collected, heated at 65 °C for 30 min, and assayed for alkaline phosphatase activity as follows. 100 μl of supernatant was incubated with 100 μl of 2 × assay buffer (0.2 m EDTA, 2.0 m diethanolamine, 1 mm MgCl2, and 20 mml-homoarginine), pH 9.8, for 5 min, at which time 100 μl of CSPD substrate (Tropix Inc., Bedford, MA) diluted 1:80 in a solution of one-third Emerald Enhance (Tropix Inc.) and two-thirds reaction buffer (0.2 m EDTA, 100 mmdiethanolamine, and 1.0 mm MgCl2), pH 10, was added, and samples were read on an ML3000 microplate luminometer (Dynatech Laboratories Inc., Chantilly, VA). Cells were stimulated with 10 μg of soluble OKT3/107 cells in 0.5 ml of phosphate-buffered saline with 1% bovine serum albumin and lysed by adding an equal volume of 2 × lysis buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, 4 mmvanadate, 10 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, and 2% Triton X-100 with protease and phosphatase inhibitors), pH 7.8. Cleared lysates were precipitated with anti-Grb2 bound to protein A-Trisacryl beads (Pierce) or with the indicated GST fusion protein (100 pmol) bound to glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden). Washed precipitates were eluted in sample buffer, resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Hybond-C Super, Amersham Corp.) in 23 mm Tris-HCl, 192 mm glycine, and 20% (v/v) methanol. Membranes were blocked and probed with primary antibodies followed by a rabbit anti-mouse antibody (Cappel, West Chester, PA), if required, and 125I-protein A (ICN). To analyze Erk activation, Jurkat cells were transfected with 5 μg of either pCI-c/v-Cbl or pCI-Cbl and 2.5 μg of Erk2-HA plasmid and allowed to rest for 24 h. Cells were then left unstimulated or stimulated for 20 min with pervanadate (0.1 mm vanadate and 0.3 mm H2O2) or PMA, lysed, and precipitated with an anti-HA antibody. Equal volumes of the precipitated proteins were then loaded onto gels and analyzed by Western blotting with both an anti-active mitogen-activated protein kinase antibody and an anti-Erk2 antibody. The degree of Erk2 activation was calculated by determining the amount of active Erk2 compared with the amount of total Erk2 in a given sample. Western blots were quantitated by a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager using ImageQuant™ software (Version 3.3). The plasmid pGEX-KG-Grb2-N-SH3, which encodes a GST fusion protein of the amino-terminal SH3 domain of Grb2, was provided by Dr. W. Wong (NIDR, National Institutes of Health) (42Sastri L. Lin W. Wong W.T. DiFiore P.P. Scoppa C.A. King C.R. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 1107-1112PubMed Google Scholar). The GST fusion protein of the proline-rich region of Cbl (pGEX-Cbl-polyP) corresponds to amino acids 458–669 of Cbl and was provided by Dr. M. Shapiro (Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, Food and Drug Administration). All other GST-Grb2 fusion proteins were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. The IL-2 enhancer is composed of numerous regulatory elements that work in concert to regulate IL-2 production after T cell activation (11Crabtree G.R. Clipstone N.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 1045-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar). One of these elements consists of a conventional AP1 site. After TCR engagement, the induction of AP1 activity is dependent on the activation of multiple effector pathways by Ras (13Deng T. Karin M. Nature. 1994; 371: 171-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar, 43Buday L. Egan S.E. Rodriguez Viciana P. Cantrell D.A. Downward J. J. Biol.

We therefore used the reporter construct AP1-SEAP, which has the secreted alkaline phosphatase gene under the control of an IL-2 minimal promoter with upstream AP1-binding sites, to assess the effects of Cbl overexpression on TCR-induced AP1 activation. Jurkat T cells were transfected with AP1-SEAP and increasing amounts of a Cbl expression plasmid (pCI-Cbl) or a control vector (pCI-neo) and allowed to rest for 24 h. Cbl overexpression at this point in time was verified by Western blot analysis (Fig.1 A). The cells were then activated with OKT3 or the phorbol ester PMA, which stimulates the Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway in a TCR/tyrosine kinase-independent manner (48Williams D.H. Woodrow M. Cantrell D.A. Murray E.J. Eur. J. Immunol. 1995; 25: 42-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 49Gulbins E. Coggeshall K.M. Baier G. Telford D. Langlet C. Baier-Bitterlich G. Bonnefoy-Berard N. Burn P. Wittinghofer A. Altman A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4749-4758Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Overexpression of Cbl led to a dose-dependent decrease in AP1 activity after stimulation with OKT3 that reached a maximum at ∼30–40% of the control response (Fig. 1 B). Cbl overexpression led to a similar decrease in AP1 activity in cells stimulated with the pharmacologic activator pervanadate (Fig. 1 C), which mimics the activation events generated by TCR ligation (50Lee J.M. Fournel M. Veillette A. Branton P.E. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 253-263PubMed Google Scholar, 51O'Shea J.J. McVicar D.W. Bailey T.L. Burns C. Smyth M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10306-10310Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). However, responses to PMA were unaffected by Cbl overexpression (Fig. 1 B). Cbl overexpression also had no effect on the ability of an activated form of Ras (H-RasLys12) or an activating form of Sos (MSosE) to stimulate AP1 activity in Jurkat cells (Fig. 1 D). These data suggest that Cbl overexpression affects AP1 activation prior to or independent of the activation of Ras itself and without directly affecting the ability of Sos to mediate Ras activation. The viral homolog of Cbl, v-Cbl, is a fusion between the group-specific antigen protein of the CAS NS-1 retrovirus and the first 360 amino acids of the Cbl protein (39Blake T.J. Heath K.G. Langdon W.Y. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2017-2026Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). This fusion protein localizes predominantly to the nucleus and is capable of inducing the transformation of NIH 3T3 cells. Removal of the viral group-specific antigen protein resulted in a protein (designated c/v-Cbl) (Fig.2 A) that could be found in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, but retained the ability to transform cells (39Blake T.J. Heath K.G. Langdon W.Y. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2017-2026Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). To assess the effect that c/v-Cbl had on AP1 activation in T cells, an expression plasmid encoding the truncated protein (pCI-c/v-Cbl) was cotransfected with AP1-SEAP into Jurkat cells. Transfection of pCI-c/v-Cbl resulted in expression of the truncated protein (Fig. 2 B), but had no effect on AP1 activation after stimulation with OKT3 (Fig. 2 C) or pervanadate (data not shown). These data indicate that c/v-Cbl does not affect TCR-induced AP1 activation. In addition, these data suggest that the inhibitory effect of Cbl overexpression on AP1 activation requires the proline-rich carboxyl-terminal region of Cbl. This region contains multiple potential SH3-binding sites, including a binding site for Grb2, as demonstrated by the ability of a GST fusion protein encompassing a portion of this region to interact with and precipitate Grb2 (Fig. 3 A, lower panel) (33Donovan J.A. Ota Y. Langdon W.Y. Samelson L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26369-26374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). During T cell activation, Grb2 is thought to mediate the translocation of Sos from the cytosol to the membrane, thus allowing Sos to interact with and activate Ras. Cbl and Sos bind preferentially and in a mutually exclusive manner to the amino-terminal SH3 domain of Grb2 (data not shown and Refs. 25Buday L. Khwaja A. Sipeki S. Farago A. Downward J. J. Biol.

We therefore reasoned that Cbl could regulate AP1 complex assembly by controlling Ras activation via the Sos/Grb2 interaction.Figure 3Cbl and Sos bind to Grb2 in a reciprocal manner.

In unstimulated T cells, Cbl readily associates with the amino-terminal SH3 domain of Grb2, as can be shown by the ability of Cbl to react with a GST fusion protein consisting of this Grb2 domain (Fig. 3 A, upper panel). Cbl associates very weakly with the carboxyl-terminal SH3 domain of Grb2 and not at all with the SH2 domain, even after activation through the TCR (Fig.3 A and data not shown). Activation of Jurkat cells with OKT3 or pervanadate for 2 min leads to a substantial decrease in the amount of Cbl recovered with the full-length Grb2 fusion protein and the GST-Grb2 N-terminal SH3 domain fusion protein (Fig. 3, A andB). The dissociation of Cbl from Grb2 is due to modifications of Cbl itself (either a direct post-translational modification or an induced structural change), rather than to Grb2, as demonstrated by the ability of a GST fusion protein of a fragment of the proline-rich region of Cbl to precipitate equal amounts of Grb2 from unactivated and activated Jurkat cells (Fig. 3 A,lower panel). An activation-dependent dissociation of Cbl from Grb2 was also observed when Cbl was coprecipitated with Grb2 by using a Grb2 antiserum, confirming that it is a physiologic consequence of T cell activation (Fig. 3 C). Interestingly, in unstimulated Jurkat cells, little Sos could be coprecipitated with Grb2, although the amount of Sos that associated with Grb2 increased considerably after activation (Fig. 3 C). The inducible association of Sos with Grb2 after TCR engagement is consistent with the data of Nel et al. (53Nel A.E. Gupta S. Lee L. Ledbetter J.A. Kanner S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18428-18436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) and Ravichandranet al. (54Ravichandran K.S. Lorenz U. Shoelson S.E. Burakoff S.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 593-600Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), who found it to persist for up to 30 min. Our data indicate that Cbl and Sos interact with an interchangeable pool of Grb2 and suggest that Cbl can regulate TCR-mediated, Sos-dependent activation of the Ras pathway in T lymphocytes by competing with Sos for binding to the amino-terminal SH3 domain of G"
https://openalex.org/W2018132272,"Human colorectal tumors commonly contain mutations in Ki-ras but rarely, if ever, in Ha-ras. The selectivity for Ki-ras mutations in this tumor was explored using the HD6-4 colon epithelial cell line which contains no ras mutations. After adhesion to an extracellular matrix, HD6-4 cells polarize into columnar goblet cells with distinct apical and basal regions. Stable HD6-4 transfectants were made with mini-gene constructs of the oncogenic cellular Ki-ras4BG12V gene, the oncogenic Ha-ras G12V gene, or mini-gene constructs of wild-type Ki-ras4B as a control. Ki-rasmutations, but not Ha-ras mutations, disrupted colon epithelial cell apicobasal polarity and adhesion to collagen I and laminin. Three Ha-ras transfectants and three Ki-ras transfectants exhibited Ras proteins expressing the Val-12 mutation by Western blotting with pan-ras G12V antibody. Only wild-type Ki-ras transfectant cells and oncogenic Ha-rastransfectant cells synthesized the mature, fully glycosylated forms of β1 integrin. Instead of the mature integrin β1-chain, a faster migrating β1-chain intermediate was detected on the cell surface and in the cytoplasm of the oncogenic Ki-ras transfectants. Expression of the oncogenic Ki-ras gene caused the altered β1 integrin maturation because phosphorothiolated antisense oligonucleotides to Ki-ras reduced expression of both the mutant Ki-Ras protein and the aberrant integrin β1-chain and increased expression of the mature integrin β1-chain. Altered glycosylation generated the new β1 integrin form since integrin core β1-chain proteins of the same molecular weight were yielded in Ki-ras, Ha-ras, and control transfectants after removal of sugar residues with endoglycosidase F or following tunicamycin treatment to inhibit glycosylation. The selective effect of oncogenic Ki-ras on β1 integrin glycosylation was not due to selective activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases because both mutated Ki- and Ha-ras genes activated this pathway and increased cell proliferation. Since blocking the glycosylation of integrin β1-chain inhibited the adherence, polarization, and subsequent differentiation of colon epithelial cells, the selective effects of the oncogenic cellular Ki-ras gene on integrin β1-chain glycosylation may account, at least in part, for the selection of Ki-ras mutations in human colon tumors. Human colorectal tumors commonly contain mutations in Ki-ras but rarely, if ever, in Ha-ras. The selectivity for Ki-ras mutations in this tumor was explored using the HD6-4 colon epithelial cell line which contains no ras mutations. After adhesion to an extracellular matrix, HD6-4 cells polarize into columnar goblet cells with distinct apical and basal regions. Stable HD6-4 transfectants were made with mini-gene constructs of the oncogenic cellular Ki-ras4BG12V gene, the oncogenic Ha-ras G12V gene, or mini-gene constructs of wild-type Ki-ras4B as a control. Ki-rasmutations, but not Ha-ras mutations, disrupted colon epithelial cell apicobasal polarity and adhesion to collagen I and laminin. Three Ha-ras transfectants and three Ki-ras transfectants exhibited Ras proteins expressing the Val-12 mutation by Western blotting with pan-ras G12V antibody. Only wild-type Ki-ras transfectant cells and oncogenic Ha-rastransfectant cells synthesized the mature, fully glycosylated forms of β1 integrin. Instead of the mature integrin β1-chain, a faster migrating β1-chain intermediate was detected on the cell surface and in the cytoplasm of the oncogenic Ki-ras transfectants. Expression of the oncogenic Ki-ras gene caused the altered β1 integrin maturation because phosphorothiolated antisense oligonucleotides to Ki-ras reduced expression of both the mutant Ki-Ras protein and the aberrant integrin β1-chain and increased expression of the mature integrin β1-chain. Altered glycosylation generated the new β1 integrin form since integrin core β1-chain proteins of the same molecular weight were yielded in Ki-ras, Ha-ras, and control transfectants after removal of sugar residues with endoglycosidase F or following tunicamycin treatment to inhibit glycosylation. The selective effect of oncogenic Ki-ras on β1 integrin glycosylation was not due to selective activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases because both mutated Ki- and Ha-ras genes activated this pathway and increased cell proliferation. Since blocking the glycosylation of integrin β1-chain inhibited the adherence, polarization, and subsequent differentiation of colon epithelial cells, the selective effects of the oncogenic cellular Ki-ras gene on integrin β1-chain glycosylation may account, at least in part, for the selection of Ki-ras mutations in human colon tumors. The mammalian ras gene family contains three homologous members, Ki-ras, Ha-ras, and N-ras. Each encodes a 21-kDa protein of either 188 or 189 amino acid residues. The first 85 amino acids of each ras isoform are identical, and the next 80 amino acids exhibit an 85% homology. The remaining C-terminal sequence is highly divergent between the isoforms and so is termed the hyper-variable domain. The last four amino acids in the C terminus constitute the CAAX motif, which is required for post-translational modification and subsequent membrane localization after gene-specific lipid modifications (1Lowy D. Willumsen B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 851-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (1127) Google Scholar). The C-terminal region can substitute for the entire gene in localizing the downstream effector raf to the plasma membrane (2Leevers S. Paterson H. Marshall C. Nature. 1994; 369: 411-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (886) Google Scholar). Ras proteins switch between an active form that binds GTP and an inactive form that binds GDP (3Boguski M. McCormick F. Nature. 1993; 366: 643-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (1762) Google Scholar). Activated ras in turn activates the serine-threonine kinase raf-1 which then activates MAP 1The abbreviations used are: MAP, mitogen-activated protein; MDCK, Madin-Darby canine kidney cells; PVDF, polyvinylidene difluoride; DME medium, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; MBP, myelin basic protein; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid. kinase kinases (MEKs) which in turn activate the p42/44 MAP kinases (Erks). Ras also activates raf-independent signaling pathways leading to activation of JNK kinases. Although there is evidence linking the raf/MEK/MAP kinase pathway to cellular transformation, ras may mediate some aspects of transformation through raf-independent pathways. Non-raf candidate ras effectors include Rho family proteins, two Ras GTPase-activating proteins (p120 and NF1), guanine nucleotide exchange factors for Ral proteins, and phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase (reviewed in Ref. 4Cahill M.A. Janknecht R. Nordheim A. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 16-19Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). The possible contributions of rasactivation to transformation include altered transcription and translation, alterations in the cytoskeleton, and altered cell surface carbohydrates (5Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14553-14556Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Dennis J.W. Kosh K. Bryce D.M. Breitman M.L. Oncogene. 1989; 4: 853-860PubMed Google Scholar). Oncogenic mutations detected in Ha-, Ki-, and N-ras genes isolated from different human tumors localize in the N-terminal region controlling GTP binding, suggesting the genes become oncogenic when they remain in the GTP-bound state. Mutations in predominantly one of the three mammalian ras genes have been found associated with specific human cancers. For example, Ha-ras mutations have been reported in 18% of transitional cell carcinomas of the human urinary bladder, whereas very few mutations in Ki-ras were observed (7Burchill S. Neal D. Lunec J. J. Urol. 1994; 73: 516-521Crossref Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 8Sandberg A. Berger C. J. Urol. 1994; 151: 545-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). In contrast, the vast majority, over 90%, of pancreatic adenocarcinomas contain mutations in the Ki-ras gene and not in N-ras or Ha-ras (9Smit V. Boot A. Smits A. Flueren G. Cornelisse C. Bos J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 7773-7782Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar). Specificity of ras mutations is also seen in colon cancers, in which roughly 40–50% of cases exhibit activating mutations in the Ki-ras gene. Only a few percent of cases exhibit N-ras mutations, whereas Ha-rasmutations are very uncommon in colon cancers (10Bos J. Fearon E. Hamilton S. Verlann-de Vries M. van Boom J. van der Eb A. Vogelstein B. Nature. 1987; 327: 293-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (1610) Google Scholar, 11Forrester K. Almoguera C. Han K. Grizzle W.E. Perucho M. Nature. 1987; 327: 298-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (911) Google Scholar). N-rasmutations have been found in approximately 20–25% of cases of acute myeloid leukemia, although mutations in Ki-ras were infrequent (12Bos J. Verlann-de Vries M. van der Eb A.J. Janssen J. Delwel R. Lowenberg B. Colly L. Blood. 1987; 69: 1237-1241Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The reason for the selectivity for a specific mutatedras isoform in a tumor type is not known but may be due to the importance of that isoform in controlling proliferation within that cell type. Recently it was shown using gene-specific antisense oligonucleotides that Ki-ras, but not Ha-ras, contributes to the proliferation of normal human lung fibroblasts (MCR-5 cells), whereas oncogenic Ha-ras drives proliferation of T24 human bladder carcinoma cells (13Chen G. Oh S. Monia B.P. Stacey D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28259-28265Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Both Ha-Ras and Ki-Ras proteins are expressed in colon epithelial cells (14Augenlicht L. Augeron C. Yander G. LaBoisse C. Cancer Res. 1987; 47: 3763-3765PubMed Google Scholar) but may have different functions. We wished to determine whether mutations in the Ki-ras gene which are found in colon carcinoma cells induce another function in addition to cell growth through the MAP kinase cascade. Viral Ki-ras prevents the polarization of MDCK kidney epithelial cells (15Schoenenberger C.-A. Zuk A. Kendall D. Matlin K. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 112: 873-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 16Schoenenberger C.-A. Zuk A. Zinkl G. Kendall D. Matlin K. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 527-541Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) suggesting the mutated cellular Ki-ras gene may have a similar function in colon epithelial cells. Studies in tissue culture have shown that cellular polarization may require both E-cadherin-mediated cell to cell contact and integrin-mediated cell-substratum interactions (17Eaton S. Simons K. Cell. 1995; 82: 5-8Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). E-cadherin is critical to the formation of the basolateral domain, whereas the orientation of the apicobasal axis depends on integrin-mediated associations with the substratum. We now compare the effects of two ras genes, the Ki-ras which is often mutated in colon cancer and the Ha-ras which is rarely, if ever, mutated in colon cancer, on colon epithelial cell polarity, integrin-mediated adhesion, and integrin expression and function. The expression plasmids utilized are a mini-gene construct of the large cellular Ki-ras4B gene (18Kahn S. Yamamoto F. Almoguera C. Winter E. Forrester K. Jordano J. Perucho M. Anticancer Res. 1987; 7: 639-652PubMed Google Scholar) and an oncogenic cellular Ha-ras gene, both mutated at codon 12 from Gly to Val. The colon epithelial cell used is the HD6-4 line, which binds strongly to collagen I through the integrin heterodimer α2β1 (19Hafez M. Hsu S. Yan Z. Winawer S. Friedman E. Cell Growth Differ. 1992; 3: 753-762PubMed Google Scholar). After binding to collagen I, HD6-4 cells then polarize into columnar cells with distinctive basal and apical compartments. These columnar cells differentiate into a specialized epithelial cell type, the colon goblet cell, with a basal nucleus and an apical theca containing mucin granules (20Hafez M. Infante D. Winawer S. Friedman E. Yan Z. Hsu S. Winawer S. Friedman E. Cell Growth Differ. 1990; 1: 617-626PubMed Google Scholar). HD6-4 cells contain inactivating mutations in the tumor suppressor genes p53 and APC but have wild-type ras genes, making them suitable recipients for oncogenic ras genes (21Huang F. Hsu S. Yan Z. Winawer S. Friedman E. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 3701-3706PubMed Google Scholar). We now find that constitutive expression of oncogenic Ki-ras, but not oncogenic Ha-ras, prevents the establishment of columnar cell polarity in HD6 cells by blocking glycosylation and maturation of integrin β1-chain, thus reducing the capacity of this integrin to mediate binding to extracellular matrix components. [α-32P]GTP, 125I, [32P]H3PO4, and [35S]methionine were obtained from NEN Life Science Products, protein A-Sepharose from Pharmacia Biotech Inc., PVDF transfer paper Immobulin-P from Millipore, and PEI-cellulose-F TLC plates from EM Separations. Pan-ras rat monoclonal antisera Y13-259 which reacts with the p21 translational products of the Ha-, Ki- and N-ras human oncogenes; monoclonal pan-ras Val-12 antibody which reacts with only the forms of the ras oncogenes mutated at codon 12 to valine; c-Ki-ras Ab1 (clone 234-4.2) a mouse monoclonal antibody specific for c- and v-Ki-ras p21 and not recognizing c-Ha-ras or c-Ha-ras p21; c-Ha-ras (Ab-1) clone 235–1.7.1 a mouse monoclonal antibody specific for Ha-Ras and not Ki-Ras or N-Ras p21 proteins, and purified p21 recombinant protein Ki-RasVal-12 were purchased from Oncogene Science. Phosphorothioate oligodeoxynucleotides were a gift of Dr. Brett Monia, Isis Pharmaceuticals, Carlsbad, CA. Isis-2503 is a 20-mer targeted to the initiation codon (AUG) of c-Ha-rasmRNA (TCC-GTC-ATC-GCT-CCT-CAG-GG), and Isis-13177 is a 20-mer of random sequence; Isis-6957 is a 20-mer targeted to the 5′-UTR of Ki-ras (CAG-TGC-CTG-CGC-CGC-GCT-CG). This sequence is found within the promoter region of c-Ki-ras4B gene cloned into pMiKVal-12 (see below), about 60 base pairs upstream of the translational start. Anti-integrin β1, a polyclonal mouse IgG-clone 18 raised to a protein fragment corresponding to amino acids 76–256 of human integrin β1-chain, a region of the extracellular domain, was purchased from Transduction Laboratories and was used for immunoblotting. Monoclonal antibody clone P4C10, an IgG1 isotype directed to integrin β1-chain was purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. and was used for immunoprecipitation and cell binding studies. Phospho-specific MAP kinase antibody and p44/42 MAP kinase antibody were rabbit polyclonal IgGs from New England BioLabs, and endoglycosidase F (N-glycosidase F-free), also known as endo-β-N-acetylglucosidase F, was purchased from Boehringer Mannheim. Collagen I was purchased from the Collagen Corp., Palo Alto, CA. Fibronectin and tunicamycin were purchased from Sigma, and laminin was from Life Technologies, Inc. The HD6 human colon carcinoma cell line (20Hafez M. Infante D. Winawer S. Friedman E. Yan Z. Hsu S. Winawer S. Friedman E. Cell Growth Differ. 1990; 1: 617-626PubMed Google Scholar) was subcloned from the HT29 cell line and recloned as the HD6-4 line immediately before transfection. The parental and transfectant lines were maintained in DME medium containing 7% fetal bovine serum or ITS-DME medium, as described (20Hafez M. Infante D. Winawer S. Friedman E. Yan Z. Hsu S. Winawer S. Friedman E. Cell Growth Differ. 1990; 1: 617-626PubMed Google Scholar). Binding to 30 μg/ml collagen I-coated, 10 μg/ml fibronectin-coated, or 40 μg/ml laminin-coated 24-well plates was performed exactly as described (19Hafez M. Hsu S. Yan Z. Winawer S. Friedman E. Cell Growth Differ. 1992; 3: 753-762PubMed Google Scholar). pMiKCys encodes the endogenous cellular Ki-ras promoter, exons 1, 2, 3, and 4B, and 4.2 kilobase pairs of the 3′-untranslated sequence. The mini-gene constructs pMiKGly and pMiKVal-12 plasmids (18Kahn S. Yamamoto F. Almoguera C. Winter E. Forrester K. Jordano J. Perucho M. Anticancer Res. 1987; 7: 639-652PubMed Google Scholar) were made from pMiKCys, which was cut by PstI and self-ligated. Into the StuI-NsiI sites of this plasmid was ligated the first exon of Ki-ras amplified by polymerase chain reaction with primers KIUSX and KIDAX from tumors with determined mutations in codon 12 of Ki-ras. AKpnI fragment carrying a lacI-Z gene was ligated into KpnI-SmaI sites of pBluescriptIKs+ (Stratagene) and designated pML1. AKpnI-BamHI fragment of pML1 andXhoI-BamHI fragment of pMClneopoly(A) (Stratagene) containing the neo gene were ligated intoKpnI-XhoI sites of pBluescriptIKs+ and designated pMLN. pMLN was linearized with BssH2 and then cut bySalI to obtain a fragment carrying the neo gene. This was ligated to BssSalI sites of pMiKVal-12and pMiKGly-12 to give plasmids pMLVal-12 and pMLGly-12. These plasmids were transfected into HD6-4 cells by calcium phosphate-mediated transfection followed by osmotic shock and selected in 600 μg/ml G418 in DME medium. pUC EJ 6.6 encoding the mutated human Ha-ras gene cloned from the human EJ bladder carcinoma and pSV2neo encoding the neomycin resistance gene under control of the SV40 late promoter were co-transfected at a ratio of 9:1 by calcium phosphate-mediated transfection followed by osmotic shock and selected in 600 μg/ml G418 in DME medium. Individual clones of Ha-ras and Ki-ras transfectants were isolated. The method is that essentially used previously (22Yan Z. Winawer S. Friedman E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13231-13237Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were cultured in 100-mm dishes until subconfluent and lysed in 0.5 ml of buffer consisting of 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 20 mmMgCl2, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mmNa2P04, pH 7.4, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 mm benzamidine, 10 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. 50 μg of monoclonal antibody Y13-259 was added per mg of protein, and incubation was continued for 1 h. p21 ras ·Y13-259 complexes were precipitated with 60 μl of protein A-Sepharose previously coupled with rabbit anti-rat IgG (Cappel) for 1 h and then washed two times with lysis buffer and 3 × with TBST (25 mm Tris, pH 8, 125 mm NaCl, 0.025% Tween 20) before analysis. For some experiments cells were prelabeled overnight with [35S]methionine (625 μCi/ml, 1220 Ci/mmol). For detection of guanine nucleotides bound to ras, cells had been prelabeled with [32P]orthophosphate and assayed as detailed (22Yan Z. Winawer S. Friedman E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13231-13237Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The method was adapted from Buday and Downward (23Buday L. Downward J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1903-1910Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Cells were cultured 2 days post-plating at 4 × 105/cm2 in 10-cm tissue culture dishes to bring cells into log phase. The medium was then changed to serum-free ITS-DME medium, and cells were cultured overnight. After 1 × wash with PBS, cells were placed in 2.4 ml of permeabilization buffer consisting of 150 mm KCl, 37.5 mm NaCl, 6.25 mm MgCl2, 0.8 mm EGTA, 1 mm CaCl2, 1.25 mm ATP, 12.5 mm PIPES, pH 7.4, and incubated at 37 °C for 10 min. 0.6 ml of 2 international units/ml streptolysin O (Sigma) in permeabilization buffer was then added, and the incubation was continued for 5 min. 15 μCi of [α-32P]GTP (300 Ci/mmol) were added and incubated for 10 min. The buffer was then removed, the cells lysed, and Ras proteins immunoprecipitated as above. Total specific radioactivity associated with immunoprecipitated Ras proteins was detected by a Beckman 2000 counter. Samples were assayed in triplicate. 50 μg of cell lysate (22Yan Z. Winawer S. Friedman E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13231-13237Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) proteins were blotted onto PVDF membranes after separation on 8% SDS-PAGE. The blots were blocked in blocking buffer: 25 mm Tris, pH 8, 125 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20, 4% bovine serum albumin for 1 h at room temperature, incubated for 2 h with a 1:2500 dilution of mouse IgG clone 18 antibody to integrin β1-chain, or 5 μg/ml of the Ki-ras-specific, Ha-ras-specific, or pan-ras antibodies and detected by enhanced chemiluminescence. After SDS-PAGE and blocking as above, tyrosine-phosphorylated erk1 and erk2 and total erk1 and erk2 were detected, respectively, by 1 μg/ml phospho-MAP kinase and 1 μg/ml total MAP kinase antibodies and then detected using the Western blotting detection system provided by the manufacturer: a 1-h incubation at room temperature with 1:1000 dilution of alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibody and 1:1000 dilution of alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-biotin antibody in blocking buffer, followed by a wash, and detection using a 1:500 dilution of CDP-Star for 5 min, followed by autoradiography. Treatment of Ki-ras and Ha-ras transfectants was essentially as described (13Chen G. Oh S. Monia B.P. Stacey D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28259-28265Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Cells were seeded at 2 × 105 per well in 6-well plates. 48 h later the cells were washed with pre-warmed serum-free ITS-DME medium and then incubated in this medium with a fixed ratio of oligonucleotide to Lipofectin (2.4 μl of Lipofectin per 40 pmol of oligonucleotides) for 4 h. The oligonucleotide-containing medium was then replaced with normal growth medium, and growth was continued for 48 h to allow rasturnover plus reduced ras mRNA levels to result in reduced Ras protein level (13Chen G. Oh S. Monia B.P. Stacey D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28259-28265Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Cells were cultured on Costar transwells with 2 ml of medium under the layer and 1.5 ml above the layer for 2 weeks post-confluence with 3 times weekly media changes, fixed, and stained for mucin detection by Alcian blue dye with a nuclear fast red counterstain, exactly as described (20Hafez M. Infante D. Winawer S. Friedman E. Yan Z. Hsu S. Winawer S. Friedman E. Cell Growth Differ. 1990; 1: 617-626PubMed Google Scholar). The method is adapted from one used previously (22Yan Z. Winawer S. Friedman E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13231-13237Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cell lysates in high salt EBC buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 120 mmNaCl, 100 mm NaF, 1% Nonidet P-40, 200 μmsodium orthovanadate, 10 μg/ml each aprotinin and leupeptin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) were boiled in Laemmli sample buffer for 5 min and then electrophoresed in a 7.5% SDS-PAGE gel (0.5 mm thick and 5 cm long) containing 0.5 mg/ml MBP (Sigma). After fixing the gel with four changes of 20% 2-propanol in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, for 2 h, SDS was removed by washing the gel twice for 2 h each in several gel volumes of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 5 mm2-mercaptoethanol. The MBP kinases were then re-denatured with 6m guanidine HCl for 2 h and then renatured by 10 washes of 20 min each in several gel volumes of 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 0.04% Tween 40 and 5 mm2-mercaptoethanol. After preincubation for 1 h with 5 ml of 40 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, containing 2 mm2-mercaptoethanol and 10 mm MgCl2, phosphorylation of MBP within the gel was carried out by incubating the gel at room temperature for 1 h in 5 ml of 40 mmHEPES, pH 8.0, containing 25 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, 40 μm ATP, 0.5 mm EGTA, and 10 mmMgCl2, and then washing the gel in 5% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid containing 1% sodium pyrophosphate several times until the radioactivity reached background levels. Cells were treated with 3 μg/ml tunicamycin for 24 h before lysis. Cell lysates were denatured by boiling in 2% SDS-Laemmli sample loading buffer (24Yan Z. Hsu S. Winawer S. Friedman E. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 801-805PubMed Google Scholar) for 5 min. For digestion with endoglycosidase F, 0.5 units of endoglycosidase F were added after the lysates were made 1% in Nonidet P-40 and 0.1% in SDS and boiled for 5 min. Denaturation by heating at 100 °C in the presence of SDS, but not Nonidet P-40, increases the deglycosylation rate considerably according to the vendor. The lysates were incubated for 36 h before SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis. After washing with PBS, the cells were swollen for 5 min on ice in hypotonic buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 1 mm NaF, 100 μm sodium orthovanadate, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA) containing protease inhibitors exactly as described (25Lee H. Ghose-Dastidar J. Winawer S. Friedman E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5255-5263Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After 20–25 strokes with a Dounce homogenizer on ice, sucrose was added to a final concentration of 0.25 m, and the nuclei were pelleted at 1000 × g for 5 min. The post-nuclear supernatant was layered on top of a 15% sucrose cushion in buffer A and centrifuged at 150,000 × g for 1 h. The sedimentable membrane pellet was suspended in 1% Nonidet P-40 in buffer A, and any Nonidet P-40-insoluble material was removed at 10,000 × g for 60 min. Cells were plated in 6-cm dishes so the majority of cells would be doublets 2 days post-plating, after doubling once. IODO-BEADS (Pierce) were washed twice in freshly prepared PBS, pH 6.5, and dried on filter paper just before using. Cells were rinsed with PBS, pH 6.5, twice, and then 1 ml of PBS, pH 6.5, two washed IODO-BEADS, and 10 μl (1 mCi) of 125I were added per dish. The cells were incubated for 20 min with rotation on an orbital shaker at room temperature. Cells were then washed 3 times with cold PBS and lysates prepared as above. Immunoprecipitations were performed using 5 μg of monoclonal antibody clone P4C10 to 400 μg of cell lysate exactly as described (22Yan Z. Winawer S. Friedman E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13231-13237Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were collected by trypsinization and adjusted to 106/ml, pelleted, resuspended in PBS at this volume, and 0.1 ml (105 cells) was injected in each of 5 male BALB/c nu/nu athymic mice between the shoulder blades. Cells were >99% viable by trypan blue exclusion. Tumor size was measured in two dimensions every 2–3 days using calipers, and volume was calculated as (width)2 × length/2. Sections were fixed in formalin, then processed for routine histology, and stained with either hematoxylin and eosin or Alcian blue with a nuclear fast red counterstain. Transfections of HD6-4 cells were performed with a mini-gene construct of the cellular Ki-ras4B gene mutated at codon 12 to valine (Ki-ras G12V), an expression plasmid encoding a mini-gene construct of the wild-type cellular Ki-ras4B gene, and a cellular Ha-ras G12V expression plasmid. We isolated three independent transfectant clones expressing the Ki-ras2G12V oncogene: 4V, 4V1 and 4V2; three independent transfectant clones expressing the Ha-ras G12V oncogene: H15, H18, and H25; and several independent clones expressing the transfected wild-type Ki-ras4B gene. One of the latter, 4G1, was arbitrarily selected for a control for expression of excess copies of Ki-Ras protein. The transfected oncogenes were expressed as active proteins. Proteins in lysates from the transfected lines were size-fractionated by SDS-PAGE and then transferred to PVDF membrane and analyzed for the presence of Ki-Ras proteins by immunoblotting with a Ki-ras-specific antibody (Fig.1 A, top panel), analyzed for the presence of Ha-Ras proteins by immunoblotting with an Ha-ras specific antibody (Fig. 1 A, second panel), analyzed for the presence of total Ras proteins by immunoblotting with a pan-ras antibody (Fig. 1 A, third panel), and analyzed for Ras proteins mutated at Val-12 by immunoblotting with a pan-ras Val-12 antibody (Fig. 1 A, bottom panel). Cells transfected with mutant Ki-ras (4V1, 4V2, and 4V) expressed elevated levels of Ki-Ras protein, presumably mutant, compared with the other transfectant and parental lines (Fig. 1 A, top panel). Cells transfected with mutant Ha-ras (H15, H18, and H25) expressed elevated levels of Ha-Ras protein, presumably mutant, whereas other transfectant lines and parental cells displayed lower levels of Ha-Ras protein (Fig. 1 A, second panel). All of the transfectants displayed similar levels of total Ras proteins (Fig. 1 A, third panel) suggesting endogenous Ras proteins were down-regulated in the transfectant cells (Fig. 1 A, third panel). Similar levels of total Ras proteins were also observed by immunoprecipitation experiments (data not shown). Each of the three lines transfected with the Ki-ras4BG12V oncogene and each of the three lines transfected with the Ha-ras G12V oncogene expressed mutant Ras proteins, which migrated at the expected mobility for proteins of 21 kDa and at the same position as recombinant mutant Ki-ras Val-12 (Fig. 1 A). No Ras proteins mutated at valine 12 were detected in the parental line or in the Ki-ras4B wild-type control transfectant (Fig. 1 A, bottom panel). To confirm that the 21-kDa protein bearing the Val-12 mutation detected by immunoblotting was indeed ras, Ras proteins were immunoprecipitated from 35S-prelabeled HD6-4 parental cells, wild-type c-Ki-ras 4G1 transfectant cells, and 4V transfectant cells expressing the mutated c-Ki-ras gene (Fig. 1 B). Similar amounts of total Ras proteins were immunoprecipitated from each cell line (data not shown). Immunoprecipitated wild-type and mutant Ki-Ras proteins were transferred to PVDF membrane and analyzed for the presence of mutated Ras proteins by immunoblotting with the pan-ras Val-12 antibody. Only the 4V line expressed Ras proteins mutated to valine at codon 12 (Fig.1 B), confirming the results of the Western blot analysis (Fig. 1 A). The mutant Ras proteins bound elevated levels of GTP showing they were functional. The ratio of GTP/GDP bound to immunoprecipitated Ras proteins was determined by thin layer chromatography"
https://openalex.org/W2029341789,"In Escherichia coli, fatty acid synthesis and degradation are coordinately controlled at the level of transcription by FadR. FadR represses transcription of at least eight genes required for fatty acid transport and β-oxidation and activates transcription of at least two genes required for unsaturated fatty acid biosynthesis and the gene encoding the transcriptional regulator of theaceBAK operon encoding the glyoxylate shunt enzymes, IclR. FadR-dependent DNA binding and transcriptional activation is prevented by long chain fatty acyl-CoA. In the present work, we provide physical and genetic evidence that FadR exists as a homodimer in solution and in vivo. Native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and glycerol gradient ultracentrifugation of the purified protein show that native FadR was a homodimer in solution with an apparent molecular mass of 53.5 and 57.8 kDa, respectively. Dominant negative mutations in fadR were generated by random and site-directed mutagenesis. Each mutation mapped to the amino terminus of the protein (residues 1–66) and resulted in a decrease in DNA binding in vitro. In an effort to separate domains of FadR required for DNA binding, dimerization, and ligand binding, chimeric protein fusions between the DNA binding domain of LexA and different regions of FadR were constructed. One fusion, LexA1–87-FadR102–239, was able to repress the LexA reporter sulA-lacZ, and β-galactosidase activities were derepressed by fatty acids, suggesting that the fusion protein had determinants both for dimerization and ligand binding. These studies support the conclusion that native FadR exists as a stable homo-dimer in solution and that determinants for DNA binding and acyl-CoA binding are found within the amino terminus and carboxyl terminus, respectively.

In all organisms lipid metabolism is tightly regulated to coordinate the cellular requirements for metabolic energy and to maintain the fluidity of cellular membranes. In Escherichia coli the transcription factor FadR plays a pivotal role in regulating the anabolic and catabolic pathways of fatty acid metabolism. FadR specifically represses the transcription of each of the genes that are essential for fatty acid transport and β-oxidation including fadL, fadD, fadE,fadF, fadG, fadBA, and fadH(1DiRusso C.C. Vanderhoek J.Y. Frontiers in Bioactive Lipids. Plenum Press, New York1996: 15-22Crossref Google Scholar, 2DiRusso C.C. Heimert T.L. Metzger A.K. J. Biol.

This transcription factor is required for long term stasis survival, partly through the regulation of expression of theuspA gene, which encodes a universal shock protein (4Farewell A. Diez A.A. DiRusso C.C. Nyström T. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 6443-6450Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). FadR is also an activator of transcription of the fabA andfabB genes, which are required for unsaturated fatty acid biosynthesis (1DiRusso C.C. Vanderhoek J.Y. Frontiers in Bioactive Lipids. Plenum Press, New York1996: 15-22Crossref Google Scholar, 3DiRusso C.C. Metzger A.K. Heimert T.L. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 7: 311-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) and of the gene encoding the regulatory protein IclR, which in turn represses the expression of the aceBAKoperon encoding the glyoxylate shunt enzymes (5Gui L.A. Sunnarborg A. LaPorte D.C. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 4704-4709Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The growth ofE. coli in minimal medium containing long chain fatty acids (C14–C18) results in derepression of the genes negatively controlled by FadR and in a decrease in the expression of the genes activated by FadR (2DiRusso C.C. Heimert T.L. Metzger A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8685-8691Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3DiRusso C.C. Metzger A.K. Heimert T.L. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 7: 311-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). It has been demonstrated in vitro that FadR binds to DNA and that this interaction is specifically prevented by long chain fatty acyl-CoA (2DiRusso C.C. Heimert T.L. Metzger A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8685-8691Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Raman N. DiRusso C.C. J. Biol.

Cell. 1992; 70: 671-679Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Previously, we estimated the native molecular mass of FadR to be 29 kDa using gel filtration chromatography, suggesting that this protein is a monomer in solution, since the molecular mass predicted from the DNA sequence is 26,972 Da (2DiRusso C.C. Heimert T.L. Metzger A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8685-8691Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8DiRusso C.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 7995-8009Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). However, two lines of evidence argue that FadR interacts with its DNA binding sites as a multimer: (i) dyad symmetry in the operator regions of target genes, a feature commonly observed in transcriptional regulators that bind to their respective operators as homomultimers, (9Pabo C.O. Sauer R.T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1984; 53: 293-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (1019) Google Scholar) and (ii) the identification of a potential helix-turn-helix (H-T-H) 1The abbreviations used are: H-T-H, helix-turn-helix; X-gal, 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl β-d-galactopyranoside. 1The abbreviations used are: H-T-H, helix-turn-helix; X-gal, 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl β-d-galactopyranoside. motif (between amino acid residues 34 and 54) in the amino-terminal region of FadR, a motif most commonly observed in homodimeric or homotetrameric prokaryotic DNA-binding proteins (8DiRusso C.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 7995-8009Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 9Pabo C.O. Sauer R.T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1984; 53: 293-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (1019) Google Scholar). While many transcriptional regulators may be stable homomultimers in solution, for others dimerization in solution may be required for DNA binding or, in other cases, dimerization may occur on the DNA (10Kim B. Little J.W. Science. 1992; 255: 203-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 11Jo Y.-L. Nara F. Ichihara S. Mizuno S. Mizishima S. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 15253-15256Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). In the latter two situations, dimerization may be limiting for DNA binding. In this work, we reassessed the native molecular weight in solution using purified FadR by nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and glycerol gradient ultracentrifugation to determine whether dimerization may be limiting for DNA binding. The results of these experiments support that dimerization is not limiting for DNA binding. We also identified fadR alleles which exhibited a dominant negative phenotype (fadR − d ). These altered alleles were expected to have mutations within the putative DNA binding domain that would decrease DNA binding but not multimerization (12Isackson P.J. Bertrand K.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 6226-6230Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 13Kelley R.L. Yanofsky C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 483-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 14Kleina L.G. Miller J.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 212: 295-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Four such alleles were identified after hydroxylamine mutagenesis of fadR, and the changes were localized to amino acid residues Ala9, Arg35, His65, and Gly66. Furthermore, alanine scanning mutagenesis within and adjacent to the putative H-T-H motif identified five additionalfadR − d mutations. The amino acid substitutions in these mutations were localized to Arg35, Arg49, His65, Gly66, and Lys67, thus confirming the importance of the three amino acid residues Arg35, His65, and Gly66 identified by hydroxylamine mutagenesis. To further distinguish functional domains of FadR, chimeric fusions between the amino-terminal DNA binding domain of LexA and different portions of FadR were constructed and analyzed. Our results indicate that a fragment of FadR including amino acid residues 102–239 contains determinants for dimerization and ligand binding. The E. colistrains used were: JM109 for propagation of pSELECT-1 derived phagemids (15Yanisch-Peron C. Veira J. Messing J. Gene (Amst.). 1985; 33: 103Crossref PubMed Scopus (11458) Google Scholar), LS1085 for plasmid isolations (3DiRusso C.C. Metzger A.K. Heimert T.L. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 7: 311-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), LS1155 (fadR fadB-lacZ) to assess β-galactosidase activity in response to plasmid encoded wild-type or mutant FadR (3DiRusso C.C. Metzger A.K. Heimert T.L. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 7: 311-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), LS1154 (fadB-lacZ) to test negative transdominance (3DiRusso C.C. Metzger A.K. Heimert T.L. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 7: 311-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), BL21(lDE3)/pLysS for controlled expression of FadR (16Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendroff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (6003) Google Scholar), and JL1436 to assess β-galactosidase activity in response to plasmid encoded wild-type LexA or chimeric LexA-FadR fusions (17Lin L.L. Little J.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 210: 439-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). For biochemical assays cells were routinely grown in Tryptone broth (18Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972Google Scholar). Where necessary to maintain plasmids, antibiotics were added to a final concentration of 100 μg/ml ampicillin, 40 μg/ml kanamycin, or 12.5 μg/ml chloramphenicol. The minimal medium used was medium E (18Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972Google Scholar). Fatty acids were provided at 5 mm in 0.5% Brij-58. Liquid cultures were grown at 37 °C with shaking in a New Brunswick gyratory incubator. Bacterial growth was monitored in a Klett Summerson colorimeter equipped with a blue filter. Chemical mutagenesis of wild-type FadR encoded within pCD126 using hydroxylamine was described previously (6Raman N. DiRusso C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1092-1097Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The mutagenized DNA was transformed into LS1155, and transformants were tested for β-galactosidase activity on Tryptone broth plates containing ampicillin and X-gal (40 μg/ml). Plasmids which conferred high levels of β-galactosidase were isolated and transformed into LS1154 to test for negative transdominance. Alanine substitutions in FadR were constructed using the Altered Sites System® (Promega) as described previously (6Raman N. DiRusso C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1092-1097Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The wild-type template was single-stranded pCD152. Mutagenic oligonucleotides (21–27 nucleotides in length) carried an alanine codon in place of the targeted native codon as the central residues. Plasmids encoding the mutation of interest were identified by sequencing. For phenotypic analysis of the mutants, a HinDIII-BamHI fragment was removed from the pCD152 derivative and subcloned to pACYC177 (19Chang A.C.Y. Cohen S.N. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 134: 1141-1156Crossref Google Scholar). The resulting plasmids were tested for FadR function in LS1155 and for the dominant negative phenotype in LS1154. For the overexpression of wild-type and alteredfadR proteins, the T7 system of Studier was used as previously detailed (2DiRusso C.C. Heimert T.L. Metzger A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8685-8691Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Final cell extracts were maintained in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm dithiothreitol containing 50% glycerol. Samples were stored in 100-μl aliquots at −80 °C (crude preparations). Purified FadR was prepared as described elsewhere (2DiRusso C.C. Heimert T.L. Metzger A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8685-8691Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). DNA binding affinity of wild-type or mutant FadR was assessed using the standard gel shift assay (2DiRusso C.C. Heimert T.L. Metzger A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8685-8691Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For the characterization of binding to OB, the 377-base pairHinDIII-EcoRI fragment from pCD154 containing thefadB promoter was used (2DiRusso C.C. Heimert T.L. Metzger A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8685-8691Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Antibodies were produced against purified FadR in an egg-laying hen by East Acre Biologicals (Southbridge, MA). Antisera was screened for FadR-specific antibody production using immunoblots (20Burnette W.N. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 112: 195-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (5906) Google Scholar). When specific, high titer antigen recognition was achieved, eggs were collected, and IgY was prepared. Partial purification of the antibody preparation from the egg yolks was achieved by a modification of Bade and Stegemann (21Bade H. Stegeman H. J. Immunol. Methods. 1984; 72: 421-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) as follows. Six yolks were separated from the egg white and rinsed with glass-distilled water, and the yolks were combined and scrambled in a 1-liter beaker using a Teflon-coated stir bar and magnetic stir plate on medium speed. Cold isopropyl alcohol (−20 °C, 600 ml) was slowly added and the mixture was stirred on ice for 5 min. The precipitated protein was collected by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. The isopropanol extraction was repeated two additional times followed by three extractions with 600 ml of cold acetone (−20 °C). The final acetone precipitate was dried under a gentle stream of air and stored at −80 °C as a pellet or at 4 °C after resuspension in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.01% sodium azide (10 ml/yolk). Immunoblotting of cell extracts prepared as described above was performed essentially as described in Burnette (20Burnette W.N. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 112: 195-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (5906) Google Scholar). Following resolution on a 15% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel, proteins were electroeluted to Zetaprob (Bio-Rad). The blots were pretreated for 1 h with 5% calf serum in Tris-buffered saline (pH 7.5) and then for 1 h with anti-FadR or preimmune sera. The blots were washed and then treated with goat anti-chicken IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Capel Laboratories). Following a series of washes with Tris-buffered saline, the blots were developed using 3,3′-diaminobenzidine and H2O2 as specified by the supplier. The native molecular mass of FadR was evaluated using nondenaturing electrophoresis (23Bryan J.K. Anal. Biochem. 1977; 78: 513-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 24Davis B.J. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1964; 121: 404-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (15954) Google Scholar). Standards used were carbonic anhydrase (29 kDa), chicken egg albumin (45 kDa), and bovine serum albumin (monomer, 66 kDa, and dimer, 132 kDa). Protein standards (10 μg) and purified FadR (10 μg) in 1 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, and 50 mm NaCl were electrophoresed on a set of nondenaturing gels with polyacrylamide concentrations of 7.5, 10, or 12.5%. The distance of protein migration relative to the distance of migration of the tracking dye bromphenol blue (R F value) was calculated from a scan made using an NIH image analysis system. A value of 100(log(R F × 100)) for each protein was plotted against the percent concentration of acrylamide and the slope of the line (i.e. the retardation coefficient,K R ) was determined. The negative slopes obtained for each protein were then plotted against the native molecular masses of the standards to produce a linear log/log plot from which the molecular mass of FadR was extrapolated. Glycerol density gradient sedimentation assay developed by Martin and Ames (25Martin R. Ames B. J. Biol. Chem. 1961; 236: 1372-1379Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was used to define the native molecular mass of FadR. Protein standards (100 μg) and pure FadR (25 μg) were layered on the top of a 5–25% glycerol gradient in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 100 mm KCl, 4 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.2 mm EDTA, which was spun at 32,000 rpm at 4 °C for 32 h in a SW41 Ti rotor in a Beckman L8-M ultracentrifuge. Following centrifugation fractions were collected under gravity flow. Quantification of the protein in each fraction was determined by Bradford (26Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (215653) Google Scholar) assay. A 1-kilobase pairEcoRI-HinDIII fragment was subcloned from pJWL184 (22Lin L.L. Little J.W. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 170: 2163-2173Crossref Google Scholar) to pSELECT-1 to generate pCD170. Using pCD170 as a template,lexA-specific oligonucleotides (19–24 bases in length) were synthesized to engineer either NdeI or NcoI sites at amino acid 88 to generate pCD171 and pCD172, respectively. A 1.3-kilobase pair HinDIII-EcoRI fragment encoding FadR was subcloned from CD1901 (8DiRusso C.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 7995-8009Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) to pSELECT-1 to generate pCD152R. Using pCD152R as a template fadR-specific oligonucleotides (19–24 bases in length) were synthesized to engineer either NdeI sites at amino acid positions 81, 100, 120, or 167 to generate pCDR307-1, -4, -5, or -3, respectively, or anNcoI site at amino acid 140 to generate pCDR307-2. AnEcoRI-NdeI fragment from pCD171 was then fused in frame with NdeI-BamHI fragments from pCDR307-1, -4, -5, -3, and ligated into pUC18 vector to generate pCD205 (LexA1–87 HM FadR83–239), pCD208 (LexA1–87 HM FadR102–239), pCD209 (LexA1–87 HM FadR122–239), and pCD207 (LexA1–87 HM FadR167–239), respectively. AnEcoRI-NcoI fragment from pCD172 was fused in frame with NcoI-BamHI fragment from pCDR 307-2 and ligated into pUC18 vector to generate pCD206 (LexA1–87HM FadR142–239). The resulting chimeric plasmids were sequenced across the fusion juncture to confirm the in-frame fusions. The expression of all the fusion proteins was driven off the isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside-inducible promoter (lacUV5) (15Yanisch-Peron C. Veira J. Messing J. Gene (Amst.). 1985; 33: 103Crossref PubMed Scopus (11458) Google Scholar). β-Galactosidase activities in strains LS1154, LS1155, or JL1436 harboring the plasmid of interest were assayed as described by Miller (18Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972Google Scholar). DNA was sequenced using Sequenase V 2.0 and a reagent kit purchased from U. S. Biochemical Corp. (Cleveland, OH). Restriction enzymes, T4 DNA ligase, T4 DNA polymerase, and Sequenase V 2.0 were purchased from U.S. Biochemical Corp., α-35S-dATP was purchased from DuPont NEN. Fatty acids and molecular mass markers were obtained from Sigma. In previous work the native molecular mass of FadR was estimated to be 29 kDa using gel filtration chromatography which is close to the calculated monomeric molecular weight 26,972 from the DNA sequence (8DiRusso C.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 7995-8009Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). However, we predicted the native form of FadR is a multimer because (i) the binding sites for FadR have dyad character (1DiRusso C.C. Vanderhoek J.Y. Frontiers in Bioactive Lipids. Plenum Press, New York1996: 15-22Crossref Google Scholar), (ii) the protein is predicted to bind DNA through an H-T-H motif (8DiRusso C.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 7995-8009Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 27Haydon D.J. Guest J.R. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1991; 79: 291-296Crossref Scopus (194) Google Scholar), and (iii) as reported here, specific mutations confer a dominant negative phenotype. Since gel filtration chromatography can sometimes lead to aberrant estimates of native molecular (e.g. due to nonspecific interactions between the protein and the gel matrix) (28Scopes R.K. Protein Purification Principles and Practice. 2nd Ed. Springer-Verlag New York, 1987Crossref Google Scholar), we have reexamined the native molecular weight of FadR using two independent methods: nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and glycerol gradient ultracentrifugation. Analysis of purified FadR using nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis estimated the native molecular mass of this protein was 53.5 kDa (Fig. 1 A). Using glycerol gradient ultracentrifugation, the native molecular mass was estimated to be 57.8 kDa (Fig. 1 B). These data support the conclusion that FadR exists as a stable homodimer in solution. On the basis of these data and because of the dyad character of the binding sites, we propose FadR interacts with DNA as a homodimer. We performed hydroxylamine mutagenesis of wild-type fadR encoded within the moderate copy number vector, pACYC177 (6Raman N. DiRusso C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1092-1097Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). A pool of mutagenized DNA was transformed into LS1155 (fadR fadB-lacZ) and selected on plates containing ampicillin and X-gal. Colonies that appeared dark blue had high levels of β-galactosidase. Plasmid DNA was isolated from those colonies, and the fadR alleles encoded within the plasmids were then tested for the ability to confer a dominant negative phenotype over wild-type FadR in strain LS1154 (fadB-lacZ). Those mutant alleles induced by treatment of plasmid DNA with hydroxylamine, which resulted in at least a 3-fold increase in β-galactosidase activities in LS1154, were designatedfadR − d (TableI). Alleles that fulfilled this criterion had one of the following amino acid changes: A9V, R35C, H65Y, G66D, or G66S. Each of the substitutions were localized to the amino terminus of FadR; however, only one residue, Arg35, resides within the putative H-T-H motif (8DiRusso C.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 7995-8009Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). To further test the importance of other amino acid residues within and adjacent to the predicted H-T-H motif, we constructed a series of fadR alleles carrying substitutions of alanine.Table ITransdominance of altered FadR proteins generated by hydroxylamine mutagenesis of wild-type FadRPlasmidAmino acidCodonβ-Galactosidase activity1-aThe results are the averages of three separate experiments each assayed in triplicate.Negative dominance1-bDominance determined by dividing the value obtained for the strain carrying the plasmid encoded mutant allele by same strain carrying the vector pACYC177.NativeSubstitutedNativeSubstitutednmol min −1 mg −1pACYC177NR1-cNot relevant, vector control.110 (24)1-dNumber in parentheses indicates standard error.1.0pCD126Wild type101 (36)0.9pRW5Ala9ValGCGGTG508 (83)4.6pRW9Gly66AspGGCGAC481 (50)4.4pRW12Gly66SerGGCAGC646 (65)5.9pRW17His65TyrCATTAT410 (40)3.7pRW20Arg35CysCGTTGT607 (47)5.51-a The results are the averages of three separate experiments each assayed in triplicate.1-b Dominance determined by dividing the value obtained for the strain carrying the plasmid encoded mutant allele by same strain carrying the vector pACYC177.1-c Not relevant, vector control.1-d Number in parentheses indicates standard error. Open table in a new tab As above, each of these alleles substituted with alanine were tested for repressor function in strain LS1155 (fadR fadB-lacZ) (Fig. 2). The fadR alleles that showed constitutive levels of β-galactosidase were subsequently tested for negative transdominance in strain LS1154 (TableII). Substitution of alanine for residue Arg35, like the substitution with cysteine induced by hydroxylamine mutagenesis, resulted in a 5-fold dominance. Therefore we suggest that this amino acid is critical for DNA binding of FadR to OB, the FadR binding site within the fadBpromoter. Additional residues that appeared to be important for regulation of fadB included Arg49, His65, Gly66, and Lys67, each of which resulted in levels approximately 3-fold higher when substituted with alanine. The fadR alleles with alanine substitutions at Glu34, Leu37, Arg45, Leu48, Arg54, Trp60, Ile63, and Thr69 showed slightly elevated levels (1.4–2-fold) with respect to the control.Table IINegative dominance of FadR alleles carrying alanine substitutions to wild-type FadR in strain LS1154, fadB-lacZPlasmid encoded FadR allele2-aNone indicates values obtained for transformants carrying the vector pACYC177.

Open table in a new tab To test whether or not thefadR − d isolates described above, including A9V, R35C, H65Y, G66D, and G66S, were able to bind to DNA, we subcloned the mutant genes into the φT7 RNA polymerase expression plasmid, pT7-5, so that FadR was produced as the major protein after induction of T7 RNA polymerase. Fig.3 A represents a Coomassie Blue-stained 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel of extracts of the cells after FadR induction. There was no discernible difference in the amount of protein produced in the mutants compared with the wild type. To verify that the major protein band was FadR, antibodies generated against purified FadR were used to probe an immunoblot of a duplicate gel (Fig.3 B). The specificity of the antibody preparation was demonstrated by reacting preimmune antisera or immune antisera against extracts from strain BL21(λDE3) carrying pT7-5 (vector) or pCD129 (fadR +) (data not shown). The concentration of FadR in the crude extracts was estimated to be to be 3 × 10−6m by comparing the FadR band in the crude extract with a standard concentration of purified FadR on a Coomassie Blue-stained polyacrylamide gel (protein concentration was compared as band intensity using a Millipore BioImage analysis system). Each of the extracts was used to test binding to fadB DNA using the gel shift assay and a DNA fragment carrying OB(2DiRusso C.C. Heimert T.L. Metzger A.K. J. Biol.

MalR belongs to the LacI-GalR family of transcription repressors. The protein binds specifically to two operator sequences in the intergenic region between these operons. The affinity of MalR for the malMP binding sequence is higher than for the malXCD site. Results obtained in vivo using transcriptional fusions with reporter genes indicate low repression level of malXCD by MalR when compared withmalMP. This behavior may be correlated with the existence of separate induction pathways for maltose, maltotriose, and maltotetraose. The similarities found at the operator sequences and binding domains for MalR and enterococcal repressor proteins suggest that the pneumococcal maltosaccharide regulation system is closely related to several Gram-negative metabolic pathways, but not to the structurally similar Escherichia coli maltose regulon.

The similarities found at the operator sequences and binding domains for MalR and enterococcal repressor proteins suggest that the pneumococcal maltosaccharide regulation system is closely related to several Gram-negative metabolic pathways, but not to the structurally similar Escherichia coli maltose regulon. Bacterial regulons are often arranged as a network of genes or operons coordinately triggered by a DNA-binding protein, which interacts with the inducer molecule. Transcriptional control of gene expression would be expected to have evolved to optimize the performance of specific functions in response to nutritional and environmental changes. However several findings suggest that regulatory genes may have evolved relatively independently from the target genes (1de Lorenzo V. Pérez Martı́n J. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 19: 1177-1184Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 2Puyet A. World J. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 1993; 9: 455-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). The bacterial maltosaccharide regulon may represent a paradigm of independent evolution of the regulatory and metabolic genes. This regulon contains several genetic regions encoding peptides needed for the uptake and metabolism of maltosaccharides (3Schwartz M. Neidhart F.C. Ingraham J.L. Low K.B. Magasanik B. Schaechter M. Umbarger H.E. The Maltose Regulon: Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C1987Google Scholar). Coordinated expression of the mal operons requires the synthesis and induction of a transcriptional activator, MalT, which is directly controlled by maltosaccharides and by the cAMP-CAP system (4Ebright R.H. Busby S. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1995; 5: 197-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 5Chapon C. J. Bacteriol. 1982; 150: 722-729Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Maltose/maltodextrin regulons have also been found in, at least, two Gram-positive bacteria, namely Streptococcus pneumoniae (6Puyet A. Espinosa M. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 230: 800-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) and Streptomyces coelicolor (7Van Wezel G.P. White J. Young P. Postma P.W. Bibb M.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 23: 537-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Although all three systems display structural and genetic similarities suggesting a common evolutionary origin, transcriptional regulation for these regulons in the Gram-positive bacteria appears to be attained by a repressor protein unrelated to MalT. This work is focused on the transcriptional control of the streptococcal mal regulon. The maltosaccharide regulon of S. pneumoniae is organized in three operons (see Fig. 1 A). Two operons are transcribed in opposite orientation: (i) malXCD, whose products were proposed to be involved in the uptake of maltotetraose (6Puyet A. Espinosa M. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 230: 800-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), and (ii)malMP, which encodes enzymes involved in the metabolism of maltosaccharides: amylomaltase (MalM), essential for growth on maltose, and the maltodextrin phosphorylase MalP (8Lacks S.A. Genetics. 1968; 60: 685-706Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Weinrauch Y. Lacks S.A. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1981; 183: 7-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The gene products of these two operons share structural similarities with their enterococcal counterparts, which are located in the malEFG and themalPQ operons, respectively (6Puyet A. Espinosa M. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 230: 800-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 10Gilson E. Saurin W. Perrin D. Bachellier S. Hofnung M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 1375-1383Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The third operon,malAR, is located 345 bp 1The abbreviations used are: bp, base pair(s); PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; IPTG, isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. downstream from genemalD, and its products are involved in the global regulation of the pneumococcal mal operons. MalR has been shown to be the maltosaccharide pathway negative effector. Pioneer genetic work in the MAL locus (8Lacks S.A. Genetics. 1968; 60: 685-706Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), led to the isolation of several mutants yielding constitutive and noninducible expression of malM. These mutations were located in a region proximal to malD. In addition, integrative mutations in the malR gene resulted in constitutive expression of malM, denoting that the product of malR is involved at least in malM repression (11Puyet A. Ibáñez A.M. Espinosa M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25402-25408Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The 36.9-kDa product of malR belongs to the LacI-GalR family of transcriptional repressors, and it was suggested to bind to an intergenic region located between the malXCD and themalMP operons repressing both operons (11Puyet A. Ibáñez A.M. Espinosa M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25402-25408Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Stassi D.L. Dunn J.J. Lacks S.A. Gene (Amst .). 1982; 20: 359-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). GenemalA encodes a protein of 25 kDa, which could be identified using E. coli cell extracts for in vitrotranscription-translation (11Puyet A. Ibáñez A.M. Espinosa M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25402-25408Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mutants in malA are unable to grow in maltodextrin as the only carbon source; however, the precise function of the protein is not known yet. Data collected on the streptococcal system suggest a more sophisticated regulation of maltosaccharide utilization. Short chain molecules like maltose and maltotriose may use an uptake pathway independent of malXCD(6Puyet A. Espinosa M. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 230: 800-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 8Lacks S.A. Genetics. 1968; 60: 685-706Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, malM and malP may be required for metabolization of all maltosaccharides. If this is the case, regulation of malXCD and malMP may not be necessarily coupled. To gain knowledge on the relationship between MalR and other bacterial repressor proteins, we have analyzed its DNA binding activity and role in the maltosaccharide pathway regulation. In the present work, we have purified MalR and determined the MalR binding capacity to its cognate DNA. We have defined the DNA sequences to which MalR binds (themalR operators) within the maltose/maltodextrin operons ofS. pneumoniae. The operators overlap the expression signals for both the malXCD and the malMP operons. Maltose inhibited the binding of MalR protein to its target, indicating that this sugar acts as the positive effector of the maloperons. The MalR binding activity matched with its repression function, as shown through transcriptional fusions with β-galactosidase and luciferase in E. coli cells, showing different binding properties for malXCD andmalMP. Overexpression of themalR gene was performed in E. coli BL21(DE3) using the pET5-derived plasmid pAPM60, which contains anKpnI-EcoRI fragment from pAPM34 (11Puyet A. Ibáñez A.M. Espinosa M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25402-25408Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Plasmid pLS70 harbors a PstI 3.5-kilobase fragment of the S. pneumoniae maltose region cloned into the streptococcal plasmid pMV158 (13Stassi D.L. López P. Espinosa M. Lacks S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 7028-7032Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Plasmid pQF120 (14Ronald S.L. Koprinski A.M. Farinha M.A. Gene (Amst .). 1990; 90: 145-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) harbors two promoterless divergent reporter genes for β-galactosidase and luciferase. Plasmid pRep4 carries the lacI gene in a plasmid p15A-derived replicon (Quiagen). The recombinant plasmid pQFXM derives from pQF120 by cloning the 674-bp NheI-Sau3AI fragment from pLS70 in theBglII-XbaI of the vector. pVLTMR was constructed by the subcloning of the BglII-RsaI fragment from plasmid pAMP60 (see Fig. 1) containing a promoterless malRgene, into the expression vector pVLT31 (15de Lorenzo V. Eltis L. Kessler B. Timmis K. Gene (Amst .). 1993; 123: 17-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). This construction placesmalR under the control of the IPTG-inducible tacpromoter. E. coliwas grown on LB medium and transformed by electroporation, as described (16Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. SambrooK J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 1.75Google Scholar), using 25 microfarads, 2.5 kV, and 200 Ω. Transformants were selected on agar medium with ampicillin (100 μg/ml), kanamycin (25 μg/ml), or tetracycline (15 μg/ml). The entire nucleotide sequence of the NheI-Sau3AI fragment, contained in the recombinants pQFXM, was determined by automated sequencer equipment (Applied Biosystems 377) and the dye-deoxyterminator procedure. The method was performed as described previously (11Puyet A. Ibáñez A.M. Espinosa M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25402-25408Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) except that the buffer B was supplemented with 1 m NaCl. After selective precipitation of MalR at low ionic strength (salting out) and solubilization in buffer B, 400 μl of the soluble fraction was passed through an agarose column (Bio-Gel A-0.5m, Bio-Rad) with a bed volume of 39 ml, and the flow rate was set at 6 ml/h. Fractions (500 μl) were collected and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE). The selected fractions were pooled and stored at −80 °C. MalR protein retained its activity for at least 1 year. The following four oligonucleotides were synthesized and used in the PCR amplifications to obtain DNA template for the binding assays: oligonucleotide 1, 5′-gtgtaacagttccaagcaccg-3′; oligonucleotide 2, 5′-tccgattccgtaagctcctgg-3′; oligonucleotide 3, 5′-gggattagaaccagggaggta-3′; oligonucleotide 4, 5′-tacctccctggttctaatccc-3′. The fragments XM, X, and M were obtained after PCR amplification for 20 cycles using as template the NheI-Sau3AI 674-bp fragment of pLS70. For hydroxyl radical interference analysis the PCR was carried out after 5′ labeling of one of the primers with32P-γATP and polynucleotide kinase (41Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 11.31-11.32Google Scholar). For gel retardation experiments PCR products were uniformly labeled with a mixture of 70 μm dNTP and 30 μCi of [α-32P]dCTP. DNA binding reactions were performed in buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 1 mm EDTA, 400 mm NaCl, and 10% glycerol. Purified MalR protein was mixed (100–200 ng) with 32P-labeled DNA (1 ng) and 0.5–1.0 μg of poly(dI-dC) and incubated 30 min on ice. Free and bound DNAs were separated on 5% polyacrylamide native gels (30:0.8 bisacrylamide cast in 0.5 × TBE; TBE is 89 mm Tris borate and 2 mm EDTA). The hydroxyl-radical interference assay was performed as described (17Hayes J.J. Tullius T.D. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 9521-9527Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 18Rojo F. Salas M. Methods Mol. Genet. Academic Press, 1995: 6Google Scholar). Single strand terminally labeled DNA fragments were treated with the hydroxyl radical reagents (19Tullius T.D. Dombroski B.A. Churchill M.E.A. Kam L. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 155: 537-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar), except that the concentration was increased 5 or 10 times. Chemicals were purchased to Sigma or Merck. Treated DNA (100 ng) were incubated with MalR (20 μg), in a final volume of 100 μl. Bound DNA was separated from free DNA by nondenaturing PAGE, eluted in a solution 0.5 m ammonium acetate, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 0.1% SDS, and analyzed by electrophoresis in denaturing 8% polyacrylamide gels. Maxam and Gilbert (20Maxam A.M. Gilbert W. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 65: 499-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (9015) Google Scholar) sequencing reactions were run in parallel. Bacterial cultures were grown until an absorbance (A 600) of 0.3, and 0.7 mm of IPTG was added, to induce MalR expression. Cultures were incubated for 2 h at 37 °C. After this time, β-galactosidase and luciferase activities were determined. β-Galactosidase activity was assayed as described (21Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972Google Scholar). Three independent transformants were used to determine each value. Luciferase activity was assayed as reported (22Owen-Hughes H. Pavitt G.H. Santos D.S. Sidebotham J.M. Hulton S.J. Hinton J.C.D. Higgins C.F. Cell. 1992; 71: 255-265Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). To purify themalR gene product, the plasmid pAPM60 (schematized in Fig.1 A) was transferred toE. coli BL21(DE3), and the malR gene was overexpressed by addition of IPTG. Previous efforts for the purification of MalR (11Puyet A. Ibáñez A.M. Espinosa M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25402-25408Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) indicated that a large fraction of the protein was insoluble. Attempts to purify the protein following the method reported for RhaS (23Egan S.M. Schleif R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 243: 821-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) were unsuccessful. For these reasons, the purification procedure was modified to include a step in which the ionic strength was increased to 1 m NaCl. The MalR-soluble fraction was passed through a gel filtration column as an additional purification step, after which the protein was estimated to be about 95% pure, as judged from polyacrylamide-SDS stained gels (Fig.1 B). Preliminary results of the elution profile suggested that, under the conditions used, MalR protein eluted as a mixture of 40% monomers and 60% dimers (not shown). To define the region to which MalR binds, we first performed specific DNA fragment missing assays. To this end, we made use of plasmid pLS70, in which a 3.5-kilobase PstI chromosomal fragment containing part of the S. pneumoniae mal operons is cloned (Fig.1 A) (13Stassi D.L. López P. Espinosa M. Lacks S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 7028-7032Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The chromosomal region cloned in pLS70 includes a 674-bp NheI-Sau3AI fragment (Fig. 1 Aand 2), which contains the divergent promoter regions for the malXCD and the malMPoperons. The 9-kilobase pair plasmid pLS70 DNA was digested withNheI and Sau3AI, yielding 14 fragments ranging from 2,583 bp to 12 bp, and the digestion products were incubated with increasing concentrations of MalR. Protein/DNA mixtures were loaded on agarose native gels, and the DNA fragments were stained with ethidium bromide and visualized under UV light. The results showed that upon addition of increasing amounts of MalR, only the 674-bp fragment was specifically retarded by the protein, whereas the electrophoretic mobility of the other fragments was unaffected (Fig.3). The retarded fragment appears to migrate as a faint smear near a position corresponding to 1.8 kilobases in the polyacrylamide gel. We conclude that purified MalR protein exhibits specific binding on the DNA fragment that contains its putative target sites. The MalR binding sites within the 674-bpNheI-Sau3AI fragment were defined by band-shift assays. To this end, four oligonucleotides were designed (see Fig. 2) and used as primers to amplify different regions within theNheI-Sau3AI fragment. The DNA obtained was uniformly labeled with [α-32P]dCTP, incubated with MalR, and the protein-DNA complexes were visualized after electrophoresis on native polyacrylamide gels and autoradiography. The results (Fig. 4) showed that the addition of MalR protein retarded the large XM fragment containing both divergent promoters Pm and Px (amplified with oligonucleotides 1 and 2). A band shift was also observed with X (amplified with oligonucleotides 1 and 3) and M (amplified with oligonucleotides 2 and 4) DNA fragments, containing only one of the promoter regions, either Px or Pm, respectively. Optimal conditions for binding quantification were found when 150 ng of MalR and 1 μg of competitor DNA were added to the assay. Under these conditions, binding was specific for both the X and M fragments. The addition of larger amounts of protein led to the appearance of nonsoluble aggregates at the gel wells (Fig. 4, lanes 3 and4). It was also apparent that the binding affinity of the protein was stronger for both the XM and M fragments than for the X fragment. Estimation of the MalR binding affinity by quantitation of the radioactivity bound to the different bands indicated that the percent of DNA bound was 60, 39, and 12% at saturation for, respectively, XM, M, and X fragments. These results suggest a differential recognition of MalR to the operator/promoter sequences, being much stronger for the fragment harboring the two promoters than for fragments carrying only one promoter. In addition, it appears that the affinity of MalR for promoter Pm is higher than forPx.Figure 4Band-shift experiments are shown for fragments containing the expression signals for both operons (panel XM) or for either malX,malC, malD (panel X) ormalM, malP (panel M), respectively. In lanes 1–3, approximately 40 ng of MalR were added to the mixtures in presence of 0.2, 0.5, or 1 μg of poly(dI-dC) competitor, respectively. In lanes 4–6, 60 ng of MalR were used and 0.2, 0.5, or 1 μg of poly(dI-dC). Lane 7 is a control in which only DNA was loaded. TheNheI-Sau3AI fragment used as template in the PCR reactions is schematized in the lower part of the figure. The oligonucleotide used in the annealing step in the three different amplifications are indicated by numbered arrows.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To determine the MalR recognition sequences in each of the above DNA fragments, hydroxyl radical interference analysis was performed. Hydroxyl radical-treated DNA was incubated with MalR, and free and bound DNA were separated by nondenaturing PAGE and eluted and analyzed in denaturing PAGE. Fig. 5 shows the regions protected by MalR on the short fragments carrying either the promoter/operator sequences of malX or malM. A protected region corresponding to a 15-bp imperfect palindrome was located 47 bp upstream of the initiation codon for malM. A similar 14-bp sequence was also protected by MalR 44 bp upstream of the start codon for malX. In the hydroxyl radical interference experiments using the whole XM fragment, only the malMbinding sequence was protected by MalR (not shown). No protection was detected at the malX binding site, probably due to the competition of the higher affinity malM site for MalR. The analysis of the consensus sequence for the binding of MalR on the operator/promoter region of malX and of malMrevealed some differences, the major mismatch being located at the 3′-end (Fig. 5). The change observed could explain the differential affinity of MalR and may define the optimal consensus sequence for the repressor. Physiological studies with S. pneumoniae cells grown in maltose as a carbon source showed that, in the presence of this sugar, the maltose/maltodextrin operon is derepressed (6Puyet A. Espinosa M. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 230: 800-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 8Lacks S.A. Genetics. 1968; 60: 685-706Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Puyet A. Ibáñez A.M. Espinosa M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25402-25408Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This suggests that maltose is one of the inducers of maltose/maltodextrin metabolism in this Gram-positive bacteria. Therefore we should expect that the affinity of MalR protein to DNA should be abolished in vitrowhen maltose is present in the assay. Indeed, the MalR band-shift assays shown in Fig. 6 indicate that the MalR DNA binding is dramatically reduced in the presence of maltose. It is worth pointing out that maltotriose or maltotetraose did not affect significantly the binding ability of MalR to its target DNA (data not shown). To test the differential affinity of MalR to thePm or Px regions in vivo, we constructed the plasmid pQFXM which contains transcriptional fusions ofmalX and malM to the lacZ andluxAB reporter genes respectively. MalR was providedin trans by plasmid pVLTMR (Fig.7). This plasmid could only be transferred to E. coli JM109 when this strain harbors pRep4, which overexpresses the lacI gene. This is probably due to a toxic effect of MalR expression in E. coli. To determine the effect of MalR on the expression of reporter genes, the strain JM109/pRep4, containing the pQFXM vector, was transformed with the plasmids pVLT31 or pVLTMR. To measure the basal levels of β-gal or Luciferase we used as a control the pQF120 plasmid. The results of the transcriptional repression assays are summarized in Fig. 7. The expression levels of the reporter genes obtained in the absence of IPTG indicate that MalR is expressed to some extent even under noninduced conditions, leading to a decrease of 30% in the malX-lacZfusion and 80% for the malM-luxAB fusion. Expression ofmalR in IPTG-induced pVLTMR containing cultures leads to a reduction of 60% and 93% for Px and Pm, respectively, relative to the levels seen in the IPTG-treated pVLT31 containing control cells. These results suggest that, in vivo, MalR can repress the Pm promoter and thus themalMP operon to a greater extent that the Pxpromoter and its malXCD operon. The results presented in this work indicate that the pneumococcal repressor MalR binds to two slightly different sequences. The consensus sequence shares homology with other consensus sites defined for some of the LacI-GalR proteins family. The consensus sequence is identical to the operator site found for PurR (24Rolfes R.J. Zalkin H. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 19653-19661Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), while high homology is also found in the HTH motif for these two proteins (11Puyet A. Ibáñez A.M. Espinosa M. J. Biol.

Such similarity might explain the toxicity of MalR found in E. coli as the binding of MalR to the PurR consensus sequences may cause interference with the de novo purine biosynthesis and, in part, with pyrimidine biosynthesis pathways, which are regulated by PurR and reported to be essential for cell viability (24Rolfes R.J. Zalkin H. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 19653-19661Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Complementation experiments using both proteins, and the construction of chimeras using different domains of MalR and PurR could help to explain the repression mechanism for MalR protein. However, the binding of PurR to DNA is dependent on the interaction with a co-repressor, either hypoxanthine or guanine (27Rolfes R.J. Zalkin H. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 5758-5766Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,28Meng L. Kilstrup M. Nygaard P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 187: 373Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In the case of MalR, binding to its operators does not need a co-repressor, at least “in vitro,” and if maltose is added to the binding mixture, the MalR-DNA recognition is abolished. We speculate that maltose would bind to MalR, inducing a conformational transition from an active to inactive form, as shown for LacI (29Lewis M. Chang G. Horton N.C. Kercher M.A. Pace H.C. Schumacher M.A. Brennan R.G. Lu P. Science. 1996; 271: 1247-1254Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar). The similarities found at both the amino acid and binding site nucleotide sequences between MalR and PurR are consistent with the DNA-protein interaction model found for PurR and other related proteins (26Schumacher M.A. Choi K.Y. Zalkin H. Brennan R.G. Science. 1994; 266: 763-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). In Fig. 8, a pairwise alignment of the Pur R and MalR sequences is shown. The sequence of MalR differs from that previously published between positions 42 and 57 due to two sequencing errors found during the progress of this work (11Puyet A. Ibáñez A.M. Espinosa M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25402-25408Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Amino acid residues involved in specific contacts such as Leu54 and Ala51 in the hinge helix of PurR are conserved in the MalR protein. The second residue of the recognition helix is serine, which is also found in MalI and RbtR (26Schumacher M.A. Choi K.Y. Zalkin H. Brennan R.G. Science. 1994; 266: 763-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar, 30Reidl J. Boos W. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 4862-4876Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The basic residue Lys55 in PurR discriminates against G·C. In MalR this position is occupied by valine, which is not found in any other member of the family, and may not discriminate like the Ala residue found in GalR and LacI. We have found a differential binding ability of MalR for the two target sites within the malXCD and the malMPpromoter/operator regions. The results on MalR binding to both operators suggests that malMP should compete strongly with the binding to the malXCD operator. Apparently a small change in the adjacent bases to the G/C symmetry axis is enough to dramatically decrease the MalR binding affinity to its target sequence. The differential affinity observed in vitro provides a likely explanation for the differences seen in the in vivoexpression from the transcriptional fusions. In addition, our finding agrees with previous results on MalM induction by maltose (11Puyet A. Ibáñez A.M. Espinosa M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25402-25408Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and with the small differences found for the malX transcript accumulation under induced/uninduced conditions (6Puyet A. Espinosa M. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 230: 800-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Several possibilities may explain the poor repression of promoter Pxby MalR: (i) expression of the malXCD uptake operon is needed prior to the induction of the system, thus allowing the uptake of the inducer molecules; (ii) MalR may not be the only regulator ofmalXCD, and other proteins may play a role as co-repressors for this operon; and (iii) MalX might be shared with other carbohydrate uptake pathways (i.e. maltose and maltodextrins), making it likely that basal levels of the proteins should be expressed. These three possibilities are not self-exclusive. Expression of amylomaltase (codified by gene malM) is significantly affected by MalR as shown by transcriptional repression assays in E. coli (this work) and in experiments on MalM expression in S. pneumoniae(11Puyet A. Ibáñez A.M. Espinosa M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25402-25408Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The failure of longer maltosaccharide molecules, such as maltotriose and maltotetraose, to inactivate MalR, the requirement formalXCD for maltotetraose but not maltose uptake, and the differential expression of the two operons might be explained assuming the presence of additional genes for maltose uptake, possibly regulated by MalR, and additional effectors which could control malXCDin response to higher order maltodextrins. The amino acid sequence homology at the binding consensus DNA binding domain among the members of LacI-GalR family (11Puyet A. Ibáñez A.M. Espinosa M. J. Biol.

A dimeric configuration is required for DNA binding of the LacI-GalI repressor family. The generation of tetramers has been shown for the lactose, raffinose, and fructose repressors, and the ability of the tetramer to bind simultaneously to two different operators has been shown for LacI (29Lewis M.

Gene (Amst .). 1995; 153: 9-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). In the case of MalR, we could envisage that at low concentrations of the repressor, its preferred target would be themalM operator/promoter region. Although MalR appears as a mixture of monomers and dimers after purification we cannot exclude that binding of MalR to promoter Pm could favor the binding of the protein to the malX region through the generation of higher order oligomers. At high MalR concentrations, a DNA loop could be formed bringing close two distant DNA regions through protein-protein interactions, as it has been shown for other members of the LacI protein family (29Lewis M. Chang G. Horton N.C. Kercher M.A. Pace H.C. Schumacher M.A. Brennan R.G. Lu P. Science. 1996; 271: 1247-1254Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar). At present we have no indication of the participation of a host factor in the binding of MalR protein to these regions. The similarities found between MalR and the other members of the family, even at the operator sequence among Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, suggest a high conservation of this regulatory system through evolution. If the S. pneumoniae and enterococcal mal regulons are evolutionary connected, the transition to a system based on weak promoter activity activated by nonrelated regulation proteins such as the enterococcal MalT seems to be the result of genetic shuffling rather than progressive mutation events. The selection of these positively regulated systems might be favored by the particular substrates available to enterobacteria in the natural environment. The identification of new regulons in poorly characterized bacteria may yield the hints to understand evolution mechanisms for complete metabolic systems. We are grateful to V. de Lorenzo and M. A.

Higher plants contain abundant levels of aquaporins in both the tonoplast and plasma membrane. Aquaporins contain six transmembrane segments with three surface loops located at the apoplastic face of the membrane and two loops at the cytosolic side. In this study, we probed the topology of plasma membrane aquaporins to determine the effects of divalent cations on aquaporin conformation, and to identify structural features that distinguish plasma membrane intrinsic proteins from tonoplast intrinsic proteins. Plasma membrane vesicles from storage tissue of Beta vulgaris L. were subjected to limited proteolysis, and proteolytic fragmentation patterns were detected using affinity-purified antibodies recognizing aquaporins of 31-kDa. In its native membrane-associated state, the 31-aquaporin band, PMIP31, was refractory to proteolysis by trypsin. However, mercuric compounds specifically induced a conformational change resulting in the exposure of a proteolytic cleavage site and formation of a unique 22-kDa proteolytic fragment (p22). N-terminal sequence analysis of p22 established its identity as an aquaporin-derived fragment. Topological studies using sealed right-side-out plasma membrane vesicles established that the proteolytic cleavage site is located at surface loop C, the second apoplastic loop, immediately preceding the sequence Gly-Gly-Gly-Ala-Asn. The Gly-Gly-Gly-Ala-Asn-X-X-X-X-Gly-Tyr motif of loop C and a 14 amino acid motif in apoplastic loop E, Thr-Gly-Ile/Thr-Asn-Pro-Ala-Arg-Ser-Leu/Phe-Gly-Ala-Ala-Ile/Val-Ile/Val-Phe/Tyr-Asn are completely conserved in all known higher plant aquaporins of plasma membrane origin and are not present in any of the known tonoplast intrinsic proteins.

Based upon N-terminal and internal sequence analysis of polypeptides electroeluted from SDS gels, our laboratory has identified aquaporins of 31, 29, and 27 kDa in PM vesicles obtained from storage tissue ofBeta vulgaris L. The two major aquaporin-containing species, referred to as PMIP31 and PMIP27, are the most abundant groups of polypeptides in these membranes and are prone to form disulfide-linked oligomeric species in the absence of DTT or other reducing agents (23Qi X. Tai C.Y. Wasserman B.P. Plant Physiol. (Bethesda). 1995; 108: 387-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Three PMIP cDNA clones, designated BPM1–3, have been isolated and sequenced (26Qi X. Harn C. Mu H. Wasserman B.P. Plant Physiol. (Bethesda). 1996; 112: 861Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). To probe the topology and conformation of these PMIPs, highly specific affinity-purified polyclonal antibodies recognizing the 31-kDa and 27-kDa species have been generated (27Wasserman B.P. Qi X.

As part of this work, we sought to determine if divalent cations could influence the conformation of PM aquaporins. Upon subjecting the PM vesicles from Beta to in situ limited proteolysis with a panel of divalent cations, Hg2+ was found to induce formation of a unique 22-kDa proteolytic fragment (p22).

Site-directed mutagenesis studies indicated that Hg2+ interacts with Cys-189 of erythrocyte membrane AQP1 and may inhibit aquaporin function by sterically occluding the pore formed by the native protein embedded within the membrane (33Preston G.M. Jung J.S. Guggino W.B. Agre P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17-20Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In plant systems, Cys-116 of γ-TIP and Cys-118 of δ-TIP fromArabidopsis have been correlated with Hg2+-sensitivity (18Daniels M.J. Chaumont F. Mirkov T.E. Chrispeels M.J. Plant Cell. 1996; 8: 587-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). The predicted topology of γ- and δ-TIP places these cysteines proximal to the water pore as with Cys-189 of AQP1. In this work, we demonstrate that exposure of a previously inaccessible proteolytic cleavage site of an aquaporin component of PMIP31 is the direct result of a Hg2+-induced conformational change. Based upon this effect, we were able to pinpoint the location of the proteolytic cleavage site and to establish the membrane topology of this aquaporin. Moreover, we identified two amino acid motifs that are highly conserved among the aquaporins localized at the PM of higher plants. The results are discussed in light of structural features that distinguish PM- and tonoplast-localized aquaporins.

This wash was repeated to ensure removal of proteases and protease inhibitors that migrate in the range of 22 to 20 kDa. Membrane pellets were suspended in 100 μl of 250 mm sucrose, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm EDTA, and 10 mm HEPES/NaOH, pH 7.2 (buffer A). Aliquots of 24 μl were brought to 100 mm DTT, incubated for 15 min, combined with 24 μl of sample buffer, and subjected to SDS-PAGE. Electropurified polypeptides were electrophoresed on 12% polyacrylamide gels in the absence of glycerol. The gels were equilibrated in 0.05% SDS and 10 mm CAPS; 30% methanol, pH 11, and polyvinylidine difluoride membranes were soaked in methanol for 15 min and rinsed with this buffer in the absence of SDS. Electrotransfer to polyvinylidine difluoride membranes was carried out at 80 V for 4 h, and polypeptides were visualized with 0.5% Ponceau S in 1% acetic acid. Polyvinylidine difluoride strips were used for sequencing. Approximately 130 pmol of PMIP31 and p22 were used for N-terminal sequencing (Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ), and 100 pmol of PMIP31 for internal sequencing (Harvard Microchemistry, Cambridge, MA). Polyclonal antibodies recognizing PMIP31 were generated and affinity-purified. The antibodies were highly specific and did not cross-react with the 29-kDa species that migrates just below PMIP31, with PMIP27, or with other PM proteins (Fig.1). Limited proteolysis using trypsin was performed to examine the effects of Hg2+ and a range of other divalent cations on proteolytic fragmentation patterns of PMIP31 (Fig. 2). In the complete absence of divalent cations, PMIP31 was refractory to proteolysis (Fig.2 A, lane 2 versus lane 1). Similarly, with Mn2+, Cd2+, and Cu2+, no novel proteolytic fragments were detected (Fig. 2, D-F). Ca2+ and Mg2+ each produced a minor fragmentation band at 28 kDa (Fig. 2, B and C). Hg2+, however, exerted the most striking effect where dose-dependent formation of a prominent 22-kDa proteolytic fragment (p22) was observed (Fig. 2 A). p22 levels increased in intensity to about 3 mm Hg2+ and then leveled off. Formation of p22 was also induced by Pronase E and by the addition of the organic mercurial compoundp-hydroxymercuriphenylsulfonic acid. 2L. M. Barone, C. Shih, and B. P. Wasserman, unpublished data. Figure 2Effects of divalent cations on proteolytic fragmentation patterns. PM vesicles were equilibrated with 0.01% digitonin in the absence and presence of selected divalent cations and incubated with trypsin (4.8 μg) for 20 min. Immunoblots were probed with anti-PMIP31.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To eliminate the possibility that Hg2+-induced proteolytic cleavage was due to an activation of or change in the specificity of trypsin or Pronase E, two control experiments were carried out. First, removal of soluble Hg2+ by washing (Fig.3, lanes 3–5) or chelation (Fig. 3, lanes 8–10) prior to the addition of protease did not prevent generation of p22. This finding demonstrates that formation of p22 was not due to direct activation of trypsin by exogenous Hg2+. In the second control, limited proteolysis mixtures were incubated with Hg2+ in the absence of protease to exclude the possible activation of endogenous PM proteases. No proteolysis was observed under these conditions. These results are therefore consistent with a Hg2+-induced conformational change occurring in PMIP31. PM fractions freshly prepared by aqueous two-phase partitioning contain predominantly sealed ROVs, as determined by measuring the latency of the PM marker enzyme callose synthase (37Wu A. Harriman R.W. Frost D.J. Read S.M. Wasserman B.P. Plant Physiol. (Bethesda). 1991; 97: 684-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The freshly prepared vesicles used to determine the location of proteolytic cleavage exhibited a latency value of 94%. If p22 was generated using tightly sealed ROVs in the absence of detergent, this would be consistent with the occurrence of proteolysis at the outer face of the PM. Conversely, a requirement for detergent would indicate that proteolysis of PMIP31 was occurring at the cytosolic surface. Thus, the ROVs were subjected to trypsinization in the absence and presence of Hg2+ and the detergent digitonin. Without Hg2+, PMIP31 remained inaccessible to proteolysis in the absence of added detergent (Fig.4, lanes 2 and 3). On the other hand, when Hg2+ was present, abundant levels of p22 were produced from these sealed vesicles (Fig. 4, lane 5). Low levels of digitonin did not increase levels of p22 that were generated (Fig. 4, lane 6), which is consistent with a proteolytic cleavage site located at the apoplastic face of the PM. In addition, these results provide evidence that generation of p22 is not merely a result of the exposure of inaccessible proteolytic sites on PMIP31 by detergent. The complete disappearance of both PMIP31 and p22 upon raising digitonin levels to 0.1% (Fig. 4, lanes 4 and7) confirms that PMIP31 contains numerous transmembrane proteolytic cleavage sites, which only become accessible upon detergent disruption of the membrane (35Wu A. Wasserman B.P. Plant J. 1993; 4: 683-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Similar to PMIP31, the p22 proteolytic fragment could not be solubilized by Triton X-100 at levels to 1%,2 indicating that p22 retains the hydrophobic properties of the parent protein. p22 was readily observable on immunoblots using enhanced chemiluminescence or colorimetric development with alkaline phosphatase,2however, the fragment was not clearly apparent on Coomassie Blue- or silver-stained gels. While investigating the effects of IAA and DTT on the formation of disulfide-linked oligomers of PMIP31 (36Umbach A.L. Siedow J.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25019-25026Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), the intensity and resolution of p22 on immunoblots was markedly enhanced using vesicles carboxymethylated with IAA during tissue homogenization. Therefore, formation of p22 from PM vesicles prepared in the absence and presence of IAA was compared (Fig.5). When IAA and DTT were eliminated from homogenization buffers, p22 levels were markedly reduced (Fig.5 A). The inability to form p22 in PM vesicles isolated in the complete absence of sulfhydryl reagents indicates that the tryptic cleavage site is accessible only when the 31-kDa aquaporin giving rise to p22 is in a reduced monomeric state. Thus, Hg2+-induced p22 formation by trypsin requires inclusion of DTT (Figs. 2, 3, 4) or IAA (Fig. 5 A) during tissue disruption thereby minimizing formation of the disulfide-linked oligomeric species observed during initial characterizations of PMIP31 (23Qi X. Tai C.Y. Wasserman B.P. Plant Physiol. (Bethesda). 1995; 108: 387-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Carboxymethylation with IAA did not adversely affect p22 formation, and most importantly, IAA treatment stabilized p22 from further proteolytic degradation. Consequently, p22 from carboxymethylated vesicles was readily visualized on silver-stained gels (Fig. 5 B). Carboxymethylation was essential for obtaining sufficient quantities of p22 for N-terminal sequence analysis. PMIP31 and p22 were electropurified, and each was subjected to N-terminal sequence analysis. In two separate sequencing runs from independently prepared samples, PMIP31 yielded the N-terminal fragment of Lys-Glu-Val-Ser-Glu-Glu-Ala-Gln-Val-His-Gln-His-Gly-Lys-Asp-Tyr-Val-Arg-Pro. In this sequence, 18 of the 19 residues correspond to the predicted gene product of the BPM2 cDNA clone (26Qi X. Harn C. Mu H. Wasserman B.P. Plant Physiol. (Bethesda). 1996; 112: 861Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Hydropathy analysis of BPM2 predicts six transmembrane segments with the N and C termini exposed to the cytosol (Fig. 6). This agrees with the predicted topology of known plant aquaporins (18Daniels M.J. Chaumont F. Mirkov T.E. Chrispeels M.J. Plant Cell. 1996; 8: 587-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) and with the recently determined three-dimensional structure of AQP1 (7Cheng A.C. Van Hoek A.N. Yeager M. Verkman A.S. Mitra A.K. Nature. 1997; 387: 627-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 8Walz T. Hirai T. Murata K. Heymann J.B. Mitsuoka K. Fujiyoshi Y. Smith B.L. Agre P. Engel A. Nature. 1997; 387: 624-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). The N-terminal sequence of p22 was Gly-Gly-Gly-Ala-Asn-Val-Val-Asn-Val-Val-Asn-X-Gly, which corresponds to a range of predicted sequences found in loop C of PM-localized aquaporins (Fig.7 A). Analysis of apoplastic loop C shows complete conservation of the Gly-Gly-Gly-Ala-Asn-X-X-X-X-Gly-Tyr motif in 12 of the 13 plant PM aquaporin cDNAs analyzed (Fig.7 A) (11Yamada S. Katsuhara M. Kelly W.B. Michalowski C.B. Bohnert H.J. Plant Cell. 1995; 7: 1129-1142Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 21Kammerloher W. Fischer U. Piechottka G.P. Schaffner A.R. Plant J. 1994; 6: 187-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar, 22Daniels M.J. Mirkov T.E. Chrispeels M.J. Plant Physiol.

The placement of this motif at an apoplastic surface loop is consistent with the results of the accessibility study conducted with ROVs (Fig. 4). Loop B contains the first of two Asn-Pro-Ala domains common to all members of the aquaporin family (10Chrispeels M.J. Agre P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 421-425Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). BPM2 contains four cysteine residues (positions 69, 91, 127, and 132), each of which are located within transmembrane segments 2 or 3 in close proximity to the proteolytic cleavage site. It should be also noted that Arg-149, which is one amino acid removed from the Gly-Gly-Gly-Ala-Asn motif in PMIP31, serves as the putative trypsin recognition site. PMIP27, which contains the BPM3 gene product, does not contain Arg or Lys residues preceding the Gly-Gly-Gly-Ala-Asn motif; this would explain why PMIP27 does not form an analogous proteolytic fragmentation product in the presence of Hg2+. Further analysis revealed a second conserved motif that begins in transmembrane segment 5 and extends midway through surface loop E. This motif, defined as Thr-Gly-Ile/Thr-Asn-Pro-Ala-Arg-Ser-Leu/Phe-Gly-Ala-Ala-Ile/Val-Ile/Val-Phe/Tyr-Asn, exhibited complete identity in each of the 13 plant PM aquaporin genes examined and contains the second Asn-Pro-Ala domain (Fig.7 B). Similar to the Gly-Gly-Gly-Ala-Asn motif of surface loop C, the loop E motif is characterized by an Asn residue toward the C terminus of this domain. Other than the Asn-Pro-Ala motif, loop E of the PM aquaporins does not show any homology with the corresponding region of the TIPs. In general, surface loops C and E of the PM aquaporins are of shorter length in TIPs. No distinguishing motifs were found in surface loop A. This analysis shows that the highly conserved motifs of loops C and E are found exclusively in PM aquaporins and have not been found in any of the predicted sequences derived from the tonoplast-localized aquaporins (15Hofte H. Hubbard L. Reizer J. Ludevid D. Herman E.M. Chrispeels M.J. Plant Physiol. (Bethesda). 1992; 99: 561-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 18Daniels M.J. Chaumont F. Mirkov T.E. Chrispeels M.J. Plant Cell. 1996; 8: 587-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 42Brooker R.J. Slayman C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 8827-8832Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The need for direct structural analysis of plant aquaporins prompted us to investigate aquaporin conformation and topology in sealed PM vesicles using limited proteolysis. Membrane-associated aquaporins lie within the hydrophobic core of the PM and are generally resistant to proteolysis. However, addition of Hg2+ led to exposure of a previously inaccessible proteolytic cleavage site immediately preceding the Gly-Gly-Gly-Ala-Asn motif of apoplastic loop C located proximal to conserved cysteine residues, which comprise the putative Hg2+-binding site of plant aquaporins (18Daniels M.J. Chaumont F. Mirkov T.E. Chrispeels M.J. Plant Cell. 1996; 8: 587-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Localization of the proteolytic cleavage site at loop C prompted us to analyze the surface loops of plant-derived PM and tonoplast-localized aquaporins. This analysis resulted in the identification of motifs in surface loops C and E, which are common to aquaporins localized at the PM. These results are also of interest because Hg2+ is known to reversibly inhibit water transport of numerous animal and plant aquaporins expressed in Xenopus oocytes (18Daniels M.J. Chaumont F. Mirkov T.E. Chrispeels M.J. Plant Cell. 1996; 8: 587-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 21Kammerloher W. Fischer U. Piechottka G.P. Schaffner A.R. Plant J. 1994; 6: 187-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar, 33Preston G.M. Jung J.S. Guggino W.B. Agre P. J. Biol.

We consequently hypothesized that the widely observed inhibitory effect of Hg2+ on water permeability in oocyte expression systems could be due in part to a Hg2+-induced conformational change. Divalent cation-induced alterations of proteolytic fragmentation patterns are generally indicative of major shifts in the conformational state of a polypeptide, and as a result, limited proteolysis has become a widely employed approach for probing the topology of membrane proteins (44Bergeron J.J.M. Brenner M. Thomas D.Y. Williams D.B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 124-128Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar, 45Ou W.-J. Bergeron J.J.M. Li Y. Kang C.Y. Thomas D.Y. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 11857-11864Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The Hg2+-induced conformational change observed in PMIP31 is consistent with these results. On the other hand, PMIP27 resisted proteolysis,2 and new fragments were not formed upon exposure to Hg2+. PMIP27 most closely aligns with BPM3, which unlike BPM2 does not contain a positively charged trypsin recognition site preceding the Gly-Gly-Gly-Ala-Asn motif. Hg2+-induced conformational changes were not detected in AQP1. Studies of the secondary structure of purified and reconstituted AQP1 by circular dichroism (48Inoue K. Takeuchi Y. Nishimura M. Haranishimura I. Plant Mol. Biol. 1995; 28: 1089-1101Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) and fluorescence quenching of tryptophan (49Maurel C. Reizer J. Schroeder J.I. Chrispeels M.J. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2241-2247Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar) did not reveal significant Hg2+-induced spectral changes, indicating that AQP1 conformation was not significantly affected by Hg2+ under these conditions. Our sequence alignments and biochemical characterization indicate that the varying range of proteolytic fragmentation profiles observed in different aquaporins in response to Hg2+ could be related to several factors, which could include the absence of exposed proteolytic recognition sites, the extent to which these sites are embedded within the hydrophobic core of the membrane, or to the degree of oligomerization. Prior to the sequence analysis reported in this study, it was not known whether PMIP31 contained a single protein or was heterogeneous. Based upon the cumulative data, PMIP31 may be a composite of several aquaporin isoforms. Two observations are consistent with this notion. First, in the majority of experiments, the appearance of p22 did not closely correlate with the disappearance of PMIP31. The second line of evidence is based upon amino acid sequence analysis. Multiple trials of N-terminal sequence analysis of the electroeluted 31-kDa species provided unambiguous proof that PMIP31 contains the BPM2gene product. However, the results of earlier internal sequence analysis (23Qi X. Tai C.Y. Wasserman B.P. Plant Physiol. (Bethesda). 1995; 108: 387-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) revealed the tryptic peptide Leu-Gly-Ala-Asp-Lys-Tyr-Pro-Asn-Arg-Gln-Pro-Leu-Gly-Thr-Ser-Val-Gln-Thr-Arg. This peptide shows close homology to a region of pTOM75 (20Fray R.G. Wallace A. Grierson D. Lycett G.W. Plant Mol. Biol. 1994; 24: 539-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), pea clone 7a (50Kyte J. Doolittle R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 105-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (17102) Google Scholar) and PIP2b (21Kammerloher W. Fischer U. Piechottka G.P. Schaffner A.R. Plant J. 1994; 6: 187-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar) beginning at residues 10–11 but does not closely match any sequence located near the N terminus of BPM2. The PMIP31 isoform containing this sequence could be blocked at the N terminus, because N-terminal analysis did not indicate any peptides with overlapping sequences. The origin and properties of p22 remain to be established. This peptide was difficult to isolate, but with carboxymethylation sufficient amounts for sequence analysis were recovered. Six of its ten residues identified at the N terminus of p22 (Gly-Gly-Gly-Ala-Asn-X-X-X-X-Gly) corresponded to the BPM clones and a broad range of other PMIPs (Fig. 7 A). Whereas this information clearly established that p22 comes from a PMIP, this limited sequence is not sufficiently detailed to match this fragment with any of the known PMIP cDNA clones from Beta. The existence of only one antigenic proteolytic fragment following trypsinization in the presence of Hg2+ indicates that the N-terminal half of the parent PMIP may lack antigenicity. Alternatively, the N-terminal fragment of the parent polypeptide may be degraded into smaller fragments not retained by the gel, or p22 could contain both halves of the protein with one of the N termini blocked. We were unable to discern between these possibilities. We also note that p22 migrates anomalously in SDS gels, as do the disulfide-linked oligomers of PMIPs 31 and 27 (23Qi X. Tai C.Y. Wasserman B.P. Plant Physiol. (Bethesda). 1995; 108: 387-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Based upon the position of the proteolytic cleavage site, this fragment would be predicted to migrate at a lower apparent molecular mass. The introduction of Hg2+-induced cross-links could be partly responsible for this shift in electrophoretic mobility. This study identified structural features distinguishing PM from tonoplast-localized aquaporins in higher plants. Analysis of the 22-kDa Hg2+-induced proteolytic fragment revealed that the Gly-Gly-Gly-Ala-Asn motif of apoplastic loop C is conserved in a wide range of plant PM aquaporins. Similarly, apoplastic loop E contains the motif Thr-Gly-Ile/Thr-Asn-Pro-Ala-Arg-Ser-Leu/Phe-Gly-Ala-Ala-Ile/Val-Ile/Val-Phe/Thr-Asn, which is also highly conserved in plant PM aquaporins. The contiguous sections of both motifs terminate with an Asn residue. Since neither motif is present in tonoplast-localized aquaporins, either or both of these sequences may represent a recognition signal for targeting or docking of aquaporin-containing vesicles. This would provide a mechanism for the sorting of PM-localized aquaporins as they are secreted through the endomembrane system of the cell. We thank George M. Carman, David J. Frost, Bruce S. Jacobson, and Chen Mu-Forster for helpful discussions."

The subunit composition of purified eIF3 is, however, controversial. eIF3 purified in different laboratories is reported to contain 7–11 polypeptides ranging in molecular masses between 26 and 170 kDa (15Schreier M.H.

Chem. 1983; 258: 866-871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), although some of the subunits seem to be present in non-stoichiometric amounts, suggesting that eIF3 might be heterogeneous. Furthermore, the possibility also exists that at least some of the smaller polypeptides are artificially derived from larger ones by limited proteolysis. To better understand how eIF3 functions in initiation, it is important to define accurately the subunit composition of functional eIF3. In this paper, we describe the purification of eIF3 from rabbit reticulocyte lysates using an assay that measures the ability of eIF3 to stimulate the binding of Met-tRNAf to 40 S ribosomal subunits. The purified protein that consists of six major polypeptides ranging in molecular masses from 35 to 110 kDa, lacks the 170-kDa polypeptide that is reported to be a constituent of mammalian eIF3 preparations from other laboratories (15Schreier M.H.

The properties of our purified eIF3 preparation lacking the p170 polypeptide are described. Additionally, we have prepared specific antibodies directed against eIF3 in chickens and immunochemically characterized the eIF3 subunits. The availability of monospecific chicken antibodies for each subunit of purified eIF3 allowed us to immunoscreen human cDNA libraries and to isolate and characterize the cDNA encoding the p110 subunit of eIF3. Consistent with our observation that p110 is an important component of mammalian eIF3, we found that it is the human homologue ofS. cerevisiae Prt1p protein (24Hartwell L.H. McLaughlin C.S. Proc.

McLaughlin C.S. Moldave K. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 10846-10851Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The preparation of35S-labeled rabbit liver Met-tRNAf(10,000–30,000 cpm/pmol), 40 S ribosomal subunits from Artemia salina eggs, and homogeneous recombinant eIF1A and eIF5 were as described in previous papers from this laboratory (28Stringer E.A.

Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 4794-4799Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Initiation factors eIF2 and eIF3 were purified from 0.5 m KCl-wash proteins of rabbit reticulocyte polysomal pellets as follows. The preparation of crude ribosomal salt-wash proteins from 300 ml of rabbit reticulocyte lysates (Green Hectares Co.) and subsequent fractionation of ribosomal 0.5 m KCl-wash proteins by successive stepwise elution from DEAE-cellulose and phosphocellulose columns followed by FPLC-Mono Q (HR5/5) chromatography were as described previously for the isolation of rabbit reticulocyte eIF5 from this laboratory (32Chevesich J. Chaudhuri J. Maitra U. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20659-20667Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). During the Mono Q gradient step, eIF2 eluted at ∼270 mm KCl, whereas eIF3 activity eluted at ∼400 mm KCl. Fractions containing eIF2 activity were pooled and further purified by FPLC-Mono S chromatography. Purified eIF2 had a specific activity of about 3000 units/mg protein and exhibited three major polypeptide bands corresponding to the α, β, and γ subunits of eIF2 (33Chakrabarti A. Maitra U. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12964-12972Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The pooled Mono Q-eIF3 fraction was concentrated to about 1 ml by Centricon-30 filtration and then purified by centrifugation at 40,000 rpm in two 15–40% (w/v) glycerol gradients containing 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 650 mm KCl for 20 h in a SW41 rotor at 2 °C. Fractions containing eIF3 activity were pooled, dialyzed against buffer A (20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 10% glycerol) containing 100 mmKCl and fractionated on a FPLC-Mono S column (1-ml bed volume). eIF3 activity eluted at about 400 mm KCl. Active fractions were pooled, dialyzed for about 5 h against buffer A containing 55% glycerol and 100 mm KCl, and then stored in small aliquots at −70 °C. eIF3 activity was measured by its ability to bind to 40 S ribosomal subunits and stimulate AUG-dependent binding of the [35S]Met-tRNAf·eIF2·GTP ternary complex to 40 S ribosomal subunits in the presence of 1 mmMgCl2. Reaction mixtures (50 μl) containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, 5 mm 2- mercaptoethanol, 4 μg of nuclease-free bovine serum albumin, about 2.5 μg of purified eIF2, 8 pmol [35S]Met-tRNAf (15,000–30,000 cpm/pmol), and 6 μm GTP were incubated for 4 min at 37 °C to promote formation of the [35S]Met-tRNAf·eIF2·GTP ternary complex. The reaction mixtures were then supplemented with eIF3 (0.5–2 μg of protein), 0.05 A 260 unit of AUG codon, 0.6 A 260 unit of 40 S ribosomal subunits, and MgCl2 (1 mm final concentration). Following incubation at 37 °C for 4 min, the reaction mixtures (125 μl each) were chilled in an ice-water bath, layered onto 5 ml of 7.5–30% (w/v) sucrose gradients containing 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm MgCl2, 100 mm KCl, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and centrifuged at 48,000 rpm for 105 min in an SW 50.1 rotor. Fractions (250–300 μl) were collected from the bottom of each tube, and the radioactivity was measured by counting in Aquasol in a liquid scintillation spectrometer. Under the conditions of this assay, stimulation of formation of the 40 S initiation complex was directly proportional to the amount of eIF3 added. The stimulation of binding of [35S]Met-tRNAf to 40 S ribosomal subunits by eIF3 varied between 2- and 4-fold. A 40 S initiation complex reaction mixture (175 μl) was prepared and incubated as described under “Assay of eIF3 Activity” with the following modifications. During the formation of the ternary complex, 40 pmol of [35S]Met-tRNAf (18,000 cpm/pmol), 12 μg of eIF2, and 18 μm GTP were added, while during formation of the 40 S initiation complex, 2.0A 260 units of 40 S ribosomal subunits, 0.15A 260 unit of AUG codon, and 25 μg of purified eIF3 were added. After incubation to form the 40 S initiation complex, the reaction mixture was chilled and subjected to 7.5–30% sucrose density gradient centrifugation as described under “Assay of eIF3 Activity.” Following centrifugation, fractions containing 40 S initiation complex, free of unreacted reaction components, were pooled, divided into small aliquots, and stored at −70 °C. Antibodies against purified eIF3 were prepared in laying hens following a procedure similar to that used previously for preparation of anti-eIF5 antibodies (32Chevesich J. Chaudhuri J. Maitra U. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20659-20667Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) by an adaptation of the procedure of Carroll and Stollar (34Carroll S.B. Stollar B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 24-26Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as follows. Approximately 140 μg of purified eIF3 was mixed with complete Freund's adjuvant, sonicated briefly to obtain a fine emulsion, and then injected at four sites into the pectoral muscle of a laying hen. A booster of 70 μg of eIF3, mixed with an equal volume of an incomplete Freund's adjuvant, was given after 4 weeks. The eggs were collected daily, marked, and stored at 4 °C. Total IgY antibodies were isolated from egg yolks and purified by polyethylene glycol 8000 fractionation as described (32Chevesich J. Chaudhuri J. Maitra U. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20659-20667Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). IgY antibodies specific for each of the eIF3 subunits were isolated from polyethylene glycol-purified total IgY antibodies by affinity purification using each eIF3 subunit blotted onto aminophenylthioether paper (Schleicher and Schuell) as an antigen following the procedure of Olmsted (35Olmsted J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 11955-11957Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as described by Ghosh et al. (36Ghosh S. Chevesich J. Maitra U. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 5134-5140Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) for affinity purification of anti-eIF5 antibodies from rabbit antisera. Immunoblot analysis of eIF3 was performed using purified chicken egg yolk anti-eIF3 IgY antibodies as probes. Rabbit anti-chicken IgY coupled to alkaline phosphatase was used to detect the binding of the primary antibody to eIF3 polypeptides in the blots. Immunoblot analysis of eIF2 and eIF1A was carried out using rabbit anti-eIF2 and anti-eIF1A antibodies, respectively as probes as described previously (30Chaudhuri J. Si K. Maitra U. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7883-7891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Monospecific antibodies against the p170 polypeptide of HeLa cell eIF3 (37Johnson K.R. Merrick W.C. Zoll W.L. Zhu Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7106-7113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) was a kind gift of Dr. Keith R. Johnson of the University of Toledo. Approximately 1 mg of purified rabbit reticulocyte eIF3 was electrophoresed on a 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and then electrotransferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane. The blot was stained with Ponceau S, and the portion of the membrane corresponding to the p110 subunit of eIF3 was excised and washed with deionized water to remove excess stain. The p110-containing nitrocellulose strip was submitted to the Protein Sequencing Facility at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, for tryptic digestion of p110 and microsequencing of two well-resolved tryptic peptides in an automated Protein Sequencer. To clone the cDNA for the 110-kDa polypeptide of eIF3, a HeLa cell λZAP II cDNA library (Stratagene) was screened using as a probe 1:10,000 dilution of affinity-purified anti-110-kDa antibodies, essentially as described by Snyder et al. (38Snyder M. Elledge S. Sweetser D. Young R.A. Davis R.W. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 107-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The cDNA inserts present in the homogeneous positive clones were isolated by in vivoexcision as recombinant pSK-plasmids using filamentous helper phage. A 2.6-kb cDNA insert from the largest clone was subjected to nested deletions using the exonuclease III-S1 nuclease method (Erase-a-base, Promega). Plasmid clones with overlapping deletions were sequenced by the dideoxy chain termination method (39Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) using a kit from U. S. Biochemical Corp. Regions of the insert not covered by the deletions were sequenced using specific oligonucleotide primers based on newly acquired sequences. To obtain the complete 5′ end of the cDNA, a 185-base pair DNA fragment corresponding to a sequence 70 nucleotides from the 5′ end of the 2.6-kb clone was amplified by polymerase chain reaction using appropriate primers and labeled with 32P by random priming using [α-32P]dCTP (Boehringer Mannheim kit). This was used as a probe to screen a λgt10 skeletal muscle cDNA library (CLONTECH). The cDNA inserts present in the positive clones were analyzed by restriction digestion. The largest cDNA insert (3.2 kb) was then sequenced completely on both strands. Proteins synthesized in IPTG-induced Escherichia coli cells infected with λZAP II clone containing the 2.6-kb cDNA insert were immobilized on nitrocellulose membranes and used to affinity-purify clone-specific antibodies from total chicken egg yolk anti-eIF3 antibodies by the procedure of Snyder et al. (38Snyder M. Elledge S. Sweetser D. Young R.A. Davis R.W. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 107-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) as described by Chakravarti and Maitra (40Chakravarti D. Maitra U. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10524-10533Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). E. coli XL-1 Blue (Stratagene) cells were infected with ∼2 × 105 plaque-forming units of λZAP II clone, plated in duplicate, and grown at 40 °C for 4 h. Nitrocellulose membrane filters presoaked in 10 mm IPTG were layered on each plate and kept at 37 °C for 3 h. The filters were then removed, washed with TNT buffer (10 mmTris-Cl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20), and then incubated with TNT buffer containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin to block nonspecific binding sites. The filters were then incubated with 5 ml of either chicken egg yolk anti-eIF3 antibodies (1:10 dilution in TNT buffer containing 0.2% bovine serum albumin) or preimmune chicken IgY (1:10 dilution in TNT buffer containing 0.2% bovine serum albumin) for 10 h at 4 °C. The filters were then cut into small pieces and washed three times in TNT buffer. The bound antibodies were then eluted by stirring the filter pieces into 1 ml of 4 mguanidine hydrochloride in TNT buffer for 10 min. Eluted antibodies were dialyzed for 6 h against a buffer containing 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, and 150 mm NaCl to allow renaturation of the eluted antibodies. Purified antibodies were stored at −70 °C until use. Purified rabbit reticulocyte eIF3 (5 μg in 90 μl of TNT buffer) was mixed with epitope-selected antibodies (diluted 1:10 in TNT buffer) or preimmune chicken IgY. After incubation at 4 °C for 2 h, 20 μl of a 1:1 slurry of Protein A-Sepharose coupled to rabbit anti-chicken IgY antibodies (Sigma) was added and the incubation continued for an additional 2 h at 4 °C. The immune complexes bound to Sepharose beads were isolated by centrifugation and washed three times (10 min each) with TNT buffer and once (5 min) with 1 ml of TNT buffer containing 0.1% SDS. The washed immune complexes were then suspended in 40 μl of 63 mm Tris-Cl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, and 0.04% bromphenol blue, incubated at 65 °C for 10 min, and centrifuged. The supernatant was adjusted to 150 mm 2-mercaptoethanol and incubated at 90 °C for 5 min, cooled, and then subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel (10% gel) electrophoresis. The separated eIF3 polypeptides were electrotransferred to a PVDF membrane and probed with total anti-eIF3 antibodies (1: 5000 dilution) for immunodetection of eIF3 polypeptides. eIF2 activity was measured by the ability of the factor to promote GTP-dependent binding of [35S]Met-tRNAf to a nitrocellulose membrane filter as described previously (28Stringer E.A. Chaudhuri A. Maitra U. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 6845-6848Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Protein was determined by the method of Bradford (41Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216412) Google Scholar) using reagents obtained from Bio-Rad. eIF3 was purified from rabbit reticulocyte lysates as described under “Experimental Procedures” using an assay that measures the ability of eIF3 to stimulate the transfer of Met-tRNAf to 40 S ribosomal subunits. Specifically, the assay measures the ability of eIF3 to stimulate the transfer of [35S]Met-tRNAf from a preformed [35S]Met-tRNAf·eIF2·GTP ternary complex to 40 S ribosomal subunits in the presence of AUG at 1 mmMg2+ concentration to form the 40 S initiation complex (40 S·eIF3·AUG·[35S]Met-tRNAf·eIF2·GTP). The results of a typical assay using Mono Q- and Mono S-FPLC purified eIF3 are shown in Fig. 1. In these experiments, eIF3 stimulated the formation of an AUG-dependent 40 S initiation complex approximately 3–4-fold. This level of stimulation is consistent with reports from other laboratories (10Benne R. Hershey J.W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 3078-3087Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Trachsel H.

Chem. 1979; 254: 2509-2516Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Analysis of the Mono S-FPLC purified eIF3 by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by Coomassie Blue staining showed six major polypeptide bands of molecular masses 110, 67, 42, 40, 36, and 35 kDa (Fig. 2, panel A, lane 2). However, the subunit composition of eIF3 varies between preparations. Although the six major polypeptides mentioned above are present in all active preparations of eIF3, the doublet at 67 kDa and two minor polypeptides of apparent molecular masses 93 and 80 kDa (present in the eIF3 preparation shown in Fig. 2, panel A, lane 2) were not observed in all active preparations of eIF3. At present, it is unclear whether these additional polypeptides are constituents of eIF3. The Mono S-FPLC purified eIF3 was used to immunize laying hens, and anti-eIF3 antibodies were isolated from egg yolks as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The purified IgY antibodies reacted strongly with all eIF3 polypeptides on Western blots (Fig. 2,panel A, lanes 3 and 4), whereas preimmune IgY did not react with any eIF3 polypeptides (data not shown). In addition, purified anti-eIF3 IgY antibodies did not react with any other initiation factors or with 40 S and 60 S ribosomal proteins (data not shown). It is to be noted that the pattern of eIF3 immunoreactivity varies slightly between preparations presumably due to degradation of the higher molecular subunits during analysis (compare eIF3 immunoblots between Figs. 2 and 3). Furthermore, antibodies affinity-purified against each of the eIF3 subunits specifically interacted with that particular polypeptide and did not cross-react with any other polypeptides in Western blot analysis of crude initiation factor preparations (Fig. 2, panel B) or of crude HeLa cell lysates (data not shown). These observations indicate that all the major polypeptides of eIF3 are antigenically distinct and are not derived by limited proteolytic digestion of the larger subunits. Analysis of the subunit composition of our eIF3 preparation shows that it lacks the 170-kDa polypeptide that is reported to be a constituent of mammalian eIF3 preparations from other laboratories (15Schreier M.H. Erni B. Staehelin T. J. Mol. Biol. 1977; 116: 727-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 16Safer B. Adams S.L. Kemper W.K. Berry K.W. Lloyd M. Merrick W.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

To determine the fate of the 170-kDa polypeptide during the course of purification, we carried out Western blot analysis of protein fractions using monospecific anti-p170 antibodies as probes. We observed that while the Mono Q-eIF3 fraction contained a polypeptide that reacted strongly with anti-p170 antibodies, this immunoreactive polypeptide was absent in Mono S-eIF3 (Fig. 2, panel A, compare lanes 5 and 6). To investigate if the immunoreactive polypeptide dissociated from eIF3 during high salt glycerol gradient centrifugation, we analyzed glycerol gradient fractions by Western blot using anti-p170 antibodies as probes. Fig. 2, panel C, shows that while a fraction of the immunoreactive polypeptide sedimented with eIF3 activity (fractions 8–12), a major portion of the immunoreactive polypeptide sedimented near the top of the gradient (fractions 22–24), at a region where no eIF3 activity was present (data not shown). These results suggest that while p170 copurified with eIF3 during earlier steps of purification, the polypeptide dissociated from the complex during high-salt glycerol gradient centrifugation and subsequent Mono S"

In this study, the high mobility group chromosomal protein, HMG-I(Y), has been shown to activate NF-Y in transient transfections in vivo using the natural murine α2(I) collagen promoter and a multimerized version of the proximal NF-Y(CBF) CCAAT box element. In vitro analysis of the α2(I) collagen promoter region inclusive of the NF-Y(CBF) binding site (−106 to −65 base pairs) failed to identify any high affinity HMG-I(Y) DNA-binding sites. However, the heterotrimeric NF-Y complex, as well as the NF-YA subunit alone, was shown to stably interactin vitro with both HMG-I(Y) and phosphorylated HMG-I, as modified by casein kinase II, using far Western and protein-protein interaction solution assays in the absence of CCAAT box DNA. Furthermore, the interaction between HMG-I(Y) and NF-Y was mapped to the highly conserved DNA binding-subunit interaction domain (DBD) of the NF-YA subunit and to a single AT-hook motif in HMG-I(Y). Recombinant HMG-I was also found to stabilize the CCAAT box DNA binding activity of recombinant NF-Y, as well as the native NF-Y complex, in vitro. Together, these results suggest a functional HMG-I(Y) protein binding site has been identified in the NF-Y complex and mapped to the conserved DBD and AT-hook regions of NF-YA and HMG-I(Y), respectively. This protein-protein interaction site may function to modulate NF-Y activity through stabilization of NF-Y binding to its CCAAT box DNA-binding site. The mammalian transcription factor, NF-Y(CBF), contains three known subunit components, NF-YA (CBF-B), NF-YB(CBF-A), and NF-YC(CBF-C), which are all required to reconstitute specific CCAAT box DNA binding activity.

Furthermore, the interaction between HMG-I(Y) and NF-Y was mapped to the highly conserved DNA binding-subunit interaction domain (DBD) of the NF-YA subunit and to a single AT-hook motif in HMG-I(Y). Recombinant HMG-I was also found to stabilize the CCAAT box DNA binding activity of recombinant NF-Y, as well as the native NF-Y complex, in vitro. Together, these results suggest a functional HMG-I(Y) protein binding site has been identified in the NF-Y complex and mapped to the conserved DBD and AT-hook regions of NF-YA and HMG-I(Y), respectively. This protein-protein interaction site may function to modulate NF-Y activity through stabilization of NF-Y binding to its CCAAT box DNA-binding site.

Golumbek P.T. Karsenty G. de Crombrugghe B. Science. 1988; 241: 582-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), utilizes the highly conserved regions located in three heterologous subunits to create a DNA binding-subunit interaction domain (DBD) that specifically recognizes a CCAAT box motif found in the promoter and enhancer regions of many eukaryotic genes (3Benoist C. Mathis D. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1990; 8: 681-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). The Y box element of all murine major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II promoters, for example, contains a highly conserved inverted CCAAT DNA sequence whose conservation extends into the flanking regions, as well as its overall physical location in relation to the highly conserved 5′ X box element, and plays a critical role in MHC class II gene transcription (4Vilen B.J. Cogswell J.P. Ting J.P.-Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2406-2415Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The human and murine NF-YABC DBD elements have been strongly conserved in evolution (5Nakshatri H. Bhat-Nakshatri P. Currie R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28784-28791Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), are highly related to the corresponding regions in theSaccharomyces cerevisiae HAP2/3/5 CCAAT box factor complex, and can be functionally interchanged with these yeast subunits (6McNabb D.S.

A. 1995; 92: 1624-1628Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Recently, the DBD regions of the NF-YB and NF-YC subunits have been suggested to interact through a protein-protein histone-fold “handshake” motif (8Baxevanis A.D. Arents G. Moudrianakis E.N. Landsman D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 2685-2691Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 9Sinha S. Kim I.-S. Sohn K.-Y. de Crombrugghe B. Maity S.N. Mol. Cell.

Moudrianakis E.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10148-10152Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar). In addition, the NF-YA(CBF-B) subunit has been shown to interact with the NF-YB(CBF-A):NF-YC(CBF-C) heterodimer and neither of these subunits alone suggesting that a unique interaction structure for the NF-YA(CBF-B) subunit is created through conformational changes associated with dimerization of NF-YB(CBF-A):NF-YC(CBF-C) (7Sinha S. Maity S.N. Lu J. de Crombrugghe B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1624-1628Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). HMG-I(Y) belongs to a group of abundant low molecular mass non-histone chromosomal proteins that possess three copies of a reiterated 9-amino acid motif (the A·T hook) that interacts with the minor groove of many AT-rich DNA sequences (11Reeves R. Nissen M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8573-8582Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These proteins are soluble in 5% perchloric acid, resistant to heat denaturation, can alter DNA structure, and have been shown to be important regulators of gene transcription as well as involved in chromatin structure. HMG-I(Y) proteins are substrates for p34 cdc2 /cyclin B kinase (12Reeves R. Langan T.A. Nissen M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 1671-1675Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) and casein kinase II (CKII) (13Palvimo J. Linnala-Kankkunen A.

HMG-I(Y) DNA-binding sites have been identified in functional regions of many gene promoters which include interleukin-4 (15Chuvpilo S. Schomberg C. Gerwig R. Heinfling A. Reeves R. Grummt F. Serfling E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 5694-5704Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar), interleukin-2 receptor α-chain (16John S. Reeves R.B. Lin J.-X. Child R. Leiden J.M. Thompson C.B.

Reeves R. Frances-Shannon M. Immunity. 1996; 5: 479-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). These sites are often found in close proximity to the DNA-binding sites of known transcription factors (e.g. NF-κB (21Thanos D. Gregoriou M. Stravopodis D. Liapaki K. Makatounakis T. Papamatheakis J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 6010-6019Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar), Tst-1/Oct-6 (18Leger H. Sock E. Renner K. Grummt F. Wegner M. Mol. Cell.

Cell. 1993; 74: 887-898Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar, 23Thanos D. Maniatis T. Cell. 1992; 71: 777-789Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar, 24Thanos D. Maniatis T. Cell. 1995; 83: 1091-1100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (843) Google Scholar). In addition, HMG-I(Y) has been shown to bind to the basic leucine zipper region of activating transcription factor-2 (ATF-2195) which promotes the dimerization of this factor and stimulates its binding to the IFN-β promoter (25Du W. Maniatis T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11318-11322Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that HMG-I(Y) plays a critical role in IFN-β gene regulation through a combination of effects on transcription factor subunit interactions, factor binding stabilization, DNA bending, exclusion of specific factor DNA binding (e.g. ATF-2192) (25Du W. Maniatis T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11318-11322Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), and assembly of a multi-component enhanceosome (24Thanos D. Maniatis T.

Biol. 1995; 15: 3738-3747Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) through protein-protein interactions have been identified. These studies suggest these DNA-independent HMG-I(Y) protein binding sites also play important overall functional roles in modulating specific transcription factor transactivation potential. Type I collagen protein is composed of a heterotrimer of two α1 and one α2 subunits and is the predominant fibrillar collagen protein present in bones and tendons. The transcriptional regulatory elements of the murine α2(I) collagen promoter have been extensively investigated using both transient transfection, transgenic animal, andin vitro cell-free transcription approaches, and the proximal CCAAT box motif at −87 nucleotides has been shown to play an important functional role in its cellular regulation (26Coustry F. Maity S.N. de Crombrugghe B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 468-475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 27Goldberg H. Helaakoski T. Garrett L.A. Karsenty G. Pellegrino A.

In this report, the murine α2(I) collagen promoter and multimerized version of the α2(I) collagen NF-Y(CBF) binding site have been used to investigate the role of HMG-I(Y) as a protein cofactor in modulating NF-Y function. HMG-I has been shown to activate NF-Y in vivoand to interact with the highly conserved DBD region of NF-Y in vitro. These results represent the first report of an additional functional protein component associated with the NF-Y complex besides its core YA/B/C subunits and suggest that HMG-I(Y) may modulate NF-Y activity through direct association with the DBD in the NF-YA subunit. The α2(I) collagen promoter, pH6 (26Coustry F. Maity S.N. de Crombrugghe B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 468-475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), was used as template to generate a NF-Y(CBF) CCAAT box site-directed mutation with the Quick-Change mutagenesis technique as described by the manufacturer (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Both the wild-type and NF-Y mutant HindIII fragments, which contain the α2(I) collagen promoter derived from pH6, were isolated and cloned into the HindIII site of the pGL3 Luciferase vector (Promega) to generate pH6 GL3 and pH6m GL3, respectively. Cloning of full-length human and murine NF-YA, YB, and YC subunits into the pGEX2T vector (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) has been described previously (5Nakshatri H. Bhat-Nakshatri P. Currie R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28784-28791Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). BamHI-EcoRI fragments of each subunit were cloned into the pGEX2TK vector to generate pYA 2TK, pYB 2TK, and pYC 2TK. An NF-YA deletion mutant that lacks the C-terminal DBD was created by partially digesting pYA 2TK with BanII and EcoRI and sequentially treating the digestion products with the large subunit of DNA polymerase I (Klenow) and T4 DNA polymerase I under standard conditions to produce blunt ends (29Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The purified ∼5.6-kilobase pair pYA 2TK (BanII/EcoRI) fragment was ligated to itself, and recombinant plasmids that lacked the YA DBD element were identified to yield pYA 2TK(ΔDBD) which lacks the C-terminal 85 amino acids. The murine YA (DBD) and YB (DBD) elements were derived by polymerase chain reactions from pYA 2TK and pYB 2TK, respectively, as described previously (5Nakshatri H. Bhat-Nakshatri P. Currie R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28784-28791Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) and cloned in-frame with glutathioneS-transferase (GST) into the pGEX2TK BamHI site to generate pYA (DBD) 2TK and pYB(DBD) 2TK. The murine YA DBD element contains 69 amino acids and corresponds to nucleotides 873–1081, and the YB DBD element contains 90 amino acids and corresponds to nucleotides 366–635 as defined previously (30van Huijsduijnen R.H. Li X.Y. Black D. Matthes H. Benoist C. Mathis D. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3119-3127Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). To generate pYC(DBD) 2TK, human NF-YC (pYC 2T) was digested with BamHI andScaI, and the 430-bp YC(DBD) fragment was ligated in-frame with GST into the BamHI-SmaI sites of pGEX2TK. The human YC(DBD) plasmid contains the N-terminal 143 amino acids, nucleotides 1–430 as defined previously (5Nakshatri H. Bhat-Nakshatri P. Currie R.A. J. Biol.

Cloning of NF-YB(His-YB) and NF-YC(His-YC) into the pET15b vector (Novagen, Madison, WI) has been described previously (5Nakshatri H. Bhat-Nakshatri P. Currie R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28784-28791Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). NF-YA(His-YA) was cloned into the XhoI-BamHI sites of pET15b using polymerase chain reaction. Human HMG-I(His-HMG-I) was cloned by polymerase chain reaction using the GST-HMG-I plasmid (23Thanos D. Maniatis T. Cell. 1992; 71: 777-789Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar) as template into the BamHI site of pET15b. GST-HMG-I-(1–37) was prepared by digesting GST-HMG-I with SmaI andEcoRI and ligating the blunt-end vector following treatment with T4 DNA polymerase I and contains the N-terminal 37 amino acids. GST-PC4 was digested with BamHI, and the 275-bp PC4 fragment was cloned in-frame with GST into the BamHI site of pGEX 2TK to generate pPC4(ΔC103–127) 2TK which lacks the C-terminal 35 amino acids, nucleotides 277–384 as defined previously (31Ge H. Roeder R.G. Cell. 1994; 78: 513-523Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar).

Cells were harvested 48 h following transfection and assayed for both luciferase and β-galactosidase activities using the Dual-Light chemiluminescent reporter assay system as described by the manufacturer (Tropix, Inc., Bedford, MA). The following oligonucleotides were chemically synthesized (Life Technologies, Inc.); oligonucleotides used as DNA probes were prepared as described previously (36Currie R.A. Eckel R.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 298: 630-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The following oligonucleotides were used to generate the NF-Y(CBF) CCAAT box mutation in the α2(I) collagen promoter of pH6: 5′-TAGCCCTAGCCCTTCTAGAGGTGGAGACG-3′ and 5′-CGTCTCCACCTCTAGAAGGGCTAGGGCTA-3′, where the introducedXbaI site is underlined. The “small” murine α2(I) collagen proximal promoter NF-Y CCAAT probe (S-collagen) was prepared with 5′-GGCCCTAGCCCTCCCATTGGTGGAGACG-3′ and 5′-GGCGTCTCCACCAATGGGAGGGCTAGGG-3′. The “large” murine α2(I) collagen proximal promoter NF-Y CCAAT probe (L-collagen) was prepared with 5′-GGCCCCTAGCCCTAGCCCTCCCATTGGTGGAGACGTTTTTGG-3′ and 5′-GGCCAAAAACGTCTCCACCAATGGGAGGGCTAGGGCTAGGGG-3′.The murine MHC class II Eα CCAAT box probe (1Dorn A. Bollekens J. Staub A. Benoist C. Mathis D. Cell. 1987; 50: 863-872Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar) was prepared with 5′-GGCATTTTTCTGATTGGTTAAAAGTTGA-3′ and 5′-GGCTCAACTTTTAACCAATCAGAAAAAT-3′. The NF-Y(CBF) CCAAT box binding site motif has been underlined above in the S- and L-collagen and Eα DNA probes. The HMG-I(Y) binding site probe was derived from the human interferon-β (IFN-β) promoter PRDII element (23Thanos D. Maniatis T. Cell. 1992; 71: 777-789Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar) with 5-GGCGTGGGAAATTCCTCTGC-3′ and 5′-GGGCTGAGGAATTTCCCACG-3′. The known HMG-I(Y) DNA-binding site is underlined. Duplex oligomers were radiolabeled using the Klenow subunit and [α-32P]dCTP as described previously (36Currie R.A. Eckel R.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 298: 630-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Unincorporated dCTP was removed using NICK Spin G-50 columns (Pharmacia). Nuclear extracts were prepared by the method of Dignam et al. (37Dignam J.D. Lebowitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1488Crossref PubMed Scopus (9131) Google Scholar), as described previously (37Dignam J.D. Lebowitz R.M. Roeder R.G.

EMSA binding reactions (25 μl) were performed in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mmEDTA, 5% glycerol, and with or without 2 μg of the alternating copolymer, poly(dI-dC) (Pharmacia). Nuclear extract protein (∼2–10 μg) was added following addition of competitor DNA but prior to addition of ∼0.2 ng of specific 32P-labeled DNA probe. Binding reactions were performed at room temperature for a total of 30 min. Affinity purified α-YB and α-Oct-1 polyclonal antibodies were prepared as described previously (5Nakshatri H. Bhat-Nakshatri P. Currie R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28784-28791Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Anti-HMG-I polyclonal antibodies were kindly provided by D.

Cell. 1994; 78: 513-523Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Antisera were added to EMSA reactions either 15 min before or 15 min after the addition of32P-DNA probes depending on the experiment. Protein-DNA complexes were resolved using a 5% native polyacrylamide gel (30:1 acrylamide/bisacrylamide ratio) containing 0.5 × TBE (50 mm Tris-HCl, 50 mm boric acid, 1 mmEDTA). Gels were electrophoresed at ∼150 V at room temperature for 1.5 h. Dried gels were exposed to Kodak XAR-5 film with an intensifying screen at −80 °C. HeLa nuclear extracts were depleted of HMG-I activity by first passing nuclear extracts over DEAE-Sepharose Fast Flow (Sigma) which had been equilibrated in BC-420 (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 0.42m KCl, 20% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The flow-through fraction was dialyzed extensively against several changes of BC-420 using a Spectra/Por 6 (25-kDa cutoff) membrane (Spectrum, Houston, TX). Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation; the supernatant was diluted to 0.1 m KCl with BC buffer and then applied to a heparin-agarose column. The column was developed using a step KCl gradient, and NF-Y was eluted in the BC-420 fraction (0.42 m KCl). This fraction was further dialyzed against BC-100 and stored in aliquots at −80 °C. Depleted HeLa nuclear extracts retain NF-Y but lack HMG-I(Y) DNA binding activity as measured by EMSA using the IFN-β probe. To prepare the HeLa YAF fraction HeLa nuclear extracts were passed over DEAE in 0.42m KCl as described above, and then the flow-through fractions were centrifuged through Centricon 30 filtration devices (Amicon, Beverly, MA). The filtrate fraction was diluted to 0.1m KCl and the buffer exchanged to BC-100 using Centricon 3 filtration devices (Amicon). The HeLa YAF fraction is devoid of NF-YA, −YB, and −YC activities as measured by recombination experiments using complementing combinations of recombinant NF-Y subunits in EMSA. 2R. A.

An NF-Y CCAAT box DNA affinity column was prepared by coupling a monomeric murine α2(I) collagen CCAAT DNA oligomer to CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B (Pharmacia) according to the manufacturer. NF-Y was further purified by passing HeLa-depleted nuclear extracts over this CCAAT box DNA affinity column in the presence of the nonspecific DNA competitor, poly(dI-dC) (39Briggs M.R Kadonaga J.T. Bell S.P. Tjian R. Science. 1986; 234: 47-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (1051) Google Scholar). The column was developed using a step KCl (BC buffer) gradient, and NF-Y was eluted in the BC-420 fraction. This material was concentrated and the buffer exchanged to BC-100 using Centricon 10 filtration devices (Amicon). Protein concentrations were determined using the Bradford dye-binding assay (Bio-Rad) with bovine serum albumin (BSA) as the standard (40Bradford M.M. Anal.

GST-YA, GST-YA(ΔDBD), GST-YA(DBD), GST-YC(DBD), and GST 2TK were expressed and purified from the soluble fraction of Escherichia coliDH5α lysates as described by Smith and Johnson (41Smith D.B. Johnson K.S. Gene (Amst .). 1988; 67: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (5026) Google Scholar). GST-YC was induced for 20 min at 37 °C using 1 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside as described previously (7Sinha S. Maity S.N. Lu J. de Crombrugghe B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

His-YA was purified from the soluble fraction of E. coli BL21(DE3) after induction with 1 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 3 h at 37 °C using Ni2+ ion affinity chromatography (Novagen). His-HMG-I was purified from the soluble fraction of BL21(DE3) after induction with 1 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 1 h at 37 °C with the following modifications. Crude bacterial lysates were first heated to 65 °C for 10 min, cooled on ice for 20 min, then centrifuged at 10,000 rpm in a SS34 rotor (Dupont, Wilmington, DE) for 20 min at 4 °C. The supernatant fraction was made 5% in perchloric acid, left at room temperature for 10 min, and then centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. The pH of the supernatant was adjusted to 7.5 with 10 n NaOH and then dialyzed against 1 × PBS at 4 °C for 3 h using a Spectra Por 6 (8-kDa cutoff) membrane (Spectrum). His-HMG-I was further purified by Ni2+ ion affinity chromatography (Novagen) and passage through a Centricon 30 filtration device (Amicon, Beverly, MA) in BC-420. The filtrate fraction was concentrated using a Centricon 10 device and the buffer exchanged to BC-100. Recombinant protein purity was assessed using Coomassie Blue staining of SDS-PAGE gels, and purified fractions were stored at −80 °C. pGEX2TK fusion proteins were labeled using heart muscle creatine kinase (HMK) (Sigma) and [γ-32P]ATP (DuPont) as described for GST expressed from pGEX 2TK (Pharmacia). Unincorporated 32P label was removed by passing the reaction mixture over a CentriSep spin column according to the manufacturer (Princeton Separations, Adelphia, NJ).

The protozoan parasite Leishmania is responsible for a wide spectrum of human diseases that cause varying degrees of patient morbidity and mortality and affect more than 12 million people world-wide. Leishmania have a relatively simple life cycle, existing as extracellular flagellated promastigotes in the sandfly vector and following transmission to a mammalian host, as intracellular aflagellated amastigotes in macrophages (1$$Google Scholar). Throughout its life cycle, Leishmania encounter hostile, changing environments that require rapid responses to ensure survival of the parasites (1$$Google Scholar, 2Zilberstein D. Shapira M. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1994; 48: 449-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). In eukaryotes, protein phosphorylation is a major mechanism for regulating cellular responses to environmental signals, including cell-cell interactions.

Cell. 1995; 80: 225-236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2568) Google Scholar). Less is known about the functions of externally oriented cell surface PK (ecto-PK), although the potential for their involvement in signal transduction and cell-cell interactions appears great. These ecto-PK utilize extracellular ATP that is present in blood plasma and other body fluids at concentrations from 1 to 30 μm (4Gordon J.L. Biochem. J. 1986; 233: 309-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (1393) Google Scholar). Ecto-enzymes have been demonstrated in a variety of cultured cells, including HeLa cells, fibroblasts, neutrophils, neurons, and others (5Vilgrain I. Baird A. Mol.

Biophys. 1995; 316: 780-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Ecto-PK are capable of phosphorylating both endogenous membrane and exogenous foreign substrates. We have identified a cyclic nucleotide-independent ecto-PK activity on viable Leishmania major promastigotes that phosphorylate exogenous substrates, such as mixed histones and protamine sulfate, in addition to 11 endogenous parasite membrane proteins (12Lester D.S. Hermoso T. Jaffe C.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1052: 293-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Live parasites can also phosphorylate the C3 and C3b polypeptide components of the human complement system (13Hermoso T. Fishelson Z. Becker S.I. Hirschberg K. Jaffe C.L. EMBO J. 1991; 13: 4061-4067Crossref Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of C3 was shown to inactivate both the alternative and classical complement pathways (14Forsberg P.-O. Martin S.C. Nilsson B. Ekman P. Nilsson U.R. Engstrom L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2941-2946Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and thus may play an important role in parasite survival. In addition, the inducible release or shedding of ecto-PK in the presence of enzyme substrates has been described for specific PK on the surface of HeLa cells, endothelial cells, fibroblasts, neutrophils, and other cells (6Walter J. Schnolzer M. Pyerin W. Kinzel V. Kubler D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 111-119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 7Skubitz K.M. Ehresmann D.D. Ducker T.P. J.

This activity appears to be similar to casein kinases and was recently purified from HeLa cells and characterized as casein kinase 1 (CK1) and casein kinase 2 (CK2, see Ref. 6Walter J. Schnolzer M.

In this study we show for the first time that parasites are capable of shedding ecto-PK. At least two leishmanial ecto-PK released by promastigotes were identified as follows: first, an ecto-PK that is shed constitutively and phosphorylates phosvitin; and second, an enzyme released by incubation with PK substrates that phosphorylates protamine sulfate. The constitutively shed enzyme was characterized and shown to be CK1-like. These findings will allow us to further characterize the properties and roles of ecto-PK and the possible ramifications of these enzymes on host-parasite interactions. The CK-specific inhibitors, CKI-7 and CKI-8, were purchased from Seikagaku America (St. Petersburg, FL). The CK1- and CK2-specific peptides, RRKDLHDDEEDEAMSITA and RRRADDSDDDDD, respectively, used in the phosphorylation assays were generous gifts from Dr. L. Pinna (University of Padova, Italy). All the other PK inhibitors, protein substrates, and reagents were purchased from Sigma. P-81 phosphocellulose paper was obtained from Whatman Scientific Ltd. (United Kingdom). Rat liver CK2 was purchased from the Promega Corp. (Madison, WI). Stationary phase L. major(MHOM/IL/80/Friedlin) promastigotes were used in all studies. Promastigotes were cultured in Schneider's Drosophilamedium containing 10% fetal calf serum and antibiotics (complete medium, see Ref. 17Jaffe C.L. Grimaldi G. McMahon-Pratt D. Morel C.M. Genes and Antigens of Parasites: A Laboratory Manual. UNDP/WHO/World Bank, Rio de Janeiro1984: 47-91Google Scholar). The B4 clone was isolated by limiting dilution cloning on 1% agar plates made with complete medium (17Jaffe C.L. Grimaldi G. McMahon-Pratt D. Morel C.M. Genes and Antigens of Parasites: A Laboratory Manual. UNDP/WHO/World Bank, Rio de Janeiro1984: 47-91Google Scholar). Virulent cloned parasites were maintained by serial passage in BALB/c mice and obtained as required by needle aspiration from lesions. Parasites were maintained in culture for not more than 12 passages. Viable promastigotes were washed once by centrifugation (10 min, 600 × g) with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm glucose, and 10 mm NaF (buffer A). The parasites were resuspended at 5 × 108 cells/ml in buffer A (100 μl) with or without substrate (1 mg/ml phosvitin, hydrolyzed or intact casein, or bovine serum albumin). The cells were layered over di-N-butyl phthalate (150 μl) and incubated for 20 min at 30 °C. The promastigotes were removed by rapid centrifugation in a Microfuge (Beckman model B, for 1 min), and the supernatants were used for phosphorylation assays. Released ecto-PK activity was measured in cell-free supernatants, prepared as described above, by adding PK substrates, [γ-32P]ATP (1–10 μCi) and 0.1 mm cold ATP. The reactions were incubated for 10–20 min at 30 °C and stopped by the addition of ice-cold trichloroacetic acid (1 ml, 25%). After 30 min on ice protein phosphorylation was analyzed by either filtration or sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). In the former case, the trichloroacetic acid precipitates were collected on Millipore HAWP filters (0.45 μm), washed four times with ice-cold 5% trichloroacetic acid (2 ml each), and counted in a β-scintillation counter. For gel electrophoresis, the precipitate was collected by centrifugation and washed with 5% trichloroacetic acid (once) and 90% acetone (three times). The pellet was resuspended in sample buffer, analyzed by 12% SDS-PAGE, and exposed to x-ray film or phosphorimaging. Quantitation of the phosphorylation was carried out by densitometric analysis of the bands. The protein substrates and concentrations used are indicated in the figure legends. Phosphorylation by live promastigotes. Parasites were washed once by centrifugation with buffer A and resuspended at 5 × 108 cells/ml in buffer A (100 μl). Cells were preincubated at 30 °C with or without the PK substrates for 2–5 min, and the reaction was initiated by addition of [γ-32P]ATP (1–10 μCi) and 0.1 mm cold ATP. After 10–20 min incubation the reactions were stopped by adding trichloroacetic acid and analyzed by filtration and SDS-PAGE as described above. Phosphorylation of specific peptide substrates for CK1 or CK2 using cell-free supernatants was carried out as described above with the following modifications. The reaction was stopped by the addition of ice-cold 100% trichloroacetic acid (24 μl) and 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA, 40 μl), and co-precipitated on ice (30 min). After centrifugation, samples from the supernatant (20 μl in triplicate) were spotted on P-81 ion exchange chromatography phosphocellulose paper (Whatman Scientific Ltd., UK) and washed three times in 75 mm phosphoric acid (500 ml, 5 min each wash) to remove the unbound phosphate. The paper was dried and 32P incorporation was measured in a β-scintillation counter. Promastigote viability was assessed by two complementary assays as follows: ethidium bromide (EtBr) incorporation, which measures the percentage of dead or damaged cells; and fluorescein diacetate hydrolysis, which measures the percentage of viable cells. Fluorescein diacetate hydrolysis (18Jackson P.R. Pappas M.G. Hansen B.D. Science. 1985; 227: 435-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) was tested in selected experiments; however, the EtBr assay (19Dey C.S. Majumder G.C. Biochem. Int. 1988; 17: 367-374PubMed Google Scholar), described below, was used in all experiments. To determine the effect of each treatment on cell viability, promastigotes (5 × 107 cells/200 μl buffer A) were incubated in parallel under identical conditions, except for [γ-32P]ATP, to those described above. At the beginning and end of each incubation 2.3 ml of buffer A containing 50 μm EtBr was added, and the fluorescence was measured 5 min later in a fluorescent spectrophotometer (Perkin-Elmer LS-5B Luminescence Spectrometer, 365 nm excitation, 580 nm emission). Buffer A containing 50 μm EtBr served as the blank. A standard curve using increasing numbers of promastigotes (5–500 × 105) in buffer A containing digitonin (30 μg/ml) and EtBr (50 μm) was used to calculate the number of dead parasites. In some cases, the percentage of dead or damaged parasites was also determined by counting fluorescent and total parasites using a fluorescent phase microscope (Laborlux K; Leitz, Germany) at 400 × magnification. Stock solutions of the PK inhibitors heparin, CKI-7, CKI-8, staurosporine, H-7, and W-7 were prepared in dimethyl sulfoxide or distilled water. The inhibitors or dimethyl sulfoxide alone were diluted with buffer A and added to the reactions just before use. Phosphorylation of the PK substrates and analysis of the reactions by either filtration or SDS-PAGE was carried out as described previously. The final concentrations of inhibitors examined are given in the text. The phosphorylation of different PK substrates or BSA was examined using viable L. major stationary phase promastigotes. After a 20-min incubation with [γ-32P]ATP substrate, phosphorylation was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography (Fig. 1 and results not shown). Leishmanial ecto-PK(s) are capable of phosphorylating several different exogenous substrates, including protamine sulfate (PS), phosvitin, hydrolyzed casein (h-casein), intact casein (i-casein), and mixed histones (Fig. 1, data not shown and Ref. 12Lester D.S. Hermoso T. Jaffe C.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1052: 293-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Different phosphorylation patterns were observed for each PK substrate used. When phosvitin (lane 2) was added to the reaction mixture, one major radiolabeled band, 35 kDa, corresponding to the substrate molecular mass was observed. Likewise, when PS was added to the reaction mixture a major phosphorylated band at about 14 kDa, corresponding to this protein (lane 1), was seen. Phosphorylation of h- or i-casein gave as expected multiple bands or a major band at 29 kDa, respectively (lane 4 and data not shown). When BSA was used as an exogenous substrate, no protein phosphorylation was observed (lane 5). The only radioactive product observed using BSA was a band that migrated with the tracking dye. This band appears in all the reactions, including those without substrate (lane 3), and may represent phosphorylation of parasite lipids or small peptides. Endogenous phosphorylation of parasite proteins was only observed in the absence of foreign substrates and following extensive exposure of the gels (data not shown and Ref. 12Lester D.S. Hermoso T. Jaffe C.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1052: 293-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The additional high molecular weight bands observed when PS was used were not investigated but are probably due to protein impurities, since these bands were not observed in preliminary experiments when PS from an alternative commercial source was used (Ref. 12Lester D.S. Hermoso T. Jaffe C.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1052: 293-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar and data not shown). Parasite viability was measured by both EtBr fluorescence and fluorescein diacetate hydrolysis. In the absence of substrates, promastigote viability after 15 min at 30 °C was never less than 97%, as measured by both methods, and remained essentially unchanged up to 35 min incubation. Incubation of the promastigotes with either PS, h-casein, or phosvitin for 25–35 min resulted in an 11, 2.5, and 0%, respectively, decrease in parasite viability compared with those incubated in buffer alone. Effects on parasite viability were already seen by 5 min incubation with the substrate, and essentially no additional change in viability (<1%) was noted with increasing time using any of the PK substrates. Similar differences in PK substrate toxicity for cells have been reported with HeLa cells, neutrophils, and fibroblasts (5Vilgrain I. Baird A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1991; 5: 1003-1012Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 7Skubitz K.M. Ehresmann D.D. Ducker T.P. J. Immunol. 1991; 147: 638-650PubMed Google Scholar, 8Kubler D. Pyerin W. Bill O. Hotz A. Sonka J. Kinzel V. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 14549-14555Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Incubation of neutrophils, HeLa cells, and fibroblasts with substrates for PK was shown to induce the release of PK activity from these cells. This activity could be detected in the cell-free supernatants (7Skubitz K.M. Ehresmann D.D. Ducker T.P. J. Immunol. 1991; 147: 638-650PubMed Google Scholar, 11Paas Y. Fishelson Z. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 316: 780-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 15Hartmann M. Schrader J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1136: 189-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar,16Kubler D. Pyerin W. Burow E. Kinzel V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 4021-4025Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Therefore, we decided to test if phosphorylation of exogenous substrates observed using live parasites was due to enzyme release by the cells. Promastigotes were washed and incubated with or without h-casein for 20 min. After removal of the cells by centrifugation through an oil layer, PK activity of the supernatants was assayed by adding PS where indicated (Fig. 2;lanes 1–5). Preincubation of promastigotes with h-casein resulted in the release of a PK that phosphorylates both h-casein and PS (lanes 1 and4). Shedding of the PS phosphorylating activity by the cells required parasite preincubation with h-casein, since no phosphorylation of PS was observed when the parasites were preincubated in buffer alone (lane 2). Preincubation of promastigotes with other PK substrates, including i-casein, phosvitin, or PS, also caused the shedding of a PK activity that could phosphorylate PS. However, no phosphorylation of PS was observed if supernatants from parasites incubated with BSA were used (data not shown). The labeled bands seen in lanes 1 and 4 are not due to phosphorylation of endogenous secreted parasite proteins, since no radiolabeled bands were observed if supernatant alone was used in the phosphorylation reactions (lane 5). Likewise, PS was not phosphorylated when added to the reaction mixture in the absence of supernatants collected from h-casein-treated promastigotes (lane 3). Shedding of the PK that phosphorylates PS requires promastigote preincubation with h-casein. However, it was not clear whether h-casein phosphorylation (Fig. 2, lane 1) required parasite preincubation with substrate, “induced release,” or if this PK activity was constitutively released by the parasites. Cell-free supernatants were collected from promastigotes incubated with or without h-casein (Fig. 2, lanes 6 and 7). Substrate was added to supernatant obtained from parasites incubated in buffer alone and the phosphorylation reaction carried out. Phosphorylation of h-casein was seen when either procedure was used and did not depend on whether the parasites were incubated with the substrate prior to collection of the supernatant. These results demonstrate that the PK activity that phosphorylates h-casein is constitutively released from the leishmanial parasites. However, phosphorylation of h-casein using supernatants collected from parasites preincubated with substrate was 70% greater than those only incubated with buffer (lanes 6 and 7), suggesting that incubation with casein may induce release of a PK activity capable of phosphorylating h-casein. These findings suggest that at least two different kinase activities are released from intact cells: 1) “substrate-inducible” activity that phosphorylates PS and perhaps h-casein; and 2) a “constitutive” activity that only phosphorylates h-casein and not PS. The “constitutively” shed leishmanial CK-like activity, LCK, was characterized further. Enzyme activity of cell-free supernatants, collected from promastigotes incubated with buffer alone, was measured using several different PK substrates, including h-casein, i-casein, phosvitin, mixed histones, PS, and BSA. Phosphorylation was examined by SDS-PAGE (Fig.3 and data not shown). Phosvitin was the best substrate for the constitutively released PK (lane 3), followed by h-casein (lane 1) and i-casein (lane 2). No phosphorylation of PS (Fig. 2, lane 2), mixed histones, or BSA (Fig. 3, lanes 4 and 5, respectively) was observed. Likewise, no endogenous phosphorylation of parasite proteins in the supernatant was observed (lane 6). Several different PK inhibitors, including staurosporine, W-7, heparin, CKI-7 and CKI-8, were examined for their ability to block phosvitin phosphorylation. The antibiotic staurosporine, a competitive inhibitor of ATP binding to PK, inhibits a wide range of enzymes, including PKC, PKA, and Ca2+-calmodulin PK, at nanomolar concentrations. Unlike most PK, CK are less sensitive to staurosporine, and the IC50 for CK1 and CK2 is 163 and 19 μm, respectively (20Meggio F. Deana A.D. Ruzzene M. Brunati A.M. Cesaro L. Guerra B. Meyer T. Mett H. Fabbro D. Furet P. Dobrowolska G. Pinna L.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 234: 317-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). The IC50 found for the leishmanial CK (LCK), 5 μm, is similar to CK2. Heparin has been used to distinguish between the two CKs (21Corbin J.D. Hardman J.G. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 99: 317-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). CK2 is strongly inhibited at approximately 1% the concentration that inhibits CK1 (IC50 − CK1 = 24 μg/ml; CK2 = 0.15 μg/ml). Phosphorylation of phosvitin by LCK was measured in the presence of different concentrations of heparin (Fig.4). This curve shows that relatively high concentrations of heparin (IC50 = 50 μg/ml), more similar to CK1, are needed to inhibit the leishmanial enzyme's activity. In addition to heparin, the effect of CKI-7, an isoquinoline derivative of W-7, on phosvitin phosphorylation was also examined. CKI-7 is a specific inhibitor of CK1 and CK2 (IC50 − CK1 = 9.5 μm; CK2 = 90 μm; see Ref. 22Chijiwa T. Hagiwara M. Hidaka H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4924-4927Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The IC50 for other common PK, such as PKA, PKC, and Ca2+-calmodulin PK, is much higher, 550, >1000, and 195 μm, than for CK. The IC50 found for LCK was 75 μm, closer to that observed for mammalian CK2. Taken together the results using PK inhibitors and substrate specificity strongly suggests that the shed leishmanial enzyme is a CK. LCK was also inhibited by W-7 (IC50 − 10 μm). The constitutively released LCK activity and total cellular CK activity were further characterized in four separate experiments using peptides specific for either CK1 (RRKDLHDDEEDEAMSITA) or CK2 (RRRADDSDDDDD; Ref. 23Marin O. Meggio F. Pinna L.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 198: 898-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Results typical of these experiments are give in Table I. Phosphorylation of the peptides using parasite lysates, either freeze/thawed or sonicated, showed that both enzymes are present in the parasite (Table I and data not shown). The total activity found in the promastigote lysates for CK1 was approximately 2.6-fold higher than CK2.Table IPhosphorylation of casein kinase (CK) peptide substrates by leishmanial protein kinasesEnzyme sourcePeptides phosphorylation rate (Δ cpm)1-aΔ cpm = (cpm reaction mixture − cpm without peptide).CK1CK2Shed cLPK653 ± 1341 ± 0Lysed parasites6697 ± 3272448 ± 156Intact parasites368 ± 1031 ± 0Pure rat liver CK239 ± 40580 ± 49Shed cLPK, promastigotes (5 × 107/100 μl) were incubated for 20 min at 30 °C and removed by centrifuging through an oil layer.

When peptide phosphorylation was examined using cell-free supernatants as a source of LCK, the activity was significantly lower than that measured using parasite lysates. In some experiments both CK-specific peptides were phosphorylated (data not shown). However, the CK1 activity was consistently higher, up to 650 times greater, than the CK2 activity (Table I). Phosphorylation of the CK-specific peptides using intact promastigotes gave results similar to that found using the cell-free supernatants. These results strongly suggest that the constitutively released leishmanial enzyme is CK1-like. Furthermore, the finding of high CK1 activity in the cell-free supernatant (9.6% of the parasite lysate) and little or no CK2 activity suggests that the released activity is not due to cell lysis. Promastigote viability in buffer A was >97% over 20 min. Release of the CK-like activity over time was followed for 30 min. At each time point, aliquots containing parasites in buffer alone were removed and cell-free supernatants prepared. In parallel, the percentage of dead promastigotes was measured using the EtBr assay. CK-like activity was assayed using phosvitin as substrate and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and densitometry. Results from one typical experiment is shown in Fig.5. PK activity shed by the parasites into the buffer increased dramatically over the first 10 min of incubation (600%). After peaking, the activity measured in the cell-free supernatants slowly decreased, until it appeared to level off after 25 min at twice the initial activity. The initial time point (t = 0 min) was obtained by adding parasites to buffer and then immediately centrifuging to prepare a cell-free supernatant. All time points were compared with a negative control, phosvitin, in labeling buffer without supernatant. The percentage of dead promastigotes was examined in parallel by EtBr staining and showed no change in parasite viability over the first 15 min in labeling buffer (98% viable; t = 0 and 15 min) and only a small decrease after 30 min (96% viable). The difference in kinetics of CK secretion and change in parasite viability further excludes the possibility that the PK release observed is a result of cell damage. Many eukaryotic cells possess ecto-PK that are capable of phosphorylating foreign and endogenous protein substrates. PK identified include PKC, PKA, CK1, and CK2. In addition, several vertebrate cells were shown to shed ecto-PK from their surface in the presence of PK substrates like phosvitin or casein. Although most cells examined appear to release cyclic nucleotide independent CK, the release of PKA or PKC has been documented in only a few cases. Parasites have evolved varied strategies to evade host defense mechanisms including the mimicry of host regulatory molecules and enzymes. Leishmania promastigotes also express ecto-PK on their surface that phosphorylate foreign proteins (24Hermoso T. Jaffe C.L. Tapia F.J. CaceresDittmar G. Sachez M.A. Molecular and Immune Mechanisms in the Pathogenesis of Cutaneous Leishmaniasis. R. G. Landes Co., Austin, Texas1996: 71-87Google Scholar). Previous studies showed little or no evidence that the parasite ecto-PK activity was related to PKA or PKC, respectively. Activators and inhibitors of these enzymes had no significant effect on the phosphorylation of exogenous or endogenous substrates (Ref. 12Lester D.S. Hermoso T. Jaffe C.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1052: 293-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar and data not shown). However, comparative studies between live parasites, which phosphorylate the C3 and C3b polypeptides of the human complement system, and LPK-1, a purified parasite enzyme, which only phosphorylates C3, but not C3b, suggested that promastigotes possess more than one ecto-PK (13Hermoso T. Fishelson Z. Becker S.I. Hirschberg K. Jaffe C.L. EMBO J. 1991; 13: 4061-4067Crossref Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Preliminary experiments show that the constitutively shed leishmanial PK, LCK, phosphorylates C3a (data not shown). Interestingly, a casein kinase shed from human platelets following activation was shown to phosphorylate both C3 and C3b (25Ekdahl K.N. Nilsson B. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 6502-6510PubMed Google Scholar). To obtain a better understanding of the role of ecto-PK in host-parasite interactions, it will be necessary to characterize parasite ecto-enzymes and the physiological substrates involved in these processes. In this study we demonstrate that Leishmania promastigotes have at least two types of ecto-PK, both of which can be released by the parasites. Unlike most cells examined so far, one type of activity appears to be shed continuously in the absence of substrate, whereas the second activity, similar to other eukaryotic cells, is shed only when incubated with substrate. These activities, constitutive and induced, are easily distinguished by their ability to phosphorylate PS, since the former enzyme(s) shows no activity when assayed with this substrate, and the latter readily phosphorylates PS. These shed ecto-PK are not due to cytoplasmic leakage from damaged or dead cells. Although both histone and PS are cytotoxic for eukaryotic cells (5Vilgrain I. Baird A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1991; 5: 1003-1012Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 16Kubler D. Pyerin W. Burow E. Kinzel V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cell Biol. 1982; 26: 306-309PubMed Google Scholar) and parasites, little or no cytotoxicity was found when cells (5Vilgrain I. Baird A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1991; 5: 1003-1012Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 7Skubitz K.M. Ehresmann D.D. Ducker T.P. J. Immunol. 1991; 147: 638-650PubMed Google Scholar, 16Kubler D. Pyerin W. Burow E.

Cell Biol. 1982; 26: 306-309PubMed Google Scholar) or parasites were incubated with phosvitin or casein. Initial parasite viability in the studies described herein always exceeded 97%, as measured by two fluorescent assays, and changed by <2% following incubation either in the presence or absence of casein or phosvitin. This percentage was identical to that found following incubation with buffer alone. The small amount of dead parasites was not responsible for the induced PK activity observed, since no phosphorylation of PS was noted using cell-free supernatants from promastigotes incubated either with BSA or buffer alone, whereas good phosphorylation of PS was found with as little as 2.5 × 106 freeze/thawed parasites (data not shown). Furthermore, no correlation was found between the release of constitutive ecto-PK activity in the cell-free supernatants and decreasing cell viability. Ecto-PK activity peaked rapidly at 10 min and then gradually decreased with time, whereas cell viability remained essentially constant over the first 15 min and then decreased only slightly, by 2%, after 30 min. We decided to focus on the characterization of the constitutively shed leishmanial ecto-PK activity that appears to be related to casein kinases. Substrate specificity was typical of these enzymes. Phosvitin, followed by h-casein and i-casein, was the best substrate for the enzyme(s), and neither mixed histones nor PS were phosphorylated by the ecto-PK. The parasite activity is different from a spontaneously shed human leukemic cell line serine/threonine ecto-PK that was recently reported (11Paas Y. Fishelson Z. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 316: 780-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The latter activity phosphorylates PS and histone H2B, as well as casein, phosvitin, and the human complement polypeptide C9, and may contain more than one PK. PKI, a specific PKA inhibitor, was found to inhibit the phosphorylation of histone H2B but not C9 by the leukemic cell ecto-PK. The latter activity was postulated to be CK-like. Little evidence was found in our study or previous studies for either an intracellular or externally oriented leishmanial PKA (12Lester D.S. Hermoso T. Jaffe C.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1052: 293-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). However, we have recently cloned and characterized the genes for two PKA catalytic subunits from L. major (27Siman-Tov M.M. Aly R. Shapira M. Jaffe C.L. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 77: 201-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The effect of several PK inhibitors on the leishmanial ecto-PK was examined. Unlike most PK that are inhibited by nanomolar concentrations of staurosporine (20Meggio F. Deana A.D. Ruzzene M. Brunati A.M. Cesaro L. Guerra B. Meyer T. Mett H. Fabbro D. Furet P. Dobrowolska G. Pinna L.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 234: 317-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar), the IC50 values for casein kinases are in the μm range (CK1 and CK2, 163 and 19 μm, respectively). The IC50 value for the leishmanial ecto-PK (5 μm) was similar to CK2. The high concentration of drug need to inhibit the leishmanial activity is not due to the intrinsic resistance of parasite enzymes to staurosporine. The phosphorylation of PS by Leishmania aethiopicapromastigotes, either particulate or soluble fractions or live parasites, is strongly inhibited by staurosporine. Low concentrations of drug (50 nm) inhibited the phosphorylation of PS by >80% when parasite fractions were used and by approximately 45% using live parasites (28Assefa D. Worku Y. Skoglund G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1270: 157-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Furthermore, staurosporine concentrations similar to those that inhibit the constitutively shed ecto-PK are cytostatic and/or cytotoxic to the promastigotes and induce pronounced morphological changes (29Becker S. Jaffe C.L. Parasitol. Res. 1997; 83: 273-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Heparin and CKI-7, both specific CK inhibitors, also blocked the leishmanial ecto-PK activity at concentrations similar to those reported for mammalian and yeast CK and confirmed that the constitutively shed parasite enzyme is CK-like. However, no conclusion regarding the type of CK in the cell-free supernatants could be made based on IC50 values for these inhibitors, since the constants found using heparin or CKI-7 each implicated the presence of a different CK, either CK1 or CK2, respectively. Interestingly, heparin concentrations (10 μm) similar to those that inhibit LCK were also shown to significantly reduce endogenous protein phosphorylation by live parasites (30Mukhopadhyay N.K. Shome K. Saha A.K. Hassell J.R. Glew R.H. Biochem. J. 1989; 264: 519-525Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Finally, we were able to identify the constitutively shed PK by examining the phosphorylation of specific peptide substrates for CK1 and CK2. Only the CK1-specific peptide substrate was phosphorylated confirming that the constitutively shed LCK activity is CK1-like. This conclusion was further supported by the finding that the LCK, similar to other CK1, only utilizes ATP, whereas CK2 utilizes both ATP and GTP for phosphorylation (data not shown). Although spontaneously shed ecto-PK activity has not been observed with cell-free supernatants from HeLa cells or neutrophils (7Skubitz K.M. Ehresmann D.D. Ducker T.P. J. Immunol. 1991; 147: 638-650PubMed Google Scholar, 16Kubler D. Pyerin W. Burow E. Kinzel V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 4021-4025Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), ecto-CK released from HeLa cells by incubation with phosvitin were recently purified and characterized (6Walter J. Schnolzer M. Pyerin W. Kinzel V. Kubler D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 111-119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Differences in the sensitivity of the leishmanial and mammalian ecto-PK to different inhibitors suggest that it may be possible to design drugs that specifically inhibit the parasite but not the host enzymes. However, this will require the purification and characterization of the parasite enzyme(s). The CK1 family has been found in all eukaryotic cells examined so far and is believed to be involved in the regulation of nuclear and cytoplasmic processes. These PK consist of monomeric proteins that vary considerably in size from 25 to 55 kDa and have been found in the nucleus, cytoplasm, membrane, and cytoskeleton. Several different isoforms of CK1 have been identified in mammalian cells and yeast using molecular techniques. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae two essential genes have been sequenced and found to encode a carboxyl-terminal prenylation motif, believed to target them to the plasma membrane. Using a nested polymerase chain reaction with degenerate oligonucleotides to conserved regions of CK1, we have amplified a 342-base pair fragment from L. major that shows 74.4% identity over 336 base pairs to human CK1-ε. 2N. Sacerdoti-Sierra and C. L. Jaffe, unpublished data. We expect that molecular analysis of the leishmanial-CK1 gene (lck1), the recent availability of molecular techniques for the production of nullLeishmania mutants, and further biochemical characterization of parasite ecto-PK will prove invaluable in understanding the role of these enzymes in parasite-host interactions."
https://openalex.org/W2007828956,"In polarized cells, newly synthesized proteins are sorted in the trans-Golgi network and from there delivered to either the apical or basolateral membranes. Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells have been widely used as a model system to study sorting determinants to the apical and basolateral surfaces. Whereas sorting signals for basolateral transmembrane proteins seem to reside in their cytoplasmic domains, apical determinants appear to reside in the N-glycans of secretory proteins or in the glycolipid tails of glycosylphosphatidylinositol-linked proteins. We show in this study that a surface-expressed form of CD3-ε, a nonglycosylated type I membrane protein, is exclusively targeted to the apical membrane in MDCK cells by a glycolipid-independent transport pathway. Deletion of the cytoplasmic tail does not affect its distribution, whereas deletion of the transmembrane domain results in secretion from both surfaces although still predominantly through the apical membrane. The transmembrane domain of CD3-ε appended to rat growth hormone, a secretory protein that lacks apical and basolateral determinants, promotes basolateral localization of the chimeric protein. However, a growth hormone chimera containing both the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of CD3-ε resulted in localization to the apical and basolateral membranes. These results suggest there are multiple determinants in CD3-ε that affect its distribution in polarized MDCK cells.

Whereas the transmembrane domain contains a basolateral determinant, the ectodomain and the cytoplasmic domain contain apical determinants. The elucidation of the molecular mechanisms used by animal cells to generate and maintain an asymmetric distribution of cell surface components is one of the central focuses in cell biology (1Eaton S. Simons K. Cell. 1995; 82: 5-8Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 2Drubin D.G. Nelson W.J.

The renal epithelial MDCK 1The abbreviations used are: MDCK, Madin-Darby canine kidney; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; GH, growth hormone; GPI, glycosylphosphatidylinositol; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; TM, transmembrane domain; TMC, transmembrane and cytosolic domains; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid. cell line has been widely chosen as a model for the study of cell polarity because of its capability to differentiate apical and basolateral membrane domains (3Rodriguez-Boulan E. Powell S.K. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 395-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). Whereas it is established that sorting to the basolateral membrane is mediated by signals in the cytoplasmic tail of transmembrane proteins, the molecular mechanism of apical sorting is still controversial (4Matter K. Mellman I. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 545-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). It seems there is more than one mechanism to route membrane proteins to the apical surface. The glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) moiety acts as an apical determinant for proteins attached to the membrane via a GPI anchor (5Brown D.A. Crise B. Rose J.K. Science. 1989; 245: 1499-1501Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar, 6Lisanti M.P. Caras I.W. Davitz M.A. Rodriguez-Boulan E. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 2145-2156Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). These proteins become detergent-insoluble during transport through the Golgi because of their clustering with glycolipids and cholesterol (7Brown D.A. Rose J.K. Cell. 1992; 68: 533-544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2618) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that glycolipids and GPI-anchored proteins are co-sorted in the trans-Golgi network into vesicular carriers that transport lipids and proteins to the plasma membrane (8Simons K. Wandinger-Ness A. Cell. 1990; 62: 207-210Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). Although this model might be valid for GPI-anchored proteins and a reduced number of transmembrane proteins (9Skibbens J.E. Roth M.G. Matlin K.S. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 821-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar), other mechanisms seem to operate for the majority of the apical integral membrane proteins (4Matter K. Mellman I. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 545-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar, 10Zurzolo C. van't Hof W. van Meer G. Rodriguez-Boulan E. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 42-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The fact that the removal of the membrane anchor and the cytoplasmic tail from an apical transmembrane protein still results in apical secretion of the anchorless protein was interpreted as either apical transport operating by a default mechanism or signals for apical transport residing in the ectodomain (4Matter K. Mellman I. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 545-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). In the latter case, taking into account that all those experiments were done using transmembrane glycoproteins and that N-glycans act as apical sorting signals in secretory proteins (11Scheifelle P. Peränen J. Simons K. Nature. 1995; 378: 96-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar), it cannot be excluded that theN-glycans present in the ectodomains of integral glycoproteins are themselves the sorting signals (12Fiedler K. Simons K. Cell. 1995; 81: 309-312Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). We have taken advantage of the lack of N-glycosylation sites in the CD3-ε chain of the T cell antigen receptor complex (13Borst J. Prendiville M.A. Terhorst C. Eur. J. Immunol. 1983; 13: 576-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 14Pettey C.L. Alarcón B. Malin R. Weinberg K. Terhorst C. J. Biol.

A. 1987; 84: 7649-7653Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) to use this protein as a tool to address the questions on whetherN-glycans are required for apical sorting of transmembrane proteins and whether apical sorting signals might exist in internal regions of apical integral membrane proteins. As we have found CD3-ε selectively present in the apical surface of polarized MDCK cells and excluded from glycolipid-enriched membrane microdomains, we can conclude that apical sorting determinants other thanN-glycans exist in this protein. Analysis of CD3-ε deletion mutants and rat growth hormone (GH) chimeras carrying different domains of CD3-ε revealed the existence of sorting determinants in the ectodomain, transmembrane domain, and cytoplasmic region of CD3-ε. These results suggest the existence of multiple signals in CD3-ε that can be decoded by the sorting machinery of MDCK cells. The hierarchical order of these signals results in the apical localization of the molecule. Thus, the possibility that integral membrane proteins use peptidic sorting signals for apical targeting is open. MDCK I cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 5% fetal bovine serum. The monoclonal antibody SP34, specific for the extracellular domain of human CD3-ε, was a generous gift from Dr. Cox Terhorst (Beth Israel Hospital, Boston, MA) (16Pessano S. Oettgen H. Bhan A.K. Terhorst C. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 337-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The monoclonal antibody APA1/1, specific for the intracytoplasmic region of human CD3-ε, was obtained as described (17Alarcón B. Ley S.C. Sánchez-Madrid F. Blumberg R.S. Ju S.T. Fresno M. Terhorst C. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 903-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Anti E-cadherin and anti-caveolin monoclonal antibodies were from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). Monkey anti-rat GH antibodies (anti-rat GH-IC-1 antisera, lot AFP 411S) were obtained from the National Hormone and Pituitary Program. Rat GH cDNA was a generous gift from Dr. J. L. Castrillo (Centro de Biologı́a Molecular, Madrid). Deletion mutant 12 (εdel12), which lacks the last five carboxyl-terminal amino acids of human CD3-ε, and εdel13, which lacks the transmembrane domain, were constructed in the expression vector pSRα as described (18Mallabiabarrena A. Fresno M. Alarcón B. Nature. 1992; 357: 593-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Constructs in pSRα encoding the rat GH appended either to the transmembrane and cytosolic domains of CD3-εdel12 or to the transmembrane domain alone were made by polymerase chain reaction splicing by overlap extension (19Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene. 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6850) Google Scholar), using specific oligonucleotide primers and the rat GH and CD3-ε cDNAs as templates. Three additional glycine residues were introduced as spacers at the junction between the GH and CD3-ε sequences. Transfections of MDCK cells were carried out by electroporation using a BTX 600 electroporation equipment (BTX, San Diego, CA). Selection of stable transfectants was carried out by treatment with 0.5 mg/ml G418 sulfate (Life Technologies, Inc.) for at least 4 weeks after transfection. Drug-resistant cells were picked up with cloning rings, individual clones were screened by immunofluorescence analysis, and positive clones were maintained in drug-free medium. Cells were seeded on 10-mm diameter coverslips (Thomas Scientific, Swedesboro, NJ) and, 24 h later, fixed for 20 min with 2% paraformaldehyde (Merck) in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at room temperature. The fixative was subsequently removed after three washes with 1 ml of PBS, and the cells were permeabilized by treatment with 0.1% (v/v) saponin (Sigma) plus 1% bovine serum albumin (Sigma) in PBS for 1 h at room temperature. For unpermeabilized cells, samples were incubated with 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS without saponin. Afterward, the coverslips were incubated with 2–4 μg/ml purified antibody for 30 min and washed three times with PBS. The coverslips were then incubated with a 1/100 dilution of fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG antibody (Southern Biotechnology, Birmingham, AL), washed three times with PBS, and mounted in Mowiol (Aldrich, Milwaukee, WI) prepared as described (20Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar). The cells were examined in a Zeiss Axioskop microscope and photographed using Kodak T-Max 400 film. Detergent cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 15 min in an Eppendorf centrifuge. The supernatants were subjected to three rounds of preclearing with 10 μl of protein G-Sepharose beads (Sigma) preloaded with nonimmune mouse serum. The preclearings were performed at 4 °C for 1 h. After the last preclearing, immunoprecipitations were performed for 4 h at 4 °C with 10 μl of protein G-Sepharose beads preloaded with 2–4 μg of purified APA 1/1 or anti E-cadherin antibodies. The immunoprecipitates were subsequently washed 5 times with 1 ml of lysis buffer and loaded onto 12% polyacrylamide gels. After electrophoresis, the gels were either dried and exposed to a Fuji imaging plate (Fuji Photo Co., Japan) or, alternatively, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad) for immunoblotting. The membranes were subsequently blocked in 10% dry skim milk in PBS for 1 h and incubated with streptavidin peroxidase (Amersham Life Science, Inc.) in a 0.1% Tween 20/PBS solution for 1 h at room temperature. The membranes were washed six times for 5 min with 200 ml of Tween 20/PBS solution and developed using an enhanced chemiluminescence Western blotting kit (ECL, Amersham) according to the manufacturer's specifications. For reprobing, the filters were stripped by a 5-min incubation at 55 °C in 62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 100 μm 2-mercaptoethanol and blocked in 10% skim milk in PBS. Afterward, the filters were incubated with 1 μg/ml solutions of APA1/1 or anti-E-cadherin antibodies in Tween 20/PBS for 1 h at room temperature and washed three times for 5 min in Tween 20/ PBS. A peroxidase-conjugated sheep anti-mouse IgG antibody (Amersham) was added for 30 min in Tween/PBS, and the filters were finally washed six times in Tween 20/PBS before the enhanced chemiluminescence reaction was carried out. For specific labeling of apical and basolateral domains, MDCK cells were seeded at confluent levels on 24.4-mm polycarbonate tissue culture inserts (Transwell; Costar Corp., Cambridge, MA) and harvested after 5 days. Sealing of the monolayer was monitored by measuring the transepithelial electric resistance using a Millicell ERS voltameter (Millipore Corp.). After repeated washings with ice-cold PBS containing 0.1 mmCaCl2 and 1 mm MgCl2 (PBS-C/M), 0.5 mg/ml sulfo-N-hydroxysuccinimide-biotin (Pierce) in PBS-C/M was added either to the apical or to the basolateral compartment of the filter chamber. After 30 min at 4 °C, the solution was removed, and remaining nonreacted biotin was quenched by incubation with ice-cold serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. Monolayers were finally washed with PBS and extracted with 0.15 m NaCl, 25 mm MES, pH 6.5, 1% Triton X-100, 60 mm octyl glucoside for 30 min on ice. Extracts were then subjected to immunoprecipitation as above. To analyze the possible presence in detergent-insoluble membranes of εdel12 during biosynthetic transport, we used the procedure of Skibbens et al. (9Skibbens J.E. Roth M.G. Matlin K.S. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 821-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Briefly, stably transfected MDCK cells were pulse-labeled for 5 min with a [35S]methionine/cysteine mixture (ICN, Costa Mesa, CA) and chased for the indicated times before they were lysed for 20 min on ice in an extraction buffer containing 0.15m NaCl, 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, and a mixture of protease inhibitors. The extract and the insoluble material were collected and centrifuged for 1 min in a microfuge at 14,000 rpm at 4 °C. The supernatants were harvested, and the pellets were solubilized in 100 μl of buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 8.5, 5 mm EDTA, and 1% SDS, heated for 3 min at 95 °C, and passed through a 22-gauge needle several times. Finally, the solubilized pellets and the Triton X-100-solubilized supernatants were brought to the same volume and buffer conditions for immunoprecipitation. The procedure used to prepare Triton X-100-insoluble membranes by centrifugation to equilibrium in sucrose density gradients was essentially as described by Brown and Rose (7Brown D.A. Rose J.K. Cell. 1992; 68: 533-544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2618) Google Scholar). Cells grown to confluency in four 100-mm dishes were rinsed with PBS and lysed for 20 min in 1 ml of 150 mm NaCl, 25 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100 at 4 °C. The lysate was scraped from the dishes with a rubber policeman, the dishes were rinsed with 1 ml of the same buffer at 4 °C, and the lysate was homogenized by passing the sample through a 22-gauge needle. The lysate was brought to 40% sucrose in a final volume of 4 ml and placed at the bottom of an 8-ml 5–30% linear sucrose gradient. Gradients were centrifuged for 18 h at 39,000 rpm at 4 °C in a Beckman SW 41 rotor. Fractions of 1 ml were harvested from the bottom of the tube, and aliquots were subjected to immunoblot analysis. The T cell receptor CD3-ε chain appeared to be a good model to examine the distribution of nonglycosylated integral membrane proteins in polarized cells. The human protein as well as the canine, rat, and murine sequences (not shown) lacks any putativeN-glycosylation site. In addition, deglycosylation procedures on the human protein suggested that CD3-ε not only lacksN-linked sugars but O-linked as well (13Borst J. Prendiville M.A. Terhorst C. Eur. J. Immunol. 1983; 13: 576-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 14Pettey C.L. Alarcón B. Malin R. Weinberg K. Terhorst C. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 4854-4859Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although CD3-ε is retained in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of transfected non-T cells, we had a panel of deletion and point mutants that eliminated a cytoplasmic ER retention signal and were surface-expressed in COS cells (18Mallabiabarrena A. Fresno M. Alarcón B. Nature. 1992; 357: 593-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 21Mallabiabarrena A. Jiménez M.A. Rico M. Alarcón B. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2257-2268Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). A mutant lacking the last five C-terminal amino acids of CD3-ε (mutant εdel12; Fig.1) was transiently transfected into MDCK cells, and the expression of the protein in nonpermeabilized and detergent-permeabilized cells was examined. As expected, this mutant is not ER-retained and is expressed on the cell surface (Fig.2). However, whereas staining of CD3-ε in nonpermeabilized cells shows a uniform pattern with some detectable microvilli, surface staining of E-cadherin, a basolateral membrane protein (22Le Bivic A. Sambuy Y. Mostov K. Rodriguez-Boulan E. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 1533-1539Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), was negligible. In permeabilized cells, the staining pattern of CD3-ε was similar to that of nonpermeabilized cells, although some internal labeling was also evident. By contrast, anti-E-cadherin antibodies gave a typical ring-like staining characteristic for basolateral proteins. These data suggest that most of the εdel12 protein is at the apical membrane, although the presence of some εdel12 at the basolateral membrane could not be ruled out. To quantitate the expression of εdel12 in both apical and basolateral membranes, stable clones of MDCK cells expressing εdel12 were obtained. One of these clones was seeded at high density on polycarbonate filters and cultured until the transepithelial electrical resistance reached >1000 Ω.cm2. Cells were surface-labeled from the apical or the basolateral sides using a water-soluble biotinylation reagent, lysed, and immunoprecipitated with the anti-CD3-ε antibody APA1/1. As shown in Fig.3, CD3-ε was labeled when the biotinylation reagent was added to the apical side and not when added to the basolateral chamber compartment. By contrast, E-cadherin was almost exclusively labeled when the reagent was added to the basolateral side. As control of the immunoprecipitation procedure, the nitrocellulose membranes containing the CD3-ε or E-cadherin immunoprecipitates were incubated with their respective antibodies to show that total (biotinylated and not biotinylated) levels of CD3-ε and E-cadherin were equivalent in both the apical and basolateral immunoprecipitates.Figure 2Cellular distribution of εdel12 in polarized MDCK cells. MDCK cells were transiently transfected with εdel12 cDNA and 48 h later were fixed and permeabilized with saponin (+sap) or left unpermeabilized (−sap). Afterward, staining was performed with anti-CD3-ε antibody SP34 and with anti-E-cadherin antibody. Photographs were taken at a magnification of 630 ×.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 3CD3-εdel12 is exclusively expressed on the apical membrane of polarized MDCK cells. A clone of MDCK cells stably transfected with the mutant in the ER retention signal of CD3-ε, εdel12, was seeded at high density on polycarbonate filters and labeled with sulfo-N-hydroxysuccinimide-biotin from both sides of the cell monolayer. Labeled cells were detergent-lysed and immunoprecipitated with nonimmune mouse serum (NMS) as a control or with anti-CD3-ε APA1/1 or anti E-cadherin antibodies. The immunoprecipitates were resolved on a polyacrylamide gel and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was probed with streptavidin peroxidase to detect biotinylated CD3-ε or E-cadherin surface proteins. As a control for the efficiency of the immunoprecipitations, the same filter was stripped and re-probed with APA1/1 or anti-E-cadherin (cadh.) antibodies to show similar levels of total (surface + internal) CD3-ε or E-cadherin on both apical and basolateral (BASOL.) immunoprecipitates.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) It has been demonstrated that N-linked glycans constitute sorting signals for transport of secretory glycoproteins to the apical membrane (11Scheifelle P. Peränen J. Simons K. Nature. 1995; 378: 96-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). N-Glycan-independent sorting of secretory proteins has also been recently reported (23Li S. Okamoto T. Chun M. Sargiacomo M. Casanova J.E. Hansen S.H. Nishimoto I. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15693-15701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar). Although it has not yet been determined whether membrane proteins also use glycans as sorting signals, it is likely that they might do so because many apical transmembrane proteins are known to contain apical signals in their extracellular domains (4Matter K. Mellman I. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 545-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). However, Fig. 3 shows that, in the absence of glycosylation, εdel12 is exclusively transported to the apical membrane and suggests that CD3-ε has an amino acid sequence-based sorting signal. Alternative to the existence of a peptidic apical sorting signal in CD3-ε, the mutants analyzed could be transported to the apical surface through glycolipid-enriched, detergent-insoluble membrane clusters in a similar way as the transport of GPI-linked proteins. We used centrifugation to equilibrium in sucrose density gradients of Triton X-100 extracts from stably transfected MDCK cells to analyze the possible presence of εdel12 in detergent-resistant membranes (7Brown D.A. Rose J.K. Cell. 1992; 68: 533-544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2618) Google Scholar). Fig. 4 A shows that εdel12 was exclusively detected in the soluble fractions (fractions 1–4). As a control of the fractionation procedure, we analyzed in parallel the distribution of caveolin, a protein present in detergent-insoluble membranes, which was found in the buoyant, insoluble membrane fractions (fractions 7–10). Although at steady state CD3-ε is not found in glycolipid-enriched complexes, it could become associated with them during transport to the cell surface. To analyze the possible association of CD3-ε with glycolipid clusters after biosynthesis, newly synthesized proteins were metabolically labeled for 5 min, chased for different times, and separated into detergent-soluble and -insoluble fractions by centrifugation (9Skibbens J.E. Roth M.G. Matlin K.S. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 821-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation analysis of the fractions obtained indicated that CD3-ε did not become incorporated after biosynthesis into the detergent-resistant membrane fraction (Fig. 4 B). As a control for this fractionation procedure, all the fractions were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-caveolin antibodies to show that, at steady state, caveolin was mainly present in the insoluble membrane fractions, in agreement with previous reports (24Marzolo M.P. Bull P. González A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1834-1839Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The cytoplasmic tail of CD3-ε contains two sequences consisting of a tyrosine followed in position +3 by leucine or isoleucine, which fits into the consensus sequences for basolateral transport signals (4Matter K. Mellman I. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 545-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). However, these sequences do not seem to be operative as basolateral signals or alternatively, their activity is masked by an apical signal. In a first attempt to characterize the apical signal, MDCK cells were transfected with a deletion mutant of CD3-ε (εdel13) lacking the whole transmembrane domain (Fig. 1). This anchorless mutant has been previously shown to escape ER retention and to be secreted from transfected COS cells (18Mallabiabarrena A. Fresno M. Alarcón B. Nature. 1992; 357: 593-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). A stable clone expressing the protein was seeded at high density on polycarbonate filters and metabolically labeled with [35S]methionine/cysteine when the cell monolayers reached a transepithelial electrical resistance >1000 Ω.cm2. The culture supernatants from both the apical and basolateral compartments were collected and immunoprecipitated with anti-CD3-ε antibody. Although no posttranslational modifications other than tyrosine phosphorylation (25Straus D. Weiss A. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 178: 1523-1530Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) are known in CD3-ε, in some cases it was clear that εdel13 appeared as two bands (Fig.5 A). The existence of both bands could be due to partial reduction with 2-mercaptoethanol of the intrachain disulfide bridge presumed to exist in CD3-ε (15Gold D.P. Clevers H. Alarcón B. Dunlap S. Novotny J. Williams A.F. Terhorst C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 7649-7653Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The anchorless CD3-ε mutant, εdel13, was secreted through both plasma membrane domains although preferentially through the apical surface (Fig. 5 A). This suggests that removal of both the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains results in a partial loss of the apical targeting observed in CD3-εdel12. Thus, although CD3-ε might have a determinant in its ectodomain responsible for the preferential secretion of CD3-εdel13 through the apical surface, the deletion of the transmembrane domain might have removed a second apical determinant required for the observed full apical polarity of CD3-εdel12. The loss in εdel13 of this putative determinant implies that it should be located either in the transmembrane domain or in the cytosolic tail, since elimination of the transmembrane domain results in the lumenal localization of the CD3-ε cytoplasmic tail. Fig. 5 B shows that removal of the cytosolic tail of CD3-ε (CD3-εt, Fig. 1) results in full apical polarity of the resulting molecule. To demonstrate that the lack of CD3-ε labeling in the basolateral membrane was due to its complete localization in the apical membrane and not to a defective labeling of the basolateral surface, a control for basolateral membrane protein labeling was established after immunoprecipitation with anti-E-cadherin antibody and blotting with streptavidin peroxidase (Fig. 5 B). The full expression of CD3-εt in the apical membrane suggests that either the transmembrane domain of CD3-ε contains a second apical determinant or that the membrane and secreted forms of CD3-ε have different requirements for apical transport. To investigate these possibilities, the presence of apical sorting determinants in CD3-ε was further investigated by appending some of its domains to rat GH, a soluble protein known to be randomly secreted through both the apical and basolateral surfaces (26Gottli T.A. Beaudry G Rizzolo L. Colman A. Rinder M. Adesnik M. Sabatini D.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 2100-2104Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Two new constructs were made to express chimeric GH proteins fused to either the transmembrane domain (Fig.1, GH/CD3-ε TM) or to both the transmembrane and the cytosolic domains (Fig. 1, GH/CD3-ε TMC) of CD3-ε. The constructs expressing the cytoplasmic domain of CD3-ε carried a mutation of arginine 183 to lysine that inactivates the ER retention signal of CD3-ε (18Mallabiabarrena A. Fresno M. Alarcón B. Nature. 1992; 357: 593-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). These constructs were transfected in MDCK cells, and cell clones that stably expressed the chimeric proteins were selected for analysis. After biotinylation of either the apical or the basolateral sides, cell monolayers were lysed in 1% Triton X-100 plus 60 mm octyl glucoside, and immunoprecipitation was performed with anti-GH antibodies followed by immunoblotting with streptavidin peroxidase (strp-po). Unexpectedly, the transmembrane domain of CD3-ε targeted GH to the basolateral membrane (Fig. 5 C, upper panel, GH/εTM). As a control of the immunoprecipitation procedure, the nitrocellulose membrane was stripped after the probing with streptavidin peroxidase and reprobed with anti-GH antibody to show that GH/CD3-εTM was indeed present in the GH immunoprecipitates obtained from both the apical and the basolateral-labeled cell lysates (Fig. 5 C, middle panel). In addition, as a control for cell polarity, the same lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-E-cadherin antibody followed by immunoblotting with streptavidin peroxidase to demonstrate the exclusive presence of E-cadherin on the basolateral membrane, in agreement with previous reports (Fig. 5 C, lower panel) (22Le Bivic A. Sambuy Y. Mostov K. Rodriguez-Boulan E. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 1533-1539Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Since the GH/εTM chimera was immunoprecipitated from both cell lysates (middle panel) but it was only biotinylated when biotin was added to the basolateral side of the cell monolayer (upper panel), the results shown in Fig.5 C imply the existence of a basolateral determinant in the transmembrane region of CD3-ε. On the other hand, Fig. 5 Dshows in a similar experiment that the presence of the cytoplasmic tail neutralized the transmembrane basolateral determinant, resulting in a nonpolarized delivery of the GH chimera (GH/εTMC). These results suggest that there are at least three different sorting determinants in CD3-ε: 1) a basolateral sorting determinant in the transmembrane domain responsible for the basolateral targeting of GH/εTM, 2) a dominant apical sorting determinant in the ectodomain that neutralizes the transmembrane basolateral determinant in CD3-εt and is sufficient to target CD3-ε to the apical membrane, and 3) a sorting determinant in the cytoplasmic tail that either neutralizes the transmembrane basolateral signal or expresses a co-dominant apical sorting signal that is unable to target the GH/εTMC protein exclusively to the apical surface. In the transmembrane proteins previously analyzed, the apical sorting determinant was located to the ectodomain (4Matter K. Mellman I. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 545-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). N-Glycans constitute apical sorting signals for at least some secretory proteins (11Scheifelle P. Peränen J. Simons K. Nature. 1995; 378: 96-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar) that are routed to the apical surface following a glycolipid-independent pathway (27Graichen R. Lösch A. Appel D. Koch-Brandt C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15854-15857Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). It has been proposed thatN-glycans might be the sorting signals for apical transmembrane glycoproteins as well (12Fiedler K. Simons K. Cell. 1995; 81: 309-312Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). An alternative possibility is that although sorting signals may exist in internal domains of apicalN-glycosylated membrane proteins, the removal of these signals in anchorless mutants might be masked by theN-glycans that would act as dominant apical sorting signals in the resulting secretory proteins. While this manuscript was under revision, apical secretion of a nonglycosylated form of hepatitis B envelope antigen was described (24Marzolo M.P. Bull P. González A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1834-1839Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), suggesting that at least for secretory proteins, signals other than N-glycosylation may exist. However, it remained to be determined whether membrane proteins could or could not have other types of signals. According to the results shown here, this seems to be the case for CD3-ε. Since CD3-ε is not glycosylated, it appears that CD3-ε contains an apical determinant in its ectodomain other than N-glycans. Although in this work, CD3-ε has been used as a tool to study possible apical sorting signals different fromN-glycosylation in transmembrane proteins, it remains to be determined whether these signals could have a physiological role in T cells. Because isolated chains of wild type CD3-ε are retained in the ER, a mutant in the ER retention signal had to be used to allow surface expression (21Mallabiabarrena A. Jiménez M.A. Rico M. Alarcón B. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2257-2268Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In T cells, CD3-ε is transported to the cell surface after assembly with the other T cell receptor/CD3 components, forming a complex in which the ER retention signal is probably masked (18Mallabiabarrena A. Fresno M. Alarcón B. Nature. 1992; 357: 593-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 28Clevers H. Alarcón B. Wileman T. Terhorst C. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1988; 6: 629-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar). It has been recently postulated that apical and basolateral routes to the plasma membrane exist even in cells that do not differentiate apical and basolateral membrane subdomains (29Yoshimori T. Keller P. Roth M.G. Simons K. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 247-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 30Müsch A. Xu H. Shields D. Rodriguez-Boulan E. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 543-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). If this was the case in T cells, the use of apical pathways by CD3-εdel12 in MDCK cells could suggest that a similar route of transport might be used in T lymphocytes by the newly assembled T cell receptor·CD3 complex following masking of the ER retention signal present in CD3-ε. In summary, we have found that CD3-ε is targeted to the apical membrane in MDCK cells in the absence of N-glycosylation by a pathway not involving glycolipid-enriched vesicular carriers. Moreover, molecular dissection of CD3-ε revealed the existence of sorting determinants in each of the CD3-ε domains, suggesting that the apical localization of CD3-ε results from the concerted effect of multiple sorting signals organized in a hierarchical fashion. Taken together, these results indicate that the apical sorting machinery of MDCK cells is able to decode different sorting signals in CD3-ε and to route the protein to the apical surface by a pathway other than those involving glycolipid-dependent transport orN-glycan recognition.

https://openalex.org/W2069061361,"Fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) have been implicated in pituitary lactotroph tumorigenesis; however, little is known about the molecular mechanisms of FGF signal transduction. We used a transient transfection approach, in GH4 cells, to identify components of the FGF signaling pathway leading to activation of the rat prolactin (rPRL) promoter. Using dominant-negative constructs of p21Ras, Raf-1 kinase, and mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase, we show that FGF activation of the rPRL promoter is independent of Ras and Raf-1 but requires MAP kinase. Furthermore, MAP kinase but not Raf-1 kinase catalytic activity is stimulated by FGFs. The rPRL promoter FGF response maps to two Ets binding sites, centered at −212 (FRE1) and −96 (FRE2), and co-transfection of dominant-negative Ets inhibits FGF activation. FRE1 co-localizes with a composite, Ets/GHF-1, Ras response element. However, overexpression of Ets-1 and GHF-1, which potentiate the Ras response, inhibits FGF stimulation of the rPRL promoter, implying that Ras and FGF signaling pathways target distinct factors to elicit their effects. These data suggest that Ets factors serve to sort and integrate MAP kinase-dependent growth factor signals, allowing highly specific transcriptional responses to be mediated via the interaction of distinct Ets proteins and cofactors at common response elements.

Marx S. Friesen H. J. Clin. Endocrinol. & Metab. 1993; 76: 1182-1187Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). FGF-4 was first isolated as a transforming gene in human stomach cancer (10Sakamoto H. Mori M. Taira M. Yoshida S. Matsukawa K. Shimizu M. Sekiguchi M. Terada M. Sugimura T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 3997-4001Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Subsequently, FGF-4 gene sequences have been isolated from human prolactinomas and shown to exhibit transforming activity in NIH 3T3 assays (11Gonsky R. Herman V. Melmed S. Fagin J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1991; 5: 1687-1695Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In addition, FGF-4 has been shown to induce PRL secretion and gene transcription in rat pituitary cells (7Shimon I. Huttner A. Said J. Spirina O. Melmed S. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 187-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), and rats injected with GH4 cells stably transfected with FGF-4 expression vectors developed highly aggressive, prolactin-secreting tumors (7Shimon I. Huttner A. Said J. Spirina O. Melmed S. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 187-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Thus, FGF-4 may be directly involved in the development, progression, and metastasis of pituitary tumors. In addition, it has recently been shown that pituitary lactotroph adenomas express different FGF receptor isoforms and subtypes compared with the normal pituitary (12Ali Asghar Abbass S. Asa S.L. Ezzat S. J. Clin. Endocrinol. & Metab. 1997; 82: 1160-1166Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Despite these advances in our understanding of FGF-2 and FGF-4 expression in the pituitary, the precise mechanisms of FGF signal transduction in pituitary cells have not been elucidated. The initial event in the FGF signal transduction pathway is activation of FGF receptor tyrosine kinase activity. Both Ras/Raf/MAP kinase-dependent and -independent pathways have been implicated as downstream components of the FGF signaling pathway in various systems. The Ras/Raf/MAP kinase pathway is required for mesoderm induction by FGF in Xenopus (13LaBonne C. Burke B. Whitman M. Development. 1995; 121: 1475-1486PubMed Google Scholar, 14MacNicol A. Muslin A.

Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 428-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). FGFs have also been suggested to signal via Ras/Raf-independent pathways including pertussis toxin-sensitive G proteins (18Estival A. Robberecht P. Fanjul M. Rouots B. Hollande E. Vaysse N. Clemente F. Biochem. J. 1996; 315: 619-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 19Logan A. Logan S.

Res. 1996; 11: 1256-1263Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) and protein kinase B (21Burgering B. Coffer P. Nature. 1995; 376: 599-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (1884) Google Scholar), and recently, FGF receptor-3 has been shown to be associated with Stat-1 (22Su W.-C.S. Kitagawa M. Xue N. Xie B. Garofalo S. Cho J. Deng C. Horton W. Fu X.-Y. Nature. 1997; 386: 288-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Little is known about the nuclear components of FGF signaling pathways. FGF signaling in Xenopus requires AP-1/Jun for normal embryonic development and mesoderm induction (23Dong Z. Xu R.-H. Kim J. Zhan S.-N. Ma W.-Y. Colburn N.H. King H.-F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9942-9946Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Similarly, few FGF- responsive cis-acting DNA elements (FREs) have been identified. FGF activation of the proenkephalin gene requires ATF-3 and c-Jun, which bind to a sequence previously identified as a cAMP response element (24Tan Y. Low K. Boccia C. Grossman J. Comb M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7546-7556Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In addition, an FRE in the rat osteocalcin promoter confers a synergistic induction by FGF-2 and cAMP (25Boudreaux J.M. Towler D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7508-7515Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), and a similar element has been found in the human osteocalcin promoter (26Schedlich L. Flanagan J. Crofts L. Gillies S. Goldberg D. Morrison N. Eisman J. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1994; 9: 143-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Finally, the FGF response of the urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) promoter has been mapped to a PEA3-like/AP1 composite element (27Besser D. Presta M. Nagamine Y. Cell Growth Differ. 1995; 6: 1009-1017PubMed Google Scholar). However, the precise identity of the factors mediating these FGF responses have not been identified. Identification of the nuclear and cytoplasmic components of the FGF signal transduction pathway has been hampered by the lack of a convenient, rapid assay, since FGF responses characterized to date have typically involved induction of cellular proliferation, morphological changes, or differentiation. Regulation of the rat (r) prolactin (PRL) gene in GH4 pituitary tumor cell line provides an excellent, physiologically relevant model system to study the components of FGF signaling. GH4 cells are highly differentiated, retain cell-specific functions and hormonal responses, and express the phenotypic marker, PRL, under the control of the pituitary-specific POU homeodomain transcription factor, GHF-1/Pit-1 (28Castrillo J.L. Theill L.E. Karin M. Science. 1991; 253: 197-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Moreover, this model system has been successfully employed to study the mechanisms of the epidermal growth factor and Ras signal transduction pathways as they impinge on the rPRL promoter (29Pickett C.A. Gutierrez-Hartmann A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8612-8616Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 30Pickett C. Gutierrez-Hartmann A. Mol. Cell.

Biol. 1995; 15: 2849-2857Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). GH4 cells are FGF-responsive, and FGF-4 has been shown to specifically activate rPRL gene transcription (7Shimon I. Huttner A. Said J. Spirina O. Melmed S. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 187-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). To investigate the molecular mechanisms of FGF-2 and FGF-4 signaling to the rPRL promoter in GH4 cells, a transient transfection system was utilized. In this study we show that FGF-2 and FGF-4 induction of the rPRL promoter is independent of Ras and Raf-1 kinase but requires MAP kinase. We have identified two FREs, both containing Ets binding sites, and provide evidence that a member of the Ets family of transcription factors is a functional nuclear target of the FGF response. Of note, the rPRL FREs co-localize with 1) a previously identified Ras response element (32Bradford A.P. Conrad K.E. Wasylyk C. Wasylyk B. Gutierrez-Hartmann A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2849-2857Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) and 2) a basal transcription element implicated in insulin activation of the rPRL promoter (33Jacob K.K. Ouyang L. Stanley F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27773-27779Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 34Jackson S.M. Keech C.A. Williamson D.J. Gutierrez-Hartmann A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2708-2719Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). However, the FGF, Ras, and insulin responses appear to be mediated by distinct Ets transcription factors. Thus, we have identified critical functional components of the FGF signaling pathway in pituitary cells, and we present evidence that different growth factors, acting via MAP kinase, act to target distinct Ets members that bind common cis-acting response elements, thus serving to sort and integrate multiple signaling pathways resulting in specific changes in gene expression. GH4T2 rat pituitary tumor cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM, Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) (Hyclone, Logan UT) and 50 μg/ml penicillin and streptomycin (Gemini, Calabasas, CA). Cells were maintained at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Transient transfections were carried out by electroporation, as described previously (31Conrad K.E. Oberwetter J.M. Vallaincourt R. Johnson G.L. Gutierrez-Hartmann A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1553-1565Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 32Bradford A.P. Conrad K.E. Wasylyk C. Wasylyk B. Gutierrez-Hartmann A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2849-2857Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Briefly, media were changed 4–12 h prior to each transfection, and cells were harvested at 50–70% confluency and electroporated in 10% FCS/DMEM, as described (32Bradford A.P. Conrad K.E. Wasylyk C. Wasylyk B. Gutierrez-Hartmann A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2849-2857Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). After electroporation, cells were plated in DMEM without serum for a final concentration of 0.66% FCS. Similar results were obtained when cells were plated in 10% FCS/DMEM. Cells were incubated for a total of 24 h and treated with FGF-2 (kindly provided by Brad Olwin, University of Colorado, Boulder), FGF-4 (R & D Systems, Minneapolis, MN), or diluent (0.1% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline) at a final concentration of 1 ng/ml to the existing media. Minimal FGF responses were detected as early as 2 h post-treatment; however, optimal responses occurred after 6 h of incubation. Similar results were obtained when cells were treated with FGFs ± 1 μg/ml heparin (Sigma). Electroporations were performed in triplicate or duplicate where indicated for each condition within a single experiment, and experiments were repeated using different plasmid preparations of each construct. Luciferase and β-galactosidase assays were measured as described previously (31Conrad K.E. Oberwetter J.M. Vallaincourt R. Johnson G.L. Gutierrez-Hartmann A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1553-1565Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar,32Bradford A.P. Conrad K.E. Wasylyk C. Wasylyk B. Gutierrez-Hartmann A. Mol. Cell.

Plasmid DNAs were purified by either the alkaline sodium dodecyl sulfate extraction and cesium chloride density gradient centrifugation or by the Qiagen Mega protocol (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA). Plasmids were quantitated by both absorbance at 260 nm and verified by agarose electrophoresis with DNA standards. GH4T2 cells were serum-starved overnight and treated with 1 ng/ml FGF-2 or FGF-4, 25 nmEGF, or the equivalent volume of diluent for the indicated times. Cells (107) were washed in cold phosphate-buffered saline and harvested in 500 μl of extraction buffer (EB) (1% Triton X-100, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mmNaCl, 50 mm NaF, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 2 mm Na3VO4). Equal amounts of protein (50 μg), as determined by the Bio-Rad DC protein assay, were resolved by electrophoresis on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Membranes were probed with primary antibodies to p42/p44 MAP kinase and to the tyrosine-phosphorylated form of MAP kinase (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) according to the manufacturer's protocol, except membranes were incubated with a goat anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase antibody (Life Technologies, Inc.) diluted 1:10,000 in blocking buffer. Protein was detected using the chemiluminescence assay, ECL (Amersham Life Sciences) according to the manufacturer's protocols. Where indicated, membranes were stripped for 30 min at 50 °C according to the ECL protocol and re-probed as described above. Raf-1 kinase assays were performed essentially as described (37Huang J. Mohammadi M. Rodrigues G.A. Schlessinger J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5065-5072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 38Kovacina K.S. Yonezawa K. Brautigan D.L. Tonks N.K. Rapp U.R. Roth R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 12115-12118Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using the syntide II peptide (PLARTLSVAGLPGKK) as a substrate (generously provided by Dr. Roger Colbran, Vanderbilt University). GH4T2 cell extracts were prepared as described above for the MAPK Western blots. Equal protein was immunoprecipitated with a polyclonal anti-Raf-1 (C12, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) antibody (1:500) or a rabbit IgG monoclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), as a negative control, at 4 °C for 1 h. The immunocomplexes were then bound to 25 μl of protein A-CL-4B Sepharose slurry (Zymed, San Francisco, CA) for 1 h and washed one time with 1 ml of EB and one time with 1 ml of 0.5 m LiCl, 100 mm Tris, pH 7.6. The immunocomplexes were resuspended in 36 μl of kinase buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mmMnCl2, 10 μm ATP, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 25 mm β-glycerophosphate), 1 μl of 4 mm syntide II peptide, and 0.1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. The reaction was allowed to proceed for 20 min at room temperature. The reaction was terminated with 2 μl of 10% trichloroacetic acid, spotted in duplicate on P81 Whatman paper, and air-dried. The filters were washed extensively in 0.85% phosphoric acid and counted in scintillation fluid. Radioactive counts from the preimmune reactions were subtracted from counts from the anti-Raf-1 immunoprecipitations. The pA3(mBTE)rPRLluc construct and the double mutant, pA3(mBTE/mEBS)rPRLluc, were created by nested polymerase chain reaction site-directed mutagenesis in pG7rPRL or pG7(mEBS)rPRL, respectively, using specific mutagenic oligonucleotides in combination with commercially available SP6 and T7 primers (Promega, Madison, WI), as described previously (36Bradford A.P. Conrad K.E. Tran P.H. Ostrowski M.C. Gutierrrez-Hartmann A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24639-24648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). pG7(mEBS)rPRL contains a site-specific mutation in the Ets binding site (EBS) within the RRE (−214 to −209) (36Bradford A.P. Conrad K.E. Tran P.H. Ostrowski M.C. Gutierrrez-Hartmann A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24639-24648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The core −97CGGAAA−92EBS within the BTE was changed to CTCGAG, generating a uniqueXhoI restriction site for the mBTE construct and a secondXhoI site for the mBTE/mEBS construct. Thus, the double mutant has the EBS at the RRE at position −214 to −209 mutated and the EBS at −99 to −94 also mutated to XhoI sites. The resulting constructs were cloned into the HindIII site of pA3luc and sequenced to confirm the presence of the mutant EBSs and verify that the resulting promoters are otherwise identical to pA3rPRLluc and pA3(mEBS)rPRLluc, respectively. FGFs have been shown to selectively activate the rat (r) prolactin (PRL) promoter but not the ancestrally related rat growth hormone (GH) promoter, in GH4 pituitary cells (7Shimon I. Huttner A. Said J. Spirina O. Melmed S. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 187-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). This selective activation of the rPRL promoter is reminiscent of the Ras response of these related promoters in that V-12 Ras activates the rPRL promoter but not the rGH promoter in GH4 cells (31Conrad K.E. Oberwetter J.M. Vallaincourt R. Johnson G.L. Gutierrez-Hartmann A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1553-1565Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 32Bradford A.P. Conrad K.E. Wasylyk C. Wasylyk B. Gutierrez-Hartmann A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2849-2857Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Based on these results, and other observations implicating the Ras/Raf/MAP kinase pathway in FGF signal transduction (13LaBonne C. Burke B. Whitman M.

Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 428-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 37Huang J. Mohammadi M. Rodrigues G.A. Schlessinger J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5065-5072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 39Whitman M. Melton D. Nature. 1992; 357: 252-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), we investigated whether FGF-2 or FGF-4 signal via the Ras pathway in this system. To determine the functional role of Ras in FGF-2 and FGF-4 activation of the rPRL promoter, a dominant-negative N17Ras construct (40Feig L. Cooper G.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 3235-3243Crossref PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar) was transiently transfected into GH4 cells along with the rPRL promoter fused to the luciferase gene (pA3rPRLluc). As shown in Fig.1 A, in the absence of N17Ras, FGF-2 and FGF-4 activate the rPRL promoter approximately 3-fold. Co-transfection of N17Ras does not significantly block either FGF-2 or FGF-4 activation of the rPRL promoter. To demonstrate that N17Ras is functionally expressed in this system, we show that N17Ras blocks the 43-fold induction mediated by mutationally activated c-src(Fp6V c-src 527F) (41Gupta S.K. Gallego C. Johnson G.L. Heasley L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7987-7990Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which acts via the Ras pathway, to about 15-fold (Fig. 1 B). Thus, although FGF-2 and FGF-4, like Ras, selectively activate the rPRL promoter, these results indicate that FGF-2 and FGF-4 induction of rPRL promoter activity in GH4 cells is not mediated by Ras. We next sought to determine whether Raf-1 kinase, a typical downstream component in the Ras pathway, is involved in FGF activation of the rPRL promoter in GH4 cells, since Raf-1 kinase has been shown to be activated independently of Ras, e.g. by protein kinase C (42Oberwetter J.M. Conrad K.E. Gutierrez-Hartmann A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 915-923PubMed Google Scholar). To test the functional role of Raf-1 in the FGF response, GH4 cells were co-transfected with a dominant-negative Raf (C4 Raf) construct (43Bruder J.T. Heidecker G. Rapp U.R. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 545-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). Fig. 2 A shows that FGF-2 and FGF-4 activate the rPRL promoter 3- to 4-fold. Co-transfection of dominant-negative C4 Raf does not significantly block activation by FGF-2 or FGF-4. Consistent with previous results (31Conrad K.E. Oberwetter J.M. Vallaincourt R. Johnson G.L. Gutierrez-Hartmann A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1553-1565Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), C4 Raf blocked the 5-fold activation by Ras of the rPRL promoter by 60%, showing that the dominant-negative construct is functional in this system. These data indicate that FGF-2 and FGF-4 activation of the rPRL promoter in GH4 cells is independent of Raf-1 kinase. To investigate further the role of Raf-1 in FGF signaling, we examined the effects of FGF-2 and FGF-4 on Raf-1 kinase catalytic activity. Fig.2 B shows the results of a Raf-1 immunocomplex kinase assay using Syntide II as a substrate (37Huang J. Mohammadi M. Rodrigues G.A. Schlessinger J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5065-5072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 38Kovacina K.S. Yonezawa K. Brautigan D.L. Tonks N.K. Rapp U.R. Roth R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 12115-12118Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). EGF activates Raf-1 kinase activity approximately 2–2½-fold after 5 min of treatment. However, treatment with FGF-2 or FGF-4 for as long as 30 min does not activate Raf-1 kinase activity (Fig. 2 B). Thus, both biochemical and functional analyses indicate that Raf-1 kinase is not a component of the FGF signaling pathway leading to activation of the rPRL promoter. MAP kinase has been shown to be a critical point of convergence of many hormone and growth factor signaling pathways, including some that are Ras- and/or Raf-independent (44Hill C. Treisman R. Cell. 1995; 80: 199-211Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1198) Google Scholar). Thus, we tested the role of MAP kinase in FGF signaling and activation of the rPRL promoter. GH4 cells were transfected with a p42 MAP kinase construct (iMAPK), mutated in its ATP-binding site, that has been shown to specifically inhibit MAP kinase-dependent signaling (31Conrad K.E. Oberwetter J.M. Vallaincourt R. Johnson G.L. Gutierrez-Hartmann A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1553-1565Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Fig. 3 A shows that transfection of iMAPK completely abolished the 2–5-fold activation of the rPRL promoter by FGF-2 and FGF-4, respectively. Consistent with previous observations (31Conrad K.E. Oberwetter J.M. Vallaincourt R. Johnson G.L. Gutierrez-Hartmann A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1553-1565Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), theiMAPK construct attenuated the 6-fold Ras activation of the rPRL promoter to about 3-fold (Fig. 3 A). Expression ofiMAPK has no effect on forskolin activation of the rPRL promoter mediated by protein kinase A (data not shown and Ref. 31Conrad K.E. Oberwetter J.M. Vallaincourt R. Johnson G.L. Gutierrez-Hartmann A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1553-1565Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). These results implicate p42 MAP kinase as a functional component of the FGF signaling pathway leading to activation of the rPRL promoter. To determine the effect of FGF-2 and FGF-4 on MAP kinase catalytic activity, extracts derived from GH4 cells treated with either FGF-2, FGF-4, EGF, or diluent were probed with an antibody specific for the phosphorylated and activated form of MAP kinase (45Payne D.M. Rossomando A.J. Martino P. Erickson A.K. Her J.H. Shabanowitz J. Hunt D.F. Weber M.J. Sturgill T.W. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 885-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (842) Google Scholar). Fig.3 B shows that MAP kinase is not phosphorylated in control/untreated cells (lane 1). Treatment with EGF for 5 min results in phosphorylation and activation of MAP kinase (lane 2). FGF-2 and FGF-4 treatment induced MAP kinase phosphorylation and activation for up to 30 min (lanes 3–10). Specificity of the antibody for the phosphorylated MAP kinase protein is illustrated in lanes 11 and 12. To demonstrate equal loading of protein, the blot was stripped and re-probed with a second MAP kinase antibody, which recognizes both phosphoryla"

The same template could yield an arrested complex with the enzyme at nucleotide 13–15 and RNA of 15–17 residues. These complexes were stable for at least a week under various conditions and could be resolved by gel electrophoresis or purified by ion exchange chromatography. The purified paused complex formed crystals capable of x-ray diffraction to 3.5 Å resolution. The complex remained active in the crystal and, in the presence of nucleoside triphosphates, could efficiently extend the transcript in situ.

RNA chain elongation, once viewed as a monotonous process of ribonucleotide polymerization, now appears mechanistically varied, with important regulatory consequences. RNA polymerase may be unable to extend an RNA chain due to impediments in the DNA template, such as special sequences, damage sites, or protein binding sites (1Nudler E. Kashlev M. Nikiforov V.

The resulting halted complexes may become arrested as a consequence of the polymerase translocating backwards on the template, extruding the 3′- (growing) end of the RNA chain (3Gu W. Powell W.

Elongin function can play a role in tumorigenesis. Elongin is bound and inhibited by the VHL tumor suppressor protein, and mutations of the VHL protein found in tumors prevent binding (16Aso T.

The mechanism and regulation of elongation have been pursued by studies of isolated elongation complexes. In the case of the bacterial enzyme, the complexes are generally formed by promoter-dependent transcription, halted by withholding a single nucleoside triphosphate (18Levin J.R. Krummell B.R. Chamberlin M.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 196: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The halted complexes have been extensively characterized by enzymatic and chemical footprinting, chemical cross-linking, electron microscopy, and other means (19Linn S.C. Luse D.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 1508-1522Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 20Lee D. Landick R. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 228: 759-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 21Reese W.A. Keller R.W.

The complexes contain an unwound region (“bubble”) of about 15 base pairs of DNA around the nucleotide addition site (20Lee D. Landick R. J. Mol.

A. 1991; 88: 4245-4249Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Outstanding questions include the paths followed by DNA and RNA, the length of the DNA-RNA hybrid, and the mechanisms of unwinding and rewinding of DNA/DNA and RNA/DNA duplexes. Answers to these questions will come from determination of the three-dimensional structure of halted complexes. To this end, we have formed halted and arrested complexes with yeast RNA polymerase II. Halted complexes are more difficult to prepare with eukaryotic than bacterial polymerases because initiation at eukaryotic promoters is far less efficient and requires multiple general initiation factors. Here we employ “tailed” templates, bearing 3′-protruding single stranded ends, which support transcription without general initiation factors, starting at a cluster of sites about three residues from the single strand-double strand junction (26Kadesch T.R. Chamberlin M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 5286-5295Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We report on characteristics of polymerase II elongation complexes pertinent to their crystallization and structure determination. A 220-base pair fragment of pGR220 (kindly provided by Dr. Caroline Kane, University of California, Berkeley), containing a 135-residue T-less cassette, was prepared with a 3′-dC tail by cleavage with AvaI, dephosphorylation with shrimp alkaline phosphatase (U. S. Biochemical Corp.), heat inactivation of the phosphatase, ligation to a phosphorylated synthetic oligonucleotide with an AvaI end and 18 dC residues, cleavage with KpnI, and purification by electrophoresis in low melting agarose, removed by treatment with Gelase (Epicentre Technologies). Plasmids containing shortened T-less cassettes were constructed from the 220-base pair fragment of pGR220 by PCR with the use of oligonucleotide primers containing AvaI andKpnI sites, yielding V51 (from residues 113 to 158 of the pGR220 fragment), V102 (from residues 113 to 206), and V115 (from residues 97 to 206). Trityl purification of synthetic oligonucleotides (Fig.1, Anagene Inc.) was sufficient for transcription experiments. Further purification in 6 m urea, 19% polyacrylamide gels was done for purposes of crystallization. Oligonucleotides were electroeluted, dried, dissolved in water, and desalted by filtration through Sephadex G-50. Complementary oligonucleotides, in equimolar amounts on the basis of optical density measurements, were hybridized in 30 mm ammonium sulfate by heating to 80 °C for 5 min and cooling to 20 °C. The presence of a small excess of one strand had no deleterious effect on transcription assays, presumably because their affinity for the polymerase was considerably lower than that of the tailed templates. Enzyme lacking subunits 4 and 7 was purified from Saccharomyces cerevisiae by immunoaffinity chromatography as described (27Edwards A.M. Darst S.A. Feaver W.J. Thompson N.E. Burges R.R. Kornberg R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2122-2126Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Polymerase was eluted from the antibody column with 40% propylene glycol instead of glycerol (28Thompson N.E. Aronson D.B. Burgess R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7069-7077Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Protein for use in crystallization trials was futher purified on either Poros (HE1) heparin or DEAE. Purified polymerase was precipitated by the addition of an equal volume of saturated ammonium sulfate, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C. RNA polymerase II (0.1–1.5 μg) was incubated with a 2- to 3-fold excess of template DNA for 2 min at room temperature in 25 μl of 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 6 mm magnesium sulfate, 10 mmDTT, 1The abbreviations used are: DTT, dithiothreitol; bp, base pair(s). 60 mmammonium sulfate or with 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 6 mm magnesium sulfate, 10 mm DTT, 150 mm potassium acetate. Values of pH in the range 7.5–8.0 and the use of potassium choride, ammonium sulfate, and potassium acetate gave similar results. Nucleoside triphosphates (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) were added to 660 μm, with labeled nucleotides at 60 μm (2 μl of 400 Ci/mmol [α-32P]ATP, GTP or UTP; Amersham Corp.). Halted complexes were formed by omission of UTP. After 30 min at room temperature or 20 min at 28 °C, reactions were terminated by the addition of SDS to 0.4%, proteinase K to 0.8 μg/ml, and incubation for 30 min at 40 °C in a total of 100 μl. RNA was extracted with a half volume of phenol, followed by extraction with a half volume of chloroform and precipitation in the presence of 1 μg of glycogen, 0.3m sodium chloride, and 2.4 volumes of ethanol for 16 h at −20 °C. Pellets were collected by centrifugation for 30 min at 4 °C and resuspended in 13 μl of formamide loading buffer, and 7 μl was loaded on a 6 m urea, 15–19% polyacrylamide gel, developed at 50 °C until the bromphenol blue dye reached the bottom. A mixture of oligonucleotides ranging from 15 to 34 bases, end-labeled as described (29Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982Google Scholar), served as size markers. Reaction mixtures containing hexahistidine-tagged polymerase (30Bushnell D.A. Bamdad C. Kornberg R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20170-20174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) and β-mercaptoethanol instead of DTT were incubated with an equal volume of Ni2+-nitriloacetic acid resin (Qiagen), previously equilibrated in the reaction buffer, for 10 min at room temperature with gentle agitation. The resin was washed three times (or more if needed to remove radioactivity from the supernatant) by suspension in 1 ml of buffer and centrifugation for 30 s. The resin was suspended in buffer (25 μl) with nucleotides at 1 mm or as indicated, and reaction was allowed to continue for an additional 20 min at 28 °C, followed by extraction and analysis of RNA as above. For quantitation, halted complexes were separated from free nucleotides by filtration through Sephadex G-50, concentrated by ultrafiltration (Microcon 100; Amicon) and passed through a heparin-Sepharose 6B column. Radioactivity incorporated in halted complexes was compared with total protein determined by the Bradford method (38Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (214455) Google Scholar). RNA polymerase, RNA polymerase-DNA complex, and halted complex were loaded on a 9-cm-long 3.5% Nusieve agarose (FMC Corp. BioProducts), 0.6% LE agarose (ABI Adv. Biotechnologies, Inc.) gel in Tris-borate-EDTA (29Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982Google Scholar) with the addition of 6 mm magnesium sulfate, 5 mm DTT, and 5% glycerol. Electrophoresis was for 6–9 h at 100 V, with continuous cooling of the buffer to maintain 4–20 °C. Gels were fixed in 10% trichloroacetic acid with 5% glycerol for 1 h and stained with Bradford reagent for 9–16 h. A transcription reaction mixture (1 ml) containing RNA polymerase (1 mg), a 1.5–3-fold molar excess of template E (see below), and 1 mm ribonucleotides without UTP was incubated for 20 min at 28 °C and then passed through a 1-ml heparin HiTrap heparin column (Pharmacia). The yield of homogenous paused complex was about 50% of the starting polymerase. The buffer was changed to 5 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 40 mmammonium sulfate, 10 mm DTT, 50 μm zinc sulfate, 50 μm EDTA by filtration with a Microcon 100. Crystallization was effected as described (31Edwards A.M. Darst S.A. Hemming S.A. Li Y. Kornberg R.D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 195-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) with the addition of PEG 6000 to lower the ammonium sulfate concentration to 200 mm, preventing dissociation of the complex. Yeast RNA polymerase II lacking subunits Rpb4 and Rpb7 was employed throughout this work because of its homogeneity and its propensity to form both two- and three-dimensional crystals (31Edwards A.M. Darst S.A. Hemming S.A. Li Y. Kornberg R.D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 195-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). While Rpb4 and Rpb7 are required for promoter-dependent initiation (32Edwards A.E. Kane C.M. Young R.A. Kornberg R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 71-75Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), polymerase lacking these subunits is able to transcribe tailed templates and is indistinguishable from wild-type enzyme in RNA chain elongation (not shown). For initial characterization, enzyme with a hexahistidine tag at the C terminus of the largest subunit, Rpb1, was used, but in subsequent work directed toward crystallization, the tag was omitted. Initial studies employed a plasmid containing a unique AvaI site, adjacent to a 135-bp T-less cassette, terminated by three T residues. Following AvaI digestion and ligation with a synthetic oligonucleotide to introduce a 3′-protruding tail of 18 C residues, transcription in the absence of UTP generated a 135-nucleotide product (Fig. 2), as described by others (25Rice G.A. Kane C.M. Chamberlin M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4245-4249Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). No transcript from the opposite end of the DNA, also bearing a C tail, was detected, presumably due to the presence of several T residues in the coding strand near this end, resulting in the formation of unstable elongation complexes. The 135-nucleotide RNA resided in stable elongation complexes, as shown by three further findings. First, the RNA remained associated with the hexahistidine-tagged polymerase following adsorption on Ni2+-agarose and removal of unbound material. Second, incubation of the Ni2+-bound elongation complex with UTP extended the transcript by three residues (Fig. 2, first lane), as expected if pausing occurred precisely at the end of the T-less cassette. Third, incubation of the Ni2+-bound elongation complex with all four nucleoside triphosphates resulted in conversion of most of the RNA to the length expected for runoff at the opposite end of the DNA or shorter due to arrest between the pause site and the end (Fig. 2). The fraction of paused complexes capable of elongation varied from 50 to 95%, depending on the manner of preparation. For example, vigorous vortex mixing or exposure to elevated ionic strength diminished the number of active complexes. Manipulations such as chromatography and filtration, however, had no deleterious effect. Even following washes of Ni2+-bound halted ternary complex with 2 mpotassium acetate, 32% of paused complexes could be elongated (Fig.2). Complexes were also stable over time, showing no significant loss of activity after a week or more at room temperature (see below). With a view to eventual crystallization of paused complexes, which might be prevented by protruding DNA, we wished to determine the minimal size of template required for complex formation. DNase I footprint analyses (33Rice G.A. Chamberlin M.J. Kane C.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 113-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), showing protection of 20–24 bp upstream and 19–23 bp downstream of the pause site, suggested the size could be reduced to about 50 bp, if not further. A nested set of templates derived from the T-less cassette by insertion of restriction sites showed no loss of complex formation, stability, or capacity to elongate upon reduction of the template to a 51-bp fragment with the pause site in the middle, at nucleotide 27 (Fig. 3). Smaller templates were obtained by oligonucleotide synthesis (Figs. 1 and4). Upon removal of 5 bp from the upstream end and 2 bp from the downstream end of the 51-bp sequence, 47% of the paused complexes were still capable of elongation (Fig. 4). Further removal of 6 and 10 bp from the downstream end had no effect on complex formation but diminished elongation to 9 and 5%, respectively. A length of 22 bp downstream of the halt site was therefore taken as the minimum for the generation of fully active complexes.Figure 4Minimum size of template for paused complex formation. Templates were as in Fig. 1 and as diagrammed on theright, with the number of residues downstream of the first T given. Ni2+-agarose was employed as in Fig. 2. Halted (H) complexes and the products of their subsequent elongation (E) are shown. Positions of markers as in Fig. 3are indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Transcripts from shorter templates were better resolved in gels (Figs.3 and 4), revealing a small degree of length heterogeneity, arising from initiation at a variable location in the single-stranded tail 3–5 residues upstream of the junction with double-stranded DNA. This heterogeneity is a general characteristic of transcription from tailed templates (34Dedrick R.L. Chamberlin M.J. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 2245-2253Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). It posed no impediment to crystallization (see below). All templates derived from the T-less cassette yielded not only the desired products, extending to the halt site, but also a set of shorter RNAs, 15–20 residues in length (Figs.3 and 4). These shorter RNAs did not derive from abortive transcription and release from the polymerase since they were retained with the hexahistidine-tagged enzyme on Ni2+-agarose. They evidently resided in arrested complexes since they were not extended by incubation with all four nucleoside triphosphates and since they could be reactivated by the addition of TFIIS (Fig. 5). There were only small changes in the pattern of arrested transcripts arising from the differences in length and sequence of the several templates used. The arrest site was reached when the RNA transcript was 16–18 bases, and taking into account the variation in transcription start site mentioned above, the polymerase was about 13–15 residues from the beginning of the double-stranded region of the templates. This is in good agreement with the location of early arrest sites reported by others (35Sluder A.E. Price D.H. Greenleaf A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 9917-9925Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Such early arrest is an intrinsic feature of transcription from tailed templates, which is not found for promoter-dependent transcription by the polymerase and general transcription factors. 2D. Price, personal communication. Since heterogeneity in the population of paused complexes formed on tailed templates due to arrest was likely to interfere with crystallization, we sought to avoid the problem by placing the pause site before the early arrest site. The pause site, however, could not be located too far upstream or the transcript would be too short to form a stable complex. These considerations dictated the design of a template (denoted Fin Fig. 6) with the pause site at nucleotide 11 of the double-stranded region. Transcription of this template in the absence of UTP yielded an RNA of about 14 residues (Fig. 1, template F, and Fig. 5). Elongation in the presence of all four nucleoside triphosphates was highly efficient, with about 43% arrest at the early site and most of the remainder continuing to run-off. A variant of this template, known to enhance arrest, was prepared with an oligo(T) tract at the arrest site (7Reines D. Chamberlin M.J. Kane C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 10799-10809Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Kerppola T.M. Kane C.M. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 269-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) and with additional arrest-inducing sequences upstream of the halt site (template E in Fig. 6) to obtain more uniform behavior during elongation of the paused complex. Transcription again yielded an RNA of about 14–15 residues (Fig. 6), and elongation resulted in almost complete conversion to the arrested complex. Template E was used in further work directed toward crystallization, with a view to structure determination of both paused and arrested complexes. The remaining source of heterogeneity to be addressed before crystallization trials was free polymerase in the paused complex preparation, due to the unavoidable presence of inactive polymerase molecules. To gauge the magnitude of the problem, the paused complex preparation was freed of unincorporated radiolabeled nucleotides by gel filtration, and the ratio of radioactivity to protein was determined. The results for several preparations ranged from 50–95% of the polymerase in paused complexes. This contrasted with previous estimates of 15–55% (18Levin J.R. Krummell B.R. Chamberlin M.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 196: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). We therefore sought another approach to the detection and quantitation of paused complexes. We found agarose gel electrophoresis effective for resolving paused complexes from polymerase-template complexes and free polymerase. Paused complexes formed a discrete band, while polymerase-template complexes and free polymerase trailed through the gel, due perhaps to polymerase-agarose interaction (Fig. 7). The gel electrophoretic analysis confirmed the occurrence of a majority of the polymerase in paused complexes. We turned next to the removal of residual-free (inactive) polymerase. In light of reports that heparin inhibits transcription initiation but not elongation, we thought that heparin-Sepharose might bind free polymerase while allowing elongation complexes to flow through. Indeed, about 10–25% of the polymerase in a paused complex preparation bound to heparin-Sepharose while the remainder, including all the radiolabeled RNA, flowed through (Fig.8). The RNA to polymerase ratio in the flow-through was 1.13, compared with 0.8 for the material loaded on the column. (As a control, uncomplexed polymerase was applied and virtually all bound to the column.) The efficacy of this procedure was especially apparent when partially proteolyzed polymerase was used. SDS-PAGE revealed the removal of almost all degraded protein from the heparin-Sepharose flow-through (Fig. 9), indicating that only intact polymerase formed stable elongation complexes.Figure 9Enrichment of intact RNA polymerase II in purified halted elongation complexes. Partially proteolyzed polymerase was employed for halted complex formation and heparin-Sepharose chromatography as in Fig. 8. The starting polymerase (Load) and purified halted complexes (Eluate) were analyzed in an SDS-10% polyacrylamide gel and stained with Coomassie Blue. Bands due to polymerase subunits Rpb1–8 (RBP1–8) are indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Paused elongation complexes prepared from template E and purified by passage through heparin-Sepharose formed plate-like crystals of approximate dimensions of 150 × 60 × 500 μm, some reaching 800 μm in length. About 10% of the plates were single crystals, and the remainder were multilayered (Fig. 10). Crystals were gradually adapted to mother liquor containing cryoprotectant. Cryoprotected crystals were flash frozen in liquid nitrogen using the flash cooling method (37Rodgers D.W. Structure. 1994; 2: 1135-1140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Diffraction data obtained with the synchrotron source at CHESS (beamline F1) were complete to about 6 Å and extended in some directions to 3.5 Å resolution. Processing with DENZO revealed a unit cell with parametersa = 197 Å, b = 220 Å,c = 203 Å, and β = 103° and space group C2. The presence of paused elongation complexes in the crystals was confirmed by incubating a crystal in the presence of ATP, CTP, and [32P]UTP, allowing elongation of existing RNA chains but not the initiation of new chains. The RNA product was detected by gel electrophoresis and autoradiography (Fig. 11). Extensive elongation of RNA in the crystal but not in the mother liquor was observed. Evidently, halted complexes were capable of resuming and completing RNA synthesis in the crystal. Novel aspects of this work include the development of tailed templates for forming homogeneous paused and arrested RNA polymerase II transcription complexes, a gel electrophoretic method for resolving the complexes, the use of heparin-Sepharose for separation from inactive polymerase molecules, and crystallization of paused complexes in a transcriptionally active state. The high stability of the complexes was anticipated from previous studies of the Escherichia colienzyme (18Levin J.R. Krummell B.R. Chamberlin M.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 196: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The fraction of active polymerase molecules, however, about 80%, was surprising in light of previous estimates for both yeast and E. coli enzymes of 15–55% (18Levin J.R. Krummell B.R. Chamberlin M.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 196: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The reason for the discrepancy may lie in the methods of estimation. Our figure was obtained from the ratio of RNA to protein in the paused complex preparation, supported by direct visualization in agarose gels and by the results of heparin-Sepharose chromatography. The previous numbers relied on quantitation of RNA in gels, which may underestimate the amount, or on measurements of elongation rates, which may vary with the precise conditions used. Early arrest at a transcript length of about 16 residues is evidently a general property of tailed templates (35Sluder A.E. Price D.H. Greenleaf A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 9917-9925Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The similarity to the size of the unwound “bubble” in transcription complexes suggests a possible structural basis for arrest. Coding and noncoding strands ordinarily reassociate upstream of the bubble, for example in promoter-driven transcription. Such reassociation can only occur for tailed templates after transcription to about residue 16 and may fail for lack of suitable approximation of the strands, leading to arrest. Subtle differences in the pattern of arrest sites for different templates noted here may be due to the sequence dependence of DNA reassociation and may also reflect template dependence of polymerase conformational changes between elongating and arrested states. The remarkable outcome of this work is the formation of paused complex crystals capable of diffraction to 3.5Å resolution. In view of the possibilities for modification of DNA and RNA with heavy atom compounds, as well as structural information forthcoming from studies of the native polymerase and polymerase-DNA complexes, 3J. Fu, P. David, D. Bushnell, personal commununication. the prospects for structure determination of the paused complex appear favorable. The activity of the paused complex in the crystal, continuing RNA synthesisin situ with no adverse affect on crystal morphology, holds the further promise of structural analysis of the transcription mechanism.

The co-expression of WT1 and PAX 8 during kidney development and in Wilms' tumors with an epithelium predominant histology suggested a possible interaction, and indeed, we identified potential core PAX-binding sites in the WT1 promoter. Endogenous PAX 8 plays an important role in the activation of the WT1promoter, since promoter activity is much stronger in cells with PAX 8 than without. Using binding assays, we searched for evidence of PAX 8-DNA interactions throughout the 652-base pair human WT1promoter and found only one functional PAX 8 site with DNA binding activity, located 250 base pairs 5′ of the minimal promoter. The responsiveness of the PAX 8 site was confirmed by assessing its ability to function as an enhancer significantly activating the minimal promoter in a position- and orientation-independent manner. Using transfection assays, we demonstrated that either endogenous or exogenously added PAX 8 activated the WT1 promoter and that this promoter up-regulation depended upon the presence of an intact PAX 8-binding site. In contrast, the previously reported core PAX 8-binding sites identified by computer analysis of the WT1 promoter failed to specifically bind in vitro translated PAX 8 protein or activate the minimal promoter. Thus, we identified a novel functional binding site for the transcription factor PAX 8, suggesting that part of its role in kidney development may be as a modulator of WT1 expression in the kidney.

WT1 is essential for the differentiation of mesenchymal blastema to epithelial and stromal structures during kidney development. Kidney development is arrested in transgenic mice containing a homozygous deletion in the WT1 gene (20Pritchard-Jones K. Fleming S. Davidson D. Bickmore W. Porteous D. Gosden C. Bard J. Buckler A. Pelletier J. Housman D.E. van Heyningen V. Hastie N. Nature. 1991; 346: 194-197Crossref Scopus (769) Google Scholar). Homozygous WT1mutations result in embryonic lethality and developmental defects in the urogenital system, heart, lungs, and mesothelia. During embryogenesis, WT1 is expressed at high levels in the genitourinary system (21Park S. Schalling M. Bernard A. Maheswaran S. Shipley G. Roberts D. Fletcher J. Shipman R. Rheinwald J. Demetri G.

In the adult, WT1 is expressed in the testes, mesothelia, and immature hematopoietic progenitor cells,e.g. CD34+ bone marrow cells (22Armstrong J. Pritchard-Jones K. Bickmore W. Hastie N. Bard B.

Cell. 1993; 74: 679-691Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1672) Google Scholar). Differential WT1 expression during development suggests that WT1 expression is tightly regulated by tissue-specific transcription factors. PAX 8 encodes a developmentally important paired box transcription factor that is expressed in the developing kidney, among other tissues (26Stuart E.T. Gruss P. Cell Growth Differ. 1996; 7: 405-412PubMed Google Scholar). The expression of PAX 8 in the developing kidney precedes WT1 expression. Its expression initiates in the induced condensing mesenchyme, peaks in the S-shaped bodies, and finally declines in the epithelial cells of the glomerulus (27Poleev A. Fickenscher H. Mundlos S. Winterpacht A. Zabel B. Fidler A. Gruss P. Plachov D. Development. 1992; 116: 611-623Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The WT1 expression pattern is similar to the PAX 8 pattern, with its peak occurring after PAX 8 expression begins to decline and WT1 expression persists in the mature podocytes of the glomerulii (27Poleev A. Fickenscher H. Mundlos S. Winterpacht A. Zabel B. Fidler A. Gruss P. Plachov D. Development. 1992; 116: 611-623Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Plachov D. Chowdhury K. Whalther C. Simon D. Guenet J.L. Gruss P. Development. 1990; 110: 643-651Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Like WT1 expression, PAX 8 expression has also been found in the Wilms' tumors with an epithelial predominant histology 2S. Hamada and G. F. Saunders, unpublished observations. (27Poleev A. Fickenscher H. Mundlos S. Winterpacht A. Zabel B. Fidler A. Gruss P. Plachov D. Development. 1992; 116: 611-623Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Miwa H. Tomlinson G.E. Timmons C.F. Huff V. Cohn S.L.

Surg. 1994; 29: 134-141Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The presence of PAX 8 mRNA in these tumors with high WT1 expression is consistent with its postulated role as an activator of WT1 expression. PAX 8 paralogues include PAX 2 and PAX 5. UnlikePAX 2 and PAX 8, PAX 5 is expressed in developing hematopoietic cells (pre-B cells). While in vivodownstream target genes have not been identified for thesePAX genes, several genes whose expression is regulated by PAX 5 and PAX 8 in vitro have been identified, and consensus binding sites have been defined by oligonucleotide selection methods. PAX 5 can regulate expression of the B cell-specific surface protein CD19 (31Kozmik Z. Kurzbauer R. Dorfler P. Busslinger M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6024-6035Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), and PAX 8 can regulate expression of thyroperoxidase and thyroglobin (32Zannini M. Francis-Lang H. Plachov D. Di Lauro R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4230-4241Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Recently, engrailed-2 was shown to be a target gene for Pax 2, Pax 5, and Pax 8 (which are co-expressed with Engrailed-2) in mouse embryos during mid-hindbrain development (33Song D.-L. Chalepakis G. Gruss P. Joyner A. Development. 1996; 122: 627-635PubMed Google Scholar). PAX 2, PAX 5, and PAX 8 each have only a partial homeodomain, so DNA binding is mediated by the paired domain, which is composed of three α-helices. The NH2-terminal subdomain of the paired domain is highly conserved and binds a core recognition sequence of the PAX-binding site. However, the COOH-terminal subdomain also influences site-specific binding (34Jun S. Desplan C. Development. 1996; 122: 2639-2650Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). While the WT1 promoter coupled to the SV40 enhancer strongly activates transcription in all cell lines tested (35Fraizer G.C. Wu Y.-J. Hewitt S.M. Maity T. Ton C.C.T. Huff V. Saunders G.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8892-8900Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), its basal activity varies among cell lines, suggesting differential transactivation by tissue-specific factors. In constructs lacking the SV40 enhancer, the transcriptional activity of the WT1promoter is much lower, as is typical of a TATA-less, CCAAT-less, GC-rich promoter. The ubiquitous transcription factor Sp1 has been shown by footprint analysis to bind at many positions throughout theWT1 promoter and to transactivate the promoter region in cotransfection assays (36Hofmann W. Royer H.-D. Drechsler M. Schneider S. Royer-Pokora B. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 3123-3132PubMed Google Scholar, 37Cohen H.T. Bossone S.A. Zhu G. McDonald G.A. Sukhatme V.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2901-2913Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). WT1 protein also binds at many positions throughout the WT1 promoter, and the least abundant isoforms lacking the KTS insertion strongly repress theWT1 promoter in cotransfection assays (38Rupprecht H.D. Drummond I.A. Madden S.L. Rauscher III, F.J. Sukhatme V.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6198-6206Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 39Hewitt S.M. Fraizer G.C. Wu Y.-J. Rauscher III, F.J. Saunders G.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8588-8592Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The autoregulatory sites in the WT1 promoter may be essential for the down-regulation of WT1 expression observed during the differentiation of leukemic cells (40Sekiya M. Adachi M. Hinoda Y. Imai K. Yachi A. Blood. 1994; 83: 1876-1882Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 41Phelan S.A. Lindberg C. Call K.M. Cell Growth Differ. 1994; 5: 677-686PubMed Google Scholar). Using deletion analysis, we previously identified the minimal promoter region necessary and sufficient for promoter activity in K562 and HeLa cells (35Fraizer G.C. Wu Y.-J. Hewitt S.M. Maity T. Ton C.C.T. Huff V. Saunders G.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8892-8900Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This 104-bp minimal promoter is GC-rich (79% G + C); contains seven overlapping potential transcription factor binding sites within a core of 30 bp, including Sp1, AP4, WT1, and CACCC binding sites; and has half the transcriptional activity of the full-length WT1promoter. To better understand the mechanism for differential promoter activity in various cell lines, derived from different tissues, we examined the 5′-flanking region of the full-length human WT1 promoter. Sequence analysis identified potential binding sites for the zinc finger GATA factors (42Evans T. Reitman M. Felsenfeld G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 5976-5980Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar) and two paired box transcription factors, PAX 8 (32Zannini M. Francis-Lang H. Plachov D. Di Lauro R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4230-4241Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar) and PAX 2 (43Epstein J. Cai J. Glaser T. Jepeal L. Mass R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8355-8361Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The latter two are co-expressed with WT1 in the kidney and may contribute to kidney expression of WT1 in vivo. Recently, the murine WT1 promoter was shown to be transactivated by both Pax 2 and Pax 8 (44Dehbi M. Pelletier J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4297-4306Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 45Dehbi M. Ghahremani M. Lechner M. Dressler G. Pelletier J. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 447-453PubMed Google Scholar). We have identified a novel consensus site 250 bp 5′ of the minimal promoter that strongly bound PAX 8 and mediated potent PAX 8 transactivation of the human WT1 promoter. This is in contrast to the potential PAX 8-binding sites previously identified in the human WT1 promoter (35Fraizer G.C. Wu Y.-J. Hewitt S.M. Maity T. Ton C.C.T. Huff V. Saunders G.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8892-8900Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which were unable to bind PAX 8 or mediate transactivation ofWT1. Cell lines 293 (derived from adenovirus 5-transformed human embryonic kidney cells) (CRL1573; American Type Culture Collection (ATCC), Rockville, MD), ACHN (human renal carcinoma cells) (CRL1611, ATCC), Madin-Darby canine kidney cells (CCL34, ATCC), and HeLa (a human cervical carcinoma cell line) (CCL2, ATCC) were grown in Eagle's minimal essential medium. Renal carcinoma cells Caki-1 and Caki-2 (HTB46 and -47, respectively; ATCC) were grown in McCoy's 5a medium. BHK, a cell line derived from baby hamster kidney cells (CRL10, ATCC) was grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. TM4, a mouse Sertoli cell line (CCL1715, ATCC) was grown in a 1:1 mixture of Ham's F-12 and Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. K562, a cell line derived from a human chronic myelogenous leukemia in blast crisis (ATCC, CCL243), was maintained in RPMI 1640 medium. All cells were maintained in media supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Monolayers were seeded, and the suspension culture (K562) was split 48–72 h before transfection. The cells were transfected while in the log phase of growth, i.e. the monolayers were <75% confluent, and the suspension cultures were at <5 × 105 cells/ml. The 652-bpHindIII-PstI fragment comprising theWT1 promoter contains potential binding sites for the PAX, GATA, E2A, Sp1, and WT1 transcription factors (Fig. 1). To determine the role of the PAX core binding sites, we subcloned the 5′-flanking region containing two potential PAX 8 core sites (CTGCCC) and the distal potential PAX 2 core site (GTTCCC) but lacking the most 5′ novel PAX site, WT1 PAX CON. The 652-bp WT1 promoter was used as a template for PCR amplification of the 130-bp fragment with primers altered to insert BamHI sites (altered bases are in boldface type) as described elsewhere (35Fraizer G.C. Wu Y.-J. Hewitt S.M. Maity T. Ton C.C.T. Huff V. Saunders G.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8892-8900Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The forward PCR primer (5′-CTGCGGGATCCTGAAGTTCC-3′) (bp 20–39) and the reverse PCR primer (5′-TTCAGGTAAGCAGTGGATCCG-3′) (bp 128–149) were derived from the 5′-flanking region of the promoter sequence (beginning 20 bp 3′ of the HindIII site). The PCR product was digested with BamHI, and the resulting 104-bp BamHI fragment was purified on a Qiagen column (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA) and cloned in the reverse orientation into the BamHI site of theWT1 minimal promoter construct pcb.1 to create the 5′-flanking construct, pcb.1e.1. The orientation and sequence of the 5′-flanking region were confirmed by sequence analysis. To determine if the novel WT1 PAX CON site was sufficient for PAX 8 transactivation of WT1, we cloned the 30-bp double-stranded oligonucleotide used in EMSA (see below) 3′ of the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene in pcb.l, the minimal WT1promoter construct. Initially, BamHI linkers were ligated to the 30-mer, and then both the double-stranded oligonucleotide insert and promoter construct were digested with BamHI. The free linkers were removed from the insert by column chromatography, and the insert was ligated to phosphatase-treated pcb.1, the minimalWT1 promoter construct, to create the PAX 8-enhancer construct, pcb.le.05. While the WT1 promoter construct pcb.7PH contains several potential PAX 8-binding sites, the only site able to bind PAX 8 in EMSA is at the most 5′-end of the 652-bp promoter. The mutant transactivation reporter target construct was created by PCR amplification of the 652-bp WT1 promoter in pcb.7PH by using a forward PCR primer (5′-TATGACCAAGCTTACGCCAAGATTGTCTGAGTTCTTTCTG-3′) containing the WT1 promoter 5′-flanking sequence (underlined) with a mutant PAX 8 site (as discussed below) and pCAT®-Basic 5′-flanking sequence containing a 2-bp mismatch to create a HindIII site (altered bases are in boldface type). The reverse PCR primer S3 (5′-CTCCTGAAAATCTCGCCAAGC-3′) was derived from pCAT®-Basic and is adjacent to the PstI cloning site. The PCR-amplified fragment was digested with HindIII andPstI, and the resulting 661-bp promoter fragment was cloned into the HindIII and PstI-digested pCAT®-Basic vector to create mpcb.7PH (replacing the wild-type promoter in pcb.7PH). The mutagenized binding site and its orientation in the clone were verified by DNA sequence analysis. K562, 293, and HeLa cells were transfected with pcb.1, pcb.1e.1, pcb.le.05, pcb.7PH, and mutant pcb.7PH as described previously (35Fraizer G.C. Wu Y.-J. Hewitt S.M. Maity T. Ton C.C.T. Huff V.

As an internal control for transfection efficiency, the cells were cotransfected with 5 μg of the β-galactosidase control DNA, pSV40β-Gal (Promega Corp., Madison, WI). The cells were harvested, cytoplasmic extracts were prepared, and β-galactosidase activity was determined as described previously (35Fraizer G.C. Wu Y.-J. Hewitt S.M. Maity T. Ton C.C.T. Huff V. Saunders G.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8892-8900Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Extracts containing equivalent amounts of β-galactosidase activity were assayed for CAT activity (47Gorman C.M. Moffat L.F. Howard B.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1982; 2: 1044-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (5292) Google Scholar). The protein content of the cell extracts was also determined by the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad), and the CAT assays were performed with extracts containing 25–50 μg of protein (for K562 cells) or 50–100 μg of protein (for the other cell lines). After thin layer chromatography, the acetylated [14C]chloramphenicol was quantitated by measuring the radioactivity with a Betascope 603 blot analyzer (Betagen Corp., Waltham, MA). The relative activities shown are the averages from at least three different experiments. For transactivation assays PAX 8 was co-transfected into HeLa cells as described above except that increasing amounts of the human PAX 8 cDNA expression construct (48Hewitt S.M. Hamada S. Monarres A. Kotticap L.V. Saunders G.F. McDonnell T.J. Anticancer Res. 1997; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar), pSVK3PAX8, were added to each transfection of 5 μg of reporter pcb.7PH and 2 μg of pSV40β-Gal. The PAX 8 expression construct contains a 1.4-kilobase pair PAX8 cDNA including the entire open reading frame of the predominant isoform PAX 8a (32Zannini M. Francis-Lang H. Plachov D. Di Lauro R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4230-4241Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). This cDNA was initially obtained by screening a human fetal kidney cDNA library (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) and was cloned into the expression vector pSVK3 (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) (48Hewitt S.M. Hamada S. Monarres A. Kotticap L.V. Saunders G.F. McDonnell T.J. Anticancer Res. 1997; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). The mutant clone containing a mutagenized PAX 8-binding site mut.pcb.7pH, the empty pCAT®-Basic vector (Promega), the minimal promoter pcb.1e.1, and the PAX 8 enhancer construct pcb.1e.05 were also cotransfected with 5 or 10 μg of the PAX 8 expression construct and 2 μg of pSV40β-Gal. Total cellular RNA was extracted from 2-day-old mouse kidneys and all cell lines described above by the method of Chomczynski and Sacchi (49Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar) with STAT-60 (Tel Test, Friendswood, TX) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. First strand cDNA synthesis and PCR amplification were performed as described previously (50Patmasiriwat P. Fraizer G.C. Claxton D. Kantarjian H. Saunders G.F. Leukemia. 1996; 10: 1127-1133PubMed Google Scholar). PCR amplification of cDNA encoding the Pro-Ser-Thr transactivation domain and carboxyl terminus of the PAX 8 gene in human samples was performed by using the primer pairs: forward PAX 8 (5′-TCCACCCCTTCCTCTTTATCT-3′) and reverse PAX 8 (5′-AGTCCTCCTGTTGCTCAGTCG-3′). As a control, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) cDNA was amplified by using forward GAPDH (5′-TTGCCATCAATGACCCCTTCA-3′) and reverseGAPDH (5′-CCAGTGAGCTTCCCGTTCAGC-3′). The cDNA encoding the octapeptide, homeodomain, and 5′-end of the Pro-Ser-Thr transactivation domain of the PAX 8 gene in non-human samples was amplified by PCR with the murine Pax 8 primer pairs forward murine Pax 8 (5′-AAGTCTCTGAGCCCAGGACA-3′) and reverse murinePax 8 (5′-GGATCTGCAGCAAGTCGGCT-3′). PCR amplification of cDNA encoding the WT1 zinc finger region and β-actin gene in human and non-human samples was carried out using the human and murine primer pairs as described (23Fraizer G.C. Patmasiriwat P. Zhang X.-H. Saunders G.F. Blood. 1995; 86: 4704-4707Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 46Wu Y. Fraizer G.C. Saunders G.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5944-5949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The conditions for PAX 8and GAPDH co-amplification were 3 min of denaturation at 95 °C; 35 cycles of 94 °C denaturation for 1 min, 58 °C (human) or 64 °C (murine) annealing for 2 min, and 72 °C extension for 2 min; and a final 5-min extension at 72 °C. To compensate for the overabundance of GAPDH and β-actin mRNA, we used 110 the concentration of GAPDH and β-actin primers as PAX 8 primers (0.2 μm). The PCR products were analyzed on an ethidium bromide-stained 1.5% agarose gel. The size marker used was a 100-bp DNA ladder (Life Technologies, Inc.). The duplex PCR amplification resulted in PCR products of the expected sizes: 600 bp for GAPDH, 441 bp for human PAX 8, 558 bp for murine Pax 8, 330 bp for murineWT1, and 540 bp for β-actin. EMSAs were performed by using Caki-1 renal cell nuclear extracts and in vitro translated PAX 8 protein. The in vitro PAX 8 expression construct pBSPAX8 was derived from the PAX 8 expression construct pSVK3PAX8. The 1.4-kilobase pair PAX 8 coding sequence was released by EcoRI digestion, gel-purified, and subcloned into the EcoRI site in pBlueScript II (Stratagene). The adjacent T7 polymerase binding site was used forin vitro transcription according to the manufacturer's recommendations (Promega). PAX 8 protein was translated in vitro by coupled transcription and translation of 1 μg of the PAX 8 expression construct pBSPAX8 in a wheat germ extract system according to the manufacturer's recommendations (Promega). The molecular size of the PAX 8 protein product was confirmed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of [35S]methionine-labeled cell extracts and compared with prestained molecular weight markers (Amersham Corp.). Nuclear miniextracts were prepared from exponentially growing K562 and Caki-1 cells by the method of Dignam et al. (51Dignam J.D. Martin P.L. Shastry B.S. Roeder R.G. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 101: 582-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (746) Google Scholar) as modified by Leeet al. (52Lee K.A.W. Bindereif A. Green M.R. Gene Anal. Technol. 1988; 5: 22-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). The EMSAs were performed essentially as described by Singh et al. (53Singh H. Sen R. Baltimore D. Sharp P.A. Nature. 1988; 319: 154-158Crossref Scopus (624) Google Scholar). The 30-bp double-stranded oligonucleotides were labeled with [γ-32P]ATP by using T4 polynucleotide kinase. TheWT1 promoter PAX consensus probe (WT1 PAX CON), 5′-CGCTTCTTTGAAGCTTGACTGAGTTCTTTC-3′, was used to identify the PAX 8-binding site (predicted consensus PAX 8-binding sites are underlined). Radiolabeled control PAX 8 oligonucleotide CT (5′-TGATGCCCACTCAAGCTTAGACAGG-3′), which was derived from the thyroperoxidase gene (32Zannini M. Francis-Lang H. Plachov D. Di Lauro R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4230-4241Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar), was used as a positive control for comparison with the WT1 promoter probe WT1 PAX CON. One to two hundred fmol of labeled oligonucleotide (1–4 × 105 cpm) was incubated with either 6 μg of the nuclear protein extracts or 1 μl of a 50-μl reaction of in vitrotranslated PAX 8 protein lysate and 2 μg of poly(dI-dC) in 15 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 6.5% glycerol, 90 mmKCl, 0.7 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.1% bovine serum albumin. After a 30-min incubation at room temperature, the reaction mixture was analyzed by electrophoresis at 300 V on a 5% polyacrylamide/bisacrylamide gel (39:1) in 0.5 × TBE (45 mm Tris borate, and 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0), dried, and visualized by autoradiography with Hyperfilm-AP film (Amersham). For competition assays, the unlabeled double-stranded PAX 8 oligonucleotide CT and consensus GATA oligonucleotide (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) were used as positive and negative controls, respectively.

The motor domain of approximately 350 amino acid residues shows 40% homology with kinesin, and the three-dimensional structures of the Ncd and kinesin motor domains are similar (4Sablin E.P.

Biol. 1996; 257: 66-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) have shown that there are similarities in the reaction mechanism despite the difference in rate and polarity of movement. The dissociation of ADP is the rate-limiting step in ATP hydrolysis in the absence of microtubules, and the rate is markedly increased by microtubule binding. The rate of ADP dissociation makes a major contribution to rate-limiting the fully activated ATPase based on measurements of the maximum rate of dissociation of ADP in the reaction of the motor-ADP complex with microtubules. The ratio of the rate of ADP dissociation to V m is approximately 1.5 for Ncd, and a similar ratio was obtained for various kinesin constructs (9Ma Y.Z. Taylor E.W. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13242-13251Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar,10Ma Y.Z. Taylor E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 717-723Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). However, Gilbert et al. (11Gilbert S.P. Webb M.R. Brune M. Johnson K.A. Nature. 1995; 373: 671-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar) obtained a much higher rate of dissociation of ADP for a Drosophila kinesin and concluded that ADP dissociation was not rate-limiting. The present work was undertaken to provide a more detailed kinetic scheme for an Ncd monomer and to compare the scheme with a kinesin monomer (human kinesin construct K332). A difficult problem in studying Ncd is that removal of the strongly bound ADP leads to aggregation and denaturation of the protein. The microtubule-Ncd complex is sufficiently stable in the absence of bound nucleotide to permit kinetic measurements to be made for comparison with the microtubule-kinesin complex. The microtubule-activated Ncd is very similar to kinesin in showing a phosphate burst phase, and the hydrolysis of ATP is rate-limited by ADP release. It could be approximately described as a slow kinesin. However, the relative rates of some steps in the mechanism, including the rates of dissociation of the Mt·Ncd complex compared with the rates of the hydrolysis and ADP release steps, are significantly different from kinesin, which raises the possibility that the main reaction pathways are different for Ncd and kinesin. The Ncd motor domain, Arg-335–Lys-700, was prepared from BL21 (DE3) host cells transformed by the recombinant plasmid pHB40P-Ncd. The purification was described in Shimizu et al. (7Shimizu T. Sablin E. Vale R.D. Fletterick R. Pechatnikova E. Taylor E.W. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13259-13266Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The protein was stored at −80 °C in standard buffer (25 mm PIPES, pH 6.9, 1 mm EGTA, 2 mm MgCl2) plus 50 mm NaCl, 10% sucrose, and 1 mol of ATP/mol of Ncd. The purification of tubulin from porcine brain and the preparation of microtubules were described in Ma and Taylor (9Ma Y.Z. Taylor E.W. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13242-13251Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Taxol at a concentration of 15 μm was present in all solutions of microtubules. [3H]Ncd was obtained by reaction withN-succinimidyl-[2,3-3H]propionate (Amersham Life Science, Inc.) as described in Ma and Taylor (9Ma Y.Z. Taylor E.W. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13242-13251Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). A nucleotide-free microtubule-Ncd complex was obtained by treatment with apyrase (Grade VII; Sigma) in standard buffer plus 50 mm NaCl. An apyrase concentration of 0.003 mg/ml was sufficient to release all bound ADP in 40 min at room temperature from 40 μm Ncd-microtubule complex as assayed by the decrease in fluorescence of bound MANT ADP. Hydrolysis of ATP or ADP by this concentration of apyrase could be neglected in transient phase experiments. The binding of [3H]Ncd to microtubules was measured by a sedimentation method (9Ma Y.Z. Taylor E.W. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13242-13251Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Before use, the Ncd solution was centrifuged at maximum speed (29.5 p.s.i.) for 15 min in the Beckman Airfuge to remove any aggregates. The binding was calculated from the radioactivity of the supernatant and pellet versus total radioactivity before centrifugation. The fractional binding was 85–95% in the presence of 1 mm AMP-PNP even at the highest ionic strength (100 mm NaCl, in standard buffer). The binding runs in different experiments were normalized to the binding in the presence of AMP-PNP. Nucleotide binding and dissociation were measured using fluorescent substrate analogues; 2′-(3′)-O-(N-methylanthraniloyl) ATP and ADP, 2′-deoxy-3′-O-(N-methylanthraniloyl) ATP, and 3′-deoxy-2′-O-(N-methylanthraniloyl) ATP were prepared from ATP, ADP, 2′-dATP, and 3′-dATP, respectively, and purified as described in Ma and Taylor (9Ma Y.Z. Taylor E.W. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13242-13251Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The purity of the various samples was checked by thin layer chromatography (1-propanol/NH4OH/H2O, 6:3:1, by volume plus 0.5 g/liter EDTA and 2-propanol/H2O/HCl, 65:18.4:11.6 on silica plates). Stopped flow and chemical quench flow measurements were made as described previously (9Ma Y.Z. Taylor E.W. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13242-13251Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Slow reactions of MANT ADP or MANT ATP were measured in a Perkin-Elmer MPF 44A fluorometer (excitation, 365 nm; emission, 440 nm; the same wavelengths were used in stopped-flow experiments). ATPase activity was determined using [γ-32P]ATP. [32P]Pi produced by hydrolysis was separated from unreacted nucleotide on charcoal columns, and the fractional hydrolysis relative to total counts was measured as described previously (12Sadhu A. Taylor E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11352-11359Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). At least three time points were taken for steady state rate measurements. Simulation of the mechanism was done using the KINSIM program. Some properties of the Ncd motor domain ATPase were reported in a previous study (7Shimizu T. Sablin E. Vale R.D. Fletterick R. Pechatnikova E. Taylor E.W. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13259-13266Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In the absence of microtubules, the ATPase activity is 0.003 s−1at 25 °C, and the dissociation of ADP is the rate-limiting step. The activity is increased about 1,000-fold by microtubules. The maximum rate (V m ) obtained by fitting the dependence on microtubule concentration to a hyperbola is equal to 3.0 s−1 in 25 mm NaCl in standard buffer. The maximum rate decreased slightly with increasing ionic strength butK m (Mt), the tubulin dimer concentration at half-maximum rate, was strongly dependent on ionic strength and increased 4-fold for an increase in NaCl concentration from 25 to 50 mm.

The binding of Ncd to microtubules in the presence of various nucleotides was measured for a range of ionic strengths. Binding curves in the presence of ATPγS, ADP, ADP-AlF4, and ADP-vanadate are shown in Fig. 1. Dissociation constants were obtained by an unconstrained fit of each data set to a hyperbola (Table I). For the relatively strongly bound complexes with ATPγS and ADP-AlF4, the observed values of the binding reached 0.7, and the maximum values calculated from the fit are in the range 0.75–0.8, normalized to the binding in the presence of AMP-PNP. For weakly bound complexes with ADP or ADP-vanadate, the observed values are less than 0.5, and the extrapolated maximum binding was only 0.6–0.65. The dissociation constants of the complexes with ADP or ADP-vanadate would be 30% larger if the fit was constrained to a maximum binding of 0.75. However, the order of increase in the dissociation constants is not changed by the fitting procedure. The dissociation constants increase in the order K m MT <K d ATPγS) ≃K d ADP-AlF4 <K d ATP < K d ADP <K d ADP-vanadate. All dissociation constants increased markedly with increasing ionic strength. The values in 50 mm NaCl are approximately two to three times larger than in 25 mm NaCl, but the order was unchanged (data not shown). Ncd in a strongly bound complex with microtubules appears to be more stable than free Ncd. It was noted in various binding or kinetic experiments that there was a slow loss of activity with time of storage of the protein. However, even with freshly prepared Ncd, the normalized binding curve for a Ncd·ADP complex did not extrapolate to unity. It is possible that a fraction of the protein may be converted to a state that is very weakly bound to microtubules. Freshly prepared Ncd contained 0.9–0.95 mol of nucleotide binding sites/mol of protein, determined by dialysis against [3H]ADP. There was a slow loss of binding sites with storage. Bound MANT ATP or MANT ADP gave a fluorescence emission of 1.6–1.7 times the value for free nucleotide. To use this enhancement for transient kinetic studies, it is necessary to remove the strongly bound ADP. All attempts to prepare active nucleotide-free Ncd were unsuccessful. The bound ADP can be removed by treatment with EDTA or by hydrolysis of free ADP by apyrase. The ADP was first exchanged with MANT ADP, and the time course of release was followed by measurements of the decrease in fluorescence enhancement. Addition of excess MANT ADP immediately after completion of release did allow some rebinding, but the rate of the reaction was slow, and the process appeared to be rate-limited by an isomerization of the protein. The nucleotide-free Ncd began to precipitate in 10 min, and it would no longer rebind nucleotide. Similar difficulties have recently been reported (8Crevel I.M.-T.C. Lockhart A. Cross R.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 257: 66-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Consequently, transient kinetic measurements on Ncd were limited to measuring the rate of MANT ADP dissociation by microtubules (7Shimizu T. Sablin E. Vale R.D. Fletterick R. Pechatnikova E. Taylor E.W. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13259-13266Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 8Crevel I.M.-T.C. Lockhart A. Cross R.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 257: 66-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). * The formation of a complex of Ncd with microtubules reduces the affinity for ADP, and the binding to microtubules prevented aggregation of the Ncd. Free nucleotide was first removed from the stock solution of the Ncd·ADP complex by a centrifuge column step. The addition of microtubules caused the dissociation of about half of the bound ADP if the total concentration of Ncd was less than 5 μm. Sedimentation of Mt·Ncd and resuspension yielded a complex that could be used for transient experiments. Complete removal of bound ADP was obtained by treatment of Mt·Ncd with a low concentration of apyrase. Although Ncd is expected to be strongly bound to microtubules in the absence of nucleotide, only 55–65% nucleotide-free Ncd was bound to microtubules, as determined by sedimentation of a microtubule-[3H]Ncd complex. The Ncd that is not bound to microtubules is no longer active, and it does not contribute to the transient kinetics. The binding of MANT ATP to the Mt·Ncd complex gave a two-step fluorescence change, an increase followed by a decrease (Fig.2 A). The same type of biphasic signal was observed with kinesin constructs (9Ma Y.Z. Taylor E.W. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13242-13251Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 10Ma Y.Z. Taylor E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 717-723Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The apparent rate constants were obtained by fitting the data to two exponential terms. The plot of the rate constant for the increase phase showed only a small deviation from a straight line (Fig. 2 B).The maximum rate of the transition could not be determined, although the value is greater than 300 s−1. The slope gave an apparent second order rate constant k a of 1.5 × 106m−1 s−1. This value is in the range usually obtained for nucleotide binding, and it is similar to the value for kinesin. The apparent rate constant of the decrease in fluorescence was essentially constant over the range of substrate concentration and equal to 25 s−1. A constant value is consistent with two transitions in sequence. The intercept of the plot of the rate of substrate binding obtained by linear extrapolation to zero concentration was 7–10 s−1in three experiments. For the case of a simple mechanism, substrate binding, an essentially irreversible hydrolysis step and release of products, the intercept is equal to the effective rate constant of product release (discussed in Refs. 9Ma Y.Z. Taylor E.W. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13242-13251Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar and 10Ma Y.Z. Taylor E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 717-723Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Since the effective rate of product release must be somewhat larger than the maximum steady state rate, a value of about 5 s−1 was expected. The higher value obtained for the intercept could arise because the phase of decrease in the fluorescence transient can affect the fit to one exponential term at low substrate concentrations (9Ma Y.Z.

It was shown for kinesin that 2′-deoxy,3′-MANT ATP gives rise to a much larger decrease phase, whereas 3′-deoxy,2′-MANT ATP gives essentially no decrease (9Ma Y.Z. Taylor E.W. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13242-13251Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 10Ma Y.Z. Taylor E.W. J. Biol.

In the case of 3′-deoxy,2′-MANT ATP, the fitting of rate constants is no longer affected by a decrease phase, and the intercept of the plot of rate constant versus substrate concentration was 5 s−1 (data not shown). It is concluded that the kinetic data are consistent with an effective rate of product release of 5–7 s−1. Rate constants are summarized in TableII.Table IIKinetic constants of nucleotide binding reactions of Mt·NcdSubstratek aMaximum rateRate of second fluorescence changem −1 s −1s −1s −1MANT ATP1.5 × 106>30025 ± 4 (d)3′-MANT dATP3.6 × 106>30023 (d)MANT ADP2.5 × 106220 ± 1040 ± 4 (i)k a is the initial slope at low concentrations (<5 μm) of the plot of rate constant versusconcentration; (d) refers to fluorescence decrease phase for MANT ATP and 3′-MANT,2′-dATP; (i) refers to second rate constant of fluorescence increase for MANT ADP.

Nucleotide-free Mt·Ncd was obtained by treatment with apyrase. Control experiments in which microtubules plus apyrase were reacted with ATP showed no phosphate burst phase. The hydrolysis of ATP by apyrase can contribute up to 20% steady state turnover rate of Mt·Ncd. Approximately one-third of the nucleotide-free Ncd is not bound to microtubules, as shown by sedimentation of the Mt·Ncd complex, and this fraction of the Ncd has lost nucleotide binding activity. Sedimentation and resuspension of Mt·Ncd to remove inactive Ncd led to further loss of nucleotide binding activity. The presence of inactive protein does not affect the value of the rate constant of the transient phase obtained by fitting to an exponential term, but it reduces the size of the phosphate burst. The data, expressed as mol of phosphate/mol of Ncd, have been corrected for inactive Ncd. A rate constant of 18 ± 1 s−1 was obtained from four measurements. The size of the phosphate burst, corrected for inactive protein, was 0.7 for freshly prepared protein, but values of 0.5 were obtained with protein that had been stored frozen. Measurements at 75 and 100 μm ATP gave the same rate constant within 10%; consequently, the observed rate constant corresponds to the maximum rate. At a microtubule concentration of 20 μm, the Mt·Ncd complex remains mainly associated in 25 mm NaCl, based on the dissociation constant (Table I). One experiment was done at 150 mm NaCl, which would give a high degree of dissociation in the steady state, and the burst rate was 13 s−1. The dissociation of the Mt·Ncd complex by ATP was measured by the small decrease in light scattering (Fig. 4). It was necessary to average three or more traces to reduce the noise level. The rate constant is 10 s−1, and the maximum rate was reached at 75–100 μm ATP. A larger rate of dissociation was observed with ADP, but the signal was too noisy to be analyzed satisfactorily. A dimeric Ncd, which gives a much larger change in light scattering, also showed a higher rate of dissociation by ADP than by ATP. 2E. Pechatnikova and E. W. Taylor, manuscript in preparation. The binding of MANT ADP to Mt·Ncd gave a fluorescence increase that was fitted by two exponential terms over most of the concentration range (Fig.5 A). The concentration dependence of the rate constants is complex (Fig. 5 B.). The larger rate constant increased with concentration to a maximum of 220 s−1. The dependence was approximately fitted by a hyperbola using all data from three experiments. However, the initial slope showed some deviation from a linear plot, and the intercept at zero concentration could be in error. The value ofk a from the slope is 3.5 × 106m−1 s−1. The process with the smaller rate constant contributed more than half the amplitude at the lowest substrate concentration, but the relative amplitude decreased with concentration. For concentrations greater than 60 μm, a single exponential term gave a satisfactory fit to the data. At the lowest concentration, the rate constant is 3 s−1, and it showed an S-shaped increase to a value of 40 s−1. A Mt·Ncd complex that had not been treated with apyrase gave a similar maximum rate for the main signal, which indicates that the system was not altered by apyrase treatment. The fluorescence signal included an extra term at a rate of about 2–3 s−1throughout the concentration range. Because only part of the ADP is dissociated in forming the Mt·Ncd complex, this step corresponds to the rate of dissociation of the bound ADP, which limits the rate of binding of MANT ADP. The rate of MANT ADP dissociation was reported previously to be 3 s−1 based on the maximum rate of the reaction of Ncd-MANT ADP with microtubules plus ATP (7Shimizu T. Sablin E. Vale R.D. Fletterick R. Pechatnikova E. Taylor E.W. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13259-13266Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The rate of MANT ADP release was re-measured for the preparations used in the present experiments. The maximum rate was 4.2 s−1 for the main signal, but there was a contribution from a step with a rate constant of 1.5 s−1 that did not depend on microtubule concentration (data not shown). The latter step, which cannot be on the main ATPase pathway, is evidence for two Ncd·ADP states. Two rate constants for MANT ADP release have been reported for an Ncd dimer (8Crevel I.M.-T.C. Lockhart A. Cross R.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 257: 66-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The purpose of this study is to determine the rate constants for the steps in the microtubule-Ncd ATPase mechanism and to compare the scheme with kinesin. The binding of substrate, the hydrolysis step, and the dissociation of ADP are interpreted by a simplified kinetic scheme, MtN+T⇌k1>300s−1MtN·T⇌k2=15s−1 MtN·D·Pi⇌k3≥10s−1(−P)MtN·D⇌k−4=220s−1k4=4s−1MtN+DEquation 2 where T, D, and Pi refer to nucleotide triphosphate, nucleotide diphosphate, and inorganic phosphate, respectively. MtN refers to the complex of the Ncd monomer unit with a microtubule binding site. The initial step in binding of ATP or ADP probably consists of the formation of a weakly bound collision complex, but this step is omitted for simplicity; k 1 andk −4 refer to the maximum rate of the isomerization step induced by binding of the nucleotide. In the case of ADP, the binding reached a maximum rate of approximately 220 s−1, and the apparent dissociation constant of the initial complex is 30 μm. For ATP, the initial binding is weaker, and a maximum rate was not obtained, k 1 > 300 s−1."

By constructing ε-δ subunit chimeras, coexpressing them with complementary subunits, and measuring DMT binding, we identify two pairs of residues, Ileε58/Hisδ60 and Aspε59/Alaδ61, responsible for DMT site selectivity in the adult receptor. The two determinants contribute approximately equally to the binding site and interact in contributing to the site. Exchange of these residues from one subunit to the other exchanges the affinities of the resulting binding sites. These determinants in the adult receptor are far from those that confer site selectivity in the fetal receptor; determinants in the fetal receptor are Ileγ116/Valδ118, Tyrγ117/Thrδ119, and Serγ161/Lysδ163. Thus, alternative residues confer DMT selectivity in fetal and adult acetylcholine receptors.

Acetylcholine receptors (AChRs) 1The abbreviations used are: AChRs, acetylcholine receptors; DMT, dimethyl d-tubocurarine; bp, base pair. from vertebrate skeletal muscle are pentamers of homologous subunits with the compositions α2βγδ in fetal muscle and α2βεδ in adult muscle (2Mishina M. Takai T. Imoto K. Noda M. Takahashi T. Numa S. Methfessel C. Sakmann B. Nature. 1986; 321: 406-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (753) Google Scholar). The ligand-binding sites are generated by pairs of subunits, αδ and either αγ or αε. The two sites in each receptor selectively bind competitive antagonists of the curare family (3Neubig R.R.

Chem. 1981; 256: 6692-6699Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), with the αγ and αε sites binding with high affinity and the αδ site binding with low affinity. Because the α subunit is common to each binding site, differences in affinity are attributed to different contributions of the non-α subunits (5Blount P. Merlie J.P.

We previously identified three pairs of residues at equivalent positions in the γ and δ subunits that confer DMT selectivity in the fetal receptor (1Sine S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9436-9440Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). The primary source of selectivity is the pair of equivalent residues Tyrγ117/Thrδ119, of which Tyrγ117 stabilizes one of two quaternary nitrogens in DMT through a π-cation interaction (9Fu D.-X. Sine S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26152-26157Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Paradoxically, the ε subunit of the adult receptor, which also confers high affinity for DMT, contains serine at this key position (10Gardner P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 6714Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). We therefore reasoned that alternative residues confer high affinity for DMT at the αε site. To identify these alternative residues, we constructed ε-δ subunit chimeras, coexpressed them with complementary subunits, and measured binding of DMT. Our results reveal alternative residues in the ε and δ subunits that confer site selectivity for DMT in the adult receptor. Dimethyl d-tubocurarine was generously provided by Lilly. 125I-Labeled α-bungarotoxin was purchased from NEN Life Science Products, d-tubocurarine chloride from ICN Pharmaceuticals, Inc., and the 293 human embryonic kidney cell line from the American Type Culture Collection. Mouse subunit AChR cDNAs were generously provided by Drs. Norman Davidson and John Merlie and were subcloned into the cytomegalovirus-based expression vector pRBG4 as described (1Sine S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9436-9440Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Chimeric subunit cDNAs were constructed by bridging naturally occurring or mutagenically installed restriction sites with synthetic double-stranded oligonucleotides (1Sine S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9436-9440Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). The chimeras are designated as follows. The first letter gives the subunit from which N-terminal sequence is taken, the following number gives the position of the chimeric junction, and the final letter gives the subunit from which C-terminal sequence is taken. The chimera ε63δ was constructed by bridging a 35-base pair (bp) synthetic double-stranded oligonucleotide from a PflMI restriction site in the ε subunit to a mutagenically installed SalI site in the δ subunit. The chimera ε43δ63ε was constructed by bridging theBstEII site in the ε subunit and the SalI site in ε63δ with an 85-bp synthetic oligonucleotide. The chimera ε43δ56ε was constructed by bridging a 60-bp oligonucleotide from the BstEII site to the PflMI site in the ε subunit and ligating a 1030-bp PflMI-PflMI fragment prepared by digestion of the ε subunit. To construct the chimera ε43δ59ε, a 3426-bp PflMI-DraIII fragment prepared by digestion of ε43δ56ε was ligated with a 1900-bp AflIII-DraIII fragment from the ε subunit and a 90-bp oligonucleotide bridging the PflMI andAflIII sites. The chimeras ε57δ63ε, ε58δ63ε, and ε59δ63ε were constructed from the same cassette using a 52-bp oligonucleotide that bridges the PflMI site and a mutagenically installed HgaI site. The point mutations εI58H, εD59A, and εI58H/εD59A were constructed by bridging a 90-bp oligonucleotide from the PflMI site to theAflIII site. The double mutant δH60I/δA61D was constructed by bridging a 50-bp oligonucleotide from PflMI to HgaI in the δ subunit and ligating with a 300-bpHgaI-PflMI fragment. The double mutant γM58H/γQ59A was constructed by bridging a 98-bp oligonucleotide from the PflMI site to a mutagenically installedEagI site. The triple mutant γI116V/γY117T/γS161K was constructed as described (1Sine S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9436-9440Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). This triple mutant was further modified to include mutations of determinants identified in this study to γM58I/γQ59D/γI116V/γY117T/γS161K, which was constructed by bridging a 106-bp oligonucleotide from the PflMI site to theEcoRV site. All constructs were confirmed by dideoxy sequencing. Human embryonic kidney cells were transfected with mutant or wild-type AChR subunit cDNAs using calcium phosphate precipitation as described (1Sine S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9436-9440Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Three days after transfection, intact human embryonic kidney cells were harvested by gentle agitation in phosphate-buffered saline plus 5 mm EDTA. DMT binding to intact cells was measured by competition against the initial rate of125I-α-bungarotoxin binding (11Sine S. Taylor P. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 3315-3325Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After harvesting, the cells were briefly centrifuged, resuspended in potassium Ringer high solution, and divided into aliquots for DMT binding measurements. Potassium Ringer solution contains 140 mm KCl, 5.4 mm NaCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 1.7 mm MgCl2, 25 mm HEPES, and 30 mg/liter bovine serum albumin adjusted to pH 7.4 with 10–11 mm NaOH. Specified concentrations of DMT were added 30 min prior to the addition of 125I-α-bungarotoxin, which was allowed to bind for 30 min to occupy approximately half of the surface receptors. Binding was terminated by the addition of 2 ml of potassium Ringer solution containing 300 μm d-tubocurarine chloride. Cells were then harvested by filtration through Whatman GF/B filters using a Brandel Cell Harvester and washed four times with 3 ml of potassium Ringer solution. Prior to use, filters were soaked in potassium Ringer solution containing 4% skim milk for a minimum of 2 h. Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 10 mm carbamylcholine. The total number of α-bungarotoxin sites was determined by incubation with toxin for 120 min. The initial rate of α-bungarotoxin binding was calculated as described (11Sine S. Taylor P. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 3315-3325Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to yield fractional occupancy by DMT.

The number of experiments is given in parentheses. Previous work showed that the pair of equivalent residues Tyrγ117/Thrδ119 are major determinants of DMT selectivity in the fetal AChR (1Sine S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9436-9440Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Tyrγ117 contributes to high affinity of the αγ site, whereas Thrδ119 contributes to low affinity of the αδ site. Because serine occupies the equivalent position in the ε subunit and high affinity requires an aromatic side chain, the αε site is not expected to bind DMT with high affinity. To determine the origin of high affinity conferred by the ε subunit, we constructed a series of ε-δ subunit chimeras (Fig.1, A and B), coexpressed them with complementary subunits, and measured DMT binding by competition against the initial rate of α-125I-bungarotoxin binding. Selectivity of the adult AChR for DMT is illustrated in Fig.1 C; distinct affinities of the αε and αδ sites are clearly resolved, with the two-site fit disclosing dissociation constants differing by 70-fold (Table I). Substituting ε sequence into the N-terminal 63 positions of the δ subunit increases DMT affinity to approach that conferred by the pure ε subunit (Fig. 1 C, ε63δ). Conversely, substituting δ sequence between positions 43 and 63 of the ε subunit decreases affinity to approach that of the pure δ subunit (Fig. 1 C, ε43δ63ε). Thus, determinants of DMT selectivity in the adult AChR are located in the major extracellular domain between residues 43 and 63 of the ε subunit and equivalent residues of the δ subunit. Because we anticipated multiple contributions to DMT selectivity, we sought to increase the window of selectivity to help discern small affinity changes. Recent studies in our laboratory revealed that the mutation δL121K decreases DMT affinity for the αδ site while retaining good levels of expression (19Sine S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23521-23527Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). When incorporated into the adult AChR, δL121K markedly expands the selectivity window from 70- to ∼2000-fold (Fig. 2 B). The broad plateau allows determination of the fraction of each site and clear resolution of the dissociation constants for the two sites. The apparent fraction of sites with high affinity is ∼0.6 in the AChR containing δL121K. Because the receptors lacking the δ subunit (i.e. α2βε2) used in this study do not express significantly at 37 °C, the binding profile should arise entirely from α2βεδL121K receptors, and the fraction of each site should equal 0.5. Thus, the apparent fraction of 0.6 suggests that the intrinsic rate of α-toxin binding is somewhat slower at the αδL121K site compared with the native αε or αδ sites. We further localized selectivity determinants by constructing ε-δ-ε subunit chimeras that maintained one junction at position 43, but shifted the other junction from position 63 toward the N terminus (Fig. 2 A). When coexpressed with α, β, and δL121K subunits, the chimera ε43δ59ε confers low, δ-like affinity (Fig. 2 B), as observed for ε43δ63ε (Fig.1 C). The resulting binding profile is the sum of contributions of the site formed by α and δL121K and that formed by α and ε43δ59ε. We determined the dissociation constant of the site formed by α and ε43δ59ε by fitting a two-site equation (Equation 2) to the data; the fit reveals a dissociation constant of 16 μm for the site formed by α and ε43δ59ε, indistinguishable from that of the pure αδ site (Table I). The dissociation constant of 0.39 mm for the αδL121K site agrees with that obtained for the same site in receptors containing the wild-type ε subunit (Table I). These results narrow the region containing selectivity determinants to between residues 43 and 60 of the ε subunit. Moving the chimera junction three more positions toward the N terminus, yielding ε43δ56ε (Fig. 2 A), increases DMT affinity to that conferred by the pure ε subunit (Fig. 2 B). Observation of pure ε-like affinity suggests that the region from residues 44 to 56 contains no additional selectivity determinants. These results narrow the region containing selectivity determinants to between residues 56 and 60 of the ε subunit; the corresponding ε sequence is GID, whereas the equivalent δ sequence is DHA. To determine which of the three remaining pairs of residues confer DMT selectivity, we constructed ε57δ63ε, ε58δ63ε, and ε59δ63ε (Fig. 3 A). The chimera ε57δ63ε confers the same low δ-like affinity observed with ε43δ63ε, indicating that the Gly versus Asp difference does not contribute to selectivity (Fig. 3 B). On the other hand, ε58δ63ε elicits a partial shift toward high affinity, and ε59δ63ε elicits a complete shift to pure ε-like affinity (Fig. 3 B). These results suggest that two pairs of adjacent residues confer DMT selectivity in the adult receptor, Ileε58/Hisδ60 and Aspε59/Alaδ61. To determine whether the selectivity determinants identified using chimeras are solely responsible for DMT selectivity in the adult receptor, we constructed point mutations in the ε subunit, coexpressed them with α, β, and δL121K subunits, and measured DMT binding. As observed with the chimera ε58δ63ε, the single point mutations εI58H and εD59A partially decrease the affinity of the αε site to approach that of the αδ site (Fig.4 A). Moreover, the double mutation εI58H/εD59A fully decreases the affinity to that conferred by both the chimera ε57δ63ε and the pure δ subunit (Fig.4 A). We determined the dissociation constant of the site formed by α and εI58H/εD59A by fitting a two-site equation (Equation 2) to the data; the fit revealed a dissociation constant of 20 μm for the site formed by α and εI58H/εD59A, close to that of the native αδ site (Table I). Thus, the pair of residues Ileε58 and Aspε59 fully account for DMT site selectivity in the adult receptor. Having defined selectivity determinants using δL121K to increase the window of selectivity, we sought to confirm the contributions of Ileε58 and Aspε59 in the presence of complementary wild-type subunits. Again, the ε single mutations partially decrease affinity, and the double mutation fully decreases affinity to that of the pure δ subunit (Fig. 4 B). Fitting the Hill equation to the data for the ε double mutant reveals a single class of sites with a dissociation constant of 14 μm (Table I). To further confirm that the pairs of equivalent residues Ileε58/Hisδ60 and Aspε59/Alaδ61 are solely responsible for DMT selectivity in the adult receptor, we expressed the double mutants εI58H/εD59A and δH60I/δA61D, alone or together, and measured DMT binding. Receptors containing δH60I/δA61D bind DMT with a single high affinity dissociation constant, approaching that conferred by the ε subunit (Fig. 4 C and Table I). As just described, receptors containing εI58H/εD59A bind DMT with a single low affinity dissociation constant, approaching that conferred by the δ subunit. Moreover, incorporating both the ε and δ double mutants into a single receptor mimics the selective binding of DMT to the wild-type adult receptor (Fig. 4 C). Thus, the pair of equivalent residues Ileε58/Hisδ60 and Aspε59/Alaδ61 account entirely for DMT selectivity in the adult receptor. The experiments using ε-δ subunit chimeras were motivated by the presence of serine at position 117 of the ε subunit and the observation that tyrosine at the equivalent position of the γ subunit is associated with high affinity for curariform antagonists (1Sine S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9436-9440Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 9Fu D.-X. Sine S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26152-26157Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether Serε117 is nevertheless close enough to affect DMT binding, we mutated Serε117 to threonine, valine, tyrosine, phenylalanine, tryptophan, and arginine. The phenylalanine mutation slightly enhances the affinity of DMT for the αε site, whereas the threonine and tyrosine mutations are without effect (TableII). The remaining aromatic mutation, tryptophan, slightly decreases affinity to about the same extent observed with the valine mutation. The arginine mutation shows the greatest decrease in affinity. Thus, four of the six mutations at Serε117 produce small changes in the affinity of the αε site, with little effect on the affinity of the αδ site. The side chain specificity of position 117 of the ε subunit, however, differs markedly from that observed with point mutations of Tyrγ117, where, for example, γY117W enhances affinity 30-fold compared with γY117S (9Fu D.-X. Sine S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26152-26157Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The relatively small effects of these mutations on DMT binding to the αε site suggests that Serε117 is close to the site of binding, but it does not contribute to high affinity for DMT.Table IIDMT binding parameters for receptors containing mutations at Ser ε117MutantK AK BK appn HμmμmμmWild-type0.088 ± 0.0748.60 ± 0.760.85 ± 0.090.53 ± 0.021εS117T0.099 ± 0.02214.00 ± 3.301.30 ± 0.210.49 ± 0.036εS117V0.370 ± 0.03315.00 ± 1.402.40 ± 0.240.63 ± 0.038εS117R3.700 ± 1.30021.00 ± 7.108.80 ± 1.100.87 ± 0.092εS117F0.034 ± 0.0048.10 ± 1.000.55 ± 0.090.44 ± 0.035εS117W0.320 ± 0.0196.00 ± 0.331.60 ± 0.130.72 ± 0.037εS117Y0.065 ± 0.0127.30 ± 1.400.67 ± 0.140.53 ± 0.054K A and K B are dissociation constants for each site obtained from a two-site fit, with fractA set to 0.5.

Because the determinants identified in this study differ from those that confer high affinity in the homologous γ subunit, we mutated the equivalent residues in the γ subunit, Metγ58 and Glnγ59, to their counterparts in the low affinity δ subunit. We coexpressed the resulting double mutant (γM58H/γQ59A) with α, β, and δ subunits and measured DMT binding. The site formed by α and γM58H/γQ59A maintains high affinity for DMT, with the dissociation constant of 0.23 μm close to that of the native αγ site (TableIII). Thus, the determinants identified in this study do not affect the contribution of the γ subunit to DMT binding.Table IIIDMT binding parameters for receptors containing wild-type or mutant γ subunitsMutantK AK BK appn HμmμmμmWild-type (α2βγδ)0.134 ± 0.0166.89 ± 0.81γ-M58H/γQ59A0.225 ± 0.03412.88 ± 1.95γI116V/γ117T/γS161K9.13 ± 0.590.99γM58I/γQ59D/γI116V/γY117T/γS161K6.12 ± 0.380.92Either the two-site or the Hill equation was fitted to the data as in Table II to yield intrinsic dissociation constants (K A and K B) or the apparent dissociation constant (K app) and the Hill coefficient (n H). Open table in a new tab Either the two-site or the Hill equation was fitted to the data as in Table II to yield intrinsic dissociation constants (K A and K B) or the apparent dissociation constant (K app) and the Hill coefficient (n H). We considered the possibility that γM58H/γQ59A does not decrease DMT affinity because the previously identified determinants of high affinity (Ileγ116, Tyrγ117, and Serγ161) are still present. Thus, we constructed γI116V/γY117T/γS161K to mimic the low affinity δ subunit (1Sine S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9436-9440Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) and then added the high affinity determinants from the ε subunit to form γM58I/γQ59D/γI116V/γY117T/γS161K. The triple mutation fully decreases DMT affinity to that of the pure δ subunit (TableIII), as described previously (1Sine S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9436-9440Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). However, the affinity conferred by the quintuple mutation coincides with that of the triple mutation alone, confirming that Metγ58 and Glnγ59 do not contribute to DMT selectivity in the γ subunit. Thus, distinct sets of residues confer high affinity to the γ and ε subunits. These experiments identify residues in the ε and δ subunits that give the two binding sites of the adult mouse AChR different affinities for the curariform antagonist DMT. Previous work identified a different set of residues in the γ and δ subunits that confer site selectivity in the fetal mouse AChR (1Sine S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9436-9440Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Two sets of determinants were identified, with each set flanking the disulfide loop common to all members of the AChR superfamily; the pre-disulfide set is Ileγ116/Valδ118 and Tyrγ117/Thrδ119, and the post-disulfide set is Serγ161/Lysδ163. By contrast, selectivity determinants in the adult receptor are far from these in the linear sequence and comprise Ileε58/Hisδ60 and Aspε59/Alaδ61, showing that alternative residues confer DMT selectivity in fetal and adult receptors. The results support a basic scaffold hypothesis because selectivity can be exchanged between the ε and δ subunits by exchanging a small number of residues at equivalent positions of the primary sequence. Of the three pairs of selectivity determinants identified in the fetal receptor, the pair Tyrγ117/Thrδ119 makes the greatest contribution to DMT selectivity (1Sine S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9436-9440Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Studies of side chain specificity indicate that Tyrγ117 stabilizes one of two quaternary nitrogens in DMT through a π-cation interaction (9Fu D.-X. Sine S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26152-26157Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because serine is present at position 117 of the high affinity ε subunit, we reasoned that the source of high affinity conferred by the ε subunit should be elsewhere. Our results of point mutations of Serε117 reveal relatively small changes in the affinity of the αε site, indicating that although Serε117 is not the origin of high affinity for DMT, it may nevertheless be close to the site of binding. In contrast to the π-cation stabilization observed in the fetal receptor, DMT selectivity appears to owe to electrostatic forces in the adult receptor. High affinity of the αε site results from an isoleucine-aspartic acid pair, whereas low affinity of the αδ site results from a histidine-alanine pair. Mutation of one of the two determinants, εI58H or εD59A, partially decreases affinity, whereas mutation of both determinants fully decreases affinity to that conferred by the native δ subunit. The sum of the contributions of the single mutations slightly exceeds that of the double mutation (Fig. 4 B), pointing to some sort of interaction between these determinants. High affinity of the αε site may owe to electrostatic forces between Aspε61 and one of the two quaternary nitrogens in DMT. If the local pH renders Hisδ61 positively charged, low affinity of the αδ site may owe to electrostatic repulsion of a positive charge in DMT. Preliminary measurements with the mutation εI58K reveal decreased affinity similar to that of εI58H. Alternatively, other nearby residues, perhaps with aromatic side chains, may directly stabilize DMT, and the determinants that we have identified may affect their interaction with DMT. The selectivity determinants in the adult receptor belong to one of the four loops identified to contribute to the non-α subunit portion of the ligand-binding interface (12Prince R.J. Sine S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25770-25777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 20Tsigelny I. Sugiyama N. Sine S. Taylor P. Biophys. J. 1997; 73: 52-66Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Local sequences of this loop are compared across species for the ε, δ, and γ subunits (Fig.5). The two determinants are highly conserved among ε and γ subunits, with the first determinant an invariant isoleucine among ε subunits and methionine in all γ subunits except Torpedo. The second determinant is an acidic group in ε subunits and a neutral glutamine in γ subunits. By contrast, the determinants are not as well conserved among δ subunits, with the proton acceptor histidine or polar glutamine at the first position and small but variable residues at the second. The selectivity determinants are near other residues known to contribute to the ligand-binding site. The invariant pair Trpγ55/Trpδ57 was first identified by photoaffinity labeling with 3H-labeledd-tubocurarine (13Chiara D.C. Cohen J.B. Biophys. J. 1992; 61 (abstr.): A106Google Scholar) and has been shown to contribute to ligand affinity by mutagenesis (14O'Leary M.E. Filatov G.N. White M.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: C648-C653Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Corringer P.J. Galzi J.L. Eisele J.L. Bertrand S. Changeux J.-P. Bertrand D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11749-11752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Two residues carboxyl-terminal to Trpγ55/Trpδ57 is the pair Gluγ57/Aspδ59, which contributes to agonist selectivity in a state-specific manner, preferentially affecting the desensitized state (12Prince R.J. Sine S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25770-25777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Equivalent to this pair in neuronal subunits is Thrβ259/Lysβ259, which contributes to higher affinity of dihydro-β-erythroidine and neuronal bungarotoxin for α3β2 compared with α3β4 receptors (16Harvey S.C. Leutje C.W. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 3798-3806Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, a stretch of five residues, beginning with Trpγ55/Trpδ57, contributes to the non-α subunit portion of the ligand-binding site. Previous studies showed that tyrosines in the juxtaposed α and γ subunits, Tyrα198 and Tyrγ117, stabilize DMT through symmetrical π-cation interactions (9Fu D.-X. Sine S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26152-26157Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). By studying a series of mutations in both subunits, the contributions of each residue were found to be approximately equal and additive, indicating that DMT bridges the αγ subunit interface. DMT may also bridge the αε subunit interface in the adult receptor, but with a different point of attachment in the ε subunit. The determinants we identify may also affect attachment of DMT to the α subunit portion of the binding site. The high degree of homology among AChR subunits suggests that the polypeptide chains of each subunit fold into similar basic scaffolds. Support for this basic scaffold hypothesis comes from the observation that site selectivity of agonists and antagonists can be exchanged between the γ and δ subunits by exchanging a small number of residues at equivalent positions of the primary sequence (1Sine S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9436-9440Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 12Prince R.J. Sine S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25770-25777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 17Sine S.M. Kreienkamp H.-J. Bren N. Maeda R. Taylor P. Neuron. 1995; 15: 205-211Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Nearly interchangeable alterations in affinity are observed for the two pairs of selectivity determinants in the ε and δ subunits identified in this study; this would not be expected for a rigid ligand such as DMT unless the determinants are in the same positions at both the αε and αδ subunit interfaces. Thus, the identified determinants probably occupy equivalent positions within the ε and δ scaffolds, supporting the basic scaffold hypothesis. In addition to showing that different residues confer high affinity to the ε and γ subunits, our experiments reveal an additional difference between these subunits. In particular, neither γM58I/γQ59D nor γM58H/γQ59A affects the contribution of the γ subunit to the DMT-binding site, whereas the corresponding mutations in the ε subunit elicit profound changes in DMT affinity. Thus, while the polypeptide scaffolds in the γ and ε subunits are likely to be similar, particularly since they are the most homologous pair of AChR subunits, a structure unique to the γ subunit prevents residues placed at positions 58 and 59 of the γ subunit from contributing to DMT binding. One can reasonably ask how two completely different sets of residues confer selectivity for the same ligand. Considering first the low affinity αδ site, DMT binds with a dissociation constant of 10 μm, which of course requires some stabilizing interactions. Perhaps these include stabilization of one of the two quaternary nitrogens in DMT by Tyr198 in the juxtaposed α subunit (14O'Leary M.E. Filatov G.N. White M.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: C648-C653Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Sine S.M. Quiram P. Papanikolaou F. Kreienkamp H.-J. Taylor P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8808-8816Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) plus stabilization of the hydrophobic and hydrophilic faces of DMT by as yet unidentified residues within the αδ subunit interface. Considering the high affinity αγ site, DMT is still stabilized by structures common to the αδ and αγ sites, but its second quaternary nitrogen is within reach of Tyrγ117, which provides additional stabilization and high affinity. The high affinity αε site, on the other hand, contains serine at position 117, which is within reach of the second quaternary nitrogen of DMT, but provides no further stabilization. Instead, DMT appears to position its second quaternary nitrogen close to Ileε58 and Aspε59 to bind with high affinity and a dissociation constant of ∼0.1 μm. Thus, at the various αγ, αδ, and αε binding sites, DMT chooses among possible sources of stabilization within the binding cleft and associates with the most favorable stabilizing residues."
https://openalex.org/W2090579341,"The chromatin structure of theSaccharomyces cerevisiae ADH2 gene is modified during the switch from repressing (high glucose) to derepressing (low glucose) conditions of growth. Loss of protection toward micrococcal nuclease cleavage for the nucleosomes covering the TATA box and the RNA initiation sites (−1 and +1, respectively) is the major modification taking place and is strictly dependent on the presence of the transcriptional activator ADR1. To identify separate functions involved in the transition from a repressed to a transcribing promoter, we have analyzed theADH2 chromatin organization in various genetic backgrounds. Deletion of the CCR4 gene coding for a general transcription factor impaired ADH2 expression without affecting chromatin remodeling. Growing yeast at 37 °C also resulted in chromatin remodeling at the ADH2 locus even under glucose repressing conditions. However, although this temperature-induced remodeling was dependent on the ADR1 protein, noADH2 mRNA was observed. In addition, inactivating RNA polymerase II (and therefore, elongation) was found to have no effect on the ability to reconfigure nucleosomes. Taken together, these data indicate that chromatin remodeling by itself is insufficient to induce transcription at the ADH2 promoter."
https://openalex.org/W2123834396,"Protein kinase C is specifically regulated by diacylglycerol and the amino phospholipid, phosphatidylserine. The molecular basis for the phosphatidylserine specificity was recently proposed to arise from the presence of a putative phosphatidylserine binding motif, FXFXLKXXXKXR, localized in the C2 domain of protein kinase C (Igarashi, K., Kaneda, M., Yamaji, A., Saido, T. C., Kikkawa, U., Ono, U., Inoue, K., and Umeda, M. (1995) J. Biol. Chem. 270, 29075–29078). To determine whether this motif mediates the interaction of protein kinase C with phosphatidylserine, the carboxyl-terminal basic residues were mutated to Ala in protein kinase C βII (K236A and R238A), and the phosphatidylserine regulation of the mutant enzyme was examined. Membrane binding and activity measurements revealed that the phosphatidylserine regulation for the mutant protein was indistinguishable from that of wild-type protein kinase C. Specifically, neither the apparent membrane affinity for phosphatidylserine-containing membranes in the presence or absence of diacylglycerol nor the phosphatidylserine-dependence for activation was affected by removal of the conserved basic residues at the carboxyl terminus of the consensus sequence. In addition, a synthetic peptide corresponding to the amino terminus of the consensus sequence (FTFNVK) had no effect on the concentration of phosphatidylserine resulting in half-maximal activation of protein kinase C. These results reveal that the carboxyl-terminal basic residues in the consensus motif FXFXLKXXXKXR are not responsible for the phosphatidylserine selectivity of protein kinase C and that, furthermore, the region of the C2 domain containing this motif is not involved in the membrane binding of protein kinase C.

The protein kinase C family of serine/threonine kinases transduces the multitude of extracellular signals that result in generation of the lipid second messenger, diacylglycerol (1Nishizuka Y. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 484-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (2356) Google Scholar, 2Newton A.C. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 161-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar). This lipid causes protein kinase C to translocate from the cytosol to, typically, the plasma membrane where it becomes activated by an additional interaction with phosphatidylserine. Membrane translocation is mediated by two membrane-targeting modules, the C1 and the C2 domains. Each comprises a functional module present separately in a number of otherwise unrelated proteins (3Newton A.C. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 973-976Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). The C1 domain of conventional and novel protein kinase Cs binds membranes via a high affinity interaction with diacylglycerol or its analog, phorbol esters. The C2 domain is responsible for the calcium-dependent binding to anionic lipids for a number of amphitropic proteins, including the conventional protein kinase Cs. Although protein kinase C can be recruited to membranes by either domain alone, maximal activation of the enzyme requires membrane binding of both the C1 and C2 domains. The resulting membrane interaction is of sufficiently high affinity to provide the energy to break the interaction between the autoinhibitory pseudosubstrate and the active site. An intriguing property of protein kinase C lipid regulation is the remarkable selectivity of the enzyme's for phosphatidylserine. Shortly after the enzyme's discovery, Nishizuka and co-workers (4Takai Y. Kishimoto A. Iwasa Y. Kawahara Y. Mori T. Nishizuka Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 3692-3695Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) discovered that the “membrane-associated factor” that activated protein kinase C was phosphatidylserine. Extensive enzymological studies by Bell and workers (5Lee M.-H. Bell R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 14797-14805Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in the mid-1980s revealed strict specificity for thel-serine headgroup in activating the enzyme, with alterations in the stereochemistry of the headgroup, distance between carboxyl and amine groups, or removal of any functional group resulting in phospholipids unable to significantly activate protein kinase C. Binding measurements revealed that this selective recognition of phosphatidylserine occurs only in the presence of diacylglycerol (6Orr J.W. Newton A.C. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 4667-4673Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 7Mosior M. Epand R.M. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 66-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 8Newton A.C. Keranen L.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6651-6658Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). In the absence of diacylglycerol, protein kinase C binds all anionic lipids with equal affinity; this interaction is driven primarily by electrostatic forces and depends only on the net charge of the lipid rather than its structure (8Newton A.C. Keranen L.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6651-6658Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). However, the presence of diacylglycerol causes a dramatic increase in the affinity of protein kinase C for phosphatidylserine-containing surfaces (mixed micelles or membranes) relative to surfaces containing other anionic lipids. For example, diacylglycerol was shown to cause a 250-fold increase in the affinity of protein kinase C for mixed micelles containing phosphatidyl-l-serine compared with only a 10-fold increase in affinity for micelles containing phosphatidyl-d-serine (8Newton A.C. Keranen L.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6651-6658Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). This remarkable selectivity for phosphatidylserine appears to be unique to protein kinase C and is not a common feature of other C2 domain-containing proteins (9Nalefski E.A. Falke J.J. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 2375-2390Crossref PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar). A mechanism mediating phosphatidylserine specificity was proposed recently based on identification of a putative phosphatidylserine-binding motif. The motif was localized to a consensus sequence (F X F X LK XXX K X R) found in the C2 domain of protein kinase C (residues 227–238 of protein kinase C β); it was identified based on the ability of anti-idiotypic antibodies raised against the combining site of a phosphatidylserine-specific antibody to bind protein kinase C or peptides based on the C2 domain (10Igarashi K. Kaneda M. Yamaji A. Saido T. Kikkawa U. Ono Y. Inoue K. Umeda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29075-29078Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The amino-terminal hydrophobic residues of the consensus sequence (see Fig. 1 A) are conserved in most known C2 domains, including those in proteins that bind membranes with no selectivity for phosphatidylserine (9Nalefski E.A. Falke J.J. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 2375-2390Crossref PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar). Thus, these residues are unlikely to dictate phosphatidylserine specificity and may be more important in maintaining the characteristic β-strand structure of the C2 domain. In contrast, the three basic residues in the carboxyl-half of the consensus sequence are commonly found in proteins that specifically interact with phosphatidylserine, such as the protein kinase Cs and phosphatidylserine decarboxylase (11Kuge O. Nishijima M. Akamatsu Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6370-6376Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Trotter P.J. Pedretti J. Yates R. Voelker D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6071-6080Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), and are therefore more likely to comprise a phosphatidylserine-specific binding site. This contribution investigates the role of the putative phosphatidylserine-binding motif in the lipid regulation of protein kinase C βII. Mutation of the conserved carboxyl-terminal basic residues, in addition to competition studies with a peptide based on the amino-terminal sequence of the motif, reveals that this motif does not regulate the specific interaction of protein kinase C with phosphatidylserine or its nonspecific interaction with anionic lipids. Thus, theF X F X LK XXX K X Rconsensus motif does not provide determinants that bind phosphatidylserine, nor is it involved in the lipid regulation of protein kinase C. 1-Palmitoyl-2-oleoylphosphatidylserine, 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoylphosphatidylcholine, 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoylphosphatidylglycerol and sn-1,2-dioleoylglycerol were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids.

Andrew Flint and Daniel Koshland (University of California, Berkeley). Mutation of Lys 236 and Arg 238 to Ala in protein kinase C βII was achieved using the polymerase chain reaction with wild-type protein kinase C βII in pBlueScript as a template. The sense primer encoding the desired changes was CCCAGATCTCTACGGACAGTCTTGCGTCTGCGTCTGATTCCTTC and contained a BglII site, and the antisense primer was TCTGGTACCTATGGACCCC and contained a KpnI site. The resulting 179-base pair PCR-amplified fragment was digested with KpnI and BglII. This was ligated with two fragments of the protein kinase C βII-pBlueScript vector: a 1102-base pair fragment generated by complete digestion with NsiI andBglII, and a 3931-base pair fragment generated by complete digestion with NsiI and partial digestion withKpnI. The presence of the mutations was confirmed by sequencing and by digestion at a new HgaI site introduced by the mutation.

Recombinant baculovirus encoding wild-type or K236A/R238A protein kinase C βII was incubated with Sf-21 cells for 4 h and then diluted with media and incubated at 27 °C. Cells were harvested 60–72 h after infection and lysed in 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 0.2% (w/v) Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm DTT, 85 μm leupeptin, 2 mmbenzamidine, 0.4 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride at 4 °C. The lysate was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C to separate the detergent-soluble fraction (supernatant) from the detergent-insoluble fraction (pellet). The detergent-insoluble pellet was resuspended in lysis buffer by sonication and analyzed by gel electrophoresis. The detergent-soluble supernatant was used as the source of protein kinase C for activity and binding measurements. Qualitatively similar activation kinetics and membrane affinities were observed for wild-type protein kinase C βII in the detergent-soluble fraction and for homogeneously pure protein kinase C βII (data not shown). Detergent-soluble and resuspended particulate fractions were stored at −20 °C in 50% glycerol. The distribution of protein kinase C in the detergent-soluble and detergent-insoluble fractions was analyzed by Western blot analysis. Samples of the extracts were separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gels (7% acrylamide) and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Blots were probed with antibodies reactive against the catalytic domain of protein kinase C βII, and labeling was detected by chemiluminescence after incubation with peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies. Antibody staining was quantified by densitometric analysis of blots (Molecular Dynamics scanner, ImageQuant software) and compared with standard amounts of purified protein kinase C βII that had been electrophoresed on the same gel. Sucrose-loaded large unilamellar vesicles containing trace [3H]DPPC were prepared by drying mixtures of lipids in chloroform under a stream of nitrogen, followed by evacuation under vacuum, suspension of lipids in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 170 mm sucrose, and then 5 freeze-thaw cycles followed by extrusion using a Liposofast microextruder (Avestin, Inc.) as described (15Mosior M. Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25526-25533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Triton X-100 mixed micelles were prepared by resuspending dried lipids in buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, as described (16Orr J.W. Newton A.C. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 4661-4667Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Phospholipid concentration in chloroform stocks was determined by measuring free phosphate (17Bartlett G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1959; 234: 466-468Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and purity of lipids was checked by thin layer chromatography. Protein kinase C activity toward a synthetic peptide (Ac-FKKSFKL-NH2) was analyzed as described previously (13Orr J.W. Keranen L.M. Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15263-15266Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The standard reaction contained 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 2 mm DTT, 5 mmMgCl2, 100 μm ATP, 50 μmpeptide substrate, and either 0.5 mm EGTA (non-activating conditions) or 0.5 mm CaCl2 and sonicated dispersions of phosphatidylserine (140 μm) and diacylglycerol (4 μm). For some experiments, assays contained Triton X-100, lipid mixed micelles (0.1% Triton X-100) of the compositions noted in the legends to Figs. 4 and 6. For peptide competition studies, a peptide stock (20 mm in ME2SO) was diluted to 1 mm in 20 mmHEPES, pH 7.5, and added to the assay mixture to yield a final concentration of 280 μm peptide and 1.5% (v/v) ME2SO. 1 unit of activity is defined as 1 nmol of phosphate transferred per minute at 30 °C.Figure 6A peptide based on the putative phosphatidylserine-binding motif does not affect the phosphatidylserine regulation of protein kinase C βII. The activity of pure protein kinase C βII was measured in the presence of 0.5 mmCa2+ and Triton X-100 (0.1%) mixed micelles containing 0–12 mol % phosphatidylserine and 5 mol % diacylglycerol, either in the absence (○) or presence (•) of 280 μm hexapeptide FTFNVK. 10 mol % phosphatidylserine corresponds to 180 μm.

Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 12742-12747Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Briefly, protein kinase C in the detergent-soluble fraction of cells (0.8 nmprotein kinase C, containing less than 0.001% Triton X-100 in the binding mixture) was incubated with sucrose-loaded vesicles (100 μm lipid) in the presence of 0.3 mmCaCl2, 0.3 mg ml−1 BSA, 100 mmKCl, 1 mm DTT, 5 mm MgCl2, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5. Membrane-bound protein kinase C was separated from free enzyme by centrifugation at 100,000 ×g for 30 min at 25 °C. The fraction of sedimented vesicles was determined from radioactivity; the fraction of protein kinase C that sedimented with the vesicles was determined by assaying the activity of protein kinase C in the supernatant and pellet under identical conditions using the cofactor-independent substrate, protamine sulfate (0.2 mg ml−1). The apparent membrane affinity was calculated as the ratio of free/bound protein kinase C divided by the total lipid concentration, as described (15Mosior M. Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25526-25533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Free calcium was calculated using a program from Claude Klee which takes into account concentrations of Mg2+, ATP, Na+, EGTA, EDTA, and pH (19Jean T. Klee C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 16414-16420Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Data describing the phosphatidylserine-dependence of activation were fit to a modified Hill equation as described (16Orr J.W. Newton A.C. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 4661-4667Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) using the program Sigma Plot. To test the role of the putative phosphatidylserine-binding motif,F X F X LK XXX K X R, in the regulation of protein kinase C, we investigated the effect of mutating the two carboxyl-terminal basic residues on the lipid regulation of protein kinase C. Specifically, Lys-236 and Arg-238 in protein kinase C βII were mutated to Ala to form the K236A/R238A mutant. Basic residues at one or both corresponding positions are generally found in the C2 domain of proteins that selectively recognize phosphatidylserine, such as the conventional protein kinase Cs and the yeast phosphatidylserine decarboxylase 2 but not in C2 domains of proteins that do not display phosphatidylserine specificity (Fig.1 A). This motif is also present in phosphatidylserine-regulated proteins that do not appear to have a C2 domain, such as the yeast phosphatidylserine decarboxylase 1, a mammalian phosphatidylserine decarboxylase, and a recently identified phosphatidylserine-specific phospholipase A1 (Fig.1 A). In C2 domains, the sequence is localized to a loop at the opposite end of the Ca2+ site, with the hydrophobic residues pointing into the β sandwich and the charged residues surface-exposed (Fig. 1 B). The K236A/R238A mutant and wild-type protein kinase C were expressed in insect cells by baculovirus infection, and expression levels, subcellular fractionation, and electrophoretic mobilities of the proteins were compared. The Western blot in Fig.2 shows that both proteins were expressed to comparable levels in Sf-21 cells. Lysate of cells expressing both wild-type protein kinase C βII and the K236A/R238A mutant contained a major band migrating with an apparent molecular mass of 80 kDa (arrow) and a minor band migrating with an apparent molecular mass of 76 kDa. We have previously shown that the different electrophoretic mobilities arise from different phosphorylation states: the slowest migrating form represents mature protein that is phosphorylated at three positions and the faster migrating form represents partially or nonphosphorylated species (20Keranen L.M. Dutil E.M. Newton A.C. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 1394-1403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). As reported previously (20Keranen L.M. Dutil E.M. Newton A.C. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 1394-1403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar), the upper band of wild-type protein kinase C (arrow) partitioned exclusively in the detergent-soluble fraction (lane 2), whereas the faster migrating band, containing partially phosphorylated species, partitioned exclusively in the detergent-insoluble fraction (lane 3). Similar partitioning was observed for the K236A/R238A mutant: the upper band was localized to the detergent-soluble fraction (lane 5) and the slower migrating bands to the detergent-insoluble fraction (lane 6). Thus, mutation of the C2 domain did not affect the expression of protein kinase C, its processing by phosphorylation, or its subcellular fractionation. The protein kinase C in the detergent-soluble fraction was used in subsequent experiments. Note that a faint (<10% of total protein kinase C) slower migrating band was detected in the detergent-soluble fraction of the K236A/R238A mutant suggesting additional phosphorylation on a minor fraction of the expressed enzyme; this minor additional band has been observed with other C2 domain mutants expressed in insect cells (21Edwards A.S. Newton A.C. Biochemistry. 1998; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 3 shows that the specific activity of the K236A/R238A mutant (open bars), assayed in the presence of saturating lipid and Ca2+, was indistinguishable from that of wild-type enzyme (solid bars; 220 ± 20 units nmol−1 and 200 ± 20 units nmol−1, respectively). Basal activity in the absence of cofactors was also similar for both the mutant and wild-type protein kinase C (14 ± 3 and 18 ± 3 units nmol−1, respectively). Thus, mutation of Lys-236 and Arg-238 did not affect the catalytic activity of protein kinase C. As a first step to determine whether Lys-236 and Arg-238 modulate the lipid interaction of protein kinase C, we examined the phosphatidylserine dependence for activation of the mutant and wild-type enzyme. Fig.4 shows that the phosphatidylserine-dependence for activation of the K236A/R238A mutant, measured in the presence of Triton X-100, lipid mixed micelles containing 5 mol % diacylglycerol, was the same as that of wild-type enzyme. Specifically, the mutant (open circles) and wild-type (solid circles) enzymes were half-maximally activated by 9.0 ± 0.6 and 9.5 ± 0.6 mol % phosphatidylserine, respectively. Lowering the Ca2+concentration from 0.5 mm (Fig. 4) to 1 μmincreased the concentration of phosphatidylserine required for half-maximal activation, as reported previously (6Orr J.W. Newton A.C. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 4667-4673Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), but did not cause any differences in the phosphatidylserine regulation of the mutant compared with wild-type enzyme (data not shown). No activity was observed for either protein in the absence of diacylglycerol (Fig. 4,squares) nor if phosphatidylserine was replaced with another anionic lipid, phosphatidylglycerol (data not shown), as previously reported for wild-type protein kinase C (8Newton A.C. Keranen L.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6651-6658Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The indistinguishable kinetics of phosphatidylserine-dependent activation of the mutant and wild-type protein kinase Cs reveal that residues Lys-236 and Arg-238 are not involved in the activation of protein kinase C by phosphatidylserine. Although the above results establish that there is no effect of the K236A/R238A mutation on protein kinase C's activation by phosphatidylserine, we explored whether the mutation altered the affinity of protein kinase C for membranes. In particular, we tested whether the mutation altered protein kinase C's low-affinity interaction with acidic lipids that occurs in the absence of diacylglycerol and whether the mutation altered protein kinase C's high-affinity interaction with phosphatidylserine-containing membranes that occurs in the presence of diacylglycerol. Fig. 5 shows that both mutant (open bars) and wild-type (solid bars) protein kinase C bound to large unilamellar vesicles containing 40 mol % phosphatidylserine or 40 mol % phosphatidylglycerol with comparable affinity in the absence of diacylglycerol (approximately 1.5 × 103m−1). This is consistent with our previous finding that protein kinase C binds a variety of anionic lipids with equal affinity in the absence of diacylglycerol (8Newton A.C. Keranen L.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6651-6658Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). As reported previously, diacylglycerol caused an approximately 100-fold increase in the affinity of wild-type protein kinase C for the phosphatidylserine-containing membranes but only a 6-fold increase in the affinity of the wild-type enzyme for phosphatidylglycerol-containing membranes. More importantly, diacylglycerol had the same effect on the interaction of the K236A/R238A mutant with membranes: it selectively increased the enzyme's interaction for the phosphatidylserine-containing membranes. Specifically, diacylglycerol caused the apparent membrane affinity of the mutant to increase 86-fold, from 1.4 × 103m−1 to 1.2 × 105m−1, for phosphatidylserine-containing membranes and only 5-fold, from 1.6 × 103m−1 to 8.7 × 103m−1, for phosphatidylglycerol-containing membranes. These data reveal that the basic residues in the putative phosphatidylserine motif have no effect on 1) the nonspecific interaction of protein kinase C with anionic lipids that occurs in the absence of diacylglycerol, or 2) the specific interaction of protein kinase C with phosphatidylserine that occurs in the presence of diacylglycerol. We have previously shown that membrane binding of wild-type protein kinase C results in a 100-fold increase in the proteolytic sensitivity of the hinge separating the regulatory and catalytic moieties of the enzyme (16Orr J.W. Newton A.C. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 4661-4667Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Examination of the proteolytic sensitivity of the mutant revealed that 1) membrane binding induced the same increase in proteolytic sensitivity of the hinge as occurs for wild-type enzyme, and 2) the stability of the mutant was similar to that of wild-type enzyme (data not shown). Thus, the mutation of the putative phosphatidylserine binding motif did not affect protein kinase C's conformation or stability as detected using proteases. To investigate the possibility that the amino-terminal half of the putative phosphatidylserine binding motif (F X F X LK) alone may function as a phosphatidylserine binding site, we tested whether a synthetic peptide based on this sequence (FTFNVK) could compete with protein kinase C for phosphatidylserine. Fig. 6shows that this peptide had no significant effect on the phosphatidylserine-dependence for activation of pure protein kinase C βII: the enzyme was half-maximally activated by approximately 8 mol % phosphatidylserine (140 μm) either in the presence (solid circles) or absence (open circles) of 280 μm peptide. Thus, a hexapeptide based on the amino-terminal half of the putative phosphatidylserine-binding motif was unable to sequester phosphatidylserine and alter the protein kinase C requirement for phosphatidylserine for activation. It is noteworthy that this sequence is unlikely to be involved in phosphatidylserine selectivity since it is present in C2 domains that do not show preference for phosphatidylserine (9Nalefski E.A. Falke J.J. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 2375-2390Crossref PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar). The foregoing data reveal that basic determinants in the motifF X F X LK XXX K X R, proposed to confer phosphatidylserine specificity based on its recognition by anti-idiotypic phosphatidylserine antibodies (10Igarashi K. Kaneda M. Yamaji A. Saido T. Kikkawa U. Ono Y. Inoue K. Umeda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29075-29078Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), are not involved in protein kinase C's lipid regulation. Mutation of the two carboxyl-terminal basic residues results in a protein with indistinguishable lipid regulation from that of wild-type protein kinase C. Most strikingly, the diacylglycerol-induced high affinity interaction of the mutant with phosphatidylserine-containing membranes is the same as that of wild-type enzyme, revealing that the carboxyl-terminal half of the motif is not involved in the specific interaction with phosphatidylserine that is the hallmark of protein kinase C's membrane interaction. In addition, the low affinity interaction of the enzyme with anionic lipids that occurs in the absence of diacylglycerol is the same as that of wild-type enzyme. Thus, at least for protein kinase C, the motifF X F X LK XXX K X Ris not involved in phospholipid regulation. It is nonetheless curious that this motif is found in a number of proteins that interact with phosphatidylserine; whether it mediates a separate function unrelated to lipid binding, perhaps providing determinants that maintain the fold of specific domains, or determinants involved in protein-protein interactions, remains to be explored."

Bensch W. Forssmann W.G. Mutt V. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 216: 429-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Although DIP was detected via DSIP-specific antibodies that may recognize the sequence GGDA in DSIP and GGSA in pDIP, it is otherwise not sequence-related to this supposed sleep-inducing peptide. The pDIP sequence contains a putative leucine-zipper motif, a Pro/Glu rich domain, and three potential phosphorylation sites (2Sillard R. Schulz-Knappe P. Vogel P. Raida M. Bensch W. Forssmann W.G. Mutt V. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 216: 429-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). DNA-binding capability of pDIP, however, is not obvious from its sequence, because it lacks the basic region found in the original basic region/leucine zipper (bZIP) DNA-binding domains. In the bZIP family of transcription factors, the leucine zipper acts as a dimerization domain and the upstream basic region as a DNA-binding domain (3Vinson C.R. Sigler P.B. McKnight S.L. Science. 1989; 246: 911-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (732) Google Scholar, 4Busch S.J. Sassone-Corsi P. Trends Genet. 1990; 6: 36-40Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). Recently, the human analog of pDIP was characterized by cDNA analysis, showing that human DIP (hDIP) differs from the porcine protein in only four residues. Notably, Arg55 of pDIP is changed to a cysteine in hDIP. hDIP was shown to be present in a large number of tissues by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction/Southern hybridization (5Vogel P. Mägert H.W. Cieslak A. Adermann K. Forssmann W.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1309: 200-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). pDIP shares significant homology with the murine TSC-22 protein and the product of the Drosophila melanogaster shortsighted (shs)gene, and the regions upstream of the leucine zipper are almost identical. TSC-22 was reported to be present in both the cytoplasmic and the nuclear fraction, and it has been discussed to function as a transcriptional regulator that is activated by transcription growth factor-β1 and other growth factors of osteoblastic cells (6Shibanuma M. Kuroki T. Nose K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10219-10224Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). TheDrosophila shs gene product acts in the decapentaplegic pathway leading to photoreceptor differentiation (7Treisman J.E. Lai Z.C. Rubin G.M. Development. 1995; 121: 2835-2845PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to TSC-22, shs gene product is a cytoplasmic protein present anterior to the furrow. The evolutionary conservation suggests the region upstream of the leucine zipper to be a distinct functional or structural domain. The well known leucine zipper motif consists of two α-helices with the same sequential directionality forming a coiled coil. The coiled coil represents one of the most efficient packing modes of helices (8Crick F.H.C. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. D. 1953; 6: 689-697Crossref Google Scholar) and serves as a model for studies of protein stability and subunit interactions (9Talbot J.A. Hodges R.S. Acc. Chem.

Here, however, we present experimental and computational data on an acetylated full-length leucine zipper protein not containing a DNA binding basic domain to more completely understand structural features of leucine zipper domains in the context of full-length proteins. Peptides were assembled using Fmoc chemistry on an automated peptide synthesizer (model 9050, PerSeptive Biosystems, Wiesbaden, Germany). Fmoc amino acids were purchased from Orpegen (Heidelberg, Germany) and PerSeptive Biosystems. Fmoc-Arg(Pbf) was from Sygena (Liestal, Switzerland).N,N-Dimethylformamide (peptide synthesis grade) and polyethylene glycol-polystyrine resins were purchased from PerSeptive Biosystems. TBTU was from Peboc (Llangefni, Wales). Acetonitrile (HPLC grade), acetic anhydride, dichloromethane,tert-butylmethyl ether, pyridine, piperidine, 1,2-ethanedithiol, and trifluoroacetic acid were purchased from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany). 1-Hydroxybenzotriazole and diisopropylethylamine were obtained from Fluka (Neu-Ulm, Germany). Solid phase synthesis of pDIP was carried out on a preloaded Fmoc-Val-polyethylene glycol-polystyrine resin (loading 0.19 mmol/g, 0.78 g), while fragment pDIP(9–46) was synthesized using a Fmoc-peptide amide liuber-polyethylene glycol-polystyrene amide resin (loading 0.16 mmol/g, 0.8 g). Acylations were performed in 30 min with a 4-fold excess of Fmoc-l-amino acid in the presence of TBTU/diisopropylethylamine/1-hydroxybenzotriazole (4 eq). Fmoc groups were cleaved by treatment with 20% piperidine inN,N-dimethylformamide for 10 min. After deprotection of the terminal amino groups, the peptidyl resins were acetylated with a mixture of dichloromethane/N,N-dimethylformamide/acetic anhydride/pyridine (40:40:19:1, volume) in 20 min at 0 °C. Subsequently, the resins were washed withN,N-dimethylformamide, 2-propanol, and dichloromethane (3×) and then dried to a constant weight. Resin cleavage and deprotection were carried out with a freshly prepared mixture of trifluoroacetic acid/ethanedithiol/water (94:3:3, volume, 10 ml/g resin) for 2 h. After filtration, the resin was washed with trifluoroacetic acid, and the crude peptide was precipitated by addition of chilled tert-butylmethyl ether, washed with tert-butylmethyl ether, and lyophilized from 5% acetic acid (crude yields: pDIP, 516 mg, 39.7%; pDIP(9–46), 225 mg, 38.7%). For purification, the dried crude products were dissolved in water (50 ml), loaded onto a Vydac C18 column (20 × 250 mm, 10 μm, 300 Å, The Separations Group, Hesperia, CA) and separated (buffer A: 0.06% trifluoroacetic acid in water; buffer B: 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid in acetonitrile/water, 4:1, linear gradient 20–100% buffer B in 80 min, flow rate 9 ml/min, detection at 230 nm). Pure fractions, detected by analytical HPLC (Vydac C18, 5 μm, 300 Å, 4.6 × 250 mm, flow, 0.8 ml/min, detection at 215 nm) were pooled and lyophilized. pDIP: yield, 66 mg (5.1%, calculated from initial resin loading).

Peptides were loaded at 4 μm–2.5 mm on a Superdex 75 column equilibrated in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7, 0.1 m NaSO4, using a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. The column was calibrated with bovine serum albumin (67 kDa), ovalbumine (43 kDa), chymotrypsinogen A (25 kDa) ribonuclease A (13.7 kDa), ubiquitin (8.5 kDa), and blue dextran 2000 (2 MDa). Sedimentation experiments were performed at room temperature in a Beckman model E analytical ultracentrifuge equipped with a high-intensity light source, 10“ recorder, and AnH-Ti rotor. Measurements under the conditions of the NMR experiments made use of cells with ultra-thin pathlength and schlierenoptics: sedimentation velocity at 68,000 rpm, high-speed sedimentation equilibrium at 30,000 and 24,000 rpm; UV scanning at 240 nm. Initial peptide concentrations were 0.2 and 1.1 mm in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7, and 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, 100 mmNa2SO4, pH 7, respectively. The partial specific volume was calculated from the amino acid composition. The sedimentation coefficient was calculated from the slope in an ln(r) versus time plot, the molecular mass distribution was fitted assuming a monomer-dimer equilibrium using the „multeq 3b” program kindly provided by Dr. A. Minton. For the determination of the diffusion coefficient, areas and maximal gradients were obtained from 20-fold magnifications of schlieren photographies. CD spectra were measured on a Jasco J600 CD spectropolarimeter. A water bath was used to control the cell temperature. Data were collected with a 0.2 nm step resolution, a time constant of 1 s, and a scan speed of 20 nm/min. Wavelength scans were performed at discrete temperatures from 25 to 90 °C in a thermostatically controlled quartz cell of 0.5 or 0.05 cm pathlength, depending on peptide concentration. For each temperature point, spectra were obtained from 250 to 190 nm. Wavelength scans were processed by subtracting buffer scans taken at the same temperature and converting the data set to mean residual ellipticity prior to analysis. 10 mm phosphate buffer was used throughout. Thermal transition curves were recorded from 5 to 90 or 95 °C at a fixed wavelength of 222 nm. The samples were heated at intervals of 2.5–5 °C. At each temperature the samples were allowed to equilibrate for 15–20 min. The reversibility of the denaturations was verified by slowly cooling the sample from final to initial temperature. Typically, more than 95% of the CD signal was recovered after cooling. The transition curves were normalized to the fraction of the unfolded peptide using the standard equation: f u = (θ222 − θ n )/(θ u − θ n ), where θ n and θ u represent the ellipticity values for the fully folded and fully unfolded species, respectively, and θ222 is the observed ellipticity at 222 nm. The transition temperature, T m , of each heat-induced reversible denaturation was determined by fitting the CD signal change at 222 nm (θ222) as a function of temperature to a two-state denaturation process using a least-squares fit program based on equations described elsewhere (29Bowie J.U. Sauer R.T. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 7139-7143Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). The conformational stability ΔG 0 was determined as ΔG 0 = ΔG +RT ln P, where P is the total protein concentration. Secondary structure predictions were carried out using the Gibrat et al. (30Gibrat J.-F. Garnier J. Robson B. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 198: 425-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar), Levin et al. (31Levin J.M. Robson B. Garnier J. FEBS Lett. 1986; 205: 303-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar), double prediction method (32Deleage G. Roux B.

NMR measurements were carried out on a standard Bruker AMX 600 spectrometer with 3.5 mm pDIP in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 3.5, 298 K. Data from the following NMR spectra were employed for the sequence specific assignment of spin systems and the evaluation of nuclear Overhauser enhancement spectroscopy (NOESY) distance constraints: double quantum filtered correlated spectroscopy, total correlation spectroscopy with 40, 80, and 120 ms of mixing time, respectively, and a spin lock field of approximately 12 kHz and NOESY with mixing times of 100 and 200 ms, respectively. Solvent suppression was performed by continuous coherent irradiation prior to the first excitation pulse and during the mixing time in the NOESY experiment. The sweep width in ω1 and ω2 was 7246 Hz for all spectra. Quadrature detection was used in both dimensions with the time proportional phase incrementation technique in ω1 (37Marion D. Wüthrich K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1983; 113: 967-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (3520) Google Scholar). 4 K data points were collected in ω2 and 512 data points in ω1. Zero filling of the time domain data resulted in a frequency-domain matrix with 1 and 2 K data points in ω1 and ω2, respectively. All two-dimensional spectra were multiplied by a squared sineball function phase shifted by π/4 for NOESY and for total correlation spectroscopy spectra and by π/8 for COSY spectra. Base-line correction to the seventh order was used. Data were evaluated on X-window workstations with the NDee program package (Software Symbiose, Inc., Bayreuth, Germany). Chemical shift values are reported relative to external 2,2-dimethyl-2-silapentane sulfonate. Distance information was obtained from two-dimensional NOESY spectra in H2O/2H2O (9:1) and in 99.998%2H2O. NOESY cross peaks were classified into three categories according to their volume intensity as estimated from the number of contours in NOESY spectra: strong 0.18–0.27 nm; medium, 0.18–0.4 nm; weak, 1.8–5.5 nm. Pseudoatom corrections were used to adjust distances that involved nonstereospecifically assigned protons such as methyl groups or aromatic ring protons (38Wüthrich K. NMR of Proteins and Nucleic Acids. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1986Crossref Google Scholar). Three-dimensional structures were calculated with the X-PLOR 3.1 package (39Brünger A.T. XPLOR Version 3.1. Yale University Press, New Haven, CT1993Google Scholar). The standard protocols for ab initio simulated annealing and simulated annealing refinement were applied with some modifications. The initial structure calculations started from an extended template with satisfactory local geometry. For the leucine zipper domain a modeling approach for coiled coil proteins (40DeLano W.L. Brünger A.T. Proteins. 1994; 20: 105-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) was used. The method draws upon knowledge of the oligomerization state, the helix directionality, and the properties of heptade repeat sequences. Unknown structural parameters are heavily sampled. The coiled coil twist angle, for example, is sampled with an initial range from −35° to 35° in one degree increments. The initial Cα positions were those of a regular α-helix, and the initial separation between the helices was set to 10 Å. For each initial structure, side chain and backbone atoms were grown from the Cα position by applying a protocol similar to those used for the generation of initial coordinates in NMR structure determination (41Nilges M. Clore M. Gronenborn A.M. FEBS Lett. 1988; 239: 129-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). Each structure was relaxed with the following simulated annealing protocol: (i) a 5 ps molecular dynamics slow-cooling stage from 500 to 300 K, (ii) a 20 ps constant temperature molecular dynamics (MD) simulation at 300 K, and (iii) 1000 steps of conjugate gradient minimization. During the slow-cooling stage, Cα atoms were held in place with harmonic point restraints that were slowly reduced. The helical hydrogen bond restraints were active during all stages, but no other restraints were applied during the constant temperature MD and energy minimization stages. A time step of 0.5 fs was used for temperatures above 350 K during the slow-cooling stage, otherwise a time step of 1 fs was applied. The coordinates for the residues in the leucine zipper domain thus obtained were used as a reference set in the ab initio simulated annealing and the simulated annealing refinement to restrain the main coordinate set. The restraints were incorporated as point restraints in the form of a harmonic potential. Unrestrained MD calculations were carried out using the parameters for a representative leucine zipper structure and the TIP3P water model (42Jørgensen W.L. Chandrasekhar J. Madura J.D. Impey R.W. Klein M.L. J. Chem. Phys. 1983; 79: 926-935Crossref Scopus (29453) Google Scholar) that was supplied with the standard X-PLOR force field (39Brünger A.T. XPLOR Version 3.1. Yale University Press, New Haven, CT1993Google Scholar). The overlay was achieved by placing the protein in the center of a cubic water box (6.33 nm) and deleting all solvent molecules closer than 0.26 nm to any heavy atom of the protein. Close nonbonded solute-solvent interactions were removed in two steps. First, 100 cycles of conjugate gradient energy minimization (43Powell M.J.D. Mathemat. Progr. 1977; 12: 241-254Crossref Scopus (1420) Google Scholar) were carried out, keeping the positions of all protein atoms fixed. Second, in 300 cycles of energy minimization, a harmonic potential was used to restrain the protein to its original conformation. During the first 15 ps of the MD calculations, the system was gradually heated to 300 K while coupled to an external water bath (44Berendsen H.J.C. Postma J.P.M. van Gunsteren W.F. DiNiola A. Haak J.R. J. Chem. Phys. 1984; 81: 3684-3690Crossref Scopus (23131) Google Scholar). The MD calculations were carried out using the Verlet algorithm (45Verlet L. Physiol. Rev. 1967; 159: 98-103Crossref Scopus (6977) Google Scholar) with a time step of 1 fs. The SHAKE algorithm (46van Gunsteren W.F. Berendsen H.J.C. J. Mol. Phys. 1977; 34: 1311-1327Crossref Scopus (1575) Google Scholar) was used to constrain covalent bond lengths. A dielectric constant of 1.0 was applied with a scaling factor of 0.4 for 1–4 electrostatic interactions. All nonbonded interactions were cut off at a distance of 0.85 nm. During the whole simulation of 200 ps, minimum image periodic boundary conditions were used. Coordinates, energies, and velocities were saved every 0.5 ps for further analysis. Simulations and analyses were performed on Hewlett Packard HP 735 computers. A 1-ps simulation required about 3 h of CPU time. A second unrestrained MD calculation was carried out with the leucine zipper of GCN4 using the crystal structure (47O'Shea E.K. Klemm J."

To identify whether the transmembrane domain of gp130 is required for signaling function, cytoplasmic forms of gp130 were constructed that consisted of the tetramerizing N-terminal domain of Bcr linked to the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of gp130 (Bcr/gp130) or just to the cytoplasmic domain of gp130 (Bcr/gp130ΔTM). The expression and function of both constructs were determined in transiently transfected COS-1 and HepG2 cells. Bcr/gp130 is capable of interacting with JAK1, JAK2, and TYK2; is constitutively active; and induces gene expression through IL-6-responsive elements. In contrast, Bcr/gp130ΔTM, while expressed at a higher level than Bcr/gp130 and still able to interact with JAK1, is ineffective in recruiting the endogenous signal transduction pathways for inducing gene expression. However, Bcr/gp130ΔTM initiates partial signaling in the presence of overexpressed JAK1 and TYK2, but not JAK2.

The gp130-specific signaling process is reproducible with chimeric constructs in which the intracellular and transmembrane domains of gp130 have been recombined with subunits of other hematopoietin receptors. This suggests that signaling is primarily controlled by the juxtamembrane and distal cytoplasmic domain structures (9Lai C.-F. Ripperger J. Morella K.K. Wang Y. Gearing D.P. Horseman N.D. Campos S.P.

The transmembrane domain generally is assumed to serve as a membrane anchor for the receptor subunits, but otherwise may not contribute to receptor signaling. To assess whether the transmembrane domain per seis not required for signal transduction, we generated cytoplasmically localized, signal-transducing gp130 molecules. Here we report the application of fusion proteins between the tetramerizing N-terminal peptide of Bcr (15Tauchi T. Miyazawa K. Feng G.-S. Broxmeyer H.E. Toyama K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1389-1394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) and the cytoplasmic domain of gp130 and document the relevance of the transmembrane domain for engaging JAK isoforms and for gene induction. The chimeric gp130 constructs are depicted in Fig. 1 A. To generate Bcr/gp130, theEcoRI-NotI fragment of pDC-G-CSFR-gp130 (14Baumann H. Symes A.J. Comeau M.R. Morella K.K. Wang Y. Friend D.

Bcr/gp130ΔTM was constructed as Bcr/gp130, except that the gp130 segment from residues 594 to 874, encoding the two last residues of the transmembrane domain and the entire cytoplasmic domain, was generated by polymerase chain reaction. FLAG epitope-tagged constructs were produced by adding an oligonucleotide encoding the FLAG epitope (DYKDDDDK) to the carboxyl terminus of gp130.

COS-1 and HepG2 cells were maintained as described (9Lai C.-F. Ripperger J. Morella K.K. Wang Y. Gearing D.P. Horseman N.D. Campos S.P. Fey G.H. Baumann H. J. Biol.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 5707-5717Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar), and HepG2 cells with 20–23 μg of DNA/ml by the calcium phosphate method (26O'Mahoney J.V. Adams T.E. DNA Cell Biol. 1994; 13: 1227-1232Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). For EMSA and Western blot analysis, cells were cultured for 8 h in serum-free medium and then treated for 5 min to 24 h with 100 ng/ml of G-CSF (Immunex Corp.). For CAT gene regulation, the cytokine treatment lasted 24 h. To determine CAT activity within the linear range of the enzyme reaction, aliquots of serially diluted cell extracts were used. The values were normalized to the cotransfected marker, MUP, and calculated relative to the control-treated cell cultures in each experimental series. The means ± S.D. of at least three independently performed transfection experiments are shown. Whole cell lysates were prepared as described previously (27Sadowski H.B. Shuai K. Darnell Jr., J.E. Gilman M.Z. Science. 1993; 261: 1739-1744Crossref PubMed Scopus (642) Google Scholar), and the DNA-binding activity was analyzed by EMSA using 32P-labeled double-stranded m67SIE for STAT1 and STAT3 (27Sadowski H.B.

Biol. Med. 1991; 8: 267-285PubMed Google Scholar). For immunoprecipitation, transfected cells were lysed in 1% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mmNaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm NaF, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm EGTA. The cleared cell extracts were reacted with monoclonal antibody against Abl (Pharmingen) or against FLAG (M2; Eastman Kodak Co.). Immune complexes were collected by binding to protein G-Sepharose (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) and analyzed by either one- or two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Bio-Rad). Proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad) and reacted, depending upon the experimental settings, with anti-phosphotyrosine (PY20), anti-JAK1, or anti-TYK2 antibody from Transduction Laboratories; anti-phosphotyrosine STAT3 antibody from New England Biolabs Inc.; or anti-STAT3 (C-20), anti-JAK2 (C-20), anti-SHP-2 (C-19), anti-FLAG, or anti-Bcr (N-14) antibody from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. The immune complexes were visualized by the enhanced chemiluminescence reaction (Amersham Corp.). For immunolocalization, transfected cells were cultured on coverslips, fixed with cold methanol, and reacted with anti-Bcr antibody followed by fluorescein-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse immunoglobulin. Cells were photographed on a Zeiss fluorescence microscope. COS-1 cells, transfected with Bcr/gp130-FLAG or Bcr/gp130ΔTM-FLAG, were lysed (5 × 107 cells/ml) in the same buffer as used for immunoprecipitation. After centrifugation at 100,000 ×g for 1 h, 200 μl of the supernatant fraction were applied onto a Sephacryl S-300 column (6 × 300 mm; Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) and chromatographed in lysis buffer at a flow rate of 1.7 ml/h. The eluate was collected in 280-μl fractions. Aliquots (30 μl) from alternate fractions were analyzed for anti-FLAG antibody-reactive proteins by Western blotting. The column was calibrated with blue dextran (exclusion volume indicator), dimeric and monomeric bovine serum albumin, and ovalbumin. To determine the role of the transmembrane domain in gp130 signaling, we designed two cytoplasmic fusion proteins (Bcr/gp130 and Bcr/gp130ΔTM) that differ from each other by the presence of the transmembrane domain (Fig.1 A). FLAG epitope-tagged versions were also prepared to facilitate immunodetection and immunoprecipitation. The proteins were predicted to tetramerize through the N-terminal Bcr peptide (15Tauchi T. Miyazawa K. Feng G.-S. Broxmeyer H.E. Toyama K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1389-1394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), thereby bringing cytoplasmic gp130 domains into close proximity of each other. This complex formation is similar to what is assumed to occur in ligand-activated G-CSFR-gp130 (14Baumann H. Symes A.J. Comeau M.R. Morella K.K. Wang Y. Friend D. Ziegler S.F. Fink J.S. Gearing D.P.

EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1942-1951Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Within the range of experimental variation, transient transfection of the Bcr/gp130 constructs into HepG2 and COS-1 cells indicated comparable expression of the respective mRNAs (Fig. 1 B). The synthesis of the proteins with the expected sizes of 42,500 Da for Bcr/gp130 and 39,000 Da for Bcr/gp130ΔTM was detected (Fig.1 C). One or two additional, smaller sized proteins were also visible in Bcr/gp130ΔTM-transfected cells that may represent proteolytic degradation products. Although expression of the Bcr/gp130 proteins was somewhat variable among individual transfection experiments in both cell types, the immunodetectable level of Bcr/gp130ΔTM (with or without FLAG) was consistently severalfold higher than that of Bcr/gp130. Transfection of gp130cyto-FLAG, which lacks the N-terminal Bcr extension, yielded undetectable to trace amounts of accumulated protein (Fig. 1 C), despite a mRNA level (Fig. 1 B) and protein synthesis (data not shown) that were equivalent to the Bcr-modified constructs. This suggests that the cytoplasmic gp130 protein is rapidly turned over and that the Bcr domain enhances the stability of the fusion protein. Immunocytochemical staining demonstrated the predominant cytoplasmic localization of the Bcr/gp130 proteins (Fig. 1 D). Oligomerization of Bcr/gp130 proteins was determined by size fractionation (Fig. 2 A) and by co-immunoprecipitation with p190Bcr/Abl (Fig. 2 B). Gel filtration of extracts from COS-1 cells expressing Bcr/gp130-FLAG or Bcr/gp130ΔTM-FLAG (Fig. 2 A) revealed that the major fractions of the fusion proteins eluted with apparent sizes of 160 and 140 kDa, respectively, in agreement with the sizes expected for tetrameric complexes. Identical results were obtained with the Bcr/gp130 constructs without the FLAG epitope (data not shown). The Bcr-specific interaction was identified by the association of Bcr/gp130 with coexpressed p190Bcr/Abl and co-immunoprecipitation with Abl antibody (Fig. 2 B). The tyrosine phosphorylation of the gp130 cytoplasmic domain is an indicator for the immediate action of gp130-containing receptor complexes (6Stahl N. Farruggella T.J. Boulton T.G. Zhong Z.

However, this phosphorylation is reported to be transient. Nevertheless, we expected that signaling-competent Bcr/gp130 proteins might show detectable tyrosine phosphorylation. We immunoprecipitated Bcr/gp130-FLAG from the cell extract, but failed to detect a reaction with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies on two-dimensional immunoblots (Fig. 3 A). In the presence of overexpressed JAK1, however, a fraction of Bcr/gp130 reacted with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies, demonstrating that Bcr/gp130 can serve as substrate for this kinase. To determine the influence of the transmembrane domain on phosphorylation by JAK isoforms, FLAG-tagged Bcr/gp130 and Bcr/gp130ΔTM were tested under comparable transfection conditions in HepG2 cells in the presence of increasing doses of JAK1, JAK2, or TYK2 (Fig. 3 B). Despite the low expression of Bcr/gp130, its phosphorylation by each kinase was apparent. The action of JAK1 appeared to be most prominent, followed by that of TYK2 and JAK2. In contrast, the relatively abundant Bcr/gp130ΔTM construct showed a much lower phosphorylation in the presence of TYK2 and only a trace in the presence of JAK2. Phosphorylation of Bcr/gp130ΔTM by JAK2 could only be observed clearly in cells that expressed the kinase severalfold above that seen in Fig. 3 B (data not shown). The results in Fig. 3 (A and B) illustrate that both Bcr/gp130 constructs are accessible to overexpressed JAK proteins. Since, however, signaling of the normal gp130 protein is believed to be mediated by JAK proteins physically associated with the intracellular domain of gp130 (6Stahl N. Farruggella T.J. Boulton T.G. Zhong Z. Darnell Jr., J.E. Yancopoulos G.D. Science. 1995; 267: 1349-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (869) Google Scholar), we needed to demonstrate that such an interaction of JAK proteins with the cytoplasmic Bcr/gp130 construct was possible. To do so, we overexpressed in COS-1 cells FLAG-tagged Bcr/gp130 or Bcr/gp130ΔTM in the presence of JAK1, JAK2, or TYK2 (Fig.3 C). The Bcr/gp130 proteins were then immunoprecipitated and analyzed by immunoblotting for coprecipitated JAK proteins. Moreover, the kinase-mediated phosphorylation of tyrosine 759 of gp130, which serves as a binding site for the cytoplasmic protein-tyrosine phosphatase SHP-2 (see Fig. 1 A and Ref. 6Stahl N. Farruggella T.J. Boulton T.G. Zhong Z. Darnell Jr., J.E. Yancopoulos G.D. Science. 1995; 267: 1349-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (869) Google Scholar), should be recognized by detection of COS-1 cell-derived SHP-2 in the immunoprecipitates. As shown in Fig. 3 C, a prominent association of JAK1 and TYK2 with Bcr/gp130 was seen. Surprisingly, repeated experiments yielded only a minor signal for JAK2. Nevertheless, each of the kinases promoted recovery of SHP-2 with Bcr/gp130 that was significantly above the association seen in the cells not transfected with JAK proteins. An equivalent series of transfection experiments carried out with Bcr/gp130ΔTM showed that only JAK1 was detectably associated with the protein (Fig.3 C). The ratios of JAK1 to FLAG signal seen with the Bcr/gp130 and Bcr/gp130ΔTM complexes also indicated that the latter construct was less effective in retaining the kinase. The restricted interaction of the kinases with Bcr/gp130ΔTM was similarly reflected in the detection of co-immunoprecipitated SHP-2. Since activation of DNA binding by STAT1, STAT3, and, to a lesser extent, STAT5 is characteristic for gp130-mediated signaling and is particularly prominent after treatment of cells for a few minutes with IL-6-type cytokines (1Kishimoto T. Akira S. Narazaki M. Taga T. Blood. 1995; 86: 1243-1254Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Lai C.-F. Ripperger J. Morella K.K. Wang Y. Gearing D.P. Horseman N.D. Campos S.P. Fey G.H. Baumann H. J. Biol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 29998-30006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), we determined whether Bcr/gp130 expression had similar effects on STAT proteins in HepG2 cells (Fig.4 A). Analysis of Bcr/gp130-transfected cells did not reveal appreciable changes in the DNA-binding activity of endogenous STAT proteins (Fig. 4 A,lanes 1 and 2) or cotransfected STAT1 (lane 3). A minor increase in DNA-binding activity was noted, however, in STAT3-transfected cells (lane 4). To test the sensitivity of STAT activation to specific JAK proteins, we coexpressed Bcr/gp130 with JAK1, JAK2, or TYK2 (data for JAK2 shown in Fig. 4 A; JAK1 and TYK2 gave similar results). Although JAK2, even at a relatively low dose and in the absence of Bcr/gp130, activated coexpressed STAT1 and STAT3 (lanes 6 and 7), its action was enhanced in the presence of Bcr/gp130 (lanes 9and 10). Most prominent was the combined action of Bcr/gp130 and JAK2 on STAT5B (lane 15). None of the JAK effects approached that of G-CSFR-gp130, which activated, within 15 min of G-CSF treatment, endogenous STAT1 and STAT3 or cotransfected STAT proteins (lanes 11–13 and 18). For proper comparison, however, we needed to consider that if Bcr/gp130 functioned as a constitutively active factor, it should produce an effect on STAT proteins that was more similar to that elicited by continuous treatment of cells with cytokines engaging gp130. Indeed, HepG2 cells, when transfected with G-CSFR-gp130 and treated with G-CSF for 24 h, showed a DNA-binding activity of STAT3 that was slightly above control levels and was comparable to that of Bcr/gp130-transfected cells (Fig.4 B, upper panel). Furthermore, a minor elevated tyrosine phosphorylation of endogenous STAT3 was detectable in both transfected cell types (Fig. 4 B, lower panel). The gene-inducing action of the Bcr/gp130 constructs was determined by transfecting HepG2 cells with increasing amounts of expression vector for Bcr/gp130 together with the IL-6RE-containing CAT reporter gene construct (Fig.5 A). Both Bcr/gp130 and Bcr/gp130-FLAG mediated a dose-dependent increase in CAT activity and were, at 5 μg/ml, almost as effective as the ligand-induced response of endogenous IL-6R or transfected G-CSFR-gp130. This result also showed that the addition of the FLAG epitope just carboxyl-terminal to Box 3d only slightly reduced the signaling function of Bcr/gp130. HepG2 cells, which were similarly transfected with G-CSFR-gp130 or with full-length human gp130, but not subjected to any cytokine treatment, did not produce an increase in CAT reporter gene expression (Fig. 5 A). This demonstrated that simply overexpressing gp130 with the transmembrane domain, but present in presumably monomeric form, was not sufficient for gene induction. The engagement of STAT3 by Bcr/gp130 for signaling was apparent by the modestly enhanced gene induction with overexpressed STAT3 and by the drastic reduction in the presence of coexpressed dominant-negative STAT3Δ55C (Fig. 5 B). In contrast, Bcr/gp130ΔTM was inactive in gene induction (Fig. 5 A), even at the highest concentrations tested. Moreover, overexpressed STAT3 was also unable to restore signaling leading to gene induction (Fig. 5 B). The effect of Bcr/gp130 was lower than that of ligand-activated G-CSFR-gp130 (Fig. 5 A), which may, in part, be due to the limited access of Bcr/gp130 to the signaling molecules, i.e.JAK proteins. Therefore, we co-introduced JAK expression vectors at a dose that alone was essentially ineffective in inducing the IL-6RE reporter gene (Fig. 5 C). As shown previously (19Ripperger J. Fritz S. Richter K. Hocke G.M. Lottspeich F. Fey G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29998-30006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), at higher concentrations, overexpressed JAK proteins are capable of inducing cytokine-responsive gene constructs independently of the action of IL-6-type cytokine receptors. Combinations of Bcr/gp130 with JAK1, JAK2, or TYK2 increased 2–4-fold the gene-inducing activity of submaximal doses of Bcr/gp130 (Fig. 5 C). Interestingly, JAK1 and TYK2, but not JAK2, also cooperated with Bcr/gp130ΔTM and produced a 5-fold elevated CAT expression. This gene induction by Bcr/gp130ΔTM also demonstrated that the deletion of the transmembrane domains did not generate a strictly inactive protein. Taken together, these results suggest that the transmembrane domain of gp130 is necessary for the assembly of a signaling-competent complex of the gp130 cytoplasmic domains. Moreover, this region appears to determine, in part, the interaction with and/or the activation of JAK isoforms. The JAK-specific gene induction mediated by the Bcr/gp130 constructs followed qualitatively the pattern of phosphorylation of the Bcr/gp130 proteins by the JAK proteins as noted in Fig. 3 B. The results obtained with Bcr/gp130ΔTM and shown in Figs. 3 Cand 5 C also suggest that TYK2, unlike JAK2, may mediate gene induction without being physically associated with gp130. The Bcr/gp130 construct is a constitutively active cytoplasmic protein that shows IL-6R signaling capability. As such, the chimeric protein might also act as an oncogenic factor in cells that respond to IL-6 and related cytokines by enhanced proliferation (1Kishimoto T. Akira S. Narazaki M. Taga T. Blood. 1995; 86: 1243-1254Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, our attempts to introduce an IL-3-independent growth of Ba/F3 cells by stable expression of Bcr/gp130 were negative. 2H. Kim and H. Baumann, unpublished data. One possibility is that, due to the cytoplasmic localization, Bcr/gp130 does not have adequate access to the signal transduction pathways that require action at the plasma membrane site (1Kishimoto T. Akira S. Narazaki M. Taga T. Blood. 1995; 86: 1243-1254Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Hirano T. Matsuda T. Nakajima K. Stem Cells. 1994; 12: 262-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). This may also explain the less effective gene induction by Bcr/gp130 relative to G-CSFR-gp130. Yet, the chimeric Bcr/gp130 construct is sufficiently active to induce gene expression with the specificity of Box 3-containing hematopoietin receptors (9Lai C.-F. Ripperger J. Morella K.K. Wang Y.

Considering that the receptors for IL-6-type cytokines are predicted to act as oligomeric complexes in which the transmembrane domains of at least two signal-transducing subunits are involved, a functional contribution may be exerted by each of the transmembrane domains. It is also conceivable that the transmembrane domains of IL-6Rα or IL-11R similarly contribute to signaling. Soluble IL-6Rα or IL-11R, lacking the transmembrane and intracellular domains, mediates ligand-dependent signaling through binding to membrane gp130 (29Tamura T. Udagawa N. Takahashi T. Miyaura C. Tanaka S. Yamada Y. Koishihara Y. Ohsugi K. Kumaki K. Taga T. Kishimoto T. Suda T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11924-11928Crossref PubMed Scopus (777) Google Scholar, 30Mackiewicz A.

However, comparative studies have indicated a much lower signaling efficiency through the soluble receptors than through the membrane receptors (31Baumann H. Wang Y. Morella K.K. Lai C.-F. Dams H.

Nat. Biotechnol. 1997; 15: 142-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar), suggesting a supportive function for the transmembrane/cytoplasmic domain of the ligand-binding subunits. Given that the transmembrane domain assumes an α-helical structure (33Hibi M. Murakami M. Saito M. Hirano T. Taga T. Kishimoto T. Cell. 1990; 63: 1149-1157Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1104) Google Scholar), we assume that the transmembrane domain may be necessary for aligning or transmitting conformational changes to the cytoplasmic regions of gp130, thereby facilitating the binding or functional recruitment of signaling intermediates like JAK or STAT proteins.

Phosphoenzyme formation from Pi in the Ca2+-ATPase (reversal of hydrolysis of the phosphoenzyme intermediate) was almost completely inhibited by this modification. Tight binding of F− and Mg2+ and high affinity binding of vanadate in the presence of Mg2+, both of which produce transition state analogs for phosphoenzyme formation from the magnesium-enzyme-phosphate complex, were also inhibited. Formation of the phosphoenzyme from acetyl phosphate in the forward reaction was only weakly inhibited, but hydrolysis of the phosphoenzyme was strongly inhibited. The enzyme was protected by tight binding of F−and Mg2+ or by high affinity binding of vanadate in the presence of Mg2+ against the DEPC-induced inhibition of phosphoenzyme formation from Pi. The enzyme was also protected by tight binding of F− and Mg2+against the DEPC-induced inhibition of phosphoenzyme hydrolysis. Peptide mapping of the tryptic digests, detection of peptides containing DEPC-modified histidine by UV absorption at 240 nm, amino acid analysis, sequencing, and mass spectrometry showed that His-5 was a single major residue protected by the above transition state analogs against the modification with DEPC. These results indicate that modification of His-5 with DEPC is responsible for the DEPC-induced inhibition of phosphoenzyme formation from Pi and of phosphoenzyme hydrolysis and suggest that His-5 is located in or very close to the catalytic site in the transition state for phosphoenzyme formation from the magnesium-enzyme-phosphate complex and is likely involved in the catalytic process of this reaction step.

Ca2+-ATPase is a 110-kDa membrane-bound protein, the primary structure of which has been revealed (1Brandl C.J. Green N.M. Korczak B. MacLennan D.H.

The enzyme is activated by high affinity Ca2+ binding, and then the γ-phosphoryl group of MgATP bound to the ATP-binding site is transferred to Asp-351 (1Brandl C.J. Green N.M. Korczak B.

A subsequent conformational change of the EP results in Ca2+ release to the lumen (9Champeil P. Guillain F. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 7623-7633Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Finally, theEP is hydrolyzed to form Pi and the dephosphoenzyme. Acetyl phosphate also serves as a substrate through formation and hydrolysis of EP (10Friedman Z. Makinose M. FEBS Lett. 1970; 11: 69-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 11Pucell A. Martonosi A. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 3389-3397Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The EP can be formed from Pi in the presence of Mg2+and absence of Ca2+ by reversal of EP hydrolysis (12Kanazawa T. Boyer P.D. J. Biol.

This EP formation occurs through a magnesium-enzyme-phosphate complex that is formed by random binding of Mg2+ and Pi to the enzyme (14Punzengruber C. Prager R. Kolassa N. Winkler F. Suko J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1978; 92: 349-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 15Kolassa N. Punzengruber C. Suko J. Makinose M. FEBS Lett. 1979; 108: 495-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar).

Vanadate also binds with high affinity to the enzyme in the presence of Mg2+ to form a transition state analog for thisEP formation (19Dupont Y. Bennett N. FEBS Lett. 1982; 139: 237-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 20Inesi G. Lewis D. Murphy A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 996-1003Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). By utilizing the protection of the catalytic site by these transition state analogs against chemical modification, we have recently identified Arg-198 involved in 1,2-cyclohexanedione-induced inhibition of EP formation from Pi and suggested that this residue is located in or close to the catalytic site in the transition state (21Saino T.

Coan and DiCarlo (24Coan C. DiCarlo R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5376-5384Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) showed previously that EP hydrolysis in this enzyme is inhibited by modification of histidine with DEPC. However, the histidyl residue(s) involved in this inhibition has not yet been identified. In the present study, to identify the histidyl residue(s) involved in the DEPC-induced inhibition of the SR Ca2+-ATPase, we have modified the enzyme with DEPC and examined effects of the above transition state analogs on this modification. DEPC reacts with histidyl residues to yield N-carbethoxyhistidine derivatives (28Miles E.W. Methods Enzymol. 1977; 47: 431-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (815) Google Scholar), which can be detected spectrophotometrically in HPLC of proteolytic digests since this modification causes an increase in absorbance at 240 nm (29Lundblad R.L. Techniques in Protein Modification. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1995Google Scholar, 30Christendat D. Turnbull J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 4468-4479Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). We have found that EP formation from Pi has been inhibited by modification with DEPC and that the enzyme has been protected by these transition state analogs against this inhibition. Peptide mapping of the tryptic digests, detection of peptides containing DEPC-modified histidine by absorption at 240 nm, amino acid analysis, sequencing, and mass spectrometry have shown that His-5 is a single major residue protected by the transition state analogs against the modification with DEPC. The results indicate that modification of His-5 is responsible for the inhibition of EP formation from Pi and suggest that His-5 is located in or very close to the catalytic site in the transition state for EP formation from the magnesium-enzyme-phosphate complex and is likely involved in the catalytic process of this reaction step. SR vesicles were prepared from rabbit skeletal muscle and stored at −80 °C as described previously (31Nakamura S. Suzuki H. Kanazawa T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16015-16019Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The contents of phosphorylation site in the preparations determined with [γ-32P]ATP according to Barrabinet al. (32Barrabin H. Scofano H.M. Inesi G. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 1542-1548Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) ranged from 3.9 to 4.4 nmol/mg. Pretreatment of the SR vesicles with F− and Mg2+ was performed as described previously (18Daiho T. Kubota T. Kanazawa T. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 10021-10026Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) with slight modifications. The vesicles (2 mg/ml) were incubated at 25 °C for 3 h in 1 mm KF, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 0.1m KCl, 20% (v/v) Me2SO, 20% (v/v) glycerol, and 40 mm imidazole HCl (pH 7.5), unless otherwise stated. The reaction was quenched by diluting the mixture twice with an ice-cold solution containing 0.1 mm CaCl2, 0.1m KCl, 0.3 m sucrose, and 5 mmMOPS-Tris (pH 7.0). The resulting vesicles were washed by centrifugation once with this solution. Modification was started at 25 °C in 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mmCaCl2, 0.1 m KCl, and 100 mmMES-NaOH (pH 6.0), unless otherwise stated, by adding DEPC (dissolved in acetonitrile) or the same volume of acetonitrile to a suspension of the SR vesicles to give 10 mg of the vesicles/ml, 4.5 or 0 mm DEPC, and 2% (v/v) acetonitrile. The modification was quenched at 25 °C by diluting the mixture 10 times with a solution containing 0.1 m KCl and 7 mmhistidine HCl (pH 6.0). The SR vesicles were treated with F− and Mg2+ as described above. In the control samples, CaCl2 was added to the incubation medium to give 0.1 mm free Ca2+ under the otherwise same conditions as above (tight binding of F− and Mg2+ is prevented by 0.1 mm Ca2+(see Ref. 18Daiho T. Kubota T. Kanazawa T. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 10021-10026Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar)). The treated vesicles were washed by centrifugation four times with a solution containing 2 mm EDTA, 0.1m KCl, 1 μm A23187, 10% (v/v) Me2SO, and 5 mm MOPS-NaOH (pH 7.0) and suspended in deionized water. Magnesium bound to the vesicles was extracted with 0.8 n HNO3, and the concentration of magnesium in the extract was determined by atomic absorption spectrophotometry as described previously (17Kubota T. Daiho T. Kanazawa T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1163: 131-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The content of tightly bound Mg2+ was obtained by subtracting the content of magnesium in the extract from the control sample. Fluoride bound to the vesicles was extracted by incubating the vesicles at 95 °C for 5 min in 5 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 8.0). The sample was then centrifuged to remove insoluble materials, and KNO3 was added to the supernatant to give 0.1m. The sample was adjusted to pH 3.0 with citric acid, and the concentration of F− was measured by use of a fluoride-selective electrode as described previously (17Kubota T. Daiho T. Kanazawa T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1163: 131-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The content of tightly bound F− was obtained by subtracting the content of F− in the extract from the control sample. The SR vesicles (0.2 mg/ml) were incubated at 25 °C for 30 min in various concentrations of vanadate, 0.1 m KCl, 20% (v/v) Me2SO, 30 mm MOPS-NaOH (pH 7.0), and others as described in the legend to Fig. 3. The mixture was centrifuged, and the pellet was dissolved in 2% (w/v) SDS. The concentration of vanadate was measured by the method of Goodno (33Goodno C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 2620-2624Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). When the SR vesicles were pretreated with F− and Mg2+, tightly bound F− and Mg2+ were entirely released by incubation at 25 °C for 30 min in 20 mm CaCl2, 0.1 m KCl, and 100 mm MOPS-NaOH (pH 7.0) (17Kubota T. Daiho T. Kanazawa T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1163: 131-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) before vanadate binding was determined. The DEPC-modified SR vesicles (5 mg/ml) were digested with TPCK-trypsin (1 mg/ml) at 37 °C for 3 h in 20 mm CaCl2 and 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.0). After centrifugation, the supernatant was subjected to reversed phase HPLC that was performed at a flow rate of 1 ml/min as described previously (34Yamagata K. Daiho T. Kanazawa T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20930-20936Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The absorbance of peptides containing DEPC-modified histidine was monitored at 240 nm (see Refs. 29Lundblad R.L. Techniques in Protein Modification. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1995Google Scholar and 30Christendat D. Turnbull J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 4468-4479Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), and the absorbance of peptides was monitored at 214 nm. It was difficult to determine the content of DEPC-modified histidine in the DEPC-modified vesicles from the absorbance at 240 nm because, in addition to mono-N-carbethoxyhistidine, bis-carbethoxyhistidine was produced at an unknown ratio to mono-N-carbethoxyhistidine by modification of the vesicles with DEPC (see Fig. 7, Table II, and text described under “Results”). The amino acid compositions of the isolated peptides were analyzed with a precolumn derivatization reversed phase HPLC Waters Pico-Tag system after acid hydrolysis of the peptides in 6 n HCl at 110 °C for 21 h. Sequencing was performed with an Applied Biosystems 477A/120A sequencer. Mass determination of the isolated peptides was made on a JEOL JMS-SX102 mass spectrometer with the frit-fast atom bombardment probe as described previously (21Saino T. Daiho T. Kanazawa T. J. Biol.

Open table in a new tab Phosphorylation of the SR vesicles (0.4 mg/ml) with 1 mm32Pi was performed at 25 °C for 10 min in 20 mm MgCl2, 5 mm EGTA, 40% (v/v) Me2SO, and 50 mm MOPS-Tris (pH 7.0). The reaction was quenched with trichloroacetic acid containing Pi. Phosphorylation of the vesicles (1 mg/ml) with 3 mm acetyl [32P]phosphate was performed at 25 °C in 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mmCaCl2, 50 mm KCl, and 50 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.5), unless otherwise stated. The reaction was quenched with trichloroacetic acid containing nonradioactive acetyl phosphate. The amount of EP formed was determined as described previously (17Kubota T. Daiho T. Kanazawa T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1163: 131-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). When the SR vesicles were pretreated with F− and Mg2+, tightly bound F− and Mg2+ were released as described above before phosphorylation was performed. When the SR vesicles were preincubated with vanadate and Mg2+, bound vanadate and Mg2+were entirely released by incubation at 25 °C for 30 min in 3 mm CaCl2, 2 mm ATP, 0.1m KCl, and 100 mm MOPS-NaOH (pH 7.0) (35Medda P.

KF was from Nacalai Tesque (Kyoto, Japan). ATP was from Yamasa Biochemicals (Choshi, Japan). Acetyl phosphate was from Kohjin (Tokyo, Japan). [γ-32P]ATP and 32Pi were obtained from NEN Life Science Products.32Pi was purified according to Kanazawa and Boyer (12Kanazawa T. Boyer P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 3163-3172Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Acetyl [32P]phosphate was prepared by Procedure B in the method of Stadtman (37Stadtman E.R. Methods Enzymol. 1957; 3: 228-231Crossref Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Vanadate solutions were prepared from Na3VO4 according to Goodno (33Goodno C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 2620-2624Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar) just before use. Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Lowry et al. (38Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with bovine serum albumin as a standard. Data were analyzed by the nonlinear least squares method as described previously (17Kubota T. Daiho T. Kanazawa T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1163: 131-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.1 A, when the SR vesicles were pretreated without F− in the presence of Mg2+and then treated with DEPC in the presence of 2 mmCaCl2 (□), EP formation from Piwas strongly inhibited with apparent first order kinetics at a rate of 0.11 min−1 and fell to 10% of the original level in 40 min. When the vesicles were pretreated with F− and Mg2+ and then treated with DEPC (○), the enzyme was partially protected against the DEPC-induced inhibition ofEP formation (33.2% maximum inhibition with a rate constant of 0.15 min−1). When the vesicles were treated with DEPC in the presence of 0.2 mm CaCl2 (⋄ and ◃) or in the absence of Ca2+ (▿ and ▵), the DEPC-induced inhibition (⋄ and ▿) and the protection by the pretreatment with F− and Mg2+ (◃ and ▵) were somewhat less than those in the presence of 2 mm CaCl2. For this reason, in subsequent experiments, modification with DEPC was performed in the presence of 2 mm CaCl2 unless otherwise stated. Pretreatment with F− in the absence of Mg2+ provided no protection (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 1 B, when the SR vesicles were treated with DEPC in the presence of 0.5 mm vanadate and 10 mm MgCl2 and absence of Ca2+ (○), the enzyme was protected against the DEPC-induced inhibition ofEP formation from Pi (49.1% maximum inhibition with a rate constant of 0.12 min−1). The extent of this protection was almost the same as that of the protection afforded by the pretreatment with F− and Mg2+. In the absence of vanadate and presence of 9.7 mm Mg2+(□) or in the presence of 0.5 mm vanadate and absence of Mg2+ (▵), no protection was observed (84.6% maximum inhibition with a rate constant of 0.13 min−1). As shown in Fig. 1 C, when the SR vesicles were preincubated with Pi in the presence of Mg2+ and absence of Ca2+ in 30% (v/v) Me2SO at 25 °C for 20 min (4.9 nmol/mg EP was formed by this preincubation) and then treated with DEPC, the enzyme was hardly protected against the DEPC-induced inhibition of EP formation from Pi(compare ○ with □). Binding of Pi to the catalytic site in the presence of 10 mm Pi and absence of Mg2+ afforded no protection (compare ▵ with ▿). Binding of Mg2+ in the absence of Pi and presence of 9.7 mm Mg2+ provided some protection (compare □ with ▿), but higher concentrations of Mg2+ up to 29 mm provided no further protection (data not shown). This is in contrast to no protection afforded by 9.7 mmMg2+ in the absence of Me2SO (see Fig.1 B, □). The SR vesicles were treated with or without DEPC for various times, and then tight binding of F− and Mg2+ was determined (Fig. 2). The amounts of tightly bound F− and Mg2+ at zero time of the treatment were 17.0 and 8.1 nmol/mg, respectively, being 4.3 and 2.0 times the content of phosphorylation site (4.0 nmol/mg) in the vesicles used. This is in agreement with our previous findings (18Daiho T. Kubota T. Kanazawa T. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 10021-10026Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 21Saino T. Daiho T. Kanazawa T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21142-21150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) that the stoichiometry of tight binding of F− and Mg2+ to the maximum level of phosphorylation is 4:2:1. The tight binding was inhibited progressively during the treatment with DEPC (○ and ▵). The rate of this inhibition (0.10 min−1) was in agreement with that of the DEPC-induced inhibition of EP formation from Pi, although the maximum inhibition (72–73%) appeared to be slightly less than that of the EP formation (see Fig. 1 A, □). The SR vesicles were pretreated with or without F− in the presence of Mg2+ and then treated with or without DEPC for 40 min (Fig.3 A). After tightly bound F− and Mg2+ were removed, vanadate binding was determined at various concentrations of vanadate in the presence (▵, □, and ○) and absence (▴, ▪, and •) of Mg2+. In the control (▵), in which the vesicles were pretreated without F− and then treated without DEPC, vanadate binding in the presence of Mg2+ increased with increasing concentration of vanadate and was saturated with 4 μm vanadate. The maximum level of this binding was in approximate agreement with the content of phosphorylation site (4.0 nmol/mg). This binding was nearly completely inhibited by the treatment with DEPC (□). When the vesicles were pretreated with F− and Mg2+ and then treated with DEPC (○), the enzyme was strongly protected against the DEPC-induced inhibition of vanadate binding. When the vesicles were pretreated without F− and then treated with DEPC for various times (Fig. 3 B, □), vanadate binding in the presence of Mg2+ was inhibited with apparent first order kinetics at a rate of 0.11 min−1, and its maximum inhibition was 80.4%. These kinetic parameters were in essential agreement with the rate (0.11 min−1) and maximum (89.7%) of the DEPC-induced inhibition of EP formation from Pi under the same conditions (see Fig. 1 A, □). The enzyme was protected by the pretreatment with F− and Mg2+ against the inhibition of vanadate binding (Fig.3 B, ○) to a similar extent (44.2% maximum inhibition with a rate constant of 0.09 min−1) as protected against the inhibition of EP formation from Pi (see Fig.1 A, ○). The SR vesicles were pretreated with (○ and •) or without (□ and ▪) F− in the presence of Mg2+ (Fig. 4, Aand B). In the experiments shown in Fig. 4 A, the pretreated vesicles were treated with (○ and □) or without (• and ▪) DEPC for various times. After tightly bound F− and Mg2+ were removed, EP formation from acetyl phosphate was determined. DEPC caused only weak inhibition of theEP formation when the vesicles were pretreated without F− (compare □ with ▪). This inhibition was unaffected by the pretreatment with F− and Mg2+ (compare ○ with □). In contrast to the results reported by Coan and DiCarlo (24Coan C. DiCarlo R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5376-5384Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), EP formation from ATP was almost completely inhibited by the treatment with DEPC (data not shown). This discrepancy may be possibly due to the difference in the experimental conditions used. In the experiments shown in Fig. 4 B, the pretreated vesicles were treated with (○ and □) or without (• and ▪) DEPC for 40 min. After tightly bound F− and Mg2+ were removed, the vesicles were phosphorylated with acetyl phosphate for various times. When the vesicles were pretreated without F− and then treated with DEPC (□), EP formation was only slightly slower than that (▪) in the vesicles that were pretreated without F− and then treated without DEPC. The pretreatment with F− and Mg2+ had virtually no effect on the kinetics of EP formation in the DEPC-treated vesicles (compare ○ with □). In the experiments shown in Fig. 4 C, the SR vesicles were pretreated with F− and Mg2+ (○ and •), without F− and with Mg2+ (□ and ▪), or with F− and without Mg2+ (▵ and ▴) and then treated with (○, □, and ▵) or without (•, ▪, and ▴) DEPC for 40 min. After tightly bound F− and Mg2+ were removed, the vesicles were phosphorylated with acetyl [32P]phosphate at 0 °C for 4 min. EP formation was quenched by addition of nonradioactive acetyl phosphate and EGTA, and the decay of EP was followed. When the vesicles were treated without DEPC (•, ▪, and ▴), theEP decay was rapid and could be described by a single exponential with a decay constant of 2.37 min−1. The kinetics of this decay was unaffected by any above pretreatment. When the vesicles were pretreated without F− and with Mg2+ (□) or with F− and without Mg2+ (▵) and then treated with DEPC, the EP decay was very slow and could be described by a single exponential with a decay constant of 0.17–0.21 min−1. When the vesicles were pretreated with F− and Mg2+ and then treated with DEPC (○), the EP decay could be described by a double exponential. The fast decaying component comprised 63.6% of total EP with a decay constant of 2.12 min−1. This constant was in substantial agreement with the decay constant (2.37 min−1) for EP (•, ▪, and ▴) that was formed with the vesicles treated without DEPC. The slow decaying component comprised 36.4% of total EP with a decay constant of 0.20 min−1. This constant was in good agreement with the decay constant (0.17–0.21 min−1) for EP (□ and ▵) that was formed with the vesicles pretreated without F− and with Mg2+, or with F− and without Mg2+, and then treated with DEPC. The SR vesicles were pretreated with or without F− in the presence of Mg2+ and then treated with or without DEPC for 12 min. After tightly bound F− and Mg2+ were removed, the vesicles were treated with 0.5 m hydroxylamine (pH 7.0) or with 0.5 m NaCl, and then EP formation from Pi was determined (TableI). When the vesicles were pretreated without F−, EP formation from Piwas markedly inhibited by the treatment with DEPC. The EP formation was partially restored by the subsequent treatment with hydroxylamine. The treatment with NaCl substituted for hydroxylamine caused no restoration of EP formation. When the vesicles were pretreated with F− and Mg2+, the DEPC-induced inhibition of EP formation was suppressed considerably. The subsequent treatment with hydroxylamine again caused a partial restoration of EP formation.Table IPartial restoration of EP formation from P i by the treatment of DEPC-modified SR vesicles with hydroxylaminePretreatmentDEPCEP formationNoneNaClNH2OHmmnmol/mgMgCl204.314.594.33MgCl24.51.371.302.30KF and MgCl204.214.314.21KF and MgCl24.52.772.803.17The SR vesicles were pretreated with or without KF in the presence of MgCl2, otherwise as described under “Experimental Procedures,” and then incubated with or without DEPC for 12 min.
