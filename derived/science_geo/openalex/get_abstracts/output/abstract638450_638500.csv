English et al. developed a group of stimuli-responsive hydrogels to respond to the programmable nuclease Cas12a (see the Perspective by Han et al. ). The materials undergo molecular to macroscopic changes after Cas12a-dependent cleavage of double- or single-stranded DNA integrated into the gel. The authors show controlled release of particles linked to or imprisoned within the DNA, degradation of a gel with DNA solely forming the cross-links, and permeabilization of a gel with DNA partially forming the cross-links. These tools allow for the production of materials that release encapsulated nanoparticles and cells, act as degradable fuses, and enable remote radio-frequency identification signaling.

Posttranslational modifications in intrinsically disordered regions of proteins can regulate RNA processing by regulating phase separation. Kim et al. used nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy to characterize phase separation in a model system comprising the C-terminal disordered regions of the translational regulators FMRP and CAPRIN1 that repress translation by deadenylating mRNA. Interactions between the proteins involve specific sequences in FMRP and CAPRIN1, and the propensity for mRNA to partition into the condensates depends on the phosphorylation patterns in the disordered regions. This mechanism integrates signaling pathways with the regulation of RNA processing. Science , this issue p. 825"

Nishikawa et al. used new observations from the S-net ocean-bottom seismic network to map slow earthquakes—disturbances that do not cause ground shaking—along the Japan Trench (see the Perspective by Houston). They found that the area that ruptured during the 2011 quake was bounded by areas that have large numbers of slow earthquakes. A segmentation likely caused the 2011 rupture to cease, an observation that is important for assessing risk from future major earthquakes. Science , this issue p. 808 ; see also p. 750"

Jaumann et al. analyzed images taken by the MASCOT camera during its descent and when resting on the surface. Colored light-emitting diodes were used to illuminate the lander's surroundings at night and produce color images. Ryugu's surface is dominated by two types of rock, but there is no evidence for fine-grained dust. Millimeter-sized inclusions in the rocks are similar to those present in carbonaceous chondrite meteorites. MASCOT operated for 17 hours on the surface before its nonrechargeable batteries ran out.

Penilla et al. developed two methods for welding ceramics using ultrafast lasers. One method tunes the ceramic properties, allowing the laser to transit through the ceramic and weld at the interface between pieces. The other method optimizes a gap between pieces to efficiently deposit energy. Both methods leverage short but energetic pulses to create a melt pool that allows ceramics to be joined, without the high temperature used for traditional ceramic welds. Science , this issue p. 803"

Harnessing the power of genomics, Amambua-Ngwa et al. of the Plasmodium Diversity Network Africa found substantial population structure within Africa that is consistent with human and vector population divergence (see the Perspective by Sibley). Specific signatures of selection by antimalarial drugs were detected, along with indications of the effect of colonization and slavery. Furthermore, whole-genome sequencing showed that there is extensive gene flow among the different regions and that Ethiopia has a distinctive population of P. falciparum , which may be indicative of coexistence with another malaria parasite, P. vivax.

Gonzalez et al. chronically implanted custom-built high-sensitivity microendoscopes and performed long-term imaging of neuronal activity in freely moving mutant mice. The majority of neurons were active on most days, but their firing rate changed across sessions and tasks. Although the responses of individual neurons changed, the responses of groups of neurons with synchronous activity were very stable across days and weeks. In addition, the network activity in hippocampal area CA1 recovered after an extended period without performing the task or even after abnormal activity induced by local lesions. These findings indicate the presence of attractor-like ensemble dynamics as a mechanism by which the representations of an environment are encoded in the brain. Science , this issue p. 821"
https://openalex.org/W2969705353,"Preeclampsia is one of the leading causes of maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality. Due to the lack of effective preventive measures, its prediction is essential to its prompt management. This study aimed to develop models using machine learning to predict late-onset preeclampsia using hospital electronic medical record data. The performance of the machine learning based models and models using conventional statistical methods were also compared. A total of 11,006 pregnant women who received antenatal care at Yonsei University Hospital were included. Maternal data were retrieved from electronic medical records during the early second trimester to 34 weeks. The prediction outcome was late-onset preeclampsia occurrence after 34 weeks’ gestation. Pattern recognition and cluster analysis were used to select the parameters included in the prediction models. Logistic regression, decision tree model, naïve Bayes classification, support vector machine, random forest algorithm, and stochastic gradient boosting method were used to construct the prediction models. C-statistics was used to assess the performance of each model. The overall preeclampsia development rate was 4.7% (474 patients). Systolic blood pressure, serum blood urea nitrogen and creatinine levels, platelet counts, serum potassium level, white blood cell count, serum calcium level, and urinary protein were the most influential variables included in the prediction models. C-statistics for the decision tree model, naïve Bayes classification, support vector machine, random forest algorithm, stochastic gradient boosting method, and logistic regression models were 0.857, 0.776, 0.573, 0.894, 0.924, and 0.806, respectively. The stochastic gradient boosting model had the best prediction performance with an accuracy and false positive rate of 0.973 and 0.009, respectively. The combined use of maternal factors and common antenatal laboratory data of the early second trimester through early third trimester could effectively predict late-onset preeclampsia using machine learning algorithms. Future prospective studies are needed to verify the clinical applicability algorithms."
https://openalex.org/W2969781413,"Sarcopenia due to loss of skeletal muscle mass and strength leads to physical inactivity and decreased quality of life. The number of individuals with sarcopenia is rapidly increasing as the number of older people increases worldwide, making this condition a medical and social problem. Some patients with sarcopenia exhibit accumulation of peri-muscular adipose tissue (PMAT) as ectopic fat deposition surrounding atrophied muscle. However, an association of PMAT with muscle atrophy has not been demonstrated. Here, we show that PMAT is associated with muscle atrophy in aged mice and that atrophy severity increases in parallel with cumulative doses of PMAT. We observed severe muscle atrophy in two different obese model mice harboring significant PMAT relative to respective control non-obese mice. We also report that denervation-induced muscle atrophy was accelerated in non-obese young mice transplanted around skeletal muscle with obese adipose tissue relative to controls transplanted with non-obese adipose tissue. Notably, transplantation of obese adipose tissue into peri-muscular regions increased nuclear translocation of FoxO transcription factors and upregulated expression FoxO targets associated with proteolysis (Atrogin1 and MuRF1) and cellular senescence (p19 and p21) in muscle. Conversely, in obese mice, PMAT removal attenuated denervation-induced muscle atrophy and suppressed upregulation of genes related to proteolysis and cellular senescence in muscle. We conclude that PMAT accumulation accelerates age- and obesity-induced muscle atrophy by increasing proteolysis and cellular senescence in muscle."
https://openalex.org/W2969522405,"The Norwegian randomized controlled trial Early Food for Future Health provided parental anticipatory guidance on early protective feeding practices from child age 6 to 12 months through an eHealth intervention. Previously published outcomes at child age 12 months indicated that the eHealth intervention increased daily vegetable/fruit intake and promoted more beneficial mealtime routines. The objective of the current paper is to evaluate the effects of the intervention at child age 24 months, one year after cessation.Parents of infants aged 3-5 months were recruited via social media and child health clinics during spring 2016. At child age 5.5 months, 715 mothers were randomized to either control (n = 358) or intervention (n = 360) arm. Primary study-outcomes were child eating behaviors, dietary intake, mealtime routines and maternal feeding practices and feeding styles. Secondary outcome was child anthropometry.In total 295 mothers (41%) completed the follow-up questionnaire at child age 24 months. Regarding fruit intake, 54.3% in the intervention group had a high score compared with 48.3% of the control group (p = 0.29). For intake of vegetables, 54.5% in the intervention group had a high score compared with 50.7% in the control group (p = 0.49). A total of 65.7% of the children in the intervention group were eating breakfast together with family ≥ 4 times per week, compared with 57.3% of the children in the control group (p = 0.12). There was no difference between the groups for child anthropometric outcomes at child age 24 months.At child age 24 months, we found no evidence of sustained intervention-effects. Although dietary patterns and mealtime routines at child age 24 months were reasonably consistent and in the same directions as at child age 12 months, the between-group differences were not significant. The large loss to follow-up may have limited power and validity and makes it difficult to draw overall conclusions. Future research is needed to improve knowledge of how short-time effects could be retained over longer term, taking into account that larger samples are necessary when planning longer-term follow-up studies.ISRCTN, ISRCTN13601567."

https://openalex.org/W2969523329,"Pancreatic β-cells express multiple phosphodiesterase (PDE) subtypes, but the specific roles for each in β-cell function, particularly in humans, is not clear. We evaluated the cellular role of PDE1, PDE3, and PDE4 activity in the rat insulinoma cell line INS-1 and in primary human β-cells using subtype-selective PDE inhibitors. Using a genetically encoded, FRET-based cAMP sensor, we found that the PDE1 inhibitor 8MM-IBMX, elevated cAMP levels in the absence of glucose to a greater extent than either the PDE3 inhibitor cilostamide or the PDE4 inhibitor rolipram. In 18 mM glucose, PDE1 inhibition elevated cAMP levels to a greater extent than PDE3 inhibition in INS-1 cells, while PDE4 inhibition was without effect. Inhibition of PDE1 or PDE4, but not PDE3, potentiated glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in INS-1 cells. PDE1 inhibition, but not PDE3 or PDE4 inhibition, reduced palmitate-induced caspase-3/7 activation, and enhanced CREB phosphorylation in INS-1 cells. In human β-cells, only PDE3 or PDE4 inhibition increased cAMP levels in 1.7 mM glucose, but PDE1, PDE3, or PDE4 inhibition potentiated cAMP levels in 16.7 mM glucose. Inhibition of PDE1 or PDE4 increased cAMP levels to a greater extent in 16.7 mM glucose than in 1.7 mM glucose in human β-cells. In contrast, elevation of cAMP levels by PDE3 inhibition was not different at these glucose concentrations. PDE1 inhibition also potentiated insulin secretion from human islets, suggesting that the role of PDE1 may be conserved between INS-1 cells and human pancreatic β-cells. Our results suggest that inhibition of PDE1 may be a useful strategy to potentiate glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, and to protect β-cells from the toxic effects of excess fatty acids."
https://openalex.org/W2969641109,"Bitcoin is the earliest cryptocurrency and among the most successful ones to date. Recently, its dynamical evolution has attracted the attention of the research community due to its completeness and richness in historical records. In this paper, we focus on the detailed evolution of bitcoin trading with the aim of elucidating the mechanism that drives the formation of the bitcoin transaction network. Our empirical investigation reveals that although the temporal properties of the transaction network possesses scale-free degree distribution like many other networks, its formation mechanism is different from the commonly assumed models of degree preferential attachment or wealth preferential attachment. By defining the fitness value of each node as the ability of the node to attract new connections, we have instead uncovered that the observed scale-free degree distribution results from the intrinsic fitness of each node following a power-law distribution. Our finding thus suggests that the “good-get-richer” rather than the “rich-get-richer” paradigm operates within the bitcoin ecosystem. Based on these findings, we propose a model that captures the temporal generative process by means of a fitness preferential attachment and data-driven birth/death mechanism. Our proposed model is able to produce structural properties in good agreement with those obtained from the empirical bitcoin network."
https://openalex.org/W2969361021,"Hepatic iron overload, a hallmark of hereditary hemochromatosis, triggers progressive liver disease. There is also increasing evidence for a pathogenic role of iron in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), which may progress to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), fibrosis, cirrhosis and hepatocellular cancer. Mouse models of hereditary hemochromatosis and NAFLD can be used to explore potential interactions between iron and lipid metabolic pathways. Hfe-/- mice, a model of moderate iron overload, were reported to develop early liver fibrosis in response to a high fat diet. However, this was not the case with Hjv-/- mice, a model of severe iron overload. These data raised the possibility that the Hfe gene may protect against liver injury independently of its iron regulatory function. Herein, we addressed this hypothesis in a comparative study utilizing wild type, Hfe-/-, Hjv-/- and double Hfe-/-Hjv-/- mice. The animals, all in C57BL/6J background, were fed with high fat diets for 14 weeks and developed hepatic steatosis, associated with iron overload. Hfe co-ablation did not sensitize steatotic Hjv-deficient mice to liver injury. Moreover, we did not observe any signs of liver inflammation or fibrosis even in single steatotic Hfe-/- mice. Ultrastructural studies revealed a reduced lipid and glycogen content in Hjv-/- hepatocytes, indicative of a metabolic defect. Interestingly, glycogen levels were restored in double Hfe-/-Hjv-/- mice, which is consistent with a metabolic function of Hfe. We conclude that hepatocellular iron excess does not aggravate diet-induced steatosis to steatohepatitis or early liver fibrosis in mouse models of hereditary hemochromatosis, irrespectively of the presence or lack of Hfe."
https://openalex.org/W2969392484,"Xylella fastidiosa is a plant pathogenic bacterium with devastating consequences to several crops of economic importance across the world. While this pathogen has been studied for over a century in the United States, several aspects of its biology remain to be investigated. Determining the physiological state of bacteria is essential to understand the effects of its interactions with different biotic and abiotic factors on cell viability. Although X. fastidiosa is culturable, its slow growing nature makes this technique cumbersome to assess the physiological state of cells present in a given environment. PMA-qPCR, i.e. the use of quantitative PCR combined with the pre-treatment of cells with the dye propidium monoazide, has been successfully used in a number of studies on human pathogens to calculate the proportion of viable cells, but has less frequently been tested on plant pathogens. We found that the use of a version of PMA, PMAxx, facilitated distinguishing between viable and non-viable cells based on cell membrane integrity in vitro and in planta. Additional experiments comparing the number of culturable, viable, and total cells in planta would help further confirm our initial results. Enhancers, intended to improve the efficacy of PMAxx, were not effective and appeared to be slightly toxic to X. fastidiosa."
https://openalex.org/W2969826198,"A subarctic fish community in mine-impacted Yellowknife Bay (Great Slave Lake, Northwest Territories, Canada) was investigated for biological and ecological processes controlling arsenic bioaccumulation. Total concentrations of arsenic, antimony, and metals were measured in over 400 fishes representing 13 species, and primary producers and consumers were included to characterize food web transfer. Yellowknife Bay had slightly more arsenic in surface waters (~3 μg/L) relative to the main body of Great Slave Lake (<1 μg/L), resulting in two-fold higher total arsenic concentrations in muscle of burbot (Lota lota), lake whitefish (Coregonus clupeaformis), and northern pike (Esox lucius). Other mining-associated contaminants, specifically antimony, lead, and silver, were typically below analytical detection in those fish species. No evidence was found for enhanced bioaccumulation of arsenic in long-lived, slow-growing subarctic fishes. Food web biodilution of total arsenic occurred between primary producers, aquatic invertebrates, and fish, although trophic position did not explain arsenic concentrations among fishes. Pelagic-feeding species had higher total arsenic concentrations compared to littoral fishes. Arsenic accumulated in subarctic fishes to comparable levels as fishes from lakes around the world with similar water arsenic concentrations. This first comprehensive study for a subarctic freshwater food web identified the importance of water exposure, biodilution, and habitat-specific feeding on arsenic bioaccumulation."
https://openalex.org/W2754813219,"This paper estimates the price changes in global bluefin tuna (BFT) markets in response to shifts in regional and global landings to evaluate the conservation and economic incentives from changes in the Total Allowable Catch (TAC) managed by all three Regional Fisheries Management Organizations. A fisherman's income, and thus the financial incentive to accept management measures controlling catch levels, depends in part on how responsive price is to overall catch. Individual fisherman, with their own best interest in mind, used to wish to increase their individual landings and create an incentive to ask to increase the TAC for the industry, without realizing the possible revenue loss due to the resulting falling prices. To protect the value of all stakeholders' property rights, a consensus to avoid abruptly raising the TAC, without first considering the potential loss due to market response, is needed. Alternatively, if revenue increases with lower TAC, a positive economic incentive for conservation is created if price increasing proportionately more than the lower supply, with harvest profits boosted by lower costs of production. To capture the complexity of substituting across various sources of supply and product form, a general synthetic inverse demand system is estimated to identify the impact of overall landings on BFT prices. This system estimates price flexibilities of both fresh and frozen longline-caught sashimi-grade tunas (Pacific, Atlantic and southern bluefins, and bigeye) at the Tokyo Center Market in Japan, including the Tsukiji Market, the world's largest fish auction market that served as the single global price leader for BFT. The resulting estimation shows that own-quantity price flexibilities of every type of fresh and frozen BFTs are less than unity and inflexible in their own consumption. This creates poor individual producer incentives for fishermen to reduce wild or farmed BFT supply, as there is a chance to increase their own revenue, under the unlikely condition that the total supply is fixed. However, by observing the rapid increases in the TAC of Eastern Atlantic bluefin tuna (EABFT) in the coming years, suppliers may not be better off as price will drop proportionally faster and total revenue if the estimated scale flexibility is greater than one. Based on the estimated scale flexibility of frozen BFT, which is slightly less than unity, the frozen subsector of EABFT suppliers is the only winner under the supply increases. Suppliers of frozen BFT in other regions, fresh BFT (in the Atlantic and elsewhere), and southern BFT and bigeye tuna will all be harmed through lower revenue by the supply increases. Additionally, while total revenue might stay the same for frozen BFT suppliers, fishermen will potentially receive lower profits due to higher operating costs associated with increased landings when the supply of EABFT increases. Given the number of sectors that ultimately lose financially in the short term and given the ecological (and production) risks accompanying an abrupt increase in fishing pressure in the long term, the global economic losses resulting from an increase in the allowable catch of Atlantic bluefin tuna will outweigh any potential increases to revenue."
https://openalex.org/W2969485580,"Environmental Enteric Dysfunction (EED) is an acquired small intestinal inflammatory condition underlying high rates of stunting in children <5 years of age in low- and middle-income countries. Children with EED are known to have repeated exposures to enteropathogens and environmental toxins that leads to malabsorptive syndrome. We aimed to characterize association of linear growth faltering with enteropathogen burden and subsequent changes in EED biomarkers. In a longitudinal birth cohort (n = 272), monthly anthropometric measurements (Length for Age Z score- LAZ) of asymptomatic children were obtained up to 18 months. Biological samples were collected at 6 and 9 months for the assessment of biomarkers. A customized TaqMan array card was used to target 40 enteropathogens in fecal samples. Linear regression was applied to study the effect of specific enteropathogen infection on change in linear growth (ΔLAZ). Presence of any pathogen in fecal sample correlated with serum flagellin IgA (6 mo, r = 0.19, p = 0.002), fecal Reg 1b (6 mo, r = 0.16, p = 0.01; 9mo, r = 0.16, p = 0.008) and serum Reg 1b (6 mo, r = 0.26, p<0.0001; 9 mo, r = 0.15, p = 0.008). At 6 months, presence of Campylobacter [β (SE) 7751.2 (2608.5), p = 0.003] and ETEC LT [β (SE) 7089.2 (3015.04), p = 0.019] was associated with increase in MPO. Giardia was associated with increase in Reg1b [β (SE) 72.189 (26.394), p = 0.006] and anti-flic IgA[β (SE) 0.054 (0.021), p = 0.0091]. Multiple enteropathogen infections in early life negatively correlated with ΔLAZ, and simultaneous changes in gut inflammatory and permeability markers. A combination vaccine targeting enteropathogens in early life could help in the prevention of future stunting."
https://openalex.org/W2969664387,"Background Recent nutrition guidelines for extremely-low-birth-weight infants (ELBWIs) recommend implementation of high initial amino acid (AA) supplementation in parenteral nutrition. Objective We sought to evaluate the influence of AA intake on refeeding syndrome–like electrolyte disturbances including hypophosphatemia in ELBWIs. Study design Medical records of 142 ELBWIs were reviewed. Demographic, nutritional, outcome, and electrolyte data were compared between ELBWIs with initial low (1.5 g/kg/day) and high (3 g/kg/day) AA intake. Multivariate analysis was conducted to determine the odds ratio of hypophosphatemia with high AA intake and small-for-gestational-age (SGA) ELBWIs. Results The incidence of hypophosphatemia and severe hypophosphatemia increased from 51% and 8% in period I to 59% and 20% in period II, respectively (p = 0.36 and < 0.01). Specifically, SGA ELBWIs showed higher incidence of hypophosphatemia than appropriate-for-gestational age (AGA) ELBWIs in period II, whereas there was no difference in period I. For severe hypophosphatemia, SGA ELBWIs presented a 27% incidence versus a 2% incidence in AGA ELBWIs, even with low initial AA intake. Despite no difference in phosphate intake between infants with and without hypophosphatemia, serum phosphate level reached a nadir at the sixth postnatal day and gradually recovered over the second week in infants with hypophosphatemia. In multivariate analyses, the odds ratios for severe hypophosphatemia were 3.6 and 6.6 with high AA intake and SGA status, respectively, with the highest being 18.0 with combined high AA intake and SGA status. Conclusions In summary, high initial AA intake significantly increased the risk of refeeding syndrome–like electrolyte dysregulations including severe hypophosphatemia in ELBWIs. In SGA ELBWIs, the risk of electrolyte disturbance was significantly higher, even with low initial AA intake. Therefore, new tailored parenteral nutrition protocols starting with lower energy intake and a gradual increase over the first week may be warranted for application in high-risk SGA ELBWIs."
https://openalex.org/W2969701900,"Body mass index (BMI) is influenced by genetic, behavioral and environmental factors, while interactions between genetic and socioeconomic factors have been suggested. Aim of the study was to investigate whether socioeconomic position (SEP) interacts with a BMI-related genetic sum score (GRSBMI) to affect BMI in a population-based cohort. SEP-related health behaviors and a GRS associated with educational attainment (GRSEdu) were included in the analysis to explore potential interactions underlying the GRSBMIxSEP effect. Baseline information on SEP indicators (education, income), BMI, smoking, physical activity, alcohol consumption and genetic risk factors were available for 4,493 participants of the Heinz Nixdorf Recall Study. Interaction analysis was based on linear regression as well as on stratified analyses. In SEP-stratified analyses, the highest genetic effects were observed in the lowest educational group with a 0.24 kg/m2 higher BMI (95%CI: 0.16; 0.31) and in the lowest income quartile with a 0.14 kg/m2 higher BMI (95%CI: 0.09; 0.18) per additional risk allele. Indication for a GRSBMIxSEP interaction was observed for education (ßGRSbmixeducation = -0.02 [95%CI:-0.03; -0.01]) and income (ßGRSbmixincome = -0.05 [95%CI: -0.08; -0.02]). When adjusting for interactions with the GRSEdu and SEP-related health behaviors, effect size estimates of the GRSBMIxSEP interaction remained virtually unchanged. Results gave indication for an interaction of BMI-related genetic risk factors with SEP indicators, showing substantially stronger genetic effects in low SEP groups. This supports the hypothesis that expression of genetic risks is higher in socioeconomically disadvantaged environments. No indication was observed that the GRSBMIxSEP interaction was affected by other SEP-related factors included in the analysis."
https://openalex.org/W2969774456,"Objectives This study aimed to measure the prevalence and associated factors of Intimate Partner Violence (IPV) among women living with and without HIV in Wolaita Zone, Southern Ethiopia. Methods A comparative cross-sectional study design was used to interview the 816 women between 18–49 years of age (408 = HIV positive, 408 = HIV negative). Using a multistage sampling technique, participants were recruited from nine health facilities based on probability proportional to the number of clients. After data entry (EpiData version 4.4.2.0) the data were exported to STATA/SE 15 software. Binary and multivariable logistic regression analysis were undertaken and the odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) are presented. Results The lifetime prevalence of IPV among all women was 59.7%, [95% CI: 56.31%-63.05%]. IPV was slightly higher among women living with HIV, 250(61.3%), than those who were HIV negative, 238(58.1%). Lifetime prevalence of emotional violence 413(50.6%), physical violence 349(42.8%), sexual violence 219(26.8%), and controlling behaviours by husbands/partners 489(59.9%) were reported. Associations were found between IPV and controlling behaviour of husband/partner [AOR = 8.13; 95% CI: 4.93–13.42],income [AOR = 3.97; 95% CI:1.81–8.72], bride price payment [AOR = 3.46; 95% CI:1.74–6.87], women’s decision to refuse sex [AOR = 2.99; 95% CI: 1.39–6.41],age group of women [AOR = 2.86; 95% CI:1.67–4.90], partner’s family choosing wife [AOR = 2.83; 95% CI:1.70–4.69], alcohol consumption by partner [AOR = 2.36;95% CI:1.36–4.10], number of sexual partners [AOR = 2.35; 95% CI:1.36–4.09], and if partner ever physically fought with another man [AOR = 1.83; 95% CI:1.05–3.19]. Conclusions There is a high prevalence of IPV against women both living with and without HIV. Policy priorities should therefore involve males in programs of gender-based violence prevention in order to change their violent behaviour, and interventions are required to improve the economic status of women. Both sexes should be advised to have a single partner and marriage arrangements should be by mutual consent rather than being made by parents."
https://openalex.org/W2969796003,"Background Fusion genes result from genomic structural changes, which can lead to alterations in gene expression that supports tumor development. The aim of the study was to use fusion genes as a tool to identify new breast cancer (BC) genes with a role in BC progression. Methods Fusion genes from breast tumors and BC cell lines were collected from publications. RNA-Seq data from tumors and cell lines were retrieved from databanks and analyzed for fusions with SOAPfuse or the analysis was purchased. Fusion genes identified in both tumors (n = 1724) and cell lines (n = 45) were confirmed by qRT-PCR and sequencing. Their individual genes were ranked by selection criteria that included correlation of their mRNA level with copy number. The expression of the top ranked gene was measured by qRT-PCR in normal tissue and in breast tumors from an exploratory cohort (n = 141) and a validation cohort (n = 277). Expression levels were correlated with clinical and pathological factors as well as the patients’ survival. The results were followed up in BC cohorts from TCGA (n = 818) and METABRIC (n = 2509). Results Vacuole membrane protein 1 (VMP1) was the most promising candidate based on specific selection criteria. Its expression was higher in breast tumor tissue than normal tissue (p = 1x10-4), and its expression was significantly higher in HER2 positive than HER2 negative breast tumors in all four cohorts analyzed. High expression of VMP1 associated with breast cancer specific survival (BCSS) in cohort 1 (hazard ratio (HR) = 2.31, CI 1.27–4.18) and METABRIC (HR = 1.26, CI 1.02–1.57), and also after adjusting for HER2 expression in cohort 1 (HR = 2.03, CI 1.10–3.72). BCSS was not significant in cohort 2 or TCGA cohort, which may be due to differences in treatment regimens. Conclusions The results suggest that high VMP1 expression is a potential marker of poor prognosis in HER2 positive BC. Further studies are needed to elucidate how VMP1 could affect pathways supportive of tumorigenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2969566204,"Many neuroimaging and electrophysiology studies have suggested that semantic integration as a high-level cognitive process involves various cortical regions and is modulated by attention. However, the cortical network specific to semantic integration and the modulatory mechanism of attention remain unclear. Here, we designed an fMRI experiment using “bimodal stimulus” to extract information regarding the cortical activation related to the effects of semantic integration with and without attention, and then analyzed the characteristics of the cortical network and the modulating effect of attention on semantic integration. To further investigate the related cortical regions, we constructed a functional brain network for processing attended AV stimuli to evaluate the nodal properties using a graph-based method. The results of the fMRI and graph-based analyses showed that the semantic integration with attention activated the anterior temporal lobe (ATL), temporoparietal junction (TPJ), and frontoparietal cortex, with the ATL showing the highest nodal degree and efficiency; in contrast, semantic integration without attention involved a relatively small cortical network, including the posterior superior temporal gyrus (STG), Heschl’s gyrus (HG), and precentral gyrus. These results indicated that semantic integration is a complex cognitive process that occurs not only in the attended condition but also in the unattended condition, and that attention could modulate the distribution of cortical networks related to semantic integration. We suggest that semantic integration with attention is a conscious process and needs a wide cortical network working together, in which the ATL plays the role of a central hub; in contrast, semantic integration without attention is a pre-attentive process and involves a relatively smaller cortical network, in which the HG may play an important role. Our study will provide valuable insights into semantic integration and will be useful for investigations on multisensory integration and attention mechanism at multiple processing stages and levels within the cortical hierarchy."
https://openalex.org/W2969397948,"GNA2091 is one of the components of the 4-component meningococcal serogroup B vaccine (4CMenB) vaccine and is highly conserved in all meningococcal strains. However, its functional role has not been fully characterized. Here we show that nmb2091 is part of an operon and is cotranscribed with the nmb2089, nmb2090, and nmb2092 adjacent genes, and a similar but reduced operon arrangement is conserved in many other gram-negative bacteria. Deletion of the nmb2091 gene causes an aggregative phenotype with a mild defect in cell separation; differences in the outer membrane composition and phospholipid profile, in particular in the phosphoethanolamine levels; an increased level of outer membrane vesicles; and deregulation of the zinc-responsive genes such as znuD. Finally, the ∆2091 strain is attenuated with respect to the wild-type strain in competitive index experiments in the infant rat model of meningococcal infection. Altogether these data suggest that GNA2091 plays important roles in outer membrane architecture, biogenesis, homeostasis, and in meningococcal survival in vivo, and a model for its role is discussed. These findings highlight the importance of GNA2091 as a vaccine component.-Seib, K. L., Haag, A. F., Oriente, F., Fantappiè, L., Borghi, S., Semchenko, E. A., Schulz, B. L., Ferlicca, F., Taddei, A. R., Giuliani, M. M., Pizza, M., Delany, I. The meningococcal vaccine antigen GNA2091 is an analogue of YraP and plays key roles in outer membrane stability and virulence."
https://openalex.org/W2969603034,"The aim of this study was to investigate the pollen morphology and the ranges of intraspecific and interindividual variability of the North American steeplebush—Spiraea tomentosa L., an invasive species in Poland. Steeplebush inflorescences were collected randomly from 30 localities of S. tomentosa in Poland. In total, 900 pollen grains were analysed with both a light and a scanning electron microscope. Nine quantitative and three qualitative pollen features were studied. The diagnostic features were: exine ornamentation (size and direction of the muri), operculum and perforation size. For the first time, the intraspecific and interindividual variability of the pollen grains of the highly invasive S. tomentosa were investigated. Pollen grain features were so similar, that they did not allow to differentiate individual samples of S. tomentosa and only groups of samples were recognized."
https://openalex.org/W2969730096,"Craniosynostosis is the premature fusion of the sutures of the calvaria and is principally designated as being either syndromic (demonstrating characteristic extracranial malformations) or non-syndromic. While many forms of syndromic craniosynostosis are known to be caused by specific mutations, the genetic etiology of non-syndromic, single-suture craniosynostosis (SSC) is poorly understood. Based on the low recurrence rate (4–7%) and the fact that recurrent mutations have not been identified for most cases of SSC, we propose that some cases of isolated, single suture craniosynostosis may be polygenic. Previous work in our lab identified a disproportionately high number of rare and novel gain-of-function IGF1R variants in patients with SSC as compared to controls. Building upon this result, we used expression array data from calvarial osteoblasts isolated from infants with and without SSC to ascertain correlations between high IGF1 expression and expression of other osteogenic genes of interest. We identified a positive correlation between increased expression of IGF1 and RUNX2, a gene known to cause SSC with increased gene dosage. Subsequent phosphorylation assays revealed that osteoblast cell lines from cases with high IGF1 expression demonstrated inhibition of GSK3β, a serine/threonine kinase known to inhibit RUNX2, thus activating osteogenesis through the IRS1-mediated Akt pathway. With these findings, we have utilized established mouse strains to examine a novel model of polygenic inheritance (a phenotype influenced by more than one gene) of SSC. Compound heterozygous mice with selective disinhibition of RUNX2 and either overexpression of IGF1 or loss of function of GSK3β demonstrated an increase in the frequency and severity of synostosis as compared to mice with the RUNX2 disinhibition alone. These polygenic mouse models reinforce, in-vivo, that the combination of activation of the IGF1 pathway and disinhibition of the RUNX2 pathway leads to an increased risk of developing craniosynostosis and serves as a model of human SSC."
https://openalex.org/W2969876676,"Interaural time differences (ITD) and interaural level differences (ILD) are physical cues that enable the auditory system to pinpoint the position of a sound source in space. This ability is crucial for animal communication and predator-prey interactions. The barn owl has evolved an exceptional sense of hearing and shows abilities of sound localisation that outperform most other species. So far, behavioural studies in the barn owl often used reflexive responses to investigate aspects of sound localisation. Furthermore, they predominately probed the higher frequencies of the owl’s hearing range (> 3 kHz). In the present study we used a Go/NoGo paradigm to measure the barn owl’s behavioural sound localisation acuity (expressed as the Minimum Audible Angle, MAA) as a function of stimulus type (narrow-band noise centred at 500, 1000, 2000, 4000 and 8000 Hz, and broad-band noise) and sound source position. We found significant effects of both stimulus type and sound source position on the barn owls’ MAA. The MAA improved with increasing stimulus frequency, from 14° at 500 Hz to 6° at 8000 Hz. The smallest MAA of 4° was found for broadband noise stimuli. Comparing different sound source positions revealed smaller MAAs for frontal compared to lateral stimulus presentation, irrespective of stimulus type. These results are consistent with both the known variations in physical ITDs and variation in the width of neural ITD tuning curves with azimuth and frequency. Physical and neural characteristics combine to result in better spatial acuity for frontal compared to lateral sounds and reduced localisation acuity at lower frequencies."
https://openalex.org/W2969913965,"Background South Asians have a low prevalence of atrial fibrillation (AF) in comparison with White Europeans despite a higher burden of hypertension, diabetes mellitus and coronary artery disease. The reason for this disparity is unclear but may relate to electrophysiological or structural differences within the atria or variations in autonomic function. We aimed to assess these areas using a range of non-invasive cardiac investigations. Methods A prospective cohort study was performed on 200 South Asian and 200 Caucasian healthy volunteers aged 18–40 years. All subjects underwent electrocardiography (ECG), echocardiography and anthropometric measurements. Eighty subjects in each cohort underwent 24 hour ambulatory ECG and fifty subjects in each cohort underwent exercise testing. Results Compared with White Europeans, South Asians were of a smaller height with lower lean body mass and smaller left atrial size. They had reduced P wave dispersion and P wave terminal force in lead V1. South Asians had a lower burden of supraventricular ectopy. They had a higher mean heart rate and South Asian males had lower heart rate variability, suggestive of sympathetic predominance. Exercise capacity was lower in South Asians. Conclusions South Asians have differences in left atrial size, P wave indices, burden of supraventricular ectopy, heart rate, heart rate variability and anthropometric measurements. These differences may relate to variations in atrial morphology, atrial electrophysiology and autonomic function and might help to explain why South Asians are less susceptible to developing AF."
https://openalex.org/W2969514463,"Detections of invasive species outbreaks are often followed by the removal of susceptible host organisms in order to slow the spread of the invading pest population. We propose the acceptance sampling approach for detection and optional removal of susceptible host trees to manage an outbreak of the emerald ash borer (EAB), a highly destructive forest pest, in Winnipeg, Canada. We compare the strategy with two common delimiting survey techniques that do not consider follow-up management actions such as host removal. Our results show that the management objective influences the survey strategy. The survey-only strategies maximized the capacity to detect new infestations and prioritized sites with high likelihood of being invaded. Comparatively, the surveys with subsequent host removal actions allocated most of the budget to sites where complete host removal would minimize the pest’s ability to spread to uninvaded locations. Uncertainty about the pest’s spread causes the host removal measures to cover a larger area in a uniform spatial pattern and extend to farther distances from already infested sites. If a decision maker is ambiguity-averse and strives to avoid the worst-case damages from the invasion, the optimal strategy is to survey more sites with high host densities and remove trees from sites at farther distances, where EAB arrivals may be uncertain, but could cause significant damage if not detected quickly. Accounting for the uncertainty about spread helps develop a more robust pest management strategy. The approach is generalizable and can support management programs for new pest incursions."
https://openalex.org/W2969621027,"As the traditional IC design migrates to three-dimensional integrated circuits (3D-ICs) design, new challenges need to be considered carefully to solve its reliability and yield issues. 3D-ICs using through-silicon-vias (TSVs) can have latent defects such as resistive open and bridge defects, which are caused by the thermal stress during the fabrication process. These latent defects lead to the deterioration of the electrical performance of TSVs caused by an undesired increase in the resistance-capacitance (RC) delay. For this reason, various post-bond test methodologies have been studied to improve the reliability of 3D-ICs. Cost reduction in these TSV test architectures is also currently being studied by decreasing various factors such as hardware overhead, test time, and the peak current consumption. Usually, a single test-clock-period is required to determine whether the test result contains the defective TSV. When the test result of any TSVs fails, we use another single test-clock-period to classify its defect type. In this paper, we propose a new TSV test architecture to transfer the combined test output of the test result and the specific defect type to the pad during the single test-clock-period. Our proposed test architecture also provides a reliable block-based concurrent testing to optimize the test time by dividing the die into concurrent blocks. The experimental results showed that our proposed test architecture could reduce the test time and the hardware overhead substantially by ensuring that the reasonable peak power consumption for mass production was reasonable without the test quality being adversely affected."
https://openalex.org/W2969956688,"Financial prices fluctuate as a results of the market impact of the flow of transactions between traders. Reciprocally, several studies of market microstructure have shown how decisions of individual traders or banks, implemented in their trading strategies, are affected by historical market information. However, little is known about the detailed processes of how such trading strategies at the micro level recursively affect future market information at the macro level. Using a special fined-grained dataset that allows us to track the complete trading behavior of specific banks in a U.S. dollar (USD) versus Japanese yen (JPY) market, we find that position management methods, defined as the number of units of USD bought or sold by banks against JPY, can be classified into two strategies: (1) banks increase their positions by trading in the same direction repeatedly, or (2) banks attempt to reduce their inventories by rapidly shifting their positions toward zero. We then demonstrate that their systematic position management strategies strongly influence future market prices, as demonstrated by our ability using this information to predict market prices about fifteen minutes in advance. Further, by detecting outlier trades, we reveal that traders seem to switch their strategies when they become aware of outlier trades. The evidence obtained here suggests that positions, which are a consequence of historical trading decisions based on the position management strategies of each bank, strongly influence future market prices, and we unravel how market prices at the macro level evolve through an interactive process involving the interaction between well-defined trading strategies at the micro level."
https://openalex.org/W2969235187,"Species and ecosystems usually face more than one threat. The damage caused by these multiple threats can accumulate nonlinearly: either subadditively, when the joint damage of combined threats is less than the damages of both threats individually added together, or superadditively, when the joint damage is greater than the two individual damages added together. These additivity dynamics are commonly attributed to the nature of the threatening processes, but conflicting empirical observations challenge this assumption. Here, we use a theoretical model to demonstrate that the additivity of threats can change with different magnitudes of threat impacts (effect of a threat on the population parameter, like growth rate). We use a harvested single-species population model to integrate the effects of multiple threats on equilibrium abundance. Our results reveal that threats do not always display consistent additive behavior, even in simple systems. Instead, their additivity depends on the magnitudes of the impacts of two threats, and the population parameter that is impacted by each threat. In our model specifically, when multiple threats have a low impact on the growth rate of a population, they display superadditive dynamics. In contrast, threats that impact the species’ carrying capacity are always additive or subadditive. These dynamics can be understood by reference to the curvature of the relationship between a given population parameter (e.g., growth) and equilibrium population size. Our results suggest that management actions can achieve amplified benefits if they target low-amplitude threats that affect the growth rate, since these will be in a superadditive phase. More generally, our results suggest that cumulative impact theory should focus more than previously on the magnitude of the impact on the population parameter, and should be cautious about attributing additive dynamics to particular threat combinations."
https://openalex.org/W2969621026,"The objective of this study was to describe the use of computed tomography (CT) for diagnosis of mechanical gastrointestinal (GIT) obstruction in canines and felines. Medical records of 130 canines and felines that underwent an abdominal CT scan between 2013 and 2015 at a specialty referral hospital for suspected gastrointestinal tract (GIT) obstruction were reviewed. Images were evaluated by a single board-certified radiologist for the presence of foreign material, evidence of obstruction, and location of foreign material present. Confirmation of CT findings was based on surgical exploration or medical management if surgery was not indicated. Of the 97 patients that met the inclusion criteria, 48 (49.48%) had evidence of foreign material present within the GIT and 49 (50.52%) did not. Forty-one patients had evidence of mechanical gastrointestinal obstruction. Thirty-nine of these patients had an obstruction due to foreign material; one had an intussusception with no foreign material, and another had obstruction secondary to mucosal thickening. Forty-five patients underwent exploratory laparotomy, and CT findings were confirmed in all patients. The presence of a GIT obstruction was confirmed intra-operatively in 37 patients and lack of obstruction was confirmed in the remaining eight. Non-surgical medical management was pursued for the remaining patients. Based on follow-up client interviews, clinical signs resolved in all of these patients. In conclusion, computed tomography appears to be useful for the diagnosis of GIT obstruction in canines and felines and is a helpful tool for guiding the recommendation for surgical intervention."
https://openalex.org/W2969972219,"Patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI) are frequently diagnosed with depression. Together, these two leading causes of death and disability significantly contribute to the global burden of healthcare costs. However, there are no drug treatments for TBI and antidepressants are considered off-label for depression in patients with TBI. In molecular profiling studies of rat hippocampus after experimental TBI, we found that TBI altered the expression of a subset of small, non-coding, microRNAs (miRNAs). One known neuroprotective compound (17β-estradiol, E2), and two experimental neuroprotective compounds (JM6 and PMI-006), reversed the effects of TBI on miRNAs. Subsequent in silico analyses revealed that the injury-altered miRNAs were predicted to regulate genes involved in depression. Thus, we hypothesized that drug-induced miRNA profiles can be used to identify compounds with antidepressant properties. To confirm this hypothesis, we examined miRNA expression in hippocampi of injured rats treated with one of three known antidepressants (imipramine, fluoxetine and sertraline). Bioinformatic analyses revealed that TBI, potentially via its effects on multiple regulatory miRNAs, dysregulated transcriptional networks involved in neuroplasticity, neurogenesis, and circadian rhythms- networks known to adversely affect mood, cognition and memory. As did E2, JM6, and PMI-006, all three antidepressants reversed the effects of TBI on multiple injury-altered miRNAs. Furthermore, JM6 reduced TBI-induced inflammation in the hippocampus and depression-like behavior in the forced swim test; these are both properties of classic antidepressant drugs. Our results support the hypothesis that miRNA expression signatures can identify neuroprotective and antidepressant properties of novel compounds and that there is substantial overlap between neuroprotection and antidepressant properties."
https://openalex.org/W2969229784,"The 4 component meningococcus B vaccine (4CMenB) vaccine is the first vaccine containing recombinant proteins licensed for the prevention of invasive meningococcal disease caused by meningococcal serogroup B strains. 4CMenB contains 3 main recombinant proteins, including the Neisseria meningitidis factor H binding protein (fHbp), a lipoprotein able to bind the human factor H. To date, over 1000 aa sequences of fHbp have been identified, and they can be divided into variant groups 1, 2, and 3, which are usually not crossprotective. Nevertheless, previous characterizations of a small set (n = 10) of mAbs generated in humans after 4CMenB immunization revealed 2 human Fabs (huFabs) (1A12, 1G3) with some crossreactivity for variants 1, 2, and 3. This unexpected result prompted us to examine a much larger set of human mAbs (n = 110), with the aim of better understanding the extent and nature of crossreactive anti-fHbp antibodies. In this study, we report an analysis of the human antibody response to fHbp, by the characterization of 110 huFabs collected from 3 adult vaccinees during a 6-mo study. Although the 4CMenB vaccine contains fHbp variant 1, 13 huFabs were also found to be crossreactive with variants 2 and 3. The crystal structure of the crossreactive huFab 1E6 in complex with fHbp variant 3 was determined, revealing a novel, highly conserved epitope distinct from the epitopes recognized by 1A12 or 1G3. Further, functional characterization shows that human mAb 1E6 is able to elicit rabbit, but not human, complement-mediated bactericidal activity against meningococci displaying fHbp from any of the 3 different variant groups. This functional and structural information about the human antibody response upon 4CMenB immunization contributes to further unraveling the immunogenic properties of fHbp.

A multivariate-adjusted model indicated that a low birth weight (LBW <2,000 g), a congenital anomaly, and exposure to iodine contrast media (ICM) were significant predictors for dTSH (all p < 0.05). Among these 73 dTSH infants, all 5 infants with TSH levels ≥20 mU/L began levothyroxine medication, and 6 of 16 infants with v-TSH levels of 10-20 mU/L were indicated for levothyroxine, regardless of coexisting risk factors. However, only 1 of 52 infants with v-TSH levels of 6-10 mU/L who had a congenital anomaly was indicated for levothyroxine. All healthy late preterm infants, including LBW and multiple births, with v-TSH levels of 6-10 mU/L exhibited normal thyroid function.dTSH was detected in 9.0% and levothyroxine was indicated in 1.5% of infants born at GA 35-36 weeks, particularly those with a LBW, a congenital anomaly, or history of ICM exposure. Either levothyroxine or retesting is indicated for late preterm neonates with TSH levels ≥10 mU/L regardless of risk factors.

In this article, I replicate the original study's findings, I demonstrate that these findings are robust to an alternate model specification, and I then extend the analysis to additional human rights not examined by the original author. Ultimately, I find that in comparison to when the chief executive is not nationalist, when the chief executive is highly nationalist, that state is less likely to be associated with high government respect for six 'empowerment' rights (i.e. the freedoms of assembly and association, electoral self-determination, speech, foreign movement, religion, and worker's rights), and more likely to be associated with low government respect for these six empowerment rights.

Nogo-B receptor (NgBR) has been found to be involved in the regulation of vascular remodeling and angiogenesis. The present study explores the effects of NgBR in penile corpus cavernosum in rats with diabetic ED. Firstly, the ED model of Sprague Dawley rats was established. Hematoxylin-eosin staining and Masson staining were conducted to observe pathological morphology. Immunochemical assay was adopted to detect α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA), NgBR and intercellular cell adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) expression. Reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction assay and Western blot analysis were carried out for the assessment of NgBR, factors correlated to ICAM-1, including steroid receptor coactivator (SRC) and proline-rich tyrosine kinase2 (PYK2), and factors associated with apoptosis, including B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2), Bcl-2 associated protein X (Bax), caspase 3 and cleaved-caspase 3. The results found that capillaries and vascular smooth muscle cell content reduced, and NgBR and ICAM-1 were elevated in rats with diabetic ED. si-NgBR relieved ED by decreasing penile corpus cavernosum smooth muscle systolic percentage and increasing erectile time and rate, intracavernous pressure (ICP)/mean arterial pressure (MAP) and diastolic percentage, improving the pathological changes and inhibiting cavernosum cell apoptosis. si-NgBR also resulted in the down-regulation of ICAM-1 and downstream SRC and PYK2 and promoted α-SMA expression. In conclusion, si-NgBR can provide a potential therapy for diabetic ED in rats by down-regulating ICAM-1, SRC and PYK2, making it a potential therapeutic option for diabetic ED."

https://openalex.org/W2969577495,"The topological characteristics of biological networks enable us to identify the key nodes in terms of modularity. However, due to a large size of the biological networks with many hubs and functional modules across intertwined layers within the network, it often becomes difficult to accomplish the task of identifying potential key regulators. We use for the first time a generalized formalism of Hamiltonian Energy (HE) with a recursive approach. The concept, when applied to the Apoptosis Regulatory Gene Network (ARGN), helped us identify 11 Motif hubs (MHs), which influenced the network up to motif levels. The approach adopted allowed to classify MHs into 5 significant motif hubs (S-MHs) and 6 non-significant motif hubs (NS-MHs). The significant motif hubs had a higher HE value and were considered as high-active key regulators; while the non-significant motif hubs had a relatively lower HE value and were considered as low-active key regulators, in network control mechanism. Further, we compared the results of the HE analyses with the topological characterization, after subjecting to the three conditions independently: (i) removing all MHs, (ii) removing only S-MHs, and (iii) removing only NS-MHs from the ARGN. This procedure allowed us to cross-validate the role of 5 S-MHs, NFk-B1, BRCA1, CEBPB, AR, and POU2F1 as the potential key regulators. The changes in HE calculations further showed that the removal of 5 S-MHs could cause perturbation at all levels of the network, a feature not discernible by topological analysis alone."

https://openalex.org/W2969585309,"Calvin (“Cal”) Forrest Quate, a pioneer in nanoscience and inventor of new forms of microscopy, passed away on 6 July 2019. He was 95. Cal was always on the lookout for science's practical applications. His inquisitive and inventive mind led to important advances in disparate fields ranging from electron beam interactions in microwave devices to high-resolution acoustical imaging. He is best known today for his role in developing the atomic force microscope (AFM), now an indispensable nanoscience tool.

Cal was born in Baker, Nevada, on 7 December 1923 and spent his early years riding horses, herding sheep, and exploring the nearby mountains. He earned a bachelor's degree in electrical engineering from the University of Utah in 1944 and a Ph.D. in electrical engineering from Stanford University in 1950. After graduation, Cal joined Bell Labs and soon became a department head, working on microwave amplification using electron beams. He moved to the Sandia Corporation (now Sandia National Laboratories) in 1959 and was appointed vice president and director of research. Cal joined the faculty of Stanford University in 1961, where he stayed for the rest of his career.

At Stanford, Cal switched research directions and began working in the emerging field of microwave acoustics, where sound waves at megahertz and gigahertz frequencies were used for new types of signal processing devices. While doing this work, he made a key realization that the wavelength of sound in water at gigahertz frequencies can be shorter than the wavelength of light. The only problem was that sound waves at such high frequencies are extremely attenuated. To minimize the path through the water, Cal and his graduate students developed tiny acoustic lenses that could focus sound waves to a diffraction-limited submicrometer spot size. Thus, the scanning acoustic microscope was born, along with Cal's enduring passion for microscopic imaging.

Using sound waves to image materials at the microscopic level was a completely new concept. Nobody knew what to expect. D.R. joined Cal's group in 1976 and remembers the great enthusiasm Cal had for every sample that was imaged. The acoustic waves could penetrate the surface of the sample and reveal, for example, subsurface defects in semiconductors that could not be seen by optical or electron microscopes. When applied to living biological samples, the scanning acoustic microscope could reveal changes in internal viscosity, stiffness, and adhesion. In a related invention, Cal found that focused, high-frequency sound waves can eject tiny droplets of liquid. Although his first application—inkjet printing—was not a commercial success, the method is now used to precisely dispense nanoliter volumes of liquids for biological applications.

At the age of 59, Cal changed the course of his research dramatically when he learned of the scanning tunneling microscope (STM). As Cal told it, he was on a flight to London in 1982 to receive the prestigious Rank Prize in Optoelectronics when he read in Physics Today about work being done at the IBM Zurich lab using electron tunneling to form topographical images of atomic steps on gold. After accepting his prize, Cal changed his travel itinerary to visit the IBM lab, where he met future Nobel Prize–winning physicists Gerd Binnig and Heinrich Rohrer. Although the STM results were quite rudimentary at that time, Cal saw the technique's potential and returned to Stanford greatly excited. He held one of the few group meetings that any of his students can recall and announced that STM would be the new direction of the group's research. Cal's students built the first working STMs in the United States and were soon producing beautiful atomic-resolution images.

The next great leap in nanoscale imaging came in 1985, while Binnig and physicist Christoph Gerber were on sabbatical in Cal's lab. Binnig proposed that the limitation of the STM to conducting samples could be overcome by measuring tiny displacements of a sharp tip on a cantilever spring. Gerber and Binnig built the first working prototype in Cal's lab using a diamond tip glued to a piece of gold foil, which served as the cantilever. Although the first measurements were rather crude, their paper, audaciously titled “Atomic force microscope,” became one of the most highly cited papers ever published in Physical Review Letters .

Cal realized that the key to the AFM's progress was improving the cantilever. Over the next several years, his students devised myriad cantilever designs, eventually allowing atomic resolution to be achieved. The AFM has become one of the most important and versatile tools for nanoscience and now even exceeds the spatial resolution of the STM. Extensions of the force detection concept have led to important applications in molecular imaging, chemical sensing, tribology, lithography, and the sensitive measurement of magnetic, electric, and optical fields.

F.G. met Cal in 1988 and later worked at Park Scientific Instruments, a company founded by Cal's former student Sang-il Park. Cal, who was on the board of directors, would visit frequently. He would look deep into the eyes of his students and co-workers and express his confidence in them by gently saying “You can do it.” He also continued to contribute to papers late in life, once thanking F.G. for including him, adding, “I have gotten a lot of mileage from the article by showing it to people who assumed that I was over the hill.”

Outside of the laboratory, Cal had a love of outdoor adventure. His daughters remember the smell of epoxy wafting from their garage as Cal built his own whitewater kayak. In his 60s, he took up windsurfing. He especially enjoyed hiking and backpacking in the mountains and canyons of the western United States.

Cal was an inspiring figure to us and to the many students and postdocs who came through his laboratory. His love for science and engineering radiated to those he worked with. He was humble in spirit and generous in the credit he gave to students and colleagues. Cal left a rich legacy and will be deeply missed.

I was in the first year of my Ph.D., and my previous public speaking experiences had not exactly been successful. The first one, a presentation to a jury of experts for doctoral funding, had ended in a rush because it was too long; I didn't get the funding. During the second one—the defense of my master's project in front of familiar, benevolent professors—I had been unable to control my shaking voice, which gave the impression that I was about to burst into tears. Now, I was a few hours away from giving my first oral presentation at a conference, practicing the relaxation exercises I had learned for the occasion and hoping I could get through this one without incident.

> “I never would have thought I would someday be so eager to give presentations.” 

When my turn to speak finally came, I focused on time. I would have to speak fast to present all the information I had planned. Fifteen minutes later, I finally relaxed, proud of finishing on time and speaking with a steady voice. I had no idea whether the audience had learned anything, and I did not really care, because it was over.

I continued to view my talks this way until about a year later, when I made a presentation to a nonscientific audience. Their questions made it clear that they had not gotten the message I wanted to convey. Suddenly, I realized these people probably felt the same way I did after watching a disappointing presentation: The speaker was not engaged with the audience at all. And I realized that I didn't want to be that speaker. I wanted to do better.

Instead of trying to bombard the audience with as much information as possible, I began to care about what people would take away from my presentations. I sought advice, added pictures and animations to my slides, removed text, wrote a script to use as a roadmap, and rehearsed—a lot.

My efforts rapidly paid off. My audiences started to appear energized and invested in what I was saying, and their questions showed that they had learned something. My confidence grew. Receiving positive feedback from audience members inspired me to continue building my presentation skills and trying new things. Giving talks became invigorating instead of a chore.

Now, 6 years after that first conference talk, I welcome opportunities to give oral presentations. Although I still feel some stress, I enjoy each minute of my talks. I never would have thought I would someday be so eager to give presentations, but some practical tips helped me get here.

CURATE. To keep your audience tuned in, keep your presentation focused on one main message. Each slide, each word, should be carefully chosen to convey that message. You can always prepare additional slides for questions and discussion.

SHOW, DON'T WRITE. Having all your text written on your slides may make you feel more comfortable, but it doesn't help the audience. Think about what holds your attention in a presentation. Most people like hearing stories, seeing interesting findings in the forms of graphs or meaningful pictures, and being guided through a slide with thoughtful animations. We don't get much from walls of text.

PREPARE. Telling the story of your research requires preparation. Design your visuals carefully and practice your speech and transitions. Find a friendly audience for rehearsals to discover what works and what doesn't. Being well prepared means you will have the time to tell your story, and that will help to reduce stress considerably.

LEARN FROM OTHERS, BUT FIND YOUR OWN STYLE. Take inspiration from the presentations you like to improve your style, experimenting with new approaches to the extent you feel comfortable. When you want to try something new, rehearse with supervisors or colleagues and ask for feedback.

Successful presentations aren't just a matter of talent. Most good speakers work hard to prepare talks that stand out. No matter how uncomfortable you may feel at a lectern, you can stand out by working on your presentation skills, too.
