https://openalex.org/W1971082641,"Mitochondrial number and function are altered in response to external stimuli in eukaryotes. While several transcription/replication factors directly regulate mitochondrial genes, the coordination of these factors into a program responsive to the environment is not understood. We show here that PGC-1, a cold-inducible coactivator of nuclear receptors, stimulates mitochondrial biogenesis and respiration in muscle cells through an induction of uncoupling protein 2 (UCP-2) and through regulation of the nuclear respiratory factors (NRFs). PGC-1 stimulates a powerful induction of NRF-1 and NRF-2 gene expression; in addition, PGC-1 binds to and coactivates the transcriptional function of NRF-1 on the promoter for mitochondrial transcription factor A (mtTFA), a direct regulator of mitochondrial DNA replication/transcription. These data elucidate a pathway that directly links external physiological stimuli to the regulation of mitochondrial biogenesis and function."

The switches were read by monitoring current flow at reducing voltages. In the “closed” state, current flow was dominated by resonant tunneling through the electronic states of the molecules. The switches were irreversibly opened by applying an oxidizing voltage across the device. Several devices were configured together to produce AND and OR logic gates. The high and low current levels of those gates were separated by factors of 15 and 30, respectively, which is a significant enhancement over that expected for wired-logic gates."
https://openalex.org/W2067564880,"Graft versus host disease, an alloimmune attack on host tissues mounted by donor T cells, is the most important toxicity of allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. The mechanism by which allogeneic T cells are initially stimulated is unknown. In a murine allogeneic bone marrow transplantation model it was found that, despite the presence of numerous donor antigen-presenting cells, only host-derived antigen-presenting cells initiated graft versus host disease. Thus, strategies for preventing graft versus host disease could be developed that are based on inactivating host antigen-presenting cells. Such strategies could expand the safety and application of allogeneic bone marrow transplantation in treatment of common genetic and neoplastic diseases."
https://openalex.org/W1994172606,"Rim protein (RmP) is an ABC transporter of unknown function in rod outer segment discs. The human gene for RmP (ABCR) is affected in several recessive retinal degenerations. Here, we characterize the ocular phenotype in abcr knockout mice. Mice lacking RmP show delayed dark adaptation, increased all-trans-retinaldehyde (all-trans-RAL) following light exposure, elevated phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) in outer segments, accumulation of the protonated Schiff base complex of all-trans-RAL and PE (N-retinylidene-PE), and striking deposition of a major lipofuscin fluorophore (A2-E) in retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). These data suggest that RmP functions as an outwardly directed flippase for N-retinylidene-PE. Delayed dark adaptation is likely due to accumulation in discs of the noncovalent complex between opsin and all-trans-RAL. Finally, ABCR-mediated retinal degeneration may result from “poisoning” of the RPE due to A2-E accumulation, with secondary photoreceptor degeneration due to loss of the RPE support role."
https://openalex.org/W2038197766,"A vertebrate securin (vSecurin) was identified on the basis of its biochemical analogy to the Pds1p protein of budding yeast and the Cut2p protein of fission yeast. The vSecurin protein bound to a vertebrate homolog of yeast separins Esp1p and Cut1p and was degraded by proteolysis mediated by an anaphase-promoting complex in a manner dependent on a destruction motif. Furthermore, expression of a stable Xenopus securin mutant protein blocked sister-chromatid separation but did not block the embryonic cell cycle. The vSecurin proteins share extensive sequence similarity with each other but show no sequence similarity to either of their yeast counterparts. Human securin is identical to the product of the gene called pituitary tumor-transforming gene ( PTTG ), which is overexpressed in some tumors and exhibits transforming activity in NIH 3T3 cells. The oncogenic nature of increased expression of vSecurin may result from chromosome gain or loss, produced by errors in chromatid separation."
https://openalex.org/W2087172939,"The Polycomb group (PcG) genes are required for maintenance of homeotic gene repression during development. Mutations in these genes can be suppressed by mutations in genes of the SWI/SNF family. We have purified a complex, termed PRC1 (Polycomb repressive complex 1), that contains the products of the PcG genes Polycomb, Posterior sex combs, polyhomeotic, Sex combs on midleg, and several other proteins. Preincubation of PRC1 with nucleosomal arrays blocked the ability of these arrays to be remodeled by SWI/SNF. Addition of PRC1 to arrays at the same time as SWI/SNF did not block remodeling. Thus, PRC1 and SWI/SNF might compete with each other for the nucleosomal template. Several different types of repressive complexes, including deacetylases, interact with histone tails. In contrast, PRC1 was active on nucleosomal arrays formed with tailless histones."
https://openalex.org/W2152401699,"We show that Nras is transiently localized in the Golgi prior to the plasma membrane (PM). Moreover, green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged Nras illuminated motile, peri-Golgi vesicles, and prolonged BFA treatment blocked PM expression. GFP-Hras colocalized with GFP-Nras, but GFP-Kras4B revealed less Golgi and no vesicular fluorescence. Whereas a secondary membrane targeting signal was required for PM expression, the CAAX motif alone was necessary and sufficient to target proteins to the endomembrane where they were methylated, a modification required for efficient membrane association. Thus, prenylated CAAX proteins do not associate directly with the PM but instead associate with the endomembrane and are subsequently transported to the PM, a process that requires a secondary targeting motif."
https://openalex.org/W2010442490,"A multisubunit complex, called cohesin, containing Smc1p, Smc3p, Scc1p, and Scc3p, is required for sister chromatid cohesion in mitotic cells. We show here that Smc3p and a meiotic version of Scc1p called Rec8p are required for cohesion between sister chromatids, for formation of axial elements, for reciprocal recombination, and for preventing hyperresection of double-strand breaks during meiosis. Both Rec8p and Smc3p colocalize with chromosome cores independently of synapsis during prophase I and largely disappear from chromosome arms after pachytene but persist in the neighborhood of centromeres until the onset of anaphase II. The eukaryotic cell's cohesion apparatus is required both for the repair of recombinogenic lesions and for chromosome segregation and therefore appears to lie at the heart of the meiotic process."

https://openalex.org/W1973824065,"All known Rift Valley fever virus outbreaks in East Africa from 1950 to May 1998, and probably earlier, followed periods of abnormally high rainfall. Analysis of this record and Pacific and Indian Ocean sea surface temperature anomalies, coupled with satellite normalized difference vegetation index data, shows that prediction of Rift Valley fever outbreaks may be made up to 5 months in advance of outbreaks in East Africa. Concurrent near–real-time monitoring with satellite normalized difference vegetation data may identify actual affected areas."
https://openalex.org/W2102054882,"Low-temperature single-molecule spectroscopic techniques were applied to a light-harvesting pigment-protein complex (LH2) from purple photosynthetic bacteria. The properties of the electronically excited states of the two circular assemblies (B800 and B850) of bacteriochlorophyll a (BChl a) pigment molecules in the individual complexes were revealed, without ensemble averaging. The results show that the excited states of the B800 ring of pigments are mainly localized on individual BChl a molecules. In contrast, the absorption of a photon by the B850 ring can be consistently described in terms of an excitation that is completely delocalized over the ring. This property may contribute to the high efficiency of energy transfer in these photosynthetic complexes."
https://openalex.org/W2151305846,"Most organisms have circadian clocks consisting of negative feedback loops of gene regulation that facilitate adaptation to cycles of light and darkness. In this study, CRYPTOCHROME (CRY), a protein involved in circadian photoperception in Drosophila , is shown to block the function of PERIOD/TIMELESS (PER/TIM) heterodimeric complexes in a light-dependent fashion. TIM degradation does not occur under these conditions; thus, TIM degradation is uncoupled from abrogation of its function by light. CRY and TIM are part of the same complex and directly interact in yeast in a light-dependent fashion. PER/TIM and CRY influence the subcellular distribution of these protein complexes, which reside primarily in the nucleus after the perception of a light signal. Thus, CRY acts as a circadian photoreceptor by directly interacting with core components of the circadian clock."

https://openalex.org/W2129465868,"Intervertebral disc disease is one of the most common musculoskeletal disorders. A number of environmental and anthropometric risk factors may contribute to it, and recent reports have suggested the importance of genetic factors as well. The COL9A2 gene, which codes for one of the polypeptide chains of collagen IX that is expressed in the intervertebral disc, was screened for sequence variations in individuals with intervertebral disc disease. The analysis identified a putative disease-causing sequence variation that converted a codon for glutamine to one for tryptophan in six out of the 157 individuals but in none of 174 controls. The tryptophan allele cosegregated with the disease phenotype in the four families studied, giving a lod score (logarithm of odds ratio) for linkage of 4.5, and subsequent linkage disequilibrium analysis conditional on linkage gave an additional lod score of 7.1."
https://openalex.org/W2090437685,"The molecular basis of adaptation is a major focus of evolutionary biology, yet the dynamic process of adaptation has been explored only piecemeal. Experimental evolution of two bacteriophage lines under strong selection led to over a dozen nucleotide changes genomewide in each replicate. At least 96 percent of the amino acid substitutions appeared to be adaptive, and half the changes in one line also occurred in the other. However, the order of these changes differed between replicates, and parallel substitutions did not reflect the changes with the largest beneficial effects or indicate a common trajectory of adaptation."
https://openalex.org/W1969963064,"We have determined the concentrations of the secretory proteins amylase and chymotrypsinogen and the membrane proteins KDELr and rBet1 in COPII- and COPI-coated pre-Golgi compartments of pancreatic cells by quantitative immunoelectron microscopy. COPII was confined to ER membrane buds and adjacent vesicles. COPI occurred on vesicular tubular clusters (VTCs), Golgi cisternae, the trans-Golgi network, and immature secretory granules. Both secretory proteins exhibited a first, significant concentration step in noncoated segments of VTC tubules and were excluded from COPI-coated tips. By contrast, KDELr and rBet1 showed a first, significant concentration in COPII-coated ER buds and vesicles and were prominently present in COPI-coated tips of VTC tubules. These data suggest an important role of VTCs in soluble cargo concentration by exclusion from COPI-coated domains."
https://openalex.org/W2016882805,"A molecular pathway leading to left-right asymmetry in the chick embryo has been described, in which FGF8 is a right determinant and Sonic Hedgehog a left determinant. Here evidence is presented that the Fgf8 and Sonic Hedgehog genes are required for left-right axis determination in the mouse embryo, but that they have different functions from those previously reported in the chick. In the mouse FGF8 is a left determinant and Sonic Hedgehog is required to prevent left determinants from being expressed on the right."
https://openalex.org/W2053279473,"We have shown previously that the βγ subunits of the heterotrimeric G proteins regulate the organization of the pericentriolarly localized Golgi stacks. In this report, evidence is presented that the downstream target of Gβγ is protein kinase D (PKD), an isoform of protein kinase C. PKD, unlike other members of this class of serine/threonine kinases, contains a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain. Our results demonstrate that Gβγ directly activates PKD by interacting with its PH domain. Inhibition of PKD activity through the use of pharmacological agents, synthetic peptide substrates, and, more specifically, the PH domain of PKD prevents Gβγ-mediated Golgi breakdown. Our findings suggest a possible mechanism by which the direct interaction of Gβγ with PKD regulates the dynamics of Golgi membranes and protein secretion."
https://openalex.org/W2106421836,"A nitric oxide (NO)/cyclic GMP (cGMP) signaling pathway is thought to play an important role in mammalian vasodilation during hypoxia. We show that Drosophila utilizes components of this pathway to respond to hypoxia. Hypoxic exposure rapidly induced exploratory behavior in larvae and arrested the cell cycle. These behavioral and cellular responses were diminished by an inhibitor of NO synthase and by a polymorphism affecting a form of cGMP-dependent protein kinase. Conversely, these responses were induced by ectopic expression of NO synthase. Perturbing components of the NO/cGMP pathway altered both tracheal development and survival during prolonged hypoxia. These results indicate that NO and protein kinase G contribute to Drosophila's ability to respond to oxygen deprivation."

https://openalex.org/W2074733164,"Although polymorphic inversions in Drosophila are very common, the origin of these chromosomal rearrangements is unclear. The breakpoints of the cosmopolitan inversion 2j of D. buzzatii were cloned and sequenced. Both breakpoints contain large insertions corresponding to a transposable element. It appears that the two pairs of target site duplications generated upon insertion were exchanged during the inversion event, and that the inversion arose by ectopic recombination between two copies of the transposon that were in opposite orientations. This is apparently the mechanism by which transposable elements generate natural inversions in Drosophila."
https://openalex.org/W2067347790,"A phytochrome-like protein called Ppr was discovered in the purple photosynthetic bacterium Rhodospirillum centenum . Ppr has a photoactive yellow protein (PYP) amino-terminal domain, a central domain with similarity to phytochrome, and a carboxyl-terminal histidine kinase domain. Reconstitution experiments demonstrate that Ppr covalently attaches the blue light–absorbing chromophore p -hydroxycinnamic acid and that it has a photocycle that is spectrally similar to, but kinetically slower than, that of PYP. Ppr also regulates chalcone synthase gene expression in response to blue light with autophosphorylation inhibited in vitro by blue light. Phylogenetic analysis demonstrates that R. centenum Ppr may be ancestral to cyanobacterial and plant phytochromes."
https://openalex.org/W2071946819,"Rac1 and RhoA regulate membrane ruffling and stress fiber formation. Both molecules appear to exert their control from the plasma membrane. In fibroblasts stimulated with platelet-derived growth factor or lysophosphatidic acid, the reorganization of the cytoskeleton begins at specific sites on the cell surface. We now report that endogenous Rac1 and RhoA also have a polarized distribution at the cell surface. Cell fractionation and immunogold labeling show that in quiescent fibroblasts both of these molecules are concentrated in caveolae, which are plasma membrane domains that are associated with actin-rich regions of the cell. Treatment of these cells with platelet-derived growth factor stimulated the recruitment of additional Rac1 and RhoA to caveolae fractions, while lysophosphatidic acid only caused the recruitment of RhoA. We could reconstitute the recruitment of RhoA using either whole cell lysates or purified caveolae. Surprisingly, pretreatment of the lysates with exoenzyme C3 shifted both resident and recruited RhoA from caveolae to noncaveolae membranes. The shift in location was not caused by inactivation of the RhoA effector domain. Moreover, chimeric proteins containing the C-terminal consensus site for Rac1 and RhoA prenylation were constitutively targeted to caveolae fractions. These results suggest that the polarized distribution of Rho family proteins at the cell surface involves an initial targeting of the protein to caveolae and a mechanism for retaining it at this site.

These results suggest that the polarized distribution of Rho family proteins at the cell surface involves an initial targeting of the protein to caveolae and a mechanism for retaining it at this site. The Rho family of small GTPases, which include Rac1, Cdc42, and RhoA, regulate the rearrangement of actin cytoskeleton when cells are exposed to growth factors and cytokines (1Hall A. Science. 1998; 279: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5230) Google Scholar). A remarkable feature of these proteins is the ability of each family member to control a specific organizational state of the actin cytoskeleton in response to a common stimulus. For example, stimulation of fibroblasts with epidermal growth factor (EGF) 1The abbreviations used are: EGF, epidermal growth factor; PDGF, platelet-derived growth factor; LPA, lysophosphatidic acid; pAb, polyclonal antibody; mAb, monoclonal antibody; PVDF, polyvinylidene difluoride; EGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate or platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) activates Ras, Rac1, and then RhoA, suggesting that a G-protein cascade might be involved (2Ridley A.J. Paterson H.F. Johnston C.L. Diekmann D. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 401-410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3084) Google Scholar, 3Ridley A.J. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 389-399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3843) Google Scholar). The activated Rac1 promotes ruffling of the plasma membrane, while the activated RhoA regulates the formation of stress fibers and focal adhesion sites. Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), by contrast, activates RhoA but not Rac1, so stress fiber formation occurs but membrane ruffling does not (3Ridley A.J. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 389-399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3843) Google Scholar). Stress fiber formation is also much faster in response to LPA than PDGF, suggesting that the timing of RhoA activation is an important control point for cytoskeleton reorganization. Rho family G-proteins function as molecular switches that promote the activity of effector molecules in response to exchanging GDP for GTP. As with the Ras family of G-proteins, multiple molecular interactions regulate the nucleotide state of the Rho family members, including GDP-GTP exchange factors that facilitate GTP loading and GTPase-activating proteins that stimulate GTP hydrolysis (4Van Aelst L. D'Souza-Schorey C. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2295-2322Crossref PubMed Scopus (2101) Google Scholar). The exchange process for the Rho family members, however, has an additional layer of regulation. Most GDP-bound RhoA, and probably Rac1 (5Bokoch G.M. Bohl B.P. Chuang T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31674-31679Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Takahashi K. Sasaki T. Mammoto A.

Ohga N. Yamamoto J. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9373-9380Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Dissociation from RhoGDI is a prerequisite for nucleotide exchange, and this step correlates with translocation of Rac1 and RhoA to the plasma membrane (5Bokoch G.M. Bohl B.P. Chuang T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31674-31679Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The control of membrane recruitment may involve interactions between cytosolic ERM proteins (ezrin-radixin-moesin), transmembrane proteins containing positively charged sequences such as CD44 (8Tsukita S. Oishi K. Sato N. Sagara J. Kawai A. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 391-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (685) Google Scholar, 9Fujisawa K. Madaule P. Ishizaki T. Watanabe G. Bito H. Saito Y. Hall A.

Tsukita S. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23371-23375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). In fibroblasts stimulated with PDGF or LPA, the reorganization of the cytoskeleton begins at specific sites on the cell surface. We were interested in knowing if membrane-bound Rac1 and RhoA also exhibited a polarized distribution in these cells. We now show that in quiescent fibroblasts endogenous Rac1 and RhoA are both concentrated in caveolae, which are plasma membrane domains that are clustered in regions of the cell surface rich in actin filaments. Components of the protein machinery thought to be involved in recruiting these proteins to the cell surface were also enriched in these domains. Moreover, incubation of these cells in the presence of growth factors or cytokines that stimulate cytoskeleton reorganization caused additional amounts of both regulatory proteins to appear in caveolae. Ribosylation of RhoA, by contrast, caused it to relocate to noncaveolae membrane, suggesting that separate mechanisms exist for recruiting Rho family proteins to caveolae and for retaining them at this site.

Rat-1B cells and normal human fibroblasts were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 1 mm glutamate, 100 mg/ml penicillin, and 100 mg/ml streptomycin. Cells were grown to near confluence (3–4 days) before removing serum and incubating in the presence of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 100 mg/ml penicillin and 100 mg/ml streptomycin for 24–40 h. Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Bradford (Bio-Rad) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Samples were dissolved in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sample buffer (62 mm Tris, pH 8, 0.5% (w/v) SDS, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 0.05% (w/v) bromphenol blue), loaded on a 4% stacking gel, and separated using a 5–17% linear gradient gel. Proteins were transferred to PVDF membrane by electrophoretic transfer at 50 V for 2 h on ice. After transfer, immunoblotting was performed by standard techniques. The membranes were dried using methanol, washed briefly with water, and then incubated with primary antibodies (Cav-1 pAb, 0.06 μg/ml; Rac1 pAb, 0.2 μg/ml; RhoA mAb, 0.2 μg/ml; Raf-1 mAb, 0.5 μg/ml; CD44 mAb, 0.1 μg/ml; moesin mAb, 0.5 μg/ml; ezrin mAb, 0.05 μg/ml) diluted in buffer A (20 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 137 mm NaCl) plus 1% nonfat dry milk for 1 h at room temperature. Membranes were then washed with buffer A plus 0.2% milk once for 15 min and twice for 5 min at room temperature. The membranes were incubated with the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-Ig antibody (0.1 μg/ml) in buffer A plus 1% milk for 1 h. The membranes were then washed 1 × 15 min and 4 × 5 min with buffer A containing 0.2% milk. Staining was detected using enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL). Apparent molecular masses were estimated using prestained molecular weight markers (broad range Rainbow). Two methods were used to prepare cell lysates. In method 1, cells were washed in ice-cold buffer B (20 mm Tricine, pH 7.8, 1 mm EDTA, and 250 mm sucrose) and collected by scraping in the same buffer. Cells were lysed by a Dounce homogenizer in buffer B in the presence of 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 1 μg/ml benzamidine, and 100 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. A postnuclear supernatant fraction was prepared by spinning the lysate at 900 ×g for 10 min. In method 2, cells were washed twice in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, scraped in buffer C (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mmMgCl2, 2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mmNaVO4, 10 mm NaPPi, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml benzamidine, and 100 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), collected by centrifugation, and resuspended in buffer C. Cells were then lysed by passage through a 27-gauge needle five times. Caveolae were isolated by the method of Smart et al. (10Smart E.J. Ying Y.S. Mineo C. Anderson R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10104-10108Crossref PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar). Cell lysates were prepared by the indicated method and layered over 23 ml of ice-cold 30% Percoll in buffer D (20 mm Tricine, pH 7.8, 1 mm EDTA) plus 250 mm sucrose. After centrifugation at 85,000 ×g for 30 min, the cytosol and plasma membrane fractions were collected. The plasma membrane fraction was briefly sonicated (6 × 50-J bursts at 10 watts each), mixed with buffer E (50% (w/v) iodixanol in buffer D plus 40 mm sucrose) to a final iodixanol concentration of 23%, and overlaid with a 6-ml, linear (10–20%) gradient of iodixanol in buffer D containing 250 mm sucrose. Samples were centrifuged at 53,000 ×g for 90 min. The bottom 3 ml of the gradient was pooled and designated noncaveolae membrane. The top 5 ml of the gradient was mixed with 4 ml of buffer E, overlaid with 1 ml of 15% (w/v) iodixanol in buffer D containing 250 mm sucrose followed by 0.5 ml of 5% (w/v) iodixanol in buffer D containing 250 mm sucrose. The gradients were centrifuged at 53,000 × g for 90 min, and caveolae fractions were collected from the 5/15% interface (0.5 ml). Two methods for analyzing RhoA recruitment were used. In the first method, cell lysates were prepared from 50 100-mm dishes of serum-starved Rat-1B fibroblasts using method 2. The lysates were divided into 1-ml portions and incubated separately in the presence of 1 mm GDP, 1 mm GTP, 100 μm GTPγS, or no nucleotide for 30 min at the indicated temperature. In some cases, these mixtures were incubated in the presence or absence of exoenzyme C3 (5 μg/ml) plus 130 μm NADH for 10 min at 30 °C prior to the addition of nucleotide. Cytosol and caveolae fractions were then prepared by standard methods. In the second method, cytosol, plasma membrane, noncaveolae membrane, and caveolae were isolated from cell lysates prepared by method 2. Cytosol (250 μg) was mixed with 10 μg of purified plasma membrane, noncaveolae membrane, or caveolae in buffer C. These mixtures were incubated in the presence or absence of exoenzyme C3 (5 μg/ml) for 10 min at 30 °C followed by the addition of either 1 mm GTP or 100 μm GTPγS and incubated an additional 30 min at 30 °C. The membranes in each fraction were collected by centrifugation at 250,000 ×g for 1 h, separated by gel electrophoresis, transferred to PVDF membranes, and immunoblotted with the indicated antibodies. Plasma membranes from normal human fibroblasts were attached to poly-l-lysine-coated formvar (11Sanan D.A. Anderson R.G.W. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1991; 39: 1017-1024Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) and immunogold-labeled with antibodies to RhoA, caveolin-1, or clathrin using either a single labeling or a double labeling protocol. For single antibody labeling, membranes were incubated in the following sequence: the primary antibody (either 5 μg/ml pAb anti-caveolin-1 IgG or 15 μg/ml mAb anti-RhoA IgG) for 60 min in buffer F (phosphate-buffered saline plus 0.8% bovine serum albumin, pH 7.6), washed for 30 min with buffer F, and then gold-conjugated to either anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG for 60 min in buffer F and washed with buffer F for 30 min. For double labeling, membranes were incubated in the following sequence: the indicated first antibody (either 15 μg/ml mAb anti-RhoA IgG or mAb anti-clathrin IgG diluted 1:20) for 60 min in buffer F, washed in buffer F for 30 min, gold-conjugated to pAb anti-mouse for 60 min, washed in buffer F for 30 min; pAb anti-caveolin-1 for 60 min, washed in buffer F for 30 min, gold-conjugated pAb anti-rabbit for 30 min, and washed in buffer F for 30 min. All gold-conjugated antibodies were diluted 1:30 in buffer F. At the end of the incubations, the membranes were fixed with 2% glutaraldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.6, for 10 min followed by 1% OsO4 in phosphate-buffered saline. The membranes were stained for 10 min with 1% tannic acid and 1 min with 1% uranyl acetate. Quantification of gold labeling was carried out on these membranes by a blind observer. Caveolae were identified by their typical morphology in these images (morphology is judged by anti-caveolin-1 IgG labeling in other samples), and the number of RhoA-specific gold particles per caveolae were tabulated for the indicated treatments. Either the consensus site for prenylation (CAAX) or the CAAX box plus the adjacent polybasic region (CAAXPB) for both Rac1 and RhoA was added to the carboxyl end of enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) by ligating the appropriate coding sequences in frame to the C-terminal end of the EGFP using the multicloning site within the pEGFP C1 vector. The coding sequences for each were constructed by annealing the following sets of complementary oligonucleotides: RacCAAX, AATTCTTGCCTGCTGTTGTAAG and GTACCTTACAACAGCAGGCAAG; RacCAAXPB, AATTCTAAGAAGAGGAAGAGAAAATGCCTGCTGTTGTAAG and GTACCTTACAACAGCAGGCATTTTCTCTTCCTCTTCTTAG; RhoCAAX, AATTCTTGCCTTGTCTTGTGAG and GTACCTCACAAGACAAGGCAAG; RhoCAAXPB, AATTCTAGACGTGGGAAGAAAAAATCTGGGTGCCTTGTCTTGTGAG and GTACCTCACAAGACAAGGCACCCAGATTTTTTCTTCCCACGTCTAG. Annealing was carried out by mixing 50 pmol of both primers in 1 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl and successively incubating the mixture at 100 °C for 4 min, 50 °C for 1 h, 75 °C for 4 min, and 50 °C for 30 min followed by a slow cool down to room temperature. The linkers were then ligated into the pEGFP C1 vector using theEcoRI and Asp718I restriction sites. The indicated EGFP construct was introduced into Rat-1B cells by calcium phosphate transfection, and the cells were grown for 5 days before harvesting them for cell fractionation as described. The same transfection methods were used to express Myc-tagged mutant forms of RhoA (V14/A39) and Rac1 (L61/A37) in Rat-1 cells. The cellular distribution of Rac1 and RhoA in quiescent Rat-1B fibroblasts was determined as a base line for further investigation. Equal amounts of protein (3 μg/lane) from the postnuclear supernatant (PNS), cytosol (CYT), plasma membrane (PM), noncaveolae membrane (NCM), and caveolae membrane (CM) fractions were separated by gel electrophoresis and immunoblotted with specific antibodies (Fig.1). Relative to the plasma membrane, Rac1, RhoA, and caveolin-1 (Cav1) were highly enriched in the caveolae fraction. Rac1 and RhoA appeared to be more enriched in the caveolae fraction than in the cytosol. Using quantitative immunoblotting, we determined that Rac1 and RhoA were enriched ∼23-fold in the caveolae fraction relative to the plasma membrane. We did not detect any RhoGDI in the caveolae fraction even after loading up to 20 μg of protein in each lane (data not shown). Therefore, endogenous Rho family proteins appear to be constitutively concentrated in caveolae of quiescent fibroblasts. The absence of RhoGDI in the caveolae fraction suggests the Rac1 and RhoA in this fraction is either available for activation or already activated. To confirm that the Rho family proteins in the caveolae fraction were associated with invaginated caveolae, we used immunogold to co-localize RhoA with caveolin-1 on the inner surface of isolated plasma membranes attached to formvar grids (Fig. 2). One set of membranes from normal human fibroblasts was labeled directly with either RhoA mAb (A) or caveolin-1 pAb (C). Another set was double labeled with either RhoA mAb (5-nm gold) plus caveolin-1 pAb (15-nm gold) (B) or clathrin mAb (5-nm gold) plus caveolin-1 pAb (15-nm gold) (D). As indicated by the localization of caveolin-1 pAb gold (C, large gold particles), invaginated caveolae in these air-dried preparations appear as pear-shaped protuberances that at higher magnification (A and B, insets) seem to be outlined by a bilayer structure. Virtually all of these structures were decorated with multiple, 15-nm gold particles when the membranes were probed with anti-caveolin-1 IgG (C). Similarly, many of these same domains labeled with 5-nm gold particles when RhoA mAb was used (A, arrowheads andinset). The surrounding membranes were nearly devoid of gold particles (A and C). When the membranes were double-labeled using 5-nm (RhoA) and 15-nm (caveolin-1) gold particles, both sizes of particles were clustered in association with invaginated caveolae (B, inset). Occasional clusters of RhoA-gold that were not associated with caveolin-1 pAb gold were also seen. As a test for co-localization specificity, we co-localized clathrin (5 nm) and caveolin-1 (15 nm) using clathrin mAb and found that each was associated with their respective domains but not with each other (D). The amount of Rac1 and RhoA in the caveolae fraction changed when we stimulated cells with growth factors and cytokines (Fig.3). Immunoblots of caveolae fractions from cells incubated in the presence of PDGF for various times (PDGF) showed that the concentration of Rac1 increased within 1–3 min and remained at this level for the remainder of the incubation. RhoA, by contrast, increased much more slowly, reaching a maximum at 60 min. The rapid recruitment of Rac1 followed by a slower appearance of RhoA in the caveolae fraction matched the respective time frame for the assembly of membrane ruffles (Rac1-dependent) and stress fibers (RhoA-dependent) (2Ridley A.J. Paterson H.F. Johnston C.L. Diekmann D. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 401-410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3084) Google Scholar). When we treated cells with LPA, which stimulates stress fiber formation within 10 min but has no effect on membrane ruffling (3Ridley A.J. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 389-399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3843) Google Scholar), RhoA was rapidly recruited to the caveolae fraction (LPA, Fig. 3) while the concentration of Rac1 remained relatively unchanged. In contrast to the differential behavior of Rac1 and RhoA, both PDGF and LPA caused the same amount of Raf-1 to be recruited to the caveolae fraction, and with similar kinetics (12Mineo C. James G.L. Smart E.J. Anderson R.G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11930-11935Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). Activation of adenylyl cyclase with 10 μm forskolin, which blocks Raf-1 recruitment to caveolae (12Mineo C. James G.L. Smart E.J. Anderson R.G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11930-11935Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar), had no effect on EGF-stimulated recruitment of Rac1 and RhoA (data not shown). None of the treatments we tested had any effect on the amount of caveolin-1 in the caveolae fraction (Cav1). ERM proteins have been implicated in the membrane recruitment (6Takahashi K. Sasaki T. Mammoto A. Takaishi K. Kameyama T. Tsukita S. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23371-23375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar) and activation (13Mackay D.J. Esch F. Furthmayr H. Hall A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 927-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar) of Rho family proteins. We used immunoblotting to determine if these proteins were present in caveolae fractions (Fig.4). Both moesin and ezrin were highly enriched in fibroblast caveolae fraction compared with the plasma membrane (PM) and cytosol (CYT) fractions. Immunofluorescence also showed that caveolin-1 co-localized with both ezrin and moesin (data not shown). ERM proteins form a complex in vitro with a plasma membrane hyaluronic acid binding protein called CD44 (8Tsukita S. Oishi K. Sato N. Sagara J. Kawai A. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 391-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (685) Google Scholar). Immunoblotting showed that the 85-kDa form of CD44 is highly enriched in human fibroblast caveolae relative to noncaveolae membrane and cytosol fractions. The traffic of Rho proteins through caveolae may be necessary for their activation. Several studies have shown that GTPγS will stimulate the recruitment of Rho proteins to the membrane fraction of cell lysates (14Fleming I.N. Elliott C.M. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33067-33073Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) and induce cytoskeleton reorganization in permeabilized cells (13Mackay D.J. Esch F. Furthmayr H. Hall A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 927-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). To determine if GTPγS would stimulate the recruitment of Rho proteins to caveolae, we made cell lysates and added either GDP, GTP, GTPγS, or buffer. The lysates were then incubated at either 4 or 30 °C for 30 min (Fig. 5) before membranes were separated from cytosol and used to prepare caveolae and noncaveolae fractions. Immunoblotting either cytosol (cytosol) or caveolae (caveolae membrane) fractions showed that the basal amount of RhoA in both fractions was unaffected by either 30 °C incubation (compare lanes 1 and 2 andlanes 6 and 7), GDP (lanes 3 and 8), or GTP (lanes 4and 9). The addition of GTPγS, by contrast, caused a marked increase in the amount of RhoA in the caveolae fraction (comparelanes 6 and 10). Under the same conditions, RhoA was no longer detectable in the cytosol fraction (lane 5). Therefore, GTPγS appears to stimulate the movement of cytosolic RhoA to caveolae. The targeting was specific because we did not detect any increase in the concentration of RhoA in noncaveolae membrane (data not shown). Therefore, the caveolae fraction contains functional machinery for recruiting RhoA. To determine if the effector domain of RhoA might be involved in its localization to caveolae (Fig.6), we looked at the effects of exoenzyme C3. This enzyme ADP-ribosylates asparagine 41 in one of the two effector regions within RhoA (15Sekine A. Fujiwara M. Narumiya S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8602-8605Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and blocks its ability to control cytoskeleton reorganization (3Ridley A.J. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 389-399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3843) Google Scholar). Cell lysates were prepared and incubated in the presence or absence of C3 for 10 min at 30 °C before the addition of GDP, GTP, or GTPγS for an additional 30 min at 30 °C. The cell lysates were then fractionated into cytosol (CYT, 50 μg/lane), plasma membrane (PM, 20 μg/lane), noncaveolae membrane (NCM, 20 μg/lane), and caveolae membrane (CM, 5 μg/lane) and processed for immunoblotting. Regardless of whether or not GDP was present (comparelanes 1 and 2), immunoblots detected RhoA in the cytosol, plasma membrane, and caveolae but not the noncaveolae fractions (note that the noncaveolae lane was loaded with 4 times more protein than the caveolae lane). The addition of GTP had no effect on the amount of RhoA in any of the fractions (comparelanes 1 and 4). By contrast, GTPγS stimulated an increase in the concentration of RhoA in isolated plasma membranes (compare lanes 4 and 5). Fractionation of this membrane showed that the concentration of RhoA was specifically increased in the caveolae fraction (comparelanes 4 and 5). When we preincubated the lysate with C3 before adding GDP, the molecular weight of the cytosolic RhoA shifted (lane 3), indicating ribosylation, and the amount of RhoA in the caveolae fraction markedly declined (compare lanes 2 and 3). Unexpectedly, C3 caused RhoA to appear in the noncaveolae fraction in the presence of GTPγS instead of the caveolae fraction (comparelanes 5 and 6). The total amount of RhoA translocated to the plasma membrane was similar (comparelanes 5 and 6), consistent with the observation that C3 ADP-ribosylation does not affect nucleotide binding or exchange (15Sekine A. Fujiwara M. Narumiya S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8602-8605Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These results suggest that the effector domain plays a role in the localization of RhoA to caveolae. We used immunogold labeling to see if C3 affected the level of RhoA in invaginated caveolae (Table I). Membranes attached to a formvar grid were incubated in the presence or absence of C3 for 30 min at 30 °C. At the end of the incubation, the membranes were processed for the immunogold localization of RhoA. Samples were quantified by standard methods. In two separate experiments, we found that C3 reduced the number of gold particles per caveolae by 47 and 32%.Table IEffect of exoenzyme C3 on RhoA distributionTreatmentNo. of cellsNo. of caveolaeCaveolae GoldNo. of Gold/CaveolaDecrease%Expt. 11-aExpt., experiment.Buffer11160130521.9Exoenzyme C31519271810147Expt. 2Buffer20110219061.73Exoenzyme C320144717231.1932Plasma membranes of normal human fibroblasts were attached to formvar grids as described.

In a single blind procedure, the number of gold particles in morphological caveolae were counted on micrographs of C3 treated and untreated membranes using a constant magnification. We noted that the residual RhoA in the caveolae fraction following C3 treatment appeared not to be ribosylated (Fig. 6, lanes 3 and 6) and that C3 caused a decline in the amount of endogenous RhoA in caveolae (Fig. 6,lane 3). Since these treatments were carried out prior to sonication, the plasma membrane was intact during the C3 treatment. Thus, C3 could influence RhoA localization either by inducing recruitment of RhoA to noncaveolae membrane or by promoting the migration of RhoA from caveolae to noncaveolae membranes. To distinguish between recruitment and retention in caveolae, the recruitment"

In cells expressing HLR-5, -15, or -274, 15-25% of the leptin binding sites were located at the plasma membrane. In contrast, in cells expressing HLR-67, only 5% of the total binding sites were at the plasma membrane. Immunofluorescent microscopy showed that all four isoforms partially co-localized with calnexin and beta-COP, markers of the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi, respectively. All isoforms were also detected in an unidentified punctate compartment. All isoforms were internalized via clathrin-mediated endocytosis, but at different rates. After 20 min at 37 degrees C, 45% of a bound cohort of labeled ligand had been internalized by HLR-15, 30% by HLR-67, 25% by HLR-274, and 15% by HLR-5. Degradation of internalized leptin occurred in lysosomes. Overnight exposure to leptin down-regulated all isoforms, but to a variable extent. HLR-274 displayed the greatest down-regulation and also appeared to reach lysosomes more quickly than the other isoforms. The faster degradation of HLR-274 may help to terminate leptin signaling."

Apyrases (EC 3.6.1.5) are known as enzymes that hydrolyze both di- and triphosphate nucleotides as well as thiamine pyrophosphate. Apyrase family proteins are widely distributed in eukaryotic cells from yeast to mammals (1Plesner L. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1995; 158: 141-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar, 2Komoszynski M.

Different from ATPases that specifically hydrolyze ATP, apyrases generally hydrolyze both ATP and ADP, although the rate of ATP and ADP hydrolysis differs depending on the sources. The main products of ATP hydrolysis by apyrase are AMP and two orthophosphate anions. Apyrases can be divided into ecto-apyrases with the catalytic domain outside the cell and endo-apyrases with the catalytic site inside the cell (2Komoszynski M. Wojtczak A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1310: 233-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). It has been suggested thatecto-apyrases may participate in neurotransmission (4Edwards F.A. Gibb A.J.

FASEB J. 1993; 7: 516-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). However, less is known about the role of endo-apyrases. Although some roles of endo-apyrase have been suggested in protein glycosylation and sugar level control (3Wang T.-F. Guidotti G. J. Biol.

Acta. 1996; 1310: 233-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar).Specific oligosaccharide modification of glycoproteins in eukaryotic cells occurs mainly in the lumen of the Golgi apparatus. The substrates for these reactions are nucleotide sugars, which are synthesized in the cytosol. As shown by genetic and biochemical analysis (8Abeijon C. Yanagisawa K. Mandon E.C. Häusler A. Moreman K. Hirschberg C.B. Robbins P.W. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 307-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 9Capasso J.M. Hirschberg C.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 7051-7055Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), nucleotide sugars are imported from the cytosol to the Golgi lumen by highly specific transporters, which may also antiport the corresponding nucleoside monophosphate from the Golgi lumen to the cytosol. NDPase hydrolyzes nucleoside diphosphate to nucleoside monophosphate, which is a putative antiporter of nucleotide sugars. This allows the entry of additional nucleotide sugars from the cytosol to the Golgi lumen. Thereby, the NDPase is considered to play a critical role in the translocation of these nucleotide sugars from the cytosol into the lumen (10Hirschberg C.B. Clapham D.E. Ehrlich B.E. Transporter of Nucleotides and Nucleotide Derivatives in the Endoplasmic Reticulum and Golgi Apparatus. Rockefeller University Press, New York1996: 105-120Google Scholar).In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, mannosylation of N- and O-linked oligosaccharides is mainly regulated by a GDPase that converts GDP to GMP. GDA1, the gene for GDPase, has been cloned and found to encode a type II membrane protein (8Abeijon C. Yanagisawa K. Mandon E.C. Häusler A. Moreman K. Hirschberg C.B. Robbins P.W. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 307-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Gda1p shows a high activity toward GDP, but a low activity toward UDP and no activity toward ATP and ADP (11Yanagisawa K. Resnick D. Abeijon C. Robbins P.W. Hirschberg C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19351-19355Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Deletion of GDA1results in a marked reduction in Golgi mannosylation of proteins and lipids in vivo (8Abeijon C. Yanagisawa K. Mandon E.C. Häusler A. Moreman K. Hirschberg C.B. Robbins P.W. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 307-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) and causes a 4-fold lower rate of GDP-mannose entry into Golgi vesicles in dolichol-P-Man synthase-deficient cells (12Berninsone P. Miret J.J. Hirschberg C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 207-211Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Nevertheless, in Δgda1cells, invertase is still heavily glycosylated, and in addition, a significant amount of GMP, as well as very low residual nonspecific nucleoside phosphatase activity unrelated to Gda1p, was detected in the Golgi membranes (8Abeijon C. Yanagisawa K. Mandon E.C. Häusler A. Moreman K. Hirschberg C.B. Robbins P.W. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 307-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 12Berninsone P. Miret J.J. Hirschberg C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 207-211Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These observations suggested the importance of residual GDPase activity in the Golgi lumen of the Δgda1mutant. Another possibility could be a direct supply of GMP from GDP-mannose by mannosyl-phosphate transferase. The MNN4 gene is known to encode a positive regulator of mannosyl phosphorylation (13Odani T. Shinmma Y. Wang X.-H. Jigami Y. FEBS Lett. 1997; 420: 186-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 14Odani T. Shimma Y. Tanaka A. Jigami Y. Glycobiology. 1996; 6: 805-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), but the analysis of mannosylation of invertase in Δgda1Δmnn4 double disruptant cells showed no effect on mannosylation when compared with that in Δgda1 alone. This result strongly indicated that the remaining GMP did not arise from mannosyl phosphorylation in the Golgi lumen of Δgda1 cells and prompted us to investigate other GDPases involved in protein glycosylation. At that time, it was already known that theSaccharomyces Genome Database contains at least one homologue of Gda1p that possess ∼20% amino acid identity to Gda1p and that also belongs to the apyrase superfamily, as determined by sequence alignment (15Handa M. Guidotti G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 218: 916-923Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar).Here we report that the residual GDPase activity in the Δgda1 mutant results from this homologue of Gda1p. It turned out to be a typical apyrase that can hydrolyze not only nucleoside diphosphates, as Gda1p does, but also nucleoside triphosphates. We also demonstrate that additional expression of this yeast apyrase can complement the lack of GDPase activity of Gda1p and plays an important role in controlling the protein glycosylation in Golgi compartments. For the above reason, we named the GDA1homologue YND1 (yeast nucleosidediphosphatase) to indicate a possible redundancy between the YND1 and GDA1 genes. In this paper, we present the first direct evidence for in vivo endo-apyrase function in protein glycosylation and suggest the involvement of yeast apyrase in cell wall integrity. Apyrases (EC 3.6.1.5) are known as enzymes that hydrolyze both di- and triphosphate nucleotides as well as thiamine pyrophosphate.

FASEB J. 1993; 7: 516-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). However, less is known about the role of endo-apyrases. Although some roles of endo-apyrase have been suggested in protein glycosylation and sugar level control (3Wang T.-F. Guidotti G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11392-11399Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 6Fanta N. Anich M. Mancilla M. Kettlum A.M. Valenzuela M.A. Traverso-Cori A. Arch. Biol. Med.

Dermatol. 1993; 100: 282-287Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), there is no direct evidence for the in vivo function of endo-apyrase (2Komoszynski M. Wojtczak A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1310: 233-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Specific oligosaccharide modification of glycoproteins in eukaryotic cells occurs mainly in the lumen of the Golgi apparatus. The substrates for these reactions are nucleotide sugars, which are synthesized in the cytosol. As shown by genetic and biochemical analysis (8Abeijon C. Yanagisawa K. Mandon E.C. Häusler A. Moreman K. Hirschberg C.B. Robbins P.W. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 307-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 9Capasso J.M. Hirschberg C.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 7051-7055Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), nucleotide sugars are imported from the cytosol to the Golgi lumen by highly specific transporters, which may also antiport the corresponding nucleoside monophosphate from the Golgi lumen to the cytosol. NDPase hydrolyzes nucleoside diphosphate to nucleoside monophosphate, which is a putative antiporter of nucleotide sugars. This allows the entry of additional nucleotide sugars from the cytosol to the Golgi lumen. Thereby, the NDPase is considered to play a critical role in the translocation of these nucleotide sugars from the cytosol into the lumen (10Hirschberg C.B. Clapham D.E. Ehrlich B.E. Transporter of Nucleotides and Nucleotide Derivatives in the Endoplasmic Reticulum and Golgi Apparatus. Rockefeller University Press, New York1996: 105-120Google Scholar). In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, mannosylation of N- and O-linked oligosaccharides is mainly regulated by a GDPase that converts GDP to GMP. GDA1, the gene for GDPase, has been cloned and found to encode a type II membrane protein (8Abeijon C. Yanagisawa K. Mandon E.C. Häusler A. Moreman K. Hirschberg C.B. Robbins P.W. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 307-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Gda1p shows a high activity toward GDP, but a low activity toward UDP and no activity toward ATP and ADP (11Yanagisawa K. Resnick D. Abeijon C. Robbins P.W. Hirschberg C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19351-19355Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Deletion of GDA1results in a marked reduction in Golgi mannosylation of proteins and lipids in vivo (8Abeijon C. Yanagisawa K. Mandon E.C. Häusler A. Moreman K. Hirschberg C.B. Robbins P.W. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 307-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) and causes a 4-fold lower rate of GDP-mannose entry into Golgi vesicles in dolichol-P-Man synthase-deficient cells (12Berninsone P. Miret J.J. Hirschberg C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 207-211Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Nevertheless, in Δgda1cells, invertase is still heavily glycosylated, and in addition, a significant amount of GMP, as well as very low residual nonspecific nucleoside phosphatase activity unrelated to Gda1p, was detected in the Golgi membranes (8Abeijon C. Yanagisawa K. Mandon E.C. Häusler A. Moreman K. Hirschberg C.B. Robbins P.W. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 307-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 12Berninsone P. Miret J.J. Hirschberg C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 207-211Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These observations suggested the importance of residual GDPase activity in the Golgi lumen of the Δgda1mutant. Another possibility could be a direct supply of GMP from GDP-mannose by mannosyl-phosphate transferase. The MNN4 gene is known to encode a positive regulator of mannosyl phosphorylation (13Odani T. Shinmma Y. Wang X.-H. Jigami Y. FEBS Lett. 1997; 420: 186-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 14Odani T. Shimma Y. Tanaka A. Jigami Y. Glycobiology. 1996; 6: 805-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), but the analysis of mannosylation of invertase in Δgda1Δmnn4 double disruptant cells showed no effect on mannosylation when compared with that in Δgda1 alone. This result strongly indicated that the remaining GMP did not arise from mannosyl phosphorylation in the Golgi lumen of Δgda1 cells and prompted us to investigate other GDPases involved in protein glycosylation. At that time, it was already known that theSaccharomyces Genome Database contains at least one homologue of Gda1p that possess ∼20% amino acid identity to Gda1p and that also belongs to the apyrase superfamily, as determined by sequence alignment (15Handa M. Guidotti G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 218: 916-923Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Here we report that the residual GDPase activity in the Δgda1 mutant results from this homologue of Gda1p. It turned out to be a typical apyrase that can hydrolyze not only nucleoside diphosphates, as Gda1p does, but also nucleoside triphosphates. We also demonstrate that additional expression of this yeast apyrase can complement the lack of GDPase activity of Gda1p and plays an important role in controlling the protein glycosylation in Golgi compartments. For the above reason, we named the GDA1homologue YND1 (yeast nucleosidediphosphatase) to indicate a possible redundancy between the YND1 and GDA1 genes. In this paper, we present the first direct evidence for in vivo endo-apyrase function in protein glycosylation and suggest the involvement of yeast apyrase in cell wall integrity.

We find that a novel protein, MIG-13, is required to position these cells correctly. MIG-13 is a transmembrane protein whose expression is restricted to the anterior and central body regions by Hox gene activity. MIG-13 functions non–cell autonomously within these regions to promote migration toward the anterior: loss of mig-13 activity shifts the Q descendants toward the posterior, whereas increasing the level of MIG-13 shifts them anteriorly in a dose-dependent manner. Our findings suggest that MIG-13 is a component of a global A/P migration system, and that the level of MIG-13 determines where along the body axis these migrating cells stop."

In this report, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)- and neurotrophin-mediated NF (nuclear factor)-κB activation were compared in several cell lines. All cell types showed TNF-mediated activation of NF-κB, but direct neurotrophin-dependent activation of NF-κB was never observed under normal growth conditions. In PCNA cells, a modest nerve growth factor (NGF)-dependent induction of NF-κB was detected but only after cells were subjected to severe stress.

The increase in NF-κB activity mediated by NGF correlated with reduced levels of IκBα; NGF added alone had no effect on IκBα levels, but when added with TNF, NGF treatment significantly reduced IκBα levels.

Miller F.D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 213-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar). The other class of neurotrophin receptor contains only the p75NTR. This receptor is a member of the TNF receptor superfamily that includes CD27, CD30, CD40, 4–1BB, OX40, the Fas antigen, and the tumor necrosis factor receptors TNFR1 and TNFR2 (9Baker S.J. Reddy E.P. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1-9PubMed Google Scholar). Unlike for the Trk receptors, defining the precise physiological role of the p75NTR has proven difficult (10Barker P. Cell Death Differ. 1998; 5: 346-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Several studies indicate that p75NTR can functionally interact with Trk receptors to enhance or dampen intracellular signals. For example, when p75NTR is co-expressed with TrkA, it tends to dampen basal levels of TrkA activation and reduce the responses of TrkA to nonpreferred ligands (10Barker P.

However, p75NTR also facilitates NGF binding to TrkA and thus increases TrkA responses to preferred ligands (15Mahadeo D. Kaplan L. Chao M.V. Hempstead B.L. J. Biol.

Binding of each of the neurotrophins to p75NTR evokes activation of cellular sphingomyelinase, which results in increased ceramide production (19Dobrowsky R.T. Werner M.H. Castellino A.M. Chao M.V.

Carter B.D. Dobrowsky R.T. Chao M.V. Nature. 1996; 383: 716-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (714) Google Scholar, 22Frade J.M. Rodriguez-Tebar A. Barde Y.-A.

Specific p75NTR interacting proteins have proven difficult to identify, but the receptor's apoptotic function may be subserved by a region of intracellular homology shared between p75NTR and other apoptotic receptors of the TNF receptor superfamily. This 80-amino acid region, termed the death domain, is required to mediate interactions of other TNF receptor superfamily members with downstream apoptotic effectors (25Schulze-Osthoff K. Ferrari D. Los M. Wesselborg S. Peter M.E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 254: 439-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (858) Google Scholar).One well studied effect of TNF receptor superfamily members is activation of the transcription complex NF-κB (26Baldwin A.S.J. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (5537) Google Scholar). In response to ligand binding, receptors of this class bind TRAF proteins through their intracellular domains and activate a kinase cascade that culminates in activation of IKKα and IKKβ and subsequent phosphorylation of IκB subunits, which targets them for ubiquitination and proteosomal degradation (27Karin M. Delhase M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9067-9069Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). IκB degradation releases NF-κB subunits from their latent cytoplasmic state and allows them to translocate to the nucleus where they regulate specific gene regulatory events. There are preferential interactions of the six TRAF proteins with various members of the TNF receptor superfamily (28Aizawa S. Nakano H. Ishida T. Horie R. Nagai M. Ito K. Yagita H. Okumura K.

Virol. 1997; 71: 4649-4656Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and it is likely that differences in these TRAF protein associations play a crucial role in determining the levels of NF-κB activation that occur in response to a particular stimulus. To date, only TRAF6 has been reported to interact with p75NTR (32Khursigara G. Orlinick J.R. Chao M.V. J Biol Chem. 1999; 274: 2597-2600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar).NGF binding to p75NTR activates NF-κB in fibroblasts overexpressing p75NTR, in primary mouse Schwann cells (33Carter B.D.

Science. 1996; 272: 542-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar), and in primary rat oligodendrocytes (34Yoon S.O. Casaccia-Bonnefil P. Carter B. Chao M.V.

Neurosci. 1998; 18: 1297-1304Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To extend these results, we examined p75NTR-mediated NF-κB activation in PCNA, 293HEK, 3T3, and A875 melanoma cells. Here we show that neurotrophin binding to p75NTR does not directly activate NF-κB under normal physiological conditions but instead modulates NF-κB activation induced by other stimuli.RESULTSPrevious results indicate that p75NTR activates NF-κB in fibroblasts, Schwann cells, and oligodendrocytes (33Carter B.D. Kaltschmidt C. Kaltschmidt B. Offenhauser N. Bohm M.R. Baeuerle P.A. Barde Y.A. Science. 1996; 272: 542-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar, 34Yoon S.O. Casaccia-Bonnefil P. Carter B. Chao M.V. J Neurosci. 1998; 18: 3273-3281Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To test whether p75NTR-mediated activation of NF-κB is a general phenomenon, the activation of NF-κB by p75NTR was examined in cells that do not express endogenous p75NTR or Trk receptors. 293HEK cells were transiently transfected with a p75NTR expression vector or with the parental control vector and then treated for 2 h with either neurotrophin, TNF, or MC192, a rat p75NTR-specific monoclonal antibody. EMSA of extracted nuclear proteins revealed that TNF elicited a robust NF-κB response, yet neither the p75NTR-specific antibody nor any of the neurotrophins activated NF-κB (Fig.1 A). Various induction times (up to 12 h) and NGF doses (5 to 500 ng/ml) were examined, but an NGF-mediated NF-κB activation was never observed in 293HEK. Similar experiments were performed in p75NTR-transfected HeLa cells and 3T3 fibroblasts, which are commonly used cellular models for TNF signaling, but neither of these transfected cell types showed any evidence of NF-κB activation in response to NGF at any concentration or time point. TNF treatment, however, consistently produced robust NF-κB activation in these same cell lines (data not shown). To test whether neurotrophin-mediated NF-κB activation may be a feature of cell lines that express high endogenous levels of p75NTR, the A875 melanoma cell line was also examined. As with the other cell lines, EMSA revealed that TNF treatment resulted in robust NF-κB activation but NGF, BDNF, and NT3 had no effect on NF-κB activation under these conditions (Fig. 1 B).Previous reports showing that NGF binding to p75NTR increases NF-κB activity in EMSA in PCNA cells (33Carter B.D. Kaltschmidt C. Kaltschmidt B. Offenhauser N. Bohm M.R. Baeuerle P.A. Barde Y.A. Science. 1996; 272: 542-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar) and in primary rat oligodendrocytes (34Yoon S.O. Casaccia-Bonnefil P. Carter B. Chao M.V. J Neurosci. 1998; 18: 3273-3281Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 35Ladiwala U. Lachance C. Simoneau S.J. Bhakar A. Barker P.A. Antel J.P. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 1297-1304Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) suggest that p75NTR can activate NF-κB in primary cells and in some cell lines. We therefore examined p75NTR-mediated activation of NF-κB in PCNA cells, to determine whether our failure to detect NF-κB activation was due to cell type-specific differences in p75NTR signaling. Surprisingly, p75NTR-mediated NF-κB activation was not observed in PCNA cells in response to any of the four mammalian neurotrophins (Fig. 2 A and data not shown). One possible reason for this is that PCNA cells might produce endogenous neurotrophins that dampen an NF-κB response to exogenous ligand. However, cells plated at low density and washed extensively to remove endogenous neurotrophin still showed no evidence of NGF-mediated activation of NF-κB. A second possibility is that p75NTR-dependent NF-κB activation depends on culture conditions. Notably, NF-κB responses can be altered under conditions of cellular stress (41Guzhova I.V. Darieva Z.A. Melo A.R. Margulis B.A. Cell Stress Chaperones. 1997; 2: 132-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), and in the first report of p75NTR-mediated NF-κB activation (33Carter B.D. Kaltschmidt C. Kaltschmidt B. Offenhauser N. Bohm M.R. Baeuerle P.A. Barde Y.A. Science. 1996; 272: 542-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar), cells were subjected to two stressful conditions: a temperature shock and a period of serum starvation. 2B. Carter, personal communication. We therefore tested whether these conditions might increase the ability of PCNA cells to respond to NGF. For these experiments, PCNA cells were left in room-temperature air (20 °C) for several hours in serum-free medium. This procedure reduced cellular mitochondrial activity (Fig.2 B) and significantly increased the incidence of apoptotic nuclei (Fig. 2 D). Scoring of individual MTT-treated cells showed that after only 7 h of this treatment (Fig. 2 C), cells showed strongly reduced mitochondrial activity, yet the majority still remained adherent. Virtually no cells had detectable mitochondial activity after 21 h. EMSA from PCNA cells pretreated in this manner for 7 h are shown in Fig. 2 A. The stress treatment reduced basal NF-κB activity and strongly attenuated NF-κB activation induced by TNF. The stressed cells also revealed an NGF-dependent induction of NF-κB, an activation not observed in the unstressed cultures. Moreover, the shifted complex induced by both TNF and NGF in the stressed cells migrates more slowly than the predominant complex, activated by TNF in PCNA cells under physiological conditions. This difference presumably reflects the activation of different NF-κB components. Therefore, NGF binding to p75NTR does not directly activate NF-κB under physiological conditions but does activate an NF-κB complex in severely stressed PCNA cells.Figure 2NGF mediates activation of NF-κB in PCNA cells only after severe cellular stress. PCNA cells were maintained either in serum-containing medium at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere (control) or in serum-free medium in room-temperature air (20 °C) for several hours (stressed) as described under “Results.” Parallel cultures were analyzed in four ways. For NF-κB activity, unstressed (lanes 1-3) and cells stressed for 7 h (lanes 4-6) cells were left untreated (DMEB) or were treated with either NGF (100 ng/ml) or TNF (20 ng/ml) for an additional 2 h at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere, after which nuclear proteins were extracted and analyzed by EMSA using a labeled NF-κB probe (A). To measure mitochondrial activity, total MTT activity was quantified after 18 h of stress (B) and scoring of cellular MTT production was compared after 0, 3, 7, and 21 h of stress (C). For cell death analysis, apoptotic bodies were determined by propidium iodide staining after 18 h of stress (D).

Therefore, even though p75NTR may not directly activate NF-κB under physiological conditions, it is possible it may modulate NF-κB activation induced by other stimuli. To test this theory, 293HEK cells transiently transfected with a p75NTR expression construct were exposed to TNF, NGF, or combinations of both for 2, 6, or 10 h and then examined for NF-κB activation by EMSA. Fig.3 A shows that 2 h of TNF treatment causes a robust increase in NF-κB activity. This activation is attenuated when NGF is present, indicating that ligand signaling through p75NTR can affect signaling of other related cytokine receptors. Intriguingly, the modulatory effect of p75NTR changes with increasing time. After a 6-h treatment, NF-κB activation produced by TNF is equivalent to that mediated by TNF and NGF together, and by 10 h, TNF-mediated NF-κB activation is increased in the presence of NGF. Under these physiological conditions, neither increasing the time nor the concentration of NGF altered the mobility of the primary NF-κB complex induced by TNF. To confirm these results, we also examined a 293 subline (293T-HEK) using a different nuclear protein extraction protocol (33Carter B.D. Kaltschmidt C. Kaltschmidt B. Offenhauser N. Bohm M.R. Baeuerle P.A. Barde Y.A. Science. 1996; 272: 542-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar). Fig. 3 B shows that 293T-HEK cells transfected with p75NTR are strongly modulated by NGF binding to p75NTR, with NGF initially reducing TNF-induced NF-κB activation but then increasing NF-κB activation with time, qualitatively identical to that shown in Fig. 3 A. Our transfection efficiency in 293HEK cells is about 70%, and thus the magnitude of the NGF-induced modulation is likely an underestimate of the true magnitude of the modulatory effect of p75NTR. Densitometric quantification of scanned films revealed that the combination of NGF and TNF produced a significant average reduction of 26% at 2 h (p < 0.01), a 21% increase at 10 h (p < 0.03), but no change at 6 h (p < 0.47).Figure 3NGF modulates TNF-induced NF-κB activation in 293HEK cells expressing the p75NTR cell surface receptor in a time-dependent manner. A, 293HEK cells transiently transfected with a p75NTR expression vector were incubated with TNF (5 ng/ml) with or without NGF (250 ng/ml) for 2, 6, or 10 h. Nuclear extractions were performed and analyzed for NF-κB binding activity by EMSA using a labeled NF-κB probe. Experiments were repeated four times with similar results. B, similar experiments were performed on a 293T-HEK subline transfected with a control vector or with a p75NTR expression vector and cellular proteins were isolated using a whole cell extraction protocol (see “Experimental Procedures”). p75NTR expression levels determined by immunoblotting of cellular lysates are shown in the lower panel.

Primary melanocytes, originating from the neural crest, and melanoma cell lines normally co-express p75NTR and TNF receptors but have little or no TrkA expression (43Marano N. Dietzschold B.

Fig.4 A shows that NGF does not directly activate NF-κB in this cell type, but when examined 2 h after cytokine addition, NGF clearly increased TNF-mediated NF-κB activation, with maximal increases (60%) at 25 ng/ml and more moderate increases (30–40%) at higher NGF concentrations. In A875 cells, NGF increased TNF-mediated NF-κB activation at all time points examined (Fig. 4 B). Thus, in each cell line examined, NGF ultimately results in increased TNF mediated activation of NF-κB by 10 h. To determine whether the synergistic effects of NGF and TNF are observed if cells are pretreated with NGF, A875 cells were pretreated with NGF for 1 h and then induced with TNF for an additional 2 h. Fig. 4 C shows that the modulatory effect of NGF on TNF signaling is maintained under these pretreatment conditions.Figure 4Neurotrophins do not directly activate NF-κB in A875 cells, but NGF increases TNF-induced NF-κB activation in a time- and dose-dependent manner. A, A875 cells were incubated for 2 h in DMEB supplemented with either NGF (250 ng/ml) or TNF (5 ng/ml) or with TNF in the presence of increasing concentrations of NGF. Nuclear proteins were extracted and analyzed by EMSA using a labeled NF-κB probe. B, A875 cells ere incubated for 2, 6, or 10 h in DMEB alone or DMEB supplemented with TNF (5 ng/ml) in the absence or presence of NGF at 25 ng/ml.

Cell lysates were analyzed for p75NTR content by immunoblotting to confirm p75NTR expression (lower panel). This experiment was repeated four times with similar results. C, A875 cells were incubated with DMEB alone or DMEB supplemented with NGF (250 ng/ml) for 1 h and then induced with TNF for an additional 2 h. Nuclear proteins and EMSA were performed as above.

For these experiments, we used a 3T3-derived cell line (TIMP75-3 cells) in which p75NTR levels can be regulated by the addition of doxycycline. Fig.5 A (lower panel) shows that p75NTR is undetectable in the absence of doxycycline, but receptor expression increases dramatically in response to an 18-h doxycycline treatment. In the absence of detectable p75NTR expression, long term TNF treatment led to a moderate reduction in IκBα steady-state levels, which were not affected by the addition of NGF (lanes 3 and 4). When p75NTR was inducibly expressed, however, the reduction in IκBα protein induced by the combination of NGF and TNF was significantly greater than by TNF alone (Fig. 5 A, upper panel, lanes 7 and8; p < 0.02).Figure 5NGF does not directly reduce IκBα levels but instead facilitates IκBα degradation in the presence of TNF. A, TIMP75-3 cells were treated with or without doxycycline for 18 h and then treated with TNF (10 ng/ml) with or without NGF (100 ng/ml) for 10 h as indicated. Immunoblotting of cell lysates show IκBα levels (top panel) and confirm p75NTR expression (bottom panel). B, A875 cells were treated with DMEB alone or supplemented with TNF (10 ng/ml) and/or NGF (100 ng/ml) in the presence or absence of cycloheximide (10 μg/ml) for 2 h as indicated. IκBα levels in cell lysates were determined by immunoblotting. The experiments shown in A and B were each repeated three times with similar results. D, DMEB; T, TNF; N, NGF; and TN, TNF + NGF.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Following TNF treatment, IκBα proteins are rapidly degraded and then resynthesized, and measurement of steady-state levels of IκBα represents the balance between these two processes. To directly test whether NGF facilitates TNF-mediated IκBα degradation, the effects of NGF and TNF on IκBα levels were determined in the presence and absence of cycloheximide, a protein synthesis inhibitor. If NGF acts to facilitate IκBα degradation, its effect on IκBα levels should still be observed in the presence of translation inhibitors. Fig.5 B shows that the combination of NGF and TNF produced a greater reduction in IκBα steady-state levels in A875 cells than did TNF alone (average decrease of 30%), consistent with the findings in the TIMP75-3 line. In the presence of cycloheximide, the effect of combining NGF and TNF was retained, with considerably more IκBα degradation observed compared with TNF alone. This result argues that the mechanism by which NGF acts involves, at least in part, the facilitation of TNF-mediated IκBα degradation.EMSA revealed that the maximal increase in NF-κB activity induced by NGF is about 3–4-fold in both transfected 293HEK cells and A875 cells. To determine whether this moderate increase in activated NF-κB complexes results in increased NF-κB-dependent transcription, an NF-κB-responsive LacZ reporter construct was transfected into 293HEK cells together with a p75NTR expression plasmid or with a parental control vector. Fig. 6shows that NGF added alone did not activate transcription from the LacZ reporter construct in 293HEK cells transfected with either control vector or p75NTR expression plasmid. NGF also had no effect on TNF-mediated NF-κB transcription in cells transfected with the parental expression vector, indicating that NGF does not exert p75NTR-independent effects on NF-κB. In cells expressing p75NTR, however, the combination of NGF and TNF significantly increases NF-κB activation compared with cells treated with TNF alone (p < 0.0001) and therefore suggests that the moderate increases in NF-κB binding activity result in significant increases in the NF-κB transcriptional response.Figure 6NGF has no direct effect on NF-κB transcriptional activity but increases TNF-mediated NF-κB transcriptional activity through a p75NTR-dependent pathway. 293HEK cells transiently transfected with NF-κB dependent β-galactosidase and green fluorescent protein reporter constructs with either a control vector or a p75NTR expression vector. 24 h after transfection, cells were switched to media containing 5 ng/ml TNF, 100 ng/ml NGF, or the two combined for 16 h, and then cell lysates were prepared and analyzed for LacZ activity as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Multiple analysis of variance shows that cells expressing p75NTR, TNF, and TNF + NGF treatment groups differ significantly (p value < 0.0001, indicated by anasterisk). This experiment was repeated three times with similar results.View Large"

Because abnormal platelet production and activation have been implicated in gestational pathologies, additional pregnancy-specific cytokines may play important roles in the regulation of megakaryocytopoiesis. Consistent with this hypothesis, we have found that the hormone prolactin-like protein E, a placental hormone that we have recently characterized, targets megakaryocytes through a specific cell surface receptor and induces megakaryocyte differentiation through a gp130-dependent signal transduction pathway."

Several of these SH2 domain-containing proteins have been identified and include Src family members; phospholipase Cγ1; GTPase-activating protein (p120GAP); phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase; the phosphotyrosine phosphatase SHP-2; and adaptor proteins such as Shc, Grb2, Grb7, and Nck (5Claesson-Welsh L.

For example, binding of phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase and phospholipase Cγ1 to the ligand-activated PDGFR mediates the expression of immediate-early genes (11Montmayeur J.P. Valius M. Vandenheede J.

Cell. 1993; 73: 321-334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar). These results suggest a fundamental role for PDGFR activation in growth regulation through autophosphorylation and subsequent activation of critical signaling molecules. In addition, the fact that the expression of a constitutively active PDGFR leads to cellular transformation (13Gazit A. Igarashi H. Chiu I.M. Srinivasan A. Yaniv A. Tronick S.R. Robbin K.C. Aaronson S.A. Cell. 1984; 39: 89-97Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) suggests that in normal cells, PDGFR activity must be tightly regulated to oppose continuous activation of its downstream effectors. The regulatory mechanisms involved in terminating signals initiated by activated PDGFRs remain poorly defined. One such regulatory mechanism may involve the action of phosphatases, which can potentially dephosphorylate tyrosine residues associated with kinase activation and/or recruitment of signaling molecules. For example, the protein-tyrosine phosphatase Syp (SHP-2) associates with the activated PDGFR and mediates PDGFR signaling by recruiting other downstream signaling molecules. However, Syp also participates in signal termination by dephosphorylating key tyrosines on PDGFR (14Klinghoffer R.A. Kazlauskas A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22208-22217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Another mechanism may involve Ser/Thr phosphorylation of the receptors. In fact, it is well documented that Ser/Thr phosphorylation of the insulin receptor by cAMP-dependent protein kinase (15Roth R.A. Beaudoin J. Diabetes. 1987; 36: 123-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), protein kinase C (16Takayama S. White M.F. Kahn C.R. J. Biol.

FEBS Lett. 1988; 232: 130-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) inhibits insulin receptor autophosphorylation and kinase activity. The EGFR was shown to be negatively regulated by Ser/Thr phosphorylation in epidermal growth factor-stimulated A431 cells (18Countaway J.L. Nairn A.C. Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1129-1140Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Kiyokawa N. Lee E.K. Karunagaran D. Lin S.-Y. Hang M.-C. J. Biol.

Sheffield L.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1200-1207Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). To date, no such effect of Ser/Thr phosphorylation has been described for the PDGFR. Recently, we have identified casein kinase I-γ2 (CKI-γ2) as a protein kinase constitutively associated with the SH3 domains of Nck (21Lussier G. Larose L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2688-2694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). CKI-γ2 is a member of the large CKI family of Ser/Thr protein kinases (22Zhai L. Graves P.R. Robinson L.C. Italiano M. Culbertson M.R. Rowles J. Cobb M.H. De Paoli-Roach A.A. Roach P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12717-12724Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In vitro, CKI members phosphorylate the β-subunit of the insulin receptor and inhibit its tyrosine kinase activity (23Tuazon P.T. Pang D.T. Shafer J.A. Traugh J.A. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 28: 159-170Google Scholar). In vivo, it has also been reported that CKI is constitutively associated with p75TNFR and phosphorylates this receptor in a ligand-dependent manner to negatively regulate tumor necrosis factor signaling to apoptosis (24Beyaert R. Vanhaesebroeck B. Declercq W. Van Lint J. Vandenabeele P. Agostinis P. Vandenheede J.R. Fiers W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23293-23299Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Most recently, CKI-α was found to enhance the agonist-dependent serine phosphorylation of the m3-muscarinic G-protein-coupled receptor (25Tobin A.B. Totty N.F. Sterlin A.E. Nahorski S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20844-20849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Given that Nck binds to the activated PDGFR and that CKI-γ2 is constitutively associated with Nck, we investigated whether, upon PDGF stimulation, CKI-γ2 could phosphorylate the PDGFR and negatively regulate its activity. Interestingly, eight potential CKI phosphorylation sites (X S(P)XX S*X,X E XX S*X) (26Kemp B.E. Pearson R.B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 342-346Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (807) Google Scholar) lie within the intracellular moiety of the β-isoform of the PDGFR amino acid sequence, suggesting that the β-PDGFR might be a direct target for CKI phosphorylation. In this report, we demonstrate that in vivo, the β-PDGFR is highly serine-phosphorylated upon ligand activation. In contrast to the transient state of tyrosine phosphorylation, phosphorylation of the β-PDGFR on serine residues is sustained and occurs at least in part in a CKI-dependent manner. Furthermore, we show that in vitro, recombinant CKI-γ2 phosphorylates the PDGF-activated β-PDGFR on serine residues, leading to inhibition of the receptor's autophosphorylating activity. Finally, in Rat-2 fibroblasts expressing HA-tagged active CKI-γ2, tyrosine phosphorylation of the β-PDGFR in response to PDGF stimulation is dramatically attenuated, indicating that CKI-γ2 impairs activation of the receptor by its ligand. Rat-2 fibroblasts were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM; Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 2 mml-glutamine, 45 mm sodium bicarbonate, and 10% fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.) and maintained in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Rat-2 fibroblasts stably transfected with the HA epitope-tagged mouse CKI-γ2 cDNA or the empty vector (pSV2Zeo, Invitrogen) were maintained under the same conditions, except that 50 μg/ml Zeocin was added to the culture medium. [32P]Orthophosphate and [γ-32P]ATP were obtained from NEN Life Science Products. Human PDGF-BB and PDGF-AA were purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Wortmannin was from Sigma.N-(2-aminoethyl)-5-chloroisoquinoline-8-sulfamide (CKI-7) was obtained from Seikagaku Corp. All other reagents were from commercial sources. PDGFR antibodies were from two different sources. α-PDGFR1, a rabbit polyclonal antibody, was raised against a GST fusion protein containing the carboxyl-terminal region of the human β-PDGFR (amino acids 953–1106). α-PDGFR2, an affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against a peptide corresponding to amino acids 958–1106 of the carboxyl terminus of the human β-PDGFR, was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies were a mixture of the mouse monoclonal antibodies 4G10 (1:3000; Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) and PY20 (1:1000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Rat-2 fibroblasts (75% confluence) were starved in low serum (0.2%) DMEM for 24 h, rinsed three times with phosphate-free DMEM, and incubated for 4 h at 37 °C in phosphate-free DMEM containing 0.2% dialyzed fetal bovine serum and 0.2 mCi/ml [32P]orthophosphate. For PDGF stimulation, at the end of the 4-h labeling period, human PDGF-BB (50 ng/ml) was added to the culture medium for different times. For inhibitors studies, at the end of the 4-h labeling period, the cells were incubated for 30 min in the absence or presence of CKI-7 (300 μm) or wortmannin (100 nm), prior to stimulation with 50 ng/ml PDGF-BB, for 5 min. Cells were washed three times with cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in lysis buffer (50 mmHepes (pH 7.5), 150 mm sodium chloride, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 1.5 mm magnesium chloride, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 10 mmsodium fluoride, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 200 μmsodium orthovanadate).

The final bead pellets were resuspended in Laemmli buffer, boiled, centrifuged, and resolved by SDS-PAGE, followed by transfer onto PVDF membranes. The amount and degree of tyrosine phosphorylation of the β-PDGFR were assessed on β-PDGFR immunoprecipitates following SDS-PAGE, transfer onto nitrocellulose membranes, and immunoblotting with appropriate antibodies. For β-PDGFR immunoblots, membranes were blocked in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween 20 (TBS-T) and 5% dry milk for 30 min at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C, prior to incubation with α-PDGFR antibody. For anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblots, membranes were blocked in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.05% Nonidet P-40 (TBS-N) and 5% bovine serum albumin for 30 min at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C and then incubated with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. In both instances, membranes were incubated with antibodies for 90 min at room temperature; washed in TBS and TBS-T or TBS-N; and then incubated with horseradish peroxidase-GAR, horseradish peroxidase-GAM,125I-GAR, or 125I-GAM. Blots were washed as described above, and protein detection was achieved by enhanced chemiluminescence (NEN Life Science Products) or autoradiography. The full-length coding sequence of mouse CKI-γ2 was subcloned into the bacterial expression vector pGEX-4T-2 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Eluted GST-CKI-γ2 was prepared according to the manufacturer's protocol (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech); concentrated on a Centricon 30; and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, at 1 μg/μl based on Coomassie Blue staining. GST-CKI-γ2 activity was assayed by an in vitro kinase assay (kinase buffer: 10 mm Hepes (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm dithiothreitol) toward itself or α-casein (15 μg). Pooled cell lysates from PDGF-stimulated or unstimulated Rat-2 fibroblasts were subjected to PDGFR immunoprecipitation as described above. Immunoprecipitated proteins were washed three times with HNTG buffer and three times with the kinase buffer. Final bead pellets were resuspended in kinase buffer and aliquoted in fractions corresponding to 1 mg of proteins of the initial cell lysate. GST-CKI-γ2 (0.25–0.5 μg) and CKI-7 (100 μm) were added to appropriate samples, and the reactions were initiated by the addition of 20 μm ATP containing 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. After 20 min at 30 °C, the samples were washed three times with HNTG buffer, resuspended in Laemmli buffer, boiled, and resolved by SDS-PAGE. After transfer onto PVDF membrane, the phosphorylated β-PDGFR was visualized by autoradiography, and under each condition, the corresponding β-PDGFR band was excised and subjected to phosphoamino acid analysis. Phosphoamino acids were analyzed according to the method of Hunter and Sefton (27Hunter T. Sefton B.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 1311-1315Crossref PubMed Scopus (1556) Google Scholar).32P-Labeled β-PDGFRs from in vivo or in vitro experiments were excised from the PVDF membrane and washed 10 times with H2O. Hydrolysis was performed for 1 h at 110 °C in 6 n HCl. Membranes were then discarded, and after centrifugation, the supernatants were lyophilized and finally resuspended in buffer at pH 1.9 containing 1 mg/ml phosphoserine, phosphothreonine, and phosphotyrosine as internal standards. Phosphoamino acids were separated by two-dimensional electrophoresis (buffer at pH 1.9 and 3.9) on TLC plates (EM Sciences), visualized by autoradiography, and identified by comparing with ninhydrin-stained phosphoamino acid standards. Immunoprecipitated β-PDGFRs from PDGF-stimulated or unstimulated Rat-2 fibroblast lysates were phosphorylated in vitro by GST-CKI-γ2 as described earlier, except that only unlabeled ATP (20 μm) was used in the assay. At the end of the reaction, the samples were washed three times with HNTG buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE. Following transfer of the proteins onto nitrocellulose membrane, autophosphorylation of PDGFRs was evaluated by immunoblotting with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. Rat-2 fibroblasts were treated for 5 min with PDGF-AA (50 ng/ml) or PDGF-BB (25 and 50 ng/ml) to determine which isoform of the PDGFR becomes activated in these cells. Total cell lysates from PDGF-stimulated and unstimulated Rat-2 fibroblasts were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. As shown in Fig.1 (upper panel), PDGF-AA did not induce tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins present in total cell lysates. In contrast, cell stimulation with PDGF-BB increased tyrosine phosphorylation of several proteins. These results suggest that in Rat-2 fibroblasts, the α-isoform of the PDGFR is weakly expressed, if not absent, and that in response to PDGF-BB, the β-isoform is the major PDGFR activated. To confirm that the PDGFR immunoprecipitated by both PDGFR antibodies was the β-PDGFR, Rat-2 fibroblasts were stimulated with PDGF-AA or PDGF-BB, and proteins from cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with both PDGFR antibodies. PDGFRs immunoprecipitated by both PDGFR antibodies were tyrosine-phosphorylated only upon cell stimulation with PDGF-BB (Fig.1, middle and lower panels), demonstrating that both PDGFR antibodies that we used in this study did not cross-react with the α-PDGFR if present. To investigatein vivo the phosphorylation of the β-PDGFR, Rat-2 fibroblasts were metabolically labeled with [32P]orthophosphate and treated with PDGF-BB for different times, and the β-PDGFRs were immunoprecipitated using α-PDGFR1 antibody (Fig.2 A). β-PDGFRs from unstimulated cells showed substantial constitutive phosphorylation, whereas phosphorylation of β-PDGFRs from cells treated with PDGF for 5 min was significantly increased (Fig. 2 B). However, the extent of PDGF-stimulated phosphorylation of the β-PDGFR was transient, and although still significantly higher than the basal level, it decreased after 30 min compared with 5 min of stimulation (Fig. 2 B). To determine the nature of the amino acids residues that are phosphorylated upon PDGF stimulation, immunoprecipitated β-PDGFRs from metabolically labeled Rat-2 fibroblasts stimulated or not with PDGF were subjected to phosphoamino acid analysis (Fig. 2, C and D). The unstimulated β-PDGFR was phosphorylated almost exclusively on serine residues (Fig. 2 D). Upon 5 min of PDGF treatment, serine phosphorylation of the β-PDGFR increased and remained elevated at 30 min (Fig. 2 C). Phosphorylation of the β-PDGFR on threonine residues, almost undetected under basal conditions, was weakly detected at 5 min of PDGF stimulation, but was clearly present at 30 min (Fig.2 C). In contrast, tyrosine phosphorylation of the β-PDGFR, almost absent under basal conditions, transiently increased following 5 min of PDGF stimulation and then decreased at 30 min (Fig.2 C). Tyrosine phosphorylation of the PDGFR and its role in mediating activation of diverse signaling cascades are largely documented (8Yokote K. Margolis B. Heldin C.-H. Claesson-Welsh L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30942-30949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In contrast, Ser/Thr phosphorylation of the PDGFR has not been studied. Our data are consistent with the known agonist-dependent transient increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of the β-PDGFR, but surprisingly, we demonstrated an agonist-induced sustained Ser/Thr phosphorylation of this receptor. This suggests that upon its activation, the β-PDGFR becomes an efficient substrate of yet unidentified Ser/Thr protein kinase(s). Upon activation, the β-PDGFR recruits several SH2 domain-containing proteins, which themselves complex with other effector proteins. For example, the p85 regulatory subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase is constitutively associated with p110, the catalytic subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase, and Nck is constitutively associated with p21 (Cdc42/Rac1)-activated protein kinase (28Bokoch G.M.

Westick J.K. Sparks A.B. Kay B.K. Jenkin N.A. Gilbert D.J. Copeland N.G. Der C.J. J. Biol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 2688-2694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), all of which are protein kinases with Ser/Thr kinase specificity. Among these Ser/Thr protein kinases, we attempted to determine whether phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase or CKI-γ2 participates in serine phosphorylation of the β-PDGFR upon its activation. We studied in vivo the effects of wortmannin and CKI-7 on Ser/Thr phosphorylation of the β-PDGFR upon PDGF stimulation (Fig. 3,A and C). At the concentrations used in this study, wortmannin (100 nm) and CKI-7 (300 μm) are specific inhibitors of phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase and CKI enzymes, respectively (24Beyaert R. Vanhaesebroeck B. Declercq W. Van Lint J. Vandenabeele P. Agostinis P. Vandenheede J.R. Fiers W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23293-23299Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 31Arcaro A. Wyman M.P. Biochem. J. 1993; 296: 297-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (1053) Google Scholar, 32Chijiwa A. Haguiwara M. Hidaka H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4924-4927Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Rat-2 fibroblasts pretreated with wortmannin showed the same overall level of PDGF-induced β-PDGFR phosphorylation that was observed in the absence of wortmannin (Fig. 3,A and C), indicating that phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase is not the Ser/Thr protein kinase mediating the agonist-dependent serine phosphorylation of the β-PDGFR. Moreover, wortmannin did not apparently affect the phosphorylation of the unstimulated β-PDGFR. In contrast, CKI-7 strongly inhibited β-PDGFR phosphorylation upon PDGF stimulation (Fig. 3, Aand C) and may also weakly inhibit its phosphorylation in unstimulated cells. To determine that equal amounts of receptors were immunoprecipitated under each condition, similar experiments were performed on unlabeled Rat-2 fibroblasts, and the amount of β-PDGFR immunoprecipitated was detected by immunoblotting with α-PDGFR1 antibody (Fig. 3 B). In unstimulated and PDGF-stimulated cell lysates, prior cell treatment with wortmannin or CKI-7 did not affect the amounts of β-PDGFR immunoprecipitated. Phosphoamino acid analysis of the β-PDGFR from labeled cells treated with CKI-7 revealed that serine phosphorylation of the PDGF-stimulated β-PDGFR was decreased (Fig. 3 D). Indeed, in cells exposed only to DMSO (3%), phosphorylation of the β-PDGFR on serine residues represented 74.6% (S.E. = 6.1, n = 5) of the total32P incorporated into the three phosphoamino acids, whereas in cells treated with CKI-7 (3% Me2SO), it significantly decreased to 40.8% (S.E. = 4.5, n = 3). These observations provide strong evidence that upon its activation, the β-PDGFR is a substrate at least for CKI Ser/Thr protein kinases since its serine phosphorylation is strongly inhibited by CKI-7, a specific inhibitor of CKI. Interestingly, in lysates of Rat-2 fibroblasts treated with CKI-7, a significant decrease in phosphorylation of other proteins that normally co-immunoprecipitate with the activated β-PDGFR was also observed (Fig. 3 A). This suggests that fewer of these proteins are associated or less efficiently phosphorylated by the β-PDGFR in the presence of CKI-7. Alternatively, these proteins could be substrates of CKI, which are inhibited by CKI-7. To confirm whether the β-PDGFR could be phosphorylated by a CKI-7-dependent protein kinase, we submitted the immunoprecipitated β-PDGFR from PDGF-stimulated or unstimulated Rat-2 fibroblasts to an in vitro phosphorylation assay with active recombinant GST-CKI-γ2, the CKI isoform that we have previously found constitutively associated with Nck (21Lussier G. Larose L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2688-2694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Recombinant CKI-γ2 efficiently phosphorylated the PDGF-activated β-PDGFR in a CKI-7-sensitive manner, but failed to phosphorylate the β-PDGFR immunoprecipitated from unstimulated cells (Fig. 4 A). As expected, phosphoamino acid analysis confirmed that recombinant CKI-γ2 phosphorylates the activated β-PDGFR on serine residues (Fig.4 B). These results clearly demonstrate that the β-PDGFR is phosphorylated by CKI-γ2, however, only once the receptor is activated by its ligand, suggesting that an agonist-induced conformational change or prephosphorylation of the β-PDGFR is a necessary event for CKI-γ2 phosphorylation. To investigate whether CKI-γ2 serine phosphorylation of the ligand-activated β-PDGFR affects the receptor's kinase activity, we examined the autophosphorylation of the immunoprecipitated β-PDGFR from PDGF-stimulated Rat-2 fibroblasts after in vitrophosphorylation by GST-CKI-γ2. In the presence of unlabeled ATP, autophosphorylation of the β-PDGFR, evaluated by immunoblotting with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody, was dramatically reduced when GST-CKI-γ2 was added to the assay compared with autophosphorylation of an equal amount of immunoprecipitated β-PDGFR not exposed to GST-CKI-γ2 (Fig. 5). These results demonstrate that serine phosphorylation of the β-PDGFR by CKI-γ2 results in inhibition of the ability of PDGFR to autophosphorylate. To test whether the CKI-γ2-dependent phosphorylation of the activated β-PDGFR resulting in decreased receptor kinase activity is restricted to its autophosphorylation, we attempted to study the ability of the CKI-γ2-phosphorylated PDGF-activated β-PDGFR to phosphorylate the exogenous substrates poly(Glu,Tyr) and enolasein vitro. Unfortunately, these substrates were efficiently phosphorylated by GST-CKI-γ2, which remained in our samples even after several washes. CKI enzymes were described as dual specific kinases in yeast (33Hoekstra M.F. Dhillon N. Carmel G. DeMaggio A.J. Lindberg R.A. Hunter T. Kuret J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 877-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Although the mammalian counterparts are not known to possess this dual activity, GST-CKI-γ2 efficiently phosphorylates poly(Glu,Tyr) and enolase in an artificial in vitro system, creating a high background signal that does not allow specific detection of the receptor activity toward these exogenous substrates (data not shown). We measured the relative contribution of CKI-γ2 to act as a negative regulator of the β-PDGFR activity in vivo by examining tyrosine phosphorylation of the β-PDGFR in Rat-2 fibroblasts stably expressing an HA epitope-tagged mouse CKI-γ2. Three clones expressing different levels of active HA-CKI-γ2 (Fig. 6,A and B) were stimulated for 5 min with PDGF, and the β-PDGFR tyrosine phosphorylation state was determined by anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblotting of the immunoprecipitated β-PDGFR. Increased expression of CKI-γ2 dramatically reduced the ability of the β-PDGFR to become tyrosine-phosphorylated upon PDGF stimulation (Fig. 6 C), and this was not attributed to differential amounts of β-PDGFR immunoprecipitated (Fig.6 D). These results strongly support that in vivo, CKI-γ2 negatively regulates the autophosphorylating activity of the β-PDGFR. Receptor tyrosine kinases are ligand-regulated transmembrane enzymes for which the tyrosine kinase activity of their intracellular domain is subject to diverse regulatory mechanisms. Such mechanisms may consist of receptor internalization and degradation processes (34Di Guglielmo G.M. Drake P.G. Bass P.C. Authier F. Posner B.I. Bergeron J.M. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1998; 182: 59-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), specific Ser/Thr phosphorylation within their cytoplasmic domain (35Theroux S.J. Latour D.A. Stanley K. Raden D.L. Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16620-16626Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and dephosphorylation by phosphatases (14Klinghoffer R.A. Kazlauskas A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22208-22217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Among these regulatory mechanisms, serine phosphorylation has been shown to impair insulin- and epidermal growth factor-induced activation of their cognate receptors (18Countaway J.L. Nairn A.C. Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1129-1140Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Gardner D.P. Shimizu N. J. Cell.

Chem. 1990; 265: 3407-3416Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For the EGFR, mutagenesis of these serine phosphorylation sites results in enhanced EGFR activity and increased EGFR signal transduction (18Countaway J.L. Nairn A.C. Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1129-1140Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, binding of the brain-derived neurotrophic factor to p75NTR leads to an increase in serine phosphorylation of the TrkA receptor cytoplasmic domain and results in a strong attenuation of TrkA signaling (39MacPhee I.J. Barker P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23547-23551Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). This study is the first to demonstrate that the activity of the β-PDGFR is negatively regulated by serine phosphorylation. Moreover, we have shown that this negative regulation by serine phosphorylation is initiated by the ligand. We have identified CKI-γ2 as a candidate Ser/Thr protein kinase mediating this effect. In vitro, we have shown that phosphorylation of the ligand-activated β-PDGFR by CKI-γ2 inhibits the receptor's autophosphorylating activity. The finding that expression of HA-CKI-γ2 in Rat-2 fibroblasts dramatically reduced tyrosine phosphorylation of the PDGF-activated β-PDGFR is in agreement with the in vitro observations. These data may be explained by the fact that the activated β-PDGFR binds the adaptor protein Nck (40Nishimura R. Li W. Kashishian A. Mondino A. Zhou M. Cooper J. Schlessinger J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6889-6896Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), which is constitutively associated with the γ2-isoform of CKI (21Lussier G. Larose L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2688-2694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Upon PDGF stimulation, the Nck·CKI-γ2 complex could be translocated into close proximity to the activated β-PDGFR, allowing direct phosphorylation of the receptor by CKI-γ2. Serine phosphorylation of β-PDGFR could then effect the termination of the receptor's signaling activity through inhibition of its tyrosine kinase activity. p75TNFR and the G-coupled m3-muscarinic receptor have been reported to be serine-phosphorylated and negatively regulated by CKI in an agonist-dependent manner (24Beyaert R. Vanhaesebroeck B. Declercq W. Van Lint J. Vandenabeele P. Agostinis P. Vandenheede J.R. Fiers W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23293-23299Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 25Tobin A.B. Totty N.F. Sterlin A.E. Nahorski S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20844-20849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). However, the serine residues phosphorylated by CKI have not been identified, nor has the mechanism by which serine phosphorylation regulates their signaling. This study reveals for the first time that following activation, a receptor tyrosine kinase has its activity negatively regulated in a CKI-dependent manner. In contrast to the β-PDGFR, neither p75TNFR nor the m3-muscarinic receptor contain an intrinsic activity, suggesting that the mechanism by which CKI-mediated serine phosphorylation regulates PDGFR signaling activity might be different. In the case of the former receptors, serine phosphorylation may directly impair association and activation of signal transduction molecules. Alternatively, by analogy to the β-adrenergic receptor, where binding of β-arrestin to the β-adrenergic receptor kinase serine-phosphorylated β-adrenergic receptor prevents its interaction with G-proteins and therefore signaling, (41Ferguson S.S. Zhang J. Barak L.S. Caron M.G. Life Sci. 1998; 62: 1561-1565Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar), CKI-mediated phosphorylation of p75TNFR and m3-muscarinic receptor may promote association of molecules that prevent binding of critical transducing molecules, thereby abolishing signaling. For the β-PDGFR, a different mechanism can be proposed whereby CKI-dependent serine phosphorylation attenuates the β-PDGFR autophosphorylating activity, thus terminating signal transduction through direct negative regulation of the receptor's kinase activity. The amino acid sequence of the intracellular domain of the β-PDGFR harbors several consensus motifs for potential phosphorylation by CKI enzymes (X(S)PXX S*, EXX S*) (26Kemp B.E. Pearson R.B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 342-346Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (807) Google Scholar, 42Flotow H. Graves P.R. Wang A. Fiol C.J. Roeske R.W. Roach P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14264-14269Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Three of these motifs are of particular interest. The first two, which contain serines 573 and 574 (VIESVS 573 S 574DG) in the juxtamembrane domain, are in close proximity to tyrosines 579 and 581, for which autophosphorylation has been recently reported to be critical for maximal PDGFR activity (43Baxter R.M. Secrist J.P. Vaillancourt R.R. Kazlauskas A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17050-17055Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Mutant 579/581 of the β-PDGFR only modestly autophosphorylates in response to PDGF, and its kinase activity toward exogenous substrates was not increased by PDGF stimulation. Given that phosphorylation of tyrosines 579 and 581 is required to associate Src (44Mori S. Ronnstrand L. Yokote K. Engstrom A. Courtneidge S.A. Claesson-Welch L. Heldin C.-H. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2257-2264Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar) and that Src phosphorylates the β-PDGFR (45Hansen K. Johnell M. Siegbahn A. Rorsman C. Engstrom U. Werndtedt C. Heldin C.-H. Ronnstrand L. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5299-5313Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), it has been suggested that Src might play a role in the receptor activation. Putative phosphorylation of serine 573 or 754 by CKI-γ2 could impair phosphorylation of tyrosines 579 and 581, affecting Src association, and thus result in incomplete activation of the receptor. Alternatively, serine phosphorylation of the β-PDGFR in the catalytic domain may directly affect its kinase activity. In favor of this hypothesis, the third consensus motif contains serine 862 (YISKGS 862TF) in the putative activation loop close to tyrosine 857. Phosphorylation of Tyr857 has been shown to be required for maximal receptor activity (46Kazlauskas A. Durden D.L. Cooper J.A. Cell Regul. 1991; 2: 413-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 47Fantl W.J. Escobedo J.A. Williams L.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 4473-4478Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar); thus, phosphorylation of serine 862 by CKI could impair phosphorylation of tyrosine 857 and, consequently, activation of the receptor. However, we cannot exclude the presence of other protein kinase(s) in the β-PDGFR immunoprecipitates, such that in vitro phosphorylation of the activated β-PDGFR by CKI-γ2 may be indirect. Nonetheless, the activity of these kinases, if present, is CKI-dependent since CKI-7 inhibited β-PDGFR serine phosphorylation in vivo and in vitro. Experiments are in progress to identify the serine residues within the β-PDGFR intracellular domain that are phosphorylated upon ligand-mediated receptor activation. These studies will confirm whether these sites are direct substrates for CKI phosphorylation and will clarify the mechanism by which serine phosphorylation of the β-PDGFR leads to inhibition of its autophosphorylating activity. The activity of receptor tyrosine kinases is determined by the balance of positive and negative regulatory events occurring with different kinetics in normal cells. Ligand binding to the β-PDGFR rapidly induces receptor autophosphorylation and increases receptor tyrosine kinase activity, which contribute to signal transduction by promoting recruitment and/or activation of signaling molecules. Simultaneously, ligand activation of the β-PDGFR initiates events leading to serine phosphorylation of the receptor (Fig. 2 C), which could negatively regulate its activity and hence oppose activation. What is interesting is that simultaneously to receptor activation, the inhibitory factors are already set in place, but are only manifest when they become sufficiently powerful to override the factors maintaining receptor activity. Thus, the inhibitory signals are recruited early, but the kinetics of their effect allow sufficient time for signal transmission. Herein, we demonstrated that this mechanism as its relates to the β-PDGFR involves CKI-γ2 at an early stage in signaling. This does not exclude that other serine protein kinases may also participate in regulating PDGFR activity, especially at later times after PDGFR activation. However, it is tempting to speculate that overexpression of CKI-γ2 could overcome cell transformation due to hyperactivation of the β-PDGFR. We are currently investigating this possibility.

PC2 is the only member of this family whose activation requires intracellular interaction with a helper protein, the neuroendocrine protein 7B2.

Mutant proteins were analyzed in four assays: binding to proPC2, facilitation of proPC2 maturation, and activation of proPC2 in vivo and in vitro. We found that the amino-terminal half of 7B2 is not involved in proPC2 activation, and we identified an active 36-residue peptide that contains the previously characterized proline-rich sequence as well as an α-helix and the only disulfide bond of 7B2. Mutation of the α-helix and of the cysteines demonstrated that these determinants are absolutely required for PC2 activation.

A family of mammalian subtilisin-like endoproteases responsible for these processing events has been recently identified, the prohormone convertases (PCs) 1The abbreviations used are: PC, prohormone convertase; CT-peptide, 7B2155–186; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; TGN, trans-Golgi network; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; Fmoc, N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl1The abbreviations used are: PC, prohormone convertase; CT-peptide, 7B2155–186; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; TGN, trans-Golgi network; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; Fmoc, N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl (reviewed in Refs. 1Seidah N.G.

PC1 and PC2 are the prohormone convertases specific for neuroendocrine cells; both enzymes are active late in the secretory pathway, i.e. the trans-Golgi network (TGN) and the secretory granules. Precursors such as proinsulin or proopiomelanocortin are processed sequentially, first by PC1, then by PC2 (reviewed in Ref. 3Rouille Y. Duguay S.J. Lund K. Furuta M. Gong Q. Lipkind G.

Chretien M. FEBS Lett. 1982; 147: 261-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). It is an 185-residue precursor that is cleaved at a pentabasic site at residue 155 (Fig. 1), most probably by furin (19Ayoubi T.A.Y. van Duijnhoven H.L.P. van de Ven W.J.M. Jenks B.G. Roubos E.W.

Chem. 1994; 269: 19279-19285Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The two domains generated by this cleavage have distinct functions; the amino-terminal domain of 21 kDa is sufficient for PC2 activation (14Zhu X. Lindberg I. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1641-1650Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), and the COOH-terminal domain of 31 residues is a potent inhibitor of PC2 activity (22Lindberg I. Van den Hurk W.H. Bui C. Batie C.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 5486-5493Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 23Van Horssen A.M. Van den Hurk W.H. Bailyes E.M. Hutton J.C. Martens G.J.M. Lindberg I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14292-14296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Based on the homology between the 90 amino-terminal residues with members of the chaperonin 60 family, 7B2 was originally proposed to act as a molecular chaperone specific for proPC2 (12Braks J.A.M. Martens G.J.M. Cell. 1994; 78: 263-273Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). We have already demonstrated that the 90 amino-terminal residues alone cannot bind to proPC2 (14Zhu X. Lindberg I. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1641-1650Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar); they could nonetheless be involved in PC2 activation. Thus, the function of the amino-terminal half of 7B2 is not yet known. In order to analyze the role of the amino-terminal half of 7B2 and to better understand the involvement of 7B2 in PC2 activation, we have investigated the effect of amino-terminal sequential deletions. Deleted 7B2s were tested in four functional assays: binding to proPC2; facilitation of its maturation in stably transfected AtT-20 cells; and activation of PC2 both in vivo, by transient transfection in CHO cells, andin vitro, using Golgi subcellular fractions enriched in proPC2. As these experiments demonstrated that the 86 amino-terminal residues of 7B2 are not required for PC2 activation, we further investigated the minimum structural determinants of 7B2. We were able to identify a 36-residue peptide that contains the PPNPCP motif, as well as an α-helix and a disulfide bridge, which are all absolutely required for binding to proPC2 and for proPC2 activation.DISCUSSIONThe production of enzymatically active PC2 requires the interaction of its proenzyme with the neuroendocrine protein 7B2 (14Zhu X. Lindberg I. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1641-1650Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Whereas we have been able to delineate the cellular mechanism of the interaction between proPC2 and 7B2 (14Zhu X. Lindberg I. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1641-1650Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 17Muller L. Zhu X. Lindberg I. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 625-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), the analysis at a molecular level remains puzzling (reviewed in Ref. 4Muller L. Lindberg I. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1999; (in press): 63Google Scholar). Interestingly, although intracellular encounter with 7B2 is required for proPC2 activation, the lack of interaction between these two proteins does not prevent the cleavage of the PC2 propeptide. However, the mature enzyme generated under these conditions (lack of intracellular interaction with 7B2) exhibits absolutely no catalytic activity, and this particular maturation process has thus been referred to as “unproductive” propeptide cleavage (16Westphal C.H. Muller L. Zhou A. Bonner-Weir S. Schambelan M. Steiner D.F. Lindberg I. Leder P. Cell. 1999; 96: 689-700Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 17Muller L. Zhu X.

Chem. 1998; 273: 1158-1164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In order to gain a better understanding of the molecular mechanism of 7B2-mediated activation of proPC2, we have investigated the structural requirements of 7B2. We were able to identify a 36-residue peptide that contains a proline-rich motif, a disulfide bridge, and an α-helix. These three determinants are necessary and sufficient to generate a proPC2 species capable of actual activation. This 36-residue peptide (position 86–121) is not localized in the amino-terminal half of 7B2, which is homologous to the chaperonin 60 GroEL (12Braks J.A.M. Martens G.J.M. Cell. 1994; 78: 263-273Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). The lack of importance of this chaperone-like domain for proPC2 activation is in agreement with its weak conservation through evolution. Whereas the sequences ofX. laevis (34Martens G.J. Bussemakers M.J. Jenks B.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 181: 75-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) and mammalian 7B2s (35Martens G.J.M. FEBS Lett. 1988; 234: 160-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 36Mbikay M. Grant S.G.N. Sirois F. Tadros H. Skowronski J. Lazure C. Seidah N.G. Hanahan D. Chretien M. Int. J. Pept.

Endocrinology. 1991; 128: 3228-3236Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) share more than 90% homology, the recent cloning of invertebrate 7B2s, fromLymnea stagnalis (31Spijker S. Smit A.B. Martens G.J.M. Geraerts W.P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4116-4120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), C. elegans (27Lindberg I. Tu B. Muller L. Dickerson I. DNA Cell Biol. 1998; 17: 727-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), andD. melanogaster 2 shows no significant conservation in the amino-terminal half of these 7B2s. Whereas 7B286–150, which excludes the 7B2 chaperone-like domain, could not facilitate proPC2 maturation, the 7B268–150construct was active. These results support the idea that, even though the 7B2 chaperone-like domain is not involved in PC2 activation, the segment corresponding to residues 68–86 of this domain is involved in the facilitation of proPC2 maturation. The role of the NH2-terminal half of 7B2 therefore remains unclear. It is conceivable that, in addition to its role in proPC2 activation, 7B2 is involved in another regulatory function. Our recent analysis of 7B2 null mice showing that this null exhibits a much more severe phenotype than the PC2 null supports the notion that 7B2 may have non-PC2-related roles, which relate to the regulation of either the development or the secretory activity of the intermediate pituitary (16Westphal C.H. Muller L. Zhou A. Bonner-Weir S. Schambelan M. Steiner D.F. Lindberg I. Leder P. Cell. 1999; 96: 689-700Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Such roles could potentially be carried out by the NH2-terminal portion of the molecule, although this idea is purely speculative at present.In agreement with our previous study (26Zhu X. Lamango N.S. Lindberg I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23582-23587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), our new peptide data show that the P91PNPCP96 motif is required for proPC2 activation. Furthermore, the fact that a peptide which begins at cysteine 95 was unable to activate proPC2 is in agreement with the essential role of proline 94 already demonstrated (26Zhu X. Lamango N.S. Lindberg I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23582-23587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In this previous study, we had also shown the involvement of residues 109–121 in binding to proPC2. We have now demonstrated the essential role of the helical structure of this section using mutations that either disrupt the helix (R116P), or modify the distribution of the residues on the surface of the helix (+A115) (Fig. 4 B). In addition to providing evidence for the role of the α-helix, we have identified important residues in this structure. The helical wheel projection of residues 108–121 shows the presence of three negatively charged residues next to two hydrophobic residues (phenylalanine), on the same face of the helix. Whereas the charged residues are not conserved among species, the hydrophobic phenylalanines are, which suggests that they could be functionally important. In agreement with this conservation, mutation of one or two phenylalanine residue(s) (F114A and F114A/F118A) demonstrates their essential role in activation of proPC2. We thus propose that these two hydrophobic residues constitute an important site of interaction between the 7B2 α-helix and proPC2.The third structural element required for binding to proPC2 and for PC2 activation is 7B2's only disulfide. This disulfide involves the cysteine present in the PPNPCP motif. We had already shown that exchanging the position of this cysteine with the fourth proline residue of the motif prevented binding to proPC2 and PC2 activation. We had thus proposed that this effect resulted from the disorganization of the proline-rich motif. Further work had then demonstrated that, even though the formation of 7B2 disulfide is not required for 7B2 maturation and secretion (17Muller L. Zhu X. Lindberg I. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 625-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 32Van Horssen A.M. van Kuppeveld F.J. Martens G.J. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 402-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), the in vivo reduction of disulfide bridges in newly synthesized proteins prevents the interaction between 7B2 and proPC2 (17Muller L. Zhu X. Lindberg I. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 625-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). We have now demonstrated that the presence of the 7B2 disulfide is required for effective interaction with proPC2. The most probable hypothesis that explains the effect of the cysteine 104 mutation is that the disulfide bridge stabilizes the proline-rich motif in a conformation necessary for binding to proPC2. We cannot, however, rule out the possibility that the 7B2 disulfide bridge is more directly involved in the interaction with proPC2 or in PC2 activation, for example by providing a disulfide isomerase activity to 7B2.The presence of both the proline-rich motif and the α-helix in a relatively short peptide suggests that these determinants are involved in both binding to proPC2 and in activation of PC2. In order to test the possibility that one determinant would be responsible for binding only, we performed competition experiments using the control 86–121 peptide and the deleted peptides that contain either the proline-rich motif alone (86–100), or this motif and the disulfide (86–107) or the disulfide and the α-helix (95–121). None of these deleted peptides was able to significantly reduce the PC2 activation induced by the 86–121 peptide, even when used at a concentration in 100-fold excess (data not shown). These results suggest that the 86–121 peptide must acquire a specific conformation that involves all three structural determinants, or that these three determinants bind efficiently to proPC2 when they interact with different sites on proPC2. The previous studies that were aimed at identifying PC2 determinants responsible for binding 7B2 concluded that this interaction most probably involves several domains of proPC2 (33Zhu X. Muller L. Mains R.E. Lindberg I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1158-1164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 38Benjannet S. Lusson J. Savaria D. Chretien M. Seidah N.G.

FEBS Lett. 1998; 428: 37-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The involvement of different 7B2 structural determinants is in agreement with such a conclusion. There are, however, still no data available concerning the crystal structure of any PC, and the structural study of these enzymes is based on the model of the related enzyme subtilisin (40Siezen R. Leunissen J.A. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 501-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (771) Google Scholar, 41Lipkind G. Gong Q. Steiner D.F. J. Biol.

Biophys. 1999; 362: 275-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), whereas the propeptides of the other PCs are initially processed in the ER. A recent study demonstrated that furin-cleaved propeptide remains associated with the mature enzyme (15Anderson E.D. VanSlyke J.K. Thulin C.D. Jean F. Thomas G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1508-1518Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). These authors also suggested that this interaction could be required for furin transport out of the ER. If such a hypothesis also holds true for proPC2, it must occur without actual cleavage of the propeptide. The binding of 7B2 to several proPC2 determinants could thus provide an alternative for the formation of a transport-competent propeptide/mature enzyme complex. 7B2 binding to the proenzyme could protect proPC2 either from premature unproductive processing, or from inactivation of the proenzyme due to exposure to an acidic pH. Indeed, acidification of proPC2-enriched Golgi fractions prior to addition of recombinant 7B2 completely blocks proPC2 activation (17Muller L. Zhu X. Lindberg I. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 625-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). 7B2 could fulfill such a passive role, or it could promote proPC2 activation more actively. In both cases, bringing together several domains of proPC2 through binding to different 7B2 determinants could constitute the actual mechanism of 7B2-mediated activation of proPC2. Our new data suggest that a productive interaction between proPC2 and 7B2 requires a specific conformation not only for proPC2, as previously proposed, but also for 7B2. The characterization of a 36-residue peptide that contains this conformation and that is sufficient for effecting proPC2 activation in a cell-free system should prove helpful for the final molecular analysis of the proPC2 activation mechanism.

Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1641-1650Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), and the COOH-terminal domain of 31 residues is a potent inhibitor of PC2 activity (22Lindberg I. Van den Hurk W.H. Bui C.

Based on the homology between the 90 amino-terminal residues with members of the chaperonin 60 family, 7B2 was originally proposed to act as a molecular chaperone specific for proPC2 (12Braks J.A.M. Martens G.J.M. Cell. 1994; 78: 263-273Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). We have already demonstrated that the 90 amino-terminal residues alone cannot bind to proPC2 (14Zhu X. Lindberg I. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1641-1650Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar); they could nonetheless be involved in PC2 activation. Thus, the function of the amino-terminal half of 7B2 is not yet known. In order to analyze the role of the amino-terminal half of 7B2 and to better understand the involvement of 7B2 in PC2 activation, we have investigated the effect of amino-terminal sequential deletions. Deleted 7B2s were tested in four functional assays: binding to proPC2; facilitation of its maturation in stably transfected AtT-20 cells; and activation of PC2 both in vivo, by transient transfection in CHO cells, andin vitro, using Golgi subcellular fractions enriched in proPC2. As these experiments demonstrated that the 86 amino-terminal residues of 7B2 are not required for PC2 activation, we further investigated the minimum structural determinants of 7B2. We were able to identify a 36-residue peptide that contains the PPNPCP motif, as well as an α-helix and a disulfide bridge, which are all absolutely required for binding to proPC2 and for proPC2 activation. DISCUSSIONThe production of enzymatically active PC2 requires the interaction of its proenzyme with the neuroendocrine protein 7B2 (14Zhu X. Lindberg I. J.

Receptor stimulation promotes the dissociation of G protein into a GTP-bound α subunit and a βγ dimer, both of which independently regulate intracellular effectors. Many studies have shown that the βγ dimer regulates adenylyl cyclase, phospholipase Cβ, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase γ, receptor kinase, K+ channels, and Ca2+ channels (1Iñiguez-Lluhi J. Kleuss C.

Different βγ complexes do not have equivalent abilities to couple α subunits to receptors or to regulate effectors. For example, the β1 and β3 are selectively involved in the signal transduction cascades from somatostatin and muscarinic M4 receptors, respectively, to voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels (12Kleuss C.

The βγ complex containing γ1 is less effective than βγ complexes containing the other γ subunits in inhibiting calmodulin-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity, enhancing Gαs-stimulating type II adenylyl cyclase activity, stimulating phospholipase Cβ3 activity, and stimulating the cardiac K+ channel (13Logothetis D.E.

These studies demonstrated that β1 binds all γ subunits, β2 binds most γ isoforms but not γ1 and γ11, and β3 does not bind any γ subunits. Recently, the yeast two-hybrid system was applied to obtain a more sensitive measure of the interaction between the five β isoforms and six of the γ isoforms, including γ1, γ2, γ3, γ4, γ5, and γ7 (18Yan K. Kalyanaraman V. Gautam N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7141-7146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The data showed that all γ isoforms interact well with β1 and β2, but poorly with β3 and β4, while brain-specific γ3 and γ4 interact with β5, which is present only in the brain in the mouse (7Watson A.J. Katz A. Simon M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22150-22156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), although a recent study showed that β5 was expressed in multiple tissues in humans (19Jones P.G. Lombardi S.J. Cockett M.I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1402: 288-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). However, the selectivity of interaction between β and γ subunits in various tissues and normal cells has not been fully studied. Analyses of purified βγ complexes composed of different γ isoforms showed that all of them contained both β1 and β2, except for the transducin β1γ1 (14Asano T. Morishita R. Matsuda T. Fukada Y.

Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24782-24788Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), β5 and β5Lproteins were detected in the mouse brain (7Watson A.J. Katz A. Simon M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22150-22156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and retina (8Watson A.J. Aragay A.M. Slepak V.Z. Simon M.I. J. Biol.

Rosskopf D. Siffert G. Busch S. Moritz A. Erbel R. Sharma A.M. Ritz E. Wichmann H.-E. Jakobs K.H. Horsthemke B. Nat. Genet. 1998; 18: 45-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (738) Google Scholar), but the β4 protein has not been identified yet.In this study, we first identified the β4 protein in the preparation of βγ5 complex purified from bovine lung. Then we examined the selectivity of association between β and γ subunits in bovine tissues, and found a selective association of β4 with γ5 and γ12.RESULTSThe βγ5 complexes were purified from bovine lung by successive DEAE-Sephacel, Ultrogel AcA 34, heptylamine-Sepharose, phenyl-5PW, and DEAE-5PW column chromatography (Figs.1 and 2). When the cholate extract was subjected to chromatography on DEAE-Sephacel, the fractions containing βγ were partially separated from the main fractions that contained GTPγS binding activity (14Asano T. Morishita R. Matsuda T. Fukada Y. Yoshizawa T. Kato K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20512-20519Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and βγ5-rich fractions were included in the former fractions (Fig. 1 A). βγ5-Rich fractions were also eluted from Ultrogel AcA 34 in the fractions containing dissociated βγ, which co-eluted with GTPγS binding activities derived from small GTP-binding proteins (Fig. 1 B). Because the content of βγ5 was small, chromatography on DEAE-Sephacel and Ultrogel AcA 34 was carried out twice each, and the combined fractions were applied to a heptylamine-Sepharose column. The βγ5-rich fractions from the heptylamine-Sepharose column were then subjected to phenyl-5PW column chromatography. Unbound contaminating proteins were washed out, and βγ fractions, which were eluted with increasing concentrations of sodium cholate, were collected (data not shown) and applied to a DEAE-5PW column. The βγ5 fractions were eluted with a buffer containing 50 mm NaCl, and βγ complexes containing the other γ subunits were eluted with a linear gradient of NaCl (Fig. 2). Silver staining of the β subunits revealed that all fractions contained two or more isoforms (Fig. 2 B). Immunoblotting with antibodies recognizing β1 and β2 showed that the upper bands in all fractions were β1, and the lower bands in the later-eluting fractions were β2. By contrast, the lower bands in the earlier-eluting fractions, which were co-eluted with γ5 and cross-reacted slightly with the antibody against the β protein, did not react with the antibody against β2, but reacted with a newly developed antibody against β4 (Fig. 2 B).To examine whether this β subunit was indeed β4, Fraction 6 (Fig. 2) was digested with lysyl endopeptidase and the fragments were analyzed by Edman degradation. The amino acid sequences of three fragments coincided with the internal sequences of β4 (6von Weizsäcker E. Strathmann M.P. Simon M.I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 183: 350-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar): AXNDATLVQITSNMD (Ala24-Asp38), IYAMHWGYDSRLLVSASQDGK (Ile58-Lys78), and MHAIPLRSSWV (Met90-Val100). These results indicated that the fast-migrating β in the βγ5 fractions is β4. This is the first identification of β4protein in tissues.The reactivity of the antibody against β4 was examined with four forms of β subunits (Fig. 3). Because the recombinant His-tagged proteins were used as pure β2 and β3 proteins, they showed higher molecular masses than those of β1 and β4 on SDS-polyacrylamide gels. The antibody reacted strongly with β4 and very weakly with β1 and β2, but not with β3.The co-purification of β4 with γ5 subunits demonstrated in Fig. 2 suggests selective association of the β and γ isoforms in the tissues. To examine this possibility, we carried out immunoprecipitation of βγ complexes from bovine brain and lung with specific antibodies against γ2, γ3, γ5, and γ12, and analyzed the β subunit composition in the immunoprecipitates. Each antibody used selectively immunoprecipitated the respective γ subunit as shown with immunoblots (Fig. 4). However, the fractions immunoprecipitated from the brain with antibodies against γ5 and γ12 contained small amounts of γ2 and γ7, probably due to the high concentrations of γ2 and γ7, in contrast to the low concentrations of γ5 and γ12, in the bovine brain (24Asano T. Morishita R. Ohashi K. Nagahama M. Miyake T. Kato K. J. Neurochem. 1995; 64: 1267-1273Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 30Morishita R. Fukada Y. Kokame K. Yoshizawa T. Masuda K. Niwa M. Kato K. Asano T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 210: 1061-1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Analyses of the individual β subunits revealed remarkable variations in the levels of β4 among the immunoprecipitates. The largest amounts of β4 were present in fractions containing γ5, and significant amounts of β4 were found in fractions containing γ12 from both brain and lung extracts. Small amounts of β4 were also observed in the immunoprecipitates containing γ2 from both tissues, but the level of β4 was negligible in the fraction containing γ3 (Fig. 4). These results suggest that the β4 associates with the γ subunit isoforms in bovine tissues with the following rank order of selectivity: γ5> γ12 > γ2 > γ3. In contrast to β4, there were significant small amounts of β2 in the fractions containing γ5immunoprecipitated from extracts of both brain and lung, and similar amounts of β2 were present in the fractions containing γ2, γ3, and γ12. This indicates a poor selectivity of γ5 for β2in these tissues. On the other hand, all immunoprecipitates contained similar amounts of β1, in agreement with previous reports (10Ray K. Kunsch C.

Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 3929-3936Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). We did not examine the presence of β3 and β5, because we did not have reliable antibodies for these isoforms and the respective standard proteins for use as specific molecular weight marker.Figure 4Analyses of β subunit compositions in the immunoprecipitates from extracts of bovine brain and lung with antibodies against various γ subunits. The βγ complexes were immunoprecipitated from extracts of bovine brain (lanes 2–5) and lung (lanes 6–8) with antibodies against γ2 (lanes 2and 6), γ3 (lane 3), γ5 (lanes 4 and 7), or γ12 (lanes 5 and 8). Standard proteins (lane 1) and immunoprecipitates were subjected to SDS-PAGE for β, or Tricine/SDS-PAGE for γ subunits, and then immunoblotted with antibodies against β protein (β1), β2, β4, γ7, and γ5. Because the antibody against γ7 reacted with γ2, γ3, γ7, and γ12 (24Asano T. Morishita R. Ohashi K. Nagahama M. Miyake T. Kato K. J. Neurochem. 1995; 64: 1267-1273Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), it was used to detect these γ isoforms together. The standards (from top to bottom) were purified βγ2, βγ7, βγ5, a mixture of βγ3, βγ2 and βγ7, and βγ5. The results shown are representative of three independent experiments that yielded similar results. The intensity of each band of the three β isoforms was quantified by densitometry using the NIH Image program, and the relative densities (means of three experiments) are shownbelow each panel. The densities of the bands obtained with the immunoprecipitates from both tissue extracts with the antibody against γ2 (lanes 2 and 6) were taken as 100.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Since the β and γ subunits associate tightly with each other under physiological conditions, the compositions of the β subunit isoforms in purified βγ complexes containing different γ isoforms are expected to be similar to those found in the immunoprecipitates described above. We then analyzed βγ complexes containing different γ isoforms purified from bovine brain, lung, and kidney (Fig.5), although βγ5 and βγ12 could not be purified from the brain. The silver staining of β subunits indicated that all preparations contained β1 as the major β subunit, plus various amounts of β2 and β4, which migrated faster than β1 in SDS-polyacrylamide gels (β4 migrated slightly faster than β2) (Fig. 5). The βγ2 complexes purified from both lung and brain contained similar amounts of β2 and small amounts of β4. The βγ3 and βγ7complexes purified from the brain also contained β2, but contained only negligible amounts of β4. Different preparations of βγ2, βγ3, and βγ7 complexes gave similar results. As shown in Fig. 2, βγ5 purified from the lung contained a large amount of β4 and a negligible amount of β2 (Fig. 5), but one out of three preparations of βγ5 contained a significant amount of β2 in addition to β4(data not shown). By contrast, βγ12 complexes purified from lung and kidney showed different compositions of β isoforms. The lung βγ12 contained β4, but only a negligible amount of β2, while kidney βγ12 contained both β2 and β4 (Fig. 5). Four other preparations of the βγ12 complexes purified from lung and kidney consisted of various ratios of β2 and β4, probably due to slight differences in the separations by column chromatography. These results were basically consistent with the selectivity observed in the immunoprecipitates.Figure 5Analyses of β subunit compositions in purified βγ complexes containing different γ isoforms. The βγ complexes containing different γ isoforms purified from bovine brain, lung, and kidney were subjected to SDS-PAGE for β, or Tricine/SDS-PAGE for γ subunits.

The results suggest that the affinity of β4 for γ5 and γ12may be higher than that for other γ isoforms. However, it is also possible that β4 is expressed together with γ5 or γ12 in the certain type of cells in the brain and lung, because multiple cell types are present in these tissues. Analyses of cloned cells, which contain multiple β and γ subunits, including β4 and γ5 or γ12, should resolve this issue, but unfortunately β4 was not detectable in several such cell lines tested. In any case, the present study indicates that specific association of β4 with certain γ subunits occurs endogenously in cells.Some of our results are consistent with results previously obtained using a transfected cell assay system (16Pronin A.N. Gautam N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6220-6224Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), in vitrotranslation system (10Ray K. Kunsch C. Bonner L.M. Robishaw J.D. J. Biol.

Chem. 1992; 267: 13807-13810Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the yeast two-hybrid system (18Yan K. Kalyanaraman V. Gautam N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7141-7146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Namely, β1 interacts with all γ subunits and β2 interacts with most γ subunit except for γ1 and γ11. However, the selectivity of association between the β and γ5 isoforms that we observed in the tissues is inconsistent with the results from the yeast two-hybrid system (18Yan K. Kalyanaraman V. Gautam N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7141-7146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) in some respects: γ5 interacted well with β2 but poorly with β4 in the two-hybrid system, whereas in the bovine tissues, γ5associated well with β4, but poorly with β2. In addition, the yeast two-hybrid system showed that γ3 interacts well with all the β isoforms (18Yan K. Kalyanaraman V. Gautam N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7141-7146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), but the present study indicated that γ3 does not interact with β4. Although the reason for the discrepancies in these experiments is not clear, incomplete post-translational modification of the subunits in the yeast cells may be partially responsible. It is possible that some β isoforms have no chance to interact with certain γ isoforms in the cells because of cell-specific expression of those isoforms.Because β4 appears to preferentially associate with γ5 and γ12 rather than with γ2 and γ3, a sequence common to γ5 and γ12 in the regions which interact with the β4 subunit is predicted. Although the amino acid homology between γ5 and γ12 is only 44%, which is much less than that between γ2 and γ12 (63%), there is only one residue, Gln15in γ5, that is conserved between γ5 and γ12 but not among other γ isoforms. The N-terminal region containing Gln15 is known to form a coiled-coil and to interact with a similar coiled-coil region in the N terminus of the β subunit (31Sondek J. Bohm A. Lambright D.G. Hamm H.E. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1996; 379: 369-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (707) Google Scholar, 32Wall M.A. Coleman D.E. Lee E. Iniguez-Lluhi J.A. Posner B.A. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Cell. 1995; 83: 1047-1058Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1005) Google Scholar). Therefore, this common residue seems likely to be important for the interaction with the N terminus of β4.In contrast with the poor selectivity of β1 and β2 for the γ isoforms, except for γ1 and γ11, β4 shows specific association with γ5 and γ12. This selectivity of β4 may be important for the signal transduction discrimination by various βγ complexes. The concentrations of β4 are much lower than those of β1 and β2 in the tissues. If β4 is capable of forming a dimer with all γ isoforms, the concentration of each β4γx complex might be insignificantly low in the cells in which multiple β and γ isoforms are co-expressed. However, the association of β4 with a specific γ isoform, γ5 or γ12, could increase the concentration of the β4γ5 or β4γ12 complex in the same cells. Although the physiological functions of the individual complexes are not clear at this time, the selective association might contribute to maintaining efficient and specific signal transduction mediated by G proteins. Heterotrimeric G proteins 1The abbreviations used are: G protein, guanine nucleotide-binding protein; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethylglycine1The abbreviations used are: G protein, guanine nucleotide-binding protein; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethylglycine are composed of α, β, and γ subunits, the latter two being tightly associated under physiological conditions (1Iñiguez-Lluhi J.

Receptor stimulation promotes the dissociation of G protein into a GTP-bound α subunit and a βγ dimer, both of which independently regulate intracellular effectors. Many studies have shown that the βγ dimer regulates adenylyl cyclase, phospholipase Cβ, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase γ, receptor kinase, K+ channels, and Ca2+ channels (1Iñiguez-Lluhi J. Kleuss C.

Different βγ complexes do not have equivalent abilities to couple α subunits to receptors or to regulate effectors. For example, the β1 and β3 are selectively involved in the signal transduction cascades from somatostatin and muscarinic M4 receptors, respectively, to voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels (12Kleuss C. Scherubl H. Hescheler J. Schultz G. Wittig B. Nature. 1992; 358: 424-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). The βγ complex containing γ1 is less effective than βγ complexes containing the other γ subunits in inhibiting calmodulin-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity, enhancing Gαs-stimulating type II adenylyl cyclase activity, stimulating phospholipase Cβ3 activity, and stimulating the cardiac K+ channel (13Logothetis D.E.

These data suggest that cellular responses to receptor stimulation may vary as a function of the βγ complexes found in the target cells.

However, the signaling events that control growth or differentiation are not completely understood. In order to identify new signaling molecules interacting with the cytoplasmic domain of Flt3, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screen. In addition to several SH2 domain-containing proteins, we have isolated a novel Flt3interacting zinc finger protein (Fiz1) with 11 C2H2-type zinc fingers. Fiz1 binds to the catalytic domain of Flt3 but not to the structurally related receptor tyrosine kinases Kit, Fms, and platelet-derived growth factor receptor.

In order to understand the specific function of Flt3, it is necessary to understand its signaling pathways in more detail.

In this report we describe the isolation of a novel C2H2 zinc finger protein and its specific interaction with the catalytic domain of Flt3 in a kinase-independent manner.

The murine hematopoietic cell lines BaF3, BaF3/Flt3, and BaF3/MT-Fiz1/Flt3 were grown in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum (HyClone), 5% iron-supplemented calf serum (HyClone), and 0.2% conditioned medium of X63-IL-3 cells expressing recombinant IL-3 (38Karasuyama H. Melchers F. Eur. J. Immunol. 1988; 18: 97-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (1081) Google Scholar). The BaF3/Flt3 cell line was generated by infection of BaF3 cells with the pJZen2-Flt3 retroviral vector. Infected cells were sorted for receptor expression by flow cytometry using a polyclonal antibody (antibody 8580) against the extracellular domain of Flt3. The BaF3/MT-Fiz1/Flt3 cell line was generated by electroporating the expression plasmid Rc/CMV-MT-Fiz1 into the parental cell line BaF3 and selecting for G418-resistant clones. After screening for MT-Fiz1 expression, cells were infected with Flt3 as described above. HEK293T and NIH3T3 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 5% fetal calf serum and 5% iron-supplemented calf serum. The antibody 8580 against the extracellular domain of Flt3 was obtained by immunizing rabbits with Rab9 cells expressing the murine Flt3 receptor. The antibodies 270J and 9767I against the intracellular domain of Flt3 were generated by immunizing rabbits with a bacterially expressed 6×His fusion protein containing residues 788–1000 of the murine Flt3 receptor which was purified as inclusion bodies and solubilized in 0.1% SDS with boiling. The antibody 9704 against Fiz1 was obtained by immunizing rabbits with a bacterially expressed and affinity purified glutathioneS-transferase (GST) fusion protein containing residues 254–500 (ZF7-11) of the murine Fiz1 protein. Anti-Fiz1 serum was affinity purified by passage through a column of covalently linked GST protein. The flow-through was collected and bound to a column of covalently linked GST-Fiz1/ZF7-11 fusion protein. Affinity purified antibodies were eluted with low pH. The PCR-amplified cytoplasmic domain of the wild-type murine Flt3 receptor (aa 565–1000) was cloned in frame into the LexA-DNA binding domain vector pBTM116 (39Vojtek A.B. Hollenberg S.M. Cooper J.A.

Methods Enzymol. 1995; 255: 331-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Briefly, Saccharomyces cerevisiae L40 was sequentially transformed with the LexA-Flt3 bait plasmid and 400 μg of a cDNA library, which was made from EML-C1 cells fused to the VP16 transcriptional activation domain (41Lioubin M.N. Algate P.A. Tsai S. Carlberg K. Aebersold A. Rohrschneider L.R. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1084-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). A total of 9 × 106 transformed colonies were screened on plates lacking tryptophan, histidine, uracil, leucine, and lysine (-WHULK) but containing 50 mm 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole (Sigma) and X-gal. Specificity of positive interactors was tested by mating assays (40Vojtek A.B. Hollenberg S.M. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 255: 331-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Plasmid DNA was isolated from five clones, which were positive for β-galactosidase activity yeast, and the VP16 library inserts were PCR-amplified. PCR products were gel-purified and directly sequenced with Applied Biosystems PRISMTM terminator (Perkin-Elmer). Obtained sequences were analyzed using the BLAST program on the World Wide Web. An EML-C1 cDNA library constructed with the ZAP-cDNA synthesis kit (Stratagene) (41Lioubin M.N. Algate P.A. Tsai S. Carlberg K. Aebersold A. Rohrschneider L.R. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1084-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar) was used to isolate overlapping Fiz1 cDNA clones which were sequenced on both strands. The 5′-UTR was cloned by PCR using a FDC-P1/Mac11 cDNA library as template, T3 as 5′ primer annealing to vector sequence, and oligonucleotide 3′ZF4 (5′-TGTGTGAATTCATCACACGTTGCAACATACTGAGC-3′) as 3′ primer annealing to Fiz1 cDNA. ABamHI fragment encoding the whole ORF of Fiz1 was cloned into the BglII site of the pCS3+MT vector (kindly provided by J. A. Cooper, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA) (42Turner D.L. Weintraub H. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1434-1447Crossref PubMed Scopus (954) Google Scholar) resulting in 6× Myc epitope-tagged Fiz1 fusion protein. pCS3+MT-Fiz1 was digested with HindIII/XbaI, and the fragment containing MT-Fiz1 was cloned into the expression plasmid pRc/CMV (Invitrogen). To test related RTKs for their interaction with Fiz1, the cytoplasmic domains of the murine c-kit receptor (aa 543–975), the murine c-Fms receptor (aa 536–976; (33Bourette R.P. Myles G.M. Choi J.L.

To analyze further the site of interaction of Fiz1 with the Flt3 receptor, a series of mutated Flt3 receptor constructs were created by PCR and fused to LexA by cloning in frame into pBTM116. The following constructs were generated (aa contained in the construct are indicated in parentheses): kinase inactive Flt3-K645A (aa 565–1000; Lys645 → Ala); deletion of the juxtamembrane domain Flt3-ΔJM (aa 609–1000); deletion of the kinase insert domain Flt3-ΔKI (aa 565–711 fused to aa 786–1000); deletion of the C-terminal tail Flt3-ΔCT (aa 565–953); juxtamembrane domain of Flt3, Flt3-JM (aa 565–608); juxtamembrane domain and ATP binding domain of Flt3, Flt3-JM+TKI (aa 565–711); catalytic domain and C-terminal tail of Flt3, Flt3-TKII+CT (aa 786–1000). As described previously, all constructs were tested for their ability to undergo autophosphorylation (33Bourette R.P. Myles G.M. Choi J.L. Rohrschneider L.R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5880-5893Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Construction of the catalytic domain swap mutants utilized overlap extension PCR mutagenesis (43Higuchi R. Innis M.A. Gelfand D.H. Sninsky J.J. PCR Protocols: A Guide to Methods and Applications. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego1990: 177-183Google Scholar). Codons 784 and 785 of murine Flt3 and codons 771 and 772 of the murine Fms receptor were changed to introduce an NcoI restriction site. Codons 955 and 956 of murine Flt3 and codons 917 and 918 of the murine Fms receptor were mutated to introduce a KpnI restriction site. Mutated fragments were cloned into pBTM116 using the BamHI restriction site, generating the plasmids LexA-Flt3-NK (N784H, V785G, E955V, and A956P) and LexA-Fms-NK (R771H, P772G, D917V, and Q918P). By using theNcoI and KpnI restriction sites, the swap mutants LexA-Flt3/TKII-Fms and LexA-Fms/TKII-Flt3, respectively, were cloned by standard restriction digest and ligation. All constructs were sequenced to confirm correct mutagenesis. To test for interaction, LexA plasmids were transformed into yeast strain AMR70. VP16 plasmids were transformed into yeast strain L40. Mating assays were performed as described previously (40Vojtek A.B. Hollenberg S.M. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 255: 331-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar), and interaction of various mutants (Fig. 3) was visualized by spotting cells onto -WHULK plates containing 50 mm3-amino-1,2,4-triazole and X-gal. Color of colonies was recorded after 3 days. GST-Fiz1 (wild type) fusion protein was prepared by cloning theBamHI-EcoRI fragment of the originally isolated clone VP16-EML33 in frame into pGEX-3X (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). After transformation into Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) (Novagen), GST or GST-Fiz1 (wild type) fusion proteins were induced and were affinity purified on glutathione-agarose resin (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in PBS, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm PMSF. [35S]Methionine-labeled Flt3 was obtained by cloning the cytoplasmic domain into the vector pET14b (Novagen), and in vitro transcription/translation was done using the STP2, T7 system (Novagen). Lysates were precleared by incubating with GST protein bound to beads and then used for binding reactions with 1 μg of GST or 1 μg of GST-Fiz1 protein in IVT-150 buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 5 μm ZnCl2, 1% Nonidet P-40). Interacting complexes were washed 3 times with IVT-750 buffer (IVT buffer with 750 mm NaCl) and eluted by boiling in 2× Laemmli buffer. Proteins were separated on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and bound proteins were visualized by autoradiography. 1.3 × 107 cells of the BaF3 or BaF3/Flt3 cell line were lysed by sonication in IVT-150 buffer (supplemented with 1 mm PMSF, 20 μg/ml aprotinin). Lysates were cleared by centrifugation and precleared by incubation with GST protein bound to beads. Supernatants were incubated with 5 μg of GST or GST-Fiz1 protein in IVT-150 buffer, washed 3 times with IVT-150 buffer, and eluted by boiling in 2× Laemmli buffer. Proteins were separated on a 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, transferred to nitrocellulose membrane, and blotted with anti-Flt3 antiserum 270J. BaF3/MT-Fiz1/Flt3 cells (2.5 × 107/sample) were starved in RPMI, 1% FBS for 3 h, washed in PBS, stimulated with 1 μg/ml Flt3 ligand (FL, a kind gift of Immunex, Seattle, WA) for 5 min at 37 °C, and lysed by sonication in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (50 mm NaCl, 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.3, 30 mmNa4P2O7, 50 mm NaF, 5 μm ZnCl2, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm PMSF, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 mmorthovanadate). Lysates were cleared of cell debris by centrifugation and subsequently precleared for 30 min at 4 °C with 5 μl of preimmune serum and 20 μl protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Supernatants (equalized for protein amount) were used for immunoprecipitation (IP) and incubated overnight with 20 μl of affinity purified anti-Fiz1 antibody and 20 μl of protein A-Sepharose. IPs were washed 3 times with lysis buffer and eluted by boiling in 2× Laemmli buffer. Proteins were separated on a 6.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane on a semi-dry blotting apparatus (Ellard Instrumentation Ltd., Seattle, WA). After probing with antibodies as indicated, immunocomplexes were visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence (NEN Life Science Products). Fractionation was done as described previously (44Lewis J.M. Baskaran R. Taagepera S. Schwartz M.A. Wang J.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 15174-15179Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). In brief, cells (2.5 × 107/fractionation) were washed once in ice-cold PBS and once in hypotonic buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm PMSF, 20 μg of aprotinin). Cells were lysed in hypotonic buffer using a Dounce homogenizer (tight fitting pestle, 20–30 strokes). Nuclei were spun down at 800 × g, and the nuclear pellet was washed twice in hypotonic buffer and further purified by resuspending in 0.4 ml of hypotonic buffer containing 0.5 m sucrose, 0.1% Triton X-100 and centrifuging through a cushion of 1 ml of hypotonic buffer containing 1 m sucrose, 0.1% Triton X-100. Nuclei were lysed by sonication in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (0.5% Nonidet P-40). Membranes were separated from the cytoplasmic fraction by high speed centrifugation (100,000 × g), and the pellet containing the membranes was resuspended in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer. Fractions were analyzed by IP/Western blot. NIH3T3 cells were plated sparsely on fibronectin (Sigma)-coated coverslips. Cells were grown for 1–2 days, washed with cold PBS, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (Sigma) in PBS, and permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS. Cells were blocked for nonspecific antibody-binding sites by incubation with PBS, 5% FBS. Primary and secondary antibody incubations were done at room temperature in PBS, 5% FBS. Immunodetection of Fiz1 was accomplished with anti-Fiz1 antibody 9704 (affinity purified, diluted 1:50) followed by fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit antibody (H+L) (Jackson ImmunoResearch). Nuclei were stained using 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole reagent (Sigma). Indirect fluorescence was detected with a Deltavision SA3.1 Wide-field Deconvolution Microscope (Applied Precision Inc.). Total RNA of various cell lines or mouse tissues was extracted with guanidinium isothiocyanate and purified by centrifugation through a 5.7 m CsCl gradient (45Chirgwin J.M. Przybyla A.E. MacDonald R.J. Rutter W.J. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5294-5299Crossref PubMed Scopus (16652) Google Scholar). By using oligo(dT)-cellulose (New England Biolabs) affinity purification, poly(A)+ RNA was isolated from mouse tissue total RNA. 20 μg of total RNA or 3 μg of poly(A)+ RNA were separated on 1.2% agarose, 0.6 m formaldehyde gels, transferred to GeneScreen membrane (NEN Life Science Products), hybridized, and washed as recommended by the manufacturer. To identify novel signaling intermediates of the receptor tyrosine kinase Flt3, we employed the yeast two-hybrid system. The hybrid bait consisted of the DNA binding/dimerization domain of LexA and the cytoplasmic region of murine Flt3 (4Rosnet O. Marchetto S. deLapeyriere O. Birnbaum D. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 1641-1650PubMed Google Scholar, 5Matthews W. Jordan C.T. Wiegand G.W. Pardoll D. Lemischka I.R. Cell. 1991; 65: 1143-1152Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). A screen of 9 × 106 primary transformants of an EML-C1 cDNA expression library (41Lioubin M.N. Algate P.A. Tsai S. Carlberg K. Aebersold A. Rohrschneider L.R. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1084-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar) yielded five potential positive clones detected by strong β-galactosidase activity. We obtained known SH2 domain-containing proteins including the p85 subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase, 3BP-2, 3S. Ilangumaran, I. Wolf, F. Gertler, J. LaRose, P. Bhoi, C. Paganin, M. Anafi, L. R. Rohrschneider, and R. Rottapel, submitted for publication. Nck, and ShcB, and a novel protein we named Fiz1 (Flt3 interactingzinc finger protein 1). Several overlapping cDNA clones for Fiz1 were isolated by screening an EML-C1 cDNA library. To ensure the complete ORF was represented, two different 5′-untranslated regions (5′-UTR) were cloned by PCR using an FDC-P1/Mac11 cDNA library (41Lioubin M.N. Algate P.A. Tsai S. Carlberg K. Aebersold A. Rohrschneider L.R. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1084-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar) as template. The two transcripts, 2,587 and 2,595 base pairs in length, contained a single open reading frame (ORF) encoding a protein of 500 aa (Fig.1 A) with a calculated molecular mass of 52 kDa. The predicted initiator methionine codon is contained within the context of a consensus translational initiation sequence defined for higher eukaryotes (47Kozak M. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 197-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). Upstream of the common first ATG codon we found an in-frame stop codon in both 5′-UTRs. Sequence comparison revealed that the initial 1.6-kilobase pair Fiz1 cDNA clone (EML-33) obtained from the two-hybrid library contained the full-length ORF. Data base searches indicated that Fiz1 encodes a novel protein with homology to numerous zinc finger proteins. As shown in Fig. 1, Fiz1 contains 11 putative zinc finger domains (ZF1-ZF11) matching the consensus C2H2 zinc finger motif (48Evans R.M. Hollenberg S.M. Cell. 1988; 52: 1-3Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1 B). The only exceptions from the consensus are seen in ZF7, which shows a separation of the two conserved cysteine residues with one instead of two amino acids, and in ZF8 which has a conservative Phe → Tyr substitution. The short sequence between the ZF domains follows, to a high degree, the defined sequence of the H/C link (49Berg J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 99-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). The zinc fingers are distributed throughout the protein and occur in clusters of four, two, two, and three (Fig.1 C). The pattern of Fiz1 expression was examined by Northern blot analysis of RNA from various mouse cell lines and tissues (Fig. 2). A single RNA species of 2.6 kilobase pairs was detected in all hematopoietic and non-hematopoietic cell lines tested but to a lower degree in Bac.1, Raw264.7, and WEHI cells. In addition, it was found to be expressed constitutively in all mouse tissues examined (brain, heart, kidney, liver, lung, skeletal muscle, pancreas, spleen, thymus, and uterus). To analyze the interaction of Flt3 with Fiz1 in more detail, different Flt3 mutants were tested for interaction in the yeast two-hybrid system (Fig. 3). Replacing the lysine 645 within the ATP-binding site of the kinase domain with an alanine (K645A) results in a kinase-defective Flt3 mutant that binds Fiz1 with the same strength as wild-type Flt3 (Fig. 3 B). In contrast, Fiz1 does not bind to the cytoplasmic domain of the structurally related receptor tyrosine kinases Fms, Kit, and PDGFR (Fig. 3 B). Therefore, Fiz1 binds specifically to Flt3 in a kinase-independent manner. To determine what re"
https://openalex.org/W2013710848,"Previous studies on bovine opsin folding and assembly have identified an amino-terminal fragment, EF(1–232), which folds and inserts into a membrane only after coexpression with its complementary carboxyl-terminal fragment, EF(233–348). To further characterize this interaction, EF(1–232) production was examined upon coexpression with carboxyl-terminal fragments of varying length and/or amino acid composition. These included fragments with incremental deletions of the third cytoplasmic loop (TH(241–348) and EF(249–348)), a fragment composed of the third cytoplasmic loop and sixth transmembrane helix (HF(233–280)), a fragment composed of the sixth and seventh transmembrane helices (FG(249–312)), and EF(233–348) and TH(241–348) fragments with Pro-267 or Trp-265 mutations. Although EF(1–232) production was independent of the third cytoplasmic loop and carboxyl-terminal tail, both the sixth and seventh transmembrane helices were essential. The effects of mutations in the sixth transmembrane helix on EF(1–232) expression were dependent on the length of the third cytoplasmic loop. Although Pro-267 mutations in EF(233–348) failed to stabilize EF(1–232) expression, their introduction into TH(241–348) was without discernible effects. However, Trp-265 substitutions in the EF(233–348) and TH(241–348) fragments conferred significant EF(1–232) production. Therefore, key residues in the transmembrane helices may exert their effects on opsin folding, assembly, and/or function by influencing the conformation of the connecting loops.

Rhodopsin is the photoreceptor that mediates vision in dim light. Bovine rhodopsin is composed of the apoprotein opsin, a single polypeptide chain of 348 amino acids, and an 11-cis-retinal chromophore (1Ovchinnikov Y.A. Abdulaev N.G. Feigina M.Y. Artamonov I.D.

These seven membrane-spanning helices form a binding pocket for the retinal chromophore (5Khorana H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1-4Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Light-induced conformational changes in rhodopsin mediated by retinal isomerization expose cytoplasmic binding sites for the heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding protein (G-protein), the interface between the receptor and effector molecules in visual transduction (6Hargrave P.A. McDowell J.H. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1992; 137B: 49-97PubMed Google Scholar, 7Chabre M. Breton J. Vision Res. 1979; 19: 1005-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar).An understanding of how rhodopsin adopts its tertiary structure is important not only to clarify details of the folding and assembly process but also to gain insight into the severe visual impairments occurring as an immediate consequence of natural mutations affecting opsin structure and function. One approach that has been used successfully to study the mechanism of protein folding and assembly is to use fragments of a polypeptide. In earlier studies (8Ridge K.D. Lee S.S.J. Yao L.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3204-3208Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 9Ridge K.D. Lee S.S.J. Abdulaev N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7860-7867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), we have examined whether expressed complementary bovine opsin fragments separated in the intradiscal, membrane-embedded, and cytoplasmic regions contain sufficient information to independently fold, insert into a membrane, and assemble into a functional pigment. Virtually all of the singly expressed fragments fold to a conformation that allows for membrane insertion and, in some cases, form the rhodopsin chromophore with 11-cis-retinal when coexpressed with their complementary partners. Thus, these results suggest that the functional assembly of bovine rhodopsin is mediated by the association of multiple folding domains and demonstrate the utility of defined polypeptide fragments for studying the mechanism of bovine opsin folding and assembly.We have now focused on the nature and specificity of the fragment interaction(s) by identifying determinants that lead to proper folding, membrane insertion, and assembly. For this purpose, we utilized an amino-terminal five-helix opsin fragment, EF(1–232), which is stably produced only upon coexpression with its corresponding carboxyl-terminal partner, EF(233–348) (9Ridge K.D. Lee S.S.J. Abdulaev N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7860-7867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). This finding suggests that regions within the 1–232 opsin polypeptide do not fold independently of interactions with other domains present in the complementary portion of the polypeptide chain (amino acids 233–348). To study this in greater detail, eight additional carboxyl-terminal bovine opsin fragments were constructed and expressed (Fig.1). These include a fragment composed of the third cytoplasmic loop and sixth TM helix (HF(233–280)), a fragment that lacks the third cytoplasmic loop and carboxyl-terminal tail (FG(249–312)), and EF(233–348) as well as TH(241–348) fragments with Pro-267 → Gly/Leu or Trp-265 → Phe mutations. Two previously reported (8Ridge K.D. Lee S.S.J. Yao L.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3204-3208Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 9Ridge K.D. Lee S.S.J. Abdulaev N.G. J. Biol.

The opsin gene fragments were expressed in COS-1 cells singly or in combination with EF(1–232), and the polypeptide fragments were examined for stable production and their ability to form the rhodopsin chromophore with 11-cis-retinal. Coupled with our earlier findings, the present results suggest that specific amino acid residues in the TM helices can exert their effects on opsin folding, membrane insertion, and/or assembly by influencing the conformation of the solvent exposed connecting loop regions.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialsRestriction endonucleases were from New England Biolabs or Roche Molecular Biochemicals, and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG was from Promega.

J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10035-10038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In some cases, the proteins were analyzed by nonreducing SDS/Tris-tricine PAGE (20Schagger H. Von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10436) Google Scholar) with a 4% stacking and a 10 or 12% resolving gel. Immunoreactive protein was detected using the B6–30N, rho 4D2, K42–41L, rho 1D4, or opi primary antibodies and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG as the second antibody. The protein bands were visualized by chemiluminescence.Other MethodsEnzyme-linked immunosorbent assays were carried out as described (9Ridge K.D. Lee S.S.J. Abdulaev N.G. J. Biol.

Ridge K.D. Knox B.E. Khorana H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6763-6769Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Membrane integration of wild-type opsin or the opsin fragments was determined by incubating the crude membrane preparations with 100 mmNa2CO3, pH 11.0, for 1 h at 4 °C (22Howell K.E. Palade G.E. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 92: 822-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Protein determinations were done using the method of Peterson (23Peterson G.L. Anal. Biochem. 1977; 83: 346-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (7088) Google Scholar) with bovine serum albumin as the standard.RESULTSExpression of the Opsin Fragments in COS-1 CellsThe Singly Expressed Carboxyl-terminal Bovine Opsin FragmentsCellular expression of the opsin fragments (TableI) was examined by immunoblotting whole cell detergent extracts with the rho 1D4, K42–41L, or opi primary antibodies. All of the singly expressed carboxyl-terminal fragments were stably produced in COS-1 cells (Fig.2). A polypeptide of ∼15 kDa was noted for the HF(233–280) fragment (Fig. 2 A), which is considerably higher than the calculated molecular mass of ∼5.5 kDa. Similarly, the EF(249–312) polypeptide (molecular mass = ∼17 kDa) also migrated at a position much higher than the calculated molecular mass (∼7.2 kDa). This most likely arises from an intrinsic property of many membrane proteins (and membrane protein fragments) to show anomalous migration on SDS-PAGE (9Ridge K.D. Lee S.S.J. Abdulaev N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7860-7867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 24Tanford C. Reynolds J.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1976; 457: 133-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar). Importantly, both of these fragments required detergent for cellular extraction, suggesting that they are membrane integrated. Although the EF(233–348) and TH(241–348) fragments showed the appropriate size by SDS-PAGE, the corresponding fragments with Pro-267 mutations migrated at a slightly higher apparent molecular mass than their wild-type counterparts (Fig.2, C and D). Replacement of Pro-267 by Gly and Leu presumably alters the conformation of the polypeptide fragment even in the presence of high concentrations of SDS. The spectral and functional properties of these Pro-267 mutations in context of the entire polypeptide chain have been previously reported (25Nakayama T.A. Khorana H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4269-4275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Sung C.-H. Davenport C.M. Nathans J. J. Biol.

A. 1997; 94: 10571-10576Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Notably, the Pro-267→ Leu mutation is associated with autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa (26Sung C.-H. Davenport C.M. Nathans J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26645-26649Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Substitution of Trp-265 by Phe did not alter the migration of the EF(233–348) or Th(241–348) polypeptides. This mutation has been shown to have a profound effect on the spectral properties of rhodopsin (25Nakayama T.A. Khorana H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4269-4275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Ridge K.D. Bhattacharya S. Nakayama T.A. Khorana H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6770-6775Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The levels of carboxyl-terminal fragment production relative to wild-type opsin were estimated from enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. With the exception of the HF(233–348) fragment, the carboxyl-terminal fragments were present at levels equivalent to or higher than that of wild-type opsin (Table I).Figure 2Expression of opsin polypeptide fragments in COS-1 cells. Transiently transfected cells expressing the indicated opsin polypeptides were solubilized in DM detergent, and equivalent amounts of protein (∼25 μg) were analyzed by immunoblotting following nonreducing SDS-PAGE. Opsin and the carboxyl-terminal opsin fragments were detected using the anti-rhodopsin antibodies K42–41L (A), opi (B), and rho 1D4 (C–E). Immunoreactive protein was visualized by chemiluminescence.

As shown previously (9Ridge K.D. Lee S.S.J. Abdulaev N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7860-7867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), although single expression of the EF(1–232) fragment results in two faint polypeptides that are observed sporadically, coexpression of this opsin fragment with EF(233–348) results in stable and reproducible production of a high mannoseN-glycosylated doublet (Fig.3 A). Coexpression of EF(1–232) with TH(241–348) and EF(249–348) resulted in the appearance of the two polypeptides at a level similar to that of coexpression with EF(233–348) (Fig. 2 B and TableII). These findings suggest that the correct folding and membrane insertion of EF(1–232) does not depend on the presence of the third cytoplasmic loop (amino acids 233–249). Coexpression with HF(233–280) did not afford stable production of the EF(1–232) fragment (Fig. 2 B). Similarly, removal of the third cytoplasmic loop and the sixth TM (FG(281–348)) also did not confer stable and reproducible production (Fig. 2 C). However, the EF(249–312) fragment, which lacks the third cytoplasmic loop and carboxyl-terminal tail, resulted in significant EF(1–232) production (Fig. 2 C and Table II). Taken together, the above results suggest that structural elements within the sixth and/or seventh TM influences the stable production of EF(1–232).Figure 3Effect of carboxyl-terminal fragment coexpression on EF(1–232) production. Transiently transfected cells expressing the indicated opsin polypeptides were solubilized in DM detergent, and equivalent amounts of protein (∼25 μg) were analyzed by immunoblotting following nonreducing SDS-PAGE.

Open table in a new tab To further examine the role of the sixth TM in this process, EF(1–232) was coexpressed with EF(233–348) fragments containing Pro-267→ Gly/Leu or Trp-265→Phe mutations. As shown in Fig. 3 D, the presence of the Pro-267 to Gly or Leu mutations in the EF(233–348) fragment essentially abolishes EF(1–232) expression. Surprisingly, introduction of the Pro-267 mutations into the TH(241–348) fragment resulted in the expression of EF(1–232) at levels similar to those of the wild-type fragment (Fig. 3 E and Table II). Similarly, introduction of the Trp-265→ Phe mutation into either the EF(233–348) and TH(241–348) fragments had essentially no effect on the level of EF(1–232) expression (Fig. 3 F and Table II). These findings suggest that the Pro-267 mutations alter the conformation of the third cytoplasmic loop in the region extending from amino acids 233–240 and that this portion of the loop, if present, exerts a stabilizing effect on EF(1–232) expression.Spectral Characterization of the Complexes Formed from the Coexpressed Opsin FragmentsThe EF(1–232) + EF(233–348) fragment complex, like wild-type rhodopsin, shows a 500-nm chromophore after reconstitution with 11-cis-retinal (Fig. 4). The yield of this fragment complex relative to wild-type rhodopsin varied from ∼25 to 40%. Previous attempts to isolate a rhodopsin-like pigment composed of these fragments on immobilized rho 1D4 were unsuccessful (9Ridge K.D. Lee S.S.J. Abdulaev N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7860-7867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The reason(s) for the discrepancy between the present results and those reported earlier is not clear. Both the EF(1–232) + TH(241–348) and EF(1–232) + EF(249–312) fragment complexes formed chromophores to essentially the same level as the EF(1–232) + EF(233–348) complex (Fig. 4). Clearly, the complete absence of the third cytoplasmic loop does not appear to compromise the association of these fragments or their ability to bind retinal. This is consistent with the results of Franke et al. (29Franke R.R. König B. Sakmar T.P. Khorana H.G. Hofmann K.P. Science. 1990; 250: 123-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar), who showed that a 13-amino acid deletion in the third cytoplasmic loop (positions 237–249) did not abolish chromophore formation. Although the EF(1–232) + TH(241–348/P267G) complex formed the rhodopsin chromphore, the yield of regenerated pigment was ∼25% that of the full-length protein containing the P267G mutation (Fig. 4). Similarly, the EF(1–232) + TH(241–348)/P267L complex also formed a chromophore to a lesser degree than the P267L mutant. Coexpression of EF(1–232) with EF(233–348)/W265F resulted in a pigment with a blue-shifted chromophore (λmax = ∼480 nm). This is the same absorbance maximum for the full-length opsin containing the Trp-265 → Phe mutation (27Hwa J. Garriga P. Liu X. Khorana H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10571-10576Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Finally, the EF(1–232) + EF(249–312) fragment complex also bound retinal to form a 500-nm chromophore. After purification on immobilized concanavalin A (Fig. 4), the yield of the complex relative to that of wild-type rhodopsin was estimated to be ∼30%. The lectin-purified pigment also showed a nearly-UV absorbing species, suggesting that a portion of the chromophore was linked as an unprotonated Schiff base. This has also been observed for the HG(1–312) fragment (9Ridge K.D. Lee S.S.J. Abdulaev N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7860-7867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar).Figure 4UV-visible absorption spectra of rhodopsin and rhodopsin fragment complexes.

Although a variety of experimental strategies can be employed to gain valuable information about protein folding and assembly, we have utilized the approach of expressing fragments of a polypeptide to study this process in the integral membrane photoreceptor rhodopsin. Previous work from our and other laboratories has shown that many bovine opsin fragments contain sufficient information to fold independently, insert into a membrane, and assemble with a complementary fragment(s) in vivo to form a rhodopsin-like pigment (8Ridge K.D. Lee S.S.J. Yao L.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3204-3208Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 9Ridge K.D. Lee S.S.J. Abdulaev N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7860-7867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 30Yu H. Kono M. McKee T.D. Oprian D.D. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14963-14969Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 31Heymann J.A. Subramaniam S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4966-4971Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). However, not all opsin fragments are capable of folding independently and/or inserting into a membrane and appear to require other elements present in the corresponding complementary portion of the protein to adopt an appropriate conformation. Such is the case with the EF(1–232) opsin fragment, which does not fold to stable conformation unless it is coexpressed with its complementary fragment, EF(233–348). Presumably, the EF(1–232) fragment lacks the necessary information for proper folding and/or membrane insertion and is digested by cellular proteases that eliminate misfolded proteins from the cell. The purpose of this study was to examine whether truncated and/or mutated versions of EF(233–348) could stabilize expression of the EF(1–232) fragment.Coexpression experiments with the various carboxyl-terminal fragments revealed that EF(1–232) production was independent of the third cytoplasmic loop and carboxyl-terminal tail but required both the sixth and seventh TM helices (Fig. 3, A–C). These findings suggest that helix-helix interactions between complementary TMs are sufficient to confer significant EF(1–232) fragment stabilization. However, mutations in the sixth TM showed that in some cases, the presence of the third cytoplasmic loop was detrimental to EF(1–232) expression (Fig. 3, D–F). In particular, introduction of the Pro-267→ Gly or Leu mutations appeared to alter the conformation of the EF(233–348) fragment so that it no longer interacts with EF(1–232) in a productive manner. However, the same"
