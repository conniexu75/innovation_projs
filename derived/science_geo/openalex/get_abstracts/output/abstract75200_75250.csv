https://openalex.org/W1615351448,"Abstract Rat tissues contain four hexokinases including both the liver-specific high Km glucokinase and three low Km hexo-kinases present in differing proportions in the various tissues. Each of the low Km hexokinase types designated I, II, and III has been purified approximately 150- to 400-fold from one or more rat tissues (Type I from brain and kidney, Type II from skeletal muscle and epididymal fat pad, and Type III from liver). Each purified enzyme type, regardless of tissue source, has certain unique properties that distinguish it from the other hexokinase types. The purified types retain their different electrophoretic and chromatographic properties as found in crude extracts. They also differ with respect to apparent Km values for glucose and probably for adenosine triphosphate, apparent Ki values for adenosine diphosphate and glucose 6-phosphate, and stability to heat and proteolytic inactivation. The different enzyme types are similar with respect to pH optimum, molecular weight, hexose and nucleotide specificities, Km for fructose, and the qualitative nature of inhibition by ADP and glucose-6-P. The available evidence indicates that these hexokinase types represent different molecular forms and are not artifacts of preparation."
https://openalex.org/W1551118417,"Abstract Synthesis of liver ferritin induced by iron administration was investigated by treating rats by injection with pulse doses of leucine-14C at various times after a single intraperitoneal dose of iron. The iron caused a rapid but transient increase of leucine uptake into ferritin without affecting incorporation into mixed liver proteins; the ferritin response was dose-dependent and was followed by an increase in liver ferritin content. Since the action of iron was insensitive to actinomycin D, it was considered to be independent of synthesis of new messenger ribonucleic acid. Ferritin turnover was studied by following loss of radioactivity from liver ferritin over a 72-hour period after leucine-14C administration. Repeated injections of iron during this period increased the iron to protein ratio of ferritin and retarded loss of radioactivity, thus suggesting that iron-rich ferritin molecules are less susceptible than iron-poor molecules to degradation. With the use of a sucrose density gradient to separate ferritin species of differing iron content, it was shown that the first fraction to become labeled after injection of leucine-14C was low in iron. Subsequently there was progressive transfer of the label to ferritin fractions richer in iron over a 72-hour period. Repeated injection of iron caused a larger proportion of the initial radioactivity of the iron-poor fraction to be retained as iron-rich ferritin. To explain the actions of iron on ferritin metabolism by a single unifying hypothesis, it is proposed that iron can cause an apparent induction by stabilizing an unstable precursor of ferritin which would otherwise be rapidly degraded, and that iron can also stabilize iron-poor ferritin molecules by increasing their iron content and thus retarding their degradation."
https://openalex.org/W1516330854,The reaction of peptide and protein sulfhydryl groups with ethylenimine to give quantitative yields of S-β-aminoethylcysteinyl residues has been studied. Optimal conditions for tryptic hydrolysis of peptide bonds at the carboxyl terminus of such residues are described for the case of insulin B chain. Separation and identification of peptides obtained in this manner illustrate the applicability of the method to cleavage of polypeptide chains.

https://openalex.org/W1514748736,"Abstract Pyruvate carboxylase contains firmly bound manganese which affects the longitudinal relaxation rate of the protons of water as measured by pulsed nuclear magnetic resonance. The manganese shows an enhanced effect (ϵb = 4.2) on the relaxation rate when bound to the enzyme. Studies on the effect of added substrates and inhibitors on the proton relaxation rate have shown that components of the second partial reaction, e.g. the carboxylation of pyruvate by the enzyme-biotin ∼ CO2 complex, interact with the bound manganese of the enzyme and cause a reduction in the enhancement. In contrast, components of the first partial reaction, the formation of enzyme-biotin ∼ CO2 from adenosine triphosphate and HCO3-, do not significantly affect the enhancement. Examination of the enhancement of the bound manganese as a function of substrate or inhibitor concentration has permitted the determination of dissociation constants and enhancement values for the enzyme-substrate and enzyme-inhibitor complexes. The rate of inactivation of pyruvate carboxylase by avidin is increased by pyruvate and oxalacetate, and decreased by certain dissociable inhibitors, e.g. oxalate. Analysis of these data permits an independent determination of the dissociation constants of the enzyme-substrate and enzyme-inhibitor complexes. The dissociation constants derived from the proton relaxation rate measurements are in good agreement with those obtained from their effects on the rate of inactivation by avidin and also with inhibitor constants obtained from initial rate studies of the over-all reaction. These data strongly support the thesis that the bound manganese plays a functional role in the transcarboxylation portion of the pyruvate carboxylase reaction, i.e. the transfer of a carboxyl group from the enzyme-biotin ∼ CO2 intermediate to pyruvate. This locus of action differs from that of the added divalent metal ion which is required for this reaction and which participates in the formation of the enzyme-biotin ∼ CO2 intermediate from HCO3- and ATP. While dissociable inhibitors such as oxalate probably act by direct chelation of the bound manganese since the enhancement of the enzyme-inhibitor complex has a very low value (ϵc l 0.3), the corresponding values for the enzyme-substrate complexes are considerably higher (ϵc = 1.5 to 2.5), suggesting either that fewer metal-H2O ligands are displaced by substrates or that conformational changes in the protein contribute to the situation in a different way with the substrates and the inhibitors. Several possible mechanisms for the involvement of the bound manganese in this reaction are discussed, and a mechanism is suggested which is compatible with the kinetic and magnetic resonance data."

https://openalex.org/W1533552895,"Abstract The presence of a paramagnetic metal ion in pyruvate carboxylase has been shown by the effect of this enzyme on the longitudinal relaxation rate of the protons of water as measured by pulsed nuclear magnetic resonance. The metal ion shows an enhanced effect on the proton relaxation rate (ϵb = 4.2) when bound to the enzyme as compared to that of the free metal ion in the presence of denatured enzyme. This observation suggested that the metal ion is manganese, and the presence of manganese in the purified enzyme is confirmed by chemical, neutron activation, emission spectral, and atomic absorption spectral analyses. Quantitative analysis by various methods has given the metal content as 2.5 to 4.3 moles of manganese per mole of enzyme or 0.6 to 1.1 moles of manganese per mole of biotin. 54Mn is incorporated into pyruvate carboxylase in vivo. When the enzyme is isolated from chicken liver mitochondria, a good correlation is obtained between radioactivity and enzymic activity at all stages of purification subsequent to the initial mitochondrial extract. Correlation between total manganese content and enzymic activity has also been shown at various stages of purification. Studies on the 54Mn-labeled enzyme have shown that release of 54Mn and reduction in the enhancement of the proton relaxation rate occur only after irreversible denaturation of the enzyme. Neither the 54Mn content nor the proton relaxation rate is affected by exposure of the enzyme to cold or ethylenediaminetetraacetate. No exchange of the bound metal ion with added manganese can be shown. Although the protein-bound manganese possesses magnetic properties consistent with divalent manganese ion, higher valency states cannot be excluded."

The formula may be written (alpha2)beta(2)(23val-0). The abnormal hemoglobin is present with hemoglobin A in the proposita and in two of her three living children, but is not detectable in her parents. We postulate that this variant represents a triplet base deletion which most likely resulted from an unequal crossing-over between two normal betachain loci during meiosis in one of the parents of the proposita."
https://openalex.org/W1591584512,"Abstract In studies in vitro, creatine-1-14C entered the extensor digitorum longus of young rats by a saturable process which had an apparent Vmax of 0.6 mmole per liter of intracellular water per hour and an apparent Km of 5 x 10-4 M. Creatine entry by nonsaturable processes was negligible at physiologic external creatine concentrations. Anaerobiosis, 1 x 10-3 M 2,4-dinitrophenol, and cooling each reduced the intracellular accumulation of creatine-14C. The apparent Q10o for entry was 2.7. Loss of creatine from the muscle accelerated rapidly during incubation at 37° and exceeded the rate of creatine entry, but no connection between entry and loss was apparent. The large creatine loss in vitro was considered to be an artifact because it accelerated so rapidly during incubation and because it is inconsistent with observations from earlier experiments in vivo which indicate that much of the creatine in skeletal muscle is trapped there. A special mechanism for entry, the saturable process, and intracellular trapping of creatine provide a plausible explanation for the high creatine content of skeletal muscle."

One snake, with neither detectable virus nor serum neutralizing antibodies when first bled, developed viremia later. Viremia in garter snakes has a cyclic rhythm independent of the temperature of the environment. Virus was isolated from 6 frogs, and 50 out of 179 had detectable serum neutralizing antibodies. Infections with this virus are widely distributed in garter snakes and leopard frogs in the agricultural area of Saskatchewan."
https://openalex.org/W1537157632,"Abstract Unequivocal proof that individual rat tissues carry out the biosynthesis of coenzyme Q9 (CoQ9) from naturally occurring small molecules has been provided by the demonstration of incorporation of radioactivity from acetate-1-14C, DL-mevalonate-2-14C, uniformly labeled L-phenylalanine-14C, and uniformly labeled tyrosine-14C into CoQ9 in rat liver, kidney, heart, and intestine slices. The rates of synthesis of CoQ9 and cholesterol in various tissues were variable, although the rate of the over-all synthesis of cholesterol exceeded that of CoQ9 by a ratio of 350:1 in rat liver slices and 15:1 in rat kidney slices. The incorporation of mevalonate-2-14C into both cholesterol and CoQ9 obeys saturation kinetics as measured by the ratio of specific activity of the product to precursor. The apparent Km for cholesterol biosynthesis was 1.0 mM, whereas that for CoQ biosynthesis averaged 0.2 mM. Although the incorporation of label from mevalonate-2-14C into cholesterol was linear with time, a lag of about ½ hour was observed before significant incorporation of label into CoQ9 occurred. This lag in labeling of CoQ9 was attributed to the accumulation of intermediates at a slow point in the reaction sequence. The incorporation of mevalonate-2-14C into CoQ9 in rat tissue slices was independent of the carbon dioxide tension in the reaction medium but was dependent upon the partial pressure of oxygen. Neither the addition of pyruvate as an exogenous energy source nor the additional rat serum stimulated the rate of biosynthesis in liver slices. A radioactive fraction moving faster than CoQ9 on reverse phase paper chromatography from the crude CoQ fraction isolated from alumina has been identified as a mixture of radioactive isoprenoid alcohols. Tyrosine was approximately 3 times as effective as phenylalanine in labeling CoQ9 in vitro and approximately twice as effective as acetate. Incorporation of label into CoQ9 from the aromatic amino acids was little affected by addition of 5 mM nonradioactive mevalonate, whereas that from acetate-1-14C was inhibited 95% by means of isotope dilution. These findings support the dual origin of the side chain and aromatic portion of CoQ9 and indicate the feasibility of studying its biosynthesis in vitro."

The signals that occur during the first milliseconds after the flash are similar to electrical signals recently observed in the eye from the cell layers containing melanin. Possibly the melanin in skin augments, but does not directly generate, this early electrical response. In addition, a late response, which arises hundreds of milliseconds after the flash, also occurs in skin. Unlike the early response, the late response is sensitive only to violet and shorter wavelengths of light and hence is probably mediated by a pigment other than melanin."

Although the lipase catalyzes the hydrolysis of diglycerides and triglycerides of both long and short chain fatty acids, monoglycerides are not hydrolyzed. The enzyme has a marked specificity toward fatty acids esterified to the primary hydroxyl groups and hydrolyzes α,β-diglycerides 10 times more rapidly than α,α'-diglycerides. Thus, action of this enzyme would tend to promote the formation of β-monoglycerides in adipose tissue and catalyze the exchange of free fatty acids at the α positions of the triglycerides of adipose tissue."

https://openalex.org/W1576858560,"Abstract Rate constants for release of Mg2+, glucose 1-phosphate, glucose 6-phosphate, and glucose 1,6-diphosphate from the catalytically active complex under initial velocity conditions together with rate constants for dissociation of the Mg2+ complexes of phospho- and dephosphoenzyme are used to define the order of addition and release of the above species during the phosphoglucomutase reaction. Although the reaction pathway is technically random, it is actually ordered kinetically to a very high degree. The difference between the concept of ordered versus random reaction pathways in enzymic reactions may thus be mainly a quantitative rather than a qualitative consideration. All-or-none type assays are described for measuring some of the above rate constants and for evaluating the dissociation constant of the phosphoenzyme · magnesium complex. The possibility of phosphate isomerization in the phosphoenzyme · magnesium complex was examined. Since product inhibition in the phosphoglucomutase reaction is strictly competitive at high concentrations of product, kinetic data give no support to the possibility that phosphate transfer between two different attachment sites on the enzyme occurs during the catalytic cycle. Kinetic constants measured previously were identified in terms of the appropriate dissociation steps. The rate constants for release of Mg2+ from the catalytically active enzyme · substrate · Mg complex, the phosphoenzyme · Mg complex, and the dephosphoenzyme · Mg complex are about 0.03, 0.07, and 0.22 sec-1, respectively; the release of Mg2+ from the catalytically active complex is thus about 1/25,000 of the catalytic conversion of glucose-1-P to glucose-6-P, 750 sec-1."

After an initial dose of 800 mg orally followed by 200 mg four times daily, Wilson et al.2 found plasma concentrations from 50 to 100 mg/1. and consider these concentrations necessary for therapeutic effect. Currie3 found 80–110 mg/1. at the beginning of the therapy and later under maintenance dose-levels of 46–80 mg/l. Bruck et al.1 are of the opinion that, in order to avoid side-effects, plasma concentrations should not exceed 100 mg/l., and during treatment they maintained concentrations of between 50 and 90 mg/1.

https://openalex.org/W1980536269,"IT is well known that the neonatal rat brain contains relatively little serotonin1,2 and that the level of this amine increases slowly with age. Karki et al.3 have shown that the enzymes mediating the synthesis and oxidation of serotonin are also low in the immature rat brain, and increase thereafter with growth of the animal. The aforementioned authors suggest that the low levels of indolamines in the rat brain at birth can be attributed to a deficiency of the binding or storage system, and are not a reflexion of the insufficiency of the enzyme systems. Schanberg and Giarman4,5 have shown that endogenous brain serotonin distributes itself between the particulate matter of brain homogenates and the supernatants, and that this relationship is susceptible to alteration by drugs. It was, therefore, of interest to investigate the sub-cellular distribution of serotonin in the developing rat brain and to determine whether it will parallel other maturational changes."

Sarcosomes of adult flight muscle were also studied. The strains of Drosophila used included Canton S wild type and three members of the Minute series of mutants, i.e. M(2)z, M(2)1, and M(2)12, and their control. The cytochrome spectra of all strains revealed the presence of cytochromes a + a3, b, and c. Although cytochrome c1, as defined in mammalian systems, was absent from these preparations, two cytochromes with absorption maxima at 551 and 555 mµ, corresponding to those found in housefly sarcosomes, are described. It is postulated that the 551 and 555 mµ components are located between cytochromes b and c of the electron transport chain, the 551 mµ component in a position analogous to cytochrome c1 of mammals and the 555 mµ component on a bifurcation of the main pathway. No qualitative differences were present among the spectra of the mutants, their controls, or homozygous wild type, implying that at least the heme portions of the cytochromes are normal in these mutants. In addition, no differences between larval mitochondria and adult flight muscle sarcosomes were found, indicating that the electron transport chain is qualitatively similar in both stages of the life cycle."

Observers judged the degree of apparent deviation from linearity of the various paths of loudness growth. The growth of loudness was judged to be least nonlinear when the sound pressure was made to increase as the 1.67 power of time. It follows, therefore, that loudness must be related to sound pressure by a power function with exponent 0.6 (reciprocal of 1.67). This outcome shows that the exponent of the psychophysical power function may be verified by a procedure that does not require the assumption that numerical estimates are proportional to subjective magnitudes."
