https://openalex.org/W1483909430,"When C14-labeled lysine is incubated with guinea pig liver homogenate, α-aminoadipic, α-ketoadipic, and glutaric acids are formed from the lysine (1). These transformations were established by finding the radioactivity of the C14 tracer in the metabolic products. The homogenate proteins coagulated by boiling at pH 5 also contained radioactivity. The counts given by the proteins corresponded to about 0.02 to 0.03 per cent of that added as lysine; the extent of lysine incorporation into the proteins was of the same order of magnitude as Melchior and Tarver (2) had found after incubating S35-labeled methionine and Winnick et al. (3, 4) C14-labeled glycine with rat tissue homogenates. Yet we could not satisfy ourselves that the radioactivity remaining in the proteins in our experiments, although it persisted through exhaustive extraction, did not come from traces of adsorbed radioactive lysine. Some counts were found in the protein when the homogenate was boiled prior to incubation with isotopic lysine."

https://openalex.org/W1543878353,"The finding by Tatum, Banner, and Beadle (l), that the tryptophanless Neurospora mutant strain 10575 accumulates anthranilic acid, which in turn can be utilized for growth of strain 40008, has provided evidence that anthranilic acid is a biochemical precursor of tryptophan in this organism. It has been further established that indole is an intermediate in this conversion (2-5). 

More recent work with a number of mutants of Neurospora (6-8) has established that tryptophan is a biochemical precursor to niacin with kynurenine and hydroxyanthranilic acid as intermediates. The accumulated evidence has indicated the existence in the mold of the following series of reactions: 

→ Anthranilic acid → indole → tryptophan → kynurenine → 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid → nicotinic acid 

In the light of this evidence the present work was undertaken to trace the carbon in the carboxyl group of anthranilic acid in order to estimate its contribution as a structural unit in the formation of niacin and tryptophan. The organism chosen for this investigation was a biochemical mutant strain of Neurospora designated as strain 40008. This mutant utilizes anthranilic acid, indole, or tryptophan for growth. 

The mutant was grown in the presence of anthranilic acid containing Cl4 in the carboxyl group. Niacin and tryptophan were isolated from the mold mycelium and tested for radioactivity."

https://openalex.org/W1994477035,"SINCE early in 1944, when insecticidal products containing D.D.T. were first put on the market in Denmark, a great proportion of the available D.D.T has been used for fly control on our farms. The commonest practice has been to spray the inside of cowsheds, pigsties, etc., with a water suspension or emulsion, usually containing not more than 0·05–0·1 per cent D.D.T., at the rate of about 0·1–0·2 gm. D.D.T. per sq. metre. The spraying must be carefully done. This dosage may seem rather small ; but in the first year or two it worked well in most places, and many farmers were able to keep their farm buildings free from flies by spraying two or three times a year."

https://openalex.org/W138965636,"We reported in a preliminary communication (1) the isolation of a peptide fraction from guinea pig liver. The following points of interest appeared at once: many different amino acids were obtained on hydrolysis; the peptide fraction contained most of the indispensable amino acids, which indicated that it probably is important in protein metabolism; when guinea pig liver homogenate was incubated with C14-labeled glycine, leucine, or lysine, these were rapidly incorporated into this peptide fraction, which is further evidence that it is metabolically active; the peptide fraction had not been described hitherto; a fraction containing one or more large peptides can be separated from so complex a mixture as liver homogenate by starch chromatography."

In later papers2, I showed that europium can easily be reduced to the bivalent form by heating in various basic materials."

Dr. Bush's discussion of these relations is of considerable general interest, particularly when greater attention is being paid to the organisation of research staff in industry and when the general conditions and conduct of academic research are being re-examined."
