https://openalex.org/W1968747876,"The aerenchyma (air-space) tissue in the wetland macrophyte Spartina alterniflora conveys sufficient oxygen to roots for predominately aerobic respiration in moderately, but not highly, reduced substrates. Continuously flooded plants survive by respiring anaerobically, although growth is decreased. Two metabolic adaptations to flooding are displayed in this species, depending on the degree of soil reduction."
https://openalex.org/W1970155516,"The reactions of nitrogen dioxide with cyclohexene have been studied as a model for the reactions that occur between nitrogen dioxide in smoggy air and unsaturated fatty acids in pulmonary lipids. As predicted from earlier studies at high nitrogen dioxide concentrations, this gas reacts with cyclohexene predominantly by addition to the double bond at nitrogen dioxide concentrations of 1 percent (10,000 parts per million) to 40 percent in nitrogen; in the presence of air or oxygen, this reaction initiates the autoxidation of the alkene. However, at concentrations below 100 parts per million in nitrogen, nitrogen dioxide reacts with cyclohexene almost exclusively by abstraction of allylic hydrogen; this unexpected reaction also initiates the autoxidation of the alkene in the presence of oxygen or air, but it leads to the production of nitrous acid rather than of a product containing a nitro group attached to a carbon atom. The nitrous acid can react with amines to produce nitrosamines. Moreover, the nitrite ion produced by the hydrogen abstraction mechanism would be expected to diffuse throughout the body, unlike nitrated lipids that would be confined to the pulmonary cavity. These findings have been confirmed with methyl oleate, linoleate, and linolenate; some of the kinetic features of the nitrogen dioxide-initiated autoxidation of these unsaturated fatty acids have been studied."

https://openalex.org/W1971146399,"For the scientist who wishes to synthesize complex organic compounds, the most difficult problem is often establishing the correct configuration at the various chiral centers as the synthesis is being carried out. In the past decade, there has been an increasing effort to find direct solutions to this problem, which is particularly acute in the synthesis of acyclic and other conformationally flexible molecules. One of the oldest organic reactions, the aldol condensation, is emerging as a powerful tool for use in achieving such stereocontrol."
https://openalex.org/W2007365033,Female Cupiennius salei pheromone on banana and Agave plants elicits patterned oscillations by the male. Resulting pulse trains of vibrations through the leaf average 76 hertz. The brief vibratory response by the otherwise immobile female hidden up to at least 1 meter away on another leaf guides the male across the plant to her location. Reciprocal signaling continues in the presence of random noise that masks the male's airborne sounds.
https://openalex.org/W2016852386,Etch-decoration reveals that the rate of removal of carbon atoms exposed at monolayer steps on graphite surfaces depends on the population density of these edge atoms (the rate is higher at a low-density surface) and that carbon removal continues for a prolonged period after the oxygen supply in the gas phase has been shut off. The edge carbons are removed by both oxygen from the gas phase and oxygen in the adsorbed oxides which migrate from the neighboring basal carbon atoms.
https://openalex.org/W2127535468,"This article discusses prehistoric irrigation canals recently excavated near Phoenix, Arizona. The canals were constructed by the Hohokam Indians between A.D. 850 and 1450. Several aerial photographs taken at various times in the past five decades clearly show the paths of hundreds of the canals, including some of those recently excavated. These data provide new insights on Hohokam irrigation technology and society. Despite the destructive inroads of modern development, much significant archeological information can still be retrieved both by conventional excavation methods and by the archival study of aerial photographs."
https://openalex.org/W2094946598,"The Brazilian shrub Baccharis megapotamica contains significant amounts of antibiotic trichothecenes. When these plants are grown in the United States, they are devoid of the mycotoxins. Feeding experiments with fungus-produced trichothecenes show that Baccharis megapotamica absorbs, translocates, and chemically alters these compounds to ones with structures analogous to those found in the plant in its native habitat. The mycotoxins, which have no apparent ill effect in Baccharis megapotamica, kill tomatoes, peppers, and artichokes."

Three factors, identified as a natural background source, an oceanic or seawater source, and an estuarine source, account for 96 percent of the metal variability."

In water, only small percentages molt to the adult stage. In root diffusates from some but not all plants, nearly all of them molt."
https://openalex.org/W2083067850,"The vacuole in stomatal cells of Allium undergoes major changes in shape during differentiation, switching from a globular form in new guard mother cells to a network of interconnected tubules and chambers, and then back to a globular form as guard cells mature. In addition, vacuolar network elements exhibit characteristic movements and rearrangements."
