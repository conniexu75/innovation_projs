https://openalex.org/W2160773412,"The function of the yeast SSB 70 kd heatshock proteins (hsp70s) was investigated by a variety of approaches. The SSB hsp70s () are associated with translating ribosomes. This association is disrupted by puromycin, suggesting that may bind directly to the nascent polypeptide. Mutant ssb1 ssb2 strains grow slowly, contain a low number of translating ribosomes, and are hypersensitive to several inhibitors of protein synthesis. The slow growth phenotype of ssb1 ssb2 mutants is suppressed by increased copy number of a gene encoding a novel translation elongation factor 1α (EF-1α)-like protein. We suggest that cytosolic hsp70 aids in the passage of the nascent polypeptide chain through the ribosome in a manner analogous to the role played by organellelocalized hsp70 in the transport of proteins across membranes."
https://openalex.org/W1517546728,"Post-translational modifications of the ras proteins, which are required for plasma membrane localization and biological function of the proteins, have been shown to include prenylation and carboxymethylation at the carboxyl terminal cysteine residue of the cysteine-aliphatic amino acid-aliphatic amino acid-any amino acid (CAAX) box. In addition, p21Ha-ras and p21N-ras, but not p21K-ras (B), are palmitoylated. The three mammalian rho proteins (A, B, and C) are also members of the ras superfamily but have distinct biological activities and different intracellular distributions from p21ras. Analysis showed all three rho proteins are modified by a COOH-terminal carboxymethylation similar to p21ras, whereas p21rhoC labeled with [3H]mevalonic acid in vivo revealed the presence of a C20 prenoid, similar to that already described for p21rhoA. However, in vivo and in vitro studies of p21rhoB showed this protein to be modified by both C15 and C20 prenoids. Mutation of C193 in the CAAX box abolished prenylation, whereas mutation of the adjacent C192 resulted in a significant reduction in the amount of the C20, but not C15 prenoid, recovered from p21rhoB. In vivo labeling studies with [3H]palmitic acid and mutational analysis showed that both cysteine residues at 189 and 192 upstream of the CAAX box in p21rhoB are sites for palmitoylation. We conclude that there are different populations of post-translationally modified p21rhoB in the cell and that the sequence specificity for geranylgeranyl- and farnesyltransferases may be more complicated than previously proposed."
https://openalex.org/W1983096415,"During Drosophila oogenesis six to ten follicle cells, the border cells, undergo a dramatic and stereotypic migration through the developing egg chamber. We identified four independent P element insertion mutations that specifically blocked border cell migration. They defined a single, novel locus that was named slow border cells (slbo), because hypomorphic alleles caused delayed onset of the migration. Laser ablation of the border cells, or failure of their migration, caused improper morphogenesis of the micropyle, the egg-shell structure through which the sperm enters at fertilization. The slbo locus was found to encode a product homologous to the CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP), a basic region-leucine zipper transcription factor. Drosophila C/EBP may be required for the expression of gene products mediating border cell migration."
https://openalex.org/W1577946620,"We recently demonstrated that sphingosine enhances interleukin-1 beta (IL-1)-mediated prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) production in human dermal fibroblasts (Ballou, L. R., Barker, S. C., Postlethwaite, A. E., and Kang, A. H. (1990) J. Immunol. 145, 4245-4251). Because sphingosine and ceramide are interconvertable, we extended previous studies by treating cells with C2-ceramide (C2-cer), a membrane-soluble analogue of ceramide, and found that C2-cer stimulates IL-1-mediated PGE2 production to the same degree as sphingosine. In an effort to elucidate the mechanistic basis by which sphingosine and C2-cer affect PGE2 production, we examined the effect of these molecules on the expression of genes encoding cyclooxygenase (EC 1.14.99.1, Cox) and phospholipase A2 (EC 3.1.1.4, PLA2), the rate-limiting enzymes in PGE2 biosynthesis. We found that sphingosine and C2-cer treatment resulted in an 8-fold induction of Cox mRNA within 1-2 h which declined thereafter; concomitant changes in Cox protein were also observed. In contrast, expression of phospholipase A2 remained unaltered. We also found that IL-1-mediated PGE2 production was dramatically enhanced in cells treated simultaneously with sphingomyelinase which led us to directly test the effect of IL-1 on sphingomyelin turnover. IL-1 treatment induced the hydrolysis of a significant fraction of prelabeled sphingomyelin which was accompanied by increased levels of intracellular ceramide. Taken together, our results suggest that enhanced Cox expression may account for the observed enhancement of IL-1-mediated PGE2 production by sphingosine and C2-cer. These data also suggest that endogenous sphingomyelin metabolites, generated in response to IL-1, may play an important role in IL-1 signal transduction."
https://openalex.org/W1553937011,"A biological reporter gene assay was employed to determine the crucial parameters for maximizing selective targeting of a Ha-ras codon 12 point mutation (G----T) using phosphorothioate antisense oligonucleotides. We have tested a series of oligonucleotides ranging in length between 5 and 25 bases, each centered around the codon 12 point mutation. Our results indicate that selective targeting of this point mutation can be achieved with phosphorothioate antisense oligonucleotides, but this selectivity is critically dependent upon oligonucleotide length and concentration. The maximum selectivity observed in antisense experiments, 5-fold for a 17-base oligonucleotide, was closely predicted by a simple thermodynamic model that relates the fraction of mutant to wild type target bound as a function of oligonucleotide concentration and affinity. These results suggest thermodynamic analysis of oligonucleotide/target interactions is useful in predicting the specificity that can be achieved by an antisense oligonucleotide targeted to a single base point mutation."
https://openalex.org/W1540423796,"GTP-binding proteins have been shown to serve as second messengers in the transduction of hormone signals across animal cell plasma membranes. We present here three lines of evidence to demonstrate that GTP-binding proteins are also involved in the elicitation of the defense response of cultured soybean cells. First, the antigen-binding fragment (Fab) of an antibody that specifically recognizes GTP-binding proteins in plants and animals was delivered into soybean cells using a non-destructive biotin-mediated delivery technique developed previously. Internalization of this Fab enhanced up to 10-fold the rapid oxidative burst induced by elicitor molecules, whereas internalization of its heat-denatured counterpart or unrelated proteins had no effect. Because the antibody recognizes a protein of molecular mass approximately 45 kDa in soybean cell membranes that is protected from ADP-ribosylation by GTP gamma S (guanosine 5'-O-(thiotriphosphate), we propose the 45-kDa GTP-binding protein is responsible for these effects. Second, mastoparan, a specific activator of GTP-binding proteins, was shown to induce the defense-related oxidative burst in the absence of elicitor stimulation, thus mimicking an activated receptor as it is thought to do in mammalian systems. Finally, but admittedly less convincing, the A subunit of cholera toxin, an activator of certain stimulatory GTP-binding proteins (Gs), was found to weakly enhance the conventional elicitor-induced oxidative burst. Taken together, these data argue for the involvement of GTP-binding proteins in elicitor signal transduction in soybean cells."
https://openalex.org/W1527929042,"Rat liver peroxisomes contain three acyl-CoA oxidases:palmitoyl-CoA oxidase, pristanoyl-CoA oxidase, and trihydroxycoprostanoyl-CoA oxidase. The three oxidases were separated by anion-exchange chromatography of a partially purified oxidase preparation, and the column eluate was analyzed for oxidase activity with different acyl-CoAs. Short chain mono (hexanoyl-) and dicarboxylyl (glutaryl-)-CoAs and prostaglandin E2-CoA were oxidized exclusively by palmitoyl-CoA oxidase. Long chain mono (palmitoyl-) and dicarboxylyl (hexadecanedioyl-)-CoAs were oxidized by palmitoyl-CoA oxidase and pristanoyl-CoA oxidase, the former enzyme catalyzing approximately 70% of the total eluate activity. The very long chain lignoceroyl-CoA was also oxidized by palmitoyl-CoA oxidase and pristanoyl-CoA oxidase, the latter enzyme catalyzing approximately 65% of the total eluate activity. Long chain 2-methyl branched acyl-CoAs (2-methylpalmitoyl-CoA and pristanoyl-CoA) were oxidized for approximately 90% by pristanoyl-CoA oxidase, the remaining activity being catalyzed by trihydroxycoprostanoyl-CoA oxidase. The short chain 2-methylhexanoyl-CoA was oxidized by trihydroxycoprostanoyl-CoA oxidase and pristanoyl-CoA oxidase (approximately 60 and 40%, respectively, of the total eluate activity). Trihydroxycoprostanoyl-CoA was oxidized exclusively by trihydroxycoprostanoyl-CoA oxidase. No oxidase activity was found with isovaleryl-CoA and isobutyryl-CoA. Substrate dependences of palmitoyl-CoA oxidase and pristanoyl-CoA oxidase were very similar when assayed with the same (common) substrate. Since the two oxidases were purified to a similar extent and with a similar yield, the contribution of each enzyme to substrate oxidation in the column eluate probably reflects its contribution in the intact liver."
https://openalex.org/W1525977186,"The structurally related type XII-like collagen molecules TL-A and TL-B were recently identified in fetal bovine epiphyseal cartilage and subsequently shown to be collagen types XII and XIV, respectively. By indirect immunofluorescent staining of cartilage using monoclonal antibodies to the NC3 domains of each molecule, it was shown that type XII collagen was present predominantly around cartilage canals, the articular surface, subperichondrial margins, and the perichondrium, was less so in the remaining cartilage matrix, and was absent from the growth plate region. In the permanent cartilage of trachea, type XII stained somewhat more intensely in the margins beneath the loose connective tissue. Type XIV collagen localized more uniformly throughout the articular cartilage and was also absent from the growth plate region, whereas in tracheal cartilage, its distribution was similar to type XII. We have characterized the structure of these cartilage molecules and compared them with those from fetal bovine skin. Extraction of cartilage with 1 M NaCl and differential NaCl precipitation yields a fraction enriched for these two collagens. Analysis by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting with monoclonal antibodies to the large amino-terminal non-triple-helical domain, NC3, revealed the presence in cartilage of two forms of type XII collagen: type XIIB, the molecule previously identified in chick and bovine tissues, and type XIIA, a much larger form equivalent to the molecule recently identified in WISH-transformed epithelial cell culture medium (Lunstrum, G. P., McDonough, A. M., Marinkovich, M. P., Keene, D. R., Morris, N. P., and Burgeson, R. E. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 20087-20092). Digestion with bacterial collagenase shows that the increased mass is present in the NC3A domain. Additional purification by velocity sedimentation and observation of rotary-shadowed images demonstrates molecules with extended non-triple-helical arms approximately 80 nm in length analogous to the WISH cell molecules. Electrophoretic mobilities of bands corresponding to type XIIA, but not type XIIB, are sensitive to chondroitinase ABC, indicating that type XIIA is a chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan and that modification occurs predominantly within the NC3A domain distal to NC3B. Neither type XIIB from skin nor type XIIA from WISH cells are chondroitinase-sensitive. By similar analysis, a portion of the type XIV collagen chains in cartilage was also sensitive to chondroitinase digestion. Chondroitin sulfate is apparently not located on its NC3 domain. As in skin, collagen types XII and XIV have subtly different distributions within cartilage and type XII may have a tissue-specific structure."
https://openalex.org/W1486108017,"Fibulin is a recently described extracellular matrix (ECM) and plasma glycoprotein (Argraves, W. S., Tran, H., Burgess, W. H., and Dickerson, K. (1990) J. Cell Biol. 111, 3155-3164). In this report, ligand affinity chromatography and solid-phase binding analyses were performed to determine which ECM protein(s) interact with fibulin. Fibulin-Sepharose bound two polypeptides of 240 and 100 kDa from the culture medium of metabolically radiolabeled fibroblasts. These two proteins were identified as fibronectin (FN) and fibulin, respectively, based on their electrophoretic behavior and reactivity with monoclonal antibodies. Consistent with the findings of affinity chromatography, fibulin bound to surfaces coated with FN (either plasma or cellular form) or fibulin but not with other ECM proteins, such as laminin, merosin, and types I and IV collagen. The binding of fibulin to solid-phase FN was estimated to have a Kd of 139 nM, whereas the Kd for self-interaction was 322 nM. Evaluation of proteolytic fragments from all regions of FN allowed a fibulin-binding site to be localized within a 23-kDa heparin-binding fragment containing type III repeats 13-14. Heparin did not compete for the interaction between fibulin and FN, suggesting that the binding sites for fibulin and heparin are distinct."
https://openalex.org/W1587689697,"A plasmid has been constructed by cloning the complete crtI gene encoding phytoene desaturase from Erwinia uredovora behind the lac Z promoter of pUC18 resulting in a reading frame for the full polypeptide with additional 9 amino acids at the N terminus. This plasmid mediated the overexpression of phytoene desaturase in transformed Escherichia coli. The overexpressed enzyme was sequestrated into inclusion bodies requiring urea treatment for solubilization. Purification to homogeneity was subsequently performed on a DEAE-cellulose column and by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The purification scheme allowed the isolation of 5.3 mg of homogeneous desaturase protein from 100 ml of E. coli cell suspension. On SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis an apparent molecular mass of 56.2 kDa was determined. An antiserum raised against phytoene desaturase cross-reacted with the expressed protein and was employed to monitor the isolation steps. Upon removal of urea, desaturase activity was restored. The isolated desaturase catalyzed the conversion of 15-cis-phytoene to trans-lycopene as well as to bisdehydrolycopene. FAD was involved in desaturation, whereas NAD and NADP were inhibitory. This is the first time that a membrane-integrated carotenogenic enzyme has been purified and finally obtained in an active state."
https://openalex.org/W1589643778,"A deletion in the structural gene for the soluble lytic transglycosylase, the predominant murein hydrolase in the soluble fraction of Escherichia coli, has been constructed. The mutant grows normally but exhibits increased sensitivity toward mecillinam, a beta-lactam specific for penicillin-binding protein 2. In the presence of furazlocillin or other beta-lactams with a specificity for penicillin-binding protein 3 which normally cause filamentation, bulges were formed prior to rapid bacteriolysis. Similar morphological alterations are known to develop in wild type E. coli cells when furazlocillin is combined with bulgecin, an antibiotic of unusual glucosaminyl structure. It turned out that bulgecin specifically inhibits the Sl-transglycosylase in a noncompetitive manner. Since bulgecin shows some structural analogy to the murein subunits we postulate that the soluble lytic transglycosylase, in addition to its active site, has a recognition site for specific murein structures. The possibility of an allosteric modulation of the activity of the enzyme by changes in the structure of the murein sacculus is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1987344811,"The translocation of polypeptides across the endoplasmic reticulum is a vectorial process that occurs probably through a protein channel by a mechanism as yet undetermined. Here, we demonstrate bidirectional movement of a 221 residue nascent polypeptide across microsomal membranes and provide evidence suggesting that the retrograde movement is through the translocation channel. Retrograde movement is observed only when the polypeptide is generated from a truncated transcript; addition of a stop codon after codon 221 confers vectorial movement. Retrograde movement can also be prevented by glycosylation of the nascent polypeptide, as well as by inclusion of 32 additional amino acids that may promote folding of the translocated chain. We propose that the protein translocation channel is a passive pore that does not create a directional bias in polypeptide movement and that vectorial translocation is driven by nascent chain elongation and sustained by posttranslocation events that prevent retrograde movement."
https://openalex.org/W1664463503,"Toxicity from 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) exposure results in severe metabolic imbalances leading to a loss of fat stores in many animal species, a phenomenon known as the wasting syndrome. In this paper, we report that TCDD treatment at very low doses (0.03-1 micrograms/kg, single intraperitoneal injection) causes a profound reduction of glucose uptake by guinea pig adipose tissue, pancreas and brain. This effect of TCDD is dose-dependent, with a dose as small as 0.03 micrograms/kg resulting in a significant decrease. In adipose tissue, the decrease begins within 6 h of treatment and persists at least 28 days. The Vmax of glucose transport was decreased by TCDD treatment, whereas the Km was unchanged. Liver behaves oppositely to adipose tissue. At early stages of treatment (6-12 h) glucose uptake was depressed, while at later stages (24-96 h) it was increased. In situ (explant tissue culture) treatment with TCDD yields similar trends as in vivo studies for glucose uptake in all three tissues. In adipose tissue culture TCDD starts reducing glucose uptake after 30 minutes. The inhibitory potencies of three dioxin congeners on adipose glucose transporting activities follows the same order of their toxicities in vivo. TCDD's effect on glucose transport is sensitive to cytochalasin B, a specific inhibitor of glucose transporter proteins. Based on these observations and the importance of glucose transporters to cellular energy maintenance, we conclude that at least in guinea pigs the reduction of glucose transporters in various tissues is one of the major causes for TCDD-induced wasting syndrome, which is so prominent in this species."
https://openalex.org/W1509690851,"An investigation of the molecular properties of glycoprotein III has shown this to be a major component of molecular aggregates present in the membrane and soluble fractions of secretory vesicles from bovine adrenal medulla. These aggregates also contain components identified as glycoproteins H, J, and K which are molecular forms of Kex2-related proteases (glycoprotein H) and carboxypeptidase H (glycoprotein components J and K) and which have functions concerned with the processing of prohormones. A number of experiments indicated that these glycoproteins were associated. These components were coimmunoprecipitated from the soluble and membrane fractions of chromaffin granules. Purification of soluble glycoprotein III using wheat germ agglutinin-Sepharose resulted in the recovery of similar proportions of glycoproteins H, J, and K and gel filtration of the eluted material in combination with immunoprecipitation revealed the presence of heteroaggregates containing all of the glycoproteins. Similar results were obtained following octylglucoside solubilization of chromaffin granule membranes. Glycoprotein components III, H, J, and K were also found to have identical distributions following fractionation of chromaffin granule membranes with Triton X-114. It was concluded that the aggregates seen in the soluble fraction reflect an association of these components in the chromaffin granule membrane. This raises the possibility that these interactions are important for the targetting of these glycoproteins to secretory granules."
https://openalex.org/W1492009119,"Fatty acid binding proteins (FABP) are a family of low molecular weight proteins found in many tissues that actively utilize free fatty acids (ffa). FABP would be expected to have a particularly important role in the heart, where over 80% of energy requirements are derived from oxidation of long chain fatty acids. The precise physiological function of heart FABP (H-FABP) has not been definitively identified, although it is thought to play a role in intracellular ffa transport. To examine the possible role of H-FABP in cardiac myocyte transfer of ffa, we examined the transfer of fluorescent anthroyloxy ffa (AOffa) from H-FABP to model phospholipid membranes, using a resonance energy transfer assay. In contrast to previous observations of ffa transfer from liver FABP and from membranes, transfer from H-FABP to membranes appears to occur by a different mechanism. AO-palmitate (16:0) transfer was 1.5-fold slower than AO-stearate (18:0) transfer, and mono-unsaturation did not affect the transfer rate. The AOffa transfer rate from H-FABP increased with increasing ionic strength and decreased slightly between pH 7 and 9. These results suggest that the rate of ffa transfer from H-FABP to membranes is independent of the ffa aqueous solubility. Thermodynamic analysis showed that the free energy of activation for the ffa transfer process arises primarily from an enthalpic component, with only a small entropic contribution, again suggesting the lack of an aqueous phase route of ffa delivery. Finally, the ffa transfer rate was found to be directly dependent on the concentration of acceptor membranes. These data therefore suggest that transfer of AOffa from H-FABP to membranes may occur via collisional interactions between the protein and membranes."
https://openalex.org/W1519991061,"We have recently demonstrated that Cys-254 of the 73-kDa A subunit of the clathrin-coated vesicle (H+)-ATPase is responsible for sensitivity of the enzyme to sulfhydryl reagents (Feng, Y., and Forgac, M. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 5817-5822). In the present study we observe that for the purified enzyme, disulfide bond formation causes inactivation of proton transport which is reversed by dithiothreitol (DTT). DTT also restores activity of the oxidized enzyme following treatment with N-ethylmaleimide (NEM). These results indicate that disulfide bond formation between the NEM-reactive cysteine (Cys-254) and a closely proximal cysteine residue leads to inactivation of the (H+)-ATPase. To test whether sulfhydryl-disulfide bond interchange may play a role in regulating vacuolar acidification in vivo, we have determined what fraction of the (H+)-ATPase is disulfide-bonded in native clathrin-coated vesicles. Vesicles were isolated under conditions that prevent any change in the oxidation state of the sulfhydryl groups. NEM treatment of vesicles causes nearly complete loss of activity while subsequent treatment with DTT restores 50% of the activity of the fully reduced vesicles. By contrast, treatment of fully reduced vesicles with NEM leads to inactivation which is not reversed by DTT. These results indicate that a significant fraction of the clathrin-coated vesicle (H+)-ATPase exists in an inactive, disulfide-bonded state and suggest that sulfhydryl-disulfide bond interconversion may play a role in controlling vacuolar (H+)-ATPase (V-ATPase) activity in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2167411606,"Cytosolic free Ca2+ rises in pancreatic beta-cells in response to glucose stimulation and is part of the coupling to insulin secretion. This study evaluates a possible role for cytosolic long chain acyl-CoA esters in modulating Ca2+ handling by clonal beta-cells (HIT). Intact cells incubated with 20 microM free palmitic acid exhibited a 40% decrease in basal cytosolic free Ca2+. In contrast, acyl-CoA esters, up to a chain length of 16, but not the corresponding fatty acids, significantly lowered the Ca2+ set point maintained by cells permeabilized with saponin. The maximum response to the various acyl-CoA esters increased with increasing chain length, with no differences in the half-maximally effective concentration of 0.5 microM. Long chain acyl-CoA esters caused a 40-50% increase in 45Ca2+ influx into a non-mitochondrial pool in the permeabilized HIT cells, consistent with a stimulatory effect on the endoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase activity, but did not affect inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate-induced Ca(2+)-efflux. Thapsigargin, an inhibitor of endoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase activity, blocked the decrease in the Ca2+ set point caused by acyl-CoA esters. The ability of acyl-CoA esters to lower the Ca2+ set point depended on the ATP/ADP ratio (or free ADP); the Ca2+ set point was lowered by 36 +/- 3.6% at an ATP/ADP ratio of 90 and by 14 +/- 1.9% at an ATP/ADP ratio of 7. Depletion of cellular protein kinase C did not prevent the acyl-CoA-induced lowering of the Ca2+ set point. These findings suggest that the increases in long chain acyl-CoA esters may play a role in restoring cytosolic free Ca2+ through activation of Ca(2+)-ATPases."
https://openalex.org/W1502344719,"Protein-tyrosine phosphorylation during platelet activation is inhibited under conditions that inhibit platelet binding of fibrinogen and aggregation. We suggested that pp60src, a major platelet tyrosine kinase, or its protein substrates might become associated with the cytoskeleton upon platelet stimulation, and that this might be related to aggregation. By Western blotting with an anti-Src monoclonal antibody, we found time-dependent association of pp60src with the cytoskeleton (10,000 x g Triton X-100-insoluble matrix) but not the membrane cytoskeleton (100,000 x g Triton X-100-insoluble matrix) in platelets activated by U46619 (PGH2 analog). Cytoskeletal association and platelet aggregation were inhibited by the peptide Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser (RGDS) (but not by Arg-Gly-Glu-Ser (RGES)), by 10E5 antibody against glycoprotein (Gp) IIb/IIIa, and by EGTA. U46619-induced association of pp60src with cytoskeleton but not secretion or aggregation was inhibited by cytochalasin D (2 microM). Both cytochalasin D and RGDS inhibited tyrosine phosphorylation of platelet proteins. Association of pp60src with cytoskeleton induced by U46619 or ADP was not blocked by aspirin. Aspirin blocked epinephrine-induced association of pp60src with the cytoskeleton during a second phase of aggregation when an initial phase had occurred without shape change or secretion. Association of GpIIb/IIIa with the cytoskeleton also accompanied platelet aggregation, shape change, and actin polymerization; this was shown with anti-GpIIb and anti-GpIIIa antibodies. Association of pp60src and GpIIb/IIIa with the cytoskeleton and slow tyrosine phosphorylation are related phenomena."
https://openalex.org/W1485239271,"The involvement of molten globule state as a distinct intermediate in the denaturation process in proteins is well documented. However, the structural characterization of such an intermediate is far from complete. We have, using fluorescence and fluorescence quenching, studied the molten globule state of bovine alpha-lactalbumin. Unlike the native state, where all the 4 tryptophans are buried in the protein, 2 tryptophans are exposed in the molten globule state. Using the hydrophobic photoactivable reagent [3H]diazofluorene, we observe an increased hydrophobic exposure in the molten globule state. These structural characteristics conform to the current views on the molten globule state, i.e. it has similar secondary structure but a poorly defined tertiary structure. Our fluorescence studies indicate the involvement of a premolten globule state in the native to molten globule state transition. This premolten globule state exists at pH 5.0 and has a very compact structure involving increased hydrophobic interactions in the protein interior. These results are also supported by circular dichroism studies."
https://openalex.org/W1563884529,"Abstract Specific effects of cadmium on nuclear protein kinase C activity were found with 3T3/10T1/2 mouse fibroblast and rat liver nuclei. Treatment of the mouse fibroblasts in culture with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate resulted in the stimulation of nuclear protein kinase C activity in a fixed pool which is defined by its resistance to chelator extraction, whereas the chelator extractable enzyme activity, defined as the labile pool was unaffected. Cadmium was found to potentiate the effect of the phorbol ester, directed specifically to nuclei, since the particulate protein kinase C activity was not changed under similar treatment. In a reconstituted system consisting of rat liver nuclei and rat brain protein kinase C, cadmium stimulated the binding of the enzyme to a 105-kDa nuclear protein. The binding of a 105-kDa protein to protein kinase C is attributed strictly due to the cadmium effect, whereas a 50-kDa protein binding to protein kinase C was only enhanced by cadmium. We propose a mechanistic model, where cadmium substitutes zinc in the regulatory domain of protein kinase C rendering the putative protein-protein binding site exposed."
https://openalex.org/W2160167738,"By using solid-state NMR spectroscopy, the integrity of the active center of alpha-chymotrypsin was investigated under a variety of nonaqueous conditions. Specifically, 13C cross-polarization/magic angle spinning NMR was used to analyze the ability of alpha-chymotrypsin to stabilize a transition state intermediate analog after freezing, drying, and addition of organic solvents (both anhydrous and hydrated) to the resultant powder. Lyophilization disrupted 42 +/- 5% of the active centers; it was determined that this occurred during drying, as opposed to freezing. Seven anhydrous solvents caused 0-50% additional disruption, which occurred immediately on addition of the solvent to the enzyme powder. The extent of structural integrity loss correlated with the solvent hydrophobicity, indicating that further dehydration, i.e. stripping of water retained by the enzyme during lyophilization, was the cause. Enzyme samples prepared with lyoprotecting additives, sucrose and ammonium sulfate, exhibited varying degrees of stabilization against the drying step of lyophilization. Moreover, when hydrophilic anhydrous solvents, which had the highest propensity to strip bound water, were added to the resultant enzyme powders, no additional damage occurred."
https://openalex.org/W1595377726,"The melanin operon (melC) of Streptomyces antibioticus is composed of two genes that encode MelC1 and MelC2 proteins. MelC1 has been suggested as a trans-activator which can facilitate the incorporation of copper into the apotyrosinase (MelC2) (Lee, Y.-H. W., Chen, B.-F., Wu, S.-Y., Leu, W.-M., Lin, J.-J., Chen, C. W., and Lo, S. J. (1988) Gene (Amst.) 65, 71-81). However, the molecular mechanism of the trans-activation or copper-transfer process mediated through MelC1 to MelC2 is not clear yet. In this study, we found apotyrosinase in both the extracellular fraction and cell extract from cells grown in copper-deficient medium. Using gel-filtration and immunoaffinity chromatographies, we demonstrated that apotyrosinase (MelC2) formed a stable complex with MelC1 in the intra- and extracellular fractions. Furthermore, addition of copper ion to the complex generated tyrosinase activity. The MelC1-MelC2 complex was purified to near homogeneity by DE52 and phenyl-agarose chromatographies. In conjunction with fast protein liquid gel filtration chromatography and NH2-terminal sequencing analysis, the results indicated that the stoichiometric ratio of MelC1 and MelC2 in the purified complex was 1:1. Essentially no copper was found in the complex. Addition of copper ion to the purified complex resulted in incorporation of approximately 2 molecules of copper ion and the mature active tyrosinase was gradually released from the complex. Taken together, these results demonstrate that the molecular mechanism of activation of Streptomyces apotyrosinase by its trans-activator MelC1 is initially mediated via a binary complex formation between these two proteins, followed by incorporation of copper ion. This activation mechanism accounts for the essential role of MelC1 in the expression of melanin operon."
https://openalex.org/W1596072788,"Ferredoxin is a chloroplast stroma protein which is cytosolically synthesized as a precursor with an amino-terminal extension called the transit sequence that is needed for the post-translational uptake by the chloroplast. To characterize the secondary and tertiary structure elements, the full precursor, the holo- and apo- (without iron-sulfur cluster) forms of the mature protein, and the chemically synthesized transit peptide were obtained and analyzed separately. Circular dichroism, tryptophan fluorescence quenching, and protease accessibility experiments indicate that the precursor has a low content of defined secondary structure and resembles unfolded proteins; these properties are due to both the mature part and the transit sequence. This result provides an explanation for the lack of cytosolic factor requirement of this protein for import. In an import competition assay, the isolated transit peptide had an affinity for the chloroplasts comparable to the full precursor. Interestingly and of possible importance to the import process, the transit peptide has conformational flexibility as it adopts alternative secondary structures in different environments."
https://openalex.org/W1544393038,"The roles of tyrosine 9 and aspartic acid 101 in the catalytic mechanism of rat glutathione S-transferase YaYa were studied by site-directed mutagenesis. Replacement of tyrosine 9 with phenylalanine (Y9F), threonine (Y9T), histidine (Y9H), or valine (Y9V) resulted in mutant enzymes with less than 5% catalytic activity of the wild type enzymes. Kinetic studies with purified Y9F and Y9T mutants demonstrated poor catalytic efficiencies which were largely due to a drastic decrease in kcat. The estimated pK alpha values of the sulfhydryl group of glutathione bound to Y9F and Y9T mutant enzymes were 8.5 to 8.7, similar to the chemical reaction, in contrast to the estimated pK alpha value of 6.7 to 6.8 for the glutathione enzyme complex of wild type glutathione S-transferase. These results indicate that tyrosine 9 is directly responsible for the lowering of the pKa of the sulfhydryl group of glutathione, presumably due to the stabilization of the thiolate anion through hydrogen bonding with the hydroxyl group of tyrosine. To examine the role of aspartic acid in the binding of glutathione to YaYa, 4 conserved aspartic acid residues at positions 61, 93, 101, and 157 were changed to glutamic acid and asparagine. All mutant enzymes retained either full or partial activity except D157N, which was virtually inactive. Kinetic studies with four mutant enzymes (D93E, D93N, D101E, and D101N) indicate that only D101N exhibited a 5-fold increase in Km toward glutathione. Also, the binding of this mutant to the affinity column was greatly reduced. These results demonstrate that aspartic acid 101 plays an important role in glutathione interaction to YaYa. The role of aspartic acid 157 in catalysis remains to be determined."
https://openalex.org/W12438406,"We investigated the interaction of the N-formyl peptide receptor (NFPR) with G proteins in infected Sf9 insect cells expressing the recombinant NFPR. Recombinant receptor expression of up to 27 pmol/mg protein was achieved in these cells. The receptor was recognized by an antiserum raised against an NFPR carboxyl-terminal peptide, and displayed specific and saturable binding of the formyl peptide ligand fMet-Leu-[3H]Phe. Scatchard analysis of the binding data yielded a dissociation constant of approximately 62 nM, a binding affinity of 60- to 120-fold lower than that of the high affinity sites in neutrophils and in transfected mammalian cell lines expressing the NFPR. That this low binding affinity was due to a lack of receptor coupling to G protein was suggested by the failure of guanine nucleotides to regulate receptor affinity and by the lack of formyl peptide-stimulated GTPase activity in these cells. Furthermore, immunoblotting with an anti-G(i) antibody and ADP-ribosylation experiments indicated that the approximately 40-kDa G(i) alpha subunit, which couples to the NFPR in neutrophils, is not present in Sf9 cell membranes. Thus, the current study provides for the first time evidence that a major G protein is absent in the Sf9 insect cells. Potential applications of the Sf9 system for in vitro reconstitution of the NFPR-G protein interaction are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1559216832,"The tyrosinase of Streptomyces antibioticus is encoded by the second open reading frame, melC2 of the melanin operon (melC). The upstream open reading frame melC1 specifies a 146-amino acid protein with a typical NH2-terminal signal-peptide characteristic of a secretory protein. The MelC1 protein is involved in the transfer of copper ion to apotyrosinase MelC2 via binary complex formation (Lee, Y.-H. W., Chen, B.-F., Wu, S.-Y., Leu, W.-M., Lin, J.-J., Chen, C. W., and Lo, S. J. (1988) Gene (Amst.) 65, 71-81; Chen, L.-Y., Leu, W.-M., Wang, K.-T., and Lee, Y.-H.W. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 20100-20107). To investigate whether the export of tyrosinase is also dependent on MelC1, a mutational study of its signal-peptide sequence was performed. Four different mutants were obtained. Mutation at the positively charged region (mutant M-6LE, Arg6-Arg7----Leu6-Glu7) or the hydrophobic region (mutant M-16D, Val16----Asp16) led to Mel- phenotypes. These lesions caused a severe 7-10-fold reduction of the export of both the MelC1 and MelC2 proteins and a concomitant accumulation of the two proteins in the cytosolic fraction. The cell-associated tyrosinase activity in M-6LE but not in the M-16D mutant was dramatically reduced to 4% of the activity found in the wild type strain, suggesting that the basic NH2 terminus of MelC1 is also important for the trans-activation function of this protein. Nevertheless, the defects on the trans-activation and/or secretory functions of MelC1 in mutants M-6LE and M-16D are not due to the impairment of the formation of the MelC1.MelC2 complex. The translation of melanin operon genes in these two mutants also decreased. In contrast, the tyrosinase activity and the secretion of MelC2 were not affected if the mutations occurred at the putative cleavage site of the signal peptidase (e.g. mutant M-29SM, Arg29-Ala30----Ser29-Met30 or mutant 29-SMG, Arg29-Ala30-Asp31----Ser29-Med30-Gly31+ ++). Additionally, tyrosinase activity and its export were abolished in a MelC1-negative mutant, M-950. Taken together, these results demonstrate that a functional MelC1 is essential for tyrosinase secretion and activity. Furthermore, the results suggest that like other secretory proteins, basic and hydrophobic residues in the MelC1 signal sequence are an important feature of the signal-peptide and play a pivotal role in the secretion of both the MelC1 and MelC2 proteins.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
https://openalex.org/W1518957070,"Transforming growth factor TGF-beta 2 is encoded by multiple mRNA transcripts of 5.8, 5.1, 4.0, 3.8, and 2.8 kilobase pairs (kb) that are expressed in various human and monkey cells. Northern blot analysis using genomic fragments of DNA was used to demonstrate that some of this size heterogeneity is due to differences in the length of the 5'-untranslated region. Probes that were colinear with the first 600 nucleotides of the 5'-untranslated region detected only the 5.8-, 4.0-, and 3.8-kb transcripts. In order to identify DNA elements that regulate the transcription of these mRNA transcripts, deletion constructs of 5'-flanking DNA were ligated to the coding region for chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) and analyzed for promoter activity in several cell lines. Sequences responsible for putative enhancer and silencer regions were identified between -778 and -40 relative to the transcription initiation site. Addition of a cyclic AMP-responsive element/activating transcription factor-like element at -74 resulted in a 5-10-fold increase in CAT activity over that expressed with a construct that contained only the TATA box. This increase in CAT activity was suppressed by the addition of DNA sequences between -257 and -187, whereas sequences between -778 and -257 stimulated CAT activity. Point mutations within the ATF binding site at -74 resulted in a marked decrease in CAT expression. Cotransfection with ATF-1 or ATF-2 expression plasmids resulted in both dose-dependent stimulatory and inhibitory activities that were cell type-dependent. These studies identify multiple transcription initiation sites for TGF-beta 2 and demonstrate that transcription from one of these promoters is dependent upon an ATF binding site located 5' of the TATA box."
https://openalex.org/W2149979135,"Cysteine 319 in the large subunit of Klebsiella aerogenes urease was identified as an essential catalytic residue based on chemical modification studies (Todd, M.J., and Hausinger, R.P. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 24327-24331). Through site-directed mutagenesis, this cysteine has been changed independently to alanine, serine, aspartate, and tyrosine. None of these mutations (C319A, C319S, C319D, and C319Y, respectively) affected the size or level of synthesis of the urease subunits as monitored by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The wild type enzyme and each of the mutant proteins was purified and their properties were compared. The C319Y protein possessed no detectable activity, while activity was reduced in C319A, C319S, and C319D to 48, 4.5, and 0.03% of wild type levels under normal assay conditions. All of the active mutants had a small increase in Km when compared to the wild type value. The active mutants displayed a greatly reduced sensitivity to inactivation by iodoacetamide in comparison to the wild type enzyme, confirming our previous assignment of the essential cysteine to this residue based on active site peptide mapping. In contrast to the wild type enzyme, inactivation of the mutant proteins was not affected by the presence of the competitive inhibitor phosphate, suggesting that the remaining slow rate of iodoacetamide inactivation is due to modification away from the active site. The pH dependence of urease activity was substantially altered in the active mutants with C319S and C319D showing a pH optimum near 5.2, and C319A near 6.7, compared to the pH 7.75 optimum of wild type urease. These data are consistent with Cys-319 facilitating catalysis at neutral and basic pH values by participating as a general acid."
https://openalex.org/W1522151606,"Endothelial cells expose specific receptors for blood clotting factors and, upon perturbation, can initiate and propagate the reactions of the extrinsic pathway of blood coagulation leading to fibrin formation on the cell surface. The existence of an intrinsic mechanism of Factor IX activation on cultured human umbilical vein cells (HUVECs) was investigated by studies of the interaction between HUVECs and two proteins of the contact activation system, the cofactor high molecular weight kininogen (H-kininogen) and the zymogen Factor XI. In the presence of zinc ions (10-300 microM), 125I-labeled H-kininogen bound to HUVECs in a time-dependent, reversible, and saturable manner, with calcium ions exerting an inhibitory effect on the zinc-dependent binding. Analysis of the binding data by the LIGAND computer program indicated that HUVECs, in the presence of 2 mM CaCl2 and 100 microM ZnCl2 at 37 degrees C, bound 1.14 x 10(7) H-kininogen molecules per cell with an apparent dissociation constant of 55 nM. HUVEC-bound H-kininogen functions as the cell surface receptor for both 125I-labeled Factor XI and 125I-labeled Factor XIa, since HUVECs cultured in contact factor-depleted serum do not detectably bind either the zymogen or the enzyme in the absence of H-kininogen and zinc ions. In the presence of saturating concentrations of H-kininogen, 2 mM CaCl2 and 100 microM ZnCl2, the binding of 125I-labeled Factor XI and Factor XIa to HUVECs was time-dependent, reversible, and saturable, with apparent dissociation constants of 4.5 and 1.5 nM, respectively. HUVEC-bound complexes of H-kininogen and Factor XI generated Factor XIa activity only after the addition of purified Factor XIIa, and cell-bound Factor XIa in turn activated Factor IX, as documented by a 3H-labeled activation peptide release assay for 3H-Factor IX activation. The results indicate that cultured HUVECs provide a surface for the assembly and expression of an intrinsic Factor IX activator complex that may participate in the initiation of blood coagulation at sites of vascular injury."
https://openalex.org/W1582536955,"H-protein, a component of the glycine cleavage system with lipoic acid as a prosthetic group, was expressed in Escherichia coli using a T7 RNA polymerase plasmid expression system. After induction with 25 microM isopropyl-beta-D-thiogalactopyranoside, bacteria harboring the recombinant plasmid expressed mature bovine H-protein as a soluble form at a level of about 10% of the total bacterial protein. Little of the H-protein was lipoylated in E. coli cultured without added lipoate, but when the cells were cultured in medium supplemented with 30 microM lipoate, about 10% of the recombinant protein expressed was the correctly lipoylated active form, 10% was an inactive aberrantly modified form, presumably with an octanoyl group, and the remaining 80% was the unlipoylated apoform. Each of the three forms was purified to homogeneity and shown to have the same NH2-terminal amino acid sequence as that of native bovine H-protein. The specific activity of the lipoylated form of H-protein expressed was consistent with that of H-protein purified from bovine liver. The purified recombinant apo-H-protein was lipoylated and consequently activated in vitro with lipoyl-AMP as a lipoyl donor by lipoyltransferase purified 150-fold from bovine liver mitochondria. The lipoylation was dependent on lipoyl-AMP, apo-H-protein, and lipoyltransferase. The partially purified lipoyltransferase had no lipoate-activating activity. These results provide the first evidence that in mammals two consecutive reactions are required for the attachment of lipoic acid to the acceptor protein: the activation of lipoic acid to lipoyl-AMP catalyzed by lipoate-activating enzyme and the transfer of the lipoyl group to an N epsilon-amino group of a lysine residue to apoprotein by lipoyl-AMP:N epsilon-lysine lipoyltransferase."

These include two closed complexes that are sensitive to heparin attack, and one open complex.

The effector ppGpp does not prevent closed complex formation but does reduce the level of open complexes that form."
https://openalex.org/W1601178986,"The activity of human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) protease has been examined as a function of solvent composition, incubation time, and enzyme concentration at 37 degrees C in the pH 4.5-5.5 range. Glycerol and dimethyl sulfoxide inhibit the enzyme, while polyethylene glycol and bovine serum albumin activate the enzyme. When incubated at a concentration of 50-200 nM, the activity of the protease decreases irreversibly with an apparent first-order rate constant of 4-9 x 10(-3) min-1. The presence of 0.1% (w/v) polyethylene glycol or bovine serum albumin in the reaction buffer dramatically stabilizes enzyme activity. In the absence of prolonged incubation of the enzyme at submicromolar concentration, the specific activity of HIV-1 protease in buffers of either high or low ionic strength is constant over the enzyme concentration range of 0.25-5 nM, indicating that dissociation of the dimeric protease, if occurring, can only be governed by a picomolar dissociation constant. Similarly, the variation of the specific activity of HIV-2 protease over the enzyme concentration of 4-85 nM is consistent only with a dimer dissociation constant of less than 10 nM. We conclude that: 1) the assumption of a nondissociating HIV-1 protease is a valid one for kinetic studies of tight-binding inhibitors where nanomolar concentrations of the enzymes are employed; 2) stock protease solutions of submicromolar concentration in the absence of activity-stabilizing compounds may lead to erroneous kinetic data and complicate mechanistic interpretations."
https://openalex.org/W17512697,"The tryptophanase (tna) operon of Proteus vulgaris was cloned and characterized and found to be organized similarly to the tna operon of Escherichia coli. Both operons contain two major structural genes, tnaA and tnaB, that encode tryptophanase and a tryptophan permease, respectively. tnaA of P. vulgaris is preceded by a transcribed leader region, encoding a 34-residue leader peptide, TnaC, that contains a single tryptophan residue. The tnaC coding region also has a boxA-like sequence. Regulatory studies performed in P. vulgaris, and with a plasmid carrying the P. vulgaris tna operon in E. coli, established that expression of the Proteus operon was induced by tryptophan and was subject to catabolite repression. Site-directed mutagenesis studies established that translation of the tnaC coding region was essential for induction. Synthesis of the P. vulgaris leader peptide was demonstrated in an in vitro coupled transcription-translation system. Interestingly, the 5 amino acid residues of the TnaC peptide surrounding the sole tryptophan residue are identical in P. vulgaris and E. coli. We conclude that the tna operon of P. vulgaris is also regulated by tryptophan-induced transcription antitermination. Homology of tryptophanase and tryptophan permease of P. vulgaris to related proteins from other species is described."
https://openalex.org/W1534165887,"A large, alternate form of type XII collagen has been identified in cultures of the human epidermoid cell line WISH. This form, designated XIIA, is comprised of alpha chains that are approximately 90 kDa larger than the 220-kDa alpha chain previously characterized in extracts of fetal chicken and bovine tissues. Results from both collagenase digestion and rotary shadow analysis of partially purified material show that the increase is due to a larger NC3 domain. While both the large (XIIA) and the small (XIIB) forms of type XII collagen are identified in pulse-chase radiolabeling of fetal bovine skin explant culture, they are not related in a precursor-product fashion. Inhibition studies with alpha, alpha'-dipyridyl indicate that proper folding of the collagen helix is required for complete assembly and secretion of type XIIA in WISH cell culture. The 310-kDa alpha 1A chain is likely to represent the bovine equivalent of a second translation product, estimated to be 340 kDa, predicted from analysis of one complete chick cDNA sequence. Additionally, the amino-terminal amino acid sequence of the 220-kDa bovine alpha 1B chain was determined. This sequence is very near a potential alternate splice site predicted from analysis of chicken type XII cDNA."
https://openalex.org/W1540439020,"Polyclonal antibodies were raised against purified protein components of the U2 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) from Trypanosoma brucei. Through immunoblot and immunoprecipitation analyses three antisera were characterized that reacted specifically with U2 snRNP proteins of molecular weights 40,000 (anti-40K) and 16,500 (anti-16.5K), and with each of four proteins of molecular weights 14,000, 12,500, 10,000, and 8,500 (anti-CP). Anti-40K antibodies specifically immunoprecipitated the U2 snRNP from trypanosomal extracts, whereas anti-CP antibodies recognized several snRNPs, including the SL RNP and the U2 and U4/U6 snRNPs; in addition, minor RNAs were detected, suggesting that a family of snRNPs with common or related protein components exists in trypanosomes. None of these antibodies cross-reacted significantly with total mammalian snRNP proteins, indicating that the trypanosomal snRNP proteins are immunologically distinct from their mammalian counterparts. Using immunofluorescence microscopy, the snRNP proteins exhibited a differential cellular distribution. Whereas the 40-kDa protein is localized exclusively in the nucleus, with the nucleolus being excluded, a fraction of the common proteins also resides in the cytoplasm."
https://openalex.org/W70085717,"Most missense mutations of the lipoprotein lipase (LPL) gene identified among LPL-deficient subjects cluster in a segment of the sequence that encodes the catalytic triad as well as functional elements involved in the activation of the lipase at lipid-water interfaces. Consequently, loss of activity may result either from direct alterations of such functional elements or from less specific effects on protein folding and stability. This issue was addressed by examining biochemical properties of four such variants (A176T, G188E, G195E, and S244T) in a heterologous expression system (COS-1 cells). Variant G195E (GGA----GAA) was previously unreported. In all instances, inactive enzyme was recovered in medium, albeit at reduced levels. Cellular synthesis and extracellular degradation were similar to those for wild type, suggesting that reduced secretion resulted from increased intracellular degradation. When cell extracts were subjected to heparin-Superose affinity chromatography followed by elution on a linear salt gradient, all variants exhibited a single, inactive, low affinity immunoreactive peak. By contrast, wild-type enzyme presented an additional, high affinity, active species, which we interpret as homodimeric enzyme. Substitution of the active-site serine (S132A) led to loss of activity but maintenance of the high affinity species. When large amounts of the G188E variant were applied to the column, small but significant amounts of high affinity, active enzyme were recovered. Systematic substitutions at residue 188 showed that only glycine could accommodate structural constraints at this position. We conclude that the mutations examined did not impart lipase deficiency by affecting specific functional elements of the enzyme. Rather, they appear to affect protein folding and stability, and thereby formation and maintenance of subunit assembly."
https://openalex.org/W1505977245,"The epoxyeicosatrienoic acids derived from the cytochrome P-450 pathway of arachidonic acid metabolism have a unique platelet antiaggregatory profile. This prompted us to examine their influence on cellular Ca2+ mobilization. 14,15-cis-Epoxyeicosatrienoic acid and related compounds inhibited the rise in cytosolic Ca2+ following agonist stimulation of platelets by thapsigargin, a receptor-independent agonist, and thrombin, a receptor-dependent agonist. The epoxyeicosatrienoic acids selectively inhibited the entry of Ca2+ from the exterior of the platelets but did not alter Ca2+ discharge from intracellular pools. The magnitude of inhibition by 14,15-cis-epoxyeicosatrienoic acid was proportional to the rate of Ca2+ entry. 14,15-cis-Epoxyeicosatrienoic acid also inhibited the rate of influx of Mn2+, a cation which enters platelets via pathways similar to Ca2+. The magnitude of inhibition was proportional to the rate of Mn2+ entry, suggesting that epoxyeicosatrienoic acids act on divalent cation channels in a fashion which depends on the state of opening of the channel. Selective inhibition of Ca2+ entry into platelets may account for the antiaggregatory effects of the epoxyeicosatrienoic acids. We are unaware of other endogenous compounds exhibiting this property, suggesting that epoxyeicosatrienoic acids may be useful to probe agonist-stimulated Ca2+ mobilization in nonexcitable cells."
https://openalex.org/W1520133610,"In this study, we demonstrate the presence of a unique membrane-associated transacetylase that transfers the acetate group from platelet-activating factor (PAF) to lysoplasmalogen (in the presence of EDTA and sodium acetate) with the formation of 1-alk-1-enyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (alk-1-enylacetyl-GPE). The identity of alk-1-enylacetyl-GPE was confirmed by acid hydrolysis, phospholipases A2 or C treatment and derivatization by fluorodinitrobenzene. The transacetylase has no requirement for Ca2+, Mg2+, or CoA and a broad pH optimum (7.0-8.0) with Km values of 12.0 microM for PAF and 106.4 microM for lysoplasmalogens. The enzyme activity from the isolated membrane fraction is not changed when whole cells are supplemented with 20:4, induced to differentiate into granulocytes, or treated with ionophore A23187. Radyllyso-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (GPC), radyllyso-GPE, acyllyso-sn-glycero-3-phosphoserine (GPS), acyllyso-sn-glycero-3-phosphoinositol (GPI), alkyllyso-sn-glycero-3-phosphate (GP), acyllyso-GP, or cis-9-octadecen-1-ol can also serve as acetate acceptors, whereas alkylglycerol, acylglycerol, or cholesterol are inactive. Differences in substrate acceptor specificity, sensitivity toward phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and response to temperature suggest that the CoA-independent transacetylase and the CoA-independent transacylase that transfers long-chain acyl moieties are two separate enzymes. With intact differentiated HL-60 cells, [3H]acetate from [3H]PAF can be incorporated into alk-1-enylacetyl-GPE in the presence of ionophore A23187, but not in its absence. Moreover, phospholipase A2 inhibitors (p-bromophenacyl bromide and mepacrine) block the transacetylation process in whole cell system. These results indicate the production of alk-1-enyllyso-GPE is a rate-limiting factor for the subsequent transacetylation step during cell activation. We conclude that the transacetylase may participate in the biosynthesis of ethanolamine plasmalogen and acyl analogs of PAF, in vivo, fine-tuning of PAF biological responses, and cross-talk between de novo and remodeling pathways of PAF biosynthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1611333844,"The AP-1 proteins (c-fos and fos-related antigens and jun proteins) are transcription factors that are induced in most cells by various stimuli, but the expression of these proteins is low or undetectable in the basal state. Our data indicate that the rat adrenal gland contains a basally expressed elevated level of AP-1 proteins and mRNAs (40- and 35-kDa fos-related antigens, a 39-kDa c-jun protein, c-jun, junB, and junD mRNA), as well as high basal AP-1 DNA binding activity. Both the medulla and cortex contained equivalent levels of fos-related antigens and c-jun protein; however, the majority of AP-1 DNA binding was detected in the medulla. Handling of rats for several days prior to sacrifice failed to affect protein expression or binding; on the other hand, repeated injections of nicotine increased AP-1 DNA binding. A single nicotine injection 60 min prior to removing the adrenals caused a significant reduction in AP-1 DNA binding without any detectable changes in AP-1 protein expression. Pretreatment of adrenal nuclear extracts with alkaline phosphatase prior to incubation with the AP-1 oligomer decreased binding activity. Thus, unlike most tissues where AP-1 DNA binding activity is controlled by increased expression of AP-1 proteins, DNA binding in the rat adrenal gland appears to be controlled at the post-translational level, possibly through dephosphorylation."
https://openalex.org/W1603207454,"The complete amino acid sequence of acidic chitinase from yam (Dioscorea japonica) aerial tubers was determined. The protein is composed of a single polypeptide chain of 250 amino acid residues and has a calculated molecular mass of 27,890 Da. There is an NH2-terminal domain, a hinge region, and a main structure, typical for class I chitinases (Shinshi, H., Neuhaus, J.-M., Ryals, J., and Meins, F., Jr. (1990) Plant Mol. Biol. 14, 357-368). We have obtained the first evidence for an acidic class I chitinase. Comparison with sequences of other class I chitinases revealed approximately 40% sequence similarity, a value lower than that for other class I chitinases (70-80%). We assume that there is a local conformational change in the molecule; cysteine residues that probably form disulfide bonds are completely conserved, with the exception of Cys-178. The difference in structure between this chitinase and other basic class I chitinases suggests that acidic and basic isoforms should be grouped into subclasses; this protein is an ethylene- or a pathogen-independent chitinase produced by a gene that is inherent in the tuber."
https://openalex.org/W1504209588,"Abstract Carbovir (9-[4 alpha-(hydroxymethyl)cyclopent-2-ene-1 alpha-yl]guanine) (CBV) is a carbocyclic analogue of 2',3'-dideoxyguanosine that exhibits potent and selective in vitro activity against human immunodeficiency virus. Antiviral activity is associated with only the (-)-enantiomer. The transport characteristics of both (-)-CBV and (+)-CBV were investigated in human erythrocytes at 37 degrees C using a papaverine-stop assay. The influx of both enantiomers appeared saturable and was inhibited greater than 90% by a combination of adenine (a low Km permeant of the nucleobase carrier) and dilazep (a potent inhibitor of nucleoside transport). The influx of (-)-CBV and (+)-CBV proceeded primarily via the nucleobase carrier with Vmax (picomoles/second/5 microliters of cells)/Km (millimolar) values of 17/0.12 and 140/1.9, respectively. To a lesser extent, the influx of (-)-CBV and (+)-CBV also occurred via the nucleoside transporter. Although both compounds exhibited a similar low affinity for this latter carrier (Km approximately 2 mM), the Vmax for (-)-CBV influx was approximately 4-fold higher than the Vmax for (+)-CBV influx. We conclude that both CBV enantiomers enter human erythrocytes by two transporters that are enantiomerically selective."
https://openalex.org/W1492303976,"To investigate the mechanism(s) by which all-transretinoic acid (RA) inhibits cell growth, we studied its effect on the expression of c-fos and c-jun in B16 melanoma cells. RA differentially inhibited proto-oncogene induction by mitogens, such as phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and serum. Suppression of c-fos was achieved with doses of RA as low as 10(-10) M and required pretreatment of cells with RA for a minimum of 2 h. In contrast, inhibition of c-jun required pretreatment for greater than 16 h with at least 10(-8) M RA and coincided with the observed decrease in cell growth. RA blocked c-fos induction by inhibiting transcription. This inhibition of transcription occurs through the serum response element (SRE), since the SRE alone was sufficient to confer down-regulation by RA to a minimal c-fos promoter construct. Thus, the SRE plays a critical role in the suppression of c-fos transcription by RA."
https://openalex.org/W1613380815,"Pulmonary alveolar type II cells synthesize, secrete, and recycle the components of pulmonary surfactant. In this report we present evidence that dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine is a potent inhibitor of surfactant lipid secretion by type II cells. Monoenoic and dienoic phosphatidylcholines with fatty acids of 16 or 18 carbons are ineffective as inhibitors of surfactant lipid secretion. In contrast, disaturated phosphatidylcholines, with either symmetric or asymmetric pairs of fatty acids of 14, 16, or 18 carbons, exhibit inhibition of surfactant secretion that correlates extremely well with the phase transition temperature (Tc) of the phospholipid. The inhibitory activity of dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine is not dependent upon lipid stereochemistry. N-Methylated derivatives of dipalmitoylphosphatidylethanolamine are significantly less effective than phosphatidylcholine as inhibitors. Phosphatidylcholines below their phase transition temperature are inhibitors of surfactant secretion, whereas those above their phase transition temperature are either ineffective or weakly inhibitory. The phase transition dependence of inhibition is observed when type II cells are incubated at 37 degrees C with different species of phosphatidylcholine. In addition, if type II cells are stimulated to secrete at different temperatures the efficacy of a given phospholipid as an inhibitor is dependent on its relationship to Tc (i.e. dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine with a Tc of 41 degrees C significantly inhibits secretion at 37 degrees C but not at 42 degrees C). Inhibition of surfactant secretion by dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine is abrogated when it is incorporated into the same liposome with dioleoylphosphatidylcholine as a 50:50 mixture. In contrast, the simultaneous addition of two separate populations of liposomes, one composed of dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine and the other composed of dioleoylphosphatidylcholine, does not significantly alter the inhibitory activity found with dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine alone. These data provide compelling evidence that the physical state of phosphatidylcholine can regulate surfactant secretion from alveolar type II cells and suggest a unique mechanism for regulating exocytosis in the alveolus of the lung."
https://openalex.org/W197793391,"The peptide PEC-60, structurally related to the pancreatic secretory trypsin inhibitor, inhibits glucose-induced insulin secretion. Here we report on the structure of a cDNA clone from pig duodenum encoding PEC-60. The cDNA encodes a 86-amino acid long precursor protein containing a 26-amino acid signal sequence, implying that the mature PEC-60 peptide is secreted from cells. Analysis of porcine duodenum demonstrated a high expression of a 0.6-kilobase long PEC-60 mRNA in this tissue, as well as the presence of strong PEC-60-like immunoreactivity in the cytoplasm of the majority of the goblet cells of the epithelium. High levels of PEC-60 mRNA were also found in the bone marrow and the peripheral blood and moderate levels in the spleen. A strong PEC-60-like immunoreactivity was localized in the monocytes of peripheral blood. Radioimmunoassay revealed high levels of pig PEC-60-like immunoreactivity in pig plasma suggesting that the PEC-60 peptide is efficiently released from cells. These findings imply that the gastrointestinal peptide PEC-60 is formed, stored, and secreted from monocytes present within the bone marrow and in the peripheral blood, indicating a role of the PEC-60 peptide in the immune system in addition to its function as a gastrointestinal peptide."
https://openalex.org/W1518113725,"To characterize envelope proteins encoded by the chloroplast genome, envelopes were isolated from Chlamydomonas reinhardtii cells labeled with [35S] sulfate while blocking synthesis by cytoplasmic ribosomes. One and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis of envelopes and fluorography revealed four highly labeled proteins. Two with masses of 29 and 30 kDa and pI 5.5 were absent from the stroma and thylakoid fractions, while the others at 54 kDa, pI 5.2 and 61 kDa, pI 5.4 were detected there in smaller amounts. The 29- and 30-kDa proteins were associated with outer envelope membranes separated from inner envelope membranes after chloroplast lysis in hypertonic solution. A 32-kDa protein not labeled by [35S]sulfate was found exclusively in the inner membrane fraction, suggesting the existence of a phosphate translocator in C. reinhardtii. To identify envelope proteins exposed on the chloroplast surface, isolated active chloroplasts were surface-labeled with 125I and lactoperoxidase. The 54-kDa, pI 5.2 protein as well as a protein corresponding to either of the 29- or 30-kDa proteins described above were among the labeled components. These results show that envelope proteins of C. reinhardtii are encoded by the chloroplast genome and two are located on the outer envelope membranes."
https://openalex.org/W1595312782,"The mechanism and stereochemistry in connection with enzymatic conversion of cholesta-4,6-dien-3-one into cholestanol was studied. Rat and mouse liver microsomes are able to catalyze NADPH-dependent sequential saturation of the two double bonds. Evidence was obtained that the saturation of the delta 6-double bond includes transfer of a hydride ion from the B-side of the cofactor to the 7-position of the steroid (mainly 7 beta-position), followed by addition of a proton to the 6 alpha-position (mainly trans addition). The saturation of the delta 4-double bond includes transfer of a hydride ion from the B-side of the cofactor to the 5 alpha-position of the steroid followed by addition of a proton to the 4 beta-position (trans addition). The reduction of the 3-oxo group was found to involve transfer of a hydride ion from the B-side of the cofactor NADPH to the 3 alpha-position of the steroid. The results are in accord with the contention that the enzymatic saturation of the two double bonds involves a polarization of the 3-oxo group making C-7 electrophilic and C-6 nucleophilic in connection with the saturation of the delta 6-double bond and C-5 electrophilic and C-4 nucleophilic in connection with the saturation of the delta 4-double bond."
https://openalex.org/W1600881770,"Synthetic glycosides containing the core, -Glc-NAc beta 1,6GalNAc alpha-, acted as acceptors for beta-galactosyltransferase of human ovarian tumor. A significant amount of Gal was transferred from UDP-Gal (100 nmol) to the alpha-benzylglycoside of LacNAc beta 1,6GalNAc (LGBn) (25.1 nmol of Gal) and the alpha-ortho-nitrophenylglycosides of LacNAc beta 1,6GalNAc (22.0 nmol of Gal), GlcNAc beta 1,6GalNAc (15.5 nmol of Gal), and Fuc alpha 1,3GlcNAc beta 1,6GalNAc (25.9 nmol of Gal); LacNAc beta 1,6(Gal beta 1,3)GalNAc alpha-O-Bn (where Bn is benzyl) was almost inactive (only 1.2 nmol of Gal), indicating the Gal transfer to the alpha-GalNAc moiety. The product from LGBn was isolated in microgram quantities and identified by fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry as LacNAc beta 1,6(Gal beta 1,3)GalNAc alpha-O-Bn. The alpha GalNAc:beta 1,3Gal transferase was present in high concentration in ovarian tumor tissue (ovarian cancer serum----1.4; ascitic fluid----0.9; tumor----17.4). Asialo Cowper's gland mucin (ACGM) at 5 mg/ml reaction mixture inhibited the transfer of Gal to LGBn (25.2 and 53.4% respectively for 2 and 18 h incubation at 37 degrees C); inhibition by LGBn was 13.4 and 24.5%, respectively. In contrast to the inhibition by ACGM (25.2-31.6%), there was substantial increase (13.4-35.7%) in the inhibition by LGBn, when the incubation for 2 h at 37 degrees C was continued for 40 h at 4 degrees C, indicating the high affinity of LGBn for the enzyme at lower temp. Km for LGBn in presence of ACGM was 7.6 mM and in absence, 2.7 mM; Km for ACGM (M(r) 200,000) in presence of LGBn was 16.1 microM and Ki for ACGM (as the inhibitor) was 41.7 microM. In comparison with two normal ovarian tissues, the enzyme was found to be low (55-67%) in three ovarian tumors and high (146-260%) in two ovarian and one uterus tumors, as measured with ACGM; the synthetic acceptors showed similar activities. The enzyme had nearly the same extent of activity in the pH range 6-8. Fuc alpha 1,3GlcNAc beta 1,6GalNAc alpha-O-ONP had the highest affinity for the enzyme. The present study demonstrates the feasibility of beta 1,3Gal attachment on alpha GalNAc, which has already been substituted by beta 1,6GlcNAc, then elongated by beta 1,4Gal and also terminated by alpha 1,3Fuc."
https://openalex.org/W1542180436,"An expression vector for bovine NADH-cytochrome b5 reductase was used for site-directed mutagenesis of lysine 110, the residue previously implicated in NADH interactions with this flavoprotein. Replacement of this basic residue with an uncharged glutamine resulted in an increase of 3 orders of magnitude in the Km for NADH and a decrease in kcat of an order of magnitude, strongly implicating lysine 110 in both binding of NADH to the reductase and the orientation of the reduced nicotinamide group for rapid hydride ion transfer to the flavin. Substitution of lysine 110 by histidine, to provide a pH-sensitive positive charge at this position in the neutral pH range, exhibited only a moderate 25-fold increase in Km and a normal kcat at pH 6.0, whereas at pH 8.5 the Km for NADH rose to 238 microM with a decrease of 45% over unmodified enzyme in the kcat. A similar pH sensitivity in the inhibition constant for adenosine diphosphate ribose, lacking only the nicotinamide moiety of NADH, emphasizes the crucial role of the positive charge at this locus and is consistent with charge-pairing of lysine 110 with the pyrophosphate group of NADH or adenosine diphosphate ribose."
https://openalex.org/W1502991939,"Bovine factor Va has been previously been shown to consist of heavy (M(r) = 94,000) and light chains (M(r) = 81,000), that interact in a manner dependent upon the presence of either calcium or manganese ions. In an attempt to understand the mechanism of subunit interaction we have studied the effects of temperature and ions on factor Va stability. The rates of formation of factor Va from isolated chains and dissociation were temperature-dependent with an energy of activation of 6.2 and 1.3 kcal mol-1, respectively. The yield of factor Va from isolated chains was inversely related to the amount of time the chains were incubated at 4 degrees C. Incubation of individual chains revealed that the heavy chain is cold-labile, an effect that is reversible. Manganese ion was observed to prevent the conversion to the inactive form. High salt tends to stabilize the two-chain structure of factor Va, but is inhibitory to its formation from isolated chains. High concentrations of either manganese or calcium ions also inhibited reconstitution of activity. The light chain, in particular, was sensitive to the presence of manganese or calcium ion. Heavy chain that had been cleaved by activated protein C had a weakened interaction with the light chain, and the resulting complex had no procoagulant activity. Cooling of the heavy chain to 4 degrees C enhanced its intrinsic fluorescence. Manganese ion prevented some of this enhancement. The heavy chain fluorescence returned to the room temperature value with a half-life of approximately 10 min. In the presence of manganese ion relaxation was accelerated. The intrinsic fluorescence of activated protein C-cleaved heavy chain was not increased when the temperature was decreased. These data suggest that the heavy chain can exist in two forms. Elevated temperature converts it to a form that can bind ions and have a productive interaction with the light chain. However, conditions that prevent the heavy chain from combining with the light chain also stabilize the two subunit structure, suggesting that the high affinity of the complex is due to conformational changes that occur after chain interaction."
https://openalex.org/W1531150180,"Extracellular stimuli affecting mechanisms of transcriptional control of the preproenkephalin gene link stimulus-secretion-synthesis coupling to transmitter phenotypic expression. In order to define distal and proximal genomic regions that might participate in transcriptionally active protein-DNA interactions, DNaseI hypersensitivity assays were conducted. Four DNaseI-hypersensitive regions were identified at -3000, -2500, -1800, and -200 base pairs (bp) relative to the somatic start site. The appearance of a site over the proximal promoter/enhancer region (-200 bp) is of interest since we and others have published a detailed footprint and functional analysis of this region using rat tissues. While liver (which does not express proenkephalin mRNA) displays essentially no hypersensitivity here, adrenal gland preparations show a strong signal and striatal tissue a significantly weaker signal. Cholinergic induction of proenkephalin mRNA was not associated with a change in hypersensitivity pattern. These data suggest that chromatin structure may have an influence on preproenkephalin transcriptional control and that cholinergic-inducible cis-acting DNA elements may reside within subdomains of at least these four hypersensitivity sites. Understanding the basis of this open chromatin structure should aid in identifying genomic mechanisms involved in tissue-specific expression and suggest avenues of future study."
