https://openalex.org/W2069988949,"Caloric restriction has been shown to increase longevity in organisms ranging from yeast to mammals. In some organisms, this has been associated with a decreased fat mass and alterations in insulin/insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) pathways. To further explore these associations with enhanced longevity, we studied mice with a fat-specific insulin receptor knockout (FIRKO). These animals have reduced fat mass and are protected against age-related obesity and its subsequent metabolic abnormalities, although their food intake is normal. Both male and female FIRKO mice were found to have an increase in mean life-span of approximately 134 days (18%), with parallel increases in median and maximum life-spans. Thus, a reduction of fat mass without caloric restriction can be associated with increased longevity in mice, possibly through effects on insulin signaling."

We computed the correlations of the seismic codas of 101 distant earthquakes recorded at stations that were tens of kilometers apart. By stacking cross-correlation functions of codas, we found a low-frequency coherent part in the diffuse field. The extracted pulses have the polarization characteristics and group velocities expected for Rayleigh and Love waves. The set of cross-correlations has the symmetries of the surface-wave part of the Green tensor. This seismological example shows that diffuse waves produced by distant sources are sufficient to retrieve direct waves between two perfectly located points of observation. Because it relies on general properties of diffuse waves, this result has potential applications in other fields."

https://openalex.org/W2051099219,Tunneling electrons from a scanning tunneling microscope (STM) were used to excite photon emission from individual porphyrin molecules adsorbed on an ultrathin alumina film grown on a NiAl(110) surface. Vibrational features were observed in the light-emission spectra that depended sensitively on the different molecular conformations and corresponding electronic states obtained by scanning tunneling spectroscopy. The high spatial resolution of the STM enabled the demonstration of variations in light-emission spectra from different parts of the molecule. These experiments realize the feasibility of fluorescence spectroscopy with the STM and enable the integration of optical spectroscopy with a nanoprobe for the investigation of single molecules.
https://openalex.org/W2170189698,"Expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), a key angiogenic protein, has been linked with pancreatic cancer progression. However, the molecular basis for VEGF overexpression remains unclear. Immunohistochemical studies have indicated that VEGF overexpression coincides with elevated Stat3 activation in human pancreatic cancer specimens. In our study, more than 80% of the human pancreatic cancer cell lines used exhibited constitutively activated Stat3, with Stat3 activation correlated with the VEGF expression level. Blockade of activated Stat3 via ectopic expression of dominant-negative Stat3 significantly suppressed VEGF expression, angiogenesis, tumor growth, and metastasis in vivo. Furthermore, constitutively activated Stat3 directly activated the VEGF promoter, whereas dominant-negative Stat3 inhibited the VEGF promoter. A putative Stat3-responsive element on the VEGF promoter was identified using a protein-DNA binding assay and confirmed using a promoter mutagenesis assay. These results indicate that Stat3 directly regulates VEGF expression and hence angiogenesis, growth, and metastasis of human pancreatic cancer, suggesting that Stat3 signaling may be targeted for treatment of pancreatic cancer."

Using new high-resolution functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) acquisition and analysis methods, we identified mnemonic properties of different subregions within the hippocampal circuitry as human subjects learned to associate names with faces. The cornu ammonis (CA) fields 2 and 3 and the dentate gyrus were active relative to baseline only during encoding, and this activity decreased as associations were learned. Activity in the subiculum showed the same temporal decline, but primarily during retrieval. Our results demonstrate that subdivisions within the hippocampus make distinct contributions to new memory formation."

https://openalex.org/W2047807761,"Steroid response and stress-activated genes such as hsp70 undergo puffing in Drosophila larval salivary glands, a local loosening of polytene chromatin structure associated with gene induction. We find that puffs acquire elevated levels of adenosine diphosphate (ADP)-ribose modified proteins and that poly(ADP)-ribose polymerase (PARP) is required to produce normal-sized puffs and normal amounts of Hsp70 after heat exposure. We propose that chromosomal PARP molecules become activated by developmental or environmental cues and strip nearby chromatin proteins off DNA to generate a puff. Such local loosening may facilitate transcription and may transiently make protein complexes more accessible to modification, promoting chromatin remodeling during development."

This pulse is designed to maximize the yield of the organometallic ion CpMn(CO) 5 while hindering the competing fragmentation. The sequential excitation and ionization of the target ion are accomplished by an optimized field consisting of two dominant subpulses with optimal frequencies and time delays.

Although the plant community in a pristine salt marsh was found to be limited primarily by nitrogen availability, the bacterial community in the soil was limited by phosphorus. Hence, in coastal wetlands, and possibly in many ecosystems, individual trophic groups may respond differently to nitrogen and phosphorus loading. Phosphorus limitation of the growth of nitrogen-transforming bacteria will affect carbon fixation, storage, and release mediated by plants, a result that has important implications for ecosystem management."
https://openalex.org/W1513985552,"There has been long-standing uncertainty about the number of water molecules in the primary coordination environment of the OH − and F − ions in aqueous chemistry. We report the vibrational spectra of the OH − ·(H 2 O) n and F − ·(H 2 O) n clusters and interpret the pattern of OH stretching fundamentals with ab initio calculations. The spectra of the cold complexes are obtained by first attaching weakly bound argon atoms to the clusters and then monitoring the photoinduced evaporation of these atoms when an infrared laser is tuned to a vibrational resonance. The small clusters ( n ≤ 3) display an isolated, sharp feature near the free OH stretching vibration, the signature of open solvation morphologies where each water molecule binds independently to the ion. Pronounced changes in the spectra are observed at n = 4 in the hydroxide ion and at n = 5 in the fluoride ion. In both cases, new features appear in the region typically associated with interwater hydrogen bonding. This behavior establishes that the primary hydration shells occur at n = 3 and 4 in hydroxide and fluoride, respectively."

Therefore, there has long been an urgent need for a robust and accurate predictive model for this spectrum. In our work on the high-resolution spectrum of water, we report first-principles calculations that approach experimental accuracy. To achieve this, we performed exceptionally large electronic structure calculations and considered a variety of effects, including quantum electrodynamics, which have routinely been neglected in studies of small many-electron molecules. The high accuracy of the resulting ab initio procedure is demonstrated for the main isotopomers of water."

We exchanged neural crest cells destined to participate in beak morphogenesis between two anatomically distinct species. Quail neural crest cells produced quail beaks in duck hosts and duck neural crest produced duck bills in quail hosts. These transformations involved morphological changes to non-neural crest host beak tissues. To achieve these changes, donor neural crest cells executed autonomous molecular programs and regulated gene expression in adjacent host tissues. Thus, neural crest cells are a source of molecular information that generates interspecific variation in beak morphology."
https://openalex.org/W2072584472,"SAP (or SH2D1A), an adaptor-like molecule expressed in immune cells, is composed almost exclusively of a Src homology 2 (SH2) domain1,2,3,4. In humans, SAP is mutated and either absent or non-functional in X-linked lymphoproliferative (XLP) syndrome, a disease characterized by an inappropriate response to Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection5. Through its SH2 domain, SAP associates with tyrosines in the cytoplasmic domain of the SLAM family of immune cell receptors, and is absolutely required for the function of these receptors1,6,7,8,9,10. This property results from the ability of SAP to promote the selective recruitment and activation of FynT, a cytoplasmic Src-related protein tyrosine kinase (PTK)8. Here, we demonstrate that SAP operates in this pathway by binding to the SH3 domain of FynT, through a second region in the SAP SH2 domain distinct from the phosphotyrosine-binding motif. We demonstrate that this interaction is essential for SAP-mediated signalling in T cells, and for the capacity of SAP to modulate immune cell function. These observations characterize a biologically important signalling mechanism in which an adaptor molecule composed only of an SH2 domain links a receptor devoid of intrinsic catalytic activity to the kinase required for its function."

Microwave modulation of the Landé g tensor produces frequency-modulated electron spin precession. Driving at the Larmor frequency results in g-tensor modulation resonance, which is functionally equivalent to electron spin resonance but without the use of time-dependent magnetic fields. These results provide proof of the concept that quantum spin information can be locally manipulated with the use of high-speed electrical circuits."
https://openalex.org/W1633357948,"Disruption of the adaptor protein ELF, a β-spectrin, leads to disruption of transforming growth factor–β (TGF-β) signaling by Smad proteins in mice. Elf −/− mice exhibit a phenotype similar to smad2 +/− / smad3 +/− mutant mice of midgestational death due to gastrointestinal, liver, neural, and heart defects. We show that TGF-β triggers phosphorylation and association of ELF with Smad3 and Smad4, followed by nuclear translocation. ELF deficiency results in mislocalization of Smad3 and Smad4 and loss of the TGF-β–dependent transcriptional response, which could be rescued by overexpression of the COOH-terminal region of ELF. This study reveals an unexpected molecular link between a major dynamic scaffolding protein and a key signaling pathway."

After ultraviolet (UV)-induced DNA damage in Escherichia coli, replication recovery requires RecA and several other recF pathway proteins. To characterize the mechanism by which lesion-blocked replication forks recover, we used two-dimensional agarose gel electrophoresis to show that replication-blocking DNA lesions induce a transient reversal of the replication fork in vivo. The reversed replication fork intermediate is stabilized by RecA and RecF and is degraded by the RecQ-RecJ helicase-nuclease when these proteins are absent. We propose that fork regression allows repair enzymes to gain access to the replication-blocking lesion, allowing processive replication to resume once the blocking lesion is removed."

The auditory system defined in this way occupied large portions of cerebral tissue, an extent probably second only to that of the visual system. Cortically, the activated areas included the entire superior temporal gyrus and large portions of the parietal, prefrontal, and limbic lobes. Several auditory areas overlapped with previously identified visual areas, suggesting that the auditory system, like the visual system, contains separate pathways for processing stimulus quality, location, and motion."

However, the inability to see inside living insects has limited our understanding of their respiration mechanisms. We used a synchrotron beam to obtain x-ray videos of living, breathing insects. Beetles, crickets, and ants exhibited rapid cycles of tracheal compression and expansion in the head and thorax. Body movements and hemolymph circulation cannot account for these cycles; therefore, our observations demonstrate a previously unknown mechanism of respiration in insects analogous to the inflation and deflation of vertebrate lungs."

https://openalex.org/W2073909397,"A candidate tumor suppressor gene, p33ING1, was previously identified by using the genetic suppressor element methodology. p33ING1 cooperates with p53 and plays a significant role in p53-mediated cellular processes. Recently, we have identified p33ING2, which shows a sequence homology similar to p33ING1 and modulates p53 function. In the present study, we identified and characterized another 'ING family' gene. The estimated molecular weight of the encoded protein is 46.8 kDa, thus, we named it p47ING3. The p47ING3 gene is located at chromosome 7q31.3 and consists of 12 exons that encode 418 amino acids. A computational domain search revealed a C-terminal PHD-finger motif. Such motifs are common in proteins involved in chromatin remodeling. p47ING3 is highly expressed in some normal human tissues or organs, including the spleen, testis, skeletal muscle, and heart. p47ING3 expression levels varied among cancer cell lines. p47ING3 overexpression resulted in a decreased population of cells in S phase, a diminished colony-forming efficiency, and induced apoptosis in RKO cells, but not in RKO-E6 cells with inactivated p53. p47ING3 activates p53-transactivated promoters, including promoters of p21/waf1 and bax. Thus, we have isolated a novel ING family gene, p47ING3, which modulates p53-mediated transcription, cell cycle control, and apoptosis."

DLC-1 was found to be deleted or downregulated in a significant number of HCCs. We expanded our investigations to other cancers with recurrent deletions of 8p22, and in this study examined alterations of DLC-1 in primary human breast tumors, human breast, colon, and prostate tumor cell lines. Genomic deletion of DLC-1 was observed in 40% of primary breast tumors, whereas reduced or undetectable levels of DLC-1 mRNA were seen in 70% of breast, 70% of colon, and 50% of prostate tumor cell lines To see whether DLC-1 expression affects cell growth and tumorigenicity, two breast carcinoma cell lines lacking the expression of endogenous gene were transfected with the DLC-1 cDNA. In both cell lines, DLC-1 transfection caused significant growth inhibition and reduction of colony formation. Furthermore, introduction of the DLC-1 cDNA abolished the in vivo tumorigenicity in nude mice, suggesting that the DLC-1 gene plays a role in breast cancer by acting as a bona fide tumor suppressor gene."

By doubling the copy number of each gene, diploidy may increase the rate at which adaptive mutations are produced. However, models suggest that this does not necessarily accelerate adaptation by diploid populations. We tested model predictions regarding rates of adaptation using asexual yeast populations. Adaptive mutations were on average partially recessive. As predicted, diploidy slowed adaptation by large populations but not by small populations."

https://openalex.org/W2089227567,Hydrated minerals occur in accretionary rims around chondrules in CM chondrites. Previous models suggested that these phyllosilicates did not form by gas-solid reactions in the canonical solar nebula. We propose that chondrule-forming shock waves in icy regions of the nebula produced conditions that allowed rapid mineral hydration. The time scales for phyllosilicate formation are similar to the time it takes for a shocked system to cool from the temperature of phyllosilicate stability to that of water ice condensation. This scenario allows for simultaneous formation of chondrules and their fine-grained accretionary rims.
https://openalex.org/W2093497966,"Testicular germ cell tumours (TGCTs) are histologically heterogeneous neoplasms with variable malignant potential. Previously, we demonstrated frequent 3p allele loss in TGCTs, and recently we and others have shown that the 3p21.3 RASSF1A tumour suppressor gene (TSG) is frequently inactivated by promoter hypermethylation in a wide range of cancers including lung, breast, kidney and neuroblastoma. In order to investigate the role of epigenetic events in the pathogenesis of TGCTs, we analysed the promoter methylation status of RASSF1A and nine other genes that may be epigenetically inactivated in cancer (p16INK4A, APC, MGMT, GSTP1, DAPK, CDH1, CDH13, RARβ and FHIT) in 24 primary TGCTs (28 histologically distinct components). RASSF1A methylation was detected in four of 10 (40%) seminomas and 15 of 18 (83%) nonseminoma TGCT (NSTGCT) components (P=0.0346). None of the other nine candidate genes were methylated in seminomas, but MGMT (44%), APC (29%) and FHIT (29%) were frequently methylated in NSTGCTs. Furthermore, in two mixed germ cell tumours, the NSTGCT component for one demonstrated RASSF1A, APC and CDH13 promoter methylation, but the seminoma component was unmethylated for all genes analysed. In the second mixed germ cell tumour, the NSTGCT component was methylated for RASSF1A and MGMT, while the seminoma component was methylated only for RASSF1A. In all, 61% NSTGCT components but no seminoma samples demonstrated promoter methylation at two or more genes (P=0.0016). These findings are consistent with a multistep model for TGCT pathogenesis in which RASSF1A methylation occurs early in tumorigenesis and additional epigenetic events characterize progression from seminoma to NSTGCTs."

https://openalex.org/W2093833189,"Apaf-1 protein deficiency occurs in human leukaemic blasts and confers resistance to cytochrome-c-dependent apoptosis. Demethylation treatment with 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine (5aza2dc) increased the sensitivity of the K562 leukaemic cell line to UV light-induced apoptosis in association with increased Apaf-1 protein levels. There was no correlation between Apaf-1 protein expression and Apaf-1 mRNA levels after the demethylation treatment. Methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction was used to show that the methylation can occur within the Apaf-1 promoter region in leukaemic blasts. Apaf-1 DNA methylation was demonstrated in acute myeloid leukaemia, chronic myeloid leukaemia and acute lymphoid leukaemia, suggesting that it is not specific to a particular leukaemia subtype. Apaf-1 protein expression did not correlate with Apaf-1 mRNA levels in human leukaemic blasts. Some leukaemic cells expressed high levels of Apaf-1 mRNA but low levels of Apaf-1 protein. This study suggests that Apaf-1 DNA promoter methylation might contribute to the inactivation of Apaf-1 expression. However, Apaf-1 protein levels might also be controlled at post-transcription level."
https://openalex.org/W2038391869,"Many stimuli causing 'stress' or DNA damage in cells can produce phenotypes that overlap with telomere-based replicative senescence. In epithelial systems, the p16/RB pathway may function as a stress senescence-signaling pathway independent of telomere shortening. Overexpressing cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (Cdk4) in human epidermal keratinocytes and human mammary epithelial cells not only prevents the p16(INK4a)-associated premature growth arrest due to telomere-independent stress (e.g., inadequate culture conditions), but also bypasses the ensuing telomere-dependent senescence (M1). Overexpressed Cdk4 in epithelial cells induces a dramatic upregulation of p16(INK4a) and milder upregulation of p53 and p21(WAF1), which become unresponsive to UV irradiation. Despite the high levels of these checkpoint factors, Cdk4-overexpressing cells divide in an apparently normal regulated fashion, are able to respond to changes in calcium levels, retain the stem cell phenotype, and fully differentiate and stratify. These results suggest that the differentiation pathways in Cdk4-overexpressing cells remain intact."
https://openalex.org/W2040868671,"Reactivation of telomerase maintains telomere function and is considered critical to immortalization in most human cancer cells. Elevation of telomerase expression in cancer cells is highly specific: transcription of both RNA (hTR) and protein (hTERT) components is strongly upregulated in cancer cells relative to normal cells. Therefore, telomerase promoters may be useful in cancer gene therapy by selectively expressing suicide genes in cancer cells and not normal cells. One example of suicide gene therapy is the bacterial nitroreductase (NTR) gene, which bioactivates the prodrug CB1954 into an active cytotoxic alkylating agent. We describe construction of adenovirus vectors harbouring the bacterial NTR gene under control of the hTR or hTERT promoters. Western blot analysis of NTR expression in normal and cancer cells infected with adenoviral vectors showed cancer cell-specific nitroreductase expression. Infection with adenoviral telomerase-NTR constructs in a panel of seven cancer cell lines resulted in up to 18-fold sensitization to the prodrug CB1954, an effect that was retained in two drug-resistant ovarian lines. Importantly, no sensitization was observed with either promoter in any of the four normal cell strains. Finally, an efficacious effect was observed in cervical and ovarian xenograft models following single intratumoural injection with low doses of vector, followed by injection with CB1954."
https://openalex.org/W2022846164,"Neuroblastoma is a highly heterogeneous tumor of young children. Although many advances have been made towards understanding the molecular mechanisms dictating the phenotypic heterogeneity, the prognosis of children with neuroblastoma, particularly of progressively growing variants, has remained dire. About 10% of neuroblastomas regress spontaneously, probably by apoptosis, while another 20% have amplified the MYCN gene resulting in a poor prognosis. In pursuit of identifying cell death-associated genes in neuroblastoma, we encountered the SCA2 gene, coding for ataxin-2, as an important player. Here, we report that enforced expression of wild-type ataxin-2, but not of mutant ataxin-2, sensitizes neuroblastoma cells for apoptosis. In line with this, higher levels of ataxin-2 were detected in apoptotic cells compared to nonapoptotic cells. Neuroblastoma tumors with amplified MYCN contain significantly less ataxin-2 protein than tumors without amplified MYCN. Collectively, our data suggest that ataxin-2 has an important role in regulating the susceptibility of neuroblastoma cells to apoptotic stimuli in vitro and in vivo."

https://openalex.org/W2021057706,"Constitutive activation of the telomerase is a key step in the development of human cancers. Interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) signaling induces growth arrest in many tumors through multiple regulatory mechanisms. In this study, we show that IFN-gamma signaling represses telomerase activity and human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) transcription, and suggest that this signaling is mediated by IRF-1. Ectopic expression of IRF-1 attenuated hTERT promoter activity. Murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) genetically deficient in IRF-1 (IRF-1(-/-)) showed an elevated level (>15 times) of hTERT promoter activity as compared to the hTERT promoter activity of wild-type MEFs. The telomerase activity and hTERT expression in IRF-1(-/-) MEFs were downregulated by IRF-1 transfection. Interestingly, less extent of telomerase repression was observed in HPV E6 and E7 negative, p53 mutant HT-3 cells than in HPV 18 E6 and E7 positive HeLa cells (intact p53). These findings provide evidence that IRF-1 is a potential mediator of IFN-gamma-induced attenuation of telomerase activity and hTERT expression."
https://openalex.org/W2010529338,"RhoG, a member of the Rho family of GTPases, has been implicated as a regulator of the actin cytoskeleton. In this study, we show a novel function for the small GTPase RhoG on the regulation of the interferon-gamma promoter and nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) gene transcription in lymphocytes. Optimal function of RhoG for the expression of these genes requires a calcium signal, normally provided by the antigen receptor. In addition, RhoG potentiation of NFAT requires the indirect activity of Rac and Cdc42; however, pathways distinct from those activated by Rac and Cdc42 mediate RhoG activation of NFAT-dependent transcription. Using effector domain mutants of RhoG we found that its ability to potentiate NFAT-dependent transcription correlates with its capacity to increase actin polymerization, supporting the suggestion that NFAT-dependent transcription is an actin-dependent process. RhoG also promotes T-cell spreading on fibronectin, a property that is independent of its ability to enhance NFAT-dependent transcription. Hence, these results implicate RhoG in leukocyte trafficking and the control of gene expression induced in response to antigen encounter."
https://openalex.org/W2045859941,"The MYCN proto-oncogene is frequently amplified in a subgroup of highly aggressive neuroblastomas. The molecular mechanism(s) by which the overexpressed MYCN contributes to an aggressive tumor cell behavior is not well understood. Recently, it was reported that the ID2 gene is a direct target for the MYCN and MYC transcription factors, and that ID2 expression and MYCN amplification correlate positively in neuroblastoma. In addition, ID2 expression was proposed as a negative prognostic parameter. As these results are of potential clinical importance, but not in agreement with our own initial observations, the putative correlation between ID2 and MYC(N) expression in neuroblastoma cell lines and tumors was reinvestigated. We found no correlation between MYCN and ID2 expression in neuroblastoma cell lines or tumor specimens. However, we did find a significant positive correlation between MYC and ID2 expressions in both MYCN-amplified and single-copy tumor specimens, and in MYCN single-copy cell lines. As previously reported, we also found an inverse correlation between MYC and MYCN expressions. Importantly, we could not confirm the reported prognostic power of ID2-expression in neuroblastoma. These data, obtained in two independent laboratories, challenge the previously proposed ID2–MYCN relation."

Suppressor of tumorigenicity 7 (ST7) has been identified as a candidate tumor suppressor gene in this region. To identify whether 7q31 and genetic alterations of ST7 were involved in human esophageal carcinogenesis, we performed LOH mapping of a 5.4 cM region at 7q31-q35 in 43 primary esophageal carcinomas, as well as mutational analyses of the ST7 gene in tumors with LOH in this region. Of 43 tumors, 12 (28%) showed LOH at 7q31-q35. These included four (22%) of 18 squamous cell carcinomas and eight (32%) of 25 adenocarcinomas. The peak LOH locus was D7S480, lying 4.2 Mb telomeric to ST7 and showing LOH in eight of 37 informative tumors, or 22%. No mutations were found in the entire coding or flanking intronic regions of the ST7 gene among 12 tumors with 7q-LOH. In addition, quantitative RT-PCR analyses of ST7 mRNA expression levels in 11/13 normal-tumor pairs failed to show more than a 50% decrease in tumor ST7 mRNA relative to matched normal tissues. These data suggest that LOH at 7q31-q35 is involved in the origin or progression of at least a subset of esophageal carcinomas, but that ST7 is not the target gene of this somatic event."
https://openalex.org/W1990423351,"Ataxia telangiectasia (AT) is a human hereditary syndrome whose underlying gene product, ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) protein kinase, is involved in multiple intracellular signaling pathways. We demonstrated previously that AT fibroblasts are defective in intracellular Ca(2+) mobilization in response to both stress-inducing and mitogenic stimuli. To extend these findings, normal and AT cells were exposed to serum in the presence of different concentrations of extracellular Ca(2+) ([Ca(2+)](o)), and release of intracellular Ca(2+), activation of calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II and phosphorylation of kinases ERK1 and 2 were monitored. When maintained in high [Ca(2+)](o) (0.42 mM), normal fibroblasts responded to serum introduction more rapidly and efficiently than did AT cells. Unexpectedly, decreasing the [Ca(2+)](o) in the medium had a diametrically opposite effect. Under low [Ca(2+)](o) (0.0022 mM) conditions, normal cells were slow and inefficient in their responses, whereas AT cells showed a substantial improvement in all three end points. These findings demonstrate that loss of ATM kinase function deregulates the extracellular calcium-sensing receptor (CaR). This malfunction presumably arises from a post-transcriptional event, since CaR mRNA proved to be normal in AT cells. Together, our data suggest that ATM may mediate cell response to mitogenic factors by tightly regulating the set point of the CaR and thereby modulating the crosstalk between this metabotropic receptor and growth factor receptors. Alternatively, the faulty sensing of extracellular calcium in AT cells may be secondary to a state of chronic oxidative stress attributable to ATM deficiency."

For more than 50 years, platelet transfusions have prevented life-threatening blood loss in trauma, surgery, and bone marrow transplant patients. However, unlike red blood cells, which are amenable to cold storage, refrigerated platelets are cleared rapidly from the patient's circulation after transfusion. Unfortunately, the shelf life of platelets at room temperature is only 5 days, resulting in an acute shortage of platelets for transfusion. In a recent issue of Cell , Hoffmeister and colleagues ([1][1]) reveal why chilled, transfused platelets disappear rapidly from the circulation and propose a strategy to block this clearance. The rapid disappearance of chilled, transfused platelets has been attributed to the cold-induced loss of their normal discoid shape, presumably leading to the ensnaring of deformed platelets in capillaries. Not so, say Hoffmeister et al ., who show that even preserving the disc shape of chilled mouse platelets with drugs does not prevent their rapid clearance after transfusion into mice. The researchers next demonstrated that clearance of chilled platelets is due to their ingestion (phagocytosis) by liver macrophages called Kupffer cells. Phagocytosis of platelets depends on their binding to an integrin called CR3 on the Kupffer cell surface. When chilled mouse platelets are transfused into mice lacking CR3, they circulate with the same kinetics as transfused platelets kept at room temperature. Seeking the platelet counter-receptor that interacts with CR3, the researchers first investigated GP1ba, the platelet surface glycoprotein that binds to vWF. They found that enzymatically cleaving the extracellular portion of GP1ba from chilled mouse platelets boosted platelet survival after transfusion. Furthermore, in an in vitro assay, enzyme-treated chilled human platelets were not ingested by macrophages, implying that GP1ba is the platelet counter-receptor for CR3. Electron microscopy revealed that refrigeration induced the rearrangement of both mouse and human platelet GP1ba from neat, linear rows into clusters. This redistribution of GP1ba did not affect normal platelet behavior, because chilled platelets circulating in CR3-deficient mice were still able to bind to vWF, respond to thrombin and other mediators, and promote clot formation. If cold-induced platelet clearance could be blocked, then platelets could be stored in the cold and their shelf life dramatically extended. At a recent meeting, Hoffmeister and co-workers (

[2][2]) presented a strategy to attain this goal. By using galactose sugar residues to shield the sugar molecules on GP1ba that bind to CR3, they prevented the clearance of chilled, transfused mouse platelets. Chilled platelets with sugar-modified GP1ba circulated with a normal life-span in transfused mice and fulfilled their normal functions. The Hoffmeister et al . work is a big step toward making platelet refrigeration a reality and alleviating the acute shortage of platelets for transfusion. References
