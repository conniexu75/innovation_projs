https://openalex.org/W2120831645,"Topological Insulators Topological insulators are a recently discovered state of matter, in which the bulk is an insulator while the surface is metallic with counterpropagating spin states. The surface states are protected by the topology, or structure, of the Fermi surface in the bulk gap and are described by a Dirac cone showing linear dispersion behavior meeting at the Dirac point. Chen et al. (p. 178 , published online 11 June) provide a comprehensive photoemission study on Bi 2 Te 3 showing that it too falls into the category of topological band insulators. Moreover, there is just a single surface state with a single Dirac point in the photoemission spectrum. The identification of a material with a single Dirac point removes the ambiguity arising from multiple surface states and provides an ideal test-bed to probe the physics of these exotic new materials."

The properties of these structures are determined by the properties of individual nanocrystals and by their interactions. The insulating nature of organic ligands typically used in nanocrystal synthesis results in very poor interparticle coupling. We found that various molecular metal chalcogenide complexes can serve as convenient ligands for colloidal nanocrystals and nanowires. These ligands can be converted into semiconducting phases upon gentle heat treatment, generating inorganic nanocrystal solids. The utility of the inorganic ligands is demonstrated for model systems, including highly conductive arrays of gold nanocrystals capped with Sn2S6(4-) ions and field-effect transistors on cadmium selenide nanocrystals."

Because the LDLR plays a pivotal role in heart disease risk, there is substantial interest in understanding how its expression is regulated, and a large body of previous work has established the importance of transcriptional control. A new study identifies a signaling pathway that appears to regulate the LDLR at the level of protein degradation. Zelcer et al. (p. 100 , published online 11 June) show that a sterol-responsive transcription factor called LXR induces the expression of Idol (for inducible degrader of the LDLR), a protein that triggers ubiquitination of the receptor and targets it for degradation. Activation of this pathway suppresses cellular uptake of LDL and, in a mouse model, leads to higher plasma LDL levels, raising the possibility that the pathway could be targeted pharmacologically to control plasma cholesterol levels."

In plants, imprinting occurs in the endosperm, which nourishes the embryonic plant. Gehring et al. (p. 1447 ) and Hsieh et al. (p. 1451 ) analyzed the dynamics of DNA methylation in the endosperm and embryo of Arabidopsis and found extensive demethylation in the endosperm, suggesting that many imprinted genes are likely to exist. Gehring et al. characterized five imprinted genes in detail. Four of the 10 known imprinted genes are related homeodomain transcription factors. Furthermore, 5′ sequences demethylated in several of the genes were found to be derived from transposable elements, which supports the idea that imprinting arose as a by-product of silencing invading DNA."

https://openalex.org/W2067975393,"Ferroelectric Patterning with High Fields Ferroelectric oxides have a net polarization that can switch direction upon application of a sufficiently high electric field. In principle, a ferroelectric thin film should be able to act as a polar switch—tunneling an electron through the film would effectively switch on or off depending on the direction of the polarization. In practice, the length scale needed for a sufficiently small tunneling barrier is nearly the same as the scale at which films no longer support ferroelectricity. Maksymovych et al. (p. 1421 ) now show that the tip of an atomic force microscope can be used to pattern polarization domains in a thin film of lead zirconate titanate in high electric fields similar to those for field emission tips."
https://openalex.org/W2100333220,"Spotting Charges Many nanoscale physical systems are sensitive to the position of isolated charges, such as single-electron transistors and molecular assemblies that separate charges with energy from photons. In order to probe the location of a charged atom, the most general methods would work on insulating surfaces. Gross et al. (p. 1428 ; see the Perspective by Meyer and Glatzel ) show that a tuning-fork atomic force microscope (AFM) operating in a noncontact mode at cryogenic temperatures can resolve the charge state of gold and silver atoms absorbed on a sodium chloride film. Charged atoms set up image charges in the AFM tip, which creates an electrostatic force not present with a neutral atom."

However, little is known about the signaling mechanisms governing these proteins and the opposing consequences of autophagy in mammals. Here we report that a non-canonical MEK/ERK module, which is positioned downstream of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and upstream of tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC), regulates autophagy by regulating Beclin 1. Depletion of ERK partially inhibited autophagy, whereas specific inhibition on MEK completely inhibited autophagy. MEK could bypass ERK to promote autophagy. Basal MEK/ERK activity conferred basal Beclin 1 by preventing disassembly of mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) and mTORC2. Activation of MEK/ERK by AMPK upon autophagy stimuli disassembled mTORC1 via binding to and activating TSC but disassembled mTORC2 independently of TSC. Inhibition of mTORC1 or mTORC2 by transiently or moderately activated MEK/ERK caused moderately enhanced Beclin 1 resulting in cytoprotective autophagy, whereas inhibition of both mTORC1 and mTORC2 by sustained MEK/ERK activation caused strongly pronounced Beclin 1 leading to cytodestructive autophagy. Our findings thus propose that the AMPK-MEK/ERK-TSC-mTOR pathway regulation of Beclin 1 represents different thresholds responsible for a protective or destructive autophagy.

About 30 Atg proteins in yeast and 10 in mammals have been identified. In yeast, the protein kinase target of rapamycin (TOR) mediates autophagy via Atg1-Atg13 kinase complex. Atg1 interacts with multiple components of the autophagic machinery through direct association, phosphorylation, and/or intracellular localization (13Kamada Y. Funakoshi T. Shintani T. Nagano K.

Autophagy. 2005; 1: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). Because it is not known how the Atg1 homolog acts in mammals, a different mechanism may be involved in regulating autophagy. Beclin 1/Atg6, microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3)/Atg8, Atg5, Atg12, and Atg13 are essential for autophagosome formation in mammalian species (5Kuma A. Hatano M. Matsui M.

During the formation of autophagosomes in mammalian cells, LC3 is lipidated via a ubiquitylation-like system (17Kabeya Y. Mizushima N. Ueno T. Yamamoto A. Kirisako T. Noda T. Kominami E. Ohsumi Y.

Cell Biol. 2004; 36: 2503-2518Crossref PubMed Scopus (1043) Google Scholar), generating a soluble form, LC3-I. LC3-I is further modified to a membrane-bound form, LC3-II, which is subsequently localized to autophagosomes and autolysosomes until being degraded by the lysosome.Beclin 1 was initially isolated as a B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl2)-interacting tumor suppressor in mammalian cells (22Liang X.H. Kleeman L.K. Jiang H.H. Gordon G. Goldman J.E. Berry G. Herman B. Levine B. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 8586-8596Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Overexpression of Bcl2 attenuates the formation of the kinase complex Beclin 1-class III phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3KC3) essential for the formation of autophagosomes (23Pattingre S. Tassa A.

The UV radiation resistance-associated gene tumor suppressor and the activating molecule in Beclin 1-regulated autophagy protein 1 (Ambra 1) were identified as new Beclin 1-binding partners that also regulate autophagy by regulating the Beclin 1-PI3KC3 kinase complex. Association of Beclin 1 with PI3KC3 is negatively regulated by Bcl2 (22Liang X.H. Kleeman L.K. Jiang H.H. Gordon G. Goldman J.E. Berry G. Herman B. Levine B. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 8586-8596Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and positively regulated by UV radiation resistance-associated gene tumor suppressor and Ambra 1 (24Fimia G.M. Stoykova A. Romagnoli A.

Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 688-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (828) Google Scholar). Beclin 1 is homoallelically deleted in many human tumors. A decreased Beclin 1 level causes defective autophagy and breast cancer, but restoration of Beclin 1 induces autophagy and inhibits tumorigenicity of human breast cancer cells (18Liang X.H. Jackson S. Seaman M. Brown K. Kempkes B. Hibshoosh H. Levine B. Nature. 1999; 402: 672-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (2700) Google Scholar). These reports evidence the dependence on Beclin 1 for a functional autophagy mechanism.Diverse signaling pathways have been reported in the regulation of autophagy in mammalian cells (26Meijer A.J. Codogno P. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2004; 36: 2445-2462Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar, 27Shinojima N. Yokoyama T. Kondo Y. Kondo S. Autophagy. 2007; 3: 635-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). In contrast to yeast, mammalian cells regulate autophagy via both class I and class III PI3K. Class I PI3K plays an inhibitory role, whereas class III PI3K kinase complex, which includes Beclin 1, plays a stimulatory role in autophagy by promoting the nucleation of autophagic vesicles (28Kihara A. Noda T. Ishihara N. Ohsumi Y. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 519-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (797) Google Scholar, 29Petiot A. Ogier-Denis E. Blommaart E.F. Meijer A.J. Codogno P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 992-998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1029) Google Scholar). A recent study also indicates that hVps15 is required in regulation of class III PI3K in mammalian cells (30Yan Y. Flinn R.J. Wu H. Schnur R.S. Backer J.M. Biochem. J. 2009; 417: 747-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). However, the signaling mechanisms controlling autophagy-essential proteins, in particular Beclin 1, and the opposing consequences of autophagy remain to be resolved.Our present studies identified and positioned a non-canonical MEK/ERK pathway downstream of AMPK and upstream of TSC and mTOR. This MEK/ERK module regulated autophagy via regulating the Beclin 1 level through the AMPK-MEK/ERK-TSC-mTOR pathway. Moderately enhanced Beclin 1 by transient or moderate activation of MEK/ERK and subsequent inhibition on mTORC1 and mTORC2 individually caused protective autophagy. Strongly pronounced Beclin 1 by sustained or strong activation of MEK/ERK followed by dual inhibition on mTORC1 and mTORC2 caused destructive autophagy. Our results thus reveal interesting Beclin 1 thresholds in regulating autophagy.DISCUSSIONThe results presented here demonstrate that a non-canonical MEK/ERK module regulates autophagy by regulating Beclin 1 level through the AMPK-MEK/ERK-TSC-mTOR signaling pathway (Fig. 9). Basal MEK/ERK activity conferred constitutive Beclin 1 that was insufficient to trigger the autophagic response. MEK/ERK activation by AMPK upon various autophagy stimuli inactivated mTOR by disassembling the functional complexes mTORC1 and/or mTORC2, resulting in the up-regulation of Beclin 1 to different thresholds leading to autophagy of opposing consequences, suggesting that Beclin 1 may play a central role in integrating signals downstream of mTOR. Our studies thus provide the first mechanistic link between a signaling pathway and autophagy-essential proteins in the mammalian system.Mechanism of the Non-canonical MEK/ERK Module Regulating AutophagyERKs are a widely conserved family of serine/threonine protein kinases implicated in many cellular programs such as cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. ERK can be activated by a wide variety of oncogenes and extracellular stimuli including mitogens, growth factors, cytokines, and chemokines. An increasing number of studies have suggested that ERK plays a role in modulating autophagy (27Shinojima N. Yokoyama T. Kondo Y. Kondo S. Autophagy. 2007; 3: 635-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar, 43Aoki H. Takada Y. Kondo S. Sawaya R. Aggarwal B.B. Kondo Y. Mol.

Neuroscience. 2006; 138: 1055-1065Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). However, the role of ERK in autophagy was primarily concluded from the pharmacological blockage of autophagy by compound PD98059, an MEK-specific inhibitor. Because this chemical indirectly blocks ERK via inhibiting its canonical upstream regulator, MEK, it is not surprising that ERK was exclusively credited in regulating autophagy because ERK has been believed to be the only known substrate of MEK.We demonstrated in this study that basal MEK/ERK activity maintains the activity of mTORC1 and mTORC2 by protecting them from being disassembled (Fig. 6E, lower panel) and thus maintains a basal Beclin 1 level incapable of triggering autophagic response (Figs. 1E, 3C, and 6E, upper panel). Although we found that ERK is involved in the regulation of autophagy because constitutive expression of active ERK caused autophagy response (Figs. 1C and 7A) whereas specific inhibition on ERK by RNA interference (Fig. 2C) or dominant negative ERK (Fig. 2D) partially inhibited autophagy, knockdown of the canonical effectors ERK, p90RSK, and Elk by RNA interference did not cripple autophagic response (Fig. 2, A and B). This unusual observation suggests that ERK may use non-canonical downstream effectors in the context of autophagic signaling. Coincidentally MEK could bypass ERK (Fig. 2D) and interact with a downstream effector other than ERK in the context of autophagy stimuli (Figs. 4D and 5B), indicating that ERK is not the sole downstream effector of MEK and that MEK plays a more important role than ERK in regulating autophagy. Interestingly MEK regulates Golgi fragmentation in mitosis independently of ERK1/2 (58Colanzi A. Deerinck T.J. Ellisman M.H. Malhotra V. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 331-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 59Colanzi A. Suetterlin C. Malhotra V. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2003; 15: 462-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), and the nucleation of autophagy by Beclin 1-PI3KC3 kinase complex is executed at the trans-Golgi network in mammalian cells (60Kihara A. Kabeya Y. Ohsumi Y. Yoshimori T. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 330-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar), both of which support the unusual role and the non-canonical module of MEK/ERK in regulating Beclin 1 and autophagy.Recent studies show that ERK up-regulates starvation-caused autophagy by down-regulating Akt/mTOR/S6K (27Shinojima N. Yokoyama T. Kondo Y. Kondo S. Autophagy. 2007; 3: 635-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar), but the molecular link between this pathway and the basis of autophagy machinery remains largely unclear. We observed here that activation of MEK/ERK coincided with up-regulation of Beclin 1 and autophagic responses, and MEK/ERK was activated by AMPK but not Raf1 in response to autophagy stimuli. AMPK has been proposed as a physiological cellular energy sensor because AMP is the most sensitive indicator for a cellular energy status. The cellular ATP concentration is much higher than that of AMP, and an insignificant decrease in ATP levels can result in an extraordinary increase in AMP levels that are sensed by and stimulate AMPK (24Fimia G.M. Stoykova A. Romagnoli A. Giunta L. Di Bartolomeo S. Nardacci R. Corazzari M. Fuoco C. Ucar A. Schwartz P. Gruss P. Piacentini M. Chowdhury K. Cecconi F. Nature. 2007; 447: 1121-1125Crossref PubMed Scopus (773) Google Scholar). MEK/ERK activation by AMPK thus confers the sensitivity and accuracy of MEK/ERK in regulating autophagic activity. TSC is known to be regulated by cellular energy levels. Activation of AMPK by energy starvation results in direct phosphorylation of TSC (49Inoki K. Li Y. Zhu T. Wu J. Guan K.L. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 648-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (2365) Google Scholar). Our study showed that AMPK activation of TSC depends on MEK/ERK. Furthermore, activated MEK interacted with TSC, and the physical interaction between activated MEK and TSC required the ERK D docking site sequence motif contained in both MEK and TSC, consistent with the notion that stable binding of substrates to mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) kinase involves recognition of a docking site on the substrate (2Longo V.D. Finch C.E. Science. 2003; 299: 1342-1346Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar). This non-canonical MEK/ERK signaling pathway functions not only in human and rat cell lines but also in neonatal mice, indicating a physiological significance. Our findings thus position this unusual MEK/ERK module downstream of AMPK and upstream of TSC in response to autophagy stimuli.Our present study showed that mTOR regulates autophagy caused both by starvation and non-starvation stimuli that activate MEK/ERK, consistent with the report that AMPK regulates autophagy through mTOR also in non-starved conditions (61Høyer-Hansen M. Jäättelä M. Autophagy. 2007; 3: 381-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar), suggesting a possible universal mechanism in the regulation of autophagy through mTOR. Because constitutive expression of Beclin 1 is due to the basal activity of MEK/ERK and enhanced Beclin 1 is attributed to the enhanced MEK/ERK activation in both human and rat cells, we postulate that the dependence of Beclin 1 on MEK/ERK signals may also be a universal mechanism in regulating autophagy.Beclin 1 Plays a Central Role in the Mechanisms Determining a Protective or Destructive AutophagyOur previous study shows that autophagic activity depends on the Beclin 1 level (41Wang J. Autophagy. 2008; 4: 947-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The present study found that the non-canonical MEK/ERK module regulates mutually antagonistic processes by regulating Beclin 1 levels. Basal activity of MEK/ERK protected mTORC1 and mTORC2 from being disassembled, thus conferring the basal mTOR activity and basal Beclin 1 level, which are incapable of triggering autophagy. MEK/ERK activation by AMPK up-regulated Beclin 1 through down-regulation of mTOR activity. Transient or moderate activation of MEK/ERK caused inhibition of mTORC1 or mTORC2, resulting in a moderate Beclin 1 increase and an ultimate cytoprotective autophagy, but sustained or strong MEK/ERK activation completely inhibited both mTORC1 and mTORC2, resulting in a strongly pronounced Beclin 1 and an ultimate cytodestructive autophagy. The requirement of an enhanced Beclin 1 level by MEK/ERK activation for autophagy thus appears to represent interesting threshold effects. The degree of enhanced Beclin 1 level may determine the level of autophagic activity, and the degree of autophagy elicited may play a role in cell fate decisions with low levels serving a homeostatic role and high levels promoting cell death. Our findings thus establish the molecular connection between MEK/ERK and mTOR in the regulation of mammalian autophagy-essential proteins and the opposing consequences of autophagy.Mammalian cells undergo autophagy resulting from exposure to nutritional, chemical, or physical autophagy stimuli or extreme physiological conditions such as birth. Despite the ubiquitous and constitutive expression of Beclin 1 in mammalian cells, our data demonstrate that autophagy is not evident until Beclin 1 is elevated, and autophagic activity is not detectable at a constitutive Beclin 1 level under normal growth conditions in cancer cells. In the brain, autophagic activity is very low even under starvation conditions (20Mizushima N. Yamamoto A. Matsui M. Yoshimori T. Ohsumi Y. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 1101-1111Crossref PubMed Scopus (1892) Google Scholar). These data suggest that either there is no constitutive autophagy or autophagy can only occur at extremely low levels under normal growth conditions when Beclin 1 is maintained at a basal level. Therefore, we doubt that autophagy plays a housekeeping role in all types of mammalian cells. Constitutive or basal Beclin 1 may be implicated in other cellular processes. Our recent studies show that constitutive Beclin 1 inhibits activation of apoptosis and confers differentiation capability in leukemia HL-60 cells (37Wang J. Lian H. Zhao Y. Kauss M.A. Spindel S. J.

Thus, our present study adds new understanding of Beclin 1 in the regulation of autophagy.

In order to identify genes that regulate innate immunity, Cronin et al. (p. 340 ; published online 11 June) performed an RNA interference screen on flies infected with the oral bacterial pathogen, Serratia marcescens . Genes involved in intestinal immunity and regulation of hemocytes, macrophage-like cells critical for phagocytosis and killing of the bacteria, were identified. Several hundred genes conferred either enhanced susceptibility or resistance to bacterial infection. Furthermore, the JAK/STAT signaling pathway was activated in intestinal stem cells after bacterial infection, resulting in enhanced susceptibility to infection, most likely through regulation of intestinal stem cell homeostasis."

https://openalex.org/W1999716006,"Asthma is a common disease characterised by reversible airflow obstruction, bronchial hyperresponsiveness and chronic inflammation, which is commonly treated using corticosteroids such as budesonide. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a recently identified family of non-protein encoding genes that regulate protein translation by a mechanism entitled RNA interference. Previous studies have shown lung-specific miRNA expression profiles, although their importance in regulating gene expression is unresolved. We determined whether miRNA expression was differentially expressed in mild asthma and the effect of corticosteroid treatment.We have examined changes in miRNA using a highly sensitive RT-PCR based approach to measure the expression of 227 miRNAs in airway biopsies obtained from normal and mild asthmatic patients. We have also determined whether the anti-inflammatory action of corticosteroids are mediated through miRNAs by determining the profile of miRNA expression in mild asthmatics, before and following 1 month twice daily treatment with inhaled budesonide. Furthermore, we have analysed the expression of miRNAs from individual cell populations from the airway and lung. We found no significant difference in the expression of 227 miRNAs in the airway biopsies obtained from normal and mild asthmatic patients. In addition, despite improved lung function, we found no significant difference in the miRNA expression following one month treatment with the corticosteroid, budesonide. However, analysis of bronchial and alveolar epithelial cells, airway smooth muscle cells, alveolar macrophages and lung fibroblasts demonstrate a miRNA expression profile that is specific to individual cell types and demonstrates the complex cellular heterogeneity within whole tissue samples.Changes in miRNA expression do not appear to be involved in the development of a mild asthmatic phenotype or in the anti-inflammatory action of the corticosteroid budesonide."

We report variations in delta18Oatm over the past 60,000 years related to Heinrich and Dansgaard-Oeschger events, two modes of abrupt climate change observed during the last ice age. Correlations with cave records support the hypothesis that the Dole effect is primarily governed by the strength of the Asian and North African monsoons and confirm that widespread changes in low-latitude terrestrial rainfall accompanied abrupt climate change. The rapid delta18Oatm changes can also be used to synchronize ice records by providing global time markers."
https://openalex.org/W2023133235,"A uniquely sensitive method for ceramide domain detection allowed us to study in detail cholesterol-ceramide interactions in lipid bilayers with low (physiological) ceramide concentrations, ranging from low or no cholesterol (a situation similar to intracellular membranes, such as endoplasmic reticulum) to high cholesterol (similar to mammalian plasma membrane). Diverse fluorescence spectroscopy and microscopy experiments were conducted showing that for low cholesterol amounts ceramide segregates into gel domains that disappear upon increasing cholesterol levels. This was observed in different raft (sphingomyelin/cholesterol-containing) and non-raft (sphingomyelin-absent) membranes, i.e. mimicking different types of cell membranes. Cholesterol-ceramide interactions have been described mainly as raft sphingomyelin-dependent. Here sphingomyelin independence is demonstrated. In addition, ceramide-rich domains re-appear when either cholesterol is converted by cholesterol oxidase to cholestenone or the temperature is decreased. Ceramide is more soluble in cholesterol-rich fluid membranes than in cholesterol-poor ones, thereby increasing the chemical potential of cholesterol. Ceramide solubility depends on the average gel-fluid transition temperature of the remaining membrane lipids. The inability of cholestenone-rich membranes to dissolve ceramide gel domains shows that the cholesterol ordering and packing properties are fundamental to the mixing process. We also show that the solubility of cholesterol in ceramide domains is low. The results are rationalized by a ternary phospholipid/ceramide/cholesterol phase diagram, providing the framework for the better understanding of biochemical phenomena modulated by cholesterol-ceramide interactions such as cholesterol oxidase activity, lipoprotein metabolism, and lipid targeting in cancer therapy. It also suggests that the lipid compositions of different organelles are such that ceramide gel domains are not formed unless a stress or pathological situation occurs."

Zn K-edge extended x-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy and modeling studies show that the major Zn(2+) site on albumin is a 5-coordinate site with average Zn-O/N distances of 1.98 A and a weak sixth O/N bond of 2.48 A, consistent with coordination to His(67) and Asn(99) from domain I, His(247) and Asp(249) from domain II (residues conserved in all sequenced mammalian albumins), plus a water ligand. The dynamics of the domain I/II interface, thought to be important to biological function, are affected by Zn(2+) binding, which induces cooperative allosteric effects related to those of the pH-dependent neutral-to-base transition. N99D and N99H mutations enhance Zn(2+) binding but alter protein stability, whereas mutation of His(67) to alanine removes an interdomain H-bond and weakens Zn(2+) binding.

Many of these modifications are buried within the nucleosome core and thus are not readily accessible for protein binding. Fifteen of these histone PTMs are located in the DNA-histone interface, where the histone octamer contacts the phosphate backbone of the wrapped DNA (14.Cosgrove M.S. Boeke J.D. Wolberger C. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 1037-1043Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Studies have suggested that only mild structural perturbations occur in core-modified nucleosomes, which implies that modifications buried beneath the DNA are unlikely to provide a protein-binding site (15.Muthurajan U.M. Bao Y. Forsberg L.J. Edayathumangalam R.S. Dyer P.N. White C.L. Luger K. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 260-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). This has led to two additional models for the function of nucleosome core PTMs. Modifications such as Lys acetylation that reduce the positive charge of the histone octamer surface may reduce the binding affinity of histone-DNA interactions. In a “regulated nucleosome mobility model,” these modifications would lead to increased mobility or “sliding” of nucleosomes between different positioning sites on DNA, often with the assistance of chromatin remodeling factors (14.Cosgrove M.S. Boeke J.D. Wolberger C. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 1037-1043Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). DNA regulatory sites might be significantly more exposed as a result of such nucleosome movement (16.Becker P.B. Hörz W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 247-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar). SIN (SWI/SNF-independent) histone mutations that are located in the nucleosome dyad appear to increase the rate of nucleosome repositioning following thermal heating (15.Muthurajan U.M. Bao Y.

Biol. 1997; 17: 6953-6969Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Alternatively, Widom and co-workers (19.Anderson J.D. Widom J. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 296: 979-987Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 20.Li G. Widom J. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 763-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar, 21.Polach K.J. Widom J. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 254: 130-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that even a structured nucleosome undergoes fluctuations that render the nucleosome accessible via transient DNA unwrapping. In a “site accessibility model,” side chain modifications that reduce the binding interactions between the histone octamer surface and DNA might modify the dynamics of the nucleosome structure and alter the proportion of DNA that is transiently unwrapped and accessible to regulatory factors. Here we have tested aspects of these two models by examining Lys acetylation near the dyad symmetry axis of the nucleosome. The dyad represents a nexus of several interactions that include essential protein-protein contacts at the H3/H4 tetramer interface and histone-DNA contacts at the center of the positioned DNA sequence. The H3-K115 and H3-K122 residues are positioned between two histone DNA-binding motifs at the nucleosome dyad (Fig. 1). The side chain amines of these Lys residues are poised for electrostatic interactions with the DNA backbone. Because of inherent nucleosome symmetry, two copies of each amino acid exist in close spatial proximity; simultaneous modifications at these Lys residues would therefore create a patch of four histone modifications that could alter a large surface area in the assembled nucleosome (22.Luger K. Mäder A.W. Richmond R.K. Sargent D.F. Richmond T.J. Nature. 1997; 389: 251-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (6929) Google Scholar). Replacing H3-K115Q and H3-K122Q in yeast reduces transcriptional silencing at ribosomal DNA and telomeres (23.Hyland E.M. Cosgrove M.S. Molina H. Wang D. Pandey A. Cottee R.J. Boeke J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 10060-10070Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). H3-K115R, which mimics constitutively unacetylated lysine, exhibits wild type silencing in both regions. However, H3-K122R exhibits wild type silencing in ribosomal DNA but reduced silencing in telomeres (23.Hyland E.M. Cosgrove M.S. Molina H. Wang D. Pandey A. Cottee R.J. Boeke J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 10060-10070Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Another study showed that H3-K115A and H3-K122A separately displayed reduced expression of the PHO5 gene in budding yeast, whereas H3-K122A exhibited wild type expression (24.English C.M. Adkins M.W. Carson J.J. Churchill M.E. Tyler J.K. Cell. 2006; 127: 495-508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). DNA repair also appears dependent on H3-K115 and/or H3-K122 acetylation. H3-K115Q increases sensitivity to hydroxyurea, whereas H3-K115R does not (23.Hyland E.M. Cosgrove M.S. Molina H. Wang D. Pandey A. Cottee R.J. Boeke J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 10060-10070Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Moreover, H3-K115A, H3-K122A, and H3-K122Q were all shown to be highly sensitive to Zeocin, a DNA double strand break mimetic (24.English C.M. Adkins M.W. Carson J.J. Churchill M.E. Tyler J.K. Cell. 2006; 127: 495-508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). Whether the Lys → Gln mutations capture the entire features of Lys acetylation is a significant unknown. To examine the precise role of Lys acetylation at the nucleosome dyad, we generated nucleosomes bearing acetylated Lys on histone H3-K115 and/or H3-K122 by expressed protein ligation (25.He S. Bauman D. Davis J.S. Loyola A. Nishioka K. Gronlund J.L. Reinberg D. Meng F. Kelleher N. McCafferty D.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 12033-12038Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 26.Shogren-Knaak M.A. Peterson C.L. Methods Enzymol. 2004; 375: 62-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 27.McGinty R.K. Kim J. Chatterjee C. Roeder R.G. Muir T.W. Nature. 2008; 453: 812-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). We found that the nucleosome position was not altered by H3-K115 and/or H3-K122 acetylation. However, competitive reconstitution analysis suggests that these H3 modifications reduced the free energy of binding between the histone octamer and a well defined nucleosome positioning DNA sequence. Restriction enzyme kinetic studies suggest that dynamic DNA site accessibility was not altered by the Lys modifications. However, the H3-K122Ac and H3-K115Ac/K122Ac nucleosomes demonstrated increased mobility in thermal repositioning studies. Remarkably, Lys → Gln substitution of these residues does not alter DNA-histone binding, suggesting that glutamine does not capture all the essential features of Lys-115 and Lys-122 acetylation. Our results are consistent with the conclusion that modifications of the nucleosome dyad alter nucleosome mobility and appear to support the regulated nucleosome mobility model. Peptides were synthesized manually on t-butoxycarbonyl-Ala-PAM resin (Novabiochem) using standard t-butoxycarbonyl-Nα protection strategies and HBTU activation protocols. Selective Lys acetylation was accomplished by incorporation of Lys with orthogonal N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl side chain protection at the appropriate positions; prior to cleavage from the resin, the side chain amine was revealed by treatment with 1:4 piperidine:N,N-dimethylformamide, and the side chain amine was acetylated with 1.5:1.5:7 acetic anhydride:diisopropylethylamine:N,N-dimethylformamide. Peptides were cleaved from the resin with standard HF cleavage procedures using p-cresol as a scavenger and purified by RP-HPLC on Vydac C-18 columns. Peptide purity was assessed as ≥95% using analytical RP-HPLC, and peptide identity was confirmed with MALDI-TOF-MS as follows: H3Pep-K115Ac, CAIHAK(Ac)RVTIMPKDIQLARRIRGERA (61 mg; m/z 3045.6 M + H, expected 3045.6 M + H); H3Pep-K122Ac, CAIHAKRVTIMPK(Ac)DIQLARRIRGERA (137 mg; m/z 3045.7 M + H, expected 3045.6 M + H); H3Pep-DualMod, CAIHAK(Ac)RVTIMPK(Ac)DIQLARRIRGERA (117 mg; m/z 3087.7 M + H, expected 3087.7 M + H). Plasmids encoding histones H2A, H2B, H3, and H4 were the generous contributions of Dr. Karolin Luger (Colorado State University) and Dr. Jonathan Widom (Northwestern University). Mutations K115Q, K122Q, and K115Q/K122Q were introduced into histone H3 by site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene). The expression and purification of wild type histones and mutant histones, H3-K115Q, H3-K122Q, and H3-K115Q/K122Q, were performed according to published protocols (28.Luger K. Rechsteiner T.J. Richmond T.J. Methods Mol. Biol. 1999; 119: 1-16PubMed Google Scholar). Truncated histone H3 (residues 1–109) was cloned as a fusion protein with the GyrA intein and a chitin binding domain into the pTXB1 vector (New England Biolabs). The protein was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) cells and purified from inclusion bodies (see supplemental material), and the purified protein was refolded by dialysis into a high salt buffer. Thiolysis was initiated by addition of 100 mm MESNA and allowed to continue for 24 h at 4 °C (Fig. 2B). Buffer components were adjusted to generate ligation buffer (50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 6 m urea, 1 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 50 mm MESNA), and the protein was concentrated to >1 mg/ml of the thioester and stored at −80 °C. Residual full-length H3-(1–109)-intein and cleaved intein remain in the sample through the ligation reaction; UV spectroscopy was used to determine total protein concentration, and thioester concentration was determined by characterization of cleavage yield by SDS-PAGE. Ten molar equivalents of the appropriate peptide were added to the concentrated protein thioester solution in ligation buffer (6 m urea, 1 m NaCl, 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 1 mm EDTA, 20 mm tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine) and ligation proceeded overnight at room temperature with gentle agitation (Fig. 2B). The ligation mixture was dialyzed into water and lyophilized. The dry powder was resuspended in TrisU-100 (10 mm Tris (pH 9.0), 7 m urea, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 100 mm NaCl) and purified by HPLC ion exchange chromatography (supplemental Fig. 1A) over a TSKgel SP-5PW column (TOSOH Bioscience). Full-length semisynthetic H3 and truncated H3-(1–109) could not be fully separated by this method; all fractions containing full-length H3 were combined, dialyzed extensively against water with 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and stored as the lyophilized powder at −80 °C. Protein yields were determined by UV spectroscopy, and proteins were isolated in up to a 7-mg yield of a 50:50 mixture of H3-K115Ac, K122Ac:H3-(1–109). The mp2-192 and mp2-247 DNA molecules were prepared by PCR from the plasmid pMP2 (29.Poirier M.G. Bussiek M. Langowski J. Widom J. J. Mol. Biol. 2008; 379: 772-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Each oligonucleotide (Sigma) was labeled with a Cy3 or Cy5 NHS ester (GE Healthcare) at an amino group attached to the 5′ end and then purified by RP-HPLC with a 218PTM C18 (Grace/Vydac) column. The Cy5-labeled oligonucleotides used to amplify mp2-192 were as follows: Cy5-AGTGAATTCCGGTTGACGAGGTGCG and Cy5-GCTCGGTCCGACAGGATGTA. The Cy3- or Cy5-labeled oligonucleotides used to amplify mp2-247 were as follows: Cy3-TGTAAAACGACGGCCAGTGAATTCCGGTTG and Cy5-AAGCTTGCATGCAGATCTATGTCGGGCT. Following PCR amplification, each DNA molecule was purified by HPLC with a Gen-Pak Fax column (Waters). The unlabeled mp2-192 and mp2-247 DNA molecules were prepared by PCR with the same unlabeled oligonucleotides and then purified by RP-HPLC. 168-bp competitor DNA was prepared by PCR from pUC19 with oligonucleotides ACGTTGTTGCCATTGCTACAGGC and AACTTACTTCTGACAACGATCGGAGGAC and then purified by RP-HPLC. The histone octamer refolding and purification procedure was modified from previously described methods (28.Luger K. Rechsteiner T.J. Richmond T.J. Methods Mol. Biol. 1999; 119: 1-16PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, each histone was unfolded for 1–3 h in unfolding buffer, 7 m guanidine, 20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), and 10 mm dithiothreitol, at a histone concentration of 2–20 mg/ml and then spun to remove aggregates. The absorption at 276 nm was measured for each unfolded histone to determine the concentration. The four core histones were combined at equal molar ratio with total histone concentration adjusted to 5 mg/ml in 200 μl. The octamer was refolded by double dialysis in refolding buffer: 2 m NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mm EDTA, and 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol. The recovered refolded octamer was centrifuged to remove large aggregates and then purified over a Superdex 200 (GE Healthcare) column to remove any H3/H4 tetramer (often containing truncated H3-(1–109)) or protein dimers. The purity of each octamer was confirmed by SDS-PAGE (supplemental Fig. 1B) and mass spectrometry (Fig. 2, C and D). Nucleosomes for restriction enzyme analysis, thermal shifting, and exonuclease III mapping were reconstituted by salt double dialysis (30.Thåström A. Lowary P.T. Widom J. Methods. 2004; 33: 33-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) with 0.5 μg of Cy3- and Cy5-labeled mp2-192 or mp2-247 DNA (Fig. 3A), 4.5 μg of competitor DNA, and 4 μg of purified HO that contained 0, 1, or 2 modifications or mutations. The DNA and HO were mixed in 50 μl of 0.5× TE (pH 8.0) with 2 m NaCl and 1 mm BZA. The sample was loaded into an engineered 50-μl dialysis chamber that was placed in a large dialysis tube with 80 ml of 0.5× TE (pH 8.0) with 2 m NaCl and 1 mm BZA. The large dialysis tube was extensively dialyzed against 0.5× TE with 1 mm BZA. The 50-μl sample was extracted from the dialysis button and purified by sucrose gradient centrifugation (Fig. 3D). Competitive reconstitutions were modified from published protocols to measure the change in DNA-histone binding induced by K115Ac and/or K122Ac (30.Thåström A. Lowary P.T. Widom J. Methods. 2004; 33: 33-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 31.Thåström A. Bingham L.M. Widom J. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 338: 695-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) (see supplemental material). Reconstitutions were prepared in 2 m NaCl, 0.5× TE, 1 mm BZA with 1 ng/μl labeled MP2 DNA, 9 ng/μl unlabeled MP2 DNA, 40 ng/μl buffer DNA, and 8 ng/μl of HO (either unmodified, modified or mutated) in a volume of 40 μl. To minimize variation in DNA and HO concentrations, we first prepared a master mix that was combined with each HO stock, diluted to a concentration of 96 ng/μl in 2 m NaCl, 0.5× TE, and 1 mm BZA. Each HO sample was then split into thirds and dialyzed separately. Each sample was dialyzed against the same reservoir containing 1.5 liters of 2 m NaCl, 0.5× TE, and 1 mm BZA. The concentration of salt in the dialysis reservoir was slowly reduced to 200 mm over 24 h; the samples were then dialyzed overnight against 0.5× TE and 1 mm BZA to reduce the final NaCl concentration to <1 mm NaCl. The reconstitution products were examined by PAGE, scanned with a Typhoon 8600 variable mode imager (GE Healthcare), and analyzed with ImageQuant (GE Healthcare). The restriction enzyme kinetics method (21.Polach K.J. Widom J. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 254: 130-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar) was used to determine the nucleosomal DNA accessibility, which is defined as the equilibrium constant for site exposure, Keq = k12/k21, at the following five separate restriction enzyme sites: HindIII, HaeIII, TaqαI, HhaI, and PmlI (Fig. 5) (see supplemental material). The reactions were initiated by mixing 50 μl of 2× restriction enzyme (New England Biolabs) and 50 μl of 2 nm nucleosomes. TaqαI digestion was carried out at 65, 47, and 37 °C, and all three temperatures resulted in the same relative equilibrium constant for site exposure; all other reactions were carried out at 37 °C. Time points at 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 24, and 32 min were acquired by quenching 10 μl of the reaction with EDTA at a final concentration of 20 mm. Proteinase K (1 mg/ml final concentration) and SDS (0.02% final concentration) were added to each time point to remove the histone octamer from the DNA. Each time point was examined by native 5% PAGE (Fig. 5, A and B). The DNA was visualized with a Typhoon 8600 variable mode imager (GE Healthcare) and quantified by ImageQuant. The digestions were fit to a single exponential to determine the initial digestion rate. An initial drop in undigested DNA between the 0 and 1-min time point is because of a small fraction of nucleosomes that dissociate during the rapid mixing. We therefore neglect this initial time point as has been done in previous studies (21.Polach K.J. Widom J. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 254: 130-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar, 29.Poirier M.G. Bussiek M. Langowski J. Widom J. J. Mol. Biol. 2008; 379: 772-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Nucleosomes were thermally repositioned within the DNA substrate exactly as described previously (17.Flaus A. Rencurel C. Ferreira H. Wiechens N. Owen-Hughes T. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 343-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Sucrose gradient purified nucleosomes reconstituted with mp2-247 were diluted to a concentration of 200 nm in 50 mm Tris (pH 7.5). The nucleosomes were heated in a thermal cycler (Eppendorf) to 47, 50, 53, 59, or 65 °C. Nucleosome shifting occurred above 50 °C and dissociated above 59 °C before significant thermal shifting occurred. At 53 °C ∼20% of the nucleosome shifted position although very little dissociated. Thermal shifting experiments were performed at 53 °C for 1, 2.5, 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, 45, and 60 min, and the reaction was stopped by transferring 10 μl of the heated nucleosomes to an ice water bath. Samples were analyzed by 5% PAGE in 0.2× TBE (Fig. 6, A and B). The gel was pre-run at 4 °C for 3 h before running the samples for 60 min at 30 V/cm at 4 °C with continuous recirculation of the running buffer. Following electrophoresis, the gels were imaged with a Typhoon 8600 variable mode imager (GE Healthcare) and quantified by ImageQuant. The nucleosome positions within the mp2-247 DNA molecule were determined with ExoIII mapping. Reactions were carried out in an initial volume of 100 μl with 20 nm nucleosomes with 30 and 100 units of ExoIII (New England Biolabs) in Buffer 1 (New England Biolabs). At each time point, a 10-μl aliquot of the reaction was quenched with EDTA to a final concentration of 20 mm EDTA. A final concentration of 1 mg/ml of proteinase K and 0.02% of SDS was added to each time point to remove the histone octamer from the DNA, and samples were separated by 8% denaturing PAGE in 7 m urea and 1× TBE. The sequence markers were prepared with a SequiTherm Excel II DNA sequencing kit (Epicenter) using Cy3- or Cy5-labeled primers, an mp2-247 DNA template, and either dATP or dTTP. Results were imaged by a Typhoon 8600 variable mode imager (GE Healthcare), which detects Cy3 and Cy5 separately in the same gel (Fig. 7). The Cy3 and Cy5 ladders could be loaded in the same lanes to increase accuracy of the mapping gel readout. In parallel we carried out ExoIII digestions with naked DNA to confirm that none of the positions observed with nucleosomal DNA were because of exonuclease pause sites (data not shown). EPL is the chemoselective reaction between a polypeptide with an N-terminal Cys residue and a polypeptide with a C-terminal thioester moiety that generates a native polypeptide backbone with the Cys remaining at the ligation site (32.Ottesen J.J. Bar-Dagan M. Giovani B. Muir T.W. Biopolymers. 2008; 90: 406-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 33.Muir T.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2003; 72: 249-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar). The H3-K115 and H3-K122 acetylation sites are located at the nucleosome dyad and H3-H4 tetramer interface near the C terminus of histone H3 (Fig. 1). These sites are C-terminal to a natural Cys residue at position 110 that serves as an ideal ligation site for the introduction of synthetic peptides to generate a native H3 protein sequence after ligation (Fig. 2A). The H3-K115Ac and H3-K122Ac modifications were introduced via a synthetically accessible 26-residue peptide encompassing H3 residues 110–135. Peptides corresponding to each of the acetylation variants were synthesized and purified: H3Pep-K115Ac, H3Pep-K122Ac, and the dual-modified H3Pep-K115Ac/K122Ac. The H3-(1–109)-intein fusion protein accumulated in inclusion bodies, as is typical for bacterially overexpressed histone proteins. The H3 fusion expression pattern is in contrast to a histone H2A-intein fusion protein, which has been reported to express as a soluble, well folded protein (27.McGinty R.K. Kim J. Chatterjee C. Roeder R.G. Muir T.W. Nature. 2008; 453: 812-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). Because a structured intein is required for the thiolysis reaction that generates the H3 thioester, we developed an intein refolding procedure in high salt conditions that maintains solubility of the H3 extein. Although we observed cleavage yields up to 90%, a typical intein thiolysis reaction proceeds to ∼50% (Fig. 2B). We found that greater yields were obtained by simply denaturing and concentrating the cleavage mixture compared with thioester purification. Combining a 10-fold molar excess of the appropriate synthetic H3-(110–135) peptide with the concentrated cleavage mixture generated the full-length semisynthetic H3 histone (Fig. 2B). The full-length H3 protein and H3-(1–109) may be co-purified using ion exchange chromatography (supplemental Fig. 1A). However, H3-(1–109) lacks a C-terminal α-helix that forms an essential protein-protein interface in the H3/H4 tetramer. When histone octamer is refolded from equimolar amounts of H2A, H2B, H3/H3-(1–109), and H4, only the full-length H3 is incorporated into the octamer, and the efficiency of refolding appears solely dependent on the full-length component of the H3 mixture. Histone octamer was refolded using the wild type unmodified H3, the three Gln mimic proteins, and three semisynthetic acetylated H3 variants. Both SDS-PAGE (supplemental Fig. 1B) and MALDI-MS analysis (Fig. 2, C and D) demonstrate that the H3-(1–109) fragment is completely eliminated from the histone octamer in each of the semisynthetic preparations and that the acetylation modifications survive purification. Interestingly, the fact that we efficiently refolded and purified histone octamer with either or both modifications suggests that H3-K115Ac and H3-K122Ac do not inhibit the formation of histone octamer. We reconstituted nucleosomes with histone octamer containing H3-K115Ac and/or H3-K122Ac and DNA containing the high affinity nucleosome positioning sequence mp2, a variant of the 601 sequence (Fig. 3A) (29.Poirier M.G. Bussiek M. Langowski J. Widom J. J. Mol. Biol. 2008; 379: 772-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 34.Lowary P.T. Widom J. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 276: 19-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (1212) Google Scholar). The reconstitutions were characterized by gel shift analysis on a native polyacrylamide gel and by sucrose gradient centrifugation (Fig. 3, B–D). Gel shift analysis is sensitive to changes in the overall structure of the nucleosome, such as changes in the position of the nucleosome on a DNA sequence (15.Muthurajan U.M. Bao Y. Forsberg L.J.

LPS also provides an environment for folding of outer membrane proteins. In this work, we describe the structure-activity correlation of a series of 12-residue peptides in LPS. NMR structures of the peptides derived in complex with LPS reveal boomerang-like β-strand conformations that are stabilized by intimate packing between the two aromatic residues located at the 4 and 9 positions. This structural feature renders these peptides with a high ability to neutralize endotoxicity, >80% at 10 nm concentration, of LPS. Replacements of these aromatic residues either with Ala or with Leu destabilizes the boomerang structure with the concomitant loss of antiendotoxic and antimicrobial activities. Furthermore, the aromatic packing stabilizing the β-boomerang structure in LPS is found to be maintained even in a truncated octapeptide, defining a structured LPS binding motif. The mode of action of the active designed peptides correlates well with their ability to perturb LPS micelle structures. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy studies of the peptides delineate β-type conformations and immobilization of phosphate head groups of LPS. Trp fluorescence studies demonstrated selective interactions with LPS and the depth of insertion into the LPS bilayer.

The release of cytokines in response to microbial invasion is a natural function of the innate immunity. However, an uncontrolled and overwhelming production of these cytokines may cause “endotoxic shock” or septic shock, typified by endothelial tissue damage, loss of vascular tone, coagulopathy, and multiple organ failure, often resulting in death (9Fink P.F. Berk J.L. Sampliner J.E. Sepsis Syndrome: Handbook of Critical Care. Little, Brown and Co., Boston1990: 619Google Scholar, 10Hardaway R.M. Am. Surg. 2000; 66: 22-29PubMed Google Scholar). Sepsis is the major cause of mortality in the intensive care unit, accounting for 200,000 deaths every year in the United States alone (13Martin G.S. Mannino D.M. Eaton S. Moss M. N. Engl. J. Med. 2003; 348: 1546-1554Crossref PubMed Scopus (4831) Google Scholar). It was demonstrated that release of LPS from antibiotic-treated Gram-negative bacteria can indeed enhance sepsis (14Dofferhoff A.S.M. Buys J. Faist E. Differential Release and Impact of Antibiotic-Induced Endotoxin. Raven Press, New York1995: 11-15Google Scholar). Therefore, an effective antibiotic should not only exert antibacterial activities but also have the ability to sequester LPS and ameliorate its toxicity. Therefore, an amalgamated property of LPS-neutralizing and antimicrobial activity would be highly desirable for antimicrobial agents. Polymyxin B is a prototypical antimicrobial and antiendotoxic antibiotic; however, its neurotoxicity and nephrotoxicity limit its application to topical use (15Rustici A. Velucchi M. Faggioni R. Sironi M. Ghezzi P. Quataert S. Green B. Porro M. Science. 1993; 259: 361-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The increasing emergence of bacterial strains that are resistant to conventional antibiotics has initiated vital structure/function studies of membrane-perturbing cationic antimicrobial peptides (16Hancock R.E.

More recent studies have been conducted to understand interactions between antimicrobial peptides with LPS to gain insights into the mechanism of outer membrane perturbation, antibacterial activities, and LPS neutralization (21Rosenfeld Y.

These studies have delineated the role of amino acid sequence properties, LPS-peptide interactions by biophysical methods, and global structural parameters, obtained by CD and FTIR. Designing synthetic peptides and elucidation of three-dimensional structures in complex with LPS would be useful for the purpose of rational development of non-toxic antisepsis and antimicrobial therapeutics. Such studies will also be potentially instructive in establishing rules by which folded structures can be stabilized on the LPS surface. Extensive work in the field of peptide design primarily focuses on mimicking secondary structures and tertiary folds of proteins. Usually, short linear peptides are often structurally flexible; however, the functions of these peptides are highly dependent on their ability to adopt folded structures upon complex formation with their cognate receptors. In this regard, designed peptides that would yield high resolution structures in complex with LPS have not been well pursued. LPS, being a negatively charged amphiphilic molecule, interacts with naturally occurring peptides or protein fragments containing basic/polar and hydrophobic amino acids, although there are considerable variations in lengths, sequences, and amino acid compositions among these peptides (27Jerala R. Porro M. Curr. Top. Med. Chem. 2004; 4: 1173-1184Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 28Scott M.G. Vreugdenhil A.C. Buurman W.A. Hancock R.E. Gold M.R. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 549-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Here, we have determined the three-dimensional structures of a series of 12-residue peptides in the context of LPS. To the best of our knowledge, these results show, for the first time, that atomic resolution structures of designed peptides obtained in LPS could be correlated with their antiendotoxic activities. Furthermore, the LPS-induced structures of active, inactive, and short peptide motif, presented here, may provide building blocks for the designing novel proteins for the outer membrane. LPS of Escherichia coli 0111:B4 and fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated lipopolysaccharide from E. coli 055:B5 and spin-labeled lipids 5-doxyl-stearic acid (5-DSA) and 16-doxyl-stearic acid (16-DSA) were purchased from Sigma. Peptides were synthesized commercially by GL Biochem (Shanghai, China) and further purified by a reverse-phase HPLC, WatersTM, using a C18 column (300 Å pore size, 5-μm particle size) by a linear gradient of acetonitrile/water mixture. The molecular weight of the peptides was confirmed by mass spectrometry. The ability of the designed peptides to neutralize or inhibit LPS was assessed using a quantitative chromogenic limulus amoebocyte lysate (LAL) with a QCL-1000 (Cambrex) kit. Endotoxin neutralization experiments were carried out following the protocols provided by the vendor and published else where (26Snyder D.S. McIntosh T.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11777-11787Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 27Jerala R. Porro M. Curr. Top. Med. Chem. 2004; 4: 1173-1184Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Stock solutions of peptides were prepared in pyrogen-free water provided with the kit. Peptides at concentrations of 0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 5, and 10 μm were incubated with three different endotoxin units (EU) of LPS, namely 1, 3, and 8 EU/ml (1 EU ∼0.1 ng of LPS), in a flat bottom nonpyrogenic 96-well tissue culture plate, at 37 °C for 30 min to allow peptide binding to LPS (26Snyder D.S. McIntosh T.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11777-11787Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). A total of 50 μl of this mixture was then added to equal volume of LAL reagent, and the mixture was further incubated for 10 min followed by the addition of 100 μl of chromogenic substrate (Ac-Ile-Ala-Arg-p-nitroaniline). The reaction was terminated by the addition of 25% acetic acid, and the yellow color that developed due to cleavage of the substrate was measured spectrophotometrically at 410 nm using a Benchmark plus microplate spectrophotometer (Bio-Rad). The reduction of A410 as a function of peptide concentrations is directly proportional to the inhibition of LPS by the peptide (29Tack B.F. Sawai M.V. Kearney W.R. Robertson A.D. Sherman M.A. Wang W.

Chem. 2004; 279: 50150-50156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). All assays were repeated twice, and average values are reported. Antimicrobial activities of the designed peptides were determined following a previously reported method (31Zou G. de Leeuw E. Li C. Pazgier M. Li C. Zeng P. Lu W.Y. Lubkowski J. Lu W. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 19653-19665Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Briefly, bacterial cells used for this assay, e.g. E. coli DH5alpha, Bacillus subtilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853, and Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, were cultured in Luria-Bertani (LB) media at 37 °C overnight. Cells were centrifuged and washed with the assay buffer (10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4) and diluted to an A600 of 0.2. About 50 μl of these bacterial cell suspensions were incubated, in a sterile 96-well microtiter plate, with the same volume of peptides at various concentrations, ranging from 1 to 200 μm, diluted from a stock solution of 0.3 mm (prepared in the same buffer) at 37 °C for 2 h. The cell suspensions were then plated onto Mueller-Hinton agar plates and incubated overnight. The minimum inhibitory concentration was expressed as the lowest concentration of the peptide where there was no visible growth of the bacteria. All of the fluorescence experiments were performed using a Cary Eclipse fluorescence spectrophotometer (Varian, Inc.). To study the interactions of peptides with FITC-conjugated LPS, 0.5 μm FITC-LPS samples were excited at 480 nm, and change in the emission of FITC at 515 nm was monitored with various concentrations (0.01, 0.02, 0.1, 0.5, 1.0, 5.0, and 10 μm) of peptides. Samples were prepared in 10 mm phosphate buffer, pH 6.0. For the intrinsic Trp fluorescence studies of peptides, 5 μm of each peptide was titrated with varying concentrations of LPS or DPC in a 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer at pH 6.0. The intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence emission spectra of the peptides in their free or lipid-bound forms were acquired by exciting samples at 280 nm using band passes of 5 nm for both the excitation and the emission monochromators in a 0.1-cm path length quartz cuvette. Quenching of tryptophan fluorescence was examined following sequential additions of various concentrations (0.02–3 m) of acrylamide into solutions containing peptide (5 μm) in its free and lipid-bound forms. The results of the quenching reactions were analyzed according to the Stern-Volmer equation, F0/F = 1 + KSV[Q], where F0 and F are the fluorescence intensities at the emission maxima in the absence and presence of quencher, respectively, KSV is the Stern-Volmer quenching constant, and [Q] is the molar quencher concentration. Quenching of Trp fluorescence by spin-labeled lipids (5-DSA and 16-DSA) was used to estimate the depth of insertion of the peptides into LPS bilayer or vesicle by parallax method (32Chattopadhyay A. London E. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 39-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar). LPS bilayer was prepared by dissolving the appropriate amount of LPS in 2:1 chloroform/methanol solution. The organic solvent was evaporated to dryness under vacuum. The lipid film was hydrated with 10 mm phosphate buffer, pH 6.0, at 60 °C and vortexed briefly. This mixture was frozen and thawed five times and extruded through a 0.1-μm membrane with the extruder (Avanti Polar Lipids, Alabaster, AL). Various concentrations of spin-labeled lipids, 5-DSA or 16-DSA, were added, from a stock solution of 1 mm (prepared in methanol) into solutions containing 5 μm peptides and 40 μm LPS vesicle. The location of the tryptophan into LPS bilayer was determined by comparing the extent of quenching observed from shallow (5-DSA) and deep (16-DSA) quenchers following the equation (29Tack B.F. Sawai M.V. Kearney W.R. Robertson A.D. Sherman M.A. Wang W. Hong T. Boo L.M. Wu H. Waring A.J. Lehrer R.I. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 1181-1189Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) Z1F=(1-CInF1F2-L212)/2L21Eq. 1 where Z1F is the difference in depth between the shallow quencher and the tryptophan residue, and F1 and F2 are the difference between the tryptophan fluorescence intensities in the presence and absence of shallow and deep quenchers, respectively. Assuming the usual surface area of the lipid to be 70 Å, C is the quencher mole fraction in unit area. L21 is the difference in depth between the two quenchers. Once Z1F is calculated, the distance of tryptophan from the center of the bilayer was calculated from ZCF = Z1F + Lcl, where Lcl is the distance from the center of the bilayer to the shallow quencher. ITC experiments were performed using a VP-ITC microcalorimeter (MicroCal Inc., Northampton, MA). All samples, dissolved in 10 mm phosphate buffer, pH 6.0, were degassed prior to use. LPS at a concentration of 0.05 mm was loaded into the sample cell (volume 1.4359 ml), and the reference cell was filled with the above mentioned buffer. Peptides, at a concentration of 1 mm, were placed into the injection. A typical titration involved 35 injections of 2.5-μl aliquots of YI12 peptides into the sample cell, at an interval of 4 min, at 25 °C. The reaction cell was stirred continuously at 300 rpm. Raw data were collected and integrated using the MicroCal Origin 5.0 software supplied with the instrument. A single site binding model was fitted to the data by non-linear least square analysis to yield the association constant (Ka) and enthalpy change (ΔH). ΔG and ΔS were calculated using the fundamental equations of thermodynamics: ΔG = −RT ln Ka and ΔS = (ΔH− ΔG)/T, respectively. To obtain information on the ability of designed peptides to dissociate LPS aggregates, dynamic light-scattering measurements were carried out in an BI-9000AT with digital autocorrelator (Brookhaven Instruments Corp., Holtsville, NY). The peptide and buffer solutions were filtered through 0.45-μm filters (Whatman Inc). Measurements were made for 1 μm LPS (without any peptides), and upon incubation with 2 μm peptides, the scattering data were collected at 90°. The data were analyzed through the standard CONTIN method using the dynamic light-scattering software supplied with the instrument. All of the NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker DRX 600 spectrometer, equipped with cryo-probe and pulse field gradients. Data acquisition and processing were performed with the Topspin software (Bruker) running on a Linux workstation. Sequence-specific resonance assignments of the peptides were achieved from two-dimensional total correlation spectroscopy (TOCSY) and nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy (NOESY) spectra acquired in aqueous solution containing 10% D2O at pH 4.8, 298 K. The peptide concentrations were 0.6 mm, and mixing times were 80 and 400 ms for TOCSY and NOESY, respectively. The interactions of the designed peptides with LPS were examined by recording series of one-dimensional proton NMR spectra whereby 0.6 mm peptides were titrated with various concentrations, 5, 10, and 16 μm LPS. Tr-NOESY spectra were typically obtained either at 10 μm or at 13 μm LPS, which generated a large number of Tr-NOE cross-peaks. The two-dimensional Tr-NOESY spectra were recorded at three different mixing times: 100, 150, and 200 ms with 512 increments in t1 and 2048 data points in t2. Tr-NOESY spectra were also obtained in D2O for unambiguous assignments of aromatic/aromatic or aromatic/aliphatic NOEs. The spectral width was normally 12 ppm in both dimensions. After 16 dummy scans, 72 scans were recorded per t1 increment. NMR data analyses were carried out using the program SPARKY (T. D. Goddard and D. G. Kneller, University of California, San Francisco, CA). 31P NMR spectra of LPS were recorded on a Bruker DRX 400 spectrometer at 298 K. Data acquisition and processing were performed with the Topspin software (Bruker) suite. The interactions of the designed peptides with LPS were examined by recording series of one-dimensional 31P NMR spectra whereby 0.2 mm LPS in water (pH 4.5) was titrated with various concentrations (0.1, 0.2, and 0.4 mm) of designed peptides from a stock solution that was prepared in an unbuffered water (pH 4.5). NMR structures were calculated using the DYANA program, version 1.5 (33Güntert P. Mumenthaler C. Wüthrich K. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 283-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (2555) Google Scholar). NOE intensities were qualitatively categorized as strong, medium, and weak based on cross-peak intensities in the Tr-NOESY spectra obtained at a mixing time of 150 ms. The NOESY cross-peaks were further translated to upper bound distance limits of 2.5, 3.5, and 5.0 Å, corresponding to strong, medium, and weak intensities, respectively. Only the ϕ dihedral angles were constrained between −30 and −180° to maintain a good stereochemistry of the calculated structures. Out of the 100 structures generated, the 20 lowest energy structures were used for more analysis. FTIR spectra were recorded on a Nicolet Nexus 560 spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.) purged with N2 and equipped with a mercury-cadmium-telluride (MCT/A) detector cooled with liquid nitrogen. Attenuated total reflection (ATR) spectra were measured with a 25-reflections ATR accessory from Graseby Specac (Kent, UK) and a wire grid polarizer (0.25 mm, Graseby Specac). Approximately 200 μl of a D2O solution of LPS alone or in the presence of peptide in a 20:1 lipid/peptide molar ratio were applied onto a trapezoidal (50 × 2 × 20 mm) germanium internal reflection element. A dry, or D2O-saturated, N2 stream flowing through the ATR compartment was used to remove bulk water (low hydration) or to fully hydrate the sample (high hydration), respectively. A total of 200 scans were collected at a resolution of 4 cm−1, averaged, and processed with one-point zero filling and Happ-Genzel apodization. In an earlier study, we have determined LPS-bound structure and antiendotoxic activity of a 12-residue synthetic peptide (34Bhattacharjya S. Domadia P.N. Bhunia A. Malladi S. David S.A. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 5864-5874Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). This peptide, YVLWKRKRMIFI, was designed using a co-crystal structure of LPS/FhuA (1 QFG) an outer membrane protein. The outer membrane proteins of Gram-negative bacteria are rich in β-sheet, assuming a β-barrel topology (35Schulz G.E. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2000; 10: 443-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). The folding and stability of these proteins are maintained by a specific environment of LPS (5de Cock H. Tommassen J.

Chem. 2003; 278: 9092-9099Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). In complex with LPS, the designed peptide assumed a novel amphipathic structure whereby the cationic and hydrophobic residues were segregated into distinctly different regions (34Bhattacharjya S. Domadia P.N. Bhunia A. Malladi S. David S.A. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 5864-5874Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The C terminus of the peptide showed two consecutive β-turns, whereas the N terminus appeared to be extended. In LPS inhibition assays, the peptide showed relatively weak activity (IC50 ∼ 10 μm). Interestingly, in the LPS-bound state, residues Trp4 and Met9 of the designed peptide showed NOE contacts, indicating that they are within ≤5 Å apart. The Met residue was introduced into the primary sequence as an NMR chemical shift marker (34Bhattacharjya S. Domadia P.N. Bhunia A. Malladi S. David S.A. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 5864-5874Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Here, we have replaced Met9 with aromatic residues, Trp, Phe, and Tyr, to enhance packing interactions with Trp4 in complex with LPS. Such substitution may result in a defined folded structure with a large hydrophobic surface of the peptide in the context of LPS with a plausible enhancement in endotoxin neutralization and antimicrobial activities (Table 1). To underscore the role of presumable aromatic-aromatic interactions, peptides containing Ala4/Ala9 and Leu4/Leu9 were also prepared (Table 1). The Leu residues were particularly introduced to determine correlation of the hydrophobicity and aromatic-aromatic packing to the folding and activities of these peptides. To understand the specific role of Trp in the structure/activity, another peptide containing Phe at positions 4 and 9 has also been made (Table 1). In addition, an octapeptide was prepared to elucidate the role(s) of the hydrophobic residues at the N and C termini (Table 1).TABLE 1Sequences, HPLC retention time, LPS neutralization (in μm) and minimum inhibitory concentration (in μm) of the designed peptidesPeptide NameSequenceRetention timeaA C18 reverse phase semi-preparative column was used.

Open table in a new tab To determine the ability of the peptides to inhibit or neutralize LPS, sensitive chromogenic LAL assays were conducted (see “Experimental Procedures”). This assay can detect endotoxin at very low concentrations down to ∼1 pm. LAL assays were conducted at three different LPS concentrations, 1, 3, and 8 EU/ml, with six different concentrations of peptides. As can be seen, peptides containing aromatic residues at positions 4 and 9, i.e. YI12WF, YI12WW, YI12WY, and YI12FF (Table 1), demonstrated the inhibition of LPS-mediated activation of LAL enzyme (Fig. 1). Peptides YI12WF, YI12WW, and YI12WY inhibited ≥80% endotoxin even at a concentration of 10 nm at 1 EU/ml (Fig. 1, top) and 3 EU/ml (Fig. 1, middle). At these LPS concentrations, ≥95% inhibition is observed at 100 nm concentrations for YI12WF, YI12WY, and YI12WW peptides (Fig. 1, top and middle). The YI12FF peptide shows a weak inhibitory activity, only ≤40% at 10 μm concentration at 1- and 3-EU/ml doses of LPS (Fig. 1, top and middle). Even at a mu"
https://openalex.org/W2129637610,"Erythropoietin can be over-expressed in skeletal muscles by gene electrotransfer, resulting in 100-fold increase in serum EPO and significant increases in haemoglobin levels. Earlier studies have suggested that EPO improves several metabolic parameters when administered to chronically ill kidney patients. Thus we applied the EPO over-expression model to investigate the metabolic effect of EPO in vivo.At 12 weeks, EPO expression resulted in a 23% weight reduction (P<0.01) in EPO transfected obese mice; thus the mice weighed 21.9+/-0.8 g (control, normal diet,) 21.9+/-1.4 g (EPO, normal diet), 35.3+/-3.3 g (control, high-fat diet) and 28.8+/-2.6 g (EPO, high-fat diet). Correspondingly, DXA scanning revealed that this was due to a 28% reduction in adipose tissue mass.The decrease in adipose tissue mass was accompanied by a complete normalisation of fasting insulin levels and glucose tolerance in the high-fat fed mice. EPO expression also induced a 14% increase in muscle volume and a 25% increase in vascularisation of the EPO transfected muscle. Muscle force and stamina were not affected by EPO expression. PCR array analysis revealed that genes involved in lipid metabolism, thermogenesis and inflammation were increased in muscles in response to EPO expression, while genes involved in glucose metabolism were down-regulated. In addition, muscular fat oxidation was increased 1.8-fold in both the EPO transfected and contralateral muscles.In conclusion, we have shown that EPO when expressed in supra-physiological levels has substantial metabolic effects including protection against diet-induced obesity and normalisation of glucose sensitivity associated with a shift to increased fat metabolism in the muscles."
https://openalex.org/W2005266375,"Proteomic studies with Arabidopsis thaliana have revealed that the plant-specific Tau (U) class glutathione transferases (GSTs) are selectively retained by S-hexylglutathione affinity supports. Overexpression of members of the Arabidopsis GST superfamily in Escherichia coli showed that 25 of the complement of 28 GSTUs caused the aberrant accumulation of acylated glutathione thioesters in vivo, a perturbation that was not observed with other GST classes. Each GSTU caused a specific group of fatty acyl derivatives to accumulate, which varied in chain length (C(6) to C(18)), additional oxygen content (0 or 1), and desaturation (0 or 1). Thioesters bound tightly to recombinant GSTs (K(d) approximately 1 microm), explaining their accumulation. Transient expression of GSTUs in Nicotiana benthamiana followed by recovery by Strep-tag affinity chromatography allowed the respective plant ligands to be extracted and characterized. Again, each GST showed a distinct profile of recovered metabolites, notably glutathionylated oxophytodienoic acid and related oxygenated fatty acids. Similarly, the expression of the major Tau protein GSTU19 in the endogenous host Arabidopsis led to the selective binding of the glutathionylated oxophytodienoic acid-glutathione conjugate, with the enzyme able to catalyze the conjugation reaction. Additional ligands identified in planta included other fatty acid derivatives including divinyl ethers and glutathionylated chlorogenic acid. The strong and specific retention of various oxygenated fatty acids by each GSTU and the conservation in binding observed in the different hosts suggest that these proteins have selective roles in binding and conjugating these unstable metabolites in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1974715066,"Staphylococcus aureus regulates the production of extracellular virulence factors using the agr quorum-sensing system. This regulatory system responds to a secreted peptide thiolactone signal called an autoinducing peptide (AIP). The biosynthesis of AIP requires AgrD, the peptide precursor of AIP, and the integral membrane endopeptidase AgrB. In this study, we performed a molecular analysis of AgrD to identify peptide regions important for processing and AIP secretion. As a lead-in to this study, we discovered that AIP type I could be generated in Escherichia coli through the heterologous expression of the agrBD genes, allowing the use of E. coli as an expression host for investigating the biosynthetic pathway. One of the most conserved regions of AgrD is the charged C-terminal tail, and through truncation analysis, the first nine residues were found to be essential for AIP production and AgrB endopeptidase activity. Within this essential region, mutation of residues glutamate 34 or leucine 41 inhibited AIP production and AgrB activity. Following cleavage, AgrB is hypothesized to form an enzyme-bound intermediate with the AgrD N-terminal region, but clear evidence of this intermediate has never been presented. By inactivating the AgrD cysteine 28 residue, an AgrD-AgrB structure was stabilized and detected in immunoblots using N-terminal His6-tagged AgrD. Formation of the structure could not be detected using the AgrB C84S mutation, indicating the cysteine residue is essential for its formation. These studies provide new insights on the requirements and mechanism of S. aureus AIP biosynthesis."
https://openalex.org/W2025839848,"Sulf-1 and Sulf-2 are novel extracellular sulfatases that act on internal glucosamine 6-O-sulfate modifications within heparan sulfate proteoglycans and regulate their interactions with various signaling molecules, including Wnt ligands. Although the Sulfs are multidomain proteins, there is limited information available about how the subdomains contribute to their enzymatic and signaling activities. In this study, we found that both human Sulfs were synthesized as prepro-enzymes and cleaved by a furin-type proteinase to form disulfide-bond linked heterodimers of 75- and 50-kDa subunits. The mature Sulfs were secreted into conditioned medium, as well as retained on the cell membrane. Although the catalytic center resides in the N-terminal 75-kDa subunit, the C-terminal 50-kDa subunit was indispensable for both arylsufatase and glucosamine 6-O-sulfate-endosulfatase activity. We found that the hydrophilic regions of the Sulfs were essential for endosulfatase activity but not for arylsulfatase activity. Using Edman sequencing, we identified furin-type proteinase cleavage sites in Sulf-1 and Sulf-2. Deletion of these sequences resulted in uncleavable forms of Sulfs. The uncleavable Sulfs retained enzymatic activity. However, they were unable to potentiate Wnt signaling, which may be due to their defective localization into lipid rafts on the plasma membrane."

We fabricated diamond superlattices by creating multilayer structures of isotopically pure carbon isotopes carbon-12 (12C) and carbon-13 (13C), which confine electrons by a difference in band-gap energy of 17 millielectron volts. Cathodoluminescence experiments performed at 80 kelvin showed that excitonic recombination in the higher-energy band of 13C vanishes in favor of increased recombination in the lower-energy 12C material. Carrier confinement was achieved in diamond superlattices made up of both thinner (30 nanometers) and thicker (up to 350 nanometers) layers."
https://openalex.org/W2070806415,"pICln is an essential, highly conserved 26-kDa protein whose functions include binding to Sm proteins in the cytoplasm of human cells and mediating the ordered and regulated assembly of the cell's RNA-splicing machinery by the survival motor neurons complex. pICln also interacts with PRMT5, the enzyme responsible for generating symmetric dimethylarginine modifications on the carboxyl-terminal regions of three of the canonical Sm proteins. To better understand the role of pICln in these cellular processes, we have investigated the properties of pICln and pICln.Sm complexes and the effects that pICln has on the methyltransferase activity of PRMT5. We find that pICln is a monomer in solution, binds with high affinity (K(d) approximately 160 nm) to SmD3-SmB, and forms 1:1 complexes with Sm proteins and Sm protein subcomplexes. The data support an end-capping model of pICln binding that supports current views of how pICln prevents Sm oligomerization on illicit RNA substrates. We have found that by co-expression with pICln, recombinant PRMT5 can be produced in a soluble, active form. PRMT5 alone has promiscuous activity toward a variety of known substrates. In the presence of pICln, however, PRMT5 methylation of Sm proteins is stimulated, but methylation of histones is inhibited. We have also found that mutations in pICln that do not affect Sm protein binding can still have a profound effect on the methyltransferase activity of the PRMT5 complex. Together, the data provide insights into pICln function and represent an important starting point for biochemical analyses of PRMT5."
https://openalex.org/W1981453024,"The small GTPases RalA and RalB are multifunctional proteins regulating a variety of cellular processes. Like other GTPases, the activity of Ral is regulated by the opposing effects of guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) and GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs).

Here, we report the first molecular identification of RalGAPs, which we have named RalGAP1 and RalGAP2. They are large heterodimeric complexes, each consisting of a catalytic α1 or α2 subunit and a common Β subunit. These RalGAP complexes share structural and catalytic similarities with the tuberous sclerosis tumor suppressor complex, which acts as a GAP for Rheb. In vitro GTPase assays revealed that recombinant RalGAP1 accelerates the GTP hydrolysis rate of RalA by 280,000-fold. Heterodimerization was required for this GAP activity. In PC12 cells, knockdown of the Β subunit led to sustained Ral activation upon epidermal growth factor stimulation, indicating that the RalGAPs identified here are critical for efficient termination of Ral activation induced by extracellular stimuli.

Members of the Ras superfamily of small GTPases act as molecular switches by cycling between an inactive GDP-bound conformation and an active GTP-bound conformation. In their GTP-bound form, small GTPases interact with their effector proteins to induce downstream signaling events.

Another class of RalGEFs consists of RalGPS1/RalGEF2 (21Rebhun J.F. Chen H. Quilliam L.A. J. Biol.

The finding that Ras can activate most RalGEFs in addition to Raf and phosphoinositide 3-kinases suggested that Ral GTPases mediate some functions of oncogenic Ras. Recent studies using human cells have revealed an essential contribution of this Ras-RalGEFs-Ral signaling pathway to Ras-induced tumorigenic transformation (24Hamad N.M. Elconin J.H. Karnoub A.E.

Although these studies highlight the importance of appropriate regulation of Ral activity in normal cells, the negative regulators for Ral GTPases, namely RalGAPs, have not yet been identified. A report by Feig and co-workers (26Emkey R. Freedman S. Feig L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9703-9706Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrated the existence of Ral-specific GAP activity in the cytosolic fraction of brain and testis. However, the molecule(s) responsible for this GAP activity still remains elusive. In this study we report the molecular identification of RalGAPs, which we have named RalGAP1 and RalGAP2. They are large heterodimeric complexes, each composed of a catalytic α1 or α2 subunit and a common Β subunit. Interestingly, the RalGAP complexes have structural and catalytic similarities to the tuberous sclerosis tumor suppressor complex. All purification procedures were performed at 4 °C unless otherwise noted. Eight porcine brains were homogenized in 1.6 liters of buffer A (50 mm HEPES/KOH, pH 7.4, 78 mm KCl, 4 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EGTA, 0.2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol) containing protease inhibitors (protease inhibitor mixture for mammalian cells; Sigma) using a Waring blender followed by a glass-Teflon homogenizer. The homogenate was centrifuged at 2800 × g for 30 min to remove coarse particulates. The supernatant was dialyzed overnight against 5 liters of buffer A. The dialyzed material was further centrifuged at 120,000 × g for 1 h to obtain clarified cytosol (∼5 mg of protein ml−1, 1.2 liters). The cytosol was supplemented with the non-hydrolyzable GTP analogue guanosine 5′-(Β,γ-imido)triphosphate (GppNHp) (10 μm; Sigma) and used for RalAQ72L affinity chromatography as described below. For preparation of the affinity column, glutathione S-transferase (GST)-RalAQ72L (residues 9–183, 160 mg) was immobilized on 8 ml of glutathione beads (Glutathione-Sepharose 4B; GE Healthcare). RalAQ72L-bound nucleotides were exchanged for GppNHp by incubating the beads in buffer A containing 10 mm EDTA and 1 mm GppNHp at room temperature for 90 min. The GppNHp-bound form of RalAQ72L was stabilized by adding MgCl2 to a final concentration of 14 mm. These affinity beads were packed into the PolyPrep columns (Bio-Rad), and porcine brain cytosol prepared as above was loaded onto these columns. After washing the columns with 20 column volumes of buffer A, bound proteins were eluted with 2 column volumes of buffer B (50 mm HEPES, KOH, pH 7.4, 78 mm KCl, 10 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm GDP). The eluate (16 ml) was passed through a glutathione beads column (0.4 ml) to remove GST-RalAQ72L that leaked from the affinity column during the elution step and then concentrated to ∼0.6-ml using a Centriprep YM-100 (Millipore). The concentrated sample was applied to a Superose 6 10/300 GL gel filtration column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with buffer A, and fractions of 0.6 ml were collected. Fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining. Protein bands of p240 and p170 were excised from the gel and subjected to mass spectrometry analyses as described previously (27Higashi T. Ikeda T. Shirakawa R. Kondo H. Kawato M. Horiguchi M.

We performed essentially the same purification scheme used for the p240-p170 complex purification except that purification was performed on a 1/10 scale with freshly isolated lungs of thirty male Wister rats. The affinity column eluate was fractionated on a Superose 6 PC3.2/30 column (SMART chromatography system; GE Healthcare), and fractions containing p170 (fractions 17–22) were pooled and used for GTPase assays. As a comparison, we treated rat brains in the same fashion. We amplified full-length p240 cDNA by PCR from human brain Marathon-Ready cDNA (BD Biosciences) and cloned it into the XhoI site of pBluescript II SK(+) (Stratagene). We sequenced six independent clones and found that all of them contained a 141-bp insertion after bp 2266 of the deposited cDNA sequence for Homo sapiens GTPase-activating Rap/Ran GAP domain-like 1 (NM_014990). This insertion encodes a 47-amino acid sequence without changing the reading frame. The N1950K mutation was introduced by PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis. The p170 cDNA (KIAA1219) was obtained from Kazusa DNA Research Institute (Chiba, Japan). These cDNAs were subcloned into pFastBac HT to generate recombinant baculoviruses (Bac-to-Bac Baculovirus Expression System; Invitrogen). The cDNAs for RalA, RalB, H-Ras, Rap1A, Rheb, RhoA (27Higashi T. Ikeda T. Shirakawa R. Kondo H. Kawato M. Horiguchi M. Okuda T. Okawa K. Fukai S. Nureki O. Kita T. Horiuchi H. J. Biol.

The truncated version of RalA (residues 9–183) (29Fukai S. Matern H.T. Jagath J.R. Scheller R.H. Brunger A.T. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3267-3278Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) with a Q72L mutation was generated by PCR and subcloned into pGEX-2T. All constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. His6-tagged p240 and p170 were expressed in Sf9 insect cells and affinity-purified on nickel beads (nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose; Qiagen). Purified proteins were concentrated and further purified on a Superose 6 PC3.2/30 gel filtration column equilibrated with buffer A. The peak fractions were stored at 4 °C and used for GTPase assays within 3 days. GST fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21 (DE3) transformed with the corresponding pGEX plasmids and affinity-purified on glutathione beads. Purified proteins were dialyzed against buffer A, snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C until use. Protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad) or by densitometry of Coomassie Blue-stained gels using bovine serum albumin as a standard in both cases. We assessed GAP activity using a nitrocellulose filter binding assay or thin layer chromatography. For the filter binding assay, GST fusion GTPases were loaded with [γ-32P]GTP in buffer A containing 10 mm EDTA and 10 μm [γ-32P]GTP (∼3000 cpm pmol−1; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) at 30 °C for 15 min. Loading reactions were stopped by chilling on ice and adding MgCl2 to a final concentration of 14 mm. GTPase assays were performed at 30 °C in 20-μl mixtures containing 20 pmol of labeled GTPases and test materials. Reactions were stopped by diluting the 20-μl mixtures into 0.8 ml of ice-cold buffer A and filtering on 0.45-μm nitrocellulose filters (Whatman). Filters were washed twice with 4 ml of ice-cold buffer A, dried, and counted in a liquid scintillation counter. For the thin layer chromatography analysis, GTPase assays were performed with GST fusion GTPases preloaded with [α-32P]GTP (∼6000 cpm pmol−1; PerkinElmer). Nucleotides trapped on the filters were eluted at 85 °C for 3 min with buffer A containing 0.1% SDS, 10 mm EDTA, 1 mm GTP, and 1 mm GDP. Released nucleotides were spotted on polyethyleneimine cellulose plates (Merck) and chromatographed with 1 m LiCl and 1 m formic acid. Plates were dried and processed for autoradiography. Rabbit anti-p240 polyclonal antibodies were raised against a recombinant fragment of p240 (residues 803–1080) and the following synthetic peptides: MFSKKPHGDVKKSTQKVLD (residues 1–19) and SMSDQEKPEEPPTSNEC (residues 1630–1646). We used the anti-recombinant p240 antibody for Western blot analysis and the anti-peptide antibodies for immunoprecipitation assays. Rabbit anti-p170 antibody was raised against the peptide KRLESDSYSPPHVRRKQKI (residues 1442–1460). Rabbit anti-p220 antibody was raised against the peptide AQEDADKLGLSETDSKE (residues 451–467). Other antibodies used were anti-RalA, -Ras, -Sec6, -Sec8, (BD Biosciences), anti-tubulin α (Sigma), anti-phospho-extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-Sec5 (28Kawato M.

For immunoprecipitation assays, porcine brain cytosol (Fig. 1E), rat testis cytosol (Fig. 3B), or rat lung cytosol (Fig. 3E) were incubated at 4 °C for 3 h with the indicated antibodies prebound to protein A beads (Protein A-agarose; Roche Applied Science). Where indicated, immunoprecipitates were prepared in the presence of 50 μg of antigen peptides. Beads were washed 4 times with buffer A containing 0.1% (w/v) Triton X-100, and proteins bound to the beads were analyzed by Western blotting. In Fig. 3E, washed beads were directly incubated with radiolabeled GTPases. For immunodepletion assays, 10 μl of packed protein A beads were incubated at 4 °C for 1 h with the indicated antisera (20 μl each) and then washed 5 times with buffer A. Aliquots of fraction 18 (Fig. 1F) or the pooled lung fraction (Fig. 3C) were incubated with the IgG-coated beads at 4 °C for 3 h. Beads were removed by brief centrifugation, and the supernatants were used for GTPase assays.FIGURE 3The p220-p170 complex; a second RalGAP identified from rat lung.

The homogenates were centrifuged at 2,000 × g for 10 min, and the supernatants were further centrifuged at 200,000 × g for 10 min. Aliquots of the resulting supernatants (100 μg total protein) were analyzed by Western blotting with the indicated antibodies. We used two distinct short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) targeting rat/mouse p170 (StealthTM RNAi; Invitrogen): 5′-GAAACCUGGGAAGUCUUACUGUUGU-3′ (p170 siRNA#1) and 5′-GAUUGAUGUUGUGGUUCCUUACUUU-3′ (p170 siRNA#2). Their scrambled sequences were used as controls. PC12 cells were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 10% horse serum in 6-cm culture dishes. Cells at ∼40% confluency were transfected with the individual siRNAs (50 nm) with RNAiMAX transfection regent (Invitrogen). Seventy-two hours after transfection cells were rinsed once with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 0.8 ml of ice-cold buffer C (50 mm HEPES/KOH, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 4 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1% (w/v) Triton X-100, 10 mm Β-glycerophosphate, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4) containing protease inhibitors. Lysates were rotated at 4 °C for 5 min and then centrifuged at 200,000 × g for 5 min. The supernatants were incubated at 4 °C for 30 min with glutathione beads precoated with 20 μg of GST-Sec5 Ral binding domain. After washing the beads three times with buffer C, bead-associated RalA was analyzed by Western blotting. Part of the supernatants was taken before the incubation and used for Western blot analysis to assess knockdown efficiencies. NIH3T3 cells were lysed at 48 h after siRNA transfection and processed as described above. For epidermal growth factor (EGF) stimulation assays, we used the p170 siRNA#1 and siRNA#2 in combination at 25 nm each. PC12 cells treated with the siRNAs were serum-starved for 8 h and then stimulated with EGF (20 ng ml−1; R&D Systems). After stimulation, cells were harvested in buffer C at the indicated time points, and the GTP-bound forms of RalA and Ras were pulled down using glutathione beads precoated with both GST-Sec5 Ral binding domain and GST-Raf1 Ras binding domain (20 μg each). To purify RalGAP, we applied an affinity chromatography approach using RalAQ72L as bait. In general, Ras family GTPases with a glutamine to leucine substitution in the switch II region (Q61L in Ras) are resistant to GAP-stimulated GTP hydrolysis, whereas these mutants can still bind to their cognate GAPs (1Bos J.L.

RasQ61L, although unable to hydrolyze GTP efficiently, has higher affinities than wild type for RasGAPs, p120GAP, and NF1/neurofibromin (22de Bruyn K.M. de Rooij J. Wolthuis R.M. Rehmann H.

Therefore, we reasoned that the analogous mutant RalAQ72L would be ideal bait for RalGAP. We prepared an affinity column immobilized with GST-RalAQ72L preloaded with GppNHp, a non-hydrolyzable GTP analogue, and searched for binding proteins in porcine brain cytosol. We observed 14 proteins eluting from the column with EDTA and GDP (Fig. 1A). Among them, we identified components of the exocyst complex, a known effector of Ral GTPases (5Brymora A. Valova V.A.

Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 73-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar), thus confirming the specificity of the affinity purification. We then separated the mixture of RalAQ72L-binding proteins by gel filtration chromatography and tested the fractions for RalGAP activity. Activity was monitored by incubating each fraction with [γ-32P]GTP-loaded RalA and measuring the decrease in radioactivity that remained bound to RalA. We detected a marked activity in fractions with an apparent molecular mass of >1000 kDa (Fig. 1B, fractions 18–20). Interestingly, proteins of 240 kDa (p240) and 170 kDa (p170) both co-fractionated with this activity (Fig. 1B, upper panel). As clearly seen in Fig. 1C, the activity in fraction 18 was highly specific for RalA and RalB among the Ras family GTPases tested. Moreover, the activity was indeed due to acceleration of GTP hydrolysis, but not to GTP dissociation, because [α-32P]GTP bound to RalA or RalB was specifically hydrolyzed to GDP after incubation with fraction 18, as analyzed by thin layer chromatography (Fig. 1D). These results indicated that fraction 18, which contained only p240 and p170, had GAP activity toward Ral GTPases. Mass spectrometry analysis revealed p240 to be the porcine orthologue of human GTPase-activating Rap/RanGAP domain-like 1 (GARNL1, also known as tuberin-like protein 1 or KIAA0884), the gene for which was identified as a candidate for 14q13-linked neurological disorders (32Schwarzbraun T. Vincent J.B. Schumacher A. Geschwind D.H. Oliveira J. Windpassinger C. Ofner L. Ledinegg M.K. Kroisel P.M. Wagner K. Petek E. Genomics. 2004; 84: 577-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). p170 was identified to be the porcine orthologue of human KIAA1219, an evolutionarily conserved protein of unknown function. We generated polyclonal antibodies against the two proteins and confirmed these results (data not shown). Because p240 and p170 co-migrated in the gel filtration (Fig. 1B), we tested whether the two proteins formed a complex. As shown in Fig. 1E, p240 and p170 were co-immunoprecipitated from porcine brain crude cytosol with either the anti-p240 or anti-p170 antibodies. Immunodepletion of p240 from fraction 18 with anti-p240 IgG-coated beads resulted in a concomitant depletion of p170 (Fig. 1F, left) and abolished the activity in the fraction (Fig. 1F, right). Thus, p240 and p170 form a stoichiometric complex that acts as RalGAP. The C-terminal ∼200-amino acid region of p240 shows a high degree of sequence identity to the catalytic domain of TSC2/tuberin (31% amino acid identity) and to a lesser extent that of Rap1GAP (24% identity) (supplementalFig. 1A). Apart from this region, p240 has no other discernible domains. TSC2 is a tumor suppressor protein that acts as a GAP toward Rheb (33Castro A.F. Rebhun J.F. Clark G.J. Quilliam L.A. J. Biol.

TSC2 functions in a complex with a non-catalytic subunit TSC1/hamartin. Loss of either TSC2 or TSC1 leads to constitutive activation of Rheb and causes the benign tumor syndrome tuberous sclerosis (38Crino P.B. Nathanson K.L. Henske E.P. N. Engl. J.

Notably, the p240-p170 complex has a similar domain organization as the TSC2-TSC1 complex (Fig. 1G), although there is no sequence similarity between p170 and TSC1. Next, we characterized the biochemical and catalytic properties of the complex using His6-tagged recombinant forms of human p240 and p170. We could purify the proteins at a nearly stoichiometric ratio from Sf9 insect cells co-infected with baculoviruses encoding each protein. Gel filtration analysis sho"

The signal transduction that follows ligand occupation of a GPCR is tightly regulated to limit the specificity and extent of cellular response. GPCR-mediated signal transduction is rapidly dampened via receptor desensitization or the waning of the responsiveness of the receptor to agonist with time. Desensitization involves receptor phosphorylation and is carried out by either GPCR kinases (GRKs) or second messenger-activated kinases such as protein kinase A and protein kinase C. Homologous desensitization involves GRKs that selectively phosphorylate only agonist-activated receptors, whereas heterologous desensitization is carried out by second messenger-dependent kinases that indiscriminately phosphorylate agonist-activated receptors and those that have not been exposed to the agonist (7Ferguson S.S. Pharmacol. Rev. 2001; 53: 1-24PubMed Google Scholar). The GRKs are serine/threonine protein kinases comprising seven isoforms that are grouped into three subfamilies. GRK1 and GRK7 belong to the rhodopsin kinase subfamily and are expressed exclusively in the retina (8Somers R.L. Klein D.C.

The D3R has a long third intracellular loop that contains several putative GRK phosphorylation sites (24Krueger K.M. Daaka Y. Pitcher J.A. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5-8Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). A previous study evaluated the ability of GRK2 and GRK3 to phosphorylate D3R and showed that co-transfection of GRK3, but not GRK2, resulted in a weak phosphorylation of the heterologously expressed, dopamine-stimulated D3R in HEK-293 (25Kim K.M.

Chem. 2001; 276: 37409-37414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar), a human embryonic kidney cell line. We tested the hypothesis that GRK4 is required in D3R signaling in terminally differentiated human renal proximal tubule cells (hPTCs) by determining the spatiotemporal dynamics of the interaction of D3R and GRK4 through their subfractionation in membrane microdomains and subcellular co-localization via confocal microscopy and bimolecular fluorescence complementation assay (BiFC). We also identified which of the GRK4 splice variants are involved in D3R phosphorylation and evaluated the physiological roles of GRK4 in D3R signaling in the hPTCs. We now report that D3R and GRK4 co-fractionate in lipid rafts and co-localize in both hPTCs and WYK kidneys. Moreover, D3R is phosphorylated by GRK4-γ and GRK4-α isoforms, and the absence of GRK4 impairs D3R-mediated mitogenesis and activation of p44/42 in hPTCs. The human wild-type GRK4 (α, Β, γ, and δ) splice variants were derived from in-house cDNA clones. Each cDNA was subcloned into the inducible mammalian expression vector, pcDNA4/TO (Invitrogen) for tetracycline-regulated expression in Chinese hamster ovary cells (T-REx CHO) (Invitrogen). The cloned inserts were completely sequenced. The expression of each GRK4 isoform was initially verified in HEK-293 cells via Western blot. pBiFC-YN155-bJun and pBiFC-YC155-bFos vectors (26Hu C.D.

Biotechnol. 2003; 21: 539-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar) were kind gifts of Dr. Tom K. Kerppola. The b-Jun and b-Fos sequences were removed from the vectors, and new multiple cloning sequences were inserted into both vectors to make new pBiFC vectors, designated as pBiFC-YN155 and pBiFC-YC155. The YN vector contains the N-terminal portion of EYFP (residues 1–155) and the YC vector contains the C-terminal portion (residues 156–241) of EYFP, both fused to the C terminus of the protein of interest. D3R cDNA was subcloned into the pBiFC-YN vector. GRK4γ was PCR-amplified and inserted into the pBiFC-YC vector, followed by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis to change the in-frame stop codon within the PmeI TAA to AAA to create GRK4γ-YC. The fidelity of the cloned inserts was verified by DNA sequencing, and their expression was evaluated by reverse transcription-PCR and immunoblotting. Immortalized hPTCs were obtained from normotensive Caucasian males. The cells were maintained in DMEM/F-12 (Invitrogen) with 10% fetal bovine serum, epidermal growth factor (10 ng/ml), insulin, transferrin and selenium mixture (5 μg/ml each), and dexamethasone (4 ng/μl) at 37 °C in an incubator with humidified 5% CO2 and 95% air. Cells with low passage numbers (<18) were used to avoid the confounding effects of cellular senescence. T-REx CHO cells (Invitrogen) were grown in DMEM/F-12 supplemented with 10% tetracycline-free fetal bovine serum and blasticidin (10 μg/ml; Invitrogen) to select for cells harboring the pcDNA6/TR plasmid. The cells were stably transfected with the various GRK4 isoforms using LipofectamineTM 2000 (Invitrogen), and double transfectants were selected with the addition of both Zeocin (100 μg/ml, Invitrogen) and blasticidin to the cell culture medium. The cell lines tested negative for Mycoplasma infection. There are no reports on the endogenous GRK4 expression in CHO cell lines; previous experiments on D1R desensitization in this cell line required the stable transfection of GRK4 (13Felder R.A.

To prepare lipid raft and non-lipid raft fractions, sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation was performed using a detergent-free protocol (28Song K.S. Li Shengwen Okamoto T. Quilliam L.A. Sargiacomo M.

One ml of the homogenate was diluted with 2 ml of 80% sucrose and overlaid with 6 ml of 35% sucrose and 3 ml of 5% sucrose, and spun at 160,000 × g in a Beckman SW40 rotor at 4 °C for 18 h. The sucrose solutions were prepared in MBS solution (25 mm MES, pH 6.7; 150 mm NaCl). After centrifugation, 12 1-ml fractions were collected and labeled 1 to 12 from top to bottom. Aliquots of each fraction were mixed with Laemmli buffer, boiled, and immunoblotted. Treatment with methyl-Β-cyclodextrin (MCD, a cholesterol depletor) for 30 min prior to the collection of the cells served as control. Total cell lysates were prepared using lysis buffer supplemented with protease inhibitors. Uniform amounts of protein (measured using the BCA kit, Pierce) were prepared using Laemmli loading buffer, resolved in 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was blocked and sequentially probed with the primary antibody and the corresponding secondary antibody. Chemiluminescence detection was carried out using SuperSignal West Dura Substrate (Pierce) followed by autoradiography. hPTCs were grown on poly-d-lysine-coated coverslips to 50% confluence and treated with the D3R agonist PD128907 (1 μm) at the indicated time points. The cells were washed three times with ice-cold PBS, and the cell membrane was labeled with the cell-impermeant EZ-link sulfo-NHS-SS-Biotin (Pierce) for 30 min on ice and then washed with ice-cold PBS supplemented with 10 mm glycine (pH 7.0) to remove the excess biotin. The cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.05% Triton X-100 for 10 min, double-immunostained for D3R and GRK4 using monoclonal anti-D3R antibody (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) and rabbit polyclonal anti-GRK4 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 1 h, and re-probed with goat anti-mouse (H+L)-Alexa 555 and goat anti-rabbit (H+L)-Alexa 633 (Molecular Probes) secondary antibodies. The membranes were re-probed with Cy3-conjugated avidin for 10 min. The coverslips were mounted on glass slides using hard-set Vectashield mounting medium. Four-μm-thick sections of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded WKY rat kidneys were prepared and mounted on slides. After deparaffination, rehydration, permeabilization, and antigen retrieval, the sections were double-immunostained with monoclonal anti-D3R antibody (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) and rabbit polyclonal anti-GRK4 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The tissues were probed with goat anti-mouse (H+L)-Alexa 488 and goat anti-rabbit (H+L)-Alexa 568 (Molecular Probes) secondary antibodies and mounted using Vectashield mounting medium. Negative controls were likewise prepared by omitting the primary antibodies. Co-localization of endogenous D3R and GRK4 in both hPTCs and WKY rat kidney sections was evaluated by laser scanning confocal microscopy using an Olympus IX-70 inverted microscope equipped with a 60X/1.4 NA oil immersion objective at the Microscopy and Imaging Shared Resource of the Lombardi Cancer Center, Georgetown University. Serum-starved hPTCs were treated with PD128907 or PBS as control, and the cell lysates were prepared using RIPA lysis buffer. Equal amounts of cell lysates (500 μg of protein) were mixed with monoclonal anti-D3R (Zymed Laboratories Inc.), or normal mouse IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) as negative control, or polyclonal anti-GRK4 (Abgent) as positive control. The immune complexes were pelleted out, and the bound proteins were eluted using 30 μl of Laemmli buffer. The samples were subjected to immunoblotting and probed for GRK4 using a polyclonal anti-GRK4 antibody (Abgent). Only a quarter of the eluate for the positive control was run alongside the test samples to avoid oversaturation of the band during x-ray radiography. The ability of D3R to co-immunoprecipitate with the two other members of the GRK4 subfamily, i.e. GRK5 and GRK6, was also evaluated by probing for these proteins using specific anti-GRK5 and anti-GRK6 polyclonal antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). pBiFC-GRK4γ-YC and pBiFC-D3R-YN were co-transfected into hPTCs grown on coverslips using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science). Untransfected cells were also prepared as negative controls. The cells were incubated at 37 °C for 24 h and at 32 °C for 16 h to allow the maturation of the fluorophore. The cells were serum-starved prior to D3R stimulation with PD128907 (1 μm) at the indicated time points. The cell membrane was labeled with the cell-impermeant EZ-link sulfo-NHS-SS-Biotin for 30 min on ice and then washed with ice-cold 10 mm glycine (pH 7.0) in PBS. The cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with 0.05% Triton X-100 in PBS. The cells were probed with Cy3-conjugated avidin and mounted on glass slides using Vectashield mounting medium containing the nuclear stain DAPI. Confocal images were obtained with an Olympus IX-70 laser scanning confocal microscope with a Plan Apo 60X/1.4 NA oil immersion objective. To determine the extent of protein-protein interaction, i.e. BiFC formation in the hPTCs, the mean fluorescence intensity was quantified using the Scion Image software (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda). T-REx CHO cells stably transfected with the various GRK4 isoforms were grown to 60% confluence and then transiently transfected with full-length human D3R subcloned into pcDNA4/myc, His using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent to express His-tagged D3R. The cells were treated with the tetracycline analog, doxycycline, for 24 h to induce the expression of the GRK4 splice variants. The culture medium was replaced with phosphate-free DMEM (Invitrogen) containing doxycycline for 1 h and replaced anew with fresh phosphate-free DMEM with doxycycline and 106 μCi of [32P]H3PO4, and the cells were returned to the incubator for another 90 min. The cells were stimulated with PD128907 (1 μm, 30 min) or with PBS as control. Thereafter, the cell lysates were prepared using RIPA buffer supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitors (Sigma). His-tagged D3R was pulled down from lysates with uniform amounts of total protein (500 μg) using the MagneHisTM protein purification system (Promega). In a separate set of experiments, aliquots of the lysates were resolved by SDS-PAGE and probed for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase to confirm the uniformity of protein concentration. Copious washing was done to minimize residual nonspecific 32P radioactivity. His pulldown assay was used in lieu of immunoprecipitation with a D3R-specific antibody to avoid the possible confounding effect of the heavy chain of the immunoprecipitant, which has approximately the same molecular size as D3R (∼50 kDa). The eluates were mixed with Laemmli buffer, resolved in 10% SDS-PAGE, and subjected to autoradiography for 24–48 h. T-REx CHO cells stably transfected with the pcDNA4/TO vector without insert and transiently transfected with pcDNA4/myc, His-hD3R plasmid were used as negative control. The proteins were transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane after 48 h and then probed for D3R-His using an anti-His monoclonal antibody. D3R-mediated mitogenesis of hPTCs was assessed using the Delfia cell cytotoxicity kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Approximately 1 × 104 hPTCs were seeded into a 96-well IsoplateTM (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and grown in complete media. Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd, 10 μm), a thymidine analog, was added to the medium 24 h prior to the end of the assay. To determine the extent of mitogenesis after 18 h of D3R stimulation, the cells were fixed, the DNA was denatured, and the amount of incorporated BrdUrd was determined using a europium-labeled monoclonal anti-BrdUrd antibody. Unbound antibody was washed off, and an inducer buffer was added into each well to dissociate the europium from the antibody, resulting in highly fluorescent chelates. The europium fluorescent signal was then determined by time-resolved fluorometry (with a 400-μs window time and delay) using a Victor3 multilabel reader. The same number of hPTCs cells was seeded on a separate 96-well IsoplateTM and grown overnight before fixation with 4% paraformaldehyde and nuclear staining with DAPI. The DAPI fluorescence was detected using a Victor3 multilabel reader. The results are reported as europium fluorescence normalized to that of DAPI. GRK function was inhibited by transfecting heparin (1 μm/24 h; Sigma), a nonspecific GRK inhibitor (30Benovic J.L. Stone W.C. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 6707-6710Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), into the hPTCs using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent. In additional studies, GRK4 expression was silenced via GRK4-specific siRNA (5 nm/72 h; Qiagen) transfected into the cells using Hyperfect transfection reagent (Qiagen). Nonsilencing “mock” siRNA (Qiagen) was also transfected into cells as negative control. Untransfected cells served as an additional control. The extent of inhibition of GRK4 expression in the cells was evaluated by reverse transcription-PCR and immunoblotting. The GRK4 mRNA expression was evaluated using GGAGGAGGTCGATCAAAGAA (sense) and AGACACACCCGGTAGCAAAC (antisense), resulting in a 343-bp product. For normalization, Β-actin mRNA expression was also evaluated using AGAAAATCTGGCACCACACC (sense) and CTCCTTAATGTCACGCACGA (antisense), resulting in a 388-bp product. Serum-starved hPTCs grown to 90% confluence were treated with PD128907 (1 μm) at the indicated time points to determine the phosphorylation state of the p44/42 MAP kinases. Total cell lysates were prepared in the presence of a mixture of protease and phosphatase inhibitors (Sigma) and then immunoblotted for phosphorylated p44/42 (Cell Signaling) and for a panel of phosphorylated proteins (Cell Signaling) thereafter. Numerical data are expressed as means ± S.E. Significant difference between two groups was determined by Student’s t test, whereas that among three or more groups was determined by one-way ANOVA followed by Holm-Sidak or Dunnett’s post hoc test, as indicated. p < 0.05 was considered significant. Statistical analysis was performed using SigmaStat 3.5 (SPSS Inc., Chicago). In the plasma membrane, distinct islands of lipids and proteins collectively known as lipid rafts exist to spatially concentrate functionally related sets of proteins to facilitate and augment their interaction, thereby enhancing the efficiency and specificity of their signal transduction. To evaluate the subfractionation of endogenous D3R and GRK4 in lipid rafts, sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation was performed. Both D3R and GRK4 were found in non-lipid raft fractions (fractions 7–12) and in lipid raft fractions (fractions 1–6), as denoted by the abundance of the lipid raft marker, caveolin-1 (Fig. 1). Estimation of total proteins found in these microdomains revealed that >90% are found in non-lipid rafts, and <10% are found in lipid rafts (31Han W. Li H. Villar V.A. Pascua A.M. Dajani M.I. Wang X. Natarajan A. Quinn M.T. Felder R.A. Jose P.A. Yu P. Hypertension. 2008; 51: 481-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Treatment with MCD, a cholesterol-depleting reagent, resulted in the disruption of the cholesterol-enriched lipid rafts and the re-distribution of caveolin-1, D3R, and GRK4 to the non-lipid rafts. In hPTCs, endogenously expressed D3R was both membrane-bound and scattered in the cytoplasm under basal conditions, suggesting basal turnover of the receptors (Fig. 2A). D3R stimulation resulted in the rapid internalization and sequestration of the receptors at the perinuclear area (5 and 15 min), followed by the dispersal of the receptors to the membrane (30 min). GRK4 was distributed both at the surface membrane and dispersed in the cytoplasm under basal conditions. D3R stimulation resulted in the internalization of GRK4 to the perinuclear area, where co-localization with D3R was observed strongly at 5 and 15 min of agonist treatment. The in vivo correlation of the D3R and GRK4 co-localization was evaluated in paraffin sections of WKY rat kidney (Fig. 2B). GRK4 was strongly expressed in the proximal tubules (S1 and S3 segments), the distal convoluted tubules, and the glomeruli. On the other hand, D3R was predominantly expressed in the proximal tubules (S1 and S3 segments) and distal convoluted tubules, in agreement with previous reports (32O’Connell D.P. Vaughan C.J.

The segments that showed the strongest co-localization signal were the proximal and distal tubules. To determine the physical interaction between the two proteins, total cell lysates were immunoprecipitated using a monoclonal anti-D3R antibody, and the eluate was immunoblotted for GRK4. An ∼55-kDa band was visualized (Fig. 3A), which corresponded to GRK4 because a similar band was obtained when the lysate was immunoprecipitated with a polyclonal anti-GRK4 antibody. Minimal co-immunoprecipitation was observed when a pool of normal mouse IgGs was used as immunoprecipitant. There was no difference in the extent of co-immunoprecipitation between D3R and GRK4 under basal conditions and after treatment with a D3R agonist. D3R failed to immunoprecipitate both G"

Using methyl-β-cyclodextrin (MβCD) to deplete membrane cholesterol, many G protein-coupled receptors have been shown to depend on putative lipid rafts for proper signaling. Here we examine the hypothesis that treatment of HEK293 cells stably expressing FLAG-tagged μ-opioid receptors (HEK FLAG-μ) or δ-opioid receptors (HEK FLAG-δ) with MβCD will reduce opioid receptor signaling to adenylyl cyclase. The ability of the μ-opioid agonist [d-Ala2,N-Me-Phe4,Gly5-ol]enkephalin to acutely inhibit adenylyl cyclase or to cause sensitization of adenylyl cyclase following chronic treatment was attenuated with MβCD. These effects were due to removal of cholesterol, because replenishment of cholesterol restored [d-Ala2,N-Me-Phe4,Gly5-ol]enkephalin responses back to control values, and were confirmed in SH-SY5Y cells endogenously expressing μ-opioid receptors. The effects of MβCD may be due to uncoupling of the μ receptor from G proteins but were not because of decreases in receptor number and were not mimicked by cytoskeleton disruption. In contrast to the results in HEK FLAG-μ cells, MβCD treatment of HEK FLAG-δ cells had no effect on acute inhibition or sensitization of adenylyl cyclase by δ-opioid agonists. The differential responses of μ- and δ-opioid agonists to cholesterol depletion suggest that μ-opioid receptors are more dependent on cholesterol for efficient signaling than δ receptors and can be partly explained by localization of μ- but not δ-opioid receptors in cholesterol- and caveolin-enriched membrane domains.

Membrane cholesterol can alter the function of integral proteins, such as G protein-coupled receptors, through cholesterol-protein interactions and by changes in membrane viscosity (1Gimpl G. Burger K. Fahrenholz F. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10959-10974Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). In addition, cholesterol interacts with other lipids found in the bilayer, particularly sphingolipids (2Slotte J.P. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1999; 102: 13-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), which allows for tight and organized packing that can precipitate the formation of specialized domains within the plasma membrane (3Simons K. Ikonen E. Nature. 1997; 387: 569-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (8117) Google Scholar). These domains have become an area of intense research interest and have been termed lipid or membrane rafts (4Pike L.J. J. Lipid Res. 2006; 47: 1597-1598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1135) Google Scholar). The study of membrane rafts in intact cells is controversial, due in part to the limitations of the current methods used to study rafts (5Munro S. Cell. 2003; 115: 377-388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1329) Google Scholar, 6Shogomori H. Brown D.A. Biol. Chem. 2003; 384: 1259-1263Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Regardless, the membrane environment formed in regions of high cholesterol and sphingolipids may be such that certain proteins have an affinity for these regions, especially proteins with a propensity to interact with cholesterol. Many G protein-coupled receptors and signaling proteins have been found to prefer cholesterol-enriched domains leading to the hypothesis that these domains can organize signaling molecules in the membrane to enhance or inhibit specific signaling events (7Allen J.A.

Activated opioid receptors couple to Gαi/o proteins and acutely inhibit the activity of adenylyl cyclase. Longer term exposure to opioid agonists causes sensitization of adenylyl cyclase and a rebound overshoot of cAMP production upon withdrawal of the agonist (21Watts V.J. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2002; 302: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Consequently, we sought to assess the role of cholesterol depletion on the ability of μ- and δ-opioid receptor agonists to inhibit and cause sensitization of adenylyl cyclase. There are conflicting data for the effect of changes in membrane cholesterol on opioid signaling. For example, an increase in plasma membrane microviscosity by addition of cholesteryl hemisuccinate to SH-SY5Y cell membranes increased μ-opioid receptor coupling to G proteins (22Emmerson P.J. Clark M.J. Medzihradsky F. Remmers A.E. J. Neurochem. 1999; 73: 289-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Conversely, removal of membrane cholesterol from Chinese hamster ovary cells has been shown to either decrease (23Gaibelet G. Millot C. Lebrun C. Ravault S. Sauliere A. Andre A. Lagane B. Lopez A.

Furthermore, the effect of cholesterol removal on δ-opioid agonist-stimulated [35S]GTPγS binding varies by cell type (10Huang P. Xu W. Yoon S.I. Chen C. Chong P.L. Liu-Chen L.Y. Biochem.

In these previous studies, the variety of cell types utilized and the conflicting results make comparisons between opioid receptor types difficult. The objective of this study was to directly compare the role of membrane cholesterol in modulating acute and chronic μ- and δ-opioid signaling in the same cell systems using identical methods, including the following: 1) depletion of cholesterol by the cholesterol-sequestering agent methyl-β-cyclodextrin (MβCD); 2) separation of cholesterol-enriched membranes by sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation; and 3) clustering of lipid raft patches in whole cells with cholera toxin B subunit. guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate (+)-4-[(αR)-α-((2S,5R)-4-allyl-2,5-dimethyl-1-piperazinyl)-3-methoxybenzyl]-N,N-diethylbenzamide [d-Pen2,5]-enkephalin [d-Ala2,N-Me-Phe4,Gly5-ol]enkephalin diprenorphine d-Phe-[Cys-Tyr-d-Trp-Arg-Thr-Pen]Thr-NH2 methyl-β-cyclodextrin cholera toxin B subunit adenylyl cyclase transferrin receptor analysis of variance human embryonic kidney; FLAG epitope (DYKDDDDK) HEK cells stably expressing FLAG-δreceptor HEK cells stably expressing FLAG-μreceptor Dulbecco舗s modified Eagle舗s medium fetal bovine serum MES-buffered saline 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid phosphate-buffered saline. In initial experiments using human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells heterologously expressing μ- or δ-opioid receptors, we found that δ-opioid receptors were located in caveolin-poor fractions following 1% Triton X-100 homogenization and sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation. This differs from studies using a detergent-free method to identify lipid raft fractions (10Huang P. Xu W. Yoon S.I. Chen C. Chong P.L. Liu-Chen L.Y. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2007; 73: 534-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 11Patel H.H. Head B.P. Petersen H.N. Niesman I.R. Huang D. Gross G.J. Insel P.A. Roth D.M. Am. J. Physiol. Heart Circ. Physiol. 2006; 291: H344-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). In contrast, we found that the μ-opioid receptor was found in both caveolin-poor and caveolin-rich fractions, in accordance with previous literature (8Head B.P. Patel H.H. Roth D.M. Lai N.C. Niesman I.R. Farquhar M.G. Insel P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 31036-31044Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 9Zhao H. Loh H. Law P. Mol. Pharmacol. 2006; 69: 1421-1432Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). This differential localization of opioid receptors led us to test the hypothesis that, in contrast to the μ-opioid receptor, the δ-opioid receptor would not be dependent on cholesterol for signaling. The results show that μ- but not δ-opioid receptors have a dependence on cholesterol for signaling to adenylyl cyclase and that this effect is much more pronounced following chronic exposure to opioids. SNC80 ((+)-4-[(αR)-α-((2S,5R)-4-allyl-2,5-dimethyl-1-piperazinyl)-3-methoxybenzyl]-N,N-diethylbenzamide), DPDPE ([d-Pen2,5]-enkephalin), and naltrindole hydrochloride were obtained from the Narcotic Drug and Opioid Peptide Basic Research Center at the University of Michigan (Ann Arbor, MI). Lovastatin hydroxy acid was obtained from Cayman Chemical (Ann Arbor, MI). [3H]Diprenorphine, [3H]DAMGO ([d-Ala2,N-Me-Phe4,Gly5-ol]enkephalin), and [35S]GTPγS were obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Tissue culture media, geneticin, fetal bovine serum, and trypsin were from Invitrogen. All other chemicals were obtained from Sigma unless otherwise stated. Human embryonic kidney 293 cells stably transfected with the N-terminal FLAG-tagged δ- (HEK FLAG-δ) or μ-opioid receptor (HEK FLAG-μ) were grown in Dulbecco舗s modified Eagle舗s medium (DMEM) containing 0.8 mg/ml geneticin and 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Receptor expression in HEK FLAG-δ cells (8.4 ± 1.5 pmol/mg protein; n = 5) and HEK FLAG-μ cells (9.7 ± 1.3 pmol/mg protein; n = 5) was similar (p > 0.05). Receptor expression was measured by saturation binding of the opioid antagonist [3H]diprenorphine as described previously (22Emmerson P.J. Clark M.J. Medzihradsky F. Remmers A.E. J. Neurochem. 1999; 73: 289-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). SH-SY5Y cells were grown as above but without geneticin. SH-SY5Y cells were differentiated by adding 10 μm retinoic acid (Calbiochem) 3–5 days prior to assay. HEK FLAG-μ or HEK FLAG-δ cells were grown to confluence in DMEM + 10% FBS. Media were replaced with serum-free DMEM with or without 2% (15 mm) MβCD (Sigma) for 1 h at 37 °C. SH-SY5Y cells were treated with 5 mm MβCD for 10 min. For cholesterol replenishment, cells were incubated with or without a 2% MβCD-cholesterol complex (MβCD-CH) in serum-free DMEM for 2 h following cholesterol depletion. MβCD-cholesterol complexes were formed in an 8:1 molar ratio as described previously (26Christian A.E. Haynes M.P. Phillips M.C. Rothblat G.H. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 2264-2272Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cholesterol was dissolved in a 1:1 ratio by volume of chloroform/methanol in a glass tube. Following evaporation of the solvent, the dried cholesterol was reconstituted with a suitable volume of serum-free DMEM containing 2% MβCD, vortexed, sonicated for 30 s, and incubated overnight at 37 °C with shaking. For lovastatin experiments, cells were treated with serum-free Opti-MEM containing 10 μm lovastatin hydroxy acid or DMSO vehicle for 48 h. Cholesterol content from cell lysates was determined using the Amplex Red cholesterol assay kit (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer舗s instructions. Cholesterol content was normalized to protein content, as determined by the method of Bradford (27Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216440) Google Scholar). Membranes were prepared from HEK FLAG-δ or FLAG-μ cells following treatment with or without 2% MβCD as described previously (28Clark M.J. Harrison C. Zhong H. Neubig R.R. Traynor J.R. J. Biol.

Protein concentration was measured using the Bradford assay (27Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216440) Google Scholar). Membranes (30 μg of protein) were incubated with 0.1 nm [35S]GTPγS for 60 min at 25 °C with or without various concentrations of the δ-opioid agonist SNC80 or the μ-opioid agonist DAMGO in [35S]GTPγS binding buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mm MgCl2, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 30 μm GDP). Membranes with bound [35S]GTPγS were collected on GF/C filters (Whatman) using a Brandel harvester (MLR-24, Gaithersburg, MD) and rinsed three times with cold wash buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mm MgCl2, 100 mm NaCl). Dried filters were saturated with EcoLume liquid scintillation mixture (MP Biomedicals, Solon, OH), and radioactivity was counted in a Wallec 1450 MicroBeta (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Inhibition of adenylyl cyclase activity was measured in HEK FLAG-δ or FLAG-μ cells grown to confluence in 24-well poly-d-lysine-coated plates. Cells were washed with serum-free DMEM and incubated with various concentrations of the δ-opioid agonist SNC80 or the μ-opioid agonist DAMGO in the presence of 5 μm forskolin and 1 mm 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine in serum-free media for 10 min at 37 °C. The assay was stopped by replacing the media with 1 ml of ice-cold 3% perchloric acid. After at least 30 min at 4 °C, a 400-μl aliquot of sample was neutralized with 2.5 m KHCO3 and centrifuged at 13,000 × g. Cyclic AMP was measured from the supernatant using a [3H]cAMP assay system (GE Healthcare) following the manufacturer舗s instructions. Inhibition of cAMP formation was calculated as a percent of forskolin-stimulated cAMP accumulation in the absence of opioid agonist. For adenylyl cyclase sensitization experiments, HEK cells were rinsed with serum-free DMEM and incubated in the presence or absence of SNC80, DPDPE, or DAMGO in serum-free DMEM for 30 min at 37 °C. SH-SY5Y cells, plated in uncoated 24-well plates (5 × 105 cells/well) and differentiated with 10 μm retinoic acid for 3–5 days prior to sensitization experiments, were incubated in the presence or absence of 1 μm DAMGO for 60 min at 37 °C. The drug-containing media were then removed and replaced with serum-free media containing 5 μm forskolin, 1 mm 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, and 10 μm of the opioid antagonist naloxone for HEK FLAG-μ cells and SH-SY5Y cells, or 10 μm of the δ-opioid antagonist naltrindole for HEK FLAG-δ cells, to precipitate cAMP overshoot. After 10 min at 37 °C, the assay was stopped with ice-cold 3% perchloric acid, and cAMP accumulation was quantified as described above. Overshoot was calculated as a percent of forskolin-stimulated cAMP accumulation in the absence of opioid agonist. In competition binding assays, membranes (5–12 μg of protein) from HEK FLAG-μ or -δ cells treated with or without 2% MβCD were incubated for 1 h with shaking at 25 °C with 0.2 nm [3H]diprenorphine and increasing concentrations of unlabeled ligand (DAMGO or SNC80) in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4. Where indicated, a final concentration of 10 μm GTPγS and 100 mm NaCl was added to the incubation buffer. For saturation binding assays, membranes (20 μg of protein) from low expressing HEK FLAG-μ cells (1.6 ± 0.1 pmol/mg protein) were incubated with increasing concentrations of [3H]diprenorphine (0.08–5 nm) or [3H]DAMGO (0.06–12 nm) in 50 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.4, for 1 h with shaking at 25 °C. For whole cell binding, HEK FLAG-μ cells (1 × 105 cells/tube) were incubated for 1 h in a 37 °C shaking water bath with 4 nm [3H]diprenorphine ± 10 μm CTAP (d-Phe-Cys-Tyr-d-Trp-Arg-Thr-Pen-Thr-NH2) in serum-free DMEM. Protein content from a representative aliquot was determined by the method of Bradford (27Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216440) Google Scholar). For all binding assays, nonspecific binding was determined using 10 μm naloxone. All assays were stopped by rapid filtration through GF/C filters using a Brandel harvester (MLR-24, Gaithersburg, MD) and rinsed three times with ice-cold 50 mm Tris-HCl wash buffer, pH 7.4. Bound radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation counting as described above. HEK FLAG-δ or FLAG-μ cells were grown to confluence in 10-cm2 dishes, washed, and resuspended in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Cells were pelleted and homogenized with a Dounce homogenizer in 100 μl of MES-buffered saline (MBS) containing 1% Triton X-100. The homogenate was placed on the bottom of a 2.2-ml ultracentrifuge tube, adjusted to 40% by addition of 53.3% sucrose in MBS, and overlaid with 900 μl of 30% sucrose and 900 μl of 5% sucrose in MBS for a discontinuous gradient. The samples were centrifuged at 200,000 × g in a Beckman-Coulter (Fullerton, CA) Optima Max-E Ultracentrifuge using a swinging bucket rotor (TLS-55) for 16–24 h at 4 °C. Equal volume (183 μl) fractions were collected from the top. Equal volume aliquots were taken from each fraction, mixed with sample buffer (63 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 0.008% bromphenol blue, 50 mm dithiothreitol), separated by SDS-PAGE on a 10% polyacrylamide gel, and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Pierce) for Western blotting. Antibodies used were monoclonal anti-FLAG M1 (1:2000; Sigma), polyclonal anti-caveolin (1:2000; BD Transduction Laboratories), and monoclonal anti-human TfR (1:2000; Zymed Laboratories Inc.). Secondary antibodies used were goat anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase or goat anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase (1:10,000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). The above antibodies were diluted in 5% milk in Tris-buffered saline, 0.05% Tween 20 (+1 mm CaCl2 for FLAG M1 antibody). SuperSignal West Pico chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce) was used to detect immunoreactivity. For detection of adenylyl cyclase (AC) 5/6, samples were separated on a 6% polyacrylamide gel and transferred to an Immobilon-P polyvinylidene fluoride membrane (Millipore, Billerica, MA). AC 5/6 was detected by rabbit anti-AC 5/6 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) diluted 1:200 in 1% bovine serum albumin in Tris-buffered saline, 0.05% Tween 20. HEK FLAG-δ or HEK FLAG-μ cells were plated on poly-d-lysine-coated coverslips in a 6-well plate (1 × 106 cells/well) 24 h prior to patching. Cells were incubated with AlexaFluor 488-conjugated cholera toxin B subunit (1 μg/μl in DMEM, 10% goat serum; Invitrogen) for 45 min at 4 °C to label endogenous ganglioside GM1. Lipid raft aggregation, or patching, was induced as described by Fra et al. (29Fra A.M. Williamson E. Simons K. Parton R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30745-30748Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) by incubating with goat anti-CTB antibody (1:250 in DMEM, 10% goat serum; Calbiochem) for 30 min at 4 °C, followed by 20 min at 37 °C. Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min and incubated in monoclonal anti-FLAG M1 antibody (1:1000 in PBS, 5% milk; Sigma) for 1 h followed by AlexaFluor 594-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody (1:1000 in PBS, 5% milk; Invitrogen) to stain the FLAG-tagged μ- or δ-opioid receptor. For TfR and caveolin staining, cells were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 10 min and incubated with monoclonal anti-TfR antibody (1:200 in PBS, 5% milk; Zymed Laboratories Inc.) or polyclonal anti-caveolin antibody (1:200 in PBS, 5% milk; BD Transduction Laboratories). Coverslips were mounted on slides using ProLong Gold (Invitrogen). Fluorescent images of 0.5-μm Z planes were captured using an Olympus FV-500 confocal microscope. Quantification of colocalization was performed using the RG2B colocalization plug-in to ImageJ (version rsb.info.nih.gov). The minimum threshold pixel intensity was set to 50 for both channels, and the minimum ratio for pixel intensity between the channels was 50%. Colocalization pixels from individual Z planes were displayed as a stack of Z projections with maximum pixel intensity. Colocalization was reported as the average pixel density of colocalized pixels per cell. All data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism 4 software (San Diego, CA). All data points represent at least three separate experiments in duplicate and are presented as means ± S.E., unless otherwise noted. The effect of treatment on agonist responses at various concentrations was analyzed by two-way ANOVA with Bonferroni舗s post hoc test. EC50 values were calculated from individual concentration-effect curves using the fixed slope sigmoidal dose-response curve fit analysis in GraphPad Prism. Ki and Bmax/Kd values were calculated from individual binding experiments using one- or two-site competition or one-site hyperbola binding curve fit linear regression analysis, respectively. EC50, Ki, Bmax, and Kd values are expressed as mean ± S.E. and compared for statistical significance by unpaired, two-tailed Student舗s t test. Cholesterol repletion experiments were compared using one-way ANOVA with Bonferroni舗s post hoc test. All other statistical comparisons were made with unpaired, two-tailed Student舗s t test, unless otherwise indicated. For all tests significance was set at p < 0.05. HEK293 cells stably expressing either the FLAG-μ or FLAG-δ opioid receptor were treated with the cholesterol-sequestering agent MβCD (2%) for 1 h at 37 °C. This reduced cholesterol to 40 ± 5.6% of control, consistent with previously published results of 35–55% reductions (12Xu W. Yoon S.I. Huang P. Wang Y. Chen C. Chong P.L. Liu-Chen L.Y. J. Pharmacol.

Therefore, we used this pharmacological tool to directly compare the effects of cholesterol depletion on μ- and δ-opioid receptor signaling. Agonist-activated opioid receptors couple to Gαi/o proteins and induce the exchange of GTP for GDP, which can be measured by the increase in binding of the guanine nucleotide analog [35S]GTPγS. Basal levels of [35S]GTPγS binding were similar in membranes from untransfected HEK293 cells and HEK cells expressing μ-opioid receptors but were higher in membranes from cells expressing δ-opioid receptors (Fig. 1A), which are thought to be tightly coupled to G proteins and show constitutive activity (32Costa T. Klinz F.J. Vachon L. Herz A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1988; 34: 744-754PubMed Google Scholar). Treatment of either HEK FLAG-μ cells or untransfected HEK293 cells with 2% MβCD for 1 h reduced basal [35S]GTPγS binding by 38 ± 5.5 or 39 ± 2.2%, respectively (Fig. 1A), suggesting an opioid receptor-independent effect. In contrast, treatment of HEK FLAG-δ cells with MβCD reduced basal levels of [35S]GTPγS binding by 61 ± 1.7%. However, the δ-opioid inverse agonist RTI-5989-25 (33Zaki P.A. Keith Jr., D.E. Thomas J.B. Carroll F.I. Evans C.J. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2001; 298: 1015-1020PubMed Google Scholar) was able to reduce [35S]GTPγS binding by 18 ± 3.8% in control HEK FLAG-δ cells (data not shown). Therefore, in HEK FLAG-δ cells approximately one-third of the decrease in basal [35S]GTPγS binding caused by MβCD may be due to a loss of constitutively active receptors. The remaining decrease, which is similar to the decrease in HEK FLAG-μ or untransfected HEK293 cells, is likely because of a reduction in available, unoccupied Gα proteins themselves or a loss of constitutive activity of other G protein-coupled receptors endogenous to HEK293 cells. Because of this decrease in basal [35S]GTPγS binding, data were graphed as femtomoles of agonist-stimulated [35S]GTPγS bound/mg of protein rather than as percent change over basal, as has been reported previously (10Huang P.

https://openalex.org/W2062226032,"Background Replication origins fire at different times during S-phase. Such timing is determined by the chromosomal context, which includes the activity of nearby genes, telomeric position effects and chromatin structure, such as the acetylation state of the surrounding chromatin. Activation of replication origins involves the conversion of a pre-replicative complex to a replicative complex. A pivotal step during this conversion is the binding of the replication factor Cdc45, which associates with replication origins at approximately their time of activation in a manner partially controlled by histone acetylation. Methodology/Principal Findings Here we identify histone H3 K36 methylation (H3 K36me) by Set2 as a novel regulator of the time of Cdc45 association with replication origins. Deletion of SET2 abolishes all forms of H3 K36 methylation. This causes a delay in Cdc45 binding to origins and renders the dynamics of this interaction insensitive to the state of histone acetylation of the surrounding chromosomal region. Furthermore, a decrease in H3 K36me3 and a concomitant increase in H3 K36me1 around the time of Cdc45 binding to replication origins suggests opposing functions for these two methylation states. Indeed, we find K36me3 depleted from early firing origins when compared to late origins genomewide, supporting a delaying effect of this histone modification for the association of replication factors with origins. Conclusions/Significance We propose a model in which K36me1 together with histone acetylation advance, while K36me3 and histone deacetylation delay, the time of Cdc45 association with replication origins. The involvement of the transcriptionally induced H3 K36 methylation mark in regulating the timing of Cdc45 binding to replication origins provides a novel means of how gene expression may affect origin dynamics during S-phase."
https://openalex.org/W1974997159,"Some people remain lean despite pressure to gain weight. Lean people tend to have high daily activity levels, but the source of this increased activity is unknown. We found that leanness cannot be accounted for by increased weight-corrected food intake in two different types of lean rats. As previously reported in lean people, we found that lean rats had higher daily activity levels; lean rats also expended more energy. These lean rats were developed through artificial selection for high aerobic endurance capacity. To test whether our findings extended to a human population, we measured endurance capacity using a VO2max treadmill test and daily activity in a group of non-exercising individuals. Similar to lean rats selectively bred for endurance capacity, our study revealed that people with higher VO2max also spent more time active throughout the day. Hence, endurance capacity may be the trait that underlies both physical activity levels and leanness. We identified one potential mechanism for the lean, active phenotype in rats, namely high levels of skeletal muscle PEPCK. Therefore, the lean phenotype is characterized by high endurance capacity and high activity and may stem from altered skeletal muscle energetics."
https://openalex.org/W2081411566,"The poliovirus protein 2C plays an essential role in viral RNA replication, although its precise biochemical activities or structural requirements have not been elucidated. The protein has several distinctive properties, including ATPase activity and membrane and RNA binding, that are conserved among orthologs of many positive-strand RNA viruses. Sequence alignments have placed these proteins in the SF3 helicase family, a subset of the AAA+ ATPase superfamily. A feature common to AAA+ proteins is the formation of oligomeric rings that are essential for their catalytic functions. Here we show that a recombinant protein, MBP-2C, in which maltose-binding protein was fused to 2C, formed soluble oligomers and that ATPase activity was restricted to oligomer-containing fractions from gel-filtration chromatography. The active fraction was visualized by negative-staining electron microscopy as ring-like particles composed of 5-8 protomers. This conclusion was confirmed by mass measurements obtained by scanning transmission electron microscopy. Mutation of amino acid residues in the 2C nucleotide-binding domain demonstrated that loss of the ability to bind or hydrolyze ATP did not affect oligomerization. Co-expression of active MBP-2C and inactive mutant proteins generated mixed oligomers that exhibited little ATPase activity, suggesting that incorporation of inactive subunits eliminates the function of the entire particle. Finally, deletion of the N-terminal 38 amino acids blocked oligomerization of the fusion protein and eliminated ATPase activity, despite retention of an unaltered nucleotide-binding domain."

Potentially beneficial effects of EPA consumption have been supported by a variety of epidemiological and interventional studies. EPA competes with AA for access to the cyclooxygenase enzymes (21.Wada M. DeLong C.J. Hong Y.H. Rieke C.J. Song I. Sidhu R.S. Yuan C. Warnock M. Schmaier A.H. Yokoyama C. Smyth E.M. Wilson S.J.

This effect and/or substituted formation of EPA-derived PGs may explain the anti-inflammatory and cardioprotective effects ascribed to fish oils. The relatively unsaturated EPA and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) in fatty fish are likely to be more susceptible to lipid peroxidation than AA, although it is unknown whether this might constrain beneficial effects derived from a shift in substrate-dependent enzymatic product formation. While F2-iPs and F3-iPs are excreted into urine in their original form, the F4-iPs formed from DHA (Fig. 1) are at least partly metabolized to F3-iPs before excretion (20.Chang C.T. Patel P. Kang N.

Synthetic 5-epi-8,12-iso-iPF3α-VI and 8,12-iso-iPF3α-VI were synthesized as previously described (20.Chang C.T. Patel P. Kang N. Lawson J.A. Song W.L. Powell W.S. Fitzgerald G.A. Rokach J.

Stereospecific synthesis of deuterated standards, d4-5-epi-8,12-iso-iPF3α-VI and d4-8,12-iso-iPF3α-VI will be described elsewhere. iPF2α-III and iPF3α-III were purchased from Cayman Chemical Co. (Ann Arbor, MI). We utilized purified deionized water (Milli-Q water purification system, Millipore) in the preparation of all aqueous solutions and mobile phases. HPLC-grade acetonitrile and ethyl acetate were purchased from J. T. Baker. Reagent grade acetic acid was purchased from Fisher. HPLC-grade ammonium hydroxide was purchased from Mallinckrodt. Internal standards were added to 1 ml of human urine or 0.3 ml of mouse urine and allowed to equilibrate for 15 min. The pH was then adjusted with formic acid to ≈2.5. The samples were purified by solid phase extraction (SPE) using StrataX cartridges (Phenomenex, Torrance, CA). The SPE cartridge was conditioned with 1 ml of acetonitrile and equilibrated with 1 ml of water. The sample was applied to the cartridge, which was then washed with 1 ml of 5% acetonitrile in water and dried with a vacuum for 15 min. The analyte and internal standards were eluted from the cartridge using 1 ml of 5% acetonitrile in ethyl acetate. The eluate was collected and dried under a gentle stream of nitrogen. The resulting residue was then reconstituted in 200 μl of 20% acetonitrile in water and was filtered by centrifugation. The 0.2-μm Nylon microspin filters were purchased from Alltech Associates. The HPLC included an Accela solvent delivery system (Thermo, Waltham, MA) and a Hypersil GOLD C18 (2.Stafforini D.M. Sheller J.R. Blackwell T.S. Sapirstein A. Yull F.E. McIntyre T.M. Bonventre J.V. Prescott S.M. Roberts 2nd, L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 4616-4623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar), 200 mm × 2.1 mm, 1.9 μm particle size column (Thermo). The mobile phase consisted of water (solvent A) and acetonitrile: methanol (95:5, solvent B), both with 0.005% acetic acid adjusted to pH 5.7 with ammonium hydroxide. The flow rate was 350 μl/min. The separations involved various linear solvent gradient programs. A TSQ Quantum Ultra instrument (Thermo) equipped with a heated electrospray source, and a triple quadrupole analyzer was used in these studies. The ESI source used nitrogen for both sheath and auxiliary gas, set to 70 and 5 arbitrary units, respectively. The mass spectrometer was operated in the negative ion mode with a capillary temperature of 350 °C and a spray voltage of 2.0 kV. The source offset was 6 V. The analyzer was operated in the selected reaction monitoring (SRM) mode for the analysis of urinary iPs. The transitions m/z 351 > 115 for the endogenous material and m/z 355 > 115 for the tetradeuterated internal standards were monitored. The collision energy was 23 eV. 8,12-iso-iPF2α-VI was measured as previous described (28.Song W.L. Lawson J.A. Wang M. Zou H. FitzGerald G.A. Methods Enzymol. 2007; 433: 51-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The product ion scan mode was used for spectral analysis of 5-epi-8,12-iso-iPF3α-VI and 8,12-iso-iPF3α-VI. Precursor ions (m/z 351 for endogenous 5-epi-8,12-iso-iPF3α-VI and 8,12-iso-iPF3α-VI and m/z 355 for the internal standards) were collisionally activated at 23 eV under 1.5 mT argon gas producing the CID spectra. All studies were performed following protocol review and approval by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of the University of Pennsylvania. Eight-week-old female C57/BL6 mice (n = 5) were fed with a 0, 1, or 5% fish oil-rich diet (Harlan Teklad, Madison, WI). Urine was collected for 24 h in metabolic cages before, 6 weeks after, and 11 weeks after initiation of the various diets. Total lipids were extracted using a modified Folch procedure (1.Praticò D. Iuliano L. Mauriello A. Spagnoli L. Lawson J.A. Rokach J. Maclouf J. Violi F. FitzGerald G.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 2028-2034Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). EPA and AA were measured by LC/MS/MS (29.Lee S.H. Pettinella C. Blair I.A. Curr. Drug Metab. 2006; 7: 929-937Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Procedures were performed as previously described (30.Audoly L.P. Rocca B. Fabre J.E. Koller B.H. Thomas D. Loeb A.L. Coffman T.M. FitzGerald G.A. Circulation. 2000; 101: 2833-2840Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Briefly, 12-week-old male C57/BL6 mice (n = 3) were anesthetized with pentobarbital (Nembutal, Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, IL). The carotid artery was isolated from the surrounding tissues and cannulated by a catheter. The catheter was tied in place and connected to a pressure transducer. Mean systemic arterial pressure (MAP) values were recorded continuously for the duration of each experiment. Another catheter was inserted into the jugular vein for drug or vehicle infusions. Experiments were started 20–30 min after completion of surgical procedures. Mice received bolus injections of vehicle (0.9% sodium chloride solution), iPF2α-III and 8,12-iso-iPF3α-VI at 10, 25, or 50 μg/kg. Vehicle or drugs were injected as a 1-ml/kg solution in saline. Twelve-week-old male C57/BL6 mice (n = 3) were anesthetized with pentobarbital, and blood was obtained through the inferior vena cava. Samples were centrifuged to obtain platelet-rich plasma, and platelet counts were determined with a Coulter counter. The platelet-poor plasma supernatant was obtained and used to adjust volumes for aggregation assays. Aggregation studies were performed under constant stirring at 37 °C, and light transmittance was measured with a dual-channel aggregometer. ADP was used as platelet agonist (10 μm). Two clinical studies were performed. The study protocols were approved by the Institutional Review Board of the University of Pennsylvania and by the Advisory Council of the Clinical and Translational Research Center (CTRC) of the University of Pennsylvania. All volunteers were apparently healthy on physical examination, were nonsmokers, and refrained from all medications for 2 weeks before and during the course of the studies. Volunteers with a history of coagulation disorders, a bleeding tendency, drug allergy, or gastrointestinal disorders were excluded from participation in the studies. In the first study, 10 volunteers (5 male and 5 female) received a bolus injection of bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS), 3 ng/kg, under controlled conditions, as we have previously described (31.O'Sullivan S. Mueller M.J. Dahlèn S.E. Kumlin M. Prostaglandins Other Lipid Mediators. 1999; 57: 149-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Subjects were admitted to the CTRC the evening before the study, and an intravenous infusion of saline was commenced. The study involved a 60-h inpatient stay in the CTRC of the University of Pennsylvania comprising an overnight acclimatization phase, a 24-h saline administration control phase, and a 24-h post-LPS study phase. Urinary iPs were assessed in urines collected at the following time intervals before (−24 to −18, −18 to −12, −12 to −6, −6 to 0 h) and after (0 to 2, 2 to 4, 4 to 6, 6 to 8, 8 to 12, 12 to 18, 18 to 24 h) LPS administration. Data are plotted at the midpoint of each corresponding urine collection. In the second study, a single dose of aspirin (325 mg) was administered to 18 healthy volunteers (9 males and 9 females). Urinary iPs were measured in spot urines at time 0 and 4 h after dosing. Urinary iPs are expressed after correction for urinary creatinine (Cre) concentration and are reported as ng/mg Cre. Results are expressed as mean ± S.E. Statistical comparisons were performed initially using a two way analysis of variance, with subsequent two-tailed comparisons as appropriate. Differences were judged significant if p < 0.05. We have synthesized two deuterated standards, d4-5-epi-8,12-iso-iPF3α-VI and d4-8,12-iso-iPF3α-VI to facilitate detection of the endogenous iPs in urine. Endogenous 5-epi-8,12-iso-iPF3α-VI and 8,12-iso-iPF3α-VI (Fig. 2, A, panel b and B, panel b) were identified, co-eluting with their respective deuterated internal standards in both human (Fig. 2A) and mouse urine (Fig. 2B). Co-injection of exogenous synthetic 5-epi-8,12-iso-iPF3α-VI and 8,12-iso-iPF3α-VI increased peak height but not width, confirming the identification and homogeneity of the compounds (Fig. 2, A, panels c and d, and B, panels c and d). Their relative abundance is much higher than other classes of F3-iPs (data not shown). Levels of 5-epi-8,12-iso-iPF3α-VI and 8,12-iso-iPF3α-VI are highly correlated in human urine (supplemental Fig. S1). Thus, we usually quantified only 8,12-iso-iPF3α-VI as a representative F3-iP. Assay reproducibility and variability was assessed on a single sample stored at three different temperatures and assayed three times on 3 separate days (supplemental Fig. S2A). The assay was linear over a range of 0.01–100 ng of added authentic material (supplemental Fig. S2B). A single dose of 325 mg of aspirin failed to alter urinary levels of 8,12-iso-iPF3α-VI in healthy volunteers, confirming of the cyclooxygenase-independent derivation of this F3-iP (supplemental Fig. S3). Data from mice in which COX expression has been genetically manipulated afford further evidence of their COX-independent origin. (supplemental Fig. S4). Collision-induced dissociation (CID) of d4-5-epi-8,12-iso-iPF3α-VI and d4-8,12-iso-iPF3α-VI at m/z 355 gave rise to a series of major fragment ions with m/z values of 115, 177, 221, 275, 311, 337, and a base peak of 355 (Fig. 3, A and C), which was virtually identical to the mass spectrum obtained from endogenous 5-epi-8,12-iso-iPF3α-VI and 8,12-iso-iPF3α-VI, which included m/z values of 115, 173, 217, 271, 307, 333 and a base peak of 351 (Fig. 3, B and D). The differences in m/z values between these two groups were either 0 or 4 mass units reflecting fragments with or without deuterium, again confirming the identity of 5-epi-8,12-iso-iPF3α-VI and 8,12-iso-iPF3α-VI. The purity of the deuterated standards was also confirmed by mass spectrometry (supplemental Fig. S5). A prototypic F2-iP, iPF2α-III (8-iso-PGF2α) increases blood pressure if administrated intravenously (30.Audoly L.P. Rocca B. Fabre J.E. Koller B.H. Thomas D. Loeb A.L. Coffman T.M. FitzGerald G.A. Circulation. 2000; 101: 2833-2840Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Here (Fig. 4A), intravenous injection of iPF2α-III (50 μg/kg body weight) caused a rapid and substantial increase in mean systemic arterial pressure (MAP) that was sustained for several minutes in mice. However, intravenous injection of an equal or higher dose of iPF3α-III (8-iso-PGF3α) (50 μg/kg body weight) had no effect (Fig. 4B). While iPF2α-III dose-dependently elevated MAP, iPF3α-III had no effect (Fig. 4C). iPF2α-III can also induce platelet aggregation (30.Audoly L.P. Rocca B. Fabre J.E. Koller B.H. Thomas D. Loeb A.L. Coffman T.M. FitzGerald G.A. Circulation. 2000; 101: 2833-2840Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Here, while pretreatment of platelets with iPF2α-III (10 μmol/liter) converted the reversible aggregation induced by 10 μmol/liter ADP in mice to irreversible aggregation (30.Audoly L.P. Rocca B. Fabre J.E. Koller B.H. Thomas D. Loeb A.L. Coffman T.M. FitzGerald G.A. Circulation. 2000; 101: 2833-2840Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 32.Yin K. Halushka P.V. Yan Y.T. Wong P.Y. J.

Ther. 1997; 281: 957-964PubMed Google Scholar). the same concentration of iPF3α-III had no effect on platelet function (Fig. 4E). Mice were administered isocaloric high fat diets (HFDs) enriched with 0, 1, or 5% fish oil for six or eleven weeks and levels of 8,12-iso-iPF3α-VI and 8,12-iso-iPF2α-VI were measured in urine. In mice fed the diet without fish oil, there was no significant change of levels of 8,12-iso-iPF3α-VI or 8,12-iso-iPF2α-VI in urine (Fig. 5A). In mice fed 1% fish oil, urinary 8,12-iso-iPF3α-VI levels trended upwards from 1.84 ng/mg Cre at baseline to 3.39 ng/mg Cre at 6 weeks (p = 0.11) and to 3.94 ng/mg Cre at 11 weeks (p = 0.22), while a decline in the more abundant urinary 8,12-iso-iPF2α-VI from 2.27 ng/mg Cre at baseline to 0.24 ng/mg Cre at 6 weeks (p = 0.01) and to 0.72 ng/mg Cre at 11 weeks attained significance (p = 0.02) (Fig. 5B); in mice fed the diet with 5% fish oil, urinary 8,12-iso-iPF3α-VI significantly increased from 1.15 ng/mg Cre at baseline to 41.61 ng/mg Cre at 6 weeks and to 104.31 ng/mg Cre at 11 weeks (p < 0.001). While much less abundant, urinary 8,12-iso-iPF2α-VI levels also significantly increased from 1.19 ng/mg Cre at baseline to 4.83 ng/mg Cre at 6 weeks to 7.71 ng/mg Cre at 11 weeks (p < 0.001) (Fig. 5C). Substitution of ω-3 for ω-6 PUFAs in the diet dose-dependently increases the slope of the relationship between urinary 8,12-iso-iPF3α-VI and 8,12-iso-iPF2α-VI (Fig. 5, D and E). Reflective of diet-induced tissue accumulation of the lipid substrate, increased levels of EPA, as measured by LC/MS/MS, were observed in mouse heart after ingestion of the EPA-enriched diets (supplemental Fig. S6). LPS evokes a systemic inflammatory response in humans. Previously we reported that a time-dependent increase in urinary excretion of three distinct F2-iPs: iPF2α-III, iPF2α-VI, and 8,12-iso-iPF2α-VI coincides with the maximal constitutional response to LPS in healthy volunteers (34.McAdam B.F. Mardini I.A. Habib A. Burke A. Lawson J.A. Kapoor S. FitzGerald G.A. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 1473-1482Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Here, LPS also induced a mean increase in 8,12-iso-iPF3α-VI from 1.81 ng/mg Cre at baseline to 2.57 ng/mg Cre at 2–4 h and 2.92 ng/mg Cre at 4–6 h after administration (Fig. 6A). After the inflammatory response, it returned to basal levels during the clinical resolution phase (12–18 h after LPS) (30.Audoly L.P. Rocca B. Fabre J.E. Koller B.H. Thomas D. Loeb A.L. Coffman T.M. FitzGerald G.A. Circulation. 2000; 101: 2833-2840Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). 8,12-iso-iPF3α-VI and 8,12-iso-iPF2α-VI were weakly related for the group as a whole (Fig. 6B). However, within each individual, 8,12-iso-iPF3α-VI and 8,12-iso-iPF2α-VI are highly correlated (R2 median 0.8; range 0.54–0.97). The slope [m] of the relationship between the two products, reflecting peroxidation products of ω-3 versus ω-6 substrates, varied by approximately an order of magnitude (0.02–0.19) among the individuals in the study (Fig. 6C). EPA is metabolized by cyclooxygenases (COXs) to series 3 prostaglandins (35.Kulkarni P.S. Srinivasan B.D. Prostaglandins. 1986; 31: 1159-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) and is transformed non-enzymatically by free radicals to series 3 iPs, that include F3-iPs (15.Nourooz-Zadeh J. Halliwell B. Anggård E.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 236: 467-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Whereas EPA is utilized less efficiently as a substrate by COXs than AA, some of its analogous products, such as TxB3, but not PGI3, also possess less biological activity (20.Chang C.T. Patel P. Kang N. Lawson J.A. Song W.L. Powell W.S. Fitzgerald G.A. Rokach J. Bioorganic Med. Chem. Lett. 2008; 18: 5523-5527Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Thus, a reduction in formation of TxA2, formation of the less potent TxA3 and retained bioactivity of PGI3 compensating to some degree for depressed PGI2 may contribute to a cardioprotective effect of fish oils (21.Wada M. DeLong C.J. Hong Y.H. Rieke C.J. Song I. Sidhu R.S. Yuan C. Warnock M. Schmaier A.H. Yokoyama C. Smyth E.M. Wilson S.J. FitzGerald G.A. Garavito R.M. Sui de X. Regan J.W. Smith W.L. J. Biol.

While observational studies have associated high fish consumption with a reduction in cardiovascular risk, there has been concern that this may reflect the influence of lifestyle covariates. Indeed, some of the studies that have reported such benefit have been conducted in populations where the fish consumed are lean and relatively deficient in ω-3 PUFAs (36.Nilsen D.W. Albrektsen G.

Lipid Res. 2006; 45: 357-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Because EPA and DHA possess more double bonds than AA, they may be more susceptible to oxidation by free radicals than is AA. This might adversely influence cell membrane function or constrain beneficial effects of fish oils via autacoidal effects of F3- and F4-iPs. Alternatively, EPA and DHA may serve as a buffer or “sink” for free radicals, thereby protecting AA from reactive oxygen species and the consequent formation of biologically active F2-iPs. We have previously reported that F2-iPs can function as incidental agonists at receptors for TxA2 and PGF2α (30.Audoly L.P. Rocca B. Fabre J.E. Koller B.H. Thomas D. Loeb A.L. Coffman T.M. FitzGerald G.A. Circulation. 2000; 101: 2833-2840Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 45.Kunapuli P. Lawson J.A. Rokach J.A. Meinkoth J.L. FitzGerald G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22442-22452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar).Here we show that iPF3α-III, the series 3 analog of one of these F2-iPs, iPF2α-III, does not share the capability of the AA-derived product to activate platelets or cause vasoconstriction. Thus, iPs derived from fish oils, like enzymatically derived eicosanoids, may exhibit diminished biological activity compared with those formed from AA. However, despite this difference it is unknown whether a shift in biological properties of high concentrations (1–10 μm) of individual iPs in vitro is of relevance to the likely much lower (fm-pm) concentrations attained in vivo. Moreover, multiple iPs are likely to be formed together under conditions of oxidative stress, rendering assumptions based on concentrations or comparative bioactivities of single species difficult to relate to conditions in vivo. Aside from their biological activity, the quantitation of F3-iPs reflects peroxidation of EPA and DHA. Clustered analysis of iPs derived from both ω-6 with ω-3 PUFAs is likely to refine their utility as indices of oxidant stress in vivo. Thus, we show that dietary supplementation with fish oils dose-dependently increases the slope relating urinary 8,12-iso-iPF3α-VI to 8,12-iso-iPF2α-VI in mice. Interestingly, while the lower dose of fish oil depresses urinary 8,12-iso-iPF2α-VI, excretion of the F2-iP is modestly increased at the higher dose of fish oil. It is likely that iPs are present to some extent in the feed pellets, preformed from the autooxidation of AA and EPA in situ. Indeed, low levels of both 8,12-iso-iPF2α-VI and 8,12-iso-iPF3α-VI were present (∼1 × 10−5 % of total AA and EPA). However, these quantities and the dose-dependent responses of the two iPs to EPA-enriched diets and LPS administration indicate that the predominant source of iPs is the in vivo oxidation of AA and EPA in the cell membranes. Clustered analysis of the F2- and F3-iPs is also informative in the oxidant stress response to an acute inflammatory stimulus in humans. Acute administration of LPS augments excretion of both urinary 8,12-iso-iPF3α-VI and 8,12-iso-iPF2α-VI coincident with the systemic response to LPS in volunteers (34.McAdam B.F. Mardini I.A. Habib A. Burke A. Lawson J.A. Kapoor S. FitzGerald G.A. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 1473-1482Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Here excretion of both F2- and F3-iPs is highly correlated within individuals, but the slope describing this relationship exhibits substantial (approximately an order of magnitude) heterogeneity. These individuals were on ad lib diets, the constituents of which were not characterized. However, our data from mice suggest strongly that the slope variation reflects differences among the volunteers in dietary intake of ω-3 versus ω-6 PUFAs. In summary, we have identified and characterized two major F3-iPs that are abundant and readily detectable in urine of mice and humans. These afford a quantitative index of the peroxidation of ω-3 PUFAs enriched in fish oils. Differential formation of F3- rather than F2-iPs may contribute to the health benefits of a diet rich in ω-3 PUFAs. Furthermore, clustered analysis of F3- and F2-iPs promises to refine analysis of oxidant stress in inflammation by accounting for interindividual variation in the intake of dietary PUFAs.

https://openalex.org/W1977609596,"Amrinone is a bipyridine compound with characteristic effects on the force-velocity relationship of fast skeletal muscle, including a reduction in the maximum shortening velocity and increased maximum isometric force. Here we performed experiments to elucidate the molecular mechanisms for these effects, with the additional aim to gain insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying the force-velocity relationship. In vitro motility assays established that amrinone reduces the sliding velocity of heavy meromyosin-propelled actin filaments by 30% at different ionic strengths of the assay solution. Stopped-flow studies of myofibrils, heavy meromyosin and myosin subfragment 1, showed that the effects on sliding speed were not because of a reduced rate of ATP-induced actomyosin dissociation because the rate of this process was increased by amrinone. Moreover, optical tweezers studies could not detect any amrinone-induced changes in the working stroke length. In contrast, the ADP affinity of acto-heavy meromyosin was increased about 2-fold by 1 mm amrinone. Similar effects were not observed for acto-subfragment 1. Together with the other findings, this suggests that the amrinone-induced reduction in sliding velocity is attributed to inhibition of a strain-dependent ADP release step. Modeling results show that such an effect may account for the amrinone-induced changes of the force-velocity relationship. The data emphasize the importance of the rate of a strain-dependent ADP release step in influencing the maximum sliding velocity in fast skeletal muscle. The data also lead us to discuss the possible importance of cooperative interactions between the two myosin heads in muscle contraction."

Using single particle analysis methods, we have determined the first three-dimensional structure, at 23 Å resolution, for a member of the low voltage-activated voltage-gated calcium channel family, CaV3.1, a T-type channel. CaV3.1 has dimensions of ∼115 × 85 × 95 Å, composed of two distinct segments. The cytoplasmic densities form a vestibule below the transmembrane domain with the C terminus, unambiguously identified by the presence of a His tag being ∼65 Å long and curling around the base of the structure. The cytoplasmic assembly has a large exposed surface area that may serve as a signaling hub with the C terminus acting as a “fishing rod” to bind regulatory proteins. We have also determined a three-dimensional structure, at a resolution of 25 Å, for the monomeric form of the cardiac L-type voltage-gated calcium (high voltage-activated) channel with accessory proteins β and α2δ bound to the ion channel polypeptide CaV1.2. Comparison with the skeletal muscle isoform finds a good match particularly with respect to the conformation, size, and shape of the domain identified as that formed by α2. Furthermore, modeling of the CaV3.1 structure (analogous to CaV1.2 at these resolutions) into the heteromeric L-type voltage-gated calcium channel complex volume reveals multiple interaction sites for β-CaV1.2 binding and for the first time identifies the size and organization of the α2δ polypeptides.

To date, five different types of voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs) 4The abbreviations used are: VGCCvoltage-gated calcium channelsLTCCL-type voltage-gated calcium channelLVAlow voltage-activatedHVAhigh voltage-activatedDTTdithiothreitolCHAPS3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acidNi-NTAnickel-nitrilotriacetic acidFSCFourier shell correlationTMtransmembraneConAconcanavalin AAIDα-interaction domain. have been identified, L, N, P/Q, R, and T, and classified according to their physiological and pharmacological characteristics (1Tsien R.W.

On the basis of their electrophysiological properties, VGCCs can be divided into two classes: high voltage-activated (HVA) and low voltage-activated (LVA). T-type Ca2+ channels form the LVA family and are characterized by their low threshold of activation, small single channel conductance, slow deactivation, and a low sensitivity to classical blockers of HVA channels (4Huguenard J.R. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1996; 58: 329-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar, 5Perez-Reyes E. Physiol. Rev. 2003; 83: 117-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (1350) Google Scholar, 6Vassort G. Alvarez J. J. Cardiovasc. Electrophysiol. 1994; 5: 376-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). T-type channels have a central role regulating, for example, cardiac pacemaking of sinoatrial node cells and tonic firing patterns in neurons (5Perez-Reyes E. Physiol. Rev. 2003; 83: 117-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (1350) Google Scholar). Three T-type channel isoforms have been identified and cloned: CaV3.1, CaV3.2, and CaV3.3, with each isoform possessing several splice variants showing distinct functional properties (reviewed in Ref. 7Yunker A.M.

Each VGCC is composed of a pore-forming polypeptide termed the CaV α1-subunit, with 10 mammalian α1 isoforms identified, divided into three subfamilies: CaV1–3 (8Ertel E.A. Campbell K.P. Harpold M.M. Hofmann F. Mori Y. Perez-Reyes E. Schwartz A. Snutch T.P. Tanabe T. Birnbaumer L. Tsien R.W. Catterall W.A. Neuron. 2000; 25: 533-535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar). Housed within the CaV α1 subunit are the calcium pore, voltage-sensing apparatus, drug binding sites, and numerous structural determinants required for binding auxiliary subunits and other regulatory proteins. Analysis of the amino acid sequences and predicted secondary structure of the T-type channels suggests a similar topology to the HVA CaV α1 subunits and K+ and Na+ channels, implying that they are evolutionarily related (5Perez-Reyes E. Physiol. Rev. 2003; 83: 117-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (1350) Google Scholar). HVA channels are heteromeric complexes formed by the CaV α1 polypeptide, with several accessory subunits non-covalently bound. For example, the cardiac L-type voltage-gated calcium channel is formed by the CaV1.2 subunit in association with the soluble β-polypeptide localized to the intracellular side of the plasma membrane and a largely extracellular α2δ subunit (9Leung A.T. Imagawa T. Campbell K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 7943-7946Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Arikkath J. Campbell K.P. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2003; 13: 298-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). The β-subunit has a role in regulating activation, inactivation, and voltage dependence as well as targeting of CaV1.2 to the plasma membrane. The crystal structure of the core region of the β-polypeptide in complex with a peptide corresponding to the interacting region of the CaV1.2 (AID) has been described (11Van Petegem F. Chatelain F.C. Minor Jr., D.L. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 1108-1115Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 12Opatowsky Y. Chen C.C. Campbell K.P. Hirsch J.A. Neuron. 2004; 42: 387-399Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar), revealing that it is comprised of two domains, a type 3 Src homology (SH3) domain and a guanylate kinase-like domain. CaV1.2 is associated, on the extracellular side of the membrane, with the α2δ subunit, the product of post-translational cleavage of a single gene comprised of a glycosylated extracellular α2 domain linked by disulfide bonds to the transmembrane δ polypeptide, which is also mainly extracellular and glycosylated. Four isoforms of α2δ have been identified (13De Jongh K.S. Warner C. Catterall W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14738-14741Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Ellis S.B. Williams M.E.

The role of the α2δ protein is not as well understood as that of the β-subunit, but it has been shown to increase the current amplitude and have effects on inactivation (15Cantí C. Nieto-Rostro M. Foucault I. Heblich F. Wratten J. Richards M.W. Hendrich J. Douglas L. Page K.M. Davies A. Dolphin A.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

An additional membrane-spanning auxiliary subunit, γ, was initially thought to be unique to the skeletal muscle LTCC; however, recent studies have identified neuronal isoforms, although it remains unclear whether they have any role as calcium channel subunits (16Jay S.D.

We report here the purification of a recombinant CaV3.1, leading to the calculation of the first three-dimensional structure for a member of the LVA channel family. CaV3.1 is formed by two distinct segments, which we have been able to assign to the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains. We have identified the C-terminal domain that forms a tail that winds around the base of the structure, providing insights as to how this channel may be regulated through the binding of accessory/regulatory proteins and/or long range conformational movements. Furthermore, we have been able to utilize this new three-dimensional structure to probe the assembly of the polypeptides forming the cardiac LTCCs after having also calculated a novel three-dimensional structure for the monomeric form of the channel purified from bovine heart. At the resolutions described here, CaV3.1 can be considered analogous to CaV1.2; see Fig. 1A for a sequence alignment overview. No mandatory auxiliary subunits for the T-type, LVA, channels have been identified. However, studies have shown that co-expression of CaV3.1 with α2δ subunits led to a 2-fold increase in T-type-mediated currents (18Dubel S.J. Altier C. Chaumont S. Lory P. Bourinet E. Nargeot J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 29263-29269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), and thus this model may also provide an insight as to how accessory proteins may associate with CaV3.1 to exert regulatory effects. The CaV3.1 rat neuronal clone was a kind gift from Dr. Edward Perez-Reyes (19Perez-Reyes E. Cribbs L.L. Daud A. Lacerda A.E. Barclay J. Williamson M.P. Fox M. Rees M. Lee J.H. Nature. 1998; 391: 896-900Crossref PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar). The baculovirus vector pFastBac-HTa, the Bac-to-Bac baculovirus expression system, and the Sf9 cells were purchased from Invitrogen. CaV3.1 containing a C-terminal c-Myc and decahistidine (His10) tag (20Page K.M. Heblich F. Davies A. Butcher A.J. Leroy J. Bertaso F. Pratt W.S. Dolphin A.C. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 5400-5409Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) was subcloned into the baculovirus vector pFastBac-HTa. Recombinant baculoviruses were generated using the Bac-to-Bac system (Invitrogen). Sf9 insect cells were cultured in TNM-FH medium (Sigma T3285) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum and were split when confluent. For protein expression, Sf9 cells, 70–80% confluent, were infected with recombinant baculoviruses at a multiplicity of infection of 1–2. They were then incubated at 27 °C for 72 h. Virus-infected Sf9 cells expressing the CaV3.1 were harvested 72 h after infection by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 5 min. The resulting cell pellets were resuspended in 10 ml of buffer containing 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, and 1 mm DTT. All buffers also contained protease inhibitors in the form of Complete EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science), with one tablet dissolved for every 50 ml of buffer. Cells were lysed by sonication for 3 × 30 s. The mixture was then centrifuged at 1000 × g for 5 min to remove the large particulate matter. The resulting supernatant, containing the Sf9 cell membranes, was then centrifuged at 50,000 × g for 1 h. The pellet was then resuspended in 10 ml of buffer containing 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm imidazole, 1 mm DTT, 1% (w/v) CHAPS, and protease inhibitors and incubated for 1 h on a rolling platform at 4 °C. The solubilized membrane protein then underwent centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C to clear any unsolubilized material. The resulting supernatant was diluted 1:1 with buffer containing 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm imidazole, and 1 mm DTT and applied to a 1-ml Ni-NTA column (HIS-Select® nickel affinity gel (Sigma)), which had been pre-equilibrated with a buffer containing 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm imidazole, 1 mm DTT, 0.5% (w/v) CHAPS. The gel matrix was washed with 5 volumes of equilibration buffer: 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm imidazole, 1 mm DTT, 0.5% (w/v) CHAPS. The protein solution was then added to the matrix, and this was left for 1 h on a rolling platform at 4 °C. The column was then washed with 20 volumes of equilibration (wash) buffer, and finally, the bound protein was eluted by the addition of 1 column volume of equilibration buffer containing 350 mm imidazole. This final step was repeated four times, and thus four eluted fractions were collected. The eluted protein was concentrated using a Centricon YM-50, applied to a size exclusion column (Sephacryl S-200), and eluted off using the buffer above (without the imidazole and with 50 mm NaCl). CaV3.1-containing fractions were applied to a preswollen microgranular anion exchanger diethylaminoethyl (DEAE) cellulose (DE52, Whatman). CaV3.1 was eluted using a step NaCl gradient (25–500 mm, using 25 mm increments). SDS-PAGE and Western blotting (anti-Cav3.1, Santa Cruz Biotechnology sc-25690) were employed to determine the purity and characterize the purified protein at each step with protein eluting between 250 and 350 mm NaCl from the DEAE-column found to be pure CaV3.1 (see Fig. 1A). Sarcolemmal membranes were prepared from bovine heart according to Ref. 21Jones L.R. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 157: 85-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar. All buffers throughout the purification were supplemented with a protease inhibitor mixture containing 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm benzamidine, 1 μm pepstatin A, and 1 μml-trans-epoxysuccinyl-leucylamide-(-4-guananido)-butane (E64). As described previously (22Wang M.C. Collins R.F. Ford R.C. Berrow N.S. Dolphin A.C. Kitmitto A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 7159-7168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), LTCCs were solubilized from the sarcolemmal membranes (protein concentration of 2 mg/ml) by incubation with 1% (w/v) digitonin (detergent:protein 5:1), in 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 2 mm CaCl2, for 45 min with gentle agitation at 4 °C. The solubilized protein was then loaded onto a DEAE-column (20 ml) equilibrated with the solubilization buffer. Unbound protein was removed by washing with 1.5 column volumes of 0.1% (w/v) digitonin in 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, followed by a second wash with 1% (w/v) decyl-β-d-maltoside substituted for the digitonin. Protein was then eluted from the column with a linear NaCl gradient (0–0.5 m) in 1% w/v decyl-β-d-maltoside, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 2 mm CaCl2. The LTCC-containing fractions were then concentrated using a Centricon YM-50 and applied to a size-exclusion column (Sephacryl S-300). The channel-containing fractions were then applied to a wheat germ agglutinin (WGA)-column, and the purification procedure followed that described in Ref. 22Wang M.C. Collins R.F. Ford R.C.

Purified cardiac LTCC preparations were examined by SDS-PAGE, and native gels were as described in Ref. 23Wang M.C. Velarde G. Ford R.C. Berrow N.S. Dolphin A.C. Kitmitto A. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 323: 85-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar. Protein bands from gels were transferred to nitrocellulose using a Bio-Rad Transblot apparatus. Monoclonal antibodies against the cardiac LTCC α2 subunits were purchased from Abcam, and antisera and affinity-purified antibodies raised against a β-subunit peptide (Ab2491) were prepared as described previously (23Wang M.C.

J. Physiol. 1995; 482: 481-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Samples were examined using standard negative staining techniques with 2% (w/v) uranyl acetate. Images of the LTCC complex and CaV3.1 were recorded between a 0.55–0.96 μm and 0.65–1.05 μm defocus range, respectively, on a Tecnai 12 transmission electron microscope operated at 100 kV, at a calibrated magnification of ×47,800. Micrographs were scanned using an IMACON scanner at 3.6 Å/pixel at the specimen level. CaV3.1 and cardiac LTCC samples were checked for homogeneity and presentation of different views. Matrix analysis of sampling over Euler angles, ϕ, θ, and ψ, showed a good coverage of three-dimensional space for each data set (not shown). The contrast transfer function (CTF) was determined for each image using CTFIT (part of the EMAN software). As discussed by Adair et al. (25Adair B. Nunn R. Lewis S. Dukes I. Philipson L. Yeager M. Biophys. J. 2008; 94: 2106-2114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), images were corrected for phase effects only. The resolution of the final three-dimensional volumes for Cav3.1 and the cardiac LTCC were assessed following established procedures (26Böttcher B. Wynne S.A. Crowther R.A. Nature. 1997; 386: 88-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar). In brief, each data set was divided into two, with volumes calculated for the two subsets, and the resolution was estimated by the Fourier shell correlation (FSC) coefficient with the resolution limit taken to be where the FSC value fell below 0.5. All models were generated using the UCSF Chimera program. The three-dimensional structure of the recombinant CaV3.1 was generated using the common line projection matching methods employed in EMAN (27Ludtke S.J. Baldwin P.R. Chiu W. J. Struct. Biol. 1999; 128: 82-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (2110) Google Scholar) with no symmetry applied (C1). Three-dimensional reconstructions of small asymmetric proteins are complex, and rigorous experimentation must be undertaken to ensure that the features in the final model are robust. A wide variety of starting models were tested including Gaussian blobs, transmembrane domain of KV1.2 (PDB entry 2R9R, edited), and the full KV1.2 crystal structure (2R9R) filtered to an appropriate resolution. In all reconstructions the principal structural features were consistent, indicating the fidelity of the final three-dimensional reconstruction. Approximately 11,500 particles were selected interactively using the graphical interface boxer (EMAN image processing software) into a box of 64 × 64 pixels (230 × 230 Å). Particles were band-pass-filtered and centered, and a preliminary three-dimensional model was calculated from a set of unbiased reference-free class averages showing different orientations of the complex (using the refine2d.py program under EMAN). The three-dimensional model was iteratively refined at each step using a projection matching routine, whereby projections with uniformly distributed orientations of the preliminary three-dimensional model were used as references for classification of the raw data set, with the class averages from this step used to construct a new three-dimensional model. Refinement was carried out with an angular coverage of 7° generating 388 classes containing between 10 and 48 particles per class. The final reconstruction included 86% of the selected images. Convergence, i.e. stabilization of the three-dimensional structure, was monitored by examining the FSC of the three-dimensional models generated from each iteration. The presence of the C-terminal His tag allowed labeling of the CaV3.1 C terminus using Ni-NTA-gold® (Nanoprobes Inc). Excess Ni-NTA-gold was added to the purified CaV3.1 and incubated for 3 h. Aliquots were then stained with uranyl acetate as above. Approximately 4,500 CaV3.1 particles with a gold label associated were selected. The class averages shown in Fig. 3 illustrate that a good sampling of different orientations of labeled CaV3.1 was observed. The same initial start model employed for the three-dimensional reconstruction of the unlabeled CaV3.1 was used for the gold-labeled channel. The three-dimensional structure of the cardiac LTCC was generated using the same methodology as described above, determined with no symmetry imposed, i.e. C1. Approximately 4,300 particles were selected interactively using the graphical interface boxer (EMAN image processing software) into a box of 88 × 88 pixels (316 × 316 Å). Particles were band-pass-filtered and centered, and a preliminary three-dimensional model was calculated from a set of unbiased reference-free class averages showing different orientations of the complex. The three-dimensional model was iteratively refined at each step using a projection matching routine, carried out with an angular coverage of 10 degrees generating 179 classes with between 7 and 42 images per class. The final reconstruction included 87% of the selected images. As described above, to ensure that the features of the resulting C1 volume were consistent, several different start models from class averages derived from startnrclasses and refine2d.py, as well as using a sphere (makeinitialmodel.py), were employed. Fourier shell correlation between each model was used to determine convergence to the final model. A low pass Gaussian filter to 25 Å was applied to the final three-dimensional volume in accordance with the resolution assessment. Concanavalin A (Sigma) (stock 5 mg/ml in 10 mm Hepes, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaSO4, 1 mm MnCl2, pH 7) was added in a 3-fold excess to the purified cardiac LTCC (following the method described in Ref. 28Lazarov V.K.

Samples were then examined by transmission electron microscope after staining with 2% (w/v) uranyl acetate. Micrographs were scanned as above, and LTCC-Con A conjugates were selected (box size 104 × 104 pixels; 374 × 374 Å), aligned, and classified using standard programs in the SPIDER software package (29Frank J. Radermacher M. Penczek P. Zhu J. Li Y. Ladjadj M. Leith A. J. Struct. Biol. 1996; 116: 190-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (1816) Google Scholar). CaV3.1 was expressed and purified from Sf9 cells. CaV3.1 is a small (∼250-kDa, rat) asymmetric protein composed of 24 putative transmembrane segments, grouped into four domains, which are connected by intracellular loops, with a large (∼46 kDa) cytoplasmic C-terminal domain. We have previously characterized this expressed protein and shown it to be functional (20Page K.M. Heblich F. Davies A. Butcher A.J. Leroy J. Bertaso F. Pratt W.S. Dolphin A.C. J.

Serial chromatographic techniques were employed, including nickel affinity gel, to exploit the presence of the polyhistidine tag. Size exclusion and ion exchange steps were also introduced to further purify the sample, leading to a single band on a SDS-PAGE at ∼250 kDa, corresponding to the predicted molecular mass of CaV3.1 (Fig. 1B, lane 1). The identity of the purified protein as CaV3.1 was confirmed by Western blotting methods (Fig. 1B, lane 2, anti-CaV3.1; lane 3, anti-His). Approximately 50 μg of highly purified CaV3.1 protein was isolated from 49 mg of Sf9 cells after sonication. Single particle analysis has proven particularly suitable for structural studies of large macromolecular complexes such as the ribosome (for review, see Ref. 30Ruprecht J. Nield J. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 2001; 75: 121-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) and proteins with complex symmetry e.g. viruses (31Zhang X. Settembre E. Xu C. Dormitzer P.R. Bellamy R. Harrison S.C.

Examination of micrographs of purified CaV3.1 found a homogeneous population of particles, presenting multiple views of the channel. Encouragingly, square-shaped particles with a side length of ∼100 Å were occasionally observed (indicated on Fig. 1C) that may represent a view of the channel perpendicular to the membrane plane in keeping with the putative pseudo four-fold symmetry of the transmembrane domains. The Fourier common lines projection-matching method was employed using the EMAN software package (27Ludtke S.J. Baldwin P.R. Chiu W. J. Struct. Biol. 1999; 128: 82-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (2110) Google Scholar) to calculate a three-dimensional structure. In total, 11,500 Cav3.1 particles, ranging in size from ∼80 to 120 Å, were selected. Fig. 1D presents examples of class averages and corresponding reprojections of the final three-dimensional volume, illustrating that the structure is consistent with the class averages. Image 1 shows a structure that is ∼115 Å in length, narrowing to one end and ∼85 Å at the widest point. The image below is slightly shorter and wider with two distinct domains resolved. The complexes in rows 3 and 4 are almost square-shaped, ∼85 × 95 Å, and are characterized by a central region of low density (i.e. averages appear slightly darker in the middle). The arrow on image 4 highlights a small density we have termed the tail that protrudes from the body of the complex. Although image 5 is similar in shape and size to that presented in row 3, it does not display a mid region of low density and thus likely represents a different view of the complex. Image 6 shows a class average that is consistent with the observation of tetragonal particles with side lengths of ∼100 Å. The Fourier shell correlation plot shown in Fig. 1E indicates that the resolution of the final three-dimensional volume is ∼23 Å at a correlation of 0.5. The three-dimensional reconstruction of purified CaV3.1 (Fig. 2) yielded a complex ∼115 Å tall with a width and depth of ∼85 × 95 Å. A putative side view of CaV3.1 is presented in Fig. 2A. It is comprised of two distinct sections: an upper compact domain labeled M ∼50–60 Å in height and 85 × 95 Å across as viewed from the top (Fig. 2, A and D) and a lower portion labeled C formed from a number of densities (Fig. 2, B and C). Fig. 2E shows that the structure of CaV3.1 is open from the bottom and reveals that the domain we identified as the tail in class average 4 (Fig. 1D) is ∼65 Å long and curls around the base to form a horseshoe shape. The three-dimensional structure of CaV3.1 is displayed to encapsulate a protein mass of ∼320 kDa (including detergent micelle and residual lipid). It is estimated that the amount of detergent associated with purified intrinsic membrane proteins increases the mass of the protein, depending on the detergent, by a factor of 0.3–1.5 (35Gennis R.B. Cantor C.R. Biomembranes, Molecular Structure and Function. Springer-Verlag, New York1989: 91-105Google Scholar). Therefore, the structure is also presented (Fig. 2, F and G) at two other volume thresholds. It can be seen (Fig. 2F) that there are few differences between the structural features, except that at the lower threshold, the tip of the tail forms a contact with the lower portion of domain M, as indicated by the arrow. At a higher threshold (corresponding to a protein mass of ∼230 kDa, Fig. 2G displayed in red surface render), the global features and characteristics identified in panels A–F remain consistent. Using Ni-NTA-gold (Nanoprobes Inc.), we have labeled the polyhistidine tag at the C terminus of CaV3.1 to identify its position within the three-dimensional structure. The Ni-NTA-gold conjugate is visualized as an electron-dense black globular domain ∼1.8 nm in diameter, under the conditions employed here, and has the advantage of being able to bind closely to the His tag because there are no additional proteins attached.

Glycans are not only one of the major components of the cell but also are essential molecules that modulate a variety of important biological processes in all living organisms. Glycans are used primarily as energy storage and metabolic intermediates as well as being main structural constituents in bacteria and plants. Moreover, as a consequence of protein and lipid glycosylation, glycans generate a significant amount of structural diversity in biological systems. This structural information is particularly apparent in molecular recognition events including cell-cell interactions during critical steps of development, the immune response, host-pathogen interactions, and tumor cell metastasis. Most of the enzymes encoded in eukaryotic/prokaryotic/archaeans genomes that are responsible for the biosynthesis and modification of glycan structures are GTs 3The abbreviations used are: GTglycosyltransferasePIMphosphatidyl-myo-inositol mannosidePIphosphatidyl-myo-inositolPIM1phosphatidyl-myo-inositol monomannosideMsPimAPimA from Mycobacterium smegmatisITCisothermal titration calorimetryDSCdifferential scanning calorimetryAUCanalytical ultracentrifugationIns-Pmyo-inositol 1-phosphatePDBProtein Data Bankr.m.s.d.root-mean-square deviation. 3The abbreviations used are: GTglycosyltransferasePIMphosphatidyl-myo-inositol mannosidePIphosphatidyl-myo-inositolPIM1phosphatidyl-myo-inositol monomannosideMsPimAPimA from Mycobacterium smegmatisITCisothermal titration calorimetryDSCdifferential scanning calorimetryAUCanalytical ultracentrifugationIns-Pmyo-inositol 1-phosphatePDBProtein Data Bankr.m.s.d.root-mean-square deviation.

Although considerable progress has been made in recent years in understanding the mode of action of GTs at the molecular level, the mechanisms that govern recognition of lipid acceptors and membrane association of peripheral membrane-binding GTs remains poorly understood. GTs can be classified as either “inverting” or “retaining” enzymes according to the anomeric configuration of the reaction substrates and products. A single displacement mechanism in which a general base assists in the activation of the acceptor substrate for nucleophilic attack by the sugar donor is well established for inverting enzymes (6Persson K. Ly H.D. Dieckelmann M. Wakarchuk W.W. Withers S.G. Strynadka N.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 98-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar, 7Lairson L.L. Withers S.G. Chem. Commun. 2004; 20: 2243-2248Crossref Scopus (89) Google Scholar). In contrast, the catalytic mechanism for retaining enzymes, including PimA, remains unclear. By analogy with glycosylhydrolases, a double displacement mechanism via the formation of a covalent glycosyl-enzyme intermediate was first proposed (8Lairson L.L. Chiu C.P. Ly H.D. He S. Wakarchuk W.W. Strynadka N.C. Withers S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 28339-28344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). However, in the absence of direct evidence of a viable covalent intermediate, an alternative mechanism known as the SNi “internal return” has been suggested where phospho-sugar donor bond breakage and sugar-acceptor bond formation occur in a concerted, but necessarily stepwise manner on the same face of the sugar (6Persson K.

Only two protein topologies have been found for nucleotide-diphospho-sugar-dependent enzymes among the first 30 GT sequence-based families (10Coutinho P.M. Deleury E. Davies G.J. Henrissat B. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 328: 307-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (899) Google Scholar) (see the carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZy) data base) for which three-dimensional structures have been reported (11Davies G.J. Gloster T.M. Henrissat B. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2005; 15: 637-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). These topologies are variations of “Rossmann-like” domains and have been defined as GT-A (12Charnock S.J. Davies G.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 6380-6385Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar) and GT-B (13Vrielink A. Rüger W. Driessen H.P. Freemont P.S. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3413-3422Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Both inverting and retaining enzymes were found in GT-A and GT-B folds, indicating that there is no correlation between the overall fold of GTs and their catalytic mechanism. The primary sequence of PimA contains the GPGTF (glycogen phosphorylase/GT) motif, a signature present in enzymes of the GT-B fold (14Wrabl J.O. Grishin N.V. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 314: 365-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). GT-B proteins do not use divalent cations and consist of two Rossmann-like (Β-α-Β) domains separated by a deep fissure. Therefore, an important interdomain movement has been predicted in some members of this superfamily during catalysis, including MurG (15Hu Y. Chen L. Ha S. Gross B. Falcone B. Walker D. Mokhtarzadeh M. Walker S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 2003; 100: 845-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), glycogen synthase (16Buschiazzo A. Ugalde J.E. Guerin M.E. Shepard W. Ugalde R.A.

J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 15834-15844Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). To perform their biochemical functions, membrane-binding GTs interact with membranes by two different mechanisms. Whereas integral membrane GTs are permanently attached through transmembrane regions (e.g. hydrophobic α-helices) (18Morita Y.S. Sena C.B. Waller R.F. Kurokawa K. Sernee M.F. Nakatani F. Haites R.E.

Chem. 2006; 281: 25143-25155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) peripheral membrane-binding GTs temporarily bind membranes by (i) a stretch of hydrophobic residues exposed to bulk solvent, (ii) electropositive surface patches that interact with acidic phospholipids (e.g. amphipathic α-helices), and/or (iii) protein-protein interactions (19Lind J.

A close interaction of the enzyme with membranes might be a strict requirement for PI modification by PimA. We recently solved the crystal structure of PimA from Mycobacterium smegmatis (MsPimA) in complex with the donor substrate GDP-Man (23Guerin M.E. Buschiazzo A. Korduláková J. Jackson M. Alzari P.M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. F Struct. Biol. Cryst. Commun. 2005; 61: 518-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 24Guerin M.E. Kordulakova J. Schaeffer F. Svetlikova Z. Buschiazzo A. Giganti D.

The notion of a membrane-associated protein via electrostatic interactions is consistent with the finding of an amphipathic α-helix and surface-exposed hydrophobic residues in the N-terminal domain of MsPimA. Despite the fact that sugar transfer is catalyzed between the mannosyl group of the GDP-Man donor and the myo-inositol ring of PI, the enzyme displays an absolute requirement for both fatty acid chains of PI in order for the transfer reaction to take place. Furthermore, PimA was able to bind monodisperse PI, but its transferase activity was stimulated by high concentrations of nonsubstrate anionic surfactants, indicating that the reaction requires a lipid-water interface. We thus proposed a model of interfacial catalysis in which PimA recognizes the fully acylated substrate PI with its polar head within the catalytic cleft and the fatty acid moieties only partially sequestered from the bulk solvent (24Guerin M.E. Kordulakova J. Schaeffer F. Svetlikova Z. Buschiazzo A. Giganti D. Gicquel B. Mikusova K. Jackson M. Alzari P.M. J. Biol.

This study describes a detailed investigation of the lipid acceptor binding site and the conformational properties of PimA in solution. Using a combination of limited proteolysis, isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), circular dichroism (CD), analytical ultracentrifugation (AUC) and site-directed mutagenesis, we propose a plausible model for substrates recognition and binding. The implications of this model for the comprehension of the early steps of PIM biosynthesis and the catalytic mechanism of other members of the peripheral membrane-binding GT family are discussed. The pimA gene from M. smegmatis (MSMEG_ 2935, Rv2610c, genolist.pasteur.fr/TubercuList/) was subcloned from pQE70-MspimA DNA by standard PCR using oligonucleotide primers pimA_NdeI_Fwd (5′-GGGAATTCCATATGCGTATCGGGATGGTCTGCC-3′) and pimA_ BamHI_Rev (5′-CGCGGATCCTCAGTGATGGTGATGGTGATG-3′) with Phusion DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs). The PCR fragment was digested with NdeI and BamHI and ligated to the expression vector pET29a (Novagen) generating pET29a-MspimA. The recombinant MsPimA (378 residues) has an additional peptide of 8 amino acids (379RSHHHHHH386) at the C terminus that includes a histidine tag. MsPimA and MsPimA mutants were purified to apparent homogeneity by a combination of metal ion affinity, anionic exchange, and gel filtration chromatography steps as described previously (23Guerin M.E. Buschiazzo A. Korduláková J. Jackson M. Alzari P.M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. F Struct. Biol. Cryst. Commun. 2005; 61: 518-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The enzymatic activity of MsPimA and MsPimA mutants was monitored using a radiometric assay. Briefly, the reaction mixture contained 0.0625 μCi of GDP-[C14]Man (specific activity, 305 mCi mmol−1; Amersham Biosciences), membrane preparations from M. smegmatis mc2155 (0.5 mg of proteins) as the source of lipid acceptors, 50 μg of purified MsPimA or MsPimA mutants, and 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, in a final volume of 250 μl. Reactions were incubated for 2 h at 37 °C and stopped with 1.5 ml of CHCl3/CH3OH (2:1 (v/v)). The PIM-containing organic phase was prepared and analyzed by TLC as described by Korduláková et al. (2Korduláková J. Gilleron M. Mikusova K. Puzo G. Brennan P.J. Gicquel B. Jackson M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31335-31344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The bands recorded by a PhosphorImager Typhoon TRIO (GE Healthcare) were quantified using volume integration with the ImageQuant TL v2005 program (GE Healthcare). Gel filtration chromatography was performed using a BioSuite 250 5-μm HR SEC column (Waters Corp.) equilibrated in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, and 150 mm NaCl at 1 ml min−1. The column was previously calibrated using gel filtration standards (Sigma) including Β-amylase (200 kDa), alcohol dehydrogenase (150 kDa), bovine serum albumin (66 kDa), carbonic anhydrase (29 kDa), and cytochrome c (12.4 kDa). Recombinant purified MsPimA (25 μg) was incubated with 0.05 μg of elastase (Sigma) in 100 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, in the presence of 1 mm guanosine, 1 mm GDP (Sigma), 1 mm GDP-Man (Sigma), or 1.25 mm PI (Sigma) for 0–90 min at 37 °C. Aliquots of 12 μl were mixed with 3 μl of 250 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 10% SDS, 50% glycerol, 500 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.01% bromphenol blue at the indicated times. Samples were boiled for 3 min and run onto an SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Protein bands were visualized by staining the gel with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. Proteolytic fragments were electrotransferred to Hybond-P polyvinylidene difluoride (Amersham Biosciences) in 50 mm Trizma base and 50 mm boric acid buffer for 16 h at room temperature. Bands were stained with 0.1% Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 and subjected to N-terminal sequence analysis using an AABI494 protein sequencer (Applied Biosystems). Ligand binding to MsPimA was assayed using the high precision VP-ITC system (MicroCal Inc.) as described previously (24Guerin M.E. Kordulakova J. Schaeffer F. Svetlikova Z. Buschiazzo A. Giganti D.

Miras I. Alzari P.M Béguin P. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 2106-2114Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. The ITC cell (1.4 ml) contained 10 μm MsPimA in 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 5% Me2SO, and the syringe (300 μl) contained 150 μm GDP-Man, 150 μm GDP, or 250 μm guanosine in the same buffer. Binding of PI aggregates to MsPimA-GDP and mutant MsPimAR77E/K78E/K80E/K81E-GDP complexes was assayed as follows. The protein was first titrated with GDP, and at the end of the titration, the solution containing the protein complex was kept in the ITC cell and titrated with 1.25 mm solution of PI in the same buffer preparation. Sample solutions were thoroughly degassed under vacuum, and each titration was performed at 25 °C by one injection of 2 μl followed by 29 injections of 10 μl, with 210 s between injections, using a 290 rpm rotating syringe. Raw heat signal collected with a 16-s filter was corrected for the dilution heat of the ligand in the MsPimA buffer and normalized to the concentration of ligand injected. Data were fit to a bimolecular model (26Wiseman T. Williston S. Brandts J.F. Lin L.N. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 179: 131-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (2407) Google Scholar) using the OriginTM software provided by the manufacturer. Thermal unfolding of MsPimA and of the MsPimA complexes was quantified by DSC using the high precision VP-DSC system (MicroCal Inc.) as described previously (27Hible G. Renault L. Schaeffer F. Christova P. Zoe Radulescu A. Evrin C. Gilles A.M. Cherfils J. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 352: 1044-1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Sample solutions contained 9.5 μm MsPimA alone or mixed with one of the following ligands at a saturating concentration determined by ITC: GDP-Man, 50 μm; GDP, 30 μm; PI, 150 μm (24Guerin M.E.

One protein sample contained both GDP and PI added in this order at the same concentrations as above. Protein and ligands were dissolved in the same buffer preparation (50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, 0.2% Me2SO) and degassed under vacuum for 10 min with gentle stirring prior to being loaded into the calorimetric cell (0.5 ml). Sample solutions were held in situ under a constant external pressure of 25 p.s.i., equilibrated for 30 min at 25 °C, and then heated at a constant rate of 1 °C min−1. Experimental heat capacity functions were collected with a 16-s filter. Data normalization and quantification were carried out with the Origin7 software (28Plotnikov V.V. Brandts J.M. Lin L.N. Brandts J.F. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 250: 237-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) provided by the manufacturer. The partial molar heat capacity (Cp) was derived from the experimental heat capacity by subtraction of the instrumental base line. The partial molar excess heat capacity (Cp,ex) was derived from the Cp function by subtraction of the molar intrinsic heat capacity (Cp,int). Cp,int was calculated as an interpolation over the transition region of the folded and unfolded states weighted in proportion to their relative contributions. For free MsPimA, the partial molar heat capacity of the native state was obtained by linear extrapolation of the pre-transition base line. The partial molar heat capacity of the unfolded state was calculated by summing up the heat capacities of the amino acid residues constituting the polypeptide chain using the known quadratic dependence of Cp of the unfolded state with temperature (29Makhatadze G.I. Privalov P.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 213: 375-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar, 30Griko Y.V. Freire E. Privalov G. Van Dael H. Privalov P.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 252: 447-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) (cf. Fig. 3A, inset). Fitting and deconvolution of Cp,ex required the use of a non-two-state transition model. On free MsPimA unfolding, the observed unfolding enthalpy (ΔHu) measured as the surface under the heat absorption peak (Cp,ex) of the DSC endotherm is the intrinsic unfolding enthalpy of the protein (ΔHu (free) = ΔHu,int (free)). On unfolding of a MsPImA-substrate complex, the observed unfolding enthalpy equals the intrinsic unfolding enthalpy of the protein inside the protein complex minus the substrate binding enthalpy, ΔHu(complex)=ΔHu,int(complex)-ΔHbindEq. 1 The change in ΔHu,int from the free to the bound state of MsPimA then equals ΔΔHu,int(complex)-ΔHu(free)+ΔHbindEq. 2 Values of ΔHbind for the binding of GDP-Man and GDP to free MsPimA were measured by ITC (Fig. 2D). Values of ΔHbind for the binding of PI to free MsPimA (ΔHbind = −1.3 kcal/mol) and to the MsPimA-GDP complex (ΔHbind = 13.6 kcal mol−1) were taken from Guerin et al. (24Guerin M.E. Kordulakova J. Schaeffer F. Svetlikova Z. Buschiazzo A. Giganti D. Gicquel B. Mikusova K. Jackson M. Alzari P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 20705-20714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). From repeated experiments, the value of ΔHbind is ±0.2 kcal/mol. MsPimA thermal unfolding was determined by recording the ellipticity change at 222 nm as a function of the temperature. An Aviv 215 spectropolarimeter was used. The protein sample at 10 μm in 10 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, with or without ligand(s), was placed in a rectangular fused silica cuvette of 0.2-cm path length. The cuvette was inserted in the cell holder with a Peltier temperature control. The sample was heated with a slope of 1 °C min−1, and ellipticity was recorded each 0.5 °C after an equilibration time of 15 s. The CD signal was averaged over 10 s. Each set of data collected was then converted to Δq/ΔT using the first derivative converter available in the software of the CD instrument with a window of 11 data points and a second degree polynomial smoothing. The observed difference in T½ between the CD and DSC melting curves was shown to result from the difference in the phosphate buffer concentration (data not shown). AUC experiments were performed with a Beckman XL-1 analytical ultracentrifuge using absorbance optics. Velocity measurements utilized a two-sector charcoal-filled Epon centerpieces, quartz windows, 400-μl sample, and 420-μl reference (buffer: 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl) volumes. All samples were centrifuged in a Beckman 8-hole An50Ti rotor at 22 °C at 40,000 rpm, and the data were collected at 280 nm with a radial increment of 0.003 cm for ∼6 h. Velocity data were edited and analyzed using the boundary analysis method of Demeler and van Holde as implemented in Ultrascan, version 7.3 for Windows (31Demeler B. Behlke J. Ristau O.

Sedimentation coefficients (s) are reported in Svedberg units (S), where 1 S = 1 × 10−13 s, and were corrected to that of water at 20 °C (s20,w). The partial specific volume of full-length MsPimA was calculated from the amino acid sequence within Ultrascan. Modeling of hydrodynamic parameters was performed using Ultrascan. The frictional ratio (f/f0) was calculated from the known molecular mass and the measured sedimentation coefficient using Ultrascan. Structural alignments of MsPimA (PDB code 1GEJ) with CgMshA (PDB code 3C4V), WaaG (PDB code 2IV7), WaaF (PDB code 1PSW), WaaC (PDB code 2H1F), MurG (PDB code 1NLM) and GumK (PDB code 3CV3) were performed by the distance alignment matrix method using DALI Lite (33Holm L. Park J. Bioinformatics. 2000; 16: 566-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (771) Google Scholar). The images were generated with PyMOL, version 0.99 (34DeLano W.L. The PyMOL Molecular Graphics System. DeLano Scientific, San Carlos, CA2003Google Scholar). We used the program ICM, version 3.6 (35Abagyan R.A. Totrov M.M. Kuznetsov D.N. J. Comp. Chem. 1994; 15: 488-506Crossref Scopus (1327) Google Scholar), to dock Ins-P to the structure of the MsPimA-GDP-Man complex (PDB code 2GEJ). Interaction grids were calculated in the acceptor binding site after the preliminary selection of key residues chosen within 6 Å of the reactive axial oxygen of the mannose moiety. Ins-P and GDP-Man input files were extracted from the PubChem data base (pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov). Both structures were protonated and optimized, and all water molecules were removed from the receptor using standard ICM protocols. The thoroughness parameter was set to a value of 2 to increase the Monte Carlo steps and ensure a greatest exploration. The best solution showed a predicted energy below 60 kcal m−1 and was used for structural analysis. M. smegmatis pimA was subcloned in the pET29a expression vector (Novagen) using the NdeI and BamHI restriction sites, allowing for the production of a C-terminal His6-tagged fusion protein. The mutants MsPimAQ18A, MsPimAY62A, MsPimAN63A, MsPimAS65A, MsPimAR68A, MsPimAR70A, MsPimAN97A, MsPimAT119A, MsPimAK123A, MsPimAR196A, MsPimAE199A, and MsPimAR77E/K78E/K80E/K81E were generated by the two-step PCR overlap method using Phusion high-fidelity DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs) and pET29a-MspimA as the DNA template. The flanking oligonucleotides that annealed with the NdeI and BamHI sites were pimA_NdeI_Fwd and pimA_BamHI_Rev, respectively. The overlapping oligonucleotides for each mutant are described in supplemental Table 1S. The 1100-bp fragments obtained were digested with NdeI/BamHI and ligated to pET29a treated with the same enzymes. All plasmids were sequenced at the Proteomics and Metabolomics Facility at Colorado State University. A two-step homologous recombination procedure was used earlier to provide evidence of the essentiality of pimA in M. smegmatis (2Korduláková J. Gilleron M. Mikusova K. Puzo G. Brennan P.J. Gicquel B.

In the course of this experiment, strains having undergone a single crossover at the pimA locus were easily isolated, but it was shown that a second crossover leading to gene knock-out was achievable only in the presence of a rescue wild-type copy of pimA carried by a replicative plasmid. To determine whether the MsPimAR77E/K78E/K80E/K81E mutant encoded an active enzyme in mycobacteria, a mycobacteria/Escherichia coli shuttle plasmid (pVV16) expressing this gene was tested for its ability to serve as a rescue plasmid in the gene knock-out experiment. A pVV16 construct carrying a wild-type copy of the pimA gene from M. smegmatis was used as a positive control, and the empty pVV16 plasmid served as the negative control in this experiment (2Korduláková J.

To study the effect of substrate binding on the conformation of PimA, we first determined the oligomeric state of MsPimA in solution by subjecting the purified protein to size exclusion chromatography (supplementalFig. 1S). Results showed that MsPimA is a monomer with no sign of higher order oligomers in the purified preparation. The monomeric state of the full-length protein"

Under low oxygen, Sre1 is cleaved from its inactive ER precursor form to generate an active nuclear transcription factor that up-regulates genes required for low oxygen growth. To maintain a constant supply of Sre1, Sre1 precursor synthesis must be regulated to replenish Sre1 precursor lost to proteolytic cleavage under low oxygen. In this study, we investigated the mechanisms controlling Sre1 precursor levels. We found that positive feedback regulation at the sre1+ promoter increases the synthesis of the Sre1 precursor under low oxygen and that this regulation is required for maximal Sre1 activation and target gene expression. We also demonstrate that the Sre1 precursor is rapidly degraded by the proteasome in the absence of its binding partner Scp1, which is required for oxygen-regulated Sre1 cleavage. Degradation of Sre1 in the absence of Scp1 requires the ER-associated degradation (ERAD) components Ubc7, an E2 ubiquitin conjugating enzyme, and Hrd1, an E3 ubiquitin ligase. We conclude that positive feedback regulation to up-regulate Sre1 precursor synthesis under low oxygen is essential for Sre1 function and propose that excess Sre1 precursor is removed by ERAD to ensure complex formation between Sre1 and its binding partner Scp1. Thus, Sre1 is a new example of an endogenous ERAD substrate, establishing fission yeast as an organism for the study of this important degradative pathway.

SREBPs are ER-membrane bound, basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors that control expression of genes required for uptake and synthesis of cholesterol under sterol limiting conditions (2Espenshade P.J. Hughes A.L. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2007; 41: 401-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). SREBP forms a tight complex with its binding partner Scap (SREBP cleavage activating protein). When sterol levels are low, Scap escorts SREBP to the Golgi where SREBP is sequentially cleaved by Site 1 and Site 2 proteases to release the N-terminal transcription factor domain (3Goldstein J.L. DeBose-Boyd R.A. Brown M.S. Cell. 2006; 124: 35-46Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1205) Google Scholar). Sterols regulate access of SREBP to the Golgi-localized proteases by controlling entrance of SREBP-Scap into ER transport vesicles (4Nohturfft A. Yabe D. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Espenshade P.J. Cell. 2000; 102: 315-323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Following SREBP cleavage in the Golgi, Scap is thought to recycle to the ER and bind to newly synthesized SREBP to participate in additional rounds of cleavage (2Espenshade P.J. Hughes A.L. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2007; 41: 401-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar).In fission yeast, Sre1 is proteolytically cleaved and activated in response to low oxygen (1Hughes A.L. Todd B.L. Espenshade P.J. Cell. 2005; 120: 831-842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Under low oxygen conditions, oxygen-dependent ergosterol synthesis is inhibited, leading to Sre1 cleavage and release of the N-terminal transcription factor domain (Sre1N). In addition, oxygen also controls the degradation of Sre1N. In the presence of oxygen, the prolyl hydroxylase family member Ofd1 accelerates the turnover of Sre1N (5Hughes B.T. Espenshade P.J. EMBO J. 2008; 27: 1491-1501PubMed Google Scholar). In the absence of oxygen, Ofd1 is inhibited leading to rapid accumulation of cleaved Sre1N and expression of Sre1 target genes. Sre1 activates expression of genes in pathways involved in non-respiratory oxygen consumption required for low oxygen growth (6Todd B.L. Stewart E.V. Burg J.S. Hughes A.L. Espenshade P.J. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 26: 2817-2831Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar).Like mammalian SREBP, activation of Sre1 also requires binding to Scap, called Scp1 in fission yeast (1Hughes A.L. Todd B.L. Espenshade P.J. Cell. 2005; 120: 831-842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Scap contains a sterol sensing domain in transmembrane domains 2–6 that is required for sterol-regulated cleavage of SREBPs (2Espenshade P.J. Hughes A.L. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2007; 41: 401-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). Interestingly, in both yeast and mammals, the SREBP precursor is reduced in the absence of Scap (1Hughes A.L. Todd B.L.

The mechanism by which the SREBP precursor is regulated in the absence of Scap is unknown.Both luminal and membrane-bound ER proteins are subject to quality control and misfolded proteins are degraded by a process termed ER-associated protein degradation (ERAD) (8Ellgaard L. Helenius A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 181-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (1654) Google Scholar). ERAD involves recognition and polyubiquitination of misfolded protein substrates, extraction from the ER, and degradation by the proteasome (9Hampton R.Y. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2002; 14: 476-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar, 10Meusser B. Hirsch C. Jarosch E. Sommer T. Nat.

In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the ERAD pathway involves two ubiquitin ligases, Hrd1p and Doa10p, both of which contain cytosolic RING finger domains (12Nakatsukasa K. Brodsky J.L. Traffic. 2008; 9: 861-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Hrd1p is required for degradation of protein substrates with misfolded ER-luminal or membrane domains and Doa10p is required for degradation of proteins with misfolded cytosolic domains (13Carvalho P. Goder V. Rapoport T.A. Cell. 2006; 126: 361-373Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar, 14Huyer G. Piluek W.F. Fansler Z. Kreft S.G. Hochstrasser M. Brodsky J.L.

Both the Hrd1p and Doa10p E3 ubiquitin ligases can catalyze the polyubiquitination of substrates through the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme Ubc7p (15Kostova Z. Tsai Y.C. Weissman A.M. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2007; 18: 770-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). In the sterol pathway, S. cerevisiae Hrd1 and the mammalian E3 ligase gp78 catalyze the ubiquitination and degradation of the sterol biosynthetic enzyme HMG-CoA reductase in sterol-overloaded cells (9Hampton R.Y. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2002; 14: 476-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar, 16Song B.L. Javitt N.B. DeBose-Boyd R.A. Cell Metab. 2005; 1: 179-189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). In addition, gp78 mediates sterol-regulated degradation of Insig-1, a central regulator of cholesterol homeostasis (17Lee J.N. Song B. DeBose-Boyd R.A. Ye J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 39308-39315Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Therefore, ERAD functions in the physiological regulated degradation of proteins as well as degradation of misfolded proteins.Our previous studies revealed that oxygen controls Sre1 proteolytic activation and nuclear Sre1 protein stability to regulate Sre1-dependent target gene expression (1Hughes A.L. Todd B.L. Espenshade P.J. Cell. 2005; 120: 831-842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 5Hughes B.T. Espenshade P.J. EMBO J. 2008; 27: 1491-1501PubMed Google Scholar). However, to achieve sustained activation of Sre1 target genes under low oxygen, cleaved Sre1N must be continually produced from the Sre1 precursor. Here, we investigated the mechanisms regulating Sre1 precursor levels independent of oxygen-regulated proteolytic cleavage. We found that positive feedback regulation of the sre1+ promoter is necessary to maintain Sre1 precursor levels and is required for maximal Sre1 activation and function. We also demonstrate that Sre1 precursor levels are dependent upon Scp1. In the absence of Scp1, the Sre1 precursor is rapidly degraded by the proteasome in a mechanism requiring the ERAD components, Ubc7 and Hrd1. These results demonstrate that positive feedback is required for Sre1 pathway function and suggest that Sre1 is an endogenous substrate for ER-associated degradation.DISCUSSIONUnder low oxygen, Sre1-dependent target gene expression increases due to proteolytic cleavage of the Sre1 precursor and stabilization of nuclear Sre1N (1Hughes A.L. Todd B.L. Espenshade P.J. Cell. 2005; 120: 831-842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 5Hughes B.T. Espenshade P.J. EMBO J. 2008; 27: 1491-1501PubMed Google Scholar). However, to achieve sustained activation of Sre1 target genes Sre1N must be continually produced from the Sre1 precursor by proteolytic cleavage. Here, we investigated the mechanisms by which the Sre1 precursor is regulated independent of oxygen-regulated proteolytic cleavage. Previously, we showed that Sre1 up-regulates its own expression by a positive feedback mechanism (5Hughes B.T. Espenshade P.J. EMBO J. 2008; 27: 1491-1501PubMed Google Scholar, 6Todd B.L. Stewart E.V. Burg J.S. Hughes A.L. Espenshade P.J. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 26: 2817-2831Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Using a yeast strain containing engineered mutations in the sre1+ promoter, we found here that positive feedback regulation of Sre1 synthesis is required for sustained activation of Sre1N under low oxygen and growth of cells on cobalt chloride medium (Fig. 1). These data highlight the importance of this positive feedback regulation for Sre1 pathway function.We also investigated mechanisms regulating Sre1 precursor degradation. We found that in the absence of the Sre1-binding partner Scp1, the Sre1 precursor is rapidly degraded by the proteasome (FIGURE 2, FIGURE 3). Moreover, this degradation requires Ubc7 and Hrd1, known components of the ERAD pathway, and the Sre1 precursor formed a specific complex with Hrd1 (FIGURE 4, FIGURE 5) (12Nakatsukasa K. Brodsky J.L. Traffic. 2008; 9: 861-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Finally, we showed that Sre1 is an endogenous substrate for the Ubc7-Hrd1 pathway in wild-type cells (Fig. 6). These data suggest that Sre1 is a substrate for the E3 ubiquitin ligase Hrd1. However, to date we have been unable to detect Sre1 ubiquitinylation, leaving alternate explanations for the Hrd1-dependent degradation of Sre1.Our data support a model in which there are three primary ways to regulate Sre1 precursor (Fig. 7): 1) synthesis of the Sre1 precursor is controlled by positive feedback regulation; 2) the E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme Ubc7 and the E3 ubiquitin ligase Hrd1 mediate the proteasomal degradation of Sre1 precursor not bound to Scp1; and 3) the Sre1 precursor is subject to Scp1-dependent cleavage under low oxygen to produce Sre1N (1Hughes A.L. Todd B.L. Espenshade P.J. Cell. 2005; 120: 831-842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 6Todd B.L. Stewart E.V. Burg J.S. Hughes A.L. Espenshade P.J. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 26: 2817-2831Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). In the ER, the Sre1 precursor exists as either free Sre1 or Sre1-Scp1 complex (Fig. 7, middle). Under low oxygen, Sre1 bound to Scp1 is proteolytically cleaved to release Sre1N, the N-terminal transcription factor domain. Sre1N enters the nucleus and up-regulates sre1+ expression by a positive feedback mechanism that results in increased synthesis of the Sre1 precursor and sustained cleavage under low oxygen (Fig. 1).In this study, we also demonstrated that Sre1 is highly unstable in the absence of Scp1 and is degraded by the proteasome via the Ubc7-Hrd1 pathway (FIGURE 2, FIGURE 3, FIGURE 4, FIGURE 5). Based on these data, we hypothesize that free Sre1 is recognized as a misfolded, orphan subunit and is degraded by an ERAD-like mechanism requiring Ubc7 and Hrd1 (Fig. 7, step 2) (8Ellgaard L. Helenius A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 181-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (1654) Google Scholar, 12Nakatsukasa K. Brodsky J.L. Traffic. 2008; 9: 861-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Similar degradative mechanisms control hetero-oligomeric complex formation of the acetylcholine receptor, immunoglobulins, major histocompatibility complex class I molecules, and the yeast SNARE Ufe1 (8Ellgaard L. Helenius A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 181-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (1654) Google Scholar, 28Braun S. Jentsch S. EMBO Rep. 2007; 8: 1176-1182Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). By interacting with Scp1, Sre1 is no longer recognized as misfolded and is protected from proteasomal destruction. Importantly, the rapid degradation of free Sre1 ensures that Sre1 exists in a complex with Scp1, thereby guaranteeing that Sre1 cleavage is regulated by Scp1 and oxygen supply. Given that the Sre1 precursor is a physiological substrate for ER quality control, our studies establish fission yeast as a new organism for the dissection of this important degradative pathway.Like fission yeast Sre1, mammalian SREBP precursor is also reduced in the absence of Scap, likely due to decreased protein stability (7Rawson R.B. DeBose-Boyd R. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28549-28556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). It is unknown whether an ERAD-like mechanism also controls this degradation. Interestingly, overexpression of the ER-associated ubiquitin ligase TRC8 decreased expression of the SREBP target genes encoding HMG-CoA reductase and fatty-acid synthase in HEK293 cells, implicating TRC8 in regulation of SREBP activity (29Brauweiler A.

Additional studies are required to delineate the pathways regulating SREBP protein stability in mammalian cells and the potential role for TRC8 in this process. Activation of low oxygen gene expression in Schizosaccharomyces pombe is primarily controlled by the Sre1 transcription factor.

Under low oxygen conditions, oxygen-dependent ergosterol synthesis is inhibited, leading to Sre1 cleavage and release of the N-terminal transcription factor domain (Sre1N). In addition, oxygen also controls the degradation of Sre1N. In the presence of oxygen, the prolyl hydroxylase family member Ofd1 accelerates the turnover of Sre1N (5Hughes B.T. Espenshade P.J. EMBO J. 2008; 27: 1491-1501PubMed Google Scholar). In the absence of oxygen, Ofd1 is inhibited leading to rapid accumulation of cleaved Sre1N and expression of Sre1 target genes. Sre1 activates expression of genes in pathways involved in non-respiratory oxygen consumption required for low oxygen growth (6Todd B.L. Stewart E.V. Burg J.S. Hughes A.L. Espenshade P.J. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 26: 2817-2831Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Like mammalian SREBP, activation of Sre1 also requires binding to Scap, called Scp1 in fission yeast (1Hughes A.L. Todd B.L. Espenshade P.J. Cell. 2005; 120: 831-842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Scap contains a sterol sensing domain in transmembrane domains 2–6 that is required for sterol-regulated cleavage of SREBPs (2Espenshade P.J. Hughes A.L. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2007; 41: 401-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). Interestingly, in both yeast and mammals, the SREBP precursor is reduced in the absence of Scap (1Hughes A.L. Todd B.L. Espenshade P.J. Cell. 2005; 120: 831-842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 7Rawson R.B. DeBose-Boyd R. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28549-28556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which the SREBP precursor is regulated in the absence of Scap is unknown. Both luminal and membrane-bound ER proteins are subject to quality control and misfolded proteins are degraded by a process termed ER-associated protein degradation (ERAD) (8Ellgaard L. Helenius A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 181-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (1654) Google Scholar). ERAD involves recognition and polyubiquitination of misfolded protein substrates, extraction from the ER, and degradation by the proteasome (9Hampton R.Y. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2002; 14: 476-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar, 10Meusser B. Hirsch C. Jarosch E. Sommer T. Nat. Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 766-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (983) Google Scholar, 11Sayeed A. Ng D.T. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2005; 40: 75-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the ERAD pathway involves two ubiquitin ligases, Hrd1p and Doa10p, both of which contain cytosolic RING finger domains (12Nakatsukasa K. Brodsky J.L. Traffic. 2008; 9: 861-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Hrd1p is required for degradation of protein substrates with misfolded ER-luminal or membrane domains and Doa10p is required for degradation of proteins with misfolded cytosolic domains (13Carvalho P. Goder V. Rapoport T.A. Cell. 2006; 126: 361-373Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar, 14Huyer G. Piluek W.F. Fansler Z. Kreft S.G. Hochstrasser M. Brodsky J.L. Michaelis S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 38369-38378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Both the Hrd1p and Doa10p E3 ubiquitin ligases can catalyze the polyubiquitination of substrates through the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme Ubc7p (15Kostova Z. Tsai Y.C. Weissman A.M. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2007; 18: 770-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). In the sterol pathway, S. cerevisiae Hrd1 and the mammalian E3 ligase gp78 catalyze the ubiquitination and degradation of the sterol biosynthetic enzyme HMG-CoA reductase in sterol-overloaded cells (9Hampton R.Y. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2002; 14: 476-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar, 16Song B.L. Javitt N.B. DeBose-Boyd R.A. Cell Metab. 2005; 1: 179-189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). In addition, gp78 mediates sterol-regulated degradation of Insig-1, a central regulator of cholesterol homeostasis (17Lee J.N. Song B. DeBose-Boyd R.A. Ye J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 39308-39315Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Therefore, ERAD functions in the physiological regulated degradation of proteins as well as degradation of misfolded proteins. Our previous studies revealed that oxygen controls Sre1 proteolytic activation and nuclear Sre1 protein stability to regulate Sre1-dependent target gene expression (1Hughes A.L. Todd B.L. Espenshade P.J. Cell. 2005; 120: 831-842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 5Hughes B.T. Espenshade P.J. EMBO J. 2008; 27: 1491-1501PubMed Google Scholar). However, to achieve sustained activation of Sre1 target genes under low oxygen, cleaved Sre1N must be continually produced from the Sre1 precursor. Here, we investigated the mechanisms regulating Sre1 precursor levels independent of oxygen-regulated proteolytic cleavage. We found that positive feedback regulation of the sre1+ promoter is necessary to maintain Sre1 precursor levels and is required for maximal Sre1 activation and function. We also demonstrate that Sre1 precursor levels are dependent upon Scp1. In the absence of Scp1, the Sre1 precursor is rapidly degraded by the proteasome in a mechanism requiring the ERAD components, Ubc7 and Hrd1. These results demonstrate that positive feedback is required for Sre1 pathway function and suggest that Sre1 is an endogenous substrate for ER-associated degradation. DISCUSSIONUnder low oxygen, Sre1-dependent target gene expression increases due to proteolytic cleavage of the Sre1 precursor and stabilization of nuclear Sre1N (1Hughes A.L. Todd B.L. Espenshade P.J. Cell. 2005; 120: 831-842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 5Hughes B.T. Espenshade P.J. EMBO J. 2008; 27: 1491-1501PubMed Google Scholar). However, to achieve sustained activation of Sre1 target genes Sre1N must be continually produced from the Sre1 precursor by proteolytic cleavage. Here, we investigated the mechanisms by which the Sre1 precursor is regulated independent of oxygen-regulated proteolytic cleavage. Previously, we showed that Sre1 up-regulates its own expression by a positive feedback mechanism (5Hughes B.T. Espenshade P.J. EMBO J. 2008; 27: 1491-1501PubMed Google Scholar, 6Todd B.L. Stewart E.V. Burg J.S. Hughes A.L. Espenshade P.J. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 26: 2817-2831Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Using a yeast strain containing engineered mutations in the sre1+ promoter, we found here that positive feedback regulation of Sre1 synthesis is required for sustained activation of Sre1N under low oxygen and growth of cells on cobalt chloride medium (Fig. 1). These data highlight the importance of this positive feedback regulation for Sre1 pathway function.We also investigated mechanisms regulating Sre1 precursor degradation. We found that in the absence of the Sre1-binding partner Scp1, the Sre1 precursor is rapidly degraded by the proteasome (FIGURE 2, FIGURE 3). Moreover, this degradation requires Ubc7 and Hrd1, known components of the ERAD pathway, and the Sre1 precursor formed a specific complex with Hrd1 (FIGURE 4, FIGURE 5) (12Nakatsukasa K. Brodsky J.L. Traffic. 2008; 9: 861-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Finally, we showed that Sre1 is an endogenous substrate for the Ubc7-Hrd1 pathway in wild-type cells (Fig. 6). These data suggest that Sre1 is a substrate for the E3 ubiquitin ligase Hrd1. However, to date we have been unable to detect Sre1 ubiquitinylation, leaving alternate explanations for the Hrd1-dependent degradation of Sre1.Our data support a model in which there are three primary ways to regulate Sre1 precursor (Fig. 7): 1) synthesis of the Sre1 precursor is controlled by positive feedback regulation; 2) the E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme Ubc7 and the E3 ubiquitin ligase Hrd1 mediate the proteasomal degradation of Sre1 precursor not bound to Scp1; and 3) the Sre1 precursor is subject to Scp1-dependent cleavage under low oxygen to produce Sre1N (1Hughes A.L. Todd B.L. Espenshade P.J. Cell. 2005; 120: 831-842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 6Todd B.L. Stewart E.V. Burg J.S. Hughes A.L. Espenshade P.J. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 26: 2817-2831Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). In the ER, the Sre1 precursor exists as either free Sre1 or Sre1-Scp1 complex (Fig. 7, middle). Under low oxygen, Sre1 bound to Scp1 is proteolytically cleaved to release Sre1N, the N-terminal transcription factor domain. Sre1N enters the nucleus and up-regulates sre1+ expression by a positive feedback mechanism that results in increased synthesis of the Sre1 precursor and sustained cleavage under low oxygen (Fig. 1).In this study, we also demonstrated that Sre1 is highly unstable in the absence of Scp1 and is degraded by the proteasome via the Ubc7-Hrd1 pathway (FIGURE 2, FIGURE 3, FIGURE 4, FIGURE 5). Based on these data, we hypothesize that free Sre1 is recognized as a misfolded, orphan subunit and is degraded by an ERAD-like mechanism requiring Ubc7 and Hrd1 (Fig. 7, step 2) (8Ellgaard L. Helenius A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 181-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (1654) Google Scholar, 12Nakatsukasa K. Brodsky J.L. Traffic. 2008; 9: 861-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Similar degradative mechanisms control hetero-oligomeric complex formation of the acetylcholine receptor, immunoglobulins, major histocompatibility complex class I molecules, and the yeast SNARE Ufe1 (8Ellgaard L. Helenius A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 181-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (1654) Google Scholar, 28Braun S. Jentsch S. EMBO Rep. 2007; 8: 1176-1182Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). By interacting with Scp1, Sre1 is no longer recognized as misfolded and is protected from proteasomal destruction. Importantly, the rapid degradation of free Sre1 ensures that Sre1 exists in a complex with Scp1, thereby guaranteeing that Sre1 cleavage is regulated by Scp1 and oxygen supply. Given that the Sre1 precursor is a physiological substrate for ER quality control, our studies establish fission yeast as a new organism for the dissection of this important degradative pathway.Like fission yeast Sre1, mammalian SREBP precursor is also reduced in the absence of Scap, likely due to decreased protein stability (7Rawson R.B. DeBose-Boyd R. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28549-28556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). It is unknown whether an ERAD-like mechanism also controls this degradation. Interestingly, overexpression of the ER-associated ubiquitin ligase TRC8 decreased expression of the SREBP target genes encoding HMG-CoA reductase and fatty-acid synthase in HEK293 cells, implicating TRC8 in regulation of SREBP activity (29Brauweiler A.

Additional studies are required to delineate the pathways regulating SREBP protein stability in mammalian cells and the potential role for TRC8 in this process. Under low oxygen, Sre1-dependent target gene expression increases due to proteolytic cleavage of the Sre1 precursor and stabilization of nuclear Sre1N (1Hughes A.L. Todd B.L. Espenshade P.J.

In addition to various domains corresponding to other P-type ATPases, ATP7B includes an N terminus extension (NMBD) with six copper binding sites.

In principle, the P-type denomination applies to enzymes that sustain hydrolytic cleavage of phosphorylated substrates, with a catalytic mechanism including intermediate phosphorylation of the Asp residue within an invariant DKTG motif. Although this mechanism extends to the large family of halogenases (7Burroughs A.M. Allen K.N. Dunaway-Mariano D. Aravind L. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 361: 1003-1034Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar), “P-type ATPase” refers to membrane-bound enzymes that couple ATP utilization to cation transport, and are divided into five subfamilies depending on cation specificity and other features of structure and function (8Lutsenko S.

Acta. 1998; 1365: 37-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). The ATP7A and ATP7B copper ATPases are included in the P1-subfamily, which is selective for soft and transition metals. In addition to a putative transmembrane metal binding motif (TMBS), 2The abbreviations used are: TMBStransmembrane metal binding siteSERCA1sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPaseNMBDN-terminal metal binding domainMOPS3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acidBCSbathocuproine disulfonateBCAbicinchoninic acidMSmass spectrometryMS/MStandem MSTM6transmembrane 6CMVcytomegalovirusPBSphosphate-buffered salineMES4-morpholineethanesulfonic acidDTTdithiothreitolGFPgreen fluorescent protein. 2The abbreviations used are: TMBStransmembrane metal binding siteSERCA1sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPaseNMBDN-terminal metal binding domainMOPS3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acidBCSbathocuproine disulfonateBCAbicinchoninic acidMSmass spectrometryMS/MStandem MSTM6transmembrane 6CMVcytomegalovirusPBSphosphate-buffered salineMES4-morpholineethanesulfonic acidDTTdithiothreitolGFPgreen fluorescent protein. corresponding to the cation binding/transport sites of other P-ATPases, ATP7A and ATP7B possess a specific N terminus extension (NMBD) that includes six (CXXC) metal binding sites that may be involved in enzyme activation. Furthermore, phosphorylation of the ATP7A and ATP7B proteins may modulate the functional behavior of the enzyme, in addition to forming a catalytic intermediate (10Vanderwerf S.M. Cooper M.J. Stetsenko I.V. Lutsenko S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36289-36294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). These specific structural features, as well as various interactions with chaperones and targeting sites, render characterization of ATP7A and ATP7B rather complex. It is useful to obtain ATP7B protein by heterologous expression in cell cultures, to perform functional characterization of the enzyme in its native form, and subsequent analysis by site-directed mutagenesis. In fact, heterologous expression in insect cells, and initial characterization, were obtained by Tsivkoskii et al. (11Tsivkovskii R. Eisses J.F. Kaplan J.H. Lutsenko S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 976-983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) and Hung et al. (12Hung Y.H. Layton M.J. Voskoboinik I. Mercer J.F. Camakaris J. Biochem.

We report here high yield expression of WT and mutant ATP7B in COS1 cells infected with adenovirus vector, and functional characterization of membrane-bound ATPase obtained with the microsomal fraction of infected cells. The microsomal protein sustains a copper-dependent steady-state ATPase rate of 30 nmol/per mg of protein per minute at pH 6 and 37 °C, in the presence of 1 mm ATP. We demonstrate by proteolysis and mass spectrometry that, in addition to the invariant DKTG motif undergoing phosphorylation as a catalytic cycle intermediate in other P-type ATPases, the recombinant enzyme undergoes copper-dependent phosphorylation of four serine residues.DISCUSSIONThe ATP7B protein presents sequence homologies that are conserved through all P-ATPases, including residues within the nucleotide binding (“N”) domain and the phosphorylation (“P”) domain. Therefore, it is tempting to assume that the catalytic and transport mechanism is analogous to that of well characterized cation transport ATPases, such as the Ca2+ ATPase (SERCA) and the Na+/K+ ATPase (8Lutsenko S.

In fact, copper-dependent phosphorylation of recombinant ATP7B protein by utilization of ATP has been reported (11Tsivkovskii R. Eisses J.F. Kaplan J.H. Lutsenko S. J. Biol.

Here we confirm occurrence of phosphorylation, and, taking advantage of the high yield expression, we demonstrate the copper dependence (Fig. 4) and define the time course of phosphoenzyme formation as well as its decay following a chase with non-radioactive ATP (FIGURE 6, FIGURE 7). The kinetics of phosphoenzyme formation is diphasic, with an alkali-labile fraction formed within the first 2 min of reaction. The alkali-labile phosphoenzyme is not obtained with the D1027N (putative catalytic phosphorylation site) mutant or C983A/C985A (putative transmembrane copper site at TM6) mutant. This demonstrates its identity as a phosphorylated intermediate analogous to that found in other P-type ATPases, which involves phosphorylation of an aspartyl residue within a conserved sequence of the P domain, and requires activation by copper bound to the transmembrane site. In addition, the phosphoenzyme undergoes diphasic decay, and the alkali-labile fraction decays in the early phase (Fig. 6A). This early decays is not observed when the D1027N or C983A/C985A mutant is used (Fig. 6, C and D). Finally, we find that the Pi release obtained following addition of [γ-32P]ATP to ATP7B begins in concomitance with the fast phase of phosphoenzyme formation and continues at a linear rate thereafter (Fig. 7). This indicates that the phosphoenzyme formed within the fast phase is the catalytic intermediate. In fact, if the high level of [32P]phosphoenzyme formed in the slower phase were a catalytic intermediate, Pi release would occur with a lag period, acquiring high rate only after maximal levels of phosphoenzyme are reached. It is noteworthy that the phosphorylated ATP7B protein is only partially degraded by alkaline pH, whereas the Ca2+ ATPase phosphoenzyme is totally degraded (Fig. 4). Finally, consider that the phosphorylation levels exceed the stoichiometry of the ATP7B protein present in the microsomal preparation (see “Results”), indicating phosphorylation in excess of one residue per ATP7B molecule and heterogeneity of the phosphorylation sites.Both transient and steady-state measurements indicate a very low rate of hydrolytic cleavage, which is approximately two orders of magnitude lower than that obtained in comparable experiments performed with the Ca2+ ATPase (SERCA1) under the same conditions (22Fernandez-Belda F. Kurzmack M. Inesi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 9687-9698Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, it should be pointed out that hydrolytic cleavage of the SERCA phosphoenzyme is strongly reduced when the Ca2+ concentration is raised above the millimolar concentration. This phenomenon, referred to as “back inhibition,” is due to interference with net dissociation of bound Ca2+ from the transport sites, whereby the phosphoenzyme is restricted from shifting to the calcium free state, which is the state undergoing hydrolytic cleavage. In the case of ATP7B, we consider unlikely that strongly bound copper is easily released as free Cu+ from the phosphoenzyme into the medium creating a concentration gradient (25Kim B.E. Nevitt T. Thiele D.J. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2008; 4: 176-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (878) Google Scholar), but may be rather released to a specific acceptor for copper dissociation from the TMBS under physiological conditions (26Lutsenko S. Gupta A. Burkhead J.L. Zuzel V. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2008; 476: 22-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Therefore, cleavage of ATP7B phosphoenzyme in our conditions may be “back-inhibited” by the prolonged on time of copper bound to the TMBS. On the other hand, when we add a copper chelator (Fig. 6B), phosphoenzyme decay is totally inhibited, because copper is dissociated not only from the TMBS but also from the NMBD. In fact, it was shown that in bacterial CopA dissociation of copper allows interaction of empty NMBD with the A domain, with consequent inhibition of phosphoenzyme decay (30Hatori Y. Hirata A. Toyoshima C. Lewis D. Pilankatta R. Inesi G. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 22541-22549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). A most important conclusion is that activation of ATP7B depends on copper binding to the TMBS as well as to the NMBD.Another aspect of our experiments is related to identification of residues undergoing phosphorylation at rates lower than the phosphoenzyme intermediate, and reaching levels higher than the enzyme stoichiometry in the microsomal preparation. In fact, evidence for a phosphorylation site between Met796 and Ser1384 of ATP7B within liver cells in situ was previously reported (10Vanderwerf S.M. Cooper M.J. Stetsenko I.V. Lutsenko S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36289-36294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), and the possible phosphorylation of several residues in recombinant ATP7B was indicated (27Vanderwerf S.M. Lutsenko S. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2002; 30: 739-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 28Bartee M.Y. Ralle M. Lutsenko S. Biochemistry. 2009; 48: 5573-5581Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Taking advantage of the high yield expression of ATP7B in COS-1 cells infected with rAdATP7Bmyc, we proceeded to identify by phosphoproteomic analysis and mass spectrometry the specific residues undergoing copper-dependent phosphorylation upon addition of ATP to our microsomal preparations. We found that Ser478 and Ser481 were phosphorylated within the NMBD, Ser1121 within the N domain, and Ser1453 within the C terminus (Fig. 11). Reliable phosphorylation signal on Asp1027, the putative residue undergoing phosphorylation as an intermediate in the catalytic cycle, was not detected. This is possibly due to hydrolytic cleavage during the long procedure of proteolysis, peptide separation, and mass spectrometry. It is noteworthy that a fairly high phosphorylation level of the serine residues was already found even before incubation of the microsomes with ATP in vitro, indicating occurrence of phosphorylation within the cultured cells in situ. Therefore, the slow phosphorylation of serine residues with [γ-32P]ATP in vitro reflects a requirement for dephosphorylation before exchange with [32P]PO4 can take place. In fact, incubation of microsomes with phosphatase previous to exposure to [γ-32P]ATP increases early formation of [32P]phosphoenzyme (Fig. 10).It has been proposed that phosphorylation of serine residues plays an important role in copper homeostasis, promoting functional interactions of cuproenzymes (2Veldhuis N.A. Gaeth A.P. Pearson R.B. Gabriel K. Camakaris J. Biometals. 2009; 22: 177-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). It is noteworthy that phosphorylation of ATP7B in human cells is copper-dependent (10Vanderwerf S.M. Cooper M.J. Stetsenko I.V. Lutsenko S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36289-36294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), and this phosphorylation appears to play an important role in copper homeostasis and ATP7B trafficking within the cell. In agreement with these findings, we find that phosphorylation of recombinant ATP7B in our microsomal preparation is totally copper-dependent. It is possible that ATP7B phosphorylation sites become exposed as a consequence of copper-induced conformational changes (2Veldhuis N.A. Gaeth A.P. Pearson R.B. Gabriel K. Camakaris J. Biometals. 2009; 22: 177-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). It is also apparent that serine phosphorylation plays a role in regulation of the copper ATPase catalytic cycle. In fact, it was reported that the activity of yeast copper ATPase Ccc2p is regulated by Ser258 phosphorylation (29Valverde R.H. Morin I. Lowe J. Mintz E. Cuillel M. Vieyra A. FEBS Lett. 2008; 582: 891-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Our finding of two phosphorylated serines (Ser478 and Ser481) within the NMBD is intriguing, because the NMBD of ATP7B undergoes copper-dependent conformational changes and interaction with chaperone proteins (31Banci L. Bertini I. Cantini F. Rosenzweig A.C. Yatsunyk L.A. Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 7423-7429Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). ATP7A and ATP7B are two P-type ATPases involved in copper homeostasis (1Lutsenko S. Barnes N.L. Bartee M.Y. Dmitriev O.Y. Physiol. Rev. 2007; 87: 1011-1046Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar, 2Veldhuis N.A. Gaeth A.P. Pearson R.B. Gabriel K. Camakaris J. Biometals. 2009; 22: 177-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), and their mutational defects in humans are responsible for Menkes or Wilson disease, respectively (3Vulpe C. Levinson B.

Commun. 1993; 197: 271-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). In principle, the P-type denomination applies to enzymes that sustain hydrolytic cleavage of phosphorylated substrates, with a catalytic mechanism including intermediate phosphorylation of the Asp residue within an invariant DKTG motif. Although this mechanism extends to the large family of halogenases (7Burroughs A.M. Allen K.N. Dunaway-Mariano D. Aravind L. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 361: 1003-1034Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar), “P-type ATPase” refers to membrane-bound enzymes that couple ATP utilization to cation transport, and are divided into five subfamilies depending on cation specificity and other features of structure and function (8Lutsenko S. Kaplan J.H. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 15607-15613Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar, 9Palmgren M.G. Axelsen K.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1365: 37-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). The ATP7A and ATP7B copper ATPases are included in the P1-subfamily, which is selective for soft and transition metals. In addition to a putative transmembrane metal binding motif (TMBS), 2The abbreviations used are: TMBStransmembrane metal binding siteSERCA1sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPaseNMBDN-terminal metal binding domainMOPS3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acidBCSbathocuproine disulfonateBCAbicinchoninic acidMSmass spectrometryMS/MStandem MSTM6transmembrane 6CMVcytomegalovirusPBSphosphate-buffered salineMES4-morpholineethanesulfonic acidDTTdithiothreitolGFPgreen fluorescent protein. 2The abbreviations used are: TMBStransmembrane metal binding siteSERCA1sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPaseNMBDN-terminal metal binding domainMOPS3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acidBCSbathocuproine disulfonateBCAbicinchoninic acidMSmass spectrometryMS/MStandem MSTM6transmembrane 6CMVcytomegalovirusPBSphosphate-buffered salineMES4-morpholineethanesulfonic acidDTTdithiothreitolGFPgreen fluorescent protein. corresponding to the cation binding/transport sites of other P-ATPases, ATP7A and ATP7B possess a specific N terminus extension (NMBD) that includes six (CXXC) metal binding sites that may be involved in enzyme activation. Furthermore, phosphorylation of the ATP7A and ATP7B proteins may modulate the functional behavior of the enzyme, in addition to forming a catalytic intermediate (10Vanderwerf S.M. Cooper M.J. Stetsenko I.V. Lutsenko S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36289-36294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). These specific structural features, as well as various interactions with chaperones and targeting sites, render characterization of ATP7A and ATP7B rather complex. It is useful to obtain ATP7B protein by heterologous expression in cell cultures, to perform functional characterization of the enzyme in its native form, and subsequent analysis by site-directed mutagenesis. In fact, heterologous expression in insect cells, and initial characterization, were obtained by Tsivkoskii et al. (11Tsivkovskii R. Eisses J.F. Kaplan J.H. Lutsenko S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 976-983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) and Hung et al. (12Hung Y.H. Layton M.J. Voskoboinik I. Mercer J.F. Camakaris J. Biochem. J. 2007; 401: 569-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). We report here high yield expression of WT and mutant ATP7B in COS1 cells infected with adenovirus vector, and functional characterization of membrane-bound ATPase obtained with the microsomal fraction of infected cells. The microsomal protein sustains a copper-dependent steady-state ATPase rate of 30 nmol/per mg of protein per minute at pH 6 and 37 °C, in the presence of 1 mm ATP. We demonstrate by proteolysis and mass spectrometry that, in addition to the invariant DKTG motif undergoing phosphorylation as a catalytic cycle intermediate in other P-type ATPases, the recombinant enzyme undergoes copper-dependent phosphorylation of four serine residues. transmembrane metal binding site sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase N-terminal metal binding domain 3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid bathocuproine disulfonate bicinchoninic acid mass spectrometry tandem MS transmembrane 6 cytomegalovirus phosphate-buffered saline 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid dithiothreitol green fluorescent protein. transmembrane metal binding site sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase N-terminal metal binding domain 3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid bathocuproine disulfonate bicinchoninic acid mass spectrometry tandem MS transmembrane 6 cytomegalovirus phosphate-buffered saline 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid dithiothreitol green fluorescent protein. DISCUSSIONThe ATP7B protein presents sequence homologies that are conserved through all P-ATPases, including residues within the nucleotide binding (“N”) domain and the phosphorylation (“P”) domain. Therefore, it is tempting to assume that the catalytic and transport mechanism is analogous to that of well characterized cation transport ATPases, such as the Ca2+ ATPase (SERCA) and the Na+/K+ ATPase (8Lutsenko S. Kaplan J.H. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 15607-15613Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar, 23de Meis L. Vianna A.L. Annu. Rev.

In fact, copper-dependent phosphorylation of recombinant ATP7B protein by utilization of ATP has been reported (11Tsivkovskii R. Eisses J.F. Kaplan J.H. Lutsenko S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 976-983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) and attributed in part to formation of phosphorylated enzyme intermediate and in part to additional phosphorylation of serine residues. Here we confirm occurrence of phosphorylation, and, taking advantage of the high yield expression, we demonstrate the copper dependence (Fig. 4) and define the time course of phosphoenzyme formation as well as its decay following a chase with non-radioactive ATP (FIGURE 6, FIGURE 7). The kinetics of phosphoenzyme formation is diphasic, with an alkali-labile fraction formed within the first 2 min of reaction. The alkali-labile phosphoenzyme is not obtained with the D1027N (putative catalytic phosphorylation site) mutant or C983A/C985A (putative transmembrane copper site at TM6) mutant.

It has been proposed that phosphorylation of serine residues plays an important role in copper homeostasis, promoting functional interactions of cuproenzymes (2Veldhuis N.A. Gaeth A.P. Pearson R.B. Gabriel K. Camakaris J. Biometals. 2009; 22: 177-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). It is noteworthy that phosphorylation of ATP7B in human cells is copper-dependent (10Vanderwerf S.M. Cooper M.J. Stetsenko I.V. Lutsenko S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36289-36294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), and this phosphorylation appears to play an important role in copper homeostasis and ATP7B trafficking within the cell. In agreement with these findings, we find that phosphorylation of recombinant ATP7B in our microsomal preparation is totally copper-dependent. It is possible that ATP7B phosphorylation sites become exposed as a consequence of copper-induced conformational changes (2Veldhuis N.A. Gaeth A.P. Pearson R.B. Gabriel K. Camakaris J. Biometals. 2009; 22: 177-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). It is also apparent that serine phosphorylation plays a role in regulation of the copper ATPase catalytic cycle. In fact, it was reported that the activity of yeast copper ATPase Ccc2p is regulated by Ser258 phosphorylation (29Valverde R.H. Morin I. Lowe J. Mintz E. Cuillel M. Vieyra A. FEBS Lett. 2008; 582: 891-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Our finding of two phosphorylated serines (Ser478 and Ser481) within the NMBD is intriguing, because the NMBD of ATP7B undergoes copper-dependent conformational changes and interaction with chaperone proteins (31Banci L. Bertini I. Cantini F. Rosenzweig A.C. Yatsunyk L.A. Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 7423-7429Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar)."
https://openalex.org/W2029141630,"Acyl carrier protein (ACP) plays a central role in fatty acid biosynthesis. However, the molecular machinery that mediates its function is not yet fully understood. Therefore, structural studies were carried out on the acyl-ACP intermediates of Plasmodium falciparum using NMR as a spectroscopic probe. Chemical shift perturbation studies put forth a new picture of the interaction of ACP molecule with the acyl chain, namely, the hydrophobic core can protect up to 12 carbon units, and additional carbons protrude out from the top of the hydrophobic cavity. The latter hypothesis stems from chemical shift changes observed in Cα and Cβ of Ser-37 in tetradecanoyl-ACP. 13C,15N-Double-filtered nuclear Overhauser effect (NOE) spectroscopy experiments further substantiate the concept; in octanoyl (C8)- and dodecanoyl (C12)-ACP, a long range NOE is observed within the phosphopantetheine arm, suggesting an arch-like conformation. This NOE is nearly invisible in tetradecanoyl (C14)-ACP, indicating a change in conformation of the prosthetic group. Furthermore, the present study provides insights into the molecular mechanism of ACP expansion, as revealed from a unique side chain-to-backbone hydrogen bond between two fairly conserved residues, Ile-55 HN and Glu-48 O. The backbone amide of Ile-55 HN reports a pKa value for the carboxylate, ∼1.9 pH units higher than model compound value, suggesting strong electrostatic repulsion between helix II and helix III. Charge-charge repulsion between the helices in combination with thrust from inside due to acyl chain would energetically favor the separation of the two helices. Helix III has fewer structural restraints and, hence, undergoes major conformational change without altering the overall-fold of P. falciparum ACP.

In the malarial parasite Plasmodium falciparum, fatty acid biosynthesis occurs by a pathway distinct from the host.

High Throughput Screen. 2005; 8: 15-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). An indispensable component, crucial for each step of the pathway, is a small acidic protein, the ACP. ACP plays a pivotal role in a range of biochemical processes, like fatty acid biosynthesis (3Rock C.O. Cronan J.E. Biochim. Biophys.

Thus, the knowledge of structural features, which dictate ACP function, could offer new avenues for inhibitor design to disable several pathways of the parasite in parallel. acyl carrier protein P. falciparum ACP fatty acid biosynthesis heteronuclear single quantum coherence spectroscopy total correlation spectroscopy coenzyme A nuclear Overhauser effect (NOE) spectroscopy. acyl carrier protein P. falciparum ACP fatty acid biosynthesis heteronuclear single quantum coherence spectroscopy total correlation spectroscopy coenzyme A nuclear Overhauser effect (NOE) spectroscopy. Acyl carrier protein differs structurally in the host and the parasite. It exists as an independent protein in type II fatty acid synthesis pathway, observed in P. falciparum, Escherichia coli, spinach, and most prokaryotes. In the type II pathway, fatty acids are synthesized by multiple enzymes catalyzing different reactions. Conversely, mammalian ACP (malarial host) is an integral domain of one single multidomain, multifunctional fatty acid synthase (FAS) (type I pathway), each domain catalyzing a particular reaction. Interestingly, ACPs of type I and II pathway share a similar fold, the ACP molecule of type II pathway can be substituted with the ACP domain of type I pathway in some cases, and the latter is recognized as a substrate in vitro by key enzymes of type II pathway (9Reed M.A. Schweizer M. Szafranska A.E. Arthur C. Nicholson T.P. Cox R.J. Crosby J. Crump M.P. Simpson T.J. Org. Biomol. Chem. 2003; 1: 463-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The primary function of ACP is to shuttle the lengthening acyl chains to the catalytic site of FAS enzymes. It is expressed as an apoprotein (inactive) and modified to holo-ACP (active) by the transfer of a 4′-phosphopantetheine moiety from coenzyme A (CoA) to a conserved serine residue, Ser-36/37, with ACP synthase acting as a catalyst. The acyl chain gets covalently tethered to the terminal cysteamine thiol of the 4′-phosphopantetheine prosthetic group, which in turn transfers the acyl chain to the respective enzymes during elongation. Biosynthesis of fatty acid(s) is initiated by the carboxylation of acetyl-CoA to malonyl-CoA, which is transacylated to malonyl-ACP. Malonyl-ACP condenses with acetyl-CoA, resulting in the formation of enoyl-/butyryl-ACP (C4-) which enters the elongation cycle. Two carbon atoms are added per elongation cycle, resulting in acyl-ACPs C6-, C8-, C10-, C12-, C14-, and C16-ACP. Palmitate (C16) is the most common product of type I pathway, whereas in the type II pathway, products range from saturated to unsaturated, branched, unbranched, or variable chain lengths. Structurally, ACP is a four-helix bundle protein, with the helices enclosing a central hydrophobic cavity (10Xu G.Y. Tam A. Lin L. Hixon J. Fritz C.C. Powers R.

Chembiochem. 2008; 9: 2424-2432Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In the type II pathway, the hydrophobic cavity accommodates the growing acyl chain and the β-mercaptoethyl moiety of the 4′-phosphopantetheine arm. The acyl chain remains embedded in the cavity, which expands with increasing length of the acyl chain as observed in E. coli and spinach (12Roujeinikova A. Baldock C. Simon W.J. Gilroy J. Baker P.J.

The mechanism of acyl chain interaction with the ACP molecule is remarkably different in rat, which belongs to the type I fatty acid pathway. Insignificant interactions between the ACP molecule and the acyl chain are observed, suggesting that the ACP molecule does not sequester the acyl chain, and therefore, the acyl chain in type I pathway is protected in a way different from the type II pathway (18Płoskoń E.

Despite the availability of structural data for a number of acyl-ACPs e.g. E. coli and spinach (12Roujeinikova A. Baldock C. Simon W.J. Gilroy J. Baker P.J. Stuitje A.R. Rice D.W. Slabas A.R.

Protein Sci. 2009; 18: 240-246PubMed Google Scholar), molecular details pertaining to acyl chain carriage and its presentation to the FAS enzymes of type II pathway is still an enigma. The general consensus is that the ACP molecule can accommodate 10 carbon atoms only. In spinach, the hydrophobic cavity of ACP expands to accommodate acyl chain lengths ranging from C10:0 to C18:0. However, chains longer than 10 carbon units are not fully protected (14Zornetzer G.A. Fox B.G. Markley J.L. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 5217-5227Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In E. coli, 10 carbon atoms have been observed to be accommodated in the hydrophobic core (19Roujeinikova A. Simon W.J. Gilroy J. Rice D.W. Rafferty J.B. Slabas A.R. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 365: 135-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). A molecular dynamics study on E. coli published recently also shows that the hydrophobic core of ACP can hold a maximum of 10 carbon atoms only (21Chan D.I. Stockner T. Tieleman D.P. Vogel H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 33620-33629Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Here, we demonstrate that P. falciparum ACP (PfACP) can protect more than 10-carbon-atom-long acyl chains, with a maximum of 12 carbon atoms. An in silico study on PfACP published recently proposes the possible mechanism of substrate delivery based on steered molecular dynamics simulations using E. coli acyl-ACPs as the starting model (22Colizzi F. Recanatini M. Cavalli A. J. Chem. Inf. Model. 2008; 48: 2289-2293Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). There are no experimental data (x-ray or NMR) available to date on the acyl-ACPs of P. falciparum. Present work for the first time provides structural insights into the acyl-PfACP intermediates using NMR as a primary tool. The precision and sensitivity of NMR allowed identification of key interactions between the acyl chain and the ACP molecule, leading to the proposal of a model unraveling the sequence of structural changes accompanying acyl chain insertion. The molecular basis of ACP expansion in PfACP upon acyl chain elongation has also been deciphered. Cloning, expression, and purification of P. falciparum holo-ACP in E. coli has already been described (23Sharma S.K. Modak R. Sharma S. Sharma A.K. Sarma S.P. Surolia A. Surolia N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 330: 1019-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). E. coli holo-ACP synthase, apoPfACP and respective acyl-CoAs were used for the synthesis of butyryl-, octanoyl-, decanoyl-, dodecanoyl-, tetradecanoyl-, and hexadecanoyl-ACP using a modified protocol of Lambalot and Walsh (24Lambalot R.H.

Uniformly labeled 13C, 1H,15N-apoACP was prepared by growing E. coli in M9 media containing 15N NH4Cl (1 g/liter) and 13C glucose (2 g/liter) (Spectra Stable Isotopes). The N-terminal His tag was removed by thrombin cleavage. NMR samples were comprised of uniformly labeled 13C, 1H,15N protein in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.5, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5% sodium azide, 90% H2O, and 10% D2O. A protein concentration of 1 mm was used throughout. The phosphopantetheine arm and the acyl chains were unlabeled, as the proteins were synthesized by enzymatic modification of uniformly labeled ACP. Two- and three-dimensional NMR experiments, viz. 1H15N HSQC, 1H15N TOCSY, HNCACB, CBCAcoNH, CCcoNH, HNcoCA, and 13C15N-filtered experiments were acquired on a Varian Inova 500, installed at the National Institute of Immunology, New Delhi, India, equipped with a triple resonance, Z-pulsed field gradient probe. Experiments were performed at 300 K. NMR data were processed on a work station running Red Hat Enterprize Linux 5.0, using NMRPipe/NMRDraw (25Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11450) Google Scholar) and analyzed using Sparky (26Goddard T.D. Kneller D.G. SPARKY 3. University of California, San Francisco1921Google Scholar). The data were multiplied by a phase shifted sinebell apodization function in all dimensions. 1H15N HSQC spectra were acquired using 1024 data points (t2) dimension and 512 data points (t1) dimension. 1H15N HSQC-TOCSY experiments were collected with 1024 (t3) × 72 (t1) × 48 (t2) data points and a mixing time of 150 ms. CBCAcoNH, HNCACB, and CCcoNH experiments were collected with 1024 (t3) × 36 (t1) × 24 (t2) data points. Data were linear-predicted in the forward direction for up to half the number of experimental points in the indirect dimensions. In 13C15N-filtered two-dimensional NOESY experiments, a mixing time of 400 ms was used with 1024 data points in the t2 dimension and 1024 points in the t1 dimension. In 13C-filtered 15N-edited triple resonance NOESY experiments, a mixing time of 300 ms with 1024 (t3) × 48 (t1) × 24 (t2) data points were used. Changes in HN have been reported as average chemical shifts (ΔΔδHN) derived from the equation ΔΔδHN=[(ΔHN)2+(ΔN/5)2]1/2Eq. 1 where ΔHN is the change in chemical shift in the proton dimension, and ΔN is the change in chemical shift in the nitrogen dimension. All chemical shift changes reported in the study ΔHN, ΔCα, and ΔCβ are differences in chemical shift of a given acyl-ACP and the preceding acyl intermediate, i.e. butyryl (butyryl-holo-)-, octanoyl (octanoyl-butyryl)-, decanoyl (decanoyl-octanoyl)-, dodecanoyl (dodecanoyl-decanoyl)-, tetradecanoyl (tetradecanoyl-dodecanoyl)-, and hexadecanoyl (hexadecanoyl-tetradecanoyl)-ACP. One standard deviation has been used as a cutoff to demarcate significant chemical shift change and is represented as a discontinuous horizontal line in the figures. pH titration studies were carried out in the pH range 8.0-3.5. Protein samples were comprised of 1 mm holo-ACP, 0.1 m KCl, 90% H2O, 10% D2O, and 2 mm dithiothreitol. Sodium 4,4-dimethyl-4-silapentanesulfonate was used as an internal standard. Apparent pKa value for the backbone amide was obtained by fitting proton chemical shifts versus pH to the modified Hill equation (27Sundd M. Iverson N. Ibarra-Molero B. Sanchez-Ruiz J.M.

The NMR structure of holo-PfACP comprises four helices surrounding a central hydrophobic cavity, helix I (residues 4–15), helix II (residues 37–51), helix III (residues 57–60), and helix IV (residues 66–75) (14Zornetzer G.A. Fox B.G. Markley J.L. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 5217-5227Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). A phosphopantetheine moiety attaches to the side chain OH of Ser-37, as shown in Fig. 1. The other end of phosphopantetheine moiety is subsequently attached to the acyl chain by a thioester bond, resulting in the formation of acyl-ACP intermediates. In P. falciparum, a range of acyl-ACPs is formed during fatty acid biosynthesis, the primary products being C10:0, C12:0, and C14:0-ACPs (29Lack G. Homberger-Zizzari E. Folkers G. Scapozza L.

The molecular mechanism by which the acyl chain is carried by the PfACP molecule and the structural changes accompanying acyl chain elongation in ACP remain unknown. In this study we have simulated the process of fatty acid biosynthesis in P. falciparum by synthesizing a range of acyl-ACP intermediates and studying them using NMR. Butyryl (C4)-, octanoyl (C8)-, decanoyl (C10)-, dodecanoyl (C12)-, and tetradecanoyl (C14)-ACP have been studied along with holo-ACP, the active form of ACP that participates in the initiation of fatty acid biosynthesis. Hexadecanoyl-ACP (C16 or palmitate) has also been included in this study despite not being physiologically relevant to extrapolate the data to systems synthesizing longer fatty acids. All acyl intermediates were synthesized in vitro by enzymatic processing of 13C,15N-labeled apoACP. Therefore, only the ACP molecule was 13C,15N-labeled, with the prosthetic group and the acyl chain remaining unlabeled. Holo-ACP chemical shifts were assigned based on the Biological Magnetic Resonance Bank entry 6516,(15Sharma A.K. Sharma S.K. Surolia A. Surolia N. Sarma S.P. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 6904-6916Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), whereas peaks in the acyl intermediates were assigned by analyzing three-dimensional NMR experiments viz. 1H15N TOCSY, CBCAcoNH, HNCACB, and HNcoCA. HN chemical shifts have been presented as average of changes in 1H and 15N dimension, as perturbations were observed in both dimensions. All chemical shift changes reported in this manuscript (HN, Cα, Cβ) are relative changes between a given acyl-ACP and the preceding acyl intermediate (one with smaller acyl chain length) as described under “Experimental Procedures.” A S.D. > 1 σ has been used to define significant chemical shift change and is represented as a dotted line in FIGURE 2, FIGURE 3. Fig. 2, A–F, illustrates the average chemical shift change (ΔHNavg) for the backbone amides in the acyl-ACPs.FIGURE 3Cα and Cβ chemical shift changes.

Chemical shift changes are reported in ppm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Chemical shift perturbation study is a highly sensitive approach, and hence, the slightest changes in conformation as a result of ligand interaction can be ascertained. In butyryl-ACP, a change in chemical shift for residues present in loop I, helix II, loop II, and loop III is observed (Fig. 2A). The amides of Phe-29, Thr-30, Ser-37, Leu-38, Ile-55, and Leu-61 display a noticeable change in chemical shift. Octanoyl-ACP causes a change in chemical shift for residues in loop I, helix II, loop II, helix III, loop III, and helix IV (Fig. 2B). Some of the residues displaying large chemical shift changes are Phe-29, Thr-30, Ala-35, Leu-38, Met-45, Ile-55, and Gln-67. Decanoyl-ACP induces marked chemical shift change in residues localized primarily in loop II, i.e. Val-53, Thr-54, and Ile-55. Conversion of decanoyl- to dodecanoyl-ACP is accompanied with a change in chemical shift of the amides in helix I, helix II, loop II, helix III, and helix IV. Tetradecanoyl-ACP shows very little change, except for a couple of residues, Val-53 and Ile-55. Changes in hexadecanoyl-ACP were insignificant in comparison to other acyl-ACPs as shown in Fig. 2F. Ile-55 HN could not be traced in hexadecanoyl-ACP due to signal overlap and, therefore, is not included in the figure. Maximum chemical shift change was observed in dodecanoyl-ACP, and least perturbed were the amides in hexadecanoyl-ACP. Because of signal overlap, we have excluded Asp-39 and Leu-40 in all our studies. It is intriguing that most of the residues that report significant change in backbone amide chemical shift are hydrophobic in nature or the ones adjoining a hydrophobic residue. The pattern of chemical shift change demonstrates the nature of acyl-ACP interaction; the acyl chain is lodged in the hydrophobic cavity, and consequently, overall expansion of the molecule ensues to accommodate the acyl chain. The observation of relatively small chemical shift changes upon conversion of dodecanoyl- to tetradecanoyl- or hexadecanoyl-ACP suggests that the hydrophobic cavity of PfACP can accommodate acyl chains up to 12 carbon atoms only and, thereafter, any carbon atom added is not completely protected by the hydrophobic core. Minor changes in chemical shift in the neighborhood of Ile-55 and Ser-37 reflect the strain within the ACP molecule to accommodate maximal number of hydrophobic carbons. Cα chemical shift is a benchmark of any change in protein fold or backbone. An advantage of Cα chemical shift over backbone amides is their insensitivity to hydrogen-bond interactions, and therefore, the extent of chemical shift perturbation is directly proportional to conformational change. Fig. 3, A–E, shows the changes in Cα chemical shift of the acyl-ACP intermediates. In butyryl-ACP, backbone Cα chemical shift changes are observed in Phe-29, Ser-37, Leu-40, Ile-44, Lys-62, and Ile-63 (Fig. 3A). Octanoyl-ACP formation is accompanied with changes in a few other residues as well, Asp-6, Ala-46, Leu-47, and Ile-55, in addition to Phe-29, Ile-44, Lys-62, and Ile-63, which display a Cα change in butyryl-ACP. Phe-29 shows a 3-fold change in chemical shift in octanoyl- compared with butyryl-ACP, whereas Ile-44 changes 2-fold. Decanoyl-ACP formation is accompanied with a change in chemical shift of residues Thr-54, Ile-55, and Ser-56 in loop II, Gln-58 and Asp-59 in helix III, Leu-61 and Ile-63 in loop III, and Val-66, Gln-67, Ile-73, and Glu-74 in helix IV. Apart from these, a few other residues also display a change in chemical shift, Ile-12 in helix I, Ser-27 in the loop I, and Leu-47 in helix II, as shown in Fig. 3C. Notably, Leu-47, Ile-55, and Ile-63 that display a change in Cα chemical shift in octanoyl-ACP undergo a further change in decanoyl-ACP. Conversion of decanoyl- to dodecanoyl-ACP induces a change in chemical shift for residues present in helix II (Leu-47 and Phe-51, loop II; Val-53, loop III; Leu-61 and Lys-62) and helix IV (Ile-73) as shown in Fig. 3D. Ile-73 displays maximum Cα change in dodecanoyl-ACP, i.e. ∼1.01 ppm. The Cα of Leu-47 is seen undergoing a chemical shift change consistently in octanoyl-, decanoyl-, and dodecanoyl-ACP, although major change occurs only in dodecanoyl-ACP. Changes in Cα for Ser-37 and a few residues in the neighborhood of Ile-55 are observed in tetradecanoyl-ACP. Data for hexadecanoyl-ACP could not be acquired due to high rate of thioester bond hydrolysis, a pace much faster than NMR time scale. Fig. 4 highlights the regions in acyl-PfACPs undergoing conformational change. The extent of swelling in a given acyl-ACP is directly proportional to Cα chemical shift change. Some of the residues displaying significant Cα chemical shift change are shown in ball and stick. A green arrow shown on the right side of the figure along with a number indicates the length of the acyl chain buried in the hydrophobic cavity. The red colored bar denotes the region that gets exposed to the solvent. In butyryl-ACP, chemical shift changes are confined to helix I, loop II, and a small part of loop III, close to the top opening of the hydrophobic cavity. In octanoyl-ACP, the acyl chain penetrates deep in the cavity, and hence, chemical shift perturbation moves to the lower half of helix II and loop II. In decanoyl-ACP, changes occur in loop II, helix III, loop III, and helix IV. In dodecanoyl-ACP, helix II, loop II, loop III, and the lower part of helix IV undergo conformational change. Perturbation of helix IV at the C terminus in dodecanoyl-ACP indicates slight widening of the bottom opening of the hydrophobic core. Taken together, maximum Cα change occurs in helix III during acyl chain elongation and is observed in decanoyl-ACP. Cβ chemical shifts are reporters of side-chain conformation and, hence, offer excellent opportunities to follow side-chain rearrangement upon ligand interaction. Fig. 3, F–J, illustrates the changes in Cβ of PfACP as a function of acyl chain growth. In butyryl-ACP, residues Phe-29, Thr-30, Leu-33, Ala-35, Asp-36, Glu-48, Ser-56, and Ile-63 display a significant change in chemical shift. Changes in Cβ of Phe-29 and Ile-63 are consistent with changes in Cα. In octanoyl-ACP, Asp-6, Phe-29, Asp-36, Leu-43, Leu-47, Phe-51, Asn-52, Thr-54–Ser-56, Ile-63, and Asp-68 experience a chemical shift change >1σ S.D. Decanoyl-ACP is accompanied with a chemical shift change of Gln-15, Gln-24, Asn-28, Leu-33, Leu-43, Met-45, Leu-47, Ile-55, Asp-59, and Ala-60. In dodecanoyl-ACP, residues Ala-35, Thr-54–Ser-56, Asp-59, Ile-63, Ala-69, Ile-70, and Ile-73 show a large change in Cβ chemical shift. In tetradecanoyl-ACP, changes in Cβ are relatively small compared with other ACPs. Only a slight change in Phe-29, Ser-37, Lys-50, Phe-51, and Thr-54–Ser-56 is observed. Residues between Lys-50–Ser-56 are localized at the bottom of the hydrophobic cavity, whereas Ser-37 is attached to the acyl chain, and it resides outside the cavity in helix II. Thus, observed Cβ chemical shift changes occur either for residues that are indirectly attached to the acyl chain or present at the openings of the hydrophobic cavity. Overall, three residues display large changes in side-chain conformation as the acyl chain grows from holo- to tetradecanoyl-ACP; Phe-29 by 0.75 ppm, Ile-55 by 1.51 ppm, and Ile-73 by 0.81 ppm. Backbone amides are good reporters of hydrogen bonds, and proton chemical shifts depend on the inverse third power of the distance between amide proton and hydrogen bond acceptor. Therefore, changes in HN report not only direct interaction of a ligand with the backbone amide but also stretching/skewing of hydrogen bonds. It has been shown by other studies that a backbone amide hydrogen bonded to a side-chain carboxylate displays a chemical shift change >1 ppm, and its apparent pKa value matches with that of the carboxyl group accepting the hydrogen bond (27Sundd M.

In the absence of condensin, however, repression of rDNA transcription leads to rDNA instability and elevated level of extrachromosomal rDNA circles and nucleolar fragmentation. Here, we show that mutations in the Rad52 homologous recombination machinery block rDNA instability. Rad52 is normally excluded from the nucleolus. In the absence of condensin, however, repression of rDNA transcription results in Rad52 localization to the nucleolus, association with rDNA and subsequent formation of extrachromosomal rDNA circles, and reduced cell survival. In contrast, deletion of RAD52 restores cell viability under the same conditions. These results reveal an opposing role of condensin and Rad52 in the control of rDNA stability under nutrient starvation conditions.

In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, there are ∼150 copies of rDNA tandem repeats on chromosome XII. Each rDNA repeat contains a 35 S and 5 S rRNA gene that is transcribed by RNA polymerases I (Pol I) 2The abbreviations used are: Pol IRNA polymerase ITORtarget of rapamycinTORC1TOR complex 1IFindirect immunofluorescenceHAhemagglutininrDNAribosomal DNAERCextrachromosomal rDNA circleYPDyeast peptone dextroseDSBdouble-strand breakHRhomologous recombinationWTwild typeChIPchromatin immunoprecipitationDAPI4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. and III (Pol III), respectively. rDNA is also the nucleolar organizer essential for normal nucleolar structure and functions. Ribosome biogenesis, including rRNA synthesis, processing, and ribosomal particle assembly, occurs in the nucleolus. Therefore, rDNA plays a crucial role in growth regulation (1Warner J.R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 437-440Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1409) Google Scholar).

Because of its highly repetitive nature, the rDNA locus is inherently unstable due to various forms of homologous recombination within rDNA array. Maintaining rDNA stability is not only important for cell growth but also for the stability of the whole genome (2Kobayashi T. BioEssays. 2008; 30: 267-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The extrachromosomal rDNA circle (ERC) is a hallmark for rDNA instability (3Tsang C.K. Wei Y. Zheng X.F. Cell Cycle. 2007; 6: 2213-2218Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). ERC is formed when the free DNA end after the double-strand break (DSB) invades a complementary sequence within its own rDNA array, a process known as intrachromosomal homologous recombination. Depending on which rDNA repeat is used for repair, ERC can contain various numbers of rDNA repeats after recombination repair, causing a loss of the same number of repeats from the chromosomal rDNA array. Nevertheless, most cells can manage to maintain rDNA stability, as indicated by their relatively constant numbers of rDNA repeats and the lack of detectable ERCs. However, because of certain gene mutations or under pathological situations such as aging, the rDNA repeat number can be fluctuated accompanied by ERC accumulation. For example, mutation in genes such as SIR2, FOB1, TOP1/2, and RPA135 are known to cause ERC accumulation and/or shrinkage of rDNA array (4Kobayashi T. Heck D.J. Nomura M. Horiuchi T. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3821-3830Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar, 5Kim R.A. Wang J.C. Cell. 1989; 57: 975-985Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 6Brewer B.J.

Cell. 2004; 117: 441-453Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Mutations of Pol I essential subunits or the Pol I transcription factor can enhance homologous recombination and lead to rDNA instability. Brewer and colleagues (6Brewer B.J. Lockshon D. Fangman W.L. Cell. 1992; 71: 267-276Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar) showed that >80% of the chromosomal copies of the rDNA repeats are deleted in a rpa135 mutant. (RPA135 encodes the second largest Pol I subunit.) Another study showed that in an rpa135 mutant, in which 35 S rRNA is synthesized by Pol II from a multicopy plasmid, more than one-half of the chromosomal rDNA repeats were reduced under the condition that represses Pol I transcription (4Kobayashi T. Heck D.J. Nomura M. Horiuchi T. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3821-3830Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). We also observed that inactivation of rDNA transcription by a mutation of RRN3 (which encodes an essential Pol I transcription factor) or RPA190 (which encodes the largest Pol I subunit) leads to nucleolar fragmentation and ERC formation. Consistent with these observations, a top1top2 double mutant shows a substantial inhibition of rRNA synthesis and an unstable rDNA phenotype as revealed by an increased level of ERC (5Kim R.A. Wang J.C. Cell. 1989; 57: 975-985Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). These results suggest that active rDNA transcription has a role in maintaining rDNA stability. Target of rapamycin (TOR) is a central component of nutrient signaling that regulates cell growth. TOR is a conserved phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-related kinase and a key regulator of ribosome biogenesis (9Tsang C.K. Qi H. Liu L.F. Zheng X.F. Drug Discov. Today. 2007; 12: 112-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). TOR is present in two distinct complexes called TOR complex 1 and 2 (TORC1 and TORC2) (10Loewith R. Jacinto E. Wullschleger S. Lorberg A. Crespo J.L. Bonenfant D. Oppliger W. Jenoe P. Hall M.N. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 457-468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1463) Google Scholar). Rapamycin specifically inhibits TORC1 function. Conditions that inactivate TORC1, such as nutrient starvation or rapamycin treatment, inhibit Pol I- and Pol III-dependent rDNA transcription (11Zaragoza D. Ghavidel A. Heitman J. Schultz M.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4463-4470Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 12Powers T. Walter P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 987-1000Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). Inhibition of TORC1 also causes nucleolar contraction and rDNA condensation, which is mediated by condensins (3Tsang C.K. Wei Y. Zheng X.F. Cell Cycle. 2007; 6: 2213-2218Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 13Tsang C.K. Bertram P.G. Ai W. Drenan R. Zheng X.F.

Condensin is a highly conserved protein machinery known for condensation of chromosomal DNA and segregation of sister chromatids during cell division (15Strunnikov A.V. Hogan E. Koshland D. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 587-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar, 16Koshland D. Strunnikov A. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev.

Upon TORC1 inhibition, condensin is rapidly relocated to the nucleolus and loaded to rDNA tandem repeats, resulting in rDNA compaction. A major role of such rDNA condensation is to maintain rDNA stability as the absence of condensin during starvation leads to elevated ERCs (14Tsang C.K. Li H. Zheng X.S. EMBO J. 2007; 26: 448-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Because rDNA instability and dysregulation of nucleolar functions have been linked to aging, genomic instability, and cancer (2Kobayashi T. BioEssays. 2008; 30: 267-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 18Johnson F.B. Marciniak R.A. Guarente L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 332-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), it is important to understand the molecular mechanisms that cause rDNA instability. The aim of the present study is to identify the factors that are responsible for rDNA instability and ERC formation. Here, we provide evidence that condensin and Rad52 act antagonistically in the control of rDNA stability. The genotypes of yeast strains are shown in Table 1. The double mutants (except rpa190-1 rad52Δ) were constructed as described previously (14Tsang C.K. Li H. Zheng X.S. EMBO J. 2007; 26: 448-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). rpa190-1 rad52Δ was generated by one-step PCR-based gene deletion as described previously (19Brachmann C.B. Davies A. Cost G.J. Caputo E. Li J. Hieter P. Boeke J.D. Yeast. 1998; 14: 115-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (2618) Google Scholar). RAD52-HA6 is constructed on the pRS314 plasmid under the control of the RAD52 native promoter. The antibodies used were mouse anti-Nop1 (EnCor Biotechnology); Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated goat anti-mouse and Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit (Invitrogen); rabbit polyclonal anti-HA (Bethyl Laboratories); monoclonal anti-HA (12CA5; Harlan Laboratories); and rat anti-tubulin (Sigma).TABLE 1Yeast strains used in this workStrainGenotypeNOY259MATα rpa190-1 trp1-Δ1 his4-Δ401 leu2-3,112 ura3-52 can1NOY260MATα RPA190 trp1-Δ1 his4-Δ401 leu2-3,112 ura3-52 can1SZy1821MATα rpa190-1 trp1-Δ1 his4-Δ401 leu2-3,112 ura3-52 can1 rad52Δ ::LEU2SZy1822MATa bar1 ura3-52 leu2 his3Δ-200 trp1 ade2-101 HIS3:ycs4-2-MYC12 rad52Δ ::LEU2SZy1876MATα rpa190-1 trp1-Δ1 his4-Δ401 leu2-3,112 ura3-52 can1pRS314SZy1877MATa bar1 ura3-52 leu2 his3Δ-200 trp1 ade2-101 HIS3:ycs4-2-MYC12 pRS314(RAD52HA6)SZy1880MATα RPA190 trp1-Δ1 his4-Δ401 leu2-3,112 ura3-52 can1 pRS314SZy1881MATα RPA190 trp1-Δ1 his4-Δ401 leu2-3,112 ura3-52 can1 pRS314(RAD52HA6)SZy1883MATa bar1 ura3 leu2 trp1 ade2 his3Δ-200 gal1 can1 YCG1 ::KAN pRS314SZy1884MATa bar1 ura3 leu2 trp1 ade2 his3Δ-200 gal1 can1 YCG1 ::KAN pRS314(RAD52HA6)SZy1887MATα rpa190-1 trp1-Δ1 his4-Δ401 leu2-3,112 ura3-52 can1 rad52Δ ::LEU2 pRS314(RAD52HA6)SZy1889MATα rpa190-1 trp1-Δ1 his4-Δ401 leu2-3,112 ura3-52 can1 rad52Δ ::LEU2 pRS314SZy1892MATα rpa190-1 trp1-Δ1 his4-Δ401 leu2-3,112 ura3-52 can1 rad51Δ ::KanMXSZy1894MATα rpa190-1 trp1-Δ1 his4-Δ401 leu2-3,112 ura3-52 can1 rad59Δ ::KanMXSZy1900MATα rpa190-1 trp1-Δ1 his4-Δ401 leu2-3,112 ura3-52 can1 rad55Δ ::KanMXSZy1903MATα rpa190-1 trp1-Δ1 his4-Δ401 leu2-3,112 ura3-52 can1 rad54Δ ::KanMXSZy1905MATα rpa190-1 trp1-Δ1 his4-Δ401 leu2-3,112 ura3-52 can1 yku70Δ ::KanMXSZy1907MATα rpa190-1 trp1-Δ1 his4-Δ401 leu2-3,112 ura3-52 can1 xrs2Δ ::KanMXSZy1934MATα rpa190-1 trp1-Δ1 his4-Δ401 leu2-3,112 ura3-52 can1 fob1Δ ::KanMXSZy1935MATa bar1 ura3-52 leu2 his3Δ-200 trp1 ade2-101 HIS3:ycs4-2-MYC12 fob1Δ ::KanMXSZy1936MATα his1Δ leu2Δ0 met15Δ ura3Δ0 rad52Δ ::KanMXSZy1937MATa his1Δ leu2Δ0 met15Δ ura3Δ0 fob1Δ ::KanMXZW206MATa bar1 ura3-52 leu2 his3Δ-200 trp1 ade2-101 HIS3:ycs4-2-MYC12 Open table in a new tab Yeast IF experiments were performed as described (20Burke D. Dawson D. Stearn T. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, New York2000: 135-138Google Scholar). Primary antibody dilution used are as follows: 1:1,000 anti-Nop1, 1:100 monoclonal anti-HA (12CA5), and 1:500 rabbit polyclonal anti-HA. The antibody-antigen complexes were detected with 1:200 Alexa Fluor 594- or Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated secondary antibodies. DNA was stained with 50 ng/ml DAPI in anti-fade mounting medium for 15 min. Fluorescence signals were analyzed using an Olympus fluorescence microscope equipped with a digital camera. Cells were lysed with glass beads by vortexing in disruption buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, plus a mixture of protease inhibitors; Roche Applied Science). Protein samples (5–10 μg) were separated on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel and then transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The primary antibodies used were as follows: 1:1,000 anti-HA (12CA5) and 1:1,000 anti-tubulin. ChIP assay was performed as described previously (21Lieb J. Liu X. Botstein D. Brown P. Nat. Genet. 2001; 28: 327-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar). For immunoprecipitations, 1 mg of total protein was incubated with 10 μl of anti-hemagglutinin (HA) for overnight at 4 °C. Protein G-Sepharose beads were used to recover the antibody-antigen-DNA complexes in all experiments. The total input DNA (see Fig. 4A, Input) was prepared in the same way, except that the antibody immunoprecipitation steps were omitted. The isogenic strains without tagged protein were used as a control to access the background PCR signals. The primer pairs for PCR detection were described previously (14Tsang C.K. Li H. Zheng X.S. EMBO J. 2007; 26: 448-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Isolation of DNA and Southern blot analysis for detection of ERC was performed as described previously (14Tsang C.K. Li H. Zheng X.S. EMBO J. 2007; 26: 448-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Yeast viability was determined by plating assay as described (22Fannjiang Y. Cheng W.C. Lee S.J. Qi B. Pevsner J. McCaffery J.M. Hill R.B. Basañez G. Hardwick J.M. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 2785-2797Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar) with minor modification. Briefly, yeast cells were counted with a hemocytometer, and 200 cells were spread on 2% agar yeast peptone dextrose (YPD) plates for 5 days at permissive temperature (23 °C). Colonies were counted, and percent colony formation was calculated. Cell viability was compared with the corresponding untreated control. Each experiment was performed with triplicate samples. We have previously observed an rDNA instability in Pol I mutants when Pol I transcription is repressed, whereas rDNA is not properly condensed (14Tsang C.K. Li H. Zheng X.S. EMBO J. 2007; 26: 448-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). This observation suggests that there is hyper-recombination in this chromosomal region. ERC is the by-product of hyperactive homologous recombination (HR) within the rDNA array (23Sinclair D.A. Guarente L. Cell. 1997; 91: 1033-1042Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1175) Google Scholar). In budding yeast, Fob1 and Rad52 are known to be involved in intra- and interchromosomal rDNA HRs. Fob1 is a replication fork barrier binding protein that is required for rDNA DSB and subsequent HR (4Kobayashi T. Heck D.J. Nomura M. Horiuchi T. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3821-3830Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Aging cells accumulate a large number of ERCs, which can be prevented by a fob1Δ mutation (24Defossez P.A. Prusty R. Kaeberlein M. Lin S.J. Ferrigno P. Silver P. Keil R.L. Guarente L. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 447-455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). Rad52 is a key conserved component of the recombination machinery for most HR events in yeast and humans (25Symington L.S. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2002; 66: 630-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (815) Google Scholar). Rad52 has also been implicated in ERC accumulation with age (26Park P.U. Defossez P.A. Guarente L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3848-3856Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) and spontaneous ERC formation in young yeast cells (27Johzuka K. Horiuchi T. Genes Cells. 2002; 7: 99-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). We have shown previously that inhibition of rDNA transcription in uncondensed rDNA mutants leads to nucleolar fragmentation and elevated ERC levels (3Tsang C.K. Wei Y. Zheng X.F. Cell Cycle. 2007; 6: 2213-2218Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 14Tsang C.K. Li H. Zheng X.S. EMBO J. 2007; 26: 448-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Such conditions include inactivation of Pol I temperature-sensitive mutants (such as rpa190-1) in a rich nutrient medium in which the nucleolus remains uncondensed or treatment of a condensin mutant (e.g. ycs4-2) with rapamycin (14Tsang C.K. Li H. Zheng X.S. EMBO J. 2007; 26: 448-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Using genomic DNA Southern blotting, we found an elevated ERC formation in rpa190-1 cells at the restrictive temperature, which was suppressed by rapamycin (Fig. 1A). Under conditions when the ERC level was high, there was also an increased nucleolar fragmentation (Fig. 1, B–E). Because rapamycin causes condensin loading to rDNA and thereby prevents nucleolar fragmentation in rpa190-1 cells (14Tsang C.K. Li H. Zheng X.S. EMBO J. 2007; 26: 448-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), we treated these cells with rapamycin and detected ERC levels. Indeed, rapamycin blocked ERC formation in rpa190-1 cells (Fig. 1A, compare lanes 7 and 8). These data show that ERC formation is closely correlated with nucleolar fragmentation, confirming our earlier observations (14Tsang C.K. Li H. Zheng X.S. EMBO J. 2007; 26: 448-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Because of the ease in detection of nucleolar fragmentation, we chose nucleolar staining to monitor ERC formation in our subsequent experiments. To investigate whether Fob1 and Rad52 are involved in ERC formation under the aforementioned conditions, we generated rpa190-1 fob1Δ and rpa190-1 rad52Δ double mutants. In the absence of Fob1, inactivation of rpa190-1 still led to a high level of nucleolar fragmentation (Fig. 1, B and C). In contrast, the ERC level was reduced to the basal level after RAD52 was deleted (Fig. 1, B and C). To confirm that this ERC-suppressive effect is due to the Rad52-null mutation, we introduced a plasmid-borne RAD52-HA into the rpa190-1 rad52Δ mutant strain. In the presence of RAD52-HA, but not a control plasmid, nucleolar fragmentation was restored (Fig. 1, D and E). These results indicate that Rad52 is required for nucleolar fragmentation. To further verify this observation, we deleted RAD52 or FOB1 in the background of ycs4-2, a temperature-sensitive condensin mutant. In the ycs4-2 strain, rapamycin treatment does not lead to rDNA condensation due to lack of a functional condensin, resulting in elevated ERC levels (Fig. 2) (14Tsang C.K. Li H. Zheng X.S. EMBO J. 2007; 26: 448-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Consistently, we observed that deletion of RAD52, but not FOB1, in the ycs4-2 background suppressed the fragmented nucleolar phenotype (Fig. 2). Together, these results show that Rad52, but not Fob1, is required for hyper-recombination in transcriptionally repressed yet uncondensed rDNA array. The observation that Rad52 is required for rDNA instability is interesting because Rad52 is better known for repair of rDNA lesions (28Torres-Rosell J. Sunjevaric I. De Piccoli G. Sacher M. Eckert-Boulet N. Reid R. Jentsch S. Rothstein R. Aragón L. Lisby M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2007; 9: 923-931Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). It has been shown that Rad52 is normally localized in the nucleus but is excluded from the nucleolus (28Torres-Rosell J. Sunjevaric I. De Piccoli G. Sacher M. Eckert-Boulet N. Reid R. Jentsch S. Rothstein R. Aragón L. Lisby M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2007; 9: 923-931Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). However, rDNA lesion undergoes a dynamic, transient exit from the nucleolus to get access to the Rad52-dependent HR machinery for repair (28Torres-Rosell J. Sunjevaric I. De Piccoli G. Sacher M. Eckert-Boulet N. Reid R. Jentsch S. Rothstein R. Aragón L. Lisby M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2007; 9: 923-931Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). To gain insight into the mechanism of Rad52-dependent rDNA instability, we examined Rad52 localization. In agreement with the earlier study, Rad52 was localized in the nucleoplasm but excluded from the nucleolus under the normal growth condition (Fig. 3) in both wild type (WT) and rpa190-1 strains at the permissive temperature (23 °C). Upon shifting to the nonpermissive temperature, rDNA transcription was inhibited, but rDNA remained uncondensed in the rpa190-1 mutant (14Tsang C.K. Li H. Zheng X.S. EMBO J. 2007; 26: 448-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). This condition caused Rad52 proteins to translocate into the nucleolus (Fig. 3). This observation indicates that rDNA transcriptional repression in the absence of condensation elicits Rad52 invasion of the nucleolus. The fact that Rad52 is localized to the nucleolus suggests that it causes rDNA homologous recombination. To test this idea, we performed ChIP to detect the association of Rad52-HA with rDNA chromatin. In WT cells, Rad52-HA was undetectable at rDNA (Fig. 4A). In contrast, inactivation of rpa190-1 led to loading of Rad52-HA to rDNA chromatin (Fig. 4A). The association of Rad52-HA with rDNA does not appear to be sequence-specific, as Rad52 was detected throughout the entire rDNA repeat (data not shown), and the total Rad52-HA protein level remained relatively constant during the experiment (Fig. 4B). In WT cells, repression of rDNA transcription by rapamycin or nutrient starvation is accompanied by condensin-mediated rDNA condensation (14Tsang C.K. Li H. Zheng X.S. EMBO J. 2007; 26: 448-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that such rDNA compaction is important to protect rDNA integrity by keeping Rad52 out of the nucleolus. To test this, we inactivated condensin by shifting ycs4-2 cells to nonpermissive temperature, followed by treating these cells with rapamycin to inhibit rDNA transcription, and then analyzed Rad52 localization (Fig. 5A, upper panel). In ycs4-2 cells at the permissive temperature or WT cells at both permissive and restrictive temperatures, rapamycin caused rDNA condensation, as evidenced by nucleolar contraction (14Tsang C.K. Li H. Zheng X.S. EMBO J. 2007; 26: 448-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) (Fig. 5A, lower panel). In these cells, Rad52 remained to be excluded from the nucleolus (Fig. 5, A and B). In contrast, after inactivation of condensin in ycs4-2 strain at the restrictive temperature, repression of rDNA transcription by rapamycin caused entry of Rad52 into the nucleolus (Fig. 5, A and B). We further found that nutrient starvation had a similar effect on Rad52 localization (Fig. 5, C and D). These results indicate that condensin-mediated rDNA condensation prevents the entry of Rad52 into the nucleolus and Rad52-dependent homologous recombination.FIGURE 5Condensation of rDNA is necessary to prevent Rad52 localization to the nucleolus during rapamycin treatment or nutrient starvation. A, upper panel, shown is a schematic representation of the experimental procedure.

Samples were harvested at different times for IF analysis. Localization of Rad52-HA was analyzed by IF using an anti-HA antibody.

Viability was assessed by the colony formation assay. As shown in Fig. 6A, rapamycin treatment drastically reduced cell viability in the ycs4-2 strain at a restrictive temperature, which was suppressed by RAD52 deletion. Similarly, rpa190-1 cells showed Rad52-dependent cell death when Pol I was inactivated (Fig. 6B). These results demonstrate that Rad52-dependent rDNA instability is a catastrophic event. Rad52 is required for HR events as well as single-strand annealing and gene conversion (25Symington L.S. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2002; 66: 630-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (815) Google Scholar). Rad52-mediated homologous recombination involves other Rad52 epistasis genes, including the Rad51 family (Rad51, Rad54, and Rad55), Rad59, and the Mre11 family (e.g. Xrs2) (25Symington L.S. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2002; 66: 630-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (815) Google Scholar). To further characterize the HR machinery responsible for rDNA instability, we deleted representative genes from each group in the rpa190-1 background and investigated the effect on rDNA instability. As shown in Fig. 7, rad51Δ, rad54Δ, and rad55Δ mutations also suppressed the rDNA instability phenotype, although to a lesser extent than rad52Δ. This is likely due to the functional redundancy among genes within each subfamily. Rad59 is known to function specifically in intrachromosomal recombination (29Bai Y. Symington L.S. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2025-2037Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). The rad59Δ phenotype further supports the role of intrachromosomal recombination in rDNA instability. rad51Δ suppressed rDNA instability phenotype less well than rad52Δ, indicating that both Rad51-dependent and Rad51-independent pathways are involved in rDNA instability. In contrast, deletion of XRS2 did not block rDNA instability (Fig. 7). Because Xrs2 is mainly responsible for sister chromatid homologous recombination (25Symington L.S. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2002; 66: 630-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (815) Google Scholar), our results suggest that intrachromosomal recombination but not sister chromatid recombination mediates rDNA instability under the studied conditions. In addition, the yuk70Δ mutation did not affect rDNA instability, indicating that nonhomologous end joining is not involved. Taken together, these results suggest that the Rad51 subfamily and Rad59 HR proteins are involved in Rad52-dependent intrachromosomal recombination of rDNA. In the present study, we show that when rDNA transcription is repressed in the absence of proper condensin-mediated rDNA condensation, Rad52 readily enters the nucleolus, leading to rDNA instability. Together with our previous observations, these results indicate an antagonistic role of condensin and Rad52 in the maintenance of rDNA stability. (For a model, see Fig. 8.) Rad52 is a key component of the HR machinery involved in error-free DNA repair and genomic maintenance, including the rDNA region (25Symington L.S. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2002; 66: 630-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (815) Google Scholar). In contrast to other genomic regions, Rad52-dependent DSB repair of the highly repetitive rDNA array is regulated differently. Rad52 is normally excluded from the nucleolus in both yeast and mammals (this study) (28Torres-Rosell J. Sunjevaric I. De Piccoli G. Sacher M. Eckert-Boulet N. Reid R. Jentsch S. Rothstein R. Aragón L. Lisby M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2007; 9: 923-931Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar, 30Liu Y. Li M. Lee E.Y. Maizels N. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 975-978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the DSB region of rDNA exits transiently from the nucleolus, gaining access to Rad52 for HR-mediated repair (28Torres-Rosell J. Sunjevaric I. De Piccoli G. Sacher M. Eckert-Boulet N. Reid R. Jentsch S. Rothstein R. Aragón L. Lisby M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2007; 9: 923-931Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that nucleolar localization of Rad52 is deleterious and thus its accessibility to the nucleolus is restricted. Several studies have shown that Rad52 is required for homologous recombination of the rDNA array. Rad52 is responsible for the expansion of rDNA copy number by stimulating unequal sister chromatid recombination and spontaneous as well as aging-induced ERC formation by intrachromosomal recombination (7Kobayashi T. Horiuchi T. Tongaonkar P. Vu L. Nomura M. Cell. 2004; 117: 441-453Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 26Park P.U. Defossez P.A. Guarente L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3848-3856Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 27Johzuka K. Horiuchi T. Genes Cells. 2002; 7: 99-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Our study further demonstrates that Rad52 is required for nucleolar fragmentation and ERC formation when Pol I is repressed without proper rDNA condensation. Our study also provides insight into the mechanisms that prevent the invasion of Rad52 to the nucleolus to maintain rDNA stability. The accessibility of Rad52 to the nucleolus is restricted by active Pol I-dependent rDNA transcription during normal growth and condensin-mediated rDNA condensation during starvation conditions. Currently, the detail mechanism that causes Rad52 invasion to the rDNA array upon inhibition of rDNA transcription is still unknown. Our results suggest that actively transcribing rDNA has an intrinsic role in the maintenance of rDNA stability by keeping Rad52 off the nucleolus. It has been reported that inactivation of Rad52 small ubiquitin-like modifier modification or the Smc5-Smc6 complex causes rDNA hyper-recombination and accumulation of ERC in budding yeast (28Torres-Rosell J. Sunjevaric I. De Piccoli G. Sacher M. Eckert-Boulet N. Reid R. Jentsch S. Rothstein R. Aragón L. Lisby M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2007; 9: 923-931Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). In agreement with this finding, we demonstrated that invasion of Rad52 to the nucleolus causes uncontrolled HR and subsequent ERC formation. Although it remains to be determined whether Pol I-dependent rDNA transcription has a direct role in regulating Smc5-Smc6 activity or Rad52 small ubiquitin-like modifier modification, a simple explanation of our observation is that transcriptionally inactive rDNA in an uncondensed state may provide an “open” chromatin structure that is susceptible to Rad52 binding. Once in the nucleolus, Rad52 apparently mediates inappropriate HR among the highly repetitive homologous sequences of rDNA repeats, leading to elevated ERC formation and cell death. These catastrophic events are prevented in WT strains because rDNA transcriptional repression during starvation is always accompanied by condensin-mediated rDNA compaction (Fig. 8). Our study indicates that the recruitment of Rad52 to rDNA precedes the formation of ERC and a fragmented nucleolus, suggesting that Rad52 is the cause of rDNA instability by stimulating hyperhomologous recombination, leading to ERC formation. It has been reported that Rad52 and its epistasis groups are recruited to the damaged DNA in a stepwise, temporally distinct manner for the assembly of HR machinery. Specifically, Rad51 appears to associate with the DNA first, followed by Rad52, Rad55, and Rad54 (31Wolner B. van Komen S. Sung P. Peterson C.L. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 221-232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). In addition, the Rad52-mediated HR requires multiple steps, including end resection, strand invasion, strand exchange and DNA synthesis, formation and movement of Holliday junction, and finally, resolution of the junction (32Shiloh Y. Lehmann A.R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 923-928Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). By using a pair of LEU2 direct repeat and homothallic switching endonuclease induced deletion assays, it has been demonstrated that the Rad52-dependent intrachromosomal homologous recombination reaction is complete by ∼5 h after induction of DSB (33Smith J. Rothstein R. Genetics. 1999; 151: 447-458PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with this kinetic study, we show that there is a similar length of a “latent period” between the time of Rad52 binding to rDNA and the detection of ERC and fragmented nucleolus. This may explain the early detection of Rad52 association with rDNA and late formation of ERC and fragmented nucleolus. Sir2 is an NAD+-dependent histone deacetylase responsible for silencing the Pol II-transcribed genes and suppression of both intra- and interchromosomal recombination events in rDNA (34Gottlieb S. Esposito R.E. Cell. 1989; 56: 771-776Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar, 35Smith J.S. Brachmann C.B. Pillus L. Boeke J.D. Genetics. 1998; 149: 1205-1219Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Sir2-dependent rDNA silencing requires active Pol I-dependent transcription (36Buck S.W. Sandmeier J.J. Smith J.S.

Ganley A.R.D. Science. 2005; 309: 1581-1584Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Therefore, during active transcription under normal growth, Sir2 is required for the maintenance of rDNA stability. However, inhibition of Sir2 by splitomicin or by the sir2Δ mutation in young yeast cells does not cause significant ERC formation (data not shown), suggesting that there is a novel mechanism(s) for actively transcribed rDNA to prevent Rad52 invasion. In conclusion, our present study further supports the dual role of Rad52 in controlling rDNA stability. Under normal physiological conditions, it functions to maintain genomic stability through a controlled DSB repair mechanism outside the nucleolus. However, inappropriate Rad52 localization to the nucleolus causes catastrophic events, such as cellular lifespan and reduced viability by stimulating ERC formation.

https://openalex.org/W1994751262,"In the 3'-untranslated region, the destabilizing adenine-uridine (AU)-rich elements (AREs) control the expression of several transcripts through interactions with ARE-binding proteins (AUBPs) and RNA degradation machinery. Although the fundamental role for AUBPs and associated factors in eliciting ARE-dependent degradation of cognate mRNAs has been recently highlighted, the molecular mechanisms underlying the specific regulation of individual mRNA turnover have not yet been fully elucidated. Here we focused on the post-transcriptional regulation of bcl-2 mRNA in human cell lines under different conditions and genetic backgrounds. In the context of an AUBPs silencing approach, HuR knockdown reduced the expression of endogenous bcl-2, whereas unexpectedly, a bcl-2 ARE-reporter transcript increased significantly, suggesting that HuR expression has opposite effects on endogenous and ectopic bcl-2 ARE. Moreover, evidence was provided for the essential, specific and dose-dependent role of the Bcl-2 protein in regulating the decay kinetics of its own mRNA, as ascertained by a luciferase reporter system. Altogether, the data support a model whereby the Bcl-2 protein is the major determinant of its own ARE-dependent transcript half-life in living cells and its effect overcomes the activity of ARE-binding proteins."

These polymers play a pivotal role in virulence and have been implicated in a diverse range of physiological functions. The TagF-like family of enzymes has been shown to be responsible for wall teichoic acid priming and polymerization events. Although many such enzymes are well validated therapeutic targets, a mechanistic understanding of this enzyme family has remained elusive. TagF is the prototypical teichoic acid polymerase and uses CDP-glycerol to catalyze synthesis of the linear (1,3)-linked poly(glycerol phosphate) teichoic acid in Bacillus subtilis 168. Here we used a synthetic soluble analog of the natural substrate of the enzyme, Lipid , to conduct the first detailed mechanistic investigation of teichoic acid polymerization. Through the use of a new high pressure liquid chromatography-based assay to monitor single glycerol phosphate incorporations into the Lipid analog, we conducted a detailed analysis of reaction product formation patterns and unequivocally showed TagF to be non-processive in vitro. Furthermore by monitoring the kinetics of polymerization, we showed that Lipid analog species varying in size have the same K(m) value of 2.6 microm and validated use of Bi Bi velocity expressions to model the TagF enzyme system. Initial rate analysis showed that TagF catalyzes a sequential Bi Bi mechanism where both substrates are added to the enzyme prior to product release consistent with a single displacement chemical mechanism."

The denatured protein is discharged into the chamber, making this heptamer ring folding-active, where productive folding proceeds (11Weissman J.S. Hohl C.M. Kovalenko O. Kashi Y. Chen S. Braig K.

In the transition from “closed” to “open” conformation, apical domain of each GroEL subunit in the ring is shifted upward and outward, and the cleft between apical and equatorial domains opens.

The football complex contains two open rings; the bullet complex contains one closed and one open ring, and free GroEL is made up of two closed rings. Previously, we generated the GroEL in which two rings in GroEL were locked in a closed conformation by disulfide cross-link between apical and equatorial domains in the same GroEL subunits (23Murai N.

This GroEL can bind ATP and denatured protein but fails to process further reaction steps such as ATP hydrolysis, GroES binding, and release of substrate protein. We report here the opposite version; open conformation-specific inter-subunit cross-links were introduced into the GroEL ring. Using this cross-linking as a probe of open conformation, we found that one ring was open in ADP (GroELO), although two rings were open in ATP (GroELOO). The isolated GroELO and GroELOO, which were nucleotide-free, formed a stable bullet and football complex with GroES even in the absence of any nucleotide.

For isolation of GroELO, GroEL(2Cys) (1 μm) was incubated with 5 mm ADP in HKM buffer for 50 h at 25 °C. For isolation of GroELOO, GroEL(2Cys) (0.5 μm) was incubated with 5 mm ATP and 10 μm diamide in HKM buffer for 5 h at 25 °C. The solutions were loaded to a butyl-650 TOYOPEARL column equilibrated with 25 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.4, 100 mm KCl, and 1 mm EDTA. The column was washed with the same buffer, and the protein was eluted with 25 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.4. Cross-linking assays were carried out as follows. GroEL(2Cys) (0.5 μm) was incubated with 20 μm diamide in the presence or absence of 5 mm nucleotide (ATP or ADP) for 2 h at 25 °C unless otherwise stated. The ATP regeneration system (10 mm phosphoenolpyruvate and 5 μg/ml pyruvate kinase) was added to the assay mixture in the case of incubation with ATP. When indicated, GroES (2 μm), BeCl2 (1 mm) plus NaF (10 mm), and urea-denatured MDH (1 μm) were added. Reaction was quenched by adding 10 mm N-ethylmaleimide. Cross-linking was analyzed by nonreducing SDS-PAGE using 5–20% gradient gel. Gel filtration HPLC was used to detect binding of GroES and substrate protein to GroEL. A column (G3000SWXL) was equilibrated with HKM buffer containing 50 mm Na2SO4. The flow rate was 0.5 ml/min. To test GroES binding, GroES-Cy3 (0.5 μm) and GroEL (0.2 μm) were mixed, and an aliquot (10 μl) was applied to the column. To test substrate protein binding, MDH-BODIPY (12.4 μm) denatured in 6.6 m urea was diluted to 0.5 μm in HKM buffer containing 0.2 μm GroEL. The mixture was incubated for 5 min and centrifuged (15,000 × g, 5 min), and supernatant (10 μl) was applied to the column. The elution was monitored by an in-line fluorometer (for GroES-Cy3, excitation at 550 nm, emission at 570 nm, and for MDH-BODIPY, excitation at 490 nm, emission at 520 nm). To know the stoichiometry of the bound GroES versus GroELO and GroELOO, GroEL (1 μm) and GroES (5 μm) were mixed and incubated with 1 mm ATP, ADP, or none. The mixture was loaded to gel filtration HPLC equilibrated with HKM buffer containing the indicated nucleotide (0.2 mm), and the fraction containing GroEL was analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The intensities of the bands stained by Coomassie Brilliant Blue were quantified by Scion Image. The 1:1 wild-type GroEL-GroES complex made in ADP and SR398-GroES complex made in ATP were used for calibration. SR398, a single-ring version of GroEL with the additional mutation D398A, has very weak ATPase and is unable to dissociate GroES even in ATP. GroELO and GroELOO (each 47 nm) were incubated with 3-fold excess of GroES (147 nm) in HKM buffer for 10 min. An aliquot of the solution was applied directly on a specimen grid covered with a carbon support film. The specimen was immediately stained with 2.0% uranyl acetate and observed with an electron microscope (JEM-1230, JEOL). ADP hydrolyzed by GroEL was measured spectrophotometrically with an ATP-regenerating system. The assay mixture contained 0.2 mm NADH, 5 mm phosphoenolpyruvate, 50 μg/ml pyruvate kinase, 50 μg/ml lactate dehydrogenase, and 1 mm ATP. When indicated, GroES (1 μm) and urea-denatured MDH (1 μm) were included. The reaction was initiated by injection of GroEL (final concentration, 0.1 μm) into the assay mixture. The decreases in the absorbance at 340 nm were monitored continuously with a spectrophotometer (V550, Jasco, Japan). In the crystal structure of 1:1 GroEL-GroES bullet complex containing ADP (Protein Data Bank code 1AON (14Xu Z. Horwich A.L. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1997; 388: 741-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (1044) Google Scholar)), Ala-384 of one GroEL subunit in the open heptamer ring attached by a GroES lid is very close (Cα-Cα distance, ∼6.4 Å) to Ser-509 of the neighboring subunit (Fig. 1). A corresponding pair of residues in the heptamer ring of the opposite side, which is in a closed conformation and does not have a GroES lid, lies distant to each other (Cα-Cα distance, ∼26.8 Å). Starting from a cysteine-less version of GroEL in which three endogenous cysteines of the wild-type GroEL were replaced with alanine (C138A, C458A, and C519A (27Brinker A. Pfeifer G. Kerner M.J. Naylor D.J. Hartl F.U. Hayer-Hartl M. Cell. 2001; 107: 223-233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar)), we further replaced Ala-384 and Ser-509 with cysteines. The resultant mutant GroEL(2Cys) showed nearly equal activities to WT-GroEL in facilitating MDH folding (data not shown) and in ATP hydrolysis (see below). Under oxidizing conditions, introduced cysteines in GroEL(2Cys) were expected to form a disulfide cross-link between neighboring subunits only when the heptamer ring was in the open conformation. If oxidation is complete, seven GroEL subunits in the open ring would make a circular (or linear) cross-linked heptamer. Therefore, cross-linking is a good probe to know whether the ring is in open conformation. In the presence of diamide as an oxidizing reagent, GroEL(2Cys) was incubated with none, ADP, or ATP and was analyzed with nonreducing SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2A). Without nucleotide, only a protein band of monomer GroEL subunit was observed (Fig. 2A, lane 1). In ADP, the density of the monomer subunit band decreased to about half, and two high molecular weight bands appeared (Fig. 2A, lane 2). In ATP, almost all the monomer GroEL subunit was shifted to two high molecular weight bands (Fig. 2A, lane 3). When oxidation was interrupted by sulfhydryl modification that was caused by a high concentration of diamide, a ladder of eight bands, including two high molecular weight bands, was seen (Fig. 2A, lane 7). The top band did not contain the free sulfhydryl group because when stained by the SH-reactive fluorescent reagent, only the top band was not stained. Therefore, these bands corresponded to (from the top) the circularly cross-linked heptamer, the linearly cross-linked heptamer, hexamer, pentamer, and so on. By reducing treatment prior to electrophoresis, these high molecular bands disappeared, and the monomer band intensity was recovered (Fig. 2A, lane 8). For each sample, loss of the monomer band intensity, compared with the corresponding sample with prior reducing treatment, was measured (Fig. 2A, monomer loss). The number of open rings in a GroEL molecule in ADP and in ATP, estimated from (2× monomer loss), was 0.84 and 1.9, respectively. Thus, GroEL with single open ring (GroELO) was generated in ADP and GroEL with double open rings (GroELOO) in ATP. Similar results were obtained by oxidation with other oxidants, such as CuCl2, H2O2, and air oxygen (data not shown). Interestingly, the results were not influenced by the presence of GroES (Fig. 2A, lanes 4–6) and/or a substrate protein (denatured MDH) (Fig. 2B). Multiple turnover in ATP hydrolysis is not necessary to produce GroELOO because the inclusion of BeFx, an inhibitor of ATP hydrolysis (22Taguchi H. Tsukuda K. Motojima F. Koike-Takeshita A. Yoshida M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 45737-45743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), did not change the nucleotide dependence of cross-linking (Fig. 2C). These results imply that open and closed conformations of the two rings of GroEL are governed by nucleotide: two open rings in ATP, one in ADP, and none without nucleotide. Generation of GroELOO and GroELO was examined at various ATP and ADP concentrations. Even though cross-link formation was irreversible under the conditions and therefore tended to give overestimation of the open ring state, the results could provide approximate estimation of ATP and ADP concentrations required for the conformational transition. Incubation of 0.5 μm GroEL(2Cys) in 5 μm ATP resulted in a 45% loss of the monomer band (Fig. 3A), indicating that occupation of seven nucleotide-binding sites of one GroEL ring by ATP is sufficient to induce the closed-to-open transition of one ring. Further increase in ATP concentration up to 50 μm induced the transition of another ring, producing GroELOO. Contrary to the two-step generation of GroELOO, GroELO generation by ADP showed simple dependence on ADP concentration and was saturated at 50 μm ADP (Fig. 3B). Next, GroEL(2Cys) was incubated in the presence of 1 mm ATP plus varying concentrations of ADP. The extent of monomer loss caused by 1 mm ATP was not affected by ADP below 0.6 mm, but it started to decrease as ADP concentration increased to 0.8 and 1 mm ADP (Fig. 3C). Because GroELO was generated in ADP, the observed decrease in the extent of monomer loss should be due to the inhibition of GroELOO generation from GroELO. Thus, ADP inhibits moderately ATP-induced GroELOO generation, most likely by competing for the same nucleotide-binding sites on GroEL. GroELOO was purified from the incubated mixture of GroEL(2Cys), ATP, and diamide. GroELO was formed by air oxidation in ADP and was purified. The purified GroELOO, as well as GroELO, did not contain any endogenously bound nucleotide. Transition from the purified GroELO to GroELOO depended on ATP, and ADP counteracted ATP in this transition in a manner similar to Fig. 3C (data not shown). To measure the binding of GroES, GroEL was incubated with 2.5 m excess GroES-Cy3 and applied to gel filtration HPLC monitored by fluorescence (Fig. 4A). Nucleotide was omitted throughout the experiments. As expected, WT-GroEL, as well as reduced GroEL(2Cys), were unable to bind GroES-Cy3 in the absence of nucleotide. However, GroELO bound about half of the added GroES-Cy3, and GroELOO bound most of the added GroES-Cy3. To know the accurate number of bound GroES and the effect of nucleotides, GroEL was incubated with 5 m excess GroES and applied to gel filtration HPLC, and the peak fraction of GroEL was analyzed with SDS-PAGE after reducing treatment (Fig. 4B). The same buffer, which contained ADP, ATP, or no nucleotide, was used for incubation and elution. The 1:1 WT-GroEL-GroES complex, which was formed in ADP, and the 1:1 single ring SR398-GroES complex (corresponding to 1:2 GroEL-GroES), which was formed in ATP, were used as calibration standards for estimation of GroEL:GroES molar ratio from band intensity. The molar ratios of GroELOO:GroES were 1:1.7 in the absence of nucleotide, 1:2.0 in ADP, and 1:2.0 in ATP. The molar ratios of GroELO:GroES were 1:0.7 without nucleotide, 1:1.1 in ADP, and 1:1.2 in ATP. Thus, regardless of nucleotide conditions, GroELOO and GroELO always generate a 1:2 GroELOO-GroES complex (football complex) and 1:1 GroELO:GroES complex (bullet complex), respectively. Electron microscopic images of these complexes stained by uranyl acetate were very similar to those of the typical bullet complex and football complex (Fig. 4C). The stability of the GroELOO-GroES football complex was assessed by the loss of GroES-Cy3 from the GroELOO-GroES-Cy3 football complex in the presence of a large excess of nonlabeled GroES. In 1 h, half of GroES-Cy3 was lost in the absence of nucleotide but only 5% was lost in ATP and ADP (data not shown). The binding of denatured protein to GroELO and GroELOO was examined by using fluorescently labeled MDH-BODIPY (Fig. 5). Urea-denatured MDH-BODIPY was diluted into the solution of GroEL. The aggregation was removed by centrifugation, and the supernatant was applied to gel filtration HPLC monitored with fluorescence. In the case of WT-GroEL and reduced GroEL(2Cys), MDH-BODIPY was eluted at the position of GroEL, indicating stable binding of these substrate proteins to GroEL. GroELO also bound MDH-BODIPY, although the bound amount was less than WT-GroEL. In the case of GroELOO, very little fluorescence was eluted at the position of GroEL, indicating that GroELOO cannot form a stable complex with denatured substrate protein. As is well known, ATPase activity of GroEL is suppressed by GroES and stimulated by substrate protein (denatured MDH) (16Rye H.S. Roseman A.M. Chen S. Furtak K. Fenton W.A. Saibil H.R. Horwich A.L.

Chem. 2000; 275: 13755-13758Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) (Fig. 6). ATPase activity of the reduced GroEL(2Cys) also showed the same response to GroES and substrate protein. ATPase activity of GroELO was somehow small (∼20% of the reduced control). It was suppressed by GroES and was stimulated 4-fold by denatured MDH. GroELOO had larger ATPase activity than GroELO, and this activity was suppressed by GroES. However, in agreement with loss of ability to bind substrate protein as described, it was not stimulated by denatured MDH. It is worth noting that the GroELOO-GroES complex is very stable in ATP, as stated before, and therefore catalytic turnover of ATP hydrolysis does not induce dissociation of GroES from the complex. Even though the conformation-locked GroEL cannot carry out the whole functional cycle, it exhibits the partial functions exclusively attributable to the GroEL in the defined conformational states. We previously showed (23Murai N. Makino Y. Yoshida M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28229-28234Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) that the GroEL locked in the double-closed ring conformation can bind substrate protein and ATP, but it cannot hydrolyze ATP nor bind GroES. Here we showed that the GroEL locked in the double open ring conformation can bind GroES and hydrolyze ATP but cannot bind substrate protein in a stable manner. These features have been inferred before and here we show them unambiguously. We adopted open conformation-specific cross-link formation as a probe of conformational transition of GroEL, and we found that ATP generates GroELOO whereas ADP generates GroELO. Without nucleotide, the open ring is not generated in GroEL. Isolated GroELOO and GroELO lack endogenously bound nucleotide, and they can bind GroES in the absence of nucleotide, generating football complex and bullet complex, respectively. It is now clear that ATP and ADP induce opening motion of one and two rings, respectively, but they are not essential for subsequent GroES binding. Another interesting observation is the inhibitory effect of ADP on ATP-induced GroELOO formation. This observation implies that the population of GroEL molecules in the double open ring conformation is dependent on ATP/ADP balance as indicated previously (31Sameshima T. Ueno T. Iizuka R. Ishii N. Terada N. Okabe K. Funatsu T. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 23765-23773Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Inhibition by ADP is moderate, and therefore, it is reasonable to assume that in normal physiological conditions, where ATP is severalfold more abundant than ADP, most GroEL molecules can take the double open ring conformation. It has been widely accepted that two rings of GroEL alternate the GroES-sealed, folding active state during the functional cycle. The critical reaction intermediate in this model is a bullet complex (16Rye H.S. Roseman A.M. Chen S. Furtak K. Fenton W.A. Saibil H.R. Horwich A.L. Cell. 1999; 97: 325-338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). However, this model was recently challenged by the findings that a football complex can be an active reaction intermediate. Sameshima et al. (31Sameshima T. Ueno T. Iizuka R. Ishii N. Terada N. Okabe K. Funatsu T. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 23765-23773Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) monitored the fluorescence resonance energy transfer between GroEL and GroES and found that nearly equivalent amounts of football and bullet complexes coexist in the mixture during the functional reaction cycle. Koike-Takeshita et al. (32Koike-Takeshita A. Yoshida M. Taguchi H. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 23774-23781Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) reported that a slow ATP-hydrolyzing GroEL mutant can bind substrate protein and GroES at both rings of the GroEL to generate a football complex. These two studies also suggested that the football complex is generated in ATP, and the bullet complex is in ADP. The results reported here are in good agreement with the above observations and add more support for the mechanism that includes a football complex as an intermediate. We thank Dr. K. Mitsuoka for the help with observing electron microscopic images."
