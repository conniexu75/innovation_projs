https://openalex.org/W1546589453,"Abstract 1. Apo-superoxide dismutase was more labile toward a variety of inactivating stresses than was the holoenzyme. 2. Cu++ restored catalytic activity to the apoenzyme and markedly enhanced its thermal stability but Cu++ plus Zn++ were needed to attain the stability of the native enzyme. 3. Co++ or Hg++ were able to replace Zn++ in increasing the thermal stability of the Cu++-repleted apoenzyme. Indeed, the enzyme containing Hg++ + Cu++ was more stable than the native superoxide dismutase. In contrast no metal was found which could replace Cu++ in restoring activity to the apoenzyme. 4. Arrhenius plots showed that rates of irreversible inactivation were a biphasic function of temperature in the case of apo-superoxide dismutase but were monophasic in the presence of those metals which affected thermal stability. Metal binding apparently changed the pathway of thermal inactivation. 5. Since excess Cu++ could not substitute for Cu++ + Zn++ and since excess Zn++ could not prevent the effect of Cu++ we conclude that the Cu++ site cannot bind Zn++ and the Zn++ site cannot bind Cu++, although it can bind Co++ or Hg++. 6. Native superoxide dismutase retained much of its activity in the presence of 10.0 m urea or 4% sodium dodecyl sulfate and, although high concentrations of guanidinium chloride did inhibit, its effects were reversible by dialysis or dilution. 7. Guanidinium-chloride did however perturb the structure of the holoenzyme in a way which rendered its metals accessible to EDTA such that exposure to EDTA plus guanidinium chloride resulted in progressive inactivation. 8. It appears likely, on the basis of data available at present, that Zn++ plays a structural role in the bovine erythrocyte superoxide dismutase and lends it enhanced stability whereas Cu++ is directly involved in the catalytic cycle."

https://openalex.org/W1585431411,"Cytoplasmic aspartate aminotransferase possesses five free sulfhydryl groups per monomer. In the native enzyme two thiol groups (groups I and II) appear to be positioned on the exterior of the molecule as reflected by their reactivity toward sulfhydryl reagents. Modification of these two groups does not impair catalytic activity; blocking by N-ethylmaleimide even increases the activity to 125%. One further thiol group (group III) reacts at a rate five orders of magnitude slower than either one of the exterior thiol groups. The remaining sulfhydryl groups (groups IV and V) are nonreactive in the native enzyme. The reactivity of thiol group III changes within two orders of magnitude during the course of catalysis. The reactivity is lowest in the free pyridoxal enzyme and is slightly increased in the presence of the substrate analogs α-methyl aspartate or erythro-β-hydroxyaspartate which form either the aldimine or the semiquinoide intermediates, respectively. Maximal reactivity is attained in the presence of the substrate pair glutamate and α-ketoglutarate, when an equilibrium of all covalent enzyme-substrate intermediates is established. Thus, thiol group III appears to be most reactive in the ketimine intermediate. The alterations in reactivity from intermediate to intermediate are interpreted to reflect conformational changes of the enzyme-coenzyme-substrate complex occurring syncatalytically, i.e. during catalysis. Modifications of thiol group III with N-ethylmaleimide, 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoate), or tetranitromethane reduce aminotransferase activity to less than 5% of the initial value. The derivative modified with 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoate) is fully reactivated by deblocking of thiol group III. Enzymatic activity is also markedly reduced in mixed disulfide derivatives between thiol group III and glutathione, sulfite, mercaptoethanol, or methyl mercaptan. In contrast, the enzyme derivative modified with cyanide was found to be 60% enzymatically active. Apparently, bulky or charged substituents on thiol group III impair the catalytic activity, whereas modification with the small and uncharged S-cyano group is compatible with virtually full transaminase activity. Thus, sulfhydryl group III seems not to have an essential role in either catalysis or maintenance of an active enzyme conformation. The specificity of chemical modifications of the different classes of thiol groups was confirmed by analysis of the CNBr peptides. From a CNBr fragment of the enzyme derivative modified with cyanide at thiol group III the tryptic peptide containing the labeled residue was isolated. Its sequence (Cys, Gly, Leu, Thr)Thr-Lys indicates that thiol group III is located in the COOH-terminal portion of tryptic peptide 22 reported by Ovchinnikov et al. ((1971) Fed. Eur. Biochem. Soc. Lett. 17, 133)."

https://openalex.org/W1513633398,"The soluble fraction from beef heart homogenate is known to stimulate phospholipid exchange between cell membrane fractions. A purification procedure, consisting of pH adjustment to 5.1, gel filtration on Sephadex G-75, and isoelectric focusing between pH 4 and 6, yielded two fractions with high phospholipid exchange activities per mg of protein. The fraction with the highest specific activity focused at pH 5.5 and showed only one minor contaminant on polyacrylamide disc gel electrophoresis. The other fraction, which focused at pH 4.7, exhibited a major band on disc gel electrophoresis, and several minor bands. Upon elution from the polyacrylamide gel only the major bands yielded eluates that stimulated phospholipid exchange. The highly purified as well as the crude fractions were used to measure the simultaneous exchange of phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, and sphingomyelin between antigen-sensitized and nonsensitized liposomes. In all instances phosphatidylcholine exchanged much faster than sphingomyelin, but the amount of sphingomyelin exchanged compared to that of phosphatidylcholine did not differ for the most highly purified and the cruder fractions from beef heart supernatant. This suggests that the exchange of phosphatidylcholine and sphingomyelin may be catalyzed by the same protein or by two proteins which were not separated by the procedures employed here. Little or no exchange of phosphatidylethanolamine was observed with any of the beef heart fractions at various stages of purification. Exchange of cholesterol between liposomes was more rapid than that of phosphatidylcholine in the absence of phospholipid exchange protein. The soluble fraction of beef heart homogenate adjusted to pH 5.1 did not stimulate cholesterol exchange."

https://openalex.org/W1568485581,"Abstract Sternal cartilages of 13- and 14-day-old chick embryos were cultured in a chemically defined medium containing [3H]glycine for labeling and β-aminopropionitrile to inhibit cross-linking of newly synthesized collagen. Native collagen extracted from cultured sternal cartilages yields, on denaturation, only a single type of α chain which was unequivocally identified as α1(II) by comparing the chromatographic properties of CNBr peptides derived from labeled chains with those from authentic α1(II). Examination of the CNBr peptides derived from α1(II) synthesized during relatively short pulse-labeling periods with [14C]glycine revealed an uneven distribution of label throughout the chain, and the specific activity data has been used in conjunction with available chemical evidence to establish the linear order of the CNBr peptides in α1(II) as: 1–4–6–12–11–8–10–5–9–7–14–15. These data, then, allow the localization of all of the CNBr peptides in α1(II), with the exception of peptides 2 and 3, which together account for only six amino acids of the chain. Calculations based on the specific activity gradients observed for the CNBr peptides after pulse labeling indicate an apparent synthesis time of 4.5 min for α1(II), in good agreement with previous studies on the synthesis of α1(I) and α2 chains of bone collagen."

https://openalex.org/W1520622869,"Abstract The initial membrane reaction in the biosynthesis of peptidoglycan is catalyzed by phospho-N-acetylmuramyl-pentapeptide translocase (UDP-MurNAc - l - Ala - d - γ-Glu - l - Lys - d - Ala - d - Ala:undecaprenyl - phosphate phospho - MurNAc-pentapeptide transferase). In addition to the transfer reaction, the enzyme catalyzes the exchange of [3H]uridine monophosphate with the uridine monophosphate moiety of UDP - MurNAc - pentapeptide. Lipid-dependent translocase was obtained in an inactive form by gel filtration of membranes from Staphylococcus aureus Copenhagen on agarose A-50m in the presence of 1% Triton X-100. The excluded fraction was depleted of undecaprenyl-diphosphate-MurNAc-pentapeptide (g95%) and partially depleted of undecaprenyl-phosphate (g75%). After removal of Triton X-100, the translocase was reactivated with a lipid extract from membranes of S. aureus Copenhagen. The translocase was partially reactivated (10 to 30%) by the addition of dioleoyl phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylcholine (plant), phosphatidylglycerol, and, to a lesser extent, by phosphatidylinositol and phosphatidylethanolamine when added in the presence of 1 x 10-3 m sodium lauroyl sarcosinate. The optimal concentration of dioleoyl phosphatidylcholine was 1.2 x 10-4 m. Maximal reactivation of the exchange reaction required the addition of either 5 x 10-7 m undecaprenyl-diphosphate - MurNAc - pentapeptide or 1 x 10-6 m undecaprenyl-phosphate to lipid-dependent translocase in the presence of dioleoyl phosphatidylcholine and sodium lauroyl sarcosinate. Thus, for activity in the exchange reaction, the translocase requires a phosphatide and is markedly stimulated by the addition of either undecaprenyl-phosphate or undecaprenyl-diphosphate-MurNAc-pentapeptide. The implications of the results with the undecaprenyl derivatives are discussed in relation to proposed reaction mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W1945911065,"Abstract Leucine aminopeptidase and aminopeptidase M have been covalently bound to an arylamine derivative of porous glass. The bound forms of both enzymes retain 100% of their activities at saturating levels of substrate (leucine p-nitroanilide). For the hydrolysis at pH 7.3 and 25° κcat values for bound and free leucine aminopeptidase are 46 ± 5 s-1 and 46 ± 2 s-1, respectively; for aminopeptidase M (pH 7.5 and 25°) κcat values are 23 ± 2 s-1 and 21 ± 0.4 s-1, respectively. Although the Michaelis constants for both enzymes increase on binding, the pH and temperature dependencies of the bound enzymes remain unchanged. These data suggest that the environments and conformations of the enzymes are not significantly changed after coupling to the solid support. The apparent decrease in the binding of substrate could be explained by a decrease in the effective diffusion coefficient of the substrate. Both insoluble enzymes are active against polypeptide substrates. After treatment for removal of contaminating endopeptidases, the immobilized derivatives of leucine aminopeptidase and aminopeptidase M were used successfully in NH2-terminal sequence determination. The bound aminopeptidase M appears to be the better of the two for this purpose. Both bound enzymes will catalyze the hydrolysis of the aminoethylated A and B chains of insulin nearly to completion (≥87% recovery of free amino acids in all cases). These digests are carried out at pH values near neutrality in a volatile buffer with no activating metal. Immobilized pronase (Royer, G. P., and Green, G. M. (1971) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 44, 426) was used in concert with bound leucine aminopeptidase and bound aminopeptidase M for the hydrolysis of β-lactoglobulin. In both cases the recovery of free amino acids was 93%. These bound enzymes should be quite useful in amino acid composition determinations when acid-labile residues such as tryptophan, glutamine, asparagine, or certain affinity labeled side chains are present."

By contrast, desaturation by liver preparations (stearoyl-CoA at pH 6.0) was less than by brain in fetal and suckling rats and increased rapidly after weaning to 50-fold values in adults. Fasting only slightly decreased desaturation by adult and 10-day-old brain, but it markedly depressed desaturation by liver particularly in adults. Refeeding stimulated activity in adult liver but gave varied results with adult brain and 10-day-old brain and liver. The monoene-forming system in rat brain appears most important for independence from diet when liver enzyme activity is low. It contributes significantly to normal maturation of the central nervous system and may ensure the supply of monoenes in the brain of the starving adult."

https://openalex.org/W1520626670,"Abstract The aminotripeptidase (tripeptidase:aminoacyl oligopeptide hydrolase, EC 3.4.1.3) of swine kidney has been isolated as three different homogeneous proteins that differ in chromatographic behavior, molecular weight, and in other properties. The enzyme is inactivated by certain sulfhydryl reagents and by some metal-chelating agents. Disulfide bonds are absent. Inactivation by the chelating agents can be reversed by the addition of certain metal ions. Although the enzyme contains zinc, the metal is not present in stoichiometric amount, and the role of this metal ion is unclear. Earlier and present studies of the specificity of the tripeptidase indicate that the enzyme does not hydrolyze di-, tetra-, or longer peptides, di- or tripeptide amides, or acyl peptides. Tripeptides with NH2-terminal glutamic or aspartic acids or with a central proline or hydroxyproline residue are resistant to hydrolysis. The enzyme is useful in ascertaining the sequence of tripeptides because of its rapid liberation of the NH2-terminal residue as the free amino acid. With longer peptides, it is convenient to remove one or more residues by the Edman degradation to leave the COOH-terminal tripeptide which can then be hydrolyzed by the enzyme. Phenylthiocarbamyl peptides or other products of the Edman procedure do not interfere with the hydrolysis of the residual free tripeptide."

https://openalex.org/W1532257562,"Abstract A direct comparison has been made of the time courses of ligand binding to, anion release from, and proton release from deoxyhemoglobin A. All three processes exhibit different kinetic features. To a first approximation, protons are expelled as each ligand molecule is bound, but anions are released only after several ligand molecules have been bound. Under conditions when the α and β chains react at the same rates with ligands (carbon monoxide binding in the absence of phosphates or n-butyl isocyanide binding at low ionic strength), the time course of proton release is proportional to the time course of ligand binding. However, when the β chains react more rapidly with ligands than the α chains (carbon monoxide binding in the presence of inositol hexaphosphate or n-butyl isocyanide binding in the presence of salts), a lag is observed in the time course of proton release. About 20% of the total amount of protons displaced are released during ligand binding to the β chains and the remaining 80% are released during ligand binding to the α chains. These results suggest that many microscopic conformational equilibria are required for an adequate description of the functional behavior of hemoglobin."

https://openalex.org/W1598296249,"Abstract Three peptide fragments were obtained from the S-carboxymethylated light (B) chain derivative of human plasmin after treatment with cyanogen bromide. The major cyanogen bromide fragment, containing over 80% of the amino acid residues, was found to contain the 3H-radiolabeled l-1-chloro-3-tosylamido-7-amino-2-heptanone active site. The active center residue was determined to be the NH2-terminal 18th residue of the major cyanogen bromide fragment. The NH2-terminal 20 residues of this fragment were determined to be -His-Phe-Cys-Gly-Gly-Thr-Leu-Ile-Ser-Pro-Glu-Trp-Val-Leu-Ser-Ala-Ala-His*-Cys-Leu-. This sequence contains the histidine of human plasmin; it is homologous to the loop sequence of other serine proteases."
https://openalex.org/W1618741211,"Abstract The reaction of n-butyl isocyanide with deoxyhemoglobin A has been examined as a function of pH and ionic strength in the presence and absence of inositol hexaphosphate. In solutions of high pH (about 9) or of low ionic strength at pH 7 the rates of n-butyl isocyanide binding to the α and β chains within deoxyhemoglobin are almost equal. At pH 7, increase of ionic strength decreases the rate of binding to α chains. The addition of inositol hexaphosphate accentuates this effect, and in its presence the rates of binding and affinities of the α chains are substantially reduced in relation to the corresponding β chain values. Although it is known that organic phosphates bind between the β chains (Arnone, A. (1972) Nature 237, 146–149), the main effect of inositol hexaphosphate is a modification of the ligand-binding properties of the α chains. Similarly, the addition of protons to solutions of deoxyhemoglobin exerts a greater effect on the functional properties of the α chains than on the β chains, even though, at neutral pH 50% of the additional number of protons bound to deoxyhemoglobin are associated with the imidazole group of histidine 146 β (Kilmartin, J. V., and Wootton, J. F. (1970) Nature 228, 766–767). These results show that the functional properties of hemoglobin cannot be explained solely in terms of the perturbation of a single microscopic conformational equilibrium since the properties of the individual α and β chains within deoxyhemoglobin are unequally influenced by anions and protons while those of liganded hemoglobin are not."

https://openalex.org/W1498622826,"Abstract The time dependence of appearance of radioactive protein in plasma of the toadfish, Opsanus tau, following rapid injection of 14C-labeled amino acids via the hepatic portal vein, has been studied at two temperatures in fish subjected to acute temperature change or to thermal acclimation. At 20° labeled protein appears in plasma after a lag of about 1 hour and accumulates exponentially with a half-time of 1.0 to 1.2 hours. Corresponding time constants at 10° are 6 hours and approximately 8 hours, however accumulation follows an S-shaped curve at this temperature. At the termination of the experiments plasma protein accounts for about 20% of total incorporation into protein by liver. Labeling patterns following intraperitoneal injection are slower and more complicated in shape. Turnover half-lives for 14C-labeled plasma proteins are 9 days for fish at 20° and about 16 days at 10°. Acclimation to cold (10°), a process of metabolic adjustment which causes about 50% elevation in protein synthetic rate in liver, produces only small changes in the time course and level of incorporation of amino acids into circulating plasma proteins. A kinetic model for the synthetic-secretory pathway in liver is proposed, involving three temperature-dependent processes: a migration phase which causes an absolute delay in secretion of labeled protein; a stage of collection or saturation of an intermediate compartment which produces a period of slow rise in the labeling curve; a rapid accumulation and plateau phase described by a set of reversible reactions for synthesis and discharge. Rate constants for the model are derived from the present data and previous results, which yield theoretical curves consistent with the observed kinetics, temperature dependency, and thermal acclimation effect."
https://openalex.org/W1629877603,"Abstract Evidence is presented that indicates that greater than 95% of the protein synthesized by intact rabbit reticulocytes is globin and that only globin nascent chains are found on the membrane-bound ribosomes from reticulocytes. This result conflicts with reports in the literature that approximately 14% of the protein synthesized by reticulocytes is non-globin and that 86% of the protein synthesized by membrane-bound ribosomes is non-globin (Bulova, S. I., and Burka, E. R. (1970) J. Biol. Chem. 245, 4907). Intact reticulocytes were incubated in the presence of either [3H]tyrosine or [3H]tryptophan, the cells were lysed, and the free ribosomes were sedimented. The postribosomal supernatant was precipitated with acid-acetone, and the precipitated material was chromatographed on a Sephadex G-100 column. Three main regions of protein were found. Bulova and Burka had designated the first two regions eluting from the column as non-globin protein and the third region as globin subunits. Material from each region was combined with uniformly labeled 14C-amino acid, globin that had been partially purified by passage through a DEAE-cellulose column before acid-acetone precipitation, and the mixture was digested with trypsin. Chromatography of the tryptic peptides on Dowex 50-X8 indicated that greater than 95% of the protein in each region is globin. Nascent chains on free ribosomes and membrane-bound ribosomes were prepared from intact reticulocytes incubated in the presence of [3H]tyrosine. Tryptic digestion of the nascent chains on the ribosomes yielded only globin peptides. Plots of the specific activity of tyrosine versus amino acid position in the globin chain declined linearly from the NH2-terminal to COOH-terminal ends of the chain and showed that the peptides had not arisen from free globin bound to the ribosomes. Additional experiments showed that no more than 25% of the radioactivity in the membrane-bound ribosomes could have arisen from contamination by free ribosomes."
https://openalex.org/W2022880854,"IT was reported by two of us that liver-zinc concentration is significantly higher in subjects dying from malignant disease than in non-malignant control series1. The increase was confined to parts of the liver which showed no macro or microscopic evidence of carcinomatous invasion. (The zinc content of the malignant deposits themselves is lower than that of normal liver.) Three explanations were considered. First, it was possible that the rise in liver zinc reflected a widespread premalignant change not peculiar to the liver. Second, it could be related to the poor nutritional state of most patients dying from malignant disease. Third, it could be a feature of the chemical defence reaction of normal liver tissue to invasion by malignant cells. These possibilities were further explored by measuring the zinc concentration in the liver, kidneys, heart muscle, spleen and pancreas of a further series of subjects. The analytical methods were as reported previously1,2. The results (Table 1) confirm the increase in liver zinc in apparently normal tissue in subjects dying from carcinoma but show no comparable increase in the zinc concentration of the kidney, heart, spleen and pancreas. The scatter of results in lung tissue was too wide to allow a firm negative conclusion."

https://openalex.org/W1902570768,"Abstract By a combination of 15N-, 3H-, and 14C-labeled experiments with adenosine and d-ribose, it has been possible to demonstrate that adenosine is directly involved in the biosynthesis of 9-β-d-arabinofuranosyladenine by Streptomyces antibioticus. This conclusion is based on the following observations. (a) The ratio of 15N:14C in [6-amino-15N, U-14C]arabinofuranosyladenine and in the adenosine isolated from the RNA are the same as the ratio of 15N:14C in [6-amino-15N, U-14C]adenosine added to cultures of S. antibioticus. (b) All of the tritium on C-2' of [2'-3H]adenosine is lost in the epimerization. (c) Arabinofuranosyladenine derived from d-[3-3H]ribose contained only one-third of the tritium label on C-3'. (d) The conversion of adenosine to 9-β-d-arabinofuranosyladenine does not proceed via 2'-deoxyadenosine. (e) [U-14C]Arabinofuranosyladenine is rapidly taken up by S. antibioticus, but it is hydrolyzed to adenine. This latter observation was determined by the isolation of 14C-labeled AMP from the cellular RNA. These data suggest that adenosine is converted to a 2'-ketonucleoside or 2'-ketonucleotide. Enolization of this 2'-keto compound might explain the loss of tritium on the 3' carbon of arabinofuranosyladenine. The metabolism of 9-β-d-arabinofuranosyladenine and 2'-deoxyadenosine differs markedly from that of adenosine in that the first two nucleosides are hydrolyzed to adenine while adenosine is not hydrolyzed. If the conversion of adenosine to arabinofuranosyladenine proceeds via an epimerase, this reaction would differ from the UDP-d-glucose 4'-epimerase and l-ribulose-phosphate 4'-epimerase in which the hydrogen on C-4' of UDP-glucose or d-xylulose 5-phosphate is found intact in the same position following epimerization. The biosynthesis of arabinofuranosyladenine could be similar to the UDP-acetyl-d-glucosamine 2'-epimerase, cellobiose-2'-epimerase, d-ribulose-phosphate 3'-epimerase, or dTDP-l-rhamnose synthetase in which hydrogen from water is incorporated into the product."

Evidence was found for two sites for phloridzin uptake; one is a relatively nonspecific site with a high Km. The other, a low Km site, shows marked specificity for transport of glucose and related sugars. The marked effect of anaerobiosis and metabolic inhibitors is taken as evidence that phloridzin at this site is actively transported into the cell.
