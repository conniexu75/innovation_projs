https://openalex.org/W2078733257,"Silicate perovskite of composition (Mg(0.88)Fe(0.12)) SiO(3) has been synthesized in a laser-heated diamond-anvil cell to a pressure of 127 gigapascals at temperatures exceeding 2000 K. The perovskite phase was identified and its unit-cell dimensions measured by in situ x-ray diffraction at elevated pressure and room temperature. An analysis of these data yields the first high-precision equation of state for this mineral, with values of the zero-pressure isothermal bulk modulus and its pressure derivative being K(0T) = 266 +/- 6 gigapascals and K'(0T) = 3.9 +/- 0.4. In addition, the orthorhombic distortion of the silicate-perovskite structure away from ideal cubic symmetry remains constant with pressure: the lattice parameter ratios are b/a = 1.032 +/- 0.002 and c/a = 1.444 +/- 0.006. These results, which prove that silicate perovskite is stable to ultrahigh pressures, demonstrate that perovskite can exist throughout the pressure range of the lower mantle and that it is therefore likely to be the most abundant mineral in Earth."

Oxygen is partially, but continuously, depleted within and around marine snow in the dark and can be completely depleted within large fecal pellets. Boundary layers hundreds of micrometers thick are maintained despite advection of fluid past the particles. The existence of chemical microhabitats on the scale of millimeters around macroscopic particles in the pelagic zone may significantly influence the distribution and activity of marine microorganisms and permit processes requiring low oxygen, including denitrification."
https://openalex.org/W1965120984,"The fungal pathogen Verticillium dabliae was less likely to cause symptoms of verticillium wilt on cotton seedlings that had been previously exposed to spider mites than on unexposed cotton seedlings. Conversely, populations of the spider mite Tetranychus urticae grew less rapidly on seedlings that had been inoculated with V. dabliae than on uninoculated controls. Changes caused by pathogen or herbivore attack reduced the suitability of the host plant to a diversity of organisms. This result suggests that highly unrelated organisms that share a host plant may interact strongly."

These low-temperature materials, whose strengths approach those of many traditional high-temperature ceramics, are termed chemically bonded ceramics. The different routes to generating strong cementitious materials, including warm pressing, chemical modification, high-shear mixing with polymer additions, and the making of fiber and particulate composites, are reviewed. Strength, toughness, durability, impermeability, and abrasion resistance of these new materials have been greatly improved, as have certain electrical and acoustical properties."

(i) The aggregate impacts of foreign workers on the earnings and employment of native workers are quite small, but differ for selected population subgroups and high ethnic density labor markets. (ii) Immigrants who arrived during the 1970s are less skilled than earlier arrivals, and their earnings will remain substantially below those of natives throughout their working lives. (iii) The evidence on immigrants' receipt of public assistance income is inconclusive."

Mass mortality of the most abundant grazer in Caribbean cryptic reef environments, the sea urchin Diadema antilarum, selectively decreased rates of mortality of encrusting organisms by half, yet community composition hardly changed because alternative species failed to become established."

Proximal parts of these wedges consist of paralic deposits formed either as large-scale high-constructive d e I t a systems (with related strike systems) or as a series of smaller high-destructive delta systems. Distal parts acc u mu I a ted as continental slope deposits associated with salt diapir fields at the terminus of prograded paralic systems."

https://openalex.org/W2018893368,"''The United States and the rest of the world are being set up for a major oil price shock,'' says Interior Secretary Hodel. Waning US oil output, rising imports, and Middle East tensions are reheating energy policy debates of the 1970s. Gasoline is still cheap and there are no shortages at the pump, but increasingly, government officials and private energy analysts are sounding warnings about the nation's energy future. For the first time since 1980, US reliance on oil imports has gone up and will rise further by the early 1990s. This expanding dependence is reigniting the energy policy debates of the 1970s. At issue is not only national security, but economic concerns about inflation, slower growth, and a stifling of efforts to slash the nation's staggering $171-billion trade deficit. The drive to arouse the nation's energy conscience is led by battered domestic oil producers, oil exploration companies, and related service sectors. Wild swings in the price of oil during 1986 have knocked high-cost American production out of the market. Industry executives estimate that 360,000 oil field and related service industry workers lost their jobs in the last year. In response, some domestic producers are seeking tariffs and tax breaksmore » to keep the industry from collapsing further. Thus far, the Reagan Administration has rejected pleas to impose import fees, noting that consumers have benefited from lower prices. With oil imports projected to supply 50% of US needs by the early 1990s, pressure is building in and outside Congress for an overhaul of Administration energy policy.« less"
