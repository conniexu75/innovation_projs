https://openalex.org/W2792817844,"Following a previous microbial inoculation, plants can induce broad-spectrum immunity to pathogen infection, a phenomenon known as systemic acquired resistance (SAR). SAR establishment in Arabidopsis thaliana is regulated by the Lys catabolite pipecolic acid (Pip) and flavin-dependent-monooxygenase1 (FMO1). Here, we show that elevated Pip is sufficient to induce an FMO1-dependent transcriptional reprogramming of leaves that is reminiscent of SAR. In planta and in vitro analyses demonstrate that FMO1 functions as a pipecolate N-hydroxylase, catalyzing the biochemical conversion of Pip to N-hydroxypipecolic acid (NHP). NHP systemically accumulates in plants after microbial attack. When exogenously applied, it overrides the defect of NHP-deficient fmo1 in acquired resistance and acts as a potent inducer of plant immunity to bacterial and oomycete infection. Our work has identified a pathogen-inducible L-Lys catabolic pathway in plants that generates the N-hydroxylated amino acid NHP as a critical regulator of systemic acquired resistance to pathogen infection."
https://openalex.org/W2793078357,"miRISC is a multi-protein assembly that uses microRNAs (miRNAs) to identify mRNAs targeted for repression. Dozens of miRISC-associated proteins have been identified, and interactions between many factors have been examined in detail. However, the physical nature of the complex remains unknown. Here, we show that two core protein components of human miRISC, Argonaute2 (Ago2) and TNRC6B, condense into phase-separated droplets in vitro and in live cells. Phase separation is promoted by multivalent interactions between the glycine/tryptophan (GW)-rich domain of TNRC6B and three evenly spaced tryptophan-binding pockets in the Ago2 PIWI domain. miRISC droplets formed in vitro recruit deadenylation factors and sequester target RNAs from the bulk solution. The condensation of miRISC is accompanied by accelerated deadenylation of target RNAs bound to Ago2. The combined results may explain how miRISC silences mRNAs of varying size and structure and provide experimental evidence that protein-mediated phase separation can facilitate an RNA processing reaction."
https://openalex.org/W2792625647,"Hereditary xerocytosis is thought to be a rare genetic condition characterized by red blood cell (RBC) dehydration with mild hemolysis. RBC dehydration is linked to reduced Plasmodium infection in vitro; however, the role of RBC dehydration in protection against malaria in vivo is unknown. Most cases of hereditary xerocytosis are associated with gain-of-function mutations in PIEZO1, a mechanically activated ion channel. We engineered a mouse model of hereditary xerocytosis and show that Plasmodium infection fails to cause experimental cerebral malaria in these mice due to the action of Piezo1 in RBCs and in T cells. Remarkably, we identified a novel human gain-of-function PIEZO1 allele, E756del, present in a third of the African population. RBCs from individuals carrying this allele are dehydrated and display reduced Plasmodium infection in vitro. The existence of a gain-of-function PIEZO1 at such high frequencies is surprising and suggests an association with malaria resistance."
https://openalex.org/W2789627388,"Genomics has provided a detailed structural description of the cancer genome. Identifying oncogenic drivers that work primarily through dosage changes is a current challenge. Unrestrained proliferation is a critical hallmark of cancer. We constructed modular, barcoded libraries of human open reading frames (ORFs) and performed screens for proliferation regulators in multiple cell types. Approximately 10% of genes regulate proliferation, with most performing in an unexpectedly highly tissue-specific manner. Proliferation drivers in a given cell type showed specific enrichment in somatic copy number changes (SCNAs) from cognate tumors and helped predict aneuploidy patterns in those tumors, implying that tissue-type-specific genetic network architectures underlie SCNA and driver selection in different cancers. In vivo screening confirmed these results. We report a substantial contribution to the catalog of SCNA-associated cancer drivers, identifying 147 amplified and 107 deleted genes as potential drivers, and derive insights about the genetic network architecture of aneuploidy in tumors."
https://openalex.org/W2792195687,"Inflammasome activation is critical for host defenses against various microbial infections. Activation of the NLRC4 inflammasome requires detection of flagellin or type III secretion system (T3SS) components by NLR family apoptosis inhibitory proteins (NAIPs); yet how this pathway is regulated is unknown. Here, we found that interferon regulatory factor 8 (IRF8) is required for optimal activation of the NLRC4 inflammasome in bone-marrow-derived macrophages infected with Salmonella Typhimurium, Burkholderia thailandensis, or Pseudomonas aeruginosa but is dispensable for activation of the canonical and non-canonical NLRP3, AIM2, and Pyrin inflammasomes. IRF8 governs the transcription of Naips to allow detection of flagellin or T3SS proteins to mediate NLRC4 inflammasome activation. Furthermore, we found that IRF8 confers protection against bacterial infection in vivo, owing to its role in inflammasome-dependent cytokine production and pyroptosis. Altogether, our findings suggest that IRF8 is a critical regulator of NAIPs and NLRC4 inflammasome activation for defense against bacterial infection."
https://openalex.org/W2793110992,"Cellular interactions between delta and mu opioid receptors (DORs and MORs), including heteromerization, are thought to regulate opioid analgesia. However, the identity of the nociceptive neurons in which such interactions could occur in vivo remains elusive. Here we show that DOR-MOR co-expression is limited to small populations of excitatory interneurons and projection neurons in the spinal cord dorsal horn and unexpectedly predominates in ventral horn motor circuits. Similarly, DOR-MOR co-expression is rare in parabrachial, amygdalar, and cortical brain regions processing nociceptive information. We further demonstrate that in the discrete DOR-MOR co-expressing nociceptive neurons, the two receptors internalize and function independently. Finally, conditional knockout experiments revealed that DORs selectively regulate mechanical pain by controlling the excitability of somatostatin-positive dorsal horn interneurons. Collectively, our results illuminate the functional organization of DORs and MORs in CNS pain circuits and reappraise the importance of DOR-MOR cellular interactions for developing novel opioid analgesics."
https://openalex.org/W2752739326,"Understanding reliable signal transmission represents a notable challenge for cortical systems, which display a wide range of weights of feedforward and feedback connections among heterogeneous areas. We re-examine the question of signal transmission across the cortex in a network model based on mesoscopic directed and weighted inter-areal connectivity data of the macaque cortex. Our findings reveal that, in contrast to purely feedforward propagation models, the presence of long-range excitatory feedback projections could compromise stable signal propagation. Using population rate models as well as a spiking network model, we find that effective signal propagation can be accomplished by balanced amplification across cortical areas while ensuring dynamical stability. Moreover, the activation of prefrontal cortex in our model requires the input strength to exceed a threshold, which is consistent with the ignition model of conscious processing. These findings demonstrate our model as an anatomically realistic platform for investigations of global primate cortex dynamics."

During this transition, the embryo must establish a paracellular permeability barrier to enable expansion of the blastocyst cavity. Here, using live imaging of mouse embryos, we reveal an actin-zippering mechanism driving this embryo sealing. Preceding blastocyst stage, a cortical F-actin ring assembles at the apical pole of the embryo’s outer cells. The ring structure forms when cortical actin flows encounter a network of polar microtubules that exclude F-actin. Unlike stereotypical actin rings, the actin rings of the mouse embryo are not contractile, but instead, they expand to the cell-cell junctions. Here, they couple to the junctions by recruiting and stabilizing adherens and tight junction components. Coupling of the actin rings triggers localized myosin II accumulation, and it initiates a tension-dependent zippering mechanism along the junctions that is required to seal the embryo for blastocyst formation.

Coupling of the actin rings triggers localized myosin II accumulation, and it initiates a tension-dependent zippering mechanism along the junctions that is required to seal the embryo for blastocyst formation. During the preimplantation stage of mammalian development, the cells of the embryo assemble adherens and tight junctions to establish the first forms of tissue architecture (White et al., 2017White M.D. Zenker J.

E-cadherin (E-cad) trans-ligation at adherens junctions enables a mechanical coupling of the cell cortices of neighboring cells and promotes cell-cell adhesion (Samarage et al., 2015Samarage C.R.

Tight junctions create a permeability barrier that seals the embryo from the exterior (Eckert and Fleming, 2008Eckert J.J. Fleming T.P. Tight junction biogenesis during early development.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2008; 1778: 717-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The establishment of this barrier allows for an increase in osmotically driven hydrostatic pressure in the space between cells, thereby expanding the first internal cavity of the embryo and transforming the morula into a blastocyst. Although initial studies suggested that the mouse embryo becomes sealed after the 32-cell stage when the embryo transforms into a blastocyst (McLaren and Smith, 1977McLaren A. Smith R. Functional test of tight junctions in the mouse blastocyst.Nature. 1977; 267: 351-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), subsequent work indicated that the sealing process is initiated earlier. The latter model is supported by (1) the enrichment of adherens and tight junction components in outer cells of the embryo during the 16- to 32-cell-stage transition, (2) defects in blastocyst formation due to perturbation of adherens and tight junctions, and (3) functional assays using freely diffusing dextrans that demonstrate the establishment of an epithelial barrier prior to the 32-cell stage (Ducibella et al., 1975Ducibella T.

Despite progress in the identification of molecular components required for blastocyst formation, the morphogenetic mechanism that triggers embryo sealing remains unknown. In most tissues and organs, morphogenesis is driven via the coordinated coupling of adherens and tight junctions to cellular actin networks (Heisenberg and Bellaïche, 2013Heisenberg C.P. Bellaïche Y. Forces in tissue morphogenesis and patterning.Cell. 2013; 153: 948-962Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (702) Google Scholar, Lecuit et al., 2011Lecuit T. Lenne P.F. Munro E. Force generation, transmission, and integration during cell and tissue morphogenesis.Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2011; 27: 157-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). However, it is unclear how actin networks in the early mammalian embryo might contribute to sealing or blastocyst formation. Here we imaged filamentous actin (F-actin) in living mouse embryos to uncover mechanisms required for embryo sealing. We show that F-actin rings appear at the apical cortex of the outer cells of the embryo, then expand to cell-cell junctions where they undergo zippering, triggering sealing of the embryo and enabling blastocyst formation. To visualize F-actin non-invasively, we imaged intact live mouse embryos expressing GFP fused to Utrophin (GFP-Utr) (Burkel et al., 2007Burkel B.M. von Dassow G. Bement W.M. Versatile fluorescent probes for actin filaments based on the actin-binding domain of utrophin.Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 2007; 64: 822-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar) during the 16- to 32-cell stage. GFP-Utr strongly labeled an actin ring-like structure at the apical cortex of the outer cells (Figures 1A and 1B ). This ring encloses a region typically described as the apical domain (Johnson and Maro, 1984Johnson M.H. Maro B. The distribution of cytoplasmic actin in mouse 8-cell blastomeres.J. Embryol. Exp. Morphol. 1984; 82: 97-117PubMed Google Scholar). The ring was also labeled in live embryos by the membrane-to-cortex attachment protein Ezrin fused to mRuby (Ezrin-mRuby), the actin bundler Fascin fused to Emerald (Emerald-Fascin), and the scaffolding protein Pard6b fused to GFP (GFP-Pard6b) and in fixed embryos stained with Phalloidin-Rhodamine or for endogenous phosphorylated Ezrin (pEzrin) (Figures 1A, 1B, and S1A–S1E).Figure S1Actin Rings Are Labeled by Ezrin, Pard6b, and Fascin and They Remain Zippered during Division, Related to Figure 1Show full caption(A) Examples of non-injected 16- to 32-cell stage embryos stained with Phalloidin-Rhodamine and DAPI.

Scale bars, 10 μm. Actin rings typically drive diverse morphogenetic processes by constriction (Schwayer et al., 2016Schwayer C. Sikora M. Slováková J. Kardos R. Heisenberg C.P. Actin Rings of Power.Dev. Cell. 2016; 37: 493-506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). However, instead of constricting, the rings of the mouse embryo expanded over the entire apical cortex to the cell-cell junctions during the 16- to 32-cell stage (Figures 1A, 1B, and S1A–S1E; Movie S1). Moreover, following their expansion, the rings of neighboring cells formed an initial point of contact at the shared junction. Once established, this contact extended bidirectionally along the junctions in a zippering-like process, which formed a unified linear structure connecting the adjoining cells (Figures 1B and 1C; Movie S1). Zippering of actin rings occurred simultaneously at multiple junctions during the 16- to 32-cell stage (Figures 1C and S1A). Furthermore, when cells divided after the 32-cell stage, the daughter cells did not form a new actin ring. Instead, they retained their zippered architecture during division and blastocyst expansion (Figures S1F and S1G). As the expansion of the rings and their zippering occurred just prior to the blastocyst stage, it may serve as a mechanism to seal the embryo for blastocyst formation. Therefore, we investigated which processes drive actin ring formation, expansion, and zippering. Although actin rings only zipper after the 16-cell stage, similar structures enclose the apical domain in 8-cell embryos (Johnson and Maro, 1984Johnson M.H. Maro B. The distribution of cytoplasmic actin in mouse 8-cell blastomeres.J. Embryol. Exp. Morphol. 1984; 82: 97-117PubMed Google Scholar) (Figure 2A). It is asserted that these regions are asymmetrically segregated during the division of 8-cell-stage blastomeres to determine daughter cell fate (Chazaud et al., 2006Chazaud C. Yamanaka Y. Pawson T.

However, imaging divisions in intact 8-cell embryos showed that the majority of rings labeled by apical domain markers RFP-Utr, Ezrin-GFP, GFP-Pard6b, atypical protein kinase C isoform PKCζ (aPKC-Emerald), or the apical surface marker Lck-GFP disassembled prior to cytokinesis (87.1%, n = 31 cell divisions) (Figures 2A, 2B, and S2A–S2D; Movie S2), and most cells assembled an actin ring de novo after cytokinesis (Figures 2C and S2D). These results were confirmed in uninjected embryos stained for Phalloidin-Rhodamine and pEzrin (Figure S2E). Moreover, the few cells that did not establish an actin ring de novo resulted from divisions in which the ring was either asymmetrically inherited or disassembled before cytokinesis (Figure S2F). We do not exclude the possibility that some unknown components of the apical domain may be asymmetrically retained during division. However, we propose that the localization of apical polarity markers is most frequently reestablished rather than directly inherited following division, consistent with previous observations (Anani et al., 2014Anani S. Bhat S. Honma-Yamanaka N. Krawchuk D. Yamanaka Y.

As the actin ring forms following cytokinesis, we imaged cells at a high temporal resolution in embryos expressing GFP-Utr and fluorescently tagged microtubule-associated protein 2c (RFP-MAP2c) (Figure 2C). These experiments revealed a flow of cortical F-actin commencing at the end of cytokinesis (Figure 2C; Movie S3). Particle image velocimetry (PIV) analysis (Mayer et al., 2010Mayer M. Depken M. Bois J.S. Jülicher F. Grill S.W. Anisotropies in cortical tension reveal the physical basis of polarizing cortical flows.Nature. 2010; 467: 617-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar) demonstrated that the flow initiates at the region where the cytokinetic furrow disassembles and a nascent cell-cell junction is formed, and is directed toward the cell poles (Figure 2D). Using a multiphoton laser to label photoactivatable GFP fused to actin (paGFP-actin) at the cell cortex of the nascent junction also demonstrated a directional flow toward the cell pole (Figures S2G and S2H). The flow did not replenish GFP-Utr uniformly across the cell cortex. Instead, it was interrupted at the edge of a spherical cap largely devoid of GFP-Utr, indicating an exclusion zone for stable cortical F-actin. The flow caused a progressive accumulation of GFP-Utr at the edge of this exclusion zone, resulting in the formation of a ring-like structure rich in F-actin (Figures 2C, S2G, and S2H). Disruption of cortical flows by external crosslinking via wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) treatment (Canman and Bement, 1997Canman J.C. Bement W.M.

Polar actomyosin contractility destabilizes the position of the cytokinetic furrow.Nature. 2011; 476: 462-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar) prevented actin ring formation (Figure S2I). In contrast to GFP-Utr and Phalloidin-Rhodamine, actin fused to GFP (GFP-actin) was found at similar levels at the cell cortex inside and outside the ring (Figures 2E and S2J), suggesting that these regions experience different F-actin turnover rates. Therefore, we measured paGFP-actin dynamics at the cortex inside, outside, and at the ring using fluorescence decay after photoactivation (FDAP) (Plachta et al., 2011Plachta N. Bollenbach T. Pease S. Fraser S.E. Pantazis P. Oct4 kinetics predict cell lineage patterning in the early mammalian embryo.Nat. Cell Biol. 2011; 13: 117-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). paGFP-actin displayed the fastest decay rate and the lowest immobile fraction inside the ring, confirming that there was more rapid actin turnover and fewer stable actin filaments in this region of the apical cortex (Figures 2F–2H). Furthermore, photoactivation of a selective pool of paGFP-actin at the ring showed that this paGFP-actin was retained at the ring for at least 1 hr, reflecting a stable incorporation of paGFP-actin into actin filaments at the ring (Figure S2K). These observations suggest differences in G- to F-actin ratios inside and outside the actin ring, with the pool inside the ring turning over more rapidly. As the cortex inside the ring is largely devoid of stable F-actin, it comprises a weak area of the apical surface (Charras and Paluch, 2008Charras G. Paluch E. Blebs lead the way: how to migrate without lamellipodia.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2008; 9: 730-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar). In line with this, this region formed a prominent membranous bulge similar to a cellular bleb, known to buffer intracellular pressure (Sedzinski et al., 2011Sedzinski J. Biro M. Oswald A. Tinevez J.Y. Salbreux G. Paluch E. Polar actomyosin contractility destabilizes the position of the cytokinetic furrow.Nature. 2011; 476: 462-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar) (Figure 2I). Cellular blebs typically assemble a cortical actomyosin network to arrest their expansion and retract (Biro et al., 2013Biro M. Romeo Y. Kroschwald S. Bovellan M. Boden A. Tcherkezian J. Roux P.P. Charras G. Paluch E.K. Cell cortex composition and homeostasis resolved by integrating proteomics and quantitative imaging.Cytoskeleton (Hoboken). 2013; 70: 741-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). By contrast, the apical bulge inside the actin ring remains clear of F-actin throughout ring expansion. These results suggest the existence of a mechanism inhibiting cortical F-actin assembly within the ring. As the actin rings form at the end of cytokinesis, we investigated a role for microtubules, which differentially regulate the cortex during cell division. In other systems, microtubules originate from centrosomes (Conduit et al., 2015Conduit P.T. Wainman A. Raff J.W. Centrosome function and assembly in animal cells.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2015; 16: 611-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). During cell division, midzone microtubules recruit actomyosin to the cytokinetic furrow, while astral microtubules typically inhibit cortical F-actin at the cell poles in a process known as polar relaxation (Fededa and Gerlich, 2012Fededa J.P. Gerlich D.W. Molecular control of animal cell cytokinesis.Nat. Cell Biol. 2012; 14: 440-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, White and Borisy, 1983White J.G. Borisy G.G.

Rev. Cytol. 1960; 10: 163-216Google Scholar). However, the early mouse embryo lacks centrosomes and microtubule dynamics remain unclear (Clift and Schuh, 2015Clift D. Schuh M.

Therefore, we characterized microtubule dynamics in live embryos expressing RFP/GFP-MAP2c. In line with the lack of centrosomes, the mitotic spindle assembles around the chromosomes (Coelho et al., 2013Coelho P.A. Bury L. Sharif B. Riparbelli M.G. Fu J. Callaini G. Glover D.M. Zernicka-Goetz M. Spindle formation in the mouse embryo requires Plk4 in the absence of centrioles.Dev. Cell. 2013; 27: 586-597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) without a distinct astral microtubule network. However, at the end of telophase, a polar microtubule network rapidly expanded between the newly formed cell nucleus and the apical cortex (Figures 3A and 3B ; Movie S4). The localization of this network was inversely correlated with that of GFP-Utr, resulting in an apical zone rich in microtubules and poor in F-actin (Figures 3C–3F). Labeling microtubules with the plus-end marker EB3-dTomato, or a 2G4 construct associated with dynamic and tyrosinated microtubules (Cassimeris et al., 2013Cassimeris L. Guglielmi L. Denis V. Larroque C. Martineau P. Specific in vivo labeling of tyrosinated α-tubulin and measurement of microtubule dynamics using a GFP tagged, cytoplasmically expressed recombinant antibody.PLoS ONE. 2013; 8: e59812Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), revealed that the microtubule network underlying the cortex was denser and more dynamic inside than outside the ring (Figures 3G and S3A). Moreover, tracking microtubule plus ends demonstrated greater microtubule growth inside the ring (Figures 3H, 3I, and S3B; Movie S5). This microtubule network progressively expanded to the junctions concurrent with the expansion of the actin ring (Figures 3E and 3F). Local disruption of microtubule polymerization inside the ring, using the photoswitchable microtubule inhibitors photostatins (PSTs) (Borowiak et al., 2015Borowiak M. Nahaboo W. Reynders M.

Moreover, deactivation of the previously photoactivated PSTs allowed microtubule growth to resume, resulting in renewed clearance of F-actin inside the ring (Figures 3J, 3K, and S3C–S3E). By contrast, activation of PSTs outside the ring had no effect on cortical RFP-Utr levels (Figure S3F). Furthermore, global depolymerization of microtubules using nocodazole disrupted the exclusion of GFP-Utr inside the ring, the"

Hibernation in mammals is a seasonal state of metabolic suppression and dormancy characterized by a decrease in body temperature (Andrews, 2007Andrews M.T.

Small hibernators such as 13-lined ground squirrels (GS; Ictidomys tridecemlineatus) use this remarkable strategy to survive extreme environmental stresses (Drew et al., 2007Drew K.L. Buck C.L.

Chem. 2010; 52: 77-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). They routinely withstand a body temperature below 10°C that would otherwise cause severe injuries and organ failure in non-hibernating mammals (Quinones et al., 2014Quinones Q.J. Ma Q. Zhang Z. Barnes B.M. Podgoreanu M.V. Organ protective mechanisms common to extremes of physiology: a window through hibernation biology.Integr. Comp. Biol. 2014; 54: 497-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). For example, GS platelets display resistance to cold-storage-induced damage (Cooper et al., 2012Cooper S.T. Richters K.E. Melin T.E. Liu Z.J. Hordyk P.J. Benrud R.R. Geiser L.R. Cash S.E. Simon Shelley C.

Physiol. 2012; 302: R1202-R1208Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), and GS kidney tubular cells exhibit significantly less cell death when subjected to cold storage/rewarming compared to mice (Jain et al., 2016Jain S. Keys D. Martin S. Edelstein C.L. Jani A.

If the mechanisms underlying such cold tolerance could be reproduced in non-hibernators, it would hold great promise for clinical applications. Indeed, even with a mild temperature drop (2°C–3°C below normal body temperature), induced hypothermia has been shown to promote patient survival in critical-care situations (Delhaye et al., 2012Delhaye C.

At this temperature range, cold-shock proteins (e.g., RBM3 and CIRP) are induced, which demonstrate promising neuroprotective effects (Bastide et al., 2017Bastide A. Peretti D. Knight J.R. Grosso S.

However, hibernating GSs, whose body temperature drops from normal (∼37°C) to near freezing for days at a time, confront a much more strenuous challenge and yet avoid neurological damage (Arendt et al., 2003Arendt T.

The mechanisms involved in cold adaptation at such hibernation-like temperatures remain unclear. One critical vulnerability is that the microtubule cytoskeleton quickly depolymerizes at near-freezing temperatures (Breton and Brown, 1998Breton S. Brown D.

Nephrol. 1998; 9: 155-166Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, Wallin and Strömberg, 1995Wallin M. Strömberg E. Cold-stable and cold-adapted microtubules.Int. Rev.

Microtubules have various cellular functions and are vital to many organs and the nervous system, as neurons require a stable microtubule cytoskeleton to maintain their elaborate dendritic and axonal processes as well as proper synaptic connections (Conde and Cáceres, 2009Conde C.

Hence, failure to protect the microtubules would result in catastrophic functional impairment. Although microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs) can facilitate short-term (∼1 h) microtubule stability in neurons at ∼4°C (Bosc et al., 2003Bosc C. Andrieux A. Job D. STOP proteins.Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 12125-12132Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, Guillaud et al., 1998Guillaud L. Bosc C. Fourest-Lieuvin A. Denarier E. Pirollet F. Lafanechère L. Job D.

Cold-stable microtubules from brain.Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 1993-2001Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), how GSs maintain their microtubules in days-long hibernation bouts remains a mystery. Understanding the mechanisms of such remarkable cold adaptations during hibernation will be vital for harnessing the benefit of metabolic regulation and avoiding the harmful effects of such low temperatures (Dave et al., 2012Dave K.R.

Seasonally hibernating phenotype assessed through transcript screening.Physiol. Genomics. 2005; 24: 13-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). However, hibernating species such as GSs are non-conventional animal models with annual reproductive cycles that hinder access to early developmental tissues. Consequently, hibernation research at molecular and cellular levels has been impeded by both a lack of transgenic models for in vivo genetic manipulations and a limited choice of cell types (Drew et al., 2011Drew K.L. McGee R.C. Wells M.S. Kelleher-Andersson J.A. Growth and differentiation of adult hippocampal arctic ground squirrel neural stem cells.J. Vis. Exp. 2011; : 2199PubMed Google Scholar) for in vitro studies. To this end, induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) (Takahashi and Yamanaka, 2006Takahashi K. Yamanaka S. Induction of pluripotent stem cells from mouse embryonic and adult fibroblast cultures by defined factors.Cell. 2006; 126: 663-676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18970) Google Scholar) are a valuable alternative that can establish various cell types and tissue models for in-depth mechanistic studies in vitro. Here, we report for the first time the establishment of iPSCs from a hibernating mammal (GS) to study their hibernation-specific features, inspiring novel pharmacological strategies to bestow cold adaptability to cells and organs from non-hibernating mammals. We found that neurons differentiated from GS iPSCs retain intrinsic cold-resistant features such as microtubule stability. This enabled us to identify cellular pathways linking mitochondria-initiated oxidative stress and dysfunctional lysosomes with microtubule instability in the cold. Using drugs targeting these pathways, we demonstrate that human iPSC-derived neurons (iPSC-neurons) and rat retinal neurons can acquire cold-resistant features. Remarkably, these treatments functionally rescued cold-exposed rat retinal tissues whose structure and function would otherwise have been compromised. Furthermore, the same treatments prevented cold-induced microtubule and other damage in mouse kidneys undergoing conventional transplantation storage. Prospectively, GS iPSCs can serve as a valuable platform for exploring the unique mechanisms of metabolic adaptation and stress responses in hibernators and for facilitating the translation of hibernation research to medical applications. We first compared neuronal microtubule morphology from GSs and rats (a non-hibernator) at 4°C using antibodies against the neuron-specific β-tubulin isotype-III (TUBB3) and two α-tubulin isotypes that are enriched in neurons (Δ2-T, poly-E-T). At physiological temperatures (37°C), rat neurons contained long, smooth microtubule processes; however, a 4-hr incubation at 4°C induced microtubule fragmentation. Moreover, following an extended 16-hr incubation at 4°C, most rat neuron microtubules disappeared, leaving abnormal tubulin aggregates (Figure 1A). Human iPSC-neurons exhibited similar cold-induced microtubule instability (Figure 1B). In stark contrast, cortical neurons cultured from neonatal GSs showed no signs of deterioration even after 16 hr of cold exposure (Figure 1C). To overcome the limited accessibility of primary cultures of GS neurons and to facilitate mechanistic studies of microtubule cold resistance in vitro, we established GS iPSC lines from neonatal GS cortex using a modified reprogramming protocol and validated their pluripotency (Figures S1A–S1C). As with GS cortical primary neurons, microtubules of GS iPSC-neurons showed little difference between 37°C and 4°C incubations for 16 hr (Figures 1D and 1E), suggesting that GS iPSC-neurons retain endogenous cold resistance. To elucidate how GS neurons preserve their microtubule integrity in the cold, we first examined tubulin protein expression. In agreement with microtubule morphology, protein levels of TUBB3, poly-E-T, and Δ2-T remained unchanged in GS iPSC-neurons following 16-hr incubation at 4°C (Figure 2A). In contrast, in human iPSC-neurons following 4 hr at 4°C, tubulin protein levels were significantly reduced (Figure 2A). These observed changes in microtubule homeostasis were not a secondary phenomenon attributable to cell death (Figure S2A).Figure S2Effects of TUBB3 Overexpression and Taxol on Protecting Neuronal Microtubules of Human iPSC-Neurons against Cold Stress, Related to Figure 2Show full caption(A) Cold-induced microtubule disruption is not a secondary effect of cell death (n = 5 experiments each from 2 GS and 3 human cell lines).

(C) Western blots and quantification of total TUBB3, poly-E-T and Δ2-T proteins in human iPSC-neurons following 4- or 16-hr cold exposure (n = 5 experiments from 2 cell lines; Student’s t test for two-group comparisons; ∗p < 0.05; ∗∗p < 0.01; ∗∗∗p < 0.001). Error bars indicate SEM. (D) Immunofluorescence of TUBB3 (red), poly-E-T (green), or Δ2-T (blue) in human iPSC-neurons incubated at 4°C for 4 or 16 hr (n = 5 experiments from 2 cell lines). Note: Overexpression of TUBB3 improved microtubule morphology only in the 4-hr cold-exposed group; Taxol is a known drug that binds and stabilizes microtubules. Low dose Taxol (0.1 μM) did not protect human iPSC-neuronal microtubules following 16-hr cold exposure. Scale bar: 40 μm. To test whether such microtubule destabilization resulted from a diminished pool of tubulin proteins, we overexpressed TUBB3 in human iPSC-neurons. TUBB3 overexpression temporarily preserved expression of all three proteins (TUBB3, poly-E-T, and Δ2-T) and long neurites for 4-hr cold exposure (Figures 2A and S2D), likely by recruiting poly-E-T and Δ2-T to form more stable polymers. However, this rescue effect did not extend to the 16-hr group (Figure S2D), perhaps due to cessation of TUBB3 production at 4°C and other cellular responses contributing to tubulin degradation. We then used comparative RNA profiling in human and GS iPSC-neurons to systematically examine possible mechanisms of cold-induced tubulin degradation (Figure S3; Data S1, S2, and S3). Clustering analysis of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and pathway analysis indicated that mitochondrial functions are among the most significantly changed pathways upon cold exposure (yellow cluster in Figure S3E and Data S2, and Figure S3F). Among these most significantly changed pathways, two function-related gene clusters showed distinctly changing patterns in GS and human iPSC-neurons during cold exposure: (1) mitochondria-related genes and (2) genes participating in protein quality control (PQC), including heat-shock proteins (HSPs), proteases, and proteinase inhibitor genes (Figures 2B and S3F). These differentially affected pathways prompted us to investigate whether the mitochondrial and PQC responses to cold exposure contribute to microtubule destruction in human iPSC-neurons. To examine whether mitochondria in human and GS iPSC-neurons respond differently to cold exposure, we monitored mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψm) changes. In human iPSC-neurons following a temperature decrease from 37°C to 10°C, we observed a hyperpolarizing Δψm (Figure 3A; Movie S1). In contrast, when GS iPSC-neurons were treated with the same experimental protocol, we instead observed a depolarizing Δψm (Figure 3A). Although this change is seemingly minute, it leads to a significant increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) production (see Discussion). Indeed, following 30-min cold exposure, we observed significantly higher cold-induced ROS production in human than in GS iPSC-neurons (Figure 3B), indicating that the immediate mitochondrial response results in prolonged oxidative stress. Importantly, when the human iPSC-neuron mitochondrial hyperpolarization was reversed by the addition of a low dose of mitochondrial uncoupler, BAM15 (0.1 μM, Figure 3A), we observed a significant decrease in ROS production, to a level comparable to GS iPSC-neurons in the cold (Figure 3B). Because ROS may oxidize and disrupt microtubules (Wilson and González-Billault, 2015Wilson C. González-Billault C. Regulation of cytoskeletal dynamics by redox signaling and oxidative stress: implications for neuronal development and trafficking.Front. Cell. Neurosci. 2015; 9: 381Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that the GS iPSC-neurons possess superior microtubule stability due to suppressed ROS generation as a consequence of muted hyperpolarizing Δψm in response to cold. To verify this, we directly probed cold-induced protein oxidation. We found that levels of oxidized proteins increased in human iPSC-neurons but remained unchanged in GS iPSC-neurons exposed to cold for 16 hr (Figure 3C). Oxidized proteins are subject to protein-protein cross-linkages and aggregate formation (Gregersen and Bross, 2010Gregersen N. Bross P. Protein misfolding and cellular stress: an overview.Methods Mol. Biol. 2010; 648: 3-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, Grune et al., 1997Grune T. Reinheckel T. Davies K.J. Degradation of oxidized proteins in mammalian cells.FASEB J. 1997; 11: 526-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (725) Google Scholar). Indeed, immunolabeling of oxidized proteins revealed aggregates along residual microtubules after cold exposure in human but not in GS iPSC-neurons (Figures 3D and S4). Interestingly, the addition of BAM15 prevented accumulation of oxidized proteins along microtubules (Figure 3D). Thus, our findings suggest that overproduction of ROS via cold-induced mitochondrial hyperpolarization leads to microtubule damage and subsequent aggregation. Damaged proteins would normally engage the PQC system for their removal (Goldberg, 2003Goldberg A.L.

However, in cold-exposed human iPSC-neurons, we observed a PQC dysregulation (Figures 2B, S5B, and S5C) and, surprisingly, evidence of compromised lysosomal integrity (i.e., lysosomal membrane permeability [LMP]), which acidifies the cytosol and releases digestive enzymes. To assess the latter, we loaded GS and human iPSC-neurons with Magic Red and DND-26, which labeled discrete puncta of lysosomal vesicles. However, in cold-exposed human neurons, more diffuse cytosolic Magic Red and DND-26 signals were observed (Figure 4A, arrowheads)—typical signs of LMP and an acidified cytosolic environment. Thus, proteases leaked from lysosomes are poised to inadvertently digest cytosolic proteins such as adjacent microtubules. Notably, BAM15 and the antioxidant vitamin C significantly reduced LMP (Figure 4B), demonstrating a link between cold-induced mitochondrial dysfunction and LMP.Figure 4Cold-Induced Lysosomal Membrane Permeabilization in Human iPSC-NeuronsShow full caption(A) Left: Live imaging of lysosomes in GS and human iPSC-neurons with DND-26 (green) and Magic Red (magenta; see STAR Methods).

https://openalex.org/W2790581709,"Screens for genes that orchestrate neural circuit formation in mammals have been hindered by practical constraints of germline mutagenesis. To overcome these limitations, we combined RNA-seq with somatic CRISPR mutagenesis to study synapse development in the mouse retina. Here synapses occur between cellular layers, forming two multilayered neuropils. The outer neuropil, the outer plexiform layer (OPL), contains synapses made by rod and cone photoreceptor axons on rod and cone bipolar dendrites, respectively. We used RNA-seq to identify selectively expressed genes encoding cell surface and secreted proteins and CRISPR-Cas9 electroporation with cell-specific promoters to assess their roles in OPL development. Among the genes identified in this way are Wnt5a and Wnt5b. They are produced by rod bipolars and activate a non-canonical signaling pathway in rods to regulate early OPL patterning. The approach we use here can be applied to other parts of the brain."
https://openalex.org/W2791413464,"Background and aim Self-medication (SM) is one part of self-care which is known to contribute to primary health care. If practiced appropriately, it has major benefits for the consumers such as self-reliance and decreased expense. However, inappropriate practice can have potential dangers such as incorrect self-diagnosis, dangerous drug-drug interactions, incorrect manner of administration, incorrect dosage, incorrect choice of therapy, masking of a severe disease, and/or risk of dependence and abuse. The main objective of this study was to assess the prevalence and determinants of the self-medication practice (SMP) in Addis Ababa. Methodology A community based cross-sectional study was conducted among selected households in Addis Ababa from April 2016 to May 2016, with a recall period of two months before its conduction. Trained data collectors were employed to collect the data from the 604 sampled participants using pre-tested and validated questionnaires. Result Among the 604 participants involved in this study, 422 (69.9%) were female and 182 (30.1%) were male and there was a mean age of 41.04 (± 13.45) years. The prevalence of SM in this study was 75.5%. The three most frequently reported ailments were headache 117 (25.7%), abdominal pain 59 (12.9%) and cough 54 (11.8%). The two main reasons for SM were mildness of illness 216 (47.4%) and previous knowledge about the drug 106 (23.2%). The two most frequently consumed medications were paracetamol 92 (20.2%) and traditional remedies 73 (16.0%), while drug retail outlets 319 (83.3%) were the main source of drugs. The two most frequently reported source of drug information were health professionals 174 (45.4%) and experience from previous treatment 82 (21.4%). Moreover, there were statistically significant differences among respondents who reported practicing SM based on income and knowledge about appropriate SMP. Conclusion and recommendation Self-medication was practiced with a range of drugs from the conventional paracetamol and NSAIDs to antimicrobials. Being that the practice of SM is inevitable, health authorities and professionals are highly demanded to educate the public not only on the advantages and disadvantages of SM but on its proper use."

We show that retinotopy is an emergent characteristic of this neurogenic program and derives directly from neuronal birth order. Our work illustrates how simple developmental rules can implement complex neural organization. A central question in neuroscience is how individual neurons are assembled into functional neural networks. In both vertebrates and invertebrates, visual input from the retina is retinotopically mapped onto the brain such that neighboring pixels are represented as neighboring regions on the retinotopic map. An example of such complex organization is found in the Drosophila optic lobe, which receives retinotopic input from photoreceptors in the eye (Fischbach and Dittrich, 1989Fischbach K.-F. Dittrich A.

The compound eye of the fly is made up of ∼800 ommatidia (unit eyes). Photoreceptors from each ommatidium send their axons into the optic lobe, which comprises four neuropiles that each contain ∼800 columns: the lamina, medulla, lobula, and lobula plate (Figures 1A–1C) (Bausenwein et al., 1992Bausenwein B.

Each column processes visual information from one point in space, maintaining retinotopy (Morante and Desplan, 2004Morante J. Desplan C.

The retinotopic organization of the fly visual system is crucial for circuit function, as exemplified by motion detection circuits. Within the optic lobe, visual motion information is processed in two parallel pathways: the ON pathway detecting bright edge motion and the OFF pathway that processes dark edge motion (Clark et al., 2011Clark D.A.

Both T4 and T5 neurons exist in four subtypes (termed a, b, c, and d) directionally tuned to one of the four cardinal directions (front-to-back, back-to-front, upward, and downward) (Figure 1B). Thus, for each column, four T4 and four T5 neurons, one of each subtype, represent eight independent motion detectors. T4 (ON) and T5 (OFF) neurons with the same directional tuning project retinotopically to one of the four layers of the lobula plate (Maisak et al., 2013Maisak M.S. Haag J. Ammer G. Serbe E. Meier M.

Nern A. et al.A directional tuning map of Drosophila elementary motion detectors.Nature. 2013; 500: 212-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar) that is organized into two layers for horizontal motion (layer a, front-to-back; layer b, back-to-front) and two layers for vertical motion (layer c, upward; layer d, downward) (Figure 1B). Within each layer, T4 and T5 neurons synapse with the dendrites of lobula plate tangential cells (Mauss et al., 2014Mauss A.S. Meier M. Serbe E. Borst A.

Thus, the retinotopy of the T4/T5 circuit is crucial for detecting broad field motion: at the level of T4 (medulla) and T5 (lobula) dendrites, where the retinotopic organization of the inputs onto T4/T5 dendrites allows direction selectivity to first emerge (Fisher et al., 2015Fisher Y.E.

It is therefore critical that the correct number of each T4 and T5 neuronal subtype be produced so that each medulla column is innervated by the four T4 neuronal subtypes and each lobula column by the four T5 subtypes. Furthermore, all eight subtypes of T4 and T5 neurons must project retinotopically to individual layers of the lobula plate. The four neuropiles of the optic lobes develop during the larval and the early pupal stages from two crescent-shaped neuroepithelial domains: the outer proliferation center (OPC), which produces neurons of the lamina and medulla, and the inner proliferation center (IPC), which generates neurons of the lobula and lobula plate (Figures 1D–1F; Movie S1) (Apitz and Salecker, 2015Apitz H.

It is divided into three domains: the surface IPC (sIPC) marked by Wingless expression (which will not be discussed further in this work) that is attached to the proximal IPC (pIPC), and a distal domain (dIPC) (Figure 1D). T4/T5 neurons are produced by progenitors that originate from the pIPC (Apitz and Salecker, 2015Apitz H. Salecker I.

Salecker I. A region-specific neurogenesis mode requires migratory progenitors in the Drosophila visual system.Nat. Neurosci. 2015; 18: 46-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). First, Dichaete+ NBs divide to self-renew and produce the distal C2, C3, T2, and T3 neurons (C/T neurons) to the outside of the dIPC crescent (Figures 1H, 1J, and 1L) (Apitz and Salecker, 2015Apitz H. Salecker I. A region-specific neurogenesis mode requires migratory progenitors in the Drosophila visual system.Nat. Neurosci. 2015; 18: 46-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In the second temporal window, these NBs express Atonal (Ato) and Dachshund (Dac) and produce T4 and T5 neurons to the inside of the crescent (Figures 1I–1L) (Apitz and Salecker, 2015Apitz H.

Hassan B.A. Proper connectivity of Drosophila motion detector neurons requires Atonal function in progenitor cells.Neural Dev. 2014; 9: 4Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). We investigated the developmental program that establishes the identity of the four T4 and four T5 neuronal subtypes and how this program leads to their eight coincident retinotopic maps. We identified a causal link between a mode of neurogenesis and retinotopy in which a single NB produces two ON and two OFF neurons with opposite motion direction selectivity (along the horizontal or the vertical axis) that innervate a single column in three neuropiles. We also show that vertical and horizontal T4/T5 motion detectors are produced by different NBs distinguished by Decapentaplegic (Dpp) activity. We conclude that retinotopy results from the features of this neurogenic program, which depends on neuronal birth order and a unique mode of NB division to pattern a complex and highly organized neural network. Thus, simple developmental rules can generate a complex neural organization across three neuropils of the optic lobes. The dIPC is formed by migrating progenitors produced by distinct pIPC-neuroepithelial domains expressing either Dpp or Brinker (Brk) (Apitz and Salecker, 2015Apitz H. Salecker I. A region-specific neurogenesis mode requires migratory progenitors in the Drosophila visual system.Nat. Neurosci. 2015; 18: 46-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The two Dpp-neuroepithelial domains are labeled by dpp-Gal4 (Apitz and Salecker, 2015Apitz H. Salecker I. A region-specific neurogenesis mode requires migratory progenitors in the Drosophila visual system.Nat.

The complementary Brk (a negative regulator of the Dpp pathway) domain sits between the two Dpp domains and is labeled by brk-lacZ and brk-Gal4, but does not express dpp-Gal4 (Figures 2A, 2B, and S1). Mosaic analysis with a repressible cellular marker (MARCM) and live imaging revealed that, even though cells delaminated from specific pIPC-neuroepitelial locations (Figure 1D, 1E, and 1G; Movies S1 and S2), they spread along the entire dorso-ventral axis when reaching the dIPC such that Brk- and Dpp-derived NBs distributed along the entire dIPC dorsal-ventral axis (Figures 2A–2D).Figure S1pIPC Is Compartmentalized into Brk and Dpp Domains, Related to Figure 2Show full captionThe compartmentalization of the pIPC has been described previously (Apitz and Salecker, 2015Apitz H.

The Dpp chains correspond to the most posterior chains, two dorsal and two ventral, while all chains anterior to these correspond to Brk derived chains.

(G and H) R17B05-Gal4 labels all the pIPC neuroepithelium, migrating chains and dIPC progenitors. In all panels, dashed lines delineate the pIPC. We hypothesized that Dpp signaling compartmentalizes the neuroepithelium and that the Brk and Dpp domains produce distinct subsets of T4 and T5 neurons. Upon binding Dpp, its receptor Thickveins (Tkv) phosphorylates the transcriptional effector Mad (pMad) that in turn regulates target gene expression. A lacZ reporter for Tkv was expressed within both the Dpp- and Brk-positive neuroepithelial domains (Figures 2E and 2F). However, pMad was only present in the Dpp domains, showing that the Dpp pathway is only active in the Dpp compartments of the neuroepithelium (Figures 2G and 2H). To test the role of Dpp in the specification of neuroepithelial identity, we used dpp-Gal4 to express a UAS-dpp-RNAi transgene; this led to the loss of pMad and to the expansion of the brk-lacZ reporter into the Dpp domains (Figure 2I). We also overexpressed a constitutively active form of the Tkv receptor (UAS-Tkv∗) in the entire pIPC-neuroepithelium using the pIPC-specific driver line R35B01-Gal4 (termed pIPC-Gal4) (Figure S1). This resulted in the loss of brk-lacZ expression and the expansion of pMad to the Brk domain (Figure 2J). To test the contribution of the Brk and Dpp neuroepithelial domains to the production of T4 and T5 subtypes, we used memory cassettes (Bertet et al., 2014Bertet C. Li X. Erclik T. Cavey M. Wells B. Desplan C. Temporal patterning of neuroblasts controls Notch-mediated cell survival through regulation of Hid or Reaper.Cell. 2014; 158: 1173-1186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) in combination with the T4/T5 specific line R42F06-lexA (termed T4/T5-lexA) (Schnell et al., 2012Schnell B. Raghu S.V. Nern A. Borst A. Columnar cells necessary for motion responses of wide-field visual interneurons in Drosophila.J. Comp. Physiol. A Neuroethol. Sens. Neural Behav. Physiol. 2012; 198: 389-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Activation of the memory cassette in early larvae (L2) within the Brk-neuroepithelial domain (using brk-Gal4) labeled all T4/T5 neurons of the horizontal system (subtypes a and b) (Figure 3A and 3C ), while activation in the Dpp-neuroepithelial domains (using dpp-pIPC-Gal4) labeled all T4/T5 neurons of the vertical system (subtypes c and d) (Figures 3B and 3C). This demonstrates that the motion-detecting T4/T5 neurons of the horizontal and vertical systems derive from distinct neuroepithelial domains. Given that Dpp signaling established neuroepithelial identity, we hypothesized that Dpp signaling specifies the identity of horizontal and vertical system neurons. To test this hypothesis, we overexpressed Tkv∗ in the entire pIPC neuroepithelium from late L2 until early pupae using the pIPC-specific driver line R17B05-Gal4 (Figure S1) and visualized the neurons produced using T4/T5-lexA. Expression of Tkv∗ resulted in pMad expression in the entire pIPC neuroepithelium and in all migrating chains (Figure 3D and 3E) and in the production of a lobula plate consisting of only c and d layers (compare Figures 3F to 3G) that are specifically labeled by the cell-adhesion molecule Connectin (compare Figures 3H to 3I) (Gao et al., 2008Gao S. Takemura S.Y. Ting C.Y. Huang S. Lu Z. Luan H. Rister J. Thum A.S. Yang M. Hong S.T. et al.The neural substrate of spectral preference in Drosophila.Neuron. 2008; 60: 328-342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Altogether, these observations show that Dpp signaling establishes the identity of the Brk and Dpp neuroepithelial domains, which give rise to horizontal (Brk) and vertical (Dpp) motion-sensitive T4/T5 neurons, respectively. Upon delamination, migrating progenitors reach the dIPC where they assume a NB identity (Figure 1L). dIPC NBs first express Dichaete and divide to self-renew and produce Pros+ ganglion mother cells (GMCs) that generate neurons with C/T identity (Figures 1H, 1J, and 1L) (Apitz and Salecker, 2015Apitz H. Salecker I. A region-specific neurogenesis mode requires migratory progenitors in the Drosophila visual system.Nat. Neurosci. 2015; 18: 46-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). These NBs then age, express Ato and Dac, and exclusively produce T4 and T5 neurons (Figures 1H–1L) (Apitz and Salecker, 2015Apitz H. Salecker I.

We observed that newborn Ato+/Dac+/Pros+ GMCs were distributed in a salt-and-pepper manner surrounding T4/T5 Ato+/Pros− NBs (Figures 4A and S2). The GMCs lost Ato expression by the time they divided to produce T4 and T5 neurons (Figure S2). During a typical GMC division, Notch signaling triggers a binary fate decision establishing the distinct identity of its two neuronal progeny: a NotchON and a NotchOFF neuron (Bertet et al., 2014Bertet C.

To test the involvement of Notch in the specification of T4 versus T5 neuronal identity, we first determined the Notch status of developing neurons by monitoring the expression of the bHLH-O protein Hairy/enhancer-of-split-related with YRPW motif (Hey), which is a reliable sensor of Notch activity in optic lobe neurons (Bertet et al., 2014Bertet C.

We found that Hey was expressed in a salt and pepper manner in early born T4/T5 neurons (Figure 4B). This suggests that dIPC NBs that are Ato+/Dac+ produce GMCs that divide once to produce two neurons with alternative identities dictated by their Notch status. To test this hypothesis, we generated MARCM and twin-spot MARCM clones during the larval and the early pupal stages that labeled the two progeny of Ato+/Dac+ GMCs with distinct fluorescent proteins (Yu et al., 2009Yu H.H.

Results using these tools suggest that the Anoctamin Superfamily of cation and anion channels, as well as lipid scramblases, includes three functionally characterized families: the Anoctamin (ANO), Transmembrane Channel (TMC) and Ca2+-permeable Stress-gated Cation Channel (CSC) families; as well as four families of functionally uncharacterized proteins, which we refer to as the Anoctamin-like (ANO-L), Transmembrane Channel-like (TMC-L), and CSC-like (CSC-L1 and CSC-L2) families. We have constructed protein clusters and trees showing the relative relationships among the seven families. Topological analyses suggest that the members of these families have essentially the same topologies.

https://openalex.org/W2790636498,"Glucagon levels increase under homeostatic, fasting conditions, promoting the release of glucose from the liver by accelerating the breakdown of glycogen (also known as glycogenolysis). Glucagon also enhances gluconeogenic flux, including from an increase in the hepatic consumption of amino acids. In type 2 diabetes, dysregulated glucagon signaling contributes to the elevated hepatic glucose output and fasting hyperglycemia that occur in this condition. Yet, the mechanism by which glucagon stimulates gluconeogenesis remains incompletely understood. Contrary to the prevailing belief that glucagon acts primarily on cytoplasmic and nuclear targets, we find glucagon-dependent stimulation of mitochondrial anaplerotic flux from glutamine that increases the contribution of this amino acid to the carbons of glucose generated during gluconeogenesis. This enhanced glucose production is dependent on protein kinase A (PKA) and is associated with glucagon-stimulated calcium release from the endoplasmic reticulum, activation of mitochondrial α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase, and increased glutaminolysis. Mice with reduced levels of hepatic glutaminase 2 (GLS2), the enzyme that catalyzes the first step in glutamine metabolism, show lower glucagon-stimulated glutamine-to-glucose flux in vivo, and GLS2 knockout results in higher fasting plasma glucagon and glutamine levels with lower fasting blood glucose levels in insulin-resistant conditions. As found in genome-wide association studies (GWAS), human genetic variation in the region of GLS2 is associated with higher fasting plasma glucose; here we show in human cryopreserved primary hepatocytes in vitro that these natural gain-of-function missense mutations in GLS2 result in higher glutaminolysis and glucose production. These data emphasize the importance of gluconeogenesis from glutamine, particularly in pathological states of increased glucagon signaling, while suggesting a possible new therapeutic avenue to treat hyperglycemia."
https://openalex.org/W2792339042,"Targeting tyrosine kinase receptors that share the feedback inhibitor PTPN12 leads to broad spectrum therapeutic suppression of triple-negative breast cancer. Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an aggressive subtype of breast cancer diagnosed in more than 200,000 women each year1 and is recalcitrant to targeted therapies2,3. Although TNBCs harbor multiple hyperactive receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs)4,5,6,7,8, RTK inhibitors have been largely ineffective in TNBC patients thus far. We developed a broadly effective therapeutic strategy for TNBC that is based on combined inhibition of receptors that share the negative regulator PTPN12. Previously, we and others identified the tyrosine phosphatase PTPN12 as a tumor suppressor that is frequently inactivated in TNBC9,10. PTPN12 restrains several RTKs9,11,12,13,14,15,16,17, suggesting that PTPN12 deficiency leads to aberrant activation of multiple RTKs and a co-dependency on these receptors. This in turn leads to the therapeutic hypothesis that PTPN12-deficient TNBCs may be responsive to combined RTK inhibition. However, the repertoire of RTKs that are restrained by PTPN12 in human cells has not been systematically explored. By methodically identifying the suite of RTK substrates (MET, PDGFRβ, EGFR, and others) inhibited by PTPN12, we rationalized a combination RTK-inhibitor therapy that induced potent tumor regression across heterogeneous models of TNBC. Orthogonal approaches revealed that PTPN12 was recruited to and inhibited these receptors after ligand stimulation, thereby serving as a feedback mechanism to limit receptor signaling. Cancer-associated mutation of PTPN12 or reduced PTPN12 protein levels diminished this feedback mechanism, leading to aberrant activity of these receptors. Restoring PTPN12 protein levels restrained signaling from RTKs, including PDGFRβ and MET, and impaired TNBC survival. In contrast with single agents, combined inhibitors targeting the PDGFRβ and MET receptors induced the apoptosis in TNBC cells in vitro and in vivo. This therapeutic strategy resulted in tumor regressions in chemo-refractory patient-derived TNBC models. Notably, response correlated with PTPN12 deficiency, suggesting that impaired receptor feedback may establish a combined addiction to these proto-oncogenic receptors. Taken together, our data provide a rationale for combining RTK inhibitors in TNBC and other malignancies that lack receptor-activating mutations."

The sputa microbiota of COPD patients was evaluated when clinically stable and during acute exacerbations of the disease. Sputa microbiota was analyzed using 16S ribosomal RNA gene pyrosequencing and quantitative polymerase chain reaction-based pathogen detection. Nine COPD patients were enrolled. Pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA genes identified 2,267 unique bacterial operational taxonomic units. Principal microbiota shifts during exacerbation were in either Proteobacteria, Firmicutes or Bacteroidetes. Streptococcus and Moraxella levels were detected during exacerbation in severe (Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease 3) COPD patients. Most of the clinically-important genera found in the sputum with the pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA gene correlated with specific quantitative polymerase chain reactions for bacteria while respiratory viruses were nearly absent. Sputum microbiotas of exacerbated COPD patients are complex. This pilot study shows a clear shift in the microbiota of patients during exacerbation. The nature of this shift varies from patient to patient in such a way that the treatment should be patient-specific. Further studies are needed to establish the impact of microbial exacerbations on the pulmonary microbiota."

https://openalex.org/W2792008371,"Background A constant preoccupation with food and restrictive eating are main symptoms of anorexia nervosa (AN). Imaging studies revealed aberrant neural activation patterns in brain regions processing hedonic and reward reactions as well as–potentially aversive–emotions. An imbalance between so called “bottom-up” and “top-down” control areas is discussed. The present study is focusing on neural processing of disease-specific food stimuli and emotional stimuli and its developmental course in adolescent and adult AN patients and could offer new insight into differential mechanisms underlying shorter or more chronic disease. Methods 33 adolescents aged 12–18 years (15 AN patients, 18 control participants) and 32 adult women (16 AN patients, 16 control participants) underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI, 3T high-field scanner) while watching pictures of high and low-calorie food and affective stimuli. Afterwards, they rated subjective valence of each picture. FMRI data analysis was performed using a region of interest based approach. Results Pictures of high-calorie food items were rated more negatively by AN patients. Differences in activation between patients and controls were found in “bottom up” and “top down” control areas for food stimuli and in several emotion processing regions for affective stimuli which were more pronounced in adolescents than in adults. Conclusion A differential pattern was seen for food stimuli compared to generally emotion eliciting stimuli. Adolescents with AN show reduced processing of affective stimuli and enhanced activation of regions involved in “bottom up” reward processing and “top down” control as well as the insula with regard to food stimuli with a focus on brain regions which underlie changes during adolescent development. In adults less clear and less specific activation differences were present, pointing towards a high impact that regions undergoing maturation might have on AN symptoms."
https://openalex.org/W2792052811,"Background Osteosarcoma is an orphan disease for which little improvement in survival has been made since the late 1980s. New drug discovery for orphan diseases is limited by the cost and time it takes to develop new drugs. Repurposing already approved FDA-drugs can help overcome this limitation. Another limitation of cancer drug discovery is the lack of preclinical models that accurately recapitulate what occurs in humans. For OS using dogs as a model can minimize this limitation as OS in canines develops spontaneously, is locally invasive and metastasizes to the lungs as it does in humans. Methods In our present work we used high-throughput screens to identify drugs from a library of 2,286 FDA-approved drugs that demonstrated selective growth inhibition against both human and canine OS cell lines. The identified lead compound was then tested for synergy with 7 other drugs that have demonstrated activity against OS. These results were confirmed with in vitro assays and an in vivo murine model of OS. Results We identified 13 drugs that demonstrated selective growth inhibition against both human and canine OS cell lines. Auranofin was selected for further in vitro combination drug screens. Auranofin showed synergistic effects with vorinostat and rapamycin on OS viability and apoptosis induction. Auranofin demonstrated single-agent growth inhibition in both human and canine OS xenografts, and cooperative growth inhibition was observed in combination with rapamycin or vorinostat. There was a significant decrease in Ki67-positive cells and an increase in cleaved caspase-3 levels in tumor tissues treated with a combination of auranofin and vorinostat or rapamycin. Conclusions Auranofin, alone or in combination with rapamycin or vorinostat, may be useful new treatment strategies for OS. Future studies may evaluate the efficacy of auranofin in dogs with OS as a prelude to human clinical evaluation."
https://openalex.org/W2790090635,"Clinical trials using strategies aimed at inducing dystrophin expression in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) are underway or at advanced planning stage, including splice switching antisense oligonucleotides (AON), drugs to induce read-through of nonsense mutations and viral mediated gene therapy. In all these strategies, different dystrophin proteins, often internally deleted, are produced, similar to those found in patients with the milder DMD allelic variant, Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD). The primary biological endpoint of these trials is to induce functional dystrophin expression. A reliable and reproducible method for quantification of dystrophin protein expression at the sarcolemma is crucial to monitor the biochemical outcome of such treatments. We developed a new high throughput semi quantitative fluorescent immunofluorescence method for quantifying dystrophin expression in transverse sections of skeletal muscle. This technique is completely operator independent as it based on an automated scanning system and an image processing script developed with Definiens software. We applied this new acquisition-analysis method to quantify dystrophin and sarcolemma-related proteins using paediatric control muscles from cases without a neuromuscular disorder as well as DMD and BMD samples. The image analysis script was instructed to recognize myofibres immunostained for spectrin or laminin while dystrophin was quantified in each identified myofibre (from 2,000 to over 20,000 fibres, depending on the size of the biopsy). We were able to simultaneously extrapolate relevant parameters such as mean sarcolemmal dystrophin, mean spectrin and laminin intensity, fibre area and diameter. In this way we assessed dystrophin production in each muscle fibre in samples of DMD, BMD and controls. This new method allows the unbiased quantification of dystrophin in every myofibre within a transverse muscle section and will be of help for translational research projects as a biological outcome in clinical trials in DMD and BMD."
https://openalex.org/W2791364737,"Background Transfusion-transmissible infections (TTIs) pose a significant challenge for the availability and safety of blood transfusion. The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence and risk factors for TTIs among blood donors in North Shewa zone, central North Ethiopia. Methods A retrospective survey of blood donors’ medical records was conducted from April 2014 to June 2017 to assess the presence of hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and syphilis infections. Descriptive statistics such as percentage, median and interquartile range were used to summarize the data. Results Out of 8460 donations, 207 (2.4%, 95% CI 2.06–2.71%) had serological evidence of infection with at least one pathogen. Four of the blood donors (0.047%) had co-infection with more than one pathogen; 2HIV/HBV and 2HIV/syphilis. The overall prevalence of HBV, HCV, HIV, and syphilis among the donors were 1.2% (95% CI 0.98–1.45%), 0.32% (95% CI 0.2–0.44%), 0.25% (95% CI 0.14–0.35%), and 0.71% (95% CI 0.53–0.89%) respectively. Male sex was significantly associated with higher risk of HBV (OR 1.75, 95% CI 1.1–2.8) and syphilis sero-reactivity (OR 4.5, 95% CI1.9–10.5). Farmers and older donors were found to be at a higher risk for syphilis seropositivity. Conclusion The prevalence of TTIs among blood donors in North Shewa zone was relatively low compared to those of other geographic places in Ethiopia. However, TTIs remain a concern for the availability and safety of blood transfusion as they are still prevalent in the study area. Therefore, more efforts are required to ensure the safety of blood supply and transfusions."

TNFA polymorphisms (-1031T>C;-857C>T;-376G>A;-308G>A;-238G>A) and HLA-B27 were assayed by RT-PCR. Direct sequencing of MEFV (exons 2,3,5 and 10) and TNFRSF1A (exons 2,3,4 and 6) genes were performed.HLA-B27 was associated with AS (χ2 = 120.1; p = 0.000). Only the TNFA -1031T>C was singly associated with SpA, and the haplotype C/G, resulting from -1031T>C/-308G>A combination, was significantly associated with a reduced risk of SpA (OR: 0.67, CI: 0.46-0.97; p = 0.035). Two SNPs were identified in TNFRSF1A, the R92Q (Minor allele frequency-MAF = 0.034) and c.625+10A>G (MAF = 0.479). None of them was associated with SpA (p>0.05). The TNFRSF1A c.625+10 G allele was associated with late response to anti-TNFα therapy (p = 0.031). Twenty-one SNPs were identified in MEFV gene, 10 with a known potential functional significance. Variant alleles were extremely rare in our population (MAF<0.025) except for R202Q (MAF = 0.27). None was associated with SpA diagnosis (p>0.05).TNFRSF1A and MEFV gene SNPs are not associated with SpA in the North-East of Italy.

Scl-Ab did not prevent soleus atrophy, consistent with the relatively low circulating sclerostin concentrations and with the 91–99% lower LRP5/LRP6 gene expressions in soleus versus tibia (p<0.001), a tissue with known anabolic responsiveness to Scl-Ab. In comparison, TE partially prevented soleus atrophy and increased levator ani/bulbocavernosus (LABC) mass by 30–40% (p<0.001 vs all groups). The differing myotrophic responsiveness coincided with a 3-fold higher androgen receptor gene expression in LABC versus soleus (p<0.01). This study provides the first direct evidence that Scl-Ab does not prevent soleus muscle atrophy in rodents after SCI and suggests that variable myotrophic responses in rodent muscles after androgen administration are influenced by androgen receptor expression."
https://openalex.org/W2793421588,"The current distribution of freshwater fishes across multiple basins along Eastern Brazil can be associated to two main events: river captures or temporary paleoconnections. Apparently, river captures had a more significant role on distribution and structuring of species from upland areas, such as Glandulocauda melanopleura. Populations of this species are found in contiguous drainages in presently isolated upper parts of Rio Tietê and the coastal basins of Guaratuba, Itatinga, Itanháem, and Ribeira de Iguape, in the Atlantic Forest domain. The allopatric and disjoint distribution of G. melanopleura associated with variation of morphological characters detected among geographically isolated populations stimulated this study. Thus, an integrative approach was undertaken, including morphological and molecular data, to better understand the evolutionary history of the species and the area where it occurs. Molecular analyses based on two mitochondrial markers revealed a strong genetic structure within G. melanopleura, that allowed recognition of two lineages, one distributed in both the upper Tietê and Itanhaém and the other in the Guaratuba. Overall, morphological data revealed some intraspecific overlapping variation, indicating that all samples are conspecific. Phylogenetic and phylogeographic analyses allied to divergence times and geomorphological information indicate that the current distribution of G. melanopleura is a result of relatively recent river captures involving the Tietê and some other coastal drainages. Although of recent origin, they occurred long enough to completely isolate these populations, since there are no haplotypes sharing between them. The conservation status of this species is also discussed, and our results corroborate the need to understand population structure for conservation planning."
https://openalex.org/W2793817695,"Background & aims People who inject drugs (PWID) living with hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection often experience barriers to accessing HCV treatment and care. New, safer and more effective direct-acting antiviral-based therapies offer an opportunity to scale-up HCV-related services. Methadone maintenance therapy (MMT) programs have been shown to be effective in linking PWID to health and support services, largely in the context of HIV. The objective of the study was to examine the relationship between being enrolled in MMT and having access to regular physician care regarding HCV among HCV antibody-positive PWID in Vancouver, Canada. Design Three prospective cohort studies of people who use illicit drugs. Setting Vancouver, Canada. Participants We restricted the study sample to 1627 HCV-positive PWID between September 2005 and May 2015. Measurements A marginal structural model using inverse probability of treatment weights was used to estimate the longitudinal relationship between being enrolled in MMT and having a regular HCV physician and/or specialist. Findings In total, 1357 (83.4%) reported having access to regular physician care regarding HCV at least once during the study period. A marginal structural model estimated a 2.12 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.77–2.20) greater odds of having a regular HCV physician among participants enrolled in MMT compared to those not enrolled. Conclusions HCV-positive PWID who enrolled in MMT were more likely to report access to regular physician care regarding HCV compared to those not enrolled in MMT. These findings demonstrate that opioid agonist treatment may be helpful in linking PWID to HCV care, and highlight the need to better engage people who use drugs in substance use care, when appropriate."
https://openalex.org/W2789851457,"Determining the relative influence of biotic and abiotic factors on genetic connectivity among populations remains a major challenge in evolutionary biology and in the management and conservation of species. North Pacific hake (Merluccius productus) inhabits upwelling regions in the California Current ecosystem from the Gulf of California to the Gulf of Alaska. In this study, we examined mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and microsatellite variation to estimate levels of genetic differentiation of M. productus in relation to the role of oceanographic features as potential barriers to gene flow. Samples were obtained from nine sites spanning a large part of the geographic range of the species, from Puget Sound, Washington to Costa Rica. The microsatellite results revealed three genetically discrete populations: one spanning the eastern Pacific coast, and two apparently resident populations circumscribed to the Puget Sound and the northern Gulf of California (FST = 0.032, p = 0.036). Cytochrome b sequence data indicated that isolation between the Puget Sound and northern Gulf of California populations from the coastal Pacific were recent phenomena (18.5 kyr for Puget Sound and 40 kyr for the northern Gulf of California). Oceanographic data obtained from the Gulf of California support the hypothesis that permanent fronts within the region, and strong gradients at the entrance to the Gulf of California act as barriers to gene flow. A seascape genetics approach found significant genetic–environment associations, where the daytime sea surface temperature and chlorophyll concentrations were the best predictive variables for the observed genetic differentiation. Considering the potential causes of genetic isolation among the three populations, e.g. spawning areas in different latitudes associated with upwelling processes, oceanographic barriers, asymmetric migration and specialized diet, oceanographic barriers appear to be a likely mechanism restricting gene flow."

ENaC is the only constitutively open ion channel in the degenerin/ENaC protein family, and its expression, membrane abundance, and open probability therefore are tightly controlled. The canonical ENaC is composed of three subunits (α, β, and γ), but a fourth δ-subunit may replace α and form atypical δβγ-ENaCs. Using Xenopus laevis as a model, here we found that mRNAs of the α- and δ-subunits are differentially expressed in different tissues and that δ-ENaC predominantly is present in the urogenital tract. Using whole-cell and single-channel electrophysiology of oocytes expressing Xenopus αβγ- or δβγ-ENaC, we demonstrate that the presence of the δ-subunit enhances the amount of current generated by ENaC due to an increased open probability, but also changes current into a transient form. Activity of canonical ENaCs is critically dependent on proteolytic processing of the α- and γ-subunits, and immunoblotting with epitope-tagged ENaC subunits indicated that, unlike α-ENaC, the δ-subunit does not undergo proteolytic maturation by the endogenous protease furin. Furthermore, currents generated by δβγ-ENaC were insensitive to activation by extracellular chymotrypsin, and presence of the δ-subunit prevented cleavage of γ-ENaC at the cell surface.

In addition to these regulatory mechanisms, ENaC activity is linked to its maturation state through proteolytic processing of its subunits (2Kleyman T.R. Kashlan O.B. Hughey R.P. Epithelial Na+ channel regulation by extracellular and intracellular factors.Annu. Rev.

The canonical ENaC is a heterotrimeric channel composed of three homologous subunits (α, β, and γ) (8Canessa C.M. Schild L. Buell G. Thorens B. Gautschi I. Horisberger J.D. Rossier B.C.

Each subunit has short intracellular N and C termini connected by a large extracellular loop. The extracellular loop probably represents a “handlike” structure, consisting of a “palm,” “ball,” “finger,” “thumb,” and “knuckle” domain (9Stockand J.D. Staruschenko A. Pochynyuk O. Booth R.E. Silverthorn D.U.

The extracellular loops of the α- and γ-subunits contain short inhibitory peptides in the finger domains, which are flanked by protease cleavage sites. The inhibitory peptide within the α-subunit is flanked by two cleavage sites that are recognized by the protease furin, whereas the inhibitory peptide within the γ-subunit contains only one furin cleavage site and additional cleavage sites for extracellular proteases (10Kleyman T.R. Carattino M.D. Hughey R.P. ENaC at the cutting edge: regulation of epithelial sodium channels by proteases.J. Biol.

Furin, which is primarily present in the trans-Golgi network, cleaves the α-subunit twice and thereby releases its inhibitory peptide, whereas the γ-subunit is only cut once (2Kleyman T.R. Kashlan O.B. Hughey R.P. Epithelial Na+ channel regulation by extracellular and intracellular factors.Annu. Rev.

Channels lacking this endogenous proteolytic maturation display a very low Po, whereas furin-cleaved ENaCs that are translocated to the plasma membrane have moderate activity. Extracellular proteases cut the γ-subunit and thereby release its inhibitory peptide, resulting in ENaCs with a high Po (2Kleyman T.R. Kashlan O.B. Hughey R.P.

Proteolytic processing not only represents an additional level of ENaC regulation but was also suggested to be crucial for the transition of a stimulus-activated DEG/ENaC ancestor to a constitutively open channel during ENaC evolution (10Kleyman T.R.

In addition to the three subunits composing canonical ENaCs, a δ-subunit was identified, which can assemble with the β- and γ-subunits to form atypical ENaCs (11Waldmann R. Champigny G. Bassilana F. Voilley N. Lazdunski M. Molecular cloning and functional expression of a novel amiloride-sensitive Na+ channel.J. Biol.

The physiological importance of this subunit is not understood, but in vitro studies using human orthologues demonstrated that δβγ-ENaC has distinct properties from αβγ-ENaC (12Giraldez T. Rojas P. Jou J. Flores C. Alvarez de la Rosa D. The epithelial sodium channel δ-subunit: new notes for an old song.Am. J. Physiol. Renal. Physiol. 2012; 303 (22573384): F328-F33810.1152/ajprenal.00116.2012Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Complicating its physiological analysis, mice and rats lack a functional gene for δ-ENaC (13Schönberger M. Althaus M. Fronius M. Clauss W. Trauner D.

However, δ-ENaC is present in amphibians, including the South African clawed frog Xenopus laevis, where it had originally been named ɛ-ENaC (14Babini E. Geisler H.-S. Siba M. Gründer S. A new subunit of the epithelial Na+ channel identifies regions involved in Na+ self-inhibition.J. Biol.

Given the lack of an appropriate animal model to study this ion channel and the fact that X. laevis is an established model organism in molecular cell biology as well as physiology, this study investigated the molecular physiology of ENaC containing the δ-subunit in this species. We demonstrate that δ-ENaC has a different expression pattern compared with α-ENaC and that δ-containing channels display an intrinsic dynamic open probability. We show that incorporation of the δ-subunit renders this amphibian ENaC completely insensitive to proteolytic activation by extracellular proteases due to intersubunit interactions involving γ-ENaC. We suggest that subunit composition provides an additional level of ENaC regulation but also propose that Xenopus δ-ENaC represents a functional example for ENaC at the interface of stimulus-activated and constitutively open DEG/ENaC ion channels, demonstrating the importance of proteolytic maturation in ENaC evolution. Due to the lack of specific antibodies that allow discrimination of α- and δ-ENaC, expression of these subunits was investigated in adult X. laevis via RT-PCR (Fig. 1). Control reactions were performed with cDNA samples that were generated without the addition of reverse transcriptase. These reactions were always negative and did not show any DNA signals in the MidoriGreen fluorescence of the agarose gels after the PCRs (data not shown). Transcripts for the δ-ENaC subunit were almost exclusively found in urogenital tissues (kidney, urinary bladder, testes, ovary, oocytes, and cloaca), whereas expression of the α-subunit was more diversely distributed (skin, lung, liver, parts of the gastrointestinal and urogenital tract, brain, and spinal cord). All δ-ENaC–expressing tissues, except the ovary, also contained transcripts for the α-subunit. Functional characterization of αβγ- and δβγ-ENaC was achieved by expression of either channel isoform in X. laevis oocytes. Although transcripts for δ-ENaC were detected in oocytes (Fig. 1) injection of β- and γ-ENaC RNA does not produce amiloride-sensitive transmembrane current (IM) (14Babini E. Geisler H.-S. Siba M. Gründer S. A new subunit of the epithelial Na+ channel identifies regions involved in Na+ self-inhibition.J. Biol.

Electrophysiological assessment of whole-cell IM at membrane potentials (VM) from −100 to +40 mV revealed an inward current at negative VM with a reversal potential of 9.8 mV (αβγ-ENaC) and 14.2 mV (δβγ-ENaC) and was inhibited by the ENaC-blocker amiloride (Fig. 2a). Consistent with previous reports (14Babini E. Geisler H.-S. Siba M. Gründer S. A new subunit of the epithelial Na+ channel identifies regions involved in Na+ self-inhibition.J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278 (12764146): 28418-2842610.1074/jbc.M301315200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), channel isoforms exhibited different kinetics of IM after washout of amiloride. Cells expressing αβγ-ENaC display a slow and steady current increase that eventually reaches a plateau, whereas channels containing the δ-subunit show a rapid, peaked increase in IM followed by a continuous current decline (Fig. 2b). Despite this current rundown, amiloride-sensitive current fractions (ΔIami) of δβγ-ENaC–expressing oocytes were 2.4-fold larger than in αβγ-ENaC–expressing cells (Fig. 2c). The increased ΔIami mediated by δβγ-ENaC was also sustained after 14 min when the current eventually approached a plateau (Fig. 2, d and e). The increased ΔIami of δβγ-ENaC–expressing oocytes may result from changes in the single-channel conductance, Po, or membrane abundance of these channels. Cell-attached patch-clamp recordings of oocytes expressing δβγ-ENaC revealed unitary channel characteristics similar to α-ENaC–containing channels (Fig. 3a). Analysis of individual recordings lasting for 120–180 s revealed no significant difference between ENaC isoforms in the number of visible channels or the slope conductance (Gslope), derived from VM of −100 to −40 mV (Fig. 3, b and c). Although there was no difference in Po compared with αβγ-ENaC, channels containing the δ-subunit displayed significantly prolonged open times and a tendency for extended mean closed times that did not reach statistical significance (Fig. 3, d and e). Consistent with whole-cell currents (Fig. 2d), patch-clamp recordings of δβγ-ENaC regularly showed a decline of channel activity (Fig. 3f), which impaired proper estimation of Po. Therefore, Po of αβγ- and δβγ-ENaC was additionally determined using 2-(trimethylammonium)ethylmethanethiosulfonate (MTSET)-sensitive βS540C-ENaC mutant channels. Covalent modification of an introduced cysteine within the conserved degenerin site of β-ENaC by MTSET elevates Po of ENaC containing the βS540C mutation to 1.0 (16Snyder P.M. Bucher D.B. Olson D.R. Gating induces a conformational change in the outer vestibule of ENaC.J. Gen. Physiol. 2000; 116 (11099347): 781-79010.1085/jgp.116.6.781Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Comparison of ΔIami before and after MTSET application allows estimation of channel Po. The ΔIami of oocytes expressing αβS540Cγ- or δβS540Cγ-ENaC was not significantly different from that for cells expressing respective WT channels (Fig. 4a). Po of αβS540Cγ- or δβS540Cγ-ENaC was estimated by measuring ΔIami before and after administration of MTSET (1 mm), which increased IM mediated by both channels (Fig. 4, b and c), assuming that MTSET shifts the Po of both channel isoforms to the same degree (close to 1.0). Although initial ΔIami of δβS540Cγ-ENaC was increased compared with α-ENaC–containing channels, this discrepancy was lost after application of MTSET (Fig. 4d). Comparison of the initial ΔIami with ΔIami after exposure to MTSET (Po = 1.0) indicated a significantly larger initial Po for ENaC containing the δ-subunit compared with αβS540Cγ-ENaC (Fig. 4e). Overall, these data suggest that the presence of the δ-subunit enhances the amount of current generated by ENaC due to an increased Po rather than single-channel conductance, but also changes current into a transient form.Figure 4The MTSET-sensitive βS540C-ENaC mutant reveals an increased open probability of ENaCs containing the δ-subunit. a, amiloride-sensitive current fractions (ΔIami) of oocytes expressing αβγ- or δβγ-ENaC containing either WT β-ENaC or the βS540C-ENaC mutation (Student's unpaired t test). b and c, representative IM traces of oocytes expressing αβS540Cγ- or δβS540Cγ-ENaC.

In contrast, only the full-length peptide of the δHA/V5-subunit at ∼75 kDa was detected, consistent with the lack of a minimal consensus sequence for furin-mediated cleavage (RXXR↓ (18Thomas G. Furin at the cutting edge: from protein traffic to embryogenesis and disease.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3 (12360192): 753-76610.1038/nrm934Crossref PubMed Scopus (937) Google Scholar)) in this ENaC subunit. These findings were confirmed by blots targeting the C-terminal V5 tags, which yielded two signals for αHA/V5-ENaC, representing full-length (∼75 kDa) and cleaved (∼60 kDa) peptides but only one signal (∼75 kDa) representing the full-length δHA/V5-ENaC. Proteolysis by furin would occur in the trans-Golgi network. Therefore, glycosylation of the δHA/V5-subunit, which is also associated with this route for post-translational modification, was examined. Treatment of whole-cell lysates from oocytes expressingδHA/V5βγ-ENaC with PNGase F induced a downward migration shift of the signal in blots targeting the V5 tag (Fig. 5c). This indicates glycosylation of the δ-ENaC subunit and suggests passage through the trans-Golgi network. Epitope-tagged αHA/V5- and δHA/V5-ENaC subunits were subsequently employed to compare membrane abundance of both channel isoforms by surface biotinylation. Similar to WT channels, the ΔIamimediated by δHA/V5βγ-ENaC was increased compared with αHA/V5βγ-ENaC (Fig. 5, d and e). Only a single signal (∼60 kDa) was detected in membrane fractions from αHA/V5βγ-ENaC–expressing cells, indicating the absence of unprocessed αHA/V5-ENaC peptides at the cell surface, whereas only unprocessed δHA/V5-ENaC peptides (∼75 kDa) could be detected in membrane and cytosolic fractions (Fig. 5f). Membrane abundance was determined by densitometric analysis of signal intensities from both membrane and cytosolic protein fractions in V5-targeted immunoblots. There was no difference in surface expression between αHA/V5βγ- and δHA/V5βγ-ENaC (Fig. 5g), supporting the notion that an enhanced Po rather than membrane abundance contributes to the increased IM mediated by ENaC containing the δ-subunit. In sum, these data suggest that unlike α-ENaC, the δ-subunit does not undergo proteolytic maturation by the endogenous protease furin, and incorporation of this subunit does not affect channel membrane abundance. Because the δ-ENaC subunit is not processed by furin, the activation of αβγ- and δβγ-ENaC by extracellular proteases was compared. Oocytes expressing either ENaC isoform were exposed to chymotrypsin, which activates ENaC at the cell surface (19Haerteis S. Krueger B. Korbmacher C. Rauh R. The δ-subunit of the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) enhances channel activity and alters proteolytic ENaC activation.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284 (19717556): 29024-2904010.1074/jbc.M109.018945Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The ΔIami of both channel isoforms was determined before and after perfusion of the cells with 2 μg/ml α-chymotrypsin (from bovine pancreas, TLCK-treated; Sigma) in ORS (90 mm NaCl, 1 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) containing amiloride for 5 min (Fig. 6, a and d). Administration of chymotrypsin significantly increased ΔIami of oocytes expressing αβγ-ENaC (Fig. 6b). This activation was also present in cells incubated with furin inhibitor I (40 μm) before recordings. Inhibition of furin potentiated the proteolytic activation of αβγ-ENaC from a 4-fold to a 9-fold increase of ΔIami, whereas no change of ΔIami (-fold activation = 1) was observed in control groups that were perfused with ORS containing amiloride without chymotrypsin (Fig. 6c). Application of chymotrypsin did not increase currents mediated by δβγ-ENaC, regardless of preceding incubation with the furin inhibitor (Fig. 6, d–f). The same results were observed using trypsin (data not shown). These data indicate that currents generated by δβγ-ENaC are insensitive to activation by extracellular serine proteases, such as chymotrypsin and trypsin. Intracellular cleavage of the γ-ENaC subunit renders the channel susceptible to activation by extracellular proteases (20Carattino M.D. Hughey R.P. Kleyman T.R. Proteolytic processing of the epithelial sodium channel γ subunit has a dominant role in channel activation.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283 (18650438): 25290-2529510.1074/jbc.M803931200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Cleavage of γ-ENaC at the cell surface by extracellular proteases induces the release of its inhibitory peptide and activates the channel (21Bruns J.B. Carattino M.D. Sheng S. Maarouf A.B. Weisz O.A. Pilewski J.M. Hughey R.P. Kleyman T.R. Epithelial Na+ channels are fully activated by furin- and prostasin-dependent release of an inhibitory peptide from the γ-subunit.J. Biol.

Because the δ-subunit prevented ENaC activation by extracellular chymotrypsin, the cleavage states of the α-, δ-, and γ-subunits at successive stages of proteolytic ENaC processing were examined. Epitope-tagged subunits were expressed in oocytes together with WT ENaC subunits (αHA/V5βγ, δHA/V5βγ, αβγHA/V5, and δβγHA/V5), and ΔIami of individual oocytes from each group with or without prior incubation in chymotrypsin (2 μg/ml; 5 min) was measured. After surface biotinylation, membrane fractions were isolated, and cleavage states of individual ENaC subunits were analyzed in immunoblots targeted at the C-terminal V5 epitope. Incubation with chymotrypsin enhanced ΔIami of αHA/V5βγ-ENaC–expressing oocytes, whereas this activation was absent inδHA/V5βγ-ENaC–expressing cells (Fig. 7a). In corresponding immunoblots, two signals at ∼75 and ∼60 kDa were visible in cytosolic fractions for the αHA/V5-ENaC subunit that represent uncleaved and furin-cleaved peptides, whereas only processed subunits were present in membrane fractions (Fig. 7b). Analogous stages of subunit maturation were not observed for the δHA/V5-subunit, for which only one signal at ∼75 kDa was visible in cytosolic and membrane fractions. No additional cleavage products of αHA/V5- and δHA/V5-ENaC were found in membrane fractions of chymotrypsin-treated oocytes, indicating no further subunit cleavage at the cell surface. However, examination of γHA/V5-ENaC cleavage stages revealed further processing of this subunit at the cell surface, which depended on its co-expression with α- or δ-ENaC. Whereas ΔIami mediated by αβγHA/V5-ENaC was increased in oocytes treated with chymotrypsin, activity of δβγHA/V5-ENaC was unaffected by the protease (Fig. 7c). Immunoblots of either α- or δ-ENaC–containing channels revealed two signals in cytosolic fractions that represent uncleaved (∼100-kDa) and cleaved (∼75-kDa) γHA/V5-ENaC peptides (Fig. 7d). Only one signal was present in the membrane fraction of these cells (∼75 kDa), indicating the absence of uncleaved γHA/V5-ENaC subunits at the cell surface. An additional cleavage product (∼70 kDa) appeared in the membrane fraction of αβγHA/V5-ENaC–expressing oocytes after incubation with chymotrypsin. However, chymotrypsin did not induce an additional cleavage product in membrane fractions of cells expressing δβγHA/V5-ENaC. The secondary cut of γHA/V5-ENaC by chymotrypsin is prevented in the presence of the δ-subunit, which probably contributes to the insensitivity of δβγ-ENaC to extracellular proteases. These data indicate that the presence of the δ-subunit prevents cleavage of the γ-subunit at the cell surface and activation by extracellular proteases. This study revealed that the presence of the δ-subunit changes properties of transmembrane currents generated by X. laevis ENaC. In contrast to the rather stable currents mediated by αβγ-ENaC, channels containing the δ-subunit mediated larger currents that had a more transient nature. These observations are consistent with findings from a previous study and can be attributed to differences in the speed of ENaC sodium self-inhibition (SSI) (14"

However, sustained expression of the TFs often hinders pluripotent stem cell (PSC) differentiation into specific cell types, as each TF exerts its effect on PSCs for a defined period of time during differentiation. Here, we applied a bacterial type III secretion system (T3SS)-based protein delivery tool to directly translocate TFs in the form of protein into human PSCs. This transient protein delivery technique showed high delivery efficiency for hPSCs, and it avoids potential genetic alterations caused by the introduction of transgenes. In an established cardiomyocyte de novo differentiation procedure, five transcriptional factors, namely GATA4, MEF2C, TBX5, ESRRG and MESP1 (abbreviated as GMTEM), were translocated at various time points. By detecting the expression of cardiac marker genes (Nkx2.5 and cTnT), we found that GMTEM proteins delivered on mesoderm stage of the cardiomyocytes lineage differentiation significantly enhanced both the human ESC and iPSC differentiation into cardiomyocytes, while earlier or later delivery diminished the enhancing effect. Furthermore, all of the five factors were required to enhance the cardiac differentiation. This work provides a virus-free strategy of transient transcription factors delivery for directing human stem cell fate without jeopardizing genome integrity, thus safe for biomedical applications."

Phosphorylation of EZH2 augmented EZH2 oncogenic activity in cancer but observations have been limited to threonine 350 (T350) and serine 21 (S21) residues by cyclin-dependent kinase 1 and protein kinase B, respectively. In addition, phosphorylation of the evolutionarily conserved T372 motif of EZH2 by p38 resulted in EZH2 interaction with Ying Yang 1 and promoted muscle stem cell differentiation. In the present study, we used epithelial ovarian cancer (OC) cells as a model to demonstrate that phosphorylation of EZH2 at T372 by protein kinase A (PKA) induced a dominant-negative EZH2 phenotype, inhibited OC cell proliferation and migration in vitro and decreased ovarian xenograft tumor growth in vivo. Phosphorylation of T372 by PKA enhanced the interaction between EZH2 and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), and STAT3 binding to pT372-EZH2 reduced cellular levels of pSTAT3 and downregulated interleukin 6 receptor expression in OC. Furthermore, PKA-mediated pT372-EZH2 decreased ATP levels and altered mitochondrial gene expression, resulting in mitochondrial dysfunction and reduced OC cell growth. These findings demonstrate that PKA-mediated T372 phosphorylation reduces oncogenic EZH2 activity and reveal a novel role for pT372 in regulating EZH2 in OC and possibly other cancers."
https://openalex.org/W2952385607,"Protein superfamilies can be divided into subfamilies of proteins with different functional characteristics. Their sequences can be classified hierarchically, which is part of sequence function assignation. Typically, there are no clear subfamily hallmarks that would allow pattern-based function assignation by which this task is mostly achieved based on the similarity principle. This is hampered by the lack of a score cut-off that is both sensitive and specific.HMMER Cut-off Threshold Tool (HMMERCTTER) adds a reliable cut-off threshold to the popular HMMER. Using a high quality superfamily phylogeny, it clusters a set of training sequences such that the cluster-specific HMMER profiles show cluster or subfamily member detection with 100% precision and recall (P&R), thereby generating a specific threshold as inclusion cut-off. Profiles and thresholds are then used as classifiers to screen a target dataset. Iterative inclusion of novel sequences to groups and the corresponding HMMER profiles results in high sensitivity while specificity is maintained by imposing 100% P&R self detection. In three presented case studies of protein superfamilies, classification of large datasets with 100% precision was achieved with over 95% recall. Limits and caveats are presented and explained.HMMERCTTER is a promising protein superfamily sequence classifier provided high quality training datasets are used. It provides a decision support system that aids in the difficult task of sequence function assignation in the twilight zone of sequence similarity.

After hearing onset, the strength and subcellular location of these inhibitory inputs are dramatically altered, but the cellular processes underlying this experience-dependent refinement are unknown. Here we reveal a form of inhibitory long-term potentiation (iLTP) in MSO neurons that is dependent on spiking and synaptic activation but is not affected by their fine-scale relative timing at higher frequencies prevalent in auditory circuits. We find that iLTP reinforces inhibitory inputs coactive with binaural excitation in a cumulative manner, likely well suited for networks featuring persistent high-frequency activity. We also show that a steep drop in action potential size and backpropagation limits induction of iLTP to the first 2 weeks of hearing. These intrinsic changes would deprive more distal inhibitory synapses of reinforcement, conceivably establishing the mature, soma-biased pattern of inhibition.

These intrinsic changes would deprive more distal inhibitory synapses of reinforcement, conceivably establishing the mature, soma-biased pattern of inhibition. The relative timing between synaptic inputs and action potential (AP) firing often controls the magnitude and direction of synaptic plasticity. Invasion of the dendrites by distally propagating APs (backpropagating action potentials, or BPAPs) can trigger local calcium influx and long-term plasticity at excitatory and inhibitory synapses that were active just prior to the spike, a process termed spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP). STDP thus communicates the output state of the neuron to the synapse. For both excitatory and inhibitory synapses, spike timing-based learning rules rest on the assumption that the frequency of synaptic inputs is relatively low, imparting an unambiguous phase relationship between BPAPs, ongoing synaptic input, and the signal transduction cascades employed. Indeed, at cortical and hippocampal levels, where STDP is well established (Feldman, 2012Feldman D.E.

What then are the rules that govern synaptic plasticity in the many neuron types in the brain that code information at much shorter timescales? We examine this question at inhibitory synapses onto neurons of the medial superior olive (MSO), which enable horizontal sound localization by detecting microsecond differences in the arrival of sounds at the two ears (Goldberg and Brown, 1969Goldberg J.M.

Inhibitory synaptic inputs to MSO neurons undergo dramatic synaptic and structural refinements during auditory development. Prior to hearing onset, around postnatal day 12 (P12) in gerbils (McFadden et al., 1996McFadden S.L. Walsh E.J. McGee J.

Neurobiol. 2008; 68: 1454-1462Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The segregation of inhibition to the soma is experience dependent and is disrupted by deafening and noise rearing (Kapfer et al., 2002Kapfer C. Seidl A.H. Schweizer H. Grothe B.

Experience-dependent refinement of the inhibitory axons projecting to the medial superior olive.Dev. Neurobiol. 2008; 68: 1454-1462Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), but the rules underlying such striking synaptic and structural changes are not understood. Here we describe a form of inhibitory long-term potentiation (iLTP) at glycinergic synapses onto MSO neurons, from Mongolian gerbils, that functions at higher frequencies common in the auditory system and depends on the number and frequency of coactivations of inhibitory and excitatory inputs with APs, but in contrast to STDP is largely insensitive to their relative phase at these higher frequencies. This plasticity depends on postsynaptic N-methyl D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) activation and calcium entry. We also find that the developmental reduction of the amplitude of BPAPs in the soma and dendrites over the first 2 weeks of hearing imposes a discrete developmental window for iLTP. These results reveal an intriguing interplay between the development of intrinsic membrane and voltage-gated ion channels properties and synaptic refinement in the MSO. To understand how the emergence of sound-driven activity just after the onset of hearing affects the strength of inhibitory synapses in MSO neurons, we made whole-cell current-clamp recordings from MSO neurons in slices of gerbil brainstem (P12–P15, average P13.5), maintained the cells at –60 mV, and alternately activated ipsilateral and contralateral IPSPs that were isolated from fast excitation by bath applying 15 μM NBQX or in some cases CNQX to block amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4 isoxazole propionic acid receptors (AMPARs, Figure 1A). Slower excitatory responses mediated by NMDARs were left unblocked, but when occasionally visible in younger animals were too slow to affect the peaks of IPSPs. After establishing a stable 10-min baseline at 0.1 Hz, we delivered a plasticity induction protocol consisting of trains of co-activated ipsilateral and contralateral synaptic stimulation with APs elicited by brief current pulses (100 stimuli at 200 Hz, repeated 10 times at an interval of 10 s, Figures 1A and 1B). This protocol is consistent with the high-frequency firing rates observed in excitatory inputs to the MSO from spherical bushy cells in the cochlear nucleus (Dehmel et al., 2010Dehmel S.

Separately evoked ipsilateral and contralateral IPSPs were then monitored again at 0.1 Hz for at least 34 min following the end of the induction protocol. There was no difference in iLTP magnitude between ipsilateral inputs from the LNTB and contralateral inputs from the MNTB averaged between 24 and 34 min after the induction stimulus (Figures 1B and 1C: Ipsi, 1.54 ± 0.16, n = 9; Contra, 1.39 ± 0.09, n = 13; p = 0.388). Thus, the results for these independent sets of inputs, often measured in the same MSO neurons, were pooled for all experiments. The induction protocol increased IPSP amplitude by 45%, whereas omission of both induction stimuli resulted in no increase (Figures 1D and 1F: induction, 1.45 ± 0.08, n = 22, 11 gerbils; no induction, 1.07 ± 0.05, n = 8, 4 gerbils; p = 0.012). The average baseline IPSP amplitude was −4.09 ± 0.48 mV and there was no effect of IPSP amplitude on iLTP magnitude (Figure S2). Such stimuli activated substantial populations of excitatory inputs: in separate experiments, stimulation intensities that elicited IPSPs comparable to those in iLTP experiments consistently recruited suprathreshold excitation upon washout of AMPA receptor blockade. The stimulation threshold for excitatory fiber recruitment was an order of magnitude lower than that for inhibition (Figure S3). Neither APs nor electrical stimulation alone was sufficient to induce iLTP, indicating that cooperativity between synaptic input and AP firing was required for this form of plasticity (Figures 1E and 1F: AP only, 0.91 ± 0.08, n = 11, 3 gerbils, p = 0.0002 versus induction, p = 0.128 versus no induction; stim only, 1.04 ± 0.06, n = 10, 4 gerbils, p = 0.003 versus induction, p = 0.670 versus no induction). In these experiments, there was no clear dependence of iLTP on the phase of IPSPs with respect to AP timing (Figures 2A–2C). Variations in the peaks of IPSPs and APs during the induction protocol, no matter whether induced explicitly by the experimenter or due to natural differences in synaptic delay, IPSP kinetics, and membrane time constants led to a range of relative phases of the paired stimuli. We found that iLTP was insensitive to the relative timing of the peak of the IPSP, measured in the absence of the AP, and the peak of the AP during the induction protocol (Figure 2C). There were no significant differences between experiments separated into coincident and anti-coincident groups consisting of IPSP-AP timing differences of –1.25 to 1.25 and >1.25 and <−1.25, respectively (Figures 2C and 2F: coincident pairing, 1.46 ± 0.12, n = 13; anti-coincident pairing, 1.44 ± 0.11, n = 9; p = 0.872). While iLTP induction appeared insensitive to the temporal fine structure of induction stimuli at such high frequencies, it did depend on the total number of pairings. Reducing the number of pairings in each induction train from 100 to 20 significantly reduced the effectiveness of iLTP induction protocols (Figures 2D and 2F: 1.18 ± 0.07, n = 14, 5 gerbils, p = 0.029 versus induction, p = 0.321 versus no induction). However, if the number of train repetitions was increased to provide the same 1,000 pairings as our standard iLTP protocol (in shorter bursts) the effectiveness was largely recovered (Figures 2E and 2F: 1.38 ± 0.07, n = 10, 6 gerbils, p = 0.605 versus induction, p = 0.005 versus no induction). Thus, iLTP depends on the number of coincident IPSPs and APs, but not their precise relative timing. Additionally, initial experiments showed that iLTP induction was also rate dependent. Similar paired induction protocols at a lower frequency of 100 Hz were only effective at inducing iLTP in low Mg2+ artificial cerebral spinal fluid (ACSF, 0.5 mM, Figures S4A–S4C). Together these data suggest a cumulative mechanism based on consistent co-activation. The involvement of NMDARs was also indicated by Mg2+ dependence and the plasticity was blocked by the NMDAR antagonist AP-V (Figures S4A and S4C). Switching to bath application of the use-dependent NMDAR antagonist MK-801 (30 μM), which does not allosterically modulate glycine receptors (GlyRs) as AP-V does (Liu et al., 2010Liu J. Wu D.C. Wang Y.T. Allosteric potentiation of glycine receptor chloride currents by glutamate.Nat. Neurosci. 2010; 13: 1225-1232Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), we found that induction of iLTP in our 200 Hz, standard calcium (1.5 mM) conditions was indeed NMDAR dependent (Figures 3A and 3C : 1.14 ± 0.04, n = 16, 7 gerbils, p = 0.004 versus induction, p = 0.327 versus no induction). To determine the locus of NMDAR activation, we loaded the recording pipettes with internal solution containing either MK-801 (1 mM) or the calcium chelator BAPTA (15.9 mM) and found that iLTP was disrupted in both cases (Figures 3A–3C: MK-801 pipette, 1.17 ± 0.06, n = 10, 5 gerbils, p = 0.040 versus induction, p = 0.223 versus no induction; BAPTA, 1.01 ± 0.04, n = 8, 3 gerbils, p = 0.004 versus induction, p = 0.337 versus no induction). Consistent with a postsynaptic mechanism, neither the coefficient of variance (CV; Figure 3D: baseline 0.291 ± 0.023, end 0.271 ± 0.023, n = 22, p = 0.213, paired t test) nor the paired-pulse ratio (PPR; Figure 3E: 2nd/1st, 30 ms interval, baseline 0.985 ± 0.007, end 0.988 ± 0.038, n = 22, p = 0.936, paired t test) of the potentiated IPSPs were altered by iLTP. Together, these data indicate that calcium influx through postsynaptic NMDARs is a critical mechanism underlying iLTP. In an effort to discover the source of glutamate for NMDAR activation, we investigated the possibility of co-release of glutamate with glycine by MNTB and LNTB neurons as has been observed with MNTB inputs to the lateral superior olive (LSO) (Gillespie et al., 2005Gillespie D.C. Kim G. Kandler K. Inhibitory synapses in the developing auditory system are glutamatergic.Nat. Neurosci. 2005; 8: 332-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, Kim and Kandler, 2010Kim G.

Seal R.P. Garver J.A. Edwards R.H. Kandler K. Glutamate co-release at GABA/glycinergic synapses is crucial for the refinement of an inhibitory map.Nat. Neurosci. 2010; 13: 232-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). To test this possibility, we made whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings from MSO principal neurons, and then used progressively smaller focal applications of glutamate (10 mM) to identify, closely approach, and then electrically stimulate connected inhibitory neurons within either the MNTB or LNTB (Figure 4A, see STAR Methods). The peak amplitudes of the responses were variable and ranged from 146 to 684 pA from the MNTB and 222 to 4,207 pA from the LNTB at –60 mV (Roberts et al., 2014Roberts M.T. Seeman S.C. Golding N.L. The relative contributions of MNTB and LNTB neurons to inhibition in the medial superior olive assessed through single and paired recordings.Front. Neural Circuits. 2014; 8: 49Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Once stable responses were recorded at –60 and +35 mV, inhibitory currents were blocked with co-application of glycinergic and GABAA-ergic inhibitory synaptic blockers (Figure 4B; 1 μM strychnine and 5 μM gabazine, respectively; STR and GZ). This would often reveal an unblocked excitatory fiber of passage (∼65% of trials) with a fast AMPA mediated current and these trials were discarded. Trials in which all fast transmission were blocked were considered inhibitory-only connections. In these cases, we did not observe any remaining slower NMDAR-mediated currents when stepped to +35 mV to relieve the NMDAR Mg2+ block (Figures 4B–4D). In some cases, the stimulation amplitude was subsequently increased to deliberately recruit nearby excitatory fibers of passage (data not shown). These responses exhibited clear AMPA and NMDA components (peak amplitude at –60 mV; –682.44 ± 178.19 pA; at +35 mV, 578.28 ± 208.75 pA, n = 4 each), demonstrating that NMDAR currents would have been detected using our methods, were they present. iLTP required both AP generation and NMDAR activation. This indicates that APs are sufficiently large to relieve the Mg2+ block on NMDARs. However, there is a rapid developmental decrease in spike amplitude and dendritic backpropagation of APs in MSO neurons in the 2 weeks following hearing onset (Scott et al., 2005Scott L.L. Mathews P.J. Golding N.L. Posthearing developmental refinement of temporal processing in principal neurons of the medial superior olive.J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 7887-7895Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, Scott et al., 2007Scott L.L. Hage T.A. Golding N.L. Weak action potential backpropagation is associated with high-frequency axonal firing capability in principal neurons of the gerbil medial superior olive.J. Physiol. 2007; 583: 647-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Therefore, we measured BPAPs in MSO neurons just before hearing onset to gauge the full extent of the changes in active and passive membrane properties that occur with hearing. To do this, we made paired dendritic and somatic current-clamp recording from MSO neurons at P9–P11 (P10 average), measured the absolute and relative amplitude of BPAPs and compared these measurements to data obtained at P16–P19 (Figure 5A). Before hearing onset, APs had peak voltages at the soma that were relatively large and narrow (Figures 5A–5C: amplitude, 15.13 ± 1.77 mV, n = 11, 8 gerbils; half-width, 0.39 ± 0.03 ms), and backpropagated effectively into the dendrites with a length constant (λ) of 200 μm (Figure 5D). Just a week later (P16–P19), however, APs exhibit greatly reduced peak voltages (Figures 5A–5C: –19.41 ± 3.06 mV, n = 20, 18 gerbils, p < 0.0001), brief duration (0.24 ± 0.01 ms half-width, n = 15, p < 0.0001), and are heavily attenuated upon backpropagation into the dendrites (Figures 5B and 5D, λ = 77 μm). These data indicate that the amount of depolarization provided by APs in MSO neurons at the soma and especially in the dendrites decreases dramatically after hearing onset. In light of these findings, we hypothesized that iLTP may be developmentally limited by the reduced ability of APs to relieve the Mg2+ block on NMDARs. To test this, we performed iLTP induction in gerbils at age P18–P20 (P19 average) and found that iLTP was reduced by more than 50% (Figures 6A and 6B : 1.21 ± 0.10, n = 11, 6 gerbils, p = 0.086 versus induction, p = 0.322 versus no induction). Moreover, in older gerbils (P27–P32, P30 average), we found that iLTP was completely eliminated (Figures 6A and 6B: 0.99 ± 0.07, n = 10, 7 gerbils, p = 0.002 versus induction, p = 0.401 versus no induction). When we examined the magnitude of iLTP relative to the peak amplitude of the APs in the induction trains, which would differ from rheobase amplitudes for all ages tested (Figure 6C), we found that the younger animals were clustered at the largest AP amplitudes and more consistently showed iLTP. With the intermediate and older ages, there was a range of AP amplitudes, those with larger ones tending to exhibit iLTP. However, the points were scattered and there were not enough of them to correlate the two parameters well. In order to determine whether the depolarization provided by the AP is a critical element for the developmental time course of iLTP, we made whole-cell recordings from ∼P30 MSO neurons with K-gluconate-based internal solutions and paired trains of inhibitory input stimulation with the AP substituted with larger depolarization imposed by voltage-clamp commands (Figure 7A; 2.5 ms voltage-clamp steps to 0 mV). Because of the large voltage-gated currents and necessity of omitting channel blockers, voltage clamp was imperfect at these ages. However, using dual somatic current-clamp/voltage-clamp recordings, we found that 2.5 ms voltage commands from –60 to 0 mV nevertheless substantially increased both the peak amplitude (–16.89 ± 2.66 mV versus –33.96 ± 3.81 mV, n = 4, p = 0.010, paired t test, P29 average) and duration (∼2.5 ms versus AP half-width 0.21 ± 0.02 ms, n = 4) of the depolarization beyond natural APs (Figures 7A and 7B). In separate recordings with a single electrode, we delivered iLTP protocols in slices from gerbils P28–P32 (P29.5 average), as in Figure 1A, but replaced the APs with larger depolarizations induced with voltage steps nominally to 0 mV (Figure 7C). This manipulation restored iLTP in older animals (Figures 7D and 7F: V-clamp induction, 1.57 ± 0.14, n = 11, 6 gerbils; voltage step only, 1.10 ± 0.08, n = 8, 3 gerbils, p = 0.017 versus no stim, p = 0.453 versus P12–P15 induction) but was blocked by bath application of MK-801 (30 μM, Figures 7E and 7F: 1.07 ± 0.06, n = 10, 6 gerbils, p = 0.004 versus V-clamp induct"
https://openalex.org/W2789580118,"17β-estradiol treatment has shown benefit against schizophrenia symptoms, however long-term use may be associated with negative side-effects. Selective estrogen receptor modulators, such as raloxifene and tamoxifen, have been proposed as suitable alternatives to 17β-estradiol. An isomer of 17β-estradiol, 17α-estradiol, is considered less carcinogenic, and non-feminising in males, however little is known about its potential as a treatment for schizophrenia. Moreover, the mechanism underlying the therapeutic action of estrogens remains unclear. We aimed to investigate the ability of these estrogenic compounds to attenuate psychosis-like behaviour in rats. We used two acute pharmacologically-induced assays of psychosis-like behaviour: psychotomimetic drug-induced hyperlocomotion and disruption of prepulse inhibition (PPI). Female Long Evans rats were either intact, ovariectomised (OVX), or OVX and chronically treated with 17β-estradiol, 17α-estradiol, raloxifene or tamoxifen. Only 17β-estradiol treatment attenuated locomotor hyperactivity induced by the indirect dopamine receptor agonist, methamphetamine. 17β-estradiol- and tamoxifen-treated rats showed attenuated methamphetamine- and apomorphine (dopamine D1/D2 receptor agonist)-induced disruption of PPI. Raloxifene-treated rats showed attenuated apomorphine-induced PPI disruption only. Baseline PPI was significantly reduced following OVX, and this deficit was reversed by all estrogenic compounds. Further, PPI in OVX rats was increased following administration of apomorphine. This study confirms a protective effect of 17β-estradiol in two established animal models of psychosis, while tamoxifen showed beneficial effects against PPI disruption. In contrast, 17α-estradiol and raloxifene showed little effect on dopamine receptor-mediated psychosis-like behaviours. This study highlights the utility of some estrogenic compounds to attenuate psychosis-like behaviour in rats, supporting the notion that estrogens have therapeutic potential for psychotic disorders."

Investigations on immune responses during KD are hampered by a limited understanding of normal immune responses in these ages. It's well known that Infants have poorer vaccine responses and difficulty with maintaining prolonged serum immunity, but there are few studies on human infants detailing immune deficiencies. Limited studies propose an inability to maintain life-long bone marrow plasma cells. Plasmablasts are a transitional cell form of B cells that lead to long-term Plasma cells. Plasmablasts levels rise in the peripheral blood after exposure to a foreign antigen. In adult studies, these responses are both temporally and functionally well characterized. To date, there have been few studies on plasmablasts in the predominant age range of KD.Children presenting to an urban pediatric emergency room undergoing laboratory evaluation, who had concern of KD or had fever and symptoms overlapping those of KD, were recruited. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated and evaluated utilizing flow cytometry with specific B cell markers from 18 KD subjects and 69 febrile controls.Plasmablast numbers and temporal formation are similar between infectious disease controls and KD subjects. In both groups, infants have diminished plasmablast responses compared to older children.In this single-time point survey, infants have a blunted peripheral plasmablast response. Overall, similar plasmablast responses in KD and controls support an infectious disease relationship to KD. Future time-course studies of plasmablasts in infants are warranted as this phenomenon may contribute to observed immune responses in this age group."
https://openalex.org/W2793868426,"Aloe vera (L.) Burm.f. is a highly important and extensively cultivated medicinal plant and that is also extensively used in the cosmetic industry. It has been frequently reported to suffer from Alternaria leaf spot disease in various parts of the world. Various fungicides used to combat this disease, have deleterious effects on the environment and on pharmacologically important constituents of Aloe vera. To avoid the harmful effects of fungicides an ecofriendly approach has been adopted here. A weekly survey was conducted during 2013-2015 in and around North 24 Parganas (West Bengal) to obtain the percentage of disease index (PDI). For biological control of the disease, screening of the antagonistic efficacy of biocontrol agents was carried out through the in vitro dual-culture-plate method and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to study the mechanism. The in vitro effects of fungicides on the radial growth of the pathogen were evaluated through the poison food method and were compared with potent antagonistic fungi. Field application of potent antagonistic fungi was conducted through the dip-and-spray method. The results showed that, the PDI peaked during the hot and humid conditions of May to September (76.57%-98.57%) but decreased during the winter, December-January (35.71-46.66%). Trichoderma asperellum exerted the greatest inhibition of the radial growth of A. brassicae acting through non volatile (70.39%) and volatile metabolites (72.17%). A SEM study confirmed the hyperparasitic nature of T. asperellum through hyphal coiling-T. asperellum was similar to 2% blitox-50 (73.92%) and better than 2% bavistin (59.77%) (in vitro). In agricultural field trials (2013-15), Trichoderma application restricted the disease to the smallest area (PDI 24.00-29.33%) in comparison to untreated plots (73.33%). In conclusion, saplings treated with the dip method (108 spores / mL) and sprayed 4 times with a spore suspension of biocontrol agents such as T. asperellum, T. viride and T. harzianum, standardized at a rate of 2.5 L / plot (36 sq ft) (108 spores/ mL) are suggested for the ecofriendly management of this epidemic leaf spot disease of Aloe vera in agricultural fields."

Even though obesity prevalence and subsequent health expenditure are increasing worldwide, there is scarce literature about their specific resource utilization of Emergency Departments (ED). These few studies do not take into account both socio-economic situation and comorbidities which are well-known factors influencing healthcare use. Our objective was to assess the emergency care resource utilization of obese individuals (Body Mass Index (BMI) ≥ 30kg.m-2) compared to normal-weight individuals taking into account comorbidities and social-economic situations.The French CONSTANCES epidemiologic cohort is a randomly selected sample of French adults. Participants data are linked to the National Health Insurance Database collecting all medical acts. The rate of ED visits of obese (and each obesity class) and normal-weight participants were compared considering confounding factors (comorbidities, various socio-economic data). The primary endpoint was to have visited the ED between 2010 and 2013. Sex-separated analysis and multivariate logistic regression models were performed and adjusted odds-ratios [OR] (95% Confidence Intervals [CI]) were calculated.We included 21,035 normal-weight and 5,003 obese participants. Obese participants visited the ED more often than normal-weight participants (men: 30.5% vs. 26.7%; women: 30.3% vs. 24.4%, P<0.001). Obese participants presented more comorbidities and a lower socio-economic situation than normal-weight participants. After adjustment, obese participants had a higher risk of visiting ED (men: OR = 1.18; 95% CI: 1.04-1.33; and women: OR = 1.36; 95% CI: 1.22-1.52), with a higher risk for class III participants (BMI ≥ 40 kg.m-2) (men: OR = 2.18; CI 95%: 1.32-3.63; and women: OR = 1.85; 95% CI: 1.38-2.49).Obese individuals have a higher level of emergency care resource utilization than normal-weight individuals and it increases with severe obesity.

https://openalex.org/W2791458002,"Activity-dependent changes in the properties of the motor system underlie the necessary adjustments in its responsiveness on the basis of the environmental and developmental demands of the organism. Although plastic changes in the properties of the spinal cord have historically been neglected because of the archaic belief that the spinal cord is constituted by a hardwired network that simply relays information to muscles, plenty of evidence has been accumulated showing that synapses impinging on spinal motoneurons undergo short- and long-term plasticity. In the brain, brief changes in the activity level of the network have been shown to be paralleled by changes in the intrinsic excitability of the neurons and are suggested to either reinforce or stabilize the changes at the synaptic level. However, rapid activity-dependent changes in the intrinsic properties of spinal motoneurons have never been reported. In this study, we show that in neonatal mice the intrinsic excitability of spinal motoneurons is depressed after relatively brief but sustained changes in the spinal cord network activity. Using electrophysiological techniques together with specific pharmacological blockers of KCNQ/Kv7 channels, we demonstrate their involvement in the reduction of the intrinsic excitability of spinal motoneurons. This action results from an increased M-current, the product of the activation of KCNQ/Kv7 channels, which leads to a hyperpolarization of the resting membrane potential and a decrease in the input resistance of spinal motoneurons. Computer simulations showed that specific up-regulations in KCNQ/Kv7 channels functions lead to a modulation of the intrinsic excitability of spinal motoneurons as observed experimentally. These results indicate that KCNQ/Kv7 channels play a fundamental role in the activity-dependent modulation of the excitability of spinal motoneurons."
https://openalex.org/W2790970252,"Lectins that target N-glycans on the surface of HIV-1 envelope (Env) glycoprotein have the potential for use as antiviral agents. Although progress has been made in deciphering the molecular details of lectin and Env glycan interaction, further studies are needed to better understand Env glycan heterogeneity among HIV-1 isolates and its influence on virus-neutralization sensitivity to lectins. This study evaluated a panel of lectins with fine specificity for distinct oligosaccharides and assessed their ability to inhibit infection of HIV-1 viruses known to have differing sensitivity to anti-HIV Env antibodies. The results showed that HIV-1 isolates have different sensitivity to lectins specific for α1-3Man, α1-6Man, and α1-2Man binding lectins. Considering that lectins exclusively recognize the oligosaccharide components of virus Env, these data suggest that glycan heterogeneity among HIV-1 isolates may explain this differential sensitivity. To evaluate this further, chronic and acute viruses were produced in the presence of different glycosidase inhibitors to express more homogenous glycans. Viruses enriched for α1-2Man terminating Man5-9GlcNAc2 glycans became similarly sensitive to α1-2Man-binding lectins. The α1-3Man- and α1-6Man-binding lectins also were more potent against viruses expressing predominantly Man5GlcNAc2 and hybrid type glycans with terminal α1-3Man and α1-6Man. Furthermore, lectin-mediated inhibition was competitively alleviated by mannan and this effect was augmented by enrichment of mannose-type glycans on the virus. In addition, while Env of viruses enriched with mannose-type glycans were sensitive to Endo-H deglycosylation, Env of untreated viruses were partially resistant, indicating that HIV-1 Env glycans are heterogeneously comprised of complex, hybrid, and mannose types. Overall, our data demonstrate that HIV-1 isolates display differential sensitivity to lectins, in part due to the microheterogeneity of N-linked glycans expressed on the surface of the virus Env glycoprotein."
https://openalex.org/W2791847701,"Most of earth’s biodiversity is comprised of interactions among species, yet it is unclear what causes variation in interaction diversity across space and time. We define interaction diversity as the richness and relative abundance of interactions linking species together at scales from localized, measurable webs to entire ecosystems. Large-scale patterns suggest that two basic components of interaction diversity differ substantially and predictably between different ecosystems: overall taxonomic diversity and host specificity of consumers. Understanding how these factors influence interaction diversity, and quantifying the causes and effects of variation in interaction diversity are important goals for community ecology. While previous studies have examined the effects of sampling bias and consumer specialization on determining patterns of ecological networks, these studies were restricted to two trophic levels and did not incorporate realistic variation in species diversity and consumer diet breadth. Here, we developed a food web model to generate tri-trophic ecological networks, and evaluated specific hypotheses about how the diversity of trophic interactions and species diversity are related under different scenarios of species richness, taxonomic abundance, and consumer diet breadth. We investigated the accumulation of species and interactions and found that interactions accumulate more quickly; thus, the accumulation of novel interactions may require less sampling effort than sampling species in order to get reliable estimates of either type of diversity. Mean consumer diet breadth influenced the correlation between species and interaction diversity significantly more than variation in both species richness and taxonomic abundance. However, this effect of diet breadth on interaction diversity is conditional on the number of observed interactions included in the models. The results presented here will help develop realistic predictions of the relationships between consumer diet breadth, interaction diversity, and species diversity within multi-trophic communities, which is critical for the conservation of biodiversity in this period of accelerated global change."
https://openalex.org/W2793024350,"We examined the fecal microbiota of female prairie voles. This species is socially and, likely, sexually monogamous, and thus serves as a valuable model in which to examine the interaction between the microbiota-gut-brain axis and social behavior. At present, little is known about the gastrointestinal microbiota of prairie voles; therefore, we performed a first characterization of the fecal microbiota using 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. Semiconductor sequencing technology on an Ion Torrent PGM platform was used to assess the composition of fecal microbiotas from twelve female prairie voles. Following quality filtering, 1,017,756 sequencing reads were classified from phylum to genus level. At the phylum level, Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, and Saccharibacteria were the predominant taxa, while the Bacteriodales, Erysipelotrichaceae, Ruminococcaceae, and Lachnospiraceae contributed the most dominant microbial groups and genera. Microbial community membership was most similar between vole sibling pairs, but consideration of taxon abundances weakened these associations. The interdependence of host factors such as genetics and behavior with the gastrointestinal microbiota is likely to be particularly pronounced in prairie voles. Our pilot characterization of the prairie vole intestinal microbiota revealed a microbial community composition remarkably consistent with the monogastric alimentary system of these rodents and their diet rich in complex plant carbohydrates. The highly social nature of these animals poses specific challenges to microbiome analyses that nonetheless are valuable for advancing research on the microbiota-gut-brain-behavior axis. Our study provides an important basis for future microbiome research in this emerging model organism for studying social behavior."
https://openalex.org/W2794342496,"Pre-eclampsia is associated with altered maternal and placental vascular reactivity. Kv7 channels (encoded by KCNQ 1–5 genes) are a potential contributor to the regulation of vascular tone in CPAs (chorionic plate arteries) during normal pregnancy. The aim of this study is to establish the expression profile of KCNQ subunits in CPAs taken from women with preeclampsia or normotensive women and to examine the functional relevance of the Kv7 channels on an altered expression profile of KCNQ subunits. The effects of Kv7 channel modulators on CPAs were investigated by tension measurement. Quantitative PCR experiments were used to analyze the expression of KCNQ genes. Western blotting and immunofluorescence were both used to analyze the protein expression of Kv7 channels. Finally, in CPAs from normotensive women, the Kv7 channel blocker XE991 increased arterial basal tone and U46619-induced contraction, and pre-contracted CPAs (10−7 M U46619) exhibited significant relaxation following treatment with Retigabine(Kv7.2–7.5 activator) and BMS-204352(Kv7.2–7.5 activator). However, ICA-27243(selective KCNQ2 and KCNQ3 activator) and ML277(selective KV7.1 activator) had no significant effect on tension in the pre-contracted CPAs. Conversely, compared with CPAs from normotensive women, the effects of XE991 on basal tone and agonist (U46619)-induced contractions in CPAs from women with preeclampsia were markedly attenuated. Moreover, the relaxation effects of Retigabine and BMS-204352 on pre-contracted CPA vessels from women with pre-eclampsia were also markedly down-regulated. Interestingly, the relaxation ability of ICA-27243 in pre-contracted CPA vessels in women with pre-eclampsia was enhanced. The mRNA of KCNQ3 was specifically up-regulated, whereas those for KCNQ4 and KCNQ5 were down-regulated in CPAs from women with pre-eclampsia compared with those in normotensive women. Similar observations were found in a subsequent analysis of protein expression of KCNQ genes 3–5. Thus, down-regulated Kv7 channel function in tension regulation of CPAs in women with pre-eclampsia could be associated with considerably altered expression profiles of Kv7 subunits."
https://openalex.org/W2790526688,"The present study examined the effects of cognitive impairment and functional limitation on depressive symptoms among older Korean American immigrants. The sample was drawn from a cross-sectional survey of 210 older Korean immigrants (aged 65 years or older) in Los Angeles County. Based on robust hierarchical regression, the study found that cognitive ability and functional status were significant explanatory factors related to depressive symptoms among older Korean immigrants. In addition, the interaction of instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) and cognitive function (MMSE) had a significant effect on depressive symptoms. This finding suggests that older Korean immigrants in the U.S. who experience deficits in cognitive function and/or IADL performance are vulnerable to psychological distress as indicated by depressive symptoms. Recommendations include implementing culturally-responsive health interventions aimed at enabling accessibility to dementia care services and supporting improvement of IADL performance among older Korean American immigrants."
https://openalex.org/W2790787901,"Koalas (Phascolarctos cinereus) are iconic Australian marsupials currently threatened by several processes, including infectious diseases and ecological disruption. Infection with Chlamydia pecorum, is considered a key driver of population decline. The clinical sign of 'wet bottom', a staining of the rump associated with urinary incontinence, is often caused by chlamydial urinary tract infections. However, wet bottom has been recorded in koalas free of C. pecorum, suggesting other causative agents in those individuals. We used 16S rRNA diversity profiling to investigate the microbiome of the urogenital tract of ten female koalas in order to identify potential causative agents of wet bottom, other than C. pecorum. Five urogenital samples were processed from koalas presenting with wet bottom and five were clinically normal. All koalas were negative for C. pecorum infection. We detected thirteen phyla across the ten samples, with Firmicutes occurring at the highest relative abundance (77.6%). The order Lactobacillales, within the Firmicutes, comprised 70.3% of the reads from all samples. After normalising reads using DESeq2 and testing for significant differences (P < 0.05), there were 25 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) more commonly found in one group over the other. The families Aerococcaceae and Tissierellaceae both had four significantly differentially abundant OTUs. These four Tissierellaceae OTUs were all significantly more abundant in koalas with wet bottom. This study provides the foundation for future investigations of causes of koala wet bottom, other than C. pecorum infection. This is of clinical relevance as wet bottom is often assumed to be caused by C. pecorum and treated accordingly. Our research highlights that other organisms may be causing wet bottom, and these potential aetiological agents need to be further investigated to fully address the problems this species faces."
https://openalex.org/W2793993593,"Measuring viral DNA methylation in human papillomavirus (HPV) infected women showed promise for accurate detection of high-grade cervical lesions and cancer. Methylation status has been widely investigated for HPV16, sporadically for other HPV types.Objective of this methodological study was to set up molecular methods to test the methylation levels in the twelve oncogenic HPV types by pyrosequencing, minimizing the number of HPV type-specific PCR protocols. Target CpGs were selected on the HPV L1 (two regions, L1 I and L1 II) and L2 genes. Study samples included DNA stored at Turin, Italy, purified by cervical cells collected in Standard Transport Medium or PreservCyt from women who participated in two studies (N = 126 and 140) nested within the regional organized screening programme. PCR consensus primers were designed by PyroMark Assay Design software to be suitable for amplification of many different oncogenic HPV types.Generation of consensus primers was successful for L1 I and II regions, unsuccessful for L2 region, for which HPV type-specific primers remained necessary. The difference between replicated tests on the same sample was ≤4% in 88%, 77% and 91% of cases when targeting the L1 I, L1 II and L2 regions, respectively. The corresponding intra-class correlation coefficients (ICC) were 0.94, 0.87 and 0.97 respectively. When comparing methylation measures based on consensus and type-specific primers, ICC was 0.97 for the L1 I region and 0.99 the for L1 II region.The proposed protocols, applying consensus primers suitable to amplify the oncogenic HPV types and minimize the number of PCR reactions, represent a promising tool to quantify viral methylation in women positive for any high risk HPV type.Potential application of these methylation protocols in screening settings can be explored to identify women with high probability of progression to high grade lesions."
https://openalex.org/W2792100977,"Background and aims Mesalamine is commonly used to treat ulcerative colitis (UC). Although mesalamine acts topically, in vitro data suggest that intracellular transport is required for its beneficial effect. Genetic variants in mucosal transport proteins may affect this uptake, but the clinical relevance of these variants has not been studied. The aim of this study was to determine whether variants in genes involved in cellular transport affect the response to mesalamine in UC. Methods Subjects with UC from a 6-week clinical trial using multiple doses of mesalamine were genotyped using a genome-wide array that included common exome variants. Analysis focused on cellular transport gene variants with a minor allele frequency >5%. Mesalamine response was defined as improvement in Week 6 Physician’s Global Assessment (PGA) and non-response as a lack of improvement in Week 6 PGA. Quality control thresholds included an individual genotyping rate of >90%, SNP genotyping rate of >98%, and exclusion for subjects with cryptic relatedness. All included variants met Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (p>0.001). Results 457 adults with UC were included with 280 responders and 177 non-responders. There were no common variants in transporter genes that were associated with response to mesalamine. The genetic risk score of responders was similar to that of non-responders (p = 0.18). Genome-wide variants demonstrating a trend towards mesalamine response included ST8SIA5 (p = 1x10-5). Conclusions Common transporter gene variants did not affect response to mesalamine in adult UC. The response to mesalamine may be due to rare genetic events or environmental factors such as the intestinal microbiome."
https://openalex.org/W2789603520,"Protein myristoylation is a key protein modification carried out by N-Myristoyltransferase (NMT) after Methionine aminopeptidase 2 (MetAP2) removes methionine from the amino-terminus of the target protein. Protein myristoylation by NMT augments several signaling pathways involved in a myriad of cellular processes, including developmental pathways and pathways that when dysregulated lead to cancer or immune dysfunction. The emerging evidence pointing to NMT-mediated myristoylation as a major cellular regulator underscores the importance of understanding the framework of this type of signaling event. Various studies have investigated the role that myristoylation plays in signaling dysfunction by examining differential gene or protein expression between normal and diseased states, such as cancers or following HIV-1 infection, however no study exists that addresses the role of microRNAs (miRNAs) in the regulation of myristoylation. By performing a large scale bioinformatics and functional analysis of the miRNAs that target key genes involved in myristoylation (NMT1, NMT2, MetAP2), we have narrowed down a list of promising candidates for further analysis. Our condensed panel of miRNAs identifies 35 miRNAs linked to cancer, 21 miRNAs linked to developmental and immune signaling pathways, and 14 miRNAs linked to infectious disease (primarily HIV). The miRNAs panel that was analyzed revealed several NMT-targeting mRNAs (messenger RNA) that are implicated in diseases associated with NMT signaling alteration, providing a link between the realms of miRNA and myristoylation signaling. These findings verify miRNA as an additional facet of myristoylation signaling that must be considered to gain a full perspective. This study provides the groundwork for future studies concerning NMT-transcript-binding miRNAs, and will potentially lead to the development of new diagnostic/prognostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets for several important diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2791597004,"The PrePex medical male circumcision (MMC) device is relatively easy to place and remove with some training. PrePex has been evaluated in several countries to assess feasibility and acceptability. However, several studies have reported pain associated with removal.To assess safety of PrePex and whether analgesia administered prior to removal reduces pain experienced by participants.A multi-site non-randomized, prospective cohort study in which adult (18-45 years old) males requesting PrePex device male circumcision, were enrolled in six South African clinics from July 2014 to March 2015. Participants were routinely provided with analgesia shortly after the surveillance commenced following a protocol review. Analgesia regimen for device removal depended on medication availability at clinics.Of 1023 enrolled participants who had PrePex placed, 98% (1004) had the device removed at a study clinic. Their median age was 25 (IQR: 21-30) years. HIV sero-positivity was 3.6% (37/1023). Nurses placed and removed half of all devices. Adverse events were experienced by 2.4% (25/1023) of participants; 15 required surgical intervention: device displacement (5/14), early removals (3/14), self-removals (5/14) and insufficient skin removed (2/14). Majority (792: 79%) of participants received analgesia. Most received either paracetamol-codeine (33%), lidocaine (29%) or EMLA and Oral Combination (28%). A lower proportion of participants who received any analgesia (except for lidocaine) prior to PrePex removal experienced severe pain compared to those who received no analgesia (16.6% vs. 29%: p = 0.0001).Reported adverse events during this PrePex active surveillance were similar to previous reports and to those of surgical circumcision. Pain medication provided prior to removal is effective at decreasing severe pain during PrePex device removal."
https://openalex.org/W2791346001,"Individuals often refer to opinions of others when they make decisions in the real world. Our question is how the people’s reference structure self-organizes when people try to provide correct answers by referring to more accurate agents. We constructed an adaptive network model, in which each node represents an agent and each directed link represents a reference. In every iteration round within our model, each agent makes a decision sequentially by following the majority of the reference partners’ opinions and rewires a reference link to a partner if the partner’s performance falls below a given threshold. The value of this threshold is common for all agents and represents the performance assessment severity of the population. We found that the reference network self-organizes into a heterogeneous one with a nearly exponential in-degree (the number of followers) distribution, where reference links concentrate around agents with high intrinsic ability. In this heterogeneous network, the decision-making accuracy of agents improved on average. However, the proportion of agents who provided correct answers showed strong temporal fluctuation compared to that observed in the case in which each agent refers to randomly selected agents. We also found a counterintuitive phenomenon in which reference links concentrate more around high-ability agents and the population became smarter on average when the rewiring threshold was set lower than when it was set higher."
https://openalex.org/W2793404174,"Chronic low back pain is a major healthcare burden that has wide ranging effects on the individual, their family, society and the workplace. However, appropriate management and treatment is often difficult, as a majority of cases are non-specific in terms of underlying pathology. As a result, there are extensive differences in both individual patient preferences for treatment and treatment decisions amongst general practitioners. The current study examined the clinical judgements of GPs in Ireland, regarding fictional patients' case severity and future risk of disability, through judgement analysis. Judgement analysis (JA) is an idiographic regression modelling technique that has been utilised in extant healthcare research for the purpose of allocating weighting to judgement criteria, or cues, observed by professionals in their clinical decision-making. The primary aim of the study was to model two critical information utilisation tasks performed by GPs with regard to CLBP-in combining information cues to form a judgement about current case severity and a judgement about the same patient's risk of future disability. It was hypothesised that the judgement weighting would differ across the two judgements and that judgements regarding future risk of disability would be less consistent among GPs than judgements about case severity. Results from the regression-based judgement analysis and subsequent follow-up statistical analysis provided support for both study hypotheses. Study findings are discussed in light of theory and research on judgement, clinical decision-making and chronic low back pain."
https://openalex.org/W2611119019,"In competitive sports it is often very hard to quantify the performance. A player to score or overtake may depend on only millesimal of seconds or millimeters. In racquet sports like tennis, table tennis and squash many events will occur in a short time duration, whose recording and analysis can help reveal the differences in performance. In this paper we show that it is possible to architect a framework that utilizes the characteristic sound patterns to precisely classify the types of and localize the positions of these events. From these basic information the shot types and the ball speed along the trajectories can be estimated. Comparing these estimates with the optimal speed and target the precision of the shot can be defined. The detailed shot statistics and precision information significantly enriches and improves data available today. Feeding them back to the players and the coaches facilitates to describe playing performance objectively and to improve strategy skills. The framework is implemented, its hardware and software components are installed and tested in a squash court."
