https://openalex.org/W2042673698,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenous ∼22-nucleotide RNAs, some of which are known to play important regulatory roles in animals by targeting the messages of protein-coding genes for translational repression. We find that miR-196, a miRNA encoded at three paralogous locations in the A, B, and C mammalian HOX clusters, has extensive, evolutionarily conserved complementarity to messages of HOXB8, HOXC8 , and HOXD8 . RNA fragments diagnostic of miR-196–directed cleavage of HOXB8 were detected in mouse embryos. Cell culture experiments demonstrated down-regulation of HOXB8, HOXC8, HOXD8 , and HOXA7 and supported the cleavage mechanism for miR-196–directed repression of HOXB8 . These results point to a miRNA-mediated mechanism for the posttranscriptional restriction of HOX gene expression during vertebrate development and demonstrate that metazoan miRNAs can repress expression of their natural targets through mRNA cleavage in addition to inhibiting productive translation."

Numerous abrupt changes in 18 O/ 16 O values result from changes in tropical and subtropical precipitation driven by insolation and millennial-scale circulation shifts. The Last Interglacial Monsoon lasted 9.7 ± 1.1 thousand years, beginning with an abrupt (less than 200 years) drop in 18 O/ 16 O values 129.3 ± 0.9 thousand years ago and ending with an abrupt (less than 300 years) rise in 18 O/ 16 O values 119.6 ± 0.6 thousand years ago. The start coincides with insolation rise and measures of full interglacial conditions, indicating that insolation triggered the final rise to full interglacial conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2097834438,"Recent studies have suggested that bone marrow cells might possess a much broader differentiation potential than previously appreciated. In most cases, the reported efficiency of such plasticity has been rather low and, at least in some instances, is a consequence of cell fusion. After myocardial infarction, however, bone marrow cells have been suggested to extensively regenerate cardiomyocytes through transdifferentiation. Although bone marrow-derived cells are already being used in clinical trials, the exact identity, longevity and fate of these cells in infarcted myocardium have yet to be investigated in detail. Here we use various approaches to induce acute myocardial injury and deliver transgenically marked bone marrow cells to the injured myocardium. We show that unfractionated bone marrow cells and a purified population of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells efficiently engraft within the infarcted myocardium. Engraftment was transient, however, and hematopoietic in nature. In contrast, bone marrow-derived cardiomyocytes were observed outside the infarcted myocardium at a low frequency and were derived exclusively through cell fusion."
https://openalex.org/W2111534865,"The nature and scale of recombination rate variation are largely unknown for most species. In humans, pedigree analysis has documented variation at the chromosomal level, and sperm studies have identified specific hotspots in which crossing-over events cluster. To address whether this picture is representative of the genome as a whole, we have developed and validated a method for estimating recombination rates from patterns of genetic variation. From extensive single-nucleotide polymorphism surveys in European and African populations, we find evidence for extreme local rate variation spanning four orders in magnitude, in which 50% of all recombination events take place in less than 10% of the sequence. We demonstrate that recombination hotspots are a ubiquitous feature of the human genome, occurring on average every 200 kilobases or less, but recombination occurs preferentially outside genes."
https://openalex.org/W2096063169,"Crohn disease is a chronic, inflammatory disease of the gastrointestinal tract. A locus of approximately 250 kb at 5q31 (IBD5) was previously associated with susceptibility to Crohn disease, as indicated by increased prevalence of a risk haplotype of 11 single-nucleotide polymorphisms among individuals with Crohn disease, but the pathogenic lesion in the region has not yet been identified. We report here that two variants in the organic cation transporter cluster at 5q31 (a missense substitution in SLC22A4 and a G-->C transversion in the SLC22A5 promoter) form a haplotype associated with susceptibility to Crohn disease. These variants alter transcription and transporter functions of the organic cation transporters and interact with variants in another gene associated with Crohn disease, CARD15, to increase risk of Crohn disease. These results suggest that SLC22A4, SLC22A5 and CARD15 act in a common pathogenic pathway to cause Crohn disease."
https://openalex.org/W2147785354,"Acting as a signal, hydrogen peroxide circumvents antioxidant defense by overoxidizing peroxiredoxins (Prxs), the enzymes that metabolize peroxides. We show that sestrins, a family of proteins whose expression is modulated by p53, are required for regeneration of Prxs containing Cys-SO 2 H, thus reestablishing the antioxidant firewall. Sestrins contain a predicted redox-active domain homologous to AhpD, the enzyme catalyzing the reduction of a bacterial Prx, AhpC. Purified Hi95 (sestrin 2) protein supports adenosine triphosphate–dependent reduction of overoxidized PrxI in vitro, indicating that unlike AhpD, which is a disulfide reductase, sestrins are cysteine sulfinyl reductases. As modulators of peroxide signaling and antioxidant defense, sestrins constitute potential therapeutic targets."

https://openalex.org/W2044826456,"Cystic fibrosis is caused by mutations in the gene encoding the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). The most common mutation, ΔF508, results in the production of a misfolded CFTR protein that is retained in the endoplasmic reticulum and targeted for degradation. Curcumin is a nontoxic Ca–adenosine triphosphatase pump inhibitor that can be administered to humans safely. Oral administration of curcumin to homozygous ΔF508 CFTR mice in doses comparable, on a weight-per-weight basis, to those well tolerated by humans corrected these animals' characteristic nasal potential difference defect. These effects were not observed in mice homozygous for a complete knockout of the CFTR gene. Curcumin also induced the functional appearance of ΔF508 CFTR protein in the plasma membranes of transfected baby hamster kidney cells. Thus, curcumin treatment may be able to correct defects associated with the homozygous expression of ΔF508 CFTR."
https://openalex.org/W2009163705,"A primary goal of systems biology is to understand the design principles of the transcription networks that govern the timing of gene expression1,2,3,4,5. Here we measured promoter activity for ∼100 genes in parallel from living cells at a resolution of minutes and accuracy of 10%, based on GFP and Lux reporter libraries3. Focusing on the amino-acid biosynthesis systems of Escherichia coli4, we identified a previously unknown temporal expression program and expression hierarchy that matches the enzyme order in unbranched pathways. We identified two design principles: the closer the enzyme is to the beginning of the pathway, the shorter the response time of the activation of its promoter and the higher its maximal promoter activity. Mathematical analysis suggests that this 'just-in-time' (ref. 5) transcription program is optimal under constraints of rapidly reaching a production goal with minimal total enzyme production6,7. Our findings suggest that metabolic regulation networks are designed to generate precision promoter timing and activity programs that can be understood using the engineering principles of production pipelines."
https://openalex.org/W2071390670,"BBS4 is one of several proteins that cause Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS), a multisystemic disorder of genetic and clinical complexity. Here we show that BBS4 localizes to the centriolar satellites of centrosomes and basal bodies of primary cilia, where it functions as an adaptor of the p150(glued) subunit of the dynein transport machinery to recruit PCM1 (pericentriolar material 1 protein) and its associated cargo to the satellites. Silencing of BBS4 induces PCM1 mislocalization and concomitant deanchoring of centrosomal microtubules, arrest in cell division and apoptotic cell death. Expression of two truncated forms of BBS4 that are similar to those found in some individuals with BBS had a similar effect on PCM1 and microtubules. Our findings indicate that defective targeting or anchoring of pericentriolar proteins and microtubule disorganization contribute to the BBS phenotype and provide new insights into possible causes of familial obesity, diabetes and retinal degeneration."
https://openalex.org/W2005860386,"Pillow lava rims from the Mesoarchean Barberton Greenstone Belt in South Africa contain micrometer-scale mineralized tubes that provide evidence of submarine microbial activity during the early history of Earth. The tubes formed during microbial etching of glass along fractures, as seen in pillow lavas from recent oceanic crust. The margins of the tubes contain organic carbon, and many of the pillow rims exhibit isotopically light bulk-rock carbonate δ 13 C values, supporting their biogenic origin. Overlapping metamorphic and magmatic dates from the pillow lavas suggest that microbial life colonized these subaqueous volcanic rocks soon after their eruption almost 3.5 billion years ago."
https://openalex.org/W2145099626,"The neoplastic process may involve a cancer stem cell. This concept has emerged largely from the careful analysis of tumour biopsy systems from haematological, breast and brain tumours. However, the experimental systems necessary to provide the cellular and molecular evidence to support this important concept have been lacking. We have used adult mesenchymal stem cells (hMSC) transduced with the telomerase hTERT gene to investigate the neoplastic potential of adult stem cells. The hTERT-transduced line, hMSC-TERT20 at population doubling level (PDL) 256 showed loss of contact inhibition, anchorage independence and formed tumours in 10/10 mice. hMSC-TERT4 showed loss of contact inhibition at PDL 95, but did not exhibit anchorage independence and did not form tumours in mice. Both lines had a normal karyotype but showed deletion of the Ink4a/ARF locus. At later passage, hMSC-TERT4 also acquired an activating mutation in KRAS. In hMSC-TERT20, expression of the cell cycle-associated gene, DBCCR1 was lost due to promoter hypermethylation. This epigenetic event correlated with acquisition of tumorigenicity. These data suggest that the adult hMSCs can be targets for neoplastic transformation and have implications for the development of novel anticancer therapeutics and for the use of hMSC in tissue engineering and transplantation protocols."
https://openalex.org/W1676753599,"The 18S ribosomal DNA molecular phylogeny and lipid composition of over 120 marine diatoms showed that the capability to biosynthesize highly branched isoprenoid (HBI) alkenes is restricted to two specific phylogenetic clusters, which independently evolved in centric and pennate diatoms. The molecular record of C 25 HBI chemical fossils in a large suite of well-dated marine sediments and petroleum revealed that the older cluster, composed of rhizosolenid diatoms, evolved 91.5 ± 1.5 million years ago (Upper Turonian), enabling an accurate dating of the pace of diatom evolution that is unprecedented. The rapid rise of the rhizosolenid diatoms probably resulted from a major reorganization of the nutrient budget in the mid-Cretaceous oceans, triggered by plate tectonics."

https://openalex.org/W2116563166,"Memory T cells are long-lived antigen-experienced T cells that are generally accepted to be direct descendants of proliferating primary effector cells. However, the factors that permit selective survival of these T cells are not well established. We show that homodimeric α chains of the CD8 molecule (CD8αα) are transiently induced on a selected subset of CD8αβ + T cells upon antigenic stimulation. These CD8αα molecules promote the survival and differentiation of activated lymphocytes into memory CD8 T cells. Thus, memory precursors can be identified among primary effector cells and are selected for survival and differentiation by CD8αα."

https://openalex.org/W1972303087,"The NH2-terminal sequence of steroid receptors is highly variable between different receptors and in the same receptor from different species. In this study, a primary sequence homology comparison identified a 14-amino acid NH2-terminal motif of the human androgen receptor (AR) that is common to AR from all species reported, including the lower vertebrates. The evolutionarily conserved motif is unique to AR, with the exception of a partial sequence in the glucocorticoid receptor of higher species. The presence of the conserved motif in AR and the glucocorticoid receptor and its absence in other steroid receptors suggests convergent evolution. The function of the AR NH2-terminal conserved motif was suggested from a yeast two-hybrid screen that identified the COOH terminus of the Hsp70-interacting protein (CHIP) as a binding partner. We found that CHIP functions as a negative regulator of AR transcriptional activity by promoting AR degradation. In support of this, two mutations in the AR NH2-terminal conserved motif previously identified in the transgenic adenocarcinoma of mouse prostate model reduced the interaction between CHIP and AR. Our results suggest that the AR NH2-terminal domain contains an evolutionarily conserved motif that functions to limit AR transcriptional activity. Moreover, we demonstrate that the combination of comparative sequence alignment and yeast two-hybrid screening using short conserved peptides as bait provides an effective strategy to probe the structure-function relationships of steroid receptor NH2-terminal domains and other intrinsically unstructured transcriptional regulatory proteins.

Steroid receptors depend on multiple domains for their function as ligand-dependent transcriptional activators. The DNA- and ligand-binding domains have been studied extensively and have a high degree of structural and functional conservation. In contrast, the largely unstructured NH2-terminal domains (1Bain D.L. Franden M.A. McManaman J.L. Takimoto G.S. Horwitz K.B. J. Biol.

In contrast, transcription factors such as p53, NF-κB, and VP16 typically have transcriptional activation domains of <100 residues. The importance of the NH2-terminal domain for AR functional activity is attributed largely to activation function-1 (AF1) between amino acid residues 142 and 337 (6Simental J.A. Sar M. Lane M.V. French F.S. Wilson E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 510-518Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).

In addition, a conserved region between AR residues 225 and 259 in the region of AF1 was predicted to form an α-helix and to contribute to AR transactivation and was shown to be a binding site for the general transcription factor TFIIF (14Betney R. McEwan I.J. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2003; 31: 427-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Earlier evidence also suggested that the AR NH2-terminal region contains functional domains involved in transcriptional repression (15Zhou Z.X. Sar M. French F.S. Wilson E.M. Moudgil V.K. Steroid Hormone Receptors: Basic and Clinical Aspects. Birkhauser, Boston1993: 407-426Google Scholar). In contrast, activation function-2 (AF2) in the AR ligand-binding domain, although highly conserved, has little inherent transcriptional activity when assayed in mammalian cells (16He B.

In this study, we identify sequence 234AKELCKAVS-VSMGL247 in the human AR NH2-terminal domain, which is highly conserved in all AR sequences characterized thus far through multiple fish species. Based on the premise that strict amino acid sequence conservation indicates a site of critical function, we investigated the functional importance of human AR residues 234–247 using a yeast two-hybrid screen. The COOH terminus of the Hsp70-interacting protein (CHIP) was identified as a binding partner and was found to contribute to AR down-regulation. Plasmids—The yeast vector pGBT8 was kindly provided by Yue Xiong (University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill). pCMV-hAR-L237A/K239M/V241A/V243A, pCMV-hAR-A234T, and pCMV-hAR-E236G (17Han G.

The yeast bait vector pGBT8-AR-(220–270) contains the conserved sequence 234AKELCKAVS-VSMGL247 and was constructed by PCR amplifying the corresponding region of human AR and inserting the fragment into the EcoRI and BamHI sites in the pGBT8 vector and was confirmed by DNA sequencing. GST-AR-(220–270) and GST-AR-(220–270m4), which contains mutations L237A/K239M/V241A/V243A, were created by digesting pGBT8-AR-(220–270) with and without the mutations with EcoRI and SalI and cloning the fragment into the EcoRI and SalI sites of pGEX-5X-1. GST-AR-(220–270)-A234T and GST-AR-(220–270)-E236G were made by PCR amplifying the corresponding regions of pCMV-hAR-A234T and pCMV-hAR-E236G, and the fragment was inserted into the EcoRI and SalI sites of pGEX-5X-1. Gal-AR-(234–247) and Gal-AR-(229–254), coding for the Gal4 DNA-binding domain fusion protein with the indicated AR NH2-terminal residues, were created by cloning two annealed oligonucleotides into the EcoRI and BamHI sites of pGal0. Gal-AR-(220–270) and Gal-AR-(220–270m4) were created by PCR amplifying the corresponding regions of AR and ARm4 (AR with mutations L237A/K239M/V241A/V243A) and cloning into the EcoRI and BamHI sites of pGal0. pCMV5-CHIP and pCMV5-CHIPΔTPR, expressing CHIP with a deletion of the tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domain at residues 27–147 (see Fig. 3A), were created by digesting pcDNA3-CHIP and pcDNA3-CHIPΔTPR with EcoRI and XbaI and ligating the inserts to the EcoRI and XbaI sites of pCMV5. All PCR-amplified sequences were verified for the absence of random errors. Yeast Two-hybrid Screen—A two-hybrid screen of a human testis library was performed by sequential transformation of bait and library plasmids as recommended by the manufacturer (Clontech, YEAST-MAKER Transformation System 2 user's manual, catalog number K1606-1). Yeast strain HF7c was transformed with the bait vector pGBT8-AR-(220–270) and plated onto synthetic medium lacking Trp with the addition of 0.8 mm 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole to inhibit intrinsic activity. The yeast clone containing the bait vector was transformed using 100 μg of an amplified human testis MATCHMAKER cDNA library (BD Biosciences) and plated onto synthetic medium lacking Leu, Trp, and His with the addition of 0.8 mm 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole. Yeast colonies grown on synthetic medium lacking Leu, Trp, and His were further tested for activity using a two-hybrid interaction β-galactosidase filter assay performed following the instructions of the manufacturer (Clontech, yeast protocols handbook, catalog number PT3024-1, PR13103). Large fresh colonies were transferred to Whatman No. 5 filter paper, and the filters were immersed in liquid nitrogen for 10 s and allowed to thaw at room temperature. Freshly prepared Z buffer containing 60 mm NA2HPO4, 40 mm NaH2PO4, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm MgSO4, 50 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, pH 7.0, and 0.33 mg/ml 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (X-gal) was added to the filter and incubated at room temperature to score blue colonies after 30 min to overnight. Plasmids from the positive yeast colonies in the β-galactosidase filter assay were rescued. Colonies that grew on synthetic medium lacking Leu gradually lost the bait vector, but not the library plasmids. The library vector was purified using the Clontech YEAST-MAKER yeast plasmid isolation kit (catalog number K1611-1). In Vitro Protein Interaction Assay—GST-AR-(220–270), GST-AR-(220–270m4), GST-AR-(220–270)-A234T, and GST-AR-(220–270)-E236G were expressed from pGEX-5X-1 as GST fusion proteins. The GST fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli XL1-Blue cells treated with 0.5 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside; extracted in 0.15 m NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 100 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mm dithiothreitol, and 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0); and incubated with glutathione-agarose beads (Amersham Biosciences) as described (18He B. Kemppainen J.A. Wilson E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22986-22994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). Full-length CHIP and mutants CHIPΔTPR, CHIPΔU, and CHIP-K30A were expressed from pcDNA3 and in vitro translated in the presence of 25 μCi of [35S]methionine (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) using the TnT T7 quick coupled transcription/translation system (Promega). Washed beads were boiled in SDS-containing buffer. Input lanes contained 30% of the binding reactions. Transient Transfection Assays—Human hepatocellular carcinoma HepG2 cells (American Type Culture Collection) were maintained in 5% CO2 at 37 °C in Eagle's minimal essential medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Gemini Laboratories), 0.1 mm nonessential amino acids, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 2 mm l-glutamine, and penicillin and streptomycin. Cells were plated at 2 × 105 cells/well on 12-well tissue culture plates and transfected with the indicated concentrations of expression vector DNA and 0.1 μg of 5xGal4-Luc3 reporter vector using (per well) 50 μl of EC buffer (QIAGEN Inc.), 1 μg of enhancer, and 1 μl of Effectene. 24 h after transfection, the medium was changed to serum-free medium, and when appropriate, the indicated hormones were added. Luciferase activity was determined 24 h later by harvesting cells in 0.22 ml of lysis buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, and 25 mm Tris phosphate (pH 7.8) (19He B. Minges J.T. Lee L.W. Wilson E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10226-10235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). After a 30-min incubation at room temperature, 0.1-ml aliquots were assayed for luciferase light units using a LumiStar Galaxy multiplate reader luminometer (BMG Labtechnologies). To measure inherent transcriptional activation by the AR NH2-terminal conserved motif, Gal4 DNA-binding domain fusion proteins were expressed in HepG2 cells with the indicated regions of the AR NH2-terminal domain and the 5xGal4-Luc3 reporter vector. The effect of the NH2-terminal conserved motif on AR transactivation was determined in HepG2 cells using full-length AR vectors with the indicated deletions or mutations and the mouse mammary tumor virus-luciferase (MMTV-Luc) reporter or the PSA-Enh-Luc reporter (provided by Michael Carey, University of California, Los Angeles). The influence of CHIP on AR transcriptional activity was determined in HepG2 cells using (per well) 50 ng of pCMV5 AR expression vector, 25 ng of pCMV5-CHIP and pCMV5-CHIPΔTPR vectors, and 0.25 μg of MMTV-Luc reporter. Cells were incubated for 24 h in the absence and presence of the indicated hormones and assayed for luciferase activity as described above. In mammalian two-hybrid experiments, human epithelioid cervical carcinoma HeLa cells were maintained in Eagle's minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, and penicillin and streptomycin. HeLa cells (1.5 × 105/well of 12-well plates) were transfected with 0.1 μg of 5xGal4-Luc3 reporter and the indicated AR and CHIP vectors using Effectene as described above. Immunoblot Analysis—Monkey kidney COS cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% bovine calf serum (Hyclone Laboratories), 2 mm l-glutamine, 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.2), and penicillin and streptomycin in a 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C. Cells (1.5 × 106/10-cm dish) were transfected using DEAE-dextran or the Effectene reagent kit (QIAGEN Inc.), which included (per 10-cm dish) 0.3 ml of EC buffer, 16 μl of enhancer, 10 μl of Effectene, and 1 ml of medium added to 7 ml of fresh medium. After transfection, the medium was replaced with serum-free medium with and without 50 nm dihydrotestosterone (DHT). The next day, cells were washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline and harvested in 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline. After centrifugation at 5000 rpm at 4 °C, cells were suspended in 0.1 ml of lysis buffer containing 0.15 m NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma) and incubated for 1 h at 0 °C. After centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C, the supernatant protein concentration was determined using the Bio-Rad assay. Samples (10 μg of protein/lane) were separated on 10 or 8–16% acrylamide gels containing SDS. After electrophoresis, gel proteins were electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The blots were incubated with 1 μg/ml rabbit antibody AR32, raised against an AR NH2-terminal peptide, or with a 1:500 dilution of mouse anti-Gal4 DNA-binding domain IgG2a (sc-510, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Immunoreactive bands were visualized using chemiluminescence (SuperSignal Western Dura extended duration substrate, Pierce). Immunocytochemistry—COS cells (1.25 × 106/well) were transfected in 12-well tissue culture plates, with each well containing a 0.15-mm thick cover glass (Fisher). Cells were transfected using Effectene as described above with 0.2 μg of pCMV-hAR and pCMV5-FLAG-CHIP and treated with and without 100 nm DHT 24 and 48 h after transfection. Cells were fixed with freshly prepared 3% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100, blocked with 0.5% bovine serum albumin as described (20Feng Q. Cao R. Xia L. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Zhang Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 536-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), and incubated for 1 h with primary antibodies: mouse anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody M2 (1:250 dilution; Sigma) and rabbit anti-AR polyclonal antibody 3510 (1:250 dilution; Abcam, Inc.). After several washes with phosphate-buffered saline, cells were incubated for 30 min with secondary antibodies: TRITC-conjugated AffiniPure donkey anti-mouse IgG (1:50 dilution; Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc.) and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated AffiniPure donkey anti-rabbit IgG (1:50 dilution; Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc.). The cover glasses were mounted on slides using DakoCytomation fluorescent mounting medium (Fisher) and viewed using a Zeiss LSM 210 confocal microscope. Identification of an AR NH2-terminal Conserved Motif— Comparison of AR NH2-terminal sequences from human to lower vertebrates shows that much of the region is not conserved (Fig. 1A). This is despite the important functional role of the AR NH2-terminal domain in transactivation (6Simental J.A. Sar M. Lane M.V. French F.S. Wilson E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 510-518Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Among the poorly conserved regions are the previously reported AR transactivation subdomains AF1a (rat AR residues 154–167 and human AR residues 173–186) and AF1b (rat AR residues 295–359 and human AR residues 297–361), which are critical for transcriptional activity (7Chamberlain N.L. Whitacre D.C. Miesfeld R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26772-26778Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Lack of sequence conservation in these regions is surprising and suggests that the NH2-terminal domain evolved with its interacting partners. In contrast, several short regions of the AR NH2-terminal region show a high degree of sequence conservation. The previously described FXXLF motif at human AR NH2-terminal residues 23–27 (18He B. Kemppainen J.A. Wilson E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22986-22994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar, 21He B. Wilson E.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 2135-2150Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) is conserved as (F/Y)Q(N/S)(L/V)F from lower vertebrates through primates, although some species of fish seem to lack the NH2-terminal 5′-coding region of the AR gene that includes the FXXLF motif (Fig. 1A). Absence of the extreme NH2-terminal region could reflect incomplete sequence analysis or that certain species of fish have yet to evolve the AR FXXLF motif. An evolving FXXLF motif during vertebrate expansion is conceivable since the WXXLF motif at human AR residues 433–437, which contributes to the FXXLF motif-mediated AR NH2- and COOH-terminal interaction (18He B. Kemppainen J.A. Wilson E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22986-22994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar), is conserved from primates to Xenopus, but not in fish and other lower vertebrates (Fig. 1A). Another AR NH2-terminal region that shows striking sequence conservation across species is positioned at human AR residues 234–247 (Fig. 1A) with the consensus sequence 234A(K/R/Y)EL(C/S)KAVSVS(M/L)GL247 (Fig. 1B), numbered according to the human AR sequence of Lubahn et al. (22Lubahn D.B. Joseph D.R. Sar M. Tan J. Higgs H.N. Larson R.E. French F.S. Wilson E.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1988; 2: 1265-1275Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar) and the AR mutation data base. 2Available at ww2.mcgill.ca/androgendb/data.htm. Sequence conservation of hydrophobic residues in the region was noted previously (14Betney R. McEwan I.J. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2003; 31: 427-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Also notable is Ser256-Pro257 since Ser256 was shown previously to be phosphorylated in human AR (10Gioeli D. Ficarro S.B. Kwiek J.J. Aaronson D. Hancock M. Catling A.D. White F.M. Christian R.E. Settlage R.E. Shabanowitz J. Hunt D.F. Weber M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29304-29314Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Ser256 and Pro257 are not conserved; but remarkably, the negatively charge residues Asp and Glu most often replace Ser256 in lower species (Fig. 1, A and B), suggesting that a negative charge at this position is important for AR function. Sequence conservation of AR NH2-terminal residues 234–247 suggests a conserved motif for the AR gene family. A search of the protein sequence data base supports this, with one exception. GR from human and Xenopus, but not GR from fish, contains sequence 77DLSKAVSLSMGL88 at human GR residues 77–88, which is homologous to 12 of the 14 residues in the AR NH2-terminal conserved motif (Fig. 1B). The closer evolutionary distance between AR and the progesterone receptor compared with AR and GR (4Thornton J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5671-5676Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar) and the absence of the conserved motif in the progesterone receptor suggest that AR and GR acquired the sequence independently for a common function by convergent evolution. Analysis of the predicted order and disorder composition of the AR NH2-terminal domain using the PONDR Protein Disorder Predictor 3Available at www.pondr.com/PONDR/pondr.cgi. indicates that the FXXLF motif and the AR NH2-terminal conserved motif form short structurally ordered regions as indicated by PONDR scores of <0.1. Each motif is predicted to form an amphipathic α-helix, indicating the presence of short structured segments in an NH2-terminal region that is otherwise predicted to be largely unstructured. Intrinsic Activity of the AR NH2-terminal Conserved Motif— We tested for the presence of transcriptional activity inherent to the AR NH2-terminal conserved motif by expressing Gal4 DNA-binding domain-AR fusion proteins in mammalian cells (Fig. 2A). The NH2-terminal conserved motif residues 234–247 lacked activity, but a low level of activity was detectable when the sequence was extended in Gal-AR-(229–254). A larger fragment, Gal-AR-(220–270), elicited 20% the activity of the AR NH2-terminal domain in Gal-AR-(1–503). When mutations at four residues (L237A/K239M/V241A/V243A) were introduced into the NH2-terminal conserved motif in Gal-AR-(220–270) (Gal-AR-(220–270m4)) (Fig. 2A), the transcriptional response was reduced to background levels. Expression levels of the Gal-AR fusion proteins were similar as determined by immunoblotting (Fig. 2C, left panel). The results suggest that although the NH2-terminal conserved motif itself lacks intrinsic transcriptional activity, a larger region that includes flanking sequence of the conserved motif induces a transcriptional response that depends on residues within the AR NH2-terminal conserved motif. The flanking region may therefore be necessary for proper folding or presentation of the NH2-terminal conserved motif. Contribution of the core conserved motif to AR transcriptional activity was investigated further by testing several mutants of full-length AR. Deletion of region 220–270 (ARΔ220–270) caused a ∼50% decrease in AR transcriptional activity using the MMTV-Luc and PSA-Enh-Luc reporter vectors (Fig. 2B), confirming the importance of the region for AR activity. The decrease in transcriptional activity by ARΔ220–270 and additional mutants was independent of AR expression levels (Fig. 2C, right panel). Deleting only the NH2-terminal conserved motif (ARΔ234–247) caused less of a decrease in activity, and the decrease was similar to that seen with ARm4. Mutating the flanking Ser256 (Fig. 1B)to alanine to inhibit phosphorylation at this previously reported AR phosphorylation site (10Gioeli D. Ficarro S.B. Kwiek J.J. Aaronson D. Hancock M. Catling A.D. White F.M. Christian R.E. Settlage R.E. Shabanowitz J. Hunt D.F. Weber M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29304-29314Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar) or to aspartic acid to mimic the negative charge of a phosphate group had no effect on the AR transcriptional response. The results suggest that the AR NH2-terminal conserved motif and closely flanking sequence contribute to AR transactivation. AR NH2-terminal Conserved Motif Interaction with CHIP— The high sequence conservation of the AR NH2-terminal motif in AR gene evolution, its predicted structure, and evidence for a role in AR transcriptional activation led us to perform a yeast two-hybrid screen using a 51-amino acid residue fusion peptide as bait to probe a human testis cDNA library. Yeast strain HF7c was initially transformed with pGBT8-AR-(220–270), coding for the Gal4 DNA-binding domain and human AR residues 220–270. In agreement with the transcriptional response seen with Gal-AR-(220–270) in mammalian cells, the addition of 0.8 mm 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole was required to reduce intrinsic activity of pGBT8-AR-(220–270). Screening 106 clones of an amplified library revealed 138 positive clones that grew on synthetic medium lacking Leu, Trp, and His. Of these, 48 clones were positive in a β-galactosidase filter assay performed in yeast. Sequence analysis revealed five identical clones coding for CHIP. The clones coded for CHIP residues 20–303, representing full-length CHIP lacking the first 19 NH2-terminal amino acids. That the interaction was specific was suggested by a parallel screen of the same library using a similarly sized AR fragment from a different region of the AR NH2-terminal domain. In this case, none of the positive clones that grew on synthetic medium lacking Leu, Trp, and His coded for CHIP. 4S. Bai, B. He, and E. M. Wilson, unpublished data.

To further investigate the role of the AR NH2-terminal conserved motif in the AR and CHIP interaction, we tested several AR mutants in a mammalian two-hybrid assay using a Gal-CHIP-(20–303) fusion protein. Deletion of AR residues 220–270 (ARΔ220–270) strongly reduced the interaction with CHIP (Fig. 3B), supporting the role of the NH2-terminal conserved motif region in the AR interaction with CHIP. A small portion of this reduction was attributed to the slight decrease in background AR activity that resulted from the deletion of residues 220–270, in agreement with the results of Fig. 2 (A and B) showing that residues 220–270 harbor a transcriptional activation function. The background AR activity evident upon coexpression of the pGal0 empty vector results from a cryptic androgen response element in the 5xGal4-Luc3 reporter (19He B. Minges J.T. Lee L.W. Wilson E.M.

https://openalex.org/W2080444640,"c-Ski inhibits transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) signaling through interaction with Smad proteins. c-Ski represses Smad-mediated transcriptional activation, probably through its action as a transcriptional co-repressor. c-Ski also inhibits TGF-beta-induced downregulation of genes such as c-myc. However, mechanisms for transcriptional regulation of target genes by c-Ski have not been fully determined. In this study, we examined how c-Ski inhibits both TGF-beta-induced transcriptional activation and repression. DNA-affinity precipitation analysis revealed that c-Ski enhances the binding of Smad2 and 4, and to a lesser extent Smad3, to both CAGA and TGF-beta1 inhibitory element probes. A c-Ski mutant, which is unable to interact with Smad4, failed to enhance the binding of Smad complex on these probes and to inhibit the Smad-responsive promoter. These results suggest that stabilization of inactive Smad complexes on DNA is a critical event in c-Ski-mediated inhibition of TGF-beta signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2081993846,"Why does the Y chromosome harbor so few functional loci? Evolutionary theory predicts that Y chromosomes degenerate because they lack genetic recombination1. Both positive2 and negative1 selection models have been invoked to explain this degeneration, as both can result in the recurrent fixation of linked deleterious mutations on a nonrecombining Y chromosome. To distinguish between these models, I investigated patterns of nucleotide variability along 37 kb of the recently formed neo-Y chromosome in Drosophila miranda. Levels of nucleotide variability on this chromosome are 30 times lower than in highly recombining portions of the genome. Both positive and negative selection models can result in reduced variability levels, but their effects on the frequency spectrum of mutations differ. Using coalescent simulations, I show that the patterns of nucleotide variability on the neo-Y chromosome are unlikely under deleterious mutation models (including background selection and Muller's ratchet) but are expected under recent positive selection. These results implicate positive selection as an important force driving the degeneration of Y chromosomes; adaptation at a few loci, possibly increasing male fitness, occurs at the cost of most other genes on this chromosome."
https://openalex.org/W2153101998,"Spermatogenesis is a complex process that involves cooperation of germ cells and testicular somatic cells. Various genetic disorders lead to impaired spermatogenesis, defective sperm function and male infertility. Here we show that Cnot7(-/-) males are sterile owing to oligo-astheno-teratozoospermia, suggesting that Cnot7, a CCR4-associated transcriptional cofactor, is essential for spermatogenesis. Maturation of spermatids is unsynchronized and impaired in seminiferous tubules of Cnot7(-/-) mice. Transplantation of spermatogonial stem cells from male Cnot7(-/-) mice to seminiferous tubules of Kit mutant mice (Kit(W/W-v)) restores spermatogenesis, suggesting that the function of testicular somatic cells is damaged in the Cnot7(-/-) condition. The testicular phenotypes of Cnot7(-/-) mice are similar to those of mice deficient in retinoid X receptor beta (Rxrb). We further show that Cnot7 binds the AF-1 domain of Rxrb and that Rxrb malfunctions in the absence of Cnot7. Therefore, Cnot7 seems to function as a coregulator of Rxrb in testicular somatic cells and is thus involved in spermatogenesis."

The PS II/PS I ratio increased upon deletion of multiple SCPs in a wild type background, similar to what is observed in the presence of subsaturating concentrations of gabaculin, an inhibitor of an early step in the tetrapyrrole biosynthesis pathway. Upon deletion of multiple SCPs, neither 77 K fluorescence emission properties of phycobilisomeless thylakoids from the PS I-less/PS II-less strain nor the energy trapping efficiency of PS II were affected, indicating that under steady-state conditions SCPs do not bind much chlorophyll and do not serve as PS II antenna. Under conditions where protochlorophyllide reduction and thus chlorophyll synthesis were inhibited, chlorophyll disappeared quickly in a mutant lacking all five SCPs. This implies a role of SCPs in stabilization of chlorophyll-binding proteins and/or in reuse of chlorophylls. Under these conditions of inhibited reduction of protochlorophyllide, the accumulation kinetics of this intermediate were greatly altered in the absence of the five SCPs. This indicates an alteration of tetrapyrrole biosynthesis kinetics by SCPs. Based on this and other evidence, we propose that SCPs bind carotenoids and transiently bind chlorophyll, aiding in the supply of chlorophyll to nascent or reassembling photosynthetic complexes, and regulate the tetrapyrrole biosynthesis pathway as a function of the demand for chlorophyll.

In oxygenic photosynthesis, chlorophyll plays a crucial rule in light harvesting as well as in transformation of absorbed light energy to chemical energy. However, the combination of chlorophyll and light is both a blessing and a curse for photosynthetic organisms. Whereas both are required for photosynthesis, chlorophyll excited by light can be converted to the triplet state, which in the presence of oxygen may lead to the formation of potentially damaging singlet oxygen (1O2) (1Ricchelli F. J. Photochem. Photobiol. B Biol. 1995; 29: 109-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). The photodestructive potential of chlorophyll is greatly reduced if the chlorophyll is adjacent to carotenoids, which are efficient quenchers of both triplet chlorophyll and 1O2 (2Hirschberg J. Chamovitz D. Bryant D.A. The Molecular Biology of Cyanobacteria. Kluwer, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1994: 559-579Crossref Google Scholar). In vivo this is accomplished through pigment-binding proteins, which provide adjacency between chlorophylls and carotenoids and which allow efficient transfer of excitations eventually to the reaction center chlorophyll. In higher plants, the major chlorophyll-binding proteins are those that are part of the core complex of photosystem (PS) 1The abbreviations used are: PS, photosystem; PChlide, protochlorophyllide; DCMU, 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea; LAHG, light-activated heterotrophic growth; SCP, small Cab-like protein; TES, 2-{[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]amino}ethanesulfonic acid; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography. 1The abbreviations used are: PS, photosystem; PChlide, protochlorophyllide; DCMU, 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea; LAHG, light-activated heterotrophic growth; SCP, small Cab-like protein; TES, 2-{[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]amino}ethanesulfonic acid; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography.

Most of the cab gene family members code for chlorophyll a/b-binding proteins with three transmembrane helices, of which the sequences of the first and third membrane-spanning regions are similar and where chlorophyll-binding sites are highly conserved. Other members of the cab gene family in plants are psbS, the product of which is predicted to have four membrane-spanning regions (4Kim S. Sandusky P. Bowlby N.R. Aebersold R. Green B.R. Vlahakis S. Yocum C.F. Pichersky E. FEBS Lett. 1992; 314: 67-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) and affects nonphotochemical quenching (5Li X.P. Björkman O. Shih C. Grossman A.R. Rosenquist M.

However, numerous genes potentially coding for small proteins with a single membrane-spanning region similar to the first and third transmembrane regions of Cab proteins and with conserved residues involved in chlorophyll binding were found in genomes of many cyanobacteria including prochlorophytes (see Refs. 8Dolganov N.A. Bhaya D. Grossman A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 636-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar and 9Bhaya D. Dufresne A. Vaulot D. Grossman A. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2002; 215: 209-219Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For example, the Prochlorococcus marinus MED4 genome contains as many as 23 such genes (9Bhaya D. Dufresne A. Vaulot D. Grossman A. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2002; 215: 209-219Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The genome of the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 contains genes for four small Cab-like proteins (SCPs) that have been named ScpB–ScpE (10Funk C. Vermaas W. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 9397-9404Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). In addition, ferrochelatase in cyanobacteria and the chloroplast-targeted isozyme in plants has a ∼60-residue C-terminal extension (absent in other ferrochelatases) that is similar to the SCPs. For this reason, the C-terminal extension has been named ScpA and this SCP extension does not seem to be necessary for the activity of ferrochelatase in Synechocystis (10Funk C. Vermaas W. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 9397-9404Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Since one of the conditions under which the small scp genes are expressed is high light intensity, these genes also have been named hli (high light-inducible) by other authors (8Dolganov N.A. Bhaya D. Grossman A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 636-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 11He Q. Dolganov N. Björkman O. Grossman A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 306-314Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar).The function of SCPs is still largely unclear, although the number of existing scp genes in different species of cyanobacteria seems to be related to their ecological niches (9Bhaya D. Dufresne A. Vaulot D. Grossman A. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2002; 215: 209-219Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803, levels of ScpB–ScpE were elevated under different stress conditions, and the mutant lacking four SCPs (ScpB–ScpE) was unable to survive at high light intensity (11He Q. Dolganov N. Björkman O. Grossman A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 306-314Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Therefore, it was suggested that expression of scp genes is critical in the adaptation of cyanobacteria to various light intensities (11He Q. Dolganov N. Björkman O. Grossman A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 306-314Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 12Havaux M. Guedeney G. He Q.F. Grossman A.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1557: 21-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Upon deletion of ScpE, dark-grown PS I-less/chlL– cells showed a decrease in protochlorophyllide (PChlide), phycobilin, and heme levels (ChlL is a subunit of the light-independent PChlide reductase, and therefore chlL– mutants are unable to synthesize chlorophyll in the dark). Moreover, the chlorophyll synthesis rate in the PS I-less/chlL–/scpB– and PS I-less/chlL–/scpE– strains decreased when these two mutants were transferred from darkness to light (13Xu H. Vavilin D. Funk C. Vermaas W. Plant Mol. Biol. 2002; 49: 149-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), implying that at least some of the SCPs may be involved in the regulation of chlorophyll biosynthesis. Considering that single-deletion SCP mutants in a wild-type background do not exhibit a strong phenotype, in the present paper, we focus on studies of mutants lacking multiple SCPs in different backgrounds (PS I-less, PS II-less, and/or chlL–). The results of these studies support the idea of SCP involvement in regulation of various steps of tetrapyrrole biosynthesis coupled to transient chlorophyll binding by SCPs and provide evidence that SCPs may aid in the supply of chlorophyll to nascent or reassembling photosynthetic units.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESGrowth Conditions—Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 wild-type and mutant strains were grown at 30 °C in BG-11 medium (14Rippka R. Deruelles J. Waterbury J.B. Herdman M. Stanier R.Y. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1979; 111: 1-61Crossref Google Scholar), buffered with N-tris(hydroxymethyl)-2-aminoethanesulfonic acid (TES)-NaOH (pH 8.0). For photomixotrophic and photoheterotrophic growth, the medium was supplemented with 5 mm glucose. Unless indicated otherwise, strains containing PS I were grown with continuous illumination at an intensity of 50 μmol of photons m–2 s–1, whereas those in a PS I-less background were grown at a lower light intensity (2–3 μmol of photons m–2 s–1). When strains were grown in liquid culture under LAHG conditions (15Anderson S.L. McIntosh L. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 2761-2767Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), cells were kept in complete darkness except for one 15-min light period (white light at 20 μmol of photons m–2 s–1) every 24 h. For growth on plates, 1.5% (w/v) Difco agar and 0.3% (w/v) sodium thiosulfate were added, and BG-11 was supplemented with antibiotics appropriate for the particular strain. No antibiotics were added to the liquid growth media to avoid any influence posed by these compounds. Growth was monitored by measuring the optical density of the cells at 730 nm using a Shimadzu UV-160 spectrophotometer.DNA Manipulation—To introduce a scpB deletion, a 261-bp NcoI to KpnI fragment (covering the entire Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 scpB coding region and 46 bp downstream of the stop codon) was deleted from the plasmid containing the scpB gene with 440 and 820 bp upstream and downstream, respectively, of this gene (13Xu H. Vavilin D. Funk C. Vermaas W. Plant Mol. Biol. 2002; 49: 149-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) and was replaced by a zeocin resistance cassette (16Howitt C.A. Udall P.K. Vermaas W.F.J.

To be able to recycle and reuse the erythromycin resistance cassette, a markerless scpC deletion plasmid was also made. A 153-bp PshAI (34 bp downstream of the start codon) to BsaHI (26 bp upstream of the stop codon) fragment was deleted from the plasmid containing scpC (13Xu H. Vavilin D. Funk C. Vermaas W.

The construction of the scpA interruption plasmid (with a kanamycin resistance cartridge inserted at the border of the ferrochelatase domain and the Scp extension of ScpA to obtain a truncated ferrochelatase without the Cab domain), the psbB deletion plasmid (with streptomycin resistance) and the psaAB deletion plasmid (with chloramphenicol resistance) have been described by Funk and Vermaas (10Funk C.

Dordrecht, Kluwer, The Netherlands1992: 429-432Google Scholar), respectively.To delete chlL, an 810-bp AccI-NheI fragment (from 85 bp downstream of the start codon of the chlL gene to 33 bp upstream of its stop codon) was deleted from the pFQ2 plasmid (20Wu Q. Vermaas W. Plant Mol. Biol. 1995; 29: 933-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) and replaced by a gentamycin resistance cassette.The Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 psbC gene along with the 3′ end of psbDI was amplified by PCR using primers with the sequence 5′-CCCAAGCAGAAGgAtcctATTCCATGG-3′ (referred to as 5′ psbC) and 5′-AGCAAAACCTcTGCAgAATCAGAAAAG-3′ (named 3′ psbC). The sequence of these primers corresponds to nucleotides 1349186–1349160 and 1347440–1347466 in CyanoBase (available on the World Wide Web at www.kazusa.or.jp/cyano/cyano.html), respectively. Nucleotides in lowercase represent changes made to the genome sequence to introduce a restriction site to facilitate cloning. The PCR product was then cloned in pUC19 using the BamHI and PstI restriction sites in the primers. A 582-bp AccI-BssHII fragment was deleted and replaced with a 1.9-kb gentamycin resistance marker (21Yin J.C. Krebs M.P. Reznikoff W.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 199: 35-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). This fragment starts in psbDI (67 bp upstream of the psbC coding region, which starts at a GTG (22Carpenter S.D. Charité J. Eggers B. Vermaas W.F.J. FEBS Lett. 1990; 260: 135-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) and 82 bp 5′ of the psbDI stop codon) and includes the 5′ 515 bp of the 1380-bp psbC coding region. Upon introduction of this deletion into the Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 genome, both the 3′ end of psbDI and the 5′ end of psbC are deleted. However, since a second psbD gene, psbDII, remains present in the cyanobacterium, the phenotype associated with a lack of this gene region is caused by the lack of psbC.Transformation of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803—Transformation of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 with the plasmids described above was carried out according to Vermaas et al. (23Vermaas W.F.J. Williams J.G.K. Arntzen C.J. Plant Mol. Biol. 1987; 8: 317-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Transformants were selected by screening for resistance to appropriate antibiotics and then subcultured at increasing concentrations of antibiotics to allow segregation of wild-type and mutant genome copies to occur, thus leading to homozygous strains in wild-type, PS I-less, PS II-less (psbB–/psbC–), and PS I-less/PS II-less backgrounds that are unable to make four or all five SCPs. To remove the erythromycin resistance-sacB cassette from the genomes of scpC interruption mutants, homozygous mutant cells were transformed with the markerless scpC deletion construct. After transformation, the Synechocystis cells were grown in liquid BG-11 medium for 4 days. Transformants were then plated and selected for growth in the presence of 5% (w/v) sucrose. Sucrose-resistant colonies that had lost SacB activity were then checked for erythromycin sensitivity.Segregation at all loci was confirmed by PCR; using Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 DNA from transformants as a template, only the PCR fragment corresponding to the interruption/deletion construct was observed, and the fragment corresponding to the wild-type locus was absent.Pigment Analysis—The chlorophyll content of the cells was measured either spectrophotometrically using a Shimadzu UV-160 spectrophotometer or by HPLC after extraction with 100% methanol. The extinction coefficient for chlorophyll a (71.43 mm–1 cm–1 at 665.2 nm) was taken from Porra et al. (24Porra R.J. Thompson W.A. Kriedemann P.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 975: 384-394Crossref Scopus (4573) Google Scholar). The HPLC analysis of pigments was carried out as described before (13Xu H. Vavilin D. Funk C. Vermaas W. Plant Mol. Biol. 2002; 49: 149-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 25Lagarde D. Beuf L. Vermaas W. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2000; 66: 64-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar).Fluorescence Spectroscopy—Fluorescence emission spectra were determined using a Fluorolog 2 instrument (Spex Industries, Metuchen, NJ). Measurements were carried out at 77 K with excitation and emission slit widths of 1 and 0.25 mm, respectively, which correspond to bandwidths of 4 and 1 nm. Fluorescence induction using intact cells was measured in the presence of 5 μm DCMU using the same instrument equipped with a manually triggered UNIBLITZ-26L2A0T5 electronic shutter (3-ms opening time). The emission wavelength was set at 680 nm (the bandwidth at half-maximum was 8 nm), and the excitation wavelength was 435 nm. Cell densities from different strains were adjusted to a concentration of 0.2 μg of chlorophyll/ml.Gabaculin Treatment—Wild type cells were grown in continuous light to early exponential growth phase (OD730 ∼0.2), and then 5 μm gabaculin, an inhibitor of the tetrapyrrole biosynthesis pathway at the level of glutamate-1-semialdehyde aminotransferase, was added to the cultures. Cells were allowed to grow in the presence of this subsaturating concentration of gabaculin for about 1 day to OD730 ∼0.4 and were then used for measurements.Thylakoid Membrane Preparation—Thylakoid membrane preparations were carried out as described before (26He Q. Vermaas W. Plant Mol. Biol. 1999; 39: 1175-1188Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). For 77 K fluorescence measurements, isolated thylakoids were suspended in pyrophosphate buffer (50 mm Mes-NaOH (pH 6.5) and 20 mm sodium pyrophosphate), pelleted by centrifugation, and finally resuspended in thylakoid buffer (20 mm Mes-NaOH (pH 6.5), 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm CaCl2, and 20% glycerol (v/v)). This additional wash step helped to remove most phycobiliproteins from the membranes so that phycobilin pigments were no longer detectable by measuring absorption spectra at 550–730 nm. However, a small amount of phycobilins remained in the preparations, as seen from 77 K fluorescence emission and excitation spectra.RESULTSConstruction of Multiple scp Deletion Mutants—The scpC interruption plasmid carrying an erythromycin resistance cassette and the sacB gene was introduced into wild type Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803, and homozygous transformants lacking intact scpC were obtained. This strain was then transformed with the markerless scpC deletion plasmid to remove the erythromycin resistance-sacB cassette, and sucrose-resistant colonies lacking SacB activity were selected. Transformants were confirmed to lack the erythromycin resistance marker and sacB and to contain the scpC deletion. The scpC– strain thus created was then transformed sequentially with scpA, scpD, and scpB and/or scpE interruption/deletion plasmids, leading to the scpABCD–, scpACDE–, and scpABCDE– strains. Complete segregation at the scp loci was verified by PCR. Fig. 1 illustrates the result for the scpABCDE– strain in comparison with the wild type.To generate the PS II-less strains lacking four or five scp genes, the scpAC– mutant was used for transformation with deletion plasmids for psbB and psbC, which encode the two major chlorophyll-binding proteins in PS II, CP47 and CP43. This transformation order was chosen because the spectinomycin resistance marker conveys streptomycin resistance as well (27Prentki P. Krisch H.M. Gene (Amst.). 1984; 29: 303-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (1337) Google Scholar). Therefore, the streptomycin resistance marker was introduced, and homozygous segregants (psbB–) were obtained before constructs with the spectinomycin resistance marker were introduced into this strain. The resulting PS II-less/scpAC– mutant was then transformed sequentially with scpD and scpB and/or scpE interruption/deletion plasmids, leading to the PS II-less/scpABCD–, PS II-less/scpACDE–, and PS II-less/scpABCDE– strains. The psaAB cluster coding for the PS I reaction center proteins was deleted in SCP mutants or in PS II-less/SCP mutant strains to add the PS I-less phenotype. The scp deletion mutants generated in this study and their markers are listed in Table I.Table ISynechocystis sp.

As shown in Table II, the chlorophyll content of the wild type and PS II-less strains showed a small decrease (5–20%) upon deletion of four SCPs. Upon deletion of five SCPs in these two background strains, the chlorophyll decrease was larger (25–30%). Interestingly, the total carotenoid level in the multiple scp deletion mutants showed a parallel 30–40% decrease as compared with wild type (Table II). Among the four major carotenoids present in wild type Synechocystis, zeaxanthin and echinenone levels remained more constant upon deletion of scp genes than the levels of myxoxanthophyll and β-carotene, which in the scpABCDE– strain decreased to 50–60% of the amount in the wild type (Table III).Table IIPigment composition of mutants lacking four or five of the SCPsStrainsChlorophyl (μg/ml)/OD730Carotenoids (μg/ml)/OD730Chlorophyllide (ng/ml)/OD730BackgroundSCP inactivationsWild type4.05 ± 0.042.17 ± 0.03NDscpABCD-3.87 ± 0.031.62 ± 0.04NDscpACDE-3.75 ± 0.041.59 ± 0.05NDscpABCDE-3.06 ± 0.051.41 ± 0.03NDPS II-less3.56 ± 0.071.85 ± 0.05NDscpABCD-2.94 ± 0.041.72 ± 0.04NDscpACDE-3.13 ± 0.021.68 ± 0.04NDscpABCDE-2.58 ± 0.051.48 ± 0.030.1 ± 0.1PS I-less0.81 ± 0.020.75 ± 0.061.2 ± 0.1scpABCD-0.62 ± 0.020.67 ± 0.032.6 ± 0.2scpACDE-0.58 ± 0.020.58 ± 0.023.2 ± 0.3scpABCDE-0.28 ± 0.020.43 ± 0.023.5 ± 0.3PS I-less/PS II-less0.18 ± 0.020.78 ± 0.011.8 ± 0.2scpABCD-0.03 ± 0.010.42 ± 0.032.0 ± 0.1scpACDE-0.008 ± 0.0010.21 ± 0.015.1 ± 0.3scpABCDE-0.006 ± 0.0010.18 ± 0.015.7 ± 0.3 Open table in a new tab Table IIICarotenoid levels in Synechocystis sp.

This is in line with earlier observations (28Shen G. Boussiba S. Vermaas W.F.J. Plant Cell. 1993; 5: 1853-1863Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar) and supports the view that most chlorophyll is associated with PS I in Synechocystis. The scpABCD–, scpACDE–, and scpABCDE– mutants in the PS I-less background showed up to a 3-fold decrease in the amount of chlorophyll. The amount of the decrease in an absolute sense was similar to that in wild type but in a relative sense was much larger than in wild type, since the PS I-less strain contains little chlorophyll.As expected, the PS I-less/PS II-less strain retained about 4% of the chlorophyll present in the wild type (see Refs. 29Shen G. Vermaas W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13904-13910Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar and 30Ermakova-Gerdes S. Shestakov S. Vermaas W. Mathis P. Photosynthesis: From Light to Biosphere. I. Dordrecht, Kluwer, The Netherlands1995: 483-486Google Scholar and Table II). The protein(s) with which this remaining chlorophyll is associated have remained largely unidentified thus far (26He Q. Vermaas W. Plant Mol. Biol. 1999; 39: 1175-1188Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Upon deletion of all SCPs in the PS I-less/PS II-less background, the amount of chlorophyll per cell decreased 30-fold. If either scpB or scpE remained, the level of remaining chlorophyll per cell decreased 6- or 20-fold relative to the PS I-less/PS II-less strain. The carotenoid level decreased 2–4-fold upon scp deletion from the PS I-less/PS II-less strain (Table II). Interestingly, removal of four or five SCPs from the PS I-less/PS II-less strain preferentially affected the amount of myxoxanthophyll; the myxoxanthophyll amount decreased 7–15-fold upon deletion of scpACDE or scpABCDE, whereas the other three carotenoids only showed a 3–4-fold decrease in comparison with the PS I-less/PS II-less strain (Table III). The almost complete lack of chlorophyll and carotenoids in the PS I-less/PS II-less/scpABCDE– strain caused the color of the mutant cell suspension to be blue, whereas wild-type and PS I-less Synechocystis strains are green and blue-green, respectively.To determine whether the changes in chlorophyll content led to accumulation of chlorophyll biosynthesis precursors, methanol extracts from PS I-less and PS I-less/PS II-less strains lacking four or five SCPs and grown in continuous light were subjected to HPLC analysis using an elution gradient that can resolve hydrophilic compounds, including chlorophyllide, PChlide, and Mg-protoporphyrin IX. As shown in Table II, in strains carrying multiple scp deletions, chlorophyllide accumulated to 2–3-fold higher levels than in the corresponding parental strains. However, no accumulation of PChlide or Mg-protoporphyrin IX was detected within our detection limits (1 nm/OD730 for PChlide and 0.02 nm/OD730 for Mg-protoporphyrin IX). Interestingly, the growth rate of the PS I-less/scpABCDE– strain in continuous light was about 2 times slower than that of the PS I-less strain (doubling times of 52 ± 3 and 25 ± 2 h, respectively), suggesting that the rate of synthesis of tetrapyrroles (such as heme) is limiting or that as yet unidentified compounds early in the tetrapyrrole pathway may accumulate.Fluorescence Induction—The observation that chlorophyll levels dropped upon deletion of scp genes in all background strains in a way similar to what was observed upon the deletion of PS I and/or PS II that bind the majority of chlorophyll in the wild type Synechocystis suggests that SCPs may bind chlorophyll as well.

https://openalex.org/W2087821811,"Histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors are known to arrest human tumor cells at the G1 phase of the cell cycle and activate the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, p21WAF1/Cip1. However, several studies have suggested the existence of a p21WAF1/Cip1-independent molecular pathway. We report here that HDAC inhibitors activate a member of the INK4 family, the INK4d gene, causing G1 phase arrest, in the human T cell leukemia cell line, Jurkat. One of the major Trichostatin A (TSA)-responsive elements is a specific Sp1 binding site in the INK4d promoter. Electrophoretic mobility-shift assay revealed that Sp1 and Sp3 can specifically interact with this Sp1 binding site. Furthermore, using chromatin immunoprecipitation assay, we demonstrated that HDAC2 was present in the INK4d proximal promoter region in the absence, but not the presence, of TSA. Taken together, these results suggest that treatment with TSA transcriptionally activates INK4d by releasing HDAC2 from the histone–DNA complex at the INK4d promoter. Using a p21WAF1/Cip1-deleted human colorectal carcinoma cell line, HCT116 p21 (−/−), we show that upregulation of p19INK4d by TSA is associated with inhibition of cell proliferation. Moreover, mouse embryo fibroblasts lacking Ink4d were resistant to the growth inhibitory effects of TSA as compared to their wild-type counterpart. Our findings suggest that p19INK4d in addition to p21WAF1/Cip1 is an important molecular target of HDAC inhibitors inducing growth arrest."
https://openalex.org/W1998878936,"Solid tumors frequently contain hypoxic subregions due to insufficient blood supply. In these domains, cells can undergo p53-dependent apoptosis. Therefore, hypoxia has been implicated as a physiological stimulus for p53 accumulation and activation. In such an environment, p53 mutant cells exhibit a selective growth advantage. Hypoxic regulation of p53 has been proposed to be hypoxia inducible factor (HIF) dependent; however, controversy remains over whether and to what extent low oxygen (O2) tension by itself enhances p53 protein stability. Here, we examined the p53 response to hypoxia and hypoxia mimetics in several cell lines expressing different HIF-α proteins. Most cells exhibited elevated levels of p53 in response to hypoxia mimetics such as deferoxamine mesylate and CoCl2, regardless of their HIF-α protein expression profile. However, over a range of O2 levels, from 1.5% to less than 0.02%, we failed to observe p53 accumulation or p53 nuclear translocation in any cell lines tested. Only after treatment with a combination of hypoxia and acidosis/nutrient deprivation did some cells exhibit p53 induction. Our results suggest that, although hypoxia induces p53 accumulation in vivo, secondary effects such as acidosis caused by a hypoxic Pasteur effect (instead of low O2 by itself) are necessary for p53 accumulation. Therefore, the expression of HIF-1α and p53 proteins is not coupled during the cellular hypoxia response."
https://openalex.org/W2015261079,"Post-translational modification of proteins by the ubiquitin-like molecule SUMO (sumoylation) regulates their subcellular localization and affects their functional properties in vitro, but the physiological function of sumoylation in multicellular organisms is largely unknown. Here, we show that the C. elegans Polycomb group (PcG) protein SOP-2 interacts with the SUMO-conjugating enzyme UBC-9 through its evolutionarily conserved SAM domain. Sumoylation of SOP-2 is required for its localization to nuclear bodies in vivo and for its physiological repression of Hox genes. Global disruption of sumoylation phenocopies a sop-2 mutation by causing ectopic Hox gene expression and homeotic transformations. Chimeric constructs in which the SOP-2 SAM domain is replaced with that derived from fruit fly or mammalian PcG proteins, but not those in which the SOP-2 SAM domain is replaced with the SAM domains of non-PcG proteins, confer appropriate in vivo nuclear localization and Hox gene repression. These observations indicate that sumoylation of PcG proteins, modulated by their evolutionarily conserved SAM domain, is essential to their physiological repression of Hox genes."
https://openalex.org/W1988098314,"Malignant mesotheliomas (MMs) are aggressive tumors derived from mesothelial cells lining the lungs, pericardium and peritoneum, and are often associated with occupational asbestos exposure. Suppression subtractive hybridization was used to identify genes differentially expressed in MM cells compared to normal mesothelial cells. A gene, SEP15, encoding a 15-kDa selenium-containing protein was isolated using this approach and was subsequently shown to be downregulated in approximately 60% of MM cell lines and tumor specimens. A SEP15 polymorphic variant, 1125A, resides in the SECIS recognition element in the 3'-UTR and may influence the efficiency of Sec incorporation into the protein during translation. Since previous studies have implicated a potential role of the trace element selenium as a chemopreventive agent in animal models and in several types of human cancer, we investigated the effect of selenium on MM cells and its dependence on SEP15 genotype. Selenium was shown to inhibit cell growth and induce apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner in MM cells but had minimal effect on normal mesothelial cells. However, MM cells with downregulated SEP15 or the 1125A variant were somewhat less responsive to the growth inhibitory and apoptotic effects of selenium than MM cells expressing wild-type protein. RNAi-based knockdown studies demonstrated that SEP15 inhibition makes sensitive MM cells more resistant to selenium. These data imply that selenium may be useful as a chemopreventive agent in individuals at high risk of MM due to asbestos exposure, although those with the 1125A polymorphism may be less responsive to the protective benefits of dietary selenium supplementation."

https://openalex.org/W1965975711,"Downregulation of protein tyrosine kinases is a major function of the multidomain protein c-Cbl. This effect of c-Cbl is critical for both negative regulation of normal physiological stimuli and suppression of cellular transformation. In spite of the apparent importance of these effects of c-Cbl, their own regulation is poorly understood. To search for possible novel regulators of c-Cbl, we purified a number of c-Cbl-associated proteins by affinity chromatography and identified them by mass spectrometry. Among them, we identified the UBA- and SH3-containing protein T-cell Ubiquitin LigAnd (TULA), which can also bind to ubiquitin. Functional studies in a model system based on co-expression of TULA, c-Cbl, and EGF receptor in 293T cells demonstrate that TULA is capable of inhibiting c-Cbl-mediated downregulation of EGF receptor. Furthermore, modulation of TULA concentration in Jurkat T-lymphoblastoid cells demonstrates that TULA upregulates the activity of both Zap kinase and NF-AT transcription factor. Therefore, our study indicates that TULA counters the inhibitory effect of c-Cbl on protein tyrosine kinases and, thus, may be involved in the regulation of biological effects of c-Cbl. Finally, our results suggest that TULA-mediated inhibition of the effects of c-Cbl on protein tyrosine kinases is caused by TULA-induced ubiquitylation and degradation of c-Cbl."
https://openalex.org/W2010503810,"NEMO (NF-κB essential modulator) plays a key role in the canonical NF-κB pathway as the scaffold/regulatory component of the IκB kinase (IKK) complex. The self-association of NEMO involves the C-terminal halves of the polypeptide chains containing two putative coiled-coil motifs (a CC2 and a LZ leucine zipper), a proline-rich region, and a ZF zinc finger motif. Using purified truncation mutants, we showed that the minimal oligomerization domain of NEMO is the CC2-LZ segment and that both CC2 and LZ subdomains are necessary to restore the LPS-dependent activation of the NF-κB pathway in a NEMO-deficient cell line. We confirmed the association of the oligomerization domain in a trimer and investigated the specific role of CC2 and LZ subdomains in the building of the oligomer.

This phosphorylation is in turn followed by ubiquitination and degradation of IκB by the proteasome, allowing the NF-κB transcription factors to enter the nucleus and to activate their target genes (4Karin M. Ben-Neriah Y. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 621-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (4024) Google Scholar). The IKK complex contains two protein kinases, IKK-α and IKK-β, and a structural/regulatory subunit called NEMO (NF-κB essential modulator) or IKK-γ (6Yamaoka S. Courtois G. Bessia C. Whiteside S.T.

NEMO is the key regulator of the NF-κB pathway as genetic inactivation abolishes signaling in response to several extracellular stimuli (6Yamaoka S. Courtois G. Bessia C. Whiteside S.T. Weil R.

Science. 1998; 281: 1360-1363Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The mechanism by which NEMO is activated remains unclear and several factors have been proposed to be involved, including phosphorylation (12Prajapati S. Gaynor R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24331-24339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) and ubiquitination (13Tang E.D. Wang C.Y. Xiong Y. Guan K.L. J. Biol.

Indeed, the de-ubiquitinating enzyme CYLD negatively regulates NF-κB activation by specific tumor-necrosis factor receptors (14Brummelkamp T.R. Nijman S.M. Dirac A.M. Bernards R.

Indeed, IKK can be activated by the enforced oligomerization of NEMO through the fusion with the FKBP12 polypeptide (17Inohara N. Koseki T. Lin J. del Peso L. Lucas P.C. Chen F.F. Ogura Y. Nunez G.

In addition, the binding of Tax, a well known NF-κB activator, to NEMO also results in its oligomerization (20Huang G.-J. Zhang Z.Q. Jin D.Y. FEBS Lett. 2002; 531: 494-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The quaternary structure of NEMO is a matter of debate. In vitro cross-linking experiments with the non-cleavable amine-reactive bis(sulfosuccinimidyl)suberate cross-linker established that pure recombinant NEMO autoassociates in dimers and trimers (20Huang G.-J. Zhang Z.Q. Jin D.Y. FEBS Lett. 2002; 531: 494-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Using a very similar amine-reactive cross-linking agent, ethylene glycol-bissuccinimidylsuccinate, Rothwarf et al. (7Rothwarf D.M. Zandi E. Natoli G. Karin M. Nature. 1998; 395: 297-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (836) Google Scholar) also found dimeric and trimeric forms of recombinant NEMO. In contrast, when using the same broad spectrum cross-linking reagent in crude extracts from HeLa cells, Tegethoff et al. (21Tegethoff S. Behlke J. Sheidereit C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 2029-2041Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) reported that NEMO predominantly forms tetramers. In our laboratory, we used bis(maleimido)ethane, a cell-permeable cysteine cross-linker, to show that NEMO associates into both dimers and trimers in HeLa cells (1Agou F. Ye F. Goffinont S.

Agou, unpublished results. 2F. Agou, unpublished results. We also showed, using gel filtration and sedimentation equilibrium, that the purified C-terminal domain of NEMO (amino acids 242–388) 3In this report amino acid numbering refers to the mouse sequence. 3In this report amino acid numbering refers to the mouse sequence. (hereafter called the C-ter domain) self-assembles into trimers (1Agou F. Ye F. Goffinont S. Courtois G. Yamaoka S. Israël A. Véron M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 17467-17475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (68) Google Scholar). A “minimal oligomerization domain” has been identified within this C-ter domain based on immunoprecipitation assays and functional complementation assays (21Tegethoff S. Behlke J. Sheidereit C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 2029-2041Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). This minimal domain corresponds to amino acids 246–365. The NEMO C-ter domain contains three predicted structural motifs (see Fig. 2): a coil-coiled motif (CC2) (amino acids 253–285, murine sequence), a leucine zipper (LZ) (amino acids 301–337), and a zinc finger motif (ZF) at the extreme C terminus of the protein (amino acids 389–410). The ZF motif is required for UV-induced NF-κB activation (22Huang T.T. Feinberg S.L. Suryanarayanan S. Miyamoto S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 5813-5825Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) and for the response to tumor necrosis factorα or interleukin-1. 4S. Yamaoka, unpublished results. 4S. Yamaoka, unpublished results. Mutations in this C-ter domain result in two human diseases, incontinentia pigmenti and anhidrotic ectodermal dysplasia with immunodeficiency (23Smahi A. Courtois G.

The discovery of two mutations in patients with anhidrotic ectodermal dysplasia with immunodeficiency suggests that the oligomerization state of NEMO plays a role in the pathological defects of the NF-κB signal transduction pathway. Interestingly, D304N is located in the predicted α helix that is upstream from the canonical LZ motif beginning at Leu315, and A281G is in the CC2 motif (24Döffinger R. Smahi A. Bessia C.

In this report, we investigated the functional and structural roles of the subdomains constituting the C-ter domain of NEMO. We used gel filtration and sedimentation equilibrium to compare the assembly properties of several highly purified truncated proteins containing a combination of CC2, LZ, and ZF motifs. We show that the minimal oligomerization domain of NEMO consists of the CC2 and LZ coiled-coils, and that these subdomains can interact to form a highly stable pseudohexameric structure. On the basis of these results, we propose a structural model for the C-terminal domain of NEMO. Reagents—Anti-His tag antibodies were from Qiagen, octyl glucoside and dodecyl maltoside were from Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Geneticin (G418) was from Invitrogen, and anti-NEMO polyclonal antibody was prepared as described previously (6Yamaoka S. Courtois G. Bessia C. Whiteside S.T. Weil R. Agou F. Kirk H.E. Kay R.J. Israël A. Cell. 1998; 93: 1231-1240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (942) Google Scholar). Functional Complementation of 1.3E2 Cells—An HA-tagged murine NEMO expression vector, HA-nemo, was constructed by inserting a PCR-amplified nemo cDNA into pcDNA3-HA, a modified version of pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). The sequences of the primers used for PCR amplification were: 5′-GCGCGTCGACAACAAGCACCCCTGGAAG-3′ and 5′-GGGCGCTAGCTAATCACCGGGAAGAAAGGTAC-3′. The PCR product was digested with SalI and XbaI and cloned into XhoI/XbaI-digested pcDNA3-HA. HA-LZ-mut-nemo was constructed by inserting a PCR-amplified nemo cDNA fragment produced by an overlapping PCR method into pcDNA3-HA. The sequences of the primers used for the first PCR amplification step were: 5′-GCGCGTCGACAACAAGCACCCCTGGAAG-3′, 5′-GTTGAACTCGCGCTGCGACTGCTCCAGCTGCTCCTGCGAATACTCCTTCTTCTC-3, 5′-GAGAAGAAGGAGTATTCGCAGGAGCAGCTGGAGCAGTCGCAGCGCGAGTTCAAC-3′, and 5′-GGGCGCTAGCTAATCACCGGGAAGAAAGGTAC-3′ (mutations are underlined). Each PCR product was purified, mixed with each other, and subjected to a few additional cycles of PCR in the absence of primers. The products were then subjected to a third PCR using: 5′-GCGCGTCGACAACAAGCACCCCTGGAAG-3′ and 5′-GGGCGCTAGCTAATCACCGGGAAGAAAGGTAC-3′. The PCR product was digested with SalI and XbaI and cloned into XhoI/XbaI-digested pcDNA3-HA, generating a HA-NEMO that contained a S322A/S329A double mutation (LZ mut). HA-ΔCC2-nemo, encoding an HA-tagged NEMO lacking amino acids 280–311, was prepared by using pBX-nemo, a pBluescript-derivative containing a BamHI/XbaI fragment of nemo isolated from HA-nemo. pBX-nemo was digested with AvaI, filled in with the Klenow fragment, digested with SphI, and treated with T4 DNA polymerase. After self-ligation, the resulting 4.2-kb fragment was digested with BamHI and XbaI, and the recovered 1.4-kb fragment was cloned into pcDNA3-HA. Stable and Transient Transfections—The 1.3E2 cells were transiently transfected essentially as in a previous study (26Courtois G. Whiteside S.T. Sibley C.H. Israël A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1441-1449Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To generate stable 1.3E2 clones, 5 μg of HA-nemo or HA-LZ-mut-nemo plasmids were added to 5 × 106 cells in a 500-μl volume and electroporated at 260 V, 1500 microfarads, and R ∞. G418 (1 μg/ml) was added the following day, and cells were cloned by limited dilution after a week of selection. Expression of HA-NEMO was checked using the anti-HA antibody. Transfected clones expressing NEMO at a level similar to parental 70Z/3 cells were selected for further analysis. Peptide Synthesis and Purification—Peptides were synthesized on an Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA) Pioneer peptide synthesizer by continuous flow Fmoc/ter-butyl chemistry (27Chan W.C. White P.D. Fmoc Solid-Phase Peptide Synthesis. A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, Oxford, UK2000Google Scholar) and purified as described previously (28Mousson F. Beswick V. Coic Y.-M. Baleux F. Huynh-Dinh T. Sanson A. Neumann J.-M. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 13611-13616Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). All peptides were blocked with an acetyl group at their N terminus and with an amide at their C terminus. Purified peptides were quantified by amino acid analysis and characterized by positive ion electrospray ionization mass spectrometry before storage at –20 °C at a concentration of 2 mm in water. The following peptides were synthesized: sp-CC2 (253LEDLRQQLQQAEEALVAKQELIDKLKEEAEQHKIV287-NH2) and sp-LZ in which the putative leucine zipper began at Leu315 (underlined) (294LKAQADIYKADFQAERHAREKLVEKKEYLQEQLEQLQREFNKL336-NH2). In addition, a LZ peptide variant was synthesized with an N-terminal penetratin extension (underlined) and with an extra cysteine incorporated at the N terminus (CRQIKIWFQNRRMKWKKLKAQADIYKADFQAERHAREKLVEKKEYLQEQLEQLQREFNKL336-NH2). BODIPY®FL N-(2-aminoethyl)maleimide fluorophore (Molecular Probes) was conjugated to the SH group of its N-terminal cysteine in the presence of equimolar amounts of peptide and fluorophore in 50 mm ammonium acetate buffer, pH 6, for 30 min in the dark. The mixture was then loaded onto a Nucleoprep 20 μm C18 100-Å preparative column to remove free fluorophore. This BODIPY-labeled peptide was named Bp-LZ. Purification of Truncated Forms of NEMO Expressed in Escherichia coli—All truncated forms of NEMO were made by PCR mutagenesis using pRSETa/NEMO (1Agou F. Ye F. Goffinont S. Courtois G. Yamaoka S. Israël A. Véron M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 17467-17475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Amplified fragments were digested with NheI and BamHI and cloned into pET-28b or pET-24a (Novagen). Recombinant Y241-E412 (C-ter), Y241-D387 (ΔZF), M251-K337 (CC2-LZ), and M288-K337 (LZ) proteins were verified by sequencing. All His-tagged truncated forms of NEMO contained a 23-residue N-terminal extension (MGSSHHHHHHSSGLVPRGSHMAS), including a site for proteolysis by thrombin (underlined). The C-ter devoid of the His tag, cloned in-frame into pET-24a, contained an extra two residues (Asp-Ser) at its N terminus. With the exception of C-ter, all proteins were produced at 37 °C. His-tagged ΔZF, CC2-LZ, and LZ were purified as in a previous study (1Agou F. Ye F. Goffinont S. Courtois G. Yamaoka S. Israël A. Véron M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 17467-17475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (68) Google Scholar). C-ter was purified from a 2-liter culture of BL21(DE3) cells at 22 °C. The crude extract supernatant was treated with 100 μg of RNase (Roche Applied Science) and 3,500 units of DNase I from bovine pancreas (Roche Applied Science) for 30 min at 37 °C before loading on a Resource S column (6 ml, Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated in Buffer A (50 mm MES, pH 6.0, 0.2 mm DDM, 20 mm NaCl, and 1 mm dithioerythritol), and eluted with a 180-ml 20–1000 mm KCl linear gradient. Fractions containing C-ter NEMO protein according to SDS-PAGE were pooled and dialyzed against 1 liter of Buffer B (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm KCl, 0.2 mm DDM, and 1 mm dithioerythritol). The solution was then applied to a Resource Q column (6 ml, Amersham Biosciences) and the flow-through fractions containing the pure C-ter protein were pooled, concentrated by ultrafiltration (Millipore), and dialyzed extensively against Buffer B before freezing at –80 °C (1.4 mg/ml). Protein concentrations were determined by measuring A280 nm and applying extinction coefficients calculated from their amino acid compositions: 0.142, 0.181, 0.184, and 0.278 unit·mg–1·cm2 for C-ter, ΔZF, CC2-LZ, and LZ polypeptides, respectively. Gel Filtration Analysis—The oligomeric state and apparent Stoke's radius of recombinant proteins and synthetic peptides were determined after 15 h of preincubation at 20 °C by filtration of 500 μl samples on an analytical Superdex 75 column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, buffer containing 200 mm sodium chloride, 0.1 mm DDM, and 1 mm dithioerythritol, developed at 0.5 ml/min. The void volume and the total volume of the column were measured with blue dextran 2000 and dithioerythritol, respectively. Protein elution was expressed as Kav. Depending on loading concentrations, sample elution was followed by measuring A220 nm/280 nm for sp-LZ or A220 nm/250 nm for sp-CC2. When necessary (see Fig. 5), peptides sp-LZ and sp-CC2 (200 μm each) were pre-mixed (20 min) in a denaturing buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 4 m GdmCl, 150 mm KCl, and 1 mm DDM before loading on an analytical Superose 12 HR 10/30 column (Amersham Biosciences). The column was pre-equilibrated in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) containing 200 mm NaCl without GdmCl. Markers included bovine serum albumin (67 kDa, RS = 35.2 Å), ovalbumin (43 kDa, RS = 27.5 Å), chymotrypsinogen (25 kDa, RS = 21.1 Å), ribonuclease A (13.7 kDa, RS = 16.4 Å), cytochrome c (12.4 kDa, RS = 17.1 Å), and aprotinin (6.5 kDa, RS = 12.5 Å). In the case of LZ or sp-LZ, the equilibrium constant of the monomer/dimer equilibrium was determined by integrating the area of the elution peaks. The plot of the square of the monomer concentration versus dimer concentration (0.5–25 μm for LZ and 0.5–200 μm for sp-LZ) yielded a straight line, indicating that the system was at equilibrium. In the experiments with CC2-LZ-, ΔZF-, and C-tertruncated forms of NEMO, the molar fraction of the trimer (xtrimer) at different loading concentrations was estimated according to the formula, (xtrimer=(Kavobs−Kavmonomer)/(Kavtrimer−Kavmonomer)), where (Kavobs) is the partition coefficient of the monomer-trimer mixture at a given loading concentration, and (Kavmonomer) and (Kavtrimer) are the partition coefficients of the monomer and trimer, respectively. Trimeric association constants were then estimated following the equation: KA = xtrimer/[3CT2(1 – xtrimer)3], where CT is the total concentration of the monomeric species. Sedimentation Equilibrium—Sedimentation equilibrium experiments were performed at 20 °C in a Beckman Optima XL-A analytical ultracentrifuge using an An 60-Ti rotor and three cells with two channel centerpieces. Sedimentation was carried out at 25,000, 35,000, 40,000, and 55,000 rpm with 120 μl of 15 μm or 35 μm sp-CC2 in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer at pH 7.3. Lyophilized sp-CC2 was solubilized in phosphate buffer and allowed to equilibrate for 1 h at 20 °C prior to loading. Optical density was measured at 230 nm for optimal signal/background ratio. Equilibrium was verified by superimposing scans recorded at 2-h intervals. When equilibrium was reached, data were collected and centrifugation speed was increased to 55,000 rpm for 16 h to deplete the peptide concentration near the meniscus. The averaged data recorded around the top of the cell were then taken as zero and offset to obtain a baseline correction of the cell. The (ν¯) of sp-CC2, calculated from its amino acid composition, was 0.746 ± 0.005 ml/g, and the calculated density of the buffer was 1.005 g/ml at 20 °C (29Laue T.M. Bhaivari D.S. Ridgeway T.M. Pelletier S.L. Harding S.E. Rowe A.J. Horton J.C. Analytical Ultracentrifugation in Biochemistry and Polymer Science. Royal Society of Chemistry, Cambridge, UK1992: 90-125Google Scholar). Data were fitted with one, two, or multispecies models as described previously (30Johnson M. Straume M. Schuster T.M. Laue T. Modern Analytical Ultracentrifugation. Birkhauser Boston, Inc., Cambridge, MA1994: 37-65Crossref Google Scholar, 31Agou F. Waller J.P. Mirande M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29295-29303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Inclusion of a second virial coefficient never improved the fit. Fluorescence Anisotropy—Anisotropy was measured with a PTI Quantamaster fluorometer equipped with polarizers for the excitation and emission beams using a photomultiplier tube in the L-configuration. All experiments were carried out in a 1-cm path length cuvette at 22 °C with excitation and emission wavelengths of 495 nm and 520 nm, respectively. The bandpasses of the excitation and emission monochromators were set at 2 and 4 nm, respectively. Steady-state fluorescence anisotropy, expressed in millianisotropy units, was calculated according to the equation, A = (IVV – GIVH)/(IVV + 2GIVH), where A is anisotropy, G = IHV/IHH is a correction factor for wavelength-dependent distortion, and I is the fluorescence intensity component. Experiments were performed at least twice, and each point is the result of 20 recordings taken during a 2-min period. All measurements were carried out in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer at pH 8 containing 150 mm KCl. We verified that the filter effect was negligible at the Bp-LZ concentration used (0.1 μm). The Bp-LZ peptide was preincubated at 22 °C alone or with increasing concentrations (1–125 μm) of sp-CC2 prior to anisotropy readings. The dissociation constant was estimated by fitting the anisotropy data to the binding isotherm equation using Kaleidagraph non-linear regression software (Synergy Software, Reading PA) as described previously (32Agou F. Raveh S. Mesnildrey S. Veron M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19630-19638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Both the CC2 and LZ Domains Are Essential to Restore LPS-induced NF-κB Activity in NEMO-deficient 1.3E2 Cells— The murine pre-B cell mutant 1.3E2 not expressing NEMO does not respond to LPS activation (6Yamaoka S. Courtois G. Bessia C. Whiteside S.T. Weil R. Agou F. Kirk H.E. Kay R.J. Israël A. Cell. 1998; 93: 1231-1240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (942) Google Scholar, 26Courtois G. Whiteside S.T. Sibley C.H. Israël A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1441-1449Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These cells were transiently co-transfected with an NF-κB-dependent construct (Igκ-luciferase) and plasmids bearing wild-type or mutant nemo cDNAs. When mock co-transfected with an empty vector and the reporter plasmid, the cells remained non-responsive (Fig. 1A, lane 1). Unlike when co-transfected with the wild-type nemo gene (Fig. 1A, lane 2), cells did not recover LPS-dependent luciferase activity when transfected with a nemo cDNA deleted of the region coding for part of the CC2 domain (Fig. 1A, lane 3). The LZ domain is predicted to form a coiled-coil motif with the hydrophobic residues of the heptad repeat located at the coiled-coil interface (33Vinson C. Myakishev M. Acharya A. Mir A.A. Moll J.R. Bonovich M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 6321-6335Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). Thus, the substitution of Leu322 and Leu329, which are located at these positions by polar residues (Ser), is likely to destabilize the LZ coiled-coil interactions. Indeed, the L322S/L329S mutant of the LZ domain was also not responsive (Fig. 1A, lane 4). Stable transfections with wild-type nemo or with mutant nemo cDNAs were also performed. The nuclear extracts were analyzed by a gel retardation assay after LPS stimulation. Transfection with a plasmid coding for the L322S/L329S mutant (Fig. 1B, EMSA, lane LZ Mut) generated considerably less DNA-binding activity than transfection with wild-type nemo cDNA (Fig. 1B, EMSA, lane WT) or in the parental 70Z/3 cells (Fig. 1B, EMSA, lane 70Z/3). As shown by Western blots, the level of the proteins was similar in the parental 70Z/3 cells and in transfected 1.3E2 cells (Fig. 1B, WB), ruling out the possibility that the pathway was inhibited by overexpression of mutant HA-NEMO. Purification of Recombinant NEMO Subdomains Expressed in E. coli—Fig. 2A shows the C-ter protein of the His-tagged recombinant NEMO construct and the synthetic peptides corresponding to the various domains of the C-terminal half of NEMO used in this study. All NEMO subdomain constructs (ΔZF, CC2-LZ, and LZ) were expressed as soluble proteins in E. coli at 37 °C, with the exception of the C-ter protein, which had to be produced at 22 °C to obtain a soluble protein. The minor component of the ΔZF doublet corresponds to a proteolyzed protein as shown by Western blots using anti-His tag and anti-NEMO C-ter antibodies and by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (data not shown). The apparent molecular weights of the four recombinant fragments purified to homogeneity (Fig. 2B) were in agreement with their calculated molecular weights. Role of C-terminal Subdomains in NEMO Oligomerization— The ΔZF-truncated protein (241–387) was compared with the entire C-ter protein by size exclusion chromatography.

Chk1 is essential for mammalian development and viability, and has been shown to be important for both S and G(2) checkpoints. We now present evidence that the HTLV-1 Tax protein interacts directly with Chk1 and impairs its kinase activities in vitro and in vivo. The direct and physical interaction of Chk1 and Tax was observed in HTLV-1-infected T cells (C81, HuT 102 and MT-2) and transfected fibroblasts (293 T) by coimmunoprecipitation and by in vitro GST pull-down assays. Interestingly, Tax inhibited the kinase activity of Chk1 protein in in vitro and in vivo kinase assays. Consistent with these results, Tax inhibited the phosphorylation-dependent degradation of Cdc25A and G(2) arrest in response to gamma-irradiation (IR) in a dose-dependent manner in vivo. The G(2) arrest did not require Chk2 or p53. These studies provide the first example of a viral transforming protein targeting Chk1 and provide important insights into checkpoint pathway regulation."

https://openalex.org/W2026761013,"Interactions between Eph receptors and their membrane-bound ligands (ephrins) are of critical importance for key developmental processes such as boundary formation or vascular development. Their downstream signaling pathways are intricate and heterogeneous at several levels, the combined effect being a highly complex and flexible system. Here we demonstrate that activated EphB1 induces tyrosine phosphorylation of the focal adhesion protein paxillin at Tyr-31 and Tyr-118 and is recruited to paxillin-focal adhesion kinase (FAK) complexes. Pretreatment with the specific Src inhibitor PP2, or expression of dominant-negative, kinase-dead c-Src abrogates EphB1-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin. Cells transfected with the paxillin mutant Y31F/Y118F displayed a reduced migration in response to ephrin B2 stimulation. Furthermore, expression of an LD4 deletion mutant (paxillin ΔLD4) significantly reduces EphB1-paxillin association, paxillin tyrosine phosphorylation, as well as EphB1-dependent cell migration. Finally, mutation of the Nck-binding site of EphB1 (Y594F) interrupts the interaction between Nck, paxillin, and EphB1. These data suggest a model in which ligand-activated EphB1 forms a signaling complex with Nck, paxillin, and focal adhesion kinase and induces tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin in a c-Src-dependent manner to promote cell migration.

These data suggest a model in which ligand-activated EphB1 forms a signaling complex with Nck, paxillin, and focal adhesion kinase and induces tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin in a c-Src-dependent manner to promote cell migration. The Eph family of receptor tyrosine kinases and their membrane-bound ligands, the ephrins, are key regulators of several developmental processes, including cell migration, boundary formation, axonal guidance, synaptogenesis, and angiogenesis. Both receptor- and ligand-initiated signals mediate repulsion, adhesion, and de-adhesion mechanisms involved in the motility of adherent cells. After activation by their cognate ligands, Eph receptors are phosphorylated at specific tyrosine residues in the cytoplasmic domain, thus displaying new docking sites for known signaling molecules. Indeed, a variety of Src homology domain (SH2/SH3)-containing proteins have been identified as Eph receptor-binding partners, including the adaptor proteins Nck, Grb10, Grb7, SHEP-1, SLAP, the low molecular weight phosphotyrosine phosphatase LMW-PTP, the tyrosine kinases Crk, Fyn, and Src, the phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase, and the Ras GTPase-activating protein (reviewed in Ref. 1Mellitzer G. Xu Q. Wilkinson D.G. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2000; 10: 400-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Furthermore, PDZ-binding motifs located at the C terminus of the Eph receptors bind PDZ domain containing proteins such as AF6, Ryk (an RTK-interacting protein), Pick1, syntenin, and the two glutamate receptor-interacting proteins, Grip1 and Grip2 (2Contractor A. Rogers C. Maron C. Henkemeyer M. Swanson G.T. Heinemann S.F. Science. 2002; 296: 1864-1869Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Importantly, many of the proteins identified in the Eph signaling pathways have been implicated in the regulation of cell morphology, adhesion, and motility. Activation of Eph receptors and ephrins has been shown to affect cell attachment by means of integrin and focal adhesion protein-dependent mechanisms, but contradictory results have been described for the interplay between these systems. In previous works, we showed that EphB1 receptor regulates integrin-dependent cell adhesion through activation of c-Jun kinase by means of Nck-interacting Ste20 kinase (NIK) 1The abbreviations used are: NIK, Nck-interacting Ste20 kinase; FAK, focal adhesion kinase; ERK, extracellular signal related kinase; HA, hemagglutinin; HRMEC, human renal microvascular endothelial cells; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary. in endothelial and neuronal cells (3Huynh-Do U. Stein E. Lane A.A. Liu H. Cerretti D.P. Daniel T.O. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2165-2173Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Becker E. Huynh-Do U. Holland S. Pawson T. Daniel T.O. Skolnik E.Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1537-1545Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Subsequently, Miao et al. (5Miao H. Burnett E. Kinch M. Simon E. Wang B. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 62-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar) showed that stimulation of EphA2 receptor with soluble ephrin A1 ligand results in an inhibition of integrin function and cell adhesion. However Carter et al. (6Carter N. Nakamoto T. Hirai H. Hunter T. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 565-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) demonstrated that ephrin A1 induces cell adhesion and actin cytoskeletal changes in fibroblasts in a focal adhesion kinase (FAK)-dependent and p130cas-dependent manner through activation of EphA2 receptor. Furthermore, activation of ephrinA5 in transfected NIH-3T3 cells enhanced cell adhesion and formation of focal adhesions (7Davy A. Robbins S.M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5396-5405Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). More recently, we demonstrated that ligand-activated EphB1 forms a signaling complex with c-Src kinase and p52Shc adaptor protein to promote extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK)1/2 activation and chemotaxis (8Vindis C. Cerretti D.P. Daniel T.O. Huynh-Do U. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 661-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Because cell migration is a highly coordinated process involving continuous re-organization of the cell cytoskeleton, we hypothesized that molecules involved in focal adhesion signaling represent potential targets for activated EphB1. In this study, we provide evidence that ligand-stimulated EphB1 associates with the focal adhesion proteins paxillin and FAK and induces their tyrosine phosphorylation. Furthermore, c-Src-mediated paxillin phosphorylation at Tyr-31 and Tyr-118 is required for EphB1-induced cell migration. In addition, we show that the paxillin LD4 motif and the Nck-binding site of EphB1 (Tyr-594) are necessary for EphB1-paxillin interaction. Expression of an LD4 deletion mutant (paxillin ΔLD4) decreases tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin at Tyr-31 and Tyr-118, as well as cell migration in response to EphB1 stimulation. Based on these data, we propose a model in which the concerted actions of EphB1, Nck, and paxillin regulate cell migration in an Src-dependent manner. Reagents—Cell culture reagents and fibronectin were obtained from Invitrogen AG (Basel, Switzerland); ephrin B2/Fc was obtained from Amgen (Seattle, WA). Control human IgG1 and suramin were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Chemie (Steinheim, Germany), and PP2 and PP3 were obtained from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA). The following antibodies were used: rabbit anti-paxillin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), phosphospecific anti-pTyr-31-paxillin and anti-pTyr-118-paxillin (BIOSOURCE, Camarillo, CA), monoclonal anti-Nck and anti-FAK (Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY), goat anti-EphB1 (R & D Systems, Minneapolis, MN), monoclonal anti-hemagglutinin (HA) (12CA5; Roche Applied Science), polyclonal anti-active mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK; Promega, Madison, WI), and anti-ERK1/2 and anti-phosphotyrosine 4G10-HRP (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY). ECL chemoluminescence kit and ECL phosphorylation module anti-phosphotyrosine horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugate were obtained from Amersham (Buckinghamshire, UK). Cell Culture and Transfection—P19 cells were cultured in α-minimum Eagle's medium (MEM) with 10% fetal calf serum; primary human renal microvascular endothelial cells (HRMEC) were isolated and cultured as described (11Stein E.

Chinese hamster ovary (CHO)-EphB1 cells expressing HA-tagged EphB1 receptor have been described previously (8Vindis C. Cerretti D.P. Daniel T.O. Huynh-Do U. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 661-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) and were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium-F12 with 10% fetal calf serum containing Zeocin (Invitrogen AG). For transient transfections, CHO cells were seeded onto 100-mm plates and incubated in culture medium for 24 h before transfection. Cells were transfected using LipofectAMINE Plus with the plasmids encoding vector, wild-type paxillin, paxillin LD4 or LD2 deletion mutants (paxillin ΔLD4 or paxillin ΔLD2) (9West K.A. Zhang H.

Lentz D. Turner C.E. Thiery J.P. Valles A.M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 957-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). The EphB1 plasmids and dominant-negative Src have been described previously (8Vindis C. Cerretti D.P. Daniel T.O. Huynh-Do U. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 661-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Cotransfection of the plasmid enhanced green fluorescent protein (pEGFP) was used at 1 μg/100-mm plate as a marker of transfection efficiency (about 70%). Cells were used for biochemical or functional assays 48 h later. Western Blotting and Immunoprecipitation—Cells were serum-starved for 24 h (P19, HRMEC) or 48 h (CHO-EphB1) in Opti-MEM and then stimulated for the indicated times at 37 °C with 0.5–1 μg ml–1 of ephrin B2/Fc as described previously (8Vindis C. Cerretti D.P. Daniel T.O. Huynh-Do U. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 661-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). For assessment of ERK1/2 activation and paxillin phosphorylation, cells were lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer, and 40 μg of proteins were loaded on an SDS-10% PAGE. After transfer to Immobilon/polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA), the membranes were blocked 1% in bovine serum albumin. Phosphorylated ERK1/2 was detected with phosphospecific anti-phospho MAPK, whereas tyrosine-phosphorylated paxillin was detected with antibodies specifically recognizing phosphorylated Tyr-31 and Tyr-118 of paxillin. Membranes were stripped and reprobed with anti-ERK1/2 and anti-paxillin antibodies, respectively. For co-immunoprecipitations, cells were lysed in buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm NaF, 5 mm EDTA, 60 mmN-octyl-glucoside, 0.1% SDS supplemented with 1 mm orthovanadate and protease inhibitors. Immunoprecipitations were performed with the indicated antibodies for 2 h at 4 °C as described previously (11Stein E. Huynh-Do U. Lane A.A. Cerretti D.P. Daniel T.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1303-1308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Cell Migration—For migration assays, a modified Boyden chamber system was used as described previously (8Vindis C. Cerretti D.P. Daniel T.O. Huynh-Do U. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 661-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Briefly, serum-starved cells were resuspended in Opti-MEM and seeded on fibronectin-coated Transwell inserts with 8-μm pore size membranes (Costar, Corning, NY). 1–2 μg ml–1 clustered ephrin B2/Fc was added to the lower chamber, and then cells were allowed to migrate for 6 h at 37 °C. Non-migrating cells were removed with a cotton swab, and migrated cells were fixed with glutaraldehyde, stained with 0.5% crystal violet, and then eluted with acetic acid. Cell migration was quantified by a spectrophotometric reading at A570. Ligand-activated EphB1 Induces Phosphorylation of Paxillin at Tyr-31 and Tyr-118 —Cell movement requires a cytoskeletal re-organization involving phosphorylation of cytoskeleton-associated tyrosine kinases and the formation of focal adhesions. Because of the key role of EphB1 receptor in cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions, we anticipated that EphB1 activation would not only induce integrin “inside-out” activation (3Huynh-Do U. Stein E. Lane A.A. Liu H. Cerretti D.P. Daniel T.O. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2165-2173Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but that it would also affect focal adhesion complexes. In the present study, using two well established cellular systems expressing EphB1 (8Vindis C. Cerretti D.P. Daniel T.O. Huynh-Do U. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 661-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 12Han D.C. Shen T.L. Miao H. Wang B. Guan J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45655-45661Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), we found that paxillin, a focal adhesion-associated docking protein, was tyrosine phosphorylated in response to EphB1 stimulation. Time-course analysis showed that this was an early event, beginning as soon as 5 min after exposure to ephrin B2/Fc and lasting for at least 60 min (Fig. 1A). Using phosphospecific antibodies, we furthermore demonstrated that EphB1 induces paxillin phosphorylation at Tyr-31 and Tyr-118 (Fig. 1B), two tyrosine residues which have been shown to play an important role in cell migration in various cancer cell lines (10Petit V. Boyer B. Lentz D. Turner C.E. Thiery J.P. Valles A.M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 957-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 13Tsubouchi A. Sakakura J. Yagi R. Mazaki Y. Schaefer E. Yano H. Sabe H. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 673-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). EphB1 Associates with Paxillin and Promotes Tyrosine Phosphorylation of FAK—Because paxillin can be phosphorylated either by c-Src directly or through the intermediary of FAK (reviewed in Ref. 14Schaller M.D. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 6459-6472Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar), we next assessed the phosphorylation status of FAK. Upon EphB1 activation, FAK also exhibited an increased tyrosine phosphorylation, although to a lesser degree than paxillin, beginning 15 min after exposure and lasting for 30–60 min (Fig. 2A). Moreover, ephrin/B2-stimulation of EphB1 led to the recruitment of paxillin to EphB1-signaling complexes, concomitantly to the tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin. We also found the protein FAK in paxillin immunocomplexes after EphB1 stimulation (Fig. 2B). EphB1-induced Paxillin Phosphorylation at Tyr-31/Tyr-118 Requires c-Src Activity and Is Necessary for Cell Migration—We showed previously (8Vindis C. Cerretti D.P. Daniel T.O. Huynh-Do U. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 661-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) that ligand-activated EphB1 recruits c-Src and induces its active conformation by phosphorylation of Tyr-418. We also linked c-Src activation to two important biological endpoints: EphB1-dependent ERK activation and chemotaxis. Because Src family kinases are also implicated in regulating paxillin phosphorylation, we next investigated the potential role of the EphB1/c-Src signaling complex in promoting tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin. Indeed, we observed that paxillin tyrosine phosphorylation clearly decreased when cells were pretreated with the Src tyrosine kinase inhibitor PP2 (Fig. 3A), but not with control PP3 (data not shown). We confirmed these inhibition studies by performing dominant-negative experiments: transfection of CHO-EphB1 with dominant-negative, kinase-dead c-Src clearly reduced paxillin phosphorylation (Fig. 3B). Taken together, these data demonstrate that c-Src kinase activity is essential for the EphB1-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin. Finally, to address the role of paxillin phosphorylation in EphB1-mediated cell migration, we overexpressed a Y31F/Y118F paxillin mutant in CHO-EphB1. We showed a 40% reduction in cell migratory behavior as compared with vector-transfected cells (Fig. 3C). To study this effect in a cellular system endogenously expressing EphB1, we transfected the same mutant into P19 cells: we saw a similar, although weaker effect on cell migration (30% reduction, data not shown). However, the transfection efficiency in P19 was only around 40%. Together these findings show that in CHO-EphB1 and P19 cells, paxillin tyrosine phosphorylation is required for proper cell migration. EphB1-paxillin Interaction Is Mediated by Nck and Requires the LD4 Motif of Paxillin—Paxillin contains a number of motifs that mediate protein-protein interactions, including multiple SH2- and SH3-binding domains that mediate association with the Crk, Src, and Csk families, four LIM domains that target paxillin to focal adhesions, and five leucine-rich sequences with the consensus LDXLLXXL (termed LD motifs). These paxillin LD motifs mediate interactions with several structural and regulatory proteins that are important for coordinating changes in the actin cytoskeleton associated with cell motility and cell adhesion (reviewed in Refs. 14Schaller M.D. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 6459-6472Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar and 15Turner C.E. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: E231-E236Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar). Transfection of CHO-EphB1 with an LD4 deletion mutant (paxillin ΔLD4) clearly reduced the association between activated EphB1 and paxillin, as well as the level of paxillin phosphorylation at Tyr-31 and Tyr-118 (Fig. 4A). Moreover, paxillin ΔLD4 showed a reduced cell migration in response to ephrin B2 stimulation (Fig. 4B). Interestingly, overexpressing a paxillin LD2 deletion mutant (paxillin ΔLD2) lacking an important FAK-binding site (9West K.A. Zhang H. Brown M.C. Nikolopoulos S.N. Riedy M.C. Horwitz A.F. Turner C.E. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 161-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) did not inhibit EphB1-induced cell migration, nor did it disrupt the EphB1-paxillin association. This finding is in keeping with previous studies (9West K.A. Zhang H. Brown M.C. Nikolopoulos S.N. Riedy M.C. Horwitz A.F. Turner C.E. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 161-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) and suggests that in the present cellular systems, FAK is not a key player in EphB1-directed cell migration, although it is phosphorylated by and associates with EphB1. Analysis of the EphB1 sequence did not reveal any known paxillin-binding subdomain (16Nikolopoulos S.N. Turner C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23499-23505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). However, we previously showed that EphB1 binds to the adaptor protein Nck through its Tyr-594 residue (11Stein E. Huynh-Do U. Lane A.A. Cerretti D.P. Daniel T.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1303-1308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Also, the LD4 motif of paxillin has been shown to bind a protein complex containing PAK, Nck, two members of the Cdc42/Rac guanine nucleotide exchange factor, and a multidomain ARF-GAP protein, p95PKL (paxillin-kinase linker; Ref. 17Turner C.E. Brown M.C. Perrotta J.A. Riedy M.C. Nikolopoulos S.N. McDonald A.R. Bagrodia S. Thomas S. Leventhal P.S. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 851-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). Therefore, we hypothesized that the interaction between EphB1 and paxillin could be mediated by Nck. Indeed, we could demonstrate a direct interaction between ligand-activated EphB1, Nck, and paxillin not only in CHO-EphB1, but also in P19 and primary HRMEC (3Huynh-Do U. Stein E. Lane A.A. Liu H. Cerretti D.P. Daniel T.O. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2165-2173Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Vindis C. Cerretti D.P. Daniel T.O. Huynh-Do U. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 661-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 11Stein E. Huynh-Do U. Lane A.A. Cerretti D.P. Daniel T.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1303-1308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) expressing endogenously EphB1 (Fig. 4C). Furthermore, mutation of the Nck-binding site of EphB1 (Y594F) clearly abrogated the EphB1-paxillin interaction (Fig. 4D), whereas overexpression of other EphB1 mutants (mutations Y929F of the Grb10-binding site (see Fig. 4D) or Y778F of the Shc-binding site of EphB1 (data not shown)) had no effect on EphB1-paxillin association. In this study, we provide evidence that tyrosine phosphorylation of two major phosphorylation sites of the adaptor protein paxillin plays a central role in EphB1-mediated cell migration. We show that activated EphB1 induces the phosphorylation of Tyr-31 and Tyr-118 residues of paxillin in a c-Src-dependent manner. Paxillin becomes phosphorylated on tyrosine in response to various receptor tyrosine kinases, including platelet-derived growth factor, epidermal growth factor, and nerve growth factor (14Schaller M.D. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 6459-6472Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). Recently, Carter et al. (6Carter N. Nakamoto T. Hirai H. Hunter T. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 565-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) identified EphA2, FAK, and p130cas as the most heavily tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins in NIH-3T3 cells plated on ephrin A1-coated surface. The authors also showed that paxillin too was inducibly phosphorylated in response to ephrin A1 stimulation. However, because paxillin was not the major ephrin A-dependent phosphotyrosyl protein, they did not further characterize the phosphorylated tyrosine residues. Our findings suggest that, in contrast to EphA2 signaling, ligand-activated EphB1 preferentially targets paxillin at Tyr-31 and Tyr-118. Importantly, expression of a paxillin mutant lacking these two important phosphorylation sites resulted in a reduced migration in response to ephrin B2 stimulation. To date, the role of Tyr-31/Tyr-118 on cell motility has been quite controversial: Yano et al. (18Yano H. Uchida H. Iwasaki T. Mukai M. Akedo H. Nakamura K. Hashimoto S. Sabe H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9076-9081Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) showed that in MM1 hepatoma cells, a paxillin mutant with substitutions of the four tyrosine phosphorylation sites of paxillin had no effect on cell invasive behavior. In contrast, Petit et al. (10Petit V. Boyer B. Lentz D. Turner C.E. Thiery J.P. Valles A.M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 957-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar) demonstrated that in NBT-II bladder carcinoma cells, expression of Tyr-31/Tyr-118 paxillin impaired cell motility on collagen by ∼50%. More recently, Tsubouchi et al. (13Tsubouchi A. Sakakura J. Yagi R. Mazaki Y. Schaefer E. Yano H. Sabe H. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 673-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) showed that paxillin Tyr-31/Tyr-118 were essential for efficient membrane spreading and ruffling during adhesion and migration of NmuMG cells. Differences in the cellular context or the experimental design may account for these disparate results. In an effort to dissect the molecular mechanisms underlying the interaction between EphB1 and paxillin, we performed another series of dominant-negative experiments. We demonstrated that kinase active c-Src is necessary for the tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin in response to EphB1 stimulation. We confirmed these results by performing pharmacological inhibition experiments with the Src-specific inhibitor PP2. These findings highlight a new aspect of the role of c-Src in EphB1 signaling. Indeed, in a recent publication (8Vindis C. Cerretti D.P. Daniel T.O. Huynh-Do U. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 661-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), we showed that EphB1 associates with the adaptor protein p52Shc and activates the MAPK/ERK pathway in a c-Src-dependent manner. Furthermore, expression of dominant-negative, kinase-dead c-Src inhibited EphB1-dependent cell adhesion and migration. The data presented here suggest that in addition to MAPK activation, c-Src also regulates EphB1-dependent chemotaxis through tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin. Finally, we showed that, not only in CHO-EphB1, but also in P19 and primary human renal microvascular endothelial cells, ligand-activated EphB1 forms a complex with Nck and paxillin. This interaction was interrupted by the expression of either a paxillin ΔLD4 deletion mutant or of Y594F-EphB1 lacking the Nck-binding site. Taken together, these experiments strongly suggest that EphB1 indirectly associates with paxillin through the intermediary of the adaptor protein Nck and the LD4 motif of paxillin. In conclusion, we have made the novel observation that EphB1 induces tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin at Tyr-31 and Tyr-118 in a c-Src-dependent manner. Furthermore, ligand-activated EphB1 builds a complex with Nck, paxillin, and FAK in an interaction requiring Tyr-594 of EphB1 and the LD4 motif of paxillin. The concerted actions of EphB1, Nck, and paxillin, in turn, appear to play a significant role in EphB1-mediated cell migration (Fig. 5). Because paxillin has been shown to bind in vitro and in vivo to the cytoplasmic part of integrins (14Schaller M.D. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 6459-6472Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar), our results suggest that paxillin itself may be an integrating element linking EphB1 to inside-out integrin activation. Furthermore, paxillin undergoes extensive tyrosine phosphorylation in the developing chick embryo (15Turner C.E. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: E231-E236Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar), which raises the interesting possibility that it could play an important role in coordinating cell migration and tissue remodelling in the embryo in response to Ephephrin interactions. Elucidating the molecular mechanisms linking EphB1-mediated paxillin phosphorylation to integrin inside-out signaling will be the subject of future studies. We thank Drs.

https://openalex.org/W2046010877,"Elevated Src protein levels and activity are associated with the development and progression of a variety of cancers. The consequences of deregulated Src activity have been studied extensively in cell culture; however, the effects of this deregulation in vivo, as well as the mechanisms of Src-induced tumorigenesis, remain poorly understood. In this study, the effect of expressing wild-type and constitutively active Drosophila Src-family kinases (SFKs) in the developing eye was examined. Overexpression of either wild-type Drosophila SFK (Src64 and Src42) is sufficient to induce ectopic proliferation in G1/G0-arrested, uncommitted cells in eye imaginal discs. In addition, both kinases trigger apoptosis in vivo, in a dosage-dependent manner. Constitutively active mutants are hypermorphic as they trigger proliferation and death more potently than their wild-type counterparts. Moreover, SFK-induced proliferation and apoptosis are largely independent events, as blocking ectopic proliferation does not block cell death. Further, DCsk (the Drosophila homolog of the C-terminal Src kinase) phosphorylates and interacts genetically with the wild-type SFKs, but not with the constitutively active mutants in which a conserved C-terminal tyrosine was mutated to phenylalanine, providing the first in vivo evidence that Csk regulates SFKs during development through phosphorylation of their C-terminal tyrosine."

https://openalex.org/W2144392973,"The insect steroid hormone 20-hydroxyecdysone works through a ligand-activated nuclear receptor, the ecdysone receptor (EcR), which plays critical roles in insect development and reproduction. The EcR has been exploited to develop insecticides to control pests and gene switches for gene regulation. Recently reported crystal structures of the EcR protein show different but partially overlapping binding cavities for ecdysteroid (ECD) and diacylhydrazine (DAH) ligands, providing an explanation for the differential activity of DAH ligands in insects. 1-Aroyl-4-(arylamino)-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinoline (THQ) ligands were recently discovered as ecdysone agonists. Mutagenesis of the EcR (from Choristoneura fumiferana, CfEcR) ligand binding domain followed by screening in a reporter assay led to the identification of CfEcR mutants, which responded well to THQ ligands but poorly to both ECD and DAH ligands. These mutants were further improved by introducing a second mutation, A110P, which was previously reported to cause ECD insensitivity. Testing of these V128F/A110P and V128Y/A110P mutants in a C57BL/6 mouse model coactivator interaction assay and in insect cells showed that this mutant EcR is activated by THQ ligands but not by ECD or DAH ligands. The CfEcR and its V128F/A110P mutant were used to demonstrate simultaneous regulation of two reporter genes using THQ and DAH ligands.

Cherbas P. Truman J.W. Vitam. Horm. 2000; 60: 1-73Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The effects of 20E are mediated through a ligand-activated nuclear receptor, the Ecdysone receptor (EcR) (2Koelle M.R. Talbot W.S. Segraves W.A. Bender M.T. Cherbas P. Hogness D.S. Cell. 1991; 67: 59-77Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar). Like many nuclear receptors EcR has five modular domains, the A/B (ligand-independent transactivation), C (DNA binding and heterodimerization), D (hinge, heterodimerization), E (ligand binding, heterodimerization, and transactivation), and F (transactivation) (2Koelle M.R. Talbot W.S. Segraves W.A. Bender M.T. Cherbas P. Hogness D.S. Cell. 1991; 67: 59-77Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar). The EcR heterodimerizes with another nuclear receptor, ultraspiracle (USP), a homologue of vertebrate RXR (3Thomas H.E. Stunnenberg H.G. Stewart A.F. Nature. 1993; 362: 471-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar, 4Yao T.P. Forman B.M. Jiang Z. Cherbas L. Chen J.D. McKeown M. Cherbas P. Evans R.M.

Cell. 1992; 71: 63-72Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar). The EcR/USP heterodimers are able to bind to ecdysone response elements (EcRE) present in the promoters of 20E-responsive genes. The binding of ligands to EcR and the subsequent activation of 20E-responsive genes are greatly stimulated by the formation of a functional heterodimer. The EcR gene encodes three isoforms, EcR-A, EcR-B1, and EcR-B2, that contribute to the tissue specificity of 20E response (6Talbot W.S. Swyryd E.A. Hogness D.S. Cell. 1993; 73: 1323-1337Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). In addition to 20E, several phytoecdysteroids such as ponasterone (PonA) and muristerone A bind to EcR with high affinity. The crystal structure of USP has been elucidated by two groups (7Billas I.M. Moulinier L. Rochel N. Moras D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7465-7474Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 8Clayton G.M. Peak-Chew S.Y. Evans R.M. Schwabe J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1549-1554Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The structure of USP is similar to its mammalian homologue RXR, except that USP structures showed a long H1-H3 loop and an insert between H5 and H6. These structures appear to lock USP in an inactive conformation by displacing helix 12 from the agonist conformation. In addition, in both crystal structures USP has a large hydrophobic cavity that contains phospholipid ligands (7Billas I.M. Moulinier L. Rochel N. Moras D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7465-7474Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 8Clayton G.M. Peak-Chew S.Y. Evans R.M. Schwabe J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1549-1554Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The crystal structures of the EcR protein were determined recently and showed different but partially overlapping binding cavities for ecdysteroid (ECD) and diacylhydrazine (DAH) ligands, providing an explanation for the differential activity of DAH ligands in insects (9Billas I.M. Iwema T. Garnier J.M. Mitschler A. Rochel N. Moras D. Nature. 2003; 426: 91-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Similar to vertebrate nuclear receptors, the EcR is presumed to recruit coregulators such as corepressors and coactivators in the process of transcriptional activation of 20E-responsive genes. EcR-specific coactivator Taiman protein was shown to colocalize with EcR and USP in the border cells of Drosophila melanogaster and to augment transcriptional activity by EcR in cultured cells (10Bai J. Uehara Y. Montell D.J. Cell. 2000; 103: 1047-1058Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). An EcR-interacting protein, SMRTER, which is functionally similar to vertebrate corepressors of nuclear receptors, SMRT and N-CoR, was identified in D. melanogaster (11Tsai C.C. Kao H.Y. Yao T.P. McKeown M. Evans R.M. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 175-186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). The diacylhydrazine class of synthetic nonsteroidal ligands discovered by the Rohm & Haas Co. as potential insecticides are capable of binding to EcR and activating 20E-responsive genes (12Dhadialla T.S. Carlson G.R. Le D.P. Annu. Rev. Entomol. 1998; 43: 545-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar). Some of these compounds bind to EcR with high affinity and initiate a premature molt that leads to mortality of larvae in lepidopteran and coleopteran insects (13Carlson G.R. Dhadialla T.S. Hunter R. Jansson R.K. Jany C.S. Lidert Z. Slawecki R.A. Pest Manag Sci. 2001; 57: 115-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). These compounds are not toxic to other insects and appear to be harmless to vertebrates (13Carlson G.R. Dhadialla T.S. Hunter R. Jansson R.K. Jany C.S. Lidert Z. Slawecki R.A. Pest Manag Sci. 2001; 57: 115-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The differences in the activity of DAH ligands in insects belonging to various orders has been attributed to the differential uptake of compounds in to the cells and differences in EcR sequences (12Dhadialla T.S. Carlson G.R. Le D.P. Annu. Rev. Entomol. 1998; 43: 545-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar, 14Sundaram M. Palli S.R. Krell P.J. Sohi S.S. Dhadialla T.S. Retnakaran A. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1998; 28: 693-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Homology models of EcR predicted that ECD and DAH ligands will occupy different but substantially overlapping regions of a ligand binding cavity (15Kasuya A. Sawada Y. Tsukamoto Y. Tanaka K. Toya T.

Recent determination of crystal structures of EcR showed different but only partially overlapping ligand binding cavities for ECD and DAH ligands (9Billas I.M. Iwema T. Garnier J.M. Mitschler A. Rochel N. Moras D. Nature. 2003; 426: 91-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Several other classes of non-steroidal ecdysone agonists belonging to different chemotypes have since been developed (12Dhadialla T.S. Carlson G.R. Le D.P. Annu. Rev.

The 1-aroyl-4-(arylamino)-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinoline (THQ) ligand class was identified by FMC Corp. using EcRs from D. melanogaster, Heliothis virescens, or Plodia interpunctata in a cell-based assay (21Dixson J.A.

The University of Delaware, Newark, DE2000Google Scholar). The THQ compounds showed weak insecticidal activity against H. virescens. Several ecdysone THQ analogs have been synthesized and tested for their ability to mediate the transactivation of a reporter gene through EcR from Aedes aegypti (18Smith H.C. Cavanaugh C.K. Friz J.L.

EcR has been used in several inducible gene regulation systems or gene switches to control transgene expression in mammalian cells, transgenic animals, and plants. Several EcR-based gene switches that function through steroid and nonsteroidal ligands have been developed (22No D. Yao T.P. Evans R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 3346-3351Crossref PubMed Scopus (755) Google Scholar, 23Christopherson K.S. Mark M.R. Bajaj V. Godowski P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A. 1998; 95: 7999-8004Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Improvements that increase the sensitivity and magnitude of induction of cognate genes have been made to the EcR-based gene switch. An improved EcR-based gene switch capable of lower background, increased sensitivity, and higher magnitudes of induction was developed (25Palli S.R. Kapitskaya M.Z. Kumar M.B. Cress D.E. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 1308-1315Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Through homology modeling, ligand docking, and mutagenesis followed by screening we have identified two mutants (V128F and V128Y) of EcR from Choristoneura fumiferana (CfEcR) that responded well to THQ but not to ECD or DAH ligands. These mutants were further improved by introducing a second mutation, A110P, which was previously reported to cause ECD insensitivity (17Kumar M.B. Fujimoto T. Potter D.W. Deng Q. Palli S.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 14710-14715Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Other tests showed that the V128Y/A110P double mutant responded to THQ ligand but not to ECD or DAH ligands in vivo in mice. The V128F/A110P mutant recruited the EcR coactivator, Taiman, in the presence of THQ ligand but not ECD or DAH ligands, and this mutant EcR induced the expression of the 20E-responsive hormone receptor 3 (DHR3) gene in D. melanogaster L57 cells only in the presence of THQ ligand but not ECD or DAH ligands. The WTCfEcR and its V128F/A110P mutant were used to demonstrate simultaneous regulation of two reporter genes using THQ and DAH ligands. Muristerone A, ponasterone A (PonA), and 20-hydroxyecdysone were purchased from Alexis Corp. (San Diego, CA). Nonsteroidal ligands RG-102240, also known as gene switch ecdysone (GS™E) (N-(1,1-dimethylethyl)-N′-(2-ethyl-3-methoxybenzoyl)-3,5-dimethylbenzohydrazide), cis-6-fluoro-1-(3-fluoro-4-methylbenzoyl)-4-(4-fluorophenylamino)-2-methyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinoline (RG-120499), cis-6-fluoro-4-(4-fluorophenylamino)-1-(3-fluoro-4-(trifluoromethylbenzoyl)-2-methyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinoline (RG-120768), and cis-1-(4-ethylbenzoyl)-6-fluoro-4-(4-fluorophenylamino)-2-methyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinoline (RG-120929) (all are 1-aroyl-4-(arylamino)-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinolines (THQ)) were synthesized at RheoGene Inc. as described below.

Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out using the QuikChange® site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Mutations were verified by sequencing. 3T3 cells were transfected with G:CfE(DEF), VP:Hs-LmR(EF), and pFRLUC plasmids in 96-well plates using SuperFect lipid reagent (Qiagen), and ligands were administered 4 h post-transfection. The cells were harvested at 40 h after transfection and analyzed for reporter gene activity. L57 cells were transfected using LipofectAMINE 2000 reagent (Invitrogen). Luciferase was measured using the Dual-luciferase™ reporter assay system from Promega Corp. (Madison, WI). β-Galactosidase was measured using the Gal-Screen® system from Applied Biosystems (Bresford, MA). All the transactivation assays were performed in triplicate and were repeated three times. 3T3 cells were transfected with G:CfE(DEF) or its mutants VP:D-mTaiman and pFRLUC. The transfected cells were exposed to 1 μm ligands, and the reporter activity was quantified at 48 h after transfection. The gene switch plasmids were electroporated into the quadriceps of C57BL/6 mice. The animals were anesthetized and shaved, and DNA vector was injected into the muscle. Electrode conductivity gel was applied, and an electrode (1 × 1 cm) was placed on the hind leg and electroporated with 200 V/cm 8 times for 20 ms/pulse at 1-s time intervals. The transverse electrical field direction was reversed after the animals received half of the pulses. Animals were treated with 0–4-mg eq (0–10.5 μmol/mice) of RG-120499, PonA, or RG-102240 in 50 μl of Me2SO by intraperitoneal injection at 3 days after electroporation. The SEAP activity in mouse sera was evaluated at 3 days after ligand administration using Great Escape Chemiluminescence kit (Clontech). The L57 cells from Drosophila were grown in 25-cm2 cell culture flasks using HyQ CCM3 medium (HyClone, Logan, UT). For transfections into L57 cells, cells were seeded into 5-ml culture flasks at a density of 100,000-cells/ml medium. The following day, 3 μg of VP: CfE(CDEF) or its V128F/A110P mutant DNA was transfected with LipofectAMINE 2000 reagent. At 24 h after transfection, a 1 μm concentration of 20E or RG-102240 or RG-120768 was added to the culture medium. At 6 h after addition of ligands, the cells were harvested, quick-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -80 °C. Total RNA was isolated from L57 cells using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen) and treated with DNase I (Ambion, Austin, TX) to remove contaminating genomic DNA. RNA was reverse-transcribed in a total volume of 20 μl with iScript cDNA synthesis kit (Bio-Rad). Aliquots (2.5 μl) of cDNA were added to a 20-μl reaction mixture containing 10 μl of iQSYBR Green supermix (Bio-Rad), 0.25 μm primers. The real-time PCR was performed using DHR3 primers (5′-cgccggcgggacaaaacaact-3′ and 5′-actgcgcggctcgtaggtggtg-3′) and a MyiQ single color real-time PCR detection system (Bio-Rad). The PCR settings were initial incubation at 95 °C for 3 min followed by 45 cycles of denaturation at 95 °C for 10s, annealing at 60 °C for 30s, and elongation at 72 °C for 60s. THQ Ligand Design and Synthesis—The synthesis of some THQs by benzoylation of 1 (Fig. 1A) with various monosubstituted benzoyl chlorides, and their activity as agonists of A. aegypti EcR has been reported previously (20Tice C.M. Hormann R.E. Thompson C.S. Friz J.L. Cavanaugh C.K. Michelotti E.L. Garcia J. Nicolas E. Albericio F. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 2003; 13: 475-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Synthesis of additional analogs bearing one or two substituents on the benzoyl ring led to the discovery of the new compounds RG-120499, RG-120768, and RG-120929, which exhibited improved potency against A. aegypti EcR. These compounds were selected as candidates for screening against CfEcR mutants. In transactivation assays all three compounds induced the reporter activity through V128F or V128Y mutant but not wild type versions of CfEcR. RG-120499 and RG-120929 were synthesized first and used in the initial experiments showed in Figs. 2, A and B, and 3. RG-120768 was synthesized latter and was found to be better than RG-120499 and RG-120929 in inducing reporter activity through V128F or V128Y mutants. Therefore, subsequent experiments reported in Figs. 2C, 4, and 5 used this compound.Fig. 3In vivo comparison of wild type CfEcR or its V128Y/A110P mutant to induce a reporter gene in response to DAH, ECD or THQ ligands. The gene switch, composed of plasmids containing G:CfE(DEF) (A–C) or its V128Y/A110P mutant (D–E), VP:Hs-LmR(EF) and 6xGAL4RE-TTR-SEAP were electroporated into the quadriceps of C57BL/6 mice. Animals were treated with DAH (RG-102240, ECD (PonA), or THQ (RG-120499) ligands in Me2SO by intraperitoneal injection 3 days after the electroporation of plasmids. Ligand equivalence is based on the molecular weight of RG-102240 (1 mg = 2.6 μmol). SEAP in mouse sera was evaluated 3 days after ligand administration.

(n = 4).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Identification of THQ Ligand-specific Val-128 Mutants—Homology modeling of the CfEcR ligand binding domain (LBD) followed by docking of THQ ligand into the binding pocket indicated that valine at position 128 (Val-128) may play an important role in differentiating the binding of THQ as compared with the DAH and ECD chemotypes. We used random primers and site-directed mutagenesis to produce a library of G:CfE(DEF) mutants where the three nucleotides coding for Val-128 have been randomly changed. We screened this library of CfEcR mutants and identified two mutants that responded well to THQ ligands, RG-120499 and RG-120929, but not to the DAH ligand, RG-102240, and the ECD, PonA. Sequencing of the two identified mutants showed that the valine at the128 position was changed to phenylalanine (V128F) and tyrosine (V128Y). This valine residue at position 128 is present in EcRs from lepidopteran insects but not in EcRs from the other insects (Fig. 1B). The two mutants and WT EcRs were tested in the 3T3 cell assay. As shown in Fig. 2A, THQ ligands RG-120499 and RG-120929 did not induce reporter activity with WT CfEcR, whereas the DAH RG-102240 and the ECD PonA did (Fig. 2A). Both RG-120499 and RG-120929 induced reporter activity through V128F and V128Y mutant CfEcRs. RG-102240 and PonA did not induce detectable levels of reporter activity with V128F and V128Y mutant CfEcRs (Fig. 2A). These results from analysis of two mutants and WT CfECR with four ligands showed that the two CfEcR mutants, V128F and V128Y, respond well to THQ ligands but not to ECD and DAH ligands, and they have potential uses in simultaneous regulation of multiple genes. Our previous work showed that the A110P mutation in CfEcR LBD reduced the ECD response, although its DAH activity was unaffected (17Kumar M.B. Fujimoto T. Potter D.W. Deng Q. Palli S.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 14710-14715Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). To determine the affect of this A110P mutation on the THQ-responsive Val-128 CfEcR mutant, we introduced the A110P mutation into the V120F and tested its activity in the 3T3 cell reporter assay. As shown in Fig. 2B, both RG-102240 and PonA but not RG-120929 induced reporter activity with WTCfEcR. On the other hand, only RG-120929 but not RG-102240 or PonA induced reporter activity through the V128F/A110P mutant CfEcR (Fig. 2B). These results demonstrate that the V128F/A110P mutant of CfEcR responds well to THQ ligand and that it is insensitive to both ECD and DAH ligands. The mutagenesis, screening, and confirmation of EcR mutations were performed using the G:CfE(DEF) construct. To ascertain that the V128F response to THQ ligands is not an artifact of the GAL4 fusion or the truncation of EcR, the V128F mutation was introduced into the full-length CfEcR receptor. This mutant was tested in 3T3 cells using a reporter regulated by ecdysone response element. A 1 μm concentration of PonA and RG-102240 but not RG-120768 (THQ ligand) induced reporter activity through WTCfEcR(A-F) (Fig. 2C). On the other hand, only RG-120768, but not PonA or RG-102240 induced reporter activity with the V128F/A110P mu"
https://openalex.org/W2019904955,"Runx transcription factors regulate viral growth, hematopoiesis, bone formation, angiogenesis, and gastric epithelial development through specific DNA-binding motifs on target gene promoters. Vascular endothelial cells (ECs) express RUNX genes that are activated by angiogenic factors. The RUNX2 gene also activates the vascular endothelial growth factor promoter. Alternatively spliced forms of RUNX genes have been described, but their functions in angiogenesis have not been elucidated. In this study, expression of a novel alternatively spliced variant of RUNX2 (RUNX2Δ8), lacking the region encoded by exon 8, was detected in aortic tissue undergoing angiogenesis in vitro and in ECs. Expression of RUNX2 and RUNX2Δ8 increased in vascular sprouts concomitant with expression of cellular proteases and cytokines known to mediate angiogenesis. RUNX2 DNA-binding activity was expressed in proliferating but not quiescent ECs. Ectopic expression of RUNX2 in ECs increased cell sprouting, cell proliferation, DNA synthesis, and phosphorylation of phosphorylated retinoblastoma relative to control transfectants while RUNX2, but not RUNX2Δ8 transfectants, acquired resistance to growth inhibition by transforming growth factor (TGFβ1). Furthermore, RUNX2Δ8-transfected cells were more sensitive to TGFβ1-induced apoptosis than RUNX2 transfectants. Consistent with these data, the RUNX2 gene was a strong repressor of the promoter of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, p21CIP1, while RUNX2Δ8 was a competitive inhibitor of RUNX2 and exhibited weak repression activity. These results support the hypothesis that ECs regulate growth and apoptosis, in part, by alternative splicing events in the RUNX2 transcription factor to affect the TGFβ1 signaling pathway. The exon 8 domain of RUNX2 may contribute to the strong repression activity of RUNX2 for some target gene promoters."

https://openalex.org/W2083225762,"Transcriptional regulation of cell- and stage-specific genes is a crucial process in the development of mesenchymal tissues. Here we have investigated the regulatory mechanism of the expression of the chondromodulin-I (ChM-I) gene, one of the chondrocyte-specific genes, in osteogenic cells using osteosarcoma (OS) cells as a model. Methylation-specific sequence analyses revealed that the extent of methylation in the core-promoter region of the ChM-I gene was correlated inversely with the expression of the ChM-I gene in OS primary tumors and cell lines. 5-Aza-deoxycytidine treatment induced the expression of the ChM-I gene in ChM-I-negative OS cell lines, and the induction of expression was associated tightly with the demethylation of cytosine at -52 (C(-52)) in the middle of an Sp1/3 binding site to which the Sp3, but not Sp1, bound. The replacement of C(-52) with methyl-cytosine or thymine abrogated Sp3 binding and also the transcription activity of the genomic fragment including C(-52). The inhibition of Sp3 expression by small interfering RNA reduced the expression of the ChM-I gene in ChM-I-positive normal chondrocytes, indicating Sp3 as a physiological transcriptional activator of the ChM-I gene.

During embryonal development, the expression of the ChM-I gene is first observed in all of the cartilaginous tissues, which are composed of prehypertrophic chondrocytes (3Shukunami C. Iyama K. Inoue H. Hiraki Y. Int. J. Dev. Biol. 1999; 43: 39-49PubMed Google Scholar). As the development proceeds, hypertrophic chondrocytes develop in the center of cartilaginous bone rudiments where the expression of the ChM-I gene shows a marked decrease (3Shukunami C. Iyama K. Inoue H. Hiraki Y. Int. J. Dev. Biol. 1999; 43: 39-49PubMed Google Scholar). No expression of the ChM-I gene is observed in bone tissues developing after vascular invasion in the area adjacent to hypertrophic chondrocytes (3Shukunami C. Iyama K. Inoue H. Hiraki Y. Int. J. Dev. Biol. 1999; 43: 39-49PubMed Google Scholar). In matured limbs, the expression of the ChM-I gene is limited to cells in the resting, proliferating, and early hypertrophic zone of the growth plate (2Hiraki Y. Inoue H. Iyama K. Kamizono A.

These results suggest that the expression of the ChM-I gene is regulated strictly in a cell- and stage-related manner, although the molecular mechanisms leading to this spatiotemporal expression have not been elucidated. Osteosarcoma (OS) is defined as a sarcoma that produces a bone matrix called osteoid, suggesting that the precursor cells of OS are cells of the osteogenic lineage (5Unni K.K. Dahlin's Bone Tumors. 5th Ed. Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Philadelphia1996Google Scholar). The degree of differentiation as osteoblasts, however, differs considerably among OS ranging from tumors with a large amount of osteoid and expressing a number of bone-related genes such as alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and osteocalcin (OCN) genes, namely osteoblastic OS (OBOS), to tumors in which an osteoid is hardly seen, fibroblastic OS (FBOS) (6Ali N.H.

Cancer Lett. 2002; 182: 203-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). A particular intriguing subtype of OS is chondroblastic OS (CBOS) in which tumor cells directly produce immature cartilage in addition to osteoid (5Unni K.K. Dahlin's Bone Tumors. 5th Ed. Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Philadelphia1996Google Scholar, 9Dorfman H.D. Czerniak B. Cancer. 1995; 75: 203-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar), suggesting that tumor cells in this subtype have the potential to differentiate into both osteogenic and chondrogenic cells. These clinical findings suggest that the precursor cells of OS range from mesenchymal stem cells to mature osteoblasts and that OS cells can be used as materials to investigate the regulatory mechanisms of cell- and stage-specific genes such as the ChM-I gene. Here we first analyzed the expression of the ChM-I gene in primary OS tumors and cell lines and found that the gene was expressed strongly in CBOS but not in tumors of other subtypes. This result prompted us to investigate the involvement in regulation of the expression of the ChM-I gene of an epigenetic mechanism, which has been studied extensively as the mechanism controlling the expression of cell- and stage-specific genes (10Li E. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2002; 3: 662-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (1539) Google Scholar). We found that the expression of the ChM-I gene was regulated positively by a transcription factor, Sp3, and that the binding of Sp3 was regulated by the methylation status in the core-promoter region of the ChM-I gene, especially at one Sp3 binding site. Tissue Samples—Primary tumor tissues from 24 OS cases were obtained at either biopsy or resection. All were conventional high grade tumors, and histological subtypes were OBOS in 13 cases, CBOS in 6 cases, and FBOS in 5 cases. Tumor specimens were frozen quickly and kept at -80 °C until nucleic acid extraction. As a control of the expression of the ChM-I gene, total RNA was extracted from the articular cartilage of the ankle joint of an 11-year-old male who underwent an above-knee amputation because of osteosarcoma of the femur. Cell Culture and Reagents—The human osteosarcoma cell lines Saos2, HuO, HOS, MG63, and U2OS were obtained from either ATCC or the Japanese Cancer Research Resources Bank. The human osteosarcoma cell line TAKAO is a clonal cell line derived from SU cells (11Ishii S. Yamawaki S. Sasaki T. Usui M. Ubayama Y. Minaimi A. Yagi T. Isu K. Kobayashi M. Int. Orthop. 1982; 6: 215-223PubMed Google Scholar). ANOS was established in our laboratory using material from a 12-year-old female with CBOS. These cell lines were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum. Chondrocytes were isolated from articular cartilage tissue from the ankle joint of an 11-year-old male who underwent an above-knee amputation because of a malignant bone tumor of the femur. Drosophila SL2 cells were kindly provided by T. Uemura and maintained in Schneider's insect medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum at 25 °C in room temperature. In the demethylation experiments, cells were treated with 5-aza-2-deoxycytidine (5-Aza-dC, Sigma) for 5 days. Reverse Transcription (RT)-PCR—RNA was isolated using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) from frozen tumor tissues and cell lines. All of the RT reactions were performed using 1 μg of total RNA with the SuperScript first strand synthesis system for the RT-PCR kit (Invitrogen). PCR was performed in duplicate for each sample using primers specific for ChM-I (sense, 5′-CATCGGGGCCTTCTACTTCT-3′; antisense, 5′-GGCATGATCTTGCCTTCCAG-3′, length 312 bp) (12Hayami T. Shukunami C. Mitsui K. Endo N. Tokunaga K. Kondo J. Takahashi H.E. Hiraki Y.

Grzeschik K.-H. Suske G. Genomics. 1996; 37: 410-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), and Sp3 genes (sense, 5′-TTCAGGGAGTTGCAATTGGTG-3′; antisense, 5′-TTCTGTGCCTGTGTCTCTTCA-3′, length 448 bp) (13Kalff-Suske M. Kunz J. Grzeschik K.-H. Suske G. Genomics. 1996; 37: 410-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The PCR products were loaded on 1.5% agarose gel and visualized by ethidium bromide staining. Quantitative RT-PCR of the ChM-I Gene—The relative amount of ChM-I mRNA was assessed by TaqMan real-time PCR with the ABI PRISM 7700 sequence detection system (PE Applied Biosystems). A 75-bp fragment from +411 (exon 4) to +485 (exon 5) of the ChM-I cDNA (GenBank™ accession number XM_007132) was amplified using specific primers (sense, 5′-GAAGGCTCGTATTCCTGAGGTG-3′; antisense, 5′-TGGCATGATCTTGCCTTCCAGT-3′) and labeled with a TaqMan probe (5′-FAM-CGTGACCAAACAGAGCATCTCCTCCA-3′-TAMRA). 18 S rRNA was used as the internal control, and all of the reactions were run in duplicate. The ratio of ChM-I/18 S in each sample was calculated, and the expression level of ChM-I genes was demonstrated as a relative value using the ChM-I/18 S ratio in human articular cartilage as a standard (1.0). Western Blotting—Whole cell lysates were prepared from each cell line, separated by SDS-PAGE using 10% polyacrylamide gel, and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Millipore). The membrane was treated with a primary antibody at an appropriate dilution and then with goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase as a secondary antibody (Dako) and visualized using an ECL plus kit (Amersham Biosciences). The antibody for the human ChM-I protein was kindly provided by Y. Hiraki. Antibodies for Sp1 and Sp3 were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Bisulfite Genomic Sequencing—The conversion of non-methylated cytosine residues to uracils in genomic DNA was performed with bisulfite as described previously (14Clark S.J. Harrison J. Paul C.L. Frommer M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 2990-2997Crossref PubMed Scopus (1599) Google Scholar). One microgram of genomic DNA extracted from each sample was denatured using NaOH (final concentration, 0.2 m) for 10 min at 37 °C, mixed with 30 μl of 10mm hydroquinone (Wako, Osaka, Japan) and 520 μl of 3 m sodium bisulfite (Nacarai Tesque, Kyoto, Japan), and incubated under mineral oil at 50 °C for 16 h. Modified DNA was purified using a PCR purification kit (Qiagen). The modification was completed by adding NaOH (final concentration, 0.3 m) for 15 min at 37 °C followed by ethanol precipitation. Bisulfite-modified DNA spanning residues from -297 to +104 relative to the transcription start point (15Yanagihara I. Yamagata M. Sakai N. Shukunami C. Kurahashi H. Yamazaki M. Michigami T. Hiraki Y. Ozono K. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2000; 15: 421-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) was amplified, cloned into the TA-vector (Invitrogen), and sequenced using an ABI 377 semiautomatic sequencer (PE Applied Biosystems). At least 10 alleles from each PCR product were sequenced. Electrophoresis Mobility Shift Assay—Double-stranded DNA fragments corresponding to the sequence from -96 to -69 and -72 to -45 were synthesized by annealing two single-stranded oligonucleotides (5′-GAGGAAAGGGGGCATCCGGGAGTG-3′ and 5′-CCTGCACTCCCGGATGCCCCCTTT-3′; 5′-CAGGACGAGCTTCCCGCGGCGGGA-3′ and 5′-TCTCTCCCGCCGCGGGAAGCTCGT-3′, respectively) and filling in by DNA polymerase I (TOYOBO, Osaka, Japan). These fragments were designated as GR1 and GR2, respectively. C(-52)m5C-GR2 and C(-52)T-GR2 were created using the same method with the exception that cytosine at position -52 in GR2 was substituted with 5-methylcytosine and thymine, respectively. For the formation of the complex, 5 μg of ANOS nuclear extract was incubated with 32P end-labeled oligonucleotides fragments for 20 min at room temperature. The mixtures were electrophoresed in 5% polyacrylamide gel in 0.5% Tris borate EDTA at 45 volts for 3 h, and the gel then was dried and autoradiographed. For the competition assay, the DNA-protein complex was produced in the same way in the presence of the given amounts of non-labeled DNA. In the supershift assay, nuclear extracts were incubated with 1 μg of anti-Sp1 or anti-Sp3 antibody for 1 h on ice before being mixed with labeled DNA. Luciferase Assay—The 533-bp fragment from -446 to +87 relative to the transcription initiation site of the ChM-I gene was amplified by PCR, digested by SacI and XhoI, and cloned into a luciferase reporter plasmid, PGV-B (Toyo Ink, Tokyo, Japan), which was designated PGV-B-f1. The mutant fragment having a thymine residue at position -52 was created by PCR, cloned into PGV-B, and designated PGV-B-mtf1. SL2 cells (5×105) were seeded in a 35-mm dish, and 1 μg of each reporter plasmid was co-transfected with 1 μg of the Sp1 (pPacSp1) or Sp3 (pPacSp3 containing a truncated form of Sp3 and pPacUSp3 containing a full-length form of Sp3) expression vector (16Hagan G. Muller S. Beato M. Suske G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3843-3851Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar) into Schneider cells using EFFECTEN (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Transfection efficiency was standardized by the co-transfection of 1 ng of pRL-TK control vector (Toyo Ink). Cells were harvested 24 h after transfection, and luciferase assays were performed with the PicaGene Dual SeaPansy system (Toyo Ink). Firefly-luciferase activity and SeaPansy-luciferase activity were measured as relative light units with a luminometer (Lumino, STRATEC Biomedical Systems). The firefly-luciferase activity then was normalized for transfection efficiency based on the SeaPansy-luciferase activity. Each experiment was performed in triplicate. Transfection experiments also were performed using ANOS, TAKAO, and primary chondrocytes instead of Schneider cells and the human Sp3 expression vector pRC/CMV/Sp3 (for review see Ref. 16Hagan G. Muller S. Beato M. Suske G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3843-3851Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar) instead of pPacUSp3. RNA Interference—RNA interference was achieved using small interfering RNA (siRNA) for the Sp1 and Sp3 genes basically as recommended by the manufacturer (Dharmacon). The 21-nucleotide duplexes containing the pattern AA(N19)UU were selected to obtain symmetric 2-nt 3′-overhangs of an identical sequence. Luciferase siRNA duplex (GL2RN1, Dharmacon) was used as a negative control. Transient transfections of siRNAs (1 μg) were performed using Lipofectin 2000 (Invitrogen). RNAs and proteins were prepared 48 h after transfection and used for the RT-PCR and Western blotting. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP)—The suitability of each antibody for the ChIP assay was confirmed by immunoprecipitation-Western blotting assay (data not shown). Cells were harvested and mixed with formaldehyde at a final concentration of 1.0% for 10 min at 37 °C to cross-link protein to DNA. Cells then were suspended in 0.2 ml of SDS lysis buffer and settled on ice for 10 min. DNA cross-linked with protein was sonicated into fragments of 200–1,000 bp. One-tenth of the sample was set aside as an input control, and the rest was precleared with salmon sperm DNA protein A-Sepharose beads (Upstate Biotechnology) for 30 min with agitation. The soluble chromatin fraction was collected with each antibody at 4 °C overnight with rotation. Immune complexes were collected with salmon sperm DNA protein A-Sepharose beads and washed with the manufacturer's low salt, high salt, and LiCl buffers and then washed twice with TE buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl and 1 mm EDTA). The chromatin-antibody complexes were eluted with elution buffer (1% SDS and 0.1 m NaHCO3). Protein DNA cross-links were reversed with 5 m NaCl at 65 °C for 4 h, proteinase K treatment and phenol-chloroform extraction were carried out, and then the DNA was precipitated in ethanol. PCR amplification was performed using primers specific for the ChM-I promoter (sense, 5′-GAATGCAGGCCAGTGAGAAGGT-3′; antisense, 5′-GCACCCTGGGATCTGTCCCGCT-3′). The reaction was performed with an initial denaturation of 5 min at 94 °C followed by 30 cycles of 1 min at 94 °C, 1 min at 63 °C, and 1 min at 72 °C with a final extension at 72 °C for 7 min. We confirmed the exponential increase of PCR product at this number of cycles in several preliminary experiments (data not shown). CBOS Expresses the Cartilage-related Genes—The expression of the ChM-I gene along with a number of bone- and cartilage-related genes was analyzed by RT-PCR in 24 OS, and the representative data of 12 cases were presented in Fig. 1A. No substantial difference was observed in the expression levels of bone-related genes among three types of OS. As for the cartilage-related genes, however, three subtypes showed a considerable difference. CBOS expressed all of the analyzed cartilage-related genes at a high level, whereas none of FBOS expressed COL9A1, COL11A2, or AGC genes. The expression pattern of the genes in OBOS varied significantly among samples. Interestingly, most of OS irrespective with the histological subtype expressed the SOX9 gene, whereas the expression of the downstream genes such as COL2A1 and AGC genes showed clear difference among subtypes. The most notable difference between CBOS and other types of OS was the expression of ChM-I gene. To confirm that the expression of cartilage-related genes was derived from tumor cells and not from surrounding normal tissues, the expression of the same set of genes was investigated in seven OS cell lines (Fig. 1B). All of cartilage-related genes were expressed in ANOS that was established from CBOS. The expression profiles of cartilage-related genes varied significantly among other cell lines. The expression of the SOX9 gene was observed in all of the cell lines including MG63 and Saos2 in which none of cartilage-related genes other than the SOX9 was expressed. These data indicated that the expression of the cartilage-related genes in OS stemmed from tumor cells and that some OS tumor cells expressed bone-related genes as well as cartilage-related genes of which the expression was regulated by some mechanisms other than the expression of the SOX9 gene. The ChM-I Gene Is Expressed Preferentially in CBOS—The expression of the ChM-I gene was analyzed further by quantitative RT-PCR setting the mRNA expression level in normal cartilage as a standard value (1.0). The relative expression level of the ChM-I gene in OS samples varied considerably but showed a clear association with the histological subtype (Fig. 2A). Most CBOS samples showed a value comparable with that in normal cartilage (0.33–8.15; mean value, 2.58), whereas the expression level in FBOS samples was extremely low (<0.0017). OBOS showed intermediate values with variances among samples (0.8–0.00004) (Fig. 2A). The expression level of the ChM-I gene in OS cell lines also varied considerably (0.98–0.002) with one cell line, ANOS, having a value (0.98) equivalent to that of the articular cartilage (Fig. 2A). ChM-I protein was detected only in ANOS by Western blotting (Fig. 2B), suggesting that mRNA expression level similar to that in articular cartilage was required to be detected by Western blotting. Regulatory Regions of the ChM-I Gene Are Methylated in ChM-I-negative Cells—To investigate the role of epigenetic regulation for the expression of the ChM-I gene, the methylation status of the transcription regulatory region of the ChM-I gene was analyzed. Yanagihara et al. (15Yanagihara I. Yamagata M. Sakai N. Shukunami C. Kurahashi H. Yamazaki M. Michigami T. Hiraki Y. Ozono K. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2000; 15: 421-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) report that the 533-bp region from -487 to +46 relative to the transcription start site contained the major transcription activity of the ChM-I gene. Twenty-one CpG sites were found in this region, and the methylation profile of each site was analyzed by bisulfite genomic sequencing (Fig. 3A). In normal cartilage cells, the CpG sites in this region were hypomethylated. ANOS in which the expression of the ChM-I gene was equivalent to that in normal cartilage cells also showed hypomethylation at the CpG sites from -136 to +15, whereas the CpG sites located further downstream were methylated. In the other six cell lines, the mRNA expression level was correlated with the extent of methylation. The promoter region of Saos2 with no expression of the ChM-I gene was methylated extensively, whereas that of HOS with a relatively high level of expression of the ChM-I gene was hypomethylated. To investigate whether the methylation in the core-regulatory region was a product of cell culture, the methylation profile in this region was analyzed in the primary tumors of four cases of each subtype (Fig. 3B). All of the four CBOSs showed hypomethylation of CpGs in this region, which were methylated heavily in all of the FBOSs and OBOSs. These results confirmed that the methylation of the core-regulatory region was not a product of cell culture and was closely associated with the reduced expression of the ChM-I gene in primary OS tumors. Methylation of C(-52) Is Correlated with Reduced Expression of the ChM-I Gene—To further investigate the significance of the methylation as the regulatory mechanism, three cell lines (TAKAO, Saos2, and MG63) showing no expression of the ChM-I gene by standard RT-PCR (Fig. 1B) were treated with a demethylating agent, 5-Aza-dC. The expression of the ChM-I gene was induced in all three cell lines, although MG63 required a much higher concentration of 5-Aza-dC (10 μm) than TAKAO and Saos2 (Fig. 4A). Bisulfite genomic sequencing before and after the treatment with 5-Aza-dC (1 μm) showed extensive demethylation in the core-regulatory region in TAKAO and, to a lesser extent, in Saos2 but no demethylation in MG63 (Fig. 4B), which was consistent with the level of the ChM-I gene expression at this concentration of 5-Aza-dC (Fig. 4A). Comparing the methylation profiles at each site before and after the treatment, we found that the methylation of cytosine at -52 (C(-52)) showed a close correlation with the expression of the ChM-I gene. Almost all of the alleles of C(-52) in the three cell lines (9/10 in TAKAO, 10/10 in Saos2, and 10/10 in MG63) were methylated before the 5-Aza-dC treatment. After the treatment, 7 and 6 of 10 alleles were free from methylation in TAKAO and Saos2, respectively, whereas only one of ten alleles was demethylated in MG63. In the other OS cell lines and primary OS tumors, the methylation profile of C(-52) was correlated well with the level of expression (Fig. 2, A and B), suggesting that non-methylated C(-52) is critical for the expression of the ChM-I gene in OS cells. Sp3, but Not Sp1, Binds to the Sp1/3 Binding Site Containing C(-52)—Using TESS (www.cbil.upenn.edu/tess) and TFSEARCH (www.cbil.jp/research/db/TFSEARCH.html), we found that C(-52) was in the middle of the consensus sequence of the Sp1/3 binding site (CGGCGG). To investigate whether this site is a target for the protein binding, a 21-bp oligonucleotides corresponding to -72 to -45 was synthesized (GR2) and used for electrophoresis mobility shift assay with the nuclear extract of ANOS. Electrophoresis mobility shift assay showed that GR2 bound to nuclear protein and that the binding was inhibited by unlabeled GR2 but not by unlabeled GR1 corresponding to -96 to -69, which indicates specific binding (Fig. 5A). Both C(-52)m5C-GR2 and C(-52)T-GR2 failed to bind the nuclear extract, indicating that the preservation of a non-methylated C(-52) was critical for the protein binding (Fig. 5B). The addition of anti-Sp1 antibody to the GR2-protein mixture had no effect on the GR2-protein binding (Fig. 5C). On the other hand, a supershifted band was observed when anti-Sp3 antibody was added to the GR2-protein mixture (Fig. 5C), indicating that Sp3 bound to the Sp1/3 site including C(-52) in ANOS. The binding of Sp3 to the core-promoter region in vivo was confirmed by ChIP analysis (Fig. 5D). Sp3, but not Sp1, bound to the core-promoter region in ANOS. Neither Sp1 nor Sp3 binding was detected in MG63 before or after the treatment with 5-Aza-dC (1.0 μm), whereas Sp3 binding was induced in TAKAO after the treatment with 5-Aza-dC, which was consistent with the results on ChM-I gene expression. Sp3 Up-regulates ChM-I Promoter Activity through the Sp1/3 Sites Containing C(-2)—The Sp1 (pPacSp1) or Sp3 (pPacSp3 or pPacUSp3) expression vector was introduced into SL2 cells with the reporter plasmid containing the wild-type (PGV-B-f1) or mutant (PGV-B-mtf1) fragment (Fig. 6). Co-transfection of PGV-B-f1 with pPacSp1 (Fig. 6b) and pPacSp3 (Fig. 6c) showed transcriptional activity at a level similar to that obtained with the empty expression vector (pPac) (Fig. 6a), whereas pPacUSp3 greatly enhanced the activity (Fig. 6d). This induction was abolished completely when PGV-B-mtf1 was used instead of PGV-B-f1 (Fig. 6h). These results suggested a positive regulatory role for Sp3 in the ChM-I gene expression, which was mediated by the Sp1/3 site containing C(-52). The induction of the transcription activity of the ChM-I gene by Sp3 was analyzed further in OS cell lines and primary chondrocytes (Fig. 7). Transfection of human Sp3 expression vector (pRC/CMV/Sp3) into ANOS (Fig. 7A) or primary chondrocytes (Fig. 7B), which were positive for the expression of the endogenous ChM-I gene, induced the luciferase activity when the reporter plasmids containing the wild-type fragment with C(-52) was co-transfected. The induction level in primary chondrocytes was much lower than that in ANOS, probably because of low transfection efficiency determined by the activity of the control luciferase plasmid, pRL-TK (data not shown). No induction was observed when the reporter plasmids containing the mutant fragment with T(-52) were used. Similar results were observed also in TAKAO (Fig. 7C), which was negative for the expression of the endogenous ChM-I gene, further suggesting that the expression of endogenous ChM-I gene in TAKAO was repressed by methylation at the C(-52) site.Fig. 7Sp3 induces the transcriptional activity of the ChM-I gene in OS cell lines and primary chondrocytes. Luciferase reporter plasmids described in the figure legend of Fig. 6 were co-transfected into ANOS (A), TAKAO (B), or primary chondrocytes (C) with either empty vector (pRC/CMV) or the human Sp3 expression vector (pRC/CMV/Sp3). The results were determined as the fold induction by setting the luciferase activity in the experiments using PGV-B and each construct as 1.0. The mean ± S.D. of three independent experiments is given.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Reduction of the Sp3 Gene Expression Results in the Reduction of the ChM-I Gene Expression—Both Sp1 and Sp3 were expressed in all of the OS cell lines (Fig. 8A). To further investigate the role of Sp3 in the expression of the ChM-I gene, double-stranded siRNA for Sp1 or Sp3 was transfected into ChM-I-expressing cells. siRNA for Sp1 and Sp3 effectively reduced the mRNA expression of corresponding genes in ANOS, whereas the expression of the ChM-I gene was reduced only when the expression of the Sp3 was inhibited (Fig. 8B). The expression level of the ChM-I gene was confirmed by quantitative RT-PCR, which showed the clear association of siRNA for the Sp3 with the reduction of the ChM-I gene expression (Fig. 8D). The effects of siRNA for Sp1 and Sp3 were analyzed further at protein level, and again, the reduction of ChM-I protein expression was observed only when the expression of Sp3 was inhibited by siRNA (Fig. 8F). Identical results were obtained when human primary chondrocytes were used instead of ANOS. The reduction of Sp3 correlated with the reduction of the ChM-I gene at mRNA (Fig. 8, C and E) and protein level (Fig. 8G), suggesting that Sp3 is a positive regulator of the ChM-I gene in normal chondrocytes. Cells of the chondrogenic and osteogenic lineages are considered to share mesenchymal stem cells as a common ancestor (17Caplan A.I. J. Orthop. Res. 1991; 9: 641-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (3369) Google Scholar, 18Prokop D.J. Science. 1997; 276: 71-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (4081) Google Scholar), and we and others (19Muraglia A. Cancedda R. Quarto R. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 1161-1166PubMed Google Scholar, 20Okamoto T. Aoyama T. Nakayama T. Nakamata T. Hosaka T. Nishijo K. Nakamura T. Kiyono T. Toguchida J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 295: 354-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar) provide the evidence for the presence of bi-directional precursors, which can differentiate into either chondrogenic or osteogenic cells. In addition to the ChM-I gene, CBOS expressed a number of cartilage-related genes such as the COL2A1, COL9A1, and AGC genes (Fig. 1, A and B), suggesting that CBOS may stem from bi-directional precursors. The expression of “the master gene” has been proposed to regulate the expression of the entire set of genes required for differentiation to specific direction, and in the case of cells of chondrogenic lineage, the SOX9 has been regarded as such (21de Crombrugghe B. Lefebvre V. Behringer R.R. Bi W. Murakami S. Huang W. Matrix Biol. 2000; 19: 389-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). However, all seven OS cell lines expressed the SOX9 gene irrespective to the expression of downstream genes such as the COL2A1 gene (Fig. 1B) (21de Crombrugghe B. Lefebvre V. Behringer R.R. Bi W. Murakami S. Huang W. Matrix Biol. 2000; 19: 389-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). These results suggested the presence of mechanisms to turn off the expression of cartilage-specific genes in OS cells. The results in this study demonstrated an example in which the epigenetic mechanism is involved in such a tissue-specific expression of cartilage-related genes. Little is known regarding the transcriptional regulation of the ChM-I gene. As for extrinsic signals, several growth factors have been shown to reduce the expression of the ChM-I gene including fibroblast growth factor-2, transforming growth factor-β, parathyroid hormone, and parathyroid hormone-related peptide (3Shukunami C. Iyama K. Inoue H. Hiraki Y. Int. J. Dev. Biol. 1999; 43: 39-49PubMed Google Scholar, 4Shukunami C. Hiraki Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 249: 885-890Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), but no definite positive regulators for the expression of the ChM-I gene are known at present. As for the genomic structures responsible for the transcriptional regulation, Yanagihara et al. (15Yanagihara I. Yamagata M. Sakai N. Shukunami C. Kurahashi H. Yamazaki M. Michigami T. Hiraki Y. Ozono K. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2000; 15: 421-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) determine the major regulatory region for the transcription of the ChM-I gene and found that the transcription factor YY-1 down-regulated the transcription (15Yanagihara I. Yamagata M. Sakai N. Shukunami C. Kurahashi H. Yamazaki M. Michigami T. Hiraki Y. Ozono K. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2000; 15: 421-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). However, the role of YY-1 in vivo was not demonstrated and the relationship of YY-1 with the down-regulators mentioned above has yet to be proved. In this report, we have shown for the first time that Sp3 is a potent positive regulator of the ChM-I gene expression, and the data from the siRNA experiments clearly indicated that Sp3 is a critical factor also in normal chondrocytes. Sp3 is a transcription factor belonging to the Sp1 family, which binds to the consensus GC or GT box (22Suske G. Gene (Amst.). 1999; 238: 291-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (977) Google Scholar). Sp3 was isolated as a homologue of Sp1 (23Kingsley C. Winoto A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4251-4261Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar) and reported as the factor that inhibits the function of Sp1 (16Hagan G. Muller S. Beato M. Suske G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3843-3851Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar). However, evidence is accumulating to suggest that Sp3 also has the ability to stimulate transcription involving the promoters of various genes (24Bigger C.B. Melnikova I.N. Gardner P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25976-25982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 25Ihn H. Trojanowska M.

Leukocyte Biol. 2000; 68: 772-777PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that Sp3 is a bi-functional transcriptional regulator (24Bigger C.B. Melnikova I.N. Gardner P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25976-25982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 27Majello B. De Luca P. Lania L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4021-4026Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). The studies of Sp3-deficient mice indicate that Sp3 is essential for postnatal survival, late tooth development, and late bone development (28Bouwman P. Gollner H. Elsasser H.P. Eckhoff G. Karis A. Grosveld F. Philipsen S. Suske G. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 655-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 29Göllner H. Dani C. Phillips B. Philipsen S. Suske G. Mech. Dev. 2001; 106: 77-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), suggesting its involvement in bone and cartilage metabolism. Because Sp3 is a transcription factor expressed ubiquitously and indeed all of the OS cell lines expressed Sp3 (Fig. 8A), it is reasonable to assume that the binding of Sp3 to the core-promoter region is regulated by some mechanisms that may determine the cell- and stage-specific expression of the ChM-I gene. The regulation of higher order chromatin structures by DNA methylation is crucial to tissue-specific gene expression and global gene silencing (30Futscher B.W. Oshiro M.M. Wozniak R.J. Holtan N. Hanigan C.L. Duan H. Domann F.E. Nat. Genet. 2002; 31: 175-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar, 31Jones P.A. Baylin S.B. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2002; 3: 415-428Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and we found that the binding of Sp3 was regulated by methylation in the core-regulatory region of the ChM-I gene and that treatment with 5-Aza-dC induced the expression of the ChM-I gene in association with the binding of Sp3. We have no clear explanation as to why MG63 required a high concentration of 5-Aza-dC to reduce the methylation (Fig. 3A). There was no significant difference in the expression of the Dnmt1 gene among the cell lines (data not shown). Because the growth of MG63 showed no significant change following treatment with 10 μm 5-Aza-dC, which caused severe growth inhibition in all of the other cell lines, there seemed to be a mechanism specific to MG63. Hypermethylation at CpG islands is a common feature of cancer cells (31Jones P.A. Baylin S.B. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2002; 3: 415-428Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and treatments with inhibitors for methyltransferase such as 5-Aza-dC leads to the reactivation of methylation-silenced genes in many cancers (32Karpf A.R. Jones P.A. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 5496-5530Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Considering these findings, the methylation-associated silencing of the ChM-I gene in OBOS and FBOS might be a transformation-related phenomenon. However, it also is likely that the silencing of the ChM-I gene is a physiological phenomenon occurring during the differentiation of mesenchymal cells as demonstrated for other genes (33Locklin R.M. Oreffo R.O. Triffitt J.T. Cell Biol. Int. 1998; 22: 207-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 34Ryhanen S. Pirskanen A. Jaaskelainen T. Maenpaa P.H. J. Cell.

Cell. Biochem. 2002; 85: 112-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). We showed that the removal of methylation restored the binding of Sp3 and induced the expression of the ChM-I gene in osteoblastic cells (Fig. 4B). However, quantitative RT-PCR revealed that the level of expression was lower than normal level (data not shown), suggesting that the binding of Sp3 is necessary but not enough to gain the full transcriptional activity. The investigation of negative regulators such as YY-1 or other epigenetic regulatory mechanisms such as histone acetylation is required to understand the entire picture of the transcriptional regulation of the ChM-I gene. We thank Drs. Y. Hiraki and C. Shukunami for providing anti-human ChM-I antibody, Dr. G. Suske for the Sp1 and Sp3 expression vectors, Dr. T. Uemura for SL2 cells, and the late Dr. M. Oka for continuous and generous support."
https://openalex.org/W2155429920,"Activin receptor-like kinase (ALK)7 is a type I serine/threonine kinase receptor of the transforming growth factor (TGF)-β family of proteins that has similar properties to other type I receptors when activated. To see whether ALK7 can induce apoptosis as can some of the other ALK proteins, we infected the FaO rat hepatoma cell line with adenovirus expressing a constitutively active form of the ALK7. Cells infected with active ALK7 adenovirus showed an apoptotic-positive phenotype, as opposed to those that were infected with a control protein. DNA fragmentation assays and fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis also indicated that ALK7 infection induced apoptosis in FaO cells. We also confirmed this finding in Hep3B human hepatoma cells by transiently transfecting the constitutively active form of ALK7, ALK7(T194D). Investigation into the downstream targets and mechanisms involved in ALK7-induced apoptosis revealed that the TGF-β signaling intermediates, Smad2 and -3, were activated, as well as the MAPKs JNK and p38. In addition, caspase-3 and -9 were also activated, and cytochrome c release from the mitochondria was observed. Short interfering RNA-mediated inhibition of Smad3 markedly suppressed ALK7-induced caspase-3 activation. Treatment with protein synthesis inhibitors or the expression of the dominant-negative form of the stress-activated protein/extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 abolished not only JNK activation but apoptosis as well. Taken together, these results suggest that ALK7 induces apoptosis through activation of the traditional TGF-β pathway components, thus resulting in new gene transcription and JNK and p38 activation that initiates cross-talk with the cellular stress death pathway and ultimately leads to apoptosis.

The type II receptor is responsible for initial ligand binding, which then acts to recruit and activate, via phosphorylation, the type I receptor. After activation, the type I receptor phosphorylates a set of proteins (named Smads) that are specific for each kind of type I receptor. After the Smads are activated, they interact with another protein, Smad4; together, they translocate to the nucleus to modify the cellular response through transcription of other gene products. To date, the exact genes targeted by the Smad pathway have not been fully elucidated, with still less information on the mechanisms by which these genes carry out their function. Activin receptor-like kinase (ALK)7 is a serine/threonine kinase consistent with the characteristics of a type-I receptor. Originally identified and cloned from rat brain (6Tsuchida K. Sawchenko P.E. Nishikawa S. Vale W.W. Mol. Cell Neurosci. 1996; 7: 467-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), ALK7 mRNA is present throughout the digestive and central nervous system of rats. The transmembrane receptor has a similar intracellular domain to TGF-β type I receptor and type I activin receptor (ActRIB), but a different extracellular domain. The only reported interacting ligand for ALK7 is mouse Nodal and xenopus-related Nodal (XnR1) (7Reissmann E. Jornvall H. Blokzijl A. Andersson O. Chang C. Minchiotti G. Persico M.G. Ibanez C.F. Brivanlou A.H. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2010-2022Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). The function of ALK7 as a type I receptor was confirmed with a constitutively active mutant form that activated a TGF-β/activin response reporter (6Tsuchida K. Sawchenko P.E. Nishikawa S. Vale W.W. Mol. Cell Neurosci. 1996; 7: 467-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). ALK7 has also been found to activate some components of the Smad pathway, such as Smad2 and Smad3, in fetal and adult rat pancreas (8Watanabe R. Yamada Y. Ihara Y. Someya Y. Kubota A. Kagimoto S. Kuroe A. Iwakura T. Shen Z.P. Inada A. Adachi T. Ban N. Miyawaki K. Sunaga Y. Tsuda K. Seino Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 254: 707-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In the rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cell line, ALK7 not only activated both Smad2, Smad3, and the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) of extracellular signal-regulated kinase and c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK), but it inhibited cell proliferation as well (9Jornvall H. Blokzijl A. ten Dijke P. Ibanez C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5140-5146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The human gene for ALK7 has been mapped to the genetic location of 2q24.1-q3, with most of the mRNA located in the brain, pancreas, and colon (10Bondestam J. Huotari M.A. Moren A. Ustinov J. Kaivo-Oja N. Kallio J. Horelli-Kuitunen N. Aaltonen J. Fujii M. Moustakas A. ten Dijke P. Otonkoski T. Ritvos O. Cytogenet. Cell Genet. 2001; 95: 157-162Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently the human form of ALK7 has been identified along with three splice variants that are expressed in the placenta throughout various stages of pregnancy (11Roberts H.J. Hu S. Qiu Q. Leung P.C. Cannigia I. Gruslin A. Tsang B. Peng C. Biol. Reprod. 2002; 68: 1719-1726Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). We studied the effects of infecting the FaO rat hepatoma cell line and Hep3B human hepatoma cell line with a genetically modified adenovirus expressing hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged ALK7 to determine whether or not ALK7 could induce apoptosis in these cells. The FaO cell line has proven to be a useful model system to study apoptosis, especially for TGF-β1, which induces cell death in liver cells both in vitro and in vivo. Apoptosis normally occurs in cells by one of two pathways: cellular stress or death ligand (12Green D.R. Cell. 1998; 18: 695-698Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (1109) Google Scholar). In both pathways, the final step involves activation of the effector caspase proteins from their inactive forms by means of large multi-protein complexes. Once activated, the caspases act as proteases, cleaving various substrates that lead to the death of the cell. In FaO cells, the inhibition of caspases has been shown to prevent TGF-β1-induced apoptosis (13Kim B.C. Mamura M. Choi K.S. Calabretta B. Kim S.-J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1369-1378Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 14Cain K. Inayat-Hussain S.H. Couet C. Cohen G.M. Biochem. J. 1996; 314: 27-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 15Inayat-Hussain S.H. Couet C. Cohen G.M. Cain K. Hepatalogy. 1997; 25: 1516-1526Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria and in TGF-β1-sensitive cells, where inhibition of cytochrome c release can completely abolish TGF-β1-induced apoptosis, is an important step in the cellular stress apoptotic pathway (16Herrera B. Alvarez A.M. Sanchez A. Fernandez M. Roncero C. Benito M. Fabregat I. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 741-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Use of protein synthesis inhibitors suggests that new protein synthesis is required for TGF-β1-mediated apoptosis in FaO cells. Recently, microarray data of TGF-β1-treated FaO cells indicated a number of antioxidant genes that are down-regulated, as well as many reactive oxygen species that are up-regulated (17Coyle B. Freathy C. Gant T.W. Roberts R.A. Cain K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 5920-5928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). These genes may be the intended targets of the TGF-β pathway and could have a direct impact on the two major apoptotic pathways. Infection with ALK7 did, in fact, cause apoptosis in FaO cells. More specifically, ALK7 infection activated a number of the same proteins and mechanisms necessary for TGF-β1-induced apoptosis, including both Smad and caspase proteins; it also triggered cytochrome c release from the mitochondria. In addition, ALK7 was found to activate JNK and p38, MAPKs known to be involved in cell-cycle regulation. Coupled to the fact that the dominant-negative form of the upstream stress-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase (SEK1) blocked ALK7-induced apoptosis, it is likely that JNK, p38, and the caspase proteins are downstream targets of the Smad pathway transcription products. In support of the idea of cross-talk between the Smad and apoptotic pathways, protein synthesis inhibitors blocked ALK7-induced apoptosis. Thus, ALK7-mediated apoptosis seems to employ some of the same proteins used in cross-talk in TGF-β1-induced apoptosis. Cell Culture, Transfection, and Treatment—FaO rat hepatoma cells and Hep3B human hepatoma cells were maintained at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum. The 293-derived PHOENIX E (kind gift of Lisa Choy, University of California) or GP-293 packaging cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum. FaO stable cells were transfected in six-well plates using Lipofectin (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For TGF-β1 treatment, cells were incubated with 5 ng/ml TGF-β1 for 24 h in media. For treatment with protein synthesis inhibitors, cells were incubated with puromycin and cycloheximide for 24 h in media. Plasmids and Adenoviral Infections—Recombinant adenoviruses expressing LacZ, HA-tagged active ALK5, and HA-tagged active ALK7 was used at a multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) ranging from 0 to 250 with single viruses (as described by Fujii et al., Ref. 18Fujii M. Takeda K. Imamura T. Aoki H. Sampath T.K. Enomoto S. Kawabata M. Kato M. Ichijo H. Miyazono K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 3801-3813Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). High-titered stocks of recombinant adenoviruses were grown in 293 cells and purified. Infection of recombinant adenoviruses was performed at a multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) of less than 8 × 102 (plaque-forming units/cell). FaO cells were seeded at 0.3 × 106 cells per well in six-well dishes and cultured in 2 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Twenty-four hours later, the medium was replaced with fresh medium and adenovirus vectors (m.o.i. = 100–250) were added. The cells were incubated for 8 h for infection; 24 h after infection, the cells were harvested for gene expression. DNA Fragmentation Assay—FaO cells were treated with lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 10 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 0.5% SDS, and 0.1 mg/ml proteinase K) and were incubated at 50 °C for 2 h. The lysate was extracted with phenol, phenol/chloroform (1:1), and chloroform and precipitated with 2.5 volumes of ice-cold ethanol. The DNA was resuspended in Tris-EDTA buffer supplemented with 100 μg/ml RNase A. DNA samples were electrophoretically separated on 2% agarose gel for 1 h at 120 V. Flow Cytometry Analysis—For flow cytometry assay, FaO cells were grown in six-well plates and incubated for 24 h at 37 °C and then infected with adenoviruses carrying ALK7. After 36 h, cells were harvested and washed twice with PBS buffer (pH 7.4). After fixing in 80% ethanol for 30 min, cells were washed twice and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4) containing 0.1% Triton X-100, 5 μg/ml propidium iodide (PI), and 50 μg/ml ribonuclease A for DNA staining. Cells were then analyzed by a FACScan cytometer (program CellQuest, BD Biosciences). Red fluorescence due to PI staining of DNA was expressed on a logarithmic scale simultaneously to the forward scatter of the particles, and 4000 events were counted on the scatter gate. The number of apoptotic nuclei was expressed as a percentage of the total number of events. Transient Transfection of ALK7 Vectors and Assessment of Cell Survival—For transient expression of constitutively active ALK7 (ALK7-TD: T194D)) or kinase-inactive ALK7 (ALK7-KR: K222R), Hep3B cells were co-transfected with plasmid enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) or ALK7-KA, ALK7-KD, and pcDNA vectors. 48 h after transfection, the apoptotic enhanced green fluorescent protein-positive cells in the same field were assessed. The percentage of apoptotic cells was calculated relative to the numbers present in the control (pcDNA3) wells. The number of transfected cells counted was at least 200. The values are the means of counts on three wells ± S.E. Similar results were obtained in three additional independent experiments. Immunoblot Analysis—Whole-cell extracts were obtained in a 1% Triton X-100 lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 150 mm sodium chloride, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Western blotting was performed using anti-phospho-JNK (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA), anti-phospho-P38 (Cell Signaling Technology), anti phospho-p42 (Cell Signaling Technology), anti-caspase-8 (P-20, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), anti-phospho-Smad2 (Zymed Laboratories Inc., South San Francisco, CA), anti-phospho-Smad3 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-cytochrome c (7H8.2C12; PharMingen, San Diego, CA), and anti-HA (Y-11; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) antibodies. Protein samples were heated at 95 °C for 5 min and analyzed by SDS-16% PAGE. Analysis of Cytochrome c Release—For mitochondria cytochrome c release assay, FaO cells were scraped off in isotonic isolation buffer (10 mm HEPES, 1 mm EDTA, 250 mm sucrose, pH 7.6), collected by centrifugation at 2500 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, and resuspended in hypotonic isolation buffer (10 mm HEPES, 1 mm EDTA, 50 mm sucrose, pH 7.6). Cells were disrupted by passing through a 27 gauge needle 5–10 times and checked for cracked cells by trypan blue staining. Hypertonic isolation buffer (10 mm HEPES, 1 mm EDTA, 450 mm sucrose, pH 7.6) was added to balance the buffer's tonicity. Samples were centrifuged at 1000 × g (2100 rpm) at 4 °C for 10 min. Supernatants were recovered and centrifuged again at 100,000 × g. The mitochondria pellet proteins were extracted in isotonic isolation buffer; the supernatant contained the cytosolic protein extract. Protein concentration of lysates was determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay kit (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After electrophoresis separation of 50 μg of protein/condition in SDS-16% PAGE, gels were transferred by semidry transfer (Bio-Rad) to nitrocellulose membranes. Immunoblots were blocked in TBS-T (10 mm Tris/HCl, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.5, 0.05% Tween 20) containing 5% nonfat dried milk and incubated overnight with the primary antibody (monoclonal anti-cytochrome c diluted 1:1000 in TBS-T with 5% bovine serum albumin). After washing, membranes were incubated with peroxide-conjugated anti-mouse immunoglobulin (1:3000 in TBS-T plus 0.5% nonfat dried milk) for 1 h, and the blot was developed with the ECL kit (Pierce). Short Interfering RNA (siRNA) Methods—We used the siRNA design tool (Dharmacon Inc., Lafayette, CO) to identify target siRNAs. The Smad3-specific sequence was 5′-UCCGCAUGAGCUUCGUCAAAdTdT-3′ (Smad3 nucleotides 1181–1200; GenBank accession number U68019). Hep3B cells were seeded at 30% density the day before transfection. Transfections were performed by using TransIT-TKO reagent (Mirus, Madison, WI), according to the manufacturer's instructions, with 200 pmol of siRNA and 10 μl of transfection reagent/10-cm dish for Hep3B cells. 24 h after transfection, cells were infected with adenovirus expressing LacZ or active ALK7. Constitutive Active ALK7 in FaO Cells Results in Apoptosis—To investigate the possible role ALK7 plays in apoptosis, a constitutive active mutant form bearing an HA-tag was inserted into an adenovirus expression system and used for infection into cultures of FaO cells. Two other adenovirus constructs expressing either HA-tagged ALK5 or LacZ were infected into separate sets of FaO cells. To confirm the expression of the virally infected proteins, the cells were harvested for their protein and detected using an antibody against HA. Both the HA-tagged proteins were successfully expressed (Fig. 1a), whereas the LacZ protein could not be detected. After sufficient time had elapsed, the phenotype of the cells was observed and compared with the known apoptotic-positive control phenotype exhibited by cells treated with TGF-β1. Both the active ALK5- and ALK7-infected cells showed positive apoptotic phenotypes, whereas the cells infected with LacZ did not (Fig. 1, b–d). The ALK7 also induced apoptosis in the untransformed hepatocyte cell line AML12 (data not shown). To further analyze whether ALK7 activation could cause apoptosis, cells were infected with increasing amounts of the active mutant form along with cells that were treated with TGF-β1, serum-starved, unaltered, or infected with LacZ and run in a DNA-laddering assay. When cells undergo apoptosis, a series of small DNA fragments separated by a hundred or so base pairs are generated, creating a characteristic “ladder” appearance (19Duvall E. Wyllie A.H. Immunol. Today. 1986; 7: 115Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar). DNA in cells treated with ALK7 resembled the DNA ladder seen in the TGF-β1 apoptotic-positive control, whereas the other DNA did not (Fig. 1c). As a final test to see whether ALK7 induces apoptosis in FaO cells, a fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS) analysis was conducted of cells that had been infected with LacZ or the active forms of either ALK5 or ALK7. The resulting percentage of cells that appeared in the population of cells in sub-G1 phase for ALK7-infected cells was similar to the apoptotic-positive control ALK5-infected cells and significantly higher than LacZ (Fig. 1d). We next examined the effect of ALK7 on apoptosis in Hep3B human hepatoma cells. We transiently transfected the constitutively active form of ALK7 (ALK7-TD) and kinase-inactive form of ALK7 (ALK7-KR), which acts as a dominant-negative receptor. Comparable expression levels of the ALK7 mutant proteins were obtained when immunoblotting was performed using the anti-HA antibody (Fig. 2a). By 48 h after transfection, the phenotype of the cells was observed and compared with the known apoptotic-positive control phenotype exhibited by cells treated with TGF-β1. Hep3B cells transfected with ALK7-TD showed positive apoptotic phenotypes, whereas the cells transfected with ALK7-KR did not (Fig. 2, a–c). Taken together, these results indicate that activated ALK7 induces apoptosis in hepatoma cells. ALK7-induced Apoptosis in FaO Cells Activates JNK and Requires New Protein Synthesis—To better understand the mechanisms and pathways involved in ALK7-induced apoptosis, we examined the possible activation of MAPKs known to be important in other cytokine-mediated cell death. The MAPKs play a crucial role in relaying extracellular signals regarding cell-cycle regulation and cell proliferation (20Gallo K.A. Johnson G.L. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 9: 663-672Crossref Scopus (458) Google Scholar). To study the possible role of MAPK involvement in ALK7-induced apoptosis, increasing amounts of active ALK7 were introduced into FaO cells, and the activity of three MAPKs were measured. The amount of the active forms of these three MAPKs (JNK, p38, and extracellular signal-regulated kinase) was measured using antibodies specific to the phosphorylated forms of each kinase. Only active, phosphorylated JNK (p-JNK) showed increased levels of expression with increasing amounts of virus (Fig. 3). Dominant-negative SEK1 Blocks ALK7-induced Apoptosis by Preventing Caspase Activation and Cytochrome c Release—The MAPK JNK can be activated by upstream kinases, including SEK1 (21Kishimoto H. Nakagawa K. Watanabe T. Kitagawa D. Momose H. Seo J. Nishitai G. Shimizu N. Ohata S. Tanemura S. Asaka S. Goto T. Fukushi H. Yoshida H. Suzuki A. Sasaki T. Wada T. Penninger J.M. Nishina H. Katada T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 16595-16601Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). To determine whether ALK7-induced apoptosis activates JNK through SEK1, the dominant-negative form of SEK1 (dnSEK1) was created and introduced into FaO cells (22Park H.J. Kim B.C. Kim S.-J. Choi K.S. Hepatology. 2002; 35: 1360-1371Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) that were infected with increasing amounts of ALK7. JNK activation is almost completely abolished in cells expressing dnSEK1 when compared with the cells with the control vector (Fig. 4a). To see whether the loss of activated JNK could halt apoptosis, LacZ-infected or ALK7-infected cells carrying the dnSEK1-expressing vector or the control vector were subjected to FACS analysis. As expected, the dnSEK1-containing cells had a similar number of cells in sub-G1 phase when compared with the LacZ-containing cells, even in the presence of ALK7 (Fig. 4b). This result confirms that, through the inhibition of JNK activation, dnSEK1 prevents apoptosis. It also suggests that SEK1 acts upstream of JNK in the ALK-7 apoptotic pathway. Caspase proteins are known to be important in most apoptotic pathways. To see whether caspase activation plays a role in ALK7-induced apoptosis, increasing amounts of active ALK7 protein were infected in FaO cells and caspase activation was measured. Using antibodies that were specific to the active, inactive, or both forms of caspase-3, -7, -8, and -9, it was discovered that only caspase-3 and -9 are activated by ALK-7. (Fig. 5a) To determine whether caspase-9 activation is upstream or downstream of SEK1, FaO cells expressing dnSEK1 or vector control were infected with either LacZ or ALK7 adenovirus. ALK7 activation of caspase-9 is almost completely abolished in cells that also express dnSEK1 (Fig. 5b), indicating that caspase-9 activation occurs downstream of SEK1. To confirm that caspase activation is necessary for apoptosis, the polycaspase inhibitor Z-VAD-fmk was added to FaO cells infected with ALK7 or LacZ and compared with cells treated with Me2SO in a FACS analysis. The number of cells in sub-G1 phase in the cells treated with inhibitor resembles the number seen in the control cells, which was significantly lower than the number seen in ALK7-infected cells without inhibitor (Fig. 5c). The data confirm that caspase activation is necessary for ALK7-induced apoptosis in FaO cells. Another known indicator of apoptosis in many cell types is the release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria during the cell stress pathway. It has been reported that TGF-β1-induced apoptosis can also stimulate the release of cytochrome c in FaO Cells (13Kim B.C. Mamura M. Choi K.S. Calabretta B. Kim S.-J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1369-1378Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 16Herrera B. Alvarez A.M. Sanchez A. Fernandez M. Roncero C. Benito M. Fabregat I. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 741-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). To see whether ALK7 also has cross-talk with the cellular stress pathway, FaO cells were infected with LacZ, ALK-5, or ALK7, or they were treated with TGF-β1 and then prepared for cytochrome c measurement (see “Materials and Methods”). Like ALK5 and TGF-β1, ALK7 also induced cytochrome c release when compared with the control (Fig. 6a). To see whether cytochrome c release occurs downstream of SEK1, FaO cells were infected with LacZ, ALK5, or ALK7, or treated with TGF-β1 and transfected with dnSEK1. Cytochrome c release was reduced in all instances when compared with cells not treated with dnSEK1. (Fig. 6b). ALK7 Activates Smad2 and Smad3 Which, in Turn, Can Activate JNK and p38 MAPKs—ALK7 has been shown to activate both the receptor Smad2 and Smad3 protein in a variety of cell types (8Watanabe R. Yamada Y. Ihara Y. Someya Y. Kubota A. Kagimoto S. Kuroe A. Iwakura T. Shen Z.P. Inada A. Adachi T. Ban N. Miyawaki K. Sunaga Y. Tsuda K. Seino Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 254: 707-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 9Jornvall H. Blokzijl A. ten Dijke P. Ibanez C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5140-5146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), which is consistent with the function of ALK-7 as a type I receptor. To investigate whether ALK7 can activate Smads in both FaO and Hep3B cells, increasing amounts of active ALK7 were infected into cells and analyzed for Smad activation using antibodies specific to the phosphorylated forms of Smad2 or Smad3. Both Smad2 and Smad3 were activated in the presence of a significant expression of ALK7 in FaO cells (Fig. 7a) and Hep3B cells (Fig. 7c). To see whether over-expression of Smad proteins is sufficient to stimulate activation of JNK and p38 MAPKs in the presence of ALK7, FaO cells were infected with active ALK7 and transfected with FLAG-tagged Smad2, Smad3, Smad4, or a control vector and analyzed for JNK activation. Smad expression was confirmed with an antibody specific for the FLAG-tag. Though the three Smads tested all activated JNK to some degree, only the receptor-activated Smads, Smad2 and Smad3, showed significant activation in FaO cells (Fig. 7b). By contrast, overexpression of the co-Smad4 protein did not result in similar levels of activation, but was comparable with the control vectors in overall activation. We also examined activation of JNK and p38 MAPKs in the presence of ALK7 in Hep3B cells (Fig. 7d). ALK7 induced activation of JNK and p38, as well as caspase-3 activation. Down-regulation of Endogenous Smad3 Markedly Decreases ALK7-induced Caspase-3 Cleavage—In the previous study (13Kim B.C. Mamura M. Choi K.S. Calabretta B. Kim S.-J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1369-1378Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), we demonstrated that overexpression of Smad4 did not enhance the level of apoptosis induced by TGF-β1, and that Smad2 overexpression slightly enhanced TGF-β1-induced apoptosis. However, Smad3 overexpression significantly enhanced apoptosis induced by TGF-β1, suggesting that Smad3 activation may mediate apoptosis in hepatoma cells. To confirm the critical role of Smad3 in the ALK7-induced caspase-3 cleavage, we performed loss of function studies using Smad3-specific siRNA to evaluate the specific role of Smad3 on ALK7-induced apoptosis. We tried to reduce endogenous Smad3 expression through RNA-mediated interference using Smad3-specific siRNA. Transfection of the Smad3 siRNA (100–200 nm) resulted in a >70–90% decrease in Smad3 protein levels (Fig. 8). When transfected with Smad3-specific siRNA, caspase-3 cleavage by ALK7 was markedly reduced (Fig. 8). In this study, we have demonstrated the first reported data that ALK7 can induce apoptosis. By using a modified form of adenovirus expressing a constitutively active ALK7 protein, we have demonstrated that ALK7 creates the same apoptotic-positive phenotype that treatment with TGF-β causes in FaO cells. We have also shown that ALK7 infection generates the breakup of DNA into smaller segments or ladders, which is consistent with cells that are undergoing apoptosis and not another form of cell death. Aside from confirming apoptosis in FaO cells, we have shown some of the possible pathway components and mechanisms that could be responsible for ALK7-induced apoptosis. These include the activation of the Smad, caspase, JNK, and p38 MAPKs, as well as the release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria. We have also shown that new protein synthesis is required for both JNK activation and cell-cycle arrest. Finally, we have demonstrated that dominant-negative SEK1 blocks ALK7-induced apoptosis, suggesting that SEK1 is a crucial intermediate protein. The data are highly similar to data reported for TGF-β1 or active ALK5 pathways in general. This is not surprising, as ALK7 has a very similar intracellular domain to ALK5 and is known to activate some of the same receptor Smads and reporter constructs (9Jornvall H. Blokzijl A. ten Dijke P. Ibanez C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5140-5146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). This suggests that ALK7 may stimulate transcription of the same genes that are activated by Smads in the ALK5 or TGF-β signaling or apoptotic pathways. Some similarities to TGF-β1-induced apoptosis and ALK7-induced apoptosis in FaO cells are present in this study, including the release of cytochrome c and JNK activation. JNK activation, coincidentally, has been implicated as a possible downstream target of the Rho family of proteins, which have been shown to be involved in cross-talk during TGF-β signaling. This is in agreement with our results, which suggests that cross-talk between the Smad and other pathways, such as the cellular stress death pathways, must be occurring. Evidence of this cross-talk is found in our data with the activation of caspase-9, which is activated upon interaction with Apaf1, a component of the apoptosome. However, Apaf1 requires cytochrome c release to self-aggregate and interact with the inactive form of caspase-9 (12Green D.R. Cell. 1998; 18: 695-698Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (1109) Google Scholar), thus strongly supporting the theory that ALK7-induced apoptosis occurs via cross-talk with the cellular stress pathway. Importantly, caspase-8 was not activated, suggesting that the death ligand response does not play a role in ALK7-induced apoptosis. Experiments involving a tetracycline-inducible active form of ALK7 have been shown to create morphological changes and arrest proliferation in the rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cell line (9Jornvall H. Blokzijl A. ten Dijke P. Ibanez C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5140-5146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In addition, ALK7 activated Smad2 and Smad3 as well as stimulated transcription from Smad-binding elements in these cells, including genes often activated by TGF-β. An analysis of the microarray data of gene transcription upon TGF-β treatment of FaO cells found up-regulation of many pro-apoptotic genes, such as CTGF, which promotes fibroblast proliferation, and down-regulation of many antioxidant genes, such as GL-CLC, which helps synthesize glutathione (17Coyle B. Freathy C. Gant T.W. Roberts R.A. Cain K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 5920-5928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Based on the high similarity of the downstream targets studied so far, it's likely that ALK7 activation stimulates these same kind of pro- and anti-apoptotic genes in FaO cells. Further work is also required to identify the ligand responsible for signaling apoptosis in these cells, though Nodal is a possible candidate (7Reissmann E. Jornvall H. Blokzijl A. Andersson O. Chang C. Minchiotti G. Persico M.G. Ibanez C.F. Brivanlou A.H. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2010-2022Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Experiments that find ALK7 induction of apoptosis in human cells will also provide some valuable information, notably in brain development, where it is thought that high levels of ALK7 mRNA are located. In summary, ALK7 is a type I serine/threonine kinase of the TGF-β signaling cytokines that causes apoptosis when transiently expressed in hepatoma cells. The pathway by which ALK7 carries out apoptosis is similar to other ALKs, in that it begins with Smad signaling, which results in the transcription of various gene products. These newly synthesized proteins are necessary to complete the final stages of apoptosis, which involve cross-talk with other cell pathways that eventually culminate in cytochrome c release and caspase-9 activation.

https://openalex.org/W1974075616,"Because copper is both an essential cofactor and a toxic metal, different strategies have evolved to appropriately regulate its homeostasis as a function of changing environmental copper levels. In this report, we describe a metallochaperone-like protein from Schizosaccharomyces pombe that maintains the delicate balance between essentiality and toxicity. This protein, designated Pccs, has four distinct domains. SOD activity assays reveal that the first three domains of Pccs are necessary and sufficient to deliver copper to its target, copper-zinc superoxide dismutase (SOD1). Pccs domain IV, which is absent in Saccharomyces cerevisiae CCS1, contains seventeen cysteine residues, eight pairs of which are in a potential metal coordination arrangement, Cys-Cys. We show that S. cerevisiae ace1Δ mutant cells expressing the full-length Pccs molecule are resistant to copper toxicity. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the Pccs domain IV enhances copper resistance of the ace1Δ cells by an order of magnitude compared with that observed in the same strain expressing a pccs+I-II-III allele encoding Pccs domains I-III. We consistently found that S. pombe cells disrupted in the pccs+ gene exhibit an increased sensitivity to copper and cadmium. Furthermore, we demonstrate that overexpression of pccs+ is associated with increased copper resistance in fission yeast cells. Taken together, our findings suggest that Pccs activates apo-SOD1 under copper-limiting conditions through the use of its first three domains and protects cells against metal ion toxicity via its fourth domain.

Copper is both an essential and yet toxic cellular constituent (1Luk E. Jensen L.T. Culotta V.C. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 2003; 8: 803-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). As a redox metal, it is used by critical enzymes as a catalytic cofactor (2Peña M.M.O. Lee J. Thiele D.J. J. Nutr. 1999; 129: 1251-1260Crossref PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar). However, this same property can render copper cytotoxic because of its ability to participate in Fenton-like reactions that can generate hydroxyl radical, which may in turn cause cellular damage (3Halliwell B. Gutteridge J.M. Biochem. J. 1984; 219: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (4593) Google Scholar). In order to provide organisms with sufficient copper while at the same time preventing copper toxicity, specialized mechanisms have evolved for its uptake, intracellular trafficking, and sequestration within cells (4Koch K.A.

Copper-limiting conditions increase levels of mRNA synthesized from the FRE1/7, CTR1, and CTR3 genes, whereas their expression is repressed under copper-replete conditions, thereby preventing copper accumulation during acute copper exposure (12Martins L.J.

In addition to transcriptional regulation, copper uptake is further regulated through the copper-dependent degradation of the Ctr1 transporter. Ctr1 is stable under conditions of copper deprivation, but is rapidly degraded in the presence of excess copper (21Ooi C.E. Rabinovich E. Dancis A. Bonifacino J.S. Klausner R.D.

This copper chaperone is known to coordinate a single metal ion via its Met-X-Cys-X2-Cys motif (24Pufahl R.A. Singer C.P. Peariso K.L. Lin S.J. Schmidt P.J. Fahrni C.J. Culotta V.C. Penner-Hahn J.E.

Atx1 shuttles copper from the cytosol to post-Golgi vesicles by specifically docking with the Ccc2 copper-transporting P-type ATPase (32Yuan D.S. Stearman R. Dancis A. Dunn T. Beeler T. Klausner R.D.

Once loaded, Ccc2 subsequently pumps copper into the lumen of the Golgi, to metallate the copper-dependent ferroxidase Fet3 (32Yuan D.S. Stearman R. Dancis A. Dunn T. Beeler T. Klausner R.D. Proc.

Although ATX1 and CCC2 gene transcription is unaffected by intracellular copper status, these genes are transcriptionally activated in response to iron starvation, illustrating their importance to iron metabolism through the delivery of copper to Fet3 (23Lin S.J.

Cox17, a 8.05-kDa copper chaperone, delivers copper specifically to the mitochondria for the assembly of cytochrome c oxidase (25Glerum D.M. Shtanko A. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol.

Copper-loaded Cox17 has been shown to shuttle in and out of the mitochondrial intermembrane space and is thought to dock to at least one inner mitochondrial membrane protein, Sco1, for subsequent copper donation to the CuA site of the cytochrome c oxidase (36Glerum D.M.

CCS1 has a predicted molecular mass of 27.3-kDa and possesses three distinct domains (39Schmidt P.J. Rae T.D. Pufahl R.A. Hamma T. Strain J. O'Halloran T.V. Culotta V.C. J. Biol.

This domain has been demonstrated to be important for insertion of copper into SOD1 in vivo under conditions of copper deprivation but is not needed for this function under copper-replete conditions (39Schmidt P.J.

Domain II (residues 78–213) strongly resembles the overall structure of SOD1 (40Lamb A.L. Wernimont A.K. Pufahl R.A. Culotta V.C. O'Halloran T.V. Rosenzweig A.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 724-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). This domain participates in CCS1-SOD1 protein-protein interactions, and is absolutely required for donation of copper to SOD1 (41Lamb A.L. Torres A.S. O'Halloran T.V. Rosenzweig A.C.

At the C terminus (residues 214–249) a short region, referred to as domain III, contains two conserved cysteine residues arranged in a Cys-X-Cys motif that binds copper in vitro (39Schmidt P.J.

CCS proteins lacking the C-terminal domain III are unable to activate SOD1, suggesting that the Cys-X-Cys site binds copper (possibly with the aid of domain I) and facilitates its insertion into the catalytic site of SOD1 (39Schmidt P.J.

In the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, candidate molecules for sequestering excess metal ions have been reported, including the Zym1 MT and the phytochelatins (51Borrelly G.P.M.

Studies using an S. pombe mutant strain that is defective in phytochelatin biosynthesis revealed that phytochelatins play an important role in cadmium and arsenic detoxification but have no apparent clear function in copper detoxification (52Ha S.B.

An S. pombe strain harboring a deletion of the zym1+ gene exhibits a reduction in zinc accumulation, a slight sensitivity to zinc, and a decrease in cadmium tolerance. Furthermore, zym1+ mRNA levels were shown to be induced by zinc and cadmium but not copper (51Borrelly G.P.M. Harrison M.D. Robinson A.K. Cox S.G. Robinson N.J. Whitehall S.K. J. Biol.

For growth under copper limiting conditions, the molecular mechanisms in the early steps of copper assimilation in S. pombe differ from those in S. cerevisiae (53Labbé S. Beaudoin J. Bellemare D.R. Pelletier B. Massaro E.J. Handbook of Copper Pharmacology and Toxicology. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ2002: 571-587Google Scholar). Two integral membrane proteins, Ctr4 and Ctr5, form a two-component copper transporting complex at the cell surface (54Labbé S. Peña M.M.O. Fernandes A.R. Thiele D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36252-36260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 55Zhou H. Thiele D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20529-20535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In the absence of Ctr5, Ctr4 is mislocalized within the secretory pathway. Similarly, it was found that in the absence of Ctr4, Ctr5 is retained in the endoplasmic reticulum (55Zhou H. Thiele D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20529-20535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). These results suggest that assembly of a Ctr4/Ctr5 complex is required for either protein to proceed through the secretory pathway to the plasma membrane. Within this complex, the exact function of each protein is currently unclear. Recently, we have identified a gene in fission yeast, ctr6+, which encodes an intracellular vacuolar copper transporter (56Bellemare D.R. Shaner L. Morano K.A. Beaudoin J. Langlois J. Labbé S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46676-46686Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). In response to copper limitation, Ctr6 appears to mediate the efflux of usable copper from the vacuole into the cytosol (56Bellemare D.R. Shaner L. Morano K.A. Beaudoin J. Langlois J. Labbé S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46676-46686Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Like the ctr4+ and ctr5+ genes, ctr6+ expression is regulated by the Cuf1 transcription factor and is induced in copper-limited cells (54Labbé S. Peña M.M.O. Fernandes A.R. Thiele D.J. J. Biol.

Cuf1 plays an essential role in coordinating the copper-dependent transcriptional regulation of copper transporter gene expression in S. pombe. This regulation involves cis-acting copper-signaling elements (CuSEs) found in each of the ctr4+, ctr5+, and ctr6+ promoters (56Bellemare D.R. Shaner L. Morano K.A. Beaudoin J. Langlois J. Labbé S.

Binding studies reveal that the Cuf1 N-terminal 174 amino acids are important for binding to the CuSE (58Beaudoin J. Mercier A. Langlois R. Labbé S. J. Biol.

A motif containing five clustered cysteine residues near its C terminus constitutes the minimal copper-sensing module of Cuf1 and serves to inactivate Cuf1 function when cells are grown under copper-replete conditions (58Beaudoin J. Mercier A. Langlois R. Labbé S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14565-14577Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Upon uptake into fission yeast cells, copper ions are presumably taken up by putative copper chaperones that are as yet uncharacterized at the molecular level. Examination of the S. pombe Genome data base suggests that the open reading frame SPAC22E12.04 encodes a putative ortholog of the S. cerevisiae CCS1. Although this putative ortholog bears 30% identity and 47% similarity to its bakers' yeast counterpart, notable differences exist between the two molecules. For instance, the N-terminal domain I of the S. pombe CCS ortholog (designated Pccs) lacks the copper-binding Met-X-Cys-X2-Cys motif. In addition, Pccs harbors an extra domain at the C terminus that contains a series of cysteine residues, which are arranged in Cys-Cys configurations. Given these differences between the S. pombe and S. cerevisiae CCS proteins, we sought to dissect the functional features of Pccs. When the pccs+I-IV and pccs+I-III alleles were ectopically expressed in a S. cerevisae ccs1Δ strain, we found that cells producing a polypeptide spanning domains I-III displayed nearly wild-type levels of SOD1 activity. Under low basal copper conditions, S. pombe strains harboring a deletion of the pccs+ gene were defective in SOD1 activity. Transforming this strain with a plasmid expressing the first 222 amino acids of Pccs (domains I-III) restored SOD1 activity to the same level obtained with the full-length Pccs protein. When the full-length S. pombe pccs+ gene or a cDNA fragment that encodes only the Pccs domain IV was expressed in a S. cerevisiae ace1Δ strain, these cells exhibited a copper-resistant growth phenotype in the presence of exogenous copper. Consistently, pccsΔ mutant cells were sensitive to copper and cadmium. Furthermore, overexpression of pccs+I-IV or pccs+IV alone conferred tolerance to elevated copper levels in fission yeast cells. Taken together, these results reveal that the S. pombe Pccs protein function in dual pathways to deliver copper to SOD1 during conditions of copper scarcity and to detoxify metal ions during conditions of metal excess. Strains and Media—Six isogenic S. pombe strains, the wild-type FY254 (h-can1-1 leu1-32 ade6-M210 ura4-D18) (59Forsburg S.L. Sherman D.A. Ottilie S. Yasuda J.R. Hodson J.A.

To ascertain that the results seen were not specific to the S. pombe FY254 strain, identical experiments were conducted with the FY435 strain (h+his7-366 leu1-32 ade6-M210 ura4-D18) (60Bezanilla M. Forsburg S.L. Pollard T.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 2693-2705Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). The pccsΔ (h+his7-366 leu1-32 ade6-M210 ura4-D18 pccsΔ::KANr) and pccsΔ zym1Δ ctr6Δ (h+his7-366 leu1–32 ade6-M210 ura4-D18 ctr6Δ::hisG zym1Δ::ura4+pccsΔ::KANr) mutant strains are isogenic to the FY435 strain. S. pombe cells were grown in yeast extract plus supplements (YES) or in Edinburgh minimal medium with the necessary auxotrophic requirements (61Alfa C. Fantes P. Hyams J. McLeod M. Warbrick E. Experiments with Fission Yeasts: Laboratory Course Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1993Google Scholar). When pccsΔ and sod1Δ mutants were grown, Edinburgh minimal medium was further supplemented with 225 mg/liter of adenine, histidine, leucine, methionine, lysine, and cysteine, unless otherwise stated. Under anaerobic growth conditions, fission yeast cells were grown in culture jars with BD GasPak EZ (BD Diagnostic System, Sparks, MD). For expression of the human CCS and S. pombe pccs+ genes in S. cerevisiae, the ccs1Δ (also named lys7Δ) mutant strain, denoted EGy103lys7Δ (MATα leu2-3, 11 his3-1 Δtrp1-289ura3-52 lys7::LEU2) was utilized to ensure that within the cell, only the ectopically expressed hCCS or Pccs was the sole protein with the ability to deliver copper to SOD1. The EGy103lys7Δ strain was derived from the parent strain EGy103 (MATα leu2-3, 11 his3-1 Δtrp1-289 ura3-52) (62Rabizadeh S. Gralla E.B. Borchelt D.R. Gwinn R. Valentine J.S. Sisodia S. Wong P. Lee M.

DTY59 was derived from strain DTY7 (MATα his6 leu2-3,-112 ura3-52 CUP1R-3) as described previously (64Gralla E.B. Thiele D.J. Silar P. Valentine J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 8558-8562Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). S. cerevisiae cells were grown in rich medium (1% yeast extract, 2% bactopeptone, 2% dextrose) or synthetic complete medium lacking histidine or uracil for strains transformed with plasmids harboring the HIS3 or URA3 gene, respectively. Plasmids—The pccs+ gene was isolated by PCR using primers corresponding to the start and stop codons of the open reading frame from an S. pombe cDNA library (ATCC 87284, deposited by S. Elledge) (generous gift of Dennis J. Thiele, Duke University, Durham, NC). To clone the PCR product into the pRS313 vector (65Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the EcoRI and BamHI sites found in pccs+ were modified by PCR mutagenesis, eliminating both sites without altering the amino acid sequence of the Pccs protein. The modified pccs+ allele was re-amplified by PCR using primers designed to generate EcoRI and XbaI sites at the upstream and downstream termini of the open reading frame. The PCR product obtained was digested with EcoRI and XbaI and cloned into the corresponding sites of the centromeric yeast plasmid pRS313 to generate pRSpccs+I-II-III-IV. Subsequently, the S. cerevisiae CCS1 promoter up to -395 from the start codon of the CCS1 gene was subcloned into pRSpccs+I-II-III-IV at the XhoI and EcoRI sites. Similarly, a 335-bp XbaI-BamHI DNA fragment containing the 3′-untranslated region of CCS1 was inserted into the same sites of pRSpccs+I-II-III-IV. The 666-bp EcoRI-XbaI fragment encoding the first three domains of Pccs was used to replace the EcoRI-XbaI fragment from plasmid pRSpccs+I-II-III-IV to produce the plasmid pRSpccs+I-II-III. The"

We have previously shown that mutations in genes implicated in the formation of iron-sulfur clusters, designated seo (suppressors of endogenous oxidation), reverse the oxygen-dependent methionine and lysine auxotrophies of a sod1Δ strain. We now report the surprising finding that seo mutants do not reduce oxidative damage as shown by the lack of reduction of EPR-detectable “free” iron, which is characteristic of sod1Δ mutants. In fact, they exhibit increased oxidative damage as evidenced by increased accumulation of protein carbonyls. The seo class of mutants overaccumulates mitochondrial iron, and this iron accumulation is critical for suppression of the sod1Δ biosynthetic defects. Blocking overaccumulation of mitochondrial iron abolished the ability of the seo mutants to suppress the sod1Δ auxotrophies. By contrast, increasing the mitochondrial iron content of sod1Δ yeast using high copy MMT1, which encodes a mitochondrial iron transporter, was sufficient to mimic the seo mutants. Our studies indicated that suppression of the sod1Δ methionine auxotrophy was dependent on the pentose phosphate pathway, which is a major source of NADPH production. By comparison, the sod1Δ lysine auxotrophy appears to be reversed in the seo mutants by increased expression of genes in the lysine biosynthetic pathway, perhaps through sensing of mitochondrial damage by the retrograde response.

Superoxide dismutases catalyze the disproportionation of superoxide to hydrogen peroxide and water and play a key role in protecting aerobic cells against oxidative damage (1Fridovich I. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1986; 58: 61-97PubMed Google Scholar, 2McCord J.M. Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 6049-6055Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Eukaryotes, such as the baker's yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, contain two intracellular superoxide dismutases, Cu,Zn-Sod1p, which is predominantly localized in the cytosol (3Crapo J.D. Oury T.

Chem. 1973; 248: 4793-4796Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Yeast strains in which SOD1 has been disrupted (sod1Δ) exhibit several oxygen-dependent growth defects including the inability to grow on medium lacking the amino acids methionine or lysine (5Gralla E.B.

These amino acid biosynthetic defects do not occur under anaerobic conditions and appear to be the result of endogenously generated reactive oxygen species (5Gralla E.B. Kosman D.J. Adv.

The disruption of methionine biosynthesis in sod1Δ strains appears to be caused by the depletion of NADPH by oxidative stress, because the biosynthesis of methionine requires large quantities of NADPH (11Slekar K.H. Kosman D. Culotta V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28831-28836Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 12Thomas D. Cherest H. Surdin-Kerjan Y.

The sod1Δ methionine auxotrophy can be bypassed by increasing NADPH production through the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) 1The abbreviations used are: PPP, pentose phosphate pathway; WT, wild type. (11Slekar K.H. Kosman D. Culotta V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28831-28836Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). By comparison, the nature of the lysine biosynthetic defect in sod1Δ strains remains elusive. Several genetic suppressors of sod1Δ that are involved in metal ion metabolism have been isolated. Mutations in two genes in metal ion trafficking, PMR1 and BSD2, have been identified as sod1Δ suppressors (14Lapinskas P.J. Cunningham K.W. Liu X.F. Fink G.R. Culotta V.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1382-1388Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Liu X.F. Culotta V.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7037-7045Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). These mutations result in the overaccumulation of intracellular manganese in pmr1 and copper and manganese in bsd2. In addition, two multicopy suppressors of sod1Δ, ATX1 and ATX2, cause the overaccumulation of copper and manganese, respectively (16Lin S. Culotta V.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3784-3788Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 17Lin S.J. Culotta V.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6303-6312Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In each case, these suppressors not only rescued the methionine and lysine auxotrophies of sod1Δ mutants, they also increased resistance to superoxide generating agents, such as paraquat. The overaccumulation of redox-active manganese or copper ions in these suppressors is believed to replace the need for SOD1 through the formation of metal-based superoxide dismutase mimics that directly detoxify superoxide radicals (14Lapinskas P.J. Cunningham K.W. Liu X.F. Fink G.R. Culotta V.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1382-1388Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Liu X.F. Culotta V.C. Mol. Cell.

Culotta V.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6303-6312Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Six additional sod1Δ suppressors that also participate in metal ion metabolism, in this case iron were isolated previously. These mutations were found in a screen for genes that contribute to endogenous sources of oxidative stress and were designated seo (suppressors of endogenous oxidation) (18Strain J. Lorenz C.R. Bode J. Smolen G.A. Garland S.A. Vickery L.E. Culotta V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31138-31144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Interestingly, all of the seo mutants were found to contain defects in the assembly or repair of iron-sulfur clusters. The four seo suppressors identified so far are mutations in SSQ1, JAC1, NFS1, and ISU1, all of which encode mitochondrial proteins (18Strain J. Lorenz C.R. Bode J. Smolen G.A. Garland S.A. Vickery L.E. Culotta V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31138-31144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 19Garland S.A. Hoff K. Vickery L.E. Culotta V.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 294: 897-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which mutations in iron-sulfur cluster assembly proteins bypassed the need for SOD1 appears distinct from suppressors that involve copper and manganese metabolism. Unlike pmr1 and bsd2 mutants, the seo suppressors only reversed a subset of the sod1Δ phenotypes, namely restoring growth of a sod1Δ strain on medium lacking methionine or lysine; however, the seo mutants did not reverse the sensitivity of sod1Δ strains to the superoxide-generating agent paraquat (18Strain J. Lorenz C.R. Bode J. Smolen G.A. Garland S.A. Vickery L.E. Culotta V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31138-31144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). This suggested that the seo suppressors were not functioning by increasing resistance to oxidative stress, as is the case for pmr1 and bsd2 mutants, but rather they may be reducing the endogenous production of reactive oxygen species. The goal of this study was to uncover how defects in iron-sulfur cluster assembly were effective in alleviating the need for SOD1 in methionine and lysine biosynthesis. Unexpectedly, we found that mutations in iron-sulfur cluster assembly genes do not reduce oxidative damage under aerobic growth but actually increase oxidative damage and oxidative stress. Surprisingly, we found that overaccumulation of mitochondrial iron, the likely cause of the increased oxidative damage in the seo mutants, is critical for the suppression of the sod1Δ blocks in methionine and lysine biosynthesis. Suppression of the sod1Δ methionine auxotrophy was dependent on a functional PPP and may be operating through increased NADPH production. Attenuation of the sod1Δ lysine defect appears to involve the elevated expression of lysine biosynthetic genes, perhaps through the retrograde response, which alters nuclear gene expression in response to mitochondrial damage. Strains and Culture Conditions—Strains used in this study were derived from either the wild type strain 1783 (Mata, leu2-3, 112, ura3-52, trp1-1, his4, and can1r) or the isogenic sod1Δ strain KS105. FET3 and ZWF1 were disrupted using plasmids pΔFET3 (20Stearman R. Yuan D. Yamaguchi-Iwan Y. Klausner R.D. Dancis A. Science. 1996; 271: 1552-1557Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar) and pBM2720 (13Nogae I. Johnston M. Gene (Amst.). 1990; 96: 161-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Disruptions of MMT1, MMT2, and MKS1 were generated with plasmids pLJ186, pLJ188, and pLJ244, respectively. Yeast transformations were performed using the lithium acetate procedure (21Gietz R.D. Schiestl R.H. Yeast. 1991; 7: 253-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). Cells were propagated either in an enriched yeast extract, peptone-based medium supplemented with 2% glucose (YPD) or in minimal synthetic dextrose (22Sherman F. Fink G.R. Lawrence C.W. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1978Google Scholar). Cells for Fe(III) EPR spectroscopy experiments were grown in synthetic dextrose medium supplemented with four times the normal amount of leucine, histidine, tryptophan, methionine, adenine, and uracil (23Srinivasan S.C. Liba A. Imlay J.A. Valentine J.S. Gralla E.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29187-29192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Plasmids—A high copy plasmid containing MMT1 (pLJ183) was generated by PCR amplification of MMT1 (–681 to +2176) with the introduction of BamHI and HindIII sites at the termini followed by digestion and ligation into pRS425 (LEU2 2μ) (24Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The MMT1 disruption plasmid pLJ186 was generated by mobilizing the upstream (–619 to –213) and downstream (+1378 to +2025) sequences of MMT1 from plasmid pLJ183 by digestion with EcoRI and XhoI (upstream) or SnaBI and EcoRI (downstream) and ligation into pRS306 (URA3) (24Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) digested with SmaI and XhoI. Disruption plasmids for MMT2 and MKS1 were constructed by first amplifying upstream and downstream regions of these genes by PCR. The PCR products were digested with the appropriate enzymes, and each pair of PCR products was ligated in a trimolecular reaction into either pRS305 (LEU2) (24Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) digested with SpeI and NotI for MMT2 or into pRS306 (URA3) digested with NotI and EcoRI for MKS1. The MMT2 disruption plasmid pLJ188 contained upstream sequences –418 to +69 (BglII and SpeI) and downstream sequences +718 to +1145 (EaeI and BglII). The MKS1 disruption plasmid pLJ244 was constructed with upstream sequences –920 to +184 (BamHI and EcoRI) and downstream sequences +1728 to +2308 (NotI and BamHI). Transformation of yeast strains with pLJ186, pLJ188, or pLJ244 digested with EcoRI, BglII, or BamHI, respectively, resulted in the deletion of MMT1 sequences –214 to +1377, MMT2 sequences +70 to +717, and MKS1 sequences +185 to +1727. All gene deletions were verified by in vivo PCR. Detection of Carbonylated Proteins—Carbonylated proteins were detected using the OxyBlot protein oxidation detection kit (Intergen). Mitochondrial and post-mitochondrial supernatant fractions were isolated from cells grown aerobically in YPD medium as described previously (25Sturtz L.A. Diekert K. Jensen L.T. Lill R. Culotta V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38084-38089Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 10 μg of protein from each fraction was reacted with 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine for 15 min at 25 °C. Samples were resolved on 12% denaturing polyacrylamide gels, and 2,4-dinitrophenol-derivatized proteins were identified by immunoblot assays using an anti-2,4-dinitrophenol antibody. To monitor sample loading, the cytosolic protein Pgk1 and the mitochondrial protein Mas2 were also detected by immunostaining with the corresponding antibodies. Measurement of EPR-detectable Iron—Samples for EPR spectroscopic analyses were prepared as described previously (26Srinivasan C. Gralla E.B. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 349: 173-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). EPR spectra were recorded on a Bruker X-band spectrometer. Samples were maintained below 95 K during the recording of the spectra by using either a finger Dewar flask filled with liquid nitrogen or a variable temperature gas-cooled cavity. Parameters for low temperature Fe(III) EPR spectroscopy using the finger Dewar flask were reported previously (23Srinivasan S.C. Liba A. Imlay J.A. Valentine J.S. Gralla E.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29187-29192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Parameters using the variable temperature cavity were: center field 1560 G, sweep width 500 G, frequency 9.45 GHz, microwave power 31 milliwats, attenuation 10 dB, modulation amplitude 20 G, modulation frequency 100 kHz, receiver gain 2 × 105, sweep time 20.97 s, time constant 81.92 ms, resolution 2048 points, and number of scans 16. Quantitation and calculation of EPR-detectable iron levels were carried out as described previously (26Srinivasan C. Gralla E.B. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 349: 173-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Iron Measurements on Isolated Mitochondria—Yeast cells grown aerobically to mid-log phase in YPD medium were converted to spheroplasts, and mitochondria were isolated as described previously (27Jensen L. Culotta V.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3918-3927Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Iron analysis of isolated mitochondria was carried out on a PerkinElmer model 4000 graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrophotometer according to the manufacturer's specifications. Results are from at least two independent experiments. Quantitation of mRNA Levels by Reverse Transcription PCR—Cells were grown in synthetic dextrose medium to A600 ∼ 1, and RNA was isolated using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen) with the optional DNase digestion. The Superscript First-strand Synthesis System for reverse transcription PCR (Invitrogen) was used to prepare single-stranded cDNA. Amplification of the target cDNA was performed using specific primers to LYS9, LYS12, and LYS20 according to the manufacturer's specifications. Control primers for ACT1 were also included in each PCR reaction. PCR products were separated on 2.5% agarose gels and visualized with ethidium bromide staining. seo Mutants Have Increased Oxidative Damage as Measured by Protein Carbonylation—seo represents a class of six mutants that we isolated previously as suppressors of the methionine and lysine auxotrophies of a sod1Δ mutant (18Strain J. Lorenz C.R. Bode J. Smolen G.A. Garland S.A. Vickery L.E. Culotta V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31138-31144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Unlike other previously characterized suppressors of sod1Δ, however, the seo mutants do not suppress all the defects of sod1Δ strains; for example, sod1Δ cells are still paraquat-sensitive in the background of seo mutations. When cells experience oxidative stress, proteins are susceptible to metal-catalyzed oxidation, resulting in the formation of protein carbonyl groups (25Sturtz L.A. Diekert K. Jensen L.T. Lill R. Culotta V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38084-38089Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Stadtman E.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 797-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (1270) Google Scholar). To address directly whether the seo mutants were reducing oxidative damage, the formation of protein carbonyl groups was monitored. Cells were fractionated into the largely cytosolic post-mitochondrial supernatant and mitochondrial fractions, and protein carbonyls were detected by immunoblots after derivatization with 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine. An apparent increase in protein carbonyl formation was seen in the seo mutants in both the post-mitochondrial supernatant and mitochondrial fractions compared with the sod1Δ strain, although isu1 and seo6 mutants showed only a modest increase (Fig. 1). If the seo mutants were reducing endogenous sources of oxidation, a decrease in protein carbonylation would be expected. The increased carbonyl formation indicates that the suppression of the methionine and lysine defects in the seo mutants is not simply the result of a reduction in oxidative damage. In fact, the seo mutants appear to have a higher incidence of oxidative stress, compared with the sod1Δ mutant alone. EPR-detectable Iron in the seo Mutants Is Comparable with sod1Δ Yeast—Another marker of sod1Δ mutants is a tendency to accumulate elevated levels of EPR-detectable iron at g 4.3. The pool of iron that is detectable by EPR spectroscopy increases when superoxide levels are elevated (23Srinivasan S.C. Liba A. Imlay J.A. Valentine J.S. Gralla E.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29187-29192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). We therefore sought to test whether the seo mutants reversed the elevated level of EPR-detectable iron of sod1Δ strains. We monitored the Fe(III) EPR signal at g 4.3, which is characteristic of ferric iron in a high spin rhombic complex. Most protein-bound iron will not give rise to a signal in this region (26Srinivasan C. Gralla E.B. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 349: 173-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Whole cell low temperature Fe(III) EPR spectra were obtained for the WT, sod1Δ, and the derivatives ssq1, jac1, seo3, nfs1, and seo6. Representative spectra from the WT, sod1Δ, ssq1 sod1Δ, and jac1 sod1Δ strains are shown in Fig. 2A. A comparison of the spectra revealed that the seo mutants accumulated EPR-detectable iron at levels similar to sod1Δ yeast (Fig. 2). This is in contrast to pmr1Δ, another genetic suppressor of sod1Δ, that functions in an antioxidant capacity to reduce levels of EPR-detectable iron (23Srinivasan S.C. Liba A. Imlay J.A. Valentine J.S. Gralla E.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29187-29192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Therefore, the seo mutants do not behave as antioxidant suppressors of sod1Δ and appear to rescue only a subset of sod1Δ defects, e.g. methionine and lysine auxotrophy. seo Class of Mutants Overaccumulates Mitochondrial Iron— Four of the seo mutants represent genes that are known to function in an iron-sulfur cluster assembly (ssq1, jac1, nfs1, and isu1) (18Strain J.

Mutations in yeast genes that function in an iron-sulfur cluster assembly typically result in the overaccumulation of mitochondrial iron (19Garland S.A. Hoff K. Vickery L.E. Culotta V.C. J. Mol.

Chem. 2002; 277: 26944-26949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). We therefore tested whether this also occurs in the background of a sod1Δ mutant by measuring the mitochondrial iron content of the four known and two unidentified seo mutant strains. As seen in Fig. 3, we found that ssq1, jac1, nfs1, and isu1 mutations in conjunction with a sod1Δ mutation continue to overaccumulate mitochondrial iron. Additionally, strains containing seo3 and seo6 mutations also share the mitochondrial iron overaccumulation phenotype. Overaccumulation of iron has been proposed to lead to increased oxidative damage (36Babcock M. Silva D. Oaks R. Davis-Kaplan S. Jiralerspong S. Montermini L. Pandolfo M. Kaplan J. Science. 1997; 276: 1709-1712Crossref PubMed Scopus (831) Google Scholar, 37Eaton J.W. Qian M. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2002; 32: 833-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar), and this may account for the increased oxidative damage associated with the seo mutants. It is noteworthy that the two strains that exhibit the least accumulation of mitochondrial iron (isu1 and seo6) also show the least effect on oxidative damage to mitochondrial protein (Fig. 1B). Yeast containing yfh1Δ and atm1Δ mutations are also known to overaccumulate mitochondrial iron (36Babcock M. Silva D. Oaks R. Davis-Kaplan S. Jiralerspong S. Montermini L. Pandolfo M. Kaplan J. Science. 1997; 276: 1709-1712Crossref PubMed Scopus (831) Google Scholar, 38Kispal G. Csere P. Guiard G. Lill R. FEBS Lett. 1997; 418: 346-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar); however, we were unable to test these mutants for suppression of sod1Δ because they grew poorly on a medium lacking methionine or lysine in air, even when wild type for SOD1 (not shown). Suppression of sod1Δ by seo Mutations Requires High Affinity Iron Uptake—It is curious that the seo mutants exhibit both an increase in mitochondrial iron and an increase in oxidative damage while suppressing sod1Δ defects in amino acid biosynthesis. To address whether there is a connection between the high iron uptake and suppression of sod1Δ, we tested whether reducing cellular iron would alter the ability of seo mutants to rescue the methionine and lysine auxotrophies of a sod1Δ mutant. Although the suppression of the sod1Δ lysine auxotrophy by ssq1 and jac1 mutations was very weak, these mutants were still capable of reversing the methionine auxotrophy (Fig. 4). We observed that limiting iron accumulation by disruption of the iron uptake gene FET3 (39Askwith C. Eide D. V-Ho A. Bernard P.S. Li L. Davis-Kaplan S. Sipe D.M. Kaplan J. Cell. 1994; 76: 403-410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar) abolished the ability of the seo mutants to suppress the sod1Δ amino acid biosynthetic defects (Fig. 4). This clearly demonstrated that high affinity iron uptake is needed for suppression of the sod1Δ amino acid auxotrophies in the seo mutants. MMT1 Is a High Copy Suppressor of sod1Δ Methionine and Lysine Auxotrophies—MMT1 and MMT2 encode putative mitochondrial iron transporters and were identified by their ability to increase mitochondrial iron by ∼5-fold when present on high copy plasmids (40Li L. Kaplan J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28485-28493Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). If overaccumulation of mitochondrial iron is required for the seo suppression of the sod1Δ methionine and lysine defects, then increasing mitochondrial iron with high copy MMT1 and MMT2 may mimic the seo mutations and should also suppress these defects. As seen in Fig. 5, MMT1 is a new high copy suppressor of the sod1Δ methionine and lysine auxotrophies. High copy MMT2 was also capable of suppressing the sod1Δ metabolic defects (not shown). Consistent with the results from the seo mutants, disruption of high affinity iron uptake through fet3Δ mutations eliminated the suppression of sod1Δ methionine and lysine auxotrophies obtained with high copy MMT1 (Fig. 5), clearly demonstrating a role for mitochondrial iron in the suppression of the sod1Δ biosynthetic defects. Disruption of the MMT Genes Limits Mitochondrial Iron in seo3 and seo6 Strains—The transporters responsible for overloading the mitochondria with iron in the seo mutants have not been identified, but increased expression of MMT1 was capable of causing overaccumulation of mitochondrial iron (40Li L. Kaplan J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28485-28493Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), similar to that seen in the seo mutants. In an attempt to limit mitochondrial iron, double disruptions of both MMT1 and MMT2 were generated in the seo mutants. Monitoring mitochondrial iron accumulation in these strains revealed that seo3 and seo6 lacking the MMT genes now had mitochondrial iron levels that were similar to the sod1Δ strain (Fig. 6A). Surprisingly, this effect of MMT deletions was not observed with the other seo mutants encoding known members of the iron-sulfur cluster machinery, e.g. ssq1, jac1, nfs1, and isu1 (Fig. 6A). The high mitochondrial iron in these mutants must involve a separate metal transport system. Nevertheless, the reversal of high mitochondrial iron in seo3 and seo6 mutants allowed us to test the role of MMT-driven mitochondrial iron in suppression of sod1Δ. As expected, loss of the MMT genes eliminated the ability of seo3 and seo6 mutants to suppress the sod1Δ aerobic auxotrophies for methionine and lysine (Fig. 6B). This effect indeed correlated with lowered iron because the remaining seo mutants that were unaffected by mmt mutants still suppressed the sod1Δ growth defect on medium lacking methionine or lysine. Together, these results indicate that overaccumulation of mitochondrial iron is necessary for the seo suppression. In the case of seo3 and seo6 mutants, this elevated level of iron is contributed by MMT, whereas yet unknown transporters contribute to high mitochondrial iron in the case of ssq1, jac1, nfs1, and isu1 mutants. seo Suppression of sod1Δ Methionine Auxotrophy Requires the Pentose Phosphate Pathway—The sod1Δ defect in methionine biosynthesis has been attributed to depletion of NADPH, a critical co-factor for two methionine biosynthetic enzymes (11Slekar K.H. Kosman D. Culotta V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28831-28836Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Slekar et al. (11Slekar K.H. Kosman D. Culotta V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28831-28836Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar) found that the methionine defect is reversed by overexpression of transketolase (TKL1), which serves to activate NADPH production by the PPP. Suppression of the sod1Δ methionine defect by high copy TKL1 required the presence of ZWF1, encoding the glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase. We therefore tested whether the seo suppression of sod1Δ methionine auxotrophy was likewise dependent on the PPP and ZWF1. As seen in Fig. 7, disruption of ZWF1 in the seo mutants eliminated the ability of these strains to grow on medium lacking methionine in air. Although aerobic growth was also reduced somewhat by zwf1Δ mutations on medium lacking lysine, this lack of growth did not represent sod1Δ lysine auxotrophy because it was also seen in WT SOD1 strains (Fig. 7). Hence, zwf1 mutations appear to preferentially block the seo suppression of sod1Δ methionine auxotrophy. The requirement for Zwf1 suggests that the PPP may be activated in the seo mutants. How the PPP might be activated in the seo mutants is still unknown, but a possibility is that the cell could induce PPP in response to oxidative damage. Lysine Biosynthetic Genes Are Induced in the seo Mutants— The molecular defect responsible for the lysine auxotrophy of sod1Δ strains remains elusive; however, lysine biosynthesis in yeast lacking the copper chaperone for SOD1, CCS1 (also known as LYS7) (41Culotta V.C. Klomp L. Strain J. Casareno R. Krems B. Gitlin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23469-23472Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar) appears to be blocked prior to the formation of α-aminoadipate (42Bhattacharjee J.K. Sinha A.K. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1972; 115: 26-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). In an attempt to better understand this lysine biosynthetic defect, we searched for mutations that suppressed the lysine but not the methionine auxotrophy of sod1Δ yeast. As seen in Fig. 8A, a deletion mutation in MKS1 (also known as LYS80) was capable of suppressing the sod1Δ lysine biosynthetic defect but did not reverse the methionine auxotrophy. As such, mks1Δ is the first suppressor known to reverse specifically the sod1Δ lysine auxotrophy. Interestingly, MKS1 has been shown to be a negative regulator of retrograde regulation in which nuclear gene expression is altered in response to mitochondrial damage by the Rtg1-3 proteins (43Parikh V.S. Morgan M.M. Scott R. Clements L.S. Butow R.A. Science. 1987; 235: 576-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 44Dilova I. Chen C. Powers T. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 389-395Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). A result of the disruption of MKS1 and the loss of its negative regulation of the retrograde response is the elevated expression of genes in lysine biosynthesis (44Dilova I. Chen C. Powers T. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 389-395Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 45Feller A. Ramos F. Pierard A. Dubois E. Yeast. 1997; 13: 1337-1346Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), but the loss of MKS1 was not found to alter the expression of genes in the PPP or methionine biosynthesis (44Dilova I. Chen C. Powers T. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 389-395Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). To test whether genes in the lysine biosynthetic pathway were indeed induced in the seo mutants, we used reverse transcriptase PCR to monitor the expression of LYS9, LYS12, and LYS20, which was strongly induced by mks1 mutations (44Dilova I. Chen C. Powers T. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 389-395Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). An increase in expression of the three LYS genes tested was observed in each of the seo mutants, compared with the sod1Δ control (Fig. 8B). We propose that the suppression of the sod1Δ lysine auxotrophy represents a retrograde stress response of the cell triggered by mitochondrial damage, which in turn increases expression of lysine biosynthetic genes and lysine content. The goal of this study was to understand how the seo class of suppressors alleviates the metabolic defects of sod1Δ strains. Unlike other suppressors of sod1Δ mutants, such as pmr1, the seo mutants do not show general antioxidant behavior and fail to reduce sensitivity to environmental oxidants (18Strain J. Lorenz C.R. Bode J. Smolen G.A. Garland S.A. Vickery L.E. Culotta V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31138-31144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Although it was initially speculated that the seo suppressors function by reducing the production of endogenous sources of oxidative damage, this is not the case. Our results suggest that the seo mutations do not reduce the burden of endogenous reactive oxygen species as shown by their failure to reduce the high amount of EPR-detectable “free” iron characteristic of sod1Δ mutants. Instead, they appear actually to increase oxidative damage as evidenced by increased protein carbonyl levels. Interestingly, the increased oxidative damage closely correlated with overaccumulation of mitochondrial iron, and this hyperaccumulation of iron was found to be critical for suppression of the sod1Δ methionine and lysine auxotrophies in the seo mutants. Limiting iron uptake with fet3 mutations or blocking mitochondrial iron overaccumulation with mmt deletions as in the case of seo3 and seo6 mutants abolished the suppression of the sod1Δ metabolic defects. The form of the iron that is elevated in the mitochondria of the seo mutants is not EPR-detectable “free” iron. Mitochondria isolated from sod1Δ yeast do not show an increase in EPR-detectable iron, indicating that this iron is not localized to the mitochondria. 2Wallace, M. A., Liou, L.-L., Martins, J., Clement, M., Bailey, S., Longo, V. D., Valentine, J. S., and Gralla, E. B. (May 27, 2004) J. Biol. Chem. 10.1074/jbc.M403950200. Although the seo mutants all overaccumulate mitochondrial iron, the molecular pathways by which this iron accumulation is mediated are distinct. The seo mutants appear to fall into at least two classes, one of which includes the seo3 and seo6 mutants that rely on the MMT genes for mitochondrial iron accumulation. By contrast, the route by which mitochondrial iron is accumulated in the remaining seo mutants (ssq1, jac1, nfs1, and isu1) remains unclear. The mitochondrial carrier proteins Mrs3 and Mrs4 have been proposed to contribute to mitochondrial iron in yfh1Δ strains (46Foury F. Roganti T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24475-24483Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) and may play a role in iron accumulation due to ssq1, jac1, nfs1, and isu1 mutations. Alternatively, other yet uncharacterized mitochondrial iron transporters may be involved in the overaccumulation of iron in these mutants. Having eliminated a reduction in oxidative stress as the cause of seo suppression, we investigated how overaccumulation of mitochondrial iron could reverse the sod1Δ metabolic defects. Our results indicate that the seo suppression of the sod1Δ methionine and lysine auxotrophies is mediated through the sensing of mitochondrial stress, but the pathways used for rectifying the methionine and lysine biosynthetic defects may be distinct. Our studies suggest that reversal of the lysine defect involves activation of the retrograde response, which is controlled in part through the action of the Rtg and Mks1 proteins. The retrograde response in yeast is known to alter nuclear gene expression in reaction to changes in the functional state of mitochondria in what amounts to a stress response to mitochondrial damage (43Parikh V.S. Morgan M.M. Scott R. Clements L.S. Butow R.A. Science. 1987; 235: 576-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 47Liao X. Butow R.A. Cell. 1993; 72: 61-71Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). The broad range of cellular activities regulated by the retrograde response includes the synthesis of lysine; however, methionine biosynthesis is not regulated by this stress response (44Dilova I. Chen C. Powers T. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 389-395Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Activation of retrograde regulation either through mitochondrial stress or mks1 mutations results in the elevated expression of lysine biosynthetic genes. We suggest that the induction of lysine biosynthesis in the seo mutants increases the abundance of active enzymes, allowing for additional production of lysine. The seo suppression of the sod1Δ methionine auxotrophy does not involve the retrograde response but appears to involve another stress pathway that also responds to mitochondrial iron overaccumulation and possibly mitochondrial damage. Although the stress response that is responsible for reversing the sod1Δ methionine auxotrophy in the seo mutants is still unclear, we have evidence for a critical role of the PPP in this suppression. The seo suppressors require ZWF1, encoding glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, which catalyzes the rate-limiting step in NADPH production from the PPP. Because NADPH is a key cellular reductant needed for oxidative stress protection (13Nogae I. Johnston M. Gene (Amst.). 1990; 96: 161-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 48Kletzien R.F.

EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5209-5215Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar), the damage associated with mitochondrial iron overaccumulation may signal increased NADPH production from the PPP, thereby suppressing the sod1Δ methionine auxotrophy in seo mutants. Although the specific factors controlling this non-retrograde response to mitochondrial damage remain to be determined, our study has revealed new connections between mitochondria to nuclear signaling.

https://openalex.org/W2008093774,"β<sub>2</sub>-Adrenergic receptors (β<sub>2</sub>-ARs) are low abundance integral membrane proteins that mediate the effects of catecholamines at the cell surface. Post-transcriptional regulation of β<sub>2</sub>-AR is dependent, in part, on sequences within the 5′- and 3′-untranslated regions (UTRs) of the receptor mRNA. In this work, we demonstrate that 3′-UTR sequences regulate the translation of the receptor mRNA. Deletion of the 3′-UTR sequences resulted in 2–2.5-fold increases in receptor expression. The steadystate levels of β<sub>2</sub>-AR mRNA did not change significantly in the presence or absence of the 3′-UTR, suggesting that the translation of the receptor mRNA is suppressed by 3′-UTR sequences. Introduction of the receptor 3′-UTR sequences into the 3′-UTR of a heterologous reporter gene (luciferase) resulted in a 70% decrease in reporter gene expression without significant changes in luciferase mRNA levels. Sucrose density gradient fractionation of cytoplasmic extracts from Chinese hamster ovary cells transfected with full-length receptor cDNA demonstrated that the receptor transcripts were distributed between polysomal and non-polysomal fractions. Deletion of 3′-UTR sequences from the receptor cDNA resulted in a clear shift in the distribution of receptor mRNA toward the polysomal fractions, favoring increased translation. The 3′-UTR sequences of the receptor mRNA were sufficient to shift the distribution of luciferase mRNA from predominantly polysomal fractions toward non-polysomal fractions in cells transfected with the chimeric luciferase construct. Taken together, our results provide the first evidence for translational control of β<sub>2</sub>-AR expression by 3′-UTR sequences. Presumably, this occurs by affecting the receptor mRNA localization."
https://openalex.org/W2054202198,"The tumor suppressor gene product BRCA1 is a component of the RNA polymerase II (pol II) holoenzyme that is involved, through binding to various regulatory proteins, in either activation or repression of transcription. Using a yeast two-hybrid screen, we have identified a human zinc-finger-containing protein NUFIP that interacts with BRCA1. The ubiquitous, stably expressed, nuclear protein NUFIP specifically stimulates activator-independent pol II transcription in vitro and in vivo. Immunodepletion of the endogenous NUFIP causes a marked decrease of pol II transcription, which is then shown to be restored by stable complex of ectopically produced NUFIP and associated factors. NUFIP not only interacts with BRCA1 but also associates with the positive elongation factor P-TEFb through interaction with the regulatory Cyclin T1 subunit. Cyclin T1 is required for BRCA1- and NUFIP-dependent synergistic activation of pol II transcription in 293 cells. Mutation of the zinc-finger domain abolishes the NUFIP-mediated transcriptional activation. We show that NUFIP is associated with preinitiation complexes, open transcription complexes, and elongation complexes. In addition, NUFIP facilitates ATP-dependent dissociation of hyperphosphorylated pol II from open transcription complexes in vitro."

This provides a framework for identifying cellular pathways that are active as a function of the environment and in turn helps to uncover the interplay between gene and metabolic networks. The development of high throughput technologies has given rise to a wealth of information entailing new paradigms for analyzing and gaining insight into the biological process. Systems of genes, proteins, and metabolites for a given state are now easily attained, necessitating a systems-based analysis and modeling of cellular processes that integrates the biological information from these different scales. By accomplishing this integration, it is then possible to perturb cellular systems in silico and to provide a platform to predict cellular or physiological function across a range of conditions and thus enable the engineering of biological behavior. Therefore, developing a model capable of integrating gene expression and metabolic data would facilitate this goal.The significance of this goal is evident by the numerous efforts devoted to this area. Generally, the efforts fall into two categories: 1) knowledge-based simulation and 2) data-based pattern discovery. Deterministic and stochastic approaches have been developed for the first category. Deterministic models include Virtual Cell, E-Cell, GEAPSI, and DBSOLVE, and stochastic models include StochSim and M-Cell (see Ref. 1Loew L.M. Schaff J.C. Trends Biotechnol. 2001; 19: 401-406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar for a review of these various models). Both deterministic and stochastic approaches rely heavily on the availability of existing biological knowledge to define the model. This is a shortcoming for our application, where the prior knowledge typically does not exist. On the other hand, many discovery tools have been developed to uncover patterns and relations within the data that describe the biological system. For example, based on the assumption that co-expressed genes are also functionally related, clustering techniques have been applied to gene expression data (2Eisen M.B. Spellma n P.T. Brown P.O. Botstein D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14863-14868Crossref PubMed Scopus (13132) Google Scholar) to identify groups of co-regulated genes. Similarly, multivariate statistical methods, such as singular value decomposition (a complete list of abbreviations is given in Supplemental Material, Appendix 3) (3Alter O. Brown P.O. Bostein D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10101-10106Crossref PubMed Scopus (1456) Google Scholar) and correspondence analysis (4Fellenberg K. Hauser N.C. Brors B. Neutzner A. Hoheisel J.D. Vingron M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10781-10786Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar), provide alternative approaches to identifying co-regulated genes. However, these methods cannot be used to uncover detailed gene-regulatory networks, unless further information or different types of data are provided. Reverse engineering methods, such as Boolean network, have been applied to infer regulatory network(s) from gene expression data. Boolean networks consider the expression of every gene to be either ON or OFF (1/0) and regulated by other genes through Boolean rules. Boolean methodology provides a context to analyze logical rules such as A = B or C. The information captured by such a model would be, for example, whether gene A can be activated by either gene B or gene C. It has proven useful in obtaining the dynamics of gene regulatory networks (5Liang S. Fuhrman S. Somogyi R. Pacific Symp. Biocomput. 1998; 3: 18-29Google Scholar). However, Boolean models are limited to time series data, known relationships, and small networks. Furthermore, some data base approaches such as a Maze (6Van Helden J. Naim A. Mancuso R. Eldridge M. Wernisch L. Gilbert D. Wodak S.J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 381: 921-935PubMed Google Scholar) and KEGG (7Nakao M Bono H. Kawashima S. Kamiya T. Sato K. Goto S. Kanehisa M. Genome Inform. Ser. Workshop Genome Inform. 1999; 10: 94-103PubMed Google Scholar) attempt to reconstruct metabolic pathways by making use of gene expression profiles and the premise that co-regulated genes function in the same pathway. However, these approaches do not integrate metabolic flux profile with gene expression data; therefore, it cannot quantitatively evaluate the changes in the metabolic phenotype induced by variation in the gene expression profile. Moreover, in order to achieve an understanding of how living cells function, information on the interplay between genes, pathways, and environmental factors is required.As a step toward uncovering this interplay, it is the objective of this paper to develop a framework capable of 1) selecting a subset of genes that can quantitatively predict metabolic functions based upon their expression levels and 2) reconstructing the role of these genes in regulating these metabolic functions. Since metabolic functions are determined in part by the levels and activities of enzymes in the network, which in turn are regulated in part by their gene expression, it is reasonable to suggest that metabolic functions could be predicted by the expression level of a subset of relevant genes. To test this assumption, we developed a genetic algorithm-coupled partial least squares analysis (GA/PLS) 1The abbreviations used are: GA/PLS, genetic algorithm-coupled partial least squares analysis; GA, genetic algorithm; PLS, partial least squares analysis; TG, triglyceride; HNF, hepatocyte nuclear factor; C/EBP, CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein; UDPGT, UDP-glucuronosyl-transferase; nt, nucleotides; HMG, hydroxymethylglutaryl.1The abbreviations used are: GA/PLS, genetic algorithm-coupled partial least squares analysis; GA, genetic algorithm; PLS, partial least squares analysis; TG, triglyceride; HNF, hepatocyte nuclear factor; C/EBP, CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein; UDPGT, UDP-glucuronosyl-transferase; nt, nucleotides; HMG, hydroxymethylglutaryl. framework to identify a subset of genes that can predict metabolic function(s). The relevance of the gene subset is assessed by reconstructing their regulatory roles in the metabolic network with aid from current literature knowledge. Gene expression and metabolic data were experimentally obtained for a hepatocellular system.This concept of identifying a subset of genes that can predict metabolic function(s) is analogous to selecting an optimal subset of wavelengths in constructing a spectroscopic calibration model to predict chemical concentrations from signal measurements (e.g. absorbance value) (8Bangalore A.S. Shaffer R.E. Small G.W. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 4200-4212Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Full spectrum data (signal measurements) consist of absorbance values at different wavelengths, which are easily collected in a matter of seconds, but only a subset of the spectral data is essential to building a calibration model. The optimal subset of wavelengths used to build the calibration model changes as the chemicals being measured change (9Leardi R. J. Chemometrics. 2000; 14: 643-655Crossref Scopus (504) Google Scholar). By analogy, a full range of gene expression data is also easily collected, but only a subset of these genes are relevant to a particular cellular function. This subset of genes changes as the cellular function being predicted changes. In the current study, genetic algorithm (GA) was used to identify a subset of genes that are most influential or relevant to a metabolic function. Then a partial least squares analysis (PLS) model was subsequently constructed to predict the metabolic function based upon the expression level of the selected genes. We reviewed the biological function of the selected genes to elucidate their potential role in regulating the metabolic function. Finally, we evaluated the model robustness by artificially adding noise to the gene expression data and comparing the subset of genes selected before and after noise addition.MATERIALS AND METHODSData CollectionThe gene expression and metabolic data were obtained from cultured primary rat hepatocytes (10Chan C. Berthiaume F. Washuzu J. Toner M. Yarmush M.L. Biotechnol. Bioeng. 2002; 78: 753-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 11Chan C. Berthiaume F. Lee K. Yarmush M.L. Biotechnol.

Hwang D.H. Stephanopoulos G.N. Yarmush M.L. Stephanopoulos G. Biotechnol. Prog. 2003; 19: 580-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Hepatocytes were isolated from adult female Lewis rats. The isolated hepatocytes were cultured in a collagen sandwich configuration and incubated in standard hepatocyte culture medium containing either 0.5 units/ml insulin (high insulin) or 50 microunits/ml insulin (low insulin). The hepatocytes were cultured in this fashion for at least 6 days prior to plasma exposure. This interval is considered the preconditioning period. The 6-day-old sandwiched hepatocyte cultures were subsequently exposed to unsupplemented or amino acid-supplemented plasma solution for an additional 7 days (11Chan C. Berthiaume F. Lee K. Yarmush M.L. Biotechnol. Bioeng. 2003; 81: 33-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 12Chan C. Berthiaume F. Lee K. Yarmush M.L. Metab. Eng. 2003; 5: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The four combinations of preconditioning and plasma supplementation evaluated were as follows. They were 1) low insulin-preconditioned and unsupplemented plasma (denoted as [L,0] hereafter), 2) low insulin-preconditioned and amino acid-supplemented plasma (denoted as [L,A]), 3) high insulin-preconditioned and unsupplemented plasma (denoted as [H,0]), and 4) high insulin-preconditioned and amino acid-supplemented plasma (denoted as [H,A]) cultures. The metabolites were measured using HPLC and biochemical assays described elsewhere (10Chan C. Berthiaume F. Washuzu J. Toner M. Yarmush M.L. Biotechnol. Bioeng. 2002; 78: 753-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 11Chan C. Berthiaume F. Lee K. Yarmush M.L. Biotechnol.

Hwang D.H. Stephanopoulos G.N. Yarmush M.L. Stephanopoulos G. Biotechnol. Prog. 2003; 19: 580-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). A model for hepatocyte metabolism was created based on the known stoichiometry of the hepatic metabolic network. Metabolite measurements were coupled to metabolic flux analysis to obtain the intracellular fluxes (11Chan C. Berthiaume F. Lee K. Yarmush M.L. Biotechnol. Bioeng. 2003; 81: 33-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The gene expression profiles of the samples were collected using Affymetrix chips. All expression profiles were generated using total RNA, with in vitro transcription yielding biotinylated cRNA for hybridization to the Affymetrix rat UG34A GeneChip array. The chips were analyzed at the Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston. The expression data can be accessed on the World Wide Web at www.msu.edu/~lizheng1/microarray.zip.Data PreprocessExpression levels of 8,799 genes were measured using Affymetrix chips, and a subset of these genes were differentially expressed across the range of experimental conditions in this study. Student's t test was used to identify the subset of genes that were differentially expressed between the high insulin-preconditioned (including [H,0] and [H,A]) and the low insulin-preconditioned (including [L,0] and [L,A]) groups. In t test, normalized distance between the high insulin and low insulin groups is calculated as follows, D=(mh−mlh)/sh2nh+slh2nlh (Eq. 1) where mh and mlh are the population mean value of the high insulin and low insulin groups, respectively; sh and slh are the population variances; and nh and nlh are the number of the samples in the populations. It is known that D follows approximately a Student's distribution. The two populations are considered different when D exceeds a certain threshold value, which depends on the confidence level selected. Using Student's t test, 179 genes were identified as significantly different with a 95% confidence level. The 179 genes were checked manually to exclude irrelevant ones; for example, genes expressed specifically in other tissues (e.g. brain) were removed. Finally, 111 genes remained for further GA/PLS analysis and are listed in Supplemental Material, Appendix Table I.In addition to the genes selected by t test, many other genes encode the enzymes that are involved in the metabolic network defined in Ref. 11Chan C. Berthiaume F. Lee K. Yarmush M.L. Biotechnol. Bioeng. 2003; 81: 33-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar and are relevant to heptocellular function but were not selected by the t test. We included these informative genes, namely 45 genes that encode the enzymes or transcription factors involved in the metabolic network detailed elsewhere (11Chan C. Berthiaume F. Lee K. Yarmush M.L. Biotechnol. Bioeng. 2003; 81: 33-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). These genes are listed in Supplemental Material, Appendix Table II.Gene Selection with GA/PLSThe GA/PLS framework is illustrated in Fig. 1. In brief, the whole data set is separated into three independent groups (namely training, monitoring, and testing data sets) in order to avoid over-fitting. First, GA randomly selects a subset of genes from the training data set. The expression levels of these genes are subsequently used to construct a PLS model to predict a metabolic function (e.g. intracellular triglyceride (TG) or urea synthesis). The accuracy of the PLS model is evaluated using both the training and monitoring data sets. The accuracy of the PLS model prediction is used to assess the fitness of the subset of genes selected. The genetic algorithm continues to search for a gene subset until the accuracy of the PLS model prediction is maximized. The testing data set is used to validate the prediction ability of the final GA/PLS model.Partial Least Squares AnalysisPLS (14Geladi P. Kowalski B.P. Anal. Chim. Acta. 1986; 185: 1-17Crossref Scopus (5563) Google Scholar) is a statistical approach capable of modeling a large number of variables using a relatively small set of observations. It circumvents typical problems associated with the highly correlated and collinear nature of experimental data by projecting the data onto a few independent latent factors. These latent factors simplify the complex and diverse relationships by capturing the variable interactions contained in the original data into a new set of fewer unobserved/latent variables. We used this approach to map the levels of gene expression (X) to a metabolic function (Y), to gain an understanding of the interplay between a hepatic function and the gene expression profile. The PLS algorithm determines, based upon a nonlinear iterative partial least squares approach, a set of orthogonal projection axes W, henceforth called PLS weights, and sample projections T. For direct projection of the samples, W* = (W(PT*W)-1) is used, T=XW∗ (Eq. 2) Then regression coefficients β in Equation 3 are obtained by regressing Y onto the sample projections T, Y=Tβ (Eq. 3) With a PLS factors, the PLS model is as follows, Y=XWa∗β=Taβ=∑j=1atjβj (Eq. 4) Â Î²=(TaTT)âˆ’1TaTYÂ(Eq. 5) Genetic AlgorithmGA is an optimization method based upon the theory of natural selection. A more complete discussion of GA can be found in Ref. 15Goldberg D.E Deb K. Genetic Algorithms in Search, Optimization, and Machine Learning. Addison-Wesley, Reading, MA1989Google Scholar. Here we demonstrate a feature selection algorithm that combines GA and PLS (see Fig. 1). GA begins with an initial, randomly selected population. Each individual in the population is a potential solution to the optimization problem, and its fitness to the optimization problem is evaluated by a fitness function. The population evolves over generation by way of three genetic operators: reproduction, crossover, and mutation. The process terminates when the objective function reaches its maximum or when the termination condition (e.g. maximum number of iterations) is satisfied. The algorithm includes four main steps: initialization, evaluation, reproduction and crossover, and mutation.Step 1: Initialization—In GA, an individual is a string of length N, schematically shown in Fig. 2. The first N-1 values of the string are binary, with value 1/0 representing the inclusion or exclusion of a gene in the PLS model, and the Nth value represents the number of latent variables in the PLS model. A population is a collection of different individuals (i.e. a set of different strings (e.g. genes) of the same length). The initial population is created randomly in user-specified bounds of the N variables in the string. For example, the bounds of the first N-1 bits of the string in this current study was (0, 1); thus, the individuals in the initial population were assigned randomly with values 0 or 1. The Nth bit of the string (i.e. number of latent variables) is randomly assigned a value between 1 and 10.Fig. 2Representative of the string in the GA/PLS algorithm. 156 genes were selected by t test and the addition of known relevant genes. The first 156 elements of the string contain binary 0/1 data representing the exclusion or inclusion of the genes in the PLS model. The last bit of the chromosome represents the number of latent variables in the PLS model.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Step 2: Evaluation—Each individual in the population is evaluated with a fitness function to determine how well they fit or improved the optimization problem. The optimization problem in our case is to find a subset of genes that can be used to construct a PLS model to predict metabolic functions with a minimal prediction error and number of latent variables. The fitness function is defined by Equation 6. A similar fitness function has been used in Ref. 8Bangalore A.S. Shaffer R.E. Small G.W. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 4200-4212Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar to select wavelengths that optimize calibration models. Fitness=1âˆ'(yiâˆ’y^i)2+LVwÂ(Eq. 6) where yi is the measured metabolic flux value, yi is the PLS-predicted metabolic flux value, LV is the number of latent variables in the PLS model, and w is a weighting factor to establish an optimal balance between prediction accuracy and the model size (number of PLS latent variables). w normalizes the model size to the same scale as the prediction error terms. An optimal value of w is critical to the success of the GA/PLS model. Too large a w results in a model with too few factors to explain the gene expression data. Too small a w causes the PLS model to include too many factors and become essentially a curve fit. An optimal w, guided by a GA search, allows one to find a model that will provide the most accurate prediction with a minimum number of latent variables. To determine an optimal w value, different w values, ranging from 0 to 0.5, were used to search for a PLS model. The different models were compared using two criteria, the mean square error of prediction and the number of PLS latent variables. An optimal value of w was determined by balancing these two criteria to obtain a reasonable prediction error with a minimum number of latent variables. The optimal value for w was determined to be 0.4 for predicting intracellular TG accumulation and 0.45 to predict urea synthesis, shown in Figs. 3 and 4, respectively.Fig. 3Determining the w value for selecting TG genes. An optimal value for w in Equation 6 was determined by balancing the two criteria of GA/PLS performance: the mean square error of the PLS model prediction (shown in A) and the number of latent variables in the PLS model (shown in B). Different values of w values ranging from 0 to 0.5 were tested while monitoring the above two criteria. An optimal value of 0.4 for w was found for intracellular TG. At this w value, both the number of latent variables and prediction error reach their minimum levels.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Fig. 4Determining w for selecting urea synthesis genes. An optimal value for w in Equation 6 was determined by balancing the two criteria in GA/PLS performance: the mean square error of the PLS model prediction (shown in A) and the number of latent variables in the PLS model (shown in B). Different values of w ranging from 0 to 0.5 were tested while monitoring the above two criteria. An optimal value of 0.45 for w was found for urea synthesis. At this w value, both the number of latent variables and prediction error reach their minimum levels.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Step 3: Reproduction—After the evaluation step, each individual in the population is assigned a probability value according to its fitness value, which determines whether it will be selected to the next iteration or generation in GA. We used roulette selection (16Holland J. Adaptation in Natural and Artificial Systems. University of Michigan Press, Ann Arbor, MI1975Google Scholar) to determine the probability of selecting an individual into the next iteration, Pi=fi∑fi (Eq. 7) where the fitness fi, i = 1, 2,...N of each individual is calculated using the fitness function defined in Equation 6.Step 4: Crossover and Mutation—Crossover and mutation was applied to introduce diversity into the population, which ensures the escape from local optimum in the GA search algorithm. In crossover, two distinct individuals were selected randomly from the population, and some portions of the strings are exchanged with a probability Pc. In mutation, one or more bits of the string are altered with probability Pm. In this study, we applied an arithmetic crossover with a probability of 0.6 and a boundary mutation with probability of 0.05 (see Ref. 17Houck C.R. Joines J.A. Kay M.G.

In other words, different subsets of genes can give the same or nearly the same degree of accuracy in the prediction of the metabolic flux based upon their gene expression level. Therefore, a strategy was developed to identify a group of genes from a multiple of possible solutions. The strategy involved running the GA/PLS model with different initial populations and counting the frequency of appearance of each gene in the multiple solutions. The initial population size ranged from 30 to 100 individuals, and each individual contained a set of different genes. GA/PLS was run 14 times with different initial populations of individuals. A gene was included in the final subset if it was selected by the GA/PLS model in more than half of the runs. Therefore, the genes that appeared more than eight times as a solution in the GA/PLS model were selected into the final gene subset. Similar methods have been applied for wavelength selection in a spectroscopic calibration model (9Leardi R. J. Chemometrics. 2000; 14: 643-655Crossref Scopus (504) Google Scholar).RESULTSGA/PLS Was Applied to Gene Expression and Metabolic Data Obtained from Four Culture Conditions, [H,0], [H,A], [L,0], and [L,A], as described under “Materials and Methods.” The data were separated into three groups, a training ([H,A], [L,0]), monitoring ([H,0]), and testing ([L,A]) set. We investigated the ability of GA/PLS to select a subset of genes able to predict hepatic functions (intracellular TG accumulation and urea synthesis). In addition, the roles of the selected genes in regulating the aforementioned functions were reconstructed with the aid of a literature review. Finally, we evaluated the robustness of the GA/PLS model to noise in the gene expression data.Genes Selected for Intracellular TG—The frequencies of each gene selected by GA/PLS in the multiple runs for intracellular TG are plotted in Fig. 5A. 59 genes were selected with a frequency greater than 8 and are listed in Table I. The selected genes can be categorized into the following groups: fatty acid and lipid metabolism, transcription factors, signal pathways, electron transport chain and oxidative phosphorylation, and ion transporter. A PLS model with two latent variables was constructed to predict intracellular TG based upon the expression level of the 59 genes. As shown in Fig. 5B, intracellular TG was predicted well using the GA/PLS model (mean square error is 0.0425).Fig. 5TG gene selection and metabolic function prediction.A, TG gene frequency. GA/PLS was run 14 times with different initial populations. The frequency at which each gene appeared in the 14 solutions was counted and plotted. Those genes that appeared with a frequency higher than 8 were selected into the final gene subset (shown in Tables I and II) for prediction and pathway reconstruction. B, PLS prediction of TG. The level of TG accumulation was predicted based upon the expression level of the genes selected by GA/PLS.

The molecular mechanism responsible for this characteristic of VEGFR-1 is not known. In this study, we show that VEGFR-1 is devoid of ligand-dependent downregulation and failed to stimulate intracellular calcium release, cell migration and angiogenesis in vitro. To understand the molecular mechanisms responsible for the poor tyrosine autophosphorylation of VEGFR-1, we have either deleted the carboxyl terminus of VEGFR-1 or exchanged it with the carboxyl terminus of VEGFR-2. The deletion of carboxyl terminus of VEGFR-1 did not reverse its defective ligand-dependent autophosphorylation. The carboxyl terminus-swapped VEGFR-1, however, displayed ligand-dependent autophosphorylation, downregulation and also conveyed strong mitogenic responses. Thus, the carboxyl tail of VEGFR-1 restrains the ligand-dependent kinase activation and downregulation of VEGFR-1 and its ability to convey the angiogenic responses in endothelial cells."
https://openalex.org/W2079626857,"p18INK4c, a member of INK4 family of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors, negatively regulates the cyclin D-cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 complexes which promote G1/S transition by phosphorylating the retinoblastoma tumor-suppressor gene product. Several recent studies using p18INK4c-null mice revealed that the p18INK4c plays an important role in cell proliferation and tumor development. We report here that 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), widely used as a protein kinase C (PKC) activator, suppresses the expression of p18INK4c through its promoter, accompanied by the induction of human cancer cell growth. Reduction of p18INK4c using small interfering RNA (siRNA) also enhanced cell growth, suggesting that p18INK4c is a critical target of TPA. Ro 31-8425, a potent and highly specific PKC inhibitor abrogated the suppressive effect of TPA on p18INK4c gene expression. However, the expression of dominant-negative c-Jun (TAM-67) did not inhibit the action of TPA on p18INK4c. These findings suggest that activation of PKC promotes human cancer cell growth through downregulation of p18INK4c in an AP-1 activation-independent manner. These results suggest that the accelerated cellular proliferation of some human tumors caused by enhanced PKC activity at least partially involves the suppression of p18INK4c, which is a ubiquitously expressed cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor."
https://openalex.org/W1977446722,"In response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) exposure, macrophages activate the transcription of a large number of pro-inflammatory genes by way of signaling pathways downstream of the LPS receptor, Toll-Like Receptor 4. Many of these genes are expressed sequentially in time, with early synthesis events resulting in the secretion of soluble factors that drive the transcription of genes expressed later in the activation cycle. In this study we show that human blood-derived macrophages pretreated with oxidized low density lipoprotein (OxLDL) fail to transcribe and secrete interferon beta (IFNβ) immediately following LPS stimulation. As such, the normal downstream activation of Stat1 is blocked, and numerous IFNβ/Stat1-activated genes, including the chemokines IP10 and ITAC, are weakly expressed or not expressed at all in these cells. Inspection of the LPS-induced activation state of several transcription factors known to play a prominent role in IFNβ transcription reveals that, although NFκB, c-Jun, and ATF-2 activation appears normal, the LPS-induced activation of IFNβ regulatory factor 3 (IRF3), as measured by DNA-binding activity and association with the coactivator CBP, is inhibited in the OxLDL pre-treated cells.

Numerous studies support the concept that the oxidation of LDL is a pro-atherogenic process that contributes to a succession of localized arterial wall changes involving several cell types (1Glass C.

Nature. 2002; 420: 868-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (7017) Google Scholar). This facilitates the entry of monocytes, and later, other leukocytes into the arterial wall (1Glass C. Witztum J.L.

Soon after entry, monocytes differentiate into macrophages, which scavenge the OxLDL that has accumulated in the sub-endothelial spaces of the affected artery. As professional scavenger cells, macrophages internalize OxLDL along with resident cell debris. However, the process of scavenging OxLDL, which harbors numerous biologically active molecules, initiates many changes in cell signaling, gene expression, cellular appearance, and function (1Glass C.

Indeed, because the appearance of OxLDL-loaded macrophages is so altered, they are often referred to as foam cells (6Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Annu. Rev.

Nature. 1999; 398: 718-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (1070) Google Scholar). Because macrophages are inflammatory cells, as well as scavenger cells, it is believed that they contribute in important ways to vascular inflammation levels, a critical determinant of atherosclerotic lesion instability (3Libby P. Nature. 2002; 420: 868-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (7017) Google Scholar, 4Ross R. N. Engl. J. Med. 1999; 340: 115-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (19370) Google Scholar, 14Hansson G.K. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2001; 21: 1876-1890Crossref PubMed Scopus (734) Google Scholar). Activated macrophages are a major source of the soluble factors that coordinate the infiltration and local inflammatory response of numerous leukocytes in various tissue settings (15Abbas A.K. Lichtman A.H. Pober J.S. Cellular and Molecular Immunology. W. B. Saunders and Co., Philadelphia, PA2000: 270-290Google Scholar). Dysregulation or imbalances in these responses can lead to unresolved or chronic inflammatory states (16Nathan C. Nature. 2002; 420: 846-852Crossref PubMed Scopus (2051) Google Scholar). Indeed, late stage atherosclerotic lesions often have features associated with sites of chronic inflammation, such as enrichment of inflammatory cells, persistent cell damage, local tissue remodeling, and fibrosis (1Glass C. Witztum J.L. Cell. 2001; 104: 503-516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2654) Google Scholar, 3Libby P. Nature. 2002; 420: 868-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (7017) Google Scholar). Furthermore, increases in circulating inflammatory factors like C-reactive protein and IL6 have been shown to be independent predictors of future cardiovascular disease (13Gerszten R.E. Garcia-Zepeda E.A. Lim Y.C. Yoshida M. Ding H.A. Gimbrone Jr., M.A. Luster A.D. Luscinskas F.W. Rosenzweig A. Nature. 1999; 398: 718-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (1070) Google Scholar,17Blake G.J.

Other studies have implicated a role for infectious agents, like Chlamydia pneumoniae, in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis (14Hansson G.K. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2001; 21: 1876-1890Crossref PubMed Scopus (734) Google Scholar, 18Kalayoglu M.V. Libby P. Byrne G.I. JAMA. 2002; 288: 2724-2731Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 19Espinola-Klein C. Rupprecht H.J. Blankenberg S. Bickel C. Kopp H. Rippin G. Victor A. Hafner G. Schlumberger W. Meyer J. Athero. Gene Investigators Circulation. 2002; 105: 15-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). In addition, several receptors of the innate immune system are overexpressed in human lesions (20Edfeldt K. Swedenborg J. Hansson G.K. Yan Z.Q. Circulation. 2002; 105: 1158-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (750) Google Scholar). A polymorphism in one of these receptors, the LPS receptor, Toll-like Receptor 4 (TLR4), has been shown to be associated with a reduced risk of atherosclerosis in humans (21Kiechl S. Lorenz E. Reindl M. Wiedermann C.J. Oberhollenzer F. Bonora E. Willeit J. Schwartz D.A. N. Engl. J. Med. 2002; 347: 185-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (944) Google Scholar), presumably because of the reduced inflammatory signaling associated with this receptor variant. Consequently, recent studies have begun to focus on ways in which the inflammatory response of arterial macrophages and macrophage foam cells may exacerbate the development of vascular disease and thus represent an area for therapeutic intervention (12Ito T. Ikeda U. Curr. Drug Targets Inflamm. Allergy. 2003; 2: 257-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 22Cascieri M.A. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2002; 1: 122-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In an earlier report, we described the results of a DNA microarray study that characterized the altered gene expression responses of OxLDL pre-treated THP1 macrophages to LPS stimulation (23Mikita T. Porter G. Lawn R.M. Shiffman D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45729-45739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). This study revealed numerous early and late changes in the LPS-induced inflammatory cascade, often involving inappropriate cytokine and chemokine transcription levels. In particular, a group of late expressed genes, which included the chemokines IP10 and ITAC, were no longer seen to be induced by LPS treatment in these OxLDL pre-treated cells. In the current study we show that human blood-derived macrophages pre-treated with OxLDL fail to transcribe and secrete interferon β (IFNβ) immediately following LPS stimulation. As such, the downstream activation of Stat1 is blocked, and numerous IFNβ/Stat1-activated genes, like IP10 and ITAC, are weakly expressed or not expressed at all in these cells. OxLDL inhibits IFNβ transcription by apparently blocking the activation of the transcription factor IRF3, a step that has previously been shown to be essential for the initiation of transcription from the IFNβ promoter (24Suhara W. Yoneyama M. Kitabayashi I. Fujita T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22304-22313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 25Yang H. Lin C.H. Ma G. Orr M. Baffi M.O. Wathelet M.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 6142-6151Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Cell Culture—Human monocyte-derived macrophages were isolated as described previously (26Soutar A.K. Knight B.L. Biochem. J. 1982; 204: 549-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Briefly, buffy coats from individual blood donors were adjusted to 75 ml with PBS containing 1 mm disodium EDTA and layered onto Ficoll-Paque (Amersham Biosciences). Following centrifugation at room temperature for 30 min at 400 × g the layer of mononuclear cells was removed, diluted with three volumes of PBS/EDTA, and centrifuged at 800 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The cells were washed three times with PBS/EDTA by centrifugation at 4 °C for 10 min at 100 × g and once with RPMI 1640 medium (Cellgro, Mediatech) without serum. The cells were then resuspended in RPMI 1640 medium without serum and plated at 5 × 106 cells per well in 6-well tissue culture trays or at 12 × 106 cells per T-25 flask. After 2 h, non-adherent cells were removed by washing with RPMI 1640, and the medium was replaced with RPMI 1640 containing 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. This medium was changed two to three times over the course of 12 days of growth and differentiation. On day 12 the medium was replaced again by medium with or without 100 μg/ml human oxidized LDL (prepared by CuSO4 oxidation of LDL; Intracel Corp., Rockville, MD), and the cells were allowed to grow for 3 more days. The cells were then treated with 0.5 μg/ml LPS to activate the macrophages. In some experiments, 3000 units/ml human IFNβ (BIOSOURCE International; units are those of supplier) was used to activate the macrophages. Depending on the experiment, RNA, supernatants, whole cell lysates, and/or nuclear extract samples were then harvested according to procedures listed below and at the times indicated. These samples were then assayed as described below for individual experiments. RNA Isolation and mRNA Quantitation—Total RNA extraction, cDNA synthesis, and real-time, quantitative RT-PCR were performed as previously described (23Mikita T. Porter G. Lawn R.M. Shiffman D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45729-45739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). ELISA Measurements—Blood-derived macrophages were isolated and allowed to differentiate as described above. The cells were then pre-treated with or without OxLDL for an additional 3 days and then treated with LPS, as described. Culture media was collected at 0, 1, 3, 6, and 9 h following LPS stimulation. Supernatants were then assayed by ELISA for the presence of IFNβ, IP10, and ITAC using reagents and protocols of the supplier (BIOSOURCE International for IFNβ and IP10, and R&D Systems for ITAC). Western Blots and Co-immunoprecipitations—SDS Western blots were run following standard procedures. The blots were probed using the following antibodies. Stat1, Stat1-p(Tyr-701), c-Jun, c-Jun-p(Ser-73), ATF2, ATF2-p(Thr-71), p38, p-p38(Thr-180/Tyr-182), and p-NFκB p65 (Ser-536) antibodies were from Cell Signaling Technology. NFκB p50(H119) and NFκB p65(A) antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. IRF3 antibodies were from Active Motif. Co-immunoprecipitations were done as follows. Blood-derived macrophages were isolated and allowed to differentiate as described above. The cells were then pre-treated with or without OxLDL for an additional 3 days and then treated with LPS, as described. The cells were harvested at 0, 45, and 120 min post LPS treatment, in an Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (50 mm Tris/Cl, pH 8.0, 1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl), supplemented with 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 100 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate) and then vortexed to produce the whole cell extract. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation (14,000 rpm, 10 min). 0.2–0.4 ml of lysate (containing ∼200–400 μg of protein) was mixed with 10 μl of IRF3 antibody and kept on ice for 30 min. Then 25 μl of protein G-agarose beads (Pierce) were added to the mix, which was then rotated for 1–2 h at 4 °C. The beads were then spun down and washed five times with 0.6 ml of Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer. The bead-bound protein was then extracted in SDS sample buffer and analyzed by standard SDS-PAGE. Following transfer, the blots were probed with CBP(A-22) antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Nuclear Extracts and EMSAs—Nuclear extract preparation, generation of probes, and DNA binding conditions for gel shift mobility assays followed standard protocols that have been described previously (27Osborn L. Kunkel S. Nable G.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 2336-2340Crossref PubMed Scopus (1373) Google Scholar). The following oligonucleotide and its complement were used to generate the NFκB-specific probe: 5′-AGTTGAGGGGACTTTCCCAGGC-3′. Pull-down Assay—We followed a procedure similar to that reported by Sgarbanti et al. (28Sgarbanti M. Borsetti A. Moscufo N. Bellocchi M.C. Ridolfi B. Nappi F. Marsili G. Marziali G. Coccia E.M. Ensoli B. Battistini A. J. Exp. Med. 2002; 195: 1359-1370Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Briefly, a biotinylated oligonucleotide corresponding to the human ISG15 ISRE (5′-GATCCATGCCTCGGGAAAGGGAAACCGAAACTGAAGCC-3′) was synthesized and annealed to its compliment in a standard annealing buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA). 100 pmol of biotinylated DNA were then mixed with 500–1000 μg of nuclear extract (prepared as described above) in a standard binding buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 75 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 20% glycerol, 10 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 0.3 μg/ml poly(dI-dC), and incubated at room temperature for 20 min. This DNA·protein mixture was then added to a 50-μl slurry of pre-washed streptavidin-agarose beads (Sigma-Aldrich) and allowed to mix by rotation for 40 min at 4 °C, followed by further mixing at room temperature for an additional 10 min. At this point, the DNA·protein·bead complex was spun down, the supernatant was removed, and the beads were washed four times in 400 μl of binding buffer. Protein was eluted from the beads into SDS sample buffer, separated on 7.5% SDS-PAGE, then immunoblotted with antibody against IRF3 (Active Motif). Human blood-derived macrophages were isolated and allowed to differentiate in culture for 12 days, following standard procedures for the establishment of blood-derived macrophage cultures (26Soutar A.K. Knight B.L. Biochem. J. 1982; 204: 549-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). On day 12, the cells were treated with OxLDL for an additional 3 days, to lipid load the cells and establish a foam cell-like phenotype based on increased levels of oil red-o staining of neutral lipids, and the increased expression of several marker genes, including ABCA1, ABCG1, Adipophilin, and FABP4 (as determined by RT-PCR, data not shown). Control cells were maintained in culture for the same length of time with no OxLDL treatment. The cells were then treated with LPS, and supernatants and RNA were collected at various times. Fig. 1 shows the results of ELISA measurements that were made to determine the amount of IP10 and ITAC being secreted into the media by these cells. As the data in this figure show, the LPS-inducible secretion of both IP10 (Fig. 1A) and ITAC (Fig. 1B) is dramatically reduced in the OxLDL pretreated blood-derived macrophages. RT-PCR analysis of mRNA isolated from these same cells showed that inhibition of LPS-induced ITAC and IP10 production occurred at the level of transcription (data not shown). Results from other groups have shown that both of these genes can be induced in macrophages by a number of stimuli, including IFNβ (29Toshchakov V. Jones B.W. Perera P.Y. Thomas K. Cody M.J. Zhang S. Williams B.R. Major J. Hamilton T.A. Fenton M.J. Vogel S.N. Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 392-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (682) Google Scholar, 30Widney D.P. Xia Y.R. Lusis A.J. Smith J.B. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 6322-6331Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Additional studies have shown that LPS treatment of macrophages immediately activates the transcription and secretion of IFNβ (29Toshchakov V. Jones B.W. Perera P.Y. Thomas K. Cody M.J. Zhang S. Williams B.R. Major J. Hamilton T.A. Fenton M.J. Vogel S.N. Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 392-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (682) Google Scholar, 31Doyle S. Vaidya S. O'Connell R. Dadgostar H. Dempsey P. Wu T. Rao G. Sun R. Haberland M. Modlin R. Cheng G. Immunity. 2002; 17: 251-263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (734) Google Scholar). Accordingly, we investigated whether defects in LPS-induced IFNβ production could account for the lack of IP10 and ITAC synthesis in the OxLDL pre-treated cells. As the RT-PCR data in Fig. 2A show, LPS induces a rapid, but transient, increase in IFNβ transcription in the control cells. In contrast, the OxLDL pre-treated cells show an almost total absence of LPS-induced IFN β transcription over the course of 9 h of observation. As the ELISA data in Fig. 2B show, LPS induces secretion of IFNβ in the control cells starting after 1 h. In contrast, very little IFNβ secretion is measured in the OxLDL pre-treated cells. These data show that LPS-induced IFNβ production is blocked in OxLDL pretreated cells and that the inhibition occurs at the level of transcription. The RT-PCR data in Fig. 2C are included to show that the LPS-induced transcription of another immediate early gene, TNFα, proceeds normally in the OxLDL pre-treated cells. Further support linking the early inhibition of IFNβ synthesis and secretion with the late inhibition of IP10 and ITAC synthesis was found in an additional set of experiments. Human blood-derived macrophages were isolated and allowed to differentiate in culture as before. The cells were then pretreated with OxLDL for 3 days, followed by treatment with IFNβ. Control cells were treated with IFNβ only. RNA was collected at various times and analyzed. As the RT-PCR data in Fig. 3 show, treatment with IFNβ stimulated an increase in IP10 transcription in the OxLDL pre-treated cells that approached that of the control cells. Similar results were obtained for IFNβ-induced ITAC expression (data not shown). These data strongly suggest that it is the absence of LPS-induced IFNβ production that is responsible for the lack of IP10 and ITAC expression seen in the OxLDL/LPS-treated cells. Because IFNβ is known to act in an autocrine/paracrine fashion to activate a second wave of transcription, largely through the activation of the transcription factor Stat1 (29Toshchakov V. Jones B.W. Perera P.Y. Thomas K. Cody M.J. Zhang S. Williams B.R. Major J. Hamilton T.A. Fenton M.J. Vogel S.N. Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 392-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (682) Google Scholar), we also checked the level of LPS-induced Stat1 activation in blood-derived macrophages. Cells were isolated, cultured, and treated with OxLDL and LPS as before. Cell lysates were prepared at various times following LPS treatment and analyzed on protein gels. As the data in Fig. 4 show, there is an equivalent level of Stat1 in both the control and OxLDL pretreated cells, but only in the LPS-treated control cells does the active form of Stat1 appear. These results are thus consistent with the levels of IFNβ production seen in both the control and OxLDL pre-treated cells. We also examined the expression levels of other IFNβ- and Stat1-activated genes identified from the literature. As before, macrophage cells were isolated, cultured, and treated with OxLDL for 3 days, followed by LPS treatment. Control cells were treated with LPS only. RNA was collected at various times and analyzed. As the RT-PCR data in Fig. 5 show, the LPS-induced expression levels of the chemokines, RANTES and MCP2; the tryptophan-catabolizing enzyme, indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase; the antiviral protein, ISG54; and the IFN regulatory factors, IRF2 and IRF7b, were all found to be inhibited in the OxLDL pre-treated macrophages. Because these genes have all been shown to be either IFNβ- or Stat1-responsive (32Marie I. Durbin J.E. Levy D.E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6660-6669Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33Nakaya T. Sato M. Hata N.

FEBS Lett. 2002; 511: 41-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), these data are consistent with the lack of IFNβ production and Stat 1 activation seen in the OxLDL/LPS-treated cells. The next question we addressed was how OxLDL pre-treatment interferes with LPS-induced IFNβ transcription in human blood-derived macrophages. Previous work by others has identified the binding sites for numerous transcription factors within the IFNβ promoter (38Agalioti T. Lomvardas S. Parekh B. Yie J. Maniatis T. Thanos D. Cell. 2000; 103: 667-678Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar, 39Falvo J.V. Parekh B.S. Lin C.H. Fraenkel E. Maniatis T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4814-4825Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Prominent among these factors are NFκB, c-Jun, ATF2, and IRF3 (40Wathelet M.G. Lin C.H. Parekh B.S. Ronco L.V. Howley P.M. Maniatis T. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 507-518Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar). We thus investigated the LPS-induced activation state of these four transcription factors in the control and OxLDL pre-treated cells. Cells were isolated, cultured, and treated with OxLDL and LPS as before. Nuclear extracts or whole cell lysates were prepared at various times following LPS stimulation. Transcription factor activity was assessed in these extracts and lysates as described below. The EMSA result in Fig 6A shows the LPS-induced NFκB DNA binding signal in both the control and OxLDL pre-treated cell nuclear extracts. NFκB is similarly induced by LPS in both the control and OxLDL pre-treated cells. The NFκB activity induced consists of both p65 and p50 subunits, because antibodies against both NFκB forms supershift the LPS-inducible bands (data not shown). The stimulus-induced phosphorylation of NFκB at serine 536 is a modification known to augment NFκB transactivation potential (41Yang F. Tang E. Guan K. Wang C.Y. J. Immunol. 2003; 170: 5630-5635Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar), but here too we observed no difference in LPS-induced phosphorylation intensity between the control and OxLDL pre-treated cells (data not shown). Fig. 6B shows a Western blot measuring the amount of phosphorylated c-Jun, the active form of the transcription factor, induced by LPS in both control and OxLDL pre-treated whole cell lysates. The active form of c-Jun is similarly induced by LPS in both control and OxLDL pre-treated cells, although there is some level of activation seen in the OxLDL pre-treated cells prior to LPS addition (lane 4). Finally, Fig. 6C shows a Western blot measuring the amount of phosphorylated ATF2, the active form of the transcription factor, induced by LPS in both the control and OxLDL pre-treated whole cell lysates. The active form of ATF2 is similarly induced by LPS in both control and OxLDL pre-treated cells. The LPS-induced phosphorylation state of P38, an upstream activating kinase of ATF2, was also found to be comparable in the control and OxLDL pretreated cells (data not shown). Thus, the LPS-induced activation of NFκB, c-Jun, and ATF2, three transcription factors known to be essential for the activation of IFNβ transcription (39Falvo J.V. Parekh B.S. Lin C.H. Fraenkel E. Maniatis T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4814-4825Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 40Wathelet M.G. Lin C.H. Parekh B.S. Ronco L.V. Howley P.M. Maniatis T. Mol.

These figures were representative of data obtained from similarly treated macrophages isolated from several different blood donors. We next measured the LPS-inducible DNA-binding activity of IRF3 in a standard pull-down assay. In this experiment, nuclear extracts are combined with a biotinylated DNA duplex that contains an IRF3 binding site. After a period of incubation, any DNA·protein complexes that form are pulled down with streptavidin-coated agarose beads via centrifugation. Bound protein is identified by SDS-PAGE, followed by immunoblotting with antibodies for IRF3. Th"

H+-PPases represent a distinct class of ion translocases with no sequence similarity to ubiquitous ATP-energized pumps such as the F-, V-, or P-type ATPases or ABC transporters (4Rea P.A. Kim Y. Sarafian V. Poole R.J. Davies J.M. Sanders D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 348-353Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The distribution of H+-PPase among the species is wide, but sporadic. H+-PPase has been identified in most plants, some algae, protists, bacteria, and Archaea, but not in mammals. In prokaryotic species, H+-PPase resides in the cytoplasmic membrane and pumps protons away from the cytoplasm, whereas in eukaryotic species the enzyme acidifies internal organelles such as vacuoles in plants (2Maeshima M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1465: 37-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar, 3Drozdowicz Y.M. Rea P.A.

Parasitol. 2001; 114: 151-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Moreover, H+-PPases have recently been identified in the plasma membranes of protozoa (6McIntosh M.T. Drozdowicz Y.M.

H+-PPase is a highly hydrophobic protein, as evident from the 14–16 transmembrane spans predicted by computer modeling (Fig. 1). Sequences from different species display at least 30% identity, and most of the 60 conserved residues are clustered in three hydrophilic regions comprising cytosolic loops that probably form the active site. These residues include four Glu residues (Fig. 1) that are present in all 50 of the known H+-PPase sequences. H+-PPase acts specifically on PPi and requires Mg2+ for activity (13Rao P.V. Keister D.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1978; 84: 465-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 14Baltscheffsky M. Nyrén P.

Mg2+ binds and activates both free enzyme and PPi. Some H+-PPases additionally require potassium for activity (2Maeshima M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1465: 37-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar, 16Belogurov G.A. Lahti R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49651-49654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). A common property of H+-PPases that distinguishes them from their soluble counterparts is high sensitivity to competitive inhibition by aminomethylenediphosphonate (AMDP) and relative insensitivity to inhibition by fluoride (17Baykov A.A. Dubnova E.B. Bakuleva N.P. Evtushenko O.A. Zhen R.G. Rea P.A. FEBS Lett. 1993; 327: 199-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Moreover, H+-PPases are highly sensitive to sulfhydryl reagents, such as mersalyl and N-ethylmaleimide, and the carboxyl group reagent dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (2Maeshima M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1465: 37-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). The development of expression systems for plant H+-PPases in yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae (9Kim E.J. Zhen R.G. Rea P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6128-6132Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) and bacterial H+-PPases in Escherichia coli (18Belogurov G.A. Turkina M.V. Penttinen A. Vanhatalo S. Baykov A.A. Lahti R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 15: 15Google Scholar) has paved the way for site-directed mutagenesis of these proton pumps. This approach was successfully employed to identify membrane-embedded charged residues contributing to dicyclohexylcarbodiimide binding in H+-PPases (19Zhen R.G. Kim E.J. Rea P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22340-22348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), reactive Cys residues (18Belogurov G.A. Turkina M.V. Penttinen A. Vanhatalo S. Baykov A.A. Lahti R. J.

Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49651-49654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The role of conserved residues possibly located in the cytosol is more difficult to analyze, because their substitution results in an inactive enzyme (21Nakanishi Y. Saijo T. Wada Y. Maeshima M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7654-7660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Here we perform site-directed mutagenesis of all four conserved glutamate residues, Glu197, Glu202, Glu550, and Glu649, in the H+-PPase of Rho-dospirillum rubrum. All of the residues were functionally substituted with aspartates or alanines except Glu202, which was only replaceable by aspartate. All of the glutamates appeared to be essential for catalytic efficiency at low Mg2+ concentrations. Our data indicate that Glu197 and Glu202 contribute to substrate binding, whereas Glu550 and Glu649 control R-PPase conformation. Plasmid Construction and R-PPase Expression—The construct comprising the full-length R-PPase gene (22Baltscheffsky M. Nadanaciva S. Schultz A. Biochim. Biophys.

Mutagenesis was performed by an overlapping PCR technique using the Stratagene QuikChange™ kit and the primers listed in Table I. All mutations were verified by DNA sequencing. Wild-type and variant R-PPases were expressed in E. coli C43(DE3) cells, and inner membrane vesicles (IMVs) were isolated as described previously (18Belogurov G.A. Turkina M.V. Penttinen A. Vanhatalo S. Baykov A.A. Lahti R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 15: 15Google Scholar). Protein concentrations in E. coli IMV were estimated using the Bradford assay (23Bradford M.M. Anal.

Open table in a new tab Activity Measurements—PPi hydrolysis was assayed by continuously recording Pi liberation with an automatic Pi analyzer (24Baykov A.A. Avaeva S.M. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 116: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) at 25 °C. Reactions were performed in an initial volume of 25 ml including pH buffer, calculated amounts of MgCl2 and Na4PPi, and 5–50 μl of IMV suspension. The reaction was initiated by the addition of IMVs in measurements of rate as a function of [Mg2+] and [Mg2PPi] or the simultaneous addition of MgCl2 and Na4PPi in all other measurements. Pi liberation was monitored for 3 min. The following 0.1 m buffers were used at a pH equal to their pKa values: MES, pH 6.1; MOPSO, pH 6.9; MOPS, pH 7.2; TES, pH 7.4; TAPSO, pH 7.6; HEPPSO, pH 7.8; Tricine, pH 8.1; TAPS, pH 8.4; CAPSO, pH 9.6; and CAPS, pH 10.4. The pH was adjusted using KOH, and the indicated amounts of EGTA were added as follows: 50–100 μm, pH 6.1–8.1; 10 μm, pH 8.4; and 1 μm, 9.6–10.4. The resulting ionic strength of the buffers was 0.1 m, and the K+ concentration was 50 mm. In experiments measuring the inhibitory effects of aminomethylenediphosphonate, methylenediphosphonate, or mersalyl, IMVs were preincubated with these reagents for the times indicated in Figs. 4 and 5. H+ translocation across the IMV membrane was assayed with acridine orange as described in a previous report (18Belogurov G.A. Turkina M.V. Penttinen A. Vanhatalo S. Baykov A.A. Lahti R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 15: 15Google Scholar).Fig. 5Mg2+ concentration dependence of wild-type and variant R-PPase inactivation by mersalyl. IMVs were incubated with mersalyl for 10 min (wild-type, E197D, and E202D), 2 min (E649D), or 1 min (E550D) at the indicated Mg2+ concentrations. Other details were as for Fig. 4. Lines are drawn in accordance with Equations 5 and 6 using the parameter values specified in Table II.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Calculations and Data Analysis—The amounts of MgCl2 and PPi required to achieve the desired concentrations of free Mg2+ and the Mg2PPi complex in the presence of 50 mm K+ were calculated using the apparent dissociation constants for the magnesium and potassium complexes of PPi at pH 7.2 (25Baykov A.A. Bakuleva N.P. Rea P.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 217: 755-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Values for the apparent (Mg2+ concentration-dependent) catalytic constant (khapp) and Michaelis constant (Kmapp) were determined by fitting Equation 1, shown here, Â Î½/[E]0=khapp1+Kmapp/[Mg2PPi]Â(Eq. 1) to the hydrolysis rate (v) as a function of Mg2PPi concentration. The dependence of khapp and khapp/Kmapp on Mg2+ concentration is described in Scheme I, a depiction of R-PPase catalysis of PPi hydrolysis, amp; EM2amp;↑↓KM2 SCHEME I amp; EM⇌KmEM3PP→khamp;↑↓KM1↑↓KA2 amp;E EM2PP→kh′amp; ↑↓KA1amp; EMPP in which E represents enzyme, M is Mg2+,PPisPPi, KM1, KM2, KA1, and KA2 are dissociation constants, Km is the Michaelis constant, and kh and k′h depict Mg2+ concentration-independent catalytic constants. Scheme I assumes that enzyme species lacking substrates are in equilibrium with one another, similar to the case with all enzyme-substrate species. This is a minimal scheme in that the addition of more enzyme species did not significantly affect the quality of the fit, whereas omitting any species, except the dimagnesium metal complex (EM2), resulted in a poor fit. The EM2 complex was stoichiometrically significant for only two variant R-PPases. This scheme is principally similar to that derived for authentic R-PPase in R. rubrum chromatophore membranes (26Baykov A.A. Sergina N.V. Evtushenko O.A. Dubnova E.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 236: 121-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The Mg2+ concentration dependences of khapp and khapp/Kmapp are specified by Equations 2 and 3, shown here, Âkhapp=kh+khâ€²KA2/[Mg]1+KA2/[Mg]+KA1KA2/[Mg]2Â(Eq. 2) khapp/Kmapp=kh+kh′KA2/[Mg]Km(1+KM1/[Mg]+[Mg]/KM2) (Eq. 3) which were used to calculate the initial estimates of all parameters in Scheme I. These initial estimates were further refined by simultaneously fitting Equations 1, 2, and 3 to the rate as a function of both [Mg2PP i] and [Mg2+]. The pH dependence of kh was fitted to Equation 4, kh=kh,ind1+[H+]/Ka1+Ka2/[H+] (Eq. 4) where kh,ind is the pH-independent value of kh, and Ka1 and Ka2 are the ionization constants of essential base and acid, respectively. The time courses of the slow phase of R-PPase inactivation by mersalyl were fitted to Equation 5, A=Aoe−k[Mers]t (Eq. 5) where A0 is the residual activity observed after the “instant” inactivation phase, A is activity at time t, k is the second-order rate constant, and [Mers] depicts mersalyl concentration. The dependence of k on Mg2+ concentration is estimated by Equation 6, k=kEM,mers+(kE,mers−kEM,mers)[Mg]/KM,mers1+[Mg]/KM,mers (Eq. 6) where kE,mers and kEM,mers are the second-order rate constants for inactivation at 0 and infinite Mg2+ concentrations, respectively, and KM,mers refers to the dissociation constant for the R-PPase-Mg2+ complex (26Baykov A.A. Sergina N.V. Evtushenko O.A. Dubnova E.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 236: 121-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Competitive inhibition of PPi hydrolysis by diphosphonates was analyzed with Equation 7, ν/[E]0=khapp1+Kmapp(1+[I]/Ki)/[Mg2PPi] (Eq. 7) where [I] is the diphosphonate concentration and Ki is the inhibition constant. The Mg2PPi concentration was maintained at 50 μm in this experiment. The parameters, khapp and Kmapp, were constrained to the values derived from the dependence of v/[E]0 on [Mg2PPi] in the absence of diphosphonates. The equation was fitted to data using the programs SCIENTIST 2.01 (MicroMath) and Origin 6.1 (OriginLab). Hydrolytic and Proton-pumping Activities of R-PPase Variants—Each of the four conserved glutamate residues in R-PPase was individually substituted with aspartate and alanine, and the resulting variants were expressed in E. coli C43(DE3). Western analysis of E. coli IMVs with R-PPase antibodies (22Baltscheffsky M. Nadanaciva S. Schultz A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1364: 301-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) revealed that the expression levels of all the variants were similar to that of the wild-type enzyme (data not shown). The hydrolytic activities of R-PPase variants were assayed in IMVs at saturating substrate and Mg2+ concentrations. Specifically, the E197D, E197A, E202D, E550D, E550A, E649D, and E649A variants displayed 60, 60, 35, 50, 50, 45, and 20% of the wild-type R-PPase activity, respectively. However, following E202A substitution, activity declined to a level indistinguishable from the background in our system (∼ 5% of wild-type R-PPase activity). Interestingly, the replacement of Glu197 or Glu550 by alanine did not induce a further decrease in activity as compared with substitution with aspartate. Moreover, all variants capable of PPi hydrolysis were additionally active in PPi-energized H+ translocation in E. coli IMV (Fig. 2). The magnitude of acridine orange fluorescence quenching correlated with the relative activity of H+-PPases, suggesting that the substitutions did not affect the coupling between PPi hydrolysis and H+ translocation. Steady-state Kinetic Analysis of Mg2+Activation—To further investigate the role of the conserved glutamates in H+-PPases, a detailed kinetic analysis of the Glu → Asp variants was performed. The dependence of the PPi hydrolysis rate on substrate (Mg2PPi) concentration obeyed Michaelis-Menten kinetics at a fixed free Mg2+ concentration (data not shown). The apparent catalytic constant (khapp) and its ratio with the Michaelis constant (khapp/Kmapp) derived from these dependences are depicted in Fig. 3 as functions of Mg2+ concentration. The khapp profiles are similar for the wild-type and all variant enzymes, whereas the khapp/Kmapp profiles are different. Thus, the khapp/Kmapp value decreases with increasing Mg2+ concentrations for the wild-type enzyme, increases to a saturating value for the E197D and E202D variants, and displays a maximum for the E550D and E649D variants. The simplest kinetic model quantitatively accounting for the dependences shown in Fig. 3 is presented in Scheme I. This model implies that substrate (Mg2PPi) binds to a preformed enzyme-metal complex (EM). The dimagnesium-enzyme complex, EM2, is included to explain the decrease in khapp/Kmapp at the high Mg2+ concentrations observed with the E550D and E649D variants. This species is stoichiometrically insignificant for wild-type R-PPase and the E197D and E202D variants. The scheme contains three enzyme-PPi complexes of different Mg2+ content, with only two being catalytically competent. Numerical values for all the parameters in Scheme I that were obtained by fitting Equations 1, 2, and 3 to the rate data, as described under “Experimental Procedures,” are listed in Table II.Table IIKinetic parameters for wild-type and variant R-PPasesParameterValueWTWTaLiterature data for authentic R-PPase of R. rubrum chromatophores at pH 7.5 (26).E197DE202DE550DE649Dkh (μmol min-1 mg-1)0.76 ± 0.020.18 ± 0.010.52 ± 0.010.28 ± 0.010.44 ± 0.010.34 ± 0.01kh′ (μmol min-1 mg-1)0.76 ± 0.020.18 ± 0.01<0.04<0.04<0.04<0.04KM1 (mm)0.016 ± 0.0190.66 ± 0.070.22 ± 0.020.22 ± 0.030.05 ± 0.020.57 ± 0.11KM2 (mm)>200>200>20090 ± 4017 ± 4Km (μm)5.1 ± 0.23.6 ± 0.33.1 ± 0.14.5 ± 0.33.1 ± 0.27.7 ± 0.7KA1 (mm)0.46 ± 0.090.05 ± 0.020.28 ± 0.090.02 ± 0.01KA2 (mm)0.14 ± 0.021.2 ± 0.60.11 ± 0.030.24 ± 0.08KA1KA2 (mm2)0.0480.060.0310.0380.03 ± 0.0020.09 ± 0.01kE,mers (m-1s-1)210 ± 10197 ± 8203 ± 43900 ± 600860 ± 40kEM,mers (m-1s-1)11 ± 114 ± 110 ± 1470 ± 8039 ± 2KM,mers (μm)61 ± 57484 ± 979 ± 263 ± 3117 ± 9Ki for AMDP (μm)bMeasured at 2 mm Mg2+.0.08 ± 0.010.33 ± 0.040.49 ± 0.070.05 ± 0.010.64 ± 0.11Ki for MDP (μm)bMeasured at 2 mm Mg2+.2.5 ± 0.47.1 ± 1.012.0 ± 1.83.0 ± 0.420 ± 4kh,ind (μmol min-1 mg-1)cMeasured at 20 mm Mg2+.1.33 ± 0.100.86 ± 0.060.42 ± 0.020.55 ± 0.040.93 ± 0.43pKa1cMeasured at 20 mm Mg2+.6.3 ± 0.16.4 ± 0.16.5 ± 0.16.0 ± 0.26.9 ± 0.3pKa2cMeasured at 20 mm Mg2+.8.3 ± 0.18.5 ± 0.18.9 ± 0.18.3 ± 0.17.2 ± 0.3a Literature data for authentic R-PPase of R. rubrum chromatophores at pH 7.5 (26Baykov A.A.

Open table in a new tab As EM3PP is always dominant over EM2PP due to cooperative Mg2+ binding by the enzyme-PPi complex (KA1 > KA2; Table II), the quality of the fit, as characterized by the sum of the squares of residuals, was rather insensitive to the value of kh′ with the wild-type enzyme. Thus, varying kh′ in the range of 0.4–3 μmol min–1 mg–1 (i. e. from 50 to 400% kh) increased the sum of the residual squares by only 4%. However, setting kh′ to 0 increased the sum by 80%, resulting in an unsatisfactory fit. Therefore, we assumed that kh′ = kh, as was shown previously for authentic R-PPase isolated from R. rubrum chromatophores (26Baykov A.A. Sergina N.V. Evtushenko O.A. Dubnova E.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 236: 121-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). In contrast, setting kh′ to 0 was required to obtain an acceptable fit for all variant R-PPases. For the three active Glu → Ala variants (E197A, E550A, and E649A), the khapp/Kmapp values were lower by a factor of 3.5–9 at 0.1 mm Mg2+ as compared with that at 2 mm Mg2+ (data not shown). In this respect, alanine variants were similar to aspartate mutants (Fig. 3B). The absolute values of khapp/Kmapp were similar to those measured for the corresponding Glu → Asp variants. Dependence of kapph on pH—The pH dependences of khapp for the wild-type and variant R-PPases were bell-shaped (data not shown), indicating that one basic and one acidic group is necessary for the substrate conversion step. In this respect, R-PPase is similar to the H+-PPase of the plant Vigna radiata (25Baykov A.A. Bakuleva N.P. Rea P.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 217: 755-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The two corresponding pKa values, along with the pH-independent values of the catalytic constant, kh,ind, derived from these dependences with Equation 4 are listed in Table II. The effects of the mutations on the pKa values were insignificant except for the observed increase in pKa2 by 0.6 in the E202D variant, the increase in pKa1 by 0.6, and the decrease in pKa2 by 1.1 in the E649D variant. Interestingly, the pH-independent kh values for the E649D variant and the wild-type enzyme were similar within the combined experimental error, indicating that the low khapp value for the E649D variant observed at pH 7.2 is due to the effect of the substitution on the pKa of ionizing groups rather than to intrinsic catalytic efficiency. Mersalyl Inactivation and Mg2+Binding—R-PPase contains three mersalyl-reactive Cys residues (18Belogurov G.A. Turkina M.V. Penttinen A. Vanhatalo S. Baykov A.A. Lahti R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 15: 15Google Scholar). Modification of Cys222 occurs nearly instantly and decreases enzyme activity slightly (typically by ∼10%), whereas modification of Cys185 and Cys573 can be resolved in time and render R-PPase completely inactive. Cys185 and Cys573 modifications are protected by Mg2+ binding. To compare the effects of the mutations on mersalyl inactivation, an additional C185G substitution corresponding to the naturally occurring isoform was introduced to block Mg2+-dependent inactivation resulting from Cys185 modification (18Belogurov G.A. Turkina M.V. Penttinen A. Vanhatalo S. Baykov A.A. Lahti R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 15: 15Google Scholar). The C185G substitution did not affect the hydrolytic and transport activities of the variant and wild-type R-PPase (data not shown) but made the slower inactivation step a first-order reaction at a fixed mersalyl concentration (Fig. 4), thus facilitating quantitative analysis. The values of the second-order rate constants for inactivation in the absence of Mg2+ (kE,mers) and at saturating Mg2+ concentrations (kEM,mers) derived from the time-course experiments depicted in Fig. 4 were similar for wild-type, E197D, and E202D variants (Table II). In contrast, the E550D and E649D substitutions increased the kE,mers values by factors of 20 and 4 and the kEM,mers values by factors of 40 and 4, respectively. In all cases, Mg2+ afforded substantial protection against mersalyl inactivation (kE,mers > kEM,mers). In the E550D variant, the kE,mers/kEM,mers ratio decreased by a factor of ∼2, which indicates that, upon Mg2+ binding, the conformational change that inhibits the reactivity of Cys573 in R-PPase toward SH reagents becomes partially compromised. The values of the dissociation constant governing Mg2+ binding to R-PPase and its variants (KM,mers) were estimated from the protection afforded by this cation against enzyme inactivation by mersalyl (Fig. 5). The dependences shown in Fig. 5 were simultaneously fit to Equations 5 and 6. The parameters kE,mers and kEM,mers were constrained in these fittings to the values obtained above. The resulting KM,mers values (Table II) indicate that E649D is the only variant in which Mg2+ binding affinity is significantly affected (a 2-fold decrease). 1,1-Diphosphonate Binding—The binding affinities for two non-hydrolyzable substrate analogues (AMDP and MDP) were estimated by measuring their inhibitory activities on PPi hydrolysis (Fig. 6). The value of the inhibition constant, Ki, derived from the data with Equation 7 remained unchanged for both analogues in the D550E variant and increased by a factor of 3–8 in the other Glu → Asp variants (Table II). The Ki values for AMDP measured with the Glu → Ala variants E197A, E550A, and E649A were 0.40 ± 0.06, 0.20 ± 0.03, and 0.44 ± 0.09 μm, respectively. Thus, the effects of the alanine substitutions on AMDP binding were similar except in the case of the E550A variant, which displayed a lower affinity for this substrate analogue than did the corresponding E550D variant. Effects of Asp and Lys Substitutions—Nine aspartates (187, 191, 642, 669, 673, and 677) and three lysines (184, 195, and 646) in the putative cytoplasmic loops were similarly replaced with glutamates and arginines, respectively. These substitutions did not affect the expression of the variant enzymes in E. coli but, except for K195R, inhibited R-PPase activity measured at 2 mm Mg2+ to a level indistinguishable from the background in our system (data not shown). K195R activity was 10% of that of the wild-type enzyme. The drastic decrease in PPase activity following these substitutions signifies that these mutated Asp and Lys residues are indispensable for catalysis but precludes further studies using the kinetic approaches employed for the Glu → Asp variants. In the present study, we examined the roles of conserved Glu197, Glu202, Glu550, and Glu649 in H+-PPase of R. rubrum by site-directed mutagenesis and heterologous expression in E. coli. These residues, with the exception of Glu202, can be replaced with aspartates or alanines and display retention of at least 20% PPase activity measured at high Mg2+ (2 mm) concentrations. In view of the finding that the E202D variant retained significant activity, whereas in the E202A variant activity declined to a level indistinguishable from the background in our system (∼ 5% wild-type R-PPase activity), we propose that the carboxyl at position 202 of R-PPase sequence is indispensable for enzyme function. All variants active in PPi hydrolysis were also capable of PPi-energized proton translocation with a magnitude of coupling similar to that of wild-type R-PPase. This finding is consistent with the tentative assignment of glutamates in hydrophilic regions to cytoplasmic loops, which implies that these residues are unlikely to be involved in proton transport. Interestingly, substitution of Glu263 (corresponding to R-PPase Glu197) in the H+-PPase of the plant V. radiata to aspartate led to complete loss of PPi-energized proton translocation despite the retention of >30% hydrolytic activity (21Nakanishi Y. Saijo T. Wada Y. Maeshima M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7654-7660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). It is unlikely that this residue is related to proton transport in V. radiata H+-PPase but not R-PPase. The E263D substitution possibly caused partial decoupling in the plant enzyme indirectly, perhaps by disrupting the more fragile overall structure. Indeed, a weak current arising from PPi-energized proton transport was recently detected in the E263D variant of V. radiata H+-PPase by patch clamp analysis of giant yeast vacuoles (27Nakanishi Y. Yabe I. Maeshima M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2003; 134: 615-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In contrast, our data on the D187E, D669E, D673E, D677E, and K196R R-PPase variants are consistent with the results for V. radiata H+-PPase reported by Nakanishi et al. (21Nakanishi Y. Saijo T. Wada Y. Maeshima M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7654-7660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Detailed steady-state kinetic analysis performed at a wide range of Mg2+ concentrations indicated that the common effect of all four Glu → Asp substitutions in R-PPase is reduced catalytic efficiency (signified by khapp/Kmapp) as compared with that of wild-type R-PPase at low Mg2+ concentrations (< 0.5 mm). In terms of Scheme I, this observation is explained by hydrolysis of PPi by the variant enzyme via the EM3PP complex only. In contrast, the wild-type enzyme additionally hydrolyzes PPi via the EM2PP complex. Thus, in the absence of conserved Glu, two metal ions are insufficient to form a catalytically competent active site structure that is restored upon binding of the third metal ion. Similar effects of active site substitutions were observed previously in soluble PPases. Whereas catalysis by wild-type E. coli and S. cerevisiae PPases proceeds through both three- and four-metal pathways (28Baykov A.A. Hyytiä T. Volk S.E. Kasho V.N. Vener A.V. Goldman A. Lahti R. Cooperman B.S. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 4655-4661Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 29Belogurov G.A. Fabrichniy I.P. Pohjanjoki P. Kasho V.N. Lehtihuhta E. Turkina M.V. Cooperman B.S. Goldman A. Baykov A.A. Lahti R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 13931-13938Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), active site variants require the whole complement of four metal ions, but are inactive when only three metal ions bind (30Kapyla J. Hyytiä T. Lahti R. Goldman A. Baykov A.A. Cooperman B.S. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 792-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 31Fabrichniy I.P. Kasho V.N. Hyytiä T. Salminen T. Halonen P.

The similarities between the effects of the substitutions in two non-homologous PPase families imply that conserved Glu residues of R-PPase also form part of an active site. This suggestion is consistent with the effects of the substitutions on the binding of the non-hydrolyzable substrate analogues AMDP and MDP. The Ki values reported here for AMDP and MDP are true binding constants, in contrast to the Michaelis constant for substrate, which is generally a complex combination of microscopic rate constants for individual reaction steps. AMDP is a 30-fold more potent inhibitor of H+-PPase in comparison to MDP, which lacks an aminomethyl group in its structure. However, the effects of the substitutions were similar for AMDP and MDP, suggesting that enzyme interactions with the phosphate moieties of the inhibitors were affected. We thus interpret the reduced affinity of the E197D, E202D, and E649D variants for AMDP and MDP as possible evidence of impaired PPi binding in these variants. Interestingly, at positions 197 and 649, AMDP binding was similarly impaired by Glu → Asp and Glu → Ala substitutions, suggesting that in these cases aspartates are poor substitutes for glutamates with respect to inhibitor binding. Alternatively, at position 550, AMDP binding was impaired in the Glu → Ala but not the Glu → Asp variant. This finding may be explained by the considerable flexibility in the vicinity of Glu550, such that the shorter aspartate residue maintains the same interactions as the longer glutamate residue. The catalytic incompetence of the EM2PP complex and its decreased affinity to substrate analogues and, presumably, to substrate in the E197D, E202D, and E649D variants and to Mg2+ in the E649D variant indicate that the active site structure is significantly distorted by the substitutions. However, the sources of this distortion are distinct in the different variants. In E550D and E649D, this may be a long-range conformational change as indicated by the increased mersalyl sensitivity that may result from increased accessibility of Cys573 or other previously inaccessible Cys residues. Thus, Glu550 and Glu649 likely function in maintaining the R-PPase conformation. In contrast, Glu197 and Glu202 may be directly involved in metal cofactor binding. According to Scheme I, the enzyme has a metal-binding site (M1) to form EM and an additional metal-binding site (M2) to bind M2PP if one of the two metal ions that come with PPi bridges PPi and the enzyme in the resulting EM3PP complex as in the case of soluble PPases (32Heikinheimo P.

Salminen A. Kalkkinen N. Baykov A.A. Lahti R. Goldman A. Structure (Lond.). 2001; 9: 289-297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Glu197 may be part of the M1 site as its substitution markedly increases KM1, but not KA1 and KA2 (Table II), whereas Glu202 possibly belongs to both the M1 site and the M2 site because its substitution increases all of these parameters. The contradictory invariance of KM,mers in the E197D and E202D variants (Table II) may result from the fact that this parameter provides a measurement of overall metal binding, whereas the kinetically determined KM1, KA1, and KA2 parameters evaluate only functional binding. The flexibility of the protein structure allows for efficient metal binding in the variant enzymes, but the bulk of the resulting complex is non-productive because the metal is mispositioned. Notably, the lack of effect of similar substitutions (Asp → Glu) of metal ligands on thermodynamically controlled metal binding is well documented in soluble PPases (34Pohjanjoki P. Fabrichniy I.P.

Goldman A. Lahti R. Cooperman B.S. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 4645-4653Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). In summary, all of the conserved glutamates in R-PPase are essential for catalytic efficiency at low Mg2+ concentrations, which accounts for their conservation in H+-PPases. In addition, Glu197 and Glu202 may contribute to substrate binding by controlling metal binding but do not affect the overall enzyme structure. On the other hand, Glu550 and Glu649 may be important for maintaining the catalytically competent conformation of R-PPase. We thank Dr. J. E. Walker for providing the E. coli C43(DE3) strain, Dr. M. Baltscheffsky and A. Schultz for providing the R-PPase gene, and antibodies against the protein."
