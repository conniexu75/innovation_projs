https://openalex.org/W2040825545,"Posttranslational modification with SUMO1 regulates protein/protein interactions, localization, and stability. SUMOylation requires the E1 enzyme Aos1/Uba2 and the E2 enzyme Ubc9. A family of E3-like factors, PIAS proteins, was discovered recently. Here we show that the nucleoporin RanBP2/Nup358 also has SUMO1 E3-like activity. RanBP2 directly interacts with the E2 enzyme Ubc9 and strongly enhances SUMO1-transfer from Ubc9 to the SUMO1 target Sp100. The E3-like activity is contained within a 33 kDa domain of RanBP2 that lacks RING finger motifs and does not resemble PIAS family proteins. Our findings place SUMOylation at the cytoplasmic filaments of the NPC and suggest that, at least for some substrates, modification and nuclear import are linked events."

https://openalex.org/W2032125422,"Munc13-1 is a presynaptic protein with an essential role in synaptic vesicle priming. It contains a diacylglycerol (DAG)/beta phorbol ester binding C(1) domain and is a potential target of the DAG second messenger pathway that may act in parallel with PKCs. Using genetically modified mice that express a DAG/beta phorbol ester binding-deficient Munc13-1(H567K) variant instead of the wild-type protein, we determined the relative contribution of PKCs and Munc13-1 to DAG/beta phorbol ester-dependent regulation of neurotransmitter release. We show that Munc13s are the main presynaptic DAG/beta phorbol ester receptors in hippocampal neurons. Modulation of Munc13-1 activity by second messengers via the DAG/beta phorbol ester binding C(1) domain is essential for use-dependent alterations of synaptic efficacy and survival."
https://openalex.org/W2042487912,"The mechanism of nuclear envelope breakdown (NEBD) was investigated in live cells. Early spindle microtubules caused folds and invaginations in the NE up to one hour prior to NEBD, creating mechanical tension in the nuclear lamina. The first gap in the NE appeared before lamin B depolymerization, at the site of maximal tension, by a tearing mechanism. Gap formation relaxed this tension and dramatically accelerated the rate of chromosome condensation. The hole produced in the NE then rapidly expanded over the nuclear surface. NE fragments remaining on chromosomes were removed toward the centrosomes in a microtubule-dependent manner, suggesting a mechanism mediated by a minus-end-directed motor."
https://openalex.org/W2164407945,"The activated hepatic stellate cell (HSC) is central to liver fibrosis as the major source of collagens I and III and the tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1). During spontaneous recovery from liver fibrosis, there is a decrease of TIMP expression, an increase in collagenase activity, and increased apoptosis of HSC, highlighting a potential role for TIMP-1 in HSC survival. In this report, we use tissue culture and in vivomodels to demonstrate that TIMP-1 directly inhibits HSC apoptosis. TIMP-1 demonstrated a consistent, significant, and dose-dependent antiapoptotic effect for HSC activated in tissue culture and stimulated to undergo apoptosis by serum deprivation, cycloheximide exposure, and nerve growth factor stimulation. A nonfunctional mutated TIMP-1 (T2G mutant) in which all other domains are conserved did not inhibit apoptosis, indicating that inhibition of apoptosis was mediated through MMP inhibition. Synthetic MMP inhibitors also inhibited HSC apoptosis. Studies of experimental liver cirrhosis demonstrated that persistent expression of TIMP-1 mRNA determined by PCR correlated with persistence of activated HSC quantified by α smooth muscle actin staining, while in fibrosis, loss of activated HSC correlated with a reduction in TIMP-1 mRNA. We conclude that TIMP-1 inhibits apoptosis of activated HSC via MMP inhibition."

https://openalex.org/W2158799849,"During prophase in higher cells, centrosomes localize to deep invaginations in the nuclear envelope in a microtubule-dependent process. Loss of nuclear membranes in prometaphase commences in regions of the nuclear envelope that lie outside of these invaginations. Dynein and dynactin complex components concentrate on the nuclear envelope prior to any changes in nuclear envelope organization. These observations suggest a model in which dynein facilitates nuclear envelope breakdown by pulling nuclear membranes and associated proteins poleward along astral microtubules leading to nuclear membrane detachment. Support for this model is provided by the finding that interference with dynein function drastically alters nuclear membrane dynamics in prophase and prometaphase."
https://openalex.org/W2022810442,"The androgen-signaling pathway is important for the growth and progression of prostate cancer cells. The growth-promoting effects of androgen on prostate cells are mediated mostly through the androgen receptor (AR). There is increasing evidence that transcription activation by AR is mediated through interaction with other cofactors. β-Catenin plays a critical role in embryonic development and tumorigenesis through its effects on E-cadherin-mediated cell adhesion and Wnt-dependent signal transduction. Here, we demonstrate that a specific protein-protein interaction occurs between β-catenin and AR. Unlike the steroid hormone receptor coactivator 1 (SRC1), β-catenin showed a strong interaction with AR but not with other steroid hormone receptors such as estrogen receptor α, progesterone receptor β, and glucocorticoid receptor. The ligand binding domain of AR and the NH2terminus combined with the first six armadillo repeats of β-catenin were shown to be necessary for the interaction. Through this specific interaction, β-catenin augments the ligand-dependent activity of AR in prostate cancer cells. Moreover, expression of E-cadherin in E-cadherin-negative prostate cancer cells results in redistribution of the cytoplasmic β-catenin to the cell membrane and reduction of AR-mediated transcription. These data suggest that loss of E-cadherin can elevate the cellular levels of β-catenin in prostate cancer cells, which may directly contribute to invasiveness and a more malignant tumor phenotype by augmenting AR activity during prostate cancer progression.

Prostate cancer is the most commonly diagnosed malignancy among males in western countries (1.Landis S.H. Murray T. Bolden S. Wingo P.A. CA-Cancer J. Clin. 1999; 49: 8-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (3135) Google Scholar). However, in contrast to some other tumors, the molecular events involved in the development and progression of prostate cancer remain largely unknown. Androgen ablation, used as an effective treatment for the majority of advanced prostate cancers, indicates that androgen plays an essential role in regulating the growth of prostate cancer cells. The growth-promoting effects of androgen in prostate cells are mediated mostly through the androgen receptor (AR). 1The abbreviations used are: ARandrogen receptorGRglucocorticoid receptorERαestrogen receptor αPRβprogesterone receptor βVDRvitamin D receptorTADtranscription activation domainDBDDNA binding domainLBDligand binding domainDHTdihydrotestosteronePSAprostate specific antigenAREandrogen responsive elementMMTVmouse mammary tumor virusGSTglutathione S-transferaseARA70androgen receptor-associated protein 70β-galβ-galactosidaseAPCadenomatous polyposis coli there is increasing evidence that the nuclear hormone receptors, including AR, interact with other signal transduction pathways (2.Jenster G.

Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1837-1851Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4.Morin P.J. Bioessays. 1999; 21: 1021-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (817) Google Scholar). Corresponding to its dual functions in the cells, β-catenin is localized to two cellular pools. Most of the β-catenin is located in the cell membrane where it is associated with the cytoplasmic region of E-cadherin, a transmembrane protein involved in homotypic cell-cell contacts (5.Ozawa M. Baribault H. Kemler R. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 1711-1717Crossref PubMed Scopus (1152) Google Scholar). A smaller pool of β-catenin is located in the nucleus and cytoplasm and mediates Wnt signaling. In the absence of a Wnt signal, β-catenin is constitutively down-regulated by a multicomponent destruction complex containing GSK3β, axin, and a tumor suppressor, adenomatous polyposis coli (APC). These proteins promote the phosphorylation of serine and threonine residues in the NH2-terminal region of β-catenin and thereby target it for degradation by the ubiquitin proteasome pathway (6.Aberle H. Bauer A. Stappert J. Kispert A. Kemler R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3797-3804Crossref PubMed Scopus (2172) Google Scholar). Wnt signaling inhibits this process, which leads to an accumulation of β-catenin in the nucleus and promotes the formation of transcriptionally active complexes with members of the Tcf/LEF family (7.Molenaar M. van de Wetering M. Oosterwegel M. Peterson-Maduro J. Godsave S. Korinek V. Roose J. Destree O. Clevers H. Cell. 1996; 86: 391-399Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1625) Google Scholar). Activation of Tcf/LEF and β-catenin targets has been shown to induce neoplastic transformation in cells, suggesting a potential role of β-catenin in tumorigenesis (8.Aoki M. Hecht A. Kruse U. Kemler R. Vogt P.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 139-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). The link between stabilized β-catenin and tumor development and progression was considerably strengthened by discoveries of mutations in both β-catenin and components of the destruction complex in a wide variety of human cancers, which cause increased cellular levels of β-catenin (3.Polakis P. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1837-1851Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9.Korinek V. Barker N. Morin P.J. van Wichen D. de Weger R. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Clevers H. Science. 1997; 275: 1784-1787Crossref PubMed Scopus (2950) Google Scholar). About 85% of all sporadic and hereditary colorectal tumors show loss of APC function, which correlates with the increased levels of free β-catenin found in these cancer cells (10.Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Cell. 1996; 87: 159-170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4286) Google Scholar, 11.Munemitsu S. Albert I. Souza B. Rubinfeld B. Polakis P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

It appears that inappropriate high cellular levels of β-catenin play a fundamentally important role in tumorigenesis. In normal epithelial tissues, E-cadherin complexes with actin cytoskeleton via cytoplasmic catenins to maintain the functional characteristics of epithelia. Disruption of this complex, due primarily to the loss or decreased expression of E-cadherin, is frequently observed in many advanced, poorly differentiated carcinomas (13.Gayther S.A. Gorringe K.L. Ramus S.J. Huntsman D. Roviello F. Grehan N. Machado J.C. Pinto E. Seruca R. Halling K. MacLeod P. Powell S.M. Jackson C.E. Ponder B.A. Caldas C.

Nature. 1998; 392: 402-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (1384) Google Scholar). There is a strong correlation between decreased expression of E-cadherin and an invasive and metastatic phenotype of human prostate cancers (15.Richmond P.J. Karayiannakis A.J. Nagafuchi A. Kaisary A.V. Pignatelli M. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 3189-3193PubMed Google Scholar). Besides playing a role in retaining normal cell-cell contact, E-cadherin can also modulate the cytoplasmic pools of β-catenin for signaling (16.Sasaki C.Y. Lin H. Morin P.J. Longo D.L. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 7057-7065PubMed Google Scholar). Here, we demonstrated a specific protein-protein interaction between β-catenin and AR. Importantly, unlike the steroid receptor cofactor 1 (SRC1), β-catenin selectively binds to AR in a ligand-dependent manner but not to other steroid hormone receptors such as the estrogen receptor α (ERα), the progesterone receptor β (PRβ), and glucocorticoid receptor (GR). The ligand binding domain (LBD) of AR and the central region spanning the armadillo repeats 1–6 of β-catenin were found to be responsible for the interaction. Using transient transfection experiments, we further demonstrated that β-catenin augments the ligand-dependent activity of AR in prostate cancer cells through this specific interaction. These data identify a new role for β-catenin in nuclear hormone receptor-mediated transcription. Moreover, transfection of an E-cadherin expression construct into an E-cadherin-negative prostate cancer cell line, TSU.pr-1, resulted in redistribution of β-catenin to the cell membrane and reduction of AR-dependent transcriptional activity. They suggest that reduced expression of E-cadherin can elevate the cellular levels of β-catenin in prostate cancer cells, which may directly contribute to the invasiveness and more malignant tumor phenotype by augmenting AR activity during the progression of prostate cancer. Yeast two-hybrid experiments were basically performed as described previously (17.Yang F. Li X. Sharma M. Zarnegar M. Lim B. Sun Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15345-15353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The LBD of human AR (amino acids 629–919) was fused in frame to the GAL4 DBD in the pGBT9 vector (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). The construct was transformed into a modified yeast strain PJ69-4A (18.James P. Halladay J. Craig E.A. Genetics. 1996; 144: 1425-1436Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A cDNA library from human brain tissue was used in this screening (CLONTECH). Transformants were selected on Sabouraud dextrose medium lacking adenine, leucine, and tryptophan in the presence of 100 nm dihydrotestosterone (DHT). The specificity of interaction with AR was determined by a liquid β-galactosidase (β-gal) assay as described previously (17.Yang F. Li X. Sharma M. Zarnegar M. Lim B. Sun Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15345-15353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). β-Gal activities were measured using the Galacto-light Plus kit (Tropix Inc., Bedford, MA) and normalized by cell density (A600). pGBT9 constructs with three different AR fragments, including the partial TAD (amino acids 1–333), DBD (amino acids 505–676), and LBD were used to confirm the interaction. A yeast clone containing the full-length cDNA of human β-catenin was isolated in the screen. Using it as a template, the COOH-terminal and internal deletions of β-catenin clones were generated by PCR with specific primers containing the appropriate restriction enzyme sites. After cleavage, the fragments containing different portions of the β-catenin were cloned downstream of GAL4 TAD in the pGAD10 vector (CLONTECH). The LBD fragments of ERα (amino acids 250–602), PRβ (amino acids 633–952), VDR (amino acids 90–427) were generated by PCR with specific primers and subcloned in-frame to the GAL4 DBD in pGBT9. An antisense construct of β-catenin containing the NH2-terminal 513 bp was generated by PCR and cloned into the pcDNA3 vector at EcoRI site. All constructs were sequenced to confirm that there were no mutations introduced by PCR. The AR expression vector, pSV-hAR, was provided by Dr. Albert Brinkmann (Erasmus University, Rotterdam, The Netherlands). The expression constructs for human ERα and pERE-luc plasmid were generously given by Dr. Myles Brown (Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA). A human PRβ and PRE-luc reporter were provided by Dr. Kathryn B. Horwitz (University of Colorado). The expression constructs of human GR and VDR, and the pVDRE-luc reporter plasmid, were the kind gifts of Dr. David Feldman (Stanford University, Stanford, CA). pSV-β-gal, an SV40-driven β-galactosidase reporter plasmid (Promega, Madison, WI) was used in this study as an internal control. The pSG5-ARA70 plasmid and the reporter plasmid pARE-luc were the kind gifts of Dr. Chawnshang Chang (19.Yeh S. Chang C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5517-5521Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). pMMTV-pA3-luc was provided by Dr. Richard Pestell (Albert Einstein College of Medicine, New York). The reporter plasmids, pPSA7kb-luc, with the luciferase gene under the control of promoter fragments of the human prostate-specific antigen was obtained from Dr. Jan Trapman (20.Cleutjens K.B. van Eekelen C.C. van der Korput H.A. Brinkman A.O. Trapman J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6379-6388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). The monkey kidney cell line, CV-1, was maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum (HyClone, Denver, CO). An AR-positive prostate cancer cell line, LNCaP, was maintained in T-medium (Invitrogen) with 5% fetal calf serum. The two sublines derived from TSU.pr-1 prostate cancer cells (16.Sasaki C.Y. Lin H. Morin P.J. Longo D.L. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 7057-7065PubMed Google Scholar) were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium with 10% fetal calf serum and G418 (500 μg/ml). Transient transfections were carried out using a LipofectAMINE transfection kit (Invitrogen) for CV1 and LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) for TSU.pr-1 and LNCaP cells. Approximately 1.5–2 × 104 cells were plated in a 48-well plate 16 h before transfection. 12–16 h after transfection, the cells were washed and fed medium containing 5% charcoal-stripped fetal calf serum (HyClone) in the presence or absence of steroid hormones. Cells were incubated for another 24 h, and luciferase activity was measured as relative light units (21.Sharma M. Zarnegar M. Li X. Lim B. Sun Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35200-35208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The relative light units from individual transfections were normalized by β-galactosidase activity in the same samples. Individual transfection experiments were done in triplicate and the results are reported as mean relative light units/β-galactosidase (+S.D.). GST-β-catenin fusion proteins were constructed in the pGEX-4T-1 vector (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). Expression and purification of GST fusion proteins were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. Full-length human AR proteins were generated and 35S-labeled in vitro by the TNT-coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega, Madison, WI). Equal amounts of GST fusion proteins coupled to glutathione-Sepharose beads were incubated with 35S-labeled proteins at 4 °C for 2 h in the lysis buffer as described above. Beads were carefully washed three times with washing buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40). GST fusion proteins were then eluted by incubating with buffer containing 10 mm glutathione and 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, for 10 min at room temperature. The bound proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography. CV-1 cells were plated onto gelatin-coated (2%) coverslips the day before transfection. The pcDNA3-AR and the wild type or mutants of β-catenin plasmids were cotransfected into cells with the LipofectAMINE-PLUS reagent (Invitrogen). After 2 h, transfected cells were fed with fresh medium plus/minus 10 nm DHT, incubated for 4 h, and then fixed for 10 min with 3% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline and washed with 0.1% Nonidet P-40/phosphate-buffered saline buffer. Nonspecific sites were blocked with 5% skim milk powder in phosphate-buffered saline for 30 min. The cells were then incubated with either anti-FLAG monoclonal or anti-AR polyclonal antibody for 1 h at room temperature. Cells were washed three times followed by incubation with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse or rhodamine-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Indirect immunofluorescence staining was performed according to the procedure described previously (16.Sasaki C.Y. Lin H. Morin P.J. Longo D.L. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 7057-7065PubMed Google Scholar). In TSU cells, E-cadherin was stained with the rat monoclonal antibody against uvomorulin (6 μg/ml; Sigma) and donkey anti-rat immunoglobulin conjugated to Alexa-488 (20 μg/ml; Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). β-Catenin was stained with a mouse monoclonal anti-β-catenin antibody conjugated to TRITC (10 μg/ml; Transduction Laboratories). Using a bait construct containing the LBD and hinge region of the AR, we employed a modified yeast two-hybrid system to identify proteins that interact with AR in an androgen-dependent manner (17.Yang F. Li X. Sharma M. Zarnegar M. Lim B. Sun Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15345-15353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 18.James P. Halladay J. Craig E.A. Genetics. 1996; 144: 1425-1436Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Of 2 × 107 transformants, 73 grew under selective conditions and showed increased adenine and β-gal productions in medium containin g 100 nm DHT. Rescue of the plasmids and sequencing of the inserts revealed several different cDNAs, including the previously identified SRC1 (22.Onate S.A. Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.J. O'Malley B.W. Science. 1995; 270: 1354-1357Crossref PubMed Scopus (2063) Google Scholar), an AR-associated protein (ARA70) (19.Yeh S. Chang C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5517-5521Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar), and several other AR-interacting proteins identified recently by others or us (17.Yang F. Li X. Sharma M. Zarnegar M. Lim B. Sun Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15345-15353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 21.Sharma M. Zarnegar M. Li X. Lim B. Sun Z. J. Biol.

Importantly, 23 of these clones perfectly matched the sequence of the full-length coding region of β-catenin. To confirm the interaction, we cotransformed one of these β-catenin clones with various constructs containing either GAL4DBD alone or the AR fusion proteins with a partial transactivation domain (pTAD), the DBD, and the LBD (Fig. 1A). pGAD10-β-catenin showed a specific interaction with GAL4DBD-AR-LBD by producing adenine in the presence of 100 nm DHT (data not shown). In the liquid β-gal assays, pGAD10-β-catenin showed an ∼97-fold induction with pGBT9-AR-LBD in the presence of DHT (Fig. 1B). This result demonstrated that the LBD of AR specifically interacts with β-catenin in a ligand-dependent manner. β-Catenin and its Drosophila homolog, armadillo, contain a central core domain of 12 armadillo repeats flanked by unique NH2 and COOH termini (7.Molenaar M. van de Wetering M. Oosterwegel M. Peterson-Maduro J. Godsave S. Korinek V. Roose J. Destree O. Clevers H. Cell. 1996; 86: 391-399Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1625) Google Scholar). To identify the region of β-catenin that interacts with AR, we generated several truncated mutants of β-catenin and assessed their ability to interact with AR using the yeast two-hybrid system (Fig. 2A). As shown in Fig. 2B, deletion of the COOH-terminal activation domain of β-catenin (β-cat-t671) alone, or in combination with the last five armadillo repeats (β-cat-t423), did not significantly affect the binding. However, a mutant in which the NH2-terminal activation domain alone (β-cat-t134–671), or in combination with the central armadillo domain (β-cat-t671–781) was deleted, showed no interaction. This result suggests that the primary binding region for AR spans the NH2 terminus and the first seven armadillo repeats of β-catenin. To precisely map the interacting region, a series of truncated mutants were made in which each single armadillo repeat was subsequently deleted (Fig. 3A). The deletion constructs containing the NH2-terminal region and the first six repeats (β-cat-t393) showed about two-thirds the activity of the full-length protein (β-cat-F) (Fig. 3A). However by deleting repeat 6 (β-cat-t350), the interaction was essentially abolished, indicating that armadillo repeat 6 is crucial for binding to AR. Deletion of repeats 1–5 obviously had little further effect. It has been shown that most β-catenin-binding proteins such as Tcf/LEF family members (24.van de Wetering M. Cavallo R.

In most of cases, the first 10 repeats are required for the interactions, and a minimum of 6–7 repeats are sufficient for detectable binding (29.Huber A.H. Nelson W.J. Weis W.I. Cell. 1997; 90: 871-882Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar, 30.Graham T.A. Weaver C. Mao F. Kimelman D. Xu W. Cell. 2000; 103: 885-896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). Those data are consistent with our finding that deletion of repeat 6 fully abolished the interaction with AR. To more precisely map the interaction region within the first six armadillo repeats, we used a PCR-based, site-directed mutagenesis techniques to generate several internal deletion mutants. As shown in the figure, the wild type β-catenin and the mutant with deletion of repeat 7 (ΔR7) or 12 (ΔR12) all reacted avidly with the AR-LBD. In contrast, mutants lacking repeat 6 (ΔR6) showed no interaction with the AR-LBD (Fig. 3B). Moreover, deletion of repeat 5 alone also fully abolished the interaction, indicating that the armadillo repeats 1–5 may be also involved in the interaction. To confirm this result, an additional internal deletion mutant lacking repeat 3 (ΔR3) was generated and tested. As we expected, the mutant also showed no interaction with AR (data not shown). Taken together, the results allow us to conclude that the region spanning armadillo repeats 1–6 is mainly responsible for binding to AR. Physical interaction between AR and β-catenin was further assessed by GST pull-down experiments. A series of GST fusion proteins with the full-length β-catenin and internal deletion mutants were generated and immobilized onto a glutathione-Sepharose matrix. The binding of [35S]methionine-labeled AR protein to GST-β-catenin fusion proteins was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and detected by autoradiography. As shown in Fig. 4A, AR protein bound to the GST fusion protein containing wild type β-catenin and its mutants lacking either repeat 7 or 12. The interaction is more pronounced in the presence of DHT than in the absence of DHT, and as much as 5% of the input protein was recovered (Fig. 4A). However, a significant reduction of binding was observed between the AR protein and the β-catenin mutants lacking repeat 6 when equal amounts of the GST fusion proteins were used in the experiments (Fig. 4B). These results are consistent with our observations from the yeast two-hybrid system and show a domain-dependent interaction in vitro. To confirm that endogenous AR and β-catenin are physically associated in intact cells, coimmunoprecipitation assays were carried out to detect a possible protein complex in a prostate cancer cell line, LNCaP. Using specific antibodies, we further confirmed that AR and β-catenin proteins form a protein complex in LNCaP cells and the formation of AR and β-catenin complexes in these cells was also enhanced by DHT (data not shown). These results are consistent with a recent report by Truica and colleagues (31.Truica C.I. Byers S. Gelmann E.P. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 4709-4713PubMed Google Scholar). Next, we examined whether a dynamic interaction between β-catenin and AR existed in cells. FLAG-tagged vectors containing either full-length or mutants of β-catenin were transfected into CV-1 cells, and the expressed protein showed a cytoplasmic and nuclear distribution, which was not altered by treatment with DHT (data not shown). Overexpressed β-catenin protein with AR vector, in the absence of DHT, showed the same cellular distribution as transfection of β-catenin plasmid alone, while transfected AR protein is localized mainly in the cytoplasm (Fig. 4C, panels 1, 3, and 5). In the presence of DHT, AR proteins are fully translocated into the nuclei (panels 2, 4, and 6). Importantly, both the wild type (panel 2) and the ΔR12 mutant of β-catenin (panel 6) showed increased levels of nuclear translocation when cotransfected with AR compared with cells transfected with the ΔR6 mutant of β-catenin in which cytoplasmic staining of β-catenin persisted (panel 4). These results provide the first evidence that β-catenin can translocate into the nucleus as part of a complex with AR by an interaction through armadillo repeat 6. To assess the possibility that β-catenin functions as a general coactivator of nuclear receptors, we examined the interaction of β-catenin with other members of the nuclear receptor family in yeast. The LBD of ERα, PRβ, and VDR were generated and fused to GAL-DBD in the pGBT9 vector. These plasmids were cotransformed with either pGAD10-β-catenin or pGAD10-SRC1 as a positive control in the presence of corresponding ligands. The yeast transformants were grown on the selective media, and a liquid β-gal assay was performed to quantify the interactions. All receptors were shown to have a ligand-dependent interaction with the SRC1 (Fig. 5A), which is consistent with the previous reports (22.Onate S.A. Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.J. O'Malley B.W. Science. 1995; 270: 1354-1357Crossref PubMed Scopus (2063) Google Scholar, 32.Shibata H. Spencer T.E. Onate S.A. Jenster G. Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.J. O'Malley B.W. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 1997; 52: 141-165PubMed Google Scholar). However, β-catenin showed a strong interaction with AR but not with ERα and PRβ. VDR showed a weaker interaction with β-catenin in comparison to SRC1. These results indicate that β-catenin selectively interacts with AR. The specificity of interaction between β-catenin and AR proteins was further tested in CV1 cells. Since AR, GR, and PRβ all can activate the MMTV promoter, we examined whether β-catenin is able to enhance GR and PRβ activity under identical experimental condition. Transfection experiments were repeated with β-catenin and AR, GR, and PRβ expression plasmids, along with a luciferase reporter plasmid regulated by an MMTV promoter containing the steroid hormone-responsive elements (33.Hoeck W. Hofer P. Groner B. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1992; 41: 283-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 34.Mink S. Ponta H. Cato A.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 2017-2024Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 5B, all receptors showed a ligand-dependent transactivation with the MMTV promoter. However, β-catenin specifically augmented only AR-mediated transcription but not GR and PRβ (Fig. 5B). Taken together, our results suggest that β-catenin differs from SRC1 and selectively affects AR. Transient transfection assays were performed to further investigate the possible effect of β-catenin on AR-ediated transcription. Plasmids capable of expressing AR, wild type or mutants of β-catenin, and a luciferase reporter plasmid regulated by the MMTV-LTR (MMTVpA3-Luc), were transfected into CV-1 cells (35.Rovera G. Mehta S. Maul G. Exp. Cell Res. 1974; 89: 295-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). A nearly 3-fold ligand-dependent transactivation was observed in the cells transfected with AR plasmid"

More recently, it has been proposed that S-nitrosylation of cysteine thiols may constitute a major route of NO trafficking through which NO-related bioactivity is effected, serving as a ubiquitous post-translational modification that regulates dynamically a broad functional spectrum of proteins (2Stamler J.S.

Here we show thatS-nitrosylated proteins can be identified, on membrane blots and with immunohistochemistry, by antibodies that recognize the SNO moiety. We exploit this capacity to demonstrate ongoing and physiologically regulated protein S-nitrosylation that is coupled to the activity of each of the major forms of NOS in NO-generating cells and (in the case of endothelial NOS) their functional cellular partners (vascular smooth muscle). These results support the proposition that S-nitrosylation serves as an important mediator of NO-related bioactivity, both in NOS-containing cells and during NO-derived intercellular signaling.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONUnreduced fatty acid-free BSA nitrosated with HCl/NO 2− at a 1:1 molar ratio with regard to nitrite incorporates about one mercury-labile NO group per BSA. As illustrated in Fig. 1(A and B), as little as 0.8 nmol ofS-nitrosylated BSA (SNO-BSA) could be detected on dot blots, whereas unmodified BSA was not recognized. Reactivity was greatly reduced by treating BSA with the sulfhydryl-specific organic mercurial pCMB prior to nitrosation (to block cysteine thiols) or with either mercuric chloride or dithiothreitol (1 mm; not shown) following nitrosation (to cleave the SNO linkage) (Fig. 1 A). Similar results were obtained using nitrosated glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase as substrate (not shown). In addition, antigen competition experiments demonstrated that incubation of antiserum withS-nitrosylated glutathione eliminated subsequent antibody binding to SNO-BSA, whereas incubation with an N-nitroso compound, PAPA-NONOate, had no effect (Fig. 1 B). Finally, we employed the SNO antiserum to detect SNO-BSA on Western blots following IEF in polyacrylamide gels (Fig. 1 C). Whereas dithiothreitol-reduced but otherwise unmodified BSA was not detected, nitrosation with 1.5 mol of acidified nitrite/mol of BSA led to the appearance of two prominent immunoreactive bands, and treatment with a 3-fold molar excess of NO 2−resulted in increased abundance of those isoforms and the appearance of a third, more acidic species. These results reveal the nitrosation-dependent loss of charge groups of basic pK a, and in combination with the dot-blot analysis indicate that SNO-BSA separates in IEF as immunoreactive isoforms due to loss of the influence of thiolate anions on isoelectric point following addition of NO groups to cysteine sulfhydryl groups. In addition, we have recently employed anti-SNO antibodies with Western blotting following non-reducing electrophoresis to demonstrateS-nitrosylation of the ryanodine receptor protein from mammalian skeletal muscle (11Sun J. Xin C. Eu J.P. Stamler J.S. Meissner G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 11158-11162Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar), although the general utility of anti-SNO antiserum in detecting varied SNO-proteins on Western blots remains to be determined.Overall, our analysis indicates that SNO-directed antibodies will provide a uniquely useful marker for S-nitrosylated proteins, if specificity is verified by the criterion of mercury and thiol sensitivity as well as, optimally, NOS dependence as described below. To apply this immunological tool to the analysis ofS-nitrosylation in situ, we employed immunohistochemistry to examine SNO-proteins in cultured cells and tissue sections. Specificity of SNO-protein detection was demonstrated by mercury reversibility and NOS dependence of staining and by parallel measurements of protein-SNO by photolysis/chemiluminescence. In addition, control samples of all cells and tissues were processed with non-immune serum.Endothelial and smooth muscle cells in tangential sections of pig aorta, and bovine pulmonary artery endothelial cells in primary culture, exhibited a low basal level of immunoreactivity, which was increased substantially by nitrosation with HCl/NO 2− prior to fixation (Fig.2, A and B). Both basal and induced staining was largely eliminated by treatment with either mercuric chloride or pCMB before incubation with antiserum (Fig.2, A and B). Mercury treatment had no effect on nitrotyrosine immunohistochemistry in parallel sections (not shown). These findings extend the results with membrane-bound proteins to demonstrate that SNO-proteins can be visualized specifically by immunohistochemistry. We then examined endogenous proteinS-nitrosylation in intact cells in which individual NOS species could be activated selectively, focusing first on vascular tissue.Type 3 NOS (eNOS) is the predominant form in vascular endothelial cells, where it is activated by stimuli that increase intracellular Ca2+ (12Bredt D.S. Snyder S.H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 175-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (2127) Google Scholar, 13Ignarro L. Biosci. Rep. 1999; 19: 51-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). In both primary bovine pulmonary artery endothelial cells and rat CPA-47 endothelial cells, incubation with the Ca2+ ionophore A23187 (1 μm, 10 min) resulted in a large increase in immunoreactivity, which was greatly reduced by treatment with mercury prior to staining and by treatment prior toA23187 exposure with the NOS inhibitorN G-monomethyl-l-arginine (l-NMMA, 1 mm) (Fig. 2 B). In addition, we examined the SNO-protein content of resting andA23187-treated CPA-47 cells by photolysis/chemiluminescence of cellular extracts. Lysates of resting cells contained a low level of SNO (15 ± 1.1 nmol/g of protein), consistent with the presence of basal mercury-labile endothelial immunoreactivity, and treatment withA23187 resulted in a significant increase in SNO content (43 ± 6.8 nmol/g of protein; p < 0.05). Thus, chemical measurement confirms the immunohistochemical demonstration that, in cultured arterial endothelial cells, stimulation of eNOS by ionophore-mediated Ca2+ influx is coupled to increased protein S-nitrosylation.We next examined protein S-nitrosylation in intact vascular tissue in which eNOS could be activated physiologically. Type 3 NOS has been identified as the source of EDRF, and eNOS activity is modulated accordingly by vasoactive neurohormonal signals (1Davis K.L. Martin E. Turko I.V. Murad F. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2001; 41: 203-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar, 13Ignarro L. Biosci. Rep. 1999; 19: 51-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). EDRF mediates vasodilation at least in part through activation in vascular smooth muscle of charybdotoxin-sensitive potassium channels and of Ca2+-ATPase, possibly via S-nitrosylation (14Bolotina V.M. Najibi S. Palacino J.J. Cohen R.A. Nature. 1994; 368: 850-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (1505) Google Scholar,15Cohen R.A. Weisbrod R.M. Gericke M. Yagoubi M. Bierl C. Bolotina V.M. Circ. Res. 1999; 84: 210-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Rings of mouse aorta, suspended in bioassay chambers and precontracted with phenylephrine, relaxed upon application of acetylcholine (ACh) (Fig. 2 C). Immunoreactivity of both endothelium and smooth muscle was increased substantially in sections of rings that were removed from the bioassay shortly after exposure to ACh (Fig. 2 C). Incubation (40 min) with the eNOS inhibitorN G-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester (l-NAME, 1 mm) blocked ACh-induced relaxation and decreased immunoreactivity below basal levels in both endothelium and smooth muscle, demonstrating turnover of protein SNO (Fig. 2 C). Thus, S-nitrosylation is a dynamic protein modification coupled to physiological activity of endothelial type 3 NOS, in both endothelium and associated smooth muscle of intact vascular tissue.To examine S-nitrosylation linked to the additional forms of NOS, we employed cultured cell types in which type 1 NOS (nNOS) or type 2 NOS (iNOS) could be induced selectively by varying culture conditions.Type 1 NOS is the predominant form in neurons (12Bredt D.S. Snyder S.H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 175-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (2127) Google Scholar), and adrenocarcinoma-derived PC-12 cells acquire a neuronal phenotype under the influence of nerve growth factor (NGF). We exposed PC-12 cells overnight to low levels of NGF (100 ng/ml), which increased nNOS expression without gross morphological differentiation. Untreated PC-12 cells contained moderate levels of nNOS and of SNO-protein, and induction of nNOS led to a large increase in proteinS-nitrosylation as revealed by immunohistochemistry (Fig.3 A).Figure 3Coupling of nNOS and iNOS expression to protein S-nitrosylation. As illustrated respectively in A (diaminobenzidine reaction product) andB (immunofluorescence), induction of nNOS by NGF treatment of cultured PC-12 cells (inset shows a Western blot of nNOS) and induction of iNOS by cytokine treatment of cultured RAW 254.7 (macrophage) cells, results in large increases in SNO-protein immunoreactivity.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Type 2 NOS is the form detected in macrophages, and iNOS expression is greatly enhanced by exposure to cytokines (12Bredt D.S. Snyder S.H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 175-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (2127) Google Scholar). Treatment of macrophage-derived RAW 254.7 cells overnight with bacterial lipopolysaccharide (200 ng/ml) and γ-interferon (200 units/ml) led to a substantial increase in SNO-protein immunoreactivity, which accompanied the morphological differentiation characteristic of cytokine induction of macrophage/neutrophil cells (Fig. 3 B). Increased immunoreactivity was correlated with anl-NMMA-inhibitable increase in SNO-protein levels from about 10 to 150 nmol of SNO/g of protein (p < 0.05), as assessed by photolysis/chemiluminescence of cellular extracts passed through Sephadex G-25 to eliminate low molecular weight nitrosothiols. However, it should be noted that staining of RAW 254.7 cells exhibited greater culture to culture variability than other cell types examined.Finally, we extended our analysis to a more complex tissue, the human lung. The mature lung displays substantial levels of each of the three major forms of NOS, which are distributed discretely across a range of cell types that includes most prominently vascular endothelium (eNOS) and airway epithelium (iNOS), but NOS expression is greatly limited before birth (16Kobzik L. Bredt D.S. Lowenstein C.J. Drazen J. Gaston B. Sugarbaker D. Stamler J.S. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1993; 9: 371-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar). In sections from the lung of a pre-term infant, SNO-protein immunoreactivity was sparse and limited largely to the tracheal epithelium (Fig. 4). In contrast, sections from the lung of a full-term neonate (Fig. 4) exhibited extensive staining, which was most prominent in small artery endothelium, cartilage chondrocytes, and tracheal epithelium and muscle, whereas large artery endothelium was unstained. In addition, in sections from the lung of a pre-term infant administered NO therapeutically by inhalation (≤20 ppm), SNO-protein immunoreactivity was increased in a distribution that overlapped that seen in the neonate except that small artery endothelium remained unstained (Fig.4). Increased S-nitrosylation was also evident throughout sections from the lung of a term infant with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (Fig. 4), consistent with the increased expression of iNOS by resident and infiltrating cells that accompanies lung pathophysiology. Basal, NO-induced, and bronchopulmonary dysplasia-associated immunoreactivity was eliminated by treatment with pCMB prior to staining (not shown). Thus, protein S-nitrosylation is developmentally regulated in multiple tissue compartments of the human lung and altered by both disease and NO therapy.Figure 4SNO-protein immunoreactivity in human lung. Distribution of reaction product (brown) is depicted in sections of lung from preterm infants untreated (Basal) or following NO inhalation (NO) and from term neonates free of pulmonary disease (Basal) or with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (Dysplasia).Symbols indicate staining of airway smooth muscle (left arrow in PRE-TERM LUNG, NO andright arrow in TERM LUNG, Basal), airway epithelium (all other arrows), vascular endothelium (blue asterisk), and cartilage chondrocytes (red asterisk).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Our immunohistochemical findings, which are consistent with recent results obtained for nNOS with the “biotin-switch” method (7Jaffrey S.R. Erdjument-Bromage H. Ferris C.D. Temps P. Snyder S.H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 193-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (1217) Google Scholar), demonstrate directly that protein S-nitrosylation is coupled to activity of all major forms of NOS, and reductions in basal SNO-protein levels by NOS inhibition emphasize thatS-nitrosylation will be governed by a dynamic equilibrium between addition and removal of NO groups from cysteine thiols. Our findings for eNOS (EDRF) in particular emphasize further thatS-nitrosylation will be regulated by NOS activity in both NOS-containing cells and their functional partners, in keeping with the proposition that the formation of SNO-protein serves as a major route through which NO-related bioactivity is expressed, both within NO-generating cells and during NO-derived intercellular signaling. Thus, because the various forms of NOS are expressed across a wide range of mammalian cell types, our results support the emerging view that S-nitrosylation is a ubiquitous post-translational protein modification with broad regulatory purview (2Stamler J.S.

These findings extend the results with membrane-bound proteins to demonstrate that SNO-proteins can be visualized specifically by immunohistochemistry. We then examined endogenous proteinS-nitrosylation in intact cells in which individual NOS species could be activated selectively, focusing first on vascular tissue.Type 3 NOS (eNOS) is the predominant form in vascular endothelial cells, where it is activated by stimuli that increase intracellular Ca2+ (12Bredt D.S. Snyder S.H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 175-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (2127) Google Scholar, 13Ignarro L. Biosci. Rep. 1999; 19: 51-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). In both primary bovine pulmonary artery endothelial cells and rat CPA-47 endothelial cells, incubation with the Ca2+ ionophore A23187 (1 μm, 10 min) resulted in a large increase in immunoreactivity, which was greatly reduced by treatment with mercury prior to staining and by treatment prior toA23187 exposure with the NOS inhibitorN G-monomethyl-l-arginine (l-NMMA, 1 mm) (Fig. 2 B). In addition, we examined the SNO-protein content of resting andA23187-treated CPA-47 cells by photolysis/chemiluminescence of cellular extracts. Lysates of resting cells contained a low level of SNO (15 ± 1.1 nmol/g of protein), consistent with the presence of basal mercury-labile endothelial immunoreactivity, and treatment withA23187 resulted in a significant increase in SNO content (43 ± 6.8 nmol/g of protein; p < 0.05). Thus, chemical measurement confirms the immunohistochemical demonstration that, in cultured arterial endothelial cells, stimulation of eNOS by ionophore-mediated Ca2+ influx is coupled to increased protein S-nitrosylation.We next examined protein S-nitrosylation in intact vascular tissue in which eNOS could be activated physiologically. Type 3 NOS has been identified as the source of EDRF, and eNOS activity is modulated accordingly by vasoactive neurohormonal signals (1Davis K.L. Martin E. Turko I.V. Murad F. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2001; 41: 203-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar, 13Ignarro L. Biosci. Rep. 1999; 19: 51-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). EDRF mediates vasodilation at least in part through activation in vascular smooth muscle of charybdotoxin-sensitive potassium channels and of Ca2+-ATPase, possibly via S-nitrosylation (14Bolotina V.M. Najibi S. Palacino J.J. Cohen R.A. Nature. 1994; 368: 850-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (1505) Google Scholar,15Cohen R.A. Weisbrod R.M. Gericke M. Yagoubi M. Bierl C. Bolotina V.M. Circ. Res. 1999; 84: 210-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Rings of mouse aorta, suspended in bioassay chambers and precontracted with phenylephrine, relaxed upon application of acetylcholine (ACh) (Fig. 2 C). Immunoreactivity of both endothelium and smooth muscle was increased substantially in sections of rings that were removed from the bioassay shortly after exposure to ACh (Fig. 2 C). Incubation (40 min) with the eNOS inhibitorN G-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester (l-NAME, 1 mm) blocked ACh-induced relaxation and decreased immunoreactivity below basal levels in both endothelium and smooth muscle, demonstrating turnover of protein SNO (Fig. 2 C). Thus, S-nitrosylation is a dynamic protein modification coupled to physiological activity of endothelial type 3 NOS, in both endothelium and associated smooth muscle of intact vascular tissue.To examine S-nitrosylation linked to the additional forms of NOS, we employed cultured cell types in which type 1 NOS (nNOS) or type 2 NOS (iNOS) could be induced selectively by varying culture conditions.Type 1 NOS is the predominant form in neurons (12Bredt D.S. Snyder S.H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 175-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (2127) Google Scholar), and adrenocarcinoma-derived PC-12 cells acquire a neuronal phenotype under the influence of nerve growth factor (NGF). We exposed PC-12 cells overnight to low levels of NGF (100 ng/ml), which increased nNOS expression without gross morphological differentiation. Untreated PC-12 cells contained moderate levels of nNOS and of SNO-protein, and induction of nNOS led to a large increase in proteinS-nitrosylation as revealed by immunohistochemistry (Fig.3 A).Type 2 NOS is the form detected in macrophages, and iNOS expression is greatly enhanced by exposure to cytokines (12Bredt D.S. Snyder S.H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 175-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (2127) Google Scholar). Treatment of macrophage-derived RAW 254.7 cells overnight with bacterial lipopolysaccharide (200 ng/ml) and γ-interferon (200 units/ml) led to a substantial increase in SNO-protein immunoreactivity, which accompanied the morphological differentiation characteristic of cytokine induction of macrophage/neutrophil cells (Fig. 3 B). Increased immunoreactivity was correlated with anl-NMMA-inhibitable increase in SNO-protein levels from about 10 to 150 nmol of SNO/g of protein (p < 0.05), as assessed by photolysis/chemiluminescence of cellular extracts passed through Sephadex G-25 to eliminate low molecular weight nitrosothiols. However, it should be noted that staining of RAW 254.7 cells exhibited greater culture to culture variability than other cell types examined.Finally, we extended our analysis to a more complex tissue, the human lung. The mature lung displays substantial levels of each of the three major forms of NOS, which are distributed discretely across a range of cell types that includes most prominently vascular endothelium (eNOS) and airway epithelium (iNOS), but NOS expression is greatly limited before birth (16Kobzik L. Bredt D.S. Lowenstein C.J. Drazen J. Gaston B. Sugarbaker D. Stamler J.S. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1993; 9: 371-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar). In sections from the lung of a pre-term infant, SNO-protein immunoreactivity was sparse and limited largely to the tracheal epithelium (Fig. 4). In contrast, sections from the lung of a full-term neonate (Fig. 4) exhibited extensive staining, which was most prominent in small artery endothelium, cartilage chondrocytes, and tracheal epithelium and muscle, whereas large artery endothelium was unstained. In addition, in sections from the lung of a pre-term infant administered NO therapeutically by inhalation (≤20 ppm), SNO-protein immunoreactivity was increased in a distribution that overlapped that seen in the neonate except that small artery endothelium remained unstained (Fig.4). Increased S-nitrosylation was also evident throughout sections from the lung of a term infant with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (Fig. 4), consistent with the increased expression of iNOS by resident and infiltrating cells that accompanies lung pathophysiology. Basal, NO-induced, and bronchopulmonary dysplasia-associated immunoreactivity was eliminated by treatment with pCMB prior to staining (not shown). Thus, protein S-nitrosylation is developmentally regulated in multiple tissue compartments of the human lung and altered by both disease and NO therapy.Figure 4SNO-protein immunoreactivity in human lung.

Erdjument-Bromage H. Ferris C.D. Temps P. Snyder S.H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 193-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (1217) Google Scholar), demonstrate directly that protein S-nitrosylation is coupled to activity of all major forms of NOS, and reductions in basal SNO-protein levels by NOS inhibition emphasize thatS-nitrosylation will be governed by a dynamic equilibrium between addition and removal of NO groups from cysteine thiols. Our findings for eNOS (EDRF) in particular emphasize further thatS-nitrosylation will be regulated by NOS activity in both NOS-containing cells and their functional partners, in keeping with the proposition that the formation of SNO-protein serves as a major route through which NO-related bioactivity is expressed, both within NO-generating cells and during NO-derived intercellular signaling. Thus, because the various forms of NOS are expressed across a wide range of mammalian cell types, our results support the emerging view that S-nitrosylation is a ubiquitous post-translational protein modification with broad regulatory purview (2Stamler J.S. Toone E.J. Lipton S.A. Sucher N.J. Neuron. 1997; 18: 691-696Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar, 3Hess D.T. Matsumoto A. Nudelman R. Stamler J.S. Nat.

Cell. 2001; 106: 675-683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1113) Google Scholar), analogous in that respect to protein O-phosphorylation. Unreduced fatty acid-free BSA nitrosated with HCl/NO 2− at a 1:1 molar ratio with regard to nitrite incorporates about one mercury-labile NO group per BSA. As illustrated in Fig. 1(A and B), as little as 0.8 nmol ofS-nitrosylated BSA (SNO-BSA) could be detected on dot blots, whereas unmodified BSA was not recognized. Reactivity was greatly reduced by treating BSA with the sulfhydryl-specific organic mercurial pCMB prior to nitrosation (to block cysteine thiols) or with either mercuric chloride or dithiothreitol (1 mm; not shown) following nitrosation (to cleave the SNO linkage) (Fig. 1 A). Similar results were obtained using nitrosated glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase as substrate (not shown). In addition, antigen competition experiments demonstrated that incubation of antiserum withS-nitrosylated glutathione eliminated subsequent antibody binding to SNO-BSA, whereas incubation with an N-nitroso compound, PAPA-NONOate, had no effect (Fig. 1 B). Finally, we employed the SNO antiserum to detect SNO-BSA on Western blots following IEF in polyacrylamide gels (Fig. 1 C). Whereas dithiothreitol-reduced but otherwise unmodified BSA was not detected, nitrosation with 1.5 mol of acidified nitrite/mol of BSA led to the appearance of two prominent immunoreactive bands, and treatment with a 3-fold molar excess of NO 2−resulted in increased abundance of those isoforms and the appearance of a third, more acidic species. These results reveal the nitrosation-dependent loss of charge groups of basic pK a, and in combination with the dot-blot analysis indicate that SNO-BSA separates in IEF as immunoreactive isoforms due to loss of the influence of thiolate anions on isoelectric point following addition of NO groups to cysteine sulfhydryl groups. In addition, we have recently employed anti-SNO antibodies with Western blotting following non-reducing electrophoresis to demonstrateS-nitrosylation of the ryanodine receptor protein from mammalian skeletal muscle (11Sun J. Xin C. Eu J.P. Stamler J.S. Meissner G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 11158-11162Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar), although the general utility of anti-SNO antiserum in detecting varied SNO-proteins on Western blots remains to be determined. Overall, our analysis indicates that SNO-directed antibodies will provide a uniquely useful marker for S-nitrosylated proteins, if specificity is verified by the criterion of mercury and thiol sensitivity as well as, optimally, NOS dependence as described below. To apply this immunological tool to the analysis ofS-nitrosylation in situ, we employed immunohistochemistry to examine SNO-proteins in cultured cells and tissue sections. Specificity of SNO-protein detection was demonstrated by mercury reversibility and NOS dependence of staining and by parallel measurements of protein-SNO by photolysis/chemiluminescence. In addition, control samples of all cells and tissues were processed with non-immune serum. Endothelial and smooth muscle cells in tangential sections of pig aorta, and bovine pulmonary artery endothelial cells in primary culture, exhibited a low basal level of immunoreactivity, which was increased substantially by nitrosation with HCl/NO 2− prior to fixation (Fig.2, A and B). Both basal and induced staining was largely eliminated by treatment with either mercuric chloride or pCMB before incubation with antiserum (Fig.2, A and B). Mercury treatment had no effect on nitrotyrosine immunohistochemistry in parallel sections (not shown). These findings extend the results with membrane-bound proteins to demonstrate that SNO-proteins can be visualized specifically by immunohistochemistry.

In both primary bovine pulmonary artery endothelial cells and rat CPA-47 endothelial cells, incubation with the Ca2+ ionophore A23187 (1 μm, 10 min) resulted in a large increase in immunoreactivity, which was greatly reduced by treatment with mercury prior to staining and by treatment prior toA23187 exposure with the NOS inhibitorN G-monomethyl-l-arginine (l-NMMA, 1 mm) (Fig. 2 B). In addition, we examined the SNO-protein content of resting andA23187-treated CPA-47 cells by photolysis/chemiluminescence of cellular extracts. Lysates of resting cells contained a low level of SNO (15 ± 1.1 nmol/g of protein), consistent with the presence of basal mercury-labile endothelial immunoreactivity, and treatment withA23187 resulted in a significant increase in SNO content (43 ± 6.8 nmol/g of protein; p < 0.05).

The microphthalmia transcription factor (MITF) is required for terminal differentiation of osteoclasts. To determine whether MITF could be a target of RANKL signaling, a phosphospecific MITF antibody directed against conserved residue Ser307, a potential mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) site, was produced. Using this antibody, we could demonstrate that MITF was rapidly and persistently phosphorylated upon stimulation of primary osteoclasts with RANKL and that phosphorylation of Ser307 correlated with expression of the target gene tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase. MITF phosphorylation at Ser307 also correlated with persistent activation of p38 MAPK, and p38 MAPK could utilize MITF Ser307 as a substrate in vitro. The phosphorylation of MITF and activation of target gene expression in osteoclasts were blocked by p38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580. In transient transfections, a constitutively active Rac1 or MKK6 gene could collaborate with MITF to activate the tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase gene promoter dependent on Ser307. Dominant negative p38 α and β could inhibit the collaboration between upstream signaling components and MITF in the transient assays.

Based on the similarity of the phenotype of the bone marrow-derived precursor cells blocked for p38 MAPK activity and the mi/mi osteoclasts-like cells, we hypothesized that MITF may be a target of the p38 MAPK in osteoclasts.In this study, we investigate whether MITF is a potential target of the p38 MAPK in osteoclasts. We show that MITF was persistently phosphorylated on a conserved serine 307 in primary osteoclast-like cells in response to RANKL signaling and that phosphorylation of serine 307 correlated with expression of the target gene, TRAP. Further, p38 MAPK could phosphorylate serine 307 in vitro, and phosphorylation of MITF at serine 307 increased the ability of the factor to stimulate the TRAP promoter activity in transient transfection assays. We conclude that MITF may be a direct target of a RANKL/p38 signaling pathway that is necessary for osteoclast differentiation and function.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCulture and Analysis of OCLsHematopoietic precursors were obtained from the bone marrow of wild type mice. OCLs were grown in the presence of 50 ng/ml colony-stimulating factor-1 (CSF-1) for 3 days.

MITF corresponding to amino acids 297–377 (nucleotides 1018–1263) was cloned into pGEX2t (Pharmacia) and was purified to 95% purity by glutathione Sepharose affinity chromatography. Versions of the protein with either serine or alanine at amino acid position 307 were produced and purified.RANKL Bacterial Expression and PurificationRANKL corresponding to amino acids 158–316 (nucleotides 472–978) was placed into vector pET 32b (Novagene), purified by native lysis to 95% purity by nickel-Sepharose (Qiagen) affinity chromatography and eluted in imidazole. The concentration of soluble RANKL was optimized for induction of p38 phosphorylation and formation of TRAP-positive osteoclasts with each preparation.Immunological Reagents and AnalysisThe peptide PSTGLSpSPDLVN (where pS represents phosphoserine), corresponding to amino acids 301–312 of MITF was synthesized (QCB/BIOSOURCE, Hopkinton, MA). The position of the phosphate at amino acid 307 was confirmed by NMR. The phosphopeptide was used to immunize two New Zealand White rabbits. Collected serum was pooled and passed over a column to which the nonphosphopeptide was coupled, and material that did not bind to this column was collected and passed over a phosphopeptide affinity column. Bound material was eluted from this second column with glycine buffer, dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline, and stored at −70 °C.

Antibodies that recognized p38 MAPK were obtained from New England Biolabs Cell Signaling.Western blotting was performed with nitrocellulose membranes and the ECL detection system (Kirkegaard and Perry Laboratories). For Western blots using the antibodies that recognize total or phosphorylated p38, the manufacturer's protocol was followed. For the phosphospecific MITF antibody, the blot was blocked in TBS (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl), 0.1% Tween 20, 5% powdered milk for 2 h at room temperature. The blot was washed three times in TBS, 0.1% Tween 20. The phosphospecific MITF antibody was added to fresh blocking buffer and incubated for 2 h at room temperature. The blot was washed three times in TBS, 0.1% Tween 20. The secondary antibody was incubated in TBS, 0.1% Tween 20 for 1 h at room temperature. The blot was washed three times in TBS, 0.1% Tween 20 and developed.For [35S]methionine labeling experiments, cells were starved in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium lacking methionine. 90 μCi of [35S]methionine (ICN) was added to the cells, and the cells were labeled for 3 h. Cells were lysed in RIPA (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 125 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate) that included 10 μg/ml antipain, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mm sodium vanadate. Cells were incubated in RIPA at 4 °C for 20 min and then centrifuged at 25,000 rpm for 20 min. Protein G beads (Amersham Biosciences) were added to the lysate, and the antibody (HA from Babco) was added. The immunoprecipitates were incubated overnight at 4 °C. The immunoprecipitates were washed three times in RIPA and run on an 8% SDS-PAGE.Kinase AssayFull activation of recombinant p38 αin vitro was achieved by incubation with recombinant MKK6(E) at a 5:1 molar ratio at 37 °C for 15 min in the presence of ATP as previously described (27.Zhao M.

In vitro kinase assays were carried out at 37 °C for 15 min, using 0.2 μg of recombinant kinase, 5 μg of GST-MITF, 250 μm ATP, and 12 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP in 20 μl of kinase reaction buffer. Reactions were terminated by the addition of SDS sample buffer. Reaction products were resolved on a 10% SDS-PAGE. Phosphorylated proteins were visualized by autoradiography.p38 MAPK activities were measured in an immune complex kinase assay. RAW264.7 cells were stimulated with RANKL at 100 ng/ml for 15 min.

The immunoprecipitates were incubated with anti-p38 antibody (Cell Signaling Technology) overnight at 4 °C. The immunoprecipitates were collected and washed three times in RIPA and two times with kinase buffer (20 mm Mops, pH 7.5, 25 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 1 mm sodium vanadate). Immunoprecipitates of anti-p38 were mixed with 0.5 μg of GST-MITF, 150 μmATP, and 12 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP in 50 μl of kinase buffer. The reactions were further incubated at 30 °C for 30 min.

Phosphorylated proteins were visualized by autoradiography.RESULTSProduction and Characterization of Antibodies Specific for MITF Phosphoserine 307Osteoclasts that are grown in the presence of CSF-1 and RANK ligand but have been blocked for the activation of the p38 MAPK by the specific inhibitor SB203580 remain mononuclear and stain weakly for the osteoclast marker TRAP (13.Matsumoto M. Sudo T. Osada H. Tsujimoto M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31155-31161Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar), a similar phenotype to the osteoclasts that are cultured from the mice homozygous for the mi mutation (23.Thesingh C.W. Scherft J.P. Bone. 1985; 6: 43-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 24.Holtrop M.E. Cox K.A. Elion G. Simmons H.A. Raisz L.G. Metab. Bone Dis. Relat. Res. 1981; 3: 123-129Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). This led us to test the hypothesis that MITF might be a target of the p38 MAPK pathway during osteoclast differentiation. We analyzed the amino acid sequence of MITF and discovered a potential p38 phosphorylation site at serine 307 that is conserved among different species including human, mouse, and chicken (Fig. 1A). However, the serine at amino acid position 307 is not conserved among the other related transcription factors, TFEC, TFE3, and TFEB (29.Rehli M. Elzen N.D. Cassady A.I. Ostrowski M.C. Hume D.A. Genomics. 1999; 56: 111-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar).To begin to investigate if MITF was phosphorylated at serine 307 in osteoclasts, an antibody that was specific for the phosphorylated serine at residue 307 was developed (see “Experimental Procedures”). For this purpose, the peptide PSTGLSpSPDLVN (corresponding to amino acids 301–312 of MITF) was synthesized and used to produce polyclonal rabbit serum. Following affinity purification, the specificity of the antibody for detecting phosphoserine 307 MITF in Western blotting experiments was tested with recombinant GST-MITF corresponding to amino acids 297–377. For these experiments, the GST-MITF region was incubated in vitro with activated p38 α and ATP (Fig. 1B). These experiments showed that only GST-MITF that had been incubated with the p38 preparation was recognized by the antibody (Fig. 1B, lane 1 versus lane 2). Recombinant protein containing alanine substituted for serine at amino acid position 307 was not recognized by the phosphospecific antibody in either the presence or absence of activated p38 MAPK. (Fig. 1B, compare lanes 3 and 4 with lane 1). When the blot in Fig. 1B was stripped and reprobed with an antibody specific for the GST moiety, we were able to detect the recombinant protein in all four lanes (Fig. 1B, bottom panel).To further characterize the phospho-Ser307-specific antibody, RAW 264.7 cell lines that stably expressed either HA-tagged MITF or S307A/P308A HA-tagged MITF were created. The cells were stimulated with RANKL for various times, and cell extracts were prepared and immunoprecipitated with the antibody recognizing the HA epitope. The phosphorylation status of MITF Ser307 was determined using the phosphospecific MITF antibody (Fig. 1C, top panel). This analysis demonstrated that Ser307 was phosphorylated following 15, 30, or 60 min with RANKL stimulation but that the antibody did not react with the S307A/P308A MITF protein. The bottom panel of Fig. 1C represents the blot in the top panel reprobed with an antibody that recognizes the HA tag to show approximately equal loading of the HA-containing immunoprecipitates.MITF Is Rapidly and Persistently Phosphorylated in Osteoclasts after RANKL StimulationThe anti-phospho-MITF antibody was used to determine the phosphorylation status of endogenous MITF in primary osteoclast precursors after stimulation by RANKL. Bone marrow-derived osteoclast precursors were obtained from wild type mice and cultured in the presence of CSF-1 for 3 days. At this time, RANKL was added to the bone marrow cell cultures, and nuclear extracts were prepared and analyzed by Western blotting (Fig. 2). Using the anti-phospho-Ser307 antibody, MITF phosphorylation could be detected following 30 min of RANKL stimulation and persisted following 24 h of continuous RANKL treatment (Fig. 2A, upper panel). When the same blot was reprobed with a nondiscriminating MITF antibody, approximately equal levels of MITF protein are seen in all lanes (Fig. 2A, lower panel). MITF appeared as a doublet with electrophoretic mobility of around 55 and 57 kDa in these experiments, and both bands are detected by the anti-phospho-Ser307antibody (Fig. 2A). Previous work in melanocytes has also indicated that MITF is resolved as a doublet in extracts prepared from this cell type and that the upper band is due to c-Kit-mediated phosphorylation of conserved serine residue 73 (30). Ser73is also phosphorylated in osteoclasts in response to CSF-1, accounting for the doublet band pattern in this cell line as well (31.Weilbaecher K.N. Motyckova G. Huber W.E. Takemoto C.M.

As shown below (see Fig. 5) mutation of Ser73 to alanine results in a loss of the slower migrating band (see Fig. 5).Figure 2RANKL stimulates phosphorylation of MITF at serine 307.

The top panel is a Western blot of nuclear extracts from osteoclasts run on an 8% SDS-PAGE and probed using phosphospecific MITF antibody. The numbers abovethe lanes indicate the hours after RANKL stimulation that the extracts were collected. The bottom panel is the same blot in the top panel reprobed with an antibody that recognizes all forms of MITF. B, real time quantitative RT-PCR (Taqman assay) was performed using RNA from bone marrow cultures treated for the same time with RANKL as indicated in A. Both TRAP and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase RNA were quantitated. All values in the chart are expressed as the ratio of TRAP to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase expression and then further normalized to the CSF-1-only control. C, p38 MAPK is phosphorylated in response to RANKL stimulation in osteoclasts. The top panel is a Western blot of whole cell extracts from osteoclasts, run on a 10% SDS-PAGE and probed using phosphospecific p38 antibody. The numbers above the lanes indicate the hours after RANKL stimulation that the extracts were collected.

Moreover, a major conformational transition of the Alzheimer β-amyloid peptide is observed upon binding of the 1–40 β-amyloid peptide to ganglioside GM1-containing membranes (14.Choo-Smith L.P. Surewicz W.K. FEBS Lett. 1997; 402: 95-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Taken together, these data suggest that conformational changes in prion, Alzheimer, and HIV-1 proteins may occur in lipid rafts under the control of specific sphingolipids. prion protein galactosylceramide combinatorial extension The binding of HIV-1 to GalCer is mediated by the third variable (V3) loop of gp120, as demonstrated by various immunological, biochemical and biophysical approaches (15.Cook D.G. Fantini J. Spitalnik S.L. Gonzalez-Scarano F. Virology. 1994; 201: 206-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 16.Yahi N. Sabatier J.M. Baghdiguian S. Gonzalez-Scarano F. Fantini J. J.

Since GalCer is bound by both HIV-1 gp120 and prion proteins, we looked for a potential V3-like glycolipid-binding domain in human PrP. As a matter of fact, the search for molecules interacting with PrPc is a major issue in the transmissible encephalopathies field. The presence of a similar motif in the Alzheimer β-amyloid peptide was also investigated. Structure similarity searches were carried out using the combinatorial extension (CE) method (18.Shindyalov I.N. Bourne P.E. Protein Eng. 1998; 11: 739-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (1702) Google Scholar). A putative GalCer-binding motif was identified in the human PrP protein on the basis of its structural homology with the V3 loop. A similar motif was also found in Alzheimer β-amyloid peptide. The interaction of sphingolipids with the V3-like domain of human PrP and Alzheimer β-amyloid peptide was analyzed using the Langmuir film balance technology. The chemicals used in this study, including GalCer, sphingomyelin, and the β-amyloid synthetic peptide (fragment 1–40) of the higher purity available were purchased from Sigma. The synthetic peptides P1 (KQHTVTTTTKGENFTETDVKMMER) and P2 (KQHTVTTTTKGENFTKTDVKMMER) respectively derived from the human PrP protein and the E200K mutant were purchased from Euro Sequence Gene service (Evry, France). The peptides were purified by high performance liquid chromatography (purity >95%) and characterized by electrospray mass spectrometry (experimental Mr of 2812.4 and 2810.8 for peptides P1 and P2, with a theoretical Mr of 2811.4 and 2810.4, respectively). Structure similarity searches were performed using the two chains calculation routine of the CE program (Ref. 18.Shindyalov I.N. Bourne P.E. Protein Eng. 1998; 11: 739-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (1702) Google Scholar and cl.sdsc.edu/ce.html). CE aligns two polypeptide chains using characteristics of their local geometry as defined by vectors between carbon α positions. Molecular structures were visualized using the SWISS-PDB viewer (Ref. 19.Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2714-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (9641) Google Scholar and expasy.ch/spdbv/). PDB identification numbers were 1CE4 (HIV-1 gp120 V3 loop peptide), 1QLX (human PrP), and 1BJB (human Alzheimer peptide). The surface pressure was measured with a fully automated microtensiometer (μTROUGH SX, Kibron Inc.). The apparatus allowed the recording of pressure-area compression isotherms and the kinetics of interaction of a ligand with the monomolecular film using a set of specially designed Teflon troughs. All experiments were carried out in a controlled atmosphere at 20 °C ± 1 °C. Monomolecular films of the indicated lipids were spread on pure water subphases (volume of 800 μl) from hexane:chloroform:ethanol (11:5:4, v/v/v) as described previously (6.Hammache D. Piéroni G. Yahi N. Delézay O. Koch N. Lafont H. Tamalet C. Fantini J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7967-7971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). After spreading of the film, 5 min was allowed for solvent evaporation. To measure the interaction of the peptide with lipid monolayers, various concentrations of the ligand were injected in the subphase with a 10-μl Hamilton syringe, and pressure increases produced were recorded until reaching the equilibrium (maximal surface pressure increase Δπ max usually obtained after 100–200 min of interaction). The data were analyzed with the Filmware 2.3 program (Kibron Inc.). The accuracy of the system under our experimental conditions was ± 0.25 mN m−1 for surface pressure. Structure similarity searches revealed the presence of a HIV-1 gp120 V3-like motif in the human prion protein PrP and in the Alzheimer β-amyloid peptide (Fig. 1a). The V3-like domain of PrP consists of a helix-turn-helix motif formed by 33 of the 36 amino acid residues of a disulfide-linked loop (Cys179–Cys214). This loop includes the α2 and α3 helix of PrPc (Fig. 1a). In the V3 loop of HIV-1 gp120, the motif is a hairpin structure with only one α-helix corresponding to α3 in PrP. This is also the case for the Alzheimer β-amyloid peptide. The V3-like motif of PrP and Alzheimer proteins has the same size as the V3 loop so that they can be easily superimposed (Fig. 1b). Moreover, the motif contains His, Tyr, and/or Phe residues that mediate binding to individual sugar rings of complex carbohydrates (20.Sutton J.M. Chow-Worn O. Spaven L. Silman N.J. Hallis B. Shone C.C. FEBS Lett. 2001; 493: 45-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 21.Nyholm P.G. Brunton J.L. Lingwood C.A. Int. J. Biol.

Microbiol. 2000; 37: 1041-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). In particular, an aromatic residue essential for GalCer recognition (16.Yahi N. Sabatier J.M. Baghdiguian S. Gonzalez-Scarano F. Fantini J. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 320-325Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) is found at the same position and has a similar orientation in both loops, namely Tyr21 in the V3 loop, and Phe198 in human PrP (Fig. 1b). In the same way, residues Tyr10 of the Alzheimer β-amyloid peptide and Phe20 of the gp120 V3 loop could be partially superimposed. These observations suggest that the structural alignments are highly significant, in agreement with the alignment parameters (including root mean square deviations) provided by the CE program (Table I). Thus, our study confirms the capacity of the CE program to detect specific motifs in unrelated proteins sharing little sequence homology (18.Shindyalov I.N. Bourne P.E.

GalCer and sphingomyelin were detected in highly purified infectious prion rods, suggesting that PrP may specifically interact with these sphingolipids during its stay in lipid rafts (4.Klein T.R. Kirsch D. Kaufmann R. Riesner D. Biol. Chem. 1998; 379: 655-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The identification of a V3-like domain in human PrP prompted us to study the interaction of this domain with GalCer and sphingomyelin. A peptide (P1) derived from the putative glycolipid-binding motif of human PrP (KQHTVTTTTKGENFTETDVKMMER) was synthesized, and its interaction with sphingolipids analyzed using the Langmuir film balance technology. In these experiments, the peptide P1 was added in the aqueous subphase underneath a monomolecular film of lipid, and the resulting interaction was measured as an increase in the surface pressure of the film (6.Hammache D. Piéroni G. Yahi N. Delézay O. Koch N. Lafont H. Tamalet C. Fantini J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7967-7971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). This technique is one of the most sensitive for studying lipid-ligands interactions (24.Maggio B. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1994; 62: 55-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The synthetic peptide P1 was found to interact specifically with GalCer, and the interaction was definitely dose-dependent (Fig. 2). The maximal surface pressure increase (Δπ max = 8 mN/m) was obtained with a peptide concentration of 100 nm. Similar data were previously obtained in our laboratory with a synthetic peptide derived from the conserved motif of the V3 loop crown (i.e. GPGRAF) (6.Hammache D. Piéroni G. Yahi N. Delézay O. Koch N. Lafont H. Tamalet C. Fantini J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7967-7971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). To assess the specificity of GalCer-peptide P1 interaction, monomolecular films of GalCer were prepared at various initial pressures (πi) and the maximal surface pressure increase (Δπ max) induced by the peptide on these films was determined after equilibrium had been reached. Below a πi of 30 mN/m, which corresponds to a fluid disordered (Lc) phase, the Δπ max induced by the peptide was between 5 and 10 mN/m (Fig. 3a). At a πi of 30 mN/m, the value of Δπ max reached 16 mN/m. Then, for values of πi above 30 mN/m, which do correspond to raft-like liquid-ordered (Lo) phase domains, Δπ max gradually decreased as πi increased. The influence of the initial surface pressure on the compressibility of the sphingolipid monolayer demonstrates the high specificity of the interaction as previously established for several other lipids and ligands (6.Hammache D. Piéroni G. Yahi N. Delézay O. Koch N. Lafont H. Tamalet C. Fantini J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7967-7971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 24.Maggio B. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1994; 62: 55-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The critical pressure of insertion (i.e.the theoretical value of πi extrapolated for Δπ max = 0 mN/m) was 45 mN/m. Interestingly, the mean lipid density of cellular membranes corresponds to a surface pressure of at least 30 mN/m (25.Quinn P.J. Gunstone F.D. Harwood J.L. Padley F.B. The Lipid Handbook. Chapman and Hall, New York1994: 465-485Google Scholar). Thus, these data suggest that the interaction of peptide P1 with GalCer requires a densely packed organization of the glycosphingolipid, which is likely to occur within a lipid raft (26.Brown R.E. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 1-9Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The V3-like region of human PrP contains a mutation site (E200K) corresponding to the most common familial form of the Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (1.Prusiner S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13363-13387Crossref PubMed Scopus (5168) Google Scholar). Residue 200 is located at the N-terminal end of the second α-helix of the sphingolipid-binding motif (i.e. α3 of human PrP). Another synthetic peptide similar to P1 but bearing the E200K substitution was therefore synthesized (P2), and its interaction with sphingolipids was also analyzed using the lipid monolayer assay. As for peptide P1, the interaction of peptide P2 with a monomolecular film GalCer (πi = 10 mN/m) was dose-dependent (Fig. 2). When the interaction was analyzed at various values of πi, a triphasic pattern of interaction was evidenced (Fig. 3b). When πi was between 10 and 15 mN/m, the maximal surface pressure increase induced by the peptide gradually decreased as πi increased. Between 15 and 25 mN/M, the peptide did not affect the surface pressure of the GalCer monolayer. Finally, for values of πi greater than 25 mN/m, a specific interaction occurred, with a critical pressure of insertion of 42 mN/m. These data indicate that both peptides P1 and P2 could interact with GalCer, with a marked preference for densely packed films that mimic the organization of sphingolipids found in membrane rafts. The minor differences observed at low surface pressures (πi < 25 mN/m) may not have important implications, since these values of the surface pressure do not reflect the organization of lipids commonly found in biological membranes (25.Quinn P.J. Gunstone F.D. Harwood J.L. Padley F.B. The Lipid Handbook. Chapman and Hall, New York1994: 465-485Google Scholar). From a structural point of view, these data are consistent with the high level of structural homology between the wild-type and the E200K mutant of human PrP (27.Zhang Y. Swietnicki W. Zagorski M.G. Surewicz W.K. Sönnichsen F.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33650-33654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The main effects of the E200K mutation are (i) major changes in the distribution of charges on the protein surface and (ii) the loss of a salt-bridge interaction between the side chains of Glu200 and Lys204. In any case, the E200K mutation has little (if any) effect on the orientation and accessibility of aromatic residues that are involved in binding to GalCer. However, the redistribution of surface charges induced by the E200K mutation may dramatically affect the interaction of PrP with charged lipids such as sphingomyelin. As shown in Fig. 4b, the mutated peptide (P2) could interact with sphingomyelin only when the film was prepared at a very low πi (<15 mN/m). In particular, no interaction occurred at the physiological pressure of 30 mN/m. In contrast, the wild-type peptide (P1) interacted with sphingomyelin films prepared at low and at high πi (critical pressures of insertion of 25 and 40 mN/m, respectively) (Fig. 4a). These data show that the E200K mutation specifically affected the recognition of sphingomyelin. The replacement of an acid residue (Glu) by a basic one (Lys) in the sphingolipid binding site is likely to affect the binding of PrP to this positively charged lipid. Impaired recognition of sphingomyelin in the raft environment may destabilize membrane-PrPcinteractions and thus facilitate the conformational change associated with the PrPc → PrPsc transition. Indeed, the depletion of sphingomyelin in neural cells treated with either a ceramide synthase inhibitor or sphingomyelinase resulted in a marked stimulation of the PrPc → PrPsc conversion (28.Naslavsky N Shmeeda H. Friedlander G. Yanai A. Futerman A.H. Barenholz Y. Taraboulos A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20763-20771Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Most importantly, the V3-like domain of PrP identified in the present study is involved in the dimerization of PrP, an early event that constitutes an important step on the pathway of the PrPc → PrPsc conversion (29.Knaus K.J. Morillas M. Swietnicki W. Malone M. Surewicz W.K. Yee V.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 770-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). Moreover, amino acid residues located in the vicinity of the putative raft-binding domain of PrP are thought to bind an auxiliary molecule essential to prion propagation (30.Kaneko K. Zulianello L. Scott M. Cooper C.M. Wallace A.C. James T.L. Cohen F.E. Prusiner S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 94: 10069-10074Crossref Scopus (483) Google Scholar). Taken together, these data support the view that the V3-like domain of PrP is involved in the PrPc → PrPsc conversion and that raft sphingolipids may play an active role in this process. This hypothesis is consistent with recent data showing that the conformation of prion proteins is highly sensitive to the membrane environment (31.Morillas M. Swietnicki W. Gambetti P. Surewicz W.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36859-36865Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). We propose that sphingolipids such as GalCer and sphingomyelin stabilize the non-pathological conformation of PrPc in the lipid raft through specific interactions with the V3-like domain of PrPc. Since a similar domain was characterized in Alzheimer β-amyloid peptide, we studied the interaction of this peptide with GalCer and sphingomyelin using the monomolecular film binding assay (Fig. 5). In both cases, Δπ max gradually decrease as πi increased (critical pressures of insertion of 45 and 56 mN/m for GalCer and sphingomyelin, respectively). The ability of the β-amyloid peptide (fragment 1–40) to recognize both GalCer and sphingomyelin is likely due to the presence of both sugar-binding residues (Tyr10, His13, His14, Phe20, Phe21) and acid residues (Asp7, Glu11) within the V3-like motif. The finding of a common sphingolipid-binding motif in Alzheimer, prion, and HIV-1 proteins underscores the role of membrane rafts in the pathogenesis of the corresponding diseases. Further studies are warranted to assess whether raft lipids act as auxiliary molecules implicated in the conformational change of PrP (2.Vey M. Pilkuhn S. Wille H. Nixon R. DeArmond S.J. Smart E.J.

FEBS Lett. 1997; 402: 95-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). In any case, the main outcome of the present study is the finding of a structural homology between unrelated proteins known to induce major morphological and functional alterations of the central nervous system. Synthetic soluble analogs of GalCer bind to the V3 loop of gp120 and inhibit HIV-1 fusion (32.Fantini J. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 311: 626-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). It would be of interest to evaluate the activity of such glycolipid analogs on the PrPc → PrPsc conversion as well as on the formation of amyloid fibrils."

In omnivores such as humans and laboratory rodents, urea represents up to 40–50% of all urinary solutes and is markedly concentrated in urine with respect to plasma (up to 100-fold in humans and 250-fold in rodents) (1Bankir L. Trinh-Trang-Tan M.M. Brenner B.M. The Kidney. 6th Ed. W. B. Saunders Co., Philadelphia, PA2000: 637-679Google Scholar). Because of a unique intrarenal recycling process enabling urea to accumulate in the medulla, urea contributes to the urinary concentrating mechanism and, thus, to water conservation (1Bankir L. Trinh-Trang-Tan M.M. Brenner B.M. The Kidney. 6th Ed. W. B. Saunders Co., Philadelphia, PA2000: 637-679Google Scholar, 2Masilamani S. Knepper M.A. Burg M.B. Brenner B.M. The Kidney. 6th Ed. W. B. Saunders Co., Philadelphia, PA2000: 595-635Google Scholar). Abnormally low blood urea concentration in malnutrition results in a urinary concentrating defect because of impaired intrarenal urea accumulation (3Klahr S. Tripathy K. Garcia F.T. Mayoral L.G. Ghitis J. Bolaños O. Am. J. Med. 1967; 43: 84-96Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Physiological studies over 30 years provided evidence for the existence of facilitated urea transporters in erythrocytes and certain segments of the nephron (4Sands J.M. Timmer R.T. Gunn R.B. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: F321-F339PubMed Google Scholar). Two major subfamilies of mammalian urea transporters have been identified, the “renal tubular-type” urea transporter (UT)1-A and the “erythrocyte-vascular type” urea transporter UT-B (4Sands J.M. Timmer R.T. Gunn R.B. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: F321-F339PubMed Google Scholar, 5Sands J.M. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1999; 10: 635-646PubMed Google Scholar, 6Bankir L. Trinh-Trang-Tan M.M. Exp.

UT-A1 (original name UT1) is expressed in the apical membrane of terminal inner medullary collecting duct cells and is thought to be involved in the vasopressin-regulated increase in urea permeability (10Nielsen S.

Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 2580-2587Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). UT-A2 (UT2) is located in the late part of descending thin limbs of short loops of Henle and in the intermediate part of descending thin limbs of long loops, and it may facilitate urea recycling (1Bankir L. Trinh-Trang-Tan M.M. Brenner B.M. The Kidney. 6th Ed. W. B. Saunders Co., Philadelphia, PA2000: 637-679Google Scholar, 12Smith C.P. Lee W.S. Martial S. Knepper M.A. You G. Sands J.M. Hediger M.A. J.

Physiol. 1997; 272: F654-F660PubMed Google Scholar). UT-A3 is most abundant in intracellular membranes and in the apical region of inner medullary collecting duct cells (14Terris J.M. Knepper M.A. Wade J.B. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: F325-F332Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The localization of UT-A4 in the kidney is unclear (15Karakashian A. Timmer R.T. Klein J.D. Gunn R.B. Sands J.M. Bagnasco S.M. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1999; 10: 230-237PubMed Google Scholar). UT-A5 mRNA was localized to the peritubular myoid cells of the testis (16Fenton R.A. Howorth A. Cooper G.J. Meccariello R. Morris I.D. Smith C.P. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: C1425-C1431Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A UT-B isoform (original names UT11, HUT11, and UT3) was cloned from human bone marrow (17Olives B. Neau P. Bailly P. Hediger M.A. Rousselet G. Cartron J.P. Ripoche P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31649-31652Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and rat kidney (18Tsukaguchi H. Shayakul C. Berger U.V. Tokui T. Brown D. Hediger M.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 1506-1515Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). In rat, UT-B is expressed in the kidney outer and inner medulla, testis, brain, bone marrow, and spleen (18Tsukaguchi H.

Physiol. 2001; 281: C1318-C1325Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). UT-B is a 384-amino acid protein having 62% identity to rat UT-A2. UT-B has similar membrane topology to UT-A2 based on hydropathy analysis and has functional characteristics similar to UT-A1 and UT-A2. We reported that rat UT-B heterologously expressed at a relatively high level inXenopus oocytes functioned as a urea/water channel utilizing a common aqueous pathway (21Yang B. Verkman A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9369-9372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), however, the relevance of water transport by UT-B in mammalian physiology is unresolved (22Sidoux-Walter F. Lucien N. Olives B. Gobin R. Rousselet G. Kamsteeg E.J. Ripoche P. Deen P.M. Cartron J.P. Bailly P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30228-30235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). We report here the generation of the first transgenic mouse model of facilitated urea transporter deletion. The erythrocyte/vasa recta transporter UT-B was deleted by targeted gene disruption, and the phenotype of the null mice was studied with focus on urinary concentrating ability. Erythrocyte urea permeability in UT-B null mice was remarkably reduced, and the mice manifested a unique type of urea-selective urinary concentrating defect. Our data provide evidence that UT-B-dependent countercurrent exchange of urea in the renal medulla contributes to approximately one-third of the total capacity of the kidney to concentrate urine but contributes even more greatly to the ability of the kidney to concentrate urea itself. Kidney mRNA was isolated (Oligotex direct mRNA kit, Qiagen) from C57/bl6 mice. cDNA was reverse-transcribed from the mRNA using oligo(dT) (SuperScript II preamplification kit, Invitrogen). Polymerase chain reaction amplification was performed with cDNA template and primers designed from the rat UT-B sequence (sense, 5′-AGGTGTGGCCTCAAAGTACTTGGCTA-3′; antisense, 5′-GATAGCAGCGTGCAGGCACATGAGT-3′). The PCR product (∼ 0.7 kb) was purified (Qiaex II gel extraction kit, Qiagen) and subcloned into PCRII TA cloning vector (Invitrogen). The full-length insert was sequenced. 5′ and 3′ end cDNA sequences were obtained by 5′- and 3′-RACE (CLONTECH). For functional measurements of urea and water permeability, the mouse UT-B cDNA (full-length coding sequence) was subcloned into oocyte expression plasmid pSP64T, and in vitro transcribed cRNA (5 ng) was expressed inXenopus laevis oocytes as described previously (21Yang B. Verkman A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9369-9372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The structure of the mouse UT-B gene was analyzed by PCR amplification of exon-intron-exon fragments by using C57/bl6 mouse liver genomic DNA as template. All exons and exon-intron boundaries were sequenced. A targeting vector for homologous recombination was constructed with a 1.7-kb genomic UT-B DNA fragment containing intron 2 and part of exon 3 (left arm) and a 5.5-kb fragment containing part of exon 6 and intron 7 (right arm) (see Fig.2 A). The left and right arm genomic fragments (surrounding a 1.8-kb PolIIneobpA cassette) were PCR-amplified, and a PGK-tk cassette was inserted upstream for negative selection. The targeting vector was linearized at a unique downstream NotI site and electroporated into CB1–4 embryonic stem cells. Transfected embryonic stem cells were selected with G418 and FIAU for 7 days, yielding two targeted clones from 120 doubly resistant colonies on PCR screening with a neo-specific sense primer and a UT-Bgene-specific antisense primer located 50 bp upstream of the targeted region. Homologous recombination was confirmed by Southern hybridization in which 10 μg of genomic DNA was digested withSpeI, electrophoresed, transferred to a Nylon+ membrane (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.), and hybridized with a 1.1-kb genomic fragment. Embryonic stem cells were injected into postcoitus 2.5-day eight-cell morula stage CD1 zygotes, cultured overnight to blastocysts, and transferred to pseudopregnant B6D2 females. Offspring were genotyped by PCR followed by Southern blot analysis as described above. Heterozygous founder mice containing the disruptedUT-B gene in the germ line were bred to produce homozygous UT-B knockout mice. Total RNA from mouse tissues was isolated using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). mRNAs purified by Oligotex direct mRNA kit (Qiagen) were resolved on a 1% formaldehyde-agarose denaturing gel (1.5 μg/lane), transferred to a Nylon+ membrane (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.), and hybridized at high stringency with a 32P-labeled probe corresponding to the mouse UT-B cDNA coding sequence. Immunoperoxidase localization of UT-B protein in fixed frozen kidney sections was done using a 1:500 dilution of rabbit polyclonal serum raised against a C-terminal peptide (DNRIFYLQNKKRMVESPL). Immunoblot analysis of hemoglobin-free ghost membranes from erythrocytes was carried out with the same antibody as described previously (23Yang B. Fukuda N. van Hoek A. Matthay M.A. Ma T. Verkman A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2686-2692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Fresh erythrocytes obtained by tail bleeding (100–200 μl/bleed) were washed three times in phosphate-buffered saline to remove serum and the cellular buffy coat. Stopped-flow measurements were carried out on a Hi-Tech Sf-51 instrument. For measurement of osmotic water permeability, suspensions of erythrocytes (∼0.5% hematocrit) in phosphate-buffered saline were subjected to a 250 mminwardly directed gradient of sucrose. The kinetics of decreasing cell volume were measured from the time course of 90oscattered light intensity at 530 nm wavelength. Osmotic water permeability coefficients (P f) were computed from the light scattering time course (24Yang B. Ma T. Verkman A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 624-628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). For the measurement of urea permeability, the erythrocyte suspension was subjected to a 250 mm inwardly directed gradient of urea. In some experiments, 0.7 mm phloretin was added to the erythrocyte suspension prior to stopped-flow experiments. Daily water intake and urine output were evaluated in 30–40-day-old mice placed in mouse metabolic cages (Harvard Apparatus). In other experiments, urine samples were obtained by placing mice on a wire mesh platform in a clean glass beaker until spontaneous voiding was observed. Blood samples were obtained by tail bleeding, and plasma was separated from blood cells by centrifugation. In some experiments, urine samples were obtained from the same mice under basal conditions (unrestricted access to food and water) and after a 24-h deprivation of food and water. Inner medulla tissue homogenates were obtained by homogenizing ∼2 mg of papillary tissue/kidney in a 15-fold excess of distilled water, and the supernatant after centrifugation was assayed for urea and chloride. Urine osmolality was measured by freezing point osmometry (micro-osmometer, Precision Systems Inc.). Urine and plasma chemistries were measured by the University of California San Francisco Clinical Chemistry Laboratory. Results obtained in null mice were compared with those of wild-type mice by Student's t test. When three groups were compared, one-way ANOVA was performed followed by Fischer posthoc test. One-way ANOVA with repeated measures was used to compare mice of the two genotypes in the dehydration study. p< 0.05 was considered statistically significant. A cDNA clone with homology to rat UT-B was isolated from C57/bl6 mouse kidney. The open reading frame of 1152 bp (GenBankTM accession number AF448798) encodes a 384- amino acid protein with 10 putative hydrophobic transmembrane domains. The deduced amino acid sequence is 85 and 94% identical to human and rat UT-B, respectively (Fig.1 A). Northern blot analysis revealed transcripts of 3.8 and 2.0 kb in brain, spleen, kidney, ureter, and urinary bladder (Fig. 1 B). Functional analysis in Xenopus oocytes expressing mouse UT-B cRNA indicated efficient urea-transport and weak water-transport activity (Fig.1 C) in agreement with results for rat UT-B (21Yang B. Verkman A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9369-9372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Also, as found previously, urea and water transport in oocytes expressing mouse UT-B was inhibited by phloretin. Sequence comparison of mouse UT-B cDNA with a cloned 17-kb genomic DNA indicated 7 introns (lengths 0.4, 1.8, 2.3, 1.5, 0.4, 5.5, and 2.5 kb) (Fig. 2 A, top) separating eight exons with boundaries at residues 46, 109, 152, 217, 266, 311, and 332 in the deduced mouse UT-B amino acid sequence, identical to the boundary residues of the human UT-Bgene (25Lucien N. Sidoux-Walter F. Olives B. Moulds J. Le Pennec P.Y. Cartron J.P. Bailly P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12973-12980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). All boundaries correspond to the GT-AG rule. Genomic Southern blot analysis with EcoRI, SpeI, andKpnI-digested mouse genomic DNA indicated a single copyUT-B gene/haploid mouse genome (data not shown). UT-B knockout mice were generated by the gene-targeting strategy shown in Fig. 2 A. Heterozygous founder mice containing the disrupted UT-B gene were bred to produce wild-type, heterozygous, and UT-B null mice. Genomic Southern blot analysis of mouse liver genomic DNA digested with SpeI (probed as indicated in Fig. 2 A) showed the predicted 4.3-kb fragment in wild-type mice, 3.7-kb fragment in UT-B knockout mice, and both fragments in heterozygous mice (Fig. 2 B). Fig. 2 Cshows only truncated UT-B transcripts in the kidney of knockout mice. Immunoblot analysis revealed UT-B protein in erythrocytes of wild-type but not in the UT-B null mice (Fig. 2 D). Immunohistochemistry of kidney showed UT-B protein expression in medullary vasa recta of wild-type mice with no staining in UT-B null mice (Fig. 2 E). Genotype analysis of offspring from breeding of UT-B heterozygous mice indicated a nearly 1:2:1 Mendelian distribution (54 wild-type, 113 heterozygous, and 41 null mice). An analysis of growth by mouse weight (age 1–12 weeks) showed no differences among the genotypes. The UT-B null mice had grossly normal appearance, activity, and behavior. Plasma sodium, potassium, chloride, bicarbonate, and creatinine concentrations were similar in both groups as was hematocrit (48.3 ± 0.4% in wild-type and 49.2 ± 0.5% in UT-B null mice). Urea and water permeabilities in erythrocytes were measured by stopped-flow light scattering. Urea permeability was measured from the time course of cell swelling in response to a 250 mminwardly directed urea gradient. There was an initial rapid decrease in cell volume because of osmotically induced water efflux followed by slower cell swelling, which was the result of urea and secondary water influx. At 10 °C, urea equilibrated across erythrocytes from wild-type mice with a half-time of ∼27 s, giving a permeability coefficient (P urea) of 1.1 × 10−6 cm/s (Fig.3 A, top curve). Urea permeability was inhibited by 96% by 0.7 mm phloretin (Fig. 3 A, bottom curve). Fig. 3 A,middle curves, shows urea permeability in erythrocytes from heterozygous and UT-B null mice. Urea permeability in the erythrocytes from null mice was 45-fold lower than that from wild-type mice. Fig.3 B shows the time course of osmotic cell shrinking in response to a 250 mm inwardly directed osmotic gradient of sucrose. The data from a series of mice showed that UT-B deletion did not significantly reduce erythrocyte osmotic water permeability (P f = 0.018 ± 0.0.02 cm/s for wild-type mice; 0.017 ± 0.002 cm/s for UT-B null mice). Urinary concentrating function was compared in the wild-type, heterozygous, and UT-B null mice. Fig.4 A shows daily fluid consumption and urinary output. The UT-B null mice were moderately polyuric, consuming and excreting approximately 50% more fluid than litter-matched heterozygous and wild-type mice. The difference in fluid intake and urinary output, primarily representing insensible respiratory losses, was similar in all groups. The average urine osmolality in UT-B null mice (1532 ± 71 mosm/kg H2O) was significantly lower than that in wild-type mice (2056 ± 83 mosm/kg H2O, Fig.4 B). Urinary concentrating ability was measured in response to a 24 h water deprivation. Urine osmolality in the UT-B null mice increased significantly, although to a significantly lesser extent than in wild-type mice (p < 0.02). Body weight loss during this test was similar in both groups (20.1 ± 1.2% wild-type mice; 21.7 ± 0.8% null mice). Osmolality and urea concentration were measured in plasma and urine of six wild-type and six UT-B null mice under basal conditions (food intake was equal in the two groups). Plasma osmolality was slightly but not significantly higher in UT-B null mice than in wild-type mice (330 ± 4 versus 324 ± 4 mosm/kgH2O). The urine-to-plasma ratio for osmolality, an index of overall concentrating capacity of the kidney, was lower by one-third in UT-B null mice compared with wild-type mice (4.0 ± 0.2 versus 6.1 ± 0.4, p< 0.001). As shown in Fig.5 A, plasma urea concentration was significantly higher, and urinary urea concentration was significantly lower in the UT-B-deficient mice. These opposing changes suggest that plasma urea increased because the kidney was less able to recycle urea and concentrate urea in the urine. The urine-to-plasma ratio of urea concentration reflects the capacity of the kidney to concentrate urea above its level in body fluids. This ratio was markedly decreased in UT-B null mice from 124 ± 9 to 61 ± 5 (Fig. 5 A). Fig. 5 B shows the composition of the aqueous component of the inner medulla as measured on the supernatants of centrifuged homogenates of inner medullas. The significantly reduced inner medullary osmolality primarily was because of a reduction in inner medulla urea concentration. The cDNA encoding mouse UT-B had 94% amino acid identity to a rat homolog (rUT-B) cloned previously (18Tsukaguchi H. Shayakul C. Berger U.V. Tokui T. Brown D. Hediger M.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 1506-1515Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Mouse UT-B and rUT-B transcript expression differed in a few respects. Northern blot analysis revealed mouse UT-B transcripts with two sizes (3.8 and 2.0 kb) in brain, spleen, kidney, ureter, and urinary bladder, whereas a single mRNA band was found for rUT-B. The UT-B transcript was identified in rat testis (18Tsukaguchi H. Shayakul C. Berger U.V. Tokui T. Brown D. Hediger M.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 1506-1515Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), but it was not seen in mouse testis. Transgenic null mice deficient in the UT-B were generated and characterized. The UT-B knockout mice expressed truncated UT-B transcript but lacked detectable UT-B protein by C-terminal antibody. Urea permeability in erythrocytes from null mice was 45-fold lower than that from wild-type mice, indicating that UT-B was functionally deleted. We found previously that rat UT-B transported some water along with urea when heterologously expressed in Xenopus oocytes (21Yang B. Verkman A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9369-9372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Mouse UT-B also functioned as a weak water channel and an efficient urea transporter in Xenopus oocytes. The osmotic water permeability in UT-B-deficient erythrocytes was not reduced by UT-B deletion, however, the high AQP1-dependent water permeability in mouse erythrocyte precluded the detection of effects of UT-B deletion. The measurement of water permeability in erythrocytes lacking UT-B and AQP1 together, when available, should be informative in this regard. UT-B null mice exhibited normal growth and no overt abnormalities in their main biological functions, behavior, and sensory activity. The sex and genotype ratios were normally distributed, suggesting no influence of UT-B gene deletion on survival or sexual differentiation. As expected, the major phenotypic abnormality was in renal water and urea handling. Fluid intake and urine output were approximately 50% higher, and urine osmolality was approximately one-third lower in null mice than in wild-type mice. Despite this difference in fluid turnover, the concentrations of the major plasma solutes were unaltered. The very low urea permeability in red cells did not influence the hematocrit. Urea is an important contributor to the urinary concentrating mechanism (1Bankir L. Trinh-Trang-Tan M.M. Brenner B.M. The Kidney. 6th Ed. W. B. Saunders Co., Philadelphia, PA2000: 637-679Google Scholar, 2Masilamani S. Knepper M.A. Burg M.B. Brenner B.M. The Kidney. 6th Ed. W. B.

Interestingly, urea contributes mostly to its own concentration, because it is the most abundant solute in the urine, except in herbivores, and because its concentration in blood is much lower than that of the other main urinary constituents. In normal human urine, urea is concentrated approximately 45-fold above plasma, K+ (12-fold), and Na+ (0.65-fold). The kidney transforms large amounts of urea-poor plasma into a small volume of urea-rich urine. Thus, besides the overall urinary concentrating defect in UT-B null mice, we investigated the possibility of a selective defect in urea concentrating capacity by measurement of the urine-to-plasma urea concentration ratio and inner medulla composition. UT-B deficiency in kidney resulted in decreased urinary urea and increased plasma urea concentrations, producing a 2-fold decrease in the urine-to-plasma urea concentration ratio. UT-B deficiency also produced a >2-fold reduction in inner medullary urea concentration with little effect on inner medullary chloride (salt) concentration. Mechanistically, as depicted schematically in Fig. 5 C, these observations suggest that some of the urea delivered to the tip of the papilla by UT-A1/UT-A3/UT-A4 and carried up by the blood through venous ascending vasa rect is not recycled in UT-B-deficient arterial descending vasa recta and thus returned to the general circulation. In contrast to the remarkably reduced urea concentrating ability in the UT-B null mice, the defect in the concentration of all solutes as assessed by the urine-to-plasma osmolality ratio (lower by only one-third) was more modest, suggesting that UT-B plays a greater role in enabling the kidney to concentrate urea than other solutes in the urine. The selective reduction in inner medullary urea concentration supports this conclusion. A natural model of UT-B gene deletion occurs in rare human subjects lacking the Kidd blood group J Kantigens, J K (a−,b−) (30Frohlich O. Macey R.I. Edwards-Moulds J. Gargus J.J. Gunn R.B. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 260: C778-C783Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Erythrocytes in these subjects have low urea permeability, and it is assumed that they also lack UT-B protein in vasa recta. In two such subjects, Sandset al. (31Sands J.M. Gargus J.J. Fröhlich O. Gunn R.B. Kokko J.P. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1992; 2: 1689-1696Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) found a normal blood urea nitrogen and a modest ∼20% decline in maximum urinary concentrating ability after dehydration and vasopressin infusion (790 mosm/kg H2O versus ∼980 mosm/kg H2O in healthy subjects). The concentrating defect observed in mice in this study is substantially larger than that in humans. Blood urea concentration was elevated, and maximum urinary concentration after water deprivation decreased by 35%. This difference may be accounted for by the difference in overall concentrating ability of the two species partly because of the differences in kidney architecture and development of the renal medulla. The urinary concentrating capacity in different mammalian species is influenced by several factors, including the relative length of the papilla (much longer in mice than in humans) and the anatomy of the vascular bundles in the outer medulla (32Kriz W. Am. J. Physiol. 1981; 241: R3-R16Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33Bankir L. deRouffignac C. Am. J. Physiol. 1985; 249: R643-R666PubMed Google Scholar). The human kidney has a relatively simple architecture and modest concentrating ability, whereas mice have a more complex vascular architecture and greater concentrating ability. In conclusion, the UT-B null mice manifest a unique defect in urinary concentrating capacity of the kidney affecting the ability to concentrate urea preferentially over other urinary solutes. The impaired urea recycling in the medullary vasculature results in increased blood urea concentration and decreased urine urea concentration, producing an ∼50% reduction in urea concentrating capacity. As reported in rat (18Tsukaguchi H. Shayakul C. Berger U.V. Tokui T. Brown D. Hediger M.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 1506-1515Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 19Couriaud C. Ripoche P.

The UT-B null mice will allow studies to elucidate the role of facilitated urea transport in these extrarenal organs. We thank Liman Qian for breeding mice."
https://openalex.org/W2058771802,"Recent studies have demonstrated that CD47 plays an important role in regulating human neutrophil (PMN) chemotaxis. Two ligands for CD47, thrombospondin and SIRPα, have been described. However, it is not known if SIRP-CD47 interactions play a role in regulating PMN migration. In this study, we show that SIRPα1 directly binds to the immunoglobulin variable domain loop of purified human CD47 and that such SIRP-CD47 interactions regulate PMN transmigration. Specifically, PMN migration across both human epithelial monolayers and collagen-coated filters was partially inhibited by anti-SIRP monoclonal antibodies. Similar kinetics of inhibition were observed for PMN transmigration in the presence of soluble, recombinant CD47 consisting of the SIRP-binding loop. In contrast, anti-CD47 monoclonal antibodies inhibited PMN transmigration by markedly different kinetics. Results of signal transduction experiments suggested differential regulation of PMN migration by SIRPversus CD47 by phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and tyrosine kinases, respectively. Immunoprecipitation followed by Western blotting after SDS-PAGE under nonreducing conditions suggested that several SIRP protein species may be present in PMN. Stimulation of PMN with fMLP resulted in increased surface expression of these SIRP proteins, consistent with the existence of intracellular pools. Taken together, these results demonstrate that PMN migration is regulated by CD47 through SIRPα-dependent and SIRPα-independent mechanisms. Recent studies have demonstrated that CD47 plays an important role in regulating human neutrophil (PMN) chemotaxis. Two ligands for CD47, thrombospondin and SIRPα, have been described. However, it is not known if SIRP-CD47 interactions play a role in regulating PMN migration. In this study, we show that SIRPα1 directly binds to the immunoglobulin variable domain loop of purified human CD47 and that such SIRP-CD47 interactions regulate PMN transmigration. Specifically, PMN migration across both human epithelial monolayers and collagen-coated filters was partially inhibited by anti-SIRP monoclonal antibodies. Similar kinetics of inhibition were observed for PMN transmigration in the presence of soluble, recombinant CD47 consisting of the SIRP-binding loop. In contrast, anti-CD47 monoclonal antibodies inhibited PMN transmigration by markedly different kinetics.

The precise mechanism of CD47-mediated regulation of PMN migration is not known.

Most recently, CD47 has been reported to bind to signal regulatory protein (SIRP) in rodents (19Jiang P. Lagenaur C.F. Narayanan V. J. Biol.

Blood. 1999; 94: 3633-3643Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Results of these studies have suggested that the interaction between CD47 and SIRPα may play a role in diverse processes such as macrophage multinucleation, self-recognition of red blood cells, and sickle cell clearance, etc. (21Babic I.

J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22719-22728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). However, within these tissues, SIRPs are only selectively expressed in certain cell types (25Adams S. van der Laan L.J. Vernon-Wilson E. Renardel de Lavalette C. Dopp E.A. Dijkstra C.D. Simmons D.L. van den Berg T.K. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 1853-1859PubMed Google Scholar). In mice, SIRPs (termed SHPS-1) are richly expressed in hematopoietic cells including macrophages and myeloid cells, but not in T and B cells (24Veillette A. Thibaudeau E. Latour S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22719-22728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). In humans, SIRPs are expressed in monocytes, granulocytes, dendritic cells, and CD34+CD38−CD133+ bone marrow stem/progenitor cells but not in lymphocytes (20Seiffert M. Cant C. Chen Z. Rappold I.

Buhring H.J. Blood. 2001; 97: 2741-2749Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Through cDNA library screening, multiple homologous sequences that account for at least 15 additional SIRP members have been reported (27Kharitonenkov A. Chen Z. Sures I. Wang H. Schilling J. Ullrich A. Nature. 1997; 386: 181-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar). Primary structural analysis indicate that all SIRPs share common structural motifs including a single transmembrane segment and an N-terminal extracellular domain that contains three Ig-like loops connected by three pairs of disulfide bonds. The C-terminal intracellular domain structurally separates two subfamilies of SIRPs, termed SIRPα and SIRPβ (27Kharitonenkov A. Chen Z. Sures I. Wang H. Schilling J. Ullrich A. Nature. 1997; 386: 181-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar). SIRPα has a long intracellular domain containing four tyrosine residues that form two immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs, whereas SIRPβ contains a basic lysine residue followed by a short intracellular tail that serves as a receptor for DAP12, a protein with an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (27Kharitonenkov A. Chen Z. Sures I. Wang H. Schilling J. Ullrich A. Nature. 1997; 386: 181-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar, 28Dietrich J. Cella M. Seiffert M. Buhring H.J. Colonna M. J. Immunology. 2000; 164: 9-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Similar to other immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif domain-containing proteins such as CD3, T cell receptor ξ, FcRγ, and B cell receptor (29Tomasello E. Blery M. Vely E. Vivier E. Semin. Immunol. 2000; 12: 139-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 30Vivier E. Daeron M. Immunol. Today. 1997; 18: 286-291Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar), SIRPα has been shown to play an important role in regulating cellular responses to a wide variety of different stimuli. For example, treatment of tissue-cultured cells with growth factors (including platelet-derived growth factor and epidermal growth factor), growth hormone, insulin, colony-stimulating factor, lysophosphatidic acid, etc., has been shown to induce phosphorylation of tyrosines on the intracellular immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif domain of SIRPα, resulting in binding to Src homology 2 domain-containing tyrosine phosphatase-1 or 2 (SHP-1 and 2) (24Veillette A.

The recent reports of CD47 binding to SIRPα prompted us to examine the role of SIRP in CD47-mediated regulation of PMN transmigration. In this report, we confirm that human CD47 binds specifically to SIRPα and find that SIRPα-CD47 interactions partially inhibit fMLP-driven PMN chemotaxis, but with kinetics that are markedly different from the inhibition observed with anti-CD47 mAbs. Furthermore, our results suggest that SIRP and CD47 regulate PMN migration through different intracellular signaling pathways. Finally, we report that several protein bands reactive with SIRP antibodies under nonreducing conditions are present in PMN and can be up-regulated to the cell surface after chemotactic stimulation. The significance of these findings is discussed in the context of PMN migration during the acute inflammatory response. Monoclonal antibodies against human SIRP including P3C4, SE5A5, SE7C2, SE8A3, SE12B6, and SE12C3 were raised as previously described (20Seiffert M. Cant C. Chen Z. Rappold I. Brugger W. Kanz L. Brown E.J. Ullrich A. Buhring H.J. Blood. 1999; 94: 3633-3643Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A Western blotting polyclonal rabbit antibody raised against the extracellular domain of SIRPα (SIRPα1 Ex) was kindly provided by Dr. Axel Ullrich (27Kharitonenkov A. Chen Z. Sures I. Wang H. Schilling J. Ullrich A. Nature. 1997; 386: 181-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar). Monoclonal antibodies against human CD47 used in this study were C5D5, B6H12.2, PF10.4, PF2.1, and PF3.1 (10Liu Y. Merlin D. Burst S.L. Pochet M. Madara J.L. Parkos C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40156-40166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). A polyclonal anti-CD47 antibody R12989 was raised by immunizing rabbits with a synthetic peptide SNQKTIQPPRNN corresponding to a region of the putative C terminus of CD47 as previously described (10Liu Y.

As a positive inhibitory control, mAb CBRM1/29, reactive with the β2 integrin CD11b was used (34Balsam L.B. Liang T.W. Parkos C.A. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 5058-5065PubMed Google Scholar), and anti-junction adhesion molecule (JAM) mAbs J3F.1 or J10.4 were used as the noninhibitory controls (35Liu Y. Nusrat A. Schnell F.J. Reaves T.A. Walsh S. Pochet M. Parkos C.A. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 2363-2374Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Culture and maintenance of T84 human intestinal epithelial cells (passages 50–90) were as described previously (36Parkos C.A. Delp C. Arnaout M.A. Madara J.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 88: 1605-1612Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Briefly, T84 cells were grown in a 1:1 mixture of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 15 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.5, 14 mmNaHCO3, 40 μg/ml penicillin, 8 μg/ml ampicillin, 90 μg/ml streptomycin, and 5% newborn calf serum. For transmigration experiments, T84 cells were grown on collagen-coated, permeable polycarbonate filters (inserts) with a surface area of 0.33 cm2 and pore size of 5 μm (Costar, Cambridge, MA) as previously described (11Parkos C.A. Colgan S.P. Liang T.W. Nusrat A. Bacarra A.E. Carnes D.K. Madara J.L. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 437-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Neutrophils (PMN) were isolated from whole blood of normal human volunteers by Dextran sedimentation followed by Ficoll-Hypaque separation as previously described (37Brumell J.H. Chan C.K. Butler J. Borregaard N. Siminovitch K.A. Grinstein S. Downey G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 875-882Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Residual RBC were lysed with isotonic NH4Cl. Isolated PMN were resuspended in Hanks' balanced salt solution devoid of calcium or magnesium (HBSS(−)) (4 °C) at a concentration of 5 × 107 cells/ml and were used within 4 h. Human CD47 was purified from human RBC, PMN, spleen, and HT-29 intestinal epithelial cells as previously described (11Parkos C.A. Colgan S.P. Liang T.W. Nusrat A. Bacarra A.E. Carnes D.K. Madara J.L. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 437-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Briefly, suspensions of RBC (from 120 ml of blood), PMN (∼1010), and HT-29 (∼5 × 109) cells were directly lysed in buffer (1% Triton X-100, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm each of CaCl2 and MgCl2 in 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH7.5) containing a mixture of protease inhibitors. Human spleen (30 g) obtained from autopsy material was homogenized by Dounce homogenizer (20 strokes) in the same lysis buffer. After low speed (1000 × g) and high speed (100,000 × g) centrifugation, supernatants were subjected to immunoaffinity chromatography using anti-CD47 mAb C5D5 or PF3.1 conjugated to Sepharose (2 mg of IgG/ml as described by the manufacturer (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.)). After washing with lysis buffer, CD47 was eluted with 50 mmtriethylamine, 1% octyl glucoside, 100 mm NaCl, pH 10.5, followed by neutralization, and concentration. For control membrane protein purifications, a similar protocol was used to immunoaffinity-purify human JAM from platelets using mAb J10.4-conjugated Sepharose and CD11b/CD18 from PMN using mAb LM2/1-conjugated Sepharose (11Parkos C.A.

Fusion proteins consisting of the extracellular domains of SIRPα1 and SIRPβ1 fused to GST were produced after transfection of constructs into 293E cells and purified as previously described (20Seiffert M. Cant C. Chen Z. Rappold I. Brugger W. Kanz L. Brown E.J. Ullrich A. Buhring H.J. Blood. 1999; 94: 3633-3643Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A construct consisting of the extracellular domain of human CD47 fused to the catalytic domain of human placental AP was prepared as previously described (10Liu Y. Merlin D. Burst S.L. Pochet M.

Cell. 1994; 79: 157-168Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar) expression vector. Culture supernatant containing the recombinant protein was prepared by either transient transfection of COS-7 cells or by stable transfection of CHO-K1 cells. For the CHO-K1 transfections, the CD47-AP construct was subcloned from AP-tag2 into the tetracycline response element containing pTRE2 vector (CLONTECH). This plasmid was co-transfected into CHO-K1 cells with a plasmid (KnlstTA) consisting of a Tet-Off transactivator with a nuclear localization signal cloned into the pIRES1neo vector (CLONTECH). Clones were picked after G418 selection and assayed for AP activity. Clones with the highest expression were used for production of recombinant protein. Expressed CD47-AP fusion protein in medium was affinity-purified using PF3.1-Sepharose and eluted with 50 mm triethylamine, pH 10.5, 150 mm NaCl followed by neutralization, concentration, and dialysis. A second AP fusion protein containing the extracellular domain of JAM was produced and purified by similar methods (10Liu Y. Merlin D. Burst S.L. Pochet M. Madara J.L. Parkos C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40156-40166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). 96-well microtiter plates were coated with SIRP-GST fusion protein for 2 h at room temperature (5 μg/ml). After blocking nonspecific binding with 1% BSA (in HBSS), monoclonal anti-SIRP antibodies were added at 10 μg/ml, followed by incubation at room temperature for 30 min. After washing, the wells were incubated with peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary and developed with the substrate ABTS. To assay CD47 binding to SIRP-GST, purified human CD47 (10–100 μg/ml in buffer containing 1% octyl glucoside) was diluted 50-fold in HBSS in microtiter wells (50 μl) and allowed to bind for 2 h (room temperature). After blocking with BSA, the wells were incubated with SIRP-GST for 1 h. After washing, bound SIRP was assayed by incubation with goat anti-GST (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) followed by peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-goat secondary. CD47 extracellular domain binding to SIRP was assayed by incubation SIRP-GST-coated wells with CD47-AP fusion protein (2–10 μg/ml) for 30 min (room temperature), and binding was detected by alkaline phosphatase activity. Controls included microtiter wells coated with BSA only or with similar concentrations of immunopurified human CD11b/CD18 or JAM in the same buffers. PMN transepithelial migration experiments were performed in the basolateral to apical direction using T84 intestinal epithelial cell monolayers as previously described (10Liu Y. Merlin D. Burst S.L.

PMN (1 × 106) in 150 μl of HBSS with or without antibody were added to the upper chamber of the monolayer setup. Transmigration was initiated by transferring of PMN-containing monolayers to 24-well tissue culture plates containing 1 ml of 1 μm fMLP in HBSS followed by incubation at 37 °C. PMN migration across monolayers into the fMLP-containing lower chambers was quantified by myeloperoxidase assay as previously described (11Parkos C.A. Colgan S.P. Liang T.W. Nusrat A. Bacarra A.E. Carnes D.K. Madara J.L. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 437-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). PMN migration across acellular, collagen-coated filters was performed as described previously (10Liu Y. Merlin D. Burst S.L. Pochet M. Madara J.L. Parkos C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40156-40166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). PMN cell surface SIRP and CD47 expression was assessed by labeling nonpermeabilized PMN (5 × 106 cells) with anti-SIRP and anti-CD47 mAbs (20 μg/ml each) for 1 h at 4 °C in HBSS(−) after blocking nonspecific binding with 0.5% BSA. After washing, PMN were incubated with FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody (1:200 dilution in HBSS(−) (PharMingen) for 30 min at 4 °C before flow cytometric analysis. CD47 labeling in this condition (HBSS(−)) was compared with that obtained with isotype-matched, control IgG. PMN (1.5 × 107/ml) in suspension or adherent to plastic Petri dishes were stimulated with fMLP, followed by cell surface labeling with 0.5 mg of sulfo-NHS-biotin (Pierce) in 1 ml of HBSS/1.5 × 107 neutrophils as previously described (10Liu Y.

Labeled cells were then solubilized with lysis buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 2 mmCaCl2, 2 mm Mg Cl2, 1% Triton X-100, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm PMSF, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin. Cell lysates (100–200 μg of total protein) were precleared with IgG-Sepharose before incubation with 2 μg anti-SIRP or anti-CD47 mAbs for 4 h at 4 °C. Immunocomplexes were precipitated using Protein A/G-Sepharose followed by washing and nonreducing SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose, and biotin-labeled cell surface proteins were detected with streptavidin-peroxidase followed by ECL. Total cellular SIRPα proteins were detected using a polyclonal rabbit anti-SIRPα antibody (SIRPα1-Ex, 1:500), and CD47 was detected by immunoblot with R12989 or mAb PF3.1, followed by detection with appropriate peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody and ECL. In a previous report, human leukocytes were shown to adhere to SIRPα-GST-coated surfaces via CD47-mediated events (20Seiffert M. Cant C. Chen Z. Rappold I. Brugger W. Kanz L. Brown E.J. Ullrich A. Buhring H.J. Blood. 1999; 94: 3633-3643Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We confirmed that CD47 binds directly to SIRPα1 extracellular domain by in vitro assays using purified CD47. Native CD47 was affinity-purified from human PMN, RBC, spleen, and intestinal epithelial cells (HT-29). SDS-PAGE analysis of the CD47 purified from PMN is shown in the inset of Fig.1 A, demonstrating characteristic broad protein staining bands between 45 and 65 kDa. CD47 purified from RBC, spleen, and intestinal epithelium had the same characteristics (data not shown). Additional higher molecular mass bands represent oligomers of CD47 as previously described (39Brown E. Hooper L. Ho T. Gresham H. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 2785-2794Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar) that was confirmed by reactivity with CD47 mAbs (Fig. 1 A). Microtiter wells were coated with purified CD47 followed by the addition of SIRPα1-GST. Binding of SIRPα1-GST was detected by a goat anti-GST antibody. To test the binding specificity of SIRPα1, parallel experiments were performed using SIRPβ1-GST. As shown in Fig. 1 A, SIRPα1-GST but not SIRPβ1-GST bound to CD47 purified from all different tissues, even though these two SIRP members are highly homologous in their extracellular domains (27Kharitonenkov A. Chen Z. Sures I. Wang H. Schilling J. Ullrich A. Nature. 1997; 386: 181-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar). These results confirm those of others (20Seiffert M. Cant C. Chen Z. Rappold I. Brugger W. Kanz L. Brown E.J. Ullrich A. Buhring H.J. Blood. 1999; 94: 3633-3643Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and demonstrate that the extracellular domain of SIRPα1 binds directly to CD47. To confirm the binding specificity, additional experiments were performed. As shown in Fig. 1 B, no binding was observed between SIRPα1-GST and two other transmembrane Ig superfamily members JAM and CD11b/CD18. The specificity of SIRPα binding to purified CD47 is further demonstrated in Fig. 1 C. In this panel, the effects of some of our anti-SIRP and anti-CD47 mAbs on SIRPα binding to CD47 purified from PMN are shown. As can be seen, SIRP mAbs SE5A5 and SE7C2 and CD47 mAb C5D5 markedly inhibited recombinant SIRPα binding to CD47. In contrast, SIRP mAb P3C4 had little, if any, inhibitory effect. A summary of the binding and inhibitory properties of a large panel of anti-SIRP and anti-CD47 mAbs can be found in TableI. Anti-SIRP mAbs SE5A5, SE7C2, and SE12C3, which were previously shown to inhibit CD47 expressing Jurkat cell adherence to SIRPα1-GST (20Seiffert M. Cant C. Chen Z. Rappold I. Brugger W. Kanz L. Brown E.J. Ullrich A. Buhring H.J. Blood. 1999; 94: 3633-3643Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), directly inhibited binding of SIRPα1 to purified CD47. In contrast, mAbs P3C4, SE8A3, and SE12B6 either failed or only slightly inhibited this binding (10–20%). As also indicated in Table I, functionally inhibitory anti-CD47 antibodies including C5D5, B6H12.6, PF10.4, PF3.1, and PF2.1 (10Liu Y. Merlin D. Burst S.L. Pochet M. Madara J.L. Parkos C.A. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W2056252656,"Abstract The human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum synthesizes fatty acids using a type II pathway that is absent in humans. The final step in fatty acid elongation is catalyzed by enoyl acyl carrier protein reductase, a validated antimicrobial drug target. Here, we report the cloning and expression of the P. falciparum enoyl acyl carrier protein reductase gene, which encodes a 50-kDa protein (PfENR) predicted to target to the unique parasite apicoplast. Purified PfENR was crystallized, and its structure resolved as a binary complex with NADH, a ternary complex with triclosan and NAD+, and as ternary complexes bound to the triclosan analogs 1 and 2 with NADH. Novel structural features were identified in the PfENR binding loop region that most closely resembled bacterial homologs; elsewhere the protein was similar to ENR from the plant Brassica napus (root mean square for Cαs, 0.30 A). Triclosan and its analogs 1 and 2 killed multidrug-resistant strains of intra-erythrocytic P. falciparum parasites at sub to low micromolar concentrations in vitro. These data define the structural basis of triclosan binding to PfENR and will facilitate structure-based optimization of PfENR inhibitors."

To examine the mode of activation of ADAMTS4, a human chondrosarcoma cell line, JJ012, has been stably transfected with the full-length c-DNA for human ADAMTS4. The cells synthesized a high molecular weight form of the enzyme (p100), which in serum-free culture was processed to three truncated forms, p75, p60, and p50. Treatment of the p100 form with recombinant furin indicated that the p75 form is generated by the removal of the prodomain by a furin-like activity. Analysis with domain-specific antisera showed that the p60 and p50 forms are generated by C-terminal truncation of the p75 form. The appearance of the p60 and p50 forms in culture medium was prevented by inclusion of a furin inhibitor, inhibitors of glycosylphosphatidylinositol synthesis, glucosamine, a hydroxamate-based matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) inhibitor, and TIMP-1, but not by AEBSF (4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride) or E64. Only medium samples containing the p60/p50 forms exhibited aggrecanase activity, and isolation of the p75, p60, and p50 forms by preparative SDS-PAGE showed that only p60 and p50 were active in aggrecanase and versicanase assays. Pig synovium and human cartilages also contained ADAMTS4 in the p75, p60, and p50 forms. We suggest that in vivo production of proteolytically active ADAMTS4 requires not only removal of the prodomain by a furin-like activity but also MMP-mediated removal of a portion of the C-terminal spacer domain.

They are all members of the family of large aggregating proteoglycans (1.Hardingham T.E. Ewins R.J. Muir H. Biochem. J. 1976; 157: 127-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), which are characterized by an N-terminal globular domain that binds to hyaluronan. They have therefore been included, along with related species such as link protein and CD44, in the molecular grouping termed hyaladherins (2.Toole B.P. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1990; 2: 839-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). At the same time they are all synthesized with a C-terminal globular domain that is related structurally to selectins, consisting of a C-type lectin domain flanked by epidermal growth factor and complement regulatory protein domains. Because of this structural feature they have also been given the family name of lecticans (3.Yamaguchi Y. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2000; 57: 276-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). In an attempt to accommodate the functionality of both the N-terminal and C-terminal globular domains, and also to indicate their proteoglycan nature, the group has also been termed the hyalectans (4.Iozzo R.V. Murdoch A.D. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 598-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar). extracellular matrix matrix metalloproteinase 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium glycosylphosphatidylinositol Proteolytic degradation of the hyalectans in the ECM appears to result from the activity of a subgroup of the ADAMTS family of metalloproteinases, all of which exhibit some degree of glutamyl-endopeptidase activity for specific Glu-X bonds (where X is most often Ala or Gly) in these glycosaminoglycan-substituted substrates. Thus, ADAMTS1, -4, and -5 exhibit “aggrecanase” activity (5.Kuno K. Okadab Y. Kawashimac H. Nakamurab H. Miyasakac M. Ohnoa H. Matsushimad K.

Among this group, ADAMTS4 appears to exhibit the highest level of activity for each substrate, and we propose here the term “hyalectanase” to describe this activity. Consistent with their common substrate specificity, ADAMTS1, -4, and -5 exhibit quite a high degree of sequence homology and in this regard are quite distinct from a second subgroup, ADAMTS2, -3, and -14, all of which are procollagen N-proteinases. Although 14 members of the ADAMTS family have now been cloned, and some have been expressed and purified, there has been no information generated on the mode of activation of these proteinases. Active ADAMTS4 (aggrecanase-1) was initially purified as a 62-kDa doublet protein from bovine nasal cartilage explants (10.Arner E.C. Pratta M.A. Trzaskos J.M. Decicco C.P. Tortorella M.D. J. Biol.

Expression of an inactive mutant lacking the TSP-1 motif and the identification of substrate binding activity within the TSP-1 region at GGWGPWGPWGD (residues 521–532) (11.Tortorella M. Pratta M.

However, the precise C terminus of the active 62–64 kDa proteinase was not determined (6.Tortorella M.D. Burn T.C. Pratta M.A. Abbaszade I. Hollis J.M. Liu R. Rosenfeld S.A. Copeland R.A.

Arner E.C. et al.Science. 1999; 284: 1664-1666Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar), and so the extent to which the Cys-rich domain (residues 548–694) and the C-terminal spacer (residues 695–837) modulate the proteolytic activity of the proteinase is unknown. In this regard it is interesting to note that the C-terminal hemopexin-like domain of the matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) family modulates both the proteolytic activity and inhibitor binding properties of these proteinases (12.Murphy G. Knauper V. Matrix Biol. 1997; 15: 511-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). To investigate the potential role of the C-terminal Cys-rich and spacer domains of ADAMTS4, we have established a stably transfected human chondrosarcoma cell system, which in serum-free culture processes recombinant ADAMTS4 to generate multiple forms. Structural analysis and activity assays for these forms has now shown that in addition to removal of the prodomain by a furin-like activity, C-terminal processing within the spacer domain is required to generate species that can degrade aggrecan and versican. Importantly, analysis of ADAMTS4 in extracts of cartilage and synovium has shown that these C-terminally truncated species are also the dominant forms of the enzyme in normal tissues. d(+)-Glucosamine,d-mannosamine, AEBSF, 2-deoxyfluoroglucose, E64, gelatin (porcine skin), and anti-FLAG (M2) were from Sigma.

To subclone the gene into pcDNA3 containing a C-terminal FLAG tag (DYKDDDDF), a PCR amplification strategy was used to amplify the ADAMTS4 gene containing the regions from the first Met codon to the last amino acid codon prior to the stop codon. The primers were designed to incorporate a KOZAK sequence and KpnI site at the 5 prime end of the gene (5′-CGGGTACCGCCGCCATGTCCCAGACAG-3′) and a XhoI site at the 3 prime end (5′-GCGCTCGAGTTTCCTGCCCGCC-3′) that would facilitate the ligation of the PCR product in frame with the FLAG tag sequence. The PCR product was digested and ligated into the XhoI/KpnI-digested pcDNA3/FLAG vector. Positive clones containing the ADAMTS4 gene were sequenced to verify that no spurious mutations were incorporated during the PCR amplification. Human chondrosarcoma JJ012 cells (13.Scully S.P. Berend K.R. Toth A. Qi W.N. Qi Z. Block J.A. Clin. Orthop. Relat. Res. 2000; 376: 291-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) were transfected with ADAMTS4 using GenePORTER transfection reagent (Gene Therapy Systems, San Diego) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, 3 μg of plasmid DNA in 500 μl of DMEM was mixed with 25 μl of GenePORTER reagent in 500 μl of DMEM followed by incubation for 30 min at room temperature. Exponentially growing cells (2 × 106 cells/well in a 6-well plate) were washed once with DMEM and incubated in 1 ml of the GenePORTER-plasmid DNA mixture at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% air. After 5 h, 1 ml of DMEM containing 20% fetal calf serum was added, and the cells were incubated for a further 43 h. Cells were selected with G-418 sulfate (Invitrogen) at a concentration of 800 μg/ml for 1 month. The stable ADAMTS4-transfected cell line was obtained by expansion from a single cell. Stably transfected JJ012 cells (about 1 × 106 cells) were cultured in 60-mm dishes in 3 ml of standard growth medium ((12800 DMEM powder (Invitrogen) dissolved in bottled water (Invitrogen) and supplemented with sodium bicarbonate (3.7 g/liter), ascorbic acid (50 mg/liter), gentamycin (50 mg/ liter), and 10% fetal calf serum (HyClone)). At about 80% confluence, the growth medium was removed, and the cells (about 7 × 106 cells) were washed twice with catabolic medium (23800 DMEM powder (Invitrogen) dissolved in bottled water (Invitrogen) and supplemented with sodium bicarbonate (3.7 g/liter), sodium pyruvate (110 mg/liter), pyridoxine. HCl (4 mg/liter), gentamycin (50 mg/liter)) and then maintained in 3 ml of this medium alone or in the presence of specific metabolic and proteinase inhibitors. Serum-free conditioned medium from JJ012 cells was collected and clarified by centrifugation at 14,000 ×g for 15 min at 4 °C. The medium was concentrated 10-fold by freezing lyophilization and stored at −80 °C. Cells were removed from the dish in cold phosphate-buffered saline by gentle pipetting and shaking and then pelleted by centrifugation and immediately lysed in 40 μl of buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mmEDTA, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40). The cell lysates were centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was stored at −80 °C. ECM, which remained attached to the dish, was washed twice gently with cold phosphate-buffered saline to remove residual cells; then 1 ml of lysis buffer (as above) was added, and the ECM was solubilized in the buffer for storage at −80 °C. For preparation of crude aggrecanase from medium, transfected JJ012 cells were maintained under serum-free conditions for 3 days, and the medium (3 ml/7 × 106 cells) was concentrated 10-fold by lyophilization, desalted on Microcon YM3 filters, and exchanged into assay buffer. The aggrecanase activity of crude samples and purified recombinant ADAMTS4 was assayed by incubation (total volume 50 μl) at 37 °C with human articular cartilage aggrecan (10 μg or 10 pmol total or 200 nm assuming a molecular weight of 1 million for the aggrecan substrate) in assay buffer (20 mm Tris, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm CaCl2, pH 7.5); this was followed by deglycosylation of products with chondroitinase ABC, keratanase II, and endo-β-galactosidase as described previously (14.Sandy J.D. Flannery C.R. Neame P.J. Lohmander L.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 89: 1512-1516Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar) and quantitative Western analysis with anti-NITEGE and anti-G1 antisera as described (15.Sandy J.D. Verscharen C. Biochem. J. 2001; 358: 615-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 16.Sandy J.D. Thompson V. Verscharen C. Gamett D. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 367: 258-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). For enzyme quantitation, the amount of specific product formed (ng G1-NITEGE) was determined by integrated pixel density measurement of anti-G1 blots in the linear range as described previously in detail (17.Sandy J.D. Gamett D. Thompson V. Verscharen C. Biochem. J. 1998; 335: 59-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), and calculations were made relative to a standard curve generated with purified bovine G1 domain (50–500 ng). When time course assays were terminated at 1, 2, 4, 8, and 16 h, it was found that the rate of product formation was essentially linear for up to 4 h, and the initial reaction rate with 20 nm (60 ng or 1 pmol) purified recombinant ADAMTS4 was about 100 ng or 1.7 pmol of G1 formed/h, which corresponds to 1.7 pmol or 1.7 μg of aggrecan cleaved/h. Here we define 1 unit of aggrecanase activity as that amount required to cleave the Glu-373–Ala-374 bond in 1 μg or 1 pmol of human aggrecan in 1 h, so that the preparations of recombinant ADAMTS4 used in this study were found to have a specific activity of about 28 units/μg of protein. 200 μl of 10-fold concentrated conditioned medium (20 μl/lane) was fractionated on 6% SDS-PAGE Mini-gels (Bio-Rad) under nonreducing conditions. The position of the individual ADAMTS4 forms was determined by Western analysis of the outer lanes with anti-VMAH, and the gel was sliced appropriately into 2 mm × 5 cm “bands” with a razor blade. The individual gel slices were crushed and rocked in 200 μl of 20 mm Tris, 10 mm CaCl2, 100 mm NaCl, 2% Triton X-100, pH 7.5, at 4 °C for 20 h to elute the proteins for the purity check. Portions of the eluates were taken for Western analysis of ADAMTS4 with anti-VMAH. For determination of the activity of individual SDS-PAGE-separated species, the freshly prepared gel bands (about 5 cm × 2 mm) were washed in 2.5% Triton X-100 for 1 h at 4 °C to remove SDS, and after a brief water rinse the gels were added to 200 μl of assay buffer containing either rat chondrosarcoma aggrecan (500 nm) or the recombinant β-GAG domain of human versican as described previously (8.Sandy J.D.

After incubation at 37 °C for 20 h the gel was removed, and the digested aggrecan was deglycosylated as described previously (14.Sandy J.D. Flannery C.R. Neame P.J. Lohmander L.S. J. Clin.

VA-13 cells (American Type Culture Collection) were transfected stably with ADAMTS4 cDNA, essentially as described above for JJ012 cells, and were cultured in growth medium until the cells became 80% confluent. The cells were washed twice with serum-free medium and were maintained in the serum-free medium for 4 days. Both the medium and ECM were harvested using the same methods as for JJ012 cells. The medium was concentrated 10-fold and exchanged into 50 mm Tris, 10 mm CaCl2, and 100 mm NaCl using Microcon centrifugal filter devices (Microcon YM-10) (Millipore, Bedford, MA). Furin digestion was performed at 37 °C for 8 h by incubation of 30 μl of concentrated medium with 2 μg of recombinant human furin (Affinity Bioreagents, Golden, CO), and the product was analyzed by Western blotting using anti-VMAH antibody. Normal full-depth human tibial cartilage was supplied by Dr. Ada Cole of Rush University, Chicago, IL. Normal human femoral notch cartilage was supplied by Dr. Fred Nelson, San Diego Naval Base. Synovium was obtained from the hock joint of 12-week-old pigs and either extracted fresh or maintained (200 mg wet wt per ml) in catabolic medium for 4 days with daily medium changes. For Western analysis, conditioned medium was combined and concentrated 10-fold by lyophilization, and 10 μl was loaded to the gel. Cartilage (15 mg wet weight) and synovium (200 mg wet weight) were freeze-milled in a Biopulverizer (Biospec Products, Bartlesville, OK), the powder was extracted for 20 h at 4 °C in 3 volumes (μl/mg wet weight) of 50 mmTris, 100 mm NaCl, pH 7.0, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and 10 μl of clear supernatant was loaded on the gel. Near confluent 3-day cultures of human chondrosarcoma cells stably transfected with ADAMTS4 and the nontransfected controls were transferred to serum-free medium. After 1 day, the medium, ECM, and cell pellet fractions were prepared for Western analysis with anti-VMAH (Fig. 1, bottom panels). In contrast to the wild-type cells, which produced essentially undetectable ADAMTS-4 (lanes labeled with a −), the transfected cells (lanes labeled with a +) produced immunoreactive ADAMTS4, which was present as a p100 species (cells only), p75 species (in all fractions but highly enriched in the ECM), p60 species (mostly in the medium with traces in the ECM), and traces of a p50 species (ECM and medium). Quantitation from the standard curve shown at top (see figure legend for details) indicated that these cells produced a total (all species) of about 5 μg of enzyme protein/plate (about 7 × 106 cells at termination) over the 4-day culture period, the majority of which was present as the p75 form in the ECM. To examine the origin of the multiple species generated in this system, we next extended the period of serum-free culture and terminated plates at 1, 2, 3, and 4 days (Fig. 2). Analysis of cells, ECM, and medium showed the p100 form in the cells only and a time-dependent processing of the p75 form, which was partially depleted from the ECM over the 4 days and concomitantly enriched in the medium, along with increasing amounts of p60 and p50. Quantitation from the standard curve (Fig. 1) showed that the 4-day medium contained the p75, p60, and p50 forms at concentrations of about 350, 250, and 100 ng/ml, respectively. To analyze these forms further, we next probed portions of the 4-day medium with antisera to the catalytic domain (anti-VMAH), the Cys-rich region (anti-YNHR), and the FLAG tag on the C terminus of the expressed protein (see diagram in Fig. 3). Each species exhibited a characteristic reactivity pattern. The p100 species reacted weakly with anti-VMAH and quite strongly with anti-YNHR and anti-FLAG, whereas the p75 reacted strongly with all three antisera. The p60 reacted weakly with anti-YNHR, strongly with anti-VMAH, and not at all with anti-FLAG, whereas the p50 reacted weakly with anti-VMAH, strongly with anti-YNHR, and not at all with anti-FLAG. The reactivity pattern shown (Fig. 3) and the relative sizes of the species suggest a structural model in which the p100 represents the full-length protein (residues 1–837) and the p75 represents the form generated by removal of the prodomain (residues 213–837). The complete absence of anti-FLAG reactivity for p60 and p50 strongly suggests that they are both generated from p75 by truncation within the C-terminal spacer domain. Consistent with this model was the finding that an antiserum raised to the C-terminal of ADAMTS4 (anti-HRRA) reacted only with the p100 and p75 forms (data not shown). Although the reason for the variable reactivity of the p100/p60/p50 species with anti-YNHR and anti-VMAH is unknown, the clear specificity of both of these antisera for the antigenic peptide epitopes (see diagram in Fig. 3) was confirmed by showing that the reactivity on Western blot for all four species of ADAMTS4 was totally eliminated by preincubation of the antibody solutions (1:2000) in the presence of 10 μm peptide immunogen for 2 h at room temperature (data not shown). To examine the relationship between the p100 and the p75 species we used the medium of a human fibroblast line (VA-13), which we had stably transfected with ADAMTS4 and which was found to secrete the p100 form directly to the medium without processing. Incubation of medium with and without recombinant furin followed by Western analysis with anti-VMAH (Fig. 4) showed that furin digestion converted the p100 to the p75 form, consistent with the involvement of a furin-like activity in this conversion in vivo. To investigate the process of C-terminal truncation in cell culture, transfected JJ012 cells were grown to 80% confluence in growth medium and then switched to serum-free medium for 3 days with no addition (control) and in the presence of a range of compounds (10 μm2-deoxyfluoroglucose, 10 μm MMP inhibitor II, 5 mm glucosamine, 1.5 mm mannosamine, 1 μm decanoyl-RVKR chloromethylketone, 125 nmTIMP-1, 1 μm AEBSF, and 10 μm E64) with the potential to interfere with ADAMTS4 processing in this system. Decanoyl-RVKR chloromethylketone is a cell-penetrating furin inhibitor (18.Denault J.B. Claing A. D'Orleans-Juste P. Sawamura T. Kido T. Masaki T. Leduc R. FEBS Lett. 1995; 362: 276-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar); 2-deoxyfluoroglucose and mannosamine are potent metabolic inhibitors of glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor synthesis, which like glucosamine are known to block interleukin-1-induced aggrecanase activity (16.Sandy J.D. Thompson V. Verscharen C. Gamett D. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 367: 258-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar); MMP inhibitor II and TIMP-1 are effective inhibitors of extracellular MMP-dependent processing; AEBSF and E64 are broad spectrum inhibitors of serine and cysteine proteinases respectively, without the capacity to enter cells. The yield and distribution of the p100, p75, p60, and p50 forms of ADAMTS4 in each culture condition are shown in Fig. 5. Three different patterns were observed. In control cells (lane C) and in cells treated with either E64 (lane E) or AEBSF (lane A), the distribution was essentially identical, showing that the processing of ADAMTS4 in this system was not affected by broad spectrum inhibitors of serine or cysteine proteinases. In these cultures, all of the p100 originally in the cells appears to have been converted to the p75 form, which is found in the cells (top panel) and abundantly in the ECM (middle panel). In addition, a portion (perhaps 50%) of the p75 associated with the cells and ECM is released to the medium (bottom panel) as the p75 form (major), the p60 form (major), and a small amount of the p50 form. The simplest explanation of this process is that under control conditions the p100 (full-length) form is secreted in the p75 form and that this intermediate is processed in the ECM to the p60/50 forms, which are released to the medium. A small proportion of the unprocessed p100 was also released into the medium in all cultures. In a second pattern, exhibited by cells treated with TIMP-1 (lane T) or the hydroxamate-based MMP inhibitor (lane MMP), the relative abundance of the forms and their distribution at 3 days was quite different to control. There was a partial inhibition of conversion of the p100 to the p75 form, less p75 accumulated in the ECM, and essentially no p75 was released into the medium. In addi"
https://openalex.org/W2072751609,"Dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy is a progressive neurodegenerative disease caused by the expansion of a polyglutamine repeats within the Atrophin-1 protein. The in vivo function of Atrophin-1 is unknown. We have characterized a Drosophila gene encoding an Atrophin family protein. Analysis of mutant phenotypes indicates that Drosophila Atrophin is required in diverse developmental processes including early embryonic patterning. Drosophila Atrophin genetically interacts with the transcription repressor even-skipped and is required for its repressive function in vivo. Drosophila Atrophin directly binds to Even-skipped in vitro. Furthermore, both human Atrophin-1 and Drosophila Atrophin repress transcription in vivo when tethered to DNA, and poly-Q expansion in Atrophin-1 reduces this repressive activity. We propose that Atrophin proteins function as versatile transcriptional corepressors and discuss a model that deregulation of transcription may contribute to the pathogenesis of neurodegeneration."

To assess the structural basis for that difference, we determined the crystal structures of complexes comprised of the c-Myb or AMV v-Myb DNA-binding domain (DBD), the C/EBPβ DBD, and a promoter DNA fragment. Within the c-Myb complex, a DNA-bound C/EBPβ interacts with R2 of c-Myb bound to a different DNA fragment; point mutations in v-Myb R2 eliminate such interaction within the v-Myb complex. GST pull-down assays, luciferase trans-activation assays, and atomic force microscopy confirmed that the interaction of c-Myb and C/EBPβ observed in crystal mimics their long range interaction on the promoter, which is accompanied by intervening DNA looping."
https://openalex.org/W2047057336,"Recently it has been demonstrated that high density lipoprotein (HDL) binding to scavenger receptors, class B, type I (SR-BI) stimulates endothelial nitric-oxide synthase (eNOS) activity. In the present studies we used a Chinese hamster ovary cell system and a human microvascular endothelial cell line to confirm that HDL stimulates eNOS activity in a SR-BI-dependent manner. Importantly, we have extended these studies to examine the mechanism whereby HDL binding to SR-BI stimulates eNOS. eNOS can be stimulated by an increase in intracellular calcium, by phosphorylation by Akt kinase, or by an increase in intracellular ceramide. Calcium imagining studies and experiments with the calcium chelator, 1,2-bis(o-aminophenoxy)ethane-N, N, N′, N′-tetraacetic acid tetra(acetoxymethyl) ester demonstrated that HDL binding to SR-BI does not induce an increase in intracellular calcium. Antibodies specific for activated Akt kinase demonstrated that HDL binding to SR-BI does not induce Akt kinase activation. However, HDL binding to SR-BI caused a reversible increase in intracellular ceramide levels from 97 ± 14 pmol/mg of protein to 501 ± 21 pmol/mg of protein. In addition, C2-ceramide stimulated eNOS to the same extent as HDL, whereas C2-dihydroceramide did not stimulate eNOS. We conclude that HDL binding to SR-BI stimulates eNOS by increasing intracellular ceramide levels and is independent of an increase in intracellular calcium or Akt kinase phosphorylation.

HDL is generally considered to be cardioprotective primarily because of its role in reverse cholesterol transport, i.e. the transport of sterol to the liver were the sterol can be converted to bile acids and excreted (3.Trigatti B. Rigotti A. Krieger M. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 2000; 11: 123-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). SR-BI is expressed most abundantly in the liver, adrenal, and ovaries, where it functions as a physiological HDL receptor that mediates the selective uptake of cholesteryl esters from HDL (3.Trigatti B. Rigotti A. Krieger M. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 2000; 11: 123-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar).

Once associated with caveolae, a protein called caveolin directly binds to the catalytic domain of eNOS and maintains the enzyme in an inactive state (9.Feron O. Belhassen L. Kobzik L. Smith T.W.

We have extended these studies to examine the molecular mechanism responsible for the increase in nitric oxide production. Our studies demonstrate that HDL/SR-BI-dependent stimulation of eNOS is independent of an increase in intracellular calcium or Akt kinase-mediated phosphorylation of eNOS. We demonstrate that HDL binding to SR-BI causes an increase in intracellular ceramide levels and that this increase in ceramide appears to be responsible for the increase in eNOS activity.

After the pre-incubation period, aspirating the PBS from the wells and replacing it with 400 μl of PBS containing 0.75 μCi/ml [3H]l-arginine initiated NOS activation. The plates were incubated at 37 °C for 15 min in the absence of HDL (basal) or in the presence of acetylcholine (10 nm), 50 μg/ml HDL, SR-BI IgG (50 μg/ml), or nonspecific IgG (50 μg/ml). The NOS reaction was terminated by adding 500 μl of ice-cold 1m trichloroacetic acid to each well. The cells were freeze-fractured twice in liquid nitrogen for 2 min with thawing at 37 °C for 5 min, and scraped with a rubber spatula. The contents of each well were transferred to ice-cold glass test tubes. Ether extraction was performed three times with water-saturated ether to remove the trichloroacetic acid. The samples were neutralized with 1.5 ml of 25 mm HEPES, pH 8, applied to Dowex AG50WX-8 (Tris form) columns, and eluted with 1 ml of 40 mm HEPES buffer, pH 5.5, containing 2 mm EDTA and 2 mm EGTA. [3H]l-Citrulline generated was collected in scintillation vials and quantified by liquid scintillation counting. In individual experiments performed in 12-well plates, 4 wells were used for each treatment group. Findings were confirmed in at least three independent experiments. NOS activation in the intact cells was completely inhibited by 2 mm nitro-l-arginine methyl ester. To ensure that the treatments (HDL, LDL, ionomycin, ceramide, and nitro-l-arginine methyl ester) did not affect the loading of the cells with [3H]l-arginine, the amount of [3H]l-arginine associated with the cells was determined. The cells contained 220,000 ± 9,184 dpm/well [3H]l-arginine independent of the treatment. In each experiment, cytosolic calcium was measured simultaneously in 12–14 fura-2-loaded cells using a dual excitation spectrofluorometric system (Zeiss AttoFluor Ratio Vision Work station; Atto Instruments, Inc., Rockville, MD) (19.Jorgensen M. Wagner P. Arden W. Jackson B. J. Neurosci. Res. 2000; 59: 760-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Prior to analysis, the cells were rinsed three times with PBS and loaded with 5 μm fura-2AM for 10 min at 37 °C. After loading, the cells were rinsed three times with PBS and allowed to recover for at least 15 min. The coverslip was mounted in a closed perfusion chamber (Warner Instruments Corp.), placed on the stage of a Zeiss Axiovert inverted microscope fitted with a 40× fluorescence oil immersion objective, and constantly perfused by gravity-feed with ambient temperature PBS at 1–3 ml/min. In a typical experiment, basal (nonstimulated) fluorescence was monitored for 30–60 s prior to addition of HDL (50 μg/ml), which was added by the rapid change-out of the bathing medium. After 15 min exposure to HDL, cells were again washed thoroughly with PBS and then exposed to ionomycin (1 μg/ml) by the rapid change-out of the bathing medium. Fluorescence was determined using excitation wavelengths of 340 and 380 nm and an emission wavelength of 510 nm. Intracellular calcium levels were expressed as a 340:380 ratio. The lipids were extracted as described previously (20.Williams R.D. Wang E. Merrill A.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1984; 228: 282-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) and analyzed by thin layer chromatography on silica gel 60 plates (20 × 20 cm) using chloroform:methanol:triethylamine:2-propanol:potassium chloride (0.25%) (30:9:18:25:6, by volume) as the developing solvent. The regions migrating with a standard long chain ceramide were scraped from the plate and eluted from the silica with 1 ml of chloroform:methanol (1:1, v/v) followed by 1 ml of methanol. The combined eluted material was dried in vacuo, then 0.5 nmol of N-acetyl-C20-sphinganine were added to the unknown ceramide sample, and the ceramide mass was quantified by high performance liquid chromatography of the long chain bases released after an acid hydrolysis in 0.5 m HCl in methanol at 65 °C for 15 h. Free long chain bases were analyzed as described by Merrill et al. (21.Merrill A.H. Wang E. Mullins R.E. Jamison W.C. Nimkar S. Liotta D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 171: 373-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Least squares analysis of variance was used to evaluate the data with respect to cell fraction, time, and their interaction using the analysis of variance procedure of SigmaPlot. When appropriate, fractions were compared within a given time using Tukey's Honestly Significant Difference test. Means were considered different at p < 0.01. The purpose of the present study was to determine whether HDL binding to SR-BI stimulates eNOS and if so to elucidate the molecular mechanism responsible for this stimulation. We used ldl7A CHO cells to examine the potential role of SR-BI in this process (22.Graf G.A. Connell P.M. van der Westhuyzen D.R. Smart E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12043-12048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). This cell line was infected with retroviruses for human eNOS or human SR-BI. Fig. 1 is an immunoblot demonstrating that the CHO cell lines express SR-BI, eNOS, or both SR-BI and eNOS. It should be noted that cells expressing both SR-BI and eNOS contained ∼50% less eNOS than cell expressing only eNOS. We next determined if HDL could stimulate eNOS in a SR-BI-dependent manner. To do this each cell line was incubated with 0.75 μCi/ml [3H]arginine and buffer only, 10 μg/ml HDL, or 50 μg/ml HDL for 15 min at 37 °C. In addition, each cell line was treated with 1 μg/ml ionomycin, a calcium ionophore, to determine maximal eNOS stimulation and to account for the differences in the level of eNOS expression. The cells were then processed to quantify the amount of l-citrulline generated, and the data are presented as a percentage of maximal eNOS activity (plus ionomycin) (Fig. 2A). Control experiments withl-NAME demonstrated that less than 1% of the generated citrulline was not the result of eNOS activity (data not shown). Cells not expressing eNOS did not have any measurable eNOS activity (data not shown), however, HDL increased eNOS activity in cells containing both SR-BI and eNOS in a dose-dependent manner. In contrast, HDL did not stimulate eNOS in cells that were not also expressing SR-BI. Because SR-BI can bind to other ligands, such as LDL (3.Trigatti B. Rigotti A. Krieger M. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 2000; 11: 123-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar), we determined whether the activation of eNOS was specific for HDL or solely related to the binding of ligands to SR-BI. The addition of 10 or 50 μg/ml LDL to cells expressing both SR-BI and eNOS did not stimulate NOS activity (Fig. 2B). To ensure that these findings were not solely the result of the heterologous expression system, we used SR-BI blocking antibodies (5.Uittenbogaard A. Shaul P.W. Yuhanna I.S. Blair A. Smart E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11278-11283Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar) and human microvascular endothelial (HME) cells to confirm that HDL stimulates eNOS in a SR-BI-dependent manner. HME cells were pretreated with buffer only, 50 μg/ml blocking SR-BI IgG, or 50 μg/ml isotype-matched nonspecific IgG for 15 min at 37 °C. The cells were than incubated with 0.75 μCi/ml [3H]arginine and 50 μg/ml HDL for 15 min at 37 °C. Fig. 3 demonstrates that HDL stimulated eNOS in cells pretreated with buffer or nonspecific IgG. In contrast, cells pretreated with blocking SR-BI IgG did not increase eNOS activity in response to the addition of HDL. eNOS is stimulated by an increase in intracellular calcium, and it has been reported that HDL can induce an increase in intracellular calcium in cells grown in culture (23.Honda H.M. Wakamatsu B.K. Goldhaber J.I. Berliner J.A. Navab M. Weiss J.N. Atherosclerosis. 1999; 143: 299-306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Therefore, to determine whether HDL binding to SR-BI causes an increase in intracellular calcium, we loaded CHO cells expressing SR-BI and eNOS with fura-2AM for 10 min at 37 °C. The cells were then incubated with 50 μg/ml HDL for 15 min while continuously monitoring for calcium-induced fluorescence changes. Fig. 4A demonstrates that the addition of HDL to the cells did not cause an increase in intracellular calcium. However, the addition of the calcium ionophore, ionomycin, induced a calcium influx. To further confirm that intracellular calcium is not involved in HDL-mediated stimulation of eNOS, we treated HME cells with buffer only or 20 μm BAPTA/AM for 20 min to chelate intracellular calcium prior to the addition of buffer, 50 μg/ml HDL, or 10 nm acetylcholine. Fig. 4Bdemonstrates that pretreatment with BAPTA/AM completely inhibited acetylcholine-induced (calcium-dependent) eNOS stimulation but did not inhibit HDL-induced eNOS activation. Phosphorylation of eNOS by the protein kinase Akt has been shown to stimulate eNOS independent of an increase in intracellular calcium (12.Haynes M.P. Sinha D. Russell K.S. Collinge M. Fulton D. Morales-Ruiz M. Sessa W.C. Bender J.R. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: 677-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). Active Akt kinase is phosphorylated (12.Haynes M.P. Sinha D. Russell K.S. Collinge M. Fulton D. Morales-Ruiz M. Sessa W.C. Bender J.R. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: 677-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). To determine whether HDL binding to SR-BI promoted Akt activation, we treated CHO cells expressing both SR-BI and eNOS with buffer (15 min), 50 μg/ml HDL (5 or 15 min), or 50 nm PDGF (15 min). The growth factor, PDGF, induced the phosphorylation of Akt kinase (Fig. 5) but did not stimulate eNOS (data not shown). In contrast, HDL did not promote Akt kinase phosphorylation, suggesting that Akt kinase is not involved in HDL-mediated stimulation of eNOS. To further confirm this finding, we measured eNOS activity in CHO cells expressing both SR-BI and eNOS in the presence or absence of 100 nm wortmannin and 50 μg/ml HDL (15 min, 37 °C). Wortmannin inhibits phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase, which subsequently inhibits the activation of Akt kinase (12.Haynes M.P. Sinha D. Russell K.S. Collinge M. Fulton D. Morales-Ruiz M. Sessa W.C. Bender J.R. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: 677-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). Cells treated with HDL but not wortmannin generated 72 ± 8 fmol of [3H]citrulline/well and cells treated with HDL and wortmannin generated 71 ± 10 fmol of [3H]citrulline/well, further suggesting that Akt kinase does not mediate HDL stimulation of eNOS. Igarashi et al. (13.Igarashi J. Thatte H.S. Prabhakar P. Golan D.E. Michel T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12583-12588Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) recently demonstrated that ceramide could stimulate eNOS independent of calcium. To determine whether ceramide can stimulate eNOS in our system, CHO cells expressing eNOS only or eNOS and SR-BI were incubated with C2-ceramide (0.1–10 μm) or C2-dihydroceramide (10 μm) (inactive ceramide) for 0–15 min at 37 °C. Fig. 6 demonstrates that C2-ceramide stimulates eNOS in both cells, indicating that ceramide can activate eNOS and that ligand binding to SR-BI is not necessary when ceramide is added directly. The inactive analog of ceramide, C2-dihydroceramide, did not stimulate eNOS. We next determined if HDL binding to SR-BI increased intracellular ceramide levels by treating the appropriate CHO cells with buffer or 50 μg/ml HDL as described above. Following the incubation, the cells were processed to quantify ceramide (see “Experimental Procedures”). Fig. 7 demonstrates that the addition of HDL to CHO cells expressing SR-BI increased intracellular ceramide levels 5-fold. Importantly, this increase in ceramide did not lead to cell death because, when the HDL was removed and the cells incubated for an additional 4 h, the cells remained viable and ceramide levels returned to unstimulated levels (the cells were viable for more than 24 h after HDL treatment; data not shown). These data demonstrate that HDL binding to SR-BI stimulates endothelial nitric-oxide synthase in both a CHO heterologous expression system and in human microvascular endothelial cells. Yuhanna et al. (2.Yuhanna I.S. Zhu Y. Cox B.E. Hahner L.D. Osborne-Lawrence S. Lu P. Marcel Y.L. Anderson R.G. Mendelsohn M.E. Hobbs H.H. Shaul P.W. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 853-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar) recently published similar data demonstrating that eNOS is activated by HDL binding to SR-BI. However, Yuhanna et al.(2.Yuhanna I.S. Zhu Y. Cox B.E. Hahner L.D. Osborne-Lawrence S. Lu P. Marcel Y.L. Anderson R.G. Mendelsohn M.E. Hobbs H.H. Shaul P.W. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 853-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar) did not identify the mechanism of eNOS activation. eNOS is generally thought to be a calcium-dependent enzyme; however, recently both Akt kinase-mediated phosphorylation (12.Haynes M.P. Sinha D. Russell K.S. Collinge M. Fulton D. Morales-Ruiz M. Sessa W.C. Bender J.R. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: 677-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar) and an increase in cellular ceramide (13.Igarashi J. Thatte H.S. Prabhakar P. Golan D.E. Michel T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12583-12588Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) have been shown to activate eNOS in a calcium-independent manner. The primary means of increasing eNOS activity is by increasing the intracellular concentration of calcium (1.Arnal J.F. Dinh-Xuan A.T. Pueyo M. Darblade B. Rami J. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1999; 55: 1078-1087Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Consequently, we first determined whether HDL binding to SR-BI increased intracellular calcium. An increase in intracellular calcium was not seen in cells loaded with Fura-2 and then treated with HDL; however, treatment of the same cells with ionomycin caused an increase in intracellular calcium. Although this suggested that eNOS was activated without an increase in calcium, it was possible that a small and/or localized calcium transient was responsible for the stimulation. To further confirm that an increase in calcium was not involved in HDL-mediated stimulation of eNOS, the cells were treated with the calcium chelator BABPTA/AM and then incubated with HDL or acetylcholine. Acetylcholine-mediated stimulation of eNOS is calcium-dependent and was completely inhibited by BABTA/AM, whereas HDL-induced stimulation of eNOS was unaffected by BABPTA/AM. Taken together these data strongly imply that HDL binding to SR-BI does not increase intracellular calcium. This finding was surprising because HDL has been shown to promote an increase in intracellular calcium in a variety of cells, including endothelial cells (23.Honda H.M. Wakamatsu B.K. Goldhaber J.I. Berliner J.A. Navab M. Weiss J.N. Atherosclerosis. 1999; 143: 299-306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). It is unclear why HDL did not induce an increase in intracellular calcium in our CHO and HME cells. However, we used two independent methods to demonstrate that HDL stimulation of eNOS does not require an increase in intracellular calcium. Recently it has been demonstrated that estradiol can activate eNOS without an increase in cytosolic calcium (13.Igarashi J. Thatte H.S. Prabhakar P. Golan D.E. Michel T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12583-12588Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Additional studies demonstrated that estradiol activates phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, which subsequently activates the enzyme Akt kinase (12.Haynes M.P. Sinha D. Russell K.S. Collinge M. Fulton D. Morales-Ruiz M. Sessa W.C. Bender J.R. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: 677-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). Akt kinase resides in the cytosol and translocates to the plasma membrane when an agonist stimulates phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (12.Haynes M.P. Sinha D. Russell K.S. Collinge M. Fulton D. Morales-Ruiz M. Sessa W.C. Bender J.R. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: 677-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). Once at the plasma membrane, Akt kinase is activated by serine and threonine phosphorylation. Activated Akt kinase then can phosphorylate human eNOS on serine 1177, causing enhanced eNOS activity (24.McCabe T.J. Fulton D. Roman L.J. Sessa W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6123-6128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). A standard method of assessing if Akt kinase is active is to determine whether the kinase has been phosphorylated by using an anti-phospho-Akt kinase antibody. We could not detect any HDL-dependent phosphorylation of Akt kinase; however, the addition of PDGF induced significant Akt kinase phosphorylation. It is critical to note that PDGF did not stimulate eNOS, which suggests that different pools of Akt kinase exist in the cells. In contrast to our results, Nofer et al. (25.Nofer J. Levkau B. Wolinska I. Junker R. Fobker M. von Eckardstein A. Seedorf U. Assmann G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34480-34485Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that HDL can activate Akt kinase in human umbilical vein endothelial cells. Furthermore, the studies by Nofer et al. (25.Nofer J. Levkau B. Wolinska I. Junker R. Fobker M. von Eckardstein A. Seedorf U. Assmann G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34480-34485Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar) demonstrated that HDL contains two bioactive lipids, sphingosylphosphorylcholine and lysosulfatide, that caused the activation of Akt kinase. In these studies the authors used HDL at 1000 μg/ml, which is 20-fold higher than the concentration that we used. It is possible that the lower concentration of HDL that we used did not have enough bioactive lipid to activate Akt kinase. Recently, Igarashi et al. (13.Igarashi J. Thatte H.S. Prabhakar P. Golan D.E. Michel T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12583-12588Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) demonstrated that ceramide could activate eNOS independent of calcium. These authors demonstrated that bradykinin could induce eNOS activation without an increase in intracellular calcium. In the present study, we demonstrate for the first time that HDL binding to SR-BI will increase the intracellular concentration of ceramide. The accumulation of ceramide is relatively slow, taking up to 15 min for maximal generation (data not shown). The activation of eNOS parallels the generation of ceramide. When HDL was removed from the cells, ceramide returned to unstimulated levels, which was paralleled by a decrease in eNOS activity. Importantly, the generation of ceramide did not induce cell death because the cells remained viable for up to 24 h. In addition, incubation of cells with C2-ceramide activated eNOS independent of HDL binding to SR-BI, whereas the inactive form of ceramide, C2-dihydroceramide, did not stimulate eNOS. These data strongly suggest that HDL binding to SR-BI increases intracellular ceramide, which subsequently activates eNOS. The source of the ceramide is not clear. Both caveolae and lipid rafts are enriched in sphingomyelin (26.Smart E.J. Graf G.A. McNiven M.A. Sessa W.C. Engelman J.A. Scherer P.E. Okamoto T. Lisanti M.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7289-7304Crossref PubMed Scopus (926) Google Scholar), and several laboratories have reported sphingomyelinase activity in isolated caveolae and/or rafts (27.Dobrowsky R.T. Cell Signal. 2000; 12: 81-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Yuhanna et al. reported that a C-terminal anti-SR-BI antibody inhibited the ability of SR-BI to stimulate eNOS. When these data are taken together, it is tempting to speculate that HDL binding to SR-BI activates a caveola-localized sphingomyelinase that generates the ceramide that actives eNOS. Alternatively, it is possible that the ceramide is coming directly from the HDL particles. SR-BI can internalize cholesteryl esters (3.Trigatti B. Rigotti A. Krieger M. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 2000; 11: 123-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 22.Graf G.A. Connell P.M. van der Westhuyzen D.R. Smart E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12043-12048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) and phospholipids (28.Urban S. Zieseniss S. Werder M. Hauser H. Budzinski R. Engelmann B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33409-33419Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) from HDL; therefore, it is formally possible that SR-BI is internalizing HDL-ceramide that then stimulates eNOS activity. If this latter possibility is true, then different HDL particles should have different effects on vascular reactivity. This may explain why relatively high HDL levels in humans do not always protect against cardiovascular disease. In summary, we have demonstrated that HDL binding to SR-BI stimulates eNOS, which is in agreement with the studies of Yuhanna et al. (2.Yuhanna I.S. Zhu Y. Cox B.E. Hahner L.D. Osborne-Lawrence S. Lu P. Marcel Y.L. Anderson R.G. Mendelsohn M.E. Hobbs H.H. Shaul P.W. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 853-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar). In addition, we have demonstrated that the mechanism of HDL-SR-BI activation of eNOS is independent of an increase in intracellular calcium or Akt kinase phosphorylation. HDL binding to SR-BI induces an increase in intracellular ceramide, which appears to stimulate eNOS. We thank the Cardiovascular Research Group for invaluable advice and assistance."

These proteins are typically secreted in tick saliva and are potentially involved in the modulation of the host immune and hemostatic responses. In a previous study, the construction and the analysis of a subtractive library led to the identification ofI xodes r icinus immunosuppressor (Iris), a novel protein, differentially expressed in I. ricinus salivary glands during the blood meal. In the present study, the data strongly suggest that this protein is secreted by tick salivary glands into the saliva. In addition, Iris is also found to modulate T lymphocyte and macrophage responsiveness by inducing a Th2 type response and by inhibiting the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. In conclusion, these results suggest that Iris is an immunosuppressor, which might play an important role in the modulation of host immune response.

McSwain J.L. Bowman A.S. Essenberg R.C. Annu. Rev. Entomol. 1995; 40: 245-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar).Completion of the blood meal is dependent on the relationships of ticks with host species (2Brossard M. Wikel S.K. Med. Vet. Entomol. 1997; 11: 270-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Resistance to tick infestation implicates both innate and acquired immunity and is characterized by reduced feeding, molting, and mating capabilities that may lead to the death of the parasite. Acquired immunity of resistant hosts is mediated by a polarized Th1-type immune response, involving IFN-γ1 production and delayed type hypersensitivity reaction (3Allen J.R. Int. J. Parasitol. 1973; 3: 195-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 4Ganapamo F. Rutti B. Brossard M. Immunology. 1995; 85: 120-124PubMed Google Scholar).Some hosts are unable to counteract the tick infestation (4Ganapamo F. Rutti B. Brossard M. Immunology. 1995; 85: 120-124PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, during their blood meal, ticks circumvent host defenses via pharmacologically active components secreted in their saliva. These factors of major importance for tick survival can modulate innate and acquired immunity. In this way, the leukocyte responsiveness is modified during tick feeding (5Ganapamo F. Rutti B. Brossard M. Immunology. 1996; 87: 259-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). For example, cytokine production is modulated, inducing a polarized Th2 immune response (4Ganapamo F. Rutti B. Brossard M. Immunology. 1995; 85: 120-124PubMed Google Scholar, 6Kopecky J. Kuthejlova M. Parasite Immunol. 1998; 20: 169-174PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, the complex tick-host molecular interactions can be considered as a competition between host defenses raised against the parasite and the tick evasion strategies, facilitating feeding for an extended period.Although there is extensive information about the effects of tick bioactive factors on host immune response, little is known about the mechanisms of their actions. However, it has been observed that a wide range of new proteins are expressed during the blood meal (7Wang H. Nuttall P.A. Parasitology. 1994; 109: 517-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Several of them might be essential for the completion of the tick feeding process. At the present time, only a few of them have been characterized (8Bergman D.K. Ramachandra R.N. Wikel S.K. J. Med. Entomol. 1998; 35: 505-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 9Valenzuela J.G. Charlab R. Mather T.N. Ribeiro J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18717-18723Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar).To identify cDNAs encoding proteins specifically expressed during the blood meal in the salivary glands of I. ricinus female ticks, a representational difference analysis subtractive library was set up using mRNAs extracted from salivary glands of unfed and 5-day-fed female I. ricinus ticks. One clone, formerly named seq24 (GenBank™ accession no. AJ269658), was selected for further characterization of its recombinant protein (previously Seq24/MBP and Seq24/His), because of its similarity to the pig leukocyte elastase inhibitor (10Leboulle G. Rochez C. Louahed J. Rutti B. Brossard M. Bollen A. Godfroid E. Am. J. Trop. Med. Hyg. 2002; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Elastase inhibitors have been identified in many mammalian species but also in arthropods like the leech Hirudo nipponia (11Jung H.I. Kim S.I. Ha K.S. Joe C.O. Kang K.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13879-13884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The immunological properties of such inhibitors are not clearly established. However, these proteins are secreted by human macrophages, monocytes, and neutrophils (12Remold-O'Donnell E. Nixon J.C. Rose R.M. J. Exp. Med. 1989; 169: 1071-1086Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been also shown that the elastase inhibitor mRNA is abundantly expressed during delayed type hypersensibility responses (13Yang D. Nakada-Tsukui K. Ohtani M. Goto R. Yoshimura T. Kobayashi Y. Watanabe N. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2001; 129: 561-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Based on the results, we have decided to call this tick protein “Iris” for “I. ricinusimmunosuppressor.”In this study, we describe the characterization of Iris. We demonstrate that Iris is induced during the tick feeding process but is also secreted into the saliva. Moreover, the characterization of its properties shows that Iris has the unique capacity to modulate both the innate and the acquired immunity of the host.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESBiological MaterialsUnfed and 5-day-fed tick salivary gland proteinic extracts were obtained from 300 and 70 I. ricinus salivary glands, respectively. These salivary glands were crushed for 10 min using a potter and a pestle in extraction buffer (1× PBS, pH 7.4, 10 mm EDTA, 1 mm4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride; Sigma-Aldrich, Bornem, Belgium). The samples were centrifuged at 10,000 ×g for 8 min, and the supernatants were stored at −20 °C.Saliva was collected from ticks fed for 5 days on the ears of a rabbit. Engorging ticks were removed and washed, and a 0.2% dopamine (Sigma-Aldrich) solution in 1× PBS, pH 7.2, was injected in the tick body. A finely drawn capillary tube fitted over the mouthparts of each tick enabled us to collect saliva.Production of Recombinant Iris (rIris) Protein in Bacterial and Mammalian Expression SystemsRecombinant Iris (rIris) protein was obtained as described by Leboulle et al. (10Leboulle G. Rochez C. Louahed J. Rutti B. Brossard M. Bollen A. Godfroid E. Am. J. Trop. Med. Hyg. 2002; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, iris cDNA was recovered by analyzing a representational difference analysis subtractive library. This library was constructed as described by Hubank and Schatz (14Hubank M. Schatz D.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 5640-5648Crossref PubMed Scopus (780) Google Scholar) by using mRNA populations extracted from unfed and 5-day-engorged tick salivary glands. The completeiris cDNA sequence was recovered by performing the rapid amplification of cDNA ends methodology as described by Frohman (15Frohman B.H. Dieffenbach C.W. Dveksler G.S. PCR Primer: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1995: 381-409Google Scholar). The recombinant rIris/MBP protein was expressed inEscherichia coli by using the pMALC2-E vector (New England Biolabs, Hitchin, United Kingdom) containing MBP fusion partner. The rIris/His protein was expressed in CHO-KI cells by using the pCDNA3.1/V5-His A vector containing the Epitag V5/His6tag fusion partner (10Leboulle G. Rochez C. Louahed J. Rutti B. Brossard M. Bollen A. Godfroid E. Am. J. Trop. Med. Hyg. 2002; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar).The rIris/His protein was purified in batch by nickel-chelate chromatography (nickel-NTA superflow resin; Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), according to manufacturer's instructions. Different buffers were used to purify the rIris/His protein: the lysis buffer (1× PBS, 500 mm NaCl, 0.1% Zwittergent 3.12, pH 7.5); the washing buffer (1× PBS, 500 mm NaCl, 0.1% Zwittergent 3.12, 17.25 mm imidazole, pH 7.5), and the elution buffer (1× PBS, 500 mm NaCl, 0.1% Zwittergent 3.12, 103 mmimidazole, pH 7.5). The eluate was dialyzed (in a 7,000-Da cut-off membrane) in 1× PBS, 500 mm NaCl, pH 7.5. The concentration of the protein was evaluated on a Coomassie Blue-stained acrylamide gel, at ∼10 ng/μl (250 nm), by comparison with known quantities of BSA. This result was confirmed by performing a micro bicinchoninic acid (BCA) protein assay (Pierce; data not shown).Immunodetection of IrisTo examine the expression of native proteins in salivary glands and to detect rIris/His, the same quantities of fed and unfed tick salivary glands and a rIris/His sample were subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were probed with diluted sera directed against rIris/MBP (1:1,000) (10Leboulle G. Rochez C. Louahed J. Rutti B. Brossard M. Bollen A. Godfroid E. Am. J. Trop. Med. Hyg. 2002; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar) and revealed with nitro blue tetrazolium/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate.Confocal MicroscopyI. ricinus salivary glands were dissected from unfed, 3-day-fed, or 5-day-fed ticks and immobilized on silanated slides (Bio-Rad, Nazareth EKE, Belgium). Salivary glands were fixed in a 4% paraformaldehyde solution. After a treatment with 0.5% Triton X-100, the samples were incubated in 1× PBS containing 5% fetal calf serum. The anti-rIris/MBP serum was used at a 1:10 dilution, and the secondary antibody, a fluorescein isothiocyanate anti-mouse IgG (H+L) (ICN, Asse-Relegem, Belgium) at a 1:32 dilution. The slides were mounted in Vectashield mounting medium (Vector Lab, Peterborough, United Kingdom) and observed with a Leica confocal laser microscope using a Leica TCS 4D operating system (Leica, Wetzlar, Germany).Preparation of rIris/His Cellular Extract and rIris Negative Control (NEG) Extracts Used in Activity TestsCHO-KI cells expressing rIris/His protein, obtained from a confluent culture in five 150-cm2 flasks, were resuspended in 1 ml of RPMI 1640 complete medium. The sample was frozen and thawed three times before being centrifuged at 50,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. The supernatant was recovered and used in the different activity tests. NEG was a proteinic extract of CHO-KI cells resistant to G418 that do not express the recombinant protein and was prepared as the rIris/His extract. The concentration of rIris/His in the cellular extract was evaluated at ∼4 ng/μl (∼100 nm), by comparing rIris/His contained in cellular extracts and purified rIris/His, on Western blot revealed with anti-V5 antibody (Invitrogen, Groningen, The Netherlands). The toxicity of the different samples for human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) was evaluated by using the 7-amino-actinomycin D viability dye (Immunotech, Marseille, France), according to manufacturer's instructions.Cell CultureNaive Balb/c Spleen CellsA suspension of spleen cells (SC) was isolated from naive Balb/c mice. 106 lymph node cells/well were cultivated with serial dilutions of rIris/His or NEG cellular extracts for 2 h in 100 μl of complete culture medium containing RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen, Basel, Switzerland) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (v/v), 2 mml-glutamine, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 1 mm nonessential amino acids (Sigma), 0.05 mmmercaptoethanol, 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen), and 25 μg/ml Funigizone (Invitrogen). Cells were then stimulated with 1 μg/ml concanavalin A (ConA) in a final volume of 200 μl for 15 h. 1 μCi/well [3H]thymidine (Amersham Biosciences, Inc., Amersham, United Kingdom) was added 24 h before harvesting the cells. Tritiated thymidine incorporation was determined by liquid scintillation counting. Results show the means (± S.D.) of duplicate rIris/His or NEG stimulated wells realized in two independent experiments. Means of ConA-unstimulated wells were previously subtracted.Naive Human PBMCsExperiments were realized with PBMCs, obtained from 5 different donors, used separately. PBMCs were resuspended in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (v/v), l-glutamine 2 mm, penicillin-streptomycin (100 units/ml), and IL-2 (20 units/ml). 2 × 106 cells were pre-cultivated in 1 ml of culture medium. Cells were then diluted at different concentrations in 96-well plates (2 × 105 cells/100 μl for protein purified derivative (PPD) stimulation, 5 × 104 cells/100 μl for LPS stimulation for the ELISPOT technique, and 2 × 105 cells/100 μl for the ELISA technique). Finally, PBMCs were incubated, for 72 h at 37 °C, with different dilutions of rIris/His or NEG cellular extract or anti-rIris/MBP serum and the different activators: phytohemagglutinin A (PHA) (at a final concentration of 1 μg/ml), LPS (1 μg/ml), anti-CD3/CD28 monoclonal antibody (500 ng/ml), PMA/CD28 (PMA at 25 ng/ml, CD28 at 500 ng/ml), and PPD (5 μg/ml).Detection of CytokinesELISPOT Assay96-well nitrocellulose bottom-coated plates (Multiscreen-HA Mahan, Millipore, Brussels, Belgium) were coated with coating antibodies directed against IFN-γ (clone C1-D16 MAB 1-D1K, Nodia, Antwerp, Belgium) and IL-10 (clone JES3-9D7, PharMingen, San Diego, CA). Cells were stimulated with PHA or LPS and rIris/His or NEG cellular extracts for 72 h at 37 °C. Supernatants were recovered and stored at −20 °C. The cytokines were detected, in the 96-well plates, with biotinylated anti-IFN-γ antibody (clone JES3–5A10 MAB 7-B6-1, Nodia) and anti-IL10 antibody (clone JES3-12G8, PharMingen) diluted in PBS, 0.25% Tween (1 μg/ml). Finally, the captured antibodies were revealed with extravidin peroxidase and 3-amino-9-ethyl carbazole substrate (Sigma-Aldrich). Results show the mean of triplicate wells (± S.D.). Means of unstimulated wells were previously subtracted. The rIris/His and NEG protein extracts do not affect the cell viability (data not shown).ELISA TechniqueCytokine-specific ELISAs were realized using the Flexia human kit (BIOSOURCE, Nivelles, Belgium) for the detection of IFN-γ, IL-10, TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β, and IL-8, and the IL-5 kit (Endogene, Woburn, MA) for the detection of IL-5. The assays were carried out using manufacturer's instructions and were revealed using 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine substrate. The concentration of the different cytokines in the experimental samples (pg/ml) was calculated against a standard curve generated with recombinant cytokines. Results show the mean of rIris/His or NEG cellular extract-stimulated wells realized in five independent experiments (± S.D.). Means of unstimulated wells were previously subtracted.Statistical AnalysisThe significance of the differences obtained between NEG and rIris/His-treated groups was evaluated by Student's t test using the pooled or Satterthwaite method.RESULTSDetection of Iris in I. ricinus Salivary Glands and SalivaImmune sera recovered from mice immunized with rIris/MBP (formerly Seq24/MBP) were used to detect the native Iris protein in the salivary glands and saliva from unfed or engorged female I. ricinusticks. Iris was revealed by Western blot in tick saliva at a molecular mass of 43 kDa (data not shown). By using confocal microscopy, it was found in 3-day-fed and, more abundantly, in 5-day-fed tick salivary glands on the external surface of salivary acini, within the cells and also in the acini's light, but was not detected in unfed tick salivary glands (Fig. 1). These results suggest that the expression of Iris is induced in the salivary glands during the tick feeding process and that Iris is secreted in tick saliva.Characterization of the Immunomodulatory Properties of IrisBased on its homology to a leukocyte elastase inhibitor, the immunomodulatory properties of Iris were examined by using different activity tests that were mainly performed with soluble proteinic extracts of CHO-KI cells expressing rIris/His (formerly named Seq24/His) at a concentration of ∼4 ng/μl (100 nm). Proteinic extracts of CHO-KI cells, which do not express rIris/His, were used as NEG.In Vitro Proliferation of Balb/c Naive Spleen CellsThe proliferation of naive Balb/c SC was analyzed in vitro by pre-incubating them with various dilution (1:6.25 to 1:50) of rIris/His cellular extracts, followed by stimulation with ConA. As shown on Fig.2, the proliferative response of SC was strongly diminished (81% of inhibition at a 1:6.25 dilution) in a dose-dependent manner. The negative control had no significant effect on ConA-stimulated SC (average inhibition of 15%); even if it inhibited by 25% the SC proliferation at a 1:6.25 dilution.Figure 2Balb/c spleen cells stimulated with ConA. SC were incubated only with ConA (N.S.) or with different dilutions of rIris/His and NEG cellular extracts. Tritiated thymidine incorporation was determined by liquid scintillation counting (10−3 cpm ± S.D.).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)In Vitro Stimulation of Human PBMCsThe effect of rIris/His on cytokine production was studied on PBMCs stimulated with different activators. The number of PBMCs secreting IFN-γ and IL-10, after stimulation either with LPS or PHA, was assayed by the ELISPOT technique (Fig. 3). After PHA stimulation, in presence of rIris/His cellular extract, a reduced number of PBMCs (more than 80%) secreted IFN-γ, whereas the number of cells producing IL-10 remained unchanged. Furthermore, the NEG protein extract had no effect on the production of both cytokines by PHA-stimulated PBMCs. In contrast, after LPS stimulation, no difference in the number of cells producing IFN-γ was observed between PBMCs incubated with rIris/His and the NEG cellular extract. On the other hand, rIris/His extract enhanced by 400% the number of PBMCs expressing IL-10, whereas stimulation with NEG cellular extract did not enhance the number of cells producing IL-10.Figure 3IFN-γ and IL-10 ELISPOT of human PBMCs. The number of activated cells producing the cytokines upon treatment with PHA or LPS was evaluated (spots/106 cells ± S.D.). Activated cells were counted after treatment with rIris/His or NEG cellular extracts. A positive control was realized by stimulating the cells only with the activator (PHA or LPS).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The effect of rIris/His cellular extract (used at a 1:5 dilution) on the production of cytokines (IFN-γ, IL-8, IL-10, IL-6, TNF-α, and IL-1β) by PBMCs stimulated with a set of activators (PHA, CD3/CD28, LPS, and PPD) was also evaluated by ELISA (TableI). The results indicated that the production of almost all tested cytokines (IFN-γ, IL-6, TNF-α, and IL-8) was inhibited by the rIris/His cellular extract, except for IL-1β production, which was unaffected after LPS stimulation (TableI). rIris/His cellular extract inhibited IL-10 production by PMBCs after PHA stimulation, and had no effect on PMBCs stimulated with CD3/CD28 and LPS. The NEG cellular extract had no significant effect on the cytokine production except after LPS stimulation, which inhibited IL-10 production and enhanced IL-6 production. The dose-dependent effect of rIris/His was examined by analyzing the IFN-γ, IL-5, and IL-10 production under CD3/CD28 and PPD stimulation (Fig. 4). In these cases, the maximum inhibition of IFN-γ production by rIris/His was of ∼65% [the difference between rIris/His and NEG cellular extracts were statistically significant (p < 0.01)] and ∼75% (p < 0.05) after CD3/CD28 and PPD stimulation, respectively. This inhibition was still effective at a 1:12.5 dilution. In contrast, no difference in the production of IL-5 and IL-10 was observed between PBMCs incubated with rIris/His and NEG cellular extracts.Table ICytokine production by PBMC treated with rIris/His cellular extractCell StimulationPHACD3/CD28PPDLPSIFN-γ−−−−36%46%7%43%IL-8−−−22%12%13%IL-10−///27%97%98%116%IL-6−−−−16%16%12%10%TNF-α−11%IL-1β/97%Expression is inhibited (−) or unchanged (/).

The production of the cytokines (concentration in pg/ml ± S.D.) was evaluated by ELISA after treatment with CD3/CD28 or PPD.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To confirm the role of Iris in the modulation of the production of some cytokines, PBMCs stimulated by CD3/CD28 activator were incubated with various dilutions (from 1:250 to 1:4,000) of anti-rIris/MBP serum (Fig.5 A). It was observed that PBMCs treated with rIris/His cellular extract (at dilution 1:12.5) in the presence of anti-rIris/MBP serum restored the IFN-γ production in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 5 A), whereas this antiserum itself had no immunostimulating effect on cytokine production by PBMCs (data not shown). At dilution of 1:250, the antiserum re-established the IFN-γ production to a level similar to that obtained by CD3/CD28-stimulated PBMCs without rIris/His. To assert the specificity of the neutralizing activity of the anti-rIris/MBP serum, its effect was measured on the activity of cyclosporine A (CsA) (Fig.5 B), an immunosuppressive drug. The effect of a serum specific to an unrelated MBP fusion protein was also measured on rIris/His cellular extracts activity (Fig. 5 A). The anti-rIris/MBP serum (at a 1:250 dilution) did not affect the activity of 400 nm CsA, and the unrelated antiserum had no effect on the rIris/His immunomodulatory activity.Figure 5IFN-γ production by human PBMCs stimulated with CD3/CD28. The cells were stimulated with NEG and rIris/His cellular extracts at a 1:12.5 dilution. All the assays were realized by stimulating the cells, with CD3/CD28 only (P.C.), with CD3/CD28 in the presence of NEG cellular extract (NEG), or with CD3/CD28 in the presence of rIris/His cellular extract (rIris/His). A, CD3/CD28 stimulated cells were incubated with rIris/His cellular extract in the presence of various dilutions of either anti-rIris/MBP serum (Anti-rIris/MBP+rIris/His) or a nonspecific serum (ns Ab+rIris/His). B, CD3/CD28-stimulated cells were incubated with 400 nm CsA (CsA), with 400 nm CsA in the presence of anti-rIris/MBP serum (CsA + Anti-rIris/MBP), or with 400 nm CsA and the nonspecific serum (CsA + NS AB); both antisera were used at a 1:250 dilution. C, CD3/CD28-stimulated PBMCs were also incubated with purified NEG (pNEG) or rIris/His (pIris/His) protein and with purified NEG or rIris/His proteins in the presence of anti-rIris/MBP serum at a 1:250 dilution (pNEG + Anti-rIris/MBP andpIris/His + Anti-rIris/MBP).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Finally, a small amount of rIris/His was purified from the rIris/His CHO-K1 cellular extract. This purified rIris/His protein, at a ∼25 nm concentration, completely inhibited the IFN-γ production by CD3/CD28-stimulated PBMCs (Fig. 5 C), which was partially restored (50% of the IFN-γ production by CD3/CD28-stimulated PBMCs) by using anti-rIris/MBP serum (at 1:250 dilution). Interestingly, it was found that the level of inhibition of ∼25 nm purified rIris/His was comparable with that of 400 nm CsA. The incubation of CD3/CD28-stimulated PBMCs with either purified NEG and anti-rIris/MBP serum (at 1:250 dilution) or purified NEG alone had no influence on the IFN-γ production.DISCUSSIONIt is now well established that the modulation of host immunity by tick saliva is of major importance both in the successful accomplishment of the blood meal and in the transmission of tick-borne pathogens such as Borrelia burgdorferi, the causal agent of Lyme disease (16Zeidner N. Dreitz M. Belasco D. Fish D. J. Infect. Dis. 1996; 173: 187-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Although extensive information is available on the effects of tick feeding on host immune defenses, little is known about the nature of the immunomodulatory molecules expressed by tick salivary glands. Tick salivary gland extracts (SGE) modulates host immune response by modifying both lymphocyte and monocyte activities. For example, T lymphocyte proliferation in response to mitogens (17Wikel S.K. Ann. Trop. Med. Parasitol. 1982; 76: 627-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) and the production of Th1 cytokines as IFN-γ and IL-2 are inhibited by SGE (18Ramachandra R.N. Wikel S.K. J. Med. Entomol. 1992; 29: 818-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Moreover, Th2 type cytokine production such as IL-10, IL-5, and IL-4 is in general slightly enhanced (4Ganapamo F. Rutti B. Brossard M. Immunology. 1995; 85: 120-124PubMed Google Scholar, 5Ganapamo F. Rutti B. Brossard M. Immunology. 1996; 87: 259-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Tick SGE also inhibits the production of several cytokines (IFN-γ, IL-8, IL-6, TNF-α, etc.) by human macrophages (19Fuchsberger N. Kita M. Hajnicka V. Imanishi J. Labuda M. Nuttall P.A. Exp. Appl. Acarol. 1995; 19: 671-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Studies indicated that some of those immunomodulating phenomena are induced by proteins (20Urioste S. Hall L.R. Telford III, S.R. Titus R.G. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 1077-1085Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 21Mejri N. Franscini N. Rutti B. Brossard M. Parasite Immunol. 2001; 23: 61-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar).In this work, we have characterized the properties of a protein induced during the tick feeding process, which is called Iris for “I. ricinus immunosuppressor,” because of its exceptional immune properties on leukocytes.The corresponding mRNA sequence was first recovered by analyzing a representational difference analysis subtractive library, and by using the rapid amplification of cDNA ends method (10Leboulle G. Rochez C. Louahed J. Rutti B. Brossard M. Bollen A. Godfroid E. Am. J. Trop. Med. Hyg. 2002; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). In this report, we show by Western blot and confocal microscopy using a specific antiserum that Iris is not only specifically expressed during the blood meal in female I. ricinus salivary glands but is also present in saliva with an increasing expression from day 3 to day 5 of engorgement. To determine the immunomodulatory properties of Iris, we studied the effect of the corresponding recombinant protein (rIris/His) on naive Balb/c spleen cell proliferation, and on human PBMCs cytokine production, using specific T lymphocytes (PHA, ConA, CD3/CD28, and PMA/CD28), macrophages (LPS), and APC (PPD) activators. The results indicated that rIris/His cellular extracts inhibited in a dose-dependent manner the proliferation of murine lymphocytes. ELISA and ELISPOT assays showed that the rIris/His cellular extracts suppressed the production of IFN-γ by human T cell and APC, whereas IL-5 and IL-10 levels remained unchanged or were inhibited. Indeed, rIris/His cellular extract inhibited IL-10 production by T lymphocytes stimulated with PHA, but had no effect on CD3/CD28-stimulated cells. In contrast, rIris/His extract enhanced the number of macrophages producing IL-10 (see Fig. 3) and had no effect on the expression of this cytokine by macrophages (Table I). This difference could be explained by the low level of IL-10 detected by ELISA, the high sensitivity (up to 200 times) of the ELISPOT technique, and the variety in shape and size of the spots observed with ELISPOT. Nevertheless, these results suggest Iris does not inhibit the IL-10 production by macroph"

Membrane efflux induced either by in situ generated ceramides (through enzymatic cleavage of sphingomyelin) or by addition of ceramides to preformed membranes has been studied. Large unilamellar vesicles composed of different phospholipids and cholesterol, and containing entrapped fluorescent molecules, have been used as a system to assay ceramide-dependent efflux. Small proportions of ceramide (10 mol % of total lipid) that may exist under physiological conditions of ceramide-dependent signaling have been used in most experiments. When long chain (egg-derived) ceramides are used, both externally added or enzymatically produced ceramides induce release of vesicle contents. However, the same proportion of ceramides generated by sphingomyelinase induce faster and more extensive efflux than when added in organic solution to the preformed vesicles. Under our conditions 10 mol % of N-acetylsphingosine (C2-ceramide) did not induce any efflux. On the other hand, sphingomyelinase treatment of bilayers containing 50 mol % sphingomyelin gave rise to release of fluorescein-derivatised dextrans of molecular mass ≈20 kDa, i.e. larger than cytochrome c. These results have been discussed in the light of our own previous data (Ruiz-Argüello, M. B., Basañez, G., Goñi, F. M., and Alonso, A. (1996) J. Biol.

Our spectroscopic observations appear to be in good agreement with the electrophysiological studies of the latter authors. Furthermore, some experiments in this paper have been designed to explore the mechanism of ceramide-induced efflux.

Two properties of ceramide, namely its capacity to induce negative monolayer curvature and its tendency to segregate into ceramide-rich domains, appear to be important in the membrane restructuring process. Ceramides have emerged in the last decade as important messengers in cell signaling involved among others, in processes of cell differentiation, growth suppression, and apoptosis. Mechanisms of ceramide-mediated signal transduction are now starting to be understood (see Refs. 1.Venkataraman K. Futerman A.H. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 408-412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar and 2.Kolesnick R.N. Goñi F.M. Alonso A. J. Cell. Physiol. 2000; 184: 285-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar, for reviews). One striking property of ceramides, that may be linked to their physiological effect, is their capacity to restructure the permeability barrier of model and cell membranes, thus giving rise to vesicle or cell efflux. Ceramide-induced release of aqueous contents from liposomes and resealed erythrocyte ghosts was first observed by Ruiz-Argüello et al. (3.Ruiz-Argüello M.B. Basañez G. Goñi F.M. Alonso A. J. Biol.

Ceramide-induced membrane efflux may be important physiologically, e.g. in generating local ion fluxes, or even in the release of large molecules, like cytochrome c, whose efflux from mitochondria is crucial for the activation of apoptosis.

However, Di Paola et al. (6.Di Paola M. Cocco T. Lorusso M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 6660-6668Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar) observed that C2-ceramide, but not N-palmitoylsphingosine (C16-ceramide, an abundant natural ceramide) was able to induce efflux from the inner mitochondrial membrane in isolated mitochondrial suspensions as evidenced from its ability to dissipate the inner mitochondrial membrane potential. Also recently, Siskind and Colombini (7.Siskind L.J. Colombini M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38640-38644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar) used electrophysiological methods to demonstrate the formation of stable pores by short and long chain ceramides in planar lipid bilayers. In their studies ceramides in organic solvent were added to preformed bilayers or admixtured with the component lipids at total ceramide:lipid ratios of 0.05. Pore formation was observed after a few minutes. N-acetylsphingosine N-hexanoylsphingosine large unilamellar vesicle(s) 8-aminonaphthalene-1,3,6-trisulfonic acid p-xylenebis (pyridinium bromide) fluorescein isothiocyanate phosphatidylcholine phosphatidylethanolamine sphingomyelin cholesterol dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine dielaido- ylphosphatidylethanolamine In the present study, we have attempted to answer a number of questions that remain open after publication of the above data, in particular the possibility of inducing the release of large molecules (the size of cytochrome c) by ceramide, the existence of common aspects in the efflux induced by in situ enzyme-generated and by externally added ceramide, and the correlation between electrophysiological obervations of channel formation and biochemical/biophysical detection of release of vesicle or cell contents. For that purpose we have prepared large unilamellar vesicles with varying lipid compositions, sphingomyelin ranging between 0 and 50 mol % of the total lipid and loaded them with water-soluble fluorescent molecules. Ceramides have been generated in situ by sphingomyelinase, or added to the preformed vesicles, or mixed with the other lipids in the process of liposome preparation. Our results show that the presence of ceramides can indeed allow the efflux of large molecules (molecular mass ≈20 kDa) through membranes, that both in situ generation and external addition of ceramides can induce release, and that electrophysiological detection of pore formation correlates with release of vesicular contents (although with significant differences in the time scale of detection of the phenomena). Moreover, the role of the molecular geometry of ceramides, and of their immiscibility with other lipids in the mechanism of membrane permeabilization are supported by the experimental data. Sphingomyelinase (EC 3.1.4.12) from Bacillus cereus was supplied by Sigma. Egg PC and egg PE were purchased from Lipid Products (South Nutfield, UK). Egg SM, egg ceramide, lyso-PC, and plant asolectin were from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL). Plant asolectin (soya bean phospholipids) contained 46% phosphatidylcholine, 22% phosphatidylethanolamine, 18% phosphatidylinositol, 7% phosphatidic acid, 7% others, according to the manufacturer. ANTS and DPX were supplied by Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR). Ch was from Sigma, and FITC-dextran was from Serva (Frankfurt, Germany). Large unilamellar vesicles (LUV) of diameters 100–150 nm were prepared by the extrusion method (8.Mayer L.D. Hope M.H. Cullis P.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 858: 161-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (1576) Google Scholar) using Nuclepore filters of 0.1 μm pore diameter at room temperature, in 10 mm HEPES, 200 mm NaCl, 10 mm CaCl2, 2 mm MgCl2, pH 7.0. Quantitative analysis of the LUV preparations, as described by Ruiz-Argüello et al.(3.Ruiz-Argüello M.B. Basañez G. Goñi F.M. Alonso A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26616-26621Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), showed that their composition did not differ significantly from the initial lipid mixture. All experiments were performed at 37 °C, except when asolectin vesicles were involved, in which case temperature was 20 °C, because of the large spontaneous permeability of asolectin vesicles at 37 °C. Lipid concentration was 0.3 mm, and sphingomyelinase was used at 1.6 units/ml. Sphingomyelinase activity was assayed by determining phosphorus contents in the aqueous phase of an extraction mixture (chloroform:methanol, 2:1) after addition of aliquots from the reaction mixture at different times. Because of the 1:1 ceramide:phosphate stoichiometry of the enzyme products, enzyme activities could be given either as ceramide production or as phosphate production. Since commercial sphingomyelinase preparations may contain phospholipase C impurities, 2 mm o-phenanthroline (9.Little C. Otnaess A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1975; 391: 326-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) was routinely added in all our enzyme assays. In the presence of this specific inhibitor of phospholipase C, thin layer chromatography experiments demonstrated that only SM, and not PC or PE, were degraded by the enzyme. Vesicle efflux was usually assayed with the ANTS:DPX fluorescent system (10.Ellens H. Bentz J. Szoka F.C. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 4141-4147Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Alternatively, FITC-derived dextran of molecular mass 20,000 was entrapped in the vesicles. Details on the use of these fluorescent probes, including assay calibration, have been given elsewhere (11.Nieva J.L. Goñi F.M. Alonso A. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 7364-7367Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar,12.Ostolaza H. Bartolomé B. Ortiz de Zárate I. de la Cruz F. Goñi F.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1147: 81-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Fluorescence measurements were performed in an Aminco Bowman Series 2 luminescence spectrometer. Ceramide was introduced in the vesicle membranes by one of these four procedures: (i) sphingomyelinase (0.8 unit) was added to 0.5 ml of vesicle suspension, 0.3 mm in lipid (3.Ruiz-Argüello M.B. Basañez G. Goñi F.M. Alonso A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26616-26621Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar); (ii) ceramide was dissolved (3.75 mm) in dodecane/ethanol (2:98 by volume) (13.Chalfant C.E. Kishikawa K. Mumby M.C. Kamibayashi C. Bielawska A. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20313-20317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar) and a small volume (2–4 μl) added to 0.5 ml of vesicle suspension (0.3 mm in lipid) in the cuvette; (iii) ceramide was dissolved (3.75 mm) in ethanol at 40 °C and a small volume (2–4 μl) added to 0.5 ml of vesicle suspension; and (iv) ceramide was mixed in chloroform-methanol with the other lipids at the beginning of the process of vesicle preparation, then solvent was evaporated and the lipid mixture hydrated in buffer. When large unilamellar vesicles composed of SM:PE:Ch (2:1:1 mole ratio) were treated with sphingomyelinase under the conditions described under “Materials and Methods,” ceramide was generated within the lipid bilayers as a result of sphingomyelin cleavage (Fig. 1A). When the vesicles were loaded, under isotonic conditions, with water-soluble fluorescent probes, efflux could be observed concomitantly with ceramide production (Fig. 1B). In a previous study (3.Ruiz-Argüello M.B. Basañez G. Goñi F.M. Alonso A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26616-26621Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) we had described the release of low molecular weight markers, i.e. ANTS, DPX, from the vesicles. We have now extended these observations to include the release of larger molecules, of molecular masses up to 20 kDa. As seen in Fig. 1B, fluorescent dextrans the size of small proteins, e.g. cytochrome c, could be released through the activity of sphingomyelinase on SM-containing bilayers. In another series of experiments, the proportion of sphingomyelin in the bilayer, thus of ceramide formed by enzyme action, was varied. For this purpose a number of LUV preparations were made, of general composition SM:PC:PE:Ch (X:Y:25:25, mole ratio), such that X + Y was always 50 mol %, and X varied from 0 (control) to 50. Fig. 2 shows the kinetics of ceramide production and ANTS release from LUV composed of SM:PC:PE:Ch (10:40:25:25, mole ratio). Under these conditions release was slow, note the time scale in the abscissa, as compared with Fig. 1. Virtually no release was observed in the first 10 min after enzyme addition. When the proportion of SM in the bilayer was increased, at least in the 0–50% range, both the initial rates and extents of probe liberation increased accordingly (Fig. 3). This result shows that efflux is very sensitive to the concentration of ceramide in the bilayer.Figure 3Effect of bilayer composition on ceramide-induced efflux of ANTS-DPX.

Colombini M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38640-38644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar) (see Introduction), prompted us to study in our system the effect of adding ceramides to lipid bilayers. This was done in either of two forms, (i) co-dissolving ceramide with phospholipids in organic solvent, then drying and preparing the liposomes in the usual way or (ii) adding a small volume of ceramide in organic solvent to a suspension of vesicles. In the latter case, ceramides were dissolved either in dodecane:ethanol (2:98, by volume) at room temperature or in absolute ethanol at ca. 40 °C. The bilayer lipid composition was either SM:PE:Ch (2:1:1, mole ratio), or egg PC:Ch (5:1, mole ratio), or plant asolectin. The first composition was also used by Ruiz-Argüello et al. (3.Ruiz-Argüello M.B. Basañez G. Goñi F.M. Alonso A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26616-26621Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), and the last two were used by Siskind and Colombini (7.Siskind L.J. Colombini M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38640-38644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). With asolectin vesicles measurements were performed at 20 °C, because the liposomes had a very high spontaneous permeability at 37 °C, the temperature at which our experiments were routinely conducted. In all cases, a control experiment (“0% ceramide”) was performed in which only the organic solvent was added. The results of ceramide-induced efflux are summarized in Table I, and some selected observations are shown in Fig. 4. Ceramides added to bilayers, the latter either in the process of preparation or already formed in water, did elicit a certain degree of release of ANTS, although at a slower rate and to smaller extent than enzymatically generated ceramides (see, e.g. Figs. 2B and 4A). Bilayer lipid composition was important in the process, PC:Ch being more stable than SM:PE:Ch or asolectin (see Table I) (more on this subject below). Ceramide solvent was also significant when ceramides were added to preformed liposomes, dodecane:ethanol being consistently more efficient than warm ethanol (Table I).Table ICeramide-induced release of vesicle aqueous contentsBilayer composition, mol % ceramide in bilayerSolventInitial rate (% fluorescence/min)Extent (% fluorescence)aPercent release after 360 min.SM:PC:PE:Ch (10:40:25:25)In situbCeramide generated from SM by 1.6 units/ml sphingomyelinase.

The effect of short chain ceramides (i.e. N-acylsphingosine with C2 or C6 acyl chains) on membrane restructuring was also tested in a similar way. Only ethanol was used as solvent, since both C2- and C6-ceramides were highly soluble in it. The results are also summarized in Table I (bottom lines). C6-ceramide induced some efflux on SM:PE:Ch but not on asolectin bilayers, while C2-ceramide was inactive on both systems. We have suggested elsewhere (2.Kolesnick R.N. Goñi F.M. Alonso A. J. Cell. Physiol. 2000; 184: 285-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar, 3.Ruiz-Argüello M.B. Basañez G. Goñi F.M. Alonso A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26616-26621Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar,14.Veiga M.P. Arrondo J.L.R. Goñi F.M. Alonso A. Biophys. J. 1999; 76: 342-350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar) that the tendency of ceramides to induce a “negative” curvature in the bilayer could be related to its membrane-restructuring properties (for the convention of negative and “positive” curvatures see (15.Helfrich W. Z. Naturforsch. 1973; 28: 693-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (5015) Google Scholar)). To test this hypothesis, we prepared LUV whose bilayers contained lysophosphatidylcholine, a lipid with the same headgroup as SM, but inducing a positive curvature because of its peculiar geometry. Fig. 5A shows the effect of lyso-PC on the passive efflux of ANTS induced by 5% ceramide (added in dodecane/ethanol) in SM:PE:Ch (2:1:1) bilayers. Lyso-PC caused a clear inhibition of ceramide-induced release that was particularly evident at longer incubation times (after 6 h). The effect when ceramide was enzymatically generated in the bilayer is interesting (Fig. 5B). Lyso-PC shifted the efflux curve toward longer times, i.e. a lag time of ∼200 s was observed. The simplest explanation is that while the number of ceramide molecules was smaller than that of lyso-PC molecules the geometric effects of each other were compensated, release starting only when the ceramide molecules “outnumbered” or overcame the opposite influence of lyso-PC. The main results in this paper concur in demonstrating that ceramides induce the rearrangement of lipid bilayers, irrespective of the method followed to bring them into the membrane. However, important differences in the kinetics and extent of efflux exist, according to the experimental procedures used. Thus there are two main topics for discussion in this context, the mechanism of bilayer restructuring, that may allow even the passage of macromolecules, and the concordance of the different experimental methods. In our previous studies (2.Kolesnick R.N. Goñi F.M. Alonso A. J. Cell. Physiol. 2000; 184: 285-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar, 3.Ruiz-Argüello M.B. Basañez G. Goñi F.M. Alonso A. J.

J. 1999; 76: 342-350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar) we have suggested that two properties of ceramides may be related to the release effect, namely the ceramide geometry, that promotes the negative curvature of a lipid monolayer and its tendency to form ceramide-rich domains segregated in the plane of the membrane. As a result of its geometrical constraints ceramide facilitates the lamellar-to-hexagonal transitions in lipid bilayers (3.Ruiz-Argüello M.B. Basañez G. Goñi F.M. Alonso A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26616-26621Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar,14.Veiga M.P. Arrondo J.L.R. Goñi F.M. Alonso A. Biophys. J. 1999; 76: 342-350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar), and such transitions, even if localized at certain points in the membrane, are likely to allow extensive communication between the inner and outer compartments. Perhaps not even the actual transition is required to take place, but the “propensity” (16.Epand R.M. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 7092-7095Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar) of the bilayer to adopt the hexagonal form is enough to destabilize transiently the bilayer. This would explain our observations (3.Ruiz-Argüello M.B. Basañez G. Goñi F.M. Alonso A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26616-26621Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) of efflux in the absence of nonlamellar signals in 31P NMR spectra. The role of ceramide geometry in promoting efflux is clearly supported by the data in Fig. 5, in which the presence of lyso-PC in the bilayers counteracts the effects of ceramide. In fact, the geometry of lyso-PC opposes that of ceramide, the former favoring positive curvature of monolayers, or, in other words, micelle formation (15.Helfrich W. Z. Naturforsch. 1973; 28: 693-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (5015) Google Scholar, 17.Israelachvili J.N. Marcelja S. Horn R.G. Q. Rev. Biophys. 1980; 13: 121-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (1147) Google Scholar). PE, a lipid that favors negative curvature, has the opposite effect than lyso-PC, i.e. it enhances the effect of ceramide. This is demonstrated by the higher efflux from SM:PE:Ch bilayers as compared with PC:Ch bilayers (other conditions being the same) (Table I). Note that SM forms more stable bilayers than PC, despite which SM:PE:Ch membranes are more easily reorganized by ceramide than PC:Ch ones. The lateral segregation of ceramide-rich domains in the plane of the membrane is another important mechanism that explains efflux. The phenomenon was first observed by Huang et al. (18.Huang H. Goldberg E.M. Zidovetzki R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 220: 834-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) and then reported, on the basis of different techniques, by Holopainen et al. (19.Holopainen J.M. Lehtonen J.Y.A. Kinnunen P.K.J. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1997; 88: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 20.Holopainen J.M. Brockman H.L. Brown R.E. Kinnunen P.K. Biophys. J. 2001; 80: 765-775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), Carrer and Maggio (21.Carrer D.C. Maggio B. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 1978-1989Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and Veiga et al.(14.Veiga M.P. Arrondo J.L.R. Goñi F.M. Alonso A. Biophys. J. 1999; 76: 342-350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Ceramides have much higher melting points than SM (≈80 °C versus ≈40 °C) (22.Shah J. Atienza J.M. Duclos R.I. Rawlings A.V. Dong Z. Shipley G.G. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 1936-1944Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Consequently, at 37 °C the ceramide-rich domains constitute rigid islands in a sea of fluid lipid. Co-existing ordered and disordered domains is a well known condition that allows efflux to occur (23.Papahadjopoulos D. Jacobson K. Nir S. Isac T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1973; 311: 330-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (832) Google Scholar). The interfaces between ceramide-rich and -poor regions could give rise to the observed release of vesicle contents. It is interesting in this context that C2ceramides did not elicit efflux under our conditions (Table I, bottom lines). Huang et al. (18.Huang H. Goldberg E.M. Zidovetzki R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 220: 834-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) observed that C16-ceramide, but not C2-ceramide, gave rise to in-plane phase separations according to their NMR measurements. The fact that enzyme-derived ceramide induces very fast efflux is also in agreement with the hypothesis that lateral separation of ceramide-rich domains is at the origin of release (see below). In summary, the data in this paper are in agreement with the idea that ceramide lateral segregation and ceramide tendency to induce nonlamellar lipid phases can jointly explain bilayer restructuring by ceramides. Note that, in our view, the most likely mode for solute efflux from vesicles is through transient, irregular interfaces between ceramide-rich and -poor domains or may be through local destabilization points adopting short-lived nonlamellar structures, rather than through well structured channels. Of the various reports describing ceramide-induced restructuring of membranes (see Introduction), those involving C2-ceramide, notably the work by Di Paola et al. (6.Di Paola M. Cocco T. Lorusso M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 6660-6668Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar) and by Simon and Gear (4.Simon C.G. Gear R.L. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 2059-2069Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), should be analyzed separately. Di Paola et al. (6.Di Paola M. Cocco T. Lorusso M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 6660-6668Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar) showed that C2-ceramide can dissipate the inner mitochondrial membrane potential. Simon and Gear (4.Simon C.G. Gear R.L. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 2059-2069Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) observed actual lysis of platelets at ceramide:lipid ratios of 0.5. This, together with the structure of C2-ceramide, very similar to lyso-PC or to palmitoylcarnitine (24.Requero M.A. Goñi F.M. Alonso A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10400-10405Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), suggests that C2 may have detergent properties, so that its efflux-inducing and lytic properties could occur, particularly at high ceramide:lipid ratios, through a mechanism different from that of the long chain ceramides. It is noteworthy that, under our conditions, low proportions (10 mol %) of C2 did not induce efflux, while the longer chain C6-ceramide was more active in this respect. Work from this and other laboratories (25.Ruiz-Argüello M.B. Goñi F.M. Alonso A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22977-22982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 26.Goñi F.M.

J. 2000; 78: 830-838Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar) has shown that the transmembrane asymmetry of ceramide distribution is very important in the induction of membrane reorganization in liposomes. Bai and Pagano (28.Bai J. Pagano R.E. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 8840-8848Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar) have estimated the t½ for the transbilayer movement of a fluorescent ceramide derivative at ≈22 min, and additional data support the idea that natural ceramides should have flip-flop t½ values of the same order of magnitude. However, short chain (e.g. C2) ceramides are expected to have significantly faster transbilayer movements. In our experiments, ceramides are added to, or generated in, the outer monolayer of the liposomal membrane, thus a clearly asymmetric distribution of the natural ceramides may be expected at least for the initial stages of our observations, when efflux is faster. With C2 ceramide, transbilayer equilibration may be much faster, and distribution consequently symmetric, contributing to the observed lack of effect. Nevertheless, a specific investigation of the surfactant properties of C2-ceramide and of its dehydro derivative is required to clarify this matter. Release induced by long chain ceramides has been explicitely shown by Ruiz-Argüello et al. (3.Ruiz-Argüello M.B. Basañez G. Goñi F.M. Alonso A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26616-26621Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) and by Siskind and Colombini (7.Siskind L.J. Colombini M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38640-38644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). In the former case ceramide was generated in situ by enzymatic cleavage of SM, in the latter case it was mixed in organic solvent with the other bilayer components prior to membrane formation. Ruiz-Argüello et al. (3.Ruiz-Argüello M.B. Basañez G. Goñi F.M. Alonso A. J. Biol.

The “large, stable channels” observed by Siskind and Colombini (7.Siskind L.J. Colombini M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38640-38644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar) in the presence of 5% C16-ceramide pose a problem. Theoretical calculations predict (29.Schwarz G. Robert C.H. Biophys. J. 1990; 58: 577-583Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) that a vesicle of our size (∼100 nm) containing one of those channels would become empty in less than 10−2 s. But the fact is that, as just mentioned, efflux takes place slowly for many hours. The answer to the paradox must rely on intrinsic aspects of the respective techniques. We may suggest, among others, that electric measurements detect individual events, while fluorescence is reporting on the overall effect. The surface area of a typical planar membrane compared with that of one liposome shows a difference of roughly 6 orders of magnitude. The observation of one permeability pathway in a planar membrane experiment would then correspond to one permeability pathway in 106 liposomes. The formation of one permeability pathway in 106 liposomes would not be detected by the fluorescence method, but one pathway in one planar membrane would elicit an electric signal. It should also be considered that the precise electric signal given by a channel whose size will allow passage of ANTS/DPX cannot be accurately predicted. Moreover the results from planar lipid membranes may be influenced by residual solvent. Finally, LUV may display curvature effects that are lost in the planar membranes. Other methodological aspects are also relevant when measuring release, e.g. dodecane-ethanol leads to more efflux than warm ethanol, for reasons that are probably related to ceramide solubility. Also significant is the fact that 10% ceramide generated by sphingomyelinase leads to a faster and larger efflux than the same amount introduced in organic solvent (cf. Figs.2B and 4A and Table I). This, together with the very fast and extensive release at higher ceramide proportions (Fig. 3), suggests that enzyme generation of ceramide is a localized process, occurring whenever a sphingomyelinase molecule binds the membrane and goes beyond the lag period (30.Ruiz-Argüello, M. B., Veiga, M. P., Arrondo, J. L. R., Goñi, F. M., and Alonso, A. (2001) Chem. Phys. Lipids, in pressGoogle Scholar). The ensuing rapid hydrolysis generates a ceramide-rich microdomain, thus an interdomain interface through which efflux is facilitated (see above). On the contrary, addition of ceramide in organic solvent may give rise to a more even distribution of that lipid in the bilayer, release becoming secondary to the process of ceramide lateral segregation and domain formation. The above observations in model membranes may be relevant in understanding ceramide-mediated processes at the cellular level. However, a degree of caution must be exerted when comparing experimental data from cell and model membranes. One important issue is the actual concentration of ceramide in living mammalian cells and the change in ceramide concentrations upon activation. The overall concentration of ceramide in cells is smaller, by 2–3 orders of magnitude, than the one used in our experiments, and activation of ceramide-dependent pathways leads only to a modest increase in overall concentration (31.Hannun Y.A. Science. 1996; 274: 1855-1859Crossref PubMed Scopus (1500) Google Scholar), but average figures of lipid composition may hide the localized existence of ceramide-rich domains. In fact, ceramide signaling is believed to occur in small well defined regions of the cell membranes (rafts, caveolae) (2.Kolesnick R.N. Goñi F.M. Alonso A. J. Cell. Physiol. 2000; 184: 285-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar, 32.Simons K. Ikonen E. Science. 2000; 290: 1721-1726Crossref PubMed Scopus (1078) Google Scholar). Our experimental system is not intended to mimic the whole plasma or outer mitochondrial membrane, but only those sphingolipid-rich domains where ceramide signaling is localized. Another interesting point concerns the miscibility of ceramide in the biologically relevant liquid-crystalline phospholipid bilayers present in mammalian cells at 37 °C. Differential scanning calorimetry studies using DPPC or DEPE bilayers have shown lateral separation of ceramide-rich domains with as little as 1–5 mol % ceramide (14.Veiga M.P. Arrondo J.L.R. Goñi F.M. Alonso A. Biophys. J. 1999; 76: 342-350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 21.Carrer D.C. Maggio B. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 1978-1989Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, will these domains also form in the more complex and fluid cell membrane environment? Holopainen et al. (19.Holopainen J.M. Lehtonen J.Y.A. Kinnunen P.K.J. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1997; 88: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 33.Holopainen J.M. Subramanian M. Kinnunen P.K.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 17562-17570Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar) found ceramide-rich domain formation both inl-α-dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine and in the much more fluid 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoylphosphatidylcholine bilayers. Moreover cell plasma membranes and outer mitochondrial membranes contain cholesterol, and hydrogen bonding between ceramide and cholesterol is important in stabilizing sphingolipid-rich domains (34.Patra S.K. Alonso A. Arrondo J.L.R. Goñi F.M. J. Liposome Res. 1999; 9: 247-260Crossref Scopus (55) Google Scholar,35.Xu A. Bittman R. Duportail G. Heissler D. Vilcheze C. London E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33450-33456Google Scholar). Thus we conclude that the lateral phase separation of ceramide-enriched domains observed in DPPC or DEPE bilayers may well occur in our model membranes, containing fluid phospholipids and cholesterol, and in cell membranes. Finally, we note that in our experiments efflux occurs in a protein-free system, while in the living cell, e.g. in the apoptotic process, proteins such as Bax and tcBcl-xL (the C-terminal fragment of Bcl-xL generated during apoptosis) permeabilize the outer mitochondrial membrane to cytochrome c (36.Gross A. McDonnell J.M. Korsmeyer S.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1899-1911Crossref PubMed Scopus (3263) Google Scholar, 37.Basáñez G. Zhang J. Chan N.B. Maksav G.I. Frolov V.A. Brandt T.A. Burch J. Hardwick J.M. Zimmerberg J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31083-31091Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). However, the nature of the apoptotic pore is unclear at present, and there are suggestions that the apoptotic proteins would induce formation of pores, composed at least partly by lipid, through changes in membrane curvature (38.Basáñez G. Nechushtan A. Drozhinin O. Chanturiya A. Choe E. Tutt S. Wood K.A. Hsu Y.-T. Zimmerberg J. Youle R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 5492-5497Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Our view of this matter is that the lipids alone, as shown in the present paper, may restructure to allow efflux of large molecules, but that, under physiological conditions, these processes will be catalyzed and modulated, both positively and negatively, by proteins. In conclusion, from the above results and discussion, it can be established that (i) ceramide induces the restructuring of the lipid bilayer allowing the passage of even large molecular weight compounds, (ii) both in situ generated and externally added ceramide induce an increased efflux in membranes, and (iii) in situ generation of ceramides by enzymatic cleavage of sphingomyelin leads to a faster and more extensive efflux than addition of the same amount of ceramide to a pre-existing membrane. We are indebted to Dr. R. N. Kolesnick for helpful comments and critical reading of the manuscript."

In this study, we examined the effect of environmental stresses on protein synthesis in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We found that osmotic stress causes irreversible inhibition of methionine uptake, transient inhibition of uracil uptake, transient stimulation of glucose uptake, transient repression of ribosomal protein (RP) genes such as CYH2 andRPS27, and the transient inhibition of translation initiation. Rapid inhibition of translation initiation by osmotic stress requires a novel pathway, different from the amino acid-sensing pathway, the glucose-sensing pathway, and the TOR pathway. The Hog1 MAP kinase pathway is not involved in the inhibition of either methionine uptake or translation initiation but is required for the adaptation of translation initiation after inhibition and the repression of RP genes by osmotic stress. These results suggest that the transient inhibition of translation initiation occurs as a result of a combination of both acute inhibition of translation and the long-term activation of translation by the Hog1 pathway.

Translation is governed by the interaction of a number of different structural elements of mRNAs and the translation machinery. In eukaryotes, regulation of translation is carried out by distinct factors that interact with specific regions in the individual mRNA sequence, mostly the 5′ or the 3′ untranslated region. General regulation is exercised via the modulation of the components of the translation machinery, which interact with common regions including the 5′ cap, the coding region, and poly(A) tail structures (1.McCarthy J.E.G. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 1492-1553Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2.Pain V.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 236: 747-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar). For general regulation of translation initiation, many signals, such as serum, PDGF, insulin, phorbol ester, EGF, and others, stimulate translation in eukaryotic cells. Other signals, such as virus infection, vasopressin, heat shock, and deprivation of serum or amino acids, are known to inhibit translation initiation in eukaryotes (2.Pain V.M. Eur. J.

This results in the inhibition of translation initiation, and growth is arrested in early G1 phase. Loss of the TOR function also causes translational inhibition and induces physiological changes characteristic of nutrient-starved G0 cells. Thus, the TOR kinase controls cell growth by sensing environmental nutrients (6.Barbet N.C. Schneider U. Helliwell S.B. Stansfield I. Tuite M.F. Hall M.N. Mol. Biol.

The HOG (high osmolarity glycerol) pathway is known to be rapidly stimulated by high osmolarity. The HOG pathway contains two transmembrane osmosensors, Sho1 and Sln1. Sho1 acts on Ste11 MAPKKK (MAP kinase kinase kinase), and the two-component system that includes Sln1 stimulates Ssk2/Ssk22 MAPKKK, resulting in the activation of Pbs2 MAPKK, which in turn activates Hog1 MAPK (18.Brewster J.L. de Valoir T.

The Hog1 MAPK pathway is necessary for the expression of specific genes for adaptation to high osmolarity, such as GPD1, which encodes cytosolic glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (15.Albertyn J.

Recently, genome-wide DNA chip analysis has shown that the Hog1 MAPK pathway regulates the expression of many genes in addition to GPD1in response to high osmolarity (12.Posas F. Chambers J.R.

However, it remains unclear which steps of translation are inhibited by osmotic stress, and it is not known whether the Hog1 MAPK pathway contributes to these phenomena.

The plasmid pSUI2-S51A was constructed by inserting the PCR product of the SUI2 open reading frame that has the mutation of Ser-51 to Ala in Sui2p and a deletion of the 5′ portion into the pJJ215 vector (31.Jones J.S.

Maeda (Institute of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences, University of Tokyo). Cells were grown in SD-Met medium (0.67% yeast nitrogen base, 2% glucose, with appropriate supplements omitting methionine) or SRaf-Ura (0.67% yeast nitrogen base, 2% raffinose, with appropriate supplements omitting uracil) at 25 °C or 30 °C. When the A600 m of cultures reached 0.15, NaCl was added to the final indicated concentrations. After cells were collected at the indicated times, the rates of both uptake of methionine and protein synthesis were measured by the pulse labeling method (6.Barbet N.C. Schneider U. Helliwell S.B. Stansfield I. Tuite M.F. Hall M.N. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 25-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar). Briefly, 0.02 A600 nm equivalents of cultures grown in SD medium without methionine were removed at each time point and pulse-labeled for 5 min at 25 °C with 2 μCi of [35S]methionine (Amersham Biosciences). For measuring trichloroacetic acid-precipitated counts as a gross protein synthesis rate, half of the reaction mixtures were mixed with the same amount of 20% trichloroacetic acid and boiled for 5 min. Insoluble material was collected by filtration through a GF/B filter (Whatman) and washed first with an excess amount of ice-cold 10% trichloroacetic acid and then with ethanol. For the cell-associated counts, the remaining half of the reaction mixture was mixed with 10 volumes of ice-cold water, collected on a GF/B filter and then washed with an excess amount of ice-cold water. These trichloroacetic acid-precipitated and cell-associated counts were quantified using a Beckman LS6000IC liquid scintillation counter. The relative uptake rates were calculated as [the cell-associated counts at the indicated times]/[those at time zero] or [the cell-associated counts at the indicated concentrations of NaCl]/[those at 0 m NaCl]. The accurate protein synthesis rate was calculated as the ratio of trichloroacetic acid-precipitated counts to cell-associated counts of the same aliquots. For measurement of uracil uptake, the cultures grown in SD-Ura supplemented with 1 μg/ml uracil were pulse-labeled for 5 min at 25 °C with 2 μCi of [3H]uracil (ICN). For measurement of glucose uptake, the cultures grown in YPD (2% polypeptone, 1% yeast extract, 2% glucose) were pulse-labeled for 2 min at 25 °C with 0.6 μCi ofd-[U-14C]glucose (Amersham Biosciences). Cells were grown in 300 ml of YPD medium at 25 °C. When the A600 nm of cultures reached 0.5, NaCl or rapamycin (6.Barbet N.C. Schneider U. Helliwell S.B. Stansfield I. Tuite M.F. Hall M.N. Mol. Biol.

For deprivation of amino acids (−aa) or glucose (−Glu), the cells were immediately collected by centrifugation and washed once with SD medium (−aa) or YP medium (−Glu), respectively. The washed cells were resuspended in the same media used for washing and further incubated. Fifty ml of culture was removed and immediately chilled on ice for monosome subunit analysis. For polysome analysis, cycloheximide was added to the culture to a final concentration of 100 μg/ml, and the mixture was immediately chilled on ice. Extracts for polysome and monosome subunit analysis were prepared, and fractionation of ribosomes was performed by sucrose gradient centrifugation with (32.Baim S.B. Pietras D.F. Eustice D.C. Sherman F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 1839-1846Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) or without Mg2+(33.Zhu S. Wek R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1808-1814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Each sample, containing 10 or 5 A260 nmunits, was layered onto 12 ml of a continuous 7–47% sucrose gradient made by Gradient MateTM (Towa Kagaku), and ultracentrifugation was performed using a Beckman rotor SW41 at 40,000 rpm for 2.5 h (polysomes) or 3.5 h (monosome subunits) at 4 °C. Gradients were fractionated using an ALC-20 automatic liquid charger (Advantec) and an Amersham Biosciences FPLC system at 254 nm (34.Uesono Y. Toh-e A. Kikuchi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16103-16109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The DNA content in the extract was determined by a method using Hoechst 33258, which specifically binds DNA (35.Labarca C. Paigen K. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 102: 344-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (4553) Google Scholar). The enhancement of fluorescence was analyzed by F-2000 spectrofluorometer (Hitachi). The polysome/monosome ratio was determined as the ratio of the areas of 2–4-mer polysomes to the areas of 80 S monosomes using NIH Image (developed and maintained by the National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). Total RNAs were isolated at the indicated time points, separated by electrophoresis as described previously (36.Köhrer K. Domdey H. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 398-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar), and probed with RPS27B, CYH2, GPD1, CTT1,and ACT. The signals were detected using a phosphorimaging device (Fuji BAS-1000). The following gene probes were used: a 1.2-kbSphI-SalI RPS27B fragment, a 1.5-kbSphI-SalI CYH2 fragment, a 1.8-kbSphI-BamHI GPD1 fragment, an 0.6-kbCTT1 EcoRI fragment, and an 0.7-kb ACT1 XhoI-HindIII fragment, prepared from the plasmids CTF3M-27B, CTF3M-CYH2, CTF-GPD1, SK-CTT1, and pACT1(donated by K. Kamada), respectively. To find a novel signal that regulates the general translation machinery, we first investigated the effects of several environmental stresses on protein synthesis by pulse labeling. As shown in Fig. 1A (left), the rates of methionine uptake were decreased by a shift to 37 °C and by treatment with 0.4 mm H2O2or 1 m NaCl, and it did not recover to the initial level during the experimental periods. Because the uptake of [35S]methionine decreased, decreases in the trichloroacetic acid-precipitated counts in an aliquot of cells might reflect this decrease in uptake rather than a decrease in protein synthesis during stress. For this reason, we instead used the ratio of trichloroacetic acid-precipitated 35S to cell-associated35S (trichloroacetic acid/uptake) in each aliquot as the rate of protein synthesis. The initial ratio of methionine converted from the free form to the polypeptide-associated form was ∼0.2–0.4 (Fig. 1, A and B, right panels), which is consistent with what has been reported previously (9.Varela J.C. van Beekvelt C. Planta R.J. Mager W.H. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 2183-2190Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Theright panel of Fig. 1A shows that the rates of protein synthesis decreased 15 min after exposure to the NaCl stress and recovered to the initial level at 120 min, whereas protein synthesis did not decrease after exposure to heat shock stress or oxidative stress. Among the stresses examined, NaCl treatment was more prominent than other stresses in having an affect on protein synthesis. We therefore further examined the effect of NaCl concentration on methionine uptake and protein synthesis. The rates of methionine uptake decreased as the concentration of NaCl increased and did not recover to the initial level during further incubation (Fig. 1B,left), indicating that NaCl inhibits the uptake of methionine irreversibly. In contrast, the ability to take up [3H]uracil decreased at 30 min after NaCl treatment and recovered to the initial level at 120 min (Fig. 1C), indicating that the inhibition of uracil uptake by NaCl is transient. Similarly, the rates of protein synthesis also decreased rapidly but recovered to their initial levels irrespective of the concentration of NaCl (Fig. 1B, right). Because methionine uptake decreases upon stress and does not recover, the inhibition of amino acid uptake by stress may participate in the inhibition of protein synthesis but not in its recovery. Varela et al. (9.Varela J.C. van Beekvelt C. Planta R.J. Mager W.H. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 2183-2190Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) also reported a decrease in methionine uptake by moderate osmotic stress such as 0.7 m NaCl. However, they reported that the inhibition was transient, whereas our results indicate that the inhibition of methionine uptake by moderate osmotic stress such as 0.6 or 0.8 m NaCl is irreversible. Next we examined the roles of the Pbs2 and Hog1 kinases in the NaCl-induced inhibition of nutrient uptake and protein synthesis. The rates of methionine uptake in both thepbs2 and the hog1 disruptants decreased after NaCl treatment and did not recover during further incubation, similar to the results seen in the wild-type strain (Fig. 2A). In contrast to the case of methionine, the rates of glucose uptake in the wild type increased transiently after NaCl treatment, whereas those in the hog1disruptant decreased gradually (Fig. 2C). These results indicate that NaCl stress inhibits the uptake of methionine independently of the Hog1 MAPK pathway, whereas it stimulates the uptake of glucose in a Hog1 MAP kinase-dependent manner. The rate of protein synthesis decreased after NaCl treatment but recovered to the initial level in the wild-type strain after further incubation in the presence of NaCl (Fig. 2B). This resumption of protein synthesis after its inhibition by NaCl represents adaptation. Protein synthesis was inhibited in the pbs2 andhog1 disruptants, as it was in the wild type after NaCl treatment, but the rate of protein synthesis in both mutant strains only recovered to about half of that in wild type (Fig. 2B). These results indicate that the Hog1 MAPK pathway is not involved in the stress-induced inhibition of protein synthesis but seems to stimulate the recovery of protein synthesis after it is inhibited. Next, we examined whether the Hog1 MAPK pathway can stimulate protein synthesis in the absence of stress. The pbs2 disruptant expressing PBS2DD, an active form ofPBS2, showed no remarkable change in the rate of protein synthesis in comparison with cells expressing PBS2 (Fig. 2D). This result suggests that the Hog1 MAPK pathway does not simply activate protein synthesis but is involved in the adaptation of protein synthesis after stress-induced inhibition. To distinguish whether the NaCl treatment inhibited the initiation or the elongation step of translation, we investigated polysome profiles when cells were exposed to osmotic stresses. After cycloheximide was added to the culture to arrest translation elongation and preserve the polysomes during preparation of samples, sucrose sedimentation analysis of extracts was carried out. As shown in Fig. 3A, the polysome/monosome ratios at 15 min after exposure to the stress decreased as the concentration of NaCl increased. The reason that the effect of 0.8m NaCl was more prominent than that of 1 m NaCl may be because of the slow response of cells to 1 m NaCl as described below (Fig. 3, B and C). Because the decrease of the polysome/monosome ratio has been observed in several mutants defective in translation initiation (37.Valasek L. Trachsel H. Hasek J. Ruis H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21253-21260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 38.Welch E.M. Jacobson A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6134-6145Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 39.Hartwell L.H. McLaughlin C.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1969; 62: 468-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), our results indicate that the NaCl treatment inhibits the initiation of translation. Sorbitol also inhibited translation initiation (Fig. 3A), indicating that the inhibition is due to the osmotic stress and is not specific to NaCl. Next we examined the time course of the changes in the polysome profiles after the addition of NaCl. When wild-type cells were exposed to 0.6 m NaCl, a reduction of the polysome/monosome ratio began at 2 min, reached a minimum level at 15 min, and recovered to the initial level at 120 min (Fig. 3B). The reduction of the polysome/monosome ratio of wild-type cells treated with 1 m NaCl was slower, reaching a minimum level at 30 min and recovering to the initial level at 120 min (Fig. 3C). Thus, we concluded that osmotic stress transiently inhibits translation initiation. When the hog1 disruptant was exposed to 0.6 or 1m NaCl, the polysome/monosome ratios decreased as in wild-type cells but did not recover to the initial level even at 180 min (Fig. 3, B and C). The pbs2disruptant showed a result similar to the hog1 disruptant (data not shown). These observations indicate that the Hog1 MAPK pathway is not involved in stress-induced translation inhibition but is required for adaptation of translation initiation after inhibition. In the case of treatment with 1 m NaCl, the peak of inhibition detected by the analysis of polysome profiles was at 30 min (Fig. 3C), whereas that detected by pulse labeling was around 5–15 min (Fig. 1A, right panel; Fig. 2B). This time difference is possibly because of the different media used for the experiments: YPD complete medium was used for the analysis of polysome profiles, and SD synthetic medium was used for pulse labeling. It is also possible that the adaptation defect in the hog1disruptant is a secondary effect resulting from the partial inhibition of the glucose-sensing pathway that tightly regulates translation initiation, as described in Fig. 4A. The uptake rate of glucose in the hog1 disruptant was about half that in the wild-type strain after 1 m NaCl treatment (Fig. 2C). However, the polysome/monosome ratios of wild-type cells did not decrease at 2 h as the hog1 disruptant did, even if the glucose content in the medium was changed from 2% to 0.2% (Fig. 3D). Therefore, the defect in adaptation of translation initiation seen in the hog1 disruptant is not due to a decrease in glucose uptake. To understand the mechanism of the transient inhibition more precisely, the monosome subunit analysis was performed in sucrose gradients lacking Mg2+, leading to the dissociation of 80 S ribosomes into 40 and 60 S subunits and ribosome-free mRNAs (Fig. 3E). The ratios of 40 and 60 S subunits did not change remarkably at 30 min after 1 m NaCl treatment in either the wild-type or the hog1 disruptant. The DNA contents in 5A260 nm units before and at 30 min after 1m NaCl treatment were 14.5 and 13.0 μg, respectively. These results suggest that osmotic stress does not change the contents of the ribosome subunits per cell during translation inhibition. Fractions between the 40 and 60 S particles containing the 43–48 S initiation complex increased, and the 40 S fraction decreased at 2 h after osmotic shock in the wild-type strain but not in thehog1 disruptant (arrows in Fig. 3E). This suggests that the initiation complex is formed anew during the adaptation to osmotic stress and that Hog1 MAP kinase may also be required for formation of the initiation complex during the adaptation process. Both depletion of amino acids or glucose from the medium and rapamycin treatment are known to cause the inhibition of translational initiation (1.McCarthy J.E.G. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 1492-1553Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4.Ashe M.P. De Long S.K. Sachs A.B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 833-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). To investigate whether osmotic stress inhibits translation initiation through these pathways, we examined polysome profiles using mutant strains in these pathways (Fig. 4A). Indeed, because osmotic stress decreases the uptake of methionine, as described in Fig. 2A, it is possible that amino acid starvation inhibits translation ini"

Whereas PABP2 is a major component of the inclusions in OPMD, the pathogenic mechanisms causing disease are unknown. Here we show that polyalanine expansions in PABP2 cause increased numbers of inclusions and enhance death in COS-7 cells. We observed similar increases of protein aggregation and cell death with nuclear-targeted green fluorescent protein linked to longer versus shorter polyalanine stretches. Intranuclear aggregates in our OPMD cell model were associated with heat shock protein (HSP) 40 (HDJ-1) and HSP70. Human HDJ-1, yeast hsp104, a bacterially derived GroEL minichaperone, and the chemical chaperone Me2SO reduced both aggregation and cell death in our OPMD model without affecting the levels of PABP2, and similar trends were seen with green fluorescent protein with long polyalanine stretches. Thus, polyalanine expansion mutations in different protein contexts cause proteins to misfold/aggregate and kill cells. The situation in OPMD appears to have many parallels with polyglutamine diseases, raising the possibility that misfolded, aggregate-prone proteins may perturb similar pathways, irrespective of the nature of the mutation or protein context.

In PABP2, (GCG)6 codes for the first 6 alanines in a homopolymeric stretch of 10 alanines. Thus, disease is associated with expansions of 12–17 uninterrupted alanines in this protein (2.Brais B. Bouchard J.P. Xie Y.G. Rochefort D.L. Chretien N. Tome F.M. Lafreniere R.G. Rommens J.M. Uyama E. Nohira O. Nat. Genet. 1998; 8: 164-167Crossref Scopus (626) Google Scholar). PABP2 is a predominantly nuclear protein that is normally found in nuclear speckles. It binds poly(A) mRNA with high affinity and plays a role in mRNA polyadenylation and control of the length of poly(A) tails (3.Calado A. Carmo-Fonseca M. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 2309-2318PubMed Google Scholar). The pathogenic process mediated by the PABP2 polyalanine expansion mutation is unclear. One possibility is that the expansion results in a misfolded protein with an increased propensity for aggregation. PABP2 is a major component of the intranuclear inclusions in this disease (4.Becher M.W. Kotzuk J.A. Davis L.E. Bear D.G. Ann.

Brais B. Rouleau G.A. Ann. Neurol. 2000; 48: 798-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) reported that PABP2 with expanded repeats fused to green fluorescent protein (GFP) forms aggregates in COS-7 cells, which were not observed with wild-type constructs. We previously observed that cells overexpressing 19 or 37 alanine repeats fused to GFP showed cytoplasmic aggregate formation and increased cell death, compared with GFP with 7 alanines, which did not aggregate (8.Rankin J. Wyttenbach A. Rubinsztein D.C. Biochem. J. 2000; 348: 15-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). However, the relevance of a model of cytoplasmic polyalanine inclusion formation to PABP2, where inclusions are intranuclear, is unclear. In this study, we have tested four related hypotheses. First, PABP2 with expanded polyalanines is more aggregate-prone than the wild-type protein. Second, the formation of aggregates of PABP2 is associated with cell death. Third, polyalanine expansion mutations in an unrelated nuclear protein can also form aggregates that are associated with cell death. One of the ways cells handle misfolded and aggregate-prone proteins is to refold them using molecular chaperones like certain heat shock proteins (9.Sherman M.Y. Goldberg A.L. Neuron. 2001; 29: 15-32Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (869) Google Scholar). Because chaperones can reduce aggregation of another class of codon reiteration mutations, namely, polyglutamine expansions seen in conditions such as Huntington's disease (e.g. Refs.9.Sherman M.Y.

Here we show that mammalian, yeast, and bacterial chaperones can reduce aggregation of mutant PABP2. Expression vectors encoding fusion proteins of EGFP with wild-type bovine PABP2 (with 10 alanines; PABP2-A10) and mutated bovine PABP2 (with 17 alanines; PABP2-A17) were made by subcloning the respective PABP2 cDNAs from the pGM10-His6/bovPABP2 wt and pGM10-His6/bovPABP2 7ala prokaryotic expression vectors (kindly provided by Prof. Elmar Wahle; Halle, Germany) into the pEGFP-C1 vector (CLONTECH). pGM10-PABP2 was cut with NdeI, and the recessed 3′ ends were filled. The linear plasmid was then cut with BamHI to release the respective PABP2 cDNA fragments. The PABP2 wt and PABP2+7ala fragments were purified and ligated to the SmaI-BamHI sites of pEGFP-C1. All constructs were validated by DNA sequencing. Bovine PABP2 differs from its human orthologue by 2 of 306 amino acids (15.Nemeth A. Krause S. Blank D. Jenny A. Jeno P. Lustig A. Wahle E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4034-4041Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar).

Wyttenbach A. Rubinsztein D.C. Biochem. J. 2000; 348: 15-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). These constructs were named GFP-NLS-A7, GFP-NLS-A19, and GFP-NLS-A37, respectively. African green monkey kidney cells (COS-7) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin, 2 mml-glutamine, and 1 mm sodium pyruvate at 37 °C in 5% CO2. For transfection, cells were seeded on coverslips at 0.6–1 × 105 cells/well in 6-well plates the day before transfection. A mixture of 10 μl of LipofectAMINE reagent (Invitrogen) and 2 μg of endotoxin-free plasmid DNA was added to the cells at 50–80% confluence in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. The transfection mixture was replaced by full-serum culture medium after 5 h of incubation at 37 °C. In co-transfection experiments, pFlag-CMV-2 (Sigma) or pFlag-CMV-2 constructs expressing full-length human HDJ-1 (12.Chai Y. Koppenhafer S.L. Bonini N.M. Paulson H.L. J.

Cells were transfected with 0.4 μg of GFP construct and 1.6 μg of the appropriate chaperone or empty vector DNA per well to ensure that all cells expressing the GFP fusion proteins also expressed the appropriate chaperone proteins. At 48, 72, and 96 h after transfection, cells on coverslips were washed with 1× PBS, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in 1× PBS for 30 min, and mounted in antifadent supplemented with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; 3 μg/ml) to allow visualization of nuclear morphology. For Western blotting, cell pellets were lysed in Laemmli buffer (0.0625m Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 5% β-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol, and 0.01% bromphenol blue). Lysates were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel (15%) electrophoresis and transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). Primary antibodies were used at 1:1000 (rabbit polyclonal anti-PABP2 antibody; kindly provided by Dr. Elmar Wahle) and 1:2000 (mouse monoclonal anti-GFP antibody; CLONTECH). Blots were probed with peroxidase-labeled anti-rabbit or anti-mouse antibodies at 1:2000 (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). For detection, enhanced chemiluminescence reagent (ECL; Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) was used, and the signal was detected by exposing the membrane to x-ray film. For immunocytochemistry, COS-7 cells were grown on coverslips for 16–24 h and transfected with PABP2-A17 construct. 48 h after transfection, cells were washed and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 20 min and permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS for 15 min. After three washes with PBS, cells were incubated in blocking buffer (5% fetal bovine serum) for 30 min at room temperature. Primary antibody incubation was carried out for 1 h at room temperature. Antibodies were rabbit polyclonal anti-HDJ-1 antibody (SPA-400; StressGene Biotechnologies, Victoria, British Columbia, Canada), mouse monoclonal anti-HSP70 antibody (SPA-810; StressGene Biotechnologies), rabbit polyclonal anti-20 S proteasome antibody (Affiniti, Exeter, United Kingdom), and rabbit monoclonal anti-ubiquitin antibody (Chemicon, Harrow, United Kingdom). Antibodies were used at 1:500 for 1 h at room temperature and washed in 1× PBS three times. Then cells were incubated with either goat anti-mouse IgG or goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to Texas Red or Alexa 488 (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) for 1 h in the dark at room temperature (1:2000), washed three times in PBS, dried, and mounted in antifadent containing DAPI (see above). Samples were observed using a confocal microscope. Aggregate formation and nuclear morphology were assessed with a fluorescence microscope. 200 EGFP-expressing cells across the center region of the slides were counted (with the observer blinded to slide identity). We assessed the proportions of PABP2- or GFP-NLS-A- expressing cells that contained one or more inclusions. We considered cells to have inclusions if the GFP was abnormally concentrated and differed from the diffuse nuclear pattern seen with GFP-NLS-A7 or the nuclear speckled appearance typically seen with PABP2-A7. The nuclear morphology of COS-7 cells was analyzed using DAPI staining and was considered abnormal if the nuclei were fragmented or condensed to a small size with a much stronger fluorescence signal when compared with normal nuclei (apoptotic nuclei). Pooled estimates for the changes in inclusion formation resulting from perturbations assessed in multiple experiments were calculated as odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals ((percentage of cells expressing construct with inclusions under perturbation conditions/percentage of cells expressing construct without inclusions under perturbation conditions)/(percentage of cells expressing construct with inclusions under control conditions/percentage of cells expressing construct without inclusions under control conditions)). ORs were considered to be the most appropriate summary statistics because the percentage of cells with inclusions or nuclear abnormalities under the specified conditions varied between experiments on different days, whereas the relative change in the proportion of cells with inclusions or nuclear abnormalities induced by overexpression of an HSP is expected to be more constant. OR and p values were determined by unconditional logistical regression analysis using the general log linear analysis option of SPSS Version 6.1 software (SPSS, Chicago, IL). We have modeled OPMD in COS-7 cells by transiently overexpressing PABP2 with 10 (wild-type; PABP2-A10) or 17 alanines (mutant; PABP2-A17) fused to the C terminus of EGFP. These fusion proteins migrated on SDS-PAGE gels at the expected molecular masses, and cells transfected with the mutant and wild-type constructs expressed comparable levels of PABP2 after 48 h (Fig. 1A). Such EGFP-PABP2 (wild-type) fusions have been previously shown to localize appropriately to nuclear speckles and allow us to discriminate between wild-type transgene products and endogenous PABP2 (3.Calado A. Carmo-Fonseca M. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 2309-2318PubMed Google Scholar). Also, Shanmugam et al. (7.Shanmugam V. Dion P. Rochefort D. Laganiere J. Brais B. Rouleau G.A. Ann. Neurol. 2000; 48: 798-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) studied PABP2-GFP fusions previously in COS-7 cells. In our initial experiments, we transfected cells with 2 μg DNA/well in a 6-well plate. Whereas cells expressing PABP2-A17 formed more inclusions compared with cells expressing PABP2-A10, this was not significant (Fig. 2). Fig. 3 shows normal localization of PABP2-A10 to structures that look like the nuclear speckles described previously (3.Calado A. Carmo-Fonseca M. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 2309-2318PubMed Google Scholar) and a typical aggregate formed by PABP2-A17. As reported previously, PABP2-containing speckles are excluded from the nucleoli (3.Calado A. Carmo-Fonseca M. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 2309-2318PubMed Google Scholar). The aggregates formed by PABP2 exclude DAPI and thus are probably largely devoid of DNA, as is the case in vivo (6.Calado A. Tome F.M. Brais B. Rouleau G.A. Kuhn U. Wahle E. Carmo-Fonseca M. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 2321-2328Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). As expected, both PABP2 constructs were localized to the nucleus (Fig. 3).Figure 3GFP fluorescence patterns in COS-7 cells transiently transfected with the GFP-PABP2 constructs. Cells were grown on coverslips for 48 h after transfection and fixed, and the nuclei were stained with DAPI (blue). The nuclear inclusions appear as bright EGFP (green) (PABP2-A17) signals that exclude DAPI, compared with the normal PABP2 expression pattern in nuclear speckles (PABP2-A10).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We hypothesized that wild-type PABP2 may make aggregates if it is expressed at a high concentration. Thus, we transfected cells with 0.6 or 0.2 μg of DNA to reduce the expression levels of exogenous PABP2. At these lower expression levels, PABP2-A17 made significantly more inclusions compared with PABP2-A10 (Fig. 2A). At all concentrations, PABP2-A17 caused more cell death (as judged by nuclear fragmentation and condensation, which are generally used to ascertain and quantify apoptotic nuclei) than PABP2-A10 (Fig. 2B). The lack of a neat dose response in the experiments in Fig. 2, A and B, may be because the experiments at different doses were not all performed at the same time. To test whether the effects of the PABP2 polyalanine expansion were largely dependent on the protein context surrounding the mutation, we transfected cells with constructs expressing 7, 19, or 37 alanines fused to the C terminus of EGFP linked to an SV40 nuclear localization signal (GFP-NLS-A7, GFP-NLS-A19, and GFP-NLS-A37). SDS-PAGE revealed proteins of the expected molecular masses (Fig. 1B). GFP-NLS-A7 typically produced diffuse intranuclear fluorescence, with only rare intranuclear aggregates (Figs. 2 and 4). GFP-NLS-A19 formed significantly more aggregates than GFP-NLS-A7 and localized to the nucleus in cells with and without aggregates. GFP-NLS-A37 was localized to the nucleus in cells without visible aggregates. However, in virtually all cells with GFP-NLS-A37 aggregates, these formed as a halo in the cytoplasm around the nucleus (Fig. 4). About 5–10% of GFP-NLS-A37 aggregate-containing cells had aggregates concentrated in a juxtanuclear location reminiscent of the aggresome (17.Johnston J.A. Ward C. Kopito R.R. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1883-1898Crossref PubMed Scopus (1748) Google Scholar). Cytoplasmic aggregates may have formed with GFP-NLS-A37 because the 37 alanines can cause rapid aggregation of the newly translated protein into polymeric forms, which are too large to pass through nuclear pores, even though these constructs have an NLS that functions effectively for soluble forms of the protein. The aggregates formed by PABP2-A17 were decorated with antibodies to ubiquitin and the 20 S proteasome component, as described in vivo for OPMD aggregates (6.Calado A. Tome F.M. Brais B. Rouleau G.A. Kuhn U. Wahle E. Carmo-Fonseca M. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 2321-2328Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar), suggesting that the cells recognize these proteins as being abnormally folded (Fig. 5). One of the ways that cells deal with abnormally folded and aggregate-prone proteins is to try to refold them into appropriate conformations with molecular chaperones, such as HSPs (18.Fink A.L. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 425-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar). The aggregates formed in our cell model were decorated by antibodies to HSP70 and HDJ-1, an HSP40 family member (Fig. 5). To test whether heat shock proteins can regulate the formation of aggregates caused by polyalanine mutations, we used the human HSP40 member HDJ-1. We used this HSP because its overexpression consistently reduces the aggregation of different poly(Q) proteins (11.Chan H.Y. Warrick J.M. Gray-Board G.L. Paulson H.L. Bonini N.M. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 2811-2820Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar, 12.Chai Y. Koppenhafer S.L. Bonini N.M. Paulson H.L. J.

Pooled estimates for the changes in inclusion formation (or cell death) resulting from perturbations assessed in multiple experiments were calculated as ORs with 95% confidence intervals ((percentage of cells expressing construct with inclusions under perturbation conditions/percentage of cells expressing construct without inclusions under perturbation conditions)/(percentage of cells expressing construct with inclusions under control conditions/percentage of cells expressing construct without inclusions under control conditions)). ORs were considered to be the most appropriate summary statistics because the percentage of cells with inclusions or nuclear abnormalities under specified conditions varied between experiments on different days, whereas the relative change in the proportion of cells with inclusions or nuclear abnormalities induced by overexpression of an HSP is expected to be more constant (10.Carmichael J.

Overexpression of HDJ-1 reduced both aggregation and cell death at 48, 72, and 96 h after transfection with PABP2-A17 (Fig. 6) and at 48 h after transfection with GFP-NLS-A19 and GFP-NLS-A37 (Fig. 7). HDJ-1 is a co-chaperone for HSP70, which can directly modulate cell death pathways (20.Beere H.M. Green D.R. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 6-10Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). Indeed, Zhou et al. (21.Zhou H. Li S.H Li X.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48417-48424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) have reported that HSP70 can directly inhibit cell toxicity caused by expanded polyglutamines independent of any effect on protein aggregation. Thus, it is possible that some of the protective effects of HDJ-1 against cell death may be independent of its effects on protein misfolding/aggregation.Figure 7Effect of overexpression of various chaperones on GFP-NLS-A19 and GFP-NLS-A37 protein aggregation and cellular toxicity. COS-7 cells were transfected with GFP-NLS-A19 or GFP-NLS-A37 plus empty pFlag, HDJ-1, HSP104, or MC7 expression vectors. The proportions of EGFP-positive cells with aggregates or nuclear fragmentation/condensation were determined at 48 h after transfection. The odds ratios were derived from two to four independent experiments, each done in triplicate. The error bars represent the 95% confidence intervals for the odds ratios. ∗, p < 0.05; ∗∗, p < 0.001; ∗∗∗, p < 0.0001; NS, p > 0.05.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To address this caveat, we co-transfected cells with mutant PABP2 (or expanded GFP-polyalanine) constructs and known chaperones that are unlikely to directly affect mammalian cell death pathways. We used yeast hsp104 (for which there is no known mammalian homologue), which has previously been shown to reduce the formation of aggregates by various proteins in yeast and by a mutant huntingtin fragment with expanded poly(Q) repeats in mammalian cells (10.Carmichael J. Chatellier J. Woolfson A. Milstein C. Fersht A.R. Rubinsztein D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9701-9705Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). We also investigated the effect of MC7, an artificial minichaperone formed by placing seven copies of the ligand-binding domain of GroEL (residues 191–376) in a ring. This mimics the organization of one of the two heptameric rings of wild-type GroEL. MC7 was made by inserting GroEL residues 191–376 in the place of part of the highly mobile loop (residues 16–33) of the bacterial co-chaperonin GroES (10.Carmichael J. Chatellier J. Woolfson A. Milstein C. Fersht A.R. Rubinsztein D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9701-9705Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 22.Chatellier J. Hill F. Fersht A.R. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 304: 883-896Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). GroES forms a stable structure of seven ∼10.4-kDa subunits. When analyzed by both analytical size exclusion chromatography and analytical ultracentrifugation, recombinant MC7 formed heptamers comprising seven 30-kDa subunits, and electron microscopic studies of MC7 revealed a diameter similar to that of wild-type GroEL (10.Carmichael J. Chatellier J. Woolfson A. Milstein C. Fersht A.R. Rubinsztein D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9701-9705Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 22.Chatellier J. Hill F. Fersht A.R. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 304: 883-896Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The yeast and bacterial chaperone constructs described above were expressed from the mammalian expression vector pCDNA 3.1/HisB; proteins of appropriate sizes from lysates of transfected cells were detected by Western blotting, using an anti-His6 antibody (10.Carmichael J. Chatellier J. Woolfson A. Milstein C. Fersht A.R. Rubinsztein D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9701-9705Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). hsp104 and MC7 consistently reduced both aggregation and cell death at all time points tested with PABP2-A17 (Fig. 6). MC7 reduced both aggregate formation and cell death caused by GFP-NLS-A19 and GFP-NLS-A37 (Fig. 7). Whereas hsp104 reduced cell death for both GFP-NLS-A19 and GFP-NLS-A37, this chaperone did not significantly reduce the proportions of cells with GFP-NLS-A19 and GFP-NLS-A37 inclusions (Fig. 7). To formally test the possibility that hsp104 and MC7 could directly interfere with cell death pathways, we co-transfected either of these constructs or an equivalent amount of empty vector (pFlag) together with pEGFP-C1 empty vector in the same 4:1 ratios used to test protection against polyalanine constructs (see “Experimental Procedures”). The pEGFP-C1 empty vector enabled specific analysis of transfected cells under the fluorescence microscope (as we had done with the polyalanine constructs). Cell death pathways were induced by treating cells with either H202 (400 μm; 44 h after transfection, for 4 h prior to fixing cells) or staurospaurine (2.5 μm; 42 h after transfection, for 6 h prior to fixing cells). In pFlag-expressing cells, these treatments increased the proportions of cells with apoptotic nuclear morphology 1.6-fold (H202) and 1.7-fold (staurospaurine), compared with untreated cells (in each case, p < 0.0001 for treated cells versus untreated cells). Compared with pFlag, neither MC7 nor hsp104 significantly changed the amount of cell death in either untreated cells or cells treated with H2O2 or staurospaurine (untreated cells, p = 0.95 (hsp104) and p = 0.74 (MC7); H2O2-treated cells, p = 0.32 (hsp104) and p = 0.52 (MC7); staurospaurine-treated cells, p = 0.20 (hsp104) and p = 0.24 (MC7); data are from two experiments performed in triplicate). Thus, hsp104 and MC7 are unlikely to directly interfere with cell death pathways, and the protective effects they mediate in cells expressing polyalanine expansions are likely to be due to their activities as molecular chaperones improving the folding of these disease proteins. We also studied the effect of a chemical chaperone Me2SO (dimethyl sulfoxide) on our PABP2 model. Incubation of PABP2-A17-transfected cells with 0.4% Me2SO for 24 h significantly reduced the proportions of cells with inclusions (OR = 0.34; 95% confidence interval, 0.27–0.44; p < 0.0001) and the proportions of abnormal nuclei (OR = 0.22; 95% confidence interval, 0.17–0.28; p < 0.0001), compared with untreated cells. These odds ratios reflect pooled data from three experiments in triplicate. The protective effect of the chaperones we studied is likely to be primarily due to a correction of the conformation of the mutant proteins. However, it was possible that the normal conformers would be more prone to degradation than the abnormal forms. If this were correct, then the protection could be ascribed to the chaperones indirectly reducing the levels of the mutant protein rather than a change from an aggregate-prone conformation to a similar level of normally folded protein. This is unlikely to be the case because overexpression of the three chaperones we studied did not appear to reduce levels of mutant PABP2 (Fig. 1C). Our data suggest that both wild-type and mutant PABP2 proteins can aggregate at high expression levels. However, at lower levels, the mutant protein showed a significantly greater propensity for aggregation. This scenario has a precedent in the polyglutamine expansion disease spinocerebellar ataxia type 1, where at low expression levels there is aggregation of only the mutant protein with expanded repeats, whereas aggregation of the wild-type protein also occurs at high expression levels (23.Fernandez-Funez P. Nino-Rosales M.L. de Gouyon B. She W.C. Luchak J.M. Martinez P. Turiegano E. Benito J. Capovilla M. Skinner P.J. Nature. 2000; 408: 101-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar). In our OPMD cell model, the expression of the mutant PABP2 construct is associated with significantly higher levels of cell death compared with the wild-type protein. There is a correlation between cell death and protein aggregation because both phenomena are reduced by mammalian, yeast, and bacterial chaperones. The bacterial and yeast chaperones we studied did not reduce cells death caused by staurospaurine or H2O2. Thus, the protective effects they mediate in cells expressing polyalanine expansions are likely to be due to their activities as molecular chaperones improving the folding of these disease proteins. Although Me2SO may have a variety of effects on cells, it mediated a reduction of inclusion formation and cell death in our PABP2 model, suggesting that Me2SO may decrease the toxicity of PABP2 with expanded alanine tracts by acting as a chemical chaperone (24.Nagao Y. Ishiguro H. Nukina N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1502: 247-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). While this paper was under review, Fan et al. (25.Fan X. Dion P. Laganiere J. Brais B. Rouleau G.A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2001; 10: 2341-2351Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) reported that deletion of domains of PABP2 required for its oligomerization reduced aggregation and cell death caused by expanded polyalanines, providing further support for an association between protein aggregation and cell death in OPMD. We observed increases of protein aggregation and cell death with GFP-NLS-polyalanine constructs with expanded polyalanine tracts similar to those we saw with PABP2. This suggests that the toxicity of mutant PABP2 is mediated primarily by the expanded polyalanine tract and that the precise protein context may not be critical. If this is the case, then it is likely that the OPMD mutation acts via a gain of function mechanism. The reduction in cell death caused by GFP-NLS-A19 and GFP-NLS-A37 mediated by hsp104 was not mirrored by a significant reduction in aggregation. In future work, we will consider the possibility that hsp104 may modify the solubility of the aggregates without affecting the proportion of cells with aggregates, as has been described with HSP70 and polyglutamine expansions (13.Jana N.R. Tanaka M. Wang G.-h. Nukina N. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 2009-2018Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). We are also currently performing a detailed study to investigate which HSPs are associated with OPMD aggregates in vivo. However, the presence or absence of various HSPs on inclusions in vivo does not directly indicate whether these can modulate inclusion formation or cell death. For instance, HSP70 is not found in SCA1 inclusions in a transgenic mouse model, but its overexpression can alleviate motor function and neuropathology (26.Cummings C.J. Sun Y. Opal P. Antalffy B. Mestril R. Orr H.T. Dillmann W.H. Zoghbi H.Y. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2001; 10: 1511-1518Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). A gain of function mechanism for polyalanine expansion mutations in OPMD would be consistent with experiments suggesting that the capacity for PABP2 to regulate poly(A) tail elongation function is not impaired in myoblasts from OPMD patients. Further evidence against a loss of function of PABP2 in OPMD comes from studies of the Drosophila PABP2 orthologue, which lacks the first 54 residues of the mammalian proteins (27.Benoit B. Nemeth A. Aulner N. Kuhn U. Simonelig M. Wahle E. Bourbon H.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 3771-3778Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Despite lacking the domain that is mutated in OPMD (starting at residue 2 of human PABP2), the Drosophila protein stimulates poly(A) polymerase and is able to control poly(A) length in reconstituted mammalian polyadenylation systems (27.Benoit B. Nemeth A. Aulner N. Kuhn U. Simonelig M. Wahle E. Bourbon H.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 3771-3778Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Two other autosomal dominant diseases, synpolydactyly and a form of cleidocranial dysplasia, are also caused by polyalanine expansions in nuclear proteins (the transcription factors HOXD13 and CBFA1) (28.Goodman F.R. Mundlos S. Muragaki Y. Donnai D. Giovannucci-Uzielli M.L. Lapi E. Majewski F. McGaughran J. McKeown C. Reardon W. Upton J. Winter R.M. Olsen B.R. Scambler P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cell. 1997; 89: 773-779Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1257) Google Scholar). These diseases may also be caused by gain of function mutations because the polyalanine expansion mutations confer different or more severe phenotypes compared with null mutations. CBFA1 null mutations cause cleidocranial dysplasia, whereas the polyalanine expansion in this gene causes a different phenotype: brachydactyly of the hands/feet with only mild features of cleidocranial dysplasia (29.Mundlos S. Otto F. Mundlos C. Mulliken J.B. Aylsworth A.S. Albright S. Lindhout D. Cole W.G. Henn W. Knoll J.H. Cell. 1997; 89: 773-779Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1257) Google Scholar). In addition, mice with polyalanine expansions in HOXD13 have more severe phenotypes than HOXD13 null mice (30.Johnson K.R. Sweet H.O. Donahue L.R. Ward-Bailey P. Bronson R.T. Davisson M.T. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1998; 7: 1033-1038Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). How do polyalanine expansion mutations cause OPMD? An appealing model suggested by our data is that this is the direct consequence of protein aggregation. Similar findings exist for polyglutamine expansion diseases, where the role for protein aggregation is a subject for vigorous debate. A hallmark of most polyglutamine diseases, including Huntington's disease, is the development of intracellular protein aggregates (inclusions) with amyloid-like β-sheet structures in the vulnerable neurons, and polyalanine tracts also form β-sheets in vitro (31.Scherzinger E. Lurz R. Turmaine M. Mangiarini L. Hollenbach B. Hasenbank R. Bates G.P. Davies S.W. Lehrach H. Wanker E.E. Cell. 1997; 90: 549-558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1072) Google Scholar, 32.Blondelle S. Forood B. Houghten R.A. Perez-Paya E. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 8393-8400Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Although the effects of chaperones on aggregation and cell death strongly support a correlation between the appearance of aggregates and cell death/dysfunction, they may be compatible with another theoretical model where aggregation would not necessarily be causally related to cell death. The mutant monomeric proteins may exist in two sets of conformations: a properly-folded nontoxic species and an aggregate-prone toxic form(s). If the chaperones promote the conversion of the toxic aggregate-prone monomers to the nontoxic form, then one would see a reduction of both aggregation and cell death in the presence of chaperones. This scenario may be difficult to distinguish from the model where aggregation is toxic, unless one can identify a means of distinguishing and quantifying different monomeric forms of these aggregation-prone proteins from cell models or in vivo experiments. Irrespective of which model is correct, it is intriguing that the polyalanine expansions we have studied show features similar to polyglutamine models. Both are associated with protein misfolding/aggregation, and it is possible that the mutant proteins may stimulate overlapping deleterious pathways in vivo, irrespective of the nature of the mutation or the protein context.

As a selective response to microbial invasion, several antimicrobial peptides have been identified in the hemolymph (e.g.hemocytes) of insects (16.Hetru C. Hoffmann D. Bulet P. Brey P.T. Hultmark D.

Only a few antimicrobial peptides are exclusively and constitutively present in the venom glands of insects, namely melittin (19.Dempsey C.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1031: 143-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar) and crabolin (20.Krishnakumari V. Nagaraj R. J. Pept.

FEBS Lett. 2000; 471: 165-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). In 1989 the first report on bactericidal peptides in spider venom (Lycosa singoriensis) was published (23.Xu K. Ji Y. Qu X. Acta Zool. Sin. 1989; 35: 300-305Google Scholar); later, lycotoxins were isolated from Lycosa carolinensis (24.Yan L. Adams M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2059-2066Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Spiders are hunting predators and use paralytic venoms to immobilize their prey. Most components in their venoms act on the nervous system and are enzymatically active causing cell membrane disruption and tissue necrosis. The venom of Cupiennius salei, a hunting spider found in Central America, yielded both neurotoxically active peptides (named CSTX-1 to CSTX-13) (25.Kuhn-Nentwig L. Schaller J. Nentwig W. Toxicon. 1994; 32: 287-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) and bactericidal peptides (26.Haeberli S. Kuhn-Nentwig L. Schaller J. Nentwig W. Toxicon. 2000; 38: 373-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). To differentiate between the two groups of peptides, we named the family of antimicrobial compounds cupiennins. Here, the purification of the cupiennin family 1 composed of four very similar peptides, named cupiennin 1a, 1b, 1c and 1d, is reported. Cupiennin 1a is identical with peptide 8, and cupiennin 1d is identical with peptide 7 in Ref. 26.Haeberli S. Kuhn-Nentwig L. Schaller J. Nentwig W. Toxicon. 2000; 38: 373-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar. Sequence analysis of the highly cationic peptides and helix projection revealed a unique structure distinctly different from that of other potentially helical cationic peptides isolated so far. The highly antimicrobial, hemolytic, and insecticidal activity and the structural properties indicate a membrane-disturbing function of the cupiennins on prokaryotic as well eukaryotic cells. These peptides may provide a powerful tool in analyzing the structural prerequisites of antimicrobial selectivity and general cytolytic membrane action. In the light of the massive increase of multi-drug-resistant bacterial infections, further structural investigations of cupiennins may prove helpful in the development of new antimicrobial peptide pharmaceutics.

Schaller J. Nentwig W. Toxicon. 1994; 32: 287-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Briefly, 450 μl of crude venom was fractionated into nine 50-μl aliquots and diluted with 150 μl of 200 mmammonium acetate buffer, pH 5.5 (buffer A). The diluted venom was separated on a Superdex 75 HR 10/30 column (Amersham Biosciences. Inc.) in buffer A, and fractions were collected as noted on the chromatogram (see Fig. 1A). Further separation of the pooled fractions was achieved by cationic exchange on a Mono S HR 10/10 column (Amersham Biosciences. Inc.) in buffer A. Elution was done with a salt gradient (2 m NaCl in buffer A, pH 5.5) as shown in Fig. 1B. Similar fractions from four chromatographies were combined. The pooled fractions were further desalted and separated by RP-HPLC on a nucleosil 300-5 C4 column (4.6 × 250 mm, Macherey & Nagel) using 100% solvent A with a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min for 0–15 min followed by a first 10-min gradient of 1% solvent B in A/min and a second 120-min gradient of 0.4% solvent B in A/min (solvent A, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water; solvent B, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in acetonitrile (not shown)). After each step of purification the fractions were tested for their antimicrobial activity by a plate growth assay as described previously (26.Haeberli S. Kuhn-Nentwig L. Schaller J. Nentwig W. Toxicon. 2000; 38: 373-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Further purification was achieved by RP-HPLC on a nucleosil 120-5 C18 column (4 × 250 mm, Macherey & Nagel) equilibrated with 22% solvent B in solvent A and a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Ten minutes after injection of the sample the first gradient (22–40% solvent B) was started for 115 min followed by a second 10-min gradient (40–100% solvent B). The peptide fractions obtained were pooled (Fig. 1C) and purified in a final RP-HPLC step on a nucleosil 100-5 C8 HD column (4 × 250 mm, Macherey & Nagel) with constant 36% solvent B and a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min (Fig. 1D). This step was repeated three to five times to obtain homogeneous peptides. The purity of these peptides was confirmed by ESI-MS and amino acid analyses. 10 μg of cupiennin 1a were incubated with 1 μg of chymotrypsin (sequencing grade, Roche Diagnostics) in 10 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mmCaCl2, pH 7.5, for 4 h at 25 °C. Separation of the chymotryptic peptides was achieved with RP-HPLC on a 120–5 C18 column (2 × 125 mm, Macherey & Nagel) equilibrated with 100% solvent A. Ten minutes after injection of the sample, a 250-min gradient of 0.2% solvent B in solvent A/min was started. Comparative digestions of 5 μg of purified cupiennin 1a, 1a*, 1b, 1c, and 1d with 0.5 μg of trypsin (sequencing grade, Roche Diagnostics) were carried out in 100 mm ammonium hydrogen carbonate buffer at pH 8.0 for 4 h at 25 °C. Separation of the tryptic peptides was obtained under isocratic conditions with RP-HPLC on a 120–5 C18 column (2 × 125 mm, Macherey & Nagel) equilibrated with 100% solvent A. A second run was started and after 10 min followed by a 120-min gradient of 0.23% solvent B in A/min. Solvent A: 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water, solvent B: 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in acetonitrile (Fig. 3, A and B). Mass analysis of the digested samples and of the isolated peptides was performed on ESI-MS. Samples were hydrolyzed in the gas phase with 6 m hydrochloric acid containing 0.1% (by volume) phenol for 24 h at 115 °C under N2 vacuum (27.Chang J.-Y. Knecht R. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 197: 52-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The liberated amino acids were labeled with phenylisothiocyanate and the resulting phenylthiocarbamoyl amino acids analyzed by RP-HPLC on a Nova Pak ODS column (3.9 × 150 mm, 4 μm; Waters) in a Hewlett Packard liquid chromatograph 1090 with an automatic injection system (28.Bindlingmeyer B.A. Cohen S.A. Tarvin T.L. J. Chromatogr. 1984; 336: 93-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (2128) Google Scholar). N-terminal sequence analysis was carried out either in a Procise cLC 492 protein sequencer or in a pulsed-liquid-phase sequencer 477A, both from Applied Biosystems. The released amino acids were analyzed on-line by RP-HPLC according to instructions from Applied Biosystems. The molecular mass of isolated cupiennins and proteolytic peptides was determined using electrospray ionization mass spectrometry on a single-stage quadrupole instrument (VG Platform, Micromass, Manchester, UK) calibrated with horse myoglobin in a mass range of 600–2000 m/z. Peptides from enzymatic cleavages represent monoisotopic masses, and native cupiennins represent average masses. Solid-phase peptide synthesis was performed on a Millipore 9050 continuous flow peptide synthesizer (Millipore Corp.) using Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) chemistry. Cleavage and deprotection was carried out in 88% trifluoroacetic acid, 5% liquefied phenol, 2% triisopropylsilane, and 5% water for 1–2 h at room temperature. The free peptide was then repeatedly precipitated with ice-cold ether and dried under vacuum. After resuspension in 10% acetic acid, the peptides were purified by preparative RP-HPLC on a C18 column (25 × 100 mm, 15 μm, 300Å, Delta-Pak, Waters, Millipore Corp.), which was eluted at 5 ml/min with a gradient of 0–60% acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid at an increment of 1.3%/min. Peak fractions were repurified on a semi-preparative C18 column (10 × 250 mm, 7 μm, 300Å, Vydac, Holland, MI). Purity and protein composition were analyzed by ESI-MS, amino acid analysis, and N-terminal sequence analysis. Stock solutions of the peptides were prepared by dissolving the samples in 5 mm sodium phosphate buffer at pH 7.25 containing 150 mm NaF. For CD measurements, aliquots of the solution were diluted with buffer or mixed with TFE to give a final concentration of 50 μm and the desired solvent composition. Measurements were carried out on a J-720 spectrometer in 0.1-cm cells between 195 and 260 nm at room temperature (Jasco). Each spectrum was the average of five scans. The base line was subtracted. The helicity (α) of cupiennin 1a, 1a*, and 1d* was determined from the mean residue ellipticity at 222 nm (Θ222), according to the equation: α (%) = (Θ222 + 2340) × 100%/−30300 (29.Chen Y.-H. Yang J.T. Martinez H.M. Biochemistry. 1972; 11: 4120-4131Crossref PubMed Scopus (1913) Google Scholar). Bacteria (Escherichia coliATCC 25922; Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 29213;Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853) were cultured in Mueller-Hinton broth. Determination of the minimal inhibitory concentration for the cationic antimicrobial peptides was performed using a 2-fold microtiter broth dilution assay (30.Wu M. Hancock R.E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29-35Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Mueller-Hinton broth was used to dilute the bacterial inoculum, which was prepared from mid-log phase cultures to give a final concentration of 1.7- 3.8 × 105colony-forming units/ml in the wells. First, 100 μl of the bacteria dilution was added to the wells followed by 10 μl of the test peptides in 0.01% acetic acid, 0.2% bovine serum albumin. The peptides (0.04–100 μm), a nontreated growth control, and a sterility control were tested in triplicate. The microtiter plates were incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. The content of the first four wells showing no visible growth of bacteria (measured as an increase of optical density at 630 nm) were plated out on blood agar plates and incubated at 37 °C for 18 h. Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) are expressed as intervals of concentrations, [a] − [b], where [a] is the highest concentration of peptide at which bacteria still grow and [b] the lowest concentration causing 100% growth inhibition (no colony forming bacteria estimated after additional plating of 91% of the tested bacteria suspension). The hemolytic activity of cupiennin 1a, 1a*, 1b, 1d, 1d*, magainin 2, and melittin was determined using fresh human erythrocytes. 1 ml of citrated blood was washed four times with 6 ml of PBS buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.2) and centrifuged (900 × g) for 6 min at room temperature. The pellet was resuspended in 3 ml and further diluted to a concentration of 1 × 109 human erythrocytes/ml in PBS buffer. Lyophilized peptides in various concentrations were resolved in 200 μl of PBS buffer, and 50 μl of human erythrocytes were added following incubation under gentle shaking at 37 °C for 1 h. The samples were then placed on ice and immediately centrifuged at 4 °C. The supernatant was carefully removed, and the pellet was resuspended in 240 μl of water. Release of hemoglobin was monitored by measuring the absorbance of supernatant and water-treated pellet at 541 nm in a 1-cm cell (Jasco V-550). The negative control (0% hemolysis) was 50 μl of human erythrocytes in 200 μl of PBS buffer, and the positive control (100% hemolysis) was 50 μl of human erythrocytes in 200 μl of water. The concentrations of peptide at which 50% hemolysis was observed (EC50) were derived using a sigmoidal curve fitting software (GraphPad Prism 3.0, Graph Pad Software). Bioassays using Drosophila melanogaster according to Escoubas et al. (31.Escoubas P. Palma M.F. Nakajima P. Toxicon. 1995; 33: 1549-1555Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) were performed to estimate the LD50 (24 h postinjection) of the peptides. For each assay 20 flies were used as control (injecting 0.05 μl of insect ringer) and 20 for each of the three peptide concentrations. LD50 stands for the lethal dose (50% of the test flies die of intoxication) and calculations were done as described elsewhere (32.Kuhn-Nentwig L. Schaller J. Kämpfer U. Imboden H. Malli H. Nentwig W. Arch. Insect Biochem. Physiol. 2000; 44: 101-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). 450 μl of venom was separated in a five-step protocol that included gel filtration (Fig. 1A), cationic exchange chromatography (Fig. 1B), and successive reversed-phase-HPLC on a nucleosil 300-5 C4 column (not shown), a nucleosil 120-5 C18 column (Fig. 1C) and a nucleosil 100-5 C8 column (Fig. 1D). The retention times of the purified antimicrobial peptides ranged from 18.35 min for cupiennin 1d to 20.12 min for cupiennin 1a. The retention profiles revealed no other impurities. The purity of the peptides obtained was additionally examined by ESI-MS, N-terminal sequence analysis, and amino acid composition. The yield of cupiennin 1a (ESI-MS 3798.63 ± 0.51 Da, theoretically 3798.59 Da) was 4.7 μg/μl fractionated venom. This implies that the toxin concentration is 1.2 mm in crude venom. Cupiennin 1b (ESI-MS 3800.25 ± 0.28 Da, theoretically 3800.57 Da) occurred in the venom at a concentration of 0.4 μg/μl. Because of very similar retention times, the last RP-HPLC purification step had to be repeated several times for cupiennin 1c (ESI-MS 3769.75 ± 0.50 Da, theoretically 3770.48 Da) and cupiennin 1d (ESI-MS 3795.13 ± 0.79 Da, theoretically 3795.55 Da). However, the procedure was accompanied by a substantial loss of peptides. The amounts of cupiennin 1c and 1d yielded were 0.02 and 0.1 μg/μl crude venom, respectively. The purification procedure was impeded by methionine oxidation at position 34 in cupiennin 1a, 1b, and 1d. As a result, the sulfoxide containing cupiennins eluted directly prior to the nonoxidated peptides (Fig. 1D, peaks are labeled with arrows) as small peaks and were identified by ESI-MS (for cupiennin 1a: ESI-MS 3814.50 ± 0.35 Da, theoretically 3814.59 Da) and, additionally, amino acid analyses (not shown). Amino acid and sequence analysis of the C-terminal tryptic peptide 33–35 of sulfoxidated cupiennin 1a (ESI-MS 421.28 Da, theoretically 421.09 Da) thus also confirmed the presence of methionine sulfoxide at position 34. The oxidation of methionine is a well known artifact during the repeated purification cycles on RP-HPLC. Sequence analysis of cupiennin 1a ceased at position 34. To obtain the rest of the sequence, cupiennin 1a was cleaved with chymotrypsin and the peptides generated were separated by RP-HPLC on a nucleosil 120-5 C18 column (not shown). The five peaks received were identified by ESI-MS, and the C-terminal peptide (residues 29–35; ESI-MS 845.40 Da, theoretically 846.43 Da) was sequenced. It is noteworthy that glutamic acid was identified as the C-terminal amino acid (Fig. 2A). Because of the observed molecular mass difference of 1 Da between the theoretical and measured mass of the chymotryptic C-terminal fragment, an amidation of glutamic acid was supposed. Cupiennin 1a* (*, acidic C terminus) was therefore synthesized to confirm the assumed posttranslational amidation in cupiennin 1a. After purification, cupiennin 1a* (ESI-MS 3799.38 ± 0.39 Da, theoretically 3799.58 Da) eluted as a single sharp peak after RP-HPLC on an analytical nucleosil 120-5 C8 HD column. The retention time differed slightly from the retention time of cupiennin 1a (Fig. 1D), also indicating the assumed chemical modification. The correct sequence of cupiennin 1a* was further confirmed by amino acid analysis, ESI-MS, and Edman degradation (not shown). The determined amino acid sequence of cupiennin 1a and 1a* agree well with the results of the amino acid composition analyses (Table I).Table IAmino acid analyses of natural and synthesized (*) cupienninsAmino acidCupiennin 1aCupiennin 1a*Cupiennin 1bCupiennin 1cCupiennin 1dCupiennin 1d*mol/molAsx0.8(1)0.9(1)0.9(1)0.8(1)0.8(1)0.9(1)Glx3.8(4)4.0(4)3.9(4)3.7(4)2.9(3)3.0(3)Ser0.1(0)0.0(0)1.0(1)0.9(1)0.9(1)0.8(1)Gly2.9(3)3.1(3)3.0(3)2.9(3)2.9(3)2.9(3)His0.0(0)0.0(0)0.0(0)0.0(0)0.8(1)1.0(1)Arg0.0(0)0.0(0)0.1(0)0.0(0)0.0(0)0.0(0)Thr0.9(1)1.0(1)1.0(1)1.8(2)1.0(1)1.0(1)Ala7.0(7)7.5(7)6.5(7)6.5(7)6.7(7)7.4(7)Pro0.0(0)0.0(0)0.1(0)0.0(0)0.0(0)0.0(0)Tyr1.0(1)1.0(1)1.0(1)1.1(1)1.1(1)1.0(1)Val3.3(4)3.3(4)2.0(2)2.0(2)2.9(3)3.0(3)Met0.7(1)1.0(1)0.6(1)0.1(0)0.6(1)0.9(1)Cys0.0(0)0.0(0)0.0(0)0.0(0)0.0(0)0.0(0)Ile0.0(0)0.0(0)0.9(1)0.9(1)0.1(0)0.0(0)Leu2.0(2)2.1(2)2.1(2)2.0(2)2.0(2)2.1(2)Phe3.0(3)3.2(3)2.8(3)2.9(3)2.9(3)3.0(3)Lys7.6(8)7.8(8)7.4(8)7.4(8)7.5(8)8.0(8)TrpND(0)ND(0)ND(0)ND(0)ND(0)ND(0)Total33.1(35)34.9(35)33.3(35)33.0(35)33.1(35)35.0(35)The amino acid composition of cupiennin 1a, 1b, 1c, and 1d from C. salei venom purified by RP-HPLC and synthesized cupiennin 1a* and 1d*.

Open table in a new tab The amino acid composition of cupiennin 1a, 1b, 1c, and 1d from C. salei venom purified by RP-HPLC and synthesized cupiennin 1a* and 1d*. The values in parentheses are those calculated from the amino acid sequence. ND, not determined. Comparative amino acid analysis of cupiennin 1a, 1a*, 1b, 1c, and 1d (Table I) revealed only slight differences in the content of Ala, Ser, Glx, Ile, Val, His, Thr, and Met. Therefore the amino acid sequence determination of cupiennin 1b, 1c, and 1d was performed by comparative tryptic peptide mapping. Peptide separation was carried out by RP-HPLC (Fig. 3, A and B), and the peptides obtained were then identified by ESI-MS. The tryptic peptides of cupiennin 1a and 1a* are identical (Table II) except for the C-terminal peptides, which are amidated in the case of cupiennin 1a, as indicated by the mass difference of 0.85 Da (ESI-MS). Cupiennin 1b differs from cupiennin 1a: 1) in the N-terminal peptide 1–7, where Ala-4 is exchanged with Ser; and 2) in the peptide sequence 28–32, where Val-29 and Val-30 are replaced by Ile-29 and Ala-30. However, cupiennin 1c and 1d also show the single replacement of Ser at position 4 in peptide 1–7. The sequence 28–32 of cupiennin 1c is identical to fragment 28–32 of cupiennin 1b (Val-29 and Val-30 substituted by Ile-29 and Ala-30), but in addition Met-34 is replaced by Thr in the C-terminal peptide 33–35. Cupiennin 1d differs in the C-terminal region from cupiennin 1a in fragment 28–32, where Val-30 is replaced by Ala, and in fragment 33–35, where Gln-33 is exchanged with His (Fig. 2B). The sequences of all tryptic peptides that differed from cupiennin 1a fragments were later determined by Edman degradation (Table II). The deduced amino acid sequences of cupiennin 1b, 1c, and 1d (Fig. 2B) are in good agreement with the results of the amino acid analyses (Table I). For further studies a cupiennin 1d analogue with Gln was synthesized as nonamidated C terminus (cupiennin 1d*).

Open table in a new tab Cupiennins were incubated with trypsin (10:1) for 4 h at 25 °C. Tryptic peptides were isolated by RP-HPLC (Fig. 3), the molecular mass measured by ESI-MS, and the amino acid sequence determined by Edman degradation. The numbers in parentheses are theoretical values (monoisotopic, Da). The replacement of the amino acids in cupiennin 1b, 1c, and 1d is mentioned in the legend for Fig. 2. *, not amidated. Cupiennin 1a, 1b, 1c, and 1d are linear peptides consisting of 35 amino acid residues. The C terminus is amidated, and the net positive charge is at least + 8 at neutral pH (Fig. 2B). The theoretical isoelectric point is 11.30 for all peptides, not taking the C-terminal amidation into account. The N-terminal part of the sequences (Gly-Phe-Gly-Ala/Ser-Leu-Phe) is somewhat hydrophobic, whereas polar amino acid residues predominate in the C-terminal region. All cupiennins are characterized by six repeats of four amino acids, which form the central part of the peptide chain, following the N-terminal hydrophobic stretch with lysine at every first position in their central part. These six repeats are defined by the following sequence: position 1 is always lysine; position 2 is variable (hydrophobic, charged, or polar amino acid); position 3 is always a hydrophobic amino acid (Leu, Val, Ala, Ile) or Gly; and in position 4 is Ala or Val (Fig. 2B). Based on the consensus scale of hydrophobicity for the individual amino acid residues of Eisenberg (33.Eisenberg D. Ann. Rev. Biochem. 1984; 53: 595-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar) the mean hydrophobicity (H) of the cupiennins was found to range between −0.138 and −0.168. Assuming an α-helical conformation, their hydrophobic moment (μ) was determined to vary between 0.0121 and 0.0282 (Fig. 4A, Table III). These parameters differ distinctly from H and μ values characterizing other antimicrobial peptides such as lycotoxins (24.Yan L. Adams M.E. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W2033031544,"Members of the tristetraprolin (TTP) family of CCCH tandem zinc finger proteins can bind directly to certain types of AU-rich elements (AREs) in mRNA. Experiments in TTP-deficient mice have shown that TTP is involved in the physiological destabilization of at least two cytokine mRNAs, those encoding tumor necrosis factor α and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor. The two other known mammalian members of the TTP family, CMG1 and TIS11D, also contain ARE-binding CCCH tandem zinc finger domains and can also destabilize ARE-containing mRNAs. To investigate the effects of primary sequence on the subcellular localization of these proteins, we constructed green fluorescent protein fusions with TTP, CMG1, and TIS11D; these were predominantly cytoplasmic when expressed in 293 or HeLa cells. Deletion and mutation analyses revealed functional nuclear export signals in the amino terminus of TTP and in the carboxyl termini of CMG1 and TIS11D. This type of leucine-rich nuclear export signal interacts with the nuclear export receptor CRM1; abrogation of CRM1 activity resulted in nuclear accumulation of TTP, CMG1, and TIS11D. These proteins are thus nucleocytoplasmic shuttling proteins and rely on CRM1 for their export from the nucleus. Although TTP, CMG1, and TIS11D lack known nuclear import sequences, mapping experiments revealed that their nuclear accumulation required an intact tandem zinc finger domain but did not require RNA binding ability. These findings suggest possible roles for nuclear import and export in the regulation of cellular TTP, CMG1, and TIS11D activity.

This protein family is characterized by the presence of two zinc fingers spaced 18 amino acids apart, each containing three cysteines and one histidine with strictly defined spacing of C X(8)C X(5)C X(3)H. The TTP family is further defined by a conserved amino-terminal sequence R(K)YKTEL leading in to each finger. TTP (2.Lai W.S. Stumpo D.J. Blackshear P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 16556-16563Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), also known as TIS11 (3.Varnum B.C. Lim R.W. Sukhatme V.P. Herschman H.R.

In addition, TTP is able to regulate the stability of interleukin-3 (IL-3) mRNA in cell transfection studies, although this has not yet been shown to be a physiological role (1.Lai W.S. Carballo E.

Shyu A.B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 465-470Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1666) Google Scholar). TTP exerts a destabilizing effect on mRNA by binding directly to the ARE, leading to the accelerated destruction of ARE-containing transcripts (7.Carballo E. Lai W.S. Blackshear P.J. Science. 1998; 281: 1001-1005Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8.Carballo E. Lai W.S. Blackshear P.J. Blood. 2000; 95: 1891-1899Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9.Lai W.S. Carballo E. Strum J.R.

The mechanisms by which this accelerated degradation is accomplished remain unknown, but it is thought to be initiated by TTP-dependent deadenylation (14.Lai W.S. Blackshear P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23144-23154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar).Two additional mammalian members of the TTP family have been identified to date. They are referred to here as CMG1 (15.Gomperts M. Pascall J.C. Brown K.D. Oncogene. 1990; 5: 1081-1083PubMed Google Scholar) (also known as TIS11B (16.Varnum B.C. Ma Q.F. Chi T.H. Fletcher B.

CMG1 and TIS11D each contain a TTP-like CCCH TZF domain, and they can, like TTP, destabilize the ARE-containing TNFα, GM-CSF, and IL-3 mRNAs in co-transfection studies (1.Lai W.S. Carballo E. Thorn J.M. Kennington E.A. Blackshear P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17827-17837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). Although the genes encoding mouse CMG1 and TIS11D are regulated differently from the TTP gene and are expressed in different tissues, 2R. S. Phillips, S. B. V. Ramos, and P. J. Blackshear, unpublished observations. 2R. S. Phillips, S. B. V. Ramos, and P. J. Blackshear, unpublished observations. their similar mRNA binding and destabilizing properties to TTP suggest that some functional overlap may exist within this protein family.Previous work from our laboratory (22.Taylor G.A. Thompson M.J. Lai W.S. Blackshear P.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 140-146PubMed Google Scholar) has shown that, in serum-starved fibroblasts, TTP is localized to the nucleus and that upon stimulation with mitogens it rapidly (<5 min) translocates to the cytoplasm. Moreover, in primary mouse macrophages cytosolic, but not nuclear, levels of TTP increase dramatically when cells are treated with lipopolysaccharide (7.Carballo E. Lai W.S. Blackshear P.J. Science. 1998; 281: 1001-1005Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The mechanism by which TTP translocates in response to extracellular stimuli is at present unclear. Here we present evidence that TTP, CMG1, and TIS11D can shuttle between the nucleus and cytoplasm and that the nuclear export is mediated by a functional leucine-rich nuclear export sequence (NES) (23.Fischer U. Huber J. Boelens W.C. Mattaj I.W. Luhrmann R. Cell. 1995; 82: 475-483Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (981) Google Scholar, 24.Murphy R. Wente S.R. Nature. 1996; 383: 357-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). This sequence motif can direct export of proteins through the nuclear pore complex (NPC) into the cytoplasm (25.Wen W. Meinkoth J.L. Tsien R.Y. Taylor S.S. Cell. 1995; 82: 463-473Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (996) Google Scholar).This NES is at the amino terminus of TTP but at the carboxyl terminus of CMG1 and TIS11D; in all cases, the nuclear export is mediated by the export receptor CRM1. Finally we show that the nuclear import of the CCCH proteins requires the TZF domain but occurs independently of TZF RNA-binding ability.MATERIALS AND METHODSPlasmid ConstructionThe cDNA for mouse TTP ((26); GenBankTM accession numberP22893) 3The accession numbers cited throughout this work are from GenBankTM. was used as a PCR template for all TTP constructs.The cDNA for mouse CMG1 (accession number M58566) was obtained by screening a mouse fibroblast NIH-3T3 cell library (CLONTECH Laboratories, Inc., Palo Alto, CA) by standard techniques with a random primed, α-32P-labeled probe consisting of nucleotides 1–1190 of the rat cMG1 cDNA ((15); accession number X52590; generously supplied by K.D. Brown, The Babraham Institute, Babraham, Cambridge, UK). Three positive cDNA clones were sequenced by dRhodamine dye terminator cycle sequencing (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The longest clone, containing nucleotides 205–2659 of accession number M58566, was designated CMG1–3′cDNA.The 5′-most 200 nucleotides of mouse CMG1 were cloned by reverse transcriptase-PCR, using the Access RT-PCR System (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions, with a template of 1 μg of total cellular mRNA isolated from NIH-3T3 cells. The primers used were 5′-GCGCCTTCCCCGCACCGGACCTTCAC-3′ and 5′-ATGAATGAAGTGGCAGCGGG-3′ (corresponding to nucleotides 1–26 and 599 to 580, respectively, of accession number M58566). A PCR product of ∼600 nucleotides was gel-purified, cloned into the vector pGEM-T (Promega Corp., Madison, WI), and sequenced by dRhodamine dye terminator cycle sequencing. The resulting plasmid, containing nucleotides 1–599 of accession numberM58566, was designated CMG1–5′cDNA.The protein coding region of mouse CMG1 spans nucleotides 68–1085 of accession number M58566. A cDNA containing this entire region was constructed from the above plasmids by cloning an ∼2-kb Eco47III -HindIII fragment from the CMG1–3′cDNA into the Eco47III and HindIII sites of the CMG1–5′cDNA. The resulting plasmid was sequenced and contained nucleotides 1–2210 of accession number M58566. This was designated CMG1.1–2210cDNA and used as a PCR template for all CMG1 constructs described here.A mouse genomic (MG-TIS11D) clone was obtained by screening a SV129 library (Stratagene) with a random-primed, α-32P-labeled probe consisting of nucleotides 1–275 of accession number M58565, which was a PstI-PstI fragment from EST cloneAA021952. From the MG-TIS11D clone, an ∼7.3-kb XbaI fragment was subcloned into the vector pBSK (CLONTECH) to create the plasmid p11D-Xba7.5, which was sequenced as described above. From p11D-Xba7.5, an ∼400-bp EcoRI-XhoI fragment containing the 3′ end of exon 1, the single intron, and the beginning of exon 2 was excised and replaced by a 140-bp EcoRI-XhoI fragment obtained from EST clone AI327503 to reconstitute a full-length TIS11D cDNA (this corresponds to nucleotides 1–960 of accession number M58565, as well as 120 upstream nucleotides representing additional sequence thought to be present in the full-length TIS11D protein) in plasmid p11DcDNA. Base 7 of EST clone AI327503 corresponds to the initiator methionine in the putative full-length human TIS11D protein (see NP_008818.3). p11DcDNA was then used as a PCR template for the GFP-TIS11D construct described here.pCMV-ΔCAN (pBC12/cmv/ΔCAN) was kindly provided by Dr. Bryan R. Cullen, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC. This plasmid encodes a truncated form of the nucleoporin Nup214/CAN (26.Taylor G.A. Lai W.S. Oakey R.J. Seldin M.F. Shows T.B. Eddy R.L. Blackshear P.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 3454Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar).All TTP, CMG1 and TIS11D GFP fusion plasmids were constructed, using the appropriate cDNA as a PCR template, by ligating PCR products containing either the entire protein coding sequence or the indicated fragments thereof (see below) into the vectors pEGFP-C1, -N1, or -C2 (CLONTECH). GFP was at the amino terminus of each TTP and CMG1 fusion protein and at the carboxyl terminus of TIS11D. Correct in-frame sequences were confirmed by dRhodamine dye terminator cycle sequencing.Plasmid GFP-CMG1 contains nucleotides 68–1085 of accession numberM58566 and encodes the full-length mouse CMG1 protein, amino acids 1–338 (see accession number AAA72948). Plasmid GFP-CMG1.1–307 encodes amino acids 1–307, corresponding to nucleotides 68–989 of accession number M58566. Plasmid GFP-CMG1.1–108 encodes amino acids 1–108, corresponding to nucleotides 68–337. Plasmid GFP-CMG1.1–177 encodes amino acids 1–177, corresponding to nucleotides 68–599. Plasmid GFP-CMG1.108–338 encodes amino acids 108–338, corresponding to nucleotides 410–989. Plasmid GFP-CMG1.178–338 encodes amino acids 178–338, corresponding to nucleotides 600–989. Plasmid GFP-CMG1.295–338 encodes amino acids 295–338, corresponding to nucleotides 950–1086. Plasmid GFP-CMG1.TZF encodes amino acids 108–177, corresponding to nucleotides 410–599.Similarly, plasmid GFP-TTP encodes the full-length mouse TTP protein, amino acids 1–319 (see accession number P22893), corresponding to nucleotides 32–990 of accession number M57422. Plasmid GFP-TTP.1–280 encodes amino acids 1–280, corresponding to nucleotides 32–872. Plasmid GFP-TTP.1–94 encodes amino acids 1–94, corresponding to nucleotides 32–317. Plasmid GFP-TTP.1–158 encodes amino acids 1–158, corresponding to nucleotides 32–506. Plasmid GFP-TTP.15–158 encodes amino acids 15–158, corresponding to nucleotides 75–506. Plasmid GFP-TTP.15–319 encodes amino acids 15–319, corresponding to nucleotides 75–990. Plasmid GFP-TTP.158–319 encodes amino acids 158–319, corresponding to nucleotides 507–990. Plasmid GFP-TTP.95–319 encodes amino acids 95–319, corresponding to nucleotides 320–990. Plasmid GFP-TTP.TZF encodes amino acids 95–158, corresponding to nucleotides 320–506.Epitope-tagged plasmids were similarly constructed by inserting a PCR fragment containing the CMG1 or TTP protein coding sequence into vector pCMVFLAG2 (Sigma) or pCMV-HA (CLONTECH). In all cases, the epitope tag was at the amino terminus of the fusion protein.Critical cysteine, serine, lysine, isoleucine, phenylalanine, methionine, and valine residues were changed to alanines using the PCR primer overlapping mutagenesis technique as described (28.Lai W.S. Thompson M.J. Blackshear P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 506-517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). All mutations were confirmed by dRhodamine dye terminator cycle sequencing.Cell Culture and TransfectionsHeLa and 293 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen). Media were supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Transient transfections in HeLa and 293 cells were performed using the calcium phosphate method, essentially as described (28.Lai W.S. Thompson M.J. Blackshear P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 506-517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), with the following modifications. Fresh medium containing chloroquine (Sigma; final concentration, 25 μm) was added to the cells ∼30 min prior to addition of the transfection mixture. After addition of the transfection mixture, cells were rinsed for 6–10 h with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and fixed at 24–48 h. For immunofluorescence, 5 × 104 to 1 × 105 cells were transfected in 2-well (4 cm2) LabTek chamber slides (Nalge Nunc International, Naperville, IL) with 1–50 ng of various GFP fusion or epitope-tagged constructs. In all cases, pcDNA3.1 vector DNA (Invitrogen) was added to bring the total transfected DNA to 200 ng.Epifluorescence and ImmunofluorescenceTo observe cells expressing GFP fusion proteins, cells grown on glass slides were rinsed twice at room temperature in PBS, fixed for 10 min in 4% (v/v) paraformaldehyde, and then rinsed again twice with PBS before mounting with ProLong Anti-fade (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR). After drying overnight, the slides were examined and images obtained using a Zeiss LSM510 confocal microscope (Zeiss, Thornwood, NY). When indicated, leptomycin B (Sigma; 10 ng/ml) was added in fresh medium 6 h before cell fixing.To observe epitope-tagged proteins, cells grown on glass slides were fixed as described above, rinsed four times in PBS, and then incubated in an ice-cold 2:1 solution of ethanol:glacial acetic acid at −20 °C for 5 min. After rinsing four times in PBS, cells were permeabilized with 0.5% (w/v) Nonidet P-40 in PBS at room temperature for 5 min and then blocked for 1 h in 10% (v/v) normal goat serum in PBS. Cells were incubated in primary antibody (monoclonal FLAGM2TM anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma), used at a dilution of 1:300, or monoclonal anti-HA SC-7392 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) antibody, used at a dilution of 1:300) for 2 h at room temperature and then washed four times in PBS. Cells were incubated in secondary antibody (Alexa Fluor® 488 (Molecular Probes) goat anti-mouse) for 2 h at room temperature in the presence of 2% (v/v) normal goat serum. Following incubation in secondary antibody, cells were rinsed four times in PBS before mounting and confocal microscopy, as described above.RESULTSTransfected TTP, CMG1, and TIS11D Fusion Proteins with GFP Are Predominantly Cytoplasmic at Steady State in 293 CellsTo examine the subcellular localization of wild-type TTP, CMG1, and TIS11D, 293 cells were transfected with plasmids encoding GFP fusion proteins, fixed, and examined by confocal microscopy. GFP alone was expressed in both the nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments (Fig. 1A), whereas GFP-TTP, GFP-CMG1 and GFP-TIS11D were predominantly cytoplasmic (Fig. 1, B–D). To show that fusion to GFP had no effect on protein localization, 293 cells were also transfected with epitope-tagged versions of TTP and CMG1 and then examined by immunocytochemistry. TTP-FLAG and CMG1-FLAG were predominantly cytoplasmic and were indistinguishable from GFP-TTP and GFP-CMG1 in their subcellular localization (Fig. 1, E and F). In all cases, the transfections were performed at least three times, and ∼200 fluorescent cells were examined for each expression construct. The individual cells shown in the figures are representative of the overall cell population. Most of the same fusion proteins were also expressed in HeLa cells, in each case with identical subcellular localization in the two cell types (data not shown).TTP, CMG1, and TIS11D Subcellular Localization Are Leptomycin B-sensitiveThe antifungal agent leptomycin B (LMB) is a selective inhibitor of the nuclear export receptor CRM1 (29.Kudo N.

Cell. 1997; 90: 1051-1060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1731) Google Scholar). To determine whether the subcellular localization of the CCCH proteins was sensitive to LMB, 293 cells transfected with GFP fusion proteins were treated with carrier (100% methanol; final concentration 0.001%, v/v) or a final concentration of 10 ng/ml LMB for 6 h, fixed, and examined by confocal microscopy. In the absence of LMB, GFP was distributed throughout the cells (Fig. 2A), whereas GFP-TTP (Fig. 2C), GFP-CMG1 (Fig. 2E), and GFP-TIS11D (Fig. 2G) were predominantly cytoplasmic. In the presence of LMB, GFP remained distributed throughout the cells (Fig. 2B), whereas GFP-TTP (Fig. 2D), GFP-CMG1 (Fig. 2F), and GFP-TIS11D (Fig. 2H) were predominantly nuclear, with nucleolar exclusion. Essentially identical results were obtained in similar experiments performed in HeLa cells (data not shown). Thus, when protein export from the nucleus was blocked by LMB, localization of TTP, CMG1, and TIS11D shifted from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. These data indicate that, when transfected into these mammalian cells, TTP, CMG1, and TIS11D shuttle between the nucleus and the cytoplasm.Figure 2Subcellular localization of TTP, CMG1, and TIS11D is LMB-sensitive. 293 cells (1 × 105cells per well) were plated on 2-chamber multiwell slides and transfected with 10 ng/well of DNA from the following plasmids: GFP (A and B), GFP-TTP (C and D), GFP-CMG1 (E and F), or GFP-11D (G and H). The total amount of DNA was brought up to 300 ng with pcDNA3.1. Cells were grown for an additional 24 h and then treated either with carrier ((−); top panels)) or 10 ng/ml LMB ((+); bottom panels). After 6 h of treatment, cells were fixed and images were obtained as described in the legend to Fig. 1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Expression of the Dominant Negative Nucleoporin Mutant ΔCAN Can Cause Nuclear Accumulation of TTP, CMG1, and TIS11DIn mammalian cells, the CAN/Nup214 protein is a component of the nuclear pore complex, and its binding to CRM1 is required for CRM1-mediated export (31.Fornerod M. van Deursen J. van Baal S. Reynolds A. Davis D. Murti K.G. Fransen J. Grosveld G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 807-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). CRM1 activity in cells can be efficiently blocked by overexpression of the dominant negative mutant ΔCAN, a truncated form of the nucleoporin CAN/Nup214 containing only the CRM1-binding site (27.Bogerd H.P. Echarri A. Ross T.M. Cullen B.R. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 8627-8635Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To determine the effect of ΔCAN on TTP, CMG1, and TIS11D nuclear export, plasmids expressing the GFP fusion proteins were co-transfected with ΔCAN or a control plasmid into 293 cells. In the absence of ΔCAN, GFP was distributed throughout the cells (Fig. 3A), whereas GFP-TTP (Fig. 3C), GFP-CMG1 (Fig. 3E), and GFP-TIS11D (Fig. 3G) were predominantly cytoplasmic. In the presence of ΔCAN, GFP remained distributed throughout the cells (Fig. 3B), whereas GFP-TTP (Fig. 3D), GFP-CMG1 (Fig. 3F), and GFP-TIS11D (Fig. 3H) were predominantly nuclear, with nucleolar exclusion. These data, together with the results shown in Fig. 2, demonstrate that TTP, CMG1, and TIS11D can shuttle in and out of the nucleus. Furthermore, nuclear accumulation of the CCCH proteins in the presence either of LMB or ΔCAN indicates that nuclear export of TTP, CMG1, and TIS11D depends on the CRM1 export receptor.Figure 3A dominant negative CRM1 mutant causes nuclear accumulation of TTP, CMG1, and TIS11D. 293 cells (1 × 105 cells per well) were plated on 2-chamber multiwell slides and transfected with 10 ng/well of DNA from the following plasmids: GFP (A and B), GFP-TTP (C and D), GFP-CMG1 (E and F), or GFP-11D (G and H). Cells were co-transfected with either 50 ng of pcDNA3.1 (A, C, E, and G) (CON) or 50 ng of cmvΔCAN plasmid (B, D, F, and H) (dCAN). The total amount of DNA was brought up to 300 ng in each case with pcDNA3.1.

Huber J. Boelens W.C. Mattaj I.W. Luhrmann R. Cell. 1995; 82: 475-483Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (981) Google Scholar). At their carboxyl termini, TTP, CMG1, and TIS11D each contain a cluster of four characteristically spaced hydrophobic residues, similar to this type of NES. In addition, TTP contains a second putative NES at its amino terminus. An alignment of the putative carboxyl-terminal NES in TTP, CMG1, and TIS11D, compared with known NES in other shuttling proteins, is shown in Fig. 4A. In the CCCH proteins, the critical NES residues are strongly conserved among family members from different animal species, including mammals, amphibians, and fish (Fig. 4B). Strikingly, the putative CMG1 and TIS11D NES showed exact amino acid identity across all vertebrate species examined. Therefore, the deletion and mutation analyses discussed below used only CMG1 as a representative of both CMG1 and TIS11D.Figure 4Identification of potential NES in TTP, CMG1, and TIS11D. These alignments show the spatial conservation of the four key hydrophobic residues characteristic of the leucine-rich type of NES (shaded). In each case, the numbers before and after the sequence indicate the amino acid number of the proteins whose accession numbers are listed below.

NSP3 binds to viral mRNA 3' consensus sequences and circularizes the mRNA via interactions with eIF4G. The X-ray structure of the NSP3 RNA binding domain bound to a rotaviral mRNA 3' end has been determined. NSP3 is a novel, heart-shaped homodimer with a medial RNA binding cleft. The homodimer is asymmetric, and contains two similar N-terminal segments plus two structurally different C-terminal segments that intertwine to create a tunnel enveloping the mRNA 3' end. Biophysical studies demonstrate high affinity binding leading to increased thermal stability and slow dissociation kinetics, consistent with NSP3 function."

Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, formerly referred to as Xanthomonas maltophilia or Pseudomonas maltophilia (1.De Swings J. Vos P. Van den Moter M. De Ley J. Int. J. Syst. Bacteriol. 1983; 33: 409-413Crossref Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 2.Palleroni N.J. Bradbury J.F. Int. J. Syst. Bacteriol. 1993; 43: 606-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar), is an aerobic nonfermentative Gram-negative bacterium of widespread occurrence. For healthy humans, it is regarded as an opportunistic germ; it has been implicated in a variety of infections without distinctive clinical features (for a review, see Ref. 3.Denton M. Kerr K.G. Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 1998; 11: 57-80Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, in immune-compromised patients, particularly those with bone marrow aplasia or receiving intensive chemotherapy, cases of fulminant hemorrhagic pneumonia have been reported, even with fatal outcome (4.Elsner H.A. Duhrsen U. Hollwitz B. Kaulfers P.M. Hossfeld D.K. Ann. Hematol. 1997; 74: 155-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 5.Tamura H. Yamashita S. Kusano N. Suzuki C. Yamaguchi Y. Tanigawa K.

Intern. Med. 1999; 38: 671-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). In patients not surviving infections with S. maltophilia, histological inspection of the lung tissue revealed massive bleeding caused by damage to the lung epithelium (4.Elsner H.A. Duhrsen U. Hollwitz B. Kaulfers P.M. Hossfeld D.K. Ann. Hematol. 1997; 74: 155-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). There are further reports demonstrating involvement of this bacterium in massive hemorrhagic processes of the small intestine and the subclavian artery accompanied by severe lesions of the tissue (5.Tamura H. Yamashita S. Kusano N. Suzuki C. Yamaguchi Y. Tanigawa K. Masuhara M. Okita K. Murakami F. J. Gastroenterol. 1998; 33: 412-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 6.Ohkoshi Y. Ninomiya H. Mukai H.Y. Mochizuki N. Hori M. Nagasawa T. Jikuya T. Saida Y. Intern. Med. 1999; 38: 671-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). These observations strongly suggest the participation of proteolytic activity, produced by the bacteria, which may damage the infected tissue. Indeed, it is known that members of the Pseudomonaceae express and secrete a variety of proteases (cf. Ref. 7.Siezen R.J. Leunissen J.A.M. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 501-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (789) Google Scholar). Whereas the primary function of these enzymes is to provide a source of free amino acids for bacterial survival and growth, there is accumulating evidence that bacterial proteases may play a pathogenic role in the infected host by involvement in tissue invasion and destruction, evasion of host defenses, and modulation of the host immune system (8.Travis J. Potempa J. Maeda H. Trends Microbiol. 1995; 3: 405-407Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). The broad administration of antibiotics currently applied in cases of intensive care patients leads to selection of multiresistant S. maltophilia strains. Consequently, these bacteria are found with increasing frequency in the hospital environment. Because of the known multiresistance of this germ toward conventional antibiotics (for a review, see Ref. 9.Quinn J.P. Clin. Infect. Dis. 1998; 27: S117-S124Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar), bacterial proteases involved in the pathogenesis of human diseases are potential targets for specific drug development. This prompted us to test cultures of S. maltophilia obtained from patient material for the presence of proteolytic activity. Indeed, a highly active protease was detected as a major secretion product of the isolated bacteria. This study describes the purification, cloning, and characterization of the S. maltophilia extracellular protease. S. maltophilia was isolated from a bronchoalveolar lavage performed on a patient at the Hamburg university clinic. The identity of the germ was established by standard bacteriological techniques (API 20 NE; BioMérieux, Marcy-L'Etoile, France). Bacteria were grown aerobically at 29 °C in a broth containing 5 μmMnSO4, 0.36 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mml-methionine, 0.8 mmMgSO4, 2.2 mm K2HPO4, 3.7 mm KH2PO4, 6 mm(NH4)2HPO4, 50 mmdisodium succinate, 2 g/liter yeast extract (ICN Biomedicals), 40 mg/liter gentamycin, 50 mg/liter cefotaxim, and 100 mg/liter ampicillin. Cell-free supernatant (12.5 liters) was obtained from S. maltophilia cultures by centrifugation at 4 °C and mixed with 80 ml of DE-52 (Whatman) cellulose equilibrated with 10 mm Tris/HCl buffer, pH 7.4, and the mixture was stirred overnight at 4 °C. The matrix was then collected by sedimentation, transferred into a column, and washed with 10 mm Tris/HCl buffer, pH 7.4. Protein fractions were eluted by a linear gradient of 0–500 mm NaCl in the same buffer at a flow rate of 2 ml/min. 30 fractions of 24 ml were collected and assayed for proteolytic activity (see below). A single peak of activity was detected; the respective fractions were pooled and concentrated by ultrafiltration (Amicon YM 10 membrane) at 4 °C to a final volume of 4 ml. This sample was divided into two aliquots, and each was fractionated at a flow rate of 1 ml/min over a 310-ml column of Fractogel EMD BioSec 650 (Merck) equilibrated with phosphate-buffered saline. Fractions of 6 ml were collected, and the two fractions containing most of the proteolytic activity were pooled and served to characterize the protease. When this purified preparation was compared with the crude bacterial supernatant, similar results were obtained for enzyme action (kinetic parameters, stability, inhibitor pattern, and salt dependence), indicating that the isolated protease is intact and represents the major, if not only, protease produced by the bacteria. The protein concentration in preparations of the native StmPr1 protease was determined on SDS-polyacrylamide gels as described previously (40). Purified recombinant StmPr1 protein, calibrated by the Biuret method (10.Weber W. Bertics P.J. Gill G.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 14631-14636Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11.Goa J. Scand. J. Clin. Lab. Invest. 1953; 5: 218-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (798) Google Scholar), served as a standard. The results were comparable with values calculated from the optical density at 280 nm (mg/ml StmPr1protease = 1.30 × A280). SDS-PAGE was performed as described in Ref. 12.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar. Protein-containing samples were denatured with 10% trichloric acid before electrophoresis. Without this pretreatment, additional bands of lower molecular mass appeared, obviously due to self-digestion of the protease. Protein precipitates were collected by centrifugation and washed with methanol to remove residual trichloric acid. For autofluorography with a covalent inhibitor specific for serine proteases, samples were incubated with 5 μCi of [1,3-3H]diisopropylfluoro-phosphate (PerkinElmer Life Sciences; 8.4 Ci/mmol) for 2 h at 37 °C, precipitated with 10% trichloric acid, and subjected to SDS-PAGE. Polyacrylamide gels were fixed with 10% acetic acid/30% methanol, equilibrated first with water and then with 1 m sodium salicylate, dried, and exposed to Kodak X-Omat film for 90 h at −80 °C. For the initial detection of proteolytic activity in bacterial supernatants, a microassay using the nonspecific chromogenic substrate azoalbumin (Sigma) was performed as described in Ref. 13.Plantner J.J. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 195: 129-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar. In all other cases, a substrate specific for serine proteases was used (0.5 mm Suc-Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe-pNA, unless otherwise stated). Hydrolysis was allowed to occur in 200 μl of 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 9.0, containing 400 mmNaCl at 37 °C. The amount of released p-nitroaniline within initial time intervals was measured at 405 nm (ε405 = 9600 m−1cm−1). For determination of the IC50 of protease inhibitors (antipain and chymostatin), assays contained 1.4 mm (Km) of the substrate Suc-Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe-pNA and inhibitor over a wide range of concentration. The IC50 is obtained as the constant b in a nonlinear regression analysis of the function (a/(b +10x)) when the reaction velocity is plotted versus log10 of the inhibitor concentration (x). Kinetic experiments with various synthetic peptide p-nitroanilide substrates were carried out in 100 mm Tris/HCl buffer, pH 8.2, at 25 °C and in the presence of 5% dimethylformamide. The enzyme concentration was usually in the range of 1.95 × 10−8 to 9.12 × 10−9m, and the concentration of the substrate varied between 1.6 × 10−3 and 1.2 × 10−4m. Kinetic parameters were calculated from initial rate measurements of substrate hydrolysis using a nonlinear regression analysis based on the function (Vmax * x/(Km +x)), with x = the concentration of substrate. After SDS-PAGE, the protein was blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Immobilon P; Millipore) and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. The excised band was sequenced by standard Edman degradation on an automated sequencer (Applied Biosystems 476A). To obtain internal sequence information, the Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250-stained protein band was cut out of the SDS gel and in-gel digested with the endoproteases Lys-C or Asp-N (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) in 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.5, containing 1 mm EDTA (for digestion with Lys-C) or 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0 (for digestion with Asp-N), at 37 °C overnight. The peptides obtained were separated by reverse phase HPLC 1The abbreviations used are: HPLChigh pressure liquid chromatographyTLCKNα-p-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketoneTPCKl-1- tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone on a Vydac C4 column (250 × 2.1 mm) at a flow rate of 200 μl/min. The following gradient was applied: 2–80% B over a 50-min period (solvent A, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water; solvent B, 0.085% trifluoroacetic acid in 70% acetonitrile). The isolated peptides were sequenced by Edman degradation following standard procedures. high pressure liquid chromatography Nα-p-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone l-1- tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone DNA oligomers were synthesized complementary to the amino-terminal sequence PYYQQYQ and to the reverse complement of the sequence APAAMRT obtained by digestion of the purified protease with the endoprotease Lys-C (see above). Using these primers (40 pmol each), amplification of chromosomal DNA (200 ng) from S. maltophilia with Taq polymerase (Qiagen) yielded a DNA fragment of 930 bp, which was sequenced (Applied Biosystems 377). The sequence showed homology to known protease sequences and served to design gene-specific primers. The rest of the upstream and downstream portions of the gene were cloned by alternate application of inverse PCR (14.Ochman H. Medhora M. Garza D. Hartl D.L. Innis M.A. Gelfand D.H. Sninski J.J. White T.J. PCR Protocols: A Guide to Methods and Applications. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1990: 219-227Google Scholar) using the EcoRII and HinfI restriction sites and PCR using as template dA-tailed fragments of genomic DNA generated by AatII, PstI, or SphI digestion, and one gene-specific oligonucleotide plus poly-dT as primers. A final PCR product was obtained using the Expand Long Template PCR System (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), and primers comprising the identified start codon and stop codon, respectively, were sequenced, cloned into the pGem-T Easy vector (Promega), and resequenced for verification. The sequence of the StmPr1 gene has been deposited in the European Molecular Biology Laboratory nucleotide sequence data base; the accession number is AJ291488. Hydrolysis of the oxidized insulin B chain (Sigma) was performed in 50 mm Tris/HCl buffer, pH 8.0, at room temperature for 10 min and for 4 h. The reaction mixture (2 ml) contained the enzyme and the substrate in a ratio of 1:200. The peptides obtained after the enzymatic hydrolysis were separated by reverse phase HPLC on a Vydac C18 column (125 × 2.1 mm) at a flow rate of 200 μl/min, and the following gradient was applied: 2–65% B over a 50-min period (solvent A, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water; solvent B, 0.085% trifluoroacetic acid in 70% acetonitrile). The obtained peptides were identified by mass spectrometry on a hybrid tandem mass spectrometer (Qtof II; Micromass) equipped with a nanoelectrospray ion source. 10 μl of the collected fractions were vacuum dried and redissolved in 5 μl of 60% methanol/5% formic acid. 1 μl of this solution was transferred into a gold-coated nanoelectrospray needle (Micromass). From the masses of the peptides determined, a tentative assignment to fragments of the insulin B chain was derived. The assignment was confirmed by subsequent tandem mass spectrometric measurements of the peptide fragmentation pattern or, in some cases, by Edman degradation. A culture of S. maltophilia was grown from a specimen of an immunocompromised patient. Proteolytic activity was detected in the cell-free growth medium of the bacterial culture using azo-albumin as an unspecific chromogenic substrate (data not shown). To optimize bacterial cultures as a source for purification of the putative protease, the production of the enzyme during culture growth was measured. As shown in Fig. 1, the proteolytic activity is hardly detectable in the early stages of the culture; rather, protease production is up-regulated only toward the end of the exponential phase of the growth curve. Proteolytic activity reached a maximum after about 22 h and remained unchanged for at least 3 days. A culture supernatant of S. maltophilia served as a source for the protease isolation. Adsorption on an anion exchange resin was applied to concentrate and separate proteins from the bacterial broth; elution by a salt gradient yielded a single peak of proteolytic activity, which was then further fractionated by gel filtration. SDS gel electrophoresis of the protease-containing fraction revealed one major band of 47-kDa apparent molecular mass (Fig. 2A). Comparison with the electrophoretic pattern of the crude bacterial supernatant indicated that the 47-kDa protein represents the major secretory product of S. maltophilia. Amino-terminal sequencing of the 47-kDa band yielded the sequence LAPNDPYYQQ, which turned out to be absent from protein sequence data bases. The sequence, however, showed homology with the amino termini of several known bacterial proteases, the closest of which is a serine protease from Dichelobacter nodosus (15.Lilley G.G. Stewart D.J. Kortt A.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 210: 13-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), a member of the family of subtilisin-like proteases (cf. Ref. 7.Siezen R.J. Leunissen J.A.M. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 501-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (789) Google Scholar). Covalent coupling with the radioactive inhibitor [3H]difluorophosphate confirmed that the 47-kDa protein of S. maltophilia is a serine protease (Fig. 2B). When the crude bacterial supernatant was allowed to react with the inhibitor, autoradiographs also showed mainly the 47-kDa band; the faint labeling of a lower molecular mass band may indicate a degradation product or the presence of another serine protease in trace amounts. Thus, the 47-kDa protein seems to be the enzyme mainly responsible for the extracellular proteolytic activity of S. maltophilia. To analyze the sequence of the protease and determine its relationship to other proteases, the gene was cloned by PCR techniques. Sequences from the amino terminus of the purified protein and from an internal peptide (PLAPAAMRT) generated by Lys-C digestion served to design degenerate primers. Using genomic DNA of S. maltophilia as a template, a 930-bp amplified fragment was obtained. Sequencing of the missing carboxyl-terminal portion of the gene required additional steps of 3′-extension: PCR using poly(A)-tailed fragments of genomic DNA as PCR template and inverse PCR from highly diluted DNA fragments were applied until a stop codon was found (Fig. 3). Because it is common for most prokaryotic extracellular proteases to be produced as larger precursor proteins (cf.Ref. 7.Siezen R.J. Leunissen J.A.M. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 501-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (789) Google Scholar), 5′-extension of the DNA sequence was performed to obtain the sequence of the entire gene. Applying the same techniques for extension as outlined above, a sequence was obtained that contained a stop codon within the reading frame and only one ATG coding for a methionine in position −132. However, two points argue against this ATG coding for the translation initiation of the protease precursor: (i) it is not preceded by a typical Shine-Dalgarno ribosome binding site, and (ii) the sequence 3′ to this ATG does not predict a signal peptide typical for Gram-negative bacteria (16.Nielsen H.

Therefore, we assume that, following an alternative bacterial codon usage, a GTG codes for translation initiation, resulting in a methionine in position −150. In this case, the synthax for both Shine-Dalgarno and signal sequences would be met (Fig. 3). Further evidence for this GTG to function as a start codon for the protease precursor came from the recombinant expression of the gene. When the DNA starting with the GTG in question (and not with ATG in position −132) was expressed in Escherichia coli, the protein was correctly processed, resulting in the mature protease with full enzymatic activity (data not shown). The DNA sequence of the gene was further established, and the amino-terminal sequences of the processed recombinant protein and of the native protease were found to be identical. Moreover, antibodies generated against the native protein also recognized the recombinant gene product (data not shown). Taken together, the open reading frame encodes a protein with a deduced molecular mass of 63.0 kDa, corresponding to 618 amino acids in length (Fig. 3). The 27-residue stretch of the amino terminus was predicted to be the signal peptide containing a potential signal peptidase cleavage site (16.Nielsen H. Engelbrecht J. Brunak S. von Heijne G. Protein Eng. 1997; 10: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (4942) Google Scholar) between Ala−124 and Ala−123. Following the putative signal sequence and preceding the amino terminus of the mature protein, there is a pro-region of 123 residues. Finally, the sequence between the amino terminus, identified in the native protein, and the carboxyl terminus as indicated by the stop codon corresponds to a protein that encompasses 467 amino acids with a theoretical pI = 4.91 and a calculated molecular mass of 47,446 Da. The S. maltophilia protease gene was termed StmPr1 (European Molecular Biology Laboratory accession number AJ291488); the term takes into account that another protease gene (StmPr2) 2S. Windhorst and W. Weber, manuscript in preparation. was detected in S. maltophilia during preparation of this manuscript. Comparison of the StmPr1 protease sequence with those of known bacterial serine proteases confirmed its relation to the subtilisin family of proteases (cf. Ref. 7.Siezen R.J. Leunissen J.A.M. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 501-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (789) Google Scholar). Alignment of the sequences indicated that Asp42, His105, and Ser289 form the putative catalytic triad characteristic for serine proteases. In the active site region, there is considerable homology with other subtilisins; in Fig. 3, conserved residues that are shared with subtilisin BPN′ (17.Markland F.S. Smith E.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 5198-5211Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and proteinase K (18.Jany K.D. Lederer G. Mayer B. FEBS Lett. 1986; 199: 139-144Crossref Scopus (104) Google Scholar) are marked with open boxes as typical representatives of the “classic” subtilisins. Nevertheless, the StmPr1protease sequence reveals significant structural differences from these related enzymes due to large inserts adjacent to the catalytic His105 and Ser289. Therefore, compared with the catalytic triad formed by Asp32, His64, and Ser221 in the typical members of the subtilisin family, the architecture of the active site should be different in the StmPr1 protease. In addition, this enzyme has a longer carboxyl-terminal extension beyond the active site, which, together with the inserts in the catalytic region, makes the entire sequence almost 100 residues longer. With these structural properties, the StmPr1 protease is similar to the extracellular proteases of Xanthomonas campestris (19.Liu Y.N. Tang J.L. Clarke B.R. Dow J.M. Daniels M.J. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1990; 220: 433-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), D. nodosus (15.Lilley G.G. Stewart D.J. Kortt A.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 210: 13-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), and Alteromonas sp. (20.Tsujibo H. Miyamoto K. Tanaka K. Kaidzu Y. Imada C. Okami Y. Inamori Y. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 1996; 60: 1284-1288Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar); the homology with these proteases is 49%, 40%, and 38% identity, respectively, for the mature proteins. On the other hand, there is only low homology within the region of the carboxyl-terminal extensions, and no homology can be seen between the pro-sequences. The sequence homology between the StmPr1protease and the classic subtilisins is also lower, e.g.23% identity with proteinase K (18.Jany K.D. Lederer G. Mayer B. FEBS Lett. 1986; 199: 139-144Crossref Scopus (104) Google Scholar) within the region of the mature enzymes. In view of the sequence differences between the well-characterized subtilisins and the StmPr1 protease, it was important to analyze the enzymatic activity of the new protease in detail. The StmPr1 protease hydrolyzes the widely used chromogenic substrate Suc-Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe-pNA with a Km of 1.4 mm. This substrate was used for characterization of the enzyme purified from the native source. The enzyme activity of the purified StmPr1 protease was measured in the pH range 4–11 (Fig. 4A) and showed a typical bell shape. The optimum pH was 9.0, classifying the StmPr1protein as an alkaline protease. Pre-exposure of the protease to extreme pH (0.1 m acetic acid, pH 3) for 10 min on ice resulted in a 68% loss of enzyme activity. A study of the salt requirement for enzyme activity was conducted by assaying the enzyme at pH 9. Raising the final NaCl concentration to 0.4 m increased activity about 4-fold (Fig. 4B). No further increase in enzyme activity was observed at higher salt concentrations (1 m NaCl was the maximum concentration tested). The stimulating effect of NaCl has also been reported for several other proteases of the subtilisin family (21.Babe L.M. Schmidt B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1386: 211-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Enzyme activity was also found to be stimulated by calcium, which was effective at low concentrations: a maximum 3.5-fold increase in activity was observed at 50 mm calcium chloride. The effects of Na+ and Ca2+ were not additive. Ca2+ can be replaced by Mg2+ to achieve the same activating effect (data not shown). Thus, the StmPr1 protease is an enzyme dependent on bivalent metal ions; the strong activation effect of the cations can be explained by a conformational change leading to a catalytically more active conformation. Na+ possibly binds to the same site and may substitute for Ca2+ at higher concentrations. A remarkable property of the StmPr1 protease is its relative stability toward the anionic detergent sodium dodecyl sulfate (Fig. 4C). The enzyme preserved 85% of its activity in the presence of 0.1% detergent, and even at a concentration of 1% dodecyl sulfate, 45% of proteolytic activity was retained. Similar results indicating a particular conformational stability have been reported for some, mainly microbial, proteases (cf. Ref. 22.Rao M.B. Tanksale A.M. Ghatge M.S. Deshpande V.V. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 597-635Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). By contrast, the mammalian serine protease chymotrypsin tested under the same conditions completely lost its activity at a concentration of 0.1% dodecyl sulfate. To get more information on the type of protease, the effect of a series of protease inhibitors on StmPr1 enzyme activity was tested (Table I). The enzyme was effectively inhibited by antipain, chymostatin, and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, whereas other serine protease inhibitors such as leupeptin, TLCK, and TPCK were not effective. The lack of inhibitory activity of TPCK is in contrast to the reported effect of this compound on subtilisin (21.Babe L.M. Schmidt B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1386: 211-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar,23.Serrano L. Avila J. Maccioni R.B. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 4675-4681Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). The StmPr1 protease is not inhibited by EDTA, presumably because the calcium bound to the enzyme cannot be chelated, and the protein remains structurally unaffected. This result demonstrates that metal ions are not directly involved in the catalytic mechanism, which is characteristic for subtilisins and other serine proteases.Table IEffects of various substances on the activity of StmPr1 proteaseInhibitorMaximum concentration tested (μm)InhibitionIC50 (μm)Antipain100+19Aprotinin0.3−Bestatin130−Chymostatin100+0.4E-6428−EDTA-Na210000−Leupeptin1.1−Pepstatin0.7−Phosphoramidon500−PMSF2000+TLCK150−TPCK300−The purified enzyme was preincubated with the substances for 20 min prior to reaction at pH 9 with Suc-Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe-pNA as substrate.

The (covalently binding) inhibitor phenylmethyl sulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) completely abolished protease activity at a concentration of 1 mm. Of interest with respect to the pathogenic potential of the StmPr1 protease was the observation that human plasma protease inhibitors α1-antitrypsin and α2-macroglobulin could not abolish the proteolytic activity of the enzyme; as shown below (Fig. 6), these two polypeptide inhibitors themselves are subject to proteolytic digestion through the bacterial protease. The properties of the StmPr1 protease clearly show that this enzyme is different from proteases isolated from P. maltophilia in 1975 (24.Böthling R.S. J. Bacteriol. 1975; 121: 933-941Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and in 1985 (25.Kobayashi T. Ogasawara A. Ito S. Saitoh M. Agric. Biol. Chem. 1985; 49: 693-698Google Scholar).

Unsaturated fatty acids are essential cellular constituents, serving not only as structural components of membranes but also as bioactive metabolites. One important class of these lipids is collectively known as polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) 1The abbreviations used are: PUFApolyunsaturated fatty acidGLAγ-linolenic acidMUFAmonounsaturated fatty acidORFopen reading framePEA1polyunsaturated fatty acid elongating activityFAE1fatty acid elongationtstemperature-sensitiveERendoplasmic reticulumYPDyeast peptone dextrose mediaGC-MSgas chromatography-mass spectrometryWTwild type ; these are defined as fatty acids of 18 carbons or more (C18+), which contain two or more double bonds (1.Broun P. Gettner S. Somerville C. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1999; 19: 197-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). In mammals, 20 carbon (C20) PUFAs have been shown to be the biological precursors of a group of molecules called the eicosanoids, which includes the prostaglandins, leukotrienes, and thromboxanes (2.Gill I. Valivety R. Trends Bio/Technol. 1997; 15: 401-409Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). The eicosanoids have roles in inflammation responses as well as cardiac and reproductive function. This obvious importance of PUFAs has resulted in considerable interest in the characterization of their biosynthetic pathway (3.Napier J.A. Michaelson L.V. Stobart A.K. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 1999; 2: 123-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), and we have identified a new class of fatty acid desaturases required for PUFA biosynthesis, which contain an N-terminally fused cytochrome b5 domain (4.Napier J.A. Sayanova O. Sperling P. Heinz E. Trends Plant Sci. 1999; 4: 2-4Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (88) Google Scholar). polyunsaturated fatty acid γ-linolenic acid monounsaturated fatty acid open reading frame polyunsaturated fatty acid elongating activity fatty acid elongation temperature-sensitive endoplasmic reticulum yeast peptone dextrose media gas chromatography-mass spectrometry wild type More recently, we have also identified a component of the PUFA fatty acyl-chain elongation system, which when heterologously expressed in yeast, directs the C2 elongation of the C18PUFA γ-linolenic acid (18:3(n-6); GLA) to the C20 PUFA di-homo-γ-linolenic acid (20:3(n-6)) (5.Beaudoin F.

This component (Caenorhabditis elegans ORF F56H11.4, designated PEA1 for polyunsaturated fatty acidelongating activity (5.Beaudoin F. Michaelson L.V. Hey S.J. Lewis M.J. Shewry P.R. Napier J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6421-6426Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 6.Napier J.A. Michaelson L.V. Lipids. 2001; 36: 761-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar)) shows some limited homology to the yeast ELO gene family, which have been shown genetically to be required for the synthesis of saturated medium and very long-chain fatty acids (7.Toke D.A. Martin C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18413-18422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 8.Oh C.S. Toke D.A. Mandala S. Martin C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17373-17384Google Scholar). Although the precise biochemical function of the C. elegans PUFA-elongating activity PEA1 and the polypeptides encoded by the ELO genes remain to be elucidated, it is generally considered that they serve as condensing enzymes (5.Beaudoin F. Michaelson L.V. Hey S.J. Lewis M.J. Shewry P.R. Napier J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6421-6426Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 6.Napier J.A. Michaelson L.V. Lipids. 2001; 36: 761-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The steps in the biosynthetic pathway of C20 PUFAs are indicated in a generalized scheme (Fig. 1), with the key step of C2elongation of C18 substrates highlighted. The biosynthesis of C20+ fatty acids has also been observed in higher plants, although the elongated fatty acids are quite distinct to those observed in mammals. Although C18 PUFAs such as α-linolenic acid and linoleic acid accumulate to high levels in plants, the presence of C20 PUFAs has not been observed (1.Broun P. Gettner S. Somerville C. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1999; 19: 197-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). However, some higher plants, most notably members of the Brassicas such as oil seed rape and Arabidopsis, synthesize C20 and C22 monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) (9.Millar A.A. Kunst L. Phytochemistry. 1999; 52: 1029-1033Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). These C20+ fatty acids are the product of (several cycles of) C2 fatty acyl elongation of a monounsaturated C18 substrate, oleic acid (18:1Δ9). The biosynthesis of higher plant C20/22 MUFAs has been shown to require a single gene, FAE1 (fattyacid elongation), which encodes a putative condensing enzyme (10.Millar A.A. Kunst L. Plant J. 1997; 12: 121-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). The Fae1p condensing enzyme displays specificity only for saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids (9.Millar A.A. Kunst L. Phytochemistry. 1999; 52: 1029-1033Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 10.Millar A.A. Kunst L. Plant J. 1997; 12: 121-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). Importantly, although Fae1p shows some limited homology to analogous condensing enzymes such as chalcone and stilbene synthases, it displays no similarity to the Elo protein family; conversely no homologues of Fae1p are present in yeast. Fatty acid elongation is carried out by a microsomal “elongase,” which consists of four distinct enzymatic reactions (11.Cinti D.L. Cook L. Nagi M.H. Suneja S.K. Prog. Lipid Res. 1992; 31: 1-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). In sequential order, these are a condensation reaction between a CoA-esterified fatty acyl substrate and malonyl-CoA, β-keto reduction, dehydration, and a final enoyl reduction. It has been hypothesized that the specificity of any particular elongation reaction is conferred through the selectivity of the first condensation step. Conversely it is believed that the three other components (two reductases and a dehydratase) are common to all microsomal fatty acyl elongases and have no particular substrate specificity (11.Cinti D.L. Cook L. Nagi M.H. Suneja S.K. Prog. Lipid Res. 1992; 31: 1-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). This is given credence by the observation that heterologous expression in yeast of the plant Fae1p condensing enzyme successfully reconstitutes a functional C20+ MUFA-specific elongase (9.Millar A.A. Kunst L. Phytochemistry. 1999; 52: 1029-1033Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Similarly, we have also observed effective reconstitution of the PUFA-specific elongase (via by heterologous expression of the C. elegans Pea1p in yeast) (5.Beaudoin F. Michaelson L.V. Hey S.J. Lewis M.J. Shewry P.R. Napier J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6421-6426Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), even though yeast has no endogenous capacity for either of these particular biosynthetic reactions. We have hypothesized that these heterologous elongating activities function by “hi-jacking” endogenous microsomal elongases, which in the case of yeast, are primarily synthesizing the C20–26saturated fatty acid components of sphingolipids (5.Beaudoin F. Michaelson L.V. Hey S.J. Lewis M.J. Shewry P.R. Napier J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6421-6426Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). This results in the presumptive redirection of the three endogenous components (reductases and dehydratase) toward non-native substrates. Until very recently, little was known about the identity of these other three enzyme activities and their precise contribution(s) to the activity and specificity of microsomal fatty acid elongases. Kohlwein et al. (12.Kohlwein S.D. Eder S. Oh C.S. Martin C.E. Gable K. Bacikova D. Dunn T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 109-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar) characterized the TSC13 gene, which is one of a number of genes identified in a screen for temperature-sensitive (ts) mutants with defects in sphingolipid synthesis (13.Beeler T. Bacikova D. Gable K. Hopkins L. Johnson C. Slife H. Dunn T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30688-30694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Mutants with ts alleles of TSC13 displayed phenotypes similar to the elo2Δ and elo3Δ mutants, including the accumulation of high levels of long-chain bases, the accumulation of ceramides with chain lengths of less than 26 carbons, and a deficiency in very long chain fatty acid synthesis (12.Kohlwein S.D. Eder S. Oh C.S. Martin C.E. Gable K. Bacikova D. Dunn T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 109-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Microsomal fatty acid elongation assays revealed that the tsc13 mutation caused the accumulation of trans-2,3- and 3-hydroxy-acyl intermediates; these observations, taken together with the homology between Tsc13p and steroid-5-α-reductase, are consistent with the TSC13 gene encoding the enoyl-reductase component of the microsomal elongase. Furthermore, epitope-tagged Tsc13p was shown to co-immunoprecipitate with the presumptive condensing enzymes Elo2p and Elo3p (12.Kohlwein S.D. Eder S. Oh C.S. Martin C.E. Gable K. Bacikova D. Dunn T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 109-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Interestingly, a precise ER location for Tsc13p, enriched at sites of vacuole-nuclear envelope interaction, was observed. TSC13 is essential, as is expected for a gene encoding a non-redundant fatty acid elongating activity (12.Kohlwein S.D. Eder S. Oh C.S. Martin C.E. Gable K. Bacikova D. Dunn T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 109-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). As part of our studies on microsomal fatty acid elongation, we have sought to identify other enzymatic components of the fatty acid elongase. To that end, we screened yeast knockout mutants for loss-of-function of our heterologous PUFA elongating activity PEA1 (5.Beaudoin F. Michaelson L.V. Hey S.J. Lewis M.J. Shewry P.R. Napier J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6421-6426Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Using this approach we identified a previously functionally uncharacterized gene required for the reconstitution of heterologous elongase activity. The Saccharomyces cerevisiae ORF encoded by YBR159w was cloned by PCR into the pESC-TRP vector (Stratagene). A crude DNA extract was prepared using the reference strain W303-1A. 1 ml of an overnight culture in rich medium (YPD) was centrifuged at 3000 × g for 5 min at room temperature, and the cells were resuspended in 0.5 ml of TE buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, mm EDTA). This suspension was boiled for 10 min, and the extract was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 5 min. 1 μl of the supernatant was used for PCR amplification using primers YBR159.for (5′-GCGGGATCCACCATGACTTTTATGCAACAGC-3′) and YBR159.rev (5′-GCGGGTACCCTATTCCTTTTTAACCGTCT TGC-3′). The amplified sequence was then restricted using BamHI and KpnI (underlined in the forward and reverse primers, respectively), purified using the Qiagen PCR purification kit, and ligated into BamHI/KpnI-cut pESC-TRP plasmid vector (Stratagene). An Arabidopsis thaliana expressed sequence tag (GenBankTM accession number: AA10E08; kindly provided by Prof. H. J. Bohnert, University of Arizona) derived from gene F12A21.31 was used as template DNA for PCR amplification using primers At159.for (5′-GCGGGATCCACCATGGAGATCTGCACTTACTTC-3′) and At159.rev (5′-GCGCTCGAGTCATTCTTTCTTCATGGAGTC-3′). The amplified sequence was then restricted using BamHI and XhoI (underlined in the forward and reverse primers, respectively) and cloned into BamHI/XhoI-cut pESC-TRP as described above. ORFs encoding putative β-ketoacyl-reductase activities and elongase or desaturase constructs were introduced in Saccharomyces cerevisiae using a lithium acetate-based method (14.Elble R. BioTechniques. 1992; 13: 18-20PubMed Google Scholar). Expression of the transgenes was induced by addition of 2% (w/v) galactose in the presence or absence of exogenously supplied fatty acid substrates as described previously (15.Michaelson L.V. Lazarus C.M. Griffiths G. Napier J.A. Stobart A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19055-19059Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The mutant strain used in this study was CEN.RO16; Mat a/α; ura3–52/ura3–52; his3Δ1/his3Δ1; leu2–3_112/leu2–3_112; trp1–289/trp1–289; ybr159Δ::HIS3/YBR159w, obtained from European S accharomycescerevisiae Archive forFunctional Analysis (EUROSCARF) (available at www.uni-frankfurt.de/fb15/mikro/euroscarf/index.html). This strain was transformed with a pYES2 construct containing the C. elegansPUFA elongating activity PEA1 (F56H11.4) and sporulated in SPM liquid media as described previously (16.Kassir Y. Simchen G. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 94-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). After sporulation, asci were digested with β-glucuronidase (Sigma Chemical Co.), and the tetrads were dissected using light microscopy and a micromanipulator as described (17.Sherman F. Hicks J. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 21-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Separated ascospores were grown on YPD for up to 2 weeks at 22 °C, and the mating type of each haploid colony tested using two yeast strains, a sst1 and α sst2(18.Sprague Jr., G.F. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 77-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). “Wild type” (Mat a or α; ura3–52; his3Δ1; leu2–3_112; trp1–289) and mutant spores (Mat a or α; ura3–52; his3Δ1; leu2–3_112; trp1–289; ybr159Δ::HIS3) were identified by replica plating on synthetic dextrose medium lacking histidine. This was also confirmed by PCR using primers 159_prom.for (5′-CGGATTTGGAAGTCCTTTATAG-3′) and 5′_his3.rev (5′-CGCTTTACTAGGGCTTTCTGC-3′). Wild type and mutant spore colonies containing the PUFAs-elongase construct in pYES2 were selected by replica plating on synthetic dextrose medium lacking uracil. Total fatty acids extracted from yeast cultures were analyzed by gas chromatography (GC) of methyl ester derivatives. Lipids were extracted and transmethylated with methanolic HCl. Fatty acid methyl esters were analyzed as described before (19.Sayanova O. Smith M.A. Lapinskas P. Stobart A.K. Dobson G. Christie W.W. Shewry P.R. Napier J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Induced peaks were characterized using GC-MS (Kratos Analytical Instruments MS80RFA) operating at an ionization voltage of 70 eV with a scan range 40–500 Da and as described before (19.Sayanova O.

Microsomes were prepared from the wild type or ybr159Δ mutant cells as has been previously described (20.Gable K. Slife H. Bacikova D. Monaghan E. Dunn T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7597-7603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Total elongase activity was measured in a volume of 200 μl containing 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mm MgCl2, 150 μm Triton X-100, 1 mm NADPH, 1 mm NADH, 10 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, 40 μm palmitoyl-CoA, 60 μm 2[14C]malonyl-CoA (0.05 μCi/ml) at 37 °C. The reaction was initiated by the addition of 0.4 mg of microsomal protein. Protein concentrations were determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay reagent (Bio-Rad Laboratories). For assays of only the condensing activity, the NADPH and NADH were omitted. At various times (0.2, 1, or 5 min) the reaction was terminated by adding 200 μl of 5 m KOH/10% MeOH and heating at 80 °C for 1 h. Following addition of 200 μl of 10 nH2SO4, fatty acids were recovered by two 1.5-ml extractions into hexane. The extracted fatty acids were resolved by silica gel TLC using hexane:diethyl ether:acetic acid (30:70:1) as the developing solvent and detected and quantified using a PhosphorImager SI (Molecular Dynamics, Inc.). In an attempt to identify genes or genes that encode the β-keto-reductase of the microsomal elongase, we searched the complete genome sequence of the yeast S. cerevisiae (predicted to encode between 5000 and 6000 polypeptides) (21.Zhang C.T. Wang J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 2804-2814Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) for protein sequences likely to encode oxidoreductases. This was carried out either on a homology basis to known oxidoreductases or via the presence of the diagnostic NADH binding motif (22.Chang S.-I. Hammes G.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 8373-8376Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Because this generated over 200 candidates, the search was refined to exclude proteins already clearly functionally characterized, as well as cytosolic oxidoreductases. By excluding predicted ORFs, which lacked a canonical dilysine ER retention motif, the search was further refined to identify predicted oxidoreductases likely to have a transmembrane topology and to be located in the ER. This approach allowed us to consider a small number (∼10) of genes for functional characterization as potential microsomal fatty acyl elongase components (listed in Table I). A number of these selected oxidoreductases ORFs had previously been shown by high throughput deletion analysis to be non-essential for viability. Yeast mutants in which the non-essential candidate genes were disrupted were assayed for any loss of ability to carry out heterologous PUFA elongation. Thus, a galactose-inducible, URA3-marked plasmid carrying the C. elegans PEA1 PUFA elongatingactivity (5.Beaudoin F. Michaelson L.V. Hey S.J. Lewis M.J. Shewry P.R. Napier J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Open table in a new tab YBR159w was previously reported as being essential, although results obtained in this study indicate that ybr159Δ mutant cells are actually viable. The activity of the heterologous elongating activity PEA1 in deletion mutant strains is indicated. Characterization for loss-of-function in haploid knockout mutants of the eight non-essential oxidoreductases (Table I) revealed no alteration in their ability to reconstitute the heterologous PUFA elongase and redirect the elongation of C18 PUFAs. Although the synthesis of very long-chain fatty acids is essential for yeast cell viability (8.Oh C.S. Toke D.A. Mandala S. Martin C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17373-17384Google Scholar), previous directed ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS) mutant screens for defects in fatty acid elongation only identified the ELO1 gene as a potential elongase component, implying that other elongase genes are either essential or display functional redundancy (7.Toke D.A.

Biochem. 1998; 252: 477-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). To address the possibility that the (annotated as) essential gene YBR159w encoded an oxidoreductase component of the microsomal elongase, a diploid yeast strain heterozygous for disruption of YBR159w was transformed with a plasmid containing the PEA1 ORF. Following sporulation and tetrad dissection, the spores were allowed to germinate on YPD media. Using this approach, we observed that the ybr159Δ haploid deletion was in fact viable, although PCR confirmed the insertional disruption of this oxidoreductase ORF in mutant haploid cells (data not shown). When compared with wild type spores isolated from the same tetrad, spores containing the disrupted gene showed a very reduced growth rate, with small colonies appearing usually only after 10 days of incubation at 22 °C. An initial study described deletion of YBR159w (in strain ENY.MR17) as resulting in poor growth (only at low temperatures) with a pseudo-hyphal phenotype (24.Rose M. Kiesau P. Proft M. Entian K.D. Yeast. 1995; 11: 865-871Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), although in a subsequent study it was reported that YBR159w was an essential gene in the CEN.PK2 background (25.Entian K.D. Schuster T. Hegemann J.H. Becher D. Feldmann H. Guldener U. Gotz R. Hansen M. Hollenberg C.P. Jansen G. Kramer W. Klein S. Kotter P. Kricke J. Launhardt H. Mannhaupt G. Maierl A. Meyer P. Mewes W.

Genet. 1999; 262: 683-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). In our current study, we used the same parental diploid heterozygote as used in the latter study (CEN.PK2 strain background), although after sporulation the haploid ybr159Δ mutants were viable even at 30 °C. Indeed, although it took about 10 days for mutant spores to germinate and to form a colony after meiosis (see above), ybr159Δ cells are able to grow at 30 °C in rich medium (in the absence of fatty acid supplements) but at a slower rate than wild type (Fig. 2). Interestingly, cultivating ybr159Δ cells in a media supplemented with medium and long-chain fatty acids did not improve the growth rate (data not shown). However, we observed that the ybr159Δ mutant displayed temperature sensitivity when transferred to 37 °C. We also examined the phenotypic appearance of the CEN.PK strain ybr159Δ mutant cells and observed the previously reported (for strain ENY.MR17) pseudo-hyphal growth (24.Rose M. Kiesau P. Proft M. Entian K.D. Yeast. 1995; 11: 865-871Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). However, genetic analysis indicates that this phenotype is unlinked to the ybr159Δ mutation. 2T. Dunn, unpublished observations. The ability of the heterologous elongating activity Pea1p to function in the ybr159Δ deletion was tested by galactose induction as described above. Wild type haploid colonies displayed PUFA elongating activity resulting in the conversion of 18:3(n-6) (GLA) into 20:3(n-6) (di-homo-γ-linolenic acid), whereas deletion mutant haploids completely failed to elongate heterologous C18 PUFAs (Fig. 3, top panel). We tested the galactose inducibility of other pYES2-directed enzyme activities in this haploid knockout strain to assess the possibility of pleiotropic effects on either galactose uptake or lipid metabolism. However, when two other (heterologous) enzymes of the PUFA biosynthetic pathway (borage Δ6-desaturase (19.Sayanova O. Smith M.A. Lapinskas P. Stobart A.K. Dobson G. Christie W.W. Shewry P.R.

Northern blot analysis of mutant cells expressing the heterologous elongase revealed no alteration in transcript abundance when compared with wild type (data not shown). Thus, deletion of YBR159w had a specific effect on the activity of the heterologous PUFA elongase reconstituted by expression of PEA1. This was given additional weight by our observation that YBR159w was also required for the activity of the Arabidopsis microsomal elongase condensing enzyme FAE1 (10.Millar A.A. Kunst L. Plant J. 1997; 12: 121-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar); expression of Fae1p in ybr159Δ haploid strains failed to accumulate C20+ MUFAs (Fig. 3, bottom panel).Table IIExpression of desaturase genes in ybr159Δ yeastEpisomal gene Haploid genotypeBorΔ6 (+LA)FAT1 (+LA)ybr159ΔWTybr159ΔWTmol%Fatty acid 16:014.5 ± 0.915.6 ± 1.214.1 ± 0.616.2 ± 0.7 16:1Δ943.5 ± 3.738.8 ± 2.648.2 ± 2.443.8 ± 2.3 16:2Δ6,122.9 ± 1.23.1 ± 1.1 18:04.2 ± 1.04.2 ± 0.73.1 ± 0.44.0 ± 0.3 18:1Δ915.8 ± 1.913.5 ± 1.317.1 ± 1.214.1 ± 0.7 18:2Δ9,12 (LA)13.9 ± 2.517.4 ± 2.616.1 ± 1.519.7 ± 0.9 α18:3Δ9,12,15 (ALA)1.4 ± 0.52.2 ± 0.7 γ18:3Δ6,9,12 (GLA)5.2 ± 2.27.4 ± 1.7%% Desaturation 16:1Δ9 6 7.5 18:2Δ9,12 (LA)2729.88.010.0Fatty acid composition of ybr159Δ or wild type yeast transformed with either the borage Δ6-fatty acid desaturase (BorΔ6) or the C. elegans ω3-fatty acid desaturase (EAT1) cloned into the pYES2 vector (Invitrogen) under the control of the GAL1 promoter.

The current study describes a novel mechanism by which ATF3 regulates transcription. Progressive deletions of the MMP-2 promoter indicated a 38-base pair region (−1659/−1622) necessary for the ATF3-mediated repression. This region lacked CREB/AP-1 motifs but contained a consensus p53 motif shown previously to regulate MMP-2 expression. The activity of a p53 response element-driven luciferase reporter was reduced in ATF3-expressing HT1080 clones. Although MMP-2 promoter activity was not repressed by ATF3 in p53-deficient Saos-2 cells, p53 re-expression increased MMP-2 promoter activity and restored the sensitivity to ATF3. The activity of a GAL4-driven reporter in HT1080 cells co-expressing the full-length p53 sequence fused to the GAL4 DNA binding domain was diminished by ATF3. p53-ATF3 protein-protein interactions were demonstrated both in vivo and in vitro. Cell cycle analysis, performed as an independent assay of p53 function, revealed that γ-irradiation-induced slowed G2/M cell cycle progression (attributable to p53) was countered by ATF3.

Transient transfections were performed using the LipofectAMINE 2000 reagent (Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were harvested and lysed 30 h post-transfection, and luciferase activity was assayed using the Dual-luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega, Madison, WI) as instructed. For each transfection, 1 ng of Renillaluciferase reporter pRL-TK was included to normalize for differences in transfection efficiency. Unless indicated otherwise, transient transfections with the MMP-2-luciferase construct employed the full-length promoter (−1659).

For co-immunoprecipitation experiments, following transfections cell lysates were pre-cleared by incubating with 0.25 μg of normal IgG and 20 μl of protein A-agarose beads. The cleared supernatants were subsequently incubated with 1 μg of rabbit anti-ATF3 antibody at 4 °C overnight. Immunocomplexes were precipitated with 50 μl of protein A-agarose beads, washed three times in a buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 15 mm EGTA, 100 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Triton X-100), and eluted by boiling in SDS-loading buffer. p53 protein in the immunocomplexes was detected by Western blotting. ATF3 protein was synthesized by the TnT Coupled Transcription/Translation system (Promega) with a pTM1-derived plasmid kindly provided by Dr. T. Hai (4.Wolfgang C.D. Chen B.P.C. Martindale J.L. Holbrook N.J. Hai T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6700-6707Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). To label the protein, [35S]methionine (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) was included in the reaction as instructed by the manufacturer. EMSA was carried out as we described previously (21.Yan C. Wang H. Boyd D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1164-1172Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). These were carried out according to the procedure described by Horikoshi and co-workers (16.Horikoshi M. Usheva A. Chen J. Levine A.J. Weinmann R. Shenk T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 227-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) but with minor modifications. GST and GST-p53 fusion proteins (16.Horikoshi M. Usheva A. Chen J. Levine A.J. Weinmann R. Shenk T.

BL21 cells were lysed by freeze-thawing, and the mixture was then sonicated in TENT buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and a proteinase inhibitor mixture). After centrifugation, the clarified cell lysates were incubated for 1.5 h at 4 °C with glutathione-agarose beads (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO). The beads with bound GST or GST-p53 fusion proteins were then washed twice with buffer I (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm DTT, 5% glycerol, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.1% Nonidet P-40), resuspended in the same buffer, and incubated with35S-labeled ATF3 protein for 3 h at 4 °C. After extensive washing with buffer II (buffer I containing 100 mm NaCl), bound protein was eluted from the beads by boiling in SDS-loading buffer, resolved in a 12% polyacrylamide gel, and detected by fluorography. Cells (∼10–20% confluent) were γ-irradiated at room temperature with 12.6 Gy using a137Cs source (13.1 Gy/min). Cells were collected at varying time points after irradiation, washed 1× with cold PBS, and fixed in cold 70% ethanol overnight. Cells were then rehydrated using PBS, resuspended in PBS solution containing 50 μg/ml propidium iodide (Sigma) and 20 μg/ml RNase A, and incubated at 37 °C for 20 min. Cell cycle analysis was performed on a flow cytometer (EPICS XL-MCL, Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA) using MultiCycle software (Phoenix Flow Systems, San Diego, CA). Because the previous study by Ishiguro et al. (8.Ishiguro T. Nakajima M. Naito M. Muto T. Tsuruo T. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 875-879PubMed Google Scholar) had demonstrated the ability of Ti241 (the murine homologue of ATF3) to augment tumor metastases, and considering the wealth of data implicating type IV collagenases as mediators of tumor spread, we were initially interested in determining if ATF3 regulated expression of these collagenases. Toward this end, we stably transfected HT1080 cells with an expression construct encoding the full-length ATF3 cDNA. Endogenous ATF3 protein and mRNA levels in HT1080 cells bearing the empty vector (V1, V3 clones) were below the detection limit of Western blotting (Fig. 1, A and B). In contrast, in four independent clones (A2, A12, A17, A26) stably transfected with the ATF3 expression construct, the ATF3 transcript and protein were readily detectable with a substantial amount of the protein residing in the nuclear compartment (Fig. 1, A–C). To determine whether the expressed ATF3 regulated type IV collagenase expression, conditioned medium from the vector and the ATF3 clones was harvested and analyzed by gelatin zymography (Fig. 2A). A band that was indistinguishable in size from the 72-kDa type IV collagenase (MMP-2) was evident in conditioned medium from the clones harboring the empty vector (V1, V3). In contrast, the intensity of this band (Fig. 2A) was reduced in all four clones (A2, A12, A17 and A26) shown to be positive for ATF3 expression. The modest differences in MMP-2 amounts among the ATF3-expressing clones might represent clonal variation. The zymography data were corroborated by Western blotting in that reduced amounts of this type IV collagenase were clearly evident in all four clones stably transfected with ATF3 (Fig. 2B). The decreased MMP-2 levels in the conditioned medium was a direct consequence of diminished transcription as evident by Northern blotting and nuclear run-on experiments (Fig. 2, C and D). Densitometric analysis (using Quantity One software, Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) of the Northern blot indicated a 70–85% reduction in the amount of MMP-2 mRNA in the ATF3-expressing clones. To rule out the possibility that reduced MMP-2 transcription achieved with ATF3 expression was a general phenomenon, we transiently co-transfected HT1080 cells with a luciferase reporter regulated by the promoter of a separate collagenase gene (92-kDa type IV collagenase promoter-MMP-9) and varying amounts of the ATF3 expression construct (Fig. 2E). The ATF3 expression construct caused an increase in MMP-9 reporter activity (square symbol) in contrast to the repression evident with the MMP-2-driven luciferase reporter (diamond symbol). These data argue against the possibility that the repressive effect of ATF3 on MMP-2 transcription is a generalized phenomenon. To further address the role of ATF3 in regulating MMP-2 expression, we determined the effect of MG-132 (an agent known to increase endogenous ATF3 expression (23.Zimmerman J. Erdmann D. Lalande I. Brossenbacher R. Noorani M. Furst P. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2913-2920Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), Calbiochem, San Diego, CA) on the expression of this collagenase. Predictably, MG-132 treatment of HT1080 caused a strong induction of ATF3 protein as evident in Western blotting (Fig. 3A). The increase in ATF3 mRNA preceded the decrease in MMP-2 mRNA levels as shown in Northern blotting (Fig. 3B). Thus, although elevated ATF3 transcript could be detected as early as 4 h after MG-132 treatment, MMP-2 levels started to decline only at 8 h (Fig. 3B). Parallel experiments (Fig. 3C) using a MMP-2 promoter-driven luciferase reporter also clearly showed a reduction in MMP-2 promoter activity in MG-132-treated HT1080 cells thus further supporting the notion that ATF3 expression diminishes MMP-2 transcription. Previous mapping of the MMP-2 promoter (14.Bian J. Sun Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6330-6338Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 15.Qin H. Sun Y. Benveniste E.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29130-29137Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar) revealed putative CREB and AP-1 motifs (located at −301 and −1270, respectively), which could potentially bind ATF3 and mediate its repressive effects on expression of this collagenase. Thus, we considered the possibility that the repression of MMP-2 expression was achieved through these binding sites. Toward this end, we first determined whether ATF3 could bind to these motifs. ATF3 was in vitro translated and reacted with an oligonucleotide spanning the CREB or AP-1 motifs in the MMP-2 promoter. As a control, in vitro translated ATF3 was reacted with a consensus CREB motif (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). As expected, the in vitro translated ATF3 bound the consensus CREB motif (Fig. 4A, lane 1) and was clearly supershifted with an anti-ATF3 antibody (Fig. 4A, lane 2). In contrast, this transcription factor was not recognized by oligonucleotides spanning the MMP-2 promoter-derived CREB or AP-1 motifs (Fig. 4A, lanes 4 and 7). Likewise, nuclear extract from the ATF3-expressing HT1080 clones failed to show specific complex formation with these same MMP-2-derived oligonucleotides (data not shown). Presumably the inability of ATF3 to bind to the putative CREB and AP-1 sites reflects the presence of inhibitory flanking sequences in the MMP-2 promoter. Because it was unlikely that ATF3 was repressing MMP-2 expression via its cognate binding sequences, we undertook a systematic search using sequentially deleted MMP-2 promoter fragments to define the position of the regulatory element. Toward this end, HT1080 cells stably expressing the ATF3 expression construct (clone A12) or the empty vector (clone V1) were transfected with a luciferase reporter regulated by 5′ deletions of the MMP-2 promoter (Fig. 4B). Repression of luciferase activity was apparent with the reporter regulated by 1659 base pairs of upstream sequence (wt). However, deletion of 38 base pairs from the 5′-end of the promoter (construct D1) reduced the activity of the reporter in the vector clone and completely ablated the repression evident in the ATF3-expressing clone. ATF3 had no further effect on luciferase reporter activity using shorter MMP-2 promoter fragments progressively deleted from the 5′-end. Note that the inability of ATF3 to further repress the activity of the shorter MMP-2 promoter fragments (−1622 and shorter) cannot be attributed to a low basal activity, because these reporter plasmids yielded at least 30,000 relative light units (RLU) as measured with a Moonlight 2010 luminometer. These data would suggest that repression of MMP-2 transcription by ATF3 is mediated through a promoter sequence residing between −1659 and −1622. Interestingly, although this region is devoid of CREB or AP-1 motifs (5.Periz S. Vial E. van Damm H. Castallazzi M. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 1135-1141Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 14.Bian J. Sun Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6330-6338Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar), it contains a conserved consensus p53 binding site (−1649/−1630) previously shown to up-regulate MMP-2 expression in HT1080 cells (14.Bian J. Sun Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6330-6338Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). We were therefore intrigued by the possibility that ATF3 regulates MMP-2 expression by way of interfering with the trans-activation of MMP-2 promoter by p53. HT1080 cells express wild type p53 (24.Paulson T.G. Almasan A. Brody L.L. Wahl G.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3089-3100Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 25.Agarwal M. Ramana C.V. Hamilton M. Taylor W.R. DePrimo S.E. Bean L.J.H. Agarwal A. Agrawal M.K. Wolfman A. Stark G. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 2527-2536Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), which binds to its recognition motif in the MMP-2 promoter (14.Bian J. Sun Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6330-6338Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar), and our EMSA data (Fig. 5A) were consistent with these previous reports. To explore the possibility that ATF3 down-regulated p53-dependent gene expression, a luciferase reporter driven by 15 tandem repeats of the p53 response element was transfected into HT1080 cells stably expressing the ATF3 expression construct (clones A12, A26) or the empty vector (V1, V3). Transfection efficiencies were normalized by co-transfection with a tk-driven Renilla luciferase construct. Remarkably, the activity of the reporter driven by the tandem p53 repeats (Fig. 5B) was down-regulated over 4-fold in the ATF3-expressing clones (A12, A26) when compared with HT1080 cells bearing the empty vector (V1, V3). In contrast, the activity of a β-actin-driven reporter was unaffected by ATF3 expression (Fig. 5C). If ATF3 represses MMP-2 expression by way of blocking trans-activation of the gene by p53, one would predict that this repressive activity would be lost in p53-deficient cells. Toward this end, Saos-2 cells, which lack p53 protein (26.Sun Y. Dong K. Nakamura K. Colburn N.H. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 944-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), were co-transfected with the MMP-2 promoter-driven luciferase reporter and an expression vector bearing the coding ATF3 sequence (pCG/ATF3). The expression of the MMP-2 promoter in the p53-deficient cells was substantially lower than in the HT1080 cells, which bear the wt p53 (Fig. 6). More importantly, the expression of the exogenous ATF3 plasmid had no effect on MMP-2 promoter activity in the Saos-2 cells (Fig. 6). Note that this absence of ATF3-dependent repression in Saos-2 cells does not reflect the detection limit of the luciferase assays. In contrast, Saos-2 cells made to express p53 (Saos-2/p53) (20.Radinsky R. Fidler I.J. Price J.E. Esumi N. Tsan R. Petty C.M. Bucana C. Bar-Eli M. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 1877-1883PubMed Google Scholar), demonstrated increased MMP-2 promoter activity (compared with Saos-2) and showed ATF3-dependent repression of the MMP-2 promoter. Taken together, these data suggest that ATF3 expression interferes with p53-dependent transcriptional activation of the MMP-2 gene. How then does ATF3 interfere with trans-activation of gene expression by p53? We first considered the possibility that ATF3 either directly, or indirectly, interferes with DNA binding of p53. Indeed, Hai and co-workers (27.Hai T. Wolfgang C.D. Marsee D.K. Allen A.E. Sivaprasad U. Gene Expression. 2001; 7: 321-335Google Scholar) reported that nuclear export is modulated by ATF3. To address this issue, nuclear extracts were generated for ATF3-expressing clones (A12, A26) and clones bearing the empty plasmid (V1, V3) and compared for p53 amounts. ATF3 did not alter the amount of nuclear p53 (Fig. 7A) arguing against the possibility that ATF3 is repressing p53-dependent gene expression by accelerating p53 nuclear export. An alternate possibility is that the DNA binding affinity of p53 is reduced in response to ATF3 expression. To test this possibility, EMSA was performed using nuclear extract from HT1080 clones expressing either the exogenous ATF3 or the empty vector (Fig. 7B) and an oligonucleotide spanning the p53 motif in the MMP-2 promoter. A DNA-protein complex (Fig. 7B, asterisk) competed by an excess of a wt p53 consensus sequence (but not by a mutated p53 consensus) was apparent using nuclear extract from pooled clones V1/V3 bearing the empty plasmid. However, no difference (Fig. 7B) in the amount of this complex was observed between the ATF3-expressing clones (A12, A26) and clones bearing the empty vector (V1, V3). These data suggest that ATF3 does not interfere with either import/export of p53 or the binding of this transcription factor to its recognition motif in the MMP-2 promoter. Because we could find no evidence that ATF3 was repressing p53-dependent gene expression by way of interfering with the DNA binding of the p53 transcription factor, we considered the alternate possibility that the ability of p53 to trans-activate promoters might represent an ATF3 target. To test this contention, cells were co-transfected with an expression construct bearing the full-length p53 protein fused to the GAL4 DNA binding domain (16.Horikoshi M. Usheva A. Chen J. Levine A.J. Weinmann R. Shenk T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 227-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) and a luciferase reporter regulated by tandem GAL4 DNA binding sites. Interestingly, the activity of the GAL4-regulated luciferase reporter was reduced (Fig. 7C) 6-fold in the ATF3-expressing clones (A12, A26) when compared with the vector clone (V1) lacking ATF3. To corroborate these findings, the experiment was repeated using parental HT1080 cells treated with MG-132 to induce endogenous ATF3 expression. Again, trans-activation of the GAL4 synthetic promoter by the p53-GAL4 chimeric protein was reduced (Fig. 7D) in cells induced for ATF3 expression. All together, these data strongly suggest that ATF3 represses the trans-acting activity of p53. Our data imply that ATF3 represses MMP-2 expression by way of blocking the trans-acting activity of p53. This block could possibly involve a direct interaction of the proteins. To test this contention, two independent experiments were undertaken. In the first experiment, we tested whether p53 and ATF3 interact in vivo. HT1080 cells were transfected with a p53 expression construct (pRc-p53), and the success of the transfection was confirmed by Western blotting for p53 (Fig. 8A). The exogenous p53 protein has a slightly slower migration compared with the endogenous protein. We then determined if p53 was complexed with ATF3 in these cells. Cells were lysed, extracts were immunoprecipitated with, or without, an anti-ATF3 antibody, and the immunoprecipitated material was subjected to Western blotting using t"

The truncation mutant CD44HΔ67 is identical to a naturally occurring alternatively spliced “short tail” CD44 isoform (CD44st), which incorporates exon 19 in place of exon 20. CD44st lacks intracellular signaling motifs as well as protein domains necessary for interaction with cytoskeletal components. Transfection of COS-7 cells with each construct yielded equivalent levels of mRNA expression, whereas no CD44 expression was observed in parental, nontransfected COS-7 cells. Western analysis and immunostaining of COS-7 transfectants confirmed CD44 protein expression of the truncation mutant derivatives. COS-7 cells transfected with CD44H or CD44E gained the capacity to bind fluorescein-conjugated HA (fl-HA) and assemble HA-dependent pericellular matrices in the presence of exogenously added HA and proteoglycan. In addition, the CD44H- and CD44E-transfected cells were able to internalize surface-boundfl-HA. COS-7 cells transfected with the vector alone or with either of the mutant CD44 isoforms, CD44HΔ67 or CD44EΔ67, did not exhibit the capacity to assemble pericellular matrices or to bind and internalize the fl-HA. Cotransfection of CD44Δ67 mutants together with CD44H reduced the size of the HA-dependent pericellular matrices. Transfection of bovine articular chondrocytes with CD44Δ67 also inhibited pericellular matrix assembly. Collectively, these results indicate an obligatory requirement for the CD44 receptor cytoplasmic domain for ligand (HA) binding, formation and retention of the pericellular matrix, as well as CD44-mediated endocytosis of HA. In addition, the results suggest a potential regulatory role for the differentially expressed alternatively spliced short tail CD44 isoform. CD44-negative COS-7 cells were transfected with expression constructs for CD44H (the predominant CD44 isoform), CD44E (epithelial isoform), or truncation mutant derivatives lacking the carboxyl-terminal 67 amino acids of the cytoplasmic domain, CD44HΔ67 and CD44EΔ67.

Chondrocytes function to maintain extracellular matrix composition through the synchronous coordinated synthesis and degradation of matrix components. Cell-matrix interactions play a central role in this process via the participation of matrix receptors (1Knudson C.B. Laurent T.C. The Chemistry, Biology and Medical Applications of Hyaluronan and its Derivatives. Portland Press, London1998: 161-168Google Scholar). One receptor in particular, CD44, serves an important role as the primary receptor for the extracellular matrix macromolecule hyaluronan (HA)1 on articular chondrocytes (2Knudson C.B. J.

Studies from our laboratory have demonstrated that the majority of the proteoglycan-rich pericellular matrix can be displaced by reagents that compete with CD44-HA binding such as anti-CD44 antibodies, nonsulfated chondroitin, and HA hexasaccharides (HA6) (2Knudson C.B. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 825-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 3Knudson W. Aguiar D.J. Hua Q. Knudson C.B. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 228: 216-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Thus, CD44 serves as the critical link to the retention of HA-proteoglycan aggregates to the chondrocyte cell surface. We have also shown that CD44 mediates the binding and endocytosis of HA in articular chondrocytes (8Hua Q. Knudson C.B. Knudson W. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 106: 365-375Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The internalized HA is degraded to small fragments within chloroquine-sensitive intracellular organelles (i.e.lysosomes). Additionally, the catabolic cytokine interleukin-1α stimulates the expression of chondrocyte CD44 and enhances intracellular accumulation of HA (4Chow G. Knudson C.B. Homandberg G. Knudson W. J.

Glycoforum.www.glycoforum.gr.jp/science/hyaluronan/HA10/HA10E.htmlDate: 1999Google Scholar). The gene for CD44 consists of 20 exons, 12 of which are expressed by the most common isoform, CD44H (“hematopoetic” isoform). These 12 exons are translated into a protein with three principal domains, an extracellular domain (exons 1–5 and 16–17), a transmembrane domain (exon 18), and a 70-amino acid intracellular tail domain (3 amino acids from exon 18 and 67 amino acids encoded by exon 20) (10Knudson W. Knudson C.B. Glycoforum.www.glycoforum.gr.jp/science/hyaluronan/HA10/HA10E.htmlDate: 1999Google Scholar, 11Screaton G.R. Bell M.V. Jackson D.G. Cornelis F.B. Gerth U. Bell J.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21893-21899Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). However, in recent studies we have also found that human articular chondrocytes as well as some human chondrosarcoma cells express varying levels (15–33%) of another alternatively spliced “short tail” isoform of CD44, CD44st (13Jiang H. Knudson C.B. Knudson W. Arthritis Rheum. 2001; 44: 2599-2610Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The CD44st isoform utilizes exon 19 as the terminating exon in place of exon 20. The presence of an early stop codon within exon 19 results in a truncated CD44 protein with the majority of the exon represented as 3′-untranslated message. Translation of CD44st mRNA results in a CD44 protein having a cytoplasmic tail domain containing only 3 amino acids (encoded by exon 18) and, consequently, lacks intracellular signaling motifs (14Kalomiris E.L. Bourguignon L.Y.W. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 319-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 15Pure E. Camp R.L. Peritt D. Panettieri R.A. Lazaar A.L. Nayak S. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 55-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) as well as protein domains necessary for interaction with cytoskeletal components. Currently, the biological function of the CD44st isoform is unknown, leading one to query whether the expression of this unique isoform is of physiological significance. However, we have shown that interleukin-1α induces a sharp, dose-dependent increase in CD44st mRNA in chondrocytes resulting in an increase in the proportion of this isoform relative to CD44H (13Jiang H. Knudson C.B. Knudson W. Arthritis Rheum. 2001; 44: 2599-2610Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). This has led us to hypothesize that CD44st exerts potential modulatory effects on CD44H-mediated functions such as would be observed by a dominant negative isoform.In an effort to gain a better understanding of the specific functions of the CD44st isoform expressed by chondrocytes, CD44-negative COS-7 cells were transfected with expression constructs containing truncation mutant derivatives of human CD44 which, like the naturally occurring CD44st, lack the carboxyl-terminal 67 amino acids of the cytoplasmic domain. The truncation mutants were prepared by point mutation of human CD44H as well as CD44E. CD44E represents the so-called “epithelial” isoform of CD44 containing an extended extracellular protein domain because of translation of three additional alternative spliced, exons 12–14, within the extracellular domain. Articular chondrocytes were also transfected with the CD44 mutant isoform. We present results that demonstrate a mandatory requirement for the CD44 receptor cytoplasmic domain for functions of CD44 relevant to chondrocytes including the formation and retention of chondrocyte-like pericellular matrices (includes the binding of HA coupled to aggregating proteoglycan) as well as CD44-mediated endocytosis of HA.DISCUSSIONThe major findings of this study are that short tail CD44 isoforms (CD44HΔ67 and CD44EΔ67) do not support binding of HA to the plasma membrane, the assembly of pericellular matrices, and consequently do not mediate the internalization of bound HA. In addition, the overexpression of the short tail CD44 isoform together with long tail CD44 results in the inhibition CD44-mediated matrix assembly. In addition to the experimental applications of such results there is physiological significance, as a protein identical to CD44HΔ67 is expressed in chondrocytes resulting from alternative splicing to generate exon 19-containing CD44.Human articular chondrocytes naturally express both exon 19- and exon 20-containing CD44 mRNA transcripts. The ratio of exon 19 to exon 20 mRNA varies from donor to donor but typically falls within the range of 15–33% of the total CD44 message (13Jiang H. Knudson C.B. Knudson W. Arthritis Rheum. 2001; 44: 2599-2610Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). This proportion can also be observed at the level of CD44 protein (13Jiang H. Knudson C.B. Knudson W. Arthritis Rheum. 2001; 44: 2599-2610Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). We are not the first to document the expression of exon 19-containing CD44 mRNA. For example, short tail isoform mRNAs were detected in several lymphoid as well as non-lymphoid cells such as foreskin fibroblasts (18Goldstein L.A. Butcher E.C. Immunogenetics. 1990; 32: 389-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). These investigators also described the expression of CD44E long tail and CD44E tail-less transcripts in a keratinocyte cell line (18Goldstein L.A. Butcher E.C. Immunogenetics. 1990; 32: 389-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). However, the level of short tail expression in these cell types was reported as 0.5–1.0% of the total CD44 mRNA, much lower than what we observed in chondrocytes. Given that a naturally occurring short tail CD44 is expressed by chondrocytes and that the levels of expression vary considerably, we sought to determine the physiological role for the short tail CD44 isoform. Does short tail CD44 exhibit functional properties that are identical to long tail CD44, distinct from the long tail isoform, or does its expression in some way act to modulate functions attributed to full-length CD44?One CD44 function that has received considerable attention is the regulation of HA binding. The common query is whether sites within the cytoplasmic or transmembrane domain are critical to the ability of the extracellular link domain of CD44 to bind HA. The results thus far have been controversial and inconclusive. Transfection of mouse AKR1 cells with a pCD44HΔ66 construct resulted in severely reduced CD44 binding capacity for soluble HA (19Lesley J. He Q. Miyake K. Hamann A. Hyman R. Kincade P.W. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 175: 257-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar), similar to what we observed for the human CD44HΔ67 used in this study. However, in subsequent work, Lesleyet al. (20Lesley J. English N. Charles C. Hyman R. Eur. J. Immunol. 2000; 30: 245-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) demonstrated that the CD44HΔ66 construct could be induced to bind fl-HA by pretreatment of transfected XJ(3)/CD44 cells with the anti-mouse CD44 monoclonal antibody IRAWB14. We tested the effect of the anti-human CD44 monoclonal antibody F10-44-2 (shown to enhance HA binding in transfected Jurkat cells (21Clark R.A. Alon R. Springer T.A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1075-1087Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar)) to induce fl-HA binding to COS-7 cells transfected with pCD44HΔ67. Unlike the previous report, the COS-7 transfectants continued to display little to no HA binding. Pure et al.(15Pure E. Camp R.L. Peritt D. Panettieri R.A. Lazaar A.L. Nayak S. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 55-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) found that constitutively phosphorylated CD44 serines 323 and 325 within the cytoplasmic domain were critical for efficient CD44 binding of HA when the mutated constructs were expressed in T lymphoma cells. However, Uff et al. (22Uff C.R. Neame S.J. Isacke C.M. Eur. J. Immunol. 1995; 25: 1883-1887Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), performing similar mutations of cytoplasmic tail serines and expression in AKR1 cells, found no changes in the capacity of CD44 to bind HA. Similar conflicting results have been reported concerning the ankyrin binding motif within the cytoplasmic tail as well as clusters of basic residues that constitute the ezrin binding motif. Some studies suggested that these sites were critical for efficient HA binding (23Liu D. Liu T. Sy M.S. Cell. Immunol. 1998; 190: 132-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 24Lokeshwar V.B. Fregien N. Bourguignon L.Y.W. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 1099-1109Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar), only to be confronted by results demonstrating the lack of importance of these sites (22Uff C.R. Neame S.J. Isacke C.M. Eur. J. Immunol. 1995; 25: 1883-1887Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 25Perschl A. Lesley J. English N. Trowbridge I. Hyman R. Eur. J.

Liu and Sy (27Liu D. Sy M.-S. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 1987-1994Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 28Liu D. Sy M.S. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 2702-2711PubMed Google Scholar) have demonstrated that sites within the transmembrane domain of CD44 appear critical to efficient HA binding, cysteine 286 in particular. The interaction of cysteine 286 residues may participate in the dimerization of CD44 molecules. However, in recent studies, Lesley et al. (20Lesley J. English N. Charles C. Hyman R. Eur. J. Immunol. 2000; 30: 245-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), using a domain swapping approach, have shown that a CD44 chimera containing the extracellular domain of CD44 linked to the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domain of β5 integrin (and expressed in AKR1 cells), binds fl-HA with the same capacity as wild type CD44. Their conclusion is that the exact sequence or motifs within the transmembrane and/or cytoplasmic domain are not critical for constitutive CD44-mediated HA binding. What is critical may be merely a compatible transmembrane domain together with a minimum length of cytoplasmic domain (i.e. >6 amino acids). An exon 19-containing CD44 isoform expressed by chondrocytes or the comparable tail-less recombinant construct expressed in COS-7 cells would not meet this minimum requirement. One conclusion that can be drawn from these observations is that the role of the short tail CD44 isoform cannot be as a “decoy” receptor because it has little native affinity to bind its ligand and unlikely competes with wild type CD44 for HA.Another suggested function of CD44 is to mediate the endocytosis of HA. One of the highlights of this study was that COS-7 cells transfected with either pCD44H or pCD44E gained the capacity to internalize bound HA. Although the involvement of CD44 has been implicated in several studies (29Orkin R.W. Underhill C.B. Toole B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 5821-5826Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Culty M. Nguyen H.A. Underhill C.B. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 1055-1062Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar, 31Culty M.

Cell Res. 1999; 252: 292-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), to our knowledge the participation of CD44 in HA endocytosis has never been heretofore directly demonstrated by a “gain-of-function” approach. This implies that the monkey kidney epithelial cells (COS-7 cells) possess all of the remaining necessary cellular machinery to facilitate the internalization of HA. As shown in Fig. 6 C, some of the internalized fl-HA colocalized with low pH intracellular vesicles. Given that Tammi et al. (33Tammi R. Rilla K. Pienimaki J.-P. MacCallum D.K. Hogg M. Luukkonen M. Hascall V.C. Tammi M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35111-35122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar) could not detect internalized HA colocalized within true (anti-cathepsin-D-positive) lysosomes of keratinocytes, the vesicles observed in Fig. 6 Cmay represent low pH, late endosomes on the path toward fusion with lysosomes. These results do not imply that CD44 is the only receptor that mediates HA internalization. Other receptors such as HARE (HA receptor for endocytosis (35Zhou B. Weigel J.A. Fauss L. Weigel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37733-37741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar)) and LYVE-1 (lymphatic vessel endothelial HA receptor (36Banerji S. Ni J. Wang S.-X. Clasper S. Su J. Tammi R. Jones M. Jackson D.G. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 789-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (1283) Google Scholar)) have also been identified recently. HARE and LYVE-1 are likely responsible for the clearance of systemic, circulating HA. Although the expression of HARE or LYVE-1 was not directly assayed in this study, neither the control, nontransfected cells nor cells transfected with the empty pCDM8 vector exhibited a capacity for HA binding or uptake. Thus it is likely that the parental COS-7 cells do not express significant levels of any form of HA receptor.Neither of the short tail constructs, pCD44HΔ67 nor pCD44EΔ67, exhibited a capacity for HA binding, pericellular matrix assembly, or HA internalization. Validation for the last point is less clear because HA binding is a prerequisite for internalization. Further work, such as the domain swapping studies of Lesley et al. (20Lesley J. English N. Charles C. Hyman R. Eur. J. Immunol. 2000; 30: 245-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), will be required to determine whether distinct molecular motifs or sequence within the CD44 cytoplasmic tail participate actively in the internalization of HA. It would be expected that some level of association with the underlying actin cytoskeleton must participate in this event. However, our work with chondrocytes as well as recent studies by Tammi et al. (33Tammi R. Rilla K. Pienimaki J.-P. MacCallum D.K. Hogg M. Luukkonen M. Hascall V.C. Tammi M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35111-35122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar) suggest that CD44-mediated internalization of HA by keratinocytes is not associated with clathrin-coated vesicles, not associated with caveolae, and not associated with pinocytosis (3Knudson W. Aguiar D.J. Hua Q. Knudson C.B. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 228: 216-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). In addition, the cytoplasmic tail domain of CD44 does not contain an AP-2 consensus binding sequence common to many receptors internalized via clathrin-coated vesicles (37Kirchhausen T. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 705-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). Thus, although a nonclassical mode of CD44-mediated HA uptake is suggested, the possibility remains that this event is not under direct cellular control (i.e. via the cytoskeletal elements). The signal for HA internalization may be a reduction in steric resistance of the extracellular HA, either by reducing the size of the extracellularly bound HA or removal of proteoglycan bound to HA.In this study, both pCD44H- and pCD44E-transfected COS-7 cells gained the constitutive capacity to bind fluorescein HA and assemble HA-dependent pericellular matrices in the presence of exogenous HA and proteoglycan. Null transfected cells or cells transfected with the empty pcDM8 vector did not exhibit this capacity. With the chondrocytes depicted in Fig. 8, the capacity to assemble pericellular matrices is inherent because these cells express all three components, CD44H (long tail), HA, and aggrecan. These results confirm our earlier work (2Knudson C.B. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 825-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 3Knudson W. Aguiar D.J. Hua Q. Knudson C.B. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 228: 216-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 16Knudson W. Bartnik E. Knudson C.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4003-4007Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) and set the stage for examining the effects of the short tail mutant isoform of CD44. COS-7 cells cotransfected with pCD44HΔ67 and pCD44H (Fig. 7 D) lost their capacity to assemble a pericellular matrix compared with cells transfected with pCD44H alone. This inhibition in matrix size was roughly dependent on the ratio of pCD44HΔ67 to pCD44H (Table I). As the percentage of CD44HΔ67 increased, there was a proportional shift in the cell population to cells with smaller pericellular matrices and eventually, a near complete absence of matrix. However, conclusions from these experiments alone are limited because it is impossible to know that each cell obtained an equivalent dose of both constructs at the designated proportion. However, transfection of chondrocytes with pCD44HΔ67 does not have this limitation. The chondrocytes naturally express sufficient CD44H to direct CD44-mediated functions such as matrix assembly. As with the cotransfected COS-7 cells, pCD44HΔ67-transfected chondrocytes (marked by the expression of GFP) lost their capacity to retain a pericellular matrix to the cell surface. The exact mechanism for this effect is not known. The overexpression of mutant CD44HΔ67 receptors could displace functional, endogenous wild type CD44 from plasma membrane domains necessary for HA binding. Alternatively, mutant pCD44HΔ67 could form aberrant nonfunctional dimers or oligomers with endogenous CD44 or otherwise interfere with the requisite organization of CD44 necessary for HA binding. Regardless of the mechanism, the end result of overexpression of pCD44HΔ67 is an interference with cellular functions mediated via CD44, in essence, actions consistent with those of a dominant negative receptor. Thus, the use of pCD44HΔ67 will help to elucidate the role of CD44 in cells containing multiple HA receptors in addition to CD44. Future studies will also determine whether naturally occurring isoforms such as the exon 19-containing CD44 mRNA translation product serve to regulate endogenous long tail CD44H in the same fashion. Articular cartilage is composed of specialized cells, chondrocytes, embedded in an extensive extracellular matrix. Chondrocytes function to maintain extracellular matrix composition through the synchronous coordinated synthesis and degradation of matrix components. Cell-matrix interactions play a central role in this process via the participation of matrix receptors (1Knudson C.B. Laurent T.C. The Chemistry, Biology and Medical Applications of Hyaluronan and its Derivatives. Portland Press, London1998: 161-168Google Scholar). One receptor in particular, CD44, serves an important role as the primary receptor for the extracellular matrix macromolecule hyaluronan (HA)1 on articular chondrocytes (2Knudson C.B. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 825-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 3Knudson W. Aguiar D.J. Hua Q. Knudson C.B. Exp.

Studies from our laboratory have demonstrated that the majority of the proteoglycan-rich pericellular matrix can be displaced by reagents that compete with CD44-HA binding such as anti-CD44 antibodies, nonsulfated chondroitin, and HA hexasaccharides (HA6) (2Knudson C.B. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 825-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 3Knudson W. Aguiar D.J. Hua Q. Knudson C.B. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 228: 216-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Thus, CD44 serves as the critical link to the retention of HA-proteoglycan aggregates to the chondrocyte cell surface. We have also shown that CD44 mediates the binding and endocytosis of HA in articular chondrocytes (8Hua Q. Knudson C.B. Knudson W. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 106: 365-375Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The internalized HA is degraded to small fragments within chloroquine-sensitive intracellular organelles (i.e.lysosomes). Additionally, the catabolic cytokine interleukin-1α stimulates the expression of chondrocyte CD44 and enhances intracellular accumulation of HA (4Chow G. Knudson C.B. Homandberg G. Knudson W. J.

Arthritis Rheum. 2000; 43: 1315-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). CD44 is a single pass, transmembrane glycoprotein (10Knudson W. Knudson C.B. Glycoforum.www.glycoforum.gr.jp/science/hyaluronan/HA10/HA10E.htmlDate: 1999Google Scholar). The gene for CD44 consists of 20 exons, 12 of which are expressed by the most common isoform, CD44H (“hematopoetic” isoform). These 12 exons are translated into a protein with three principal domains, an extracellular domain (exons 1–5 and 16–17), a transmembrane domain (exon 18), and a 70-amino acid intracellular tail domain (3 amino acids from exon 18 and 67 amino acids encoded by exon 20) (10Knudson W.

Matriptase is a type II integral membrane serine protease, expressed on the surface of a variety of epithelial cells; it may play an important role in tissue remodeling. We have previously reported that the activation of matriptase is regulated by serum. We have now identified the bioactive component from serum. First, the activity was observed to co-purify with lipoproteins by conventional liquid chromatography and immunoaffinity chromatography. The ability of lipoproteins to induce the activation of matriptase was further confirmed with commercial preparations of low density lipoprotein (LDL) and very low density lipoprotein (VLDL). Next, we observed that the bioactive component of LDL is associated with the phospholipid components of LDL. Fractionation of lipid components of LDL by thin layer chromatography (TLC) revealed that the bioactive component of LDL comigrates with S1P. Nanomolar concentrations of commercially obtained S1P were then observed to induce the rapid activation of matriptase on the surfaces of nontransformed human mammary epithelial cells. Other structurally related sphingolipids, including dihydro-S1P, ceramide 1-phosphates, and sphingosine phosphocholine as well as lysophosphatidic acid, can also induce the activation of matriptase, but at significantly higher concentrations than S1P. Furthermore, S1P-dependent matriptase activation is dependent on Ca2+ but not via Gi protein-coupled receptors. Our results demonstrate that bioactive phospholipids can function as nonprotein activators of a cell surface protease, suggesting a possible mechanistic link between S1P and normal and possibly pathologic tissue remodeling.

Whereas growth factors induce cell proliferation and motility and function as chemoattractants, proteases directly promote cell migration by degrading the surrounding extracellular matrix barrier. However, the participation of proteases in physiologic and pathologic tissue remodeling is more complex, since proteolytic cleavage also serves to expose cryptic sites of extracellular matrix molecules, to activate latent growth factors, and to activate other protease cascades (1Stetler-Stevenson W.G.

Matriptase has been demonstrated to activate the extracellular matrix-degrading protease, urokinase-type plasminogen activator, the potent, motility-inducing hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor, and the calcium-regulating protease-activated receptor-2 (7Lee S.L.

Lin C.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36720-36725Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). In addition to its catalytic serine protease domain, matriptase contains a transmembrane domain and two putative regulatory domains: two tandem repeats of a CUB (C1r/s, Uegf, andbone morphogenic protein-1) domain and four tandem repeats of a low density lipoprotein (LDL)1 receptor domain (4Lin C.Y. Anders J. Johnson M. Sang Q.A. Dickson R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18231-18236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Matriptase is synthesized as a single-chain zymogen, which is presented on the surfaces of cells, where it is activated (9Benaud C. Dickson R.B. Lin C.Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 1439-1447Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The cognate inhibitor of matriptase, hepatocyte growth factor activator inhibitor-1 (HAI-1), can then bind to the active form of matriptase, resulting in the inhibition of its the proteolytic activity (10Lin C.Y. Anders J. Johnson M. Dickson R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18237-18242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). The activity of matriptase at the surface of cells is further controlled by shedding of the activated protease (9Benaud C. Dickson R.B. Lin C.Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 1439-1447Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism of regulation of the initial activation step of matriptase is not known. During its activation, the zymogen form of matriptase is cleaved at its canonical activation motif to generate a disulfide-linked, two-chain form of the protease. This activation process results in conformational changes, creating new immunologic epitopes (9Benaud C. Dickson R.B. Lin C.Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 1439-1447Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Using an antibody that specifically recognizes the activated, two-chain form of matriptase, we have recently demonstrated that exposure of human mammary epithelial cells to serum induces this activation step (9Benaud C.

We have now identified the factor present in serum responsible for the activation of matriptase. Our results show that sphingolipid metabolite, S1P, is a potent, specific activator of matriptase in intact epithelial cells. Human serum was from Sigma. Human LDL and VLDL were purchased from Sigma, Intracel (Rockville, MD), and Calbiochem. Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), lysophosphatidylcholine, lysophosphatidylserine, lysophosphatidylethanolamine, lysophosphatidylinositol, phosphatidic acid, phosphatidylcholine, S1P, and sphingosine were from Sigma. C2-ceramide, sphingosine phosphocholine, C2-ceramide 1-phosphate, C8-ceramide 1-phosphate, 1-alkyl-2-acetoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, 1-alkyl-2-hydroxy-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine,d-glucosyl-β1-1′ sphingosine,d-galactosyl-β1-1′ sphingosine,d-lactocyl-β1-1′ sphingosine,N,N-dimethylsphingosine, andN,N,N-trimethylsphinogosine were from Avanti (Alabaster, AL). Dihydro-S1P, ionomycin, and 1,2-bis(o-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid tetraactetoxymethyl ester were from Biomol (Plymouth, PA). Immortalized human mammary epithelial cells, 184 A1N4 (provided by Martha Stampfer, Berkeley, CA) were maintained as previously described (9Benaud C. Dickson R.B. Lin C.Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 1439-1447Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). MDA-MB-435 breast cancer cells were maintained in modified IMEM containing 5% fetal bovine serum in a 37 °C incubator under 5% CO2. 100 ml of human serum was diluted with 300 ml of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Ammonium sulfate powder was added to the diluted serum with continuous mixing to 60% saturation. The protein precipitate was centrifuged at 5000 × g for 20 min. The pellet was dissolved and dialyzed against 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0. The majority of human IgG was first removed by passing serum through a protein A column. The flow-through was then loaded onto a DEAE-Sepharose Fast Flow column (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.), equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. After washing, the column was eluted with a linear gradient of 0–0.5m NaCl in DEAE equilibration buffer. The fractions containing bioactivity were pooled. Some glycoproteins and the majority of human albumin were removed by passing the sample through a concanavalin A-Sepharose column (Pharmacia Biotech) and Cibacron blue 3GA-agarose column (Sigma). The partially purified serum factor was further subjected to gel filtration through a Sephacryl S-300 HR column (Amersham Biosciences), equilibrated with PBS. The column was eluted with PBS. To further purify the serum factor using immunoaffinity chromatography, bioactive fractions from an S-300 HR column were used as immunogen to immunize mice, and a panel of mAbs against the subunits of this 160-kDa complex was generated using hybridoma technology, as described previously (10Lin C.Y. Anders J. Johnson M. Dickson R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18237-18242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Monoclonal antibody L24 was coupled to Sepharose 4B (5 mg/ml gel), based on the manufacturer's instructions. The L24 immunocolumn, equilibrated in PBS, was used to further purify the 160-kDa complex from S-300 column fractions. The bound protein was eluted with 0.1 m glycine buffer, pH 2.4, and immediately neutralized by Tris buffer. For LDL extraction, the LDL sample was first extracted with 1 volume of chloroform/methanol; the resulting aqueous phase and interphase were either left at pH 7.4 or acidified to pH 4.5 and extracted with 1 volume of 1-butanol. The fractions were vacuum-dried and resuspended in ethanol. LDL (5 mg) was extracted with chloroform, methanol, 0.5 m NaOH (3:2:1, v/v/v), and the phases were separated, as previously described (11Edsall L.C. Spiegel S. Anal. Biochem. 1999; 272: 80-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). The lower phase, containing phospholipids and neutral lipids, was re-extracted. The basic aqueous phase, containing S1P and other lysophospholipids, devoid of sphingosine and the majority of phospholipids, was transferred to a siliconized glass tube. The organic phases were reextracted with 1 ml of methanol, 1 m NaCl (1:1, v/v) plus 50 μl of 3 n NaOH, and the aqueous fractions were combined and reextracted by the addition of 50 μl of 2n HCl and 0.5 ml of CHCl3/methanol/concentrated HCl (100:200:1, v/v/v). Phases were separated by the addition of 250 μl of CHCl3 and 250 μl of 1 m NaCl. After centrifugation, an aliquot of the organic phase was separated by TLC, using a solvent system consisting of 1-butanol/acetic acid/water (3:1:1). One-centimeter bands were scraped, and lipids were eluted with chloroform/methanol/HCl (100:100:1) and dried. Lipids were resuspended in PBS, containing 0.4% bovine serum albumin (1 ml), for measurements of matriptase activation as described above. S1P was identified by its co-migration with [32P]S1P, as an internal standard (11Edsall L.C. Spiegel S. Anal. Biochem. 1999; 272: 80-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), which was visualized and quantified with a Molecular Dynamics Storm PhosphorImager (Sunnyvale, CA). Immortalized 184A1N4 human mammary epithelial cells were maintained for 48–72 h in 0.5% fetal bovine serum and then incubated for 1 h with IMEM containing the various purified fractions or tested compounds. Cells were lysed in 1% Triton X-100-PBS buffer, and equal amounts of whole cell lysates were resolved by SDS-PAGE. Activated matriptase and total matriptase were detected by Western blotting, using monoclonal antibodies M69 (activated matriptase) and M32 (total matriptase) (9Benaud C. Dickson R.B. Lin C.Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 1439-1447Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), followed by a goat anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase-linked secondary antibody (Bio-Rad). Cells were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min at room temperature. Activated matriptase was stained using monoclonal antibody M69, followed by a goat anti-mouse fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled secondary antibody (Jackson Immunoresearch, West Grove, PA). For actin staining, cells were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.05% Triton X-100 in PBS, and actin was visualized with Texas Red-conjugated phalloidin (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR). Cells were mounted using Prolong Antifade (Molecular Probes) and observed on an Olympus IX70 confocal microscope, using the 60× (NA1.4) Olympus objective, and images were generated with the Olympus Floview system. The full-length matriptase coding region was subcloned into the pcDNA3.1 expression vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and used to transfect matriptase-negative MDA-MB-435 breast cancer cells. Stable matriptase clones were isolated, after selection in hygromycin-containing media, and matriptase expression was confirmed by Western blotting and immunofluorescence, using the matriptase-specific monoclonal antibody M32. We have previously shown that exposure of 184A1N4 and MCF 10A human mammary epithelial cells to serum induces the activation of matriptase (9Benaud C. Dickson R.B. Lin C.Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 1439-1447Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Briefly, after 2 days of serum starvation of cells in culture, matriptase was detected, mainly in its single chain, latent form. This single chain form was detected by the anti-total (latent plus activated) matriptase mAb M32 but not by the anti-activated matriptase mAb M69 (Fig.1). Activation of matriptase was induced by the addition of fresh medium containing 1% human serum. Activated matriptase was detected, either in its 70-kDa noncomplexed form, which migrates slightly slower in SDS-PAGE, compared with latent matriptase (9Benaud C. Dickson R.B. Lin C.Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 1439-1447Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), or in the 120-kDa complex with its full-length cognate inhibitor, termed HAI-1 (Fig. 1). The ratio of noncomplexed, activated matriptase to complexed, activated matriptase varied from experiment to experiment. To identify the factor(s) in serum responsible for the activation of matriptase, we fractionated human serum by DEAE chromatography and examined chromatography fractions for their ability to induce activation of matriptase in 184A1N4 cells (Fig.2). Although most of the human serum albumin was separated from the serum factors by DEAE chromatography, albumin still represented the major protein in the pooled DEAE fractions (data not shown). Since Cibacron blue dye-agarose and concanavalin A-agarose did not absorb the serum factor(s), we used both columns to remove most of the human serum albumin and some concanavalin A-binding proteins from the serum factor(s). Further purification of the serum factor(s) was carried out using an S-300 gel filtration column. Examination of these fractions indicated that the bioactivity was associated with a protein complex of ∼160 kDa (Fig.3). This complex contained several associated proteins, including two major polypeptides of 27 and 15 kDa, as determined by SDS-PAGE, under nonreducing conditions. Alternative chromatographic techniques, such as zinc chelating and hydroxyapitide chromatographies, resulted in the purification of a similar bioactive complex (data not shown). Further purification by immunoaffinity chromatography, using monoclonal antibodies directed against the 160-kDa complex, confirmed the role of the complex in the activation of matriptase (Fig. 4). The 27-kDa component of the 160-kDa complex was subjected to matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry (Howard Hughes Medical Institute and W. M. Keck Foundation Biotechnology Resource Laboratory, Yale University). Seventeen unique tryptic peptides matched 60% of the matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry pattern for human apolipoprotein A1, one of the protein components of lipoproteins. This result suggested that the factor we purified was a lipoprotein.Figure 3Purification of the matriptase-activating serum factor using Sephacryl S-300. The protein concentrations of the fractions were determined by absorption A 280(A), and the protein profiles of these fractions were determined by SDS-PAGE (B). The ability of each fraction to induce matriptase activation was determined by incubation of 184A1N4 mammary epithelial cells with each fraction for 1 h, and the cell lysates were probed with anti-two-chain matriptase mAb M69 (C).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 4Purification of the matriptase-activating activity using immunoaffinity chromatography. A panel of monoclonal antibodies was generated using the 160-kDa protein complex as immunogens. One of these mAbs, L24, was used to purify the 160-kDa complex, and the subunit profile of the 160-kDa complex was analyzed by SDS-PAGE under nonreduced conditions (A). The matriptase-activating activity of this 160-kDa complex was examined using 184A1N4 cells. Equal amounts of cell lysates from 160-kDa complex-treated cells (B, lane 2) and control cells (B, lane 1) were examined by immunoblot using anti-two-chain matriptase mAb M69. The bioactivity is associated with a 160-kDa (determined using a sizing column) protein complex, containing two major subunits of 27- and 15-kDa (on SDS-PAGE), under nonreduced conditions.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The ability of lipoproteins to induce the activation of matriptase was then confirmed by treating human mammary epithelial cells with commercial, purified lipoprotein preparations (Fig. 5). Both LDL and VLDL induced the activation of matriptase to the same extent as whole serum (Fig.5 A). Furthermore, charcoal-stripped serum, which is depleted of lipids (11Edsall L.C. Spiegel S. Anal. Biochem. 1999; 272: 80-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), failed to induce the activation of matriptase (Fig.5 A). Inactivation of apolipoprotein function, by either boiling (Fig. 5 B) or by protein acetylation (data not shown), did not decrease the ability of LDL to induce the activation of matriptase, suggesting that the bioactive factor is a low molecular weight component of the lipoproteins. Further extraction of LDL and serum with organic solvents (12Siess W. Zangl K.J. Essler M. Bauer M. Brandl R. Corrinth C. Bittman R. Tigyi G. Aepfelbacher M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6931-6936Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar) suggested that a phospholipid was the active component (Fig. 5 C). To examine which lipid in the LDL was responsible for matriptase activation, the lipid components of LDL were separated by extraction. The lipid fractions, containing fatty acids, neutral lipids, and phospholipids, had no matriptase-activating activity. However, the majority of the activity coincided with the lipids soluble in alkaline aqueous solution. This fraction is known to contain mainly lysophospholipids, such as S1P and LPA. To determine which of these lipids are active, this fraction was further separated by TLC, and the lipids were extracted from the silica gel (Fig.6 A). The migration of the matriptase-activating activity coincided exactly with the migration of standard S1P (Fig. 6 B). This result strongly suggested that S1P is the active component of LDL responsible for the activation of matriptase. Therefore, we next tested the ability of S1P to induce the activation of matriptase in our mammary epithelial cell culture system. S1P, at a concentration of 10 ng/ml (26 nm), could mimic serum- and LDL-induced activation of matriptase in 184A1N4 cells (Fig.7 A). Matriptase activation was detectable within 5 min of S1P addition, reaching a maximum within 10 min (Fig. 7 B). Similar activity and potency of S1P was observed when S1P was dissolved in albumin solution or in ethanol.Figure 7S1P induces the activation of matriptase. A, serum-starved 184A1N4 cells were treated for 1 h with the indicated concentrations of S1P. Equal amounts of whole cell lysates were analyzed by Western blot with mAb M69 (activated matriptase), mAb M32 (total matriptase), and M19 (HAI-1).B, serum-starved 184A1N4 cells were treated for the indicated amount of time with 10 ng/ml S1P.

A weaker response for the activation of matriptase was observed in varieties of phosphorylated sphingolipid metabolites (e.g. ceramide 1-phosphates, dihydro-S1P, and sphingosine phosphocholine). C2 ceramide-1-phosphate (237 nm) is more potent than C8 ceramide-1-phosphate (1 μm). Overall, 1-alkyl-2-acetoyl-sn-glyco-3-phosphocholine (platelet activation factor) and 1-alkyl-2-hydroxy-sn-glyco-3-phosphocholine (lyso-platelet activation factor) have similar structures to SPC; however, the ether and amino differences found in these molecules are likely to result in their inactivity. In contrast, use of sphingolipid metabolites without phosphate groups (e.g. sphingosine,d-glucosyl-β1-1′ sphingosine,d-galatosyl-β1-1′ sphingosine (psychosine), andd-lactosyl-β1-1′ sphingosine,N,N-dimethylsphingosine,N,N,N-trimethylsphingosine, and ceramide), at concentrations up to 1 μg/ml, failed to induce the activation of matriptase. These results suggest that phosphate modification of sphingolipids is essential for their ability to activate matriptase. Among other lysophopholipids tested, only LPA exhibited the bioactivity of matriptase activation but required a higher concentration. S1P also induced the activation of matriptase, in a similar manner, in an independently derived human mammary epithelial cell line, MCF-10A (data not shown). These results suggest that the ability of S1P to induce matriptase activation is highly specific to this phospholipid structure.Table IPhospholipids inducing the activation of matriptase1 ng/ml10 ng/ml100 ng/ml500 ng/ml1 μg/ml2 μg/mlLysophosphatidic acidNDND−+++Lysophosphatidic cholineNDNDND−−−Lysophosphatidyl serineNDNDND−−−Lysophosphatidyl inositolNDNDNDND−−Lysophosphatidyl ethanolamineNDNDNDND−−Phosphatidic acidNDNDNDND−−PhosphatidylcholineNDNDNDND−−Sphingosine 1-phosphate−+++++Dihydro-S1P−−−++NDC2-ceramide 1-phosphate−−+++NDC8-ceramide 1-phosphate−−+/−++NDSphingosine phosphocholine−−+++ND1-Alkyl-2-acetoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine−−−−−ND1-Alkyl-2-hydroxy-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine−−−−−NDSphingosineNDNDNDND−NDC2-ceramideNDNDNDND−NDd-Glucosyl-β1–1′ sphingosineNDNDNDND−NDd-Galactosyl-β1–1′ sphingosineNDNDNDND−NDd-Lactocyl-β1–1′ sphingosineNDNDNDND−NDN,N-DimethylsphingosineNDNDNDND−NDN,N,N-TrimethylsphingosineNDNDNDND−NDSerum-starved 184A1N4 cells were stimulated for 1 h with the indicated concentrations of lipids.

Activation of matriptase was evaluated by Western blotting of total cell lysates with M69 Ab. −, no response; +, activation; ND, not determined. Immunofluorescence studies indicated that activated matriptase, following S1P treatment, was located on the surfaces of 184A1N4 epithelial cells (Fig.8). Similar to what has been described in fibroblasts, S1P induced actin cytoskeletal reorganization (stress fiber formation) in 184A1N4 human mammary epithelial cells (Fig. 8). This actin cytoskeletal reorganization may result in more cell-cell contacts, where the activated matriptase was detected. We next wanted to test whether S1P could directly interact with matriptase, leading to its activation. We examined this possibility in stably transfected, matriptase-overexpressing MDA-MB-435 human breast cancer cells, which do not naturally express matriptase (13Oberst M. Anders J. Xie B. Singh B. Ossandon M. Johnson M. Dickson R.B. Lin C.Y. Am. J. Pathol. 2001; 158: 1301-1311Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Despite a high level of expression of latent matriptase protein, the activated form of matriptase was detected neither in cell lysates (Fig.9) nor in the conditioned media of matriptase-overexpressing MDA-MB-435 cells (data not shown). Consistent with this observation, we found no increase in binding of S1P to matriptase-overexpressing MDA-MB-435 cells, compared with matriptase-negative parental MDA-MB-435 cells (data not shown). The lack of binding of S1P to matriptase was also observed in transiently matriptase-expressing MCF-7 breast cancer cells, where endogenous matriptase is also presented and activated (data not shown). These observations suggest that activation of matriptase by S1P appears not to be simply the interaction between matriptase and S1P. Because S1P has been shown to transiently increase intracellular Ca2+ (14Mattie M. Brooker G. Spiegel S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3181-3188Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and because the noncatalytic CUB and LDL receptor domains of matriptase may need Ca2+ for their proper conformations and functions, we further examined the role of Ca2+ in the S1P-dependent matriptase activation. Depletion of free intracellular Ca2+ by pretreating cells with the intracellular calcium chelator 1,2-bis(o-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid tetraactetoxymethyl ester blocked S1P-induced matriptase activation (Fig. 10 A). Similarly, extracellular calcium depletion with EGTA prevented matriptase activation, an inhibition reversible by the addition of calcium in the medium (Fig. 10 B). However, treatment of 184A1N4 cells with the calcium ionophore ionomycin failed to mimic S1P-dependent matriptase activation (Fig. 10 C), indicating that, although Ca2+ is required for matriptase activation, S1P most likely does not induce the activation of matriptase through a mere increase of its free, intracellular concentration. Considering that the activation of matriptase can be induced by nanomolar concentrations of S1P, the G protein-coupled receptors of endothelial differentiation gene (EDG) family may be involved in this process. We therefore tested whether S1P-dependent matriptase activation can be blocked by two anti-G protein drugs. First, we employed pertussis toxin, which ADP-ribosylates the G proteins, Gi/Go, and uncouples these G proteins from EDG receptors. Second, we used suramin, which can also uncouple G proteins from receptors (15Huang R.R. Dehaven R.N. Cheung A.H. Diehl R.E. Dixon R.A. Strader C.D. Mol. Pharmacol. 1990; 37: 304-310PubMed Google Scholar). Preincubation of cells with toxin or with suramin failed to block the activation of matriptase, induced by S1P (Fig. 11). In addition, both pertussis toxin and suramin failed to suppress the LPA-induced matriptase activation (Fig. 11). These results suggest that S1P-dependen"
https://openalex.org/W2061259280,"Some transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE) (or “prion”) strains, notably those derived from bovine spongiform encephalopathy, are highly resistant to total inactivation by heat. When three TSE strains derived from sheep with scrapie were heated, little inactivation took place at low temperatures, but at higher temperatures, considerable inactivation occurred. The temperature at which substantial inactivation first occurred varied according to TSE strain, and it was calculated to be 70 °C for the 22C strain, 84 °C for ME7, and 97 °C for 22A by fitting the data to a model based on competition between a destructive and a protective reaction. However, PrPSc from mice infected with a range of TSE strains retained similar resistance to proteinase K digestion after heating to below or above these temperatures, showing that the properties of PrPSc responsible for proteinase resistance do not correlate with those conferring thermostability on the TSE agent. The simplest explanation of these data is that the causal agent contains a macromolecular component that is structurally independent of the host, that it varies covalently between TSE strains, and that it is protected by other macromolecular components.

It is operationally differentiated from the normal form of the protein PrPC by its relative resistance to protease digestion and its sedimentability after detergent treatment (10.Meyer R.K.

Correlations between amounts of TSE infectivity and amounts of PrPSc and their similar resistance to protease digestion are the main biochemical evidence supporting the role of PrP as a component of TSE agents (13.Diringer H.

By contrast, exposure to SDS resulted in increasing losses of infectivity with time at monophasic rates characteristic of a first order reaction; these rates were significantly different for the two TSE strains studied. Also, whereas the 22A strain was more resistant to heat inactivation, 139A was more resistant to SDS at room temperature (18.Kimberlin R.H. Walker C.A. Millson G.C. Taylor D.M. Robertson P.A.

In a recent experiment, macerates of brains from both mouse Sinc genotypes (4.Dickinson A.G. Meikle V.M. Fraser H. J. Comp. Pathol. 1968; 78: 293-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar) infected with five different TSE strains were investigated. Differences were found in their thermostability with respect to the strain of TSE agent when subjected to autoclaving with saturated steam at 126 °C for 30 min, but they were little affected by the host Sinc genotype (19.Taylor, D. M., Fernie. K., Steele, P. J., and McConnell, I. (1999) in @@[email protected]@Characterisation and Diagnosis of Prion Diseases in Animals and [email protected]@/[email protected]@, Meeting Abstract p. 108, TubingenGoogle Scholar), i.e. their PrP sequence. In a further experiment, three TSE strains were subjected to dry heat at 200 °C, but in this case, there was little difference with respect to TSE strain. 2D. M. Taylor, unpublished data. 2D. M. Taylor, unpublished data. In this study, we examine the effect of heating at different temperatures on three TSE strains and compare the effect on infectivity with that of a biochemical property of PrPSc. The data have practical value in allowing predictions of appropriate wet heat inactivation regimes (i.e. autoclaving). They also allow an examination of the thermodynamic properties of the molecule(s) involved in the structure of these infectious particles. These properties suggest a heteromeric structure involving two types of macromolecules in which one macromolecule, independent of the host, differs in its covalent structure between TSE strains. The following scrapie strains were used: 22A, 22C, and ME7. 22A was serially passed from the SSBP/1 pool of serially passaged sheep scrapie into inbred VM (Sincp7) mice. 22C was serially passed from the same source, and ME7 was serially passed from a case of natural scrapie in a Suffolk sheep, both into C57BL (Sincs7) mice (20.Dickinson A.G. Front. Biol. 1976; 44: 209-241PubMed Google Scholar). The BSE-derived strains 301C and 301V were serially passed from a case of cattle BSE in C57BL or VM mice, respectively (21.Bruce M. Chree A. McConnell I. Foster J. Pearson G. Fraser H. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. Ser. B Biol. Sci. 1994; 343: 405-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). Brain homogenates (10%) in physiological saline were prepared using a Teflon glass homogenizer. Aliquots (0.3 ml) were placed in Teflon tubes and heated in a water bath (≤95 °C) or autoclave (≥100 °C) and heated at the set temperature for 30 min. The autoclave was depressurized after 30 min, and samples were removed as soon as possible after atmospheric pressure was reached. They were then allowed to cool gradually to room temperature and re-homogenized before injection. 10-fold serial dilutions with physiological saline were performed in the titration experiments, and a 10−2 dilution was used in the incubation period assay experiments. These were injected into groups of six mice intracerebrally (20 μl) or intraperitoneally (50 μl). Measurement of infectivity was performed as described before (4.Dickinson A.G. Meikle V.M. Fraser H. J. Comp. Pathol. 1968; 78: 293-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). Titers were calculated by the Kärber method (22.Dougherty R. Harris R. Techniques in Experimental Virology. Academic Press, London1964: 169-223Google Scholar). Brain homogenates (10%) in phosphate-buffered saline were heated at 70, 90, or 100 °C in a hot block for 30 min. After cooling to room temperature, Sarkosyl (0.32%), Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and proteinase K (100 or 400 μg) were added, and the samples were digested at 37 °C for 30 min. The digestions were halted with 1 mm phenylmethylsulphonyl fluoride. Samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE using the NuPage system and 12% gels (Invitrogen). They were immunoblotted using 6H4 antibody (Prionics) and visualized with SuperSignal7 West Dura Extended Duration Substrate (Pierce) in a Kodak 440 Imager Station. The amount of PrPSc was measured by determining the area under the curve generated by the PrPScsignal using the Kodak Digital Science 1D software. The inactivation of TSE agents by heat shows several distinctive properties: 1) After an initial rapid inactivation with time, the residual infectivity attains a plateau (18.Kimberlin R.H. Walker C.A. Millson G.C. Taylor D.M. Robertson P.A. Tomlinson A.H. Dickinson A.G. J. Neurol. Sci. 1983; 59: 355-369Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar); 2) the degree of inactivation reached at the plateau depends only on this temperature 3U. Havekost, S. Hamilton, R. A. Somerville, and R. C. Oberthür, unpublished results. ; 3) a consecutive inactivation at a similar temperature does not seem to increase the already attained degree of inactivation (16.Taylor D.M. Fernie K. McConnell I. Steele P.J. Vet. Microbiol. 1998; 64: 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Intuitively the heat inactivation data suggest biphasic curves with respect to temperature with little inactivation occurring below the inflection point but progressively greater inactivation with temperature above the inflection point. Such biphasic properties are consistent with the inactivation of heteromeric but not monomeric structures, involving at least two macromolecules. A reaction mechanism that fits the observed data 4U. Havekost, S. Hamilton, R. A. Somerville, and R. C. Oberthür, in preparation. is given by Reaction 1, PxA→kuPx#A→Px#+A↓kpPxoA REACTION1 where PxA is the infective agent consisting of x macromolecular species P and at least one other macromolecular species A, all with a well defined three-dimensional conformation and arranged in a specific three-dimensional structure. Thermal treatment leads to an unfolded state P#xA or to a protective state PoxA in two competitive reactions. In the unfolded state, A can dissociate from Px and both macromolecular species may denature separately into a disordered state in two irreversible reactions with differing reaction rates. In this disordered state, both macromolecular species have lost their initial chemical and biological properties. The reaction rate constants ku and kp are characteristic for the overall inactivation reaction, i.e. they are both small in comparison with the reaction rate constants of the consecutive reactions of dissociation and denaturation. The infectivity is then given by the sum of the concentrations of PxA and PoxA, as shown in Eq. 1, cinfect=PxA+PxoAEquation 1 and the time dependence of both concentrations is given by Eq.2. dPxA/dt=−(ku+kp)·PxA anddPxoA/dt=+kp·PxAEquation 2 After solving these equations with the initial infectivity c0 at time t = 0, the infectivity as a function of time shows a rapid decrease with time and attains a plateau due to the increase of the concentration of protected agents [PoxA]. The infectivity as a function of temperature for infinite time t → ∞ is then given by Eq.3, cinfect=c0/{k0u/k0p·exp[−(EAu−EAp)/RT]+1}Equation 3 where cinfect is the concentration of infectivity (after heat treatment at temperature T), c0 is the initial concentration of infectivity (before heat treatment), k0u/k0pis the ratio of the reaction rate constant of the unfolding reaction, and the protective reaction, EAu-EAp, is the difference between the activation energies of the unfolding reaction and the protective reaction; R is the gas constant, and T is the absolute temperature. Eq. 3 shows a constancy of infectivity with time at low temperatures and an inflection toward a hyperbolic decrease when the logarithm of infectivity as a function of temperature is plotted. The intersection between the initial constant straight line and the hyperbola is called the inflection point (in °C), and the slope of the hyperbola at the intersection is called slope (in K−1) in the following. From both values, k0u/k0p and EAu-EAp can be deduced. The incubation time as a function of infectivity can be approached in the range of infectivities greater than the infective dose at which 50% of the injected mice become infected by Eq.4, 5R. C. Oberthür, unpublished results. log10(t/t50)=−A·tanh[B*log10(ID/ID50)]Equation 4 where log10(t/t50) is the logarithm of the ratio between the incubation time at a given infective dose and the incubation time at the infective dose where 50% of the mice become infected, log10(ID/ID50) is the logarithm of the ratio between the applied dose and the dose where 50% of the mice get infected, and A and B are constants that are assumed to be independent of strain and treatment. The strain- and treatment-specific constant in Eq. 4 is t50. Brain homogenates from mice infected with two TSE strains, 22C and 22A, were heated at a range of temperatures at 10−1 dilution and then titrated. There was little loss of infectivity below 60 °C for the 22C samples or below 90 °C for the 22A samples, but at higher temperatures, there was a rapid reduction in infectivity (Fig. 1). Initially the data were fitted empirically using the computer program GraphPad Prism to biphasic straight lines (R2 = 0.98 for 22C and 0.97 for 22A) with inflection points equivalent to 75 °C for 22C and 98 °C for 22A. The slopes of the straight lines before (p = 0.63) or after (p = 0.32) the inflection points were not significantly different. The inflection points were significantly different (p = 0.001). Four samples of brain homogenate at 10−2 dilution from mice infected with 22A strain were also heated at 105, 110, 115, and 120 °C. They gave similar values to those heated at 10−1 dilution but were not included in the calculations. The data were also fitted to Eq. 3 from which inflection points equivalent to 70 °C for 22C and 97 °C for 22A were derived. The inflection points, slopes, ratios of rate constants, and differences of activation energies for 22A and 22C calculated from Eq. 3 are summarized in Table I. These data suggest that the inactivation reaction includes an unfolding step typical for a protein denaturation reaction (23.Oberthür R.C. Hörnlimann B. Riesner D. Kretzschmar H. Prionen und Prionkrankheiten. Walter de Gruyter, Berlin2001: 387-398Google Scholar) with an activation energy of >200 kJ/mole, whereas the protective reaction may have a rather low activation energy.Table IHeat inactivation values of three scrapie strains calculated from Eq. 1TSE strainInflection pointSlopelog10 (k0in/k0pr)EAin-EAprr.m.s.d.ar.m.s.d., root mean square deviation.°CK−1kJ/molLog unitsData from titration assays 22A970.19715100.39 22C700.15523400.30Data from incubation period assaysdays ME7820.258860019a r.m.s.d., root mean square deviation. Open table in a new tab Brain homogenates from ME7- and 22C-infected mice were heated and then assayed for TSE infectivity at 10−2dilution using an incubation period assay (Fig. 3). The data again show biphasic responses to heat, and when fitted to biphasic straight lines, they gave inflection points at 87 °C for ME7 by the intracerebral route or 87 °C by the intraperitoneal route and are not significantly different (p >0.95). The slopes of the straight lines before and after the inflection point are not significantly different (p = 0.78 and 0.33, respectively). The inflection point for 22C is at 79°, significantly different from ME7-intracerebral and ME7-intraperitoneal data (p <0.0001) and close to the empirically estimated value of 75 °C obtained by the titration of heated 22C in the experiment above (Fig. 1). After the inflection point, the 22C-intracerebral slope is significantly different from ME7-intracerebral (p<0.0001) but not significant from ME7-intraperitoneal (p = 0.07). Previously, it has been shown that intracerebral titrations of boiled ME7 have a longer incubation period for the same dose of infectivity (24.Dickinson A.G. Fraser H. Nature. 1969; 222: 892-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) than control samples, an effect not found after intraperitoneal injection. This effect might have compromised the use of incubation period assays in this experiment (Fig. 3) but did not do so. Analysis of the dose response curves (i.e. the relationship between incubation period and dose of infectivity) from the data generated for Fig. 1 suggests that the 22C-intracerebral assays are little affected by heat (data not shown). ME7-intraperitoneal assays are not altered by boiling (24.Dickinson A.G. Fraser H. Nature. 1969; 222: 892-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), and the incubation periods from this experiment fall within the normal range for control intraperitoneal assays of ME7 and are probably not affected. However, the intracerebral assays of ME7 probably were affected at the higher temperatures, as indicated by the greater slope of the second part of the biphasic curve (ME7-intracerebral = −12.55, ME7-intraperitioneal = −10.5, 22C-intracerebral = −7.5) and as indicated from the calculated t50 value from Eq. 4 discussed below. In practice there was little effect of route on the values calculated for the ME7 inflection point. These data can also be interpreted by a combination of Eqs.3 and 4. Eq. 4 is used to calculate the incubation time as a function of the logarithm of the number of ID50. To test Eq. 4, data from Taylor et al. 1996 (25.Taylor D.M. McConnell I. Fernie K. J. Gen. Virol. 1996; 77: 3161-3164Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) in which ME7 was heated to 160 °C dry heat and an unheated control were analyzed. An excellent agreement is obtained between the experimental data and Eq. 4 with the constants A = 0.36 and B = 0.28. The parameter t50 distinguishes between the heat-treated and the unheated sample and has values of t50 = 356 days for the control and t50 = 405 days for the heat-treated sample (Fig. 2). These values (A = 0.36 and B = 0.28) are used for evaluation of the ME7 data in Fig. 3 with t50 as an additional variable. The initial dose is obtained from the upper curve in Fig. 2 and the average incubation time at 25 °C. It is calculated to be log10(IDinitial/ID50) = 4.9. The incubation time t50 at ID50of 380 days for the intracerebral route is slightly higher than the corresponding value for unheated ME7 material as obtained in Fig. 2 but not as high as for the 160 °C-treated material. The calculated inflection point for ME7 combining the intracerebral and the intraperitoneal data is at 82 °C (Fig. 3). There are insufficient data to calculate the inflection point of the 22C data independently of the data in Fig. 1. The quality of the different fits of Eqs. 3 and 4 to the experimental points can be judged from the root mean square deviation of the experimental points with respect to the calculated curves given in Table I. The deviations are within the limits of experimental errors, which are in the range of 0.3–0.5 log units for the titers and in the range of 18 days for the incubation times with a tendency of increasing standard deviations for the incubation time with decreasing infective dose. Brain homogenates from mice clinically affected with two different TSE strains were heated at 70, 90, and 100 °C, values below and above the calculated inflection points for 22C and 22A. After cooling, they were suspended in Sarkosyl and subjected to digestion with proteinase K (400 μg/ml). There was little degradation of PrPSc after heating to 70° (Fig. 4). Indeed the amount of PrPScdetected was greater; possibly solubilization by SDS was assisted by the prior heating. Some PrPSc was degraded in some models at 90 °C, and at 100 °C, most had lower amounts of detectable PrPSc. Similar results (not shown) were obtained from samples from ME7-, 301C-, and 301V-infected brains that were digested with 100 or 400 μg/ml proteinase K. In all cases, including that of 22C, PrPSc survived digestion at a temperature at which the infectivity of 22C was reduced by >99.9% (Fig. 4). The heat inactivation properties of some TSE strains lie near but within the extremes of stability of biological molecules. Of greater importance for understanding the structure of the causal agent may be their diversity of properties, which can be usefully compared with the chemistry of other biological molecules and infectious agents. As Rohwer (15.Rohwer R.G. Science. 1984; 223: 600-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 26.Rohwer R.G. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1991; 172: 195-232PubMed Google Scholar) pointed out, much infectivity can be destroyed by relatively mild treatments that also destroy many viruses, and it is only a small proportion of infectivity that survives, possibly through some protective mechanism. With respect to heating of hydrated TSE strains, 22C is heat-stable only up to 70 °C, a relatively low temperature compared with some other microorganisms (27.Rothschild L.J. Mancinelli R.L. Nature. 2001; 409: 1092-1101Crossref PubMed Scopus (1241) Google Scholar). However, 22A is much more stable (up to 97 °C), and BSE-derived strains are more stable still (19.Taylor, D. M., Fernie.

Taylor et al., in preparation. although detailed heating curves are not available for comparison. The data are consistent with the heat denaturation of a component of the agent, which differs in structure between strains. The data do not fit a model in which the infectious agent is simply destroyed or dissociated by heat. To develop a mathematical model that described the data adequately, it was necessary to propose an infectious particle composed of at least two different macromolecules (heteromeric model): one molecule acting as the carrier of information (the informational molecule) and the other protecting this informational molecule. Heat treatment leads either to a rearrangement of these macromolecules, resulting in a more effective protection of the informational molecule, or to a partial unfolding of the tertiary structure of at least one component, resulting in the dissociation of the informational molecule and the protective molecule where both components are sensitive to irreversible degradation but at different rates. This model is mathematically expressed in Eq. 3. The informational molecule must irreversibly degrade especially rapidly, whereas the protective components degrade more slowly and reconstitute their structure after cooling. This model leads to the testable prediction that more of the protected form will be created by heating at temperatures just above the inflection point. Similarly more of the protected form will be created if samples are heated slowly to their target temperature than if the temperature rise is rapid. Furthermore it may be possible to promote the destruction or sequestration of components of the agent when in the disassociated state. Although assayed in mice, the determination of thermostability properties is not dependent on pathogenic interactions between the recipient mouse and the inoculum and so differs from the phenotypic properties of incubation period, pathology, and PrPScproperties that are normally measured for strain typing. By contrast, thermostability and other inactivation properties are presumably intrinsic to the structural components of the infectious agent. They could be used for strain typing purposes, too. Comparison of TSE agent strain stabilities with macromolecules from mesophilic and thermophilic bacteria shows that protein structure and function can evolve to be stable above 100 °C. They provide a model of how macromolecular structures are stabilized at high temperatures and in what ways differences in thermostability may be accounted for (29.Daniel R.M. Dines M. Petach H.H. Biochem. J. 1996; 317: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Heat denatures hydrated proteins by breaking non-covalent bonds, but their structures can be stabilized by a series of amino acid replacements that increase the energy required for denaturation. This has been demonstrated by the progressive selection at increasing temperatures of an enzyme from a mesophilic bacterium (30.Giver L. Gershenson A. Freskgard P.O. Arnold F.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12809-12813Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar) where changes lead to small incremental stabilization steps in secondary structural elements. There are no specific rules about amino acid substitutions, although there is a trend to the use of amino acid residues that stabilize the secondary and tertiary structure (30.Giver L. Gershenson A. Freskgard P.O. Arnold F.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12809-12813Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar, 31.Cambillau C. Claverie J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32383-32386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Although wet heat tends to hydrolyze peptide bonds at temperatures above 100 °C and individual residues can also be covalently modified, the effects can be inhibited by local structural features (29.Daniel R.M. Dines M. Petach H.H. Biochem. J. 1996; 317: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Enzyme activity can survive temperatures up to 130 °C for 10 min (29.Daniel R.M. Dines M. Petach H.H. Biochem. J. 1996; 317: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). High thermostability tends to correlate with stability to other types of denaturation and to degradation. Denaturants such as heat and high pH tend to work cooperativ"

We found a significant increase in cathepsin H expression in high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia and carcinoma of the prostate. Two forms of cathepsin H, the full-length form (CTSH) and a truncated form with a 12-amino acid deletion in its signal peptide region (CTSHΔ10–21), were identified by cDNA sequence analysis. This deletion occurred not at the genomic level but likely at the RNA processing level. Both forms are expressed in prostate tissues as well as LNCaP, PC-3, and DU-145 prostate cancer cell lines. The deletion within the signal peptide region affected the trafficking of cathepsin H. Fluorescence microscopy, subcellular fractionation, and activity data indicated that the truncated form was perinuclear and secreted and had a reduced lysosomal association as compared with the full-length cathepsin H. Furthermore, the truncated cathepsin H was enzymatically active. Therefore, an increase in overall cathepsin H expression, particularly in the truncated form with a high secretion propensity, may affect cell biological behaviors such as those associated with tumor progression."
https://openalex.org/W1984126415,"Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy in the CO stretch bands combined with temperature derivative spectroscopy (TDS) was used to characterize intermediate states obtained by photolysis of two sperm whale mutant myoglobins, YQR (L29(B10)Y, H64(E7)Q, T67(E10)R) and YQRF (with an additional I107(G8)F replacement). Both mutants assume two different bound-state conformations, A0 and A3, which can be distinguished by their different CO bands near 1965 and 1933 cm−1. They most likely originate from different conformations of the Gln-64 side chain. Within each A substate, a number of photoproduct states have been characterized on the basis of the temperature dependence of recombination in TDS experiments. Different locations and orientations of the ligand within the protein can be distinguished by the infrared spectra of the photolyzed CO. Recombination from the primary docking site, B, near the heme dominates below 50 K. Above 60 K, ligand rebinding occurs predominantly from a secondary docking site, C′, in which the CO is trapped in the Xe4 cavity on the distal side, as shown by crystallography of photolyzed YQR and L29W myoglobin CO. Another kinetic state (C′′) has been identified from which rebinding occurs around 130 K. Moreover, a population appearing above the solvent glass transition at ∼180 K (D state) is assigned to rebinding from the Xe1 cavity, as suggested by the photoproduct structure of the L29W sperm whale myoglobin mutant. For both the YQR and YQRF mutants, rebinding from the B sites near the heme differs for the two A substates, supporting the view that the return of the ligand from the C′, C′′, and D states is not governed by the recombination barrier at the heme iron but rather by migration to the active site.

Early on it was recognized that the ligand binding site in the interior of the protein is not accessible by ligands in the average structure, and it became apparent that ligand binding has to rely on structural fluctuations that provide transient channels for the ligands to enter and exit the protein.

Ainsworth S. Nature. 1957; 180: 1416-1417Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), and the ensuing ligand binding reaction can be conveniently studied using time-resolved spectroscopy. After photodissociation at room temperature, the ligand remains momentarily trapped within the protein before diffusing out into the solvent. Intramolecular rebinding to the heme iron, called geminate recombination, is controlled by ligand migration within the protein matrix and thus has been exploited to investigate the internal dynamics in a time range from ps to μs (8.Gibson Q.H.

Nevertheless, the kinetic and spectroscopic experiments, particularly those using temperature-derivative spectroscopy (TDS) after extended illumination (17.Mourant J.R. Braunstein D.P. Chu K.

The first photoproduct structures of MbCO were obtained at 40 K (20.Schlichting I. Berendzen J.G.N. Phillips J. Sweet R.M.

Subsequently, new photoproduct structures of sperm whale Mb mutants became available, showing that CO can migrate away from the primary docking site into internal cavities within the protein (24.Brunori M. Vallone B. Cutruzzolà F. Travaglini-Allocatelli C. Berendzen J. Chu K. Sweet R.M. Schlichting I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

These cavities have long been known because of their ability to bind an atom of xenon (28.Schoenborn B.P. Watson H.C. Kendrew J.C. Nature. 1965; 207: 28-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 29.Tilton R.F. Kuntz I.D. Petsko G.A. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 2849-2857Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). Using nanosecond time-resolved x-ray crystallography at room temperature, Moffat and collaborators (30.S̆rajer V. Ren Z. Teng T.-Y. Schmidt M. Ursby T. Bourgeois D. Pradervand C. Schildkamp W. Wulff M. Moffat K. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 13802-13815Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar) recently confirmed that these cavities play a role as transient docking sites in the physiological ligand binding process, as suggested earlier by Elber and Karplus (31.Elber R. Karplus M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1990; 112: 9161-9175Crossref Scopus (476) Google Scholar). For the sake of clarity, in Fig. 1 we depict a schematic view of the heme and a few of the key amino acid side chains on the distal and proximal side, as well as the approximate CO locations in the different photoproduct states (A–D) that will be referred to throughout the paper. Photoproduct structure determination is a difficult pursuit, and it is successful only if an intermediate can be populated to a significant fraction. By contrast, IR spectroscopy is a sensitive technique that allows one to distinguish different species with fractional populations in the percent range. Moreover, measurements carried out as a function of temperature yield information on the energy barriers governing internal migration and rebinding of the photodissociated ligand; particularly revealing are IR-spectroscopic experiments monitoring the stretch bands of heme-bound or photodissociated CO near 5 μm (32.Alben J.O. Beece D. Bowne S.F. Doster W. Eisenstein L. Frauenfelder H. Good D. McDonald J.D. Marden M.C. Moh P.P. Reinisch L. Reynolds A.H. Shyamsunder E. Yue K.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Measurements of the ligand-bound species yield detailed information about structural properties, in particular heterogeneity, in the vicinity of the active site. Multiple lines observed in the wave number range around 1950 cm−1 have been associated with multiple conformations of the protein, called the “A” substates (see Fig. 1). For example, native sperm whale Mb exhibits three A substates (A0 at ∼1966 cm−1, A1at ∼1945 cm−1, and A3 at ∼1933 cm−1) (17.Mourant J.R. Braunstein D.P. Chu K. Frauenfelder H. Nienhaus G.U. Ormos P.

Comparative studies of many distal pocket mutants have shown that multiple A substates originate from electrostatic interactions between the bound CO and different heme pocket environments (23.Braunstein D.P. Chu K. Egeberg K.D. Frauenfelder H. Mourant J.R. Nienhaus G.U. Ormos P. Sligar S.G. Springer B.A. Young R.D. Biophys.

Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 1433-1446Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar), which alter the electron distribution and bond order of the iron-carbonyl complex and, accordingly, shift the IR stretch frequency (36.Phillips Jr., G.N. Teodoro M.L. Li T. Smith B. Olson J.S. J. Phys. Chem. B. 1999; 103: 8817-8829Crossref Scopus (241) Google Scholar). The IR bands of CO in aqueous solutions are too broad to be detected. Photodissociated CO trapped inside the protein matrix, however, displays multiple IR lines near 2130 cm−1(32.Alben J.O. Beece D. Bowne S.F. Doster W. Eisenstein L. Frauenfelder H. Good D. McDonald J.D. Marden M.C. Moh P.P. Reinisch L. Reynolds A.H. Shyamsunder E. Yue K.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 3744-3748Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) that arise from different locations and/or orientations of the CO within the protein. Although their small absorbances and wave number shifts demand careful experiments, these IR bands are useful tools to follow CO trapped inside the protein. In this work, we address the problem of ligand migration, employing two mutants of sperm whale Mb and exploiting the power of low temperature infrared spectroscopy in combination with a temperature ramp protocol. The general purpose of our work is 2-fold, i.e. to understand the role of the internal cavities and packing defects in controlling ligand migration to the heme iron and to test the power of protein engineering in dictating internal pathways and occupation of the available docking sites (see Fig. 1). The experimental approach of TDS-FTIR spectroscopy enables us to separate different dynamic processes by their different temperature dependences and to determine the enthalpy barriers governing the observed rate processes. Using this technique we investigated two multiple mutants of sperm whale Mb that seemed particularly suitable as model systems in view of their interesting and almost unique properties. The results obtained by FTIR-TDS have been correlated with the crystallographic structure obtained for both mutants in the CO-bound state. The triple Mb mutant referred to as YQR has the substitutions L29(B10)Y, H64(E7)Q, and T67(E10)R; the quadruple mutant YQRF has an additional mutation, I107(G8)F. In these Mbs, originally designed to mimic the distal pocket structure of Ascaris suum hemoglobin (37.DeBaere I. Perutz M.F. Kiger L. Marden M.C. Poyart C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1594-1597Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), the Tyr at 29(B10) assists in trapping the dioxygen at the active site by an additional hydrogen bond. For YQR very peculiar ligand binding properties were observed (38.Brunori M. Cutruzzolà F. Savino C. Travaglini-Allocatelli C. Vallone B. Gibson Q.H. Biophys. J. 1999; 76: 1259-1269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), suggesting that the ligands might easily migrate away from the primary docking site to a secondary site. The x-ray structure of YQR obtained at 30 K (24.Brunori M. Vallone B. Cutruzzolà F. Travaglini-Allocatelli C. Berendzen J. Chu K. Sweet R.M. Schlichting I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 2058-2063Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) showed that, after photodissociation, CO migrates into the Xe4 cavity in the back of the distal heme pocket (see Fig. 1). Instead of Ile at 107(G8), the quadruple mutant YQRF has the bulkier Phe chain protruding into the channel leading to the Xe4 cavity, which should gate access to this docking site. In this study we present a detailed picture of the structural dynamics of both mutants at low temperatures with particular focus on the effect of the mutations in the ligand migration pathways and discuss the level of consistency with room temperature kinetic experiments and low temperature crystallographic data. Mutant sperm whale myoglobins YQR and YQRF were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified as described previously (39.Travaglini-Allocatelli C. Cutruzzolà F. Brancaccio A. Vallone B. Brunori M. FEBS Lett. 1994; 352: 63-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Samples were prepared by dissolving the lyophilized protein at a concentration of ∼15 mm in cryosolvent (75% glycerol, 25% potassium phosphate buffer (v/v), pH 7) and subsequent reduction with excess dithionite under a CO atmosphere. For the spectroscopic experiments, a few microliters of the protein solution were held between two CaF2 windows (diameter 25.4 mm) separated by a 75-μm thick Mylar washer. The windows were sandwiched inside a block of oxygen-free high conductivity copper mounted on the cold-finger of a closed cycle helium refrigerator (model SRDK-205AW, Sumitomo, Tokyo, Japan), which allowed adjustment of the sample temperature in the range between 3 and 320 K. The temperature was measured with a silicon temperature sensor diode and regulated by a digital temperature controller (model 330, Lake Shore Cryotronics, Westerville, OH). Samples were photolyzed with light from a continuous wave, frequency-doubled Nd-YAG laser (model Forte 530–300, Laser Quantum, Manchester, UK), emitting 300 milliwatts of output power at 532 nm. The beam was split and focused with lenses on the sample from both sides. The standard photolysis rate, kL, was determined as ∼20 s−1 at low temperatures. A Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrometer (IFS 66v/S, Bruker, Karlsruhe, Germany) was used to collect transmission spectra in the mid-infrared range between 1800 and 2400 cm−1 at a resolution of 2 cm−1. To assess the kinetic properties of different photoproducts, we use TDS, an experimental protocol designed to investigate thermally activated rate processes that are characterized by distributed enthalpy barriers. The method has been described in detail in previous papers (17.Mourant J.R. Braunstein D.P. Chu K. Frauenfelder H. Nienhaus G.U. Ormos P. Young R.D. Biophys. J. 1993; 65: 1496-1507Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 18.Nienhaus G.U. Mourant J.R. Chu K. Frauenfelder H. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 13413-13430Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 19.Nienhaus G.U. Chu K.C. Jesse K. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 6819-6823Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 40.Berendzen J. Braunstein D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), and thus we give only a short summary here. In a TDS measurement, the sample is initially perturbed from equilibrium. Here we use laser irradiation under different illumination protocols so as to enhance particular photoproduct species (18.Nienhaus G.U. Mourant J.R. Chu K. Frauenfelder H. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 13413-13430Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The temperature is subsequently increased linearly in time at a warming rate α = 5 mK/s, and spectra are collected continuously, yielding one complete spectrum for every kelvin temperature increase. Difference spectra are calculated from spectra at consecutive temperatures and plotted as a function of temperature in a TDS map, which is a (linearly or logarithmically scaled) contour plot of the absorbance changes on a surface spanned by the wave number and temperature axes. In the experiments presented here, absorbance changes arise from two different rate processes, CO rebinding to the heme iron and CO moving to other locations. At the lowest temperatures, thermal energy is too small to overcome most of the enthalpy barriers governing these processes. As the temperature increases with time, successively higher barriers can be surmounted. Therefore, the TDS protocol ensures that the different rate processes in the sample are sorted according to their activation enthalpy, which is, to a good approximation, linearly related to the temperature at which the process is observed (40.Berendzen J. Braunstein D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Infrared difference spectra of the YQR and YQRF mutants MbCO (Fig. 2) show that in the region of the stretch absorption of the heme-bound CO, both mutants display two A substate bands, with slightly different frequencies in YQR and YQRF. In the same figure, the IR region of the photodissociated CO displays a number of bands between 2110 and 2160 cm−1. The two main bands are located at 2142 and 2144 cm−1; the weaker bands at lower wave numbers, however, cannot be resolved unambiguously in the difference spectrum at 3 K. In MbCO, an IR absorption line near 1965 cm−1 is present in mutants with an apolar distal pocket, for example upon replacement of the distal His-64(E7) with a small aliphatic residue (23.Braunstein D.P. Chu K. Egeberg K.D. Frauenfelder H. Mourant J.R. Nienhaus G.U. Ormos P. Sligar S.G. Springer B.A. Young R.D. Biophys.

Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 1433-1446Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). In wt MbCO, the A0 line at 1966 cm−1 appears upon protonation of the distal histidine with a p K of 4.5 (41.Müller J.D. McMahon B.H. Chien E.Y.T. Sligar S.G. Nienhaus G.U. Biophys. J. 1999; 77: 1036-1051Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), which forces the imidazole side chain into an alternate conformation away from the distal heme pocket into the solvent so as to better solvate the charged imidazolium side chain. The other two A substates, A1 (1945 cm−1) and A3 (1933 cm−1), are characterized by a neutral imidazole side chain residing in the heme pocket. Johnson et al. (42.Johnson J.B. Lamb D.C. Frauenfelder H. Müller J.D. McMahon B.H. Nienhaus G.U. Young R.D. Biophys. J. 1996; 71: 1563-1573Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) measured the exchange kinetics between the A1 and A3 states and suggested that they originate from two slightly different conformations of His-64 in the distal pocket. Additional support for this view was provided recently on the basis of a high resolution crystal analysis (43.Vojtechovsky J. Chu K. Berendzen J. Sweet R.M. Schlichting I. Biophys. J. 1999; 77: 2153-2174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). An enhanced A3-like absorption was noticed in several mutants modified at residue 29, for example L29A/L29V/L29I/L29F (35.Li T. Quillin M.L.G.N. Phillips J. Olson J.S. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 1433-1446Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). Presumably, interactions between Leu-29 and His-64 are responsible for the occurrence of A1 and A3 in native MbCO. Although the two mutants studied here have residues Leu-29 and His-64 replaced by Tyr and Gln, respectively, we observe an A state spectrum with bands similar to A0 and A3 of the native protein. Based on data obtained on the H64Q mutant of sperm whale MbCO (35.Li T. Quillin M.L.G.N. Phillips J. Olson J.S. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 1433-1446Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar), an A1-like line may have been expected, because the conformation of the glutamine side chain places its Nε-bound hydrogen in a position similar to that of the imidazole Nε of His-64. The double mutant L29F/H64Q has a broad, further red-shifted IR absorption at 1938 cm−1(44.Zhao X. Vyas K. Nguyen B.D. Rajarathnam K. Mar G.N.L. Li T. Phillips G.N. Eich R.F. Olson J.S. Ling J. Bocian D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20763-20774Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), whereas the L29F single mutant has a fairly narrow absorption at 1932 cm−1 (35.Li T. Quillin M.L.G.N. Phillips J. Olson J.S. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 1433-1446Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). This red shift is explained by a positive partial charge near the ligand oxygen originating from the edge of the aromatic residue. In our mutants, the replacement of Leu-29 by Tyr leads to an entirely new A3-type IR band with a dominant line at 1933 (YQR) and 1929 cm−1 (YQRF). The bulky Phe side chain at 107 appears to cause a slightly different stereochemistry of the Y and Q side chains in the distal pocket, as indicated by the additional 4 cm−1 shift to the red. The full width at half maximum of 8 and 9 cm−1 of A3 in YQR and YQRF, respectively, is comparable with that of the A0 and A1 substates in wt MbCO (17.Mourant J.R. Braunstein D.P. Chu K. Frauenfelder H. Nienhaus G.U. Ormos P. Young R.D. Biophys. J. 1993; 65: 1496-1507Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). In both mutants the minority species A0 displays a very broad absorption in the range between 1950 and 1980 cm−1. The high frequency implies that polar interactions between Tyr-29 and/or Gln-64 and the bound ligand are weakened or cancel each other. Possible explanations are that the Gln-64 side chain assumes an isomeric conformation in which either the nonbonded electrons of Oε are closer to the ligand or the glutamine side chain moves away from the ligand location. The width of the A0band suggests that this alternate conformation is structurally not well defined. In these experiments, the sample was illuminated for 1 s at 3 K after which the TDS experiment was started in the dark. The resulting TDS maps in the spectral regions of the bound and photodissociated CO in Fig. 3 show the absorbance change between two successive spectra, taken 200 s and 1 K apart, as a function of temperature in a contour plot. The features in the A state map (Fig. 3, A and C, top) show rebinding in the minority species, A0, taking place predominantly in the region below 40 K for both mutants. In contrast, rebinding from A3 is very different in the two mutants. In YQR, rebinding extends over the entire temperature range up to ∼110 K. The integrated absorbances of the A0 and A3 states as a function of temperature (Fig. 3B) clearly show a double-humped structure with maximum rebinding around 40 and 60 K. In the figure, we also display calculated TDS data obtained from fitting multi-gaussian barrier distributions to the TDS data, using pre-exponentials from low temperature kinetic experiments. 2A. Arcovito, M. Brunori, P. Deng, F. Draghi, A. E. Miele, O. Minkow, K. Nienhaus, and G. U. Nienhaus, manuscript in preparation. The peak enthalpies H, variances, ς, and fractional weights, f, have been compiled in Table I. In YQRF recombination from A3 is maximal at 10 K and gradually decays from there, extending up to ∼100 K. There is a substantial population rebinding below ∼50 K that can only be fitted with two barrier distributions. Moreover, the rebinding processes above 60 K, which were so apparent in YQR, appear only as shoulders in both A substates in Fig. 3D, which presents both measured and fitted integrated absorbances of the two A states as a function of temperature. Fit parameters for YQRF are also included in Table I. The observed heterogeneity in the ligand rebinding properties of A3 is also apparent in Fig. 3C, in which its TDS peak shifts to higher wave numbers with increasing temperature.Table IParameters of fits to the TDS signals integrated over the A0 and A3 substates (Fig. 3) using m"

HypoE mice provide the opportunity for conditional gene repair by crossing with inducible or lineage/cell type-specific Cre transgenic mice, generating new models to dissect the roles of apoE in atherosclerosis regression, immunoregulation, and neurodegeneration.

In addition, apoE has been suggested to participate in the regulation of inflammatory immune responses that protect against bacterial infection (29.Mahley R.W. Rall Jr., S.C. Annu. Rev. Genomics Hum.

Atkinson J.B. Fazio S. Science. 1995; 267: 1034-1037Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar, 21.Boisvert W.A. Spangenberg J. Curtiss L.K. J. Clin.

Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 1529-1538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In transgenic Apoe−/− mice expressing WT apoE in the adrenal gland, 3% but not 1% of normal plasma apoE levels substantially reduced plasma cholesterol levels (32.Thorngate F.E. Rudel L.L. Walzem R.L. Williams D.L. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2000; 20: 1939-1945Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). However, in the bone marrow transplantation model, low levels of apoE failed to restore a normal plasma lipoprotein profile. Unlike WT mice, which transport ∼75–80% of their plasma cholesterol in high density lipoproteins (HDL), Apoe−/− mice transplanted with WT bone marrow and expressing 2–5% of plasma apoE transport ∼30%-40% of their plasma cholesterol in HDL (31.Hasty A.H. Linton M.F. Swift L.L. Fazio S. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 1529-1538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Recently, we generated an allelic variant of murine apoE, Arg-61, by gene targeting (33.Raffaı̈ R.L. Dong L.-M. Farese Jr., R.V. Weisgraber K.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 11587-11591Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). The targeting vector included a floxed neomycin (neo) cassette in the third intron to follow the mutation. Removal of the neo cassette by Cre-mediated recombination resulted in normal apoE expression levels. However, its retention resulted in hypomorphic apoE (hypoE) mice. HypoE mice express reduced levels of apoE mRNA (∼5% of normal) in all tissues examined, giving rise to ∼2–5% of normal apoE levels in plasma. Other examples of hypomorphic genes created in mice by inserting a neo cassette into an intron have been described (34.Carmeliet P. Ferreira V. Breier G. Pollefeyt S. Kieckens L. Gertsenstein M.

The hypercholesterolemia can be reversed in Mx1-Cre transgenic hypoE mice by removing the neo cassette following induction of Cre recombinase with polyinosinic-polycytidylic ribonucleic acid (pIpC). This induction results in restoration of normal levels of plasma apoE.Thus, hypoE mice are a new model of reduced apoE expression that will provide additional insight into the physiological roles of apoE. Moreover, hypoE mice represent a unique opportunity to study the role of tissue-specific expression of apoE by using Cre-loxPtechnology.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESGeneration of a Hypomorphic Allele of ApoeA sequence replacement gene-targeting strategy was previously used to substitute arginine for the mouse equivalent of human Thr-61 as described (Fig. 1A) (33.Raffaı̈ R.L. Dong L.-M. Farese Jr., R.V. Weisgraber K.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 11587-11591Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Chimeric mice harboring a mutant Apoeallele, Apoeneo+, in which intron 3 contained a neo cassette flanked by loxP sites, were crossed with C57BL/6 female mice to generate Apoeneo+/WTmice. These heterozygous mice were intercrossed to generate Apoeneo+/neo+ mice. The mice were weaned at 21 days of age and housed in a barrier facility with a 12-h light/12-h dark cycle. Unless otherwise noted, they were fed a chow diet containing 4.5% fat (Ralston Purina, St. Louis, MO).Breeding Apoeneo+/neo+ Mice Expressing a Cre TransgeneApoeneo+/neo+ mice were crossed with inducible Mx1-Cre transgenic mice (39.Rohlmann A. Gotthardt M. Hammer R.E. Herz J. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 689-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). Cre expression was induced in Mx1-Cre transgenic mice with a 250-μg intraperitoneal injection of pIpC (Sigma) (39.Rohlmann A. Gotthardt M. Hammer R.E. Herz J. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 689-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar, 40.Kühn R. Schwenk F. Aguet M. Rajewsky K. Science. 1995; 269: 1427-1429Crossref PubMed Scopus (1523) Google Scholar).Northern Blot Analysis of Total RNAAfter extraction from several tissues and organs with Triazol reagent (Invitrogen), total RNA (∼20 μg) was electrophoresed in a 1% agarose gel containing 20% formaldehyde, transferred to Hybond membrane (Amersham Biosciences), and hybridized to a mouse apoE cDNA probe labeled with [32P]dCTP in Quickhyb solution (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) at 65 °C overnight. The blot was washed in 0.3× standard sodium citrate (150 mm NaCl, 15 mm sodium citrate) and 0.1% SDS at 55 °C for 1 h and exposed to x-ray film overnight. A second blot of identical samples run on the same gel was hybridized with a mouse β-actin probe. Signals were quantified with a phosphor imager and quantification software (Bio-Rad QUANTITY ONE).Lipid and Lipoprotein DeterminationLipids and lipoproteins were measured in 8–15-week-old male mice that had been fasted for 4 h, anesthetized, and bled by retro-orbital puncture. Lipoproteins were fractionated by fast performance liquid chromatography (FPLC) on a Superose 6 column (Amersham Biosciences), and plasma was examined by agarose gel electrophoresis (Universal Gel/8, Helena Laboratories, Beaumont, TX). Cholesterol and triglyceride levels in plasma and FPLC fractions were determined with colorimetric assays (Spectrum (Abbott) and Triglycerides (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), respectively). Statistical analysis was performed with the nonparametric Mann-Whitney test.ApoE and ApoB QuantitationFasted mouse plasma was subjected to SDS-PAGE with 10–20% or 4–15% gels and transferred to nitrocellulose. Western blotting was performed with rabbit antisera against mouse apoE (33.Raffaı̈ R.L. Dong L.-M. Farese Jr., R.V. Weisgraber K.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 11587-11591Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) and apoB. Polyclonal antisera against mouse apoB100 and apoB48 were raised using mouse LDL (d = 1.006–1.063 g/ml) isolated from Ldlr−/− mouse plasma by sequential density ultracentrifugation. New Zealand White rabbits were immunized with 100 μg of purified mouse LDL emulsified in complete Freund's adjuvant. Rabbits were boosted twice with antigen emulsified in incomplete Freund's adjuvant.Western blots were incubated with primary antibodies at a dilution of 1:5000, and bound primary antibody was detected by a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody (Invitrogen). Signals were generated by incubating membranes with chemiluminescent reagent (Amersham Biosciences) and exposing them to x-ray film (Eastman Kodak Co.). Signals were quantified with a phosphor imager and quantification software (Bio-Rad QUANTITY ONE).Diet-induced HypercholesterolemiaTo induce hypercholesterolemia, mice were fed a high fat Western diet (21% fat, 0.12% cholesterol) (Harlan Teklad, Madison, WI) or the Paigen diet (16% fat, 1.25% cholesterol, 0.5% cholic acid) (ICN, Costa Mesa, CA) for 3 weeks.RESULTSGeneration of a Hypomorphic Apoe AlleleThe hypoE mice expressing reduced levels of apoE were generated by homologous recombination in embryonic stem cells. A neo cassette flanked by loxP sites was inserted into Apoeintron 3 to help follow the replacement of the human equivalent of Thr-61 by an arginine (Fig. 1A) (33.Raffaı̈ R.L. Dong L.-M. Farese Jr., R.V. Weisgraber K.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 11587-11591Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Correctly targeted embryonic stem cell clones were injected into blastocysts, and chimeric mice were crossed with C57BL/6 mice to generate mice that were heterozygous for the neo cassette (ApoeWT/neo+ ). Heterozygous mice were intercrossed to produce homozygous hypoE mice (Apoeneo+/neo+).Characterization of HypoE MiceThe apoE mRNA levels in the liver, brain, and spleen in hypoE mice were ∼5% of those in WT mice, suggesting a common mechanism for the reduced expression of the targeted allele (Fig. 1B). Other organs and tissues that normally express low levels of apoE gave barely detectable signals. The plasma apoE levels in male hypoE mice were ∼2–5% of those in WT mice (Fig. 1C). Female mice expressed similar levels, and male hypoE mice were used to characterize the lipoprotein phenotype. In chow-fed mice, the total plasma cholesterol and triglyceride levels were slightly higher in hypoE mice than in WT mice (98 ± 14versus 65 ± 5 mg/dl, n = 7, p = 0.003; 49 ± 14 versus 26 ± 8 mg/dl, n = 7, p = 0.007, respectively). However, the lipoprotein cholesterol profiles were similar in hypoE, WT, and Arg-61 Cre-deleted mice (Fig. 2). HypoE mice had slightly more cholesterol in the VLDL, intermediate density lipoproteins, and LDL lipoprotein fractions than the WT mice. Most of the plasma cholesterol in the hypoE mice was associated with HDL, as in WT mice (65–70% versus 75–80% in WT mice) (Table I). This finding is in contrast to Apoe−/− mice engineered to express levels of apoE ∼2–5% of WT (31.Hasty A.H. Linton M.F. Swift L.L. Fazio S. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 1529-1538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In these mice, a significant portion of plasma cholesterol is associated with VLDL and LDL lipoproteins, and only ∼30–40% of plasma cholesterol is associated with HDL (31.Hasty A.H. Linton M.F. Swift L.L. Fazio S. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 1529-1538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Agarose gel electrophoresis confirmed the nearly normal lipoprotein profile in hypoE mice indicated by FPLC (Fig. 2, inset).Figure 2Plasma lipoprotein profiles of WT, hypoE, and Arg-61 Cre-deleted mice.

Heterozygous Apoeneo+/− mice did not have significantly higher plasma cholesterol and triglyceride levels than hypoE mice (114 ± 32 versus 98 ± 14 mg/dl, n = 7, p = 0.164, and 58 ± 16versus 49 ± 14 mg/dl, n = 7, p = 0.47). However, Apoeneo+/−mice carried more plasma cholesterol as remnant lipoproteins than hypoE mice (Table I). Taken together, these results suggest that hypoE mice express close to the lower limit of apoE required to maintain a nearly normal lipoprotein profile.Diet-induced Hypercholesterolemia in HypoE MiceNext, the susceptibility of hypoE mice to diet-induced hypercholesterolemia was determined. On a high fat Western diet (21% fat, 0.12% cholesterol), hypoE mice had higher plasma levels of cholesterol (238 ± 63versus 133 ± 25 mg/dl, n = 6, p = 0.003) and triglyceride (93 ± 23versus 22 ± 13 mg/dl, n = 6, p < 0.001) than WT mice. FPLC analysis revealed an increase of cholesterol, mainly in the HDL and VLDL fractions, in hypoE mice (Fig. 4). In contrast, the Paigen diet (16% fat, 1.25% cholesterol, 0.5% cholic acid) markedly increased the accumulation of all classes of remnant lipoproteins in hypoE mice, and their plasma cholesterol and triglyceride levels were much higher than those of WT mice (1146 ± 141 versus227 ± 31 mg/dl, n = 6, p < 0.001 and 61 ± 33 versus 18 ± 7 mg/dl, n = 6, p = 0.01, respectively). Similar responses to these two diets have been observed in other mouse models of low level apoE expression (20.Linton M.F. Atkinson J.B. Fazio S. Science. 1995; 267: 1034-1037Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar, 21.Boisvert W.A. Spangenberg J. Curtiss L.K. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 1118-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). The hypercholesterolemia in hypoE mice was fully reversed 3 weeks after resumption of a chow diet (Fig. 5). These results demonstrate that hypoE mice are far more susceptible to diet-induced hypercholesterolemia than WT mice and that very different lipoprotein profiles and plasma lipid levels can be obtained using different diet formulations.Figure 4Plasma lipoprotein profiles of mice fed the high fat Western diet.

Levels of apoE mRNA in Cre-deleted mice are identical to WT in the liver, brain, and spleen, and plasma lipid levels and lipoprotein profiles are similar (33.Raffaı̈ R.L. Dong L.-M. Farese Jr., R.V. Weisgraber K.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 11587-11591Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). To test the effects of conditional gene repair on plasma lipid metabolism, we crossed hypoE mice with inducible Mx1-Cre transgenic mice. Induction of these mice has been demonstrated to lead to Cre-mediated recombination in the liver and bone marrow (39.Rohlmann A. Gotthardt M. Hammer R.E. Herz J. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 689-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar, 40.Kühn R. Schwenk F. Aguet M. Rajewsky K. Science. 1995; 269: 1427-1429Crossref PubMed Scopus (1523) Google Scholar). Uninduced Mx1-Cre transgenic hypoE mice had plasma apoE levels identical to those of nontransgenic hypoE mice, and they were equally susceptible to diet-induced hypercholesterolemia (not shown). A single intraperitoneal injection of 250 μg of pIpC in Mx1-Cre transgenic hypoE mice increased plasma apoE levels within 2 days, and normal plasma apoE levels were restored within 10 days (Fig. 6). Restoration of plasma apoE levels completely reversed diet-induced hypercholesterolemia, resulting in a plasma cholesterol level of 65 mg/dl and a WT lipoprotein profile in two separate mice (not shown).Figure 6Induction of apoE expression in Mx1-Cre transgenic hypoE mice.

The generation of a nonproductive splice variant from a major portion of primary RNA transcripts has been proposed as an explanation for the hypomorphic effect in other models (35.Jacks T. Shih T.S.

Despite having plasma apoE levels of ∼2–5% of normal, hypoE mice have a lipoprotein cholesterol profile similar to that of WT mice. Significantly, most of the plasma cholesterol (65–70%) is associated with HDL, as in WT mice. Unlike WT mice, however, hypoE mice are highly susceptible to diet-induced hypercholesterolemia, which is rapidly reversed when the mice are fed a normal chow diet. The reversal of remnant accumulation is consistent with our conclusion that 2–5% of normal plasma apoE levels can support effective remnant clearance.HypoE mice differ from previous mouse models with reduced plasma apoE levels. For example, several lines of transgenic Apoe−/− mice expressing WT mouse apoE in the adrenal gland have reduced plasma cholesterol levels with 3% but not with 1% of WT plasma apoE levels (32.Thorngate F.E.

By using digital imaging fluorescence microscopy of a sodium-sensitive dye, we determined that the sodium ionophore monensin induced a dose-specific increase of intracellular sodium. A correspondence between the elevation of intracellular sodium and the level of dopamine-induced inhibition of Na+, K+-ATPase activity was determined. At basal intracellular sodium concentration, stimulation of cellular protein kinase C by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) promoted a significant increase in Na+, K+-ATPase activity; however, this activation was gradually reduced as the concentration of intracellular sodium was increased to become a significant inhibition at concentrations of intracellular sodium higher than 16 mm. Under these conditions, PMA and dopamine share the same signaling pathway to inhibit the Na+, K+-ATPase. The effects of PMA and dopamine on the Na+, K+-ATPase activity and the modulation of these effects by different intracellular sodium concentrations were not modified when extracellular and intracellular calcium were almost eliminated. These results suggest that the level of intracellular sodium modulates whether hormones stimulate, inhibit, or have no effect on the Na+, K+-ATPase activity leading to a tight control of sodium reabsorption.

Katz A.I. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: F743-F755PubMed Google Scholar, 2.Hussain T. Lokhandwala M.F. Hypertension. 1998; 32: 187-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 3.Aperia A.C. Annu. Rev.

In vivo, increases in dietary sodium intake or acute sodium loading lead to natriuresis accompanied by elevated urinary dopamine excretion, which suggested that dopamine produced endogenously by the epithelial proximal tubule cells might contribute to the natriuretic response (2.Hussain T. Lokhandwala M.F. Hypertension. 1998; 32: 187-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 3.Aperia A.C. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2000; 62: 621-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 4.Therien A.G. Blostein R. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: C541-C566Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this model, endogenously produced dopamine would be transported outside the proximal tubule cells where it binds to specific cell membrane receptors. The question arising is how an external effect, the acute sodium load, is translated into activation of the intracellular dopaminergic system. Our hypothesis is that an increased filtered load of sodium may lead to a transient elevation in intracellular sodium concentration that triggers the dopaminergic response. The present study was performed to test the hypothesis that the level of intracellular sodium modulates the tight control of Na+,K+-ATPase activity by different agonists. We present evidence that the intracellular sodium concentration of kidney cells determines the level of inhibition of the Na+,K+-ATPase activity by dopamine. We also demonstrate that direct stimulation of cellular protein kinase C by the phorbol ester PMA leads to either activation or inhibition of Na+,K+-ATPase activity depending on the intracellular sodium concentration. Cell culture supplies were purchased from Invitrogen and HyClone Laboratories (Logan, UT). Molecular biology reagents were from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA), Promega (Madison, WI), Stratagene (La Jolla, CA), and Sigma. Ouabain was purchased fromCalbiochem. PMA, ethoxyresorufin, and dopamine were obtained from Sigma. [86Rb+]RbCl was obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Other reagents were of the highest quality available. Opossum kidney (OK) cells were maintained at 37 °C (10% CO2) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% calf serum and antibiotics (DMEM-10).

Briefly, annealed plasmid and oligonucleotides were subjected to PCR amplification with Pfu polymerase, followed by restriction of the original wild type template with DpnI. After transformation of bacteria, the recovered mutant plasmids were evaluated by restriction analysis and direct sequencing of the altered region. Plasmids containing the wild type and mutated α-subunit cDNAs were transfected into OK cells using liposomes, as described previously (12.Pedemonte C.H. Pressley T.A. Lokhandwala M.F. Cinelli A.R. J.

Selection for cells expressing the highest level of rodent α-subunit was achieved by exposing them to a medium containing 3 μm ouabain. Because the endogenous Na+-pump of OK cells is completely inhibited by this concentration of ouabain, only successful recipients of transfected rodent α-subunit would be able to survive. Resistant colonies were expanded and maintained in DMEM-10 containing 3 μmouabain. Experiments were performed with a mix of at least 20 independent clones for each cell line. The Na+,K+-ATPase of mock-transfected cells (vector alone, vector plus liposomes, or liposomes alone) had the same activity and sensitivity to ouabain as non-transfected host cells. Cells were solubilized with SDS, and aliquots were used for protein determination. Protein concentration was determined by the bicinchoninic acid method (Pierce) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Measurements of Na+,K+-ATPase-mediated transport by Rb+ uptake were performed with attached cells as described previously (12.Pedemonte C.H. Pressley T.A. Lokhandwala M.F. Cinelli A.R. J. Membr. Biol. 1997; 155: 219-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 13.Pedemonte C.H. Pressley T.A. Cinelli A.R. Lokhandwala M.F. Mol.

Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 9884-9892Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Transfected cells grown in DMEM-10 were exposed for 2 h to 2 mm EGTA to facilitate access of ligands to Na+,K+-ATPase. To measure Rb+ transport, cells were transferred to serum-free DMEM containing 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4 (DMEM/HEPES), and either 3 μm or 5 mm ouabain (incubation medium). Cells were incubated with these amounts of ouabain first for 20 min at 37 °C in an air atmosphere and then for 10 min at 25 °C. All treatments and determinations were performed at 25 °C. After treatment, a trace amount of [86Rb+]RbCl was added to the cell medium. After 20 min, cells were washed four times with ice-cold saline and dissolved with SDS, and accumulated radioactivity was determined. Na+,K+-ATPase-mediated Rb+transport was calculated from the difference in tracer uptake between samples incubated in 3 μm and 5 mm ouabain. The ouabain-insensitive Rb+ transport was 25–30% of the total Rb+ transport measured. As PMA was dissolved in Me2SO, the same volume of solvent was added to control samples. For the experiments with ethoxyresorufin, the drug was dissolved in ethanol. The volume of solvent used did not alter the Rb+ transport of control samples. Each experiment was made in triplicate, and results are the mean ± S.D. of at least three independent experiments. Data are expressed as nanomoles of Rb+ transported per mg of protein per min, or as the percentage of Rb+ transported with respect to a control sample. When monensin was used, control sample was the ouabain-sensitive Rb+ transport of cells treated with monensin. Several experiments were performed with cells in a low calcium medium. DMEM has a concentration of calcium of 1.8 mm. To reduce calcium concentration, 4 mm EGTA was added to the medium. Assuming that the total calcium in DMEM is free calcium, 4 mm EGTA would reduce the free calcium concentration to 0.12 μm. Several hours of incubation in this low calcium medium does not affect the attachment of the cells or their morphology as observed by microscopy. To chelate intracellular calcium, 1,2-bis[o-aminophenoxy]ethane-N,N,N′, N′-tetraacetic acid (BAPTA) was used. The membrane-permeant acetoxymethyl form of BAPTA (BAPTA-AM) was added to the cell incubation solution at the concentration of 100 μm and incubated for 1 h at 25 °C, as indicated by the manufacturer (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Optical determinations of intracellular sodium with a sodium-sensitive dye were performed as described previously (12.Pedemonte C.H. Pressley T.A. Lokhandwala M.F. Cinelli A.R. J. Membr. Biol. 1997; 155: 219-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 13.Pedemonte C.H. Pressley T.A. Cinelli A.R. Lokhandwala M.F. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 52: 88-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Fluorescence measurements of [Na+]i were performed using the membrane-permeant tetra(acetoxymethyl) ester of the sodium-binding benzofuran-isophthalate (SBFI-AM, Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) following standard protocols (16.Harootunian A.T.

Cells were loaded for 3 h with the dye at room temperature in DMEM/HEPES medium containing 2–5 μm SBFI-AM and 0.1% w/v Pluronic F-127 (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). After loading, the cells were washed several times with DMEM/HEPES medium and incubated for 30 min in the same medium to allow de-esterification of SBFI-AM. The complete hydrolysis of SBFI-AM to SBFI was judged by changes in the excitation and emission spectra (16.Harootunian A.T. Kao J.P. Eckert B.K. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19458-19467Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Optical measurements were performed in DMEM/HEPES medium at room temperature. Fluorescence measurements of [Ca2+]iwere performed using 1-[6-amino-2-(5-carboxy-2-oxazolyl)-5-benzofuranyloxy]-2-(2-amino-5-methylphenoxy)ethane -N,N,N′, N′-tetraacetic acid (Fura-2). OK cells were loaded with the membrane-permeant tetra(acetoxymethyl) ester of this dye (Fura-2-AM, Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) following similar protocols as with the SBFI-AM dye. Cells were loaded for 1–2 h with the dye at room temperature in DMEM/HEPES medium containing 2 μm Fura-2-AM and 0.1% w/v Pluronic F-127. Cells were then washed several times with DMEM/HEPES and incubated for 30 min in the same medium to allow de-esterification of the dye. Optical signals were acquired in DMEM/HEPES medium at room temperature. The general plan of the optical setup used to monitor Na+ and Ca2+ cytosolic levels in OK cells was based on standard methods using a dual-excitation fluorescence imaging system. Essentially the optical system consists of an inverted fluorescence microscope (Olympus, Melville, NY) with a video camera (Pentamax, Princeton Instruments, Trenton, NJ) attached to its video port. Light from a 75-watt xenon lamp (model 1600, Optic Quip, Highland Mills, NY) is collimated and rendered quasi-monochromatic by one of several interference filters, focused by means of a quartz UV-grade condenser and reflected to the preparation by a dichroic mirror. Excitation wavelengths were selected through a computer-controlled filter changer using excitation filters having wavelengths of 340 and 380 nm (5 nm bandwidth, Omega Optical, Brattleboro, VT). These excitation filters were selected because they are adequate for ratio measurements using either SBFI or Fura-2 indicators. By using these indicators, the fluorescence emission was detected above 420 nm after passing through a dichroic mirror (400 nm, Omega Optical, Brattleboro, VT) and a 420 nm highpass filter (Omega Optical, Brattleboro, VT). To ensure optical stability in the recordings and avoid possible photobleaching effects, the excitation light levels were reduced by neutral density filters until the emitted fluorescence intensity remained constant for 200 s of illumination. No significant levels of auto-fluorescence were observed, and drugs at the concentrations used did not affect or quench fluorescence levels. No detectable change in the SBFI or Fura-2 ratios was observed in the pH range (7.4–7.1) tested in the present study. To improve efficiency, fluorescent light from the cells was collected by high numerical aperture (×20 or 40, Fluo; Nikon), which formed a real image on the CCD sensor of the video camera located in the image plane of the microscope. The camera sensitivity was optimized by controlling exposure times according to background fluorescence levels of the cells and the size of the fluorescence changes to be detected. By using the protocol previously described, fluorescence measurements of Na+ levels in cells loaded with SBFI usually required image exposures of 250–300 ms. For free Ca2+ determinations with Fura-2, exposures in the order of 100–120 ms were needed. The chambers containing loaded cells were alternately excited at 340 and 380 nm by rapidly switching optical filters, and ratiometric determinations usually corresponded to image pairs taken within 800 ms. Sequential image pairs were usually collected every 6 s, although in some experiments faster time resolution was used. Fluorescence measurements of [Na+]i and [Ca2+]i were performed using traditional ratiometric determination protocols (12.Pedemonte C.H. Pressley T.A. Lokhandwala M.F. Cinelli A.R. J. Membr.

Terms of the equation were assessed by in situcalibration at the end of each experiment with solutions of known ionic concentrations. Cytosolic Na+ levels were calculated according to the original equation described previously (18.Grynkiewics G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with a Kd value for SBFI-Na+ of 18 mm. Calibrations of the excitation ratio were performed with cells permeabilized with gramicidin D (10 μm) and superfused with different standard Na+ concentrations. Similarly, intracellular free Ca2+ concentration was measured by determining the ratio of Fura-2 fluorescence at 340 nm (F340) and 380 nm (F380) excitations. There was no detectable photobleaching during measurements as determined by the isosbestic wavelength for both dyes. The fluorescence ratio F340/F380 of Fura-2 was calibrated in situ according to standard protocols using the same equation (18.Grynkiewics G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this case, calibrations were performed in OK cells permeabilized with the Ca2+ ionophore ionomycin. These calibrations were confirmed with cells permeabilized with either digitonin or saponin. Fmax and Fmin were determined in Ringer's solution (1 mm Ca2+) to saturate the Ca2+ indicator and then bathing the cell in low Ca2+ Ringer's solution supplemented with 5 mm EGTA. Standard computer-based image analysis software was used for the analysis of Na+ and Ca2+ images. Video images were acquired at 8 bits resolution and stored in real time in a Pentium IBM-compatible computer system. Final ionic determinations were obtained applying standard ratiometric processing algorithms. In the figures, ionic changes in single cells are illustrated by pseudocolors reflecting ionic concentration ranges as determined according to ratiometric determinations (see above). Temporal plots of Na+ and Ca2+ transients were obtained from averaged values over 6 × 6 pixel kernels. To improve signal-noise ratio of SBFI measurements, [Na+]i determinations at each time results from the averaging of multiple samples acquired at faster time resolutions. Usually, individual points represent the average of 6 ratio determinations taken every 10 s (6 paired-frame/min), although in some experiments faster time resolution was used. Comparisons between groups were performed by Student's t test for unpaired data. The sodium ionophore monensin was used to produce stable incremental elevations of intracellular sodium in OK cells. To determine the intracellular concentration of free sodium, OK cells were loaded with a sodium-sensitive dye, and the level of emitted fluorescence was monitored using a video imaging system, as described previously (12.Pedemonte C.H. Pressley T.A. Lokhandwala M.F. Cinelli A.R. J. Membr. Biol. 1997; 155: 219-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 13.Pedemonte C.H. Pressley T.A. Cinelli A.R. Lokhandwala M.F. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 52: 88-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Fluorescent images of OK cells loaded with SBFI and excited at 380 nm are shown at the left of Fig. 1, A—C. Upon excitation at 340 and 380 nm, the level of intracellular sodium was calculated from the ratio of emitted fluorescence that was calibrated by loading the cells with standard sodium concentrations. Ratiometric images of SBFI-loaded cells, displayed in pseudocolor, were obtained at different times of treatment and concentrations of monensin. Images in the center of Fig. 1, A–C (X1), illustrate the basal sodium concentration (no monensin treatment). Basal levels of intracellular sodium ranged from 5.3 to 13.1 mm with an average of 7.8 ± 3.3 mm (n = 24). Images on the right of Fig. 1, A–C (X2) illustrate the intracellular sodium concentration 5 min after the addition of 6, 9, or 12 μm monensin, respectively, to the cell medium. Fig. 1, D and E, illustrate intracellular sodium levels at various times after addition of different monensin concentrations to the cell medium. In situ calibration of the excitation ratio of SBFI at various intracellular sodium concentrations indicated that monensin produced a steady increase in the intracellular sodium concentration of OK cells up to about 30 min, and then the concentration of sodium was stable for at least another 40 min (Fig. 1E). As expected, higher intracellular concentrations of sodium were determined at higher levels of monensin in the cell medium. Once the steady state of intracellular sodium concentration was reached, a linear relation between the concentration of monensin in the cell medium and the concentration of intracellular sodium was calculated (Fig. 1F). The linear equation from this plot ([Na+]i = (2.25 ± 0.11)[monensin] 103 + (8.92 ± 0.71) mm) was used to calculate the intracellular sodium concentrations that correspond to the concentrations of monensin in the cell medium. Because the new steady state of intracellular sodium produced by monensin is reached at about 30 min, determinations of Rb+transport were always started at this time. Because the activity of the Na+,K+-ATPase is limited by the level of intracellular sodium (3.Aperia A.C. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2000; 62: 621-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar), the elevated intracellular sodium concentration elicited by monensin produced stimulation of the Na+,K+-ATPase activity (Fig. 2A). The basal Na+,K+-ATPase activity was 9.8 ± 0.7 nmol/mg/min, and it was stimulated to 18.5 ± 1.0 by 5 μm monensin (Fig. 2A). To determine the effect of intracellular sodium concentration on the inhibition of Na+,K+-ATPase activity by dopamine, cells were treated with monensin for 30 min before the addition of 1 μm dopamine. Five minutes later, radioactive Rb+ was added to the cell medium to determine the ouabain-sensitive ion transport for 20 min. At basal concentrations of intracellula"

To explore the mechanisms leading to these pathologies we tested the effects of etomoxir, an inhibitor of carnitine palmitoyltransferase I which contains a fatty acid-derived structure, in C2C12 skeletal muscle cells. Etomoxir treatment for 24 h resulted in a down-regulation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα) mRNA expression, achieving an 87% reduction at 80 μm etomoxir. The mRNA levels of most of the PPARα target genes studied were reduced at 100 μm etomoxir. By using several inhibitors of de novo ceramide synthesis and C2-ceramide we showed that they were not involved in the effects of etomoxir. Interestingly, the addition of triacsin C, a potent inhibitor of acyl-CoA synthetase, to etomoxir-treated C2C12 skeletal muscle cells did not prevent the down-regulation in PPARα mRNA levels, suggesting that the active form of the drug, etomoxir-CoA, was not involved. Given that saturated fatty acids may generate reactive oxygen species (ROS), we determined whether the addition of etomoxir resulted in ROS generation. Etomoxir increased ROS production and the activity of the well known redox transcription factor NF-κB. In the presence of the pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate, a potent antioxidant and inhibitor of NF-κB activity, etomoxir did not down-regulate PPARα mRNA in C2C12 skeletal muscle cells. These results indicate that ROS generation and NF-κB activation are responsible for the down-regulation of PPARα and may provide a new mechanism by which intracellular lipid accumulation occurs in skeletal muscle cells.

Gunnarsson R. Bjorkman O. Olsson M. Wahren J. J. Clin. Invest. 1985; 76: 149-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (896) Google Scholar). The mechanisms responsible for the reduced sensitivity of muscle to insulin still remains unclear, but there is a strong correlation between insulin resistance and the presence of increased lipid levels in skeletal muscle (2McGarry J.D. Science. 1992; 258: 766-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar). Data from different studies are consistent with this idea. In humans it has been reported that insulin resistance correlates more tightly with intramyocellular lipid levels than with any other factor, including body mass index or percent body fat (3Jacob S. Machann J. Rett K. Brechtel K. Volk A. Renn W. Maerker E. Matthaei S. Schick F. Claussen C-D Häring H-U. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 113-119Google Scholar, 4Krssak M Petersen K.F. Dresner A. Dipietro L.

Moreover, insulin resistance appears after exposure of rat skeletal muscle to elevated free fatty acids, which is associated with the accumulation of fatty acyl-CoA (6Oakes N.D. Cooney G.J. Camilleri S. Chisholm D.J. Kraegen E.W. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 1768-1774Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and triglycerides (7Storlien L.H. Jenkins A.B. Chisholm D.J. Pascoe W.S. Khouri S. Kraegen E.W.

Similar results have been obtained with cells exposed to increased lipid levels (9Schmitz-Peiffer C. Craig D.L. Dbiden T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24202-24210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). Fatty acid catabolism is mainly regulated by the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα)1 (10Sack M.N. Disch D.L. Rockman H.A. Kelly D.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6438-6443Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). This PPAR subtype is expressed primarily in tissues with a high level of fatty acid catabolism such as liver, kidney, heart, and skeletal muscle (11Braissant O. Foufelle F. Scotto C. Dauça M. Wahli W. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 354-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (1737) Google Scholar,12Desvergne B. Wahli W. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 649-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (2746) Google Scholar). To be transcriptional active, PPARα needs to heterodimerize with the retinoid X receptor. PPARα-retinoid X receptor heterodimers bind to DNA specific sequences called peroxisome proliferator-response elements consisting of an imperfect direct repeat of the consensus binding site for nuclear hormone receptors (AGGTCA) separated by one nucleotide (DR-1). Recently it has been reported that PPARα activation in skeletal muscle increases expression of enzymes involved in fatty acid β oxidation. These changes lead to prevention of diet-induced obesity and insulin resistance (13Ye J-M. Doyle P.J. Iglesias M.A. Watson D.G. Cooney G.J. Kraegen E.W. Diabetes. 2001; 50: 411-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). On the other hand, hypertrophic growth in cardiac myocytes showed reduced PPARα expression. and its activity is altered at the transcriptional level via the extracellular signal-regulated kinase mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway. These hypertrophied myocytes, with reduced PPARα expression, showed a reduced capacity for cellular lipid homeostasis, resulting in intracellular lipid accumulation in response to fatty acids (14Barger P.M. Brandt J.M. Leone T.C. Weinheimer C.J. Kelly D.P. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 1723-1730Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). To gain a better understanding of the mechanism by which exposure of skeletal muscle cells to fatty acids results in lipid accumulation, we have used the myoblast C2C12 cell line, which develops biochemical and morphological properties characteristic of skeletal muscle and has been proven useful for studies of skeletal muscle metabolism (15McMahon D.K. Anderson P.A. Nassar R. Bunting J.B. Saba Z. Oakeley A.E. Malouf N.N. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: C1795-C1802Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Gauthier-Rouviere C. Vandromme M. Tuil D. Lantredou N. Morris M. Soulez M. Kahn A. Fernandez A. Lamb N. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 719-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). To promote fatty acyl-CoA accumulation in these cells, we have taken advantage of the use of etomoxir. Etomoxir is an irreversible inhibitor of CPT-I and. therefore, of fatty acid β-oxidation (17Wolf H.P.O. Horm. Metab. Res. 1992; 26: 62-67Google Scholar). Treatment of C2C12 skeletal muscle cells for 24 h with etomoxir strongly decreased PPARα mRNA levels. Overall, PPARα target genes showed a biphasic response to etomoxir, with small inductions in their expression at low etomoxir concentrations and reductions at higher concentrations. Surprisingly, the effects of etomoxir on PPARα expression were not mediated through CPT-I inhibition, since inhibition of the formation of the active form of the drug, etomoxir-CoA, did not prevent its effects. In contrast, we show that treatment with etomoxir, which contains a saturated fatty acid-derived structure with an oxirane group, resulted in the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) activation. Interestingly, in the presence of the pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC), a potent antioxidant and inhibitor of NF-κB activity, etomoxir did not down-regulate PPARα expression in C2C12 skeletal muscle cells. These results indicate that intracellular ROS generation and increased NF-κB activity leads to a down-regulation of the fatty acid oxidation metabolism mediated by PPARα, which in turns may result in intracellular lipid accumulation in skeletal muscle cells. Etomoxir (2-[6-(4-chlorophenoxy)hexyl]oxirane-2-carboxylic acid) was obtained from Dr. Horst Wolf (Germany). C2-ceramide, fumonisin B1, ISP1, and PDTC were from Sigma. PD98059 and triacsin C were fromBiomol Research Labs Inc. (Plymouth Meeting, PA), and 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein diacetate (DCFH) was purchased from Serva (Heidelberg, Germany). Other chemicals were from Sigma. Mouse C2C12 myoblasts (ATCC) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. When cells reached confluence, the medium was switched to the differentiation medium containing Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and 2% horse serum, which was changed every other day. After 4 additional days, the differentiated C2C12 cells had fused into myotubes, which were then treated in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with either vehicle (0.1% methanol) or etomoxir. After the incubation, RNA was extracted from myotubes as described below. Total RNA was isolated by using the Ultraspec reagent (Biotecx). Relative levels of specific mRNAs were assessed by reverse transcription (RT)-PCR. Complementary DNA was synthesized from RNA samples by mixing 1 μg of total RNA, 125 ng of random hexamers as primers in the presence of 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.3, 75 mm KCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 200 units of Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen), 20 units of RNasin (Invitrogen), and 0.5 mmeach dNTP (Sigma) in a total volume of 20 μl. Samples were incubated at 37 °C for 60 min. A 5 μl aliquot of the reverse transcription reaction was then used for subsequent PCR amplification with specific primers. Each 25-μl PCR reaction contained 5 μl of the reverse transcription reaction, 1.2 mm MgCl2, 200 μm dNTPs, 1.25 μCi of [32P]dATP (3000 Ci/mmol, Amersham Biosciences, Inc.), 1 unit of Taqpolymerase (Ecogen, Barcelona, Spain), 0.5 μg of each primer, and 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5. To avoid unspecific annealing, cDNA and Taq polymerase were separated from primers and dNTPs by using a layer of paraffin (reaction components contact only when paraffin fuses, at 60 °C). The se- quences of the sense and antisense primers used for amplification were: acyl-CoA oxidase (ACO), 5′-ACTATATTTGGCCAATTTTGTG-3′ and 5′-TGTGGCAGTGGTTTCCAAGCC-3′; uncoupling protein 3 (UCP-3), 5′-GGAGCCATGGCAGTGACCTGT-3′ and 5′-TGTGATGTTGGGCCAAGTCCC-3′; M-CPT-I, 5′-TTCACTGTGACCCCAGACGGG-3′ and 5′-AATGGACCAGCCCCATGGAGA; medium chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (MCAD), 5′-TCGAAAGCGGCTCACAAGCAG-3′ and 5′-CACCGCAGCTTTCCGGAATGT-3′; PPARα, 5′-GGCTCGGAGGGCTCTGTCATC-3′ and 5′-ACATGCACTGGCAGCAGTGGA-3′; and adenosylphosphoribosyltransferase (APRT), 5′-AGCTTCCCGGACTTCCCCATC-3′ and 5′-GACCACTTTCTGCCCCGGTTC-3′. PCR was performed in an M. J. Research Thermocycler equipped with a peltier system and temperature probe. After an initial denaturation for 1 min at 94 °C, PCR was performed for 20 (MCAD), 21 (UCP-2), 26 (UCP-3), 27 (PPARα), 28 (APRT), 30 (ACO), or 33 (M-CPT-I) cycles. Each cycle consisted of denaturation at 92 °C for 1 min, primer annealing at 60 °C (except 58 °C for ACO), and primer extension at 72 °C for 1 min and 50 s. A final 5-min extension step at 72 °C was performed. Five microliters of each PCR sample was electrophoresed on a 1-mm-thick 5% polyacrylamide gel. The gels were dried and subjected to autoradiography using Kodak x-ray films to show the amplified DNA products. Amplification of each gene yielded a single band of the expected size (UCP-3, 198 base pairs (bp); ACO, 195 bp; M-CPT-I, 222 bp; MCAD, 216 bp; PPARα, 645 bp; APRT, 329 bp). Preliminary experiments were carried out with various amounts of cDNA to determine non-saturating conditions of PCR amplification for all the genes studied. Thus cDNA amplification was performed in comparative and semiquantitative conditions (18Freeman W.M. Walker S.J. Vrana E.V. Biotechniques. 1999; 26: 112-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (856) Google Scholar). Radioactive bands were quantified by video-densitometric scanning (Vilbert Lourmat Imaging). The results for the expression of specific mRNAs are always presented relative to the expression of the control gene (aprt). Nuclear extracts were isolated according to Andrews and Faller (19Andrews N Faller D.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 192499Crossref PubMed Scopus (2214) Google Scholar). Cells were scraped into 1.5 ml of cold phosphate-buffered saline, pelleted for 10 s, and resuspended in 400 μl of cold buffer A (10 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.9, at 4 °C, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, and 2 μg/ml leupeptin) by flicking the tube. Cells were allowed to swell on ice for 10 min and then vortexed for 10 s. Then samples were centrifuged for 10 s, and the supernatant fraction was discarded. Pellets were resuspended in 50 μl of cold buffer C (20 mmHEPES-KOH, pH 7.9, at 4 °C, 25% glycerol, 420 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, and 2 μg/ml leupeptin) and incubated on ice for 20 min for high salt extraction. Cellular debris was removed by centrifugation for 2 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant fraction (containing DNA binding proteins) was stored at −80 °C. Nuclear extract concentration was determined by using the Bradford method (20Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar). Electrophoretic mobility shift assay was performed using double-stranded oligonucleotides (Promega) for the consensus binding site of the NF-κB nucleotide (5′-AGTTGAGGGGACTTTCCCAGGC-3′). Oligonucleotides were labeled with 1 μl of oligonucleotide (3.5 pmol/μl), 2 μl of 5× kinase buffer, 5 units of T4 polynucleotide kinase, and 3 μl of [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol at 10 mCi/ml) incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. The reaction was stopped by adding 90 μl of TE buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and 1 mm EDTA). To separate the labeled probe from the unbound ATP, the reaction mixture was eluted in a Nick column (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Five micrograms of crude nuclear proteins were incubated for 10 min on ice in binding buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 25 mm KCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 5% glycerol, 5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 100 μg/ml tRNA, and 50 μg/ml poly(dI-dC)) in a final volume of 15 μl. Labeled probe (∼40,000 cpm) was added, and the reaction was incubated for 15 min at room temperature. Where indicated, specific competitor oligonucleotide was added before the labeled probe and incubated for 10 min on ice. p65 antibody was added 15 min before incubation with the labeled probe at 4 °C. Protein-DNA complexes were resolved by electrophoresis at 4 °C on a 5% acrylamide gel and subjected to autoradiography. Nuclear fragmentation was analyzed on a Epics XL (Coulter Corp.) flow cytometer. Briefly, cells were collected with 0.25% trypsin in phosphate-buffered saline and fixed with 70% ethanol for 2 h. Fixed cells were rinsed in phosphate-buffered saline and then resuspended in a solution containing 0.02 mg/ml propidium iodide, 0.2 mg/ml DNase-free RNase, and 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline. Thereafter, cells were incubated at room temperature for 30 min in the dark and analyzed by flow cytometry. After 24 h of treatment with either vehicle (0.1% CH3OH) or 80 μm etomoxir with or without 5 mm PDTC, the cells were scraped into phosphate-buffered saline, and the pellet was resuspended in 1 ml with phosphate-buffered saline and stained for 1 h at 37 °C in the dark with 10 μm DCFH diacetate. Then cells were pelleted and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline, and cell viability was assessed by using propidium iodide (1 μm). After incubation with fluorochrome, cells were kept in the dark at 4 °C, and fluorescence intensity was measured in a Coulter EPICS ELITE cytometer (Coulter Corp., Hialeah, FL). A minimum of 10,000 cells/sample were acquired and analyzed. Results are usually expressed as means ± S.D. of three experiments. Significant differences were established by Student's t test or analysis of variance according to the number of groups compared. When significant variations were found, the Tukey-Kramer multiple comparisons test was performed. All the statistical analyses were performed using the computer program GraphPad Instat. C2C12 myoblasts differentiated morphologically to fuse into myotubes when cultured in the presence of 2% horse serum 4 days after reaching confluence. The effects of different concentrations of etomoxir on PPARα mRNA expression were assessed in C2C12 myotubes for 24 h, incubated in serum-free conditions. Under these culture conditions, concentrations of etomoxir ranging from 10 to 100 μm strongly decreased PPARα mRNA levels (Fig.1 A). At low etomoxir concentrations, ranging from 10 to 40 μm, the reduction in PPARα mRNA levels was about 50%, with respect to the control values. At 80 μm, etomoxir reduced PPARα mRNA levels by 87% (p = 0.001). To test whether PPARα reduction resulted in down-regulation of genes regulated by this transcription factor, we analyzed the transcript levels of several well known PPARα target genes, aco, m-cpt-I, mcad, and ucp-3 (12Desvergne B. Wahli W. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 649-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (2746) Google Scholar). The effects of the different concentrations of etomoxir on ACO expression, which catalyzes the rate-limiting step of peroxisomal β-oxidation of fatty acids, showed a similar profile to that previously reported for PPARα (Fig. 1 B). At low concentrations of etomoxir (10–40 μm), no significant changes in ACO mRNA levels were observed with respect to the control values. However, at 80 μm, a 69% reduction was observed in ACO transcripts (p < 0.04). In contrast to the effects on ACO mRNA levels, etomoxir treatment increased M-CPT-I mRNA levels, achieving a 2.6-fold induction at 80 μm, which is consistent with the reported increase in M-CPT-I in heart after etomoxir treatment (21Brandt J.M. Djouadi F. Kelly D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23786-23792Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). However, no change in M-CPT-I mRNA levels was observed at 100 μm etomoxir, with respect to the control cells. The mRNA levels of MCAD, an enzyme catalyzing a rate-limiting step in the mitochondrial β-oxidation, were not modified by etomoxir at concentrations ranging from 10 to 40 μm. In contrast, at higher concentrations, etomoxir caused a fall in MCAD transcript levels, achieving an 80% (p < 0.001) and a 98% reduction at 80 and 100 μm, respectively. UCP-3, a mitochondrial proton transporter that may be involved in fatty acid oxidation, was up-regulated by low concentrations of etomoxir, reaching a maximal induction of 3-fold at 40 μm. At 80 μm no change was observed with respect to the control values, whereas 100 μm etomoxir caused a 70% reduction. Etomoxir treatment did not affect the mRNA expression of neither PPARδ/β nor PPARγ, indicating that the effects of this drug etomoxir were specific for the PPARα isotype (data not shown). CPT-I inhibition by etomoxir prevents the entrance of palmitoyl-CoA into mitochondria, leading to its accumulation in the cytoplasm. Because palmitoyl-CoA is a precursor of sphingolipid synthesis, etomoxir treatment may result in enhanced ceramide synthesis and apoptosis (22Paumen M.B. Ishida Y. Muramatsu M. Yamamoto M. Honjo T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3324-3329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). Thus, to gain further insight into the mechanism by which etomoxir down-regulates PPARα mRNA levels, we tested the effects of several inhibitors of de novo ceramide synthesis. The initial step in ceramide synthesis is the formation of 3-ketodihydrosphingosine from palmitoyl-CoA and l-serine. This step is inhibited by the sphingosine analog ISP1 at picomole concentrations (23Miyake Y. Kozutsumi Y. Nakamura S. Fujita T. Kawasaki T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 211: 396-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). Similarly, fumonisin B1 suppresses ceramide synthetase activity (24Wang E. Norred W.P. Bacon C.W. Riley R.T. Merrill Jr., A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14486-14490Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the final step in de novosynthesis of ceramide. Neither ISP1 nor fumonisin B1 treatment prevented the down-regulation in PPARα mRNA levels produced by etomoxir (Fig. 2 A). To further clarify the potential involvement of ceramides in the down-regulation of PPARα caused by etomoxir, we treated C2C12 skeletal muscle cells with C2-ceramide, a cell-permeable ceramide analog, for 24 h. The addition of 5 μm C2-ceramide did not modify PPARα mRNA levels (Fig. 2 B). These data suggest that de novo ceramide synthesis is not involved in the effects of etomoxir. In addition, etomoxir treatment did not increase apoptosis, as observed by the incidence of nuclear fragmentation events (Fig. 2 C). Likewise, no changes were observed in DNA ladder formation after etomoxir treatment (data not shown). Long chain fatty acids should be previously activated by acyl-CoA synthetase (ACS) to be available as CPT-I substrates. Moreover, in cells etomoxir is metabolized to etomoxir-CoA, which is the active form of the drug, and it is also formed by this enzyme (25Bartlett K. Turnbull D.M. Sherratt H.S. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1984; 12: 688-689Crossref Scopus (11) Google Scholar). To study whether the effects of etomoxir were mediated through etomoxir-CoA, we tested the effects of a potent inhibitor of ACS activity, triacsin C. The addition of triacsin C to the etomoxir-treated C2C12 skeletal muscle cells did not prevent the down-regulation in PPARα mRNA levels (Fig.3 A), suggesting that etomoxir and not etomoxir-CoA was responsible for the effects caused by this drug. Interestingly, triacsin C alone significantly reduced PPARα mRNA levels by 33% (p < 0.001). Similarly, the effects of 80 μm etomoxir on M-CPT-I and UCP-3 mRNA levels were not significantly altered by triacsin C (Figs. 3,B and C). Treatment with triacsin C alone caused a 2.3- and 1.7-fold induction in M-CPT-I and UCP-3 mRNA levels, respectively, which is consistent with the activation of PPARα by free fatty acids (26Hertz R. Magenheim J. Berman I. Bar-Tana J. Nature. 1998; 392: 512-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). It has been shown that during cardiac hypertrophic growth, PPARα activity is reduced at the levels of gene expression as well as by rapid post-translational effects involving phosphorylation by the extracellular signal-regulated kinase mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway (14Barger P.M. Brandt J.M. Leone T.C. Weinheimer C.J. Kelly D.P. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 1723-1730Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). Therefore, to study whether phosphorylation was involved in the deactivation of PPARα regulatory pathways caused by etomoxir, we studied the effect of PD98059, a known inhibitor of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway, on the mRNA expression of PPARα and several of its target genes after etomoxir treatment (Fig.4). In the presence of PD98059, the 81% reduction in PPARα mRNA levels caused by etomoxir alone did not reverse. Similarly, PD98059 did not affect the reduction in ACO mRNA levels, whereas the 87% reduction in MCAD mRNA partially reversed to a 67% reduction (p < 0.05 respect to etomoxir-treated cells). These results suggests that phosphorylation was not involved in the effects caused by etomoxir in the PPARα pathway, although it can regulate MCAD expression. Finally, we attempted to identify the mechanism whereby etomoxir treatment results in a reduction in PPARα mRNA levels. Because etomoxir contains a saturated fatty acid-derived structure with an oxirane group and saturated fatty acids such as palmitate generate ROS (27Listenberger L.L. Ory D.S. Schaffer J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14890-14895Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar), probably through protein kinase C-dependent activation of NAD(P)H (28Inoguchi T. Li P. Umeda F. Yan Yu H. Kakimoto M. Imamura M. Aoki T. Etoh T. Hashimoto T. Naruse M. Sano H. Utsumi H. Nawata H. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 1939-1945Crossref PubMed Scopus (1281) Google Scholar), we determined whether etomoxir addition resulted in ROS generation. To determine ROS, we used DCFH, which shows increased fluorescence upon reaction with intracellular oxygen radicals, which can be detected by flow cytometry. Supplementation of C2C12 skeletal muscle cells with 80 μmetomoxir resulted in an increase in DCFH fluorescence, indicating that reactive oxygen intermediates were generated by etomoxir treatment (Fig. 5 A). Increased DCFH fluorescence was observed in 28% of total cell population compared with the 2% in untreated cells. The addition of 5 mm PDTC, a potent antioxidant, to etomoxir-treated cells resulted in a decrease in DCFH fluorescence to values similar to those observed in control cells. These findings demonstrate that etomoxir treatment leads to ROS generation. Because etomoxir treatment of C2C12 skeletal muscle cells results in the generation of ROS and PDTC inhibits NF-κB activity (29Bellas R.E. Fitzgerald M.J. Fausto N. Sonenshein G.E. Am. J. Pathol. 1997; 151: 891-896PubMed Google Scholar), we next studied whether this well known redox-regulated transcription factor was involved in the changes caused by etomoxir. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay demonstrated that NF-κB formed four complexes with nuclear proteins (complexes I to IV) (Fig.5 B). Specificity of the three DNA binding complexes was assessed in competition experiments by adding an excess of unlabeled NF-κB oligonucleotide. NF-κB binding activity mainly of specific complex I increased in nuclear extracts from etomoxir-treated cells. The addition of anti-p65 antibody completely supershifted complex I, indicating that this band corresponds to the NF-κB p65 subunit. Finally, to determine whether the generation of ROS is essential for the etomoxir-induced changes in the PPARα pathway, we measured the ability of the antioxidant PDTC to inhibit PPARα mRNA down-regulation in C2C12 skeletal muscle cells. In the presence of 5 mm PDTC, etomoxir was unable to significantly decrease the mRNA expression of PPARα (Fig. 5 C). Thus, the addition of PDTC, which avoids ROS generation and NF-κB activation by etomoxir, prevented the reduction in PPARα mRNA expression. The results presented here demonstrate that PPARα pathway down-regulation after etomoxir treatment in C2C12 skeletal muscle cells is mediated by ROS generation and increased NF-κB activity. The reduction in PPARα expression was reversed by PDTC, a potent antioxidant and inhibitor of NF-κB. This finding indicates that ROS generation and NF-κB are involved in the fall in PPARα expression. Previous studies suggest that age-associated reductions in PPARα mRNA levels are mediated through enhanced cellular redox stress and NF-κB activation (30Poynter M.E. Daynes R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32833-32841Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar). In fact, the NF-κB-driven cytokines tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-1β, and interleukin-6 have been demonstrated to cause a reduction in the expression of PPARα (31Parmentier J.H. Schohn H. Bronner M. Ferrari L. Batt A.M. Dauca M. Kremers P. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1997; 54: 889-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar,32Beier K. Volkl A. Fahimi D. FEBS Lett. 1997; 412: 385-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). These cytokines are present at high levels in cells from aged animals (33Daynes R.A. Araneo B.A. Ershler W.B. Maloney C. Li G.Z. Ryu S.Y. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 5219-5230PubMed Google Scholar), which present reduced mRNA levels of pparα and aco genes (30Poynter M.E. Daynes R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32833-32841Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar). When antioxidants were administered to aged rats, an increase in the mRNA levels of PPARα and ACO in splenocytes was observed, reaching similar values to those present in young animals (30Poynter M.E. Daynes R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32833-32841Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar). In the present work we show that an increase in the cellular redox state in skeletal muscle cells results in a fall in PPARα mRNA levels. In addition to the effects of NF-κB on PPARα transcript levels, a reciprocal transcriptional interference has been reported between PPARα and the p65 subunit of NF-κB (34De Delerive P. Bosscher K. Besnard S. Vanden Berghe W. Peters J.M. Gonzalez F.J. Fruchart J.C. Tedgui A. Haegeman G. Staels B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32048-32054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (987) Google Scholar). p65 repressed PPARα transactivation of a peroxisome proliferator response element-driven promoter in COS cells, and it was suggested that cross-talk between PPARα and p65 occurs mainly via the ligand binding domain of PPARα (34De Delerive P. Bosscher K. Besnard S. Vanden Berghe W. Peters J.M. Gonzalez F.J. Fruchart J.C. Tedgui A. Haegeman G. Staels B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32048-32054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (987) Google Scholar). Therefore, according to these mechanisms is likely that the increase in NF-κB activity by ROS generation after etomoxir treatment may repress both PPARα mRNA expression and PPARα transactivation. We propose that ROS generation and subsequent NF-κB activation may contribute to the accumulation of intracellular lipid accumulation in skeletal muscle cells. Etomoxir belongs to the family of CPT-I inhibitors, which activate PPARα, and their transcriptional activity correlate with their ability to bind this nuclear receptor (35Forman B.A. Chen J. Evans R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4312-4317Crossref PubMed Scopus (1870) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which these drugs activate PPARα, direct binding to this receptor and, indirectly, acting as a metabolic inhibitor, may lead to the accumulation of endogenous fatty acid ligands. Because in the present study C2C12 skeletal muscle cells were incubated without exogenous fatty acids, accumulation of fatty acyl-CoA derivatives under these conditions should be negligible. Therefore, PPARα activation by etomoxir in C2C12 skeletal muscle cells should be assigned only to direct binding to this receptor. Interestingly, our data show a different dual function of etomoxir depending on the concentration of etomoxir used. At low concentrations ranging from 10 to 40 μm the PPARα reduction in mRNA levels was about 50%. However, this reduction was not sufficient to avoid the transcriptional induction of several PPARα target genes such as UCP-3 or M-CPT-I, whereas other PPARα target genes such as ACO or MCAD were not modified. When the concentrations of etomoxir used were higher than 40 μm, the down-regulation in PPARα mRNA levels was of such intensity that a fall in the mRNA expression of all the PPARα target genes studied except M-CPT-I was observed. Therefore, the data presented here indicate that at low concentrations, when the reduction in PPARα expression is small, etomoxir activates PPARα target genes. However, at higher concentrations, another mechanism appears, leading to a fall in PPARα expression, and as a result, the expression of its target genes is reduced. It has been reported that CPT-I inhibition by etomoxir results in enhanced palmitate-induced cell death and led to a further increase in ceramide synthesis in LyD9 and WEHI-231 cells (22Paumen M.B. Ishida Y. Muramatsu M. Yamamoto M. Honjo T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3324-3329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). Therefore, we determined whether the effects of etomoxir on PPARα mRNA levels were the result of programmed cell death through increase ceramide synthesis. By using inhibitors of the de novo ceramide synthesis and a ceramide analog we have demonstrated that ceramides were not involved in the effects of etomoxir on PPARα down-regulation. In addition, etomoxir treatment did not result in increased apoptosis. In fact, in the work of Paumen et al. (22Paumen M.B. Ishida Y. Muramatsu M. Yamamoto M. Honjo T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3324-3329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar), the addition of etomoxir alone at a concentration of 400 μm did not cause nonspecific cell damage, and 200 μm etomoxir did not compromise cell viability nor increased nuclear fragmentation events in LyD9 cells. In contrast, the combined addition of etomoxir and palmitate resulted in a dramatic increase in DNA ladder formation and nuclear fragmentation. In our study, C2C12 skeletal muscle cells were treated with etomoxir in the absence of exogenous fatty acids. Therefore, as it is shown, ceramides and apoptosis does not contribute to the effects elicited by etomoxir on PPARα expression. On the contrary, we have previously reported (36Cabrero A. Alegret A. Sánchez R. Adzet T. Laguna J.C. Vázquez M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1532: 195-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) that 40 μm etomoxir up-regulates UCP-3 and M-CPT-I mRNA levels in C2C12 skeletal muscle cells. Given that C2-ceramide treatment caused a similar induction in the expression of these genes, we suggested that de novoceramide synthesis could be the mechanism underlying the induction in UCP-3 and M-CPT-I caused by etomoxir treatment. Therefore, although ceramide de novo synthesis is not involved in the down-regulation of PPARα after etomoxir treatment, it may be implicated in the up-regulation of UCP-3 and M-CPT-I observed after treatment with etomoxir. Long chain fatty acids are not available as CPT-I substrates until they are activated by acyl-CoA synthetase. The ability of etomoxir to block CPT-I activity depends also on this enzyme, which forms the active form of the drug, etomoxir-CoA. Surprisingly, the effects of etomoxir were not prevented in the presence of the acyl-CoA synthetase inhibitor, triacsin C. These results show that the effects of etomoxir do not depend on acyl-CoA synthetase to gain access to the mitochondrial CPT system, suggesting that CPT-I inhibition is not involved in the effects of this drug on PPARα expression. It remains to study whether etomoxir treatment may result in ROS generation in vivo at pharmacological doses. However, because the IC50 value of etomoxir-CoA for inhibiting CPT-I activity in rat heart is 14 μm (37Yotsumoto T. Naitoh T. Kitahara M. Tsuruzoe N. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2000; 398: 297-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), it is unlikely that etomoxir administration at pharmacological doses led to ROS generation. It is important to remark that generation of ROS, independent of ceramide synthesis, is important for the lipotoxic response and may contribute to the pathogenesis of diseases involving intracellular lipid accumulation (27Listenberger L.L. Ory D.S. Schaffer J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14890-14895Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). Here we propose a regulatory mechanism through which the inhibition of the PPARα pathway by ROS and NF-κB activation may contribute to intracellular lipid accumulation in skeletal muscle cells. Because cellular enrichment with both saturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids initiates an increase in ROS (27Listenberger L.L. Ory D.S. Schaffer J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14890-14895Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar, 38Maziere C. Conte M.A. Degonville J. Ali D. Maziere J.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Commun. 1999; 265: 116-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), it remains to study whether skeletal muscle exposition to elevated free fatty acids results in PPARα down-regulation.

https://openalex.org/W1991421191,"Serine proteinase inhibitors, including plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 (PAI-1) and antithrombin, are key regulators of hemostatic processes such as thrombosis and wound healing. Much evidence suggests that PAI-1 can influence such processes, as well as pathological events like tumor metastasis, through its ability to directly regulate binding of blood platelets and cells to extracellular substrata. One way that PAI-1 influences these processes may be mediated through its binding to the plasma protein vitronectin. Binding to PAI-1 results in the incorporation of vitronectin into a higher order complex with a potential for multivalent interactions (Podor, T. J., Shaughnessy, S. G., Blackburn, M. N., and Peterson, C. B. (2000) J. Biol. Chem. 275, 25402–25410). In this study, evidence is provided to support this concept from studies on the effects of PAI-1-induced multimerization on the interactions of vitronectin with matrix components and cell surface receptors. By monitoring complex formation and stability over time using size-exclusion high performance liquid chromatography, a correlation is made between PAI-1-induced multimerization and enhanced cell/matrix binding properties of vitronectin. This evidence indicates that PAI-1 alters the adhesive functions of vitronectin by converting the protein via the higher order complex to a self-associated, multivalent species that is functionally distinct from the abundant monomeric form found in the circulation.

Events that alter these interactions can be deleterious, leading to pathological sequelae such as improper wound healing and tumor cell migration or metastasis. For example, components of the humoral response system known as fibrinolysis, which play a role in modulating various cell-binding properties of the extracellular matrix, can be exploited by cancerous cells. By altering the content and activity of proteins related to fibrinolysis, abnormally developing cells can acquire the ability to exit residing tissues and eventually invade and metastasize. An example involves the main regulator of fibrinolysis, PAI-1,1 in which increased levels of the protein in plasma correlate with the presence of malignant ovarian cancer and higher incidence of disease (1Ho C.H. Yuan C.C. Liu S.M. Gynecol. Oncol. 1999; 75: 397-400Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). PAI-1 is a member of the serpin family and represents a key regulatory protein in proteolytic processes responsible for tissue remodeling and tumor metastasis. This property is owed to the fact that PAI-1 is the main inhibitor of both plasminogen activators, uPA and tPA. Interesting features of PAI-1 include its structural lability and the propensity it exhibits to spontaneously adopt a more stable, but inactive conformation. This feature of PAI-1 is unique among the serpin family, with active PAI-1 exhibiting a half-life of ∼90 min (2Hekman C.M. Loskutoff D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 11581-11587Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the body, however, this transition of PAI-1 into an inactive form is prevented by another important homeostatic protein, vitronectin, which binds to PAI-1 and increases the half-life of the active form approximately 2–4-fold (3De Declerck P.J. Mol M. Alessi M.C. Baudner S. Paques E.P. Preissner K.T. Muller-Berghaus G. Collen D. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15454-15461Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The fact that nearly all PAI-1 in the human vasculature is complexed with vitronectin underscores the importance of considering vitronectin when investigating PAI-1-related functions such as cell attachment and spreading (3De Declerck P.J. Mol M. Alessi M.C. Baudner S. Paques E.P. Preissner K.T. Muller-Berghaus G. Collen D. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15454-15461Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Vitronectin is a versatile, multifunctional protein found both in circulation and the ECM. It is involved in several pathways relevant to such physiological events as blood coagulation and fibrinolysis, cellular immunity, and tumor metastasis (4Preissner K.T. Blut. 1989; 59: 419-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 5Preissner K.T. Jenne D. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1991; 66: 189-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 6Preissner K.T. Jenne D.

The diverse functionality of vitronectin arises from the ability of the protein to interact with many ligands in addition to PAI-1, including cellular receptors (such as integrins and uPA receptor), glycosaminoglycans (such as heparin), extracellular components (such as collagen), and complement complexes (such as C5b-9a). Interestingly, binding to some of these ligands, including PAI-1 and complement components, causes vitronectin to experience conformational changes that alter certain functions. Reports from this laboratory (8Podor T.J. Shaughnessy S.G. Blackburn M.N. Peterson C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25402-25410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) and others (9Seiffert D. Loskutoff D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29644-29651Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) indicate that these conformational changes promote the formation of large oligomeric forms of vitronectin. These multimeric forms of vitronectin exhibit an apparent increase in heparin affinity because of multivalent binding sites for the polyanionic glycosaminoglycan (10Zhuang P. Chen A.I. Peterson C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6858-6867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Are other ligand-binding sites clustered in a similar fashion on the surface of the multimeric form of vitronectin, resulting in enhanced binding? It is intriguing to consider the potential effects of PAI-1 binding and induced multimerization of vitronectin on other functional properties of vitronectin such as cell adhesion and migration. Several lines of evidence indicate that PAI-1 and vitronectin may serve as co-factors in these processes. Vitronectin becomes incorporated into the matrix from a circulatory pool by unknown mechanisms, and its deposition into the ECM of many tissues may be a means of localizing PAI-1 function to specific sites, i.e. regions of tissue injury or tumor invasion. Vitronectin contains an important integrin-binding site (an RGD sequence) near its amino-terminal end that is capable of binding cellular integrins (11Ginsberg M.H. Loftus J.C. Plow E.F. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1988; 59: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 12Cheresh D.A. Spiro R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 17703-17711Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Current understanding dictates that PAI-1 binding to vitronectin antagonizes the cell-binding functions of vitronectin. This effect is proposed to result from steric hindrance because of the proximity of the PAI-1-binding site near the N terminus and an adjacent RGD site comprising residues 45–47 (13Stefansson S. Lawrence D.A. Nature. 1996; 383: 441-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar, 14Germer M. Kanse S.M. Kirkegaard T. Kjoller L. Felding-Habermann B. Goodman S. Preissner K.T. Eur. J.

On the other hand, the effects on cell binding activity that result from PAI-1-induced changes in the oligomeric state of vitronectin have not been carefully studied. Does self-association of vitronectin into multimers, as a consequence of PAI-1 binding, result in an enhanced binding to integrins and components of the ECM because of its multivalent nature? The main objective of this study was to investigate the effect that PAI-1-induced multimerization has on the adhesive functions of vitronectin. Native vitronectin was purified from human blood plasma using a modified protocol of the method developed by Dahlback and Podack (16Bittorf S.V. Williams E.C. Mosher D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24838-24846Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Dahlback B. Podack E.R. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 2368-2374Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Human GPIIbIIIa was obtained from Enzyme Research Laboratories. Human αvβ3 came from Calbiochem. Recombinant human PAI-1 (wild-type) was obtained from Molecular Innovations. Latent PAI-1 was either prepared by 24-hour incubation of wild-type PAI-1 at 37 °C, or it was purchased from Molecular Innovations. The S119C mutant of PAI-1 was labeled with NBD as previously described (18Gibson A. Baburaj K. Day D.E. Verhamme I. Shore J.D. Peterson C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5112-5121Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The labeled PAI-1 was a generous gift from Duane Day and Joseph Shore (Henry Ford Hospital, Detroit, MI). Human ECM and Matrigel were purchased from Becton Dickinson. Polyclonal antibodies against human vitronectin were generated in rabbits by contract with Rockland Laboratories. A monoclonal antibody specific for PAI-1 was the kind gift of Dr. Tom Podor (Hamilton Civic Hospitals Research Center, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada). Peroxidase-labeled secondary antibodies (anti-rabbit and anti-mouse) were obtained from Vector Laboratories. Protein standards used for HPLC came from Amersham Biosciences, Inc. Native vitronectin was phosphorylated using [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) and protein kinase A (catalytic subunit, product of Sigma). Unincorporated radiolabel was removed by a desalting centrifugation step using Bio-Spin 30 columns. Specific radioactivity was determined directly by quantifying vitronectin in a BCA assay (Pierce) and measuring radioactivity in a Beckman LS3801 Scintillation Counter. Specific radioactivity was 100,000 cpm/pmol of vitronectin. Chromatography of vitronectin-PAI-1 mixtures was carried out using a Phenomenex Biosep SEC-S3000 (300 × 7.8 mm) column attached to a Hewlett-Packard 1100 series HPLC system. PBS containing 0.005% sodium azide was used for the reaction and isocratic mobile phase. Equimolar concentrations of vitronectin and PAI-1 were mixed and incubated for various times at 37 °C. In some experiments, an equimolar amount of tPA was added at the end of the incubation period to inactivate PAI-1 and dissociate it from vitronectin. On occasion, NBD-S119C PAI-1 was used in the experiment to explicitly monitor the absorbance of NBD at 494 nm as a probe for PAI-1. Samples (50 μl) were injected onto the pre-equilibrated size-exclusion column and chromatographed at room temperature at a flow rate of 1 or 0.5 ml/min. Absorbance was detected directly in the flow cell at 280 or 494 nm. Samples from HPLC (100 μl) were analyzed by PAGE on 10% polyacrylamide SDS gels (19Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207529) Google Scholar). Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose filters using a Semi-Dry Blotter (Bio-Rad) in transfer buffer (0.35 m glycine, 25 mm Tris, containing 20.0% methanol). The filters were blocked as with 10% nonfat dry milk in PBS. The nitrocellulose membrane was washed three times after this and subsequent incubation steps with PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20. Immunoblotting was performed to detect vitronectin and PAI-1 simultaneously by incubating the filter with a 1:2500 dilution of polyclonal anti-vitronectin rabbit serum and a 1:2500 dilution of a monoclonal antibody to PAI-1 in a 2.0% solution of nonfat dry milk in PBS. The blot was then incubated with a 1:1000 dilution of both HRP-linked goat anti-rabbit and HRP-linked rabbit anti-mouse antibodies in a 20-ml solution of 2.0% milk in PBS. Immunostained protein bands were visualized by developing in a freshly prepared solution of 30 ml of PBS containing 50 mg/ml 4-chloronapthol and a 1:3,000 dilution of 30% H2O2. Changes in the fluorescence emission of NBD-S119C-PAI-1 were measured using the PerkinElmer LS50B luminescence spectrometer with an excitation wavelength of 480 nm and emission wavelength of 525 nm. Excitation and emission slits were set at 4 and 7 mm, respectively. Solutions of NBD-PAI-1 (200 nm) in HEPES buffer (100 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 8000, pH 7.4) were titrated with small aliquots of monomeric human vitronectin to a final concentration of 550 nm. Samples were mixed in a total volume of 2.0 ml in acrylic cuvettes (Sarstedt) that were pre-coated with a 1.0% (w/v) solution of polyethylene glycol 20,000, according to the procedure of Latallo and Hall (20Latallo Z.S. Hall J.A. Thromb. Res. 1986; 43: 507-521Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Titrations were performed in triplicate. All data were mathematically corrected for dilution. Change in emission was calculated using the equation (F −F 0)/F 0, whereF is the emission intensity and F 0 is the starting emission intensity of NBD-PAI-1 in the absence of vitronectin. Emission scans were performed over a wavelength range of 500–600 nm using an excitation wavelength of 480 nm. Measurements were plotted as a function of titrant concentration using the graphing program KaleidaGraph (Synergy Software). Data were fit to the Hill equation. ΔF/F0=ΔFmax/F0·[S] n/((K0.5) n+[S] n)Equation 1 S is the total titrant concentration,K 0.5 corresponds to the titrant concentration at half-maximal saturation, and n is the Hill coefficient. Rabbit SMCs (American Red Cross) were grown to near confluence in tissue culture dishes in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. Cells harvested by trypsinization were subsequently incubated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's growth media containing 32P-labeled vitronectin with or without PAI-1. Control cell binding experiments also were conducted using latent PAI-1. These mixtures were then incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. Following incubation, cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 12,000 × g and washed three times with PBS followed by re-centrifugation. Washed cell pellets were then placed in a liquid scintillation mixture, and their radioactivity was measured in a Beckman LS3801 scintillation counter. 96-well ELISA plates (polypropylene or polystyrene, CoStar) were coated with 500 ng of human ECM or 2.5 μg of Matrigel in PBS. Wells were washed three times with PBS and then blocked with 3.5% BSA for 1 h at 37 °C. Vitronectin and PAI-1 were mixed in variable ratios in PBS containing 0.2% BSA and 0.1% Tween 20 (to prevent nonspecific binding), and the samples were incubated for various times at 37 °C. Following washing with buffer containing BSA and Tween, blocked wells were layered with vitronectin-PAI-1 mixtures and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. Following incubation, mixtures were removed, wells washed, and bound vitronectin was detected by two different methods. For the human ECM binding assays, detection was immunochemical, using a polyclonal anti-vitronectin IgG and a peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG. The plates were then developed with a 0.2 mg/ml solution of ABTS in 50 mm sodium citrate, pH 5.5, containing a 1:2000 dilution of 30% hydrogen peroxide. ELISA plates were read (λ = 405) on a Wallac Victor2 ELISA plate reader. For the Matrigel-binding experiments, 32P-labeled vitronectin was used and detected by scintillation counting. Nonspecific binding was monitored in all experiments and found to be minimal. Effects of nonspecific binding were subtracted from the reported results. Assays were also performed to test the effects of ionic strength and tPA-mediated release of PAI-1, using equimolar concentrations of tPA and PAI-1. ELISA plates (polystyrene, CoStar) were coated with 250 ng of GPIIbIIIa or αvβ3 in integrin-binding buffer (50 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mmMgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2). Wells were washed three times with integrin-binding buffer and then blocked with 3.5% BSA for 1 h at 37 °C. Equimolar or 1:2 mixtures of vitronectin and PAI-1 were incubated in integrin-binding buffer containing 0.2% BSA and 0.1% Tween 20 (to prevent nonspecific binding) for various times at 37 °C. Following washing with integrin-binding buffer containing BSA and Tween, blocked wells were layered with vitronectin-PAI-1 mixtures and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. Incubation with secondary antibody-enzyme conjugates and development with substrates were performed as described above for the matrix-binding assays. Assays were also performed to test the effects of metals, ionic strength, and tPA-mediated release of PAI-1, using equimolar concentrations of tPA and PAI-1. An underlying hypothesis of this work is that the interaction of vitronectin with circulating target ligands, such as PAI-1, results in the formation of large complexes that may have enhanced binding to other potential targets, including heparin and cell-surface receptors. The increased binding is because of the multivalent nature of the binding sites for these ligands on the self-associated form of vitronectin (10Zhuang P. Chen A.I. Peterson C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6858-6867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). For the purposes of this study, namely to investigate the effects of PAI-1 induced multimerization of vitronectin, an HPLC method of size-exclusion chromatography was employed to monitor the formation of large multivalent complexes. Fig. 1 shows chromatograms of equimolar mixtures of vitronectin and PAI-1 that were incubated for various times. Separation immediately following mixing of vitronectin and PAI-1 demonstrated the fast formation of very large complexes (elution time = 6 min). From 1 to 4 h, significant amounts of the high molecular weight complexes accumulated. Analysis at long times (up to 36 h) demonstrated that high molecular weight forms of vitronectin persisted even after the disassociation of PAI-1 from the complex upon its conversion to a latent form. In the HPLC experiments, NBD-S119C PAI-1 provided a chromophore to directly determine whether PAI-1 was an integral part of the high molecular complexes that form. As shown in Fig.2 A, the elution profile at 494 nm (the extinction maximum for NBD) confirms that PAI-1 is present in the high molecular weight complexes formed after 1 h of incubation. Furthermore, SDS-PAGE and Western blotting (Fig.2 B) demonstrated that these large complexes contained both vitronectin and PAI-1. The same approach indicated that the high molecular weight species observed at long times (e.g.36 h) comprised oligomeric forms of vitronectin without associated PAI-1. As a control, latent PAI-1 did not cause the formation of large complexes when mixed with vitronectin. These results are in agreement with findings from Seiffert and Loskutoff (9Seiffert D. Loskutoff D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29644-29651Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), as well as with a recent study from this laboratory that demonstrates self-association of vitronectin when complexed with PAI-1 (8Podor T.J. Shaughnessy S.G. Blackburn M.N. Peterson C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25402-25410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The information obtained from this HPLC gel filtration approach was instructive for the remainder of this study. By monitoring the formation of complexes upon vitronectin binding to PAI-1 over time, we could correlate this information with effects that PAI-1-induced multimerization has on the adhesive properties of vitronectin. We were especially interested in functions relative to matrix and/or cell interactions. Research from this laboratory (10Zhuang P. Chen A.I. Peterson C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6858-6867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), which demonstrates the positive effect of increased valency (upon vitronectin multimerization) on the binding of vitronectin to heparin, raises the possibility that PAI-1-induced oligomerization of vitronectin may also enhance the binding of the protein to other ligands. Of particular interest is the association of vitronectin and its complexes with the ECM, which will be enhanced by interaction with the multivalent substrates in the matrix and which may be mediated by heparin-like glycosaminoglycans. The ability of vitronectin to interact with both integrins and matrix proteins places vitronectin at the boundary of cell-matrix interactions and activities. Results presented in Fig.3 address this idea by demonstrating that vitronectin, when incubated with PAI-1, shows increased binding to matrix-coated ELISA plates. The enhanced binding of vitronectin upon incubation with PAI-1 was demonstrated using two commercially available matrices, human ECM and Matrigel. Binding of complexes is observed with both matrices and is detected using either immunochemical (panel A) or radiological detection (panel B), indicating a specific effect of PAI-1 on matrix incorporation of vitronectin. These findings support a model in which PAI-1 promotes formation of vitronectin multimers that have enhanced affinity for components that constitute the ECM. Although equimolar mixtures of vitronectin and PAI-1 exhibited enhanced association with the ECM, as shown in Fig. 3, we considered whether nonstoichiometric mixtures of the two proteins would vary in matrix-binding behavior. This experiment was initiated in light of our recently published results that demonstrate the association of vitronectin and PAI-1 into complexes with a 2:4 stoichiometry (8Podor T.J. Shaughnessy S.G. Blackburn M.N. Peterson C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25402-25410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Thus, the concentration of vitronectin was fixed in the ECM-binding experiments, whereas the concentration of PAI-1 was varied from less than stoichiometric to a 4-fold excess relative to vitronectin. As shown in Fig. 4, matrix binding is dependent on the amount of PAI-1 present, saturating at a higher value for relative binding than observed for a simple 1:1 ratio of the two proteins in Fig. 3. For this reason, subsequent ECM-binding experiments were performed using a 2:1 ratio of PAI-1:vitronectin, and these results show a greater enhancement in ECM binding than the titrations shown in Fig. 3. Latent PAI-1, tested over a wide range in concentrations, had no effect on matrix binding by vitronectin. To correlate the observed effects of PAI-1 binding on vitronectin adhesive functions and the formation of large multimeric complexes as a result of this interaction, these properties were carefully monitored over time. Mixtures of vitronectin and PAI-1 were incubated for various times and then added to ECM-coated ELISA plates. Fig.5 A demonstrates the significant increase in the amount of vitronectin bound to matrix when PAI-1 is added versus native vitronectin alone. Strikingly, this increase in matrix deposition persists at long times after which PAI-1 is no longer present in the large complexes. These results indicate that PAI-1 binding causes a consistent enhancement of the adhesive form of vitronectin in a temporal pattern similar to that of complex formation and vitronectin multimerization observed in the HPLC time course described above. For an explicit test of the requirement for PAI-1 in the complexes for the enhancement in matrix binding, tPA was added to the incubation mixtures at timed intervals. This protease is known to associate with PAI-1 to form a stable acyl-complex, thus disrupting the vitronectin-PAI-1 interaction (21Lawrence D.A. Palaniappan S. Stefansson S. Olson S.T. Francis-Chmura A.M. Shore J.D. Ginsburg D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7676-7680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Dissociation of the vitronectin-PAI-1 complex by adding tPA at early times (∼1 h) diminishes binding to the matrix, as shown in Fig. 5 A. Note that the binding observed is nevertheless enhanced relative to the binding of monomeric vitronectin. Indeed, analysis by HPLC gel filtration (Fig. 5 B) demonstrated that, by 1 h, a stable multimeric form of vitronectin that more readily associates with the matrix is present, and that it persists even after tPA-mediated release of PAI-1 from the complexes. The fact that tPA treatment reduces the amount of complexes observed indicates that active PAI-1 is present in these high molecular weight complexes formed at 1 h. From the decrease in peak height eluting at the void volume of the column, the findings also indicate that some of the complexes can disaggregate when tPA neutralizes PAI-1 and dissociates it from vitronectin. However, at longer times, adding tPA to the mixtures has little effect, indicating that the aged vitronectin aggregates exhibit enhanced matrix binding that is independent of PAI-1. Presumably, this reflects the multimeric nature of the large complexes that persist after PAI-1 dissociates. As shown in Fig.6, increasing ionic strength can reverse the association of vitronectin complexes with the matrix upon PAI-1 binding. At a 1 m NaCl concentration, the enhancement of vitronectin binding is decreased by ∼70%. These results indicate that the binding of vitronectin-PAI-1 complexes to components of the extracellular matrix is also partly dependent on ionic interactions, such as those known to occur between vitronectin and glycosaminoglycans. To ensure that these results are not because of an effect of ionic strength on the interaction between PAI-1 and vitronectin, the binding of PAI-1 and vitronectin was monitored at varying ionic strengths using a fluorescence-based assay with NBD-labeled PAI-1. The binding of the two proteins has been previously measured using this approach with PAI-1 mutants containing fluorescent labels within the reactive center loop (18Gibson A. Baburaj K. Day D.E. Verhamme I. Shore J.D. Peterson C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5112-5121Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). These former measurements were challenging because of low changes in fluorescence quantum yield upon vitronectin binding. A more suitable form of PAI-1 for the fluorescence assay is the mutant with an NBD label at a cysteine substituted for serine 119, situated near the vitronectin-binding site on PAI-1 (22Lawrence D.A. Berkenpas M.B. Palaniappan S. Ginsburg D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15223-15228Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Binding isotherms for NBD-S119C-PAI-1 and vitronectin, in the presence of both 150 and 500 mm NaCl, are shown in Fig. 7. Cooperative binding isotherms were observed, reflecting a complex binding/association phenomenon consistent with the ultracentrifugation data that demonstrate a nonstoichiometric binding of the two proteins accompanied by self-association of vitronectin (8Podor T.J. Shaughnessy S.G. Blackburn M.N. Peterson C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25402-25410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Data fits to the Hill equation were used to calculate K 0.5, which can be correlated with an average binding affinity for the interaction. Under both salt conditions, a K 0.5 of ∼60 nm and a Hill coefficient of 2 were obtained. Differences observed in the maximal fluorescence change observed with the two salt concentrations are presumably because of intrinsic properties (e.g. quantum yield, exposure to solvent, quenching) of the fluorophores at the two ionic strengths. Salt-dependent quenches of fluorescence are a well established phenomenon in photobiophysics. These findings demonstrate that similar complexes form regardless of the ionic strength of the solution. Furthermore, they argue that the ionic-strength dependent effects observed in Fig. 6reflect dissoc"

In this study we analyzed in detail the topology of Sac1p. Our data show that Sac1p is a type II transmembrane protein with a large N-terminal cytosolic domain, which is anchored in the membrane by the two potential transmembrane helices near the C terminus. Based on this topology, we created a mutation that caused retention of Sac1p in the ER and as a consequence showed specific alterations in cellular phosphoinositide levels. Our results suggest that Sac1p controls a pool of phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate and phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate in the ER. Retention of Sac1p in the ER also stimulates ATP transport into the ER lumen but causes the same Golgi-specific defects that are seen in asac1 null mutant.

These molecules participate in the regulation of various cellular functions including membrane trafficking, cytoskeletal organization, cell proliferation, and metabolism (1Martin T.F. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 231-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar, 2Simonsen A. Wurmser A.E. Emr S.D. Stenmark H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 485-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). Although it is well understood that generation of such phosphoinositides by specific lipid kinases is essential (3Carpenter C.L. Cantley L.C. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 153-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar), there is increasing evidence that the regulated termination of these signals by phosphatases is equally important. Phosphoinositide phosphatases are consequently important mediators of phosphoinositide signaling events. Phosphatases belonging to a subclass share a specific domain, which was first identified in the yeast Sac1 protein (4Hughes W.E. Cooke F.T. Parker P.J. Biochem. J. 2000; 350: 337-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The Sac1 homology domain containing phosphatases catalyze the hydrolysis of a variety of phosphoinositide species and are found from yeast to mammals (4Hughes W.E. Cooke F.T. Parker P.J. Biochem. J. 2000; 350: 337-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). In vitrostudies have shown that the Sac1 homology domain is capable of dephosphorylating PtdIns(3)P, PtdIns(4)P, and phosphatidylinositol 3,5-bisphosphate, whereas PtdIns(4,5)P2 is not accepted as a substrate (5Guo S.

In yeast, this protein family consists of five different members, Sac1p, Fig4p, and in addition the three dual specificity phosphatases Inp51p, Inp52p, and Inp53p (4Hughes W.E. Cooke F.T. Parker P.J. Biochem. J. 2000; 350: 337-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Whereas the function of Fig4p is unclear, all other members of this family are polyphosphoinositide phosphatases and therefore perform important functions as regulators of phosphoinositide metabolism at various cellular locations (7Stolz L.E. Huynh C.V. Thorner J. York J.D. Genetics. 1998; 148: 1715-1729Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Srinivasan S. Seaman M. Nemoto Y. Daniell L. Suchy S.F. Emr S. De C.P. Nussbaum R. Eur. J.

Bankaitis V.A. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 79-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Sac1p is localized to ER and Golgi membranes (10Whitters E.A. Cleves A.E. McGee T.P. Skinner H.B. Bankaitis V.A. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 79-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), which indicates that this protein has compartment-specific functions. Genetic and biochemical analyses defined Sac1p as an important regulator of ATP uptake into the ER lumen, suggesting that one ER-specific function of this protein is the maintenance of the secretory function of this organelle by controlling the supply of ATP inside the ER lumen (11Mayinger P. Bankaitis V.A. Meyer D.I. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1377-1386Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar,12Kochendorfer K.U. Then A.R. Kearns B.G. Bankaitis V.A. Mayinger P.

Biol. 2001; 11: 1421-1426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) evidence that Sac1p regulates a pool of PtdIns(4)P in the Golgi that is important for forward trafficking to the cell periphery. The role of phosphoinositides in the ER is less well understood. A recent report (17Wiradjaja F. Ooms L.M. Whisstock J.C. McColl B.K. Helfenbaum L. Sambrook J.F. Gething M.J. Mitchell C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 134: 2Google Scholar) indicates that lipid signals are also important regulators for vesicular transport at the yeast ER. In another study (18Foti M. Audhya A. Emr S.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 2396-2411Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) it was shown that an ER resident portion of Sac1p plays a role in regulating phosphoinositide levels in this organelle. However, the exact cellular function of Sac1p in the ER remained unclear. It is also unknown how the differential localization of Sac1p to ER and Golgi membranes is mediated. Sequence analysis has revealed that Sac1p contains none of the characterized sequence motives that are required for retention in the ER. To date, the exact topology of the yeast Sac1 protein has not been studied in detail. An analysis using a mammalian version of Sac1p has shown that the N-terminal hydrophilic portion of this protein, which also contains the catalytic phosphatase domain, is oriented to the cytoplasm (19Nemoto Y. Kearns B.G. Wenk M.R. Chen H. Mori K. De Alb Jr., J.G. Camilli P. Bankaitis V.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34293-34305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). However, it remains unclear which portion of the protein is integrated into the membrane. In this work we analyzed the transmembrane arrangement of yeast Sac1p by proteolysis, specific antibodies, and expression of different truncated versions of this protein. We found that Sac1p is a type II membrane protein containing two potential transmembrane domains near the C terminus. In addition, we analyzed two different mutations inSAC1 that both cause retention of the respective mutant protein in the ER. Our data suggest that Sac1p controls a distinct pool of phosphoinositides in the ER. Sac1 constructs for expressing proteins containing a c-Myc epitope at their N termini were created by PCR using the following primers: myc-Sac1p, 5′-CGT CTA GAA TGT GTG AAC AAA AGC TTA TTT CTG AAG AAG ACT TGG GTG GTG GTA TGA CAG GTC CAA TAG TG-3′ and 5′-GCT CTA GAA GCT TGT TCT TCC CTC TG-3′; myc-Sac1-(1–504), 5′-CGT CTA GAA TGT GTG AAC AAA AGC TTA TTT CTG AAG AAG ACT TGG GTG GTG GTA TGA CAG GTC CAA TAG TG-3′ and 5′-GCT CTA GAT TAT TAT CCA CCA AGG AAT AAA TCG-3′; and Sac1-(505–623), 5′-GCT CTA GAA TGT GTG AAC AAA AGC TTA TTT CTG AAG AAG ACT TGG GTG GTG GTA TGA GAC CAC ATA CCG CTT CTA TC-3′ and 5′-GCT CTA GAA GCT TGT TCT TCC CTC TG-3′. The constructs were digested with XbaI and cloned into YCplac33 containing either theGAL1/10 promoter or the endogenous SAC1 promoter. The SAC1 promoter (500 bp upstream of AUG) was amplified by PCR using primers 5′-GCG AAT TCG CTA CCA CAT CCC TGA CGT C-3′ and 5′-GCG GAT CCA TCT AGA CGA GAA AAT ATA C-3′ and cloned into theEcoRI and BamHI sites of YCplac33. A DNA fragment encoding the N-terminal portion of Sac1pincluding the potential transmembrane region TM1 (SAC1-(1–552)) was amplified by PCR using the primers 5′-CGT CTA GAA TGT GTG AAC AAA AGC TTA TTT CTG AAG AAG ACT TGG GTG GTG GTA TGA CAG GTC CAA TAG TG-3′ and 5′-GCT CTA GAA CTG CTG GTA AAT CTA TCT TT-3′. The XbaI-digested PCR product was cloned into YCplac33 containing the GAL1/10 promoter resulting in pGK64. A DNA fragment encoding the C terminus of SAC1 but lacking the coding region for potential transmembrane segment TM2 (SAC1-(574–623)) was amplified by PCR using the primers 5′-GCA CGC GTC GAC AAG AAC GGT ATT CAG TTT-3′ and 5′-CTA CGC GTC GAC AGC TTG TTC TTC CCT CTG-3′. The SalI-digested PCR product was cloned into pGK64, resulting in pGK65, which now contains a version of SAC1 in which the entire coding region for TM2 is replaced by a short sequence coding for the four amino acids, Ser, Arg, Val, and Asp (sac1ΔTM2). To generate EYFP-SAC1 fusion constructs, a genomic fragment containing the Sac1 promoter (500 bp upstream of AUG) was amplified using the primers 5′-TTG CGG CCG CAC AGC TAC CAC ATC CCT GAC-3′ and 5′-GGC TCG AGA TCT AGA CGA GAA AAT ATA CG-3′ digested withNotI and XhoI and cloned into a YCplac33 vector containing the coding region of GFP (pGK25), resulting in pGK26.

ThisBamHI/XhoI fragment was cloned into pGK26 replacing the coding region of GFP with EYFP (pGK66). For expression of N-terminal EYFP fusion proteins, DNA fragments containing the coding regions of SAC1, sac1–22, andsac1-KKRD were cloned into the XbaI site of pGK66 resulting in pGK67, pGK68, and pGK69. To generate the KKRD motive at the C terminus of Sac1p, a L620K mutation was introduced intoSAC1 by mutagenesis PCR using the primers 5′-CAA GCC GGA TCC TAA AAA AAG AGA TTA ATG AGT TCT-3′ and 5′-AGA ACT CAT TAA TCT CTT TTT TTA GGA TCC GGC TTG-3′. To create a SEC63-ECFP fusion, aNotI/XhoI fragment containing SEC63and its promoter was obtained by digestion of pJK59 (21Prinz W.A. Grzyb L. Veenhuis M. Kahana J.A. Silver P.A. Rapoport T.A. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 461-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). This fragment was cloned into pRS314 (22Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), resulting in pGK59. A fragment coding for ECFP was isolated from pPS1890 (20Damelin M. Silver P.A. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 133-140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) by digestion withXhoI/KpnI and ligated into pGK59, resulting in pGK60. Yeast microsomes were prepared exactly as described previously (23Mayinger P. Meyer D.I. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 659-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Microsomal preparations were adjusted to a concentration of 2 mg/ml in membrane buffer (250 mmsucrose, 50 mm potassium acetate, 20 mm HEPES, 1 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.4). For complete digestion membranes were treated with 0.5 mg/ml proteinase K for 60 min on ice. Partial digests were conducted by incubation of membranes with 0.1 mg/ml trypsin for 30 min on ice. The proteolytic reactions were terminated by addition of 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride to the individual samples and further incubation for 10 min on ice. Integrity of the microsomal preparation was controlled by protection of the luminal factor Kar2p from proteolytic degradation. Proteolytic products of Sac1p were separated by SDS-PAGE (10% polyacrylamide). To identify small peptides below 10 kDa, high resolution Tricine SDS-PAGE was used (24Schägger H. Jagow G.V. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10470) Google Scholar). Antibodies were raised in rabbits (New Zealand White) using the following peptides, which correspond to specific regions in Sac1p: amino acids 306–317, NQKGHELPVKEGC (anti-Sac1); amino acids 613–623, CKFSKPDPLKRD (anti-Sac1-C). The peptides were coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin using glutaraldehyde as described in the literature (25Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988: 72-87Google Scholar). Transfer of proteins to nitrocellulose and decoration with antibodies were performed according to standard procedures (25Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988: 72-87Google Scholar). Because sac1 mutants are inositol auxotrophs, yeast cells were generally cultivated in 0.1 mminositol before and during the labeling procedure. Early log phase cells were incubated with 5 μCi/ml myo-[14C]inositol for 3–4 doubling times. Labeling and extraction of lipids was performed as described earlier (16Schorr M. Then A. Tahirovic S. Hug N. Mayinger P. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1421-1426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Deacylation of lipids was performed as described previously (26Serunian L.A. Auger K.R. Cantley L.C. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 198: 78-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). HPLC analysis of glycerophosphoinositols was carried out on a 250 × 4.6-mm Partisil SAX column (Whatman) using a Jasco HPLC system equipped with an LB 508 Radioflow detector (Berthold, Bad Wildbach, Germany). Elution and quantification of glycerophosphoinositols were performed as described previously (16Schorr M. Then A. Tahirovic S. Hug N. Mayinger P. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1421-1426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). 1.3 ml of cytosol containing either soluble myc-Sac1-(1–504) or myc-Sac1-(221–504) was incubated with 40 μl of a suspension containing monoclonal anti-c-Myc epitope antibodies covalently linked to protein A-Sepharose for 3 h at 4 °C. The beads were then washed 4 times in washing buffer (0.3% Triton X-100, 300 mm NaCl, 40 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The Sac1p fragments were eluted from the beads with 140 μl of 100 mm glycine, pH 3.5. The eluate was adjusted to pH 7.0 by addition of 0.5m Tris, pH 8.0. For measuring phosphatase activity a modified version of a recently published protocol was used (27Maehama T. Taylor G.S. Slama J.T. Dixon J.E. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 279: 248-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). 17 μl of reaction buffer (200 mm sodium acetate, 100 mm BisTris, 100 mm Tris, 10 μg/ml porcine gelatin, and 4 mm dithiothreitol, pH 6.0), 25 μl of eluate containing 2 μg of recombinant soluble myc-Sac1-(1–504) or myc-Sac1–22-(1–504) and 8 μl of liposomes (250 μmphosphatidylserine and 50 μm PtdIns(4)P in reaction buffer) were mixed and incubated at 30 °C for the various times. Reactions were stopped by addition of an equal amount of 100 mm N-ethylmaleimide, centrifuged at 150,000 × g, and the supernatants were transferred to fresh Eppendorf tubes. 25 μl of each supernatant was pipetted into enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay plate wells. 50 μl of Malachite Green solution (1 volume of 4.2% ammonium molybdate in 4 mHCl and 3 volumes of 0.045% Malachite Green, 0.01% Tween 20) were added to each well. After incubation for 20 min at room temperature theA 620 was measured. Preparation of yeast microsomes and ATP transport assays were conducted exactly as described previously (23Mayinger P. Meyer D.I. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 659-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Usually, 300-μl microsome suspensions (3 mg/ml protein) and 50 μm [14C]ATP were used in the uptake reactions (23Mayinger P. Meyer D.I. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 659-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Cells were grown in appropriate selective media to early log phase. EYFP and ECFP signals in living yeast cells were analyzed on a Olympus BX60 fluorescence microscope with a Zeiss UPlanAPO 100× oil immersion objective. Pictures were recorded using a Hamamatsu C4742-95 CCD camera and “Openlab” software from Improvision (Heidelberg, Germany). When analyzed by secondary structure prediction programs, the sequence of Sac1p contains a large hydrophilic N-terminal domain and two hydrophobic stretches near the C terminus that could potentially serve as transmembrane regions. According to this model, the C terminus of Sac1p should be sufficient to anchor this protein in the membrane. To obtain experimental proof for such a topology, we expressed Myc-tagged truncated versions of Sac1p, containing either only the extreme C terminus composed of amino acids 505–623 or a major N-terminal portion from amino acids 1 to 504 that contained the entire Sac1 homology domain. Both fragments cofractionated with microsomal membranes, but only the C-terminal fragment was resistant to high salt and sodium carbonate treatment (Fig.1 A). As a control we also probed the membrane association of Sec61p, which spans the membranes several times (Fig. 1 A). The C terminus of Sac1p therefore behaves like an integral membrane protein. In contrast, the N-terminal fragment could be completely released from microsomal membranes by sodium carbonate treatment (Fig. 1 B) and accordingly has the characteristics of a peripheral membrane protein, such as Srp54p (28Hann B.C. Walter P. Cell. 1991; 67: 131-144Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). This interaction with the membrane of a N-terminal fragment of Sac1p may reflect an interaction of Sac1p with peripheral or integral membrane proteins in the ER membrane. To probe the topology of Sac1p in more detail, we expressed a version of this protein containing a c-Myc tag at its N terminus from a low copy vector in a sac1Δ strain under control of aGAL1/10 promoter. Expression of the myc-Sac1 protein fully complemented sac1 mutant phenotypes such as inositol auxotrophy and hypersensitivity toward Calcofluor White when expression was induced by galactose and can therefore functionally replace the wild-type protein (data not shown). Proteolytic treatment with proteinase K of microsomal membranes containing myc-Sac1p led to rapid degradation of the N-terminal Myc tag (Fig.2 A). In contrast, the luminal Kar2p was only susceptible to proteolytic degradation when the membranes had been treated with detergent (Fig. 2 A), showing that the membranes were intact and impermeable to the protease. This result indicated that the N terminus of Sac1p faces the cytosol. Such a result was expected because the hydrophilic N-terminal domain of Sac1p contains also the phosphatase activity (6Hughes W.E. Woscholski R. Cooke F.T. Patrick R.S. Dove S.K. McDonald N.Q. Parker P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 801-808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), and no luminal PtdIns kinase activity has been detected so far. Sequence analysis revealed that the primary structure of Sac1p contains two hydrophobic stretches near the C terminus from amino acids 524–544 and 554–573, both of which could potentially span the membrane. Placing the N terminus of Sac1p toward the cytosol therefore created three distinct hypothetical topologies depending on whether either one or both potential transmembrane segments were used. To distinguish whether Sac1p spans the membrane once or twice, we engineeredsac1ΔTM2, a version of SAC1 in which the region encoding the second potential transmembrane domain from amino acids 554–573 was deleted. Sac1ΔTM2p was associated with microsomes and was not extractable by treatment of microsomal membranes with sodium carbonate and therefore, like Sac1p, behaved as an integral membrane protein (data not shown). We then used limited proteolysis and polyclonal antisera specific to various regions of Sac1p to obtain information on the respective topologies of Sac1p and Sac1ΔTM2p. Mild digestion of microsomal membranes containing Sac1p with trypsin generated a polypeptide of about 65 kDa, ∼5 kDa shorter than the undigested protein, whereas Sac1ΔTM2p stayed largely intact under those mild conditions (Fig. 2 B). Proteolytic treatment with proteinase K of microsomal membranes containing Sac1ΔTM2p with an N-terminal Myc tag led to rapid degradation of the Myc epitope, indicating that, like in myc-Sac1p, the N terminus of myc-Sac1ΔTM2p was oriented toward the cytosol (Fig. 2 A). The 65-kDa proteolytic species of Sac1p was detected by antibodies raised against a peptide consisting of amino acids 306–317 in the middle of Sac1p (anti-Sac1) (Fig. 2 B). Importantly, this 65-kDa fragment was not recognized by antibodies specific to the last 11 amino acids of Sac1p (anti-Sac1-C), indicating that this C-terminal epitope of Sac1p was destroyed or removed by this treatment with trypsin (Fig.2 B). If the C terminus of Sac1p was facing the ER lumen, either a 7.5- or an 11-kDa fragment should be protected from proteolytic digestion in the lumen of the microsomal membranes. In contrast, if Sac1p would traverse the membrane twice a 5.5-kDa C-terminal portion of the protein would face the cytosol and be exposed to the protease. Because the N terminus of Sac1pΔTM2p is oriented toward the cytosol (Fig. 2 A), the C terminus of this protein must face the microsomal lumen, and consequently a 9-kDa protected fragment should be detectable (compare structural models in Fig.3 B). We therefore analyzed proteolyzed membranes containing either Sac1p or Sac1ΔTM2p using a Tricine SDS-PAGE system, which can resolve low molecular weight peptides (24Schägger H. Jagow G.V. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10470) Google Scholar). Again, the extent of proteolysis was analyzed using antibodies raised against the C-terminal peptide (anti-Sac1-C). Clearly, no protected low molecular weight peptide species could be detected by anti-Sac1-C antibodies after digesting membranes containing Sac1p, whereas a 9-kDa fragment was visible after protease treatment of membranes containing Sac1pΔTM2p (Fig. 3 A). As a control, aliquots of the same samples were also analyzed by conventional SDS-PAGE and by Western blotting using antibodies against Kar2p to ensure that the membranes were intact (Fig. 2 A). This experiment indicated strongly that the C termini of Sac1p and Sac1ΔTM2p face opposite sides of the microsomal membrane. As expected, the C terminus of Sac1pΔTM2 is located on the luminal side of the microsomes and therefore protected from proteolysis. Using identical conditions, the C-terminal epitope in Sac1p recognized by anti-Sac1-C antibodies is obviously accessible to the added protease. Consequently, the C terminus of Sac1p must face the cytosolic side of microsomal membranes. In summary our data are in favor of a topological model of Sac1p in which this protein spans the membrane twice with both the N and the C terminus facing the cytosol (Fig. 3 B). Detailed analysis of different point mutations in SAC1 such assac1–22 revealed compartment-specific differences in the strength of the respective phenotypes (12Kochendorfer K.U. Then A.R. Kearns B.G. Bankaitis V.A. Mayinger P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1506-1515Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 29Kearns B.G. McGee T.P. Mayinger P. Gedvilaite A. Phillips S.E. Kagiwada S. Bankaitis V.A. Nature. 1997; 387: 101-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Whereas bothsac1–22 and sac1Δ strains show defects in actin cytoskeletal arrangement and Golgi trafficking,sac1Δ strains additionally display impaired ATP transport into the ER, a defect that is absent in the sac1–22 mutant (12Kochendorfer K.U. Then A.R. Kearns B.G. Bankaitis V.A. Mayinger P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1506-1515Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). To address whether the absence of ER-specific defects in this mutant was a consequence of an altered cellular localization of the mutant protein, we compared the intracellular localization of N-terminal EYFP fusion proteins of wild-type Sac1p and Sac1–22p. To ensure that comparable levels of the different EYFP fusion proteins were synthesized, all fusion proteins were expressed under control of the endogenous SAC1 promoter from CENplasmids. There is some disagreement in the literature regarding the intracellular localization of Sac1p. A study using immunofluorescence and biochemical fractionations had shown that wild-type Sac1p localizes to both ER and Golgi membranes (10Whitters E.A. Cleves A.E. McGee T.P. Skinner H.B. Bankaitis V.A. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 79-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). In a recent analysis, it was shown that the vast majority of Sac1p versions containing GFP or multiple Myc epitopes at their C termini were restricted to the ER (18Foti M. Audhya A. Emr S.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 2396-2411Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Because Sac1p has a Golgi-specific role (16Schorr M. Then A. Tahirovic S. Hug N. Mayinger P. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1421-1426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), it was important to prove explicitly that our fusion of EYFP to the N terminus of Sac1p does not disturb this specific function of Sac1p. In control experiments it was therefore confirmed that expression of EYFP-Sac1p in asac1Δ strain fully complemented the hypersensitivity toward Calcofluor White (Fig. 8 A), which is a Golgi-specificsac1Δ mutant phenotype (16Schorr M. Then A. Tahirovic S. Hug N. Mayinger P. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1421-1426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Other phenotypes such as inositol auxotrophy were also complemented by expression of Sac1p fused N-terminally to EYFP (data not shown). Because a Sec63p-GFP fusion protein has been reported to be a useful marker for yeast ER, we used a Sec63p-ECFP derivative for in vivo colocalization with EYFP-Sac1 proteins in the respective strains. More than 50% of the cells expressing EYFP-Sac1p showed weak or no perinuclear staining, and EYFP-Sac1p was instead confined to punctate structures resembling the localization reported for non-tagged Sac1p (Fig.4 A) (10Whitters E.A. Cleves A.E. McGee T.P. Skinner H.B. Bankaitis V.A. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 79-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Clearly, these punctate structures did not colocalize with Sec63-ECFP indicating that a substantial portion of Sac1p is not restricted to the ER. In striking contrast, EYFP-Sac1–22p was exclusively confined to perinuclear and peripheral regions, and no punctate localization could be detected (Fig. 4 B). Essentially, the localization of EYFP-Sac1–22p was very similar to the one observed for Sec63p-ECFP with a slightly more pronounced peripheral localization of EYFP-Sac1–22p (Fig.4 B). This result strongly indicated that thesac1–22 mutation caused retention of the mutant protein in the ER. Because the point mutation in sac1–22 lies outside of the consensus region known to be essential for phosphatase activity (Fig. 3 B) (5Guo S. Stolz L.E. Lemrow S.M. York J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12990-12995Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar), the Sac1–22 mutant protein may therefore retain some catalytic activity. Such a residual activity may be sufficient for suppressing ER-specific defects in ATP transport because the retention of Sac1–22p in the ER should cause an increased level of the mutant protein in this organelle. To investigate this possibility directly, we purified a recombinant fragment of Sac1p containing either the entire wild-type Sac1 homology domain or the corresponding domain of Sac1–22p (Fig. 5 A). These purified soluble Sac1p fragments were then used to assay their respective phosphatase activity. Consistent"

We have shown previously that macrophage lipoprotein lipase expression is suppressed by interferon-γ (IFN-γ) at the transcriptional level. We investigated the regulatory sequence elements and the transcription factors that are involved in this response. We demonstrated that the −31/+187 sequence contains the minimal IFN-γ-responsive elements. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays showed that the binding of proteins to two regions in the −31/+187 sequence was reduced dramatically when the cells were exposed to IFN-γ. Both competition electrophoretic mobility shift assays and antibody supershift assays showed that the interacting proteins were composed of Sp1 and Sp3. Mutations of the Sp1/Sp3-binding sites in the minimal IFN-γ-responsive elements abolished the IFN-γ-mediated suppression of promoter activity, whereas multimers of the sequence were able to impart the response to a heterologous promoter. Western blot analysis showed that IFN-γ reduced the steady state levels of Sp3 protein. In contrast, the cytokine decreased the DNA binding activity of Sp1 without affecting the protein levels. These studies therefore reveal a novel mechanism for IFN-γ-mediated regulation of macrophage gene transcription.

Lipoprotein lipase (LPL 1The abbreviations used are: LPLlipoprotein lipaseC/EBPCCAAT/enhancer-binding proteinCK2casein kinase 2EMSAelectrophoretic mobility shift assayHI-FCSheat-inactivated fetal calf serumIFN-γinterferon-γIFN-γREsIFN-γ responsive elementsLDLlow density lipoproteinPMAphorbol 12-myristate 13-acetateTBSTris-buffered saline ; EC 3.1.1.34) plays a central role in lipid metabolism and transport by catalyzing the hydrolysis of the triacylglycerol component of lipoprotein particles, thereby providing non-esterified fatty acids and 2-monoacylglycerol for tissue utilization (1.Goldberg I.J. Merkel M. Front. Biosci. 2001; 6: 388-405Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). LPL is expressed by the parenchymal cells of several extrahepatic tissues and is subject to regulation in response to physiological and pathophysiological changes through the action of hormones, cytokines, and lipid metabolite products (2.Enerback S. Gimble J.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1168: 107-125Crossref Scopus (155) Google Scholar). The LPL expressed by macrophages is of major importance because of its crucial role in atherogenesis (see Ref. 3.Mead J.R. Cryer A. Ramji D.P. FEBS Lett. 1999; 462: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar for a recent review). LPL is expressed in the lesion where macrophage-derived foam cells represent the predominant site for the synthesis of the enzyme (4.Yla-Herttuala S. Lipton B.A. Rosenfeld M.E. Goldberg I.J.

Skamene E. DeSanctis J.B. Radzioch D. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1993; 13: 190-196Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). More recently, the importance of LPL in the promotion of foam cell formation and atherosclerosis in vivo has been substantiated by three independent transplantation studies in irradiated mouse model systems using donor macrophages from different backgrounds (7.Babaev V.R.

In those mice receiving macrophages from homozygous and heterozygous LPL-deficient donors, the mean lesion area of diet-induced atherosclerosis was reduced substantially compared with those receiving macrophages that express LPL normally (7.Babaev V.R.

Such an atherogenic role of LPL predominantly involves a non-catalytic bridging action in which the enzyme serves as a ligand for mediating the interaction of lipoproteins to cell surface receptors and/or proteoglycans and their subsequent uptake by the cells (3.Mead J.R. Cryer A. Ramji D.P.

The action of such factors on the expression of macrophage LPL has been implicated in the modulation of the atherosclerotic process (3.Mead J.R. Cryer A. Ramji D.P. FEBS Lett. 1999; 462: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) and has, therefore, been studied in detail in several laboratories including our own. Macrophage LPL expression is induced by platelet-derived growth factor, macrophage colony-stimulating factor, glucose, and activators of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors and is suppressed by certain cytokines (13.Inaba T. Kawamura M. Gotoda T. Harada K. Shimada M. Ohsuga J.-I. Shimano H. Akanuma Y. Yazaki Y. Yamada N. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1995; 15: 522-528Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14.Mori N.

Among these cytokines, interferon-γ (IFN-γ) possesses a unique ability both to prime macrophages and to synergize with other mediators in the regulation of LPL (18.Tengku-Muhammad T.S. Cryer A.

In addition, IFN-γ stimulates the expression of vascular cell adhesion molecule on endothelial cells and class II major histocompatibility antigens in macrophages and smooth muscle cells (21.Li H.

On the other hand, IFN-γ decreases collagen synthesis on smooth muscle cells, blocks smooth muscle cell proliferation, and inhibits macrophage foam cell formation by both preventing the oxidation of low density lipoproteins (LDL) and suppressing the expression of several lipoprotein receptors, including type A scavenger receptor, very low density lipoprotein receptor, LDL receptor-related protein, and scavenger receptor CD36 (23.Libby P.

Leukocyte Biol. 2000; 67: 97-103Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the light of the IFN-γ-mediated inhibition of the expression of several genes in macrophages that are involved in lipoprotein uptake, a detailed understanding is necessary of the mechanisms that are in operation. This will not only better our understanding of the molecular basis of foam cell formation and atherogenesis but, in the longer term, may also lead to the identification of novel targets for therapeutic intervention. With respect to macrophage LPL expression, we have demonstrated previously (31.Tengku-Muhammad T.S. Hughes T.R. Cryer A. Ramji D.P. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1998; 26: 12Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) that the IFN-γ action is mediated at the transcriptional level. We show here that IFN-γ decreases macrophage LPL gene transcription through a reduction in the binding of the transcription factor Sp1, and the related member Sp3, to the promoter region. In addition, we identify the potential mechanisms that are responsible for this action of IFN-γ on Sp1 and Sp3. The studies identify a novel mechanism for IFN-γ-regulated gene transcription. The human myeloid leukemic U937 and the mouse macrophage J774.2 cell lines were from the European Collection of Animal Cell Cultures, and the rat alveolar macrophage NR8383 cell line was obtained from the American Collection of Animal Cell Cultures. Recombinant human and mouse IFN-γ was from PeproTech. All the cell culture reagents were purchased from Greiner, Helena Biosciences, or Invitrogen. Antisera against Sp1 and Sp3 were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, and the secondary horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies and the casein kinase 2 (CK2) inhibitors apigenin and emodin were purchased from Sigma. The cell lines were maintained in either Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (J774.2), RPMI 1640 (U937), or Ham's F-12 medium (NR8383), which was supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (HI-FCS; 56 °C, 30 min), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. The cultures were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% (v/v) CO2 in air. Alveolar macrophages were isolated from in-house-bred adult male Sprague-Dawley rats by bronchoalveolar lavage (32.Yang H.M. Ma J.Y.C. Castranova V. Ma J.K.H. Exp. Lung Res. 1997; 23: 269-284Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33.Nicholson W.J. Slight J. Donaldson K. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1996; 15: 88-96Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Rats were sacrificed by a lethal injection of pentobarbital (50 mg/kg) via the intraperitoneal route. The capillary bed of the lungs was perfused with 0.15 m NaCl to remove the blood and the lungs excised intact. Then 10-ml aliquots of 0.15 mNaCl were used to lavage the lungs. This procedure was repeated five times, and the recovered material was pooled. The macrophages were collected by centrifugation of the lavage fluid at 250 ×g for 20 min at 10 °C. The resultant pellet was resuspended in RPMI 1640 that had been supplemented with HI-FCS, streptomycin, and penicillin, as above, and plated out onto tissue culture flasks. The homogeneity of alveolar macrophages was verified by morphological analysis. Before stimulation with IFN-γ, the cells were preincubated for 4 h in medium containing reduced (0.5%) HI-FCS (17.Tengku-Muhammad T.S. Hughes T.R. Cryer A. Ramji D.P. Cytokine. 1996; 8: 525-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 18.Tengku-Muhammad T.S. Cryer A. Ramji D.P.

For experiments involving the use of apigenin or emodin, the inhibitors were added to the cells 1 h before the addition of IFN-γ (i.e.pretreatment). The heparin-releasable LPL activity in conditioned medium was determined as described previously (17.Tengku-Muhammad T.S. Hughes T.R. Cryer A. Ramji D.P. Cytokine. 1996; 8: 525-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). For Northern blots, total RNA was prepared from cells using Tri-Reagent LS (Molecular Research Center) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Samples of RNA (15 μg) were size-fractionated by electrophoresis on denaturing agarose gels, transferred onto Hybond Nfp membranes (Amersham Biosciences), and hybridized to radiolabeled LPL or β-actin cDNA inserts, as described previously (17.Tengku-Muhammad T.S. Hughes T.R. Cryer A. Ramji D.P. Cytokine. 1996; 8: 525-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 18.Tengku-Muhammad T.S. Cryer A. Ramji D.P.

The deletion series, containing 5′-truncations of the LPL promoter that are linked to the luciferase reporter gene in the vector p19, were a generous gift from Dr. J. M. Gimble (34.Gimble J.M. Hua X. Wanker F. Morgan C. Robinson C. Hill M.R. Nadon N. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: E213-E218PubMed Google Scholar). The other LPL promoter-luciferase DNA constructs were prepared using PCR as described previously (35.Davies G.E. Sabatakos G. Cryer A. Ramji D.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 271: 346-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 36.Tura-Kockar F. Foka P. Hughes T.R. Kousteni S. Ramji D.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 362-372Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 37.Foka P. Kousteni S. Ramji D.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 285: 430-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The PCRs were carried out using the high fidelity Pwo DNA polymerase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) to minimize PCR-generated mutations, and this was confirmed by sequencing of all the products. To produce the −31/+187 promoter-luciferase DNA construct in the pGL2-Basic vector (38.Gacesa P. Ramji D.P. Vectors: Essential Data. John Wiley and Sons, Chichester, UK1994Google Scholar), the corresponding LPL promoter construct in p19 (34.Gimble J.M. Hua X. Wanker F. Morgan C. Robinson C. Hill M.R. Nadon N. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: E213-E218PubMed Google Scholar) was used as a template for PCR using primers F and R that had the XbaI or the XhoI sites included at the 5′ and 3′ ends, respectively (5′-TCCCACCCGGGGTCACTTAAACAGC-3′ and 5′-CCCTTCTCGAGCTGCTTTGCTGCT-3′, respectively, with the restriction sites shown in bold type). The amplification product was purified, digested with XbaI and XhoI, and subcloned into the pGL2-Basic vector (38.Gacesa P. Ramji D.P. Vectors: Essential Data. John Wiley and Sons, Chichester, UK1994Google Scholar). This recombinant plasmid was then used to prepare mutations in the three Sp1 sites using the overlap extension method (36.Tura-Kockar F. Foka P. Hughes T.R. Kousteni S. Ramji D.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 362-372Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 39.Jones P. Jones P. Vectors: Cloning Applications. John Wiley and Sons, Chichester, UK1998: 122-142Google Scholar). The mutations produced were those of the Sp1 site from +44 to +51 in the antisense strand (GGGCAG; Sp1M44), double mutations of the overlapping Sp1 sites from +62 to +67 in the antisense strand (GGGCAG), +65 to +71 in the sense strand (CCCTCCC) (Sp1M62/65), and mutations of all three sites (Sp1M44/62/65). The Sp1M44 and Sp1M62/65 were prepared initially, and the latter was then used as a template to produce the triple Sp1 mutant (Sp1M44/62/65). The oligonucleotide primers used to generate these mutations were as follows, in which the mutated bases are shown in bold type: 5′-GAGGAATTTTGTTTCCTGTAA-3′ (Sp1M44F) and 5′-ACAGTTACAGGAAACAAAATTCC-3′ (Sp1M44R), and 5′-GTAACTGTTCTGAAATAAACTTTAAA-3′ (Sp1M62/65F) and 5′-GTCAACCTTTAAAGTTTATTTCAGAACA-3′ (Sp1M62/65R). These primers were used in conjunction with primers F and R detailed above. The PCR products were subcloned into the pGL2-Basic vector (38.Gacesa P. Ramji D.P. Vectors: Essential Data. John Wiley and Sons, Chichester, UK1994Google Scholar) as described above. For the preparation of DNA constructs containing four copies of the Sp1 sites at position +44 to +51 and +62 to +71, or the +38 to the +75 region, that are all linked to a heterologous minimal SV40 promoter in the pGL2-promoter vector (38.Gacesa P. Ramji D.P. Vectors: Essential Data. John Wiley and Sons, Chichester, UK1994Google Scholar), the following oligonucleotides were synthesized: 5′-CCGGAATTCTGCCCCCTGTAACTGTTCTGCCCTCCCCTTT-3′ and 5′-TCGAAAAGGGGAGGGCAGAACAGTTACAGGGGGCAGAAT-3′ for p+38/+75; 5′-CCGGAATTCTGCCCCCTGAATTCTGCCCCCTGAATTCTGCCCCCTGAATTCTGCCCCCTG-3′ and 5′-TCGACAGGGGGCAGAATTCAGGGGGCAGAATTCAGGGGGCAGAATTCAGGGGGCAGAATT-3′ for the pSp1+44x4 construct; and 5′-CCGGTGTTCTGCCCTCCCCTTTTGTTCTGCCCTCCCCTTTTGTTCTGCCCTCCCCTTTTGTTCTGCCCTCCCCTTT-3′ and 5′-TCGAAAAGGGGAGGGCAGAACAAAAGGGGAGGGCAGAACAAAAGGGGAGGGCAGAACAAAAGGGGAGGGCAGAACA-3′ for the construct pSp1+62/+65x4. These were designed in such a manner that, following annealing, they had overhangs that allowed their direct cloning into the XbaI and XhoI sites of the pGL2 promoter vector (36.Tura-Kockar F. Foka P. Hughes T.R. Kousteni S. Ramji D.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 362-372Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). U937 cells from the third to the seventh passage were transfected with recombinant plasmid DNA using SuperfectTM (Qiagen). A day before transfection, the cells were harvested by centrifugation (1000 × g for 5 min), resuspended in fresh medium, and plated out at a density of 3 × 105/ml. On the day of the transfection, these cells were centrifuged as above, resuspended in RPMI containing only 3% (v/v) HI-FCS, subcultured into 6-well plates at a density of 1 × 106 cells per well, and incubated for 4 h. Complexes of DNA, containing 2 μg of appropriate LPL promoter-luciferase DNA construct and 0.5 μg of cytomegalovirus-β-galactosidase plasmid as an internal control for transfection efficiency (35.Davies G.E. Sabatakos G. Cryer A. Ramji D.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 271: 346-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 36.Tura-Kockar F. Foka P. Hughes T.R. Kousteni S. Ramji D.P.

Commun. 2001; 285: 430-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), and 8 μl of SuperfectTM were then prepared as described by the manufacturer and added to the cells. These were then differentiated into macrophages for 12 h using phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA; 1 μm) as the differentiation agent, either in the absence or the presence of IFN-γ (1,000 units/ml). The luciferase and the β-galactosidase activities in the cell extracts were then determined using commercially available kits (Promega). The luciferase activity was normalized to the β-galactosidase values (35.Davies G.E. Sabatakos G. Cryer A. Ramji D.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 271: 346-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 36.Tura-Kockar F. Foka P. Hughes T.R. Kousteni S. Ramji D.P.

Commun. 2001; 285: 430-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), with each transfection being carried out in triplicate and repeated at least three times. Nuclear and whole cell extracts were prepared essentially as described previously (36.Tura-Kockar F. Foka P. Hughes T.R. Kousteni S. Ramji D.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 362-372Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 40.Ramji D.P. Vitelli A. Tronche F. Cortese R. Ciliberto G.

Protease inhibitors (0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml I-S soybean trypsin inhibitor) and dithiothreitol (0.5 mm) were added to all the buffers before use. The concentration of proteins in the extracts was determined using the microBCA protein assay kit as described by the manufacturer (Pierce). Samples (10 μg) were size-fractionated using 7.5% (w/v) polyacrylamide gels, containing SDS under reducing conditions, and transferred by blotting to Immobilon-P polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore) (17.Tengku-Muhammad T.S. Hughes T.R. Cryer A. Ramji D.P. Cytokine. 1996; 8: 525-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 40.Ramji D.P. Vitelli A. Tronche F. Cortese R. Ciliberto G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 289-294Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Blotted membranes were first incubated for 1 h at room temperature in 10% (w/v) non-fat milk powder to reduce any nonspecific interaction of the antisera with the membrane. Following washing with TBS-Tween (1% v/v), the membrane was incubated with the primary antibody for 30 min in 0.5% (w/v) non-fat milk powder/TBS-Tween (0.1% v/v). After another wash with TBS-Tween, the membrane was incubated, as above, with secondary horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies (anti-rabbit or goat immunoglobulin) for 30 min at room temperature. After washing once more with TBS-Tween, the membranes were developed using an enhanced chemiluminescence detection kit (Amersham Biosciences) and XAR-sensitive film (Eastman Kodak). The sizes of the proteins were determined by comparison with Rainbow molecular weight markers (Amersham Biosciences) that had been subjected to electrophoresis and blotting on the same gel as the test samples. EMSA were carried out essentially as reported previously (36.Tura-Kockar F. Foka P. Hughes T.R. Kousteni S. Ramji D.P.

The oligonucleotides were radiolabeled by “fill-in” reactions using [α-32P]dCTP and Klenow DNA polymerase. Nuclear and whole cell extracts were prepared as described previously (36.Tura-Kockar F.

Then 5–20 μg of whole cell extracts or 4 μg of nuclear extracts were incubated in a total reaction volume of 20 μl containing 34 mm potassium chloride, 5 mm magnesium chloride, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, and 3 μg of poly(dI-dC). After 10 min on ice, 32P-labeled probes (50,000 cpm) were added, and the incubation was continued for 30 min at room temperature. Following the addition of 5 μl of a 20% (w/v) Ficoll solution to each sample, the free probe and the DNA-protein complexes were resolved on 4% (w/v) polyacrylamide gels in 0.5× TBE (45 mm Tris base, 45 mm boric acid, 1 mm EDTA). The gels were then dried under vacuum and exposed to x-ray film. For antibody supershift assays, samples of nuclear or whole cell extracts were incubated with the appropriate antiserum for 30 min on ice prior to the addition of the radiolabeled probe (36.Tura-Kockar F.

https://openalex.org/W2079268365,"Nuclear import of many cellular and viral proteins is mediated by short nuclear localization signals (NLS) that are recognized by intracellular receptor proteins belonging to the importin/karyopherin α and β families. The primary structure of NLS is not well defined, but most contain at least three basic amino acids and harbor the relative consensus sequence K(K/R) X(K/R). We have studied the nuclear import of the Borna disease virus p10 protein that lacks a canonical oligobasic NLS. It is shown that the p10 protein exhibits all characteristics of an actively transported molecule in digitonin-permeabilized cells. Import activity was found to reside in the 20 N-terminal p10 amino acids that are devoid of an NLS consensus motif. Unexpectedly, p10-dependent import was blocked by a peptide inhibitor of importin α-dependent nuclear translocation, and the transport activity of the p10 N-terminal domain was shown to correlate with the ability to bind to importin α. These findings suggest that nuclear import of the Borna disease virus p10 protein occurs through a nonconventional karyophilic signal and highlight that the cellular importin α NLS receptor proteins can recognize nuclear targeting signals that substantially deviate from the consensus sequence.

The prototypes of such topogenic sequences were identified as 126PKKKRKV132 in the T antigen of the simian virus 40 (SV40) and as155KRPAATKKAGQAKKKK170 in the cellular nucleoplasmin. Despite their oligobasic character, there is considerable variation in the primary sequences of these “classical” NLSs, and the context in which these signals are embedded is also important for their function (8.Dang C.V.

Therefore, only a relative consensus motif has been formulated as “K(K/R) X(K/R)” for monopartite NLSs since they usually contain at least three basic amino acids (9.Chelsky D. Ralph R. Jonak G. Mol.

Haller H. Gorlich D. Hartmann E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7782-7791Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Importin α heterodimerizes through its N-terminal domain with the 97-kDa protein importin β (also known as karyopherin β) whereby its affinity for the NLS is increased (15.Weis K. Ryder U. Lamond A.I. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1818-1825Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 16.Rexach M. Blobel G. Cell. 1995; 83: 683-692Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar, 17.Radu A.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1810-1817Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). The receptor-cargo complex first binds through importin β to components of the nuclear pore complex (NPC) and is then transported through the nuclear envelope (19.Moroianu J. Hijikata M. Blobel G. Radu A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6532-6536Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 20.Gorlich D. Kostka S. Kraft R. Dingwall C. Laskey R.A. Hartmann E. Prehn S. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 383-392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). Mechanistically, the translocation process has been proposed to be driven either by sequential interactions of increasing affinity of importin β with different nucleoporins along the central channel of the NPC or, alternatively, by the hypothetical ability of transport receptors to penetrate a hydrophobic meshwork composed by nucleoporins (21.Ribbeck K. Gorlich D. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1320-1330Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar, 22.Ben-Efraim I. Gerace L. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 411-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Nuclear import is completed by binding of the Ras-related nuclear protein in its GTP-bound form to importin β which results in the disassembly of the receptor cargo complex in the nucleus (16.Rexach M. Blobel G. Cell. 1995; 83: 683-692Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar,23.Gorlich D. Pante N. Kutay U. Aebi U. Bischoff F.R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5584-5594Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar). Several recent studies (summarized in Ref. 1.Gorlich D. Kutay U. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 607-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (1663) Google Scholar) have shown that nuclear import of various proteins is mediated via an importin α-independent mechanism. The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 Rev and Tat proteins exemplify factors that interact directly with importin β via a highly basic importin β binding domain which then mediates import without the necessity of the NLS receptor subunit (24.Henderson B.R. Percipalle P. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 274: 693-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 25.Truant R. Cullen B.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1210-1217Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, a karyophilic signal has been described for import of heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) A1 that is imported through interaction with the importin β homologue transportin (26.Pollard V.W. Michael W.M. Nakielny S. Siomi M.C. Wang F. Dreyfuss G. Cell. 1996; 86: 985-994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar). The recognition site for transportin in hnRNP A1 is the glycine-rich 38-amino acid M9 domain (27.Michael W.M. Choi M. Dreyfuss G. Cell. 1995; 83: 415-422Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar, 28.Bogerd H.P. Benson R.E. Truant R. Herold A. Phingbodhipakkiya M. Cullen B.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9771-9777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Interestingly, a given nuclear protein may not depend on a single transport receptor as suggested by the finding that import of some ribosomal proteins is mediated by binding to either importin β or the importin β-like receptors transportin, RanBP5, or RanBP7 through very basic β-like import receptor binding domains (29.Jakel S. Gorlich D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4491-4502Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). Finally, other nuclear proteins have been identified that bear nuclear targeting sequences that do not resemble any of the signals mentioned above (30.Standiford D.M. Richter J.D. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 991-1002Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 31.Smith M.R. Greene W.C. Virology. 1992; 187: 316-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). It is currently not known if this indicates the existence of alternative import receptors that remain to be discovered or if this reflects a high variability of the sequences that can be recognized by the characterized importins (32.Christophe D. Christophe-Hobertus C. Pichon B. Cell. Signal. 2000; 12: 337-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). The p10 protein is the most recently identified distinct gene product of the Borna Disease Virus (BDV) that is unique among the non-segmented negative strand RNA viruses (order Mononegavirales) of animals and man, because it replicates in the nuclear compartment (33.Briese T. de la Torre J.C. Lewis A. Ludwig H. Lipkin W.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11486-11489Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 34.Cubitt B. de la Torre J.C. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 1371-1381Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The precise function of this 10-kDa protein in the viral replication cycle is currently unknown. However, we have recently demonstrated (35.Wehner T. Ruppert A. Herden C. Frese K. Becht H. Richt J.A. J. Gen. Virol. 1997; 78: 2459-2466Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 36.Wolff T. Pfleger R. Wehner T. Reinhardt J. Richt J.A. J. Gen. Virol. 2000; 81: 939-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) that the p10 protein interacts with and is localized in the nuclear compartment of infected cells together with the viral N and P proteins that are expected to be essential components of the viral replicative ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex. Conceivable roles of the p10 protein that require its nuclear import may therefore involve regulatory functions during viral RNA synthesis, splicing, and/or the intracellular trafficking of viral RNP. Because the primary sequence of the p10 protein lacks a recognizable nuclear targeting signal, it was proposed previously (37.Malik T.H. Kobayashi T. Ghosh M. Kishi M. Lai P.K. Virology. 1999; 258: 65-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 38.Schwemmle M. Salvatore M. Shi L. Richt J. Lee C.H. Lipkin W.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9007-9012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 39.Shoya Y. Kobayashi T. Koda T. Ikuta K. Kakinuma M. Kishi M. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 9755-9762Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that the p10 protein enters the nucleus only in the presence of the viral karyophilic N or P proteins. However, here we demonstrate that the p10 protein exhibits all the characteristics of an actively transported karyophilic protein in digitonin-permeabilized cells, which indicates that it carries an autonomous nuclear targeting signal. Import activity was found to reside within the 20 N-terminal p10 amino acids (1MSSDLRLTLLELVRRLNGNG20) and, surprisingly, to correlate with the ability of this domain to bind directly to the NLS receptor protein importin α. Di-alanine scanning identified several basic, hydrophobic, and polar amino acids within this domain as critical for this interaction. These results suggest that import of p10 occurs via the importin α/β-mediated pathway despite the unusual targeting signal. A human oligodendrocyte cell line (“Oligo”) and human Huh-7 cells were maintained and passaged in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's tissue culture medium (DMEM) containing 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) and 2 mml-glutamine. E. coli strains used for cloning and expression were DH5α (F− Φ80dlacZΔM15 Δ(lacZYA -argF)U 169 deoR recA1 endA1hsdR17(rK−mK+) supE44 λ− thi-1 gyrA96relA1) and BL26 (F− ompT hsdSB (rB−mB−) gal dcm). The plasmids pGEX-p10, pGEX-p10-(1–20), pcDNA-p10-Myc, pGEX-UL56c, and pRSET-hSRP1α have been described previously (13.Weis K. Mattaj I.W. Lamond A.I. Science. 1995; 268: 1049-1053Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar, 36.Wolff T. Pfleger R. Wehner T. Reinhardt J. Richt J.A. J. Gen.

Construction of plasmids followed standard cloning procedures (41.Ausubel F.M. Brent R.E. Kingston D.D. Moore J.G. Seidman J.A. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1992: 3.16.1-3.16.11Google Scholar). p10 cDNA was amplified and subcloned between the EcoRI/XhoI sites of pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) to obtain a vector expressing BDV p10 protein in mammalian cells. Within this construct, the internal ATG codon in the p10 gene that initiates translation of the overlapping p24 reading frame was inactivated by site-directed mutagenesis without alteration to the derived p10 amino acid sequence resulting in pcDNA-p10. pGEX-p10-(21–87) and pGEX-p10-(41–87) were constructed by subcloning corresponding p10 cDNAs between the EcoRI/XhoI sites of pGEX-5X-1 (Amersham Biosciences). The pGEX-p10 plasmids expressing derivatives of the p10 protein with amino acid replacements were constructed by site-directed mutagenesis using a Quikchange kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). All plasmids were confirmed by DNA sequencing using a cycle sequencing protocol followed by analysis through an automated DNA sequencer ABI 377 (Applied Biosystems, Inc., Foster City, CA). Solitary p10 protein was expressed by transfection of 5 μg of pcDNA-p10 in oligodendrocyte cells using LipofectAMINE 2000 reagent (Invitrogen). The transfected cells were seeded on glass coverslips in DMEM, 10% FCS and were incubated at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Cells were processed for analysis by confocal laser scanning microscopy after 24 h through fixation in 2.5% methanol-free formaldehyde (Polysciences Inc., Warrington, PA), and permeabilization of cells in 0.2% Triton X-100 was done as described (42.Wolff T. O'Neill R.E. Palese P. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 7170-7180Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were stained with rat anti-GST-p10 serum (36.Wolff T. Pfleger R. Wehner T. Reinhardt J. Richt J.A. J. Gen. Virol. 2000; 81: 939-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) diluted in PBS, 3% BSA (1:400). The cells were washed and incubated with FITC-conjugated donkey anti-rat IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories Inc., West Grove, PA). Subsequently, the samples were mounted in MOWIOL 4-88 and analyzed by using a 63×/1.2 objective and a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal imaging system. The p10 wild type and mutant proteins were expressed as glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins in E. coli and purified by affinity chromatography on glutathione-agarose (36.Wolff T. Pfleger R. Wehner T. Reinhardt J. Richt J.A. J. Gen. Virol. 2000; 81: 939-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The fusion proteins were eluted from the resin by incubation with elution buffer (30 mm glutathione, 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 2%n-octyl glucoside) and dialyzed against Na2CO3. For direct fluorescence detection, the GST proteins were reacted with FluoroLink Cy3 reagent (Amersham Biosciences) and were subsequently purified by gel chromatography on a PD10 column (Amersham Biosciences AB) and concentrated in a Centricon 10 (Amicon Inc., Beverly, MA) ultrafiltration device. Preparation of FITC-labeled BSA-conjugated to SV40 T antigen (Tag) NLS-derived peptide has been described elsewhere (43.Kann M. Sodeik B. Vlachou A. Gerlich W.H. Helenius A. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 45-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Cells were grown in DMEM, 7% FCS on collagen- (Sigma) or Cell-Tak (Becton Dickinson)-coated 12-mm coverslips in 24-well dishes at 37 °C and 5% CO2. The cells were washed with DMEM and permeabilized by treatment with 80 μg/ml digitonin (Sigma) in DMEM for 10 min at 37 °C. They were washed three times for 10 min at 4 °C in washing buffer (transport buffer, 2 mm magnesium acetate, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.3, 110 mm potassium acetate, 1 mm EGTA, 5 mm sodium acetate, 1 mm dithiothreitol containing 1% BSA and 10% goat serum), followed by a 10-min incubation at 37 °C in washing buffer. Preincubation of permeabilized cells with 50 μg/ml wheat germ agglutinin (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) in transport buffer was performed during this step. Permeabilized cells were incubated with similar amounts of fluorescently labeled protein (all showing approximately the same protein:fluorophore ratio) in 20 μl of transport buffer containing 24 mg/ml rabbit reticulocyte lysate (Promega, Madison, WI), 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml pepstatin (all from Sigma) for 20 min at 37 °C. For competition experiments, peptides derived from the SV40 T antigen (PKKKRKVED) or the hnRNP A1 M9 domain (YNNQSSNFGPMK) were added to final concentrations up to 1 mm. In these experiments, the FITC-BSA SV40 Tag-NLS and FITC-BSA M9 conjugates were used in a final concentration of 10 μg/ml as internal controls. If required, an ATP-generating system (1 mm ATP, 5 mm creatine phosphate, and 20 units/ml creatine phosphokinase (Sigma)) or an ATP/GTP-depleting system (7 mm glucose, 1 units/ml hexokinase (Sigma)) was added (44.Adam S.A. Marr R.S. Gerace L. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 807-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (767) Google Scholar). Cells were fixed for microscopic analysis on the coverslips using 3% paraformaldehyde in PBS and permeabilization in PBS, 0.1% Triton X-100. After two washings in PBS, cells were exposed to an anti-NPC antibody (1:500; Babco, Richmond, CA) diluted in PBS, 10% goat serum, 1% BSA. Coverslips were washed in PBS and incubated with affinity-purified FITC-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Dianova, Hamburg, Germany) diluted in PBS, 10% goat serum, 1% BSA. Cells were washed and embedded in MOWIOL as described above. Confocal laser scanning microscopy was performed on a Leica DM IRBE microscope. Analysis of Cy3-labeled GST fusion proteins and peptide conjugates was done by using the TRITC and FITC fittings at a pinhole size of 1. The BDV p10 protein or mutant derivatives thereof were expressed from pGEX-p10 plasmids as GST fusion proteins in E. coli BL26. Synthesis of GST fusion proteins was induced by addition of 0.5 mmisopropyl-β-d-galactopyranoside. Bacterial cell lysates containing GST fusion proteins were adsorbed to glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences AB) according to the protocol supplied by the manufacturer, and contaminating proteins were removed by three washes with PBS. Full-length and truncated (amino acids 65–529) human importin α1 (also called hSRP1α) were synthesized and labeled with [35S]methionine in coupled 100 μl of TNT transcription/translation reactions (Promega) programmed with pRSET-hSRP1α and pKW313, respectively (kind gifts of K. Weis, University of California, San Francisco). Aliquots of the translation reactions or 1 μg of purified recombinant importin α1 (a kind gift of D. Görlich, University Heidelberg, Germany) were incubated overnight at 4 °C with 20 μl of coated glutathione-Sepharose beads in 1 ml of binding buffer (50 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% BSA). The beads were washed three times with binding buffer, and the precipitated proteins were separated by SDS-gel electrophoresis and visualized by autoradiography. Recombinant importin α1 was detected by immunoblotting using affinity-purified rabbit importin α-specific antibodies (a kind gift of M. Köhler, Max-Delbrück Centrum, Berlin, Germany) and secondary horseradish peroxidase-conjugated swine anti-rabbit IgG antibody (Dako Diagnostika, Hamburg, Germany). Quantification of precipitated proteins was performed with a Fujifilm FLA-2000 Bioimaging System and the Image Gauge version 3.0 software (Fuji Photo Film Co, Ltd.). BDV p10-Myc protein was expressed in oligodendrocyte cells by transfection with 4 μg of pcDNA-p10-Myc plasmid per 35-mm dish using LipofectAMINE 2000 reagent. Cytoplasmic extracts of transfected and non-transfected cells were prepared after 24 h by incubation in hypotonic buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mmEDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 1 mm DTT, 0.5 mmPefabloc (Roche Molecular Biochemicals)) for 15 min on ice followed by 10 passages through a syringe attached to a 26-gauge needle. The nuclei in the homogenate were pelleted by a 5-min centrifugation at 5,000 rpm and 4 °C in a tabletop centrifuge. The supernatant was cleared by another centrifugation at 14,000 rpm and was adjusted to 100 mm NaCl and 100 μg/ml BSA for use in subsequent experiments. Extracts equivalent to 5 × 106transfected and non-transfected cells, respectively, were incubated with the Myc tag-specific monoclonal antibody 9E10 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) at 0 °C. Immune complexes were collected by incubation with 20 μl of protein G-agarose beads (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The beads were washed three times with binding buffer, and the precipitated proteins were analyzed by immunoblotting using primary anti-importin α1-specific rabbit antibodies as described above. We have demonstrated previously that the BDV p10 protein localizes to the nucleus in persistently BDV-infected cells (35.Wehner T. Ruppert A. Herden C. Frese K. Becht H. Richt J.A. J. Gen. Virol. 1997; 78: 2459-2466Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Based on the absence of a recognizable NLS and its interaction with the karyophilic viral P protein, nuclear entry of p10 has been suggested previously to rely on other viral proteins (38.Schwemmle M. Salvatore M. Shi L. Richt J. Lee C.H. Lipkin W.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9007-9012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 45.Malik T.H. Kishi M. Lai P.K. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 3413-3417Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). However, when expressed in the absence of other viral gene products, we detected the p10 protein both in the nucleus and the cytoplasm (Fig. 1). Thus, it was demonstrated that the p10 protein can enter the nucleus without the requirement for other virus-encoded proteins. However, this approach did not distinguish whether nuclear entry of p10 was facilitated by other factors or if it occurred by diffusion because its molecular weight is below the 40–50-kDa exclusion limit of the nuclear pore (46.Davis L.I. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 865-896Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). To determine whether the BDV p10 protein contains a signal(s) that mediates nuclear import, we studied its karyophilic properties in digitonin-permeabilized mammalian cells, an established system for studying nuclear transport of proteins (44.Adam S.A. Marr R.S. Gerace L. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 807-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (767) Google Scholar). The p10 protein was expressed as a GST fusion protein in E. coli and was purified by affinity chromatography to near-homogeneity. For direct fluorescence detection, we covalently coupled GST proteins to a Cyanine dye 3 (Cy3) fluorophore. Fluorescently Cy3-labeled p10 fusion protein was incubated with the permeabilized cells at 37 °C in the presence of cytosolic extract and an ATP energy source. The cells were subsequently stained with an anti-nuclear pore complex antibody (43.Kann M. Sodeik B. Vlachou A. Gerlich W.H. Helenius A. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 45-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar) and examined by confocal microscopy (Fig. 2). The p10 fusion protein accumulated in the nucleus within 20 min (Fig. 2, left panel, column GST-p10 wt). This nuclear accumulation was specific because GST alone was not appreciably imported under identical conditions (Fig. 2, column GST). Import of GST-p10 did not occur in the absence of cytosolic factors or under concomitant incubation with an ATP-depleting system or at 0 °C (Fig. 2, right panels, columns −cytosol, −ATP, and +ATP, 0 °C). In addition, nuclear accumulation of p10 was inhibited after preincubation of the permeabilized cells with the lectin wheat germ agglutinin (Fig. 2, column +ATP+WGA), which is known to interfere with transport through the NPC (47.Adam E.J. Adam S.A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 547-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). These findings imply that nuclear migration of p10 depends on soluble cytosolic factors and the presence of energy for recycling of these factors. They therefore rule out a merely diffusion-driven mechanism of combined nuclear entry and retention and suggest that nuclear migration of the p10 protein occurs by an active transport mechanism through the nuclear pores. To determine the karyophilic signal within p10, we prepared Cy3-labeled GST fusion proteins containing BDV amino acids 1–20, 21–87, and 41–87. It was found that p10 amino acids 1–20 could direct nuclear import, whereas fusion proteins carrying amino acids 21–87 or 41–87 did not (Fig. 2, columns GST-p10 21–87, GST-p10 1–20, and data not shown). Thus, the p10 protein harbors a karyophilic signal within its 20 N-terminal amino acids (1MSSDLRLTLLELVRRLNGNG20). The activity of this domain in nuclear transport was unexpected, because the corresponding sequence does not contain a consensus motif of mono- or bipartite oligobasic NLSs nor does it resemble other known nuclear targeting signals like the M9 sequence. This suggested that the p10 protein either interacts with known transport receptors through an unusual signal or that import of p10 is mediated by a novel cytosolic factor(s) that recognizes a previously unknown karyophilic signal. We wished to determine whether import of the p10 protein follows an established or a previously unrecognized pathway. The best characterized nuclear import pathway of proteins is mediated via the importin α/β heterodimer. Because transport via this route is a saturable process, we used a competition approach to examine if import of p10 depended on the same factors as of proteins carrying oligobasic NLS. These experiments revealed that transport of both recombinant p10 protein and a conjugate of bovine serum albumin with a peptide derived from the classical SV40 Tag-NLS was concomitantly inhibited after preincubation of the cytosolic factors with SV40 Tag-NLS peptide up to 1 mm(Fig. 3). In contrast, the transport of neither substrate was inhibited when 1 mm of a peptide derived from the M9 domain of hnRNP A1 protein was added to the extract (Fig. 3). This indicated that nuclear transport of the p10 protein is mediated by the importin α and β proteins despite the low similarity of the p10 signal with oligobasic NLSs. If import of the p10 protein occurred through the importin α-dependent pathway, it was expected to bind to the cellular NLS receptor protein. To examine this prediction, we immobilized GST-p10 fusion protein on glutathione-agarose beads and analyzed for binding to importin α1 (also termed Rch1 and hSRP1α) that was synthesized and labeled by translation in the presence of [35S]methionine in vitro.

We proposed that the I domain of the integrin lymphocyte function-associated antigen 1 (LFA-1) could exist in both open and closed conformations and generated constitutively activated LFA-1 by locking the I domain in the open conformation. Here we provide structural and biochemical evidence to validate conformational change in the I domain of LFA-1 upon activation. Two monoclonal antibodies to αL, HI111 and CBR LFA-1/1, bind wild-type LFA-1 well, but their binding is significantly reduced when LFA-1 is locked in the open conformation. Furthermore, this reduction in monoclonal antibody binding also occurs when LFA-1 is activated by divalent cations. HI111 maps to the top region of the I domain that is close to the putative ligand-binding site surrounding the MIDAS (metal ion-dependent adhesion site). The epitope of CBR LFA-1/1 is at the C-terminal segment of the I domain that links to the β-propeller, and undergoes a large movement between the open and closed conformations. Our data demonstrate that these two regions undergo significant conformational changes during LFA-1 activation and that the I domain of activated LFA-1 adopts a similar tertiary structure as the predicted locked open form.

LFA-1 plays an important role in inflammatory and immune responses by regulating cell adhesion and leukocyte trafficking. The cell surface ligands for LFA-1 are members of the Ig superfamily, including intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1), ICAM-2, and ICAM-3 (1Larson R.S. Springer T.A. Immunol.

Signals from the cytoplasm (inside-out) activate LFA-1 enabling it to bind ligands. Subsequent binding to ligands on the cell surface results in signal transduction to the cytoplasm (outside-in) (4Schwartz M.A. Schaller M.D. Ginsberg M.H. Ann. Rev. Cell Dev.

Similar to other integrin α subunits, αL has a complex domain structure that includes a large extracellular domain, a single transmembrane region, and a short cytoplasmic tail (11Humphries M.J.

The I domain of αL is sufficient for maximal ligand binding affinity and adhesiveness (14Lu C. Shimaoka M. Ferzly M. Oxvig C. Takagi J. Springer T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Although both receptor clustering in the cell membrane (avidity) and receptor conformational change (affinity) are proposed to contribute to integrin activation, there is increasing evidence that conformational change in the I domain represents a key step in the activation of integrins (14Lu C.

Rieu P. Arnaout M.A. Liddington R. Cell. 1995; 80: 631-638Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (792) Google Scholar, 17Lee J.-O. Bankston L.A. Arnaout M.A. Liddington R.C.

Cell. 2000; 101: 47-56Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (818) Google Scholar). The open conformations crystallized with a ligand-like lattice contact or a ligand bound at the MIDAS. However, structures have been determined for the I domain of αL only in the closed conformation (25Qu A. Leahy D.J. Structure. 1996; 4: 931-942Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 26Kallen J. Welzenbach K. Ramage P. Geyl D. Kriwacki R. Legge G. Cottens S. Weitz-Schmidt G. Hommel U.

Moreover, correlation of the observed conformational states in isolated crystallized LFA-1 I domains with cell surface expressed LFA-1 is lacking. Recently, we have designed mutants of the αL I domain stabilized in the open or closed conformation with disulfide bonds. Locking the I domain open resulted in a dramatic increase in affinity for ICAM-1, which can be reversed by disulfide reduction. In contrast, the closed form abolished adhesion (14Lu C. Shimaoka M.

Here, we provide structural and biochemical evidence to validate the conformational changes predicted by the locked open model. Two αL mAbs, CBR LFA-1/1 and HI111, were identified as activation-sensitive. Both of them favor the closed or inactivated conformation of αL. When LFA-1 is locked in the open conformation or activated by divalent cations, binding of both antibodies is reduced. The epitopes of HI111 and CBRLFA-1/1 are mapped on top of the I domain and within the C-terminal region of the I domain, respectively. These two regions shift significantly when the locked-open model is compared with the structure of the closed I domain structure. The data not only support our predicted open conformation model, but also provide direct evidence that conformational change is critical during LFA-1 activation. The human and mouse chimeric αL mutants were named as described previously (28Huang C. Springer T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19008-19016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The K562 stable cell lines were characterized previously (14Lu C. Shimaoka M. Ferzly M. Oxvig C.

HI111 is a mouse anti-human αL mAb (PharMingen) and was characterized in the Fourth International Leukocyte Workshop as IV N231 (29Knapp W. Dörken B. Gilks W.R. Rieber E.P. Schmidt R.E. Stein H. von dem Borne A.E.G.K. Leucocyte Typing IV: White Cell Differentiation Antigens. Oxford University Press, Oxford1989Google Scholar). Flow cytometry analysis was done as described previously (30Lu C. Springer T.A. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 268-278PubMed Google Scholar). Purified mAbs, TS1/18, TS2/4, TS2/6, TS1/22, CBR LFA-1/1, and HI111, were used at 10 μg/ml. Surface plasmon resonance with a BIAcore instrument was used to measure the affinity of mAbs to the isolated I domain. HI111 or activation-insensitive mAb MEM83 were covalently immobilized to the dextran surface of CM5 sensor chips by an amine-coupling kit (BIAcore, Piscataway, NJ), and assays were performed as described previously (15Shimaoka M. Lu C. Palframan R. von Andrian U.H. Takagi J. Springer T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6009-6014Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Soluble forms of wild-type or locked open αL I domains was flowed over the sensor chip at 10 μl/ml. HEPES-buffered saline (pH 7.4) containing 0.005% surfactant P20 (BIAcore) was used as running buffer. Kinetic constants k on andk off were obtained by curve fitting using a 1:1 binding model and BIA evaluation 3.0 software. K Dwas calculated ask off/k on. The model of the locked open LFA-1 I domain was built as described previously (15Shimaoka M. Lu C. Palframan R. von Andrian U.H. Takagi J. Springer T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6009-6014Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Superposition of the model onto the crystal structure of the closed I domain (Protein Data Bank number 1zon) was done with 166 Cα atoms with a root mean square deviation of 0.93 Å. We have previously introduced disulfide bonds into the I domain of αL to generate constitutively active (open) or inactive (closed) conformations (14Lu C. Shimaoka M. Ferzly M. Oxvig C. Takagi J. Springer T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2387-2392Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). A panel of antibodies mapped to various regions of αL, including 10 mAbs to the I domain, was previously tested by our laboratory for binding to these mutants (24Lu C. Shimaoka M. Zang Q. Takagi J. Springer T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2393-2398Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). All of the antibodies tested bound equally well to wild-type and mutant LFA-1, with the exception of mAb CBR LFA-1/1. The binding of mAb CBR LFA-1/1 to the open conformation was reduced compared with wild-type or locked closed LFA-1. We confirmed these results with K562 cells expressing wild-type, locked open, and locked closed LFA-1 (Fig.1). Furthermore, we identified another anti-αL antibody, HI111, that behaved similarly to CBR LFA-1/1. Both HI111 and CBR LFA-1/1 mAbs bound equally well to wild-type and locked closed LFA-1, but the binding of HI111 and CBR LFA-1/1 to the locked open LFA-1 was reduced to about 40–50% of the wild-type. The difference was not attributable to lower expression of open LFA-1, because all other αL antibodies, including TS2/6 and TS1/22, demonstrated similar reactivity to wild-type and the locked open and closed mutants (Fig. 1). To further investigate whether reduced binding of the mAbs is due to conformational change within the open I domain, the mAbs were tested for binding to the αL I domain (residues 130–338) expressed in isolation from other integrin domains on the cell surface using a platelet-derived growth factor receptor transmembrane domain (24Lu C. Shimaoka M. Zang Q. Takagi J. Springer T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2393-2398Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2). mAb HI111 bound only 50% as well to the isolated locked open I domain as to the isolated wild-type and locked closed I domains (Fig. 2 A). By contrast, when cells were treated with dithiothreitol to reduce disulfide bonds (14Lu C. Shimaoka M. Ferzly M. Oxvig C. Takagi J. Springer T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2387-2392Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), the binding of HI111 mAb was restored to the same level as to wild-type and closed I domains (Fig. 2 A). Similar results were obtained with mAb CBR LFA-1/1 (Fig.2 B). Disulfide bond reduction has been shown to abolish the increased adhesiveness and affinity of the isolated, locked open mutant I domains for ICAMs and appears to result in conversion to the closed conformation (14Lu C. Shimaoka M. Ferzly M. Oxvig C. Takagi J. Springer T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2387-2392Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 15Shimaoka M. Lu C. Palframan R. von Andrian U.H. Takagi J. Springer T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6009-6014Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Therefore, both HI111 and CBR LFA-1/1 mAbs preferentially bind to the conformation of the closed I domain, and the binding is reduced when LFA-1 is locked in the open conformation. Although mutations can be used to stabilize the open conformation of the I domain, it is important to demonstrate that a similar open conformation can be accessed by wild-type LFA-1 on the cell surface. LFA-1 can be activated by Mn2+, or by the combined presence of Mg2+ and absence of Ca2+ (31Dransfield I. Cabañas C. Craig A. Hogg N. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 219-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined the effect of divalent cations on expression of the HI111 and CBR LFA-1/1 epitopes on wild-type LFA-1. The binding of TS2/4 mAb was unaffected by activation, suggesting that the expression level of LFA-1 did not change (Fig. 3). Similar results were obtained with other mAb to LFA-1. However, the binding of HI111 and CBR LFA-1/1 mAbs to LFA-1 on activated cells was about 60–80% of the binding to LFA-1 on resting cells (Fig. 3). The decrease in binding was consistently seen in multiple experiments and was statistically significant. Thus, activation of LFA-1 either by locked open mutations or divalent cations can reduce the binding of HI111 and CBR LFA-1/1 mAbs, showing that the locked open conformation is similar to the native structure of activated LFA-1. Although the reduction in binding of the two mAbs was lesser than seen with locked open LFA-1, this may reflect incomplete conversion to the open conformation. To examine the structural features shared between the conformations of mutant, locked open αL and of activated, wild-type αL, we defined the epitopes of mAbs CBR LFA-1/1 and HI111. CBR LFA-1/1 was previously mapped to residues 301–359 (28Huang C. Springer T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19008-19016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) and reacts with the isolated I domain containing residues 130–338 (24Lu C. Shimaoka M. Zang Q. Takagi J. Springer T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2393-2398Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Therefore, its epitope comprises the C-terminal α-helix (residues 299–305) of the I domain and the following linker to the β-propeller domain. We used human-mouse αL chimeras to map the epitope recognized by HI111. Eight αL chimeras containing segments of the mouse αL I domain swapped into human αL or vice versa mapped the epitope to residues 249–300 (Table I, left). Individual amino acid substitutions of human with mouse sequence in this region showed that the HI111 mAb is specific for Lys-268, which is substituted to Val in the mouse sequence (Table I, right). This amino acid is located on the top face of the I domain not far from the MIDAS (Fig. 4).Table IMapping of the HI111 epitope to residue Lys-268 in the human αL subunitαL chimeraHI111 bindingαLmutantHI111 bindingh+D249S/K252H+m−I255H+h153m359h−Q266V+m153h359m+T267S+h118m153h+K268V−h153m183h+E269Q+h184m215h+S270K+h217m248h+E272K+h249m303h−K276I+h300m359h+K280E/A282V/S283E+Epitope249–300Epitope268The human and mouse chimeric αL mutants are named as described previously (28Huang C.

The ratio of fluorescence intensity was compared to that of human wild-type αL: +, indistinguishable from wild-type αL; −, indistinguishable from mock transfectant. To understand the basis of the reduced binding to the open conformation of the LFA-1 I domain, we measured the kinetics and affinity of HI111 binding to purified I domains. The HI111 mAb bound to the locked open I domain with a k on value 5-fold lower than to the wild-type I domain (Table II). Thek off values were similar. This resulted in a 5-fold lower affinity of HI111 for the locked open I domain than for the wild-type I domain.Table IIBinding kinetics of HI111 to the I domain of αLI domaink onk offK Dm−1·s−1s−1mWT1.25 × 1059.61 × 10−37.68 × 10−8Open2.32 × 1049.72 × 10−34.19 × 10−7The kinetics of binding of wild-type and locked open I domains to HI111 mAb immobilized on sensorchips was measured with surface plasmon resonance. Open table in a new tab The kinetics of binding of wild-type and locked open I domains to HI111 mAb immobilized on sensorchips was measured with surface plasmon resonance. The affinity measurements are in excellent agreement with the differences seen in immunofluorescent flow cytometry. The antibody concentration was 1.3 × 10−7m for staining cells; assuming monovalent binding, the K Dvalues predict 63% saturation of binding to wild-type and 24% saturation of binding to open mutant I domains. This 2.6-fold difference is in agreement with the ratio of 2- to 2.5-fold found in flow cytometry experiments. At a concentration of 2.7 × 10−7m, HI111 mAb almost completely inhibited adhesion to ICAM-1 of transfectants expressing wild-type LFA-1 (99%) and only partially inhibited binding of transfectants expressing locked open LFA-1 (18%) (data not shown). This is consistent with the predicted 78% saturation of cell surface binding to wild-type LFA-1, the 39% saturation of cell surface binding to LFA-1 containing a locked open I domain, and the greater affinity of the open conformation for ICAM-1. We demonstrate here that two mAbs that bind to distinct epitopes, HI111 and CBR LFA-1/1, report conformational change in LFA-1 I domains on the cell surface. Both mAbs bind better to wild-type and locked closed I domains than to the locked open I domains. When the I domain is locked in the open conformation, there is nearly a 50% reduction of their binding. Most importantly, a similar trend is also observed when wild-type LFA-1 is activated by cations, suggesting that change toward the open conformation occurs when LFA-1 is activated on the cell surface. The native LFA-1 activation process is dynamic and may involve an equilibrium between closed and open conformers, or intermediate conformational states. This could explain the observation that binding of HI111 and CBR LFA-1/1 to LFA-1 activated by cations was decreased less than when the I domain was locked open by mutational introduction of a disulfide bond.

It is important that decreased binding to the open conformation was seen with both isolated I domains and αLβ2, because this demonstrates that changes within the I domain itself, rather than inter-domain rearrangements that affect accessibility, are recognized by the HI111 and CBR LFA-1/1 mAbs. The CBR LFA-1/1 and HI111 mAbs map to distinct, functionally important sites in the I domain. CBR LFA-1/1 maps to the residues at the lower part of the C-terminal α-helix of the I domain and the subsequent segment that connects to the β-propeller domain. This region is predicted to move downward in the transition to the open conformation (Fig. 4) and is part of the I domain allosteric site that regulates the activation of LFA-1 as shown by mutations and chemical shift perturbations when ICAM-1 is bound (22Huth J.R.

Although the C-terminal α helix undergoes significant conformational changes upon ligand binding, this region plays only an indirect or regulatory role in ligand binding. Multiple classes of small molecules have been identified that bind between the C-terminal α-helix and the body of the I domain and inhibit binding to ICAM-1 by stabilizing the closed conformation (26Kallen J.

Lys-268 is the first residue of α-helix 5, at the junction of the loop from the preceding β-strand 5, and is located near the MIDAS on the ligand-binding, “top” face of the I domain (Fig. 4). Superposition of the closed αL I domain structure and the open αL I domain model reveals a number of regions that are predicted to undergo significant backbone displacements in the closed to open transition. Those regions that shift the most are shown in yellow (open) andcyan (closed) and include the segment containing Lys-268 (Fig. 4). In conclusion, we have mapped mAb to the two distinct regions in the I domain of αL, which are predicted to undergo the largest backbone movements in the transition between the open and closed conformation. HI111 binds to the edge of the top face bearing the MIDAS, in or near the ligand binding site. By contrast, CBR LFA-1/1 binds to the lower part of the C-terminal α-helix or the linker, far from the MIDAS, to an allosteric site that is conformationally linked to movements at the MIDAS. The conformational movements detected by these mAb occur in comparisons between mutants stabilized in the open and closed conformations, upon reduction of the disulfide stabilizing the open mutant, and upon activation of wild-type LFA-1 on the cell surface. These studies add further support to the accumulating evidence that conformational change in integrin I domains regulates ligand binding. We conclude that LFA-1 undergoes conformational changes during activation, and the changes involve at least the two regions recognized by mAbs HI111 and CBR LFA-1/1."

Here we report that the levels of Prx I mRNA and protein are dramatically increased in a murine osteoblast cell line, MC3T3-E1, by treatment with sodium arsenate. We further studied the signaling pathways that control the induction of Prx I expression. The treatment of osteoblasts with arsenate activated ERK1/2, JNK, and p38 MAPK. Pre-treating cells with inhibitors of p38 MAPK abolished the induction of Prx I protein but had minimal effect on the induction of Prx I mRNA, suggesting that p38 MAPK activity was required for post-transcriptional regulation. The inhibition of ERK1 and ERK2 had no effect on the induction of Prx I expression.

Oxidative stress is believed to contribute to the etiology of various degenerative diseases such as cerebellar ischemia, cancer, and the process of aging (reviewed in Refs. 1.Halliwell B.

Oxidants including superoxides and H2O2 are generated under physiological conditions during mitochondrial electron transport, peroxisomal fatty acid metabolism, phagocytosis by macrophages, and bone resorption by osteoclasts (2.Beckman K.B.

Chem. 1999; 274: 19792-19798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). High levels of oxidants result in DNA strand breaks, oxidation of lipids and proteins, activation of poly(ADP-ribosylation), depletion of cellular energy stores, and cell death. Lower concentration of oxidants causes apoptosis in some cell lines, whereas high concentration usually causes necrosis (1.Halliwell B. Gutteridge J.M.

In addition, accumulating evidence suggests that reactive oxygen species such as H2O2 play important roles in cell signaling in non-phagocytic cells. For example, platelet-derived growth factor stimulation results in the generation of H2O2, which is required for platelet-derived growth factor-induced mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) 1The abbreviations used are: MAPKmitogen-activated protein kinaseSTATsignal transducers and activators of transcriptionPrx Iperoxiredoxin IERKextracellular signal-regulated kinaseJNKc-Jun N-terminal kinaseCaMcalmodulinMARCKSmyristoylated alanine-rich protein kinase C substratemRNAmessenger RNA activation, STAT activation, and DNA synthesis (6.Sundaresan M.

One such protein is peroxiredoxin I (Prx I), originally identified as a 23-kDa stress-inducible protein termed MSP23 in mouse macrophages (8.Ishii T. Yamada M. Sato H. Matsue M. Taketani S.

The human counterpart was cloned from human breast epithelial cell line 100 (HBL100) cells and was named PAG (proliferationassociated gene), because it is expressed at a higher level in transformed cells (10.Prosperi M.T. Ferbus D. Karczinski I. Goubin G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11050-11056Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The rat counterpart was cloned as a heme-binding protein (HBP23) in rat liver cytosol (11.Immenschuh S. Iwahara S. Satoh H. Nell C. Katz N. Muller-Eberhard U. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13407-13411Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Prx family proteins have conserved cysteine residues that are important for thioredoxin peroxidase activity (12.Kang S.W. Baines I.C. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6303-6311Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar) and thiol radical scavenging (13.Yim M.B. Chae H.Z. Rhee S.G. Chock P.B. Stadtman E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1621-1626Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, Prx I has also been implicated in signaling pathways. It was found that human Prx I (Pag) interacts with c-Abl, a non-receptor tyrosine kinase, and that overexpressed Prx I can negatively regulate the kinase activity and cytostatic activity of c-Abl (14.Wen S.T. Van Etten R.A. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2456-2467Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Prx I is up-regulated by stress agents including H2O2, diethyl maleate, and sodium arsenite in macrophages (15.Ishii T. Itoh K. Takahashi S. Sato H. Yanagawa T. Katoh Y. Bannai S. Yamamoto M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16023-16029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1234) Google Scholar). Arsenate is also a potent inducer of Prx I in a human mammary cell line (16.Prosperi M.T. Ferbus D. Rouillard D. Goubin G. FEBS Lett. 1998; 423: 39-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The induction of the prx I gene by electrophilic agents and reactive oxygen species is mainly controlled by the transcription factor Nrf2 in murine peritoneal macrophages (15.Ishii T. Itoh K. Takahashi S. Sato H. Yanagawa T. Katoh Y. Bannai S. Yamamoto M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16023-16029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1234) Google Scholar). In peritoneal macrophages isolated from nrf2 knockout mice, the induction of Prx I was diminished, and the cells were more susceptible to the killing effect of an electrophilic agent. The expression of genes encoding hemeoxygenase I and A170 was also diminished in the mutant macrophages. Similarly, Nrf2 is also essential for the induction of the activation of genes encoding detoxifying enzymes such as glutathione S-transferase and NAD(P)H:Quinone oxidoreductase by electrophilic agents (17.Itoh K. Chiba T. Takahashi S. Ishii T. Igarashi K. Katoh Y. Oyake T. Hayashi N. Satoh K. Hatayama I. Yamamoto M. Nabeshima Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 236: 313-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (3189) Google Scholar). Nrf2 interacts with the antioxidant responsive elements and regulates the expression of those genes important for defense against oxidative stress. The signaling pathways regulating expression of Prx I are not clear. Agents causing oxidative stress activate many signaling pathways including MAPKs, protein kinase C-δ, and nuclear factor-kB (18.McCord J.M. Am. J. Med. 2000; 108: 652-659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1058) Google Scholar, 19.Hensley K. Robinson K.A. Gabbita S.P. Salsman S. Floyd R.A. Free Radical Biol. Med. 2000; 28: 1456-1462Crossref PubMed Scopus (866) Google Scholar). Three MAPKs (ERK1/2, JNK, and p38 MAPK) are activated by high concentrations of H2O2. The activation of MAPK and/or PKCδ plays an important role in the oxidative stress-induced expression of genes such as nitric-oxide synthase (20.Carpenter L. Cordery D. Biden T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5368-5374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) and ornithine decarboxylase (21.Otieno M.A. Kensler T.W. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 4391-4396PubMed Google Scholar). In this report we studied the signaling pathways that are involved in the induction of Prx I in osteoblasts by sodium arsenate. We demonstrate that arsenate induced the expression of Prx I in an osteoblast cell line, and that this induction required the activation of both p38 MAPK and protein kinase Cδ. The osteoblast cell line MC3T3-E1 was cultured in α-minimum essential medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal calf serum (Research Sera). Osteoblasts were subcultured the day before and then treated with sodium arsenate for various times. For the analysis of Prx I protein, cells were treated for 16 h and then washed with phosphate-buffered saline, collected, and the level of Prx I was analyzed by Western blot. For the analysis of mRNA, cells were treated 12 h. Total RNA was isolated and analyzed by Northern blot. For analysis of protein kinases, cells were treated from 5 min to 16 h. At each time point, cells from one plate were washed and lysed. To test the effect of the kinase inhibitors SB203580, PD98059, and rottlerin (Calbiochem) on Prx I induction, various concentrations of the compounds were added to the cell cultures 1 h prior to the addition of sodium arsenate. Cells were further treated in medium containing both sodium arsenate and SB203580, PD98059, or rottlerin for an additional 16 h. The cells were then harvested for Western and Northern analysis. Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, 1 mmEDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm β-glycerophosphate, and 10 μg/ml each of aprotinin and leupeptin. Protein concentrations were determined by Bio-Rad method. The same amount of protein (20 μg) was fractionated by electrophoresis on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel, transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Immobilon-p), probed with polyclonal anti-Prx I antibodies, and visualized using an ECL kit (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). Anti-phosphorylated ERKs, p38 MAPK, JNK, and myristoylated alanine-rich protein kinase C substrate (MARCKS) antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling. Anti-p38 antibody was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. 1 × 106osteoblasts were plated onto 100-mm plates and treated the second day with sodium arsenate. Cells were collected, and total RNA was isolated using RNAzol (TelTest), fractionated on a 1.5% formaldehyde-agarose gel, transferred to Nytran membrane (S & S), and probed with random primer-labeled Prx I cDNA. Cells were challenged with arsenate for different times and then lysed with phosphorylation lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 200 μmsodium orthovanadate, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 100 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm EDTA, 1.5 mm magnesium chloride, 10% glycerol, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg of aprotinin/ml). Cell lysate was separated to cytosolic and particulate fractions by centrifugation for 30 min at 100,000 × g, and the particulate was dissolved in the same buffer plus Triton X-100. The particulate fractions were immunoprecipitated with an antibody against PKCδ using protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). The immunocomplexes were washed three times with phosphorylation lysis buffer and two times with kinase buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 20 μg of phosphatidylserine, 20 μm ATP) and were resuspended in 30 μl of kinase buffer containing 5 μg of histone H1, and 20 μCi of [32P]ATP was added. The reaction was incubated for 30 min at room temperature and was terminated by the addition of SDS sample buffer. Proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and the phosphorylated form of histone H1 was detected by autoradiography. Sodium arsenate is a toxic compound that activates the oxidative stress pathway in several cell types. Arsenate is able to induce the expression of the Prx I at the level of protein and mRNA in the human breast epithelial cell line HBL100 and murine macrophage WAR cells (16.Prosperi M.T. Ferbus D. Rouillard D. Goubin G. FEBS Lett. 1998; 423: 39-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). To test the effects of arsenate on osteoblasts, a murine osteoblast cell line, MC3T3-E1, was incubated with medium containing arsenate at different concentrations, and Prx I levels were analyzed by Western blot. Two protein species of 23 and 24 kDa in size were detected with the antiserum (Fig. 1A). The main 23-kDa band corresponds to Prx I, and the minor 24-kDa band probably corresponds to Prx III, a family protein localizing in the mitochondrial matrix. Prx I was strongly induced in MC3T3-E1 cells in a dose-dependent manner with maximum protein levels detected at approximately 0.10 mm arsenate (Fig. 1A). The induction occurs at the level of transcription, because Northern blot analysis showed that the levels of Prx I mRNA are dramatically increased (Fig. 1B). The induction was detected at 4 h after the addition of arsenate and reached the maximal level after 8 h. The increase of both mRNA and protein was completely blocked by treating the cells with RNA polymerase II inhibitor, actinomycin D (data not shown). The decrease in the expression of Prx I at the higher concentration of sodium arsenate may be caused by cell death. Oxidative stress triggered by H2O2 treatment has been found to activate MAP kinase pathways including ERKs, JNK, and p38 MAPK, and arsenate itself has been shown to activate JNK in human embryonic kidney 293 cells (22.Porter A.C. Fanger G.R. Vaillancourt R.R. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7794-7802Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). To test whether sodium arsenate activates these pathways in osteoblasts, MC3T3-E1 cells were exposed to sodium arsenate in the culture medium. The cells were harvested and lysed after various times of treatment, and the levels of active kinases were analyzed by Western blot. Antibodies that specifically recognize the activated forms of ERKs, JNK, and p38 MAPK were used to determine the kinase activation (Fig. 2A). The level of activated ERKs, rapidly increased to the maximum level within 10 min, started to decline within 30 min and then stayed at a level slightly higher than the basal level for a few hours. JNK was also activated within 10 min and declined after approximately 30 min, although the activation was much weaker. Osmotic stress was found to activate JNK to a much higher extent (Fig. 2B), indicating that arsenate is not a strong activator of the JNK pathway under these settings. In contrast to the rapid initial increase in ERK and JNK activation, p38 MAPK showed no rapid increase but was activated only in a slow time course. The levels of active p38 MAPK gradually increased to a maximum (Fig. 2A) even after 16 h of treatment (data not shown). The level of p38 MAPK protein itself as monitored by Western blot did not change upon sodium arsenate treatment. Thus, the three kinases examined in these experiments showed distinct patterns of induction. To determine whether or not the MAPK pathways were important for the induction of Prx I by arsenate, cells were pretreated with kinase inhibitors for 1 h before adding sodium arsenate. PD98059, which specifically inhibits the ERKs, had no effect on the induction of Prx I even at a concentration of 40 μm (Fig. 3A), suggesting that the induction of Prx I did not require the ERK pathways. Fig. 3B shows that PD98059 inhibited the activation of ERKs by arsenate in a dosage-dependent manner. Even at 5 μm, the level of activated ERKs was reduced to the basal level. In contrast, SB203580, a specific inhibitor for p38 MAPK, potently inhibited the induction of Prx I in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4A). At 5 μmconcentration, SB203580 dramatically reduced the levels of Prx I, and at 30 μm, the amount of Prx I protein was reduced to basal levels indicating a complete inhibition. This is the range of concentration that is effective for the inhibition of p38 in a large number of tested cell lines. A second specific inhibitor for p38 MAPK, SB202190, could also block the induction of Prx I at a concentration of 2 μm (data not shown). To determine whether the inhibition occurred at the level of transcription, Northern blot analysis was carried out. The levels of Prx I mRNA were only slightly reduced by SB203580 compared with the levels of protein (Fig. 4B). These results suggest that the inhibition of Prx I induction by the drug may involve both transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms, but that the major effect is post-transcriptional.Figure 4A, inhibition of p38 MAPK suppresses the induction of Prx I protein by arsenate. Experiments were carried out as described in Fig. 3A. B, Northern blot analysis showing that Prx I mRNA was not affected by the inhibition of p38 MAPK. MC3T3-E1 cells were treated as in A, and total RNA was isolated. 20 μg of total RNA was fractionated on a 1.2% formaldehyde-agarose gel, and the mRNA level of Prx I was analyzed by Northern blot using a random primer-labeled probe. 18 S ribosomal RNA was used as loading control.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To determine whether PKCδ plays a role in the signaling pathways controlling the induction of Prx I by arsenate, we used an inhibitor specific for PKCδ, rottlerin (23.Kontny E. Kurowska M. Szczepanska K. Maslinski W. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2000; 67: 249-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Rottlerin also inhibits CaM kinase III, but the only known substrate for CaM kinase III is elongation factor 2, and neither elongation factor 2 nor CaM kinase III has been implicated in oxidative stress responses. Osteoblasts were pretreated with different concentrations of rottlerin for 1 h, and then 0.06 mm arsenate was added. After 16 h, cells were collected, and the Prx I protein levels were determined by Western blot analysis. Fig. 5A shows that 5 μm rottlerin completely blocked the induction of Prx I protein. To exclude a role for CaM kinase III in the induction, two other PKC inhibitors, staurosporine and Go6983, were similarly tested. Both were able to inhibit Prx I induction. Staurosporine, a general PKC inhibitor, inhibited the induction of Prx I in a dosage-dependent manner, and at 100 nm, the inhibition was close to complete. Because rottlerin is a drug that only affects PKCδ of the protein kinase C family, these results taken together suggest that PKCδ is required for the induction of Prx I by arsenate treatment. Northern blot analysis (Fig. 5C) shows that the inhibition occurred also at the level of mRNA. These data suggest that the activation of a PKCδ kinase activity is necessary for the up-regulation of the Prx I mRNA in response to arsenate treatment. On the other hand, wortmannin, a specific inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, has no effect on Prx I induction (data not shown). To test whether arsenate activates PKCδ in osteoblasts, cells were treated with arsenate and were collected at different time points, PKCδ was immunoprecipitated with a monoclonal antibody, and an in vitro kinase assay was performed using H1 histone protein as substrate. Fig. 6A shows that arsenate rapidly activates PKCδ. Within 30 min, PKCδ activation reached the maximal level, and the kinase activity remained high even 4 h after stimulation. Furthermore, arsenate treatment also led to the phosphorylation of a PKC substrate, MARCKS, and the phosphorylation was inhibited by rottlerin in a dosage-dependent manner (Fig. 6B) as was the inhibition of Prx I induction. These data support the conclusion that the activation of PKCδ is required for Prx I induction. The experiments presented above suggest that the induction of Prx I by arsenate treatment required the activation of both p38 MAPK and protein kinase δ. To determine whether the activation of PKCδ was upstream of p38 MAPK in response to arsenate treatment, we pretreated osteoblasts for 1 h with 5 μm rottlerin, a concentration sufficient to block the induction of Prx I. We then added 0.06 mm arsenate, and at different time points, we collected cells and made cell lysates. The activation of p38 MAPK was determined by Western blot analysis using the antibody that specifically recognizes activated p38 MAPK (Fig. 7). We did not detect any significant difference in the activation of p38 MAPK with or without rottlerin. Similarly, the activation of ERK1/2 was not affected by the presence of rottlerin (data not shown). Because the activation of p38 MAPK is a much slower process than the activation of PKCδ (30 min versus 2 h), it is unlikely that p38 MAPK works upstream of PKCδ. These data suggest that the activation of PKCδ and p38 MAPK was by parallel and independent pathways. The experiments presented above show that arsenate causes a dramatic increase in Prx I protein and mRNA in a murine osteoblast cell line, MC3T3-E1. Osteoblasts may be exposed to significant levels of oxidants generated by osteoclasts during bone remodeling (24.Steinbeck M.J. Appel Jr., W.H. Verhoeven A.J. Karnovsky M.J. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 765-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) and may have a particular need for a strong response to oxidative stress. In fact, oxidative stress has also been found to induce the expression of genes such as Hic5 (hydrogen peroxide inducible clone 5), c-jun, c-fos, and Erg-1 in MC3T3-E1 (reviewed in Ref. 25.Allen R.G. Tresini M. Free Radical Biol. Med. 2000; 28: 463-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (1069) Google Scholar). There is some difference between osteoblasts and other cell lines in terms of Prx I induction by arsenate. In WAR and HBL100 cells, the induction of Prx I mRNA by arsenate is dramatic, whereas the induction at the protein level is much less, indicating that there may be a level of regulation after transcription that is missing from these two cell lines. The induction of Prx I expression by arsenate is associated with the activation of multiple MAPK pathways, including the ERK, JNK, and p38 pathways. We find that p38 activation but not ERK is required for Prx I expression. The role for p38 MAPK seems to act mainly at the post-transcriptional level, because the inhibition of p38 MAPK only slightly suppressed the mRNA level of Prx I while almost completely blocking the increase of Prx I protein levels. An example of similar regulation is the induction of vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 in human umbilical vein endothelial cells by tumor necrosis factor α. The inhibition of p38 MAPK by an inhibitor, which completely abolished the tumor necrosis factor α-induced vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 expression did not affect the accumulation of vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 mRNA. In the same cells, the induction of intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) by tumor necrosis factor α was not affected by the inhibition of p38 MAPK (26.Pietersma A. Tilly B.C. Gaestel M. de Jong N. Lee J.C. Koster J.F. Sluiter W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 230: 44-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Because p38 MAPK has been shown to phosphorylate eukaryotic initiation factor 4E and thereby activate translation (27.Wang X. Flynn A. Waskiewicz A.J. Webb B.L. Vries R.G. Baines I.A. Cooper J.A. Proud C.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9373-9377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar), it is plausible that translational activation may synergize with transcriptional activation in the induction of Prx I. It will be interesting to test whether or not sodium arsenate treatment activates eukaryotic initiation factor 4E in a p38-dependent manner. Rottlerin, a specific inhibitor of PKCδ and CaM III kinase, suppressed the induction of the protein and mRNA in response to arsenate, suggesting that PKCδ or CaM kinase III is involved in the transcriptional regulation of prx I gene. Two other PKC inhibitors, staurosporine and Go6983, also inhibited the induction of Prx I, supporting a role for PKC members. On the other hand, CaM kinase III, also called elongation factor-2 kinase, is a negative regulator of eukaryotic mRNA translation. It phosphorylates and inactivates elongation factor-2 kinase, thereby reducing the rate of peptide chain elongation. Thus, the inhibition of CaM kinase III by rottlerin is expected to increase the translational activity. We observed the opposite here that the expression of Prx I was completely blocked with a loss of prx I mRNA. These results argue against a role of CaM kinase III in the induction of Prx I. PKCδ seems to fit well in such a role. PKCδ has been suggested to act as a sensor of oxidative stress, because it contains many cysteine residues (28.Gopalakrishna R. Jaken S. Free Radical Biol. Med. 2000; 28: 1349-1361Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar). PKCδ was also known to be required for the induction of ornithine decarboxylase expression by oxidative stress (21.Otieno M.A. Kensler T.W. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 4391-4396PubMed Google Scholar) and for the induction of inducible nitric-oxide synthase in response to interleukin-1β (20.Carpenter L. Cordery D. Biden T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5368-5374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). In summary, the induction of Prx I seems to be regulated at both transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels, which were controlled by a bifurcating signaling pathway. p38 MAPK is mainly involved in post-transcriptional regulation, and PKCδ is involved in the transcriptional activation (Fig. 8).

A structural hypothesis is presented to account for this peculiar phenotype. Cytochrome b6 f catalyzes electron transfer from plastoquinol to a hydrosoluble acceptor (plastocyanin or cytochrome c6), while building up a transmembrane proton gradient. The b6 f complex is found in higher plants, in algae, and in cyanobacteria (1.Berry E.A. Guergova-Kuras M. Huang L.-s. Crofts A.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 1005-1075Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). Purified cytochrome b6 f from the freshwater unicellular alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii is a superdimer (2.Breyton C.

Cytochrome b6 and suIV are homologous to the N- and C-terminal moieties, respectively, of cytochrome b; the chloroplast Rieske protein is homologous to its mitochondrial homonym. Cytochrome f and cytochrome c1, despite their functional similarities, are not evolutionarily related (see Ref. 1.Berry E.A. Guergova-Kuras M. Huang L.-s. Crofts A.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 1005-1075Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). Purified preparations of cytochrome b6 f also contain several very small subunits (∼4 kDa), which have no homologues in cytochrome bc1. Each of them is thought to span the membrane as a single α-helix. Subunits PetG and PetL have been encountered in all b6 f complexes studied thus far (4.Haley J. Bogorad L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5834-5842Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), but a gene encoding a homologous protein is present in the nuclear DNA of C. reinhardtii(11.Asamizu E. Nakamura Y. Sato S. Fukuzawa H. Tabata S. DNA Res. 1999; 6: 369-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). The role of the 4-kDa subunits is uncertain. Deletion of the petG gene in C. reinhardtii (12.Berthold D.A. Schmidt C.L. Malkin R. Mathis P. Photosynthesis: From Light to Biosphere, Proceedings of the Xth International Congress on Photosynthesis. II. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1995: 571-574Google Scholar) or of the petN gene in tobacco (10.Hager M. Biehler K. Illerhaus J. Ruf S. Bock R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5834-5842Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) prevents accumulation of the b6 f complex, while deletion of the petM gene in Synechocystis PCC 6803 does not interfere with the assembly of a functional complex (9.Boronowsky U. Wenk S.-O. Schneider D. Jäger C. Rögner M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1506: 55-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). As discussed below, the case of PetL is intermediate.The structure of several forms of cytochrome bc1has been solved by x-ray crystallography (reviewed in Ref. 1.Berry E.A. Guergova-Kuras M. Huang L.-s. Crofts A.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 1005-1075Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). As regards the b6mh;1q f complex, x-ray data are limited to the extramembrane, catalytic domains of cytochrome f and the Rieske protein (for a review, see Ref.1.Berry E.A. Guergova-Kuras M. Huang L.-s. Crofts A.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 1005-1075Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). Low resolution electron microscopy projection maps of the whole complex reveal an arrangement of transmembrane helices around the C2 axis of symmetry of the dimer that looks similar to that in cytochrome bc1, making it possible to propose tentative positions in the map for most of the b6 f transmembrane helices (see Ref. 13.Breyton C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1459: 467-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Since cytochrome bc1 does not contain peptides homologous to the small b6 f subunits, its structure on the other hand is of little help in trying to understand their arrangement and role in the b6 f complex; yet, some of the structural divergences between the two types of cytochromes, including their dissimilar subunit and prosthetic group (see Ref. 14.Pierre Y. Breyton C. Lemoine Y. Robert B. Vernotte C. Popot J.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21901-21908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) complements, must bear on functional differences.One of those, which is particularly relevant to the present work, is the role of cytochrome b6 f in the so-called state transitions, a regulatory process whereby photosynthetic organisms balance the supply of excitons between the reaction centers of the two photosystems (PS) (15.Bonaventura C. Myers J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1969; 189: 366-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar, 16.Allen J.F. Biochim Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1098: 275-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar). Transition from state 1 to state 2 results from the transfer of a fraction of the outer PSII light-harvesting complex (LHCII) to PSI, a process triggered by the phosphorylation of LHCII (16.Allen J.F. Biochim Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1098: 275-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar, 17.Bennett J. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. 1991; 42: 281-311Crossref Scopus (231) Google Scholar). During a state 2 → state 1 transition, LHCII is dephosphorylated and reassociates with PSII (16.Allen J.F. Biochim Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1098: 275-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar). Modulation of the phosphorylation state of antenna proteins result from the opposite actions of an LHCII kinase, the activation of which is redox-dependent (18.Allen J.F. Bennett J. Steinback K.E. Arntzen C.J. Nature. 1981; 291: 25-29Crossref Scopus (513) Google Scholar), and a phosphatase, which is generally considered to be permanently active (19.Elich T.D. Endelman M. Matoo A.K. FEBS Lett. 1997; 4111: 236-238Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Recent data, however, have suggested a possible regulatory role of an immunophilin-like protein (20.Fulgosi H. Vener A.V. Altchmied L. Hermann R.G. Andersson B. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1577-1587Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation is activated by the reduction of the plastoquinone (PQ) pool (18.Allen J.F. Bennett J. Steinback K.E. Arntzen C.J. Nature. 1981; 291: 25-29Crossref Scopus (513) Google Scholar, 21.Horton P. Black M.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1981; 635: 53-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) and requires the presence of cytochrome b6 f (22.Wollman F.-A. Lemaire C. Hall D.O. Grassi G.

EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2961-2969Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). The nature of the kinase is still obscure, although its presence has been reported in partially purified preparations of higher plant cytochrome b6 f complexes (24.Gal A. Hauska G. Herrmann R. Ohad I. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19742-19749Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In Arabidopsis thaliana, the consequences of expressing antisense RNAs (25.Snyders S. Kohorn B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32169-32176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) suggest the involvement in state transitions of a family of thylakoid-associated, presumably transmembrane, kinases (thylakoid-associated kinases) (26.Snyders S. Kohorn B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9137-9140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Although the molecular mechanism by which the redox state of the PQ pool controls the kinase is not known, it has been shown in vitro with thylakoid preparations from spinach (27.Vener A.V. Van Kan P.J. Gal A. Andersson B. Ohad I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25225-25232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 28.Vener A.V. Van Kan P.J. Rich P.R. Ohad I. Andersson B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1585-1590Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar) and in vivo in C. reinhardtii cells (23.Zito F. Finazzi G. Delosme R. Nitschke W. Picot D. Wollman F.-A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2961-2969Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar) that it depends on plastoquinol (PQH2) binding to the oxidizing (Qo) site of the cytochrome b6 f complex.The original aim of the present work was to gather information about the location and transmembrane topology of subunit PetL. PetL is strictly required neither for the accumulation nor for the function of cytochrome b6 f; in its absence, however, the complex becomes unstable in vivo in aging cells and labile in vitro (7.Takahashi Y. Rahire M. Breyton C. Popot J.-L. Joliot P. Rochaix J.-D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3498-3506Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The mRNA sequence deduced from that of the chloroplast gene petL features two possible AUG codons (7.Takahashi Y. Rahire M. Breyton C. Popot J.-L. Joliot P. Rochaix J.-D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3498-3506Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The N terminus of PetL being blocked (3.Pierre Y. Breyton C. Kramer D. Popot J.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29342-29349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), it is not known which is used for initiation. The distribution of basic residues in the predicted sequence of PetL suggests that, whatever the N terminus is, it is likely to lie in the thylakoid lumen (7.Takahashi Y. Rahire M. Breyton C. Popot J.-L. Joliot P. Rochaix J.-D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3498-3506Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). If this prediction is correct, the C terminus of suIV and the N terminus of PetL lie in the same subcellular compartment. In the present study, we have fused the genes coding for suIV (petD) and for PetL by linking either the first or the second of the putative initiation codons for PetL to that coding for the last residue of suIV (Fig. 1) and examined the expression and accumulation of the chimeric constructs. In vivo functional analysis using time-resolved spectroscopy and fluorescence measurements revealed unusual properties; the chimeric mutants are unimpaired as far as the Q-cycle is concerned, but their state transitions are blocked. To narrow down the range of possible structural interpretations of these observations, the length of mature PetL has been directly investigated by mass spectrometry analysis of the WT complex. The phenotype of the chimeric strains provides interesting insights into the nature of transconformations that could account for the activation of the kinase. In the course of the mass spectrometry study, evidence was also obtained regarding the presence in Chlamydomonas b6 f of a hitherto unrecognized subunit, PetN, which was confirmed immunologically.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialsSources of chemicals not indicated were as described in Ref. 3.Pierre Y.

Rahire M. Breyton C. Popot J.-L. Joliot P. Rochaix J.-D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3498-3506Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) were used as controls. The deletion strain ΔpetD (mt+) (29.Kuras R. Wollman F.A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1019-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) was used as recipient strain in chloroplast transformation experiments. WT and mutant strains were grown on Tris acetate-phosphate medium (pH 7.2) at 25 °C under dim light (5–6 microeinsteins·m−2·s−1) (30.Harris E.H.

Cells were harvested during exponential growth phase and resuspended in a minimal medium (31.Sueoka N. Proc. Natl. Acad. U. S. A. 1960; 46: 83-91Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). They were placed in state 1 and state 2 conditions in darkness, either by vigorous stirring to ensure a strong aeration (state 1; Ref. 32.Wollman F.-A. Delepelaire P. J.

To generate the fusion between the petD and petL genes, plasmid pdDΔHI.I (29.Kuras R. Wollman F.A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1019-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), carrying the entire coding sequence of petD, was used as template in PCRs using oligonucleotides petDDir (CGCGCTTAAGTTAAGATCTAAAATTTTAAATTTCCCTCTA) and petDRev (CGCGCTTAAGAATAAACCTAAAGTTAAAGAAATATCAA) as primers and the ArrowTM Taq DNA polymerase according to the manufacturer's instructions. The PCR product was digested with AflII at a restriction site (underlined in the sequence) introduced along with the BglII site (indicated in boldface type), and religated onto itself to yield plasmid pdDΔFus. Plasmid pR23 (34.Rochaix J.-D. J. Mol. Biol. 1978; 126: 597-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), which carries the psaC operon (7.Takahashi Y. Rahire M. Breyton C. Popot J.-L. Joliot P.

PCR products were digested with AflII and BglII and cloned into plasmid pdDΔFus digested with the same enzyme, yielding plasmids p DLL and p DLS. The sequence of these plasmids was checked.Plasmids p DLL and p DLS were introduced by biolistic transformation (35.Boynton J.E. Gillham N.W. Harris E.H. Hosler J.P. Johnson A.M. Jones A.R.

The resulting mutant strains, DLL and DLS, were in turn used as recipient strains for biolistic transformation by plasmid p ycf7::aadA (a kind gift of Y.

Popot J.-L. Joliot P. Rochaix J.-D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3498-3506Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Transformed clones were selected on Tris acetate-phosphate medium containing spectinomycin (100 μg·ml−1) and subcloned several times on selective medium until they reached homoplasmy. At least three independent transformed strains were characterized for each construct.Preparative and Analytical TechniquesCells grown to a density of 4·106 ml−1 were broken in a “bead beater” (Biospec-Products) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The membrane fraction was collected by centrifugation and resuspended in 10 mm Tricine, pH 8, at a chlorophyll concentration of 3 g·liter−1. For SDS-PAGE, membrane proteins were resuspended in 100 mm dithiothreitol and 100 mm Na2CO3 and solubilized by 2% SDS at 100 °C for 1 min. Polypeptides were separated on a 12–18% polyacrylamide gel containing 8 m urea (36.Piccioni R.G. Bennoun P. Chua N.-H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1981; 117: 93-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar).

Samples were localized on parallel lanes by combining immunoblotting with specific antibodies and staining with Ponceau red. The spots of interest were excised and fixed to a stainless steel target using double-sided tape. After several tests with different matrices, α-cyanohydroxycinnamic acid (Sigma) was selected as the matrix of choice. Blot pieces were soaked into isopropyl alcohol and covered with a drop of the supernatant of a saturated solution of α-cyanohydroxycinnamic acid in acetone. After drying, samples were washed with acetonitrile. Extraction of chlorophyll by acetone prior to mass spectrometry resulted in the loss of part of the low Mr peptides, the proportion of the smaller species (peaks around 3.5 kDa) diminishing considerably as compared with heavier ones (peaks around 4 kDa; not shown). All analyses therefore were performed without chlorophyll extraction. MALDI-TOF measurements were carried out on a STR Voyager mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems, Framingham, CA) equipped with a nitrogen laser (237 nm, 20 Hz). Spectra were acquired in the linear positive mode (accelerating voltage 20 kV, grid voltage 95%), with a delayed extraction time of 300 ns. They were calibrated using a mixture of adrenocorticotropic hormone (residues 7–38;m/z = 3660.19 Da) and bovine insulin (m/z = 2867.80 and 5734.59 Da), which was applied directly to blot pieces.RESULTSConstruction of C. reinhardtii Mutants Expressing Chimeric ProteinsTwo chimeric proteins were constructed; both of them comprised of a full-length suIV fused, at its C terminus, to the N terminus of PetL (Fig. 1). They differed with respect to which of two AUG codons was considered as the initiation codon for PetL synthesis. As a result, the last transmembrane helix of suIV was connected to the single putative transmembrane helix of PetL by either a short or a long intervening loop (∼20 and ∼30 residues, respectively). The corresponding plasmids were named p DLS and p DLL. The chloroplast genome of the nonphototrophic ΔpetD strain, which lacks the gene encoding suIV (29.Kuras R. Wollman F.A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1019-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), was transformed by either plasmid. Both chimeric constructs yielded phototrophic clones. SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting with an anti-suIV antiserum showed that thylakoid membranes prepared from the transformed strains still lacked WT suIV. They accumulated instead a larger protein, whose size correlated with the expected size of the chimeras (Fig. 2). The same protein indeed also reacted with an antiserum directed against PetL (not shown). The restoration of phototrophy therefore is not due to the presence of WT-like suIV but to the fact that either of the two chimeric proteins can substitute for it.Figure 2Immunoblot analysis of cytochrome b6 f subunits in wild-type and mutant strains. Immunoblot analysis of the accumulation of suIV, PetL, cytochrome f (Cyt. f), and the Rieske protein in WT, ΔpetL, and transformant strains. Thylakoid membrane (containing 20 μg of chlorophyll) were subjected to SDS-PAGE, and blots were probed with subunit-specific antisera against subunits IV and PetL (see “Experimental Procedures”). Sera were used at a 1:10,000 dilution and detected using the ECL system (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). The PSII oxygen-evolving enhancer protein 3 (OEE3) protein was used as an internal control.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)In the absence of suIV, most other b6 f subunits are synthesized at the WT rate but rapidly degraded and therefore do not accumulate (29.Kuras R. Wollman F.A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1019-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 42.Choquet Y. Stern D.B. Wostrikoff K. Kuras R. Girard-Bascou J. Wollman F.-A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4380-4385Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). As expected given the phototrophy of the DLS and DLL strains, expression of either chimeric protein restored accumulation of the other b6 f subunits (Fig. 2), confirming that they assembled into a functional complex. A difference between the two strains, however, was consistently observed regarding WT PetL. This subunit, which was expressed in both cases along with the chimeric protein, accumulated to WT levels in the strain expressing the chimera with the short loop, DLS, but not in the presence of that with a long loop, DLL (Fig. 2). Since the b6 f complex is present and functional in DLL cells, it seemed likely that the chimeric protein could structurally and functionally substitute for both suIV and PetL.Chimeric PetL Is Able to Stabilize the b6f Complex in the Absence of the Endogenous SubunitIn order to test this hypothesis, the chloroplast genomes of strains DLL and DLS were transformed with plasmid p ycf7::aadA. This plasmid carries a petL coding sequence disrupted by the insertion of an aadA cassette, which confers resistance to spectinomycin (7.Takahashi Y. Rahire M. Breyton C. Popot J.-L. Joliot P.

To identify the molecular basis of its interaction with other microfibrillar proteins, deletion constructs of MAGP1 were expressed in a mammalian cell system that served as a model for microfibril assembly. This study identified a 54-amino acid sequence in the carboxyl-terminal region of the protein that defines a matrix-binding domain that is sufficient to target MAGP1 to the ECM. Site-directed mutagenesis demonstrated that binding activity is dependent on the presence of 7 cysteine residues in this sequence. MAGP2 contains a sequence similar to the matrix-binding domain of MAGP1, but could not associate with the ECM because of a single amino acid change. Two naturally occurring MAGP1 splice variants, MAGP1B (human-specific) and MAGP1D (found in mice), localized intracellularly when expressed as chimeric proteins with green fluorescent protein in rat lung fibroblasts.

This suggests a second action site for MAGP1. Microfibrils are 10–12-nm beaded filaments found in most tissues, particularly elastic tissues, bone, and cartilage (1.Mecham R.P. Davis E.C. Yurchenko P.D. Mecham R.P. Extracellular Matrix Assembly and Structure. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego, CA1994: 281-314Crossref Google Scholar). Their best known function is as a scaffold for tropoelastin deposition in the assembly of elastic fibers, although there is increasing evidence that they contribute to the mechanical properties of elastic tissues, provide structural integrity to non-elastic tissues, and anchor cells to elastic fibers and other matrix components through cell adhesion motifs (2.Robinson P.N. Godfrey M. J. Med. Genet. 2000; 37: 9-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). The major structural proteins of the microfibril are the fibrillins (3.Sakai L.Y. Keene D.R. Engvall E. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 2499-2509Crossref PubMed Scopus (902) Google Scholar, 4.Zhang H. Apfelroth S.D. Hu W. Davis E.C. Sanguineti C. Bonadio J. Mecham R.P. Ramirez F. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 855-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar), large modular glycoproteins consisting of repeating calcium-binding epidermal growth factor-like domains interspersed between unique 8-cysteine domains. The fibrillins create the core structure of microfibrils through a head-to-tail alignment of monomer bundles (5.Reinhardt D.P. Keene D.R. Corson G.M. Poschl E. Bachinger H.P. Gambee J.E. Sakai L.Y. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 256: 104-116Crossref Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Ultrastructurally, microfibrils are characterized by a “beads on a string” appearance, with fibrillin molecules contributing to both the bead and interbead regions. Other proteins have been localized to microfibrils in many tissues, but their exact function is unknown.

Polewski R. Fanning J.C. Gibson M.A. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1996; 44: 1389-1397Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These proteins have no significant similarity to any other proteins in the data bases and therefore form a small unique family of microfibrillar proteins. MAGP1 contains 183 amino acids that form two distinctive domains: the amino-terminal half of the molecule is highly acidic and enriched in proline and contains a clustering of glutamine residues, whereas the carboxyl-terminal portion contains all 13 cysteine residues and has an overall net positive charge. Disulfide bonding between cysteines apparently mediates the binding of MAGP1 to the microfibril because the presence of reducing agents is a requirement for the extraction of MAGP1 from tissues (9.Gibson M.A. Hughes J.L. Fanning J.C. Cleary E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 11429-11436Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The protein undergoes post-translational transglutamination, sulfation of specific tyrosine residues, and O-linked glycosylation (10.Crippes Trask B. Broekelmann T. Ritty T.M. Trask T.M. Tisdale C. Mecham R.P. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 4372-4380Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In mouse development, Magp1 mRNA is widely expressed, mainly in mesenchymal and connective tissue cells, where it is easily detected as early as day 8.5 of development (11.Chen Y. Faraco J. Yin W. Germiller J. Francke U. Bonadio J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 27381-27389Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). MAGP1 is associated with all microfibrils with only two known exceptions: those directly adjacent to the plasma membrane of aortic endothelial cells and those at the junction of the zonule and the lens capsule of the eye (8.Henderson M.

Bashir M. Rosenbloom J. Francke U. Genomics. 1995; 25: 630-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), mouse (Magp1) (11.Chen Y. Faraco J. Yin W. Germiller J. Francke U. Bonadio J. J. Biol.

Rosenbloom J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 593-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). A comparative study between human and mouse genes and analysis of the public data bases led us to identify novel forms of MAGP1 that arise from the alternative splicing of a unique transcript (16.Segade F. Broekelmann T. Pierce R. Mecham R.P. Matrix Biol. 2000; 19: 671-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). We identified a total of five splice variants in addition to the canonical full-length MAGP1A form. These transcripts are species-specific and are generated by different processing mechanisms. The alternative splice forms MAGP1A′, MAGP1B, and MAGP1C are expressed in human tissues, and the two variants Magp1A"" and Magp1Dwere found only in mouse. The alternatively spliced forms show restricted patterns of expression relative to the canonical isoform MAGP1A. Based on their features, we predicted that human MAGP1B and mouse Magp1D are not extracellular proteins, but represent possible intracellular forms of MAGP1 (16.Segade F. Broekelmann T. Pierce R. Mecham R.P. Matrix Biol. 2000; 19: 671-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). It is not yet known what role MAGP1 plays in microfibrillar structure or function. Previous studies have demonstrated that it is capable of binding tropoelastin, an interaction that may influence the linking of elastin monomers to microfibrils for their proper alignment. The acidic amino-terminal half of MAGP1 has been suggested to interact with a positively charged pocket near the C terminus of the tropoelastin monomer. Anti-peptide antibodies directed against a domain near the N terminus of MAGP1 are able to block the incorporation of tropoelastin into fibers by cultured chondrocytes (17.Brown-Augsburger P.B. Broekelmann T. Rosenbloom J. Mecham R.P. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 149-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Finnis and Gibson (18.Finnis M.L. Gibson M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22817-22823Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) localized tropoelastin binding, as well as binding to type VI collagen, to a tyrosine-rich sequence near the amino terminus of MAGP1. This sequence overlaps with the region suggested by the antibody studies of Brown-Augsburger et al. (17.Brown-Augsburger P.B. Broekelmann T. Rosenbloom J. Mecham R.P. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 149-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). MAGP2 is a 170–173-amino acid protein with similarity to MAGP1 in a central region of 60 amino acids where there is precise alignment of 7 cysteine residues (7.Gibson M.A. Hatzinikolas G. Kumaratilake J.S. Sandberg L.B. Nicholl J.K. Sutherland G.R. Cleary E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1096-1103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Outside of this region, the MAGP2 molecule is rich in serine and threonine residues and contains an RGD motif through which it binds αvβ3 integrin (19.Gibson M.A. Leavesley D.I. Ashman L.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13060-13065Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The molecule lacks the proline-, glutamine-, and tyrosine-rich sequences characteristic of MAGP1. Although MAGP2 has been localized to both elastin-associated and elastin-free microfibrils in a number of tissues, the protein exhibits patterns of tissue localization and developmental expression that are more restricted than those of MAGP1 (20.Gibson M.A. Finnis M.L. Kumaratilake J.S. Cleary E.G. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1998; 46: 871-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 21.Frankfater C. Maus E. Gaal K. Segade F. Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. Shipley J.M. Mamm. Genome. 2000; 11: 191-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). These structural and functional differences suggest that MAGP2 has a function related to cell signaling during microfibril assembly and elastogenesis, whereas MAGP1 may be more important for the structural integrity of the microfibril scaffold (20.Gibson M.A. Finnis M.L. Kumaratilake J.S. Cleary E.G. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1998; 46: 871-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). In this report, we describe the identification of domains in MAGP1A that target the protein to the ECM in living cells. To this end, we constructed a number of mutants derived from human MAGP1A that were expressed as fusion proteins with GFP as an in vivo reporter for protein localization. The distribution patterns obtained when these fusion proteins were expressed in rat lung cells identified a 54-amino acid sequence that encodes a minimal ECM-binding domain (MBD) located in the C-terminal region of MAGP1A. Through comparative analysis, a similar domain in MAGP2 was identified, but was found not to associate with the ECM of RFL-6 cells. Interestingly, matrix-binding ability could be generated in the MAGP2 sequence through a single amino acid change based on the MAGP1 sequence. We also show that the MAGP1 splice variants are intracellularly located; and therefore, a second action site for MAGP1 can be envisioned. These results have important implications for understanding the origin and evolution of the MAGPs and begin to identify regions of the proteins that influence their biological function. Rat RFL-6 cells (ATCC CCL-192) were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and were maintained in Kaighn's modified Ham's nutrient mixture F-12 (Ham's F-12K, Sigma) supplemented with 2.5 g/liter sodium bicarbonate, 20% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), 2 mm glutamine (Cellgro, Herndon, VA), 10 units/ml penicillin, and 10 μg/ml streptomycin. Full-length human MAGP1A coding sequence cDNA was obtained by reverse transcription-coupled PCR from MG63 cell RNA as described (16.Segade F. Broekelmann T. Pierce R. Mecham R.P.

An expressed sequence tag cDNA clone (GenBankTM/EBI accession numberAA056042) from the IMAGE Consortium encoding human MAGP2 was obtained from Genome Systems Inc. (St. Louis, MO). Primary sequence input, alignment, and conceptual translation were performed with the LASERGENE package of programs (DNASTAR, Inc., Madison, WI). Coding sequences of vertebrate MAGP1 and MAGP2 were obtained by BLAST searches of the GenBankTM/EBI Data Bank and subsequent conceptual translation. Evaluation of the evolutionary distances between the coding sequences of the human and mouse genes was carried out with SNAP software (Synonymous/Non-synonymousAnalysisProgram). 2Available at hiv-web.lanl.gov.

Segade, unpublished data. Monoclonal anti-V5 antibodies were purchased from Invitrogen. Construction of the chimeric GFP fusion proteins was carried out in the pEGFP-N1 vector (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). 4Sequences of the oligonucleotide primers used for the generation of the EGFP fusion proteins, deletions, and point mutations and detailed cloning procedures are available from the authors upon request. Schematics of the deletion mutants are shown in Fig. 3G. For the generation of deletion mutants, the appropriate oligonucleotides were used in high-fidelity PCRs using Pfu Turbo polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) to amplify DNA fragments derived from human (GenBankTM/EBI accession number XM_030510) or mouse (GenBankTM/EBI accession number NM_008546) MAGP1 and human MAGP2 (GenBankTM/EBI accession number XM_006648) cDNA sequences. The single and double residue mutants were generated with the QuikChange oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis system (Stratagene) using the appropriate pair of complementary primers according to the manufacturer's instructions. A summary of the single residue mutants is shown in Fig. 5. The integrity of the constructs was verified by sequencing with the EGFP-N oligonucleotide (CLONTECH) or the appropriate PCR primers. Samples were sequenced at the Washington University Protein and Nucleic Acid Chemistry Laboratory DNA Sequencing Facility. Sequences were extracted and analyzed with ABI Prism software (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA).

After 24 h, when the cells reached >90% confluency, the medium was replaced with fresh growth medium immediately before transfection, and the cells were transfected with 5 μg of the appropriate plasmid using 5 μl of the LipofectAMINE 2000 transfection reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were then incubated for 48 h before visualization of GFP expression. Forty-eight hours after transfection, RFL-6 cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline at room temperature for 30 min, and the coverslips were mounted on glass microscope slides. For indirect immunofluorescence detection, cultures of untransfected and transfected RFL-6 cells, plated as described above, were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and fixed with cold methanol. Nonspecific immunoreactivity was blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline for 1 h at room temperature. The cell layers were then incubated with primary antibody for 1 h at room temperature, followed by several washes in blocking buffer and a second incubation with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibody (diluted 1:400; Cappel, West Chester, PA) for 30 min. Slides were washed three times, mounted with a 50% glycerol solution containing 2–3 grains/ml p-phenylenediamine. Fluorescence was examined with a Zeiss Axioskop microscope coupled with a Zeiss AxioCam CCD camera. Images acquired with a ×40 objective and eyepieces of ×10 were recorded and manipulated using Zeiss AxioVision software. The localization of MAGP1A in living cells was studied by transient transfection of rat RFL-6 cells with a chimeric plasmid coding for full-length human MAGP1A or MAGP1A fused to GFP. We found that RFL-6 cells do not express MAGP1 endogenously, as we were unable to detect the expression of the protein with antibodies against MAGP1 (22.Crippes Trask B. Trask T.M. Broekelmann T. Mecham R.P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 1499-1507Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A) or its mRNA by Northern blot analysis or reverse transcription-coupled PCR (data not shown). Distribution patterns of MAGP1A-GFP were visualized by fluorescence microscopy at 48 and 72 h after transfection. These images show that MAGP1A-GFP was present in the ECM at both time points (Fig. 1B). The pattern of MAGP1-GFP fusion protein expression was similar to that of unmodified MAGP1 (Fig. 1C) or MAGP1 containing a V5 epitope tag (Fig. 1D), indicating that the presence of the GFP molecule had little effect on the ability of MAGP1 to associate normally with the ECM. Assessment of tropoelastin distribution in untransfected (Fig. 1E) and MAGP1-GFP-transfected (Fig. 1F) cells showed that MAGP1-GFP deposition did not alter the assembly of other essential matrix components. We previously reported the identification and characterization of two alternative transcripts coding for shortened versions of MAGP1 in human and mouse (16.Segade F. Broekelmann T. Pierce R. Mecham R.P. Matrix Biol. 2000; 19: 671-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The characteristics of the variants suggested that they might remain as intracellular proteins due to the internal deletion of significant structural features, such as a fragment of the signal peptide that includes the cleavage site. We transiently transfected RFL-6 cells with plasmids encoding GFP-tagged human MAGP1B and mouse MAGP1D to assess whether the proteins are secreted and associate with the matrix. At 48 h after transfection, there was no visible association of the GFP fusion proteins with the ECM (Fig. 2, B and C), although fluorescence indicative of cell transfection and GFP synthesis was clearly observed. In both cases, the chimeric proteins accumulated throughout the cytoplasm and did not localize with the endoplasmic reticulum or Golgi, suggesting that the variants were not secreted. This was confirmed by the absence of soluble human MAGP1B or mouse MAGP1D in the conditioned media from transfected cells as determined by Western blotting (data not shown). These results indicate that the absence of fluorescence associated with the ECM is due to the non-secretion of the alternative splice forms and not to an alteration in their structure that prevents them from binding matrix proteins. Although the transfection efficiencies of the human MAGP1B-GFP and mouse MAGP1D-GFP plasmids were similar to those obtained with MAGP1A-GFP and pEGFP-N1 (∼25–30% of the cells), we observed that cells expressing the alternative splice forms underwent morphological changes 48 h after transfection. Compared with cells expressing MAGP1A-GFP (Fig. 2A) or EGFP (Fig. 2D), human MAGP1B-GFP and mouse MAGP1D-GFP transfectants showed shrinkage of their cell membranes with retraction of the cytoplasm and a gradual decrease in size. Many cells contained vacuolar inclusions; and in those that were most probably dead and about to detach from the substrate, nuclear localization of the fusion protein was observed. At 4 days after transfection, most of the expressing cells had died and detached from the coverslips. We never observed a significant mortality in cells transfected with MAGP1-GFP (Fig. 2A) or EGFP-N1 (Fig. 2D) or with any of the other mutants we generated (see below). Therefore, a general effect on cell health of the overexpression of exogenous proteins can be safely ruled out. We speculate that cell mortality may be related to the role that the alternative forms play in vivo. Although a number of proteins have been shown to interact with MAGP1A (18.Finnis M.L. Gibson M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22817-22823Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 22.Crippes Trask B. Trask T.M. Broekelmann T. Mecham R.P. Mol. Biol.

Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28443-28449Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the critical domain responsible for the association of MAGP1 with the ECM has not been functionally defined. During our analysis of the coding sequence of mammalian MAGP1, we classified its exons into two classes according to their rate of non-synonymous (non-silent) substitution of codons (16.Segade F. Broekelmann T. Pierce R. Mecham R.P. Matrix Biol. 2000; 19: 671-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar): exons 3, 4, 7, and 8 are evolving more slowly than the average rate for the full sequence, whereas the remaining exons undergo sequence substitution at a much higher rate. Because a slow substitution rate of codons is usually related to the presence of selective constraints acting on the protein sequence, we focused our efforts on the slowly evolving exons in MAGP1 to specifically define their role in ECM binding. To test our hypothesis that two functional units might be present in exons 3 and 4 and exons 7 and 8, a series of deletion mutants derived from human MAGP1A fused to GFP were transfected into RFL-6 cells. The first deletion mutant, MAGP1ΔEx9-GFP (Fig. 3B), a C-terminal truncation of residues 151–183 encoded by exon 9, associated with the ECM, similar to the full-length protein (Fig. 3A). However, mutant MAGP1ΔEx(7–9)-GFP, in which the entire cysteine-rich domain of MAGP1A (amino acids 96–183) was deleted, was not visibly associated with the ECM (Fig. 3C), even though its secretion was not impaired by the deletion (data not shown). These results indicate that exon 9, coding for 7 of the 13 cysteine residues in MAGP1A, is not required for MAGP1 deposition onto the ECM. Similarly, the conserved region encoded by exons 3 and 4 that is reported to mediate the conversion of MAGP1A monomers into higher molecular mass complexes (10.Crippes Trask B. Broekelmann T. Ritty T.M. Trask T.M. Tisdale C. Mecham R.P. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 4372-4380Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) is not by itself capable of mediating the initial interaction of MAGP1 with the ECM. To test whether exons 7 and 8 are critical for the matrix deposition of the fusion protein, we constructed the MAGP1Ex(7+8)-GFP plasmid, containing the signal sequence fused to residues 96–150 of MAGP1A and GFP. Transfection of RFL-6 cells showed that MAGP1Ex(7+8)-GFP was deposited onto the matrix (Fig. 3D) and that the fluorescence levels associated with the matrix were consistently higher with MAGP1Ex(7+8)-GFP than those obtained with full-length MAGP1A-GFP. Moreover, the sequence encoded in exons 7 and 8 forms a functional unit because separate expression of exon 7 or 8 as a fusion protein with GFP (MAGP1Ex7-GFP or MAGP1Ex8-GFP, respectively) completely abolished the ECM-binding ability showed by MAGP1Ex(7+8)-GFP (Fig. 3, E and F). Taken together, our results identify a region (which we named the matrix-binding domain) in the C-terminal region of MAGP1A, translated from exons 7 and 8, that is critical and sufficient to direct the deposition of GFP onto the matrix (Fig. 3G). We believe that the MBD may represent the domain responsible for the initial interaction of MAGP1A with the ECM. The primary structure of the MAGP1 MBD contains 7 cysteine and 2 histidine residues (Fig. 4a), reminiscent of the zinc-binding cysteine-rich motifs involved in protein-protein interaction (24.Schwabe J.W. Klug A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 345-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). To identify the critical amino acids in the MBD that are responsible for ECM binding, particularly the cysteine and histidine residues, we constructed a battery of single residue mutants in which the targeted amino acids were substituted with alanine residues in the context of construct MAGP1Ex(7+8)-GFP. The results obtained with this series of mutants are summarized in Fig. 5. The mutagenesis of any of the 6 cysteines in the MBD entirely abrogated the deposition of the fusion protein onto the ECM. Similar results were obtained when 2 nearest-neighbor cysteines were simultaneously mutated (data not shown). We would expect that the substitution of 1 of the histidine amino acids would also cancel the association of the MBD with the ECM if those residues were involved in the coordination of a metal atom critical for function. We found, however, that the H111A and H144A mutants were equally efficient as the wild-type MBD construct in associating with the matrix (Fig. 5). Our data suggest that the functionality of the domain is dependent on the presence of the cysteines, possibly through the formation of inter- and intramolecular disulfide bridges that ensure the proper spatial conformation. MAGP2 is the second member of the MAGP family and contains a sequence that is similar to the MAGP1 MBD (25.Hatzinikolas G. Gibson M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29309-29314Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The region from exons 8 and 9 in MAGP2 (paralogous to exons 7 and 8 in MAGP1) contains 6 cysteines. At a position equivalent to cysteine 114 of human MAGP1, a hydrophobic amino acid is present in human MAGP2 (valine 101) (Fig. 4A). From our mutagenesis studies, we predicted that MAGP2 should be inactive in an ECM association assay in RFL-6 cells because a valine substituting for cysteine at that position is equivalent to our engineered inactive C114A mutant (Fig. 5). In transfected RFL-6 cells, the GFP fusion proteins containing full-length MAGP2 (MAGP2-GFP) or the putative MAGP2 MBD (MAGP2Ex(8+9)-GFP) were not deposited onto the ECM (Fig. 6, A and B), even at 72 h after transfection (data not shown). If valine 101 were responsible for the loss of ECM-binding activity of the domain, we speculated that changing Val101 to Cys should be able to restore its functionality. When the mutant protein MAGP2Ex(8+9)V101C-GFP was expressed in RFL-6 cells, it regained the ability to associate with the ECM (Fig. 6C), with a pattern and efficiency that were comparable to those obtained with the MAGP1 MBD construct MAGP1Ex(7+8)-GFP. We have previously reported that mammals possess a total of six variants of MAGP1 transcribed from the single copy MAGP1gene (16.Segade F. Broekelmann T. Pierce R. Mecham R.P. Matrix Biol. 2000; 19: 671-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). To study the fate of MAGP1 and its alternatively spliced forms, we generated chimeric proteins using the coding sequence of the appropriate variant fused to the coding sequence for GFP. As a suitable in vitro system to assay the subcellular localization, we chose the rat lung fibroblast cell line RFL-6, which we had characterized for the expression of microfibrillar components and their assembly into bona fide microfibrils (26.Crippes Trask B. Characterization of Microfibril-associated Glycoprotein-1 (MAGP-1) and Identification of its Interactions within the Extracellular Matrix.Ph.D. thesis. Washington University, St. Louis, MO1999Google Scholar). Because RFL-6 cells do not make endogenous MAGP1, they are optimal for the study of matrix association of heterologous MAGP1 and its derivatives. As we expected, the expression of MAGP1A in any of its tagged and untagged ve"

This slow activation mode developed over the course of minutes and was unique to NHE3 and the closely related isoform NHE5, but was not observed in NHE1 or NHE2. Activation of NHE3 was not due to increased density of exchangers at the cell surface, nor was it accompanied by detectable changes in phosphorylation. The association of NHE3 with the cytoskeleton, assessed by its retention in the detergent-insoluble fraction, was similarly unaffected by acidification. In contrast to the slow progressive activation elicited by acidification, deactivation occurred very rapidly upon restoration of the physiological pH.

To date, seven different NHE isoforms have been cloned, all of which are integral membrane proteins with multiple transmembrane domains and an extensive cytosolic carboxyl-terminal domain. NHE1 and NHE3 are by far the most widely studied isoforms. The former is expressed ubiquitously and, by mediating Na+/H+ exchange across the plasma membrane, contributes to the regulation of cytosolic pH and cell volume (2.Wakabayashi S. Shigekawa M. Pouyssegur J. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 51-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar). NHE3 is found in the brush border of epithelial cells in the kidney and gastrointestinal tract and is involved in the transepithelial (re)absorption of NaCl and, indirectly, HCO3− and water (4.Schultheis P.J. Clarke L.L. Meneton P. Miller M.L. Soleimani M. Gawenis L.R. Riddle T.M. Duffy J.J. Doetschman T. Wang T. Giebisch G. Aronson P.S. Lorenz J.N. Shull G.E. Nat.

N+/H+ exchangers intracellular pH 2′,7′-bis(2-carboxyethyl)-5(6)-carboxyfluorescein hemagglutinin phosphate-buffered saline 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid Because Na+/H+ exchange is electroneutral with a 1:1 stoichiometry, thermodynamic equilibrium is predicted to be attained when [H+]i/[H+]o = ([Na+]i/[Na+]o)·Ke, where Ke is the equilibrium constant and the subscripts i and o refer to intra- and extracellular, respectively (5.Grinstein S. Cohen S. Rothstein A. J. Gen. Physiol. 1984; 83: 341-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). In almost all cells, a steep inwardly directed Na+ gradient is maintained across the plasma membrane due to extrusion of Na+ by the Na+/K+-ATPase. Based on the concentrations recorded in most cases ([Na+]o being at least 10 times higher than [Na+]i), it is apparent that NHE could drive the intracellular pH (pHi) at least 1 unit above the external pH. Nevertheless, pHi rarely exceeds and is usually lower than the extracellular pH because NHE becomes virtually quiescent at pHi ≥7.2. This behavior has been attributed to the existence of an allosteric pH-sensitive site on the cytosolic aspect of NHE. The set point at which quiescence is dictated by this allosteric or “modifier” site is presumably intended to stabilize pHi near the physiological optimum level and to preclude deleterious alkalinization (6.Aronson P.S. Nee J. Suhm M.A. Nature. 1982; 299: 161-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar, 7.Grinstein S. Goetz J.D. Rothstein A. J. Gen. Physiol. 1984; 84: 585-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Although little is known about the molecular identity of the modifier site, the pH dependence of activation of NHE suggests that the rate of transport is modulated by protonation of one or more side chains of the protein. It has been postulated that the resulting change in surface potential may alter the local concentration of H+equivalents and thus their availability for the exchange reaction. Because protonation/deprotonation of side chains is expected to occur almost immediately after pH is altered, the effect of the modifier site has been tacitly assumed to occur instantaneously, providing rapid feedback and thereby accurate regulation of pHi. In the course of experiments using isolated brush-border membranes at subphysiological temperatures, we detected significant hysteresis in the inactivation of NHE3 (preliminary results are described in Ref. 8.Kinsella J.L. Heller P. Froehlich J.P. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1998; 76: 743-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). This slow responsiveness, which developed over the course of minutes, cannot be easily reconciled with the simple side chain protonation model described above. We therefore decided to investigate whether slow activation and/or inactivation transitions are observed in intact cell systems and to examine the underlying mechanism. To this end, we used porcine kidney LLC-PK1 cells, which are known to express endogenous NHE3 (9.Shugrue C.A. Obermuller N. Bachmann S. Slayman C.W. Reilly R.F. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1999; 10: 1649-1657Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, we compared the behavior of several isoforms of NHE expressed heterologously in antiport-deficient Chinese hamster cells. Our results revealed a novel mode of regulation that is unique to NHE3 and the related isoform NHE5 and that likely involves large conformational changes and/or interaction with other molecules. Nigericin, the acetoxymethyl ester of 2′,7′-bis(2-carboxyethyl)-5(6)-carboxyfluorescein (BCECF), and Alexa 488-conjugated donkey anti-mouse antibody were obtained from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR). Mouse anti-hemagglutinin (HA) antibodies were from BabCo (Berkeley, CA). 125I-Labeled goat IgG and [32P]orthophosphate were from ICN (Costa Mesa, CA). Isotonic Na+ medium contained mm 140 mm NaCl, 3 mm KCl, 1 mmMgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, and 20 mm HEPES (pH adjusted to 7.4 with Tris at room temperature). Na+-free solution was prepared by equimolar substitution with N-methyl-d-glucamine. Isotonic K+-rich medium had the same composition as Na+-rich medium, except that NaCl was replaced by KCl. LLC-PK1 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. For surface detection and immunoprecipitation experiments, LLC-PK1 cells were transfected with wild-type NHE3 containing three tandem copies of the influenza virus HA epitope (YPYDVPDYAS) in the first extracellular loop (between Arg38 and Phe39) as described previously (13.D'Souza S. Garcia-Cabado A. Yu F. Teter K. Lukas G. Skorecki K. Moore H.P. Orlowski J. Grinstein S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2035-2043Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). LLC-PK1 cells were transfected using FuGENE 6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) following the manufacturer's instructions. For selection of stable lines, cells were cotransfected with the pCMV plasmid (which contains the aminoglycoside phosphotransferase gene that confers resistance to G418), selected by limiting dilution cloning in the presence of 500 μg/ml G418, and screened by immunofluorescence for expression of HA-tagged NHE3 (NHE3′38HA3). Cells were maintained in 1:1 Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/nutrient mixture F-12 with 10% fetal bovine serum in an atmosphere containing 5% CO2. AP-1 is a cell line devoid of endogenous Na+/H+exchange activity that was isolated from WT5 Chinese hamster ovary cells as previously described (10.Rotin D. Grinstein S. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 257: C1158-C1165Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). NHE cDNA constructs were transfected into AP-1 cells by the calcium phosphate/cDNA coprecipitation technique, and stable clones were selected for survival by imposing acute NH4Cl-induced acid loads (11.Franchi A. Perucca-Lostanlen D. Pouyssegur J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 9388-9392Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 12.Orlowski J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16369-16377Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were maintained in α-minimal essential medium with 10% fetal bovine serum in an atmosphere containing 5% CO2. pHi was measured by microphotometry of the fluorescence emission of BCECF using dual-wavelength excitation. The activity of NHE was determined as the rate of Na+-induced pHi recovery after acid loading with NH4Cl. LLC-PK1 cells grown to confluence on 25-mm glass coverslips were incubated with 2 μg/ml BCECF/acetoxymethyl ester plus 15 mm NH4Cl; and after 10 min, the cells were washed with Na+-free solution. Na+/H+ exchange was then initiated by reintroduction of extracellular Na+ at the indicated times. Clusters of the cells adhering to the coverslip were selected for pHi measurements, whereas cells that formed domes were avoided because, in these, the Na+-induced pHi recovery likely occurred via basolateral NHE. To minimize the consequences of dye leakage from the cells, the chamber was continuously perfused at ≈1.0 ml/min using a gravity-driven system. The fluorescence of BCECF was measured and calibrated as described previously (13.D'Souza S. Garcia-Cabado A. Yu F. Teter K. Lukas G. Skorecki K. Moore H.P. Orlowski J. Grinstein S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2035-2043Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). The cellular buffering capacity was determined from the pHi changes observed in response to NH4Cl pulses imposed at various pHilevels. H+ (equivalent) flux rates were calculated by multiplying the rate of pHi recovery by the buffering capacity at the corresponding pH values. All procedures were performed at room temperature. LLC-PK1 cells were plated onto six-well plates and grown to subconfluence. We did not use confluent cells because of potential trapping of extracellular fluid under domes. Intracellular Na+ depletion was accomplished by incubating the cells in Na+-free solution. Intracellular Na+ content was determined by flame photometry (Model 443 photometer, Instrumentation Laboratory, Lexington, MA) using Li+ as an internal standard. After intracellular Na+ depletion, the cells were washed with ice-cold medium containing 300 mm sucrose and 10 mm HEPES/Tris (pH 7.4). The cells were scraped off with a rubber policeman into Li+ standard solution (Instrumentation Laboratory); the samples were frozen and thawed; insoluble material was sedimented; and the supernatant was used for measurement. Intracellular Na+content was normalized by the number of cells used. Cells were counted electronically with a Coulter Counter (Coulter Electronics, Hialeah, FL). LLC-PK1 cells stably expressing NHE3′38HA3 were plated onto glass coverslips and grown to confluence. The cells were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and, where indicated, acidified for 5 min with NH4Cl as described above before fixation for 20 min using 8% paraformaldehyde in ice-cold PBS. Following fixation, the cells were washed three times with PBS and incubated with 100 mmglycine in PBS for 10 min. The cells were next pre-blocked with 5% skimmed milk in PBS for 30 min and then incubated with anti-HA monoclonal antibody (1:1000 dilution) for 1 h. After washing three times to remove unbound antibody, the cells were incubated with Alexa 488-conjugated donkey anti-mouse antibody (1:1000 dilution) for 1 h, and the coverslips were mounted onto glass slides with mounting medium (Dako Corp., Carpinteria, CA). The detergent solubility of NHE3′38HA3 was assessed in transfected LLC-PK1 cells cultured in 35-mm dishes and grown to confluence. Where indicated, the cells were first acid-loaded to pH 6.4 as described above. The cells were then rinsed twice with ice-cold medium and extracted with 1 ml of ice-cold lysis medium containing 150 mm NaCl, 25 mm HEPES, 25 mm MES, 0.5 mm EGTA, and 8% protease inhibitor mixture (Complete, Roche Molecular Biochemical) plus 2 μm pepstatin and either 0.1% Triton X-100 or 1% digitonin. The pH of the medium was adjusted to either 6.4 or 7.4 as indicated. After swirling on ice for 6 min on an orbital shaker, the supernatant was removed and saved. The adherent material was washed with ice-cold PBS and scraped off with a rubber policeman into 1 ml of ice-cold PBS containing 0.1% SDS and 8% protease inhibitor mixture plus 2 μm pepstatin. Protein concentration was measured by the method of Ghosh et al.(14.Ghosh S. Gepstein S. Heikkila J.J. Dumbroff E.B. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 169: 227-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) and quantification by densitometry (AlphaImager, AlphaInnotech, Cannock, United Kingdom). Following addition of 5× concentrated Laemmli sample buffer, samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred onto nitrocellulose filters. Blots were blocked with 5% milk and exposed to primary antibody (anti-HA (1:5000) or anti-actin (1:250) antibody). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody was applied (1:5000 dilution), and immunoreactive bands were visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) and quantified by densitometry. To quantify surface NHE3 expression, LLC-PK1 cells stably expressing NHE3′38HA3 were plated onto six-well plates and grown to confluence. The cells were rinsed with PBS and, where specified, acidified for 5 min with NH4Cl as described above. The cells were next washed with ice-cold PBS, pre-blocked with 10% goat serum in PBS for 30 min on ice, and then incubated for 45 min on ice with anti-HA antibody (1:500 dilution) in medium with 10% goat serum. After washing four times to remove unbound antibody, the cells were incubated with 125I-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG (0.4 μCi/well) in medium with 10% goat serum on ice. After 60 min, cells were washed four times with ice-cold PBS to remove unbound radioactivity. The radiolabeled antibodies were eluted with 1 ml of 2m formic acid, and radioactivity was counted using a γ-counter (1282 Compu Gamma, Amersham Biosciences, Inc., Turku, Finland). Nonspecific binding of the radiolabeled antibodies, assessed by omitting primary antibodies, was subtracted. LLC-PK1cells stably expressing NHE3′38HA3 grown to confluence on 15-cm dishes were labeled for 4 h by incubation with 4 ml of phosphate-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.4 mCi of [32P]orthophosphate. After labeling, the cells were washed three times with PBS and, where specified, acidified with NH4Cl for 5 min as described above. To enrich the preparation in NHE3 prior to immunoprecipitation, we prepared brush-border membrane vesicles from the labeled LLC-PK1cells by the method of Brown et al. (15.Brown C.D. Bodmer M. Biber J. Murer H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 769: 471-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), with minor modifications. The cells were scraped off with a rubber policeman into 1 ml of ice-cold medium containing 300 mm mannitol, 5 mm NaF, 2 mm Na3VO4, 1% protease inhibitor (Sigma), and 10 mm HEPES/Tris (pH 7.4) and homogenized with a bath sonicator (Fisher Model 300, setting 60) for 5 min. Next, MgCl2 was added to a final concentration of 10 mm, followed by incubation for 30 min on ice and centrifugation for 15 min at 2300 × g. The supernatant was collected and subjected to centrifugation at 22,200 × g. The resulting pellet containing the brush-border vesicles was resuspended in 1 ml of radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (150 mm NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 50 mm NaF, 2 mmNa3VO4, 1% protease inhibitor, and 20 mm HEPES/Tris at pH 7.4 or 6.4) by drawing through a 26-gauge needle and shaken on a rotating rocker for 30 min at 4 °C. After centrifugation at 88,800 × g for 30 min to remove insoluble cellular debris, the supernatant was added to protein G-Sepharose beads (Pierce) that were pre-conjugated with anti-HA monoclonal antibody, and the suspension was shaken for 2 h at 4 °C. The beads were spun down and washed eight times with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer. Immunoprecipitated proteins were eluted by incubation in 50 μl of Laemmli sample buffer at 65 °C for 15 min. An aliquot of 40 μl of each sample was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and electrophoretically transferred to a Trans-Blot membrane (Bio-Rad). The relative amounts of NHE3 in the samples were determined by ECL and quantified using the AlphaImager. Once the enhanced chemiluminescence decayed, 32P signals from the same membranes were subsequently measured using a PhosphorImager and quantified using ImageQuant (Molecular Dynamics, Inc.). Experimental values are given as the means ± S.E. of the indicated number of determinations. Comparisons between two groups were made by either unpaired or paired Student's t tests, as appropriate. The time dependence of the activation of NHE3 was studied in LLC-PK1 cells by monitoring the Na+-induced recovery of pHifollowing an acid load. Controlled cytosolic acidification was imposed by the NH4Cl (15 mm) prepulse technique (16.Kapus A. Grinstein S. Wasan S. Kandasamy R. Orlowski J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23544-23552Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and Na+/H+ exchange was initiated when desired by addition of 140 mm Na+ to the medium. It is noteworthy that (i) in the absence of Na+, NHE-independent pHi recovery was negligible (0.003 pH units/min); and (ii) the acid loading was essentially complete at the time of addition of Na+ (Fig. 1A), so the rate of pH recovery was uncontaminated by an opposing tendency to acidify due to residual intracellular ammonium. Only in the case of the measurements made 1 min after removal of ammonium was a small acidification still apparent. This rate of acidification was measured in parallel experiments (0.011 mm/s) and was added to the determinations of NHE based on the net rate of alkalinization. Two measures were taken to ensure that the activity of NHE3 was assessed without contribution from NHE1, which is expressed in the basolateral membrane of LLC-PK1 cells (17.Reilly R.F. Hildebrandt F. Biemesderfer D. Sardet C. Pouyssegur J. Aronson P.S. Slayman C.W. Igarashi P. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 261: F1088-F1094PubMed Google Scholar). First, the cells were grown to confluence, and Na+ was added only apically. Second, 100 μm amiloride was added to selectively inhibit NHE1 (18.Orlowski J. Kandasamy R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19922-19927Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Under the conditions used (pHi 6.53 ± 0.03, n = 25), the Na+-induced pHirecovery was slow when the cells were acidified for only 1 min. However, the rate of alkalinization increased gradually as the period of acidification was lengthened (Fig. 1A). The open squares in Fig. 1C summarize the results of six experiments: the rate of Na+/H+ exchange increased progressively up to 5 min and decreased slowly thereafter. The maximal rate observed was 2-fold greater than the rate measured at 1 min. Shorter periods were not analyzed because the acid loading procedure was still ongoing before 1 min (see above). A limited number of experiments were also performed using opossum kidney cells, with similar results (data not shown). These findings indicate that the slow activation of Na+/H+ exchange is a widespread phenomenon and suggest that the observations in LLC-PK1 cells were attributable to NHE3 because opossum kidney cells express NHE3, but not NHE1 (19.Helmle-Kolb C. Montrose M.H. Murer H. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1990; 416: 615-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 20.Helmle-Kolb C. Counillon L. Roux D. Pouyssegur J. Mrkic B. Murer H. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1993; 425: 34-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The faster rate observed after prolonged acidification is likely to reflect increased activity of NHE3. However, it is conceivable that the cytosolic buffering power diminishes over time after acidification, resulting in a faster recovery at constant NHE activity. The latter possibility was explored using an exogenous ion exchanger. As shown in Fig. 1B, the pHi recovery induced by nigericin and high K+ solution was similar whether the ionophore was added 1 or 5 min after acidification was imposed. The nigericin-induced recovery averaged 0.05 ± 0.01 and 0.04 ± 0.01 mm/s at 1 and 5 min, respectively (Fig. 1C, closed squares). These observations rule out a reduction in buffering power and also other possible time-dependent artifacts in the recording system. Imposition of an acid load of variable duration required incubation in Na+-free medium for different periods of time. This may have resulted in variable intracellular Na+ contents at the time of assaying NHE. The observed time-dependent increase in activity may therefore have resulted from an increased driving force for forward Na+/H+ exchange or from stimulation of a Na+-sensitive G protein, as has been invoked for the regulation of NHE1 (21.Ishibashi H. Dinudom A. Harvey K.F. Kumar S. Young J.A. Cook D.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9949-9953Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). To analyze this possibility, cells were initially preincubated in Na+-free medium for 10 min and then subjected to acid loading and challenged with extracellular Na+. As illustrated in Fig. 2A, the rate of recovery after 1 min of acidification was not significantly different from that recorded in control cells in Fig. 1 (0.035 ± 0.003versus 0.034 ± 0.003 mm/s, respectively;p = 0.87). More importantly, the time-dependent acceleration of NHE3 activity persisted in the Na+-depleted cells: the rate of pH recovery was nearly 3-fold higher after 5 min than after 1 min (Fig. 2, A and B). To confirm that depletion of Na+ was not the mechanism underlying stimulation, we measured the intracellular content of this cation by flame photometry under all the conditions used. Omission of extracellular Na+ prior to the acid load reduced intracellular Na+ by 45% (from 44 to 20 mm). The magnitude of the depletion was not significantly different (52 ± 5 versus 45 ± 8%; p = 0.61) when Na+ removal was extended for 15 min, indicating that no substantive further depletion occurred during the acid loading period in Fig. 2. These results indicate that intracellular Na+depletion does not contribute to the time-dependent activation of NHE3. To analyze the effect of pHi on the kinetics of NHE3 activation (Fig. 3), various concentrations of NH4Cl were used during the prepulse. The time dependence of the activation was recorded at all the pHilevels that we measured (between 6.5 and 7.5), and in all cases, the differential between 1 and 5 min was ≥2-fold. Interestingly, when plotting efflux rate versus [H+]i(Fig. 3C), the data conformed to Michaelis-Menten kinetics when the acidification was imposed for 5 min (R2 = 0.781), but the fit was poorer after 1 min (R2 = 0.453). This observation suggests that a more complex process involving the time-dependent activation of NHE3 is ongoing at 1 min. If activation is complete by 5 min, only the expected pseudo first-order kinetics is noted. In native as well as in heterologous expression systems, NHE3 is present in at least two subcellular compartments: the plasma membrane and an endomembrane vesicular compartment that includes subapical/recycling endosomes (13.D'Souza S. Garcia-Cabado A. Yu F. Teter K. Lukas G. Skorecki K. Moore H.P. Orlowski J. Grinstein S. J. Biol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 8790-8798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). In opossum kidney cells, it was shown that chronic exposure to acidic solutions increases the activity of NHE3 and that such an increase is accompanied by mobilization of endomembrane NHE3 to the cell surface (24.Yang X. Amemiya M. Peng Y. Moe O.W. Preisig P.A. Alpern R.J. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: C410-C419Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It was therefore conceivable that the number of surface NHE3 molecules may change also during acute intracellular acidification. To assess this possibility, the abundance of cell-surface NHE3 was quantified by two methods. First, we generated a stable clone of LLC-PK1cells expressing an epitope-tagged form of NHE3. The epitope was placed in an extracellular loop to enable detection of surface-exposed NHE3 in intact cells (see Ref. 25.Kurashima K. Szabó E.Z. Lukacs G. Orlowski J. Grinstein S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20828-20836Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar for details). Immunostaining and fluorescence imaging analysis of intact (non-permeabilized) cells before and after acidification revealed no visible differences in the density or distribution of NHE3 (Fig. 4A). Second, to more accurately quantify surface NHE3, we used 125I-labeled antibodies. As shown in Fig. 4B, the surface density of NHE3 did not change following acidification. These results imply that the intrinsic activity, and not the number of exchangers, was increased when acid loading was sustained for 2–5 min. It is well established that NHE3 can become phosphorylated on Ser residues and that phosphorylation is accompanied by changes in transport activity (26.Moe O.W. Amemiya M. Yamaji Y. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 2187-2194Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 27.Kurashima K. Frank H. Cabado A.G. Szabóo E.Z. Grinstein S. Orlowski J. J. Biol.

Chem. 1999; 274: 3978-3987Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). In addition, Tyr phosphorylation may play a role in NHE3 regulation because stimulation of exchange by chronic acidification is associated with activation of c-Src (30.Yamaji Y. Amemiya M. Cano A. Preisig P.A. Miller R.T. Moe O.W. Alpern R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6274-6278Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). To define whether the more acute acid-induced stimulation reported here was similarly attributable to phosphorylation, cells were preincubated with [32P]orthophosphate and subjected to acidification. The cells were then immediately lysed in the cold, and NHE3 was immunoprecipitated. Quantitation of the radioactivity following analysis by SDS-PAGE revealed that the extent of phosphorylation of NHE3 was essentially identical before and after acidification for 5 min (Fig. 4B). Therefore, a mechanism other than direct phosphorylation must account for the observed time-dependent activation of NHE3. We previously demonstrated a functional interaction between NHE3 and the actin cytoskeleton in AP-1 cells (31.Kurashima K. D'Souza S. Szászi K. Ramjeesingh R. Orlowski J. Grinstein S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29843-29849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). In that study, the activity of the antiporter was modulated by the extent of actin polymerization, raising the possibility that the cytoskeleton may contribute to the pH-dependent effects reported here. To test this possibility, we examined the association of NHE3 with the detergent-insoluble fraction of LLC-PK1cells, which contains (part of) the actin cytoskeleton. Cells were left untreated or were acid-loaded to pH 6.4 as described for the determinations of exchange activity. Next, the cells were extracted in detergent at pH 6.4 or 7.4, and the soluble and insoluble fractions of NHE3 were quantified by immunoblotting (Fig. 5A). For reference, the total amounts of protein and actin solubilized were also quantified in the extracts. When using Triton X-100, only a fraction of NHE3 was solubilized, regardless of the pH of the extraction solution (27 ± 2 versus 31 ± 1%, pH 7.4 and 6.4, respectively). This implies that the majority of the exchangers are constitutively associated with the cytoskeleton. Unde"

AnkG107 lacks the entire ANK repeat domain and contains a 76-residue sequence near the COOH terminus. This sequence shares homology with COOH-terminal sequences of ankyrins-R and ankyrins-B, including the muscle-specific skAnk1. Despite widespread tissue expression of Ank3, the 76-residue sequence is predominantly detected in transcripts of skeletal muscle and heart, including both major 8- and 5.6-kb mRNAs of skeletal muscle. In 15-day-old rat skeletal muscle, antibodies against the 76-residue sequence localized to the sarcolemma and to the postsynaptic membrane and cross-reacted with three endogenous ankyrins-G, including one 130-kDa polypeptide that comigrated with in vitrotranslated AnkG107. In adult muscle, these polypeptides appeared significantly decreased, and immunofluorescence labeling was no more detectable. Green fluorescent protein-tagged AnkG107 transfected in primary cultures of rat myotubes was targeted to the plasma membrane. Deletion of the 76-residue insert resulted in additional cytoplasmic labeling suggestive of a reduced stability of AnkG107 at the membrane. Recruitment of the COOH-terminal domain to the membrane was much less efficient but still possible only in the presence of the 76-residue insert. We conclude that the 76-residue sequence contributes to the localization and is essential to the stabilization of AnkG107 at the membrane.

Ankyrins form a diverse family of modular polypeptides resulting from the expression of at least three genes, designated Ank1,Ank2, and Ank3 in rodents (ANK1,ANK2, and ANK3 in humans), and from tissue-specific alternative splicing of their products (ankyrins-R, ankyrins-B, and ankyrins-G, respectively) that display different subcellular localization (4.Lambert S. Bennett V. Curr. Top. Membr. 1996; 43: 129-145Crossref Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Most isoforms are composed of two highly conserved, membrane-binding (NH2-terminal) and spectrin-binding domains, and one variable COOH-terminal domain. The membrane-binding domain is composed of 24 tandem copies of 33-residue ANK repeats that provide sites of protein-protein interaction in numerous proteins (5.Bork P.

Tissue-specific alternative processing of Ank3transcripts results in distinct ankyrin-G isoforms with presumably related but distinct functions.

These isoforms contain extended “tail” sequences between the spectrin-binding and COOH-terminal domains. Ankyrins-G expressed in tissues other than brain lack the tail domain, and their molecular masses range from 100 to 220 kDa.

In skeletal muscle fibers, assembly of specialized membrane domains is a functional requirement, both at the cell surface (i.e. the postsynaptic membrane and the costameres) and in the cytoplasm, where Ca2+-regulated excitation-contraction coupling occurs.

Interestingly, the lack of Ank2 gene products in skeletal muscle fibers and cardiomyocytes of ankyrin-B(−/−) mice resulted in a congenital myopathy, abnormal properties of cardiac Na+ channels, and dramatic alterations in intracellular localization of Ca2+homeostasis proteins, namely the Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA) and the ryanodine receptors (24.Tuvia S.

Ank1 and Ank3gene products still expressed in these mice cannot rescue ankyrin-B(−/−) muscle cell, indicating that ankyrins have gene-specific functions. Taken together, these data and the diversity of ankyrin gene expression and localization suggest that ankyrins play key roles in the assembly and functioning of membrane domains in skeletal muscle fibers. However, most of these isoforms have not yet been identified at the molecular level. Currently, cloned ankyrins that are expressed in skeletal muscle include the Golgi-associated AnkG119 (15.Devarajan P. Stabach P.R. Mann A.S. Ardito T. Kashgarian M. Morrow J.S. J.

Subcellular distribution refers to immunolocalization data obtained by isoform-specific antibodies. References and corresponding isoforms, whenever known, are shown in parentheses. Here we report the cDNA cloning and characterization of a novel ankyrin isoform from rat skeletal muscle, which we name AnkG107, based on its predicted size of 106,911 Da and homology to the known isoforms of the ankyrin-G family. AnkG107 lacks the entire membrane-binding ANK repeat domain, displays highly conserved ankyrin-G spectrin-binding and COOH-terminal domains, and contains a unique among ankyrins-G 76-residue sequence near the COOH terminus, which shows homology with corresponding ankyrin-R and ankyrin-B COOH-terminal sequences and is predominantly expressed in heart and skeletal muscle. Endogenous ankyrins-G carrying this sequence displayed developmentally regulated expression and localized to the sarcolemma and to the postsynaptic membrane. Transfection of GFP1-tagged constructs expressing either the full-length molecule or AnkG107domains in rat myotubes in culture showed that this isoform is targeted to the plasma membrane apparently via the spectrin-binding domain. Moreover, these experiments strongly suggested that the muscle-specific 76-residue sequence is required for the stabilization of AnkG107 at the membrane. All molecular procedures were carried out using standard methods (30.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). An oligo(dT) and random primed rat skeletal muscle 5′-stretch plus λgt10 cDNA library (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) was double screened by plaque hybridization of nylon filters (Nytran-Plus; Schleicher & Schuell) using as probes two random primed32P-labeled (Rediprime system; Amersham Biosciences, Inc.)Ank3 cDNA fragments from the spectrin-binding (bp 229–1103) and COOH-terminal (bp 1778–2255) domains, previously amplified by RT-PCR from rat skeletal muscle total RNA (PCR A and B, respectively, in Ref. 23.Kordeli E. Ludosky M-A. Deprette C. Frappier T. Cartaud J. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 2197-2207Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Hybridization was performed at 65 °C overnight, and posthybridization washes were at a maximum stringency of 0.2× SSC, 65 °C. cDNA inserts from clones positive to both probes were subcloned into the plasmid vector pBluescript IISK(+) (Stratagene) and sequenced (Applied Biosystems), leading to identification of one full-length clone, λ21, that contained Ank3 sequences. Computer-assisted searches of amino acid sequence homology were performed utilizing FASTA (31.Pearson W.R. Lipman D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2444-2448Crossref PubMed Scopus (9393) Google Scholar) and BLAST (32.Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (71456) Google Scholar) programs. Ank3domain-specific cDNA probes were prepared by standard PCRs using as template the rat skeletal muscle cDNA clone λ21 for the spectrin-binding domain (bp 62–793) and 76-aa insert (bp 2633–2860) and a rat brain Ank3 cDNA clone kindly provided by Dr. S. Lambert (University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, MA) for the membrane-binding and COOH-terminal (corresponding to bp 2255–2921 without insert) domains. The locations of the hybridization probes are illustrated in Fig. 3B. PCR products were gel-purified (Qiagen) and 32P-labeled using random primed DNA synthesis (Rediprime system; Amersham Biosciences). The 228-bp PCR product encoding the 76-aa insert was sequenced to confirm its identity. Total RNA was isolated from adult rat hind limb skeletal muscle using the guanidinium thiocyanate/phenol/chloroform method (RNA Plus; Bioprobe Systems) and enriched in poly(A+) RNA by oligo(dT) chromatography (30.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). 20 μg of partially purified poly(A+) RNA were fractionated in 0.8% formaldehyde/agarose gel and transferred to nylon filters (Nytran-plus; Schleicher & Schuell). After fixation by ultraviolet light (UV cross-linker; Stratagene), filters were hybridized with rat Ank3 domain-specific cDNA probes and washed at 68 °C with 0.2× SSC, 0.1% SDS, before autoradiography. A rat multiple tissue Northern blot (CLONTECH) was first hybridized with cDNA probe encoding the 76-aa insert and then stripped and probed with the spectrin-binding domain cDNA probe. Hybridizations were performed at 68 °C overnight, and posthybridization washes were at a maximum stringency of 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS, 50 °C. cDNA fragments encoding the full-length AnkG107, the spectrin-binding domain (AnkG107Sp-b; first 590 aa), and the COOH-terminal domain (AnkG107Cter; aa 591–960) were amplified by PCR using the clone λ21 as a template and primers carrying EcoRI sites. A rat brain Ank3 cDNA clone was used to PCR-amplify the COOH-terminal domain lacking the 76-aa insert (AnkG107CterΔ76aa). PCR fragments were confirmed by DNA sequencing and introduced into the EcoRI site of either pcDNA3 vector (Invitrogen), or pEGFP-N1 vector (CLONTECH) under the control of the cytomegalovirus promoter while keeping in-frame with the downstream enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP). The cDNA construct of the full-length AnkG107 lacking the 76-aa insert (AnkG107Δ76aa-GFP) was obtained by replacing the COOH-terminal domain-containing EcoRV-KpnI fragment of construct AnkG107-GFP with the corresponding fragment of construct AnkG107CterΔ76aa-GFP. To raise antibodies against rat skeletal muscle ankyrins-G, a cDNA fragment (bp 62–793) was amplified by PCR using the λ21 clone as template and subcloned into vector pGEX-2T (Amersham Biosciences) to generate a 53-kDa fusion protein containing the NH2-terminal portion of glutathione S-transferase and amino acids 7–250 of the AnkG107 spectrin-binding domain. The recombinant fusion protein was expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3)pLysS cells and affinity-purified using glutathione-Sepharose beads according to the manufacturer's directions (Amersham Biosciences). To avoid proteolytic fragments, the affinity-purified polypeptides were applied to polyacrylamide SDS gels, and the band containing the full-length fusion protein was cut out of the gel and injected into rabbits. The resulting antiserum (anti-ankGSpbd) was affinity-purified using fusion protein coupled to cyanogen bromide-activated Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences). Antibodies against the AnkG107 76-residue insert were raised in rabbits against two peptides corresponding to amino acid residues 864–878 and 925–939 (see Fig. 1) (Eurogentec). The peptides represented sequences not included in the region of homology with the other ankyrin genes. Specific antibodies (anti-AnkG76aa) were affinity-purified against the antigenic peptides immobilized on HiTrap N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS)-activated columns (Amersham Biosciences). In vitrotranscription and translation were carried out in TNT-coupled rabbit reticulocyte lysate systems (Promega) according to the manufacturer's protocols, using the pcDNA3-AnkG107 construct. Products were resolved by SDS-PAGE electrophoresis and revealed by Western blot analysis. In control experiments, an aliquot was removed in the beginning of the reaction and analyzed by Western blot analysis; alternatively, in vitro translation was performed with antisense AnkG107 cDNAs. Both controls provided identical results. Primary cultures of mammalian skeletal muscle cells were initiated from neonatal myogenic cells obtained by trypsinization of muscle pieces from hind limbs of 1–3-day-old rats, as previously reported (33.Cognard C. Constantin B. Rivet-Bastide M. Imbert N. Besse C. Raymond G. Development. 1993; 117: 1153-1161Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For 3 days following plating, cells were maintained in growth medium consisting of Ham's F-12 medium (Invitrogen) with 10% heat-inactivated horse serum (Invitrogen), 10% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen), and 1% antibiotics. Myoblasts underwent myogenesis in differentiation medium. After 48 h of culture, differentiation medium containing Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 5% heat-inactivated horse serum was used to promote the formation of myotubes, which occurs within 15–18 h. The various AnkG107 cDNA constructs were transfected into the myoblasts using the Effectene Reagent kit (Qiagen, Courtaboeuf, France) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Myoblasts were cultured for 36 h on glass coverslips (50 × 104 cells) in growth medium and then rinsed twice in serum-free medium (Opti-MEM; Invitrogen) and transfected with 1 μg of plasmid cDNA per 35-mm plastic dish. Following a 16-h incubation, the transfection medium was replaced with fresh complete growth medium. Pieces of 15-day-old and adult rat extensor digitorum longus (EDL), soleus, and sternomastoid skeletal muscles were excised, rapidly frozen in liquid nitrogen, and ground into a powder. Tissue powder was added to boiling SDS-PAGE sample buffer containing 125 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 15% SDS, 20% glycerol, and 10% β-mercaptoethanol, homogenized, and passed through a 26-gauge needle. Samples were rapidly centrifuged, and the supernatant was used in SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis, as previously described (23.Kordeli E. Ludosky M-A. Deprette C. Frappier T. Cartaud J. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 2197-2207Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 4-day-old myotubes in culture were washed in TBS (20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EGTA, 2 mm MgCl2) and lysed on ice with cold radioimmune precipitation buffer consisting of 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 1% Tween 20, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 10% glycerol supplemented with 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1% aprotinin, and 1% protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma). Homogenates of myotubes were then sonicated and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot as previously described (23.Kordeli E. Ludosky M-A. Deprette C. Frappier T. Cartaud J. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 2197-2207Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). When the same transfer membrane was probed with two antibodies, the first antibody was stripped by incubation in Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 0.1 mβ-mercaptoethanol for 1 h at 57 °C. EDL and diaphragm skeletal muscles were removed by dissection from 15-day-old and adult Sprague-Dawley rats and immediately fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde, 0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, for 1 h at 4 °C. Fixed tissue was cut to small blocks, infused with increasing sucrose solutions (0.5–2.1 m in PBS (20 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl), and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Semithin (0.5–1-μm) cryosections of muscle fibers were immunolabeled for indirect immunofluorescence with primary antibodies diluted at 2–5 μg/ml as previously described (23.Kordeli E. Ludosky M-A. Deprette C. Frappier T. Cartaud J. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 2197-2207Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Monoclonal antibodies to the Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA1) were from Affinity Bioreagents. Fluorescein isothiocyanate- and Cy3-conjugated secondary antibodies were from Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories (West Grove, PA). Fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated α-bungarotoxin (1 μg/ml; Sigma) was used to label acetylcholine receptors in the postsynaptic membrane. Micrographs were taken with a Leica DMR microscope equipped with a CCD camera (Princeton Laboratories). Images were acquired, pseudocolored, and merged using the MetaView Imaging System (Universal Imaging Corporation, West Chester, PA) and arranged using Adobe Photoshop 5.0. 4-day-old myotubes in culture were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in TBS for 20 min at room temperature and either directly observed for GFP fluorescence or permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100/TBS for 10 min and labeled for indirect immunofluorescence with primary antibodies diluted at 2–5 μg/ml. RRX-conjugated secondary antibodies were from Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories. Samples were analyzed by confocal laser-scanning microscopy (Bio-Rad MRC 1024 ES equipped with an argon/krypton laser) using an inverted microscope (Olympus IX70, Tokyo, Japan). The relative intensities of cytoplasmic and cortical GFP fluorescence were measured and scaled on 256 levels along transversal lines crossing the xy plane of the confocal optical section. Line intensity profiles were obtained with Lasersharp Processing software (Bio-Rad) and analyzed by a ratiometric method as follows. For each ratio, the mean cortical fluorescence intensity was obtained by averaging measurements at two different intersections of the line with the periphery of the myotube. The mean intensity of the homogeneous cytoplasmic labeling was directly calculated by the software from values measured inside a square region of interest devoid of cytoplasmic clusters. For comparison, the ratio of mean cortical over mean cytoplasmic fluorescence intensities (Fcortex/Fcytoplasm) was calculated and reported o"

We have been interested in enzymatic mechanisms from which organisms have evolved to limit the accumulation of isomerized and racemized aspartyl residues, which form spontaneously from normal l-aspartic acid and l-asparagine residues within proteins as they age. Much attention has been directed at understanding the action of thel-isoaspartate(d-aspartate)O-methyltransferase or protein l-isoaspartyl methyltransferase (PIMT)1 (EC 2.1.1.77). PIMT is an enzyme that recognizes altered aspartyl residues in proteins and polypeptides and drives their eventual conversion to normall-aspartyl residues (1Young A.L. Carter W.G. Doyle H.A.

A. 2001; 98: 14814-14818Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). In the best-characterized pathway, a methyl group is transferred fromS-adenosyl-l-methionine (AdoMet) to form a methyl ester on the α-carboxyl group of an l-isoaspartyl residue. Subsequent nonenzymatic reactions result in rapidl-succinimide formation and hydrolysis, which generates some “repaired” l-aspartyl residues as well as somel-isoaspartyl residues, which can then enter the cycle again for eventual conversion to the normal peptide linkage. PIMTs have been highly conserved during evolution and are found in almost all eucaryotic cells as well as in most archaebacteria and most Gram-negative eubacteria (4Kagan R.M. McFadden H.J. McFadden P.N. O'Connor C. Clarke S. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1997; 117: 379-385Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 5Ichikawa J.K. Clarke S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 358: 222-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Recently, three-dimensional structures have been determined for PIMT from the hyperthermophilic eubacterium Thermotoga maritima(6Skinner M.M. Puvathingal J.M. Walter R.L. Friedman A.M. Structure Fold Des. 2000; 8: 1189-1201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (51) Google Scholar) and the thermophilic archaebacterium Pyrococcus furiosus(7Griffith S.C. Sawaya M.R. Boutz D.R. Thapar N. Katz J.E. Clarke S. Yeates T.O. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 313: 1103-1116Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). With the exception of a C-terminal domain apparently unique to theT. maritima enzyme, these enzymes have similar amino acid sequences and a similar three-dimensional fold (5Ichikawa J.K. Clarke S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 358: 222-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). For the P. furiosus enzyme, the crystal structures of AdoMet-liganded and isoaspartyl peptide-liganded forms have revealed how the enzyme can recognize a wide variety of damaged l-isoaspartyl andd-aspartyl residues while excluding normall-aspartyl residues (7Griffith S.C. Sawaya M.R. Boutz D.R. Thapar N. Katz J.E. Clarke S. Yeates T.O. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 313: 1103-1116Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). However, despite their sequence similarities, the kinetic properties and substrate specificities of the enzymes from various species are distinct. For example, the T. maritima enzyme is unable to methylate polypeptides containingd-aspartyl residues (5Ichikawa J.K. Clarke S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 358: 222-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), whereas the P. furiosusenzyme is able to recognize such racemized residues (8Thapar N. Griffith S.C. Yeates T.O. Clarke S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1058-1065Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). With an interest in mammalian aging, efforts have been focused on understanding the three-dimensional structure and substrate specificity of the human form of the enzyme. A particularly interesting puzzle is why the human and P. furiosus enzymes have the ability to also repair methylated d-aspartyl residues and why these enzymes also appear to have a considerably higher affinity forl-isoaspartyl residues than do many plant and eubacterial enzymes (9Thapar N. Clarke S. Protein Expression Purif. 2000; 20: 237-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The human enzyme is produced in two alternatively spliced forms that have distinct C termini (10MacLaren D.C. Kagan R.M. Clarke S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 185: 277-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 11Potter S.M. Johnson B.A. Henschen A. Aswad D.W. Guzzetta A.W. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 6339-6347Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). There is also a widespread genetic polymorphism that results in the presence of either a valine or isoleucine residue at position 119 (12DeVry C.G. Clarke S. J. Hum. Genet. 1999; 44: 275-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The human PIMT was cloned, expressed, and purified (13Maclaren D.C. Clarke S. Protein Expression Purif. 1995; 6: 99-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), and subsequent crystallization screenings were performed in the presence of an acidic solution that was saturated with respect to dithiothreitol and AdoHcy as described previously (14Redinbo M.

The best crystals were grown from a solution of 0.2m MgAc, 0.1 m cacodylate, pH 6.5, and 20% polyethylene glycol 8000. Data were collected in 1° oscillations using one cryo-cooled crystal at beamline X8C at the National Synchrotron Light Source. A data set was collected to 2.1-Å resolution and processed using DENZO and SCALEPACK (17Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 27: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38436) Google Scholar). The crystal belongs to the monoclinic space group P21 witha = 48.0 Å, b = 53.7 Å,c = 49.0 Å, β = 115.6°, and one molecule in the asymmetric unit. In the initial data processing, an ice-ring caused many reflections to be discarded, resulting in an acceptable value for R sym (5.3%) but poor coverage (completeness = 82.5%). This incompleteness hindered structure determination. By reintegrating the data with a higher threshold for background noise, the number of reflections increased from 10,970 to 12,512, and the completeness andR sym were increased to 94.7 and 7.4% overall. In the outermost resolution shell, the corresponding values were 75.0 and 25.6%. The structure was solved by molecular replacement with the program EPMR (18Kissinger C.R. Gehlhaar D.K. Fogel D.B.

After three rounds of model building and refinement, water molecules were inserted into the model, and the refinement was converged after an additional three cycles.

The solvent and protein regions were assigned dielectric values of 78 and 4, respectively, and the Debye constant was taken to be 0.128 Å−1. Asp, Glu, Arg, and Lys residues were assigned their full charges. The linear finite difference equations were solved by iteration using simultaneous overrelaxation and Chebyshev acceleration (26Press W.H. Teukolsky S.A. Vettering W.T. Flannery B.P.

The values for the resulting electrostatic potential at particular points of interest were obtained by trilinear interpolation on the grid. The human PIMT enzyme folds as a doubly wound α/β/α sandwich structure as expected for this superfamily of enzymes (27Schluckebier G. O'Gara M. Saenger W. Cheng X. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 247: 16-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar, 28Fauman E.B. Blumenthal R.M. Cheng X. Cheng X. Blumenthal R.M.

As recently reported in the structures from T. maritima (6Skinner M.M. Puvathingal J.M. Walter R.L. Friedman A.M. Structure Fold Des. 2000; 8: 1189-1201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (51) Google Scholar) and P. furiosus (7Griffith S.C. Sawaya M.R. Boutz D.R. Thapar N. Katz J.E. Clarke S. Yeates T.O. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 313: 1103-1116Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), β-strands 6 and 7 are rearranged relative to the classical Rossman fold in what is now a familiar trademark of the PIMT enzymes. The labeling of secondary structural elements is shown in Fig.1 A illustrating the central α/β/α motif along with additional N-terminal α-helices and one C-terminal α-helix. It has been reported that the bovine enzyme contains a disulfide bond linking Cys-42 to Cys-94 (29Henzel W.J. Stults J.T. Hsu C.A. Aswad D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15905-15911Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the structure reported here, those residues are 20 Å apart, suggesting that no disulfide bond exists in the native enzyme, and that the formation of such a disulfide may occur during the processing of tryptic peptides for analysis. The structure of human PIMT is shown in the same orientation in Fig. 1 B along with the aligned PIMT structures from T. maritima (1DL5) andP. furiosus (1JG3) with root mean square differences for the aligned C-α atoms of 1.4 and 0.9 Å, respectively. There are a few notable features that distinguish the human PIMT structure from those structures reported recently from other organisms. In the human enzyme, the C-terminal part of the chain takes a different course. Also in the human enzyme, the loop following α-helix B contains a short α-helix not found in the two previously reported structures (Fig.2 C). Additional minor variations are apparent in the loop regions before and after β-strand 6. An inspection of the crystal structure surprisingly revealed three charged amino acid residues (Asp-83, Arg-36, and Asp-109) essentially buried in the protein interior. Buried charges are relatively rare because of the energetic cost of desolvating a charge and moving it into the protein interior where the dielectric value is much lower than it is in the aqueous solvent. When buried charges do occur, the low dielectric value can produce significant electrostatic effects. The occurrence in this enzyme of three buried charges seems especially unusual. These charged residues are also relatively well conserved across the PIMT family of enzymes, further implicating them in some functional role. Although the charged residues are also present in the other two recently reported PIMT structures (Asp-97, Arg-48, and Glu-121 in P. furiosus and Glu-81, Arg-27, and Glu-107 inT. maritima), the electrostatic effects of these residues were not discussed in earlier analyses. The buried protein charges are especially interesting in view of the charged nature of the reactive groups; the cofactor bears a sulfonium, and the polypeptide substrates bear an attacking carboxylate. It may also be relevant that the reaction is accompanied by a neutralization of the charges on both reactive groups. Because all three buried charges lie in the vicinity of the active site and the cofactor binding site, they might make important contributions to the energetics of binding or catalysis. The electrostatic potential was calculated (see “Experimental Procedures”) and examined in detail at the positions that would be occupied by the sulfonium and the isoaspartyl substrate carboxylate in a productive complex. The contributions to the electrostatic potential were included from the protein as well as from charged groups on the AdoMet cofactor excluding the sulfonium charge itself. The protein charge closest to the reactive groups is Asp-109 (5.6 Å). As a result, the protein makes a significant net negative contribution to the potential experienced by the charged reactive groups in the active site. In units of kBT per elementary charge, the protein produces a very high electrostatic potential of −18 kBT at the sulfonium and −6 kBT at the carboxylate. Mutagenesis experiments could help clarify the possible roles of buried charges in binding and catalysis, but the electrostatic calculations already provide some clues. It is noteworthy that the electrostatic potential difference at the two reactive charged groups does not appear to specifically promote the chemical step (methyl transfer). In fact, such an electrostatic driving force would probably be unproductive at this point in the reaction mechanism, because the reaction is energetically favorable as it is even in the unbound state. Rather, the electrostatic contributions from the protein may be serving to help bind the charged AdoMet form of the cofactor by partially compensating for the significantly unfavorable energy associated with binding and desolvating its charged sulfonium in the buried active site cleft. Given the extraordinary burial of the cofactor, it seems likely that the rate-limiting steps in the reaction cycle could involve cofactor binding or release. The strong electrostatic interactions between buried charges on the protein and the cofactor could play important roles in those steps of the reaction cycle. A proline residue conserved in the active site of archael and eucaryotic enzymes may explain the ability of these enzymes to catalyze methylation ofd-Asp more readily than the eubacterial enzymes. One of the recently reported structures (7Griffith S.C. Sawaya M.R. Boutz D.R. Thapar N. Katz J.E. Clarke S. Yeates T.O. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 313: 1103-1116Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) from P. furiosus was determined in the presence of a polypeptide substrate, VYP(l-isoAsp)HA. This structural complex provides a framework for understanding the substrate specificities of the enzymes from various sources. l-IsoAsp residues can be methylated by PIMT from all three organisms, whereas the d-Asp amino acid can be methylated by PIMT from human and P. furiosus(8Thapar N. Griffith S.C. Yeates T.O. Clarke S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1058-1065Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) but not from T. maritima (5Ichikawa J.K. Clarke S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 358: 222-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). PIMT from human andP. furiosus both have a proline in a key position (Pro-49/Pro-65) at which PIMT from T. maritima is replaced by a valine (Val-45). When the structure of thel-isoAsp polypeptide substrate visualized in the P. furious structure is overlaid onto the other two protein structures, no steric clashes are seen with either the human or theT. maritima enzyme (Fig. 2 A). Contrasting results are obtained when a similar analysis is performed with ad-Asp-containing polypeptide, which was modeled earlier on the basis of the l-isoAsp structure (7Griffith S.C. Sawaya M.R. Boutz D.R. Thapar N. Katz J.E. Clarke S. Yeates T.O. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 313: 1103-1116Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The analysis suggests that the carbonyl group of the d-Asp would clash with CG2 in Val-45 in the structure from T. maritima(Fig. 2 B) but not with the equivalently positioned proline in human and P. furiosus. The idea that residue 45 plays a key role in substrate specificity could be tested by mutagenesis. Counter to this argument, a proline residue is present in the nematode enzyme, which does not recognize d-aspartyl residues. Thus, other factors may also be important for the ability of the human andP. furiosus enzymes to recognize d-aspartyl residues with high efficiency. Because of a genetic polymorphism in Caucasian populations, two alternate alleles of the isoaspartyl methyltransferasePCMT1 gene (on chromosome 6) lead to the production of enzymes containing either a valine or isoleucine residue at position 119 (12DeVry C.G. Clarke S. J. Hum. Genet. 1999; 44: 275-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The presence of the isoleucine residue is associated with increased thermal stability of the enzyme, whereas the presence of the valine residue is associated with higher apparent affinity for protein, but not peptide, methyl-accepting substrates (12DeVry C.G. Clarke S. J. Hum. Genet. 1999; 44: 275-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In the human methyltransferase structure reported here, Val-119 is found to be almost completely exposed. The residue is located on the opposite side of the molecule from the methylation active site, so it is not immediately clear how the change from a valine to an isoleucine residue can affect the affinity for protein substrates. However, the larger isoleucine residue would be expected to form a hydrophobic interaction with Leu-130 located in α-helix 7 and might thereby increase the stability of the protein (Fig. 2 C). In addition to the genetic polymorphism, an alternative splicing of the human PCMT1 gene transcript in most tissues leads to two electrophoretic variants of the enzyme (10MacLaren D.C. Kagan R.M. Clarke S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 185: 277-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 11Potter S.M. Johnson B.A. Henschen A. Aswad D.W. Guzzetta A.W. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 6339-6347Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). These products differ at the C terminus by the presence of WK or DEL as the terminal amino acid sequence. In the structure seen here, clear electron density is not observed for the C-terminal residues after 224, and it appears that these residues probably project from the enzyme surface.

In bacteria, carbon catabolite repression is a key regulatory mechanism allowing a rapid regulation of many gene expressions in response to the availability of metabolizable carbon sources (1.Saier M.H. Chauvaux S. Deutscher J. Reizer J. Ye J.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 267-271Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Hence, recent global gene expression analysis in Bacillus subtilis showed that about 10% of all genes are submitted to glucose regulation (2.Moreno M.S. Schneider B.L. Maile R.R. Weyler W. Saier M.H. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 39: 1366-1381Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). In low G+C Gram-positive bacteria, this phenomenon is essentially controlled by a reversible phosphorylation of the histidine-containing protein (HPr) 1The abbreviations used are: HPrhistidine-containing proteinCrhcatabolite repression HPrFBPfructose 1,6-bisphosphateHprK/PHPr kinase/phosphatasemant2′(3′)-N-methylanthraniloylPEPCKphosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase on its Ser-46 residue, which mediates its interaction with a transcriptional regulator, the catabolite control protein A (3.Deutscher J. Kuster E. Bergstedt U. Charrier V. Hillen W. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 15: 1049-1053Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). A HPr-like protein, Crh (for catabolite repression HPr), was discovered in B. subtilis, and it was shown to be involved as well in carbon catabolite repression by a similar phosphorylation of its Ser-46 residue (4.Galinier A. Haiech J. Kilhoffer M.C. Jaquinod M. Stulke J. Deutscher J. Martin-Verstraete I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8439-8444Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). The long search for the enzyme responsible for HPr or Crh phosphorylation ended lately thanks to the B. subtilis sequencing program, with the identification of its encoding hprK gene (5.Galinier A. Kravanja M. Engelmann R. Hengstenberg W. Kilhoffer M.C. Deutscher J. Haiech J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1823-1828Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 6.Reizer J. Hoischen C.

Genomic programs have since shown that this gene is present not only in most Gram-positive bacteria but also in some pathogenic Gram-negative species. Because disruption of the hprK gene led to severe growth defects in Staphylococcus xylosus (7.Huynh P.L. Jankovic I. Schnell N.F. Bruckner R. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 1895-1902Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), the corresponding proteins in pathogenic bacteria might be potential targets for new antimicrobial therapies. histidine-containing protein catabolite repression HPr fructose 1,6-bisphosphate HPr kinase/phosphatase 2′(3′)-N-methylanthraniloyl phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase Biochemical characterization of the B. subtilisenzyme revealed that it is a homo-oligomer that displays positive cooperativity especially for the binding of its allosteric activator, the fructose 1,6-bisphosphate (8.Jault J.M.

Also, this enzyme is bifunctional, capable of a slow dephosphorylation of Ser(P)-HPr or Ser(P)-Crh, and has therefore been called HPr kinase/phosphatase (HprK/P) (9.Kravanja M. Engelmann R. Dossonnet V. Bluggel M. Meyer H.E. Frank R. Galinier A. Deutscher J. Schnell N. Hengstenberg W. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 59-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Concerning its functioning at the molecular level, HprK/P appeared unrelated to the classical eukaryotic protein kinases since it does not possess the typical signatures found in this family (5.Galinier A. Kravanja M. Engelmann R. Hengstenberg W. Kilhoffer M.C. Deutscher J. Haiech J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1823-1828Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 6.Reizer J. Hoischen C.

Instead, it contains a Walker A-motif (or P-loop) commonly found in ATPases or GTPases but also in some kinases such as adenylate kinase (10.Walker J.E. Saraste M. Runswick M.J. Gay N.J. EMBO J. 1982; 1: 945-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (4268) Google Scholar, 11.Saraste M. Sibbald P.R. Wittinghofer A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 430-434Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1754) Google Scholar). The recently solved three-dimensional structure of Lactobacillus casei HprK/P confirms that this loop adopts a conformation similar to that found in adenylate kinase, but it failed to identify any closer homologues based on a global comparison of structures (12.Fieulaine S. Morera S. Poncet S. Monedero V. Gueguen-Chaignon V. Galinier A. Janin J. Deutscher J. Nessler S. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3917-3927Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, we show here that HprK/P bears a significant, although restricted structural homology with another apparently unrelated phosphotransferase, the phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK), which catalyzes the decarboxylation and phosphorylation of oxaloacetate to form phosphoenolpyruvate (13.Matte A. Tari L.W. Goldie H. Delbaere L.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8105-8108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). This local structural homology is supported by biochemical evidence, indicating that both enzymes phosphorylate their respective substrate according to a similar catalytic mechanism. Overall, this suggests that both enzymes have evolved from a common ancestor. Plasmid pAG4 (5.Galinier A. Kravanja M. Engelmann R. Hengstenberg W. Kilhoffer M.C. Deutscher J. Haiech J. Proc. Natl.

Gronenborn B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 5404Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar), and the presence of the correct mutations were verified by DNA sequencing. HprK/P wild-type, or mutants and the protein substrate Crh were purified as previously described (4.Galinier A. Haiech J. Kilhoffer M.C. Jaquinod M. Stulke J. Deutscher J. Martin-Verstraete I. Proc.

The reaction mixture was incubated for 15 min at 37 °C. The digestion was stopped by adding an equal volume of electrophoresis loading buffer to the assay mixtures and by heating for 5 min at 80 °C before applying the samples to a 15% sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide electrophoresis gel. A 20-μl phosphorylation mixture contained 30 μm Crh, 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm FBP, 0.5 mm ATP, and HprK/P (0.4 or 5 μm). A 20-μl dephosphorylation mixture contained 30 μm Ser(P)-Crh, 1 μm HprK/P, 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, and 10 mm MgCl2. The phosphorylation and the dephosphorylation mixtures were incubated at 37 °C for 10 and 60 min, respectively. Both phosphorylation and dephosphorylation experiments were stopped by adding 100 mm EDTA to the assay mixtures. The samples were then loaded onto a non-denaturing 12.5% polyacrylamide gel as described previously (8.Jault J.M. Fieulaine S. Nessler S. Gonzalo P. Di Pietro A. Deutscher J. Galinier A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1773-1780Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The interaction between HprK/P wild type or mutants and Crh was monitored on a BIAcoreTM1000 upgraded biosensor system (Biacore AB, Uppsala, Sweden) after covalent coupling of Crh to the surface of CM5 sensorchip through its amino group and according to the manufacturer's instructions. HprK/P was injected at a flow rate of 20 μl/min using a running buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.005% surfactant P-20. All experiments were performed using a Photon Technology International Quanta Master I spectrofluorometer as described previously (8.Jault J.M. Fieulaine S. Nessler S. Gonzalo P. Di Pietro A.

The N-methylanthraniloyl (mant) derivatives of nucleotides were purchased from Molecular Probes. While searching for putative critical residues in HprK/P, we noticed that close to the Walker A motif (G X4GKS), two consecutive Asp residues were absolutely conserved in all HprK/P sequences known to date (see Fig. 1A for a few representative sequences). We then checked if a similar pattern could be present in other proteins and, therefore, used the tool PattInProt available on the Internet at npsa-pbil.ibcp.fr (15.Combet C. Blanchet C. Geourjon C. Deleage G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 147-150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1443) Google Scholar) to scan different data bases with the following signature, G-X (4.Galinier A.

Biol. 1996; 256: 126-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar)-D-D (using a Prosite syntax). Quite interestingly, this search picked up the well characterized PEPCK, which transforms the oxaloacetate into phosphoenolpyruvate by a process involving sequential decarboxylation and phosphorylation steps (13.Matte A. Tari L.W. Goldie H. Delbaere L.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8105-8108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Partial sequence alignment around the P-loop of both PEPCK and HprK/P revealed a local homology within a short stretch of residues close to the C-terminal part of both P-loops and notably including two consecutive Asp residues (Fig. 1A). Additionally, a His residue located a few residues before both P-loops could be aligned too, but whether this was fortuitous or not was unclear at that time. Biochemical experiments supported by the Escherichia coli enzyme three-dimensional structure show that these two Asp residues fulfil a crucial function in PEPCK as ligands of two different cations required for enzyme activity (13.Matte A. Tari L.W. Goldie H. Delbaere L.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8105-8108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 16.Hlavaty J.J. Nowak T.

Matte A. Goldie H. Delbaere L.T. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 990-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Hence, the first Asp residue (Asp-268) interacts indirectly through a water molecule with the so-called metal nucleotide (Mg2+ here) classically found in all nucleotide-binding proteins containing a P-loop (19.Smith C.A. Rayment I. Biophys. J. 1996; 70: 1590-1602Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). The second Asp residue (Asp-269) interacts both indirectly with the metal nucleotide through another water molecule and directly with a Mn2+ ion bound to the active site (Fig. 1B). A direct role in the phosphoryl transfer reaction has been proposed for this second cation (18.Tari L.W. Matte A. Goldie H. Delbaere L.T. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 990-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). To analyze the role of these two conserved Asp residues in HprK/P, each of them was replaced by an Ala residue in the B. subtilis enzyme. After overexpression and purification of the corresponding mutant proteins as for the wild-type enzyme, sensitivity to limited trypsin digestion was first assessed. Fig. 2A shows that a similar pattern of digestion was obtained for the two mutants as compared with that of the wild-type protein, although the D176A mutant appeared to be somewhat more resistant. Therefore, the overall structure of the protein is most likely not affected by the introduced mutations. The kinetic properties of each mutant were then compared with those of the wild-type enzyme. The phosphatase activity was totally abolished for both mutants since neither of them was capable of hydrolyzing the phospho-O-Crh (Fig. 2B). Also, no kinase activity could be detected under standard conditions (i.e. using limited amount of enzyme to maintain an initial rate of phosphorylation) whether or not the allosteric activator FBP was present (Fig. 2C). When an excess amount of enzyme was used, a slight phosphorylation was detected for the D176A mutant but only in the presence of FBP (Fig. 2D). By contrast, the D177A mutant remained unable to phosphorylate Crh, even under these conditions. Altogether, these results indicate that the Asp-176 and Asp-177 residues are involved both in the kinase and phosphatase activities of HprK/P, and each mutation, especially the D177A, drastically alter these two enzymatic activities. We then verified that the absence of activity for each mutant was due either to a lack of effector or substrate binding or to a lack of cooperativity between the monomers otherwise required for an efficient catalysis (8.Jault J.M. Fieulaine S. Nessler S. Gonzalo P. Di Pietro A. Deutscher J. Galinier A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1773-1780Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The fluorescence properties of the unique Trp residue in the B. subtilis HprK/P sequence (Trp-235), ideally located to sense the conformational modifications associated with the binding of either FBP or nucleotides, was used for this purpose. As previously shown (8.Jault J.M. Fieulaine S. Nessler S. Gonzalo P. Di Pietro A. Deutscher J. Galinier A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1773-1780Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), the binding of FBP to the wild-type HprK/P occurred with a positive cooperativity mechanism whose kinetic parameters are reported in Table I. They were essentially unaltered by each mutation, showing that the cooperativity between the enzyme monomers is conserved in the mutant proteins. Either ATP or GTP has been shown to be an efficient phosphate donor for the kinase activity catalyzed by HprK/P (6.Reizer J. Hoischen C. Titgemeyer F. Rivolta C. Rabus R. Stulke J. Karamata D. Saier M.H. Hillen W. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 27: 1157-1169Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar), and so the affinities for these nucleotides were measured for the two mutants. It was found that they were consistently higher for the D176A mutant as compared with those of the wild-type protein, especially that for the guanylic nucleotides (KD for GTP about 6-fold lower). By contrast, the D177A mutant exhibited roughly the same affinities for nucleotides as those found for the wild-type enzyme. Concerning the binding of the protein substrate Crh, the affinity for this substrate monitored by surface plasmon resonance was again slightly increased for the D176A mutant by about 3-fold, whereas it was unmodified in the D177A mutant as compared with the wild type (Table I). Overall, these results indicate that the lack of kinase activity in the two mutants is neither due to a strongly reduced affinity for one of the substrates, nucleotide or protein, nor to an altered cooperativity within homo-oligomers.Table IBinding of FBP, nucleotides, and Crh to HprK/P wild type or mutantsFBPATP KDGTP KDCrh KDnHKDappmmμmμmnmWild type1.9 ± 0.136.54298 ± 70121 ± 4445D176A2.27 ± 0.274.15150 ± 3018 ± 716D177A2.24 ± 0.155.64433 ± 6981 ± 2946The binding of FBP and nucleotides was monitored by the increased of fluorescence of the Trp residues, as described previously (8.Jault J.M.

The quality of fit was assessed by inspecting the χ2values (<2) and the random distribution of the residuals. The first three-dimensional structure was recently solved for the L. casei HprK/P, and the use of a global structural homology approach revealed only some similarity to cytidylate or adenylate kinase around the P-loop motif (12.Fieulaine S. Morera S. Poncet S. Monedero V. Gueguen-Chaignon V. Galinier A. Janin J. Deutscher J. Nessler S. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3917-3927Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Although PEPCK was not picked up by this search, Fig. 3A shows that there is a good superimposition of the two sequence stretches used in Fig. 1A. Hence, the structural organization of this part of each nucleotide-binding site folds in a similar way. The fold of the PEPCK nucleotide-binding site has been previously proposed to be unique (20.Matte A. Goldie H. Sweet R.M. Delbaere L.T. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 256: 126-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) among the P-loop-containing proteins, which are classified in the SCOP data base (21.Murzin A.G. Brenner S.E. Hubbard T. Chothia C. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 247: 536-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (5606) Google Scholar). In particular, this was the first structure containing a P-loop where the core of the β-sheet was formed with a mixed anti-parallel and parallel β-strands. This is exemplified here with the central β-strand following the His residue (in blue) anti-parallel to its two flanking β-strands, the one preceding the P-loop (in the back) and the one ended by the two consecutive Asp residues (in the front). The same topology and ordering are found for the three β-strands of HprK/P, whereas the major difference observed between PEPCK and HprK/P partial structures concerns the α-helix that follows the P-loop. It is shorter in PEPCK so as to accommodate the shorter sequence between the P-loop and the two Asp residues (see Fig. 1A). These conserved Asp residues occupy the same spatial position in the two structures relative to the Lys residues of both P-loops, although the relative orientations of their lateral chains are somewhat different (Fig. 3A). It should be noted, however, that the HprK/P structure was solved with no bound nucleotide (12.Fieulaine S. Morera S. Poncet S. Monedero V. Gueguen-Chaignon V. Galinier A. Janin J. Deutscher J. Nessler S. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3917-3927Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), and the nucleotide co-ordinates were added from the PEPCK structure. Quite interestingly, His residues preceding the P-loop and aligned in Fig. 1A are also superimposed in the two structures. In PEPCK, this residue interacts either with the γ-phosphate of ATP in the structure solved in the presence of ATP and a Mg2+ ion (22.Tari L.W. Matte A. Pugazhenthi U. Goldie H. Delbaere L.T. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 355-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) or with Mn2+ in the structure obtained in the presence of both ATP and Mg2+ and Mn2+ ions (18.Tari L.W. Matte A. Goldie H. Delbaere L.T. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 990-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Although binding of two cations as a requirement for kinase activity of HprK/P is not yet determined, the difference in the cation requirement for the binding of either nucleotide or the HPr substrate, the latter occurring in the absence of nucleotide, definitely points to this possibility. 2J.-P. Lavergne, J.-M. Jault, and A. Galinier, submitted for publication. Assuming that the ATP structure found in PEPCK is essentially the same in HprK/P, which seems reasonable at least for the triphosphate moiety for most P-loop containing proteins (19.Smith C.A. Rayment I. Biophys. J. 1996; 70: 1590-1602Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar), the location of each HprK/P Trp residues might be inferred relative to the bound nucleotide. Within a monomer of L. casei, the unique Trp is located about 15 Å away from the base moiety of the nucleotide bound to this subunit (not shown). However, the structure of the L. casei enzyme revealed a hexameric association with three subunits on top of three others (12.Fieulaine S. Morera S. Poncet S. Monedero V. Gueguen-Chaignon V. Galinier A. Janin J. Deutscher J. Nessler S. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3917-3927Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Hence, the Trp residue of one of the neighboring subunits is possibly located at about 6.5 Å of the ribose of the nucleotide bound to the vicinal subunit (Fig. 3B). B. subtilis HprK/P also functions as a homo-oligomer (8.Jault J.M. Fieulaine S. Nessler S. Gonzalo P. Di Pietro A. Deutscher J. Galinier A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1773-1780Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), and each subunit contains a unique Trp residue (Trp-235) equivalent to the Trp residue of L. casei. Considering a single subunit, the Trp residue would be located about 15 Å away from the base of the nucleotide bound to the same subunit. However, considering the hexameric nature of the enzyme, a Trp residue from one subunit would be located at about 6.5 Å of the nucleotide bound to the vicinal subunit. Therefore, the modification of fluorescence of the Trp residue from one monomer is most likely affected by the binding of nucleotide to the neighboring monomer (distance of 6.5 Å) rather than the binding to the same monomer (distance of 15 Å) (Table I). In addition, we showed that binding of the mant-ADP or -GDP provoked a very high energy transfer between the mant moiety and the Trp residues (8.Jault J.M. Fieulaine S. Nessler S. Gonzalo P. Di Pietro A. Deutscher J. Galinier A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1773-1780Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Substituting a mant moiety to the 2′ (or 3′) of the ribose in Fig. 3B would bring the latter even closer to the Trp residue than 6.5 Å (not shown), which would explain the high energy transfer observed previously. Binding of fluorescent nucleotide analogues, mant-ATP or -GTP, were also measured with the two mutants, especially since these analogues were both shown previously to efficiently replace their respective unmodified nucleotides in phosphorylation experiments (8.Jault J.M. Fieulaine S. Nessler S. Gonzalo P. Di Pietro A. Deutscher J. Galinier A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1773-1780Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The additions of increasing concentrations of mant-GTP to the wild-type enzyme progressively quenched the Trp fluorescence emission peak (centered around 340 nm). It gave rise concomitantly to a new peak of fluorescence (centered around 430 nm), revealing a fluorescence resonance energy transfer between Trp residues and the mant moiety (Fig. 4, panel A). In this case too, the height of this new peak shows that there is a very high efficiency of energy transfer, similar to that observed previously with mant-ADP. When the same experiment was performed in the presence of equimolar amounts of Mg2+, a similar efficiency of energy transfer was reached with the wild-type enzyme (Fig. 4, panel D). However, much lower concentrations of mant-GTP were required in this case to saturate the nucleotide-binding site, as indicated by the fitted KD values obtained from the plot of the fluorescence resonance energy transfer intensity in the function of the mant-GTP concentrations (8.Jault J.M. Fieulaine S. Nessler S. Gonzalo P. Di Pietro A. Deutscher J. Galinier A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1773-1780Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) (KD = 12.28 ± 0.79 μm and 1.54 ± 0.1 μm in the absence and in the presence of Mg2+, respectively). The D177A mutant behaved likewise, with an affinity for mant-GTP much higher in the presence as compared with in the absence of Mg2+(KD = 8.53 ± 1.28 μm and 0.68 ± 0.07 μm, respectively) and with efficiencies of energy transfers similar to those observed for the wild-type enzyme (panels C and F). At the opposite, a quite spectacular effect was seen on the efficiencies of energy transfer with the D176A mutant. In the absence of Mg2+ (panel B), a much higher energy transfer was seen with this mutant as compared with the wild type, whereas a reversed effect was obtained in the presence of Mg2+, as the energy transfer with the mutant became considerably attenuated (panel E). Accordingly and in comparison to the wild-type enzyme, the maximal quenching of the Trp fluorescence for the D176A mutant was higher in the absence of Mg2+ and lower in its presence. However, the affinities for mant-GTP were not markedly altered in this mutant, since its fitted KD values were 4.9 ± 0.47 μm and 0.85 ± 0.22 μm in the absence or in the presence of Mg2+, respectively. Besides, similar effects were observed using the mant-ATP analogue instead, although the level of transfer was lower for each enzyme in the absence of Mg2+, especially for the D176A mutant (not shown). Only equimolar concentrations of Mg2+ could be used here since it was shown previously that using an excess of Mg2+ over the nucleotide concentration provoked a progressive precipitation of the enzyme, which precluded fluorescence titrations on the long run (8.Jault J.M. Fieulaine S. Nessler S. Gonzalo P. Di Pietro A. Deutscher J. Galinier A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1773-1780Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, adding 1 mm Mg2+ in excess of the highest concentration of mant-GTP used in Fig. 4 (panels D–F) did not change significantly the efficiency of energy transfer for the three enzymes. This suggests that the effect observed with the D176A mutant in the presence of Mg2+ is not due to a reduced affinity for this cation. Rather, the binding of nucleotides or analogues might be slightly modified consequent to the mutation. It is noteworthy that a point mutation of the equivalent Asp residue into an Asn residue in E. coli PEPCK somehow uncoupled the two enzyme activities; it eliminated virtually all the phosphorylation of the intermediate, enolate of pyruvate, thereby unveiling an oxaloacetate decarboxylase activity. The latter activity was nevertheless stimulated by the addition of ATP, showing that this mutant still bound this nucleotide but in a distorted conformation unable to promote the phosphorylating activity (23.Hou S.Y. Chao Y.P. Liao J.C. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 1620-1623Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the D176A HprK/P mutant, the altered conformation of the bound nucleotide might also explain the dramatic effect seen on the energy transfer efficiencies given the spatial proximity of the Trp residue and the mant moiety. For distances between two chromophores shorter than 10 Å, the Förster theory (dipole-dipole interaction) is no longer valid to explain the mechanism of energy transfer (24.Stryer L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1978; 47: 819-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (1976) Google Scholar, 25.Selvin P.R. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 246: 300-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar), and instead a Dexter mechanism is involved (electron-exchange interaction) (26.Lamola, A. A. (Leermakers, P. A., and Weissberger, A., eds) (1969) @@[email protected]@Energy Transfer and Organic [email protected]@/[email protected]@, pp. 18–132, Interscience Publishers, New YorkGoogle Scholar). In this latter case, although no useful relationship is known to correlate the transfer efficiency to the distance separating two chromophores (27.Galley W.C. Strambini G.B. Nature. 1976; 261: 521-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), the rate of transfer is strongly influenced by this distance, since it decreases by approximately 1 order of magnitude for a 1.3-Å increment in separation (26.Lamola, A. A. (Leermakers, P. A., and Weissberger, A., eds) (1969) @@[email protected]@Energy Transfer and Organic [email protected]@/[email protected]@, pp. 18–132, Interscience Publishers, New YorkGoogle Scholar). Additionally, the transfer efficiencies might also be affected by the relative orientation of the two chromophores (27.Galley W.C. Strambini G.B. Nature. 1976; 261: 521-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Therefore, a subtle modification in distance and/or orientation between the Trp residue and the mant moiety caused by the D176A mutation are sufficient to account for the perturbations observed in the energy transfer efficiencies. The equivalent Asp residue (Asp-178) in L. casei interacts with the Ser-162 residue of the P-loop through an H-bond (Fig. 3B). Such an interaction is observed in all nucleotide-binding proteins bearing a P-loop except adenylate kinase; this interaction occurs between the equivalent P-loop residue (always a Ser or a Thr) and an Asp residue that interacts with the metal nucleotide and is, therefore, functionally equivalent to the Asp-178 residue (19.Smith C.A. Rayment I. Biophys. J. 1996; 70: 1590-1602Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). In B. subtilis, the D176A mutation will prevent the formation of this H-bond, and one might tentatively propose that this would slightly distort the nucleotide-binding site. This would thus lead to an altered conformation of the bound nucleotide precluding the phosphorylation of the protein substrate. Regarding the Asp-177 residue and given that its substitution by an Ala residue totally abolishes the substrate phosphorylation, it might participate directly as a catalytic base to abstract a proton from the attacking hydroxyl group of the Ser-46 residue of HPr (or Crh). A similar catalytic role has been proposed for the Asp-37 residue of the chloramphenicol phosphotransferase, another P-loop-containing phosphotransferase (28.Izard T. Ellis J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2690-7000Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), and it is noteworthy that in both enzyme structures these Asp residues occupy a similar spatial position (not shown). The postulated role for these two Asp residues agrees well with the very recently solved three-dimensional structure of a complex between L. casei HprK/P and the protein substrate HPr, obtained in the presence of Ca2+ions. 3S. Fieulaine, S. Morera, S. Poncet, A. Galinier, J. Janin, J. Deutscher, and S. Nessler, submitted for publication. First, this structure reveals that the Asp-178 residue (i.e. Asp-176 in B. subtilis) interacts with two residues directly liganded to the Ca2+ ion, the Ser-162 residue of the P-loop and the Glu-204 residue. This Ca2+ ion occupies the same position as the Mg2+ ion in other P-loop-containing proteins, for instance in the PEPCK, both cations usually behaving as similar co-factors for most of these proteins (29.Dorgan L.J. Urbauer J.L. Schuster S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 2816-2821Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30.Urbatsch I.L. Gimi K. Wilke-Mounts S. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25031-25038Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Thus, mutation of this Asp residue would destabilize the correct network of interactions with the bound cation. Second, the Asp-179 residue (i.e. Asp-177 in B. subtilis) is hydrogen-bound to the hydroxyl hydrogen of the Ser-46 residue of HPr, which makes this Asp residue the ideal candidate to deprotonate this Ser residue before phosphorylation proceeds. The two Asp residues highlighted in this study also play a critical role in the dephosphorylation process, suggesting that both the kinase and phosphatase activities occur at the same catalytic site and that the phosphatase activity would probably function as a reversal mechanism of the phosphorylation pathway. In conclusion, although HprK/P and PEPCK catalyze different overall reactions, their nucleotide-binding sites share a similar topology. This allows a conservation of some crucial active site residues that are likely to play a similar role in the catalytic pathway of each enzyme. Altogether, this suggests that these two enzymes have evolved from a common ancestor. Interestingly, both enzymes also appear to be able to dephosphorylate their respective substrates, since in the conditions used for the crystallization, the PEPCK enzyme has been reported to form ATP and pyruvate from ADP and phosphoenolpyruvate (18.Tari L.W. Matte A. Goldie H. Delbaere L.T. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 990-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). We are grateful to J. Janin for critical reading of the manuscript."
https://openalex.org/W1969603176,"The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae MID1 gene encodes a stretch-activated Ca2+-permeable nonselective cation channel composed of 548 amino acid residues. A physiological role of the Mid1 channel is known to maintain the viability of yeast cells exposed to mating pheromone, but its structural basis remains to be clarified. To solve this problem, we identified the mutation sites of mid1 mutant alleles generated by in vivo ethyl methanesulfonate mutagenesis and found that two mid1 alleles have nonsense mutations at the codon for Trp441, generating a truncated Mid1 protein lacking two-thirds of the intracellular carboxyl-terminal region from Asn389 to Thr548. In vitro random mutagenesis with hydroxylamine also showed that the carboxyl-terminal region is essential. To identify the functional portion of the carboxyl-terminal region in detail, we performed a progressive carboxyl-terminal truncation followed by functional analyses and found that the truncated protein produced from the mid1 allele bearing the amber mutation at the codon for Phe522 (F522Am) complemented the mating pheromone-induced death phenotype of the mid1 mutant and increased its Ca2+ uptake activity to a wild-type level, whereas N521Am did not. This result indicates that the carboxyl-terminal domain spanning from Asn389 to Asn521 is required for Mid1 function. Interestingly, this domain is cysteine-rich, and alanine-scanning mutagenesis revealed that seven out of 10 cysteine residues are unexchangeable. These results clearly indicate that the carboxyl-terminal domain including the cysteine residues is important for Mid1 function."
