https://openalex.org/W2065026248,"Of 20 amino acids measured, alanine is the principal amino acid released by forearm muscle of man, in accord with its being the principal amino acid extracted by liver for gluconeogenesis. This occurs in both the postabsorptive state and after 4 to 6 weeks of starvation, when total amino acid release is markedly diminished."

https://openalex.org/W2018272533,"Papillary transitional cell tumors were found in the urinary bladders in 8 rats out of 80 that received 2600 milligrams per kilogram of body weight per day of a mixture of sodium cyclamate and sodium saccharin (10:1) for up to 105 weeks. From week 79 on, several of these rats received cyclohexylamine hydrochloride (125 milligrams per kilogram per day, the molecular equivalent of the conversion of about 10 percent of the cyclamate dosage to cyclohexylamine) in addition to the sodium cyclamate and sodium saccharin. In another study in which 50 rats were fed daily 15 milligrams of cyclohexylamine sulfate per kilogram of body weight for 2 years, eight males and nine females survived. One of the eight males had a tumor of the urinary bladder. In neither study were bladder tumors found in the control rats or in rats treated with lower doses of the compounds."
https://openalex.org/W2062414155,"The surface waters of the western Atlantic are supersaturated with respect to the partial pressure of carbon monoxide in the atmosphere. Under these conditions, the net transport of carbon monoxide across the air-sea interface must be from the sea into the atmosphere. Thus, the ocean appears to act as a source of carbon monoxide. The ocean may be the largest known natural source of this gas, contributing possibly as much as 5 percent of the amount generated by burning of fuels by man."

https://openalex.org/W1567874431,"Abstract Subchloroplast particles were prepared by incubation with digitonin and differential centrifugation. Such particles show a high rate of cyclic photophosphorylation but have little or no capacity to form the reversible, light-dependent pH gradient. They also have no activity in the formation of the nonphosphorylated high energy intermediate, in acid-base phosphorylation, and in light-induced absorbance change. ATP formation in these particles is insensitive to amines, nigericin plus KCl, and low concentrations of Triton X-100. It is inhibited by atebrin, carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone, and citrate. It is concluded from the above and from other experimental results that the light-induced formation of a pH differential in chloroplasts is secondary to and in equilibrium with a postulated high energy intermediate. A mode of action for various uncouplers in photophosphorylation in chloroplasts is suggested."
https://openalex.org/W1567497102,"Abstract Cytidine triphosphate synthetase, when purified, has been shown to be a dimer of 105,000 molecular weight, composed of two seemingly identical 50,000 subunits. In the presence of the substrates ATP, UTP, and Mg2+, under assay conditions, the dimer aggregates to the enzymatically active tetramer of 210,000 molecular weight. Two of the four glutamine-binding sites have been covalently labeled using the affinity label, 6-diazo-5-oxo-l-norleucine, which attaches to a cysteine residue. The unavailability of all glutamine sites to the affinity label is discussed in terms of the negative cooperativity with respect to glutamine and 6-diazo-5-oxo-l-norleucine. The finding of four identical subunits in the aggregated tetramer explains the high Hill coefficients and the kinetic requirement for four interacting sites for each substrate. It thus appears that the conformational changes depend on the ligand inducing the changes and hence that different subunit interaction patterns are induced by the different ligands."

It is highly selective for potassium ion over sodium ion and divalent ions and can be used for the direct determination of potassium ion in human serumn. No significant complexing of potassiium appears to occur in normal seruin."

https://openalex.org/W2075610658,"Repeated installation of N-hydroxy-2 naphthylamine into dog bladders produced tumors of this organ. There is a correlation of degree of carcinogenicity of 1-naphthylamine, 2-naphthylamine, and 4-aminobiphenyl with both methemoglobin production in the blood and concentration of N-oxidation products in the urine. Thus, N-hydroxylation appears to be the key to bladder cancer production by aromatic amines."
https://openalex.org/W2043262229,The pseudohermaphrodite rat is characterized by lack of androgen-dependent differentiation. Treatment of these rats with testosterone failed to produce the expected changes in preputial and adrenal gland weights and hexobarbital metabolism. This insitivity of the end organ to testosterone could not be explained by defective formation of dihydrotestosterone.
https://openalex.org/W2065739073,"Candida lipolytica is a rather common yeast isolated more frequently from substrates containing lipids or proteins, such as dairy products, than from substrates rich in sugars. This species assimilates hydrocarbons and is currently being studied for its potential to convert petroleum into yeast cells for use in feeds and foods. We have found C. lipolytica to exist in nature primarily in the heterothallic haploid state. When appropriate strains of opposite sex are mixed on a suitable sporulation medium, conjugation occurs followed by the production of ascospores. Since heterothallism permits laboratory control of hybridization, this characteristic of C. lipolytica enhances the possibility of im proving its strains for technological uses."
https://openalex.org/W2025712429,"The concentration of radon-222 in air was measured during a flight from Miami to Barbados to Dakar and return; concentrations ranged from 1 to 55 picocuries per standard cubic meter of air and were highest in areas of dense haze, which were present along most of the flight path across the Atlantic Ocean. The haze is attributed to dust originating from the arid regions of western Africa. Radon-222 may be useful as a tracer for African air parcels over the equatorial Atlantic."
https://openalex.org/W1551053040,"Abstract Polyarginine was chemically methylated with methyl iodide, and its acid hydrolysate gave rise to a compound which cochromatographed with an enzymatically synthesized guanidino-methylarginine-(methyl-14C) on the automatic amino acid analyzer column. The guanidino-methylarginine-(methyl-14C) on alkaline hydrolysis decomposed into monomethylurea-(methyl-14C) and methylamine-(methyl-14C). However, no evidence of production of either δ-N-methylornithine-(methyl-14C) or dimethylurea-(methyl-14C) was obtained by the alkaline hydrolysis. The formation of methylamine-(methyl-14C) was further confirmed by preparing the picrate of the formed methylamine. These results strongly suggest that the structure of the previously postulated guanidino-methylarginine is ω-N-methylarginine. ω-N-Methylarginine occurs in rat liver nuclear protein in the amount of 1 mole of ω-N-methylarginine to approximately 70 moles of arginine."
https://openalex.org/W1583939579,"Abstract Insulin or one of the following compounds—l-cysteine, reduced glutathione, 2-mercaptoethanol, or dithiothreitol—was incubated with isolated fat cells or broken fat cells from rats. In a concentration range of 0.01 to 1 mm, these effects of thiols resembled those of insulin: (a) partial suppression of lipolysis induced by epinephrine, the degree of inhibition being inversely related to the concentration of epinephrine, (b) increase of glucose utilization, with preferential utilization of glucose carbon for fatty acid synthesis and the pentose cycle, and (c) stimulation of glucose metabolism in intact, but not broken, cells. The insulin-like effects of thiols were related to their content of sulfhydryl residues. The dose-response relationships for the effects of thiols on glucose oxidation and lipolysis were parallel to those for insulin action. The effects of submaximal concentrations of insulin and cysteine together, on glucose metabolism and lipolysis, were additive. Stimulation of glucose metabolism by a supramaximal concentration of insulin (1000 µunits per ml) was not further augmented by the presence of cysteine (0.5 mm) together with the insulin. However, in the presence of 0.56 µm epinephrine, lipolysis was more strongly inhibited by insulin alone (1000 µunits per ml) than by 0.5 mm cysteine together with the insulin. In concentrations greater than 10 mm, thiols suppressed lipolysis to a greater degree than did insulin, in the presence of high concentrations of epinephrine together with caffeine. These concentrations of thiols also profoundly decreased utilization of glucose by both intact and broken cells. The thiols, in the lower concentration range, may share with insulin a common pathway of action. In higher concentrations, the thiols apparently acted at some other site (or sites)."

https://openalex.org/W1517418132,"Rat liver threonyl-transfer RNA synthetase forms an ATP-enzyme complex when incubated with ATP and magnesium ions. The formation, stability, and reactivity of the complex have been studied. Enzyme-bound ATP serves as substrate in the over-all reaction of threonyl-tRNA formation at concentration levels at which free ATP and enzyme do not give rise to product. Threonine-specific tRNA has a labilizing effect on the complex. The initial velocity of the over-all reaction has been studied. The nature of the kinetic patterns obtained shows that the reaction is bi uni uni bi ping pong. The kinetic evidence also indicates that ATP interacts with the threonyl-tRNA synthetase as the first substrate in the reaction sequence shown: [see PDF for equation]"
https://openalex.org/W1520947127,"The kinetics of inactivation of β-amylase with iodoacetamide, N-ethylmaleimide, and 5,5'-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) is investigated. Corroborating earlier work, N-ethylmaleimide and iodoacetamide alkylate 3 exposed sulfhydryl residues per 47,500 g atoms of protein, the monomer weight. To account for the depressing effects of iodoacetamide and N-ethylmaleimide on catalytic activity and the changes in the physical properties of the enzyme, it is proposed that modification of the protein results in a conformation change. Realignment of the active site is thought to be proportional to substituent size. Although the Michaelis constant and the inhibition constant are only slightly affected, the depression of the maximum velocity is very profound. It is speculated that the thiol sites are regulatory entities in vivo. This proposal is supported by a demonstration that β-amylase can be reversibly inactivated via disulfide interchanges."
https://openalex.org/W1997770198,"CHLOROTIC dwarf disease of eastern white pine (Pinus strobus L.) is a physiogenic condition characterized by stunted roots and tops, mottled needles and premature foliar abscission. Recent work has indicated that the disease is caused by gaseous pollutants that injure the needles of genetically susceptible white pines1. We have now shown that the action and interaction of ozone and sulphur dioxide cause characteristic symptoms on the foliage of white pine ramets that are susceptible to chlorotic dwarf."
https://openalex.org/W2078920423,"Sodium cyclamate was suspended in cholesterol pellets that were surgically implanted in the urinary bladders of mice. In duplicate experiments, incidences of mouse bladder carcinomas observed in animals exposed to these pellets were 78 and 61 percent compared with incidences of 13 and 12 percent in control mice exposed to pellets of pure cholesterol. The exposure of the mouse bladder to sodium cyclamate was very brief, as the time required for 50 percent of the compound to disappear from the pellets was about 1 hour. This experimental technique was found to be highly sensitive, reproducible, and predictive of the bladder carcinogenicity of orally administered cyclamate."
https://openalex.org/W1559229643,"Abstract Two 24-carbon polyenes previously reported in rat testes have been isolated and characterized to be Δ9,12,15,18-tetracosatetraenoic and Δ6,9,12,15,18-tetracosapentaenoic acids. The compounds were separated and purified by gas-liquid chromatography, and their structures were established by use of gas-liquid chromatography before and after hydrogenation, by ultraviolet spectroscopy of the alkaline isomerized derivatives, and by identification of fragments resulting from cleavage at double bonds by oxidative and reductive ozonolyses. The biosynthesis of the 24-carbon polyenes was studied after intratesticular injections of either 1-14C-linoleate or 1-14C-arachidonate. The two metabolic products, individually, were cleaved by oxidative ozonolysis, and the location of the 14C in the molecule was determined by gas-liquid radiochromatography of the fragments. The distribution of the 14C was consistent with the hypothesis that the 24-carbon polyenoic acids were biosynthesized by elongation and further desaturation of linoleic acid. Final proof was obtained by chemical carbon by carbon degradation and measurement of the specific activity of individual carbon atoms. After 1-14C-linoleate injection, Δ6,9,12,15,18-tetracosapentaenoic acid from testicular tissue was labeled primarily in the 7th carbon. After 1-14C-arachidonate injection, testicular Δ9,12,15,18-tetracosatetraenoate was labeled primarily in the 5th carbon. The suggested pathway of biosynthesis of the 24-carbon tetraenoic and pentaenoic acids is by a 2-carbon elongation of docosatetraenoic and of docosapentaenoic acids, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W1544132533,"Abstract The ability of rat liver lysosomes and Ehrlich ascites tumor lysosomes to degrade nucleic acids has been studied. Extracts of rat liver tritosomes and of tumor cell mitochondrial plus lysosomal fractions were incubated with various types of DNA and RNA from sources ranging from bacteria to mammals. The extracts were able to hydrolyze all the nucleic acids completely to free nucleosides and inorganic phosphate. The influence of the nature and concentration of substrate, of pH, and of temperature are reported for calf thymus DNA and yeast-soluble RNA. In comparison with the lysosomal enzyme systems responsible for the hydrolysis of other cellular constituents, it appears that the nuclease systems have similar stability and may be even more active."
https://openalex.org/W1515769639,"Abstract Sucrose synthetase from mung bean (Phaseolus aureus) has been purified by a combination of ammonium sulfate precipitation, gel filtration, and sucrose density gradient centrifugation. The molecular weight of sucrose synthetase was determined to be about 106 by gel filtration chromatography and sucrose density gradient centrifugation. The density of the sucrose synthetase particle was determined by equilibrium sedimentation to be 1.20 g per cc. The ability to catalyze the synthesis of sucrose from each of the nucleoside diphosphate glucoses containing uridine, adenosine, thymidine, cytidine, and guanosine remains associated with the purified particle. Attempts to subdivide the particle into catalytically active units have been unsuccessful. The Michaelis constants of the substrates for the sucrose synthetase particles and the maximum velocities of sucrose synthesis in the presence of each of the nucleoside diphosphate glucoses have been determined. In competition experiments between pairs of nucleoside diphosphate glucoses, uridine diphosphate glucose inhibits the synthesis of sucrose from the other nucleoside diphosphate glucoses far more effectively than would be expected on the basis of competition between the substrates for the same catalytic sites. On the other hand, the adenosine-, thymidine-, cytidine-, and guanosine-containing nucleoside diphosphate glucoses do not inhibit sucrose synthesis from uridine diphosphate glucose as effectively as would be anticipated on the basis of a simple competition mechanism. It is concluded that uridine diphosphate glucose is able to control the synthesis of the other nucleoside diphosphate glucoses from sucrose by causing a modification of sucrose synthetase."
https://openalex.org/W2109483673,"Abstract Glutamate dehydrogenase (EC 1.4.1.3) (GDH) was studied with a system in vitro of tadpole and frog liver cube suspensions. A rise in GDH activity was observed in liver from tadpoles immersed in thyroxine (2.6 x 10-8 m) for 8 days. A small rise in enzyme activity was observed in vitro in liver cubes from premetamorphic tadpoles. In the presence of thyroxine (2.6 x 10-8 m to 2.6 x 10-10 m) or triiodothyropropionate (2.6 x 10-9 m or 2.6 x 10-11 m), the mean increase in the specific activity in vitro was twice that of the control over a 48-hour incubation period. Thyroxine stimulated synthesis de novo of immunoprecipitable glutamate dehydrogenase as well as soluble mitochondrial proteins. A specific stimulation of GDH synthesis relative to soluble mitochondrial protein synthesis in vitro was observed at a thyroxine concentration of 2.6 x 10-8 m. Higher concentrations of thyroxine resulted in a specific effect only in liver cubes prepared from tadpoles previously treated with thiourea. Synthesis de novo of GDH was inhibited by puromycin and actinomycin but the total enzyme activity in vitro was increased in the presence of these antibiotics. A continuous conversion of labeled nonimmunoprecipitable precursors into immunoprecipitable GDH was observed in vitro in the absence of any additives to the incubation system. In a single experiment, thyroxine itself appeared to stimulate precursor conversion. The half-disappearance time of labeled immunoprecipitable GDH was 21.2 ± 1.7 hours in vitro and 22.8 hours in vivo. Actinomycin and puromycin inhibited breakdown of immunoprecipitable GDH. Synthesis de novo, precursor conversion, and a rapid turnover of GDH were observed in vitro in liver cubes from premetamorphic and metamorphosing tadpoles as well as in the adult frog. The implications of these basic mechanisms of enzyme regulation are discussed."

https://openalex.org/W2026091825,"Newly formed small lymphocytes with a short life-span in the blood are the only cells from thoracic duct lymph which accumulate in acutely inflamed tissue. This conclusion is drawn from studies in which rats with induced peritonieal exudates were injected intravenously with radioactively labeled thoracic duct cells. Radioactivity, originally vested in newly formed donor small lymphocytes, was found later in a small number of similar exudate cells. Small lymphocytes generated 10 days or more before the thoracic ducts were cannulated failed to localize in peritoneal exudates, although the cells moved in large numbers from the blood in to lymph nodes."
https://openalex.org/W1558865314,"Abstract Carnitine acetyltransferase was examined in developing sperm of different regions of the testis in wild type Drosophila melanogaster. The activity of this enzyme was low in spermatogonia, spermatocytes, and spermatids but extremely high in mature sperm. The level of testicular carnitine acetyltransferase is low in genetically sterile males as well as in males sterile as a result of dietary conditions. Electron microscope observations of spermiogenesis in males raised on a diet in which choline is replaced by carnitine indicate that the appearance of high carnitine acetyltransferase activity during sperm development is dependent upon the development of the mitochondrion and association of the mitochondrion with the axial filament complex. A factor located on the short arm of the Y chromosome is postulated to influence the testicular level of carnitine acetyltransferase, possibly by regulating the number of developing gametes to undergo spermiogenesis. The factor is not identical with either the ks-1 or ks-2 male fertility factors."
