https://openalex.org/W2078378773,"Background & Aims While it is widely accepted that obesity is associated with low-grade systemic inflammation, the molecular origin of the inflammation remains unknown. Here, we investigated the effect of endotoxin-induced inflammation via TLR4 signaling pathway at both systemic and intestinal levels in response to a high-fat diet. Methods C57BL/6J and TLR4-deficient C57BL/10ScNJ mice were maintained on a low-fat (10 kcal % fat) diet (LFD) or a high–fat (60 kcal % fat) diet (HFD) for 8 weeks. Results HFD induced macrophage infiltration and inflammation in the adipose tissue, as well as an increase in the circulating proinflammatory cytokines. HFD increased both plasma and fecal endotoxin levels and resulted in dysregulation of the gut microbiota by increasing the Firmicutes to Bacteriodetes ratio. HFD induced the growth of Enterobecteriaceae and the production of endotoxin in vitro. Furthermore, HFD induced colonic inflammation, including the increased expression of proinflammatory cytokines, the induction of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), iNOS, COX-2, and the activation of NF-κB in the colon. HFD reduced the expression of tight junction-associated proteins claudin-1 and occludin in the colon. HFD mice demonstrated higher levels of Akt and FOXO3 phosphorylation in the colon compared to the LFD mice. While the body weight of HFD-fed mice was significantly increased in both TLR4-deficient and wild type mice, the epididymal fat weight and plasma endotoxin level of HFD-fed TLR4-deficient mice were 69% and 18% of HFD-fed wild type mice, respectively. Furthermore, HFD did not increase the proinflammatory cytokine levels in TLR4-deficient mice. Conclusions HFD induces inflammation by increasing endotoxin levels in the intestinal lumen as well as in the plasma by altering the gut microbiota composition and increasing its intestinal permeability through the induction of TLR4, thereby accelerating obesity."

Dental caries results from a shift within the biofilm community specific to the tooth surface, and acidogenic species are responsible for caries. Streptococcus mutans, the most common acid producer in caries, is not always present and occurs as part of a complex microbial community. Understanding the degree to which multiple acidogenic species provide functional redundancy and resilience to caries-associated communities will be important for developing biologic interventions. In addition, microbial community interactions in health and caries pathogenesis are not well understood. The purpose of this study was to investigate bacterial community profiles associated with the onset of caries in the primary dentition. In a combination cross-sectional and longitudinal design, bacterial community profiles at progressive stages of caries and over time were examined and compared to those of health. 16S rRNA gene sequencing was used for bacterial community analysis. Streptococcus mutans was the dominant species in many, but not all, subjects with caries. Elevated levels of S. salivarius, S. sobrinus, and S. parasanguinis were also associated with caries, especially in subjects with no or low levels of S. mutans, suggesting these species are alternative pathogens, and that multiple species may need to be targeted for interventions. Veillonella, which metabolizes lactate, was associated with caries and was highly correlated with total acid producing species. Among children without previous history of caries, Veillonella, but not S. mutans or other acid-producing species, predicted future caries. Bacterial community diversity was reduced in caries as compared to health, as many species appeared to occur at lower levels or be lost as caries advanced, including the Streptococcus mitis group, Neisseria, and Streptococcus sanguinis. This may have implications for bacterial community resilience and the restoration of oral health."

On anterior-posterior histological sections, we measured the distance Bruch's membrane end (BME)-optic nerve margin (""Gamma zone""), BME-retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) (""Beta zone""), BME-beginning of non-occluded choriocapillaris, and BME-beginning of photoreceptor layer. ""Delta zone"" was defined as part of gamma zone in which blood vessels of at least 50 µm diameter were not present over a length of >300 µm. Beta zone (mean length:0.35±0.52 mm) was significantly (P = 0.01) larger in the glaucoma group than in the non-glaucomatous group. It was not significantly (P = 0.28) associated with axial length. Beta zone was significantly (P = 0.004) larger than the region with occluded choriocapillaris. Gamma zone (mean length:0.63±1.25 mm) was associated with axial length (P<0.001;r(2) = 0.73) with an increase starting at an axial length of 26.5 mm. It was not significantly (P = 0.24) associated with glaucomatous optic neuropathy. Delta zone (present only in eyes with axial length of ≥27 mm) was associated with axial length (P = 0.001) and scleral flange length (P<0.001) but not with glaucoma (P = 0.73).Parapapillary gamma zone (peripapillary sclera without overlying choroid, Bruch's membrane and deep retinal layers) was related with axial globe elongation and was independent of glaucoma. Delta zone (no blood vessels >50 µm diameter within gamma zone) was present only in highly axially elongated globes and was not related with glaucoma. Beta zone (Bruch's membrane without RPE) was correlated with glaucoma but not with globe elongation. Since the region with occluded choriocapillaris was smaller than beta zone, complete loss of RPE may have occurred before complete choriocapillaris closure."
https://openalex.org/W1983626034,"The male bias in autism spectrum conditions (ASC) has led to females with ASC being under-researched. This lack of attention to females could hide variability due to sex that may explain some of the heterogeneity within ASC. In this study we investigate four key cognitive domains (mentalizing and emotion perception, executive function, perceptual attention to detail, and motor function) in ASC, to test for similarities and differences between males and females with and without ASC (n = 128 adults; n = 32 per group). In the mentalizing and facial emotion perception domain, males and females with ASC showed similar deficits compared to neurotypical controls. However, in attention to detail and dexterity involving executive function, although males with ASC showed poorer performance relative to neurotypical males, females with ASC performed comparably to neurotypical females. We conclude that performance in the social-cognitive domain is equally impaired in male and female adults with ASC. However, in specific non-social cognitive domains, performance within ASC depends on sex. This suggests that in specific domains, cognitive profiles in ASC are modulated by sex."

We define the country-country and product-product projected networks and introduce a novel method of filtering information based on elements' similarity. As a result we find that country clustering reveals unexpected socio-geographic links among the most competing countries. On the same footings the products clustering can be efficiently used for a bottom-up classification of produced goods. Furthermore we mathematically reformulate the ""reflections method"" introduced by Hidalgo and Hausmann as a fixpoint problem; such formulation highlights some conceptual weaknesses of the approach. To overcome such an issue, we introduce an alternative methodology (based on biased Markov chains) that allows to rank countries in a conceptually consistent way. Our analysis uncovers a strong non-linear interaction between the diversification of a country and the ubiquity of its products, thus suggesting the possible need of moving towards more efficient and direct non-linear fixpoint algorithms to rank countries and products in the global market."

Conventional transmission electron microscopic examination of murine embryonic fibroblasts treated with carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP), a mitochondrial uncoupler, found that more than half of the mitochondria presented a ring-shaped or C-shaped morphology. Many of these mitochondria seemed to have engulfed various cytosolic components. Serial sections through individual mitochondria indicated that they formed a ball-like structure with an internal lumen surrounded by the membranes and containing cytosolic materials. Notably, the lumen was connected to the external cytoplasm through a small opening. Electron tomographic reconstruction of the mitochondrial spheroids demonstrated the membrane topology and confirmed the vesicular configuration of this mitochondrial structure. The outside periphery and the lumen were defined by the outer membranes, which were lined with the inner membranes. Matrix and cristae were retained but distributed unevenly with less being kept near the luminal opening. Mitochondrial spheroids seem to form in response to oxidative mitochondrial damage independently of mitophagy.

The structural features of the mitochondrial spheroids thus represent a novel mitochondrial dynamics. Mitochondria are dynamic organelles, exhibiting changes in size, morphology, mobility, localization, and turnover, which are intimately associated with adaptive and functional alterations, quality control, and homeostasis (1.Scheffler I.E.

These conditions can also cause mitochondria damage, which in turn further exacerbates disease progression via the increased production of reactive oxygen species. Mitochondria are delimited by double membranes, enclosing the matrix compartment that contains the mitochondrial DNA. The topology of the inner membrane is dynamically controlled, hence the greater variation in the morphology of the cristae. The outer membrane does not present such variations but set the boundary for the organelle. Another morphological aspect of the mitochondrial dynamics involves the change in size through the fission and fusion process. Abnormality in this process can lead to the formation of giant or fragmented mitochondria, respectively (2.Westermann B. Mitochondrial fusion and fission in cell life and death.Nat. Rev. Mol.

Carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP) 3The abbreviations used are: CCCPcarbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazoneIIMinside inner membranesIOMinside outer membranesMEFmurine embryonic fibroblastOIMoutside inner membranesOOMoutside outer membranes. is a reversible mitochondria uncoupler. CCCP rapidly causes mitochondrial depolarization and fragmentation, which can in turn broadly affect mitochondrial functions and trigger multiple responses (3.Chan D.C.

Here we report that CCCP can trigger a unique form of mitochondrial dynamic process, which is characterized by a distinct structural transformation. This allows the formation of a spherical mitochondrion, here called a mitochondrial spheroid, which enwraps cytoplasm and other organelles.

CCCP was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. Anti-Tom20 was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). The secondary antibody for immuno-EM was conjugated with 5-nm gold particles (GE Healthcare). Murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) were maintained in DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum (GIBCO) supplemented with l-glutamine, and penicillin/streptomycin. Cells were treated with CCCP (30 μm) for 6 h unless otherwise indicated in the figure legends. Cells were fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 m phosphate buffer (pH 7.4), followed by 1% OsO4. Sections were examined with a JEM 1011CX electron microscope (JEOL, Peabody, MA). Images were acquired digitally. Cells were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde/0.01% glutaraldehyde in PBS. Cells were pelleted in 3% gelatin in PBS and solidified on ice. Small blocks (∼0.5 mm) of the cell pellet were prepared and infiltrated with 2.3 m sucrose at 4 °C overnight. Blocks were mounted on aluminum stubs, frozen, and sectioned. The sections (60 nm) were picked up in drops of 2.3 m sucrose and collected on Formvar-coated mesh grids. After blocking in 1% BSA in PBS the sections were incubated with a primary rabbit anti-Tom20 antibody and subsequently incubated with a secondary antibody conjugated with 5-nm gold particles. The sections were fixed in 1% glutaraldehyde and stained with ice-cold 0.4% uranyl acetate/1% methyl cellulose (pH 4) and dried. The samples were viewed in a Tecnai transmission electron microscope (FEI, Hillsboro, OR). Serial sections (50 nm thick) were collected onto copper slot grids and poststained in 2% uranyl acetate and lead citrate. Images were acquired using a Tecnai 12 transmission electron microscope (Philips Electron Optics, Holland) operating at 80 kV. Mitochondrial membranes were traced by hand, and Amira software (Visage Imaging Inc.) was used to create three-dimensional models of the mitochondrial structures. 250–300-nm sections were picked up on 2 × 1-mm copper slot grids with a 50-nm thick LUXFilm TM support film (Ted Pella, Inc.). The grids were stained with 3% uranyl acetate (aq.) followed by Reynolds lead citrate prior to electron microscopic examination. Images were acquired using a JEM 3200FS electron microscope (JEOL) and the HTR (high tilt) specimen holder (JEOL). All tilt series were recorded over the tilt range of approximately ±60° using the automated tilt series collection program serialEM (9.Mastronarde D.N. Automated electron microscope tomography using robust prediction of specimen movements.J. Struct. Biol. 2005; 152: 36-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (2529) Google Scholar). The thickness of each tomography slice is estimated to be 2–3 nm. Tomograms were generated using IMOD (10.Kremer J.R. Mastronarde D.N. McIntosh J.R. Computer visualization of three-dimensional image data using IMOD.J. Struct. Biol. 1996; 116: 71-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (3601) Google Scholar). For the work presented here, we used either 15-nm colloidal gold fiducials or local patch tracking to align the images prior to three-dimensional reconstruction. Membrane boundaries were manually marked and rendered in the third dimension using IMOD. CCCP has been widely used to study a Parkin-dependent mitophagy process (11.Narendra D. Tanaka A. Suen D.F.

They were not autophagosomes but were identified with typical mitochondrial features, including the double membranes and the cristae. It seemed that a portion of the mitochondrion was compressed, and the loss of the cristae and the matrix at that part allowed the membrane to bend around cytosolic constituents to form a spherical structure (Fig. 1B). These structures could be detected after only 1 h of treatment, reaching the plateau between 6 and 16 h and declining at 24 h (27.Ding W.X. Guo F. Ni H.M. Bockus A. Manley S. Stolz D.B. Eskelinen E.L. Jaeschke H. Yin X.M. Parkin and mitofusins reciprocally regulate mitophagy and mitochondrial spheroid formation.J. Biol.

Immuno-EM analysis with an antibody against a mitochondrial outer membrane protein, Tom20, found the signals present in both the outside and inside of the vesicular structure (Fig. 1C), further confirming their mitochondrial origin and the topological evolution. Various cytoplasmic components, including the cytosol, membranes, vesicles and even another mitochondrion, could be found in the engulfing mitochondria (Fig. 1B), suggesting that they could be nonselectively enclosed by the extended mitochondrial membranes during the formation of the spherical structure. As such, these structures were operationally named mitochondrial spheroids although it is not clear whether the enclosed materials were actively or passively engulfed by the mitochondria. Ring-shaped mitochondrial structures had been reported in early studies based on either fluorescence microscopy (18.Messerschmitt M. Jakobs S. Vogel F. Fritz S. Dimmer K.S. Neupert W. Westermann B.

It was possible that the mitochondrial structure described here could simply reflect a fusion between two ends of a mitochondrion, as suggested by many of these studies. To determine whether this was the case, we performed serial sections for EM examination. Through the analysis of a total of 22 ring-shaped mitochondria with serial sections, we found that they actually represented spherical structures that were mostly delimited (Fig. 2 and supplemental Fig. S1, A and B). Thus, the structure was not simply formed by a simple fusion between two parts of a mitochondrion, resulting in a “donut,” but rather involved a three-dimensional transformation of the entire mitochondrion, forming a clearly defined internal space surrounded by the mitochondrial membranes. Interestingly, in all of such structures analyzed, there was a small orifice present in the spherical structure. This seemed to provide a pathway connecting the internal space, or the lumen, to the cytoplasm. No similar configurations had been found in a regular mitochondrion (supplemental Fig. S1C). To further understand the topological relationship of the membranes that form the mitochondrial spheroids, we conducted electron tomography. Shown in Fig. 3A and supplemental Video 1 are three examples of mitochondrial spheroids, among which two were subjected to reconstruction (Fig. 3, B and C, and supplemental Videos 2 and 3). The reconstruction indicated that the vesicular lumen was formed by the original outer membranes, now termed the inside outer membranes (IOM). The peripheral boundary of the mitochondrial spheroids was still defined by the outer membranes, now termed the outside outer membranes (OOM). OOM and IOM connected to each other due to the presence of the orifice, which was surrounded by these membranes. As such, the luminal contents could have exchanges with the cytoplasm. Not depicted in Fig. 3, B and C, but in Fig. 4 and supplemental Videos 4 and 5 were the original inner membranes, which were lined against the inside and outside outer membranes, and could thus also be categorized as inside inner membranes (IIM) and outside inner membranes (OIM) (Fig. 4). Between the membranes the matrix and the cristae were redistributed nonsymmetrically with certain parts left with membranes only (FIGURE 3, FIGURE 4). Mitochondrial matrix could be defined in a portion of the mitochondrial spheroid between IIM and OIM, but not in other part of the structure, which was bordered by only four layers of membranes (IOM, IIM, OIM and OOM) (Fig. 1B). Cristae were readily identified in the matrix space (Fig. 4). They remained the lamellar form and were contiguous to the inner membranes. Overall, the electron tomography gave rise to a clear depiction of the spherical nature and membrane topology of the mitochondrial spheroid. Mitochondrial spheroids can manifest as ring-shaped mitochondria on conventional transmission EM (Fig. 1). Many studies, using EM (18.Messerschmitt M. Jakobs S. Vogel F. Fritz S. Dimmer K.S.

However, the actual morphology can vary significantly, and it is not clear whether the same subcellular phenomenon had been investigated in these cases. This is particularly true when the description of the mitochondrial morphology is based solely on fluorescence microscopy. Hence different mechanisms could account for the similar but not necessarily exact morphological changes of the mitochondria under these scenarios. Whereas the ring-shaped mitochondria could be found in apparently normal tissues (22.Christensen A.K. Chapman G.B. Cup-shaped mitochondria in interstitial cells of the albino rat testis.Exp.

This conversion may be due to end-to-end or end-to-side fusion of elongated mitochondria at two-dimensional level, forming donut-shaped mitochondria as suggested by some of the studies (18.Messerschmitt M. Jakobs S. Vogel F. Fritz S. Dimmer K.S. Neupert W. Westermann B. The inner membrane protein Mdm33 controls mitochondrial morphology in yeast.J.

Retinal pigment epithelium: ring mitochondria and lesions induced by continuous light.Curr. Eye Res. 1982; 2: 855-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Alternatively, this conversion can represent a vesicle-like structure with a lumen surrounded by the mitochondrial membranes, as supported by the present study. We have also structurally identified the presence of a pore, which would allow the cytoplasm trapped in the lumen to be confluent with the external cytoplasm. However, it is not clear whether this represents an incomplete fusion of the membrane or an integrated part of the structural feature. The significance of such a pore is thus unknown at this time. Our model is supported by both serial sections and tomographic reconstruction. It would be also supported by two earlier studies where serial sections were performed (24.Stephens R.J. Bils R.F. An atypical mitochondrial form in normal rat liver.J. Cell Biol. 1965; 24: 500-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 26.Lauber J.K. Retinal pigment epithelium: ring mitochondria and lesions induced by continuous light.Curr.

Cell Biol. 1965; 24: 500-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Electron tomography further reveals the membrane topology that may explain how the spherical structure is formed. Mitochondrial spheroid formation would require the extension of the mitochondrial membranes to bend around the cytoplasm to form a new spherical structure with an internal lumen, in which cytosolic materials are likely trapped nonspecifically (FIGURE 1, FIGURE 2). The revelation of these three-dimensional features provides the rationale to categorize this mitochondrial structure in its own group. The morphology of the mitochondrial spheroid looks almost like a phagosome in the sense that the spherical structure enwraps the cytosolic contents in the internal space. However, whether this transformation may involve any molecular events similar to the membrane dynamics responsible for phagocytosis (as in heterophagosome or autophagosome formation) is not known. We have investigated several molecular mechanisms that could be involved in the formation of the spherical mitochondria following CCCP treatment (27.Ding W.X. Guo F. Ni H.M. Bockus A. Manley S. Stolz D.B. Eskelinen E.L. Jaeschke H. Yin X.M. Parkin and mitofusins reciprocally regulate mitophagy and mitochondrial spheroid formation.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287 (October 24): 42379-42388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The autophagy machinery does not seem to be required, but reactive oxygen species and mitofusins are required. In addition, Parkin serves as a negative regulator by promoting mitofusin degradation. Mitofusins are known to function in mitochondrial tethering and fusion. Thus mitofusins can be equally important in the self-fusion of the mitochondrial membrane during the formation of mitochondrial spheroid. However, there would likely be other molecular events to affect the membrane curvature for such a process to initiate and to complete. In particular, mechanisms for curvature and branching of filamentous mitochondria are little understood, and they could be conceivably involved in the formation of mitochondrial spheroids. The significance of the mitochondrial spheroids has yet to be fully determined. Common autophagy inducers, such as starvation and endoplasmic reticulum stress, did not induce mitochondrial spheroids. CCCP can induce oxidative mitochondrial damage. Another inducer of mitochondrial spheroids, sodium azide, is also a mitochondrial toxin (27.Ding W.X. Guo F. Ni H.M. Bockus A. Manley S. Stolz D.B. Eskelinen E.L. Jaeschke H. Yin X.M. Parkin and mitofusins reciprocally regulate mitophagy and mitochondrial spheroid formation.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287 (October 24): 42379-42388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). An earlier study (23.Kiessling K.H. Tobe U. Degeneration of liver mitochondria in rats after prolonged alcohol consumption.Exp. Cell Res. 1964; 33: 350-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) found this type of mitochondria in the livers of rat given long term alcohol diet. Furthermore, we had found that acetaminophen at a dose that induces significant oxidative mitochondrial damage, also induced mitochondrial spheroids in hepatocytes in vivo (27.Ding W.X. Guo F. Ni H.M. Bockus A. Manley S. Stolz D.B. Eskelinen E.L. Jaeschke H. Yin X.M. Parkin and mitofusins reciprocally regulate mitophagy and mitochondrial spheroid formation.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287 (October 24): 42379-42388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). In both CCCP and acetaminophen cases, antioxidants could prevent mitochondrial spheroid formation. Finally, the number of these spherical mitochondria increased with age in retinal pigment epithelium in birds, which may be related to long term light stimulation (26.Lauber J.K. Retinal pigment epithelium: ring mitochondria and lesions induced by continuous light.Curr. Eye Res. 1982; 2: 855-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). It is thus tempting to suggest that this type of mitochondrial dynamics could be involved in pathological conditions that involve mitochondrial oxidative injury. In a separate study (27.Ding W.X. Guo F. Ni H.M. Bockus A. Manley S. Stolz D.B. Eskelinen E.L. Jaeschke H. Yin X.M. Parkin and mitofusins reciprocally regulate mitophagy and mitochondrial spheroid formation.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287 (October 24): 42379-42388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) we reported that CCCP-induced mitochondrial spheroids formation can be a reversible process as other CCCP-induced phenomena, such as mitochondrial depolarization, mitochondrial fragmentation, and autophagy induction because all of these changes will disappear when CCCP is removed from the medium. These findings could suggest that once an adverse pathological condition is remedied, this mitochondrial alteration could be reversed. In conclusion, mitochondrial spheroid formation represents a novel mitochondrial dynamic process that is distinctive from other commonly known dynamics. The formation of such a spherical structure poses challenging questions regarding the membrane dynamics, molecular details and pathophysiological consequences, which need to be resolved in the future.

https://openalex.org/W2103310610,"Viral infections are detected in most cases by the host innate immune system through pattern-recognition receptors (PRR), the sensors for pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), which induce the production of cytokines, such as type I interferons (IFN). Recent identification in mammalian and teleost fish of cytoplasmic viral RNA sensors, RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs), and their mitochondrial adaptor: the mitochondrial antiviral signaling (MAVS) protein, also called IPS-1, highlight their important role in the induction of IFN at the early stage of a virus infection. More recently, an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) adaptor: the stimulator of interferon genes (STING) protein, also called MITA, ERIS and MPYS, has been shown to play a pivotal role in response to both non-self-cytosolic RNA and dsDNA. In this study, we cloned STING cDNAs from zebrafish and showed that it was an ortholog to mammalian STING. We demonstrated that overexpression of this ER protein in fish cells led to a constitutive induction of IFN and interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs). STING-overexpressing cells were almost fully protected against RNA virus infection with a strong inhibition of both DNA and RNA virus replication. In addition, we found that together with MAVS, STING was an important player in the RIG-I IFN-inducing pathway. This report provides the demonstration that teleost fish possess a functional RLR pathway in which MAVS and STING are downstream signaling molecules of RIG-I. The Sequences presented in this article have been submitted to GenBank under accession numbers: Zebrafish STING (HE856619); EPC STING (HE856620); EPC IRF3 (HE856621); EPC IFN promoter (HE856618)."

The purpose of this study is to investigate the protective effect of Lycium barbarum polysaccharides (LBP) and its protective mechanisms in the AOH insult. LBP has been shown to exhibit neuroprotective effect in the chronic ocular hypertension (COH) experiments. AOH mouse model was induced in unilateral eye for one hour by introducing 90 mmHg ocular pressure. The animal was fed with LBP solution (1 mg/kg) or vehicle daily from 7 days before the AOH insult till sacrifice at either day 4 or day 7 post insult. The neuroprotective effects of LBP on retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) and blood-retinal-barrier (BRB) were evaluated. In control AOH retina, loss of RGCs, thinning of IRL thickness, increased IgG leakage, broken tight junctions, and decreased density of retinal blood vessels were observed. However, in LBP-treated AOH retina, there was less loss of RGCs with thinning of IRL thickness, IgG leakage, more continued structure of tight junctions associated with higher level of occludin protein and the recovery of the blood vessel density when compared with vehicle-treated AOH retina. Moreover, we found that LBP provides neuroprotection by down-regulating RAGE, ET-1, Aβ and AGE in the retina, as well as their related signaling pathways, which was related to inhibiting vascular damages and the neuronal degeneration in AOH insults. The present study suggests that LBP could prevent damage to RGCs from AOH-induced ischemic injury; furthermore, through its effects on blood vessel protection, LBP would also be a potential treatment for vascular-related retinopathy."

One class of antimicrobial peptides are the defensins, which have been found in different species. Here we describe a new fungal defensin, eurocin. Eurocin acts against a range of Gram-positive human pathogens but not against Gram-negative bacteria. Eurocin consists of 42 amino acids, forming a cysteine-stabilized α/β-fold. The thermal denaturation data point shows the disulfide bridges being responsible for the stability of the fold. Eurocin does not form pores in cell membranes at physiologically relevant concentrations; it does, however, lead to limited leakage of a fluorophore from small unilamellar vesicles. Eurocin interacts with detergent micelles, and it inhibits the synthesis of cell walls by binding equimolarly to the cell wall precursor lipid II."
https://openalex.org/W1965998034,"In cancer, glucose uptake and glycolysis are increased regardless of the oxygen concentration in the cell, a phenomenon known as the Warburg effect. Several (but not all) glycolytic enzymes have been investigated as potential therapeutic targets for cancer treatment using RNAi. Here, four previously untargeted glycolytic enzymes, aldolase A, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase, triose phosphate isomerase, and enolase 1, are targeted using RNAi in Ras-transformed NIH-3T3 cells. Of these enzymes, knockdown of aldolase causes the greatest effect, inhibiting cell proliferation by 90%. This defect is rescued by expression of exogenous aldolase. However, aldolase knockdown does not affect glycolytic flux or intracellular ATP concentration, indicating a non-metabolic cause for the cell proliferation defect. Furthermore, this defect could be rescued with an enzymatically dead aldolase variant that retains the known F-actin binding ability of aldolase. One possible model for how aldolase knockdown may inhibit transformed cell proliferation is through its disruption of actin-cytoskeleton dynamics in cell division. Consistent with this hypothesis, aldolase knockdown cells show increased multinucleation. These results are compared with other studies targeting glycolytic enzymes with RNAi in the context of cancer cell proliferation and suggest that aldolase may be a useful target in the treatment of cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2015708044,"A novel lectin structure was found for a 17-kDa α-D-galactose-binding lectin (termed ""MytiLec"") isolated from the Mediterranean mussel, Mytilus galloprovincialis. The complete primary structure of the lectin was determined by Edman degradation and mass spectrometric analysis. MytiLec was found to consist of 149 amino acids with a total molecular mass of 16,812.59 Da by Fourier transform-ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry, in good agreement with the calculated value of 16,823.22 Da. MytiLec had an N terminus of acetylthreonine and a primary structure that was highly novel in comparison with those of all known lectins in the structure database. The polypeptide structure consisted of three tandem-repeat domains of ∼50 amino acids each having 45-52% homology with each other. Frontal affinity chromatography technology indicated that MytiLec bound specifically to globotriose (Gb3; Galα1-4Galβ1-4Glc), the epitope of globotriaosylceramide. MytiLec showed a dose-dependent cytotoxic effect on human Burkitt lymphoma Raji cells (which have high surface expression of Gb3) but had no such effect on erythroleukemia K562 cells (which do not express Gb3). The cytotoxic effect of MytiLec was specifically blocked by the co-presence of an α-galactoside. MytiLec treatment of Raji cells caused increased binding of anti-annexin V antibody and incorporation of propidium iodide, which are indicators of cell membrane inversion and perforation. MytiLec is the first reported lectin having a primary structure with the highly novel triple tandem-repeat domain and showing transduction of apoptotic signaling against Burkitt lymphoma cells by interaction with a glycosphingolipid-enriched microdomain containing Gb3."

Here, we discovered a novel signaling pathway whereby ROCK regulates microtubule (MT) acetylation via phosphorylation of the tubulin polymerization promoting protein 1 (TPPP1/p25). We show that ROCK phosphorylation of TPPP1 inhibits the interaction between TPPP1 and histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6), which in turn results in increased HDAC6 activity followed by a decrease in MT acetylation. As a consequence, we show that TPPP1 phosphorylation by ROCK increases cell migration and invasion via modulation of cellular acetyl MT levels. We establish here that the ROCK-TPPP1-HDAC6 signaling pathway is important for the regulation of cell migration and invasion."
https://openalex.org/W2005947296,"Sensory hair cells in the zebrafish lateral line regenerate rapidly and completely after damage. Previous studies have used a variety of ototoxins to kill lateral line hair cells to study different phenomena including mechanisms of hair cell death and regeneration. We sought to directly compare these ototoxins to determine if they differentially affected the rate and amount of hair cell replacement. In addition, previous studies have found evidence of proliferative hair cell regeneration in zebrafish, but both proliferation and non-mitotic direct transdifferentiation have been observed during hair cell regeneration in the sensory epithelia of birds and amphibians. We sought to test whether a similar combination of regenerative mechanisms exist in the fish. We analyzed the time course of regeneration after treatment with different ototoxic compounds and also labeled dividing hair cell progenitors. Certain treatments, including cisplatin and higher concentrations of dissolved copper, significantly delayed regeneration by one or more days. However, cisplatin did not block all regeneration as observed previously in the chick basilar papilla. The particular ototoxin did not appear to affect the mechanism of regeneration, as we observed evidence of recent proliferation in the majority of new hair cells in all cases. Inhibiting proliferation with flubendazole blocked the production of new hair cells and prevented the accumulation of additional precursors, indicating that proliferation has a dominant role during regeneration of lateral line hair cells."

Cellobiose 2-epimerase (CE; EC 5.1.3.11), which converts cellobiose to 4-O-β-d-glucosyl-d-mannose, is a particularly unique enzyme in R. albus, but its physiological function is unclear. Recently, a new metabolic pathway of mannan involving CE was postulated for another CE-producing bacterium, Bacteroides fragilis. In this pathway, β-1,4-mannobiose is epimerized to 4-O-β-d-mannosyl-d-glucose (Man-Glc) by CE, and Man-Glc is phosphorolyzed to α-d-mannosyl 1-phosphate (Man1P) and d-glucose by Man-Glc phosphorylase (MP; EC 2.4.1.281). Ruminococcus albus NE1 showed intracellular MP activity, and two MP isozymes, RaMP1 and RaMP2, were obtained from the cell-free extract. These enzymes were highly specific for the mannosyl residue at the non-reducing end of the substrate and catalyzed the phosphorolysis and synthesis of Man-Glc through a sequential Bi Bi mechanism. In a synthetic reaction, RaMP1 showed high activity only toward d-glucose and 6-deoxy-d-glucose in the presence of Man1P, whereas RaMP2 showed acceptor specificity significantly different from RaMP1. RaMP2 acted on d-glucose derivatives at the C2- and C3-positions, including deoxy- and deoxyfluoro-analogues and epimers, but not on those substituted at the C6-position. Furthermore, RaMP2 had high synthetic activity toward the following oligosaccharides: β-linked glucobioses, maltose, N,N′-diacetylchitobiose, and β-1,4-mannooligosaccharides. Particularly, β-1,4-mannooligosaccharides served as significantly better acceptor substrates for RaMP2 than d-glucose. In the phosphorolytic reactions, RaMP2 had weak activity toward β-1,4-mannobiose but efficiently degraded β-1,4-mannooligosaccharides longer than β-1,4-mannobiose. Consequently, RaMP2 is thought to catalyze the phosphorolysis of β-1,4-mannooligosaccharides longer than β-1,4-mannobiose to produce Man1P and β-1,4-mannobiose.

https://openalex.org/W2064860687,"Nitric oxide (NO) signaling regulates key processes in cardiovascular physiology, specifically vasodilation, platelet aggregation, and leukocyte rolling. Soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC), the mammalian NO sensor, transduces an NO signal into the classical second messenger cyclic GMP (cGMP). NO binds to the ferrous (Fe(2+)) oxidation state of the sGC heme cofactor and stimulates formation of cGMP several hundred-fold. Oxidation of the sGC heme to the ferric (Fe(3+)) state desensitizes the enzyme to NO. The heme-oxidized state of sGC has emerged as a potential therapeutic target in the treatment of cardiovascular disease. Here, we investigate the molecular mechanism of NO desensitization and find that sGC undergoes a reductive nitrosylation reaction that is coupled to the S-nitrosation of sGC cysteines. We further characterize the kinetics of NO desensitization and find that heme-assisted nitrosothiol formation of β1Cys-78 and β1Cys-122 causes the NO desensitization of ferric sGC. Finally, we provide evidence that the mechanism of reductive nitrosylation is gated by a conformational change of the protein. These results yield insights into the function and dysfunction of sGC in cardiovascular disease."
https://openalex.org/W2143348633,"Innervation of nociceptive nerve fibres into the normally aneural nucleus pulposus (NP) of the intervertebral disc (IVD) occurs during degeneration resulting in discogenic back pain. The neurotrophins nerve growth factor (NGF) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), which are associated with stimulation of axonal outgrowth and nociception by neuronal cells, are both expressed by NP cells, with BDNF levels increasing with disease severity. However the mechanism of interaction between human NP cells and neural cells has yet to be fully elucidated. Therefore the aim of this study was to determine whether non-degenerate or degenerate human NP cells inhibit or stimulate neural outgrowth and whether any outgrowth is mediated by NGF or BDNF. Human NP cells from non-degenerate and degenerate IVD were cultured in alginate beads then co-cultured for 48 hours with human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells. Co-culture of non-degenerate NP cells with neural cells resulted in both an inhibition of neurite outgrowth and reduction in percentage of neurite expressing cells. Conversely co-culture with degenerate NP cells resulted in an increase in both neurite length and percentage of neurite expressing cells. Addition of anti-NGF to the co-culture with degenerate cells resulted in a decrease in percentage of neurite expressing cells, while addition of anti-BDNF resulted in a decrease in both neurite length and percentage of neurite expressing cells. Our findings show that while non-degenerate NP cells are capable of inhibiting neurite outgrowth from human neural cells, degenerate NP cells stimulate outgrowth. Neurotrophin blocking studies demonstrated that both NGF and BDNF, secreted by degenerate NP cells, may play a role in this stimulation with BDNF potentially playing the predominant role. These findings suggest that NP cells are capable of regulating nerve ingrowth and that neoinnervation occurring during IVD degeneration may be stimulated by the NP cells themselves."
https://openalex.org/W2079544086,"Replicative DNA polymerases (Pols) help to maintain the high fidelity of replication in large part through their strong selectivity against mispaired deoxyribonucleotides. It has recently been demonstrated that several replicative Pols from yeast have surprisingly low selectivity for deoxyribonucleotides over their analogous ribonucleotides. In human cells, ribonucleotides are found in great abundance over deoxyribonucleotides, raising the possibility that ribonucleotides are incorporated in the human genome at significant levels during normal cellular functions. To address this possibility, the ability of human DNA polymerase ε to incorporate ribonucleotides was tested. At physiological concentrations of nucleotides, human Pol ε readily inserts and extends from incorporated ribonucleotides. Almost half of inserted ribonucleotides escape proofreading by 3' → 5' exonuclease-proficient Pol ε, indicating that ribonucleotide incorporation by Pol ε is likely a significant event in human cells. Human Pol ε is also efficient at extending from primers terminating in up to five consecutive ribonucleotides. This efficient extension appears to result from reduced exonuclease activity on primers containing consecutive 3'-terminal ribonucleotides. These biochemical properties suggest that Pol ε is a likely source of ribonucleotides in human genomic DNA."

The development of in-car countermeasures is a future challenge to prevent sleep-related accidents. The aim of this study is to determine whether continuous exposure to monochromatic light in the short wavelengths (blue light), placed on the dashboard, improves night-time driving performance. In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over study, 48 healthy male participants (aged 20-50 years) drove 400 km (250 miles) on motorway during night-time. They randomly and consecutively received either continuous blue light exposure (GOLite, Philips, 468 nm) during driving or 2*200 mg of caffeine or placebo of caffeine before and during the break. Treatments were separated by at least 1 week. The outcomes were number of inappropriate line crossings (ILC) and mean standard deviation of the lateral position (SDLP). Eight participants (17%) complained about dazzle during blue light exposure and were removed from the analysis. Results from the 40 remaining participants (mean age ± SD: 32.9±11.1) showed that countermeasures reduced the number of inappropriate line crossings (ILC) (F(2,91.11) = 6.64; p<0.05). Indeed, ILC were lower with coffee (12.51 [95% CI, 5.86 to 19.66], p = 0.001) and blue light (14.58 [CI, 8.75 to 22.58], p = 0.003) than with placebo (26.42 [CI, 19.90 to 33.71]). Similar results were found for SDLP. Treatments did not modify the quality, quantity and timing of 3 subsequent nocturnal sleep episodes. Despite a lesser tolerance, a non-inferior efficacy of continuous nocturnal blue light exposure compared with caffeine suggests that this in-car countermeasure, used occasionally, could be used to fight nocturnal sleepiness at the wheel in blue light-tolerant drivers, whatever their age. More studies are needed to determine the reproducibility of data and to verify if it can be generalized to women.ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01070004."
https://openalex.org/W2013289028,"Background Recently, a clone of MRSA with clonal complex 398 (CC398) has emerged that is related to an extensive reservoir in animals, especially pigs and veal calves. It has been reported previously that methicillin-susceptible variants of CC398 circulate among humans at low frequency, and these have been isolated in a few cases of bloodstream infections (BSI). The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence of S. aureus CC398 in blood cultures taken from patients in a geographic area with a high density of pigs. Methodology/Principal Findings In total, 612 consecutive episodes of S. aureus BSI diagnosed before and during the emergence of CC398 were included. Three strains (2 MSSA and 1 MRSA) that were isolated from bacteremic patients between 2010–2011 were positive in a CC398 specific PCR. There was a marked increase in prevalence of S. aureus CC398 BSI isolated between 2010–2011 compared to the combined collections that were isolated between 1996–1998 and 2002–2005 (3/157, 1.9% vs. 0/455, 0.0%; p = 0.017). Conclusions/Significance In conclusion, in an area with a relative high density of pigs, S. aureus CC398 was found as a cause of BSI in humans only recently. This indicates that S. aureus CC398 is able to cause invasive infections in humans and that the prevalence is rising. Careful monitoring of the evolution and epidemiology of S. aureus CC398 in animals and humans is therefore important."

Although transcriptome analyses have been extensively studied in the past, a systematic study of differential gene expression has not been performed in Japanese apricot. To investigate genes related to the pistil development of Japanese apricot, high-throughput sequencing technology (Illumina) was employed to survey gene expression profiles from perfect and imperfect Japanese apricot flower buds. 3,476,249 and 3,580,677 tags were sequenced from two libraries constructed from perfect and imperfect flower buds of Japanese apricot, respectively. There were 689 significant differentially-expressed genes between the two libraries. GO annotation revealed that highly ranked genes were those implicated in small molecule metabolism, cellular component organisation or biogenesis at the cellular level and fatty acid metabolism. According to the results, we assumed that late embryogenesis abundant protein (LEA), Dicer-like 3 (DCL3) Xyloglucan endotransglucosylase/hydrolase 2 (XTH2), Pectin lyase-like superfamily protein (PPME1), Lipid transfer protein 3 (LTP3), Fatty acid biosynthesis 1 (FAB1) and Fatty acid desaturase 5 (FAD5) might have relationships with the pistil abortion in Japanese apricot. The expression patterns of 36 differentially expressed genes were confirmed by real-time (RT)-PCR. This is the first report of the Illumina RNA-seq technique being used for the analysis of differentially-expressed gene profiles related to pistil abortion that both computationally and experimentally provides valuable information for the further functional characterisation of genes associated with pistil development in woody plants."
https://openalex.org/W2021038702,"Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is an aggressive disease with a high rate of metastasis. Recent studies have indicated that the Notch signalling pathway is important in PDAC initiation and maintenance, although the specific cell biological roles of the pathway remain to be established. Here we sought to examine this question in established pancreatic cancer cell lines using the γ-secretase inhibitor IX (GSI IX) to inactivate Notch. Based on the known roles of Notch in development and stem cell biology, we focused on effects on epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) and on pancreatic tumor initiating CD44+/EpCAM+ cells. We analyzed the effect of the GSI IX on growth and epithelial plasticity of human pancreatic cancer cell lines, and on the tumorigenicity of pancreatic tumor initiating CD44+/EpCAM+ cells. Notably, apoptosis was induced after GSI IX treatment and EMT markers were selectively targeted. Furthermore, under GSI IX treatment, decline in the growth of pancreatic tumor initiating CD44+/EpCAM+ cells was observed in vitro and in a xenograft mouse model. This study demonstrates a central role of Notch signalling pathway in pancreatic cancer pathogenesis and identifies an effective approach to inhibit selectively EMT and suppress tumorigenesis by eliminating pancreatic tumor initiating CD44+/EpCAM+ cells."
https://openalex.org/W2111819273,"Context-free grammars are fundamental for the description of linguistic syntax. However, most artificial grammar learning experiments have explored learning of simpler finite-state grammars, while studies exploring context-free grammars have not assessed awareness and implicitness. This paper explores the implicit learning of context-free grammars employing features of hierarchical organization, recursive embedding and long-distance dependencies. The grammars also featured the distinction between left- and right-branching structures, as well as between centre- and tail-embedding, both distinctions found in natural languages. People acquired unconscious knowledge of relations between grammatical classes even for dependencies over long distances, in ways that went beyond learning simpler relations (e.g. n-grams) between individual words. The structural distinctions drawn from linguistics also proved important as performance was greater for tail-embedding than centre-embedding structures. The results suggest the plausibility of implicit learning of complex context-free structures, which model some features of natural languages. They support the relevance of artificial grammar learning for probing mechanisms of language learning and challenge existing theories and computational models of implicit learning."
https://openalex.org/W2167745993,"Purpose We have previously shown that production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is an important contributor to renal injury and inflammation following exposure to oxalate (Ox) or calcium-oxalate (CaOx) crystals. The present study was conducted, utilizing global transcriptome analyses, to determine the effect of Apocynin on changes in the NADPH oxidase system activated in kidneys of rats fed a diet leading to hyperoxaluria and CaOx crystal deposition. Approach Age-, sex- and weight-matched rats were either fed regular rat chow or regular rat chow supplemented with 5% w/w hydroxy-L-proline (HLP). Half of the rats on the HLP diet were also placed on Apocynin-supplemented H2O. After 28 days, each rat was euthanized, their kidneys freshly explanted and dissected to obtain both cortex and medulla tissues. Total RNA was extracted from each tissue and subjected to genomic microarrays to obtain global transcriptome data. KEGG was used to identify gene clusters with differentially expressed genes. Immunohistochemistry was used to confirm protein expressions of selected genes. Results Genes encoding both membrane- and cytosolic-NADPH oxidase complex-associated proteins, together with p21rac and Rap1a, were coordinately up-regulated significantly in both renal medulla and cortex tissues in the HLP-fed rats compared to normal healthy untreated controls. Activation of NADPH oxidase appears to occur via the angiotensin-II/angiotensin-II receptor-2 pathway, although the DAG-PKC pathway of neutrophils may also contribute. Immuno histochemical staining confirmed up-regulated gene expressions. Simultaneously, genes encoding ROS scavenger proteins were down-regulated. HLP-fed rats receiving Apocynin had a complete reversal in the differential-expression of the NADPH oxidase system genes, despite showing similar levels of hyperoxaluria. Conclusions A strong up-regulation of an oxidative/respiratory burst involving the NADPH oxidase system, activated via the angiotensin-II and most likely the DAG-PKC pathways, occurs in kidneys of hyperoxaluric rats. Apocynin treatment reversed this activation without affecting the levels of hyperoxaluria."
https://openalex.org/W2038341034,"Background We aimed to determine the effect of feeding transgenic maize to sows during gestation and lactation on maternal and offspring immunity and to assess the fate of transgenic material. Methodology/Principal Findings On the day of insemination, sows were assigned to one of two treatments (n = 12/treatment); 1) non-Bt control maize diet or 2) Bt-MON810 maize diet, which were fed for ∼143 days throughout gestation and lactation. Immune function was assessed by leukocyte phenotyping, haematology and Cry1Ab-specific antibody presence in blood on days 0, 28 and 110 of gestation and at the end of lactation. Peripheral-blood mononuclear cell cytokine production was investigated on days 28 and 110 of gestation. Haematological analysis was performed on offspring at birth (n = 12/treatment). Presence of the cry1Ab transgene was assessed in sows' blood and faeces on day 110 of gestation and in blood and tissues of offspring at birth. Cry1Ab protein presence was assessed in sows' blood during gestation and lactation and in tissues of offspring at birth. Blood monocyte count and percentage were higher (P<0.05), while granulocyte percentage was lower (P<0.05) in Bt maize-fed sows on day 110 of gestation. Leukocyte count and granulocyte count and percentage were lower (P<0.05), while lymphocyte percentage was higher (P<0.05) in offspring of Bt maize-fed sows. Bt maize-fed sows had a lower percentage of monocytes on day 28 of lactation and of CD4+CD8+ lymphocytes on day 110 of gestation, day 28 of lactation and overall (P<0.05). Cytokine production was similar between treatments. Transgenic material or Cry1Ab-specific antibodies were not detected in sows or offspring. Conclusions/Significance Treatment differences observed following feeding of Bt maize to sows did not indicate inflammation or allergy and are unlikely to be of major importance. These results provide additional data for Bt maize safety assessment."
https://openalex.org/W2049380481,"Sensorimotor control has traditionally been considered from a control theory perspective, without relation to neurobiology. In contrast, here we utilized a spiking-neuron model of motor cortex and trained it to perform a simple movement task, which consisted of rotating a single-joint ""forearm"" to a target. Learning was based on a reinforcement mechanism analogous to that of the dopamine system. This provided a global reward or punishment signal in response to decreasing or increasing distance from hand to target, respectively. Output was partially driven by Poisson motor babbling, creating stochastic movements that could then be shaped by learning. The virtual forearm consisted of a single segment rotated around an elbow joint, controlled by flexor and extensor muscles. The model consisted of 144 excitatory and 64 inhibitory event-based neurons, each with AMPA, NMDA, and GABA synapses. Proprioceptive cell input to this model encoded the 2 muscle lengths. Plasticity was only enabled in feedforward connections between input and output excitatory units, using spike-timing-dependent eligibility traces for synaptic credit or blame assignment. Learning resulted from a global 3-valued signal: reward (+1), no learning (0), or punishment (-1), corresponding to phasic increases, lack of change, or phasic decreases of dopaminergic cell firing, respectively. Successful learning only occurred when both reward and punishment were enabled. In this case, 5 target angles were learned successfully within 180 s of simulation time, with a median error of 8 degrees. Motor babbling allowed exploratory learning, but decreased the stability of the learned behavior, since the hand continued moving after reaching the target. Our model demonstrated that a global reinforcement signal, coupled with eligibility traces for synaptic plasticity, can train a spiking sensorimotor network to perform goal-directed motor behavior."
https://openalex.org/W1986808726,"We demonstrate functionalized spiroligomers that mimic the HDM2-bound conformation of the p53 activation domain. Spiroligomers are stereochemically defined, functionalized, spirocyclic monomers coupled through pairs of amide bonds to create spiro-ladder oligomers. Two series of spiroligomers were synthesized, one of structural analogs and one of stereochemical analogs, from which we identified compound 1, that binds HDM2 with a Kd value of 400 nM. The spiroligomer 1 penetrates human liver cancer cells through passive diffusion and in a dose-dependent and time-dependent manner increases the levels of HDM2 more than 30-fold in Huh7 cells in which the p53/HDM2 negative feed-back loop is inoperative. This is a biological effect that is not seen with the HDM2 ligand nutlin-3a. We propose that compound 1 modulates the levels of HDM2 by stabilizing it to proteolysis, allowing it to accumulate in the absence of a p53/HDM2 feedback loop."
https://openalex.org/W2022865318,"Background Shorter growing season and water stress near wheat maturity are the main factors that presumably limit the yield potential of spring wheat due to late seeding in Saskatchewan, Canada. Advancing seeding dates can be a strategy to help producers mitigate the impact of climate change on spring wheat. It is unknown, however, how early farmers can seed while minimizing the risk of spring frost damage and the soil and machinery constraints. Methodology/principal findings This paper explores early seeding dates of spring wheat on the Canadian Prairies under current and projected future climate. To achieve this, (i) weather records from 1961 to 1990 were gathered at three sites with different soil and climate conditions in Saskatchewan, Canada; (ii) four climate databases that included a baseline (treated as historic weather climate during the period of 1961–1990) and three climate change scenarios (2040–2069) developed by the Canadian global climate model (GCM) with the forcing of three greenhouse gas (GHG) emission scenarios (A2, A1B and B1); (iii) seeding dates of spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) under baseline and projected future climate were predicted. Compared with the historical record of seeding dates, the predicted seeding dates were advanced under baseline climate for all sites using our seeding date model. Driven by the predicted temperature increase of the scenarios compared with baseline climate, all climate change scenarios projected significantly earlier seeding dates than those currently used. Compared to the baseline conditions, there is no reduction in grain yield because precipitation increases during sensitive growth stages of wheat, suggesting that there is potential to shift seeding to an earlier date. The average advancement of seeding dates varied among sites and chosen scenarios. The Swift Current (south-west) site has the highest potential for earlier seeding (7 to 11 days) whereas such advancement was small in the Melfort (north-east, 2 to 4 days) region. Conclusions/significance The extent of projected climate change in Saskatchewan indicates that growers in this region have the potential of earlier seeding. The results obtained in this study may be used for adaptation assessments of seeding dates under possible climate change to mitigate the impact of potential warming."
https://openalex.org/W2051662034,"Background Adolescence is a critical stage for bone accrual. It is also decisive for the establishment of behaviors such as smoking and alcohol drinking. Objective To quantify the short- and long-term associations between smoking and drinking initiation and bone mineral density in adolescent girls. Methods We used prospective data from 731 girls identified in public and private schools in Porto, Portugal. Evaluations were conducted when participants were 13 and 17 years old. Bone mineral density (BMD) was measured at the forearm by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry and weight, height and fat-free mass were measured. Pubertal development status was estimated using menarche age. Self-administered questionnaires were used to collect data on smoking and alcohol drinking, physical exercise and calcium and vitamin D intakes. BMD in early and late adolescence was analyzed as a continuous or dichotomous (Z-score cutoff: −1.0) variable. Associations were calculated using linear or logistic regression. Results Over one quarter of these girls had tried smoking by 13, while 59% had drunk alcoholic beverages and 20% had experienced both behaviors by that age. Lower mean BMD at 17 years of age was observed in girls who had ever smoked by 13, as well as in those who reported drinking at that age. There were no significant cross-sectional associations between experience and frequency of smoking or drinking and BMD at 13 years of age. However, we observed significant associations between BMD z-score<−1 in late adolescence and having ever smoked by 13, after adjustment for menarche age and sports practice, (OR = 1.92; 95% CI: 1.21, 3.05) and with ever smoking and drinking in the same period (OR = 2.33; 95% CI: 1.36, 4.00). Conclusion Our study adds prospective evidence to the role of early initiation of smoking and alcohol drinking as relevant markers of lower bone mineral density in late adolescence."
https://openalex.org/W2036083403,"Assistance from non-professional disaster volunteers (hereinafter, volunteers) is essential for disaster victims to recover physically and rebuild their lives; however, disaster victims in some areas are reluctant to accept assistance from volunteers. This study explored factors that may influence collaborative activities between volunteers and victims of earthquake disasters.From July to September 2008, a self-reporting questionnaire survey was conducted with all 302 leaders of neighborhood associations in a city within Niigata Prefecture at the time of the Niigataken Chuetsu-oki Earthquake in 2007. Each factor was determined based on the Health Belief Model. Multiple regression analysis was conducted, using collaborative activities as the objective variable.From 261 valid responses received (response rate 86.4%), 41.3% of leaders collaborated with volunteers, and 60.2% of associations had residents who collaborated with volunteers. Collaboration with volunteers was significantly and positively related to perceived severity of an earthquake disaster (standardized partial regression coefficient β = 0.224, p<0.001) and neighborhood association activities during the earthquake disaster (β = 0.539, p<0.001). A positive and marginally significant relation was found between such collaboration and sense of coherence within a community (β = 0.137, p = 0.06), social capital (β = 0.119, p = 0.08), and perceived benefits (β = 0.116, p = 0.09).Collaboration between disaster victims and volunteers during the response to an earthquake may require the preemptive estimation of damage by residents during normal times and the enhancement of neighborhood association activities during a disaster. For residents to have such estimation abilities, public institutions should provide information related to anticipated disaster damage and appropriate disaster prevention training and education. In addition, residents should create a disaster prevention map with other residents. Lastly, promoting neighborhood association activities may require the participation of many residents in disaster drills and education as well as a preemptive discussion of neighborhood activities during a disaster."

Although studies have shown association of FTO variants with adiposity in adult Indian, its association in Indian children is yet to be confirmed.Here we examined association of FTO variants (rs9939609 and rs8050136) with obesity and related anthropometric and biochemical traits in 3,126 Indian children (aged 11-17 years) including 2,230 normal-weight and 896 over-weight/obese children. We also compared effects observed in the present study with that observed in previous studies on South Asian adults and children of other ethnic groups.The variant rs9939609 showed significant association with risk of obesity [OR = 1.21, P = 2.5 × 10(-3)] and its measures BMI, weight, waist circumference and hip circumference [β range = 0.11 to 0.14 Z-score units; P range = 1.3 × 10(-4) to 1.6 × 10(-7)] in children. The observed effect sizes in Indian children were similar to those reported for European children. Variant rs9939609 explained 0.88% of BMI variance in Indian children. The effect sizes of rs9939609 on BMI and WC were ~2 fold higher in children than adults. Interestingly rs9939609 was also associated with serum levels of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) [β = 0.10 Z-score, P = 5.8 × 10(-3)]. The other variant rs8050136 was in strong linkage disequilibrium with rs9939609 (r(2) = 0.97) and provided similar association results.The study provides first report of association of FTO variants with obesity and related anthropometric traits in Indian children with higher impact in children compared to adults. We also demonstrated association of FTO variant with serum levels of TSH, indicating putative influence of FTO in hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis."
https://openalex.org/W1994143216,"Organ development is a complex spatial process in which local differences in cell proliferation rate play a key role. Understanding this role requires the measurement of the length of the cell cycle at every position of the three-dimensional (3D) structure. This measurement can be accomplished by exposing the developing embryo to two different thymidine analogues for two different durations immediately followed by tissue fixation. This paper presents a method and a dedicated computer program to measure the resulting labelling indices and subsequently calculate and visualize local cell cycle lengths within the 3D morphological context of a developing organ. By applying this method to the developing heart, we show a large difference in cell cycle lengths between the early heart tube and the adjacent mesenchyme of the pericardial wall. Later in development, a local increase in cell size was found to be associated with a decrease in cell cycle length in the region where the chamber myocardium starts to develop. The combined application of halogenated-thymidine double exposure and image processing enables the automated study of local cell cycle parameters in single specimens in a full 3D context. It can be applied in a wide range of research fields ranging from embryonic development to tissue regeneration and cancer research."
https://openalex.org/W2006206088,"Climate change threatens maize productivity in sub-Saharan Africa. To ensure food security, access to locally adapted genetic resources and varieties is an important adaptation measure. Most of the maize grown in Africa is a genetic mix of varieties introduced at different historic times following the birth of the trans-Atlantic economy, and knowledge about geographic structure and local adaptations is limited.A panel of 48 accessions of maize representing various introduction routes and sources of historic and recent germplasm introductions in Africa was genotyped with the MaizeSNP50 array. Spatial genetic structure and genetic relationships in the African panel were analysed separately and in the context of a panel of 265 inbred lines representing global breeding material (based on 26,900 SNPs) and a panel of 1127 landraces from the Americas (270 SNPs). Environmental association analysis was used to detect SNPs associated with three climatic variables based on the full 43,963 SNP dataset.The genetic structure is consistent between subsets of the data and the markers are well suited for resolving relationships and admixture among the accessions. The African accessions are structured in three clusters reflecting historical and current patterns of gene flow from the New World and within Africa. The Sahelian cluster reflects original introductions of Meso-American landraces via Europe and a modern introduction of temperate breeding material. The Western cluster reflects introduction of Coastal Brazilian landraces, as well as a Northeast-West spread of maize through Arabic trade routes across the continent. The Eastern cluster most strongly reflects gene flow from modern introduced tropical varieties. Controlling for population history in a linear model, we identify 79 SNPs associated with maximum temperature during the growing season. The associations located in genes of known importance for abiotic stress tolerance are interesting candidates for local adaptations."

This region is not directly involved in GLUT1 binding of substrate or inhibitors. Rather, transmembrane domain 6 is part of two putative scaffold domains, which coordinate membrane-spanning amphipathic helices that form the sugar translocation pore.

https://openalex.org/W2094342911,"Huntington's disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disorder, which is characterized by progressive motor impairment and cognitive alterations. Changes in energy metabolism, neuroendocrine function, body weight, euglycemia, appetite function, and circadian rhythm can also occur. It is likely that the locus of these alterations is the hypothalamus. We used the HD transgenic (tg) rat model bearing 51 CAG repeats, which exhibits similar HD symptomology as HD patients to investigate hypothalamic function. We conducted detailed hypothalamic proteome analyses and also measured circulating levels of various metabolic hormones and lipids in pre-symptomatic and symptomatic animals. Our results demonstrate that there are significant alterations in HD rat hypothalamic protein expression such as glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), heat shock protein-70, the oxidative damage protein glutathione peroxidase (Gpx4), glycogen synthase1 (Gys1) and the lipid synthesis enzyme acylglycerol-3-phosphate O-acyltransferase 1 (Agpat1). In addition, there are significant alterations in various circulating metabolic hormones and lipids in pre-symptomatic animals including, insulin, leptin, triglycerides and HDL, before any motor or cognitive alterations are apparent. These early metabolic and lipid alterations are likely prodromal signs of hypothalamic dysfunction. Gaining a greater understanding of the hypothalamic and metabolic alterations that occur in HD, could lead to the development of novel therapeutics for early interventional treatment of HD."
https://openalex.org/W1994317932,"Eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF)4E is over-expressed in many types of cancer such as breast, head and neck, and lung. A consequence of increased levels of eIF4E is the preferential translation of pro-tumorigenic proteins (e.g. c-Myc and vascular endothelial growth factor) and as a result is regarded as a potential therapeutic target. In this work a novel phage display peptide has been isolated against eIF4E. From the phage sequence two amino acids were delineated which improved binding when substituted into the eIF4G1 sequence. Neither of these substitutions were involved in direct interactions with eIF4E and acted either via optimization of the helical capping motif or restricting the conformational flexibility of the peptide. In contrast, substitutions of the remaining phage derived amino acids into the eIF4G1 sequence disrupted binding of the peptide to eIF4E. Interestingly when some of these disruptive substitutions were combined with key mutations from the phage peptide, they lead to improved affinities. Atomistic computer simulations revealed that the phage and the eIF4G1 derivative peptide sequences differ subtly in their interaction sites on eIF4E. This raises the issue, especially in the context of planar interaction sites such as those exhibited by eIF4E, that given the intricate plasticity of protein surfaces, the construction of structure-activity relationships should account for the possibility of significant movement in the spatial positioning of the peptide binding interface, including significant librational motions of the peptide."
https://openalex.org/W2038568610,"The gating of voltage-gated ion channels is controlled by the arginine-rich S4 helix of the voltage-sensor domain moving in response to an external potential. Recent studies have suggested that S4 moves in three to four steps to open the conducting pore, thus visiting several intermediate conformations during gating. However, the exact conformational changes are not known in detail. For instance, it has been suggested that there is a local rotation in the helix corresponding to short segments of a 3-helix moving along S4 during opening and closing. Here, we have explored the energetics of the transition between the fully open state (based on the X-ray structure) and the first intermediate state towards channel closing (C), modeled from experimental constraints. We show that conformations within 3 Å of the X-ray structure are obtained in simulations starting from the C model, and directly observe the previously suggested sliding 3-helix region in S4. Through systematic free energy calculations, we show that the C state is a stable intermediate conformation and determine free energy profiles for moving between the states without constraints. Mutations indicate several residues in a narrow hydrophobic band in the voltage sensor contribute to the barrier between the open and C states, with F233 in the S2 helix having the largest influence. Substitution for smaller amino acids reduces the transition cost, while introduction of a larger ring increases it, largely confirming experimental activation shift results. There is a systematic correlation between the local aromatic ring rotation, the arginine barrier crossing, and the corresponding relative free energy. In particular, it appears to be more advantageous for the F233 side chain to rotate towards the extracellular side when arginines cross the hydrophobic region."
https://openalex.org/W2025546522,"Humanized mouse models offer a challenging possibility to study human cell function in vivo. In the huPBL-SCID-huSkin allograft model human skin is transplanted onto immunodeficient mice and allowed to heal. Thereafter allogeneic human peripheral blood mononuclear cells are infused intra peritoneally to induce T cell mediated inflammation and microvessel destruction of the human skin. This model has great potential for in vivo study of human immune cells in (skin) inflammatory processes and for preclinical screening of systemically administered immunomodulating agents. Here we studied the inflammatory skin response of human keratinocytes and human T cells and the concomitant systemic human T cell response. As new findings in the inflamed human skin of the huPBL-SCID-huSkin model we here identified: 1. Parameters of dermal pathology that enable precise quantification of the local skin inflammatory response exemplified by acanthosis, increased expression of human β-defensin-2, Elafin, K16, Ki67 and reduced expression of K10 by microscopy and immunohistochemistry. 2. Induction of human cytokines and chemokines using quantitative real-time PCR. 3. Influx of inflammation associated IL-17A-producing human CD4+ and CD8+ T cells as well as immunoregulatory CD4+Foxp3+ cells using immunohistochemistry and -fluorescence, suggesting that active immune regulation is taking place locally in the inflamed skin. 4. Systemic responses that revealed activated and proliferating human CD4+ and CD8+ T cells that acquired homing marker expression of CD62L and CLA. Finally, we demonstrated the value of the newly identified parameters by showing significant changes upon systemic treatment with the T cell inhibitory agents cyclosporine-A and rapamycin. In summary, here we equipped the huPBL-SCID-huSkin humanized mouse model with relevant tools not only to quantify the inflammatory dermal response, but also to monitor the peripheral immune status. This combined approach will gain our understanding of the dermal immunopathology in humans and benefit the development of novel therapeutics for controlling inflammatory skin diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2045219931,"Genetic researchers often collect disease related quantitative traits in addition to disease status because they are interested in understanding the pathophysiology of disease processes. In genome-wide association (GWA) studies, these quantitative phenotypes may be relevant to disease development and serve as intermediate phenotypes or they could be behavioral or other risk factors that predict disease risk. Statistical tests combining both disease status and quantitative risk factors should be more powerful than case-control studies, as the former incorporates more information about the disease. In this paper, we proposed a modified inverse-variance weighted meta-analysis method to combine disease status and quantitative intermediate phenotype information. The simulation results showed that when an intermediate phenotype was available, the inverse-variance weighted method had more power than did a case-control study of complex diseases, especially in identifying susceptibility loci having minor effects. We further applied this modified meta-analysis to a study of imputed lung cancer genotypes with smoking data in 1154 cases and 1137 matched controls. The most significant SNPs came from the CHRNA3-CHRNA5-CHRNB4 region on chromosome 15q24-25.1, which has been replicated in many other studies. Our results confirm that this CHRNA region is associated with both lung cancer development and smoking behavior. We also detected three significant SNPs--rs1800469, rs1982072, and rs2241714--in the promoter region of the TGFB1 gene on chromosome 19 (p = 1.46×10(-5), 1.18×10(-5), and 6.57×10(-6), respectively). The SNP rs1800469 is reported to be associated with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and lung cancer in cigarette smokers. The present study is the first GWA study to replicate this result. Signals in the 3q26 region were also identified in the meta-analysis. We demonstrate the intermediate phenotype can potentially enhance the power of complex disease association analysis and the modified meta-analysis method is robust to incorporate intermediate phenotype or other quantitative risk factor in the analysis."
https://openalex.org/W2054529889,"Mammalian sex chromosomes originated from a pair of autosomes, and homologous genes on the sex chromosomes (gametologs) differentiated through recombination arrest between the chromosomes. It was hypothesized that this differentiation in eutherians took place in a stepwise fashion and left a footprint on the X chromosome termed ""evolutionary strata."" The evolutionary stratum hypothesis claims that strata 1 and 2 (which correspond to the first two steps of chromosomal differentiation) were generated in the stem lineage of Theria or before the divergence between eutherians and marsupials. However, this prediction relied solely on the molecular clock hypothesis between pairs of human gametologs, and molecular evolution of marsupial sex chromosomal genes has not yet been investigated. In this study, we analyzed the following 7 pairs of marsupial gametologs, together with their eutherian orthologs that reside in stratum 1 or 2: SOX3/SRY, RBMX/Y, RPS4X/Y, HSFX/Y, XKRX/Y, SMCX/Y (KDM5C/D, JARID1C/D), and UBE1X/Y (UBA1/UBA1Y). Phylogenetic analyses and estimated divergence time of these gametologs reveal that they all differentiated at the same time in the therian ancestor. We have also provided strong evidence for gene conversion that occurred in the 3' region of the eutherian stratum 2 genes (SMCX/Y and UBE1X/Y). The results of the present study show that (1) there is no compelling evidence for the second stratum in the stem lineage of Theria; (2) gene conversion, which may have occurred between SMCX/Y and UBE1X/Y in the eutherian lineage, potentially accounts for their apparently lower degree of overall divergence."
https://openalex.org/W2024265552,"Morphogenesis of the secondary palate in mammalian embryos involves two major events: first, reorientation of the two vertically oriented palatal shelves into a horizontal position above the tongue, and second, fusion of the two shelves at the midline. Genetic evidence in humans and mice indicates the involvement of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). As MMP expression patterns might differ from sites of activity, we used a recently developed highly sensitive in situ zymography technique to map gelatinolytic MMP activity in the developing mouse palate. At embryonic day 14.5 (E14.5), we detected strong gelatinolytic activity around the lateral epithelial folds of the nasopharyngeal cavity, which is generated as a consequence of palatal shelf elevation. Activity was concentrated in the basement membrane of the epithelial fold but extended into the adjacent mesenchyme, and increased in intensity with lateral outgrowth of the cavity at E15.5. Gelatinolytic activity at this site was not the consequence of epithelial fold formation, as it was also observed in Bmp7-deficient embryos where shelf elevation is delayed. In this case, gelatinolytic activity appeared in vertical shelves at the exact position where the epithelial fold will form during elevation. Mmp2 and Mmp14 (MT1-MMP), but not Mmp9 and Mmp13, mRNAs were expressed in the mesenchyme around the epithelial folds of the elevated palatal shelves; this was confirmed by immunostaining for MMP-2 and MT1-MMP. Weak gelatinolytic activity was also found at the midline of E14.5 palatal shelves, which increased during fusion at E15.5. Whereas MMPs have been implicated in palatal fusion before, this is the first report showing that gelatinases might contribute to tissue remodeling during early stages of palatal shelf elevation and formation of the nasopharynx."
https://openalex.org/W2085005564,"DNA replication in all eukaryotes starts with the process of loading the replicative helicase MCM2–7 onto chromatin during late mitosis of the cell cycle. MCM2–7 is a key component of the prereplicative complex (pre-RC), which is loaded onto chromatin by the concerted action of origin recognition complex, Cdc6, and Cdt1. Here, we demonstrate that And-1 is assembled onto chromatin in late mitosis and early G1 phase before the assembly of pre-RC in human cells. And-1 forms complexes with MCM2–7 to facilitate the assembly of MCM2–7 onto chromatin at replication origins in late mitosis and G1 phase. We also present data to show that depletion of And-1 significantly reduces the interaction between Cdt1 and MCM7 in G1 phase cells. Thus, human And-1 facilitates loading of the MCM2–7 helicase onto chromatin during the assembly of pre-RC.

DNA replication is regulated by sequential, interactive mechanisms involving many types of proteins acting in concert to ensure that the genome is accurately replicated only once per cell cycle. Initiation of DNA replication in all eukaryotes occurs at replication origins via a process requiring the assembly of a prereplicative complex (pre-RC) 3The abbreviations used are: pre-RCprereplicative complexAnd-1acidic nucleoplasmic DNA-binding protein 1MCM2–7minichromosome maintenance protein 2–7Cdt1Cdc10-dependent transcript 1Cdc6cell division cycle 6ORCorigin recognition complexCldUchlorodeoxyuridineIdUiododeoxyuridine. in late mitosis and G1 phase of cell cycle (1.Bell S.P.

Eukaryotic chromosome DNA replication: where, when, and how?.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2010; 79: 89-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). Pre-RC assembly is a cell cycle-regulated process that starts with the assembly of a six-subunit origin recognition complex (ORC) at replication origins. ORC then promotes the recruitment of two important replication factors, Cdt1 and Cdc6, onto origins in mitosis. Following assembly of Cdc6 and Cdt1 at replication origins, the minichromosome maintenance (MCM) complex is recruited onto origins by the concerted action of ORC, Cdc6, and Cdt1 during late mitosis through G1 phase. The MCM2–7 complex consists of six proteins that are structurally related and highly conserved in eukaryotes (3.Forsburg S.L. Eukaryotic MCM proteins: beyond replication initiation.Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2004; 68: 109-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). MCM2–7 is the replicative helicase, which plays a critical role in both initiation and elongation by unwinding DNA double helix during DNA replication (3.Forsburg S.L.

Cdt1 and Cdc6 are critical for the recruitment of MCM2–7 onto chromatin. Cdt1 interacts with MCM2–7, and this interaction is important for Cdt1 to recruit MCM2–7 onto origins (6.Tanaka S. Diffley J.F. Interdependent nuclear accumulation of budding yeast Cdt1 and Mcm2–7 during G1 phase.Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 198-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Cdc6 promotes the assembly of MCM2–7 onto origins by enhancing the interaction between Cdt1 and MCM2–7 via interactions with both proteins (7.Cook J.G. Chasse D.A. Nevins J.R.

Chem. 2004; 279: 9625-9633Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Following pre-RC assembly at replication origins during the M to G1 phase transition (termed “origin licensing”), the initiation of DNA replication is triggered by the cooperative action of two protein kinases, Cdk2-CcnE and Cdc7-Dbf4. They are required to recruit Cdc45 onto replication origins and to stimulate initiation by phosphorylating MCM2 (1.Bell S.P. Dutta A. DNA replication in eukaryotic cells.Ann. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 333-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (1392) Google Scholar, 8.Sclafani R.A. Cdc7p-Dbf4p becomes famous in the cell cycle.J.

Although the mechanisms governing DNA replication are conserved from yeast to human, exceptions have been reported (10.Machida Y.J. Hamlin J.L. Dutta A. Right place, right time, and only once: replication initiation in metazoans.Cell. 2005; 123: 13-24Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). For example, the histone H4-specific acetylase HBO1 appears to acetylate histone H4 at replication origins to promote the loading of MCM2–7 onto replication origins in human cells (11.Miotto B. Struhl K. HBO1 histone acetylase activity is essential for DNA replication licensing and inhibited by Geminin.Mol.

Thus, human cells clearly contain mechanisms that regulate the loading of MCM2–7 onto replication origins but are absent from yeast cells. Results reported here reveal that And-1 is yet another example. And-1 is an acidic nucleoplasmic DNA-binding protein containing an amino-terminal WD40 domain and a carboxyl-terminal high mobility group motif (15.Zhu W. Ukomadu C. Jha S. Senga T. Dhar S.K. Wohlschlegel J.A. Nutt L.K. Kornbluth S. Dutta A. Mcm10 and And-1/CTF4 recruit DNA polymerase alpha to chromatin for initiation of DNA replication.Genes Dev. 2007; 21: 2288-2299Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). The WD40 domain functions to mediate protein-protein interactions, whereas high mobility group motif has DNA-binding activity, and it usually facilitates the formation of nucleoprotein complexes on the chromatin by modulating DNA structure (16.Bustin M.

Ctf4, the And-1 ortholog in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, was originally identified in a genetic screen for mutants affecting chromosome transmission fidelity (19.Kouprina E.K. Bannikov V. Bliskovsky V.

We previously reported that And-1 is required for loading DNA polymerase α p180 onto chromatin during S phase in Xenopus egg extracts and is required for the maintenance of the stability of DNA polymerase α p180 in human cells (15.Zhu W.

Other studies further indicate that And-1 is involved in the formation of the Cdc45-MCM2–7-GINS (Go, Ichi, Nii, and San) complex, stimulates the activities of DNA polymerases α and ϵ, and couples MCM2–7 to DNA polymerase alpha (24.Bermudez V.P.

More recently, we demonstrated that And-1 interacts with and maintains the stability of the histone acetyltransferase, Gcn5 (29.Li Y. Jaramillo-Lambert A. Hao J. Yang Y. Zhu W. The stability of histone acetyltransferase general control non-derepressible (Gcn) 5 is regulated by Cullin4-RING E3 ubiquitin ligase.J. Biol.

And-1 is required for the stability of histone acetyltransferase Gcn5.Oncogene. 2012; 31: 643-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Thus, And-1 is an important protein that plays multiple roles in the regulation of chromatin function and DNA replication. Using Xenopus egg extracts, we have found that And-1 is loaded onto chromatin in S phase after MCM2–7 chromatin assembly (15.Zhu W. Ukomadu C. Jha S. Senga T. Dhar S.K. Wohlschlegel J.A. Nutt L.K. Kornbluth S. Dutta A. Mcm10 and And-1/CTF4 recruit DNA polymerase alpha to chromatin for initiation of DNA replication.Genes Dev. 2007; 21: 2288-2299Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, we and others (24.Bermudez V.P. Farina A. Tappin I. Hurwitz J. Influence of the human cohesion establishment factor Ctf4/AND-1 on DNA replication.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 9493-9505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 30.Li Y. Jaramillo-Lambert A.N. Yang Y. Williams R. Lee N.H. Zhu W.

In an effort to elucidate the role of And-1 during this period of the mammalian cell cycle, we considered the possibility that human And-1 is recruited onto chromatin during late mitosis in order to play a role in regulating pre-RC assembly. In this study, we investigate the biological function of And-1 during late mitosis and G1 phase in human cells. We find that And-1 forms complex with MCM2–7 and down-regulation of And-1 with siRNA significantly suppresses loading of MCM2–7 onto chromatin in late mitosis and G1 phase. Furthermore, we find that human And-1 interacts with Cdt1, and depletion of And-1 suppresses the interaction between Cdt1 and MCM7 in G1 phase. Thus, our data suggest that human And-1 is an important regulator governing the assembly of MCM2–7 at replication origins during origin licensing in human cells. U2OS, 293T, and HCT116 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% FBS at 37 °C in 5% CO2 supply. HCT116 cells expressing FLAG-And-1 or FLAG alone were constructed by infecting cells with retrovirus expressing FLAG-And-1 or FLAG, followed by single colony selection. Cell cycle synchronization was achieved by treating cells with 40 ng/ml nocodazole in complete medium for 16 h, mitotically arrested cells were harvested by mitotic shake off, followed by washing in PBS, and released into nocodazole-free complete medium. To synchronize cells in G1 phase, l-mimosine (final concentration, 300 μm) was used to treat cells for 24 h. Flow cytometry analysis (FACS) was performed as described previously (31.Zhu W. Chen Y. Dutta A. Rereplication by depletion of geminin is seen regardless of p53 status and activates a G2/M checkpoint.Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 24: 7140-7150Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). siRNA transfections were performed with 100 nm siRNA oligonucleotide duplexes using LipofectamineTM RNAiMAX (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were harvested for analysis 36–48 h after transfection. siRNA oligonucleotides against And-1 were made to the following target sequences (sense): And-1–1, 5′-TGACTCGCTTCACTACAAA-3′; And-1–2, 5′-GATGGTCAAGAAGGCAGCA-3′; And-1–3, 5′-GGTGTAGGTAACAGGACAT-3′; and control Gl2, 5′-AACGTACGCGGAATACTTCGA-3′. Anti-MCM2 (3619), anti-H3K9Ac (9671), anti-H4K5Ac (9672), and H4K12Ac (2591) were from Cell Signaling. Anti-α-tubulin (T6199), anti-FLAG-M2 (A2220), anti GAPDH (G9545) and anti-HA (H9658) were from Sigma. Anti-Gcn5 (sc-20698 and sc-130374), anti-β-actin, anti-PCNA (SC-56), anti-Cdc6 (sc-8342), anti-Mcm7 (sc-9966), anti-Cdt1 (sc-28262), anti-polymerase α (sc-5921), anti-cyclin B1 (sc-752), and anti-Mcm6 (sc9843) were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Anti-Orc2 (559266). Anti-PAN-MCM (559541) was from BD Biosciences Pharmingen. Anti-And-1 was produced as described previously (30.Li Y. Jaramillo-Lambert A.N. Yang Y. Williams R. Lee N.H. Zhu W. And-1 is required for the stability of histone acetyltransferase Gcn5.Oncogene. 2012; 31: 643-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). FLAG-And-1 and GST-And-1 (full-length and various fragments) were constructed as described previously (15.Zhu W. Ukomadu C. Jha S. Senga T. Dhar S.K. Wohlschlegel J.A. Nutt L.K. Kornbluth S. Dutta A. Mcm10 and And-1/CTF4 recruit DNA polymerase alpha to chromatin for initiation of DNA replication.Genes Dev. 2007; 21: 2288-2299Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). To make total protein extracts, cells were lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (150 mm NaCl, 1.0% IGEPAL® CA-630, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, and 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0), followed by sonication. Immunofluorescence assays were described previously (30.Li Y. Jaramillo-Lambert A.N. Yang Y. Williams R. Lee N.H. Zhu W. And-1 is required for the stability of histone acetyltransferase Gcn5.Oncogene. 2012; 31: 643-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Chromatin fractionation assays were performed as described previously (32.Zhu W. Dutta A. An ATR- and BRCA1-mediated Fanconi anemia pathway is required for activating the G2/M checkpoint and DNA damage repair upon rereplication.Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 26: 4601-4611Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Cells were lysed in lysis buffer (25 mm HEPES-KOH at pH 7.6, 150 mm KAc, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm Na2 EGTA, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, protease inhibitor, supplemented with 300 μg/ml ethidium bromide and 15 kunitz units of DNase I) for 20 min on ice, followed by sonication. After centrifugation, the resulting supernatants were mixed with anti-FLAG beads for 2 h. Beads were then washed three times with lysis buffer. Associated proteins were eluted by incubating beads with SDS loading buffer for immunoblotting. FLAG-And-1 immunoprecipitates were prepared as described in immunoprecipitation. Gel bands were excised and digested as described previously (33.Jensen O.N. Wilm M. Shevchenko A. Mann M. Sample preparation methods for mass spectrometric peptide mapping directly from 2-DE gels.Methods Mol. Biol. 1999; 112: 513-530PubMed Google Scholar). Concentrated peptides from each band were injected via an autosampler (6 μl) and loaded onto a Symmetry C18 trap column (5 μm, 300 μm, inner diameter × 23 mm, Waters) for 10 min at a flow rate of 10 μl/min, 100% A. The sample was subsequently separated by a C18 reverse-phase column (Michrom Bioresources) at a flow rate of 300 nl/min using an Eksigent nano-hplc system (Dublin, CA). The mobile phases consisted of water with 0.1% formic acid (A) and 90% acetonitrile (B). A 65 min linear gradient from 5 to 60% B was employed. Eluted peptides were introduced into the mass spectrometer via Michrom Bioresources CaptiveSpray. The spray voltage was set at 1.4 kV, and the heated capillary was set at 200 °C. The LTQ-Orbitrap-XL (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was operated in data-dependent mode with dynamic exclusion in which one cycle of experiments consisted of a full-MS in the Orbitrap (300–2000 m/z) survey scan in profile mode, with a resolution of 30,000, and five subsequent MS/MS scans in the LTQ of the most intense peaks in centroid mode using collision-induced dissociation with the collision gas (helium) and normalized collision energy value set at 35%. Each file was searched for protein identification using the sequest algorithm in the Bioworks Browser software (version 3.3.1, Thermo Fisher Scientific) against the Uniprot database indexed for human species and for fully tryptic peptides, two missed cleavages, and potential modification of oxidized methionine (15.9949 Da). DTA generation parameters were Peptide Tolerance of 50 ppm and Fragment Ion Tolerance of 1 Da. Search result files were loaded into ProteoIQ software (NuSep, Bogart, GA) and filtered based on the following: XCorr > 1.9, four spectra per peptide, two unique peptides per protein, 0.98 peptide probability, and 0.95 protein probability. Protein fold change values were calculated by using the ratio of scan counts for each sample versus its paired control per protein. Protein annotations were acquired using the Keyword and GO terms in the Uniprot Protein Knowledgebase. HCT116 cells transfected with siRNAs were labeled for 20min with 100 μm iododeoxyuridine (IdU), washed in PBS, and then labeled for another 20 min with 100 μm chlorodeoxyuridine (CldU). Cells were then collected by trypsinization, and DNA was gently extracted for molecular combing as described previously (34.Schwob E. de Renty C. Coulon V. Gostan T. Boyer C. Camet-Gabut L. Amato C. Use of DNA combing for studying DNA replication in vivo in yeast and mammalian cells.Methods Mol. Biol. 2009; 521: 673-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). DNA was combed on silanized surfaces (Microsurfaces, Inc.) and denatured in 1 n NaOH and probed with the following primary antibodies: mouse anti-BrdU (IdU-specific; clone BD44, Becton Dickinson), rat anti-BrdU (CldU-specific; clone BU-75, AbD Serotec) and mouse anti-ssDNA (clone 16-19, Millipore). The following secondary antibodies were used: anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 594, anti-rat Alexa Fluor 488, and anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 647, respectively (Invitrogen). Images were acquired on an epifluorescence microscope (BD Pathway) using Attovision software. Signals were measured using NIH ImageJ software with custom-made modifications. The images of DNA fibers were made by aligning selected DNA fibers containing IdU and CldU tracks using Photoshop. Fork velocity data sets were evaluated for statistical significance using non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis test. ChIP assays were carried out with chromatin immunoprecipitation kit (EZ-ChIP, Millipore) according to the manufacturer's instruction manual. Briefly, cells (∼1–2 × 107 cells) were cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde for 10 min and quenched with glycine (final concentration, 0.125 m). Cells were then lysed in 1 ml of cell lysis buffer (1% SDS, 10 mm EDTA, and 50 mm Tris, pH 8.1). Chromatin samples were sonicated to an average size of 500 bp. The chromatin samples were diluted 10-fold in dilution buffer (0.01% SDS, 1.1% Triton X-100, 1.2 mm EDTA, 16.7 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 167 mm NaCl) and precleared with protein G-agarose beads, followed by incubation with 2 μg of antibody. Each immunoprecipitation was incubated for an additional 1 h with protein G-agarose beads. Precipitates were washed with 1 ml of low salt immune complex wash buffer, high salt immune complex wash buffer, LiCl immune complex wash buffer, and then twice with TE (Tris, EDTA) buffer. DNA was then eluted in elution buffer (0.1 m NaHCO3 and 1% SDS) and incubated at 65 °C overnight with NaCl (final concentration, 0.2 m) to reverse the formaldehyde cross-links. DNA was purified using the Qiaquick PCR purification kit. DNA samples were analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR using primers for DNA replication origins and surrounding regions as described (35.Sibani S. Price G.B. Zannis-Hadjopoulos M. Ku80 binds to human replication origins prior to the assembly of the ORC complex.Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 7885-7896Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). To further characterize the role of And-1 in DNA replication, we set out to identify new And-1-associated proteins. To this end, we developed HCT116 cell lines stably expressing FLAG alone or FLAG-And-1 fusion proteins at a level similar to that of the endogenous And-1 (data not shown). We then prepared whole cell extracts from each cell line and subjected the extracts to affinity purification using anti-FLAG beads. To rule out the possibility that the protein interactions were mediated by chromatin, we included ethidium bromide and DNase I in the lysis buffer to destroy chromatin structure. The purified proteins were then resolved by gel electrophoresis, and the resolved proteins were subjected to in-gel digestion followed by mass spectrometry analyses and database searching for protein identification. Through these analyses, we identified proteins that were present more frequently in FLAG-And-1 complexes than in FLAG control complexes. The And-1-associated DNA replication proteins identified in this experiment are listed in Fig. 1, A and B. They include Cdc45, DNA polymerase α (p180), DNA primase subunits 1 and 2 (PRIM1/2), DNA polymerase epsilon catalytic subunit A, claspin, and MCM proteins 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 (Fig. 1, A and B). All of these proteins are known to be involved in the initiation and/or elongation processes of DNA replication. Because we were particularly interested in the associations of And-1 with MCM2–7, we performed co-immunoprecipitation assays to confirm these interactions. As shown in Fig. 1C, we successfully detected DNA polymerase α, MCM2, MCM6, and MCM7 from the FLAG-And-1 but not FLAG immunoprecipitates (Fig. 1C). Thus, our data indicate that And-1 interacts with MCM2–7, suggesting a possible role of And-1 in the regulation of MCM2–7 function. It is known that the total cellular levels of And-1 do not change throughout the cell cycle, but the chromatin-associated And-1 is cell cycle-regulated (15.Zhu W. Ukomadu C. Jha S. Senga T. Dhar S.K.

We and others recently found that unlike Xenopus, And-1 that is loaded onto chromatin at the onset of S phase, human And-1 is loaded onto chromatin in late mitosis (24.Bermudez V.P. Farina A.

And-1 is required for the stability of histone acetyltransferase Gcn5.Oncogene. 2012; 31: 643-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), suggesting an important role of human And-1 in regulating chromatin function during late mitosis through G1 phase. The fact that And-1 interacts with MCM2–7 proteins prompted us to investigate whether human And-1 regulates the association of MCM2–7 with chromatin. To explore this possibility, we first compared the associations of And-1 or MCM7 with chromatin in HCT116 cells at different stages of the cell cycle by immunofluorescence. Both And-1 and MCM7 proteins were dispersed throughout the nucleus during interphase (Fig. 2A). However, at prometaphase, metaphase and anaphase, both proteins dissociated from chromatin, as revealed by the lack of And-1 and MCM7 in the DAPI-stained area (Fig. 2A). At telophase, both And-1 and MCM7 reassociated with chromatin (Fig. 2A). Interestingly, we noticed in some telophase cells that MCM7 was still segregated from the chromosomes, whereas And-1 had already acquired exclusive association with chromosomes (Fig. 2A). Because we did not observe association of MCM2–7 with chromosomes in the absence of chromosome bound And-1 (data not shown), our results suggest that localization of And-1 onto chromosomes precedes that of MCM2–7 during late mitosis. A visualization of the localization of And-1 on the chromatin under microscopy does not definitively indicate an actual association of And-1 with chromatin. To examine the chromatin association of human And-1 in more detail, we analyzed the association of And-1 with chromatin in cells that had been released from mitotic arrest by nocodazole. These cells were harvested at various times after release for chromatin fractionation assays. The DNA content of each f"

It has been reported that in various types of complex visual task, eye movement patterns differ systematically between Chinese and non-Chinese participants, an observation that has been related to differences in culture between groups. However, we confirm here that, in healthy, naïve adult Chinese participants, a far higher proportion (22%) than expected (1–5%) exhibit a pattern of reflexive eye movement behaviour (high numbers of low latency express saccades) in circumstances designed to inhibit such responses (prosaccade overlap tasks). These participants are defined as “express saccade makers” (ESMs). We then show using the antisaccade paradigm, which requires the inhibition of reflexive responses and the programming and execution of voluntary saccades, that the performance of ESMs is compromised; they have higher antisaccade directional error rates, and the latency distributions of their error saccades again exhibit a higher proportion of low latency express saccade errors consistent with a reduced ability to inhibit reflexive responses. These results are difficult to reconcile with a cultural explanation as they relate to important and specific performance differences within a particular population. They suggest a potential unexpected confound relevant to those studies of Chinese versus other groups which have investigated group differences using oculomotor measures, and explained them in terms of culture. The confirmation of higher numbers of ESMs among Chinese participants provides new opportunities for examining oculomotor control."
https://openalex.org/W2056690093,"Like all DNA viruses, human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infection is known to result in profound effects on host cell cycle. Infection of fibroblasts with HCMV is known to induce an advance in cell cycle through the G(0)-G(1) phase and then a subsequent arrest of cell cycle in early S-phase, presumably resulting in a cellular environment optimum for high levels of viral DNA replication whilst precluding replication of cellular DNA. Although the exact mechanisms used to arrest cell cycle by HCMV are unclear, they likely involve a number of viral gene products and evidence points to the ability of the virus to prevent licensing of cellular DNA synthesis. One viral protein known to profoundly alter cell cycle is the viral immediate early 86 (IE86) protein--an established function of which is to initially drive cells into early S phase but then inhibit cellular DNA synthesis. Here we show that, although IE86 interacts with the cellular licensing factor Cdt1, it does not inhibit licensing of cellular origins. Instead, IE86-mediated inhibition of cellular DNA synthesis requires mini-chromosome-maintenance 3 (MCM3) associated protein (MCM3AP), which can cause subsequent inhibition of initiation of cellular DNA synthesis in a licensing-independent manner."
https://openalex.org/W2030111472,"Introduction Obesity-susceptibility loci have been related to adiposity traits in adults and may affect body fat estimates in adolescence. There are indications that different sets of obesity-susceptibility loci influence level of and change in obesity-related traits from adolescence to adulthood. Objectives To investigate whether previously reported obesity-susceptible loci in adults influence adiposity traits in adolescence and change in BMI and waist circumference (WC) from adolescence into young adulthood. We also examined whether physical activity modifies the effects of these genetic loci on adiposity-related traits. Methods Nine obesity-susceptibility variants were genotyped in 1 643 adolescents (13–19 years old) from the HUNT study, Norway, who were followed-up into young adulthood. Lifestyle was assessed using questionnaires and anthropometric measurements were taken. The effects of genetic variants individually and combined in a genetic predisposition score (GPS) on obesity-related traits were studied cross-sectionally and longitudinally. A modifying effect of physical activity was tested. Results The GPS was significantly associated to BMI (B: 0.046 SD/allele [0.020, 0.073], p = 0.001) in adolescence and in young adulthood (B: 0.041 SD/allele [0.015, 0.067], p = 0.002) as it was to waist circumference (WC). The GPS was not associated to change in BMI (p = 0.762) or WC (p = 0.726). We found no significant interaction effect between the GPS and physical activity. Conclusions Our observations suggest that obesity-susceptibility loci established in adults affect BMI and WC already in adolescence. However, an association with change in adiposity-related traits from adolescence to adulthood could not be verified for these loci. Neither could an attenuating effect of physical activity on the association between the obesity-susceptibility genes and body fat estimates be revealed."

This study evaluates whether a simple booklet which is relevant to all research studies improves the understanding of rights needed for subjects to provide informed consent.21 currently used informed consent forms (ICF) from international clinical trials were separated into information related to the specific research study, and general information on participants' rights. A booklet designed to provide information on participants' rights which used simple language was developed to replace this information in current ICF's Readability of each component of ICF's and the booklet was then assessed using the Flesch-Kincaid Reading ease score (FK). To further evaluate the booklet 282 hospital inpatients were randomised to one of three ways to present research information; a standard ICF, the booklet combined with a short ICF, or the booklet combined with a simplified ICF. Comprehension of information related to the research proposal and to participant's rights was assessed by questionnaire.Information related to participants' rights contributed an average of 44% of the words in standard ICFs, and was harder to read than information describing the clinical trial (FK 25 versus (vs.) 41 respectively, p = 0.0003). The booklet reduced the number of words and improved FK from 25 to 42. The simplified ICF had a slightly higher FK score than the standard ICF (50 vs. 42). Comprehension assessed in inpatients was better for the booklet and short ICF 62%, (95% confidence interval (CI) 56 to 67) correct, or simplified ICF 62% (CI 58 to 68) correct compared to 52%, (CI 47 to 57) correct for the standard ICF, p = 0.009. This was due to better understanding of questions on rights (62% vs. 49% correct, p = 0.0008). Comprehension of study related information was similar for the simplified and standard ICF (60% vs. 64% correct, p = 0.68).A booklet provides a simple consistent approach to providing information on participant rights which is relevant to all research studies, and improves comprehension of patients who typically participate in clinical trials."

Segregation is governed by a cycle of ATP-induced polymerization and subsequent depolymerization of the ParA factor. Here, we establish that hyperactive ATPase variants of the ParA homolog ParF display altered segrosome dynamics that block accurate DNA segregation. An arginine finger-like motif in the ParG centromere-binding factor augments ParF ATPase activity but is ineffective in stimulating nucleotide hydrolysis by the hyperactive proteins. Moreover, whereas polymerization of wild-type ParF is accelerated by ATP and inhibited by ADP, filamentation of the mutated proteins is blocked indiscriminately by nucleotides. The mutations affect a triplet of conserved residues that are situated neither in canonical nucleotide binding and hydrolysis motifs in the ParF tertiary structure nor at interfaces implicated in ParF polymerization. Instead the residues are involved in shaping the contours of the binding pocket so that nucleotide binding locks the mutant proteins into a configuration that is refractory to polymerization.

We previously highlighted a triplet of residues that are situated outside of canonical ATP motifs but that are highly conserved among short ParA homologs (∼200 amino acids), including ParF (30.Hayes F.

Microbiol. 2000; 37: 528-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) (see Fig. 1A). Here, we demonstrate that all three amino acids are crucial for maintaining normal ATP hydrolysis kinetics of ParF: remarkably, mutation of any of the residues elicited strong ATPase hyperactivity. Two of the amino acids are key to maintaining the integrity of the nucleotide-binding pocket, whereas the third residue buttresses the position of the Walker A motif. The hyperactive ParF mutants no longer respond to stimulation by the arginine finger-like motif in ParG and display perturbations in both autopolymerization and nucleotide-induced filamentation, leading to marked segregation defects in vivo. We speculate that nucleotide binding fails to transduce the conformational change that elicits dimerization and fixes the mutant proteins into a configuration that is recalcitrant to polymer assembly. The data establish that maintaining the architecture of the ParF nucleotide-binding pocket is critical for optimal ATPase kinetics but also is fundamental to the polymerization dynamics that dictate the DNA segregation process.

Assessment of two-hybrid interactions in vivo was determined by β-galactosidase assays. Polymerization of ParF and its derivatives was monitored by dynamic light scattering and sedimentation assays as outlined previously (15.Barillà D. Rosenberg M.F. Nobbmann U. Hayes F.

Supershifting of ParG-parH complexes by ParF in gel retardation assays was examined as described recently using a biotinylated PCR product (28.Wu M. Zampini M. Bussiek M. Hoischen C. Diekmann S. Hayes F. Segrosome assembly at the pliable parH centromere.Nucleic Acids Res. 2011; 39: 5082-5097Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Biotin end-labeled DNA was detected using chemiluminescent nucleic acid detection reagents (Thermo Scientific Pierce) (27.Barillà D. Hayes F. Architecture of the ParF-ParG protein complex involved in procaryotic DNA segregation.Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 49: 487-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Fluorescence anisotropy measurements were performed in a Jovin-Yvon Horiba Fluoromax-3 spectrofluorimeter in a quartz microcuvette in a total volume of 150 μl. ATP binding activity of wild-type and mutated ParF proteins was assessed by anisotropy measurements of the fluorescent ATP analog MANT-ATP in 20 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, pH 7.0. The excitation wavelength (λex) and emission wavelengths (λem) were 356 and 442 nm, respectively. The MANT-ATP concentration was kept constant (0.9 μm), and the ParF concentration was increased from 0.25 to ∼5 μm. Ten measurements of fluorescence anisotropy were taken for each point, and the average value was plotted against ParF concentration. Fluorescence anisotropy of aromatic residues in ParF was also measured (λex = 280 nm; λem = 340 nm). Because of potential hydrolysis of MANT-ATP by ParF and mutants during measurements, a second set of ligand binding assays were done with the nonhydrolyzable MANT-ATPγS analog using the same conditions as for MANT-ATP. The data were analyzed by direct fitting to a single-site binding model using SigmaPlot. Residues Pro-104, Arg-169, and Gly-179 are highly conserved in ParF and related members of the ParA superfamily but are located distantly in the primary sequence from previously identified ATP binding and hydrolysis motifs (30.Hayes F. The partition system of multidrug resistance plasmid TP228 includes a novel protein that epitomizes an evolutionarily-distinct subgroup of the ParA superfamily.Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 37: 528-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). The residues were changed individually to alanine, which did not appreciably disrupt the gross structure of the purified proteins based on circular dichroism analysis (supplemental Fig. S1). ATPase kinetics of the purified proteins were examined. As demonstrated previously, wild-type ParF is a weak ATPase with a K0.5 value of ≈100 μm (15.Barillà D. Rosenberg M.F. Nobbmann U. Hayes F. Bacterial DNA segregation dynamics mediated by the polymerizing protein ParF.EMBO J. 2005; 24: 1453-1464Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1B). In contrast, the ParF-P104A, -R169A, and -G179A proteins displayed hyperactive ATPase profiles accompanied by modestly elevated K0.5 (≈150 μm). Notably, ParF-P104A hydrolyzed ATP more effectively at high substrate concentrations than either ParF-R169A or ParF-G179A proteins, suggesting a particularly fast catalytic rate for this mutant (Fig. 1C). Accordingly, the kcat values for mutant proteins were 10 to 20 times higher than wild-type ParF (Table 1). Analogously, when titrated with a fixed ATP concentration, the mutated proteins showed comparable profiles, depleting the substrate markedly faster than wild-type protein (Fig. 1B). The hyperactive mutants hereafter are collectively denoted ParFH for clarity.TABLE 1Kinetic properties of wild-type and mutant ParF proteinsParameterParFParF-P104AParF-R169AParF-G179AK0.5∼100 μm∼150 μm∼150 μm∼120 μmkcataMolecules of ADP produced/molecule of protein in 60 min.1.6321514Minutes to hydrolyze one molecule of ATP37.51.87544.285a Molecules of ADP produced/molecule of protein in 60 min. Open table in a new tab ParA ATPases possess three conserved motifs implicated in nucleotide binding and hydrolysis: deviant Walker A (P-loop), Walker A′, and Walker B motifs (37.Motallebi-Veshareh M.

Structures of monomeric ParF bound to ADP recently revealed that the protein adopts an α-β-α layered structure with a central seven-stranded β-sheet surrounded by several α-helices. The adenine nucleotide is situated on the C-terminal side of the parallel β-sheets and is recognized by nucleotide-binding motifs including the Walker A box (29.Schumacher M.A. Ye Q. Barge M.T. Zampini M. Barillà D. Hayes F. Structural mechanism of ATP induced polymerization of the partition factor ParF. Implications for DNA segregation.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 26146-26154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). By contrast with ParF-ADP, ParF forms nucleotide sandwich dimers when bound to AMPPCP. These sandwich dimers pack into higher order, dimer of dimer units to produce a distinctive linear filament that reflects ParF polymer assembly (29.Schumacher M.A. Ye Q. Barge M.T. Zampini M. Barillà D. Hayes F. Structural mechanism of ATP induced polymerization of the partition factor ParF. Implications for DNA segregation.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 26146-26154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Conserved residue Pro-104 is part of a proline-rich patch in ParF. This patch inserts into a niche close to the adenine nucleotide-binding pocket of the adjacent subunit in ParF sandwich dimers (29.Schumacher M.A. Ye Q. Barge M.T. Zampini M. Barillà D. Hayes F. Structural mechanism of ATP induced polymerization of the partition factor ParF. Implications for DNA segregation.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 26146-26154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Considering its location near the Walker A motif in the ParF structure, the P104A change is expected to exert short range impacts on binding pocket conformation (Fig. 2, A–C). Arg-169 forms the “top” of the pocket with the amide nitrogen contacting the adenine N1 group (Fig. 2C). The arginine side chain is wedged between residues Asp-187 and Glu-193, which pins the short turn on which it is located into place. Thus, this side chain is vital in shaping the binding site (Fig. 2D). Although Gly-179 appears to be distant from the nucleotide-binding pocket (Fig. 2, A and B), altering the side chain at this location would clash with residue Trp-47. Trp-47 stacks against amino acids in the binding site and near the P-loop motif; changing the Gly-179 side chain is expected to induce a shift in the position of this motif (Fig. 2E). Thus, Pro-104, Arg-169, and Gly-179 are crucial for maintaining the architecture of the nucleotide-binding site. Changes at these positions are likely to modify nucleotide access and stability in the binding pocket, causing the hyperactivity of ParFH variants. Nucleotide binding dynamics of ParF and ParFH were monitored by anisotropy of the fluorescent ATP analog MANT-ATP titrated with the four proteins (Fig. 3A). At low ParF concentrations, MANT-ATP anisotropy elevated sharply followed by a more gradual increase with an apparent Kd of ∼0.5 μm. By contrast, anisotropy values increased linearly with all three ParFH derivatives. Although saturation could not be reached with mutant proteins, anisotropy changes at the highest testable protein concentrations were ∼50% of wild-type protein (Fig. 3A). In view of their dissimilar ATPase kinetics, differences in MANT-ATP anisotropy may reflect disparate rates of nucleotide binding or hydrolysis by wild-type and mutant proteins. Fluorescence anisotropy studies were performed with the nonhydrolyzable analog MANT-ATPγS to discriminate between these effects (Fig. 3B). Because there essentially is zero hydrolysis within the assay time scale, MANT-ATPγS anisotropy traces represent the true ligand binding curves. Wild-type ParF and ParFH each elicited a fast initial increase in MANT-ATPγS anisotropy. Values with ParF leveled off at concentrations >1 μm, yielding an apparent Kd of ∼0.5 μm, similar to that determined for MANT-ATP. In contrast, anisotropy in the presence of ParFH continued to increase with higher protein concentrations to give final values approximately twice that observed with wild-type ParF (Fig. 3B). The higher anisotropy with mutant proteins compared with wild-type ParF may indicate that the residency time of the fluorophore is longer or that its conformation is altered in the binding pockets of mutant proteins. Despite the higher MANT-ATPγS anisotropy, apparent Kd values for ParFH were >1 μm compared with ∼0.5 μm for wild-type protein. Thus, affinities of ParFH proteins for MANT-ATPγS are moderately reduced compared with wild-type ParF, revealing that the hyperactive ATPase profiles of mutant proteins arise from increased rates of hydrolysis rather than improved nucleotide binding. Partition assays with a low copy number vector were performed to assess the impact of ParFH mutations on DNA segregation. The vector is segregationally unstable in a polA host, showing <5% retention after ∼25 generations of nonselective growth (32.Hayes F. A family of stability determinants in pathogenic bacteria.J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 6415-6418Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Insertion of the parFGH cassette improves plasmid retention levels to ∼70% (30.Hayes F. The partition system of multidrug resistance plasmid TP228 includes a novel protein that epitomizes an evolutionarily-distinct subgroup of the ParA superfamily.Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 37: 528-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4A). Replacement of wild-type parF with the variant producing ParF-P104A reduced plasmid segregational stability markedly. The ParF-R169A protein exerted an even stronger effect, decreasing plasmid retention to the level of the empty vector (Fig. 4A). A plasmid expressing parF-G179A could be propagated without any apparent detrimen"
https://openalex.org/W2161316901,"Genetic factors play an important role in determining the risk of multiple sclerosis (MS). The strongest genetic association in MS is located within the major histocompatibility complex class II region (MHC), but more than 50 MS loci of modest effect located outside the MHC have now been identified. However, the relative candidate genes that underlie these associations and their functions are largely unknown. We conducted a protein-protein interaction (PPI) analysis of gene products coded in loci recently reported to be MS associated at the genome-wide significance level and in loci suggestive of MS association. Our aim was to identify which suggestive regions are more likely to be truly associated, which genes are mostly implicated in the PPI network and their expression profile. From three recent independent association studies, SNPs were considered and divided into significant and suggestive depending on the strength of the statistical association. Using the Disease Association Protein-Protein Link Evaluator tool we found that direct interactions among genetic products were significantly higher than expected by chance when considering both significant regions alone (p<0.0002) and significant plus suggestive (p<0.007). The number of genes involved in the network was 43. Of these, 23 were located within suggestive regions and many of them directly interacted with proteins coded within significant regions. These included genes such as SYK, IL-6, CSF2RB, FCLR3, EIF4EBP2 and CHST12. Using the gene portal BioGPS, we tested the expression of these genes in 24 different tissues and found the highest values among immune-related cells as compared to non-immune tissues (p<0.001). A gene ontology analysis confirmed the immune-related functions of these genes. In conclusion, loci currently suggestive of MS association interact with and have similar expression profiles and function as those significantly associated, highlighting the fact that more common variants remain to be found to be associated to MS."
https://openalex.org/W1994668695,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a worldwide liver disease and nearly 25% of chronic HBV infections terminate in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Currently, there is no effective therapy to inhibit HBV replication and to eliminate hepatoma cells, making it highly desired to develop novel therapies for these two stages of the HBV-caused detrimental disease. Recently, short hairpin RNA (shRNA) has emerged as a potential therapy for virus-infected disease and cancer. Here, we have generated a shRNA, pGenesil-siHBV4, which effectively inhibits HBV replication in the human hepatoma cell line HepG2.2.15. The inhibitory effects of pGenesil-siHBV4 are manifested by the decrease of both the HBV mRNA level and the protein levels of the secreted HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) and HBV e antigen (HBeAg), and by the reduction of secreted HBV DNA. Using mouse hydrodynamic tail vein injection, we demonstrate that pGenesil-siHBV4 is effective in inhibiting HBV replication in vivo. Because survivin plays a key role in cancer cell escape from apoptosis, we further generated pGenesil-siSurvivin, a survivin-silencing shRNA, and showed its effect of triggering apoptosis of HBV-containing hepatoma cells. To develop targeted shRNA therapy, we have identified that as a specific binder of the asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGPR), jetPEI-Hepatocyte delivers pGenesil-siHBV4 and pGenesil-siSurvivin specifically to hepatocytes, not other types of cells. Finally, co-transfection of pGenesil-siHBV4 and pGenesil-siSurvivin exerts synergistic effects in inducing hepatoma cell apoptosis, a novel approach to eliminate hepatoma by downregulating survivin via multiple mechanisms. The application of these novel shRNAs with the jetPEI-Hepatocyte targeting strategy demonstrates the proof-of-principle for a promising approach to inhibit HBV replication and eliminate hepatoma cells with high specificity."
