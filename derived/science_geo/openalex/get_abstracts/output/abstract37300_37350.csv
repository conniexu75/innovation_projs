https://openalex.org/W2148114970,"Mineralocorticoid receptors, both when in tissue extracts and when recombinant-derived, have equal affinity for the physiological mineralocorticoid aldosterone and for the glucocorticoids cortisol and corticosterone, which circulate at much higher concentrations than aldosterone. Such receptors are found in physiological mineralocorticoid target tissues (kidney, parotid, and colon) and in nontarget tissues such as hippocampus and heart. In mineralocorticoid target tissues the receptors are selective for aldosterone in vivo because of the presence of the enzyme 11 beta-hydroxy-steroid dehydrogenase, which converts cortisol and corticosterone, but not aldosterone, to their 11-keto analogs. These analogs cannot bind to mineralocorticoid receptors."
https://openalex.org/W2079606633,"To understand the process of protein folding, it will be necessary to obtain detailed structural information on folding intermediates. This difficult problem is being studied by using hydrogen exchange and rapid mixing to label transient structural intermediates, with subsequent analysis of the proton-labelling pattern by two-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Results for cytochrome c show that the method provides the spatial and temporal resolution necessary to monitor structure formation at many defined sites along the polypeptide chain on a timescale ranging from milliseconds to minutes."
https://openalex.org/W1995484013,"Brief repetitive activation of excitatory synapses in the hippocampus leads to an increase in synaptic strength that lasts for many hours. This long-term potentiation (LTP) of synaptic transmission is the most compelling cellular model in the vertebrate brain for learning and memory. The critical role of postsynaptic calcium in triggering LTP has been directly examined using three types of experiment. First, nitr-5, a photolabile nitrobenzhydrol tetracarboxylate calcium chelator, which releases calcium in response to ultraviolet light, was used. Photolysis of nitr-5 injected into hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells resulted in a large enhancement of synaptic transmission. Second, in agreement with previous results, buffering intracellular calcium at low concentrations blocked LTP. Third, depolarization of the postsynaptic membrane so that calcium entry is suppressed prevented LTP. Taken together, these results demonstrate that an increase in postsynaptic calcium is necessary to induce LTP and sufficient to potentiate synaptic transmission."

https://openalex.org/W2040843640,"The gag-pol protein of Rous sarcoma virus (RSV), the precursor to the enzymes responsible for reverse transcription and integration, is expressed from two genes that lie in different translational reading frames by ribosomal frameshifting. Here, we localize the site of frameshifting and show that the frameshifting reaction is mediated by slippage of two adjacent tRNAs by a single nucleotide in the 5' direction. The gag terminator, which immediately follows the frameshift site, is not required for frameshifting. Other suspected retroviral frameshift sites mediate frameshifting when placed at the end of RSV gag. Mutations in RSV pol also affect synthesis of the gag-pol protein in vitro. The effects of these mutations best correlate with the potential to form an RNA stem-loop structure adjacent to the frameshift site. A short sequence of RSV RNA, 147 nucleotides in length, containing the frameshift site and stem-loop structure, is sufficient to direct frameshifting in a novel genetic context."

https://openalex.org/W2024449200,"In vitro autoradiography with 125I-labeled melatonin was used to examine melatonin binding sites in human hypothalamus. Specific 125I-labeled melatonin binding was localized to the suprachiasmatic nuclei, the site of a putative biological clock, and was not apparent in other hypothalamic regions. Specific 125I-labeled melatonin binding was consistently found in the suprachiasmatic nuclei of hypothalami from adults and fetuses. Densitometric analysis of competition experiments with varying concentrations of melatonin showed monophasic competition curves, with comparable half-maximal inhibition values for the suprachiasmatic nuclei of adults (150 picomolar) and fetuses (110 picomolar). Micromolar concentrations of the melatonin agonist 6-chloromelatonin completely inhibited specific 125I-labeled melatonin binding, whereas the same concentrations of serotonin and norepinephrine caused only a partial reduction in specific binding. The results suggest that putative melatonin receptors are located in a human biological clock."
https://openalex.org/W2084278918,"We have identified a cis-acting element of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) that mediates viral DNA replication during the lytic phase of this virus's life cycle. This lytic origin of DNA replication, termed oriLyt, is complex in structure in that it contains multiple regions that are required for replication and additional DNA sequences that increase replication. One of the required regions of oriLyt can be functionally substituted by a transcriptional enhancing element. DNA replication mediated by oriLyt depends on EBV DNA polymerase and yields a concatemeric molecule. A vector, which contains both oriP (the EBV plasmid origin of replication) and oriLyt, can be maintained as a plasmid in latently EBV-infected cells and can be amplified 100- to 1000-fold in cells in which the lytic phase of the viral life cycle is induced."
https://openalex.org/W1524561975,"Numerous plasma membrane-bound receptors are coupled to various effectors via a family of guanine nucleotide regulatory proteins (G proteins). Amino acid sequences of these receptors, deduced from cDNA and genomic clones, indicate the presence of seven transmembrane-spanning domains. Alignment of the available amino acid sequences of these G protein-linked receptors reveals striking homologies in regions predicted to lie near the cytoplasmic surface of the cell membrane. As these areas are likely those which interact with G proteins, we reasoned that systematic introduction of non-native sequence into these highly conserved regions of the human beta 2-adrenergic receptor would allow resolution of loci participating directly in receptor-G protein coupling. Based on this strategy, we constructed 19 mutant receptor species comprising substitutions and deletions of native sequence in the putative cytoplasmic domains of human beta 2-adrenergic receptor. By monitoring ligand binding characteristics and receptor-mediated stimulation of adenylyl cyclase, we have determined that the C-terminal portion of the third cytoplasmic loop and the N-terminal segment of the cytoplasmic tail appear to be critical for productive receptor-coupling to G proteins. In addition, we have implicated two other areas of the receptor that possibly play supportive roles in maintaining proper orientation of the G protein binding site. These comprise the second cytoplasmic loop and a conserved cysteine residue in the cytoplasmic tail."
https://openalex.org/W2039841202,"The enzymes adenosine 3′,5′-monophosphate (cAMP)-dependent protein kinase (protein kinase A) and protein kinase C regulate the activity of a diverse group of cellular proteins including membrane ion channel proteins. When protein kinase A was stimulated in cardiac ventricular myocytes with the membrane-soluble cAMP analog 8-chlorphenylthio cAMP (8-CPT cAMP), the amplitude of the delayed-rectifier potassium current (IK) doubled when recorded at 32°C but was not affected at 22°C. In contrast, modulation of the calcium current (ICa) by 8-CPT cAMP was independent of temperature with similar increases in ICa occurring at both temperatures. Stimulation of protein kinase C by phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate also enhanced IK in a temperature-dependent manner but failed to increase ICa at either temperature. Thus, cardiac delayed-rectifier potassium but not calcium channels are regulated by two distinct protein kinases in a similar temperature-dependent fashion."
https://openalex.org/W2080304004,"The soluble and membrane components of an E. coli in vitro protein translocation system prepared from a secA amber mutant, secA13[Am], contain reduced levels of SecA and are markedly defective in both the cotranslational and posttranslational translocation of OmpA and alkaline phosphatase into membrane vesicles. Moreover, the removal of SecA from soluble components prepared from wild-type strain by passage through an anti-SecA antibody column similarly abolishes protein translocation. Translocation activity is completely restored by addition of submicrogram amounts of purified SecA protein, implying that the observed defects are solely related to loss of SecA function. Interestingly, the translocation defect can be overcome by reconstitution of SecA into SecA-depleted membranes, suggesting that SecA is an essential, membrane-associated translocation factor."

https://openalex.org/W2066394264,"The alpha and beta subunits of the gamma-aminobutyric acidA (GABAA) receptor were expressed individually in Xenopus oocytes by injection of RNA synthesized from their cloned DNAs. GABA-sensitive chloride channels were detected several days after injection with any one of three different alpha RNAs (alpha 1, alpha 2, and alpha 3) or with beta RNA. The channels induced by each of the alpha-subunit RNAs were indistinguishable, they had multiple conductance levels (10, 19, 28, and 42 picosiemens), and their activity was potentiated by pentobarbital and inhibited by picrotoxin. The beta channels usually expressed poorly but showed similar single channel conductance levels (10, 18, 27, and 40 picosiemens), potentiation by pentobarbital and inhibition by picrotoxin. The finding that both alpha and beta subunits, examined separately, form GABA-sensitive ion channels with permeation properties and regulatory sites characteristic of the native receptor suggests that the amino acid sequences that confer these properties are within the homologous domains shared by the subunits."
https://openalex.org/W2089524040,"We describe here a bizarre organization of the single large subunit (LSU) and small subunit (SSU) rRNA genes in the mitochondrial DNA of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. Each gene is discontinuous, with gene pieces encoding specific rRNA domains (""modules"") interspersed with one another and with intact protein coding and tRNA genes throughout a 6 kbp region. Transcript mapping experiments reveal the presence of abundant small rRNAs whose sizes approximate the sizes of the modules encoding them. Evidently, rRNA splicing does not occur in this system; instead, secondary structure modeling supports the view that the SSU and LSU rRNAs each functions as a noncovalent network of small RNAs, rather than as a single covalently continuous molecule. We propose that such a modular pattern may reflect the structure of the primordial ribosome."
https://openalex.org/W1969979186,"Homopurine-homopyrimidine sequences that flank certain actively transcribed genes are hypersensitive to single strand-specific nucleases such as S1. This has raised the possibility that an unusual structure exists in these regions that might be involved in recognition or regulation. Several of these sequences, including d(C-T)n.d(A-G)n, are known to undergo a transition in plasmids to an underwound state that is hypersensitive to single strand-specific nucleases; this transition occurs under conditions of moderately acid pH and negative supercoiling. Chemical probes were used to examine the reactivity of a restriction fragment from a human U1 gene containing the sequence d(C-T)18.d(A-G)18 as a function of supercoiling and pH, and thus analyze the structure in this region. Hyperreactivity was seen in the center and at one end of the (C-T)n tract, and continuously from the center to the same end of the (A-G)n tract, in the presence of supercoiling and pH less than or equal to 6.0. These results provide strong support for a triple-helical model recently proposed for these sequences and are inconsistent with other proposed structures."
https://openalex.org/W2161162677,"A 5' untranslated exon of the human CSF-1 receptor gene (c-fms) is separated by a 26 kb intron from the 32 kb receptor coding sequences. Nucleotide sequence analysis of cloned genomic DNA revealed that the 3' end of the PDGF receptor gene is located less than 0.5 kb upstream from this exon. Similarities in chromosomal localization, organization, and encoded amino acid sequences suggest that the genes encoding the CSF-1 and PDGF receptors arose through duplication. The as yet unidentified c-fms promoter/enhancer sequences may be confined to the nucleotides separating the two genes or could potentially lie within the PDGF receptor gene itself."
https://openalex.org/W1548377812,"The effects of 17-hydroxywortmannin (HWT), a powerful inhibitor of the respiratory burst associated with phagocytosis (Baggiolini, M., Dewald, B., Schnyder, J., Ruch, W., Cooper, P. H., and Payne, T. G. (1987) Exp. Cell Res. 169, 408-418), were studied in human neutrophils stimulated with chemotactic agonists or phorbol myristate acetate. At nanomolar concentrations HWT inhibited superoxide production and the release of granule contents induced by N-formyl-Met-Leu-Phe, C5a, platelet-activating factor, and leukotriene B4, but not by phorbol myristate acetate, indicating that it interferes with receptor-mediated activation of the neutrophils, without directly affecting protein kinase C (Ca2+/phospholipid-dependent enzyme), the NADPH-oxidase, or the process of granule exocytosis. Moreover, HWT did not influence agonist-induced [Ca2+]i changes, indicating that it does not interfere with the function of agonist receptors, G-proteins or the phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C. By studying the effect of HWT on the respiratory burst elicited in normal and Ca2+-depleted cells by combined stimulation with N-formyl-Met-Leu-Phe and phorbol myristate acetate, evidence was obtained that two transduction sequences, both of which are G-protein-dependent, are necessary for the induction of the response by receptor agonists. One sequence is Ca2+-dependent, HWT-insensitive, and leads to activation of protein kinase C, the other is Ca2+-independent and HWT-sensitive. Ca2+ depletion, which blocks the first, and HWT, which blocks the second, can be used to show that both processes must be functional for the transduction of agonist signals into a respiratory burst response."
https://openalex.org/W1565338381,"cDNA clones for three distinct types of rat brain calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II have been isolated. Two of them were identified as cDNA clones for the alpha and beta subunits of this kinase. The other showed a nucleotide sequence similar but, not identical, to that encoding either the alpha or beta subunit. The cDNA sequence encoded a polypeptide, designated gamma, consisting of 527 amino acid residues with a molecular weight of 59,038. The deduced amino acid sequence of gamma was 84 and 87% homologous to those of alpha and beta, respectively. Higher homologies of the sequences were found in the amino-terminal halves of the three species, alpha, beta, and gamma. RNA blot analysis revealed that the mRNAs for alpha, beta, and gamma were expressed in rat brain with different regional specificities."
https://openalex.org/W1583781439,"Fodrin (brain spectrin) binds calmodulin and is susceptible to proteolysis by calcium-dependent protease I (CDP-I, calcium-activated neutral protease I, or calpain I). Both events involve the central region of the alpha-fodrin subunit, and calmodulin binding enhances the sensitivity of fodrin to CDP-I mediated proteolysis. Fragments of fodrin, generated chemically or proteolytically, which retain calmodulin binding activity have been identified and analyzed by two-dimensional peptide mapping and by direct protein sequencing. Both CDP-I and calmodulin interact with the terminal portion of the eleventh repetitive unit in fodrin, which is at the center of the molecule. CDP-I cleavage occurs between Tyr104 and Gly105 and preserves the calmodulin binding activity of the carboxyl-terminal fragment. In contrast, chymotryptic cleavage at Trp120 reduces the ability of this fragment to bind calmodulin, and tryptic cleavage beyond Trp120 completely eliminates calmodulin binding activity. It is concluded that Ser-Lys-Thr-Ala-Ser-Pro-Trp-Lys-Ser-Ala-Arg-Leu-Met-Val-His-Thr-Val-Ala- Thr- Phe-Asn-Ser-Ile-Lys, a 24-residue peptide which bridges repeats 11 and 12 of brain alpha spectrin contains the high affinity calmodulin binding domain."
https://openalex.org/W1986167535,Behavioral studies have suggested that muscarinic cholinergic systems have an important role in learning and memory. A muscarinic cholinergic agonist is now shown to affect synaptic plasticity in the CA3 region of the hippocampal slice. Long-term potentiation (LTP) of the mossy fiber-CA3 synapse was blocked by muscarine. Low concentrations of muscarine (1 micromolar) had little effect on low-frequency (0.2 hertz) synaptic stimulation but did significantly reduce the magnitude and probability of induction of LTP. Experiments under voltage clamp showed that muscarine blocked the increase in excitatory synaptic conductance normally associated with LTP at this synapse. These results suggest a possible role for cholinergic systems in synaptic plasticity.
https://openalex.org/W1575138663,"The putative structural gene encoding the vaccinia virus type I DNA topoisomerase (EC 5.99.1.2) was expressed in Escherichia coli under the control of a bacteriophage T7 promoter. Provision of T7 RNA polymerase resulted in the accumulation to high level of a Mr = 33,000 type I topoisomerase with the properties of the vaccinia enzyme. A simple purification scheme yielded approximately 8 mg of recombinant vaccinia topoisomerase from 400 ml of bacteria. DNA unwinding by the enzyme was stimulated by magnesium, manganese, calcium, cobalt, and spermidine, but inhibited by copper and zinc. Like eukaryotic cellular type I topoisomerases, but unlike the prokaryotic counterpart, the recombinant topoisomerase relaxed positively and negatively supercoiled DNA. The viral topoisomerase I was, however, resistant to the effects of camptothecin, a drug that specifically inhibits cellular type I topoisomerases."
https://openalex.org/W1519441411,"A family of homologous actin-binding proteins sever and cap actin filaments and accelerate actin filament assembly. The functions of two of these proteins, villin and gelsolin, and of their proteolytically derived actin binding domains were compared directly by measuring their effects, under various ionic conditions, on the rates and extents of polymerization of pyrene-labeled actin. In 1 mM Ca2+ and 150 mM KCl, villin and gelsolin have similar severing and polymerization-accelerating properties. Decreasing [Ca2+] to 25 microM greatly reduces severing by villin but not gelsolin. Decreasing [KCl] from 150 to 10 mM at 25 microM Ca2+ increases severing by villin, but not gelsolin, over 10-fold. The C-terminal half domains of both proteins have Ca2+-sensitive actin monomer-binding properties, but neither severs filaments nor accelerates polymerization. The N-terminal halves of villin and gelsolin contain all the filament-severing activity of the intact proteins. Severing by gelsolin's N-terminal half is Ca2+-independent, but that of villin has the same Ca2+ requirement as intact villin. The difference in Ca2+ sensitivity extends to 14-kDa N-terminal fragments which bind actin monomers and filament ends, requiring Ca2+ in the case of villin but not gelsolin. Severing of filaments by villin and its N-terminal half is shown to be inhibited by phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate, as shown previously for gelsolin (Janmey, P.A., and Stossel, T.P. (1987) Nature 325, 362-364). The functional similarities of villin and gelsolin correlate with known structural features, and the greater functional dependence of villin on Ca2+ compared to gelsolin is traced to differences in their N-terminal domains."
https://openalex.org/W1485534750,"The regulation of the cytosolic calcium concentration was investigated in freshly isolated adult bovine tracheal smooth muscle cells using fura 2. These cells contain 1.1 and 1.8 pmol of cGMP kinase and cAMP kinase per mg protein, respectively. Carbachol, histamine, serotonin, isoproterenol, and salbutamol increased the cytosolic calcium in a dose-dependent manner from 79 nM to about 650 nM. Preincubation of these cells for 20 min with isoproterenol, forskolin, 8-Br-cAMP and 8-(4-Cl-phenyl)thio-cAMP did not lower carbachol-induced increases in cytosolic calcium concentration, whereas the phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate, the atrionatriuretic factor, isobutylmethylxanthine, and 8-Br-cGMP lowered cytosolic calcium. The active fragment of cGMP kinase, but not the catalytic subunit of cAMP kinase lowered carbachol-induced calcium levels. Carbachol released calcium from intracellular stores and increased calcium influx from the extracellular space. The influx was inhibited by preincubation with the calcium channel blockers nitrendipine or gallopamil. Both carbachol-stimulated pathways were suppressed by 8-Br-cGMP. Isoproterenol increased only the influx of calcium from the outside by a channel which was blocked by calcium channel blockers or 8-Br-cGMP. Forskolin and 8-Br-cAMP lowered carbachol- and isoproterenol-stimulated increases in calcium when added shortly before or after the addition of the agonist. In addition, isoproterenol decreased carbachol-stimulated calcium levels when added 10 s after carbachol. The calcium stimulatory effect of isoproterenol was abolished by preincubation of the cells with pertussis toxin or cholera toxin. These results show (a) that the beta 2-adrenoceptor couples in isolated tracheal smooth muscle cells to a dihydropyridine- and pertussis toxin-sensitive calcium channel; (b) that the same channel is opened by carbachol; (c) that cGMP kinase is very effective in decreasing elevated cytosolic calcium concentrations, whereas cAMP-dependent protein kinase has a variable effect on stimulated cytosolic calcium levels."
https://openalex.org/W2006156736,"The terminus region of the E. coli chromosome contains two loci, T1 and T2, that inhibit the progress of replication forks and require the trans-acting factor tus. We have identified a 23 bp terminator signal at T1 and T2 that is within 100 bp of the sites of replication arrest. When an oligodeoxyribonucleotide containing the terminator signal was inserted into a plasmid, replication was halted only in a tus+ strain and when the terminator signal was oriented properly. We also found this terminator sequence in the terminus region of the plasmid R6K and in the origin region of RepFIIA class plasmids. In addition, we found striking similarities between the E. coli terminator signal and the terminator sequence of B. subtilis."
https://openalex.org/W1540686772,"The relA gene product of Escherichia coli is known to be responsible for the synthesis of guanosine 3',5'-bispyrophosphate (ppGpp) during the stringent response to amino acid starvation. This report presents the sequence of the relA gene region and assignment of its 743-codon open reading frame by the following criteria: 1) genetic complementation of ppGpp synthesis in a relaxed (relA1) mutant during the stringent response; 2) changes in 3-aminotriazole resistance during growth to mimic a relA+ phenotype; 3) verification of the presence of an amber codon at the normal carboxyl terminus of the relA gene; and 4) immunological assays of expression of the RelA protein. The apparent molecular mass of the cloned relA gene product is calculated to be 83,856 daltons and as visualized by immunoblotting is identical to that of the previously characterized protein. A promoter has been identified that directs relA gene transcription towards the pyrG gene, in a counterclockwise direction on the E. coli chromosome. Genomic Southern blot analyses verify that the relA regions cloned and subjected to nucleotide sequence analysis correspond to homologous regions on the E. coli chromosome."
https://openalex.org/W1985041204,"The T cell antigen receptor consists of an antigen-binding heterodimer that is noncovalently associated with at least five CD3 subunits (gamma, delta, epsilon, zeta, and eta). The CD3-zeta chains are either disulfide-linked homodimers (CD3-zeta 2) or disulfide-linked heterodimers with eta (CD3-zeta eta). Variants of a murine antigen-specific T cell hybridoma that express normal amounts of CD3-zeta 2 but decreased amounts of CD3-zeta eta were isolated. When activated, the parental cell line increased both phosphatidylinositol hydrolysis and serine-specific protein kinase activity to a much greater extent than the variants. In contrast, the activation of a tyrosine-specific kinase after stimulation with a cross-linking antibody to CD3 was similar among these cells. There was a positive linear relation between the expression of CD3-zeta eta and phosphoinositide hydrolysis stimulated by the TCR, suggesting a differential coupling of the T cell alpha beta heterodimer to signal transduction mechanisms due to alpha beta association with either CD3-zeta 2 or CD3-zeta eta."
https://openalex.org/W1597596819,"Cytochrome c is synthesized in the cytoplasm as apocytochrome c, lacking heme, and then imported into mitochondria. The relationship between attachment of heme to the apoprotein and its import into mitochondria was examined using an in vitro system. Apocytochrome c transcribed and translated in vitro could be imported with high efficiency into mitochondria isolated from normal yeast strains. However, no import of apocytochrome c occurred with mitochondria isolated from cyc3- strains, which lack cytochrome c heme lyase, the enzyme catalyzing covalent attachment of heme to apocytochrome c. In addition, amino acid substitutions in apocytochrome c at either of the 2 cysteine residues that are the sites of the thioether linkages to heme, or at an immediately adjacent histidine that serves as a ligand of the heme iron, resulted in a substantial reduction in the ability of the precursor to be translocated into mitochondria. Replacement of the methionine serving as the other iron ligand, on the other hand, had no detectable effect on import of apocytochrome c in this system. Thus, covalent heme attachment is a required step for import of cytochrome c into mitochondria. Heme attachment, however, can occur in the absence of mitochondrial import since we have detected CYC3-encoded heme lyase activity in solubilized yeast extracts and in an Escherichia coli expression system. These results suggest that protein folding triggered by heme attachment to apocytochrome c is required for import into mitochondria."
https://openalex.org/W1967615311,"Mutations in the Caenorhabditis elegans dpy-13 (dumpy) gene result in a short, chunky body shape. This gene was tagged by insertion of the Tc1 transposon, and the wild-type gene was cloned by chromosomal walking 11 kb from ama-1, a cloned gene encoding the large subunit of RNA polymerase II. Three transposon insertion sites in dpy-13 are located near the 5' end of a 1.2 kb transcribed region. The EMS-induced reference allele, dpy-13(e184), carries a small deletion near the middle of this gene. The DNA sequence reveals that dpy-13 is a member of the collagen multi-gene family, and it could encode a polypeptide of 302 amino acids. A 146 base pair sequence, encoding amino acids 56-103, is unique in the C. elegans genome, and it hybridizes to a 1 kb mRNA of moderate abundance."
https://openalex.org/W1555694303,"To identify factors potentially influencing expression of type 1 plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI-1), we characterized the human tissue-specific distribution of PAI-1 mRNA and the influence of epidermal growth factor (EGF) on expression of steady state levels of PAI-1 mRNA and secretion of PAI-1 by Hep G2 cells. Two species of PAI-1 mRNA (3.2 and 2.2 kilobases) were detected, and the ratio of the two varied among tissues (3 to 5:1) in contrast to the 1:1 ratio detected in Hep G2 cells. Expression of PAI-1 mRNA was inversely related to the distribution of tissue-type plasminogen activator mRNA (2.3 kilobases). Nu-Serum, a growth media supplement, increased steady state levels of PAI-1 mRNA 5-fold within 3 h. Factors responsible were found to be trypsin-sensitive and dialysis-resistant. Antisera to EGF attenuated Nu-Serum-induced increases of PAI-1 mRNA by 57%, suggesting that EGF or EGF homologous peptides contributed to the response. EGF elicited increases of PAI-1 mRNA levels in a dose-dependent manner. Induction was rapid (7-fold at 3 h with 5 ng/ml) and complete within 10 h. The response was not attenuated by cycloheximide (25 micrograms/ml). Factor X and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA did not increase. Increased levels of PAI-1 antigen were detected in conditioned media of Hep G2 cells by 4 h and were maximal at 8 h (6-fold). We conclude that the expression of PAI-1 mRNA is tissue-specific and regulated by epidermal growth factor in Hep G2 cells."
https://openalex.org/W1643850231,Escherichia coli DNA topoisomerase I catalyzes interconversions of different DNA topological isomers by the breakage and rejoining of DNA phosphodiester bonds. It has a crucial role in maintaining an optimal DNA superhelicity in E. coli. It is a single polypeptide of 864 amino acids. Analysis of the amino acid sequence reveals three tandem repeat units each containing two pairs of cysteines suggesting that each unit may form a zinc-binding domain. We have determined that each enzyme molecule contains three to four zinc atoms using inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission analysis. Modification of the cysteine residues and removal of the zinc from the enzyme result in loss of activity. Zinc ions are needed for full recovery of enzyme activity when the cysteine modification is reversed. Comparison with the zinc-binding domains of the sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins shows significant differences.
https://openalex.org/W1551210345,"A Chinese hamster ovary cell line that stably expresses transfected human platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) A and B chain precursors was established. All three dimeric combinations of PDGF chains were produced by this cell line; their biosynthesis, assembly, and processing were followed by pulse-chase analyses. PDGF-AA, PDGF-AB, and PDGF-BB were processed to Mr values of about 30,000 and were accumulated in these forms in the medium. In addition, PDGF-BB was further processed to a 24-kDa component, which remained cell-associated. The major secreted component was PDGF-AB, which was purified and shown to have structural and functional characteristics indistinguishable from PDGF-AB purified from human platelets."
https://openalex.org/W1540834830,"Resistance to lincomycin by inactivation has been detected in numerous clinical isolates of Staphylococcus; in crude extracts of Staphylococcus haemolyticus BM4610 and Staphylococcus aureus BM4611, inactivation of lincomycin and clindamycin requires the presence of a nucleoside 5′-triphosphate (ATP, GTP, CTP, or UTP) as nucleotidyl donor and Mg2+ as cofactor. The biochemical mechanism of lincosaminide inactivation was elucidated by determination of the structure of inactivated lincomycin and clindamycin by physicochemical techniques, including UV absorption spectrophotometry, 31P and 1H nuclear magnetic resonance, and periodate oxidation. In the two strains, inactivation of lincomycin gave rise to lincomycin 3-(5′-adenylate), whereas clindamycin was inactivated through its conversion to clindamycin 4-(5′-adenylate). The gene linA' encoding the 3-lincomycin, 4-clindamycin O-nucleotidyltransferase in S. aureus BM4611 has been sequenced and displays 93% homology with the gene linA encoding the 3-lincomycin, 4-clindamycin O-nucleotidyltransferase found in S. haemolyticus BM4610. The two enzymes are 161 amino acids long and differ by 14 amino acid substitutions."
https://openalex.org/W1599292918,"Thrombomodulin is an endothelial membrane anticoagulant protein that is a cofactor for protein C activation. We have evaluated the expression of thrombomodulin in cultured mouse hemangioma cells before and after treatment with phorbol myristate acetate (PMA), an agent that stimulates protein kinase C. We also isolated a cDNA encoding 481 amino acids of mouse thrombomodulin and the entire 3'-untranslated portion of its mRNA. The deduced amino acid sequence of mouse thrombomodulin is similar to those determined for human and bovine thrombomodulin. An S1 nuclease protection assay was used to measure thrombomodulin mRNA in hemangioma cells. The half-life for thrombomodulin mRNA was 8.9 +/- 1.8 h (S.D.) in cells treated with actinomycin D. Treatment with PMA had no effect on thrombomodulin mRNA levels. Thrombomodulin turnover was evaluated by immunoprecipitation of [35S]methionine-labeled thrombomodulin. The t1/2 was 19.8 +/- 3.9 h (S.D.); PMA treatment decreased the t1/2 to 10.9 +/- 1.1 h (S.D.) while increasing the rate of synthesis to a maximum of 190% of control. Protein C cofactor activity on hemangioma cells was reduced 35 +/- 4% by treatment with PMA within 30 min. This decrease was associated with a parallel decline in cell surface thrombomodulin antigen and with enhanced phosphorylation of thrombomodulin on serine residues. We conclude that thrombomodulin is phosphorylated in response to treatment of hemangioma cells with PMA which leads to decreased protein C cofactor activity and both increased degradation and synthesis of thrombomodulin."
https://openalex.org/W1604272784,"The role of protons as substitutes for Na+ and/or K+ in the sodium pump reaction was examined using inside-out membrane vesicles derived from human red cells. Na+-like effects of protons suggested previously (Blostein, R. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 829-833) were substantiated by the following observations: (i) in the absence of extravesicular (cytoplasmic) Na+, an increase in cytoplasmic [H+] increased both strophanthidin-sensitive ATP hydrolysis (nu) and the steady-state level of phosphoenzyme, EP, and (ii) as [H+] is increased, the Na+/ATP coupling ratio is decreased. K+-like effects of protons were evidenced in the following results: (i) an increase in nu, decrease in EP, and hence increase in EP turnover (nu/EP) occur when intravesicular (extracellular) [H+] is increased; (ii) an increase in the rate of Na+ influx into K+(Rb+)-free inside-out vesicles and (iii) a decrease in Rb+/ATP coupling occur when [H+] is increased. Direct evidence for H+ being translocated in place of cytoplasmic Na+ and extracellular K+ was obtained by monitoring pH changes using fluorescein isothiocyanate-dextran-filled vesicles derived from 4',4-diisothiocyano-2',2-stilbene disulfonate-treated cells. With the initial pHi = pHo = pH 6.2, a strophanthidin-sensitive decrease in pHi was observed following addition of ATP provided the vesicles contained K+. This pH gradient was abolished following addition of Na+. With alkali cation-free inside-out vesicles, a strophanthidin-sensitive increase in pH was observed upon addition of both ATP and Na+. The foregoing changes in pHi were not affected by the addition of tetrabutylammonium to dissipate any membrane potential and were not observed at pH 6.8. These ATP-dependent cardiac glycoside-sensitive proton movements indicate Na,K-ATPase mediated Na+/H+ exchange in the absence of extracellular K+ as well as H+/K+ exchange in the absence of cytoplasmic Na+."
https://openalex.org/W1593616223,"We have established a Saccharomyces cerevisiae genetic system that expresses the fusion protein ubiquitin-metallothionein. We have evaluated the effects of amino-terminal ubiquitination of metallothionein on the stability and function of metallothionein. The fusion protein of wild type ubiquitin and metallothionein was rapidly processed in vivo to release free ubiquitin and metallothionein. Site-directed mutants of ubiquitin-metallothionein expressed in yeast were used to study the specificity of the (alpha-NH2-ubiquitin) protein endopeptidases. The data suggest that amino-terminal ubiquitination is not a signal for the proteolysis of yeast metallothionein in yeast. We have also discovered that expression of selected ubiquitin mutants blocked the growth of yeast. The data suggest that in addition to its function as a proteolytic signal, ubiquitination of proteins plays multiple roles in the cell."
https://openalex.org/W1511779607,"Abstract A single polypeptide acts as the beta subunit of prolyl 4-hydroxylase and the enzyme protein disulfide isomerase and may also function as a cellular thyroid hormone binding protein. We report here that the human gene for this polypeptide is about 18 kilobase pairs and consists of 11 exons. The two thioredoxin-like regions are coded by exons 1-2 and 8-9, respectively. The codons for the two presumed active sites of protein disulfide isomerase, each a Cys-Gly-His-Cys sequence, are located 12 base pairs from the beginning of exons 2 and 9. The last 3 amino acids coded by exons 1 and 8 and the first 9 amino acids coded by exons 2 and 9, including a broken codon for Tyr, are identical in the respective exon-intron junctions. These regions are also highly homologous to the active sites of bacterial thioredoxins. The data suggest that evolution of this gene has involved exon shuffling and duplication of a two-exon unit, in which the internal exon-intron junctions have been entirely conserved. The region between exons 1-2 and 8-9 appears to contain other duplications. The 5' flanking sequences contain a TATA box, six CCAAT boxes, and other elements which may be involved in regulation of the cellular amounts of this polypeptide."
https://openalex.org/W1505597451,"The role of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent processes in the activation of the Na+/H+ antiport of primary cultures of rat aortic smooth muscle was studied using 22Na+ uptake and measurement of intracellular pH (pHi) with the fluorescent pH dye 2',7'-bis-(2-carboxyethyl)-5(and 6)-carboxyfluorescein. Antiport activation following exposure to serum and by the induction of an intracellular acidosis could be markedly attenuated by calmodulin antagonists. Ionomycin also transiently elevated pHi and 5-(N-ethyl-N-isopropyl) amiloride-sensitive 22Na+ influx, effects consistent with activation of the antiport; these effects were abolished in cells exposed to calmodulin antagonists or [ethylenebis(oxyethylenenitrilo)]tetraacetic acid. Activation of the antiport following intracellular acidosis was markedly affected by cellular ATP depletion. A comparison of the abilities of control and 2-deoxy-D-glucose-treated cells to increase 5-(N-ethyl-N-isopropyl)amiloride-sensitive 22Na+ influx in response to graded acidifications indicated that attenuation of Na+/H+ antiport activity was due to both a shift of its pHi dependence and to a reduction in maximal activity. The results suggest that the Na+/H+ antiport of rat aortic smooth muscle is dependent on Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent processes, presumably phosphorylation, which influences its activity by modulating (i) an intracellular proton dependent regulatory mechanism (allosteric site) and (ii) the maximum activity of the antiport."
https://openalex.org/W1535713735,"Collagenase is synthesized and secreted by stimulated rabbit fibroblasts as a proenzyme that must be proteolytically cleaved to yield catalytically active species. The calcium ionophore A23187 has provided new insights into the regulation of collagenase activation cascade by living cells. A23187, at concentrations of 10-40 ng/ml, induced expression of collagenase and stromelysin mRNA and the secretion of procollagenase of 57 and 53 kDa and prostromelysin of 51 kDa. Interestingly, it also stimulated activation of procollagenase to active forms of 47 and 43 kDa. The concentrations and treatment times required for induction of gene expression and activation indicated that they were independent events. Active collagenase constituted up to 16% of the total collagenase present in medium conditioned by A23187-treated cells. When grown on a collagen substrate, A23187-treated cells degraded collagen in a spatially localized manner. In cells treated with agents that induce procollagenase only, collagenase was localized in the perinuclear Golgi area; however, in A23187-treated cells, collagenase was located in widely dispersed granules, suggesting different intracellular pathways for collagenase before, during, and after activation. Addition of serine, thiol-, and metalloproteinase inhibitors with A23187 to rabbit fibroblasts inhibited conversion of procollagenase to its active form to varying degrees, suggesting that enzymes in these classes are involved in a cascade of proteolytic events leading to collagenase activation."
https://openalex.org/W2007418564,"Inherited myoclonus of Poll Hereford calves is characterized by hyperesthesia and myoclonic jerks of the skeletal musculature, which occur spontaneously and in response to sensory stimuli. The disease shows autosomal recessive inheritance, and significant proportions of the Poll Hereford herds in many countries are thought to be carriers of the mutant gene. Studies revealed a specific and marked (90 to 95 percent) deficit in [3H]strychnine binding sites in spinal cord membranes from myoclonic animals compared to controls, reflecting a loss of, or defect in, glycine/strychnine receptors. Spinal cord synaptosomes prepared from affected animals showed a significantly increased ability to accumulate [3H]glycine, indicating an increased capacity of the high-affinity neuronal uptake system for glycine. In contrast, stimulus-induced glycine release and spinal cord glycine concentrations were unaltered."
https://openalex.org/W1581080116,"The Tsr protein of Escherichia coli is a chemosensory transducer that mediates taxis toward serine and away from certain repellents. Like other bacterial transducers, Tsr spans the cytoplasmic membrane twice, forming a periplasmic domain of about 150 amino acids and a cytoplasmic domain of about 300 amino acids. The 32 N-terminal amino acids of Tsr resemble the consensus signal sequence of secreted proteins, but they are not removed from the mature protein. To investigate the function of this N-terminal sequence in the assembly process, we isolated translational fusions between tsr and the phoA and lacZ genes, which code for the periplasmic enzyme alkaline phosphatase and the cytoplasmic enzyme beta-galactosidase, respectively. All tsr-phoA fusions isolated code for proteins whose fusion joints are within the periplasmic loop of Tsr, and all of these hybrid proteins have high alkaline phosphatase activity. The most N-terminal fusion joint is at amino acid 19 of Tsr. Tsr-lacZ fusions were found throughout the tsr gene. The beta-galactosidase activity of the LacZ-fusion proteins varies greatly, depending on the location of the fusion joint. Fusions with low activity have fusion joints within the periplasmic loop of Tsr. The expression of these fusions is most likely reduced at the level of translation. In addition, one of these fusions markedly reduces the export and processing of the periplasmic maltose-binding protein and the outer membrane protein OmpA, but not of intact PhoA or of the outer membrane protein LamB. A temperature-sensitive secA mutation, causing defective protein secretion, stops expression of new alkaline phosphatase activity coded by a tsr-phoA fusion upon shifting to the nonpermissive temperature. The same secA mutation, even at the permissive temperature, increases the activity and the level of expression of LacZ fused to the periplasmic loop of Tsr relative to a secA+ strain. We conclude that the assembly of Tsr into the cytoplasmic membrane is mediated by the machinery responsible for the secretion of a subset of periplasmic and outer membrane proteins. Moreover, assembly of the Tsr protein seems to be closely coupled to its synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1614268180,"The GlcNAc-1-P-transferase that initiates the dolichol cycle for the biosynthesis of asparagine-linked glycoproteins has been purified from the lactating bovine mammary gland. After solubilization from microsomes with 0.25% Nonidet P-40, the enzyme activity was stabilized with 20% glycerol, 20 micrograms/ml phosphatidylglycerol, 5 microM dolichol phosphate, and 2.5 microM UDP-GlcNAc. The purification protocol involved (NH4)2SO4 precipitation, gel filtration on Sephacryl S-300, DEAE-TSK, and hydroxylapatite chromatography. The purified enzyme was devoid of several readily detectable glycosyltransferases of the dolichol cycle. It showed two bands (A, 50 kDa and B, 46 kDa) on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis after either Coomassie Blue or silver staining. Antisera (anti-A and anti-B) raised against individual bands A and B inhibited the enzyme activity in solubilized microsomes. Each of the partially purified antibodies recognizes both bands A and B on Western blots of the enzyme; with the solubilized microsomes, the antibodies also recognize an additional polypeptide of approximately 70 kDa. When radioiodinated microsomes were immunoprecipitated with anti-B and subjected to sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, again bands of 46, 50, and 70 kDa were observed. The peptide mapping of 50 and 46 kDa bands of the purified enzyme by chemical cleavage with N-chlorosuccinimide gave similar fragmentation patterns. The results indicate that either 70 kDa band is a precursor form of the enzyme or this polypeptide, representing the native enzyme or its subunit, is proteolyzed to smaller, enzymatically active peptide(s) of 50 and 46 kDa during purification despite the inclusion of several inhibitors against serine-proteases in all buffers used for tissue homogenization and enzyme purification. A number of properties of the purified enzyme, including its specific activation by Man-P-Dol were also characterized."
https://openalex.org/W1593186399,"Treatment of prostaglandin (PG)H synthase purified from ram seminal vesicle microsomes with trypsin cleaves the 70-kDa subunits into 33- and 38-kDa fragments (Chen, Y.-N. P., Bienkowski, M. J., and Marnett, L. J. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 16892-16899). In contrast to a minimal decrease in cyclooxygenase activity, peroxidase activity declines rapidly following trypsin treatment. The time course for loss of guaiacol peroxidase activity corresponds closely to the time course for protein cleavage. The ability of trypsin-treated enzyme to support catalytic reduction of 5-phenyl-4-pentenyl-1-hydroperoxide in the presence of reducing substrates is significantly reduced. The products of metabolism of 10-hydroperoxy-8,12-octadecadienoic acid indicate that trypsin-treated enzyme catalyzes homolytic scission of the hydroperoxide bond in contrast to the heterolytic scission catalyzed by intact enzyme. Spectrophotometric titrations of hematin addition to trypsin-treated PGH synthase indicate approximately a 50% reduction in heme binding. These observations suggest that trypsin treatment of PGH synthase decreases the ability of the protein to bind prosthetic heme at a site that controls peroxidase activity. Comparison of the N-terminal sequence of the 38-kDa fragment of trypsin-treated PGH synthase to the amino acid sequence of the intact protein indicates that cleavage occurs between Arg253 and Gly254. Based on literature precedents and the results of the present investigations, we propose that the heme prosthetic group that controls the peroxidase activity of PGH synthase binds to the His residue of the sequence His250-Tyr251-Pro252-Arg253 located immediately adjacent to the trypsin cleavage site."
https://openalex.org/W1488677809,"Abstract Herpes simplex virus (HSV) ribonucleotide reductase activity is specifically inhibited by a synthetic peptide, Tyr-Ala-Gly-Ala-Val-Val-Asn-Asp-Leu (HSV H2-(7-15], corresponding to the carboxyl terminus of its subunit 2 (H2). In order to elucidate the mechanism of action of the nonapeptide a photoreactive analog, [4'-azido-Phe6]HSV H2-(6-15), was synthesized. The photoaffinity probe inhibits HSV ribonucleotide reductase activity, and when radioiodinated, it specifically labeled three viral proteins of 144, 95, and 85 kDa. We demonstrated by immunoprecipitation of the 144- and 95-kDa photolabeled proteins with antibodies specific to subunit 1 (H1) of HSV ribonucleotide reductase that the nonapeptide interacts with H1 and probably with its degradation products. Moreover, we obtained evidence that this specific binding is directly responsible for the ribonucleotide reductase inhibition."
https://openalex.org/W1928528795,"The principal metabolite of Δ1-THC, Δ1-THC-7-oic acid exhibits significant analgesic action in the mouse hot plate test. The parent Δ1-THC has a similar effect when measured at later time points; however, 10 min after drug administration, a pronounced hyperalgesia is seen. This hyperalgesia can be inhibited by prior administration of either indomethacin or Δ1-THC-7-oic acid, presumably because of their ability to inhibit eicosanoid synthesis. Administration of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), at doses that were a small fraction of the Δ1-THC given, resulted in a strong hyperalgesic response. Unlike Δ1-THC, the metabolite does not produce a cataleptic state in the mouse, which eliminates this as a basis for the hot plate response. The evidence presented is consistent with a mechanism in which the metabolite inhibits eicosanoid synthesis whereas the parent drug elevates tissue levels of prostaglandins.— Burstein, S.

https://openalex.org/W1592385070,"A cDNA coding for the catalytic subunit of phosphorylase phosphatase (phosphatase C-I/phosphatase-1c) was cloned from a rabbit muscle cDNA library by screening with oligonucleotide probes. Ten clones were analyzed. The full cDNA sequence of 1395 base pairs contained an open reading frame of 990 base pairs flanked by 3' and 5' noncoding regions of 84 and 321 base pairs, respectively. The DNA sequence (and deduced amino acid sequence) of this cDNA is distinctly different from that of a clone of 1492 base pairs previously reported. Our cDNA is essentially identical to the 1492-base pair clone from residue 182 in the 3' direction, but it is completely different in the 5' direction. Consequently, the amino acid sequence deduced from our cDNA differs by 14 amino acids in the amino terminal from that previously reported and extends for an additional 19 amino acids. Probes to the divergent and common region of our cDNA clone hybridized to an mRNA of the same size by Northern blotting. Thus the cDNA we have isolated appears to code for an isoform of the catalytic subunit of phosphorylase phosphatase."
https://openalex.org/W1577698714,"The oligomeric size of the H,K-ATPase was determined in frozen gastric microsomal vesicles irradiated with high energy electrons. Target sizes of various catalytic activities associated with H,K-ATPase function fell into two distinct groups. The lower group of target sizes described the radiation-induced loss of steady-state phosphoenzyme and structural monomer: the MgATP-dependent formation of a beta-aspartyl phosphate exhibited a size range of 133-147 kDa; the size range for the structural measurement (i.e. loss of H,K-ATPase monomer on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels) was 92-143 kDa. In contrast, a larger group of target sizes described the loss of full cycle catalytic activities (i.e. K+-dependent stimulation of p-nitrophenyl phosphate and ATP hydrolysis). The K+-phosphatase and K+-stimulated ATPase exhibited target sizes fo 200 +/- 13 and 232 +/- 23 kDa, respectively. The lower target size group represents the first evidence that a monomer of the catalytic subunit maintains partial enzyme function. The larger group of target sizes describing K+-phosphatase and ATPase activities suggest that subunit interactions contribute to full cycle catalytic activity. Subunit interactions appear to be involved in all ion transport activities. Passive Rb+ exchange and active H+ transport in reconstituted proteoliposomes exhibited target sizes of 233n = 2 and 388 +/- 48 kDa, respectively. H+ transport appears to require a subunit arrangement more complex than that associated with catalytic activity or passive ion transport."
https://openalex.org/W1566362183,"Chick hepatocytes in primary culture have been used to study the homologous and heterologous pathways of glucagon-induced desensitization of adenylyl cyclase. Scatchard analysis and guanine nucleotide effects on dissociation kinetics indicate that the initial phase of homologous desensitization, an increase in low affinity glucagon receptors due to the rapid uncoupling of the receptor from Gs, is essentially complete within 5 min. These receptors recouple within 20 min upon removal of glucagon. Upon prolonged (2 h or more) exposure of hepatocytes to glucagon, disappearance of low affinity receptors from cell surface membranes constitutes the second phase of homologous desensitization. Recovery of these lost and presumably internalized receptors requires more than 12 h following the removal of glucagon but is not dependent on new protein synthesis. The heterologous phase of desensitization is slower, requiring 20-30 min of glucagon treatment to reach completion. Stimulation of adenylyl cyclase by hormonal and nonhormonal effectors is similarly reduced, indicating a common defect in this desensitized state. Agonist occupancy of other hormone receptors coupled to adenylyl cyclase in hepatocytes, such as beta-adrenergic, prostaglandin E1, and vasoactive intestinal peptide, results in heterologous desensitization. Heterologous desensitization is rapidly reversed (within 30 min) upon partial removal of glucagon, under conditions allowing the maintenance of the homologously desensitized state. Neither onset of nor recovery from heterologous desensitization requires protein synthesis. These data indicate that homologous and heterologous desensitization occurs by independent mechanisms. Homologous desensitization involves uncoupling of the glucagon receptor from Gs, followed by removal of these uncoupled receptors from the cell surface. Heterologous desensitization represents a second level of cellular control of hormonal responsiveness to be turned on when the cell is subjected to prolonged hormonal stimulation and withdrawn when hormone levels are lowered."
https://openalex.org/W1544990785,"The human 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate mutase gene was isolated from genomic libraries and analyzed by Southern blots and DNA sequencing. The transcription initiation site was localized by primer extension as well as by S1 protection of the mRNA. The gene extends over 22 kilobase pairs; it is composed of two introns (8.8 and 11.5 kilobase pairs long) and three exons (84, 662, and 965 base pairs long). The second exon correlates with a functional subdomain of the protein, as shown by comparison with the yeast phosphoglycerate mutase structure. The sequence TAGAAAA was found 30 bases upstream from the transcription initiation site and could be analogous to the TATA box. A sequence homologous to the CCAAT box was found twice, at positions -75 and -178. There is no GC-rich sequence or GC box in the 5'-flanking region of the gene. Northern blot analysis indicates that the 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate mutase mRNA is detected mainly in tissues and cell lines, although it is also present in low amounts in a nonerythroid tissue. A comparison of the 5'-upstream sequences with other promoters active only in cells did not reveal any common signal that could be responsible for the erythroid promoter."
https://openalex.org/W1557741834,"Coculturing IM9 human lymphocytes and A549 human lung adenocarcinoma cells results in a 2-3-fold increase in the density of beta-adrenergic receptors in the latter, as quantified by 125I-cyanopindolol binding. Lymphocyte-conditioned medium (LCM) has the same effect, which is moderately sensitive to heat, is retained by ultrafiltration over a Mr 10,000 cut-off filter, and is reduced by trypsin treatment or by preincubation of lymphocytes with 0.3 micrograms/ml cycloheximide. Treatment of lung cells with cycloheximide also prevents the effect of LCM. Glucocorticoids, which also increase beta-receptor density in A549 cells, markedly potentiate the effect of LCM. Gel permeation high pressure liquid chromatography of LCM yields three peaks of biological activity with Mr 70,000, 35,000, and 15,000. Monocytic interleukin-1 (IL-1) mimics the effect of LCM in that it increases beta-receptor density in A549 cells (EC50 0.3 pM), and its effect is potentiated by cortisol. Recombinant IL-1 alpha is somewhat more potent than IL-1 beta, while interleukin-2 and interferon-alpha are ineffective. Tumor necrosis factor alpha causes a small increase in beta-receptors, which is not influenced by glucocorticoids. A polyclonal anti-IL-1 antibody inhibits the effect of IL-1 and the effect of the 15-kDa but not the 35- and 70-kDa fractions of LCM. The activity of the latter two fractions is also unaffected by anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha antibody. These results indicate that lymphocytes release protein factors including IL-1 that up-regulate pulmonary beta-adrenergic receptors by an action that involves protein synthesis. The possible relevance of this regulatory mechanism for the pathomechanism of certain respiratory diseases is discussed."
