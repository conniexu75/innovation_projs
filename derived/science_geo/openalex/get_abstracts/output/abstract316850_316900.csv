The yeast Candida lipolytica produces alpha-glycols from olefins, presumably by attacking the double bond."

https://openalex.org/W2084064395,"THE Raman spectrum of 80 per cent heavy water obtained with a sample supplied by Prof. H. S. Taylor of Princeton, when compared with the spectrum of the 18 per cent material previously reported1, shows that the water molecule with two atoms of heavy hydrogen gives a Raman band with a frequency difference of 2517, while the molecule with one atom of heavy and one of light hydrogen gives two bands, one of frequency difference of 2623, the other of 3500. Ordinary water gives a band with frequency difference 3445. A single photograph of a sample of given concentration does not bring out this shift as the bands overlap ; but by superposing the two photographs taken with different concentrations, the shift in the centre of gravity of the bands comes out in a very striking manner."

https://openalex.org/W2058255100,"This volume was an early classic during the controversial years before the general acceptance of plate tectonic theory began its rise to the forefront of global geology. The idea of continental drift was originally proposed by A L Wegener, Origin of Continents and Oceans (Braunschweig, 1922) in connection with his analysis of the origin of continents and oceans as a method to help explain anomalous distributive patterns of ancient climate zones [(Koppen-Wegener, Die Klimate der geologischen Vorzeit Borntraeger , Berlin 1924.)] The implications of this proposal seriously challenged many of the beliefs and theories of the constitution of the earth its physical properties tectonics and biologic developments. As a result a considerable furor of opposition arose on all counts but in particular the geophysicists alleged that drift was out of the question because the crust could not endure such forces. Others denied the need for moving the continents to explain either mountain chains or animal and plant disposition in space and time relationships. It has been attempted here to interpret the evidence in terms of two possible mechanisms a) Continental Drift and b) Polar Wandering."
