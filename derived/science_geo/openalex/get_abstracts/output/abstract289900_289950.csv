https://openalex.org/W2046886992,Radiocarbon dates of volcanic activity suggest variations that appear to be related to climatic changes. Historical eruption records also show variations on the scale of years to centuries. These records can be combined with simple climatic models to estimate the impact of various volcanic activity levels. From this analysis it appears that climatic prediction in the range of 2 years to many decades requires broad-scale volcanic activity prediction. Statistical analysis of the volcanic record suggests that some predictability is possible.
https://openalex.org/W2078538749,"Shock wave techniques have been used to investigate the pressure-density relations of metals, silicates, and oxides over the entire range of pressures present in the earth (3.7 × 106 bars at the center). In many materials of geophysical interest, such as iron, wüstite, calcium oxide, and forsterite, major shock-induced phase changes dominate the compression behavior below pressures of 106 bars. The shock wave data for the high-pressure phases of these minerals lead to important inferences about the composition of the lower mantle and outer, liquid core of the earth. The lower mantle of the earth appears to have a slightly higher density than is inferred to correspond to the behavior of an olivine-rich assemblage of the same composition as the upper mantle. The core has a density some 10 percent less than that of pure iron and may have 9 to 12 percent sulfur or about 8 percent oxygen by weight."
https://openalex.org/W2109495034,"Some representatives of the cotton industry and of the entomological profession advocate efforts to eradicate the boll weevil. This coalition originated in 1958 from a complex of socioeconomic changes in cotton production and scientific developments in entomology. The results of a pilot eradication experiment (1971 to 1973) were controversial, and the debate was inhibited by social pressures upon the entomological profession. Substantial conceptual difficulties also attend evaluations of eradication experiments. A new trial eradication program is under way. If its evaluation is not to be warped by problems similar to the earlier ones, both the social and scientific aspects of eradication must be recognized and steps must be taken to ensure a full and open debate."
