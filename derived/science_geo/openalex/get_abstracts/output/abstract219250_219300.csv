The visual equivalent of impending collision was isolated and compared with its sequential inversion. Infant and adult rhesus monkeys manifested persistent avoidance responses to ""looming"" but not to the inverse. This visual stimulus alone is a strong exciter of avoidance, and the response appears early in life."

https://openalex.org/W1974623913,"Many microbial pathogens and toxins recognize animal cells via cell surface sialic acids (Sias) that are alpha 2-3- or alpha 2-8-linked to the underlying glycan chain. Human influenza A/B viruses are unusual in preferring alpha 2-6-linked Sias, undergoing a switch from alpha 2-3 linkage preference during adaptation from animals to humans. This correlates with the expression of alpha 2-6-linked Sias on ciliated human airway epithelial target cells and of alpha 2-3-linked Sias on secreted soluble airway mucins, which are unable to inhibit virus binding. Given several known differences in Sia biology between humans and apes, we asked whether this pattern of airway epithelial Sia linkages is also human-specific. Indeed, we show that since the last common ancestor with apes, humans underwent a concerted bidirectional switch in alpha 2-6-linked Sia expression between airway epithelial cell surfaces and secreted mucins. This can explain why the chimpanzee appears relatively resistant to experimental infection with human Influenza viruses. Other tissues showed additional examples of human-specific increases or decreases in alpha 2-6-linked Sia expression and only one example of a change specific to certain great apes. Furthermore, while human and great ape leukocytes both express alpha 2-6-linked Sias, only human erythrocytes have markedly up-regulated expression. These cell type-specific changes in alpha 2-6-Sia expression during human evolution represent another example of a human-specific change in Sia biology. Because the data set involves multiple great apes, we can also conclude that Sia linkage expression patterns can be conserved during millions of years of evolution within some vertebrate taxa while undergoing sudden major changes in other closely related ones."
https://openalex.org/W2012051752,"Elastin is a polymeric structural protein that imparts the physical properties of extensibility and elastic recoil to tissues. The mechanism of assembly of the tropoelastin monomer into the elastin polymer probably involves extrinsic protein factors but is also related to an intrinsic capacity of elastin for ordered assembly through a process of hydrophobic self-aggregation or coacervation. Using a series of simple recombinant polypeptides based on elastin sequences and mimicking the unusual alternating domain structure of native elastin, we have investigated the influence of sequence motifs and domain structures on the propensity of these polypeptides for coacervation. The number of hydrophobic domains, their context in the alternating domain structure of elastin, and the specific nature of the hydrophobic domains included in the polypeptides all had major effects on self-aggregation. Surprisingly, in polypeptides with the same number of domains, propensity for coacervation was inversely related to the mean Kyte-Doolittle hydropathy of the polypeptide. Point mutations designed to increase the conformational flexibility of hydrophobic domains had the unexpected effect of suppressing coacervation and promoting formation of amyloid-like fibers. Such simple polypeptides provide a useful model system for understanding the relationship between sequence, structure, and mechanism of assembly of polymeric elastin.

Such simple polypeptides provide a useful model system for understanding the relationship between sequence, structure, and mechanism of assembly of polymeric elastin. Elastin is the extracellular matrix protein that imparts the important properties of extensibility and elastic recoil to tissues such as large blood vessels, lung parenchyma and elastic ligaments. To achieve the remarkable durability and structural integrity of the elastin matrix, monomers of elastin must be appropriately aligned and covalently cross-linked into an extensive polymeric fibrillar structure (1.Vrhovski B. Weiss A.S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 258: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). However, the mechanisms by which this assembly process takes place are not well understood.Tropoelastin, the monomeric form of elastin, is coded for by 34 exons in humans. With a few exceptions, each exon codes for either a “hydrophobic” or “cross-linking” domain, and these domains generally alternate along the sequence of the protein. Hydrophobic domains are rich in amino acids such as glycine, proline, valine, and leucine, in many cases present in a variety of tandem repeat sequences. In contrast, cross-linking domains contain the lysine residues that are destined to take part in covalent cross-linking and are often rich in alanine (1.Vrhovski B. Weiss A.S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 258: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar).One of the unusual properties of elastin is its ability to undergo coacervation, a self-aggregation process in which the protein comes out of solution as a second phase on an increase in solution temperature. Coacervation of elastin was first demonstrated with heterogeneous mixtures of polypeptides prepared by hydrolytic solubilization of insoluble, polymeric elastin (2.Partridge S. Davis H. Adair G.

Biochem. 1997; 250: 92-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar) have also been shown to undergo this process. The ability to undergo coacervation is related to the predominantly nonpolar character of these polypeptides, and the kinetics of the transition appears to be that of a nucleation process (3.Urry D.W. Starcher B. Partridge S.M. Nature. 1969; 222: 795-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 12.Vrhovski B. Jensen S. Weiss A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 250: 92-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). The temperature at which this transition takes place is dependent on several factors including protein concentration, ionic strength, and pH (12.Vrhovski B. Jensen S. Weiss A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 250: 92-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 13.Bellingham C.M. Woodhouse K.A. Robson P. Rothstein S.J. Keeley F.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1550: 6-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar).In contrast to heat-induced protein denaturation, which results in disordered structures, coacervation of elastin polypeptides has been shown to promote the formation of well ordered filamentous structures (10.Cox B.

For this reason, it has been proposed that coacervation might play an important physiological role in the ordering and alignment of monomeric elastin for cross-linking into the polymeric elastin matrix (11.Bressan G.

Our laboratory has investigated the coacervation behavior of smaller, well defined recombinant polypeptides based on human elastin sequences (13.Bellingham C.M. Woodhouse K.A. Robson P. Rothstein S.J. Keeley F.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1550: 6-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) and has recently shown that coacervation of polypeptides containing as few as five domains of human elastin promotes alignment of lysine residues for cross-link formation and allows self-assembly of these polypeptides into cross-linked fibrillar matrices with physical properties similar to those of native elastin (16.Bellingham C.M.

R. Soc. Lond. B. 2002; 357: 185-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Such polypeptides provide an excellent model system for understanding the mechanism of polymeric assembly of elastin and the relationship between structural organization and physical properties. Here, using a series of defined recombinant polypeptides modeled after human elastin, we investigate the role of sequence, polypeptide size and character, domain context, and chain flexibility on the process of hydrophobic self-assembly of elastin.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPlasmid ConstructionAll elastin polypeptide plasmids were constructed in a pGEX-2T vector (Amersham Biosciences). Schematic representations of protein sequences are shown in Table I. All polypeptides are named for the hydrophobic exons that they contain. Cross-linking domains separating hydrophobic exons always consist of exons 21 and 23. For example, EP20-24-24 contains exons 20-21-23-24-21-23-24. Methods for plasmid construction and polypeptide expression of polypeptides designated EP20-24, EP20-24-24, EP20-24-26, and EP20-24-30 have been described elsewhere (13.Bellingham C.M. Woodhouse K.A.

Template and primer concentrations and PCR conditions were used as suggested by the manufacturer. PCR products were purified using a QIAEX II gel extraction kit (Qiagen), and ligation was performed using a Rapid DNA ligation kit (Fermentas, Burlington, Canada).EP20-24-24-24-24 (Human Elastin Exons 20-21-23-24-21-23-24-21-23-24-21-23-24)—EP20-24-24 plasmid was digested with restriction enzyme StyI that cuts at the C↓CAAGG asymmetric sequence within exon 21, releasing a 246-bp fragment containing exons 21-23-24. This fragment was self-linked to form a concatamer and religated back into a StyI-digested EP20-24-24 plasmid. Selection of a 1095-bp fragment from BamHI/EcoRI digestion provided the desired construct.EP20-20-20 (Human Elastin Exons 20-21-23-20-21-23-20)—Two PCRs were performed using EP20-24 as the template. The BamHI-Ex20 and Ex23-20L primer set and the Ex23-20U and Ex23 primer set were used to generate two PCR products covering exons 20-21-23-20 and exons 23-20-21-23, respectively. The two fragments were mixed in a subsequent PCR to create a template containing exons 20-21-(23-20-21-23)n for primer sets BamHI-Ex20 and Ex20-EcoRI to generate fragments consisting of exons 20-(21-23-20)n. A 520-bp fragment consisting of exons 20-21-23-20-21-23-20 was purified from the PCR mixture. This fragment was then digested with BamHI and EcoRI and inserted into the BamHI/EcoRI-treated pGEX-2T vector to generate EP20-20-20.EP24-24-24 (Human Elastin Exons 24-21-23-24-21-23-24)—PCR was carried out using EP20-24-24-24-24 as the template and BamHI-Ex24 and Ex24-EcoRI as the primer set. A 650-bp fragment consisting of exon 24-21-23-24-21-23-24 was purified from the PCR products. EP24-24-24 was generated by ligating this 650-bp fragment into the BamHI/EcoRI-treated pGEX-2T vector.EP20-24-LRS 1The abbreviations used are: LRSlamprin repeat sequenceCRSchicken repeat sequence.(a Chimera Containing Human Elastin Exons 20-21-23-24-21-23 and a Tandem Repeated Sequence from Lamprin, a Self-assembling Structural Protein from Lamprey Cartilage (21.Robson P.

This fragment was digested with PstI and ligated with a PstI-treated EP20-24 fragment containing exons 20-21-23 and then used as the template for PCR using primers ApaI-Ex21 and L-0.9-10-EcoRI to obtain a fragment containing exon 21-23 and LRS sequences. The resulting 280-bp fragment was digested with ApaI and ligated with ApaI-treated 2336-bp EP 20-24-24 fragment and used as the template to PCR using primers BamHI-Ex20 and L-0.9-10-EcoRI to generate a 650-bp fragment consisting of exons 20-21-23-24-21-23-LRS sequences. Finally, this fragment was digested with BamHI and EcoRI and ligated into BamHI/EcoRI-digested pGEX-2T vector to create the EP20-24-LRS construct.EP20-24-24[21Y/A] (Human Elastin Exons 20-21-23(Y13/A)-24-21-23(Y13/A)-24)—Plasmid EP20–24 and primers BamHI-Ex20 and Ex21(Y/A) were used to PCR a 180-bp fragment containing exons 20-21 with a Tyr13 → Ala mutation. The wild-type 180-bp BamHI/PpuMI fragment in EP 20–24 was then replaced by the BamHI/PpuMI-treated mutated fragment to make EP20-24 (21Y/A) construct. Subsequently, primers BamHI-Ex20 and Ex24-ApaI as well as ApaI-Ex21 and Ex24-EcoRI were used with EP20-24 Y/A) as the template to generate a 380-bp fragment consisting of exons 20-21-23(Y13/A)-24 and a 280-bp fragment consisting of exons 21-23(Y13/A)-24, respectively. EP20-24-24[21Y/A] was generated by inserting the BamHI/ApaI-digested 380-bp fragment and ApaI/EcoRI-digested 280-bp fragment into the BamHI/EcoRI-treated pGEX-2T vector.EP20-24-24[P/G] (Human Elastin Exons 20-21-23-24-21-23-24(P4, 10,16,22,28,34,40/G)) and EP20–24[P/G]-24[P/G] (Human Elastin Exons 20-21-23-24(P4,10,16,22,28,34,40/G)-21-23-24(P4,10,16,22,28, 34,40/G))—Three pairs of primers (P/G#1 to P/G#6) covering 210 bp of the mutated regions were annealed, phosphorylated, and ligated. The 210-bp PpuMI/EcoRI fragment in EP20-24 was then replaced with the mutated fragment to generate EP20-24[P/G]. Similar to the method for construction of EP20-24-24[21Y/A], EP 20-24[P/G] was used as the template with primers BamHI-Ex20 and Ex24-ApaI as well as ApaI-Ex21 and Ex24-EcoRI to generate a 380-bp mutated fragment consisting of exons 20-21-23-24(P/G) and a 280-bp mutated fragment consisting of exons 21-23-24(P/G), respectively. EP20-24-24[P/G] was generated by inserting the wild type BamHI/ApaI-digested 380-bp fragment from EP20-24-24 and the ApaI/EcoRI-digested 280-bp mutated fragment into the BamHI/EcoRI-treated pGEX-2T vector. EP20-24[P/G]-24[P/G] was constructed by ligating both the mutated BamHI/ApaI-digested 380-bp fragment and the ApaI/EcoRI-digested 280-bp fragment into the BamHI/EcoRI-treated pGEX-2T vector.EP20-24-LRS[Y/A] (a Chimera Containing Human Elastin Exons 20-21-23-24-21-23 and a Tandem Repeated Sequence from Lamprin with Tyrosine 5, 10, 25, 30, and 50 to Alanine Mutations)—Three pairs of primers (LRS(Y/A)#1 to LRS(Y/A)#6) covering 160 bp of the mutated regions were annealed, phosphorylated, and ligated. The 160-bp StuI/EcoRI fragment in EP20-24-LRS was then replaced with the mutated fragment to generate EP20-24-LRS[Y/A].EP20-24-CRS (Human Elastin Exons 20-21-23-24-21-23-24(A9, 15,21,27,33,39,45 Deletions) and EP20-CRS-CRS (Human Elastin Exons 20-21-23-24(A9,15,21,27,33,39,45 Deletions)-21-23-24(A9,15,21,27, 33,39,45 Deletions)—Three pairs of primers (C#1 to C#6) covering 180 bp of the mutated regions were annealed, phosphorylated, and ligated. The 210-bp PpuMI/EcoRI fragment in EP20-24 was then replaced with the mutated fragment to generate EP20-CRS and used as the template with two primer sets (BamHI-Ex20 and Ex24-ApaI, ApaI-Ex21, and Ex24-EcoRI) to generate mutated fragments. The two mutated fragments consist of exons 20-21-23-CRS (340 bp) and exons 21-23-CRS (250 bp), respectively. EP20-24-CRS was generated by inserting the wild type BamHI/ApaI-digested 380-bp fragment from EP 20-24-24 and the ApaI/EcoRI-digested 250-bp mutated fragment into the BamHI/EcoRI-treated pGEX-2T vector. EP20-CRS-CRS was constructed by ligating both the mutated BamHI/ApaI-digested 340-bp fragment and the ApaI/EcoRI-digested 250-bp fragment into the BamHI/EcoRI-treated pGEX-2T vector.EP20-24-CRS[P/G] (Human Elastin Exons 20-21-23-24-21-23-CRS (P4,9,14,19,24,29,34/G)) and EP 20-CRS[P/G]-CRS[P/G] (Human Elastin Exons 20-21-23-CRS(P4,9,14,19,24,29,34/G)-21-23-CRS(P4,9,14, 19,24,29,34/G))—Three pairs of primers (P/G#1 and P/G#2; C(P/G)#3 and C(P/G)#4; C(P/G)#5 and C(P/G)#6) covering 180 bp of the mutated regions were annealed, phosphorylated, and ligated. Similar to the strategy to generate the EP20-24-CRS and EP20-CRS-CRS constructs, the 180-bp mutated fragment was replaced into EP20-24 to generate EP20-CRS[P/G]. EP20-CRS[P/G] was then used as template to construct EP20-24-CRS[P/G] and EP20-CRS[P/G]-CRS[P/G] as described above.All oligonucleotide primers were synthesized, and construct sequences were confirmed using facilities provided by the Centre of Applied Genomics at the Hospital for Sick Children. Synthetic polypeptides consisting of exons 20 and 24 were kindly provided by Dr. A. Tamburro (University of Basilicata, Italy).Polypeptide Expression and PurificationDNA constructs were transformed into BL21 cells by electroporation for peptide expression. A single colony was inoculated in 2× YT with ampicillin (50 μg/ml) and chloramphenicol (34 μg/ml) at 37 °C overnight. This culture was then reamplified in 2× YT containing 2% glucose and ampicillin for 3.5 h (A600 0.8–1.0) before adding isopropyl-α-d-thiogalactopyranoside (0.1 mm) to induce protein expression. After a 4-h incubation at 37 °C, the bacterial culture was harvested by centrifugation for 10 min at 7500 × g. The cell pellet was digested with cyanogen bromide in 70% formic acid at room temperature overnight followed by dialysis (3.5-kDa cut-off; Pierce) against water for 24–36 h. Elastin polypeptides were purified from this mixture by Sephadex G25 (Amersham Biosciences) chromatography, eluting with 20 mm sodium acetate, followed by chromatography using a Sepharose SP (Amersham Biosciences) ion exchange column eluted with 80 mm NaCl in 20 mm sodium acetate. All of the polypeptides (excluding EP20-24[P/G]-24[P/G]) were desalted on a Sephadex G25 column and lyophilized before final purification by reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography using a Jupiter 10-μm C4 300-Å column (Phenomenex, Torrance, CA). Amino acid compositions and concentrations of all polypeptides were determined by amino acid analysis, and molecular weights were confirmed by Q-TOF mass spectrometry using the facilities of the Advanced Protein Technology Centre (Hospital for Sick Children).Coacervation of PolypeptidesUnless otherwise noted, polypeptides were dissolved in coacervation buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7, containing 1 mm CaCl2 and 1.5 m NaCl), and coacervation was performed by increasing solution temperature at a rate of 1 °C/min, monitoring absorbance at 440 nm using a Cary 3 spectrophotometer equipped with a temperature controller. Coacervation temperature was determined as the temperature of onset of increased absorption (13.Bellingham C.M. Woodhouse K.A. Robson P. Rothstein S.J. Keeley F.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1550: 6-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar).Circular Dichroism SpectrometryPolypeptides were dissolved in water at 15 μm and stored overnight at room temperature. CD spectra were obtained at 20 °C using an AVIV 62DS spectrometer.Thioflavin-T AssayThe assay for binding of thioflavin-T was performed according to Ref. 22.LeVine H.I. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 309: 274-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (1186) Google Scholar. Briefly, polypeptides were dissolved in water at a concentration of 0.5 μg/μl and left at room temperature for 4 h. Then 10 μl of polypeptide was incrementally added to 1 ml of 3 μm thioflavin-T in potassium phosphate buffer (50 mm, pH 6.0). Fluorescence at 482 nm (excitation at 450 nm) was monitored using a Hitachi F-4000 fluorescence spectrophotometer. β-amyloid 1-28 (American Peptide Co., Sunnyvale, CA) was used as positive control.Transmission Electron MicroscopyEP20-24-24(P/G) was dissolved at a concentration of 250 μm in water containing 1.5 m NaCl, incubated at 20 °C overnight, and stored at 4 °C for 1 week. The sample was then applied to a carbon-coated copper grid, negatively stained with 2% aqueous uranyl acetate, and viewed under a Hitachi H600 transmission electron microscope as described elsewhere (17.Keeley F.W. Bellingham C.M. Woodhouse K.A. Phil. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B. 2002; 357: 185-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar).RESULTSRepresentations of the polypeptides used, along with domain sequences, are shown in Table I. All polypeptides are named on the basis of their hydrophobic exons; intervening cross-linking domains, consisting of exons 21 and 23, are always identical, with the exception of EP20-24-24[21Y/A], in which the tyrosine residues in the two copies of exon 21 were mutated to alanines. Characteristics of the polypeptides, including molecular weight, hydropathy, and coacervation temperature under standard conditions (see “Experimental Procedures”) are also included. Mean hydropathies of the polypeptides were calculated as the sum of the Kyte-Doolittle hydropathy values for each amino acid (23.Kyte J. Doolittle R. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 105-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (16998) Google Scholar) divided by the number of amino acids.Number of Hydrophobic Domains—The ability of native tropoelastin or elastin polypeptides to coacervate has been attributed to the presence of the hydrophobic domains (19.Toonkool P. Jensen S.A. Maxwell A.L. Weiss A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44575-44580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Indeed, earlier data from our laboratory using recombinant human elastin polypeptides demonstrated that polypeptides containing cross-linking domains alone did not undergo coacervation (13.Bellingham C.M. Woodhouse K.A. Robson P. Rothstein S.J. Keeley F.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1550: 6-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Using polypeptides EP20-24, EP20-24-24, and EP20-24-24-24-24, which differ in the number but not in the nature of hydrophobic domains, we investigated the effect of hydrophobic domain number on the propensity for self-aggregation in these polypeptides. In all cases, polypeptide concentrations and salt contents of the coacervation buffer were identical (25 μm polypeptide and 1.5 m NaCl, respectively). All three polypeptides underwent coacervation. EP20-24, containing two hydrophobic domains flanking a single cross-linking domain, coacervated at ∼41 °C, whereas EP20-24-24 and EP20-24-24-24-24, containing three and five hydrophobic domains, coacervated at ∼29 and 21 °C, respectively (Fig. 1A). These results indicated a strong relationship between number of hydrophobic domains and propensity for self-aggregation (Fig. 1B). Because of the similarity in composition of these three polypeptides, their mean hydropathies were essentially identical (Table I).Co-coacervation Behavior of Polypeptide Mixtures—The nucleation-like kinetics of self-aggregation of elastin polypeptides raises the question of whether coacervation of one polypeptide can induce that process for other elastin polypeptides in solution. Availability of elastin polypeptides with similar natures but widely differing coacervation temperatures provided the possibility of investigating this question. Equal concentrations (12.5 μm) of EP20-24 and EP20-24-24-24-24 were dissolved in the standard coacervation buffer (see “Experimental Procedures”), and the solution temperature was raised. Under these conditions, EP20-24 and EP20-24-24-24-24 alone coacervate at ∼52 and 22 °C, respectively (Fig. 2). In an equimolar mixture with EP20-24-24-24-24, the coacervation temperature of EP20-24 was unchanged. Moreover, despite the coacervation of EP20-24-24-24-24 at 22 °C, EP20-24 remained in solution until the expected coacervation temperature for this polypeptide was reached (Fig. 2). These results indicated that the process of coacervation of each of these two polypeptides was independent of the presence of the second polypeptide in solution.Fig. 2Co-coacervation of mixtures of elastin polypeptides. EP20-24 (12.5 μm) (▪) and EP20-24-24-24-24 (12.5 μm) (•) were each coacervated alone under standard buffer conditions. The solution temperature of a mixture of 12.5 μm each of EP20-24 and EP20-24-24-24-24 (○) was raised to 30 °C, and the coacervated material was removed by centrifugation at 30 °C. The temperature of the remaining solution (□) was t"
https://openalex.org/W2099217381,"Asthmatic patients have higher numbers of mast cells in the smooth muscle layer of airways than normal subjects. Human airway smooth muscle cells (HASMCs) are a source of various cytokines including transforming growth factor beta1 (TGF-beta1), which is chemotactic for mast cells. We have thus examined the potential for interaction between HASMCs and mast cells and have investigated, in particular, the hypothesis that after stimulation, HASMCs can induce mast cell chemotaxis through the production of cytokines. Supernatants of HASMCs treated with the major mast cell product tryptase had increased chemotactic activity for the HMC-1 mast cell line. The effect depended on an intact catalytic site for tryptase and could be induced by a peptide agonist for protease activated receptor 2. Chemotactic activity was related to the synthesis of TGF-beta1 by HASMCs and, to a lesser extent, to stem cell factor. The number of mast cells within the smooth muscle layer of asthmatic patients was closely related to TGF-beta1 expression by smooth muscle. HASMCs may thus be able to stimulate the accumulation of mast cells, and these cells may, in turn, stimulate the secretion of chemotactic factors by HASMCs."
https://openalex.org/W2048851904,"The AT2 receptor regulates several functions of nerve cells, e.g., ionic fluxes, cell differentiation, and axonal regeneration, but also modulates programmed cell death. We tested the hypothesis that angiotensin II (ANG II) via its AT2 receptor not only promotes regeneration but also functional recovery after sciatic nerve crush in adult rats. ANG II (10(-7), 10(-9), 10(-11) M) applied locally via osmotic minipumps promoted functional recovery with maximal effects after the lowest concentration. The toe spread distance as a parameter for re-innervation after 20 days was significantly (P<0.01) greater (10.2+/-10.27 mm) compared with the control group (8.73+/-0.16 mm). The response to local electrical stimulation (return of sensorimotor function) was reduced to 14.6 days vs. 17.9 days in the control group (P<0.01). The AT2 receptor antagonist PD 123319 administered alone or in combination with ANG II completely prevented the ANG II-induced recovery, whereas the AT1 receptor antagonist losartan had no effect. Furthermore, ANG II induces, via the AT2 receptor, activation of the transcription factor NF-kappaB in Schwann cells. Histological criteria, morphometric analyses, and electron microscopy confirmed the functional data. These results are the first to present direct evidence for an involvement of the AT2 receptor and NF-kappaB in peripheral nerve regeneration."
https://openalex.org/W2007753040,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative disorder affecting primarily motor neurons. Growing evidence suggests a mitochondrial defect in ALS. The precise molecular mechanisms underlying those defects are unknown. We studied the expression of mitochondrial uncoupling proteins (UCPs), key regulators of mitochondrial functions, in tissues from a mouse model of ALS (SOD1 G86R transgenic mice) and from muscular biopsies of human sporadic ALS. Surprisingly, in SOD1 G86R mice, UCPs, and particularly UCP3, were upregulated in skeletal muscle but not in spinal cord. Consistent with this pattern of expression, ATP levels were selectively depleted in muscle but not in neural tissues 1 month before disease onset and the respiratory control ratio of isolated mitochondria is decreased. UCP3 up-regulation was not observed in experimentally denervated muscles, suggesting that changes in muscular UCP3 expression are associated with the physiopathological processes of ALS. This is further supported by our observation of increased UCP3 levels in human ALS muscular biopsies. We propose that UCP3 up-regulation in skeletal muscle contributes to the characteristic mitochondrial damage of ALS and to the onset of the disease. Moreover, since skeletal muscle is a key metabolic tissue, our findings suggest that ALS may not solely arise from neuronal events but also from more generalized metabolic defects."
https://openalex.org/W2076008643,"Genotoxic stresses stabilize the p53 tumor suppressor protein which, in turn, transactivates target genes to cause apoptosis. Although Noxa, a “BH3-only” member of the Bcl-2 family, was shown to be a target of p53-mediated transactivation and to function as a mediator of p53-dependent apoptosis through mitochondrial dysfunction, the molecular mechanism by which Noxa causes mitochondrial dysfunction is largely unknown. Here we show that two domains (BH3 domain and mitochondrial targeting domain) in Noxa are essential for the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria. Noxainduced cytochrome c release is inhibited by permeability transition pore inhibitors such as CsA or MgCl2, and Noxa induces an ultra-structural change of mitochondria yielding “swollen” mitochondria that are unlike changes induced by tBid. This indicates that Noxa may activate the permeability transition-related pore to release cytochrome c from mitochondria into cytosol. Moreover, Bak-oligomerization, which is an essential event for tBid-induced cytochrome c release in the extrinsic death signaling pathway, is not associated with Noxa-induced cytochrome c release. This finding suggests that the pathway of Noxa-induced mitochondrial dysfunction is distinct from the one of tBid-induced mitochondrial dysfunction. Thus, we propose that there are at least two different pathways of mitochondrial dysfunction; one mediated through Noxa in response to genotoxic stresses and the other through tBid in response to death ligands. Genotoxic stresses stabilize the p53 tumor suppressor protein which, in turn, transactivates target genes to cause apoptosis.

Thus, we propose that there are at least two different pathways of mitochondrial dysfunction; one mediated through Noxa in response to genotoxic stresses and the other through tBid in response to death ligands. The p53 mutation is found in more than half of all human cancer patients. Cancers with loss of p53 function are often resistant to chemotherapeutic agents mainly because of the absence of p53-dependent apoptosis (1Clarke A.R. Purdie C.A. Harrison D.J. Morris R.G. Bird C.C.

Science. 1994; 266: 807-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (1537) Google Scholar). The p53-dependent apoptosis largely depends on the capability of p53 to function as a transcription factor, although recent reports show that the transcription-independent function of p53 plays a role in this process. There are many target genes (e.g. Apaf-1, DR5, p53AIP, PUMA, and Noxa) transactivated by p53 that are proposed to mediate p53-dependent apoptosis in various cancer cells (4El-Deiry W.S. Cell Death Differ. 2001; 8: 1066-1075Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). A recent report shows a close correlation between p53 level and Noxa induction that could be a key determinant of chemically induced hepatocellular carcinoma in mice, suggesting that Noxa is a crucial mediator of p53-dependent apoptosis in the liver (5Eferl R. Ricci R. Kenner L. Zenz R. David J.P. Rath M. Wagner E.F. Cell. 2003; 112: 181-192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). Noxa induced by p53 is up-regulated by x-ray irradiation and is heavily dependent on p53 and its homologue p73 (6Flores E.R. Tsai K.Y. Crowley D. Sengupta S. Yang A. McKeon F. Jacks T. Nature. 2002; 416: 560-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar). Noxa belongs to the “BH3-only” branch of the Bcl-2 protein family, although mouse Noxa has two BH3 domains, whereas other BH3-only proteins have a single BH3 domain. Like many Bcl-2 family proteins that translocate to mitochondria and modulate mitochondrial function, Noxa translocates to mitochondria and then leads to cytochrome c release and caspase-9 activation (7Oda E.

Most of the BH3-only proteins such as Bid and Bim appear to induce efflux of mitochondrial deathstimulating proteins through Bax or Bak homo-oligomerization leading to the permeabilization of the mitochondrial outer membrane (8Wei M.C.

However, the detailed molecular mechanism by which Noxa induces mitochondrial dysfunction remains to be solved. In these studies, we characterize Noxa-induced mitochondrial dysfunction in order to provide insight into the molecular mechanism by which p53 induces apoptosis. We show that Noxa causes mitochondrial dysfunction by a distinct pathway in mediating p53-dependent apoptosis, unlike mitochondrial dysfunction induced by tBid in response to FasL or tumor necrosis factor-α. Cell Culture and Mitochondrial Localization—HeLa cells were seeded onto an 8-well Lab-Tek chamber slide glass (Nunc) and were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen).

Mitochondrial localization was analyzed with a laser scanning confocal microscope (Leica Microsystems TCS NT). green fluorescent protein benzyloxycarbonyl-VAD-fluoromethyl ketone mitochondrial targeting domain permeability transition cyclosporin A. Immunostaining of Cytochrome c—HeLa cells were rinsed with PBS three times and fixed with ice-cold 2% buffered paraformaldehyde (pH 7.4) for 10 min. After washing with PBS and blocking with a buffer containing 0.1% saponin and 0.05% BSA in PBS, pH 7.4, for 30 min, the cells were incubated with anti-cytochrome c antibody (dilution 1:250, BD Biosciences) for 1 h at 30 °C and then washed with the blocking buffer. Tetramethylrhodamine-labeled anti-mouse IgG antibody (dilution 1:250, BD Biosciences) was added to the cells, and they were incubated for 1 h more. After washing with PBS, cells were examined with the laser scanning confocal microscope. Apoptosis Assay—HeLa cells were cultured in 24-well plates and transfected with the indicated plasmid constructs. Each well was harvasted after 48 h of culture, and lysates were prepared using the luciferase assay system (Promega). Luciferase activities were determined by using a Micro-Lumat Plus LB96V microplate luminometer (Berthold Technologies) and were normalized against control β-galactosidase activities. Purification of Recombinant Human Noxa—Recombinant human Noxa protein was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) cells transformed with pET30(+)a-human Noxa (1–54). It was induced by the addition of 0.8 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 3 hours. Purification was carried out according to the company's instructions (Novagen). Cytochrome c Release Assay and Assay of Endonuclease G Activity—Isolated mitochondria treated with recombinant Noxa protein were incubated at 30 °C for 1 h in buffer containing 250 mm sucrose, 10 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.5, 2 mm KH2PO4, 5 mm sodium succinate, and 25 μm EGTA. After centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min, supernatants were subjected to SDS-PAGE, and released cytochrome c was visualized by Western blot analysis. Analysis of Bak-oligomerization—Mitochondria were isolated from either mouse or rat liver and treated with either tBid or Noxa before incubation for 1 h at 30 °C. After centrifugation, mitochondrial pellets were resuspended in buffer B containing 250 mm sucrose, 10 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.5, 2 mm KH2PO4, 5 mm sodium succinate, and 25 μm EGTA. A cross-linking agent of bismaleimide hexane (10 μm) or alternatively, Me2SO as a control, was then added. After further incubation for 30 min at room temperature with shaking, mitochondrial pellets were harvested by centrifugation and then analyzed by Western blot analyses using anti-Bak antibody. Alignment of Expressed Sequence Tag Clones of Noxa Homologues—Expressed sequence tag clones of cow, chicken, and pig Noxa were identified by a Blast search at the NCBI web site using human Noxa/APR as the reference. GenBank accession numbers of identified expressed sequence tag clones containing cow, chicken, and pig homologues of Noxa are BF075905, AJ450393, and AF319660, respectively. It has been reported that mouse Noxa has two BH3 domains and induces apoptosis, whereas human Noxa has only one BH3 domain. First, to determine whether human Noxa is able to induce cell death in HeLa cells, GFP-Noxa (1–54) was transfected into HeLa cells. As shown in Fig. 1A, GFP-Noxa (1–54) induced cell death, and Bcl-xL blocked Noxa-induced cell death. In addition, the pan-caspase inhibitor z-VAD-fmk inhibited Noxa-induced cell death, indicating that caspases play a crucial role in Noxa-induced cell death. These results indicate that one BH3 domain in human Noxa is sufficient to induce apoptosis. To determine whether cytochrome c release accompanies human Noxa-induced cell death, GFP-Noxa (1–54) was transfected into HeLa cells, and the cells were immunostained using anti-cytochrome c antibody. HeLa cells transfected with human Noxa showed diffuse cytochrome c distribution throughout the cytosol, but control cells (transfected with GFP alone) maintained the typical mitochondrial distribution of cytochrome c (Fig. 1B), indicating that cytochrome c release from mitochondria is an event induced during human Noxa-mediated cell death. To further confirm that human Noxa targets to mitochondria and causes mitochondrial dysfunction, we checked whether GFP-Noxa (1–54) was present in mitochondria after transfection. GFP-Noxa (1–54) showed a punctate distribution typical of mitochondria (Fig. 1C, left panel, green color), and mitochondrial localization of Noxa was confirmed by overlapping staining (Fig. 1C, right panel, yellow color) with Mitotracker (Fig. 1C, middle panel, red color). This finding is in agreement with a previous report showing the mitochondrial localization of mouse Noxa when using an adenovirus expressing mouse Noxa and suggests that human Noxa is functionally identical to mouse Noxa despite having a single BH3 domain (7Oda E. Ohki R. Murasawa H. Nemoto J. Shibue T. Yamashita T. Tokino T. Taniguchi T. Tanaka N. Science. 2000; 288: 1053-1058Crossref PubMed Scopus (1678) Google Scholar). Although the data indicated that human Noxa causes the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria in HeLa cells, it was not clear whether Noxa is able to directly trigger efflux of death-stimulating proteins from the inter-membrane space of mitochondria or whether another, non-mitochondrial, factor is also necessary. To address this question, we adopted the in vitro system of Noxa-induced mitochondrial dysfunction. In this system, recombinant human Noxa protein was able to induce cytochrome c release directly from isolated mitochondria. Noxa-induced cytochrome c release was inhibited by BclxLΔTM (Fig. 2, A and B). These results strongly suggest that the presence of human Noxa in mitochondria is enough to induce mitochondrial dysfunction. It has been shown that a death ligand-activated BH3-only protein, tBid, targets to the mitochondria and that the DEF helices of tBid play a crucial role in this localization. We hypothesized that human Noxa may have a mitochondrial targeting domain (MTD), similar to tBid. To determine the MTD of Noxa, various expression plasmids of Noxa fused to GFP were transfected into HeLa cells (Fig. 3A). In Fig. 1 we showed that Noxa (1–54) displays the punctate distribution that is typical of a mitochondrial staining pattern, and mitochondrial distribution of Noxa (1–54) was confirmed by overlapped staining with Mitotracker. This same punctate distribution disappeared in Noxa (1–30) and Noxa (1–40); however, Noxa (21–54) and Noxa (31–54) maintained a similar pattern, indicating that Noxa (31–54) contains the MTD. To define the MTD of Noxa, Noxa (31–54) was dissected as shown in Fig. 3B. Noxa (31–40) and Noxa (31–45) showed a dispersed cytoplasmic distribution, whereas Noxa (41–54) and Noxa (41–50) displayed the punctate pattern. These results demonstrate that human Noxa (41–50) contains the entire MTD. This MTD seems to be conserved between human, mouse, cow, pig, and chicken (Fig. 3C), suggesting that the MTD of Noxa is functionally significant for induction of cell death in p53-dependent apoptosis. To verify whether human Noxa needs the MTD to kill cells, plasmids containing various GFP-Noxa constructs and a reporter gene were co-transfected into HeLa cells. Noxa (1–54) and Noxa (21–54), which have intact BH3 and MTD domains, were able to induce cell death (Fig. 3D). We further confirmed that the cell killing induced by Noxa (1–54) and Noxa (21–54) was associated with an efflux of cytochrome c from mitochondria (Fig. 4). Interestingly, Noxa (11–40) and Noxa (21–40), which have the BH3 domain but not the MTD domain, failed to induce cell death (Fig. 3D). In addition, Noxa (31–54) and Noxa (41–54), which have the MTD domain but harbor a disrupted BH3 domain or no BH3 domain, respectively, failed to induce apoptosis, indicating that the MTD domain is necessary but not enough to induce cell death (Fig. 3D). These results demonstrate that the killing activity of the Noxa BH3 domain is functional only when it targets to mitochondria, and this mitochondria targeting is mediated by the MTD. It is known that after engagement of death ligands to death receptors, caspase-8-activated tBid binds to cardiolipin, which exists exclusively in the mitochondrial membrane and is enriched at the inner membrane and the mitochondrial contact sites. The interaction of tBid with cardiolipin is a critical step for tBid targeting to mitochondria (10Lutter M. Fang M. Luo X. Nishijima M. Xie X. Wang X. Nat. Cell. Bio. 2000; 2: 754-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar, 11Lutter M. Perkins G.A. Wang X. BMC Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 22Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). To understand the molecular mechanism by which Noxa targets to mitochondria in p53-dependent apoptosis, we examined whether Noxa also targets to cardiolipin like tBid. It is unlikely that Noxa binds to cardiolipin (data not shown), and it implies that p53-mediated mitochondrial dysfunction through Noxa might be distinct from mitochondria dysfunction triggered by death ligands that is mediated through tBid. To examine whether Noxa triggers an efflux of mitochondrial proteins in a manner distinct from tBid, we examined the inhibitory activity of CsA in a cytochrome c release assay. CsA showed no significant change in the release of cytochrome c induced by tBid, consistent with a previous report (12Kim T.H. Zhao Y. Barber M.J. Kuharsky D.K. Yin X.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39474-39481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) (Fig. 5A). On the other hand, calcium, which is a strong activator of the PT pore, was able to release cytochrome c from isolated mitochondria and, as expected, was inhibited by CsA. Surprisingly, CsA also blocked Noxa-induced cytochrome c release. In addition, Mg2+, another inhibitor of the PT pore, was also able to inhibit Noxa-induced cytochrome c release, indicating that Noxa in p53-dependent apoptosis is likely to cause efflux of mitochondrial proteins through a PT-related pore in a manner that is distinct from the tBid-induced pathway activated by death ligands. Bak-oligomerization is a key event of tBid-induced cytochrome c release. In fact, tBid is unable to release cytochrome c from Bak-deficient mitochondria (8Wei M.C. Zong W.X. Cheng E.H. Lindsten T. Panoutsakopoulou V. Ross A.J. Roth K.A. MacGregor G.R. Thompson C.B. Korsmeyer S.J. Science. 2001; 292: 727-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (3299) Google Scholar, 9Wei M.C. Lindsten T. Mootha V.K. Weiler S. Gross A. Ashiya M. Thompson C.B. Korsmeyer S.J. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2060-2071Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A recent report showed that unlike mouse liver, rat liver mitochondria display little or no cytochrome c release in response to tBid because of either insufficient or absent Bak in their mitochondria (13Brustovetsky N. Dubinsky J.M. Antonsson B. Jemmerson R. J. Neurochem. 2003; 84: 196-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Therefore, we analyzed Bak-oligomerization using mouse and rat liver mitochondria to determine whether Bak-oligomerization is an important component of Noxa-induced cytochrome c release. The cross-linker bismaleimide hexane or (as a control) Me2SO has been used for Bak-oligomerization analyses. As expected, tBid induced significant Bak-oligomerization from mouse but not rat mitochondria. Noxa did not cause significant Bak-oligomerization in either case, although it was able to effect cytochrome c release (Fig. 5B). Furthermore, our results confirmed that rat liver mitochondria only release a small amount of cytochrome c in response to tBid (Fig. 5B). On the other hand, Noxa was able to release a comparable amount of cytochrome c from both rat and mouse mitochondria without Bak-oligomerization. These results reveal that Bak-oligomerization is not required for cytochrome c release in response to Noxa. However, we do not rule out the possibility that Bax may be involved in the Noxa-induced cytochrome c release because Bax is able to compensate for Bak-deficiency. Because CsA and Mg2+ are blocking agents of the PT pore and inhibit Noxa-induced cytochrome c release (Fig. 5A), we assumed that Noxa is likely to activate the PT pore, resulting in mitochondrial swelling. We next measured mitochondrial swelling by light scatter after Noxa treatment; however, we were unable to detect any significant high amplitude swelling (data not shown). Recently, Scorrano et al. reported that tBid causes cristae-remodeling of the mitochondrial structure, resulting in the movement of cytochrome c stores (14Scorrano L. Ashiya M. Buttle K. Weiler S. Oakes S.A. Mannella C.A. Korsmeyer S.J. Dev. Cell. 2002; 2: 55-67Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (869) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that Noxa might also cause ultra-structural changes in the mitochondria without high amplitude swelling, and this structural change might be distinct from that induced by tBid. To examine the hypothesis, morphological changes of mitochondria treated with tBid, Noxa, or calcium were observed using electron microscopy. As shown in Fig. 6A, freshly isolated mitochondria showed an electron-dense matrix of the isolated mitochondria, the typical “condensed state” described by Hackenbrock (15Hackenbrock C.R. J. Cell Biol. 1966; 30: 269-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar). When tBid was used to treat the mitochondria, the electron-dense matrix was reorganized to have mitochondrial features showing a “sausage-shaped” electrondense matrix (Fig. 6B), as described by Scorrano et al. (14Scorrano L. Ashiya M. Buttle K. Weiler S. Oakes S.A. Mannella C.A. Korsmeyer S.J. Dev. Cell. 2002; 2: 55-67Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (869) Google Scholar). Noxa-treated mitochondria, however, showed an expanded and dilute matrix, and small matrical granules with tubularshaped cristae were widely dispersed (Fig. 6C). These morphological changes are characteristics of “swollen” mitochondria as designated by Hackenbrock. It is likely that these morphological changes take place without large amplitude mitochondrial swelling because no significant changes in mitochondrial size were observed. Thus, Noxa seems to cause changes in the mitochondrial ultra-structure characteristic of swollen mitochondria without inducing large-amplitude swelling. Mitochondrial dysfunction in response to FasL or tumor necrosis factor-α seems to be mediated through tBid activated by caspase-8. This process requires either Bak- or Bax-oligomerization to release cytochrome c and Smac without the opening of PT pores (8Wei M.C. Zong W.X. Cheng E.H. Lindsten T. Panoutsakopoulou V. Ross A.J. Roth K.A. MacGregor G.R. Thompson C.B. Korsmeyer S.J. Science. 2001; 292: 727-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (3299) Google Scholar, 9Wei M.C. Lindsten T. Mootha V.K. Weiler S. Gross A. Ashiya M.

However, Bid may not be essential for mitochondrial dysfunction in stress-activated death stimuli such as γ-irradiation because Bid-deficient hepatocytes are able to lose membrane potential of mitochondria in response to these death stimuli (17Yin X.M. Wang K. Gross A. Zhao Y. Zinkel S. Klocke B. Roth K.A. Korsmeyer S.J. Nature. 1999; 400: 886-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (860) Google Scholar). This indicates that there is an alternative pathway leading to mitochondrial dysfunction in stressactivated death stimuli. Noxa may be the candidate protein for induction of this alternative pathway because Noxa is transactivated by p53 in response to genotoxic agents, and Noxa causes mitochondrial dysfunction (7Oda E. Ohki R. Murasawa H. Nemoto J. Shibue T. Yamashita T. Tokino T. Taniguchi T. Tanaka N. Science. 2000; 288: 1053-1058Crossref PubMed Scopus (1678) Google Scholar). Indeed, our present results show the differences of cytochrome c releases from mitochondria induced by tBid or Noxa. First, Noxa-induced cytochrome c release is not dependent upon Bak-oligomerization, whereas Bax- or Bak-oligomerization is requisite for tBid-induced cytochrome c release. Although our data indicate that Noxa-induced mitochondrial dysfunction is not associated with Bak-oligomerization, we do not rule out the possibility of Bax participation in this process. The fact that thymocytes isolated from Bax-/- and Bak-/- mice are resistant to etoposide-induced apoptosis suggests that Bax might be associated with Noxa-induced mitochondrial dysfunction. However, this remains to be answered. Second, PT-related components might, at least in part, participate in the Noxa-induced permeabilization of the mitochondrial outer membrane because the PT pore inhibitors CsA and Mg2+ are able to inhibit Noxa-induced cytochrome c release. This is further supported by a Noxa-induced swollen electron-dilute matrix, an indicator of the opening of the PT pore. This supports the notion that stressactivated p53 utilizes Noxa which leads to mitochondrial dysfunction in a distinct pathway through PT-related pore. Together, it suggests that there are two different pathways in the permeabilization of the mitochondrial outer membrane which are activated by different death stimuli. This notion might provide an explanation for enhanced apoptotic response of some cancer cells to combinatory treatment of genotoxic agents and death ligand. Bax-deficient colorectal cancer cells, for instance, are resistant to TRAIL alone, mainly because of the lack of cytochrome c release; however, these cells are sensitive to TRAIL and the topoisomerase I inhibitor camptothecin. It is possible that Bax-deficient cells have the defective pathway of mitochondrial death signaling induced by tBid; however, the camptothecin might restore the mitochondrial death signaling through Noxa-mediated pathway.

https://openalex.org/W2095588856,"Thymosin beta4 is a ubiquitous 43 amino acid, 5 kDa polypeptide that is an important mediator of cell proliferation, migration, and differentiation. It is the most abundant member of the beta-thymosin family in mammalian tissue and is regarded as the main G-actin sequestering peptide. Thymosin beta4 is angiogenic and can promote endothelial cell migration and adhesion, tubule formation, aortic ring sprouting, and angiogenesis. It also accelerates wound healing and reduces inflammation when applied in dermal wound-healing assays. Using naturally occurring thymosin beta4, proteolytic fragments, and synthetic peptides, we find that a seven amino acid actin binding motif of thymosin beta4 is essential for its angiogenic activity. Migration assays with human umbilical vein endothelial cells and vessel sprouting assays using chick aortic arches show that thymosin beta4 and the actin-binding motif of the peptide display near-identical activity at ~50 nM, whereas peptides lacking any portion of the actin motif were inactive. Furthermore, adhesion to thymosin beta4 was blocked by this seven amino acid peptide demonstrating it as the major thymosin beta4 cell binding site on the molecule. The adhesion and sprouting activity of thymosin beta4 was inhibited with the addition of 5-50 nM soluble actin. These results demonstrate that the actin binding motif of thymosin beta4 is an essential site for its angiogenic activity."
https://openalex.org/W2122111818,"A decline in stress tolerance is a hallmark of aging. For instance, older organisms showed extensive hepatic damage, along with increased morbidity and mortality, after environmental heating. We hypothesized that hyperthermic challenge would produce exaggerated oxidative stress in old animals, leading to increased hepatic injury. After a heat-stress protocol, time-course changes in reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, oxidative damage markers, glutathione (GSH)/glutathione disulfide (GSSG) ratios, and activation of stress-response transcription factors (AP-1 and NF-kappaB) were measured in young and old rats. A small, transient increase in hepatic oxidative damage, with minimal injury, was observed in young rats. However, old rats showed widespread hepatic injury that was manifested over a 24 h period after heating. This pathology was preceded by elevated steady-state levels of ROS, along with large increases in lipid peroxidation products, prolonged hepatic DNA oxidation damage, aberrant GSH/GSSG profiles, and altered activation patterns for AP-1. These data indicate that young animals have an effective oxidation-reduction buffering system in the liver that provides protection from oxidative damage to intracellular macromolecules under stress conditions. In sharp contrast, an environmental challenge in older animals produces exaggerated oxidative stress and alterations in signal transduction pathways, which can contribute to cellular dysfunction and age-related reductions in stress tolerance."
https://openalex.org/W2016166905,"Focal adhesion kinase (FAK) is a protein tyrosine kinase enriched in focal adhesions, which plays a critical role in integrin-dependent cell motility and survival. The crucial step in its activation is autophosphorylation on Tyr-397, which promotes the recruitment of several enzymes including Src family kinases and the activation of multiple signaling pathways. We found in a yeast two-hybrid screen that the N-terminal domain of FAK interacted with protein inhibitor of activated STAT1 (PIAS1). This interaction was confirmed and shown to be direct using in vitro assays. PIAS1 was co-immunoprecipitated with FAK from transfected cells and brain extracts. PIAS1 has recently been recognized as a small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) ligase. In the presence of PIAS1 and SUMO-1, FAK was sumoylated in intact cells, whereas PYK2, a closely related enzyme, was not. Sumoylation occurred on Lys-152, a residue conserved in FAK during evolution. Sumoylated FAK, like PIAS1, was recovered predominantly from the nuclear fraction. Sumoylation did not require the catalytic activity or autophosphorylation of FAK. In contrast, sumoylation increased dramatically the ability of FAK to autophosphorylate in intact cells and in immune precipitate kinase assays. Endogenous FAK was sumoylated in the presence of PIAS1 and SUMO-1 independently of cell adhesion, and autophosphorylation of sumoylated FAK was persistently increased in suspended cells.

In contrast to the recent progress in elucidating the signaling pathways downstream from FAK, relatively little is known about the molecular mechanisms regulating FAK activity. The tyrosine kinase domain of FAK occupies a central position in the molecule. The C-terminal region encompasses two prolinerich sequences, sites of multiple protein-protein interactions (see Ref. 5Schaller M.D. Biochim. Biophys.

This domain has the capacity to interact with ezrin (19Poullet P. Gautreau A. Kadare G. Girault J.A. Louvard D. Arpin M. J. Biol.

To elucidate the role and partners of the N-terminal domain of FAK, we undertook a yeast two-hybrid screen and identified a novel interaction partner, PIAS1, a protein initially cloned as a specific inhibitor of activated STAT1 (24Liu B.

Yeast Two-hybrid Screen—The N-terminal domains of rat FAK (amino acids 1–361) and PYK2 (amino acids 2–364) were cloned in pBTM116 and used as baits in L40 yeast strain co-transformed with a human brain cDNA library (Clontech). Transformants were plated on agar selection medium lacking tryptophan, leucine, and histidine. Colonies were isolated and retested for growth in minimal medium and for β-galactosidase activity. Clones positive for both tests were used for retransformation of yeast strains expressing heterologous baits, including N-PYK2, to determine the specificity of the interactions. Constructs and Site-directed Mutagenesis—GST-PIAS1 and GST-ΔPIAS1 were obtained by subcloning full-length PIAS1 from pSG5-PIAS1 (a kind gift from J. Tan, University of North Carolina) and ΔPIAS1 from pACT2 prey plasmid, respectively, into pGEX-4T-1 and pGEX-4T-2 (Amersham Biosciences). GST-N-FAK was made by ligating a BamHI-BglII fragment comprising FAK sequence (amino acids 1–361) from pLexA-N-FAK into BamHI-digested pGEX-4T-1 plasmid. For cell transfection, an HA-tagged PIAS1 plasmid was constructed by insertion of full-length PIAS1 from pSG5-PIAS1 digested with EcoRI and XhoI into the pcDNA3-HA. Substitution of Lys-152 of FAK with an arginine was carried out with QuikChange (Stratagene).

Biochemical Procedures—Extracts from freshly dissected tissues (∼50 mg) or cell lysates were prepared in modified radioimmune precipitation assay buffer as described (23Toutant M. Costa A. Studler J.M. Kadare G. Carnaud M. Girault J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 7731-7743Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), except for the presence, when indicated, of 10 mmN-ethylmaleimide (NEM, Sigma). After clarification with 100 μl of Sephacryl beads, the supernatants were used for immunoprecipitation or GST pull-down in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (2 μg of GST fusion protein on glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences)/500 μl of cell lysate). Recombinant GST and GST fusion proteins were produced in BL21(DE3) Escherichia coli strain (Stratagene) and purified on glutathione-Sepharose 4B. PIAS1 was in vitro translated using T7 TnT-Quick (Promega) in the presence of [35S]methionine. Binding reactions were carried out at 4 °C for 16 h in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl pH 7.8, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.5 mm EDTA, 5 mm MgCl2, and protease inhibitors (Complete, Roche Molecular Biochemicals). For “far Western” assays, purified recombinant proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE without previous boiling, transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane, and stained with Ponceau red. Proteins were partly renatured by incubation in buffer (Hepes, pH 7.4, MgCl2 10 mm, NaCl 50 mm, EDTA 1 mm, dithiothreitol 1 mm, glycerol 10%) for 24 h. After saturation of nonspecific sites with 5% nonfat dry milk, the membrane was incubated overnight with purified recombinant GST-N-FAK (75 ng/cm2 of membrane), washed extensively, and processed for immunoblotting using anti-FAK antibody A-17. The other procedures were as described (23Toutant M. Costa A. Studler J.M. Kadare G. Carnaud M. Girault J.A. Mol. Cell.

J. 2000; 348: 119-128Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Identification of a Direct Interaction between PIAS1 and FAK N-terminal Domain by Yeast Two-hybrid and in Vitro Assays—A yeast two-hybrid screen of a human brain cDNA library using the N-terminal domain of FAK as a bait yielded 407 positive clones of 2 × 106 transformants, among which 125 were randomly selected for further analysis. They were tested for specificity using three different baits: DNA-binding domain of LexA alone or fused in-frame with the N-terminal domain of PYK2 (a kinase closely related to FAK) or with lamin (used as a control for “sticky” preys). Only 36 clones satisfied the specificity criteria yielding His+, LacZ+ colonies exclusively with FAK N-terminal domain as bait. Several of these clones coded for the same proteins and following restriction analysis and sequencing we identified five different proteins as potential partners of FAK N-terminal domain. Two independent clones were found to encode human PIAS1 C-terminal region (amino acids 403–651, here referred to as ΔPIAS1). PIAS1 is the member of a small protein family with a central RING-finger-like motif and a less conserved C-terminal region (corresponding to ΔPIAS1) (31Shuai K. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2638-2644Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). PIAS1 regulates the activity of several transcription factors including STAT1 (24Liu B. Liao J. Rao X. Kushner S.A.

Oncogene. 2001; 20: 3880-3887Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) but its interaction with signaling enzymes has not been reported. To confirm and further characterize the interaction between FAK and PIAS1, we tested the ability of GST fusion proteins comprising full-length PIAS1 or ΔPIAS1 to bind FAK. In GST pull-down experiments, transfected FAK protein was retained by GST-PIAS1 or GST-ΔPIAS1 but not by GST (Fig. 1A, lanes 3, 5, and 7). In cells transfected with the vector alone, endogenous FAK was also retained by GST-PIAS1 or GST-ΔPIAS1 (Fig. 1A, lanes 2 and 6). These results confirmed that ΔPIAS1 was sufficient for binding of FAK. Conversely, GST-N-FAK was able to bind full-length in vitro translated [35S]PIAS1 (Fig. 1B, lane 2), whereas GST control beads did not (Fig. 1B, lane 3). Thus, full-length PIAS1 and FAK were able to bind to each other, showing that the corresponding interacting surfaces are fully accessible in the entire proteins. GST pull-down assays demonstrated that PIAS1 interacted similarly with endogenous FAK from various rat tissues, which express different alternatively spliced isoforms of FAK (36Burgaya F. Toutant M. Studler J.M. Costa A. Le Bert M. Gelman M. Girault J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28720-28725Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1C). Although the above results suggested that the FAK-PIAS1 interaction was direct, the existence of an unidentified bridging partner could not be excluded completely. To provide unequivocal evidence that the interaction was direct, we used soluble GST-N-FAK as a probe to carry out a far Western blot of purified recombinant proteins: GST-PIAS1, GST-ΔPIAS1, GST-N-kiaa316 (N-terminal region of a hypothetical protein similar to N-FAK; Ref. 18Girault J.A. Labesse G. Mornon J.P. Callebaut I. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 54-57Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), or GST-PEA15 (unrelated protein). GST-N-FAK labeled GST-PIAS1 and GST-ΔPIAS1 protein bands (Fig. 2A, right panel) but not the other irrelevant proteins present on the same membrane, including the molecular weight markers (see Fig. 2A, left panel). This experiment demonstrated that the interaction between FAK and PIAS1 did not require an additional protein. FAK and PIAS1 Are Associated in Transfected Cells and Brain Extracts—We analyzed the association between FAK and PIAS1 transfected in COS-7 cells, using immunoprecipitation with anti-PIAS1 serum followed by immunoblotting with an anti-FAK monoclonal antibody. FAK was detected in the PIAS1 immune precipitate when the two proteins were cotransfected (Fig. 2B). A specific interaction between FAK and PIAS1 was also detected in rat hippocampal extracts subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-PIAS1 serum followed by FAK immunoblotting (Fig. 2C). These results demonstrated that FAK and PIAS1 proteins interact in transfected cells and that the endogenous proteins also interact in brain. In both cases the amounts of co-immunoprecipitated protein were low, suggesting that only a minor proportion of FAK is associated with PIAS1. FAK Is Modified by SUMO-1 in the Presence of PIAS1— PIAS1 has been shown to interact with SUMO-1 and its E2 conjugase, Ubc9, leading to the SUMO modification of several proteins including p53 (25Schmidt D. Muller S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 2872-2877Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar, 37Kahyo T. Nishida T. Yasuda H. Mol.

Chem. 2000; 275: 36316-36323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). SUMO is a small protein that can be linked covalently to the ϵ-amino group of a lysine residue on a substrate protein via an enzymatic pathway resembling that of ubiquitination, although sumoylation appears to play multiple roles that are distinct from those of ubiquitination (39Melchior F. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 591-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar). We explored the possibility that PIAS1 can function as an E3 SUMO ligase toward FAK, using COS-7 cells co-transfected with FAK and increasing amounts of PIAS1. Co-transfection of SUMO-1 was needed in these experiments, because COS-7 cells contain very small amounts of unconjugated endogenous SUMO-1 (39Melchior F. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 591-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar). N-Ethylmaleimide, a cysteine alkylating agent that inhibits SUMO-deconjugating enzymes (40Li S.J. Hochstrasser M. Nature. 1999; 398: 246-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar, 41Gong L. Kamitani T. Millas S. Yeh E.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14212-14216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), was added to the lysis buffer to stabilize sumoylated proteins. Sumoylation of FAK, which migrates normally as a 125-kDa band, was investigated by examining the appearance of an immunoreactive band with an increased molecular mass corresponding to the FAK-SUMO conjugate (Fig. 3). A FAK-immunoreactive band migrating at about 145 kDa appeared when the amount of co-transfected PIAS1 was increased in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3A). The 145-kDa band was also immunoreactive with an anti-SUMO monoclonal antibody (Fig. 3B, lanes 3–5), indicating that it corresponded to sumoylated FAK. To unequivocally establish that the high molecular mass band corresponded to sumoylated FAK, transfected cell extracts were immunoprecipitated with an anti-FAK serum and immunoblotted with anti-FAK (Fig. 3C) and anti-SUMO-1 monoclonal antibodies (Fig. 3D). The 145-kDa protein was immunoprecipitated as efficiently as FAK protein and detected by both anti-FAK (Fig. 3C, lanes 3–5) and anti-SUMO-1 antibodies (Fig. 3D, lanes 3–5), confirming that it corresponded to SUMO-1-modified FAK. The migration of the SUMO-modified FAK was consistent with the addition of a single SUMO-1 molecule. These data demonstrate that in transfected cells FAK is sumoylated in the presence of PIAS1, which most probably functions as an E3 SUMO ligase. PIAS1 Induces Sumoylation of FAK at Lys-152—Sumoylation of proteins occurs at specific lysine residues, in most cases embedded in a consensus sequence, ΨKXE (42Hochstrasser M. Cell. 2001; 107: 5-8Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar), in which Ψ is a large hydrophobic residue and X is any amino acid. In some cases Glu (E) is replaced by Asp (D) (43Johnson E.S. Blobel G. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 981-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar, 44Rui H.L. Fan E. Zhou H.M. Xu Z. Zhang Y. Lin S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42981-42986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). We found in the FAK sequence a single matching motif surrounding Lys-152 (Fig. 4A). It is remarkable that this motif was conserved, not only among FAK proteins of different vertebrate species in which the sequence identity is very high, but also in Drosophila and Anopheles, in which there is much less overall conservation in the N terminus (Fig. 4A). To examine whether Lys-152 was the acceptor site for conjugation of SUMO, we mutated this residue to arginine. The mutant FAK protein, FAK K152R, was not modified by SUMO-1 (Fig. 4B, lane 4). Even longer exposure times failed to reveal any traces of SUMO-1-modified FAK, indicating that Lys-152 was the only sumoylation site. Mutation of Lys-152 prevented the attachment of SUMO-1 to FAK but not its interaction with PIAS1, because FAK K152R and wild type FAK were similarly able to interact with GST-PIAS1 (Fig. 4C, lanes 2 and 3). PYK2, a tyrosine kinase closely related to FAK (∼45% sequence identity), but which lacks a lysine corresponding to Lys-152 (Fig. 4A) and did not interact with PIAS1 in yeast two hybrid (see above), was not sumoylated in COS-7 cells (data not shown). Altogether, these results demonstrated that PIAS1 induces the sumoylation of FAK on Lys-152, a site conserved in FAK molecules but absent from PYK2. Sumoylated FAK Is Enriched in the Nuclear Fraction and Sumoylation Is Independent of Its Autophosphorylation and Kinase Activity—Sumoylation occurs mainly in the nucleus (39Melchior F. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 591-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar). In transfected COS-7 cells, PIAS1, a predominantly nuclear protein (45Kotaja N. Karvonen U. Janne O.A. Palvimo J.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 5222-5234Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar), was almost exclusively found in the nuclear soluble fraction (Fig. 4D, lane 5). The bulk of sumoylated-FAK was also in this nuclear fraction (Fig. 4D, lane 5), suggesting that sumoylation of FAK occurred in the nucleus, as reported for most sumoylated proteins (39Melchior F. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 591-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar). Because FAK is a tyrosine kinase regulated by autophosphorylation, we examined whether phosphorylation and/or kinase activity were important for its sumoylation. Neither autophosphorylation of FAK nor its kinase activity was required for its sumoylation, as shown by the study of FAK molecules with mutations Y397F, K454R (kinase dead mutant), or both (Fig. 4E, lanes 4, 6, and 8). In addition, splice variants of FAK with an increased capacity to undergo autophosphorylation (36Burgaya F. Toutant M. Studler J.M. Costa A. Le Bert M. Gelman M. Girault J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28720-28725Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) were sumoylated to the same extent as the standard isoform (data not shown). Taken together, these results show that conjugation of SUMO-1 to FAK is a process independent of its autophosphorylation and catalytic activity. Sumoylation of FAK Increases Its Autophosphorylation— Sumoylation has been reported to exert various effects on substrate proteins. It can modulate protein-protein interactions (46Matunis M.J. Wu J. Blobel G. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 499-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar), compete ubiquitination if both occur on the same residue (47Desterro J.M. Rodriguez M.S. Hay R.T. Mol.

Chem. 2002; 277: 23658-23663Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Because the autophosphorylation of FAK is an essential step in its activation and function, we examined whether it was altered by SUMO-1 modification. We compared the level of phosphorylation of sumoylated and nonsumoylated FAK in COS-7 cells co-transfected with plasmids expressing FAK, SUMO-1, and increasing amounts of PIAS1 using an antibody that specifically recognizes the phosphorylated form of Tyr-397 (23Toutant M. Costa A. Studler J.M. Kadare G. Carnaud M. Girault J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 7731-7743Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) (Fig. 5A). For various proportions of sumoylated FAK (Fig. 5A, left panel), a markedly higher Tyr-397 phosphorylation signal was detected in FAK-SUMO as compared with FAK (Fig. 5A, right panel). Binding of PIAS1 by itself did not alter autophosphorylation, because FAK K152R, which binds PIAS1 but is not sumoylated (see above), gave a similar pattern of autophosphorylation as wild type FAK (Fig. 5B). Because sumoylation did not depend on phosphorylation (see above), these results show that sumoylation of FAK increased the phosphorylation level of Tyr-397 in intact cells. FAK autophosphorylation on Tyr-397 is known to create a high affinity binding site for the Src homology 2 domain of Src and Fyn (11Cobb B.S. Schaller M.D. Leu T.H. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 147-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). These kinases phosphorylate other tyrosine residues in FAK, including Tyr-576 and Tyr-577 in the activation loop of the kinase domain, thereby enhancing intermolecular phosphorylation of Tyr-397 (54Salazar E.P. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17788-17795Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). However, the effects of FAK sumoylation did not appear to involve Src family kinases, because they were unchanged in the presence of an inhibitor of these enzymes, and phosphorylation of Tyr-577 in sumoylated FAK was low (data not shown). Increased phosphorylation levels of Tyr-397 in cells could result from stimulation of its phosphorylation or inhibition of its dephosphorylation. To gain further insight into the mechanism of the enhanced phosphorylation of FAK-SUMO, we performed an in vitro kinase assay. FAK-SUMO and FAK were immunoprecipitated, and the immune complexes were dephosphorylated by the action of GST-PTP-β tyrosine phosphatase and incubated in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP (30Toutant M. Studler J.M. Burgaya F. Costa A. Ezan P. Gelman M. Girault J.A. Biochem. J. 2000; 348: 119-128Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After SDS-PAGE, proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose and analyzed by immunoblotting for FAK and by autoradiography (Fig. 5C, left and middle panels). The amount of 32P incorporated in FAK-SUMO was higher than in nonsumoylated FAK (438 ± 58%, mean ± S.E., n = 14, p < 0.002, Student t test, cpm corrected for the amounts of the corresponding protein). Immunoblotting of the membrane with P-Tyr-397 antibody confirmed that the increased incorporation of 32P in sumoylated FAK correlated with high levels of immunoreactivity for P-Tyr-397 (Fig. 5C, right panel). Thus, the increased level of phosphorylation of FAK-SUMO on Tyr-397 compared with FAK can be accounted for by an increase in its intrinsic ability to autophosphorylate. In contrast, sumoylation only moderately increased the activity of FAK toward an exogenous substrate, poly-GluTyr (4:1) in vitro (FAK 613 ± 37 cpm, sumoylated FAK 1010 ± 28 cpm, n = 3, p < 0.001). Although the mechanisms of activation of FAK autophosphorylation by the conjugation of SUMO are not known, they may involve a modulation of the regulatory role of the N-terminal FERM domain and/or a facilitation of the intermolecular interactions (22Chan P.Y. Kanner S.B. Whitney G. Aruffo A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20567-20574Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Toutant M. Costa A. Studler J.M. Kadare G. Carnaud M. Girault J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 7731-7743Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Sumoylation Promotes Autophosphorylation of Endogenous FAK Independently of Cell Adhesion—When we examined cells transiently expressing PIAS1 and SUMO-1, we found that a significant proportion of endogenous FAK was sumoylated (Fig. 5C). As in the case of transfected FAK, endogenous sumoylated FAK was enriched in the nuclear fraction (data not shown). Because FAK activation is promoted by integrin engagement and is cell adhesion-dependent (5Schaller M.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1540: 1-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar), we examined the consequences of adhesion on sumoylation. The amount of endogenous FAK in the sumoylated form was similar in attached or suspended cells in the presence of PIAS1 and SUMO-1 (Fig. 5E, left panel). Moreover, whereas Tyr-397 of unconjugated FAK was markedly dephosphorylated following cell suspension, autophosphorylation of SUMO-FAK was unchanged (Fig. 5E, right panel). These results indicate that sumoylation of FAK and the resulting increased autophosphorylation occur and/or persist independently of cell adhesion. Possible Functional Implications of FAK Interaction with PIAS1 and Sumoylation—Our data revealing that PIAS1 interacts with FAK and triggers its sumoylation, presumably in the nucleus, are surprising since FAK is a cytoplasmic protein that has a well characterized function at the plasma membrane. However, the presence of truncated forms of FAK and of the full-length protein in the nucleus has already been reported, suggesting that FAK may have a role in the nucleus under some circumstances (55Stewart A. Ham C. Zachary I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 299: 62-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 56Yi X.P. Wang X. Gerdes A.M. Li F. Hypertension. 2003; 41: 1317-1323Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). An attractive hypothesis would thus be that FAK undergoes a nucleocytoplasmic cycling that allows its nuclear sumoylation in the presence of PIAS1. Interestingly, the related protein PYK2 has recently been shown to undergo a regulated accumulation in the nucleus (57Farshori P.Q. Shah B.H. Arora K.K. Martinez-Fuentes A. Catt K.J. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2003; 85: 337-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 58Aoto H. Sasaki H. Ishino M. Sasaki T. Cell Struct. Funct. 2002; 27: 47-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), although its mechanisms remain to be established. Similarly, it will be important to determine whether the fraction of FAK in the nucleus can be regulated by post-translational modifications and/or interaction with other proteins, including PIAS1. Unfortunately little is known about the regulation of PIAS1 expression or activity. A number of proteins associated with plasma membrane adhesion receptors are known to undergo a regulated translocation to the nucleus and to alter nuclear function (59Aplin A.E. Juliano R.L. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 187-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 60Aplin A.E. FEBS Lett. 2003; 534: 11-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). It is tempting to speculate that FAK may have a similar function and could represent the first example of a tyrosine kinase capable to signal at focal adhesions as well as in the nucleus. Because autophosphorylation is the critical step in FAK activation and because sumoylation stimulates dramatically FAK autophosphorylation, PIAS1-catalyzed sumoylation of FAK might represent an additional regulatory step controlling the function of FAK in the nucleus. To establish this function it will be critical to identify possible targets of FAK in the nucleus or possibly in its vicinity (61Xie Z. Sanada K. Samuels B.A. Shih H. Tsai L.H. Cell. 2003; 114: 469-482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). In summary, our results show that FAK can be sumoylated in the presence of PIAS1, presumably following nuclear translocation, suggesting that FAK may play a novel role in signaling between the plasma membrane and the nucleus. We thank Jacques Camonis for the gift of yeast two-hybrid plasmids, advice, and stimulating discussions, Jiann-An Tan for the pSG5-PIAS1 plasmid, Jacob Seeler for pSG5-SUMO-1, Alexandre Maucuer and André Sobel for stathmin antibodies, and Sylvie Clain for assistance in figure preparation."
https://openalex.org/W2155874884,"The maintenance of endothelial integrity is important for prevention of vascular diseases. Several growth factors, such as bFGF and angiopoietin-1, have been shown to suppress endothelial cell apoptosis and thus help to maintain endothelial integrity. Several studies suggested that receptor activator of NF-kappaB (RANK) and its ligand (RANKL) could be involved in endothelial physiology. Using immunofluorescence and reverse transcriptase-polymerse chain reaction, we found that RANK was expressed by endothelial cells, and RANKL was expressed by arterial smooth muscle cells. Furthermore, RANKL suppressed apoptosis of primary cultured endothelial cells. The RANKL-induced survival appeared to be dependent on PI 3'-kinase activity, because wortmannin and LY294002, PI 3'-kinase-specific inhibitors, blocked the RANKL-induced survival effect. RANKL elicited the phosphorylation of the serine-threonine kinase Akt at Ser473 in a PI 3'-kinase-dependent manner. The expression of a dominant-negative form of Akt or pretreatment of Akt-specific inhibitor in endothelial cells reversed the RANKL-induced survival effect. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha, which causes endothelial cell apoptosis, induced endothelial cells to express osteoprotegerin, a decoy receptor that inhibits RANK-RANKL signaling. These findings indicate that RANK, in response to the paracrine stimulus of RANKL, may play an important role in maintaining endothelial cell integrity through the PI 3'-kinase/Akt signal transduction pathway."

https://openalex.org/W2010676601,"Evidence from several rodent models has suggested that a reduction of either atrial natriuretic peptide or its receptor in the heart affects cardiac remodeling by promoting the onset of cardiac hypertrophy. The atrial natriuretic peptide receptor mediates signaling at least in part via the generation of intracellular cyclic GMP. To directly test whether accumulation of intracellular cyclic GMP conveys protection against cardiac hypertrophy, we engineered transgenic mice that overexpress a catalytic fragment of constitutively active guanylate cyclase domain of the atrial natriuretic peptide receptor in a cardiomyocyte-specific manner. Expression of the transgene increased the intracellular concentration of cyclic GMP specifically within cardiomyocytes and had no detectable effect on cardiac performance under basal conditions. However, expression of the transgene attenuated the effects of the pharmacologic hypertrophic agent isoproterenol on cardiac wall thickness and prevented the onset of the fetal gene expression program normally associated with cardiac hypertrophy. Likewise, expression of the transgene inhibited the hypertrophic effects of abdominal aortic constriction, since it abolished its effects on ventricular wall thickness and greatly attenuated its effects on cardiomyocyte size. Altogether, our results suggest that cyclic GMP is a cardioprotective agent against hypertrophy that acts via a direct local effect on cardiomyocytes. Evidence from several rodent models has suggested that a reduction of either atrial natriuretic peptide or its receptor in the heart affects cardiac remodeling by promoting the onset of cardiac hypertrophy.

A great number of studies have used animal models of transgenesis or gene inactivation to test the possible roles of these pathways in the induction of LVH in vivo. However, the contributions of possible negative regulators of LVH have so far received much less attention. Recently, several lines of evidence have suggested that atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and endothelial nitric-oxide synthase may act as such negative regulators, since 1) blood-pressure-independent LVH is present in mice with either general (3Knowles J.W. Esposito J.W. Mao L. Hagaman J.R. Fox J.E. Smithies O. Rockman H.A. Maeda N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 107: 975-984Google Scholar) or cardiomyocyte-restricted (4Holtwick R. van Eickels M.

Rossi K. Garbers D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2703-2706Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar); 3) we have shown that cardiac mass and ventricular expression of ANP were both associated (in an inverse fashion) with a naturally occurring allele of natriuretic peptide precursor A (i.e. the gene that codes for ANP) (6Masciotra S.

Kawashima S. Yamashita T. Hirase T. Ohashi Y. Inoue N. Hirata K.-I. Yokohama M. Circ. J. 2002; 66: 851-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The common denominator between ANP and endothelial nitric-oxide synthase is that many (if not most) of their biologic effects are mediated by cGMP (10Brenner B.M. Ballerman B.J. Gunning M.E. Zeidel M.L. Physiol. Rev. 1990; 70: 665-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (843) Google Scholar, 11Denninger J.W. Marletta M.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1411: 334-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar). Interestingly, it has also been shown that cGMP protects cultured neonatal cardiomyocytes against the effects of hypertrophic agents in vitro (12Calderone A. Thaik C.M. Takahashi N. Chang D.L.F.

To address this central question, we have engineered transgenic (TG) mice that express a constitutively activated guanylate cyclase domain of the NPRA receptor in a cardiomyocyte-specific manner and tested whether expression of the transgene inhibited the effects of exogenous hypertrophic stimuli. DNA Constructs and TG Animals—A portion of the rat cDNA coding for NPRA (15Chinkers M. Garbers D.L. Chang M.-S. Lowe D.G. Chin H. Goeddel D.V. Schulz S. Nature. 1989; 338: 78-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (877) Google Scholar) (generous gift from D. G. Garbers, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center) ranging from nt 2547 to 3478 was amplified by PCR. This generated a cDNA fragment coding for a cytoplasmic domain of NPRA containing the catalytic fragment of the guanylate cyclase domain. It has been shown that this fragment codes for a soluble cytoplasmic protein that has constitutive guanylate cyclase activity in transfected COS cells (16Thompson D.K. Garbers D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 425-430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 17Kohno M. Horio T. Yokokawa K. Kurihara N. Takeda T. Hypertension. 1992; 19: 320-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). This cDNA fragment was cloned downstream of a 5.8-kb fragment of the α-myosin heavy chain gene promoter (generous gift from J. Robbins, University of Cincinnati) and upstream of a portion of the rabbit β-globin gene containing an intron and a polyadenylation signal. The excised construct was microinjected in hybrid F1 C3H-C57Bl/6 embryos according to standard protocols. Three TG founder lines (named TG9, TG19, and TG41) with germ line integration were generated in this fashion. Results shown hereafter are from experiments performed with TG19, but similar results have been obtained with animals from the other two lines (data not shown). All of the founder lines were back-crossed into the C57Bl/6 mouse strain. For experimental purposes, all TG animals had been back-crossed for at least five generations and were compared with non-TG (NT) littermates. To avoid the possible artifactual influence of gene inactivation by insertion, all TG animals used for experiments were heterozygous for the transgene. The institutional Institut de Recherches Cliniques review board approved all animal protocols used in this study. Transgene Expression—Tissue-specific expression of the transgene was verified by Northern blot analysis of total RNA extracted from either heart, kidney, liver, striated muscle, lung, stomach, spleen, or brain. In some additional mice, adult mouse cardiomyocytes were isolated from the ventricles of 12-week-old mice (either NT or TG) by Langendorff perfusion of sequential solutions containing various concentrations of proteases and/or Ca2+, as described previously (18Zhou Y.-Y. Wang S.-Q. Zhu W.-Z. Chruscinski A. Kobilka B.K. Ziman B. Wang S. Lakatta E.G. Cheng H. Xiao R.-P. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: H429-H436Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This preparation yielded mostly viable and noncontracting rod-shaped cells along with minor amounts of cellular debris. Cell preparations were used to measure guanylate cyclase activity in soluble and particulate fractions. Freshly prepared cells were disrupted in homogenization buffer at 4 °C with a glass-glass homogenizer. The cytosolic fraction was prepared by recovering the supernatant after centrifuging the homogenates at 100,000 × g for 60 min at 4 °C. For preparation of the particulate fraction, the pellet was resuspended in homogenization buffer containing 1% Triton X-100 and incubated for 15 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was recovered after centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 60 min at 4 °C. Guanylate cyclase activity was measured in aliquots of both fractions (containing 12 μg of protein) as described previously (19Deschepper C.F. Picard S. J. Neurochem. 1994; 62: 1974-1982Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Isolated adult mouse cardiomyocytes were also used to measure intracellular cGMP concentration, as described previously (20Mazzetti L. Ruocco C. Giovannelli L. Ciuffi M. Franchi-Micheli S. Marra F. Zilletti L. Failli P. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2001; 134: 596-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Immediately after isolation, the cells were incubated for 10 min at 37 °C in fetal bovine serum-supplemented Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium in the presence of 200 μm isobutylmethylxanthine (to inhibit phosphodiesterases). After centrifugation, the pellets were extracted two times with 65% ethanol, the extracts were evaporated, and extracts were resuspended in assay buffer to assay cGMP by radioimmune assay. The remaining pellets were dissolved in 0.1 n NaOH for protein determination. Adenylyl Cyclase Stimulation—Freshly isolated cardiomyocytes from the hearts of 3-month-old TG and NT mice were disrupted at 4 °C in buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 250 mm sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitors. Plasma membranes were then recovered by centrifugation at 2000 rpm at 4 °C and further resuspended in 500 μl of buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 4 mm MgCl2, and protease inhibitors. Aliquots of 25 μl of plasma membranes were then added to 200 μl of assay buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm ATP, 15 mm creatinine phosphate, 1 mg/ml creatine kinase, 10 μm GTP, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm isobutylmethylxanthine, either with or without 10–7m isoproterenol. The membranes were further incubated for 4 min at 37 °C, and the reaction was stopped by the addition of 200 μl of cold 0.2 m HCl and quick freezing at –70 °C. After thawing, proteins were precipitated by centrifugation, and the amount of cAMP generated in the supernatants was assayed by radioimmune assay. The results were normalized for protein content. Animal Procedures—LVH was induced in TG male mice and their NT littermates by two different experimental maneuvers. The first method involved the subcutaneous implantation of an Alzet osmotic minipump (Durect, Cupertino, CA) delivering isoproterenol (30 mg/kg/day) for 4 days to 12-week-old male mice, as reported previously (21Saadane N. Alpert L. Chalifour L.E. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1999; 127: 1165-1176Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). For the second method, LVH was induced by surgical introduction of an abdominal aortic constriction (AAC) on 8-week-old mice under isoflurane anesthesia. A blunted 26-gauge needle was positioned on top of the abdominal aorta (rostrally to the renal arteries), a suture was placed around both the needle and the aorta with a 6-0 nylon string, and the needle was subsequently withdrawn. The hearts were collected from 12-week-old mice 4 weeks after surgery. All groups of mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation, body weight (BW) was measured, the hearts were dissected out, the atria were discarded, and heart weight (HW) was determined to calculate the HW/BW ratio. Systolic Blood Pressure—Systolic blood pressures of TG and NT mice were measured by computerized tail cuff plethysmography with the BP-2000 apparatus (Visitech Systems, Apex, NC) according to previously published procedures (22Krege J.H. Hodgin J.B. Hagaman J.R. Smithies O. Hypertension. 1995; 25: 1111-1115Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). Briefly, mice were trained to the apparatus for a total of 10 uninterrupted days. Final values were the average of ∼20 successful recordings performed during the last 2 days. Echocardiography—Ventricular hypertrophy and cardiac function were evaluated by echocardiography at the end of treatment in mice lightly sedated with Avertin (1.25%, 9–10 ml/kg body weight). Care was taken to verify that heart rate was always higher that 500 beats/min in each mouse undergoing the investigation. Echocardiography was performed using a Sonos 5500 (Hewlett Packard) equipped with a 15-MHz linear array transducer. Two-dimensional directed M-mode images were obtained in both parasternal long axis and short axis views at the level of papillary muscles and used for the measurement of ventricular dimensions. All of the measurements were performed according to the guidelines recommended by the American Society of Echocardiography (23Sahn D.J. DeMaaria A. Kisslo J. Weyman A. Circulation. 2001; 58: 1072-1083Crossref Scopus (7143) Google Scholar). Accordingly, the thicknesses of LV posterior wall (LVPW) and interventricular septal wall (IVSW) were measured during diastole. LV internal diameters were measured during diastole (LVIDd) and during systole (LVIDs). LV fractional shortening and ejection fraction were calculated with the established standard equations. Stroke volume was determined by Doppler velocity recordings performed at the base of the ascending aorta. The value of stroke volume was multiplied by heart rate to calculate cardiac output, and the latter was divided by body weight to calculate cardiac output index. Cardiomyocyte Morphology—Adult mouse cardiomyocytes were isolated from the ventricles of 12-week-old mice (either NT or TG, with either AAC or sham surgery performed at 8 weeks of age) as described above. The cells were fixed, and their dimensions were quantified by videomicroscopy using previously published procedures (24Deschepper C.F. Picard S. Thibault G. Touyz R. Rouleau J.L. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 82: H149-H155Google Scholar). Northern Blot Analyses—Total RNA was extracted from cardiac ventricles obtained from NT and TG mice implanted with either a sham or an isoproterenol-delivering osmotic minipump, and aliquots of 10 μg were separated on an agarose gel before transfer to a nylon membrane. The cDNA probes used for hybridization to the membranes were the 32P-labeled cDNAs of the following genes: 1) natriuretic peptide precursor A (gift of D. G. Gardner, San Francisco, CA); 2) natriuretic peptide precursor B (gift of M. Nemer, Montréal, Canada); 3) the muscle isoform of rat carnitine palmitoyltransferase I (M-CPT-I; gift from H. Terada, Shomachi, Japan); and 4) rat medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (MCAD) (gift of D. P. Kelly, St. Louis, MO). Hybridized blots were exposed to a phosphor screen cassette. The signals were visualized and quantified using ImageQuant software (Amersham Biosciences) and normalized to the intensity of the ethidium bromide-stained 18 S ribosomal band in each sample. Statistics—Comparisons between groups were performed by one-way analysis of variance followed by Fisher's LSD post hoc tests. The tissue distribution of transgene mRNA expression was determined by Northern blot analysis (Fig. 1A). Transgene expression was readily detected in 10 μg of total RNA from heart of TG mice but not in RNA from any other tissue tested. At the protein level, we found that soluble guanylate cyclase activity was about 4 times higher in extracts of isolated cardiomyocytes from TG as compared with those from NT littermates (Fig. 1B). In contrast, particulate guanylate cyclase activity was not significantly higher in cardiomyocytes isolated from TG mice (1787 ± 128 fmol/mg, mean ± S.E.) as compared with that from NT animals (1536 ± 272 fmol/mg). These results are compatible with the prediction that the expressed protein would be cytosolic. Moreover, cGMP concentration was significantly higher in cardiomyocytes isolated from TG mice (386 ± 62 fmol/mg of protein) than in those from NT mice (172 ± 44 fmol/mg of protein). Expression of the transgene had no significant effect on systolic blood pressure in basal conditions, since it was 123.1 ± 2.2 and 119.7 ± 5.6 mm Hg (mean ± S.E., n = 5) in NT and TG mice, respectively. Under basal conditions, there was no significant difference between TG and NT mice for either post-mortem HW/BW ratio or thickness of LVPW and IVSW in vivo (Fig. 2). There was no change either in basal cardiac performance (Table I), since there was no change in either end-diastolic dimensions or left ventricular systolic performance (fractional shortening, left ventricular ejection fraction, and cardiac output index). Isoproterenol significantly increased HW/BW as well as the thickness of both IVSW and LVPW in NT mice (Fig. 2); in contrast, its effects on HW/BW and LVPW was significantly smaller in TG than in NT mice, and the treatment had no effect on IVSW in TG mice. Isoproterenol increased cardiac output and heart rate to the same extent in both NT and TG mice. There was no indication of treatment-induced cardiac dysfunction, since end-diastolic dimensions were unchanged in both groups of mice (Table I). To rule out the possibility that expression of the transgene could interfere with the presence of functionally coupled β-adrenergic receptors at the surface of cardiomyocytes, we tested the effects of isoproterenol on cAMP generation by plasma membranes prepared from cardiomyocytes from either NT or TG mice. For TG animals, the amounts of cAMP generated by cardiomyocyte membrane preparations (expressed as pmol/mg of protein/4 min) were 195 ± 22 and 301 ± 58 (mean ± S.E., n = 3) in either the absence or presence of 10–7m isoproterenol, respectively. For NT animals, the amounts of cAMP generated by the preparations were 163 ± 34 and 334 ± 101 pmol/mg of protein/4 min in either the absence or presence of isoproterenol 10–7m, respectively. These results indicated that 1) cardiomyocytes from TG mice contained in their plasma membrane β-adrenergic receptors that are functionally coupled to adenylyl cyclase and 2) that the amplitude of the adenylyl cyclase response in TG mice was similar to that in NT mice.Table IEchocardiographic variables in sham- and isoproterenol-treated miceExperimental groupNTTGShamISOShamISOBW (g)26.1 ± 0.425.9 ± 0.625.6 ± 0.525.2 ± 0.65LVIDd (mm)3.32 ± 0.173.1 ± 0.023.11 ± 0.153.17 ± 0.25LVIDs (mm)2.02 ± 0.171.39 ± 0.16ap < 0.05 versus sham group.2.03 ± 0.191.75 ± 0.30Heart rate (beats/min)569 ± 9.8717 ± 10ap < 0.05 versus sham group.609 ± 30.4688 ± 18.2ap < 0.05 versus sham group.Fractional shortening (%)38 ± 1.956 ± 3ap < 0.05 versus sham group.39 ± 3.743.1 ± 6ap < 0.05 versus sham group.Ejection fraction (%)56.9 ± 3.281.6 ± 2.2ap < 0.05 versus sham group.66.7 ± 2.280.4 ± 2.4ap < 0.05 versus sham group.Cardiac output index (ml/min/g)1.97 ± 0.122.93 ± 0.41ap < 0.05 versus sham group.2.1 ± 0.332.82 ± 0.47ap < 0.05 versus sham group.a p < 0.05 versus sham group. Open table in a new tab Additionally, we performed Northern blot analyses to test the effect of transgene expression on biochemical markers of LVH. Isoproterenol increased the abundance of the transcripts of the genes coding for the precursors of ANP and brain natriuretic peptide in NT mice but had no significant effects in TG mice (Fig. 3). To rule out the possibility that some of these differences might result from the retroactive inhibition of these genes by cGMP (independently of the effects of the transgene on LVH), we also measured the level of expression of additional genes (i.e. MCAD and M-CPT-I) (Fig. 4). Both genes code for enzymes catalyzing rate-limiting steps in fatty acid oxidation, and their expression is repressed in response to hypertrophic stimuli through reactivation of fetal transcriptional control mechanisms (25Sack M.N. Disch D.L. Rockman H.A. Kelly D.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6438-6443Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 26Depré C. Shipley G.L. Chen W. Han Q. Doenst T. Moore M.L.

We observed that isoproterenol decreased the abundance of MCAD and M-CPT-I mRNA transcripts in NT as well as in TG animals. However, the abundance of both transcripts was higher in TG than in NT animals, both under basal and stimulated conditions.Fig. 4Northern blot analyses of the mRNA of the MCAD and M-CPT-1 genes performed with total RNA from the hearts of TG mice and their NT littermates, treated with either saline (open bars) or isoproterenol (solid bars).

The latter maneuver increased HW/BW as well as the thickness of IVSW (but not that of LVPW) in NT mice but not in TG mice (Fig. 5). In contrast to isoproterenol (whose effect on of IVSW was only attenuated in TG mice), these effects of ACC on IVSW were completely abolished in TG mice. AAC increased cardiac output to the same extent in both NT and TG mice (Table II). As observed with isoproterenol-treated animals, there was no indication of treatment-induced cardiac dysfunction, since end-diastolic dimensions were unchanged in both groups of mice (Table II).Table IIEchocardiographic variables mice with either sham surgery or abdominal aortic constrictionExperimental groupNTTGShamAACShamAACBW (g)26.1 ± 0.625.7 ± 0.4527 ± 0.925.9 ± 0.4LVIDd (mm)2.98 ± 0.103.14 ± 0.132.94 ± 0.243.15 ± 0.19LVIDs (mm)1.72 ± 0.91.81 ± 0.131.59 ± 0.241.67 ± 0.14Heart rate (beats/min)574 ± 12617 ± 16.4613 ± 24.5578 ± 7.5Fractional shortening (%)40.6 ± 1.944.2 ± 2.842.4 ± 3.647.2 ± 2.2Ejection fraction (%)61.4 ± 3.365 ± 1.762.7 ± 767.2 ± 2.8Cardiac output index (ml/min/g)2.31 ± 0.162.79 ± 0.18ap < 0.05 versus sham group.1.99 ± 0.282.47 ± 0.15ap < 0.05 versus sham group.a p < 0.05 versus sham group. Open table in a new tab Finally, to test whether expression of the transgene could affect the hypertrophic phenotype at the cellular level, we measured cardiomyocytes isolated from either adult NT or TG mice (from either control or experimental hypertrophy groups). For these measurements, ACC was preferred to isoproterenol treatment, since the latter may possibly induce necrosis in small foci of cardiomyocytes and thus affect their size independently of its hypertrophic effects (27Benjamin I.J. Jalil J.E. Tan L.B. Cho K. Weber K.T. Clark W.A. Circ. Res. 1989; 65: 657-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). In NT animals, AAC increased cardiomyocyte width by 25% in NT mice but only by 8% in TG mice (Fig. 6). Differences of similar magnitude were observed for measurements of cardiomyocyte surface area. Expression of the α-myosin heavy chain gene (whose promoter has been used to drive expression of the transgene in the current study) is activated in cardiac ventricles shortly after birth and rises steadily in developing mice until reaching a plateau at around 8 weeks of age (28Ng W.A. Grupp I.L. Subramaniam A. Robbins J. Circ. Res. 1991; 68: 1742-1750Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 29Subramaniam A. Jones W.K. Gulick J. Wert S. Neumann J. Robbins J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24613-24620Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Consequently, one of the first conclusions from our data is that continuous overexpression of constitutively active guanylate cyclase within ventricular cardiomyocytes from birth to adulthood leads to increased production of cGMP within adult cardiomyocytes but has no obvious effect on either the thickness of ventricular walls, cardiomyocyte size, systolic blood pressure, or cardiac performance under basal conditions. This is in contrast with recent findings using cardiomyocyte-restricted inactivation of NPRA, where HW/BW and cardiomyocyte size are increased in the absence of any other experimental maneuver (4Holtwick R. van Eickels M. Skryabin B.V. Baba H.A. Bubikat A. Begrow F. Scheider M.D. Garbers D.L. Kuhn M. J. Clin. Invest. 2003; 111: 1399-1407Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). Of note, others had also reported that the LV mass of TG that overproduce ANP was lower that that of NT control mice (30Klinger J.R. Petit R.D. Curtin L.A. Warburton R.R. Wrenn D.S. Steinhelper M.E. Field L.J. Hill N.S. J. Appl. Physiol. 1993; 75: 198-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). However, the latter study used a liver-specific promoter that led to significant increases plasma levels of ANP. It is therefore likely that reduced cardiac mass in that model resulted from peripheral effects of ANP (including renal sodium excretion, adrenal aldosterone secretion, and vascular smooth muscle tone), whereas local cGMP in cardiomyocytes (as in our model) has less effect on cardiac mass under basal conditions. In isoproterenol-induced LVH, our data show that expression of the transgene 1) attenuated the effects of the treatment on either HW/BW or ventricular wall thickness; 2) blocked the effects of the treatment on ventricular ANP and brain natriuretic peptide (two well known markers of LVH); and 3) increased the expression of two genes known to be repressed during hypertrophy by so-called “fetal” transcriptional control mechanisms, both in basal and stimulated conditions. These effects could not be explained on the basis of the eventual disappearance of functionally coupled β-adrenergic receptors in the plasma membrane of cardiomyocytes of TG mice and thus must involve mechanisms that are downstream of the receptors. Although isoproterenol is a well known inducer of experimental hypertrophy, its effects are much stronger and more acute than what would normally be observed in pathophysiological situations, since cardiac mass increases by ∼25% in a matter of days. For this reason, we tested whether chronic increases in cardiomyocyte cGMP could also diminish the hypertrophic effects of AAC, a model where LVH is less pronounced and where it develops over the course of weeks rather than days. We found that expression of the transgene blocked the effects of ACC on HW/BW and ventricular wall thickness despite the fact that there was no evidence that it could affect cardiac function in the context of a chronic overload. Finally, we demonstrated that the antihypertrophic effect of elevated cardiomyocyte cGMP was evident at the cellular level, since it greatly attenuated the effects of AAC on the size (width and surface area) of cardiomyocytes. Other reports had shown that inactivation of Npr1 (that codes for the NPRA receptor) could enhance cardiac hypertrophy in a pressure-independent manner (3Knowles J.W. Esposito J.W. Mao L.

Our results extend these previous reports by showing that the reverse is also true and that cGMP is the likely mediator of such antihypertrophic effects. Until now, TG or knockout animals have been used mostly to study and validate the effects of agents or pathways that induce LVH (for reviews, see Refs. 2Molkentin J.D. Dorn G.W.I. Annu. Rev.

However, it might be equally important to study the effects of endogenous cardiac molecules that confer protection against hypertrophy. Two such examples are the protein S100β (32Tsoporis J.N.

Our data suggest that intracellular cGMP may constitute another candidate among such negative intrinsic modulators and provide evidence that it prevents LVH in vivo via a direct local action on cardiomyocytes. Moreover, some in vitro preliminary experiments in neonatal cardiomyocytes have suggested that the antihypertrophic effects of cGMP might be mediated via cGMP-dependent protein kinase I (14Wollert K.C.

TGF-beta, a multifunctional cytokine, is a potent negative regulator of mucosal inflammation in the intestine. The aim of the present study is to determine possible cross-talk between IL-6 and TGF-beta signaling pathways. Model intestinal epithelial cell lines, Caco2-BBE were used. We show that TGF-beta receptor Type II is predominantly present in the basolateral membrane of intestinal epithelial cells. TGF-beta1 induces a time-dependent phosphorylation of Smad2 and co-immunoprecipitation of SMAD-2 with Smad-4 and its subsequently translocation to the nucleus. We show that pretreatment of cells with TGF-beta1 is associated with a down-regulation of IL-6 induced tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT3 and suppression of ICAM-1 expression. Furthermore, TGF-beta1 pretreatment resulted in a significant inhibition of IL-6 induced ICAM-1 promoter activity. TGF-beta mediated inhibition of IL-6 induced ICAM-1 expression was reversed by transfection with dominant negative Smad2 constructs. In conclusion, we show that: 1) TGF-beta receptor Type II is predominantly located on basolateral membrane and receptor stimulation activates Smad pathway; 2) TGF-beta1 down-regulates IL-6-induced tyrosine phoshorylation of STAT1 and STAT3 and ICAM-1 expression; and 3) Smad2 is required for the down-regulation of IL-6 signaling by TGF-beta. Collectively, our data demonstrate a cross-talk between TGF-beta and IL-6, and TGF-beta may play a role in the negative regulation of IL-6 signaling in intestinal epithelial cells."

Via transmission electron microscopy, we found that P2X1 mediates fast, reversible platelet shape change, secretory granule centralization, and pseudopodia formation. In washed human platelets, the stable P2X1 agonist α,β-methylene ATP (α,β-meATP) causes rapid, transient (2–5 s), and dose-dependent myosin light chain (MLC) phosphorylation, requiring extracellular Ca2+.

Hence, the P2X1-ERK2-MLC axis contributes to collagen-induced platelet activation by enhancing platelet degranulation. P2X receptors are oligomeric non-selective ATP-gated cation channels expressed in many excitable and non-excitable cells, where they mediate a variety of physiological processes including central and peripheral neurotransmission, smooth muscle contraction, and hormone secretion (1Ravelic V. Burnstock G. Pharmacol. Rev. 1998; 50: 413-492PubMed Google Scholar, 2North R.A. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 1013-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (2488) Google Scholar). Seven P2X receptor subtypes have been identified so far, but relatively little is known about the intracellular signaling pathways subserving their biological actions. The ATP-gated P2X1 receptor is a rapidly desensitizing, nonselective cation channel, mediating fast non-selective influx of Na+ and Ca2+ ions across the cell membrane, resulting in cell depolarization (3Evans R.J. Lewis C. Buell G. Valera S. North R.A. Surprenant A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 48: 178-183PubMed Google Scholar). The direct influx of extracellular Ca2+ through this channel rapidly increases intracellular levels and regulates cellular processes as diverse as muscle contraction, fertilization, cell proliferation, vesicular function, and apoptosis (4Burnstock G. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2002; 22: 364-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). As Ca2+ enters the cytosol, it interacts with calmodulin (CaM). 1The abbreviations used are: CaMcalmodulinERKextracellular signal-regulated kinaseMAPmitogen-activated proteinMAPKMAP kinasePKCprotein kinase CPRPplatelet-rich plasmaPLCphospholipase Cα,β-meATPα,β-methylene ATPGPVIglycoprotein VI. Upon Ca2+ binding, CaM changes its conformation, induces dimerization and active site remodeling, and displaces the auto-inhibitory domains of many different target proteins (5Chin D. Means A.R.

In response to specific agonists, platelets undergo morphological alterations known as shape change, secrete the contents of their granules, and aggregate (6Mustard J.F. Kinlough-Rathbone R.L. Packham M.A. Gresele P. Page C. Fuster V. Vermylen J. Platelets in Thrombotic and Non-thrombotic Disorders. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK2002: 3-24Google Scholar). These processes require reorganization of the platelet cytoskeletal structure and therefore involve Ca2+/CaM-regulated pathways. Hence, phosphorylation of the myosin light chain (MLC) by the Ca2+/CaM-dependent MLC kinase is considered a key step in platelet activation (7Daniel J.L. Molish I.R. Rigmaiden M. Stewart G. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 9826-9831Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Siess W. Physiol. Rev. 1989; 69: 58-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar), indicating that platelet actomyosin is regulated similarly to that found in smooth muscle. Phosphorylation of the regulatory light chain subunit of myosin at serine 19 results in a marked increase of actin-activated myosin ATPase activity, leading to attachment of myosin to actin via cross-bridging (9Ikebe M. Ikebe R. Kamisoyama H. Reardon S. Schwonek J.P. Sanders II, C.R. Matsuura M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28173-28180Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These events result in the assembly of actin microfilaments, folding of the cell membrane, and a contractile wave centralizing the platelet secretory granules. Rho kinase is also implicated in the regulation of MLC phosphorylation (10Noda M. Yasuda-Fukazawa C. Moriishi K. Kato T. Okuda T. Kurokawa K. Takuwa Y. FEBS Lett. 1995; 367: 246-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 11Bauer M. Retzer M. Wilde J.I. Maschberger P. Essler M. Aepfelbacher M. Watson S.P. Siess W. Blood. 1999; 94: 1665-1672Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Activated by the small GTP-binding protein RhoA, Rho kinase phosphorylates the myosin-binding subunit of myosin phosphatase and inhibits its activity. Rho kinase also directly phosphorylates the myosin light chain, activating myosin in vitro, and induces smooth muscle contraction in the absence of Ca2+. Both the Rho/Rho kinase and Ca2+/CaM-regulated MLC kinase pathways mediate MLC phosphorylation independently of each other in human platelets (11Bauer M. Retzer M. Wilde J.I. Maschberger P. Essler M.

P2X1 is highly expressed in human platelets and megakaryocytes (13Vial C. Hechler B. Leon C. Cazenave J.P. Gachet C. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1997; 78: 1500-1504Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 14Sun B. Li J. Okahara K Kambayashi J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11544-11547Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar); because of the role of Ca2+/CaM in platelet MLC kinase activation, we have presently investigated the P2X1-mediated Ca2+ influx in relation to MLC phosphorylation and platelet shape change. We have previously shown that the P2X1-mediated Ca2+ influx triggers phosphorylation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK2), a reaction found to contribute to platelet activation and secretion induced by low concentrations of collagen (15Oury C. Toth-Zsamboki E. Thys C. Tytgat J. Vermylen J. Hoylaerts M.F. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2001; 86: 1264-1271Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 16Oury C. Toth-Zsamboki E. Vermylen J. Hoylaerts M.F. Blood. 2002; 100: 2499-2505Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). We therefore have also investigated the relation between MLC kinase and ERK2 activation during collagen-induced platelet activation, in relation to P2X1-mediated Ca2+ influx. Activation of platelets by collagen triggers immediate phospholipase Cγ2-dependent MLC phosphorylation in a Ca2+/CaM-regulated manner, an event instrumental in the early dense granule release. This degranulation is necessary to complete platelet aggregation via amplification pathways, activated by released ADP and ATP. We presently found that released ATP-triggered P2X1 activation results in Ca2+/CaM-dependent phosphorylation of ERK2, which in turn intensifies the ongoing activation of MLC kinase. Hence, our work uncovers a central link between ERK2 activation and MLC phosphorylation during collagen-induced platelet activation, secretion, and aggregation. Materials—The stable, specific P2X1 receptor agonist α,β-meATP, the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor antagonist 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate (2-APB), and the ectonucleotidase apyrase (grade I) were purchased from Sigma. The α,β-meATP was purified by high pressure liquid chromatography on a Adsorbosphere HS C18, 7-μm, 250 × 4.6-mm column (Alltech, Bad Segeberg, Germany) (15Oury C. Toth-Zsamboki E. Thys C. Tytgat J.

Blood. 2002; 100: 2499-2505Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Purified samples, lyophilized and adjusted to pH 7.0 with potassium phosphate buffer, were kept at –80 °C and were stable over the time interval studied. The Rho kinase inhibitor HA-1077, the calmodulin inhibitor W-7, the MLC kinase inhibitor ML-7, and the Src family kinase inhibitor PP1 were purchased from Calbiochem. The protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor GF109203-X and the MEK1/2 inhibitor U0126 were from BioMol Research Laboratories (Plymouth Meeting, MA). Collagen (collagen reagent Horm) was from Nycomed (Munich, Germany); the purified snake venom toxin, convulxin, was obtained through Dr. K. J. Clementson (Theodor Kocher Institute, University of Berne, Berne, Switzerland). Hirudin (lepirudin) was from Hoechst, Frankfurt, Germany. Preparation of Platelet-rich Plasma, Washed Platelets, and Shape Change Analyses—Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) was prepared from fresh blood, taken on acid citrate dextrose (93 mm sodium citrate, 7 mm citric acid, 0.14 mm dextrose, pH 6.5) as an anticoagulant, supplemented with 1 unit/ml apyrase (grade I), by double centrifugation for 15 min at 150 × g. PRP was diluted 3-fold with acid citrate dextrose containing 1 unit/ml apyrase, and platelets were pelleted at 800 × g for 10 min. Washed platelets were resuspended in Tyrode's buffer (137 mm NaCl, 12 mm NaHCO3, 2 mm KCl, 0.34 mm Na2HPO4, 1 mm MgCl2, 5.5 mm glucose, and 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.3) containing 2 units/ml apyrase at a density of 2.5–3.5 × 105 platelets/μl. High concentrations of apyrase were needed to fully recover P2X1 functionality in the final platelet suspension. Platelet shape change was detected as a decrease in light transmission in an ELVI 840 aggregometer with 5-fold amplification of the signal. CaCl2 (2 mm) was added prior to the recordings; aliquots of washed platelets were preincubated with the inhibitors as indicated for 1 min prior to the addition of the agonist. The ADP-induced platelet shape change was analyzed in the presence of 1.25 μg/ml of the αIIbβ3 antagonist tirofiban (Merck) to avoid platelet aggregation. In each case, at least three independent experiments were performed on different individuals. Platelet Aggregation and ATP Secretion Analyses—Light transmission during collagen- or convulxin-induced platelet aggregation was recorded in apyrase-treated washed platelets with a Chrono-Log Aggregometer. ATP secretion was monitored in washed platelets in parallel with platelet aggregation by adding firefly luciferase and luciferin and comparing the luminescence generated by platelet ATP release with an ATP standard (Chrono-Lume, Kordia, The Netherlands). At least three independent experiments were performed on platelets from different individuals. Electron Microscopy—To preserve physiological Ca2+ levels, blood was taken on hirudin (20 μg/ml) and centrifuged at 150 × g for 15 min to yield PRP. Platelet numbers in PRP were diluted to 250,000/μl with autologous platelet-poor plasma. PRP (300 μl) was then stirred at 1000 rpm and stimulated with 2.5 μm α,β-meATP for 25 and 60 s and immediately fixed at 4 °C in 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 m phosphate buffer, at pH 7.2 overnight, after which centrifugation at 800 × g for 10 min yielded a condensed platelet pellet. After postfixation in 1% OsO4, 0.1 m phosphate buffer (pH 7.2), and dehydration in graded series of ethanol, these pellets were embedded in epoxy resin. Ultrathin sections were cut, stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate, and examined in a Zeiss FM 10 electron microscope (Oberkochen, Germany). Western Blot Detection of Myosin Light Chain and ERK2 Phosphorylation—Aliquots of washed platelets (300 μl) were incubated in an aggregometer cuvette with the agonists under stirring at 37 °C. Platelet activation was stopped by adding 100 μl of 4× concentrated SDS sample buffer at different time points, as indicated. Samples were boiled for 5 min and loaded on a 12% SDS-PAGE gel. After electrophoretic transferal of the proteins to nitrocellulose, membranes were blocked in Tris-buffered saline-Tween-milk buffer and incubated overnight with the appropriate primary antibodies: anti-phospho-MLC antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) or the monoclonal anti-phospho-p44/42 MAP antibody (New England Biolabs). After adding horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies, the immunoreactive bands were visualized by ECL (Amersham Biosciences). For detection of total proteins, membranes were stripped and reprobed with anti-MLC and p44/42 antibodies. At least three independent platelet extracts from different individuals were analyzed. P2X1 Stimulation Leads to Myosin Light Chain Phosphorylation—The stable P2X1-specific agonist α,β-meATP causes a fast and dose-dependent, but reversible, platelet shape change (17Rolf M.G. Brearley C.A. Mahaut-Smith M.P. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2001; 85: 303-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 18Rolf M.G. Mahaut-Smith M.P. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2002; 88: 495-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Analysis by transmission electron microscopy of this transient platelet shape change (Fig. 1, a–c) shows extremely rapid pseudopodia formation but also illustrates in some platelets a fast and reversible centralization of secretory granules, in addition to some platelet sphering. These findings indicate that the α,β-meATP-mediated Ca2+ influx suffices to cause functionally relevant morphological changes in platelets, without inducing aggregation or secretion itself. When measured in apyrase-treated washed platelets, α,β-meATP also caused a rapid, transient, and dose-dependent MLC phosphorylation (Fig. 1, lower right panel). MLC phosphorylation was observed as early as 2 s and paralleled the actual platelet shape change response; it was over 30 s after agonist application, i.e. coinciding with the reversibility of the platelet shape change. With increasing concentrations of α,β-meATP, the degree of MLC phosphorylation paralleled the intensity of the platelet shape change (not shown). As was the case for the P2X1-dependent α,β-meATP-induced shape change, no MLC phosphorylation occurred in the absence of added extracellular CaCl2, and it dropped to very low levels when apyrase was omitted from the platelet suspension (not shown), leading to P2X1 desensitization. The inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor inhibitor, 2-APB (100 μm), did not affect the P2X1-induced platelet shape change and MLC phosphorylation (not shown), compatible with an event that relies on the influx of Ca2+ exclusively, without mobilizing calcium from intracellular stores. In contrast, the ADP-induced MLC phosphorylation and shape change, dependent on P2Y1-mediated Ca2+-mobilization, were not inhibited when extracellular Ca2+ was omitted, although manifestation of full shape change and MLC phosphorylation also required apyrase to protect P2Y1 from desensitization (not shown). In agreement with its behavior as a (non-selective) P2 receptor antagonist, suramin abrogated the α,β-meATP-induced shape change and MLC phosphorylation (not shown). Mechanism of P2X1-mediated MLC Phosphorylation and Platelet Shape Change—Phosphorylation of the MLC can be dichotomously regulated by the Ca2+ calmodulin-regulated MLC kinase and by Rho kinase (11Bauer M. Retzer M. Wilde J.I. Maschberger P. Essler M. Aepfelbacher M. Watson S.P. Siess W. Blood. 1999; 94: 1665-1672Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); these two pathways can be activated independently of each other, depending on the type and concentration of the platelet agonist. We have therefore investigated the contribution of both kinases to the P2X1-mediated MLC phosphorylation by studying α,β-meATP-induced phosphorylation and platelet shape change in the presence of the specific calmodulin inhibitor W-7 or the Rho kinase inhibitor HA-1077. Fig. 2a shows that the α,β-meATP-induced platelet shape change was not affected by the presence of HA-1077 (20 μm); in contrast, the reversible second phase of the ADP-induced platelet shape change was detectably and repeatedly reduced at this concentration of HA-1077. Correspondingly, HA-1077 hardly affected the α,β-meATP-induced MLC phosphorylation, but strongly reduced the ADP-induced MLC phosphorylation, without abolishing it (Fig. 2a). On the other hand, the α,β-meATP-induced shape change was dose-dependently and completely inhibited by W-7 at 50 μm, whereas the ADP-induced platelet shape change could not be neutralized entirely at 100 μm (Fig. 2b). Correspondingly, the α,β-meATP-induced MLC phosphorylation was eliminated by 50 μm W-7, whereas this concentration only partially inhibited the ADP-induced MLC phosphorylation (Fig. 2b). The α,β-meATP-induced shape change was also inhibited by the MLC kinase inhibitor ML-7 at 30 μm, whereas ML-7 had an effect on the ADP-induced shape change, comparable with that of W-7. These experiments confirm that platelet shape change brought about by P2X1-mediated Ca2+ influx does not involve Rho kinase but relies on rapid and Ca2+/CaM-dependent MLC kinase-triggered MLC phosphorylation, responsible for rearranging myosin and linked morphological changes during the transient platelet shape change reaction. Ca2+/CaM Plays a Central Role in Collagen-induced Platelet Activation—In view of the role that the P2X1-mediated ERK2 phosphorylation plays in platelet activation by low doses of collagen (16Oury C. Toth-Zsamboki E. Vermylen J. Hoylaerts M.F. Blood. 2002; 100: 2499-2505Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), we have analyzed whether the P2X1-mediated Ca2+/CaM activation would be involved in this process. We therefore have reanalyzed the collagen-induced platelet aggregation in the presence of W-7. Fig. 3a shows that at 1 (and 2, not shown) μg/ml collagen, platelet shape change and aggregation were completely inhibited by W-7, in agreement with older findings (19Nishikawa M. Tanaka T. Hidaka H. Nature. 1980; 287: 863-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 20Nishikawa M. Hidaka H. J. Clin. Invest. 1982; 69: 1348-1355Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Parallel recordings of ATP secretion indicated complete inhibition of degranulation by W-7 (Fig. 3b). Likewise, strong inhibition of aggregation, shape change, and ATP secretion was achieved with ML-7. In agreement with our previous findings (16Oury C. Toth-Zsamboki E. Vermylen J. Hoylaerts M.F. Blood. 2002; 100: 2499-2505Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), the PKC inhibitor GF109203X also abrogated these events (Fig. 3). The fact that the Src family kinase inhibitor PP1 equally prevented platelet aggregation and ATP secretion almost entirely, confirmed that the collagen-induced platelet activation was the result of GPVI-mediated platelet activation. Indeed, PP1 is a potent inhibitor of Fyn, a Src family kinase involved in early steps of GPVI signaling (21Hanke J.H. Gardner J.P. Dow R.L. Changelian P.S. Brissette W.H. Weringer E.J. Pollok B.A. Connelly P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 695-701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1788) Google Scholar, 22Briddon S.J. Watson S.P. Biochem. J. 1999; 338: 203-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Accordingly, parallel experiments using the GPVI-selective agonist convulxin, yielded similar results (not shown). These findings therefore imply that both PKC and Ca2+/CaM-dependent MLC kinase activation are instrumental in the early platelet dense granule release induced by collagen. During platelet activation by 1 μg/ml collagen, the phosphorylation of ERK2 depends on ATP-triggered Ca2+ influx via P2X1 (16Oury C. Toth-Zsamboki E. Vermylen J. Hoylaerts M.F. Blood. 2002; 100: 2499-2505Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). We presently found that the α,β-meATP-induced ERK2 phosphorylation was fully inhibited by W-7 (Fig. 4a), compatible with Ca2+/CaM-dependent activation of ERK2. We therefore expected that, during the collagen-induced platelet aggregation, W-7, by abrogating both platelet degranulation and the ATP-mediated P2X1-dependent activation, would prevent ERK2 phosphorylation. Fig. 4b confirms that W-7 largely prevents the low dose (1 μg/ml) collagen-induced phosphorylation of ERK2. The inhibition by W-7 of ERK2 phosphorylation induced by higher doses of collagen (≥2 μg/ml), which is independent of P2X1, however, suggested the existence of additional links between Ca2+/CaM and ERK2 (see below). Similar results were found for the convulxin-induced ERK2 phosphorylation (not shown). However, the collagen-induced ERK2 phosphorylation was entirely eliminated in the presence of PP1, compatible with an event requiring GPVI-mediated Fyn and Lyn phosphorylation and subsequent phospholipase Cγ2 activation. These experiments, at a low dose of collagen, confirmed that when the early secretion of ATP was abrogated, ERK2 phosphorylation was absent. P2X1-mediated ERK2 Activation Reinforces MLC Kinase Activation—We have previously shown that desensitization of P2X1 by pretreating the platelets with α,β-meATP inhibits low dose collagen-induced secretion, aggregation, and related ERK2 phosphorylation (15Oury C. Toth-Zsamboki E. Thys C. Tytgat J. Vermylen J. Hoylaerts M.F. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2001; 86: 1264-1271Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Fig. 5a shows that the collagen-induced MLC phosphorylation is a slow process at low concentrations of this agonist but speeds up at higher concentrations. ML-7 and W-7 abolish MLC phosphorylation elicited by collagen, supportive of a role for Ca2+/CaM and MLC kinase in this event (Fig. 5b). Interestingly, at a low dose of collagen (1 μg/ml), MLC phosphorylation can also partially be inhibited by U0126, at a concentration that prevents ERK2 activation. This finding uncovers a role for ERK2 in the activation of MLC kinase. In agreement with a role for P2X1 in this process, MLC phosphorylation was also strongly reduced by prior P2X1 desensitization using α,β-meATP (Fig. 5c). Similarly to our previous findings on collagen-induced aggregation, at higher collagen concentrations (2 μg/ml), neither α,β-meATP nor U0126 had any effect on the level of MLC phophorylation. These data point to a role for P2X1-ERK2-mediated MLC phosphorylation in platelet secretion and aggregation, elicited by low concentrations of collagen. The use of transgenic (23Oury C. Kuijpers M.J. Toth-Zsamboki E. Bonnefoy A. Danloy S. Vreys I. Feijge M.A. De Vos R. Vermylen J. Heemskerk J.W. Hoylaerts M.F. Blood. 2003; 101: 3969-3976Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) and knock-out (24Hechler B. Lenain N. Marchese P. Vial C. Heim V. Freund M. Cazenave J.-P. Cattaneo M. Ruggeri Z. Evans R. Gachet C. J. Exp. Med. 2003; 198: 661-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar) mouse models recently established a contribution for P2X1 to platelet activation induced by low concentrations of collagen. These models have further demonstrated a role for platelet P2X1 in thrombosis. Generally, platelet shape change is considered to be the first measurable response to platelet activation, involving Rho kinase and MLC kinase (11Bauer M. Retzer M. Wilde J.I. Maschberger P. Essler M. Aepfelbacher M. Watson S.P. Siess W. Blood. 1999; 94: 1665-1672Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is characterized by spheration, contraction of the cell, cytoskeletal rearrangement, folding and ruffling of the surface membrane, and finally, formation of pseudopodia (25Allen R.D. Zacharski L.R. Widirstky S.T. Rosenstein R. Zaitlin L.M. Burgess D.R. J. Cell Biol. 1979; 83: 126-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). We therefore have first investigated how P2X1-mediated Ca2+ influx would activate these enzymes, and secondly, how these enzymes contribute to P2X1-dependent pathways of platelet activation. Collagen leads to rapid platelet activation, accompanied by protein kinase C-dependent release of nucleotides and subsequent P2 receptor activation. Released ATP-mediated P2X1 activation leads to phosphorylation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase ERK2, thus enhancing platelet activation and granule release, in a poorly understood manner. We have now shown that P2X1-activated ERK2 is functionally coupled to myosin light chain kinase activation and MLC phosphorylation, important in platelet shape change and degranulation, reinforcing downstream platelet activation. The fast reversibility of the P2X1-mediated platelet shape change has been reported before (16Oury C. Toth-Zsamboki E. Vermylen J. Hoylaerts M.F. Blood. 2002; 100: 2499-2505Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 17Rolf M.G. Brearley C.A. Mahaut-Smith M.P. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2001; 85: 303-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), but transmission electron microscopy presently showed that platelet shape change is accompanied by secretory granule centralization. The specific, non-hydrolysable P2X1 agonist, α,β-meATP, caused rapid, transient, and dose-dependent MLC phosphorylation in washed human platelets. These results are consistent with previous reports using saponin-permeabilized platelets and correlating phosphorylation of myosin and its interaction with microfilaments responsible for contracting the shell and moving the granules to the center of the platelet (26Fox E.B. Phillips D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 4120-4126Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Stark F. Golla R. Nachmias V.T. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 112: 903-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Rho kinase was not involved in the P2X1-induced shape change and MLC phosphorylation, but the Ca2+/CaM inhibitor W-7 and the MLC kinase inhibitor ML-7 dose-dependently inhibited these phenomena, in agreement with a direct link between Ca2+ influx and MLC phosphorylation. In general, Ca2+/CaM affects cellular growth and stress responses through ERKs. A number of proximal signaling pathways, including G-protein βγ subunits, PKC, as well as an increase in intracellular calcium levels, may converge on the ERK signaling cascade. In vascular smooth muscle, ERK1/2 activation in response to thrombin, angiotensin, or ATP involves both Ca2+/CaM and PKC-dependent mechanisms (28Abraham S.T. Benscoter H.A. Schworer C.M. Singer H.A. Circ. Res. 1997; 81: 575-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 29Booz G.W Dostal D.E. Singer H.A. Baker K.M. Am. J.

Chem. 1998; 273: 1711-1718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). In platelets, we presently found that the P2X1-mediated ERK2 phosphorylation depends on Ca2+/CaM. However, ERK2 is not involved in the rapid P2X1-mediated platelet shape change since inhibition of ERK2 phosphorylation by U0126 has no impact on α,β-meATP-induced shape change (not shown). Early studies have indicated that Ca2+/CaM-dependent MLC phosphorylation plays an important role in the platelet release reaction (19Nishikawa M. Tanaka T. Hidaka H. Nature. 1980; 287: 863-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). In view of our earlier finding that P2X1 contributes to the collagen-induced platelet secretion via the ERK2 pathway, we have studied in more detail the existence of cross-talk between MLC phosphorylation and ERK2 activation. The direct analysis of a role for P2X1-dependent Ca2+/CaM regulation appeared to be complicated because not only was the collagen-induced platelet aggregation fully inhibited by W-7 and by ML-7, in agreement with earlier findings, but also the early degranulation (and shape change) was abrogated by these inhibitors. Yet those findings pointed to the central role of myosin light chain phosphorylation, even in the early minor degranulation, in addition to a role for PKC. Both integrin α2β1 and GPVI are recognized as major platelet receptors underlying interactions with collagen (31Siljander P.R.-M. Farndale R.W. Gresele, P. Page C. Fuster V. Vermylen J. Platelets in Thrombotic and Non-thrombotic Disorders. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK2002: 158-179Google Scholar, 32Watson S.P. Asazuma N. Atkinson B. Berlanga O. Best D. Bobe R. Jarvis G. Marshall S. Snell D. Stafford M. Tulasne D. Wilde J. Wonerow P. Frampton J. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2001; 86: 276-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). In its high affinity state, α2β1 has been proposed to be the major player in adhesion to collagen. GPVI, non-covalently associated with the FcRγ chain, serves as the signal-transducing receptor in human platelets. Tyrosine phosphorylation of the FcRγ chain immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif region by the Src family kinases Lyn and Fyn activates Syk and LAT, initiating enzyme cascades involving phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and phospholipase Cγ2. Upon its phosphorylation, PLCγ2 migrates to the plasma membrane, where it generates inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and 1,2-diacylglycerol. Finally, these events result in intracellular calcium mobilization, shape change, activation of PKC, and inside-out signaling, resulting in expression of αIIbβ3-binding sites. We have presently confirmed that the P2X1-mediated amplification reactions during the collagen-induced activation of platelets are the result of GPVI-mediated signaling, leading to early degranulation, in turn responsible for further nucleotide-dependent platelet activation. Indeed, the early degranulation and subsequent platelet aggregation were completely abrogated by the Src family kinase inhibitor PP1, as well as by W-7 and ML-7, illustrating that they depend on PLCγ2 activation, subsequent Ca2+-mobilization, PKC activation, and Ca2+/CaM-dependent MLC phosphorylation. Released ADP then triggers further Ca2+-mobilization after activation of PLCβ. We presently found that the weak MLC phosphorylation accompanying early collagen-induced platelet degranulation is up-regulated by ERK2. The finding that desensitization of P2X1 either by prior α,β-meATP or by U0126 both strongly reduce the amplification of MLC phosphorylation provides a mechanistic basis for the role of P2X1 in activating both enzymes, as illustrated in Fig. 6. Thus, released ATP contributes via P2X1 to the collagen-mediated activation of platelets because it amplifies MLC phosphorylation. ERK2, activated by the P2X1-mediated Ca2+ influx, by phosphorylating MLC kinase would accelerate MLC phosphorylation, and ultimately, platelet activation. Accordingly, in other cell types, MLC kinase activity was shown to be regulated by MAP kinase-dependent phosphorylation in functional assays; for example, the functional interaction between MAP kinase and MLC kinase has been implicated in carcinoma cell migration (33Klemke R.L. Cai S. Giannini A.L. Gallagher P.J. de Lanerolle P. Cheresh D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 481-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (1102) Google Scholar). Several molecular interactions depend on calmodulin; therefore, the pharmacological action of W-7 on ERK2 phosphorylation by α,β-meATP does not necessarily rely on a single mechanism, explaining the dashed arrow in Fig. 6. Indeed, we have shown before that ERK2 phosphorylation is also a PKC-dependent process (16Oury C. Toth-Zsamboki E. Vermylen J. Hoylaerts M.F. Blood. 2002; 100: 2499-2505Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Fig. 6 highlights the role in platelets of secreted ATP. It is evident that released ADP will also stimulate MLC phosphorylation, following Ca2+-mobilization, in agreement with the role of MLC kinase in the ADP-induced platelet shape change (Fig. 2). In conclusion, the present work shows that P2X1 activation by ATP leads to both activation of MLC kinase and of ERK2 and that the highly regulated interaction between both enzymes contributes to collagen-mediated platelet aggregation."

In the current study, the Met adaptor protein Ran-binding protein M (RanBPM) was identified as a Mirk-binding protein by yeast two-hybrid analysis. The Mirk-RanBPM association was confirmed by glutathione S-transferase pull-down assays, co-immunoprecipitation studies, and in vivo cross-linking. Met plays an important role in tumor cell invasion and cell migration. RanBPM has been reported to bind to the tyrosine kinase domain of the hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) receptor Met, enhance Met downstream signaling, and enhance HGF-induced A704 kidney carcinoma cell invasion (Wang, D., Li, Z., Messing, E. M., and Wu, G. (2002) J. Biol. Chem. 277, 36216-36222). We made a stable Mirk-inducible subline from nontransformed Mv1Lu lung epithelial cells and now demonstrate that induction of Mirk inhibited the migration of these cells in wounding experiments and inhibited their invasion through polycarbonate Transwell filters. Furthermore the ability of Mirk to inhibit Mv1Lu cell migration was attenuated when cells were exposed to HGF or to elevated levels of transiently expressed RanBPM. RanBPM inhibited the kinase activity of Mirk/Dyrk1B and Dyrk1A. In addition, RanBPM and HGF inhibited the function of Mirk as a transcriptional coactivator. Our findings suggest that Mirk plays a role in modulating cell migration through opposing the action of the Met signaling cascade adaptor protein RanBPM.

Mirk is highly expressed in normal skeletal muscle cells, testes, and some carcinomas but is only expressed at low levels in other tissues (1.Lee K. Deng X. Friedman E. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 3631-3637PubMed Google Scholar). Depletion of endogenous Mirk in skeletal myoblasts by RNA interference prevents myoblast fusion and the induction of various muscle-specific contractile proteins, demonstrating a function for Mirk in muscle cell development (6.Deng X.

Mirk functions as a transcriptional coactivator that is activated by co-expressed MKK3 (7.Lim S. Jin K. Friedman E. J. Biol.

The transcriptional coactivator function of Mirk/Dyrk1B was discovered by using a yeast two-hybrid screen to identify the strong binding of Mirk to DCoH, the dimerization cofactor of the transcription factor hepatocyte nuclear factor 1α (7.Lim S.

In the current study we have identified a second binding partner of Mirk, RanBPM, and have investigated its effects on the activity of Mirk. RanBPM is a nuclear Ran-binding protein (13.Nishitani H. Hirose E. Uchimura Y. Nakamura M. Umeda M. Nishii K. Mori N. Nishimoto T. Gene (Amst.). 2001; 272: 25-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) that regulates transcriptional activity of the androgen receptor and the glucocorticoid receptor (14.Rao M.A. Cheng H.

However, cytoplasmic RanBPM has been found to function as an adaptor for the Met tyrosine kinase domain (15.Wang D. Li Z. Messing E.M. Wu G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36216-36222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) receptor Met regulates invasive growth, a process that includes cell motility, cell growth, and the formation of tubular structures during morphogenesis (16.Comoglio P. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: E161-E162Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). There is much evidence that Met functions in tumor progression. Amplification of the met gene or enhanced Met expression have been found in many human cancers, while activating mutations in Met have been identified in human carcinoma metastases (17.Lorenzato A. Olivero M. Patane S. Rosso E. Oliaro A. Comoglio P. Di Renzo M. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 7025-7030PubMed Google Scholar). The presence of such activating mutations enabled the met gene to confer a motile-invasive phenotype in transfected carcinoma cells (17.Lorenzato A. Olivero M. Patane S. Rosso E. Oliaro A. Comoglio P. Di Renzo M. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 7025-7030PubMed Google Scholar). The Met receptor is unusual as it must synergize with other molecules to produce its biological outcomes. Met forms a selective complex with α6β4 (18.Trusolino L. Bertotti A. Comoglio P. Cell. 2001; 107: 643-654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar), an integrin already correlated with invasive growth in several studies. The Met-α6β4 complex was found to be essential for Met to mediate neoplastic invasive growth. Following Met activation by HGF, the β4 integrin is tyrosine phosphorylated and recruits the adaptor Shc, amplifying the HGF signal (18.Trusolino L. Bertotti A. Comoglio P. Cell. 2001; 107: 643-654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). Other proteins function as Met adaptors, including CD44. Splice variants of CD44 have been identified as metastasis-associated proteins (19.Ponta H. Wainwright D. Herrlich P. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1998; 30: 299-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). A CD44 isoform containing variant exon v6 sequences was found to be strictly required for Met activation by HGF in carcinoma cell lines and in primary cultured keratinocytes (20.Orian-Rousseau V. Chen L. Sleeman J. Herrlich P. Ponta1 H. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 3074-3086Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). CD44, Met, and HGF formed a multimeric complex, enabling activated Met to utilize the cytoplasmic tail of CD44 for signal transfer. Both of these examples demonstrate the essential role of other signaling systems for Met function. Another Met adaptor, RanBPM, has been shown to stimulate the Ras/Erk/SRE signaling pathway by recruiting Sos, leading to increased Met-related migration activity (15.Wang D. Li Z. Messing E.M. Wu G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36216-36222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). In the current study we characterize the effects of RanBPM on Mirk activity and demonstrate a new function for Mirk, inhibition of epithelial cell migration in an HGF- and RanBPM-modulated manner. Materials—Rabbit polyclonal antibody to a unique sequence at the C terminus of Mirk was raised as described previously (1.Lee K. Deng X. Friedman E. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 3631-3637PubMed Google Scholar). Rabbit polyclonal antibody to full-length recombinant RanBPM protein was raised and purified by absorption to protein A. Antibodies to the FLAG epitope and the HA epitope were purchased from Sigma. Recombinant purified GST-p38 and myelin basic protein (MBP) were from Upstate Biotechnology. Polyvinylidene difluoride transfer membrane (Immobilon-P) was purchased from Millipore. PLUS reagent and LipofectAMINE were from Invitrogen, all radioactive materials were purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences, and ECL reagents were from Amersham Biosciences. All other reagents were from Sigma. Yeast Two-hybrid Screening—The bait construct was prepared by subcloning wild-type full-length Mirk cDNA into the pGBKT7 vector. Analysis of induction of β-galactosidase activity confirmed that Mirk had no transcriptional activity by itself. The yeast host strain AH109 contains three different reporter genes that are tightly controlled by UAS, thus requiring GAL4 binding for expression of the reporter gene. AH109 cells were simultaneously co-transformed with pGBKT7-Mirk and the pACT2 muscle cDNA library (Clontech) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The transformants were plated on His-/Leu-/Trp- medium including 25 mm 3-amino-1,2,4-triasol to screen for expression of His3 and incubated at 30 °C for 7-10 days. Subsequently His+ colonies were replated on adenine-/His-/Leu-/Trp-/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-α-d-galactopyranoside (X-α-gal) medium, and blue colonies were selected as positive candidates. The plasmids from candidate colonies were harvested by the smash and grab method. Briefly, cells were grown in 5 ml of selective medium overnight and collected by pelleting. The pellets were resuspended in 200 μl of lysis buffer and then incubated at 37 °C for 30-90 min after brief vortexing. Lysis buffer consisted of a mixture of 5 ml of SCE (1 m sorbitol, 0.1 m sodium citrate, pH 7.6, 0.06 m EDTA), 60 μl of 100T zymolase (10 mg/ml), and 10 μl of β-mercaptoethanol. Following addition of 400 μlof0.2 n NaOH, 1% SDS solution, the lysates were incubated on ice for 5 min and pelleted in a microcentrifuge, and the supernatants were decanted into fresh tubes and then reclarified by repeated pelleting. The plasmid DNA of each candidate was precipitated and then transformed into Escherichia coli DH5α using electroporation. The sequences of candidate DNAs were analyzed by using an automatic DNA sequencer (Model 3700 BC 1.1.0.0, ABI Prism). Plasmid Construction—The full-length RanBPM expression vector, pcDEBΔ-T7-His-BPM90 and the empty vector pcDEBΔ were provided by Dr. T. Nishimoto, Kyushu University. The longest RanBPM library clone isolated in the yeast two-hybrid assay contained a 2.7-kb fragment that coded for amino acids 118-729 of RanBMP90 and additional 3′-untranslated sequences. A FLAG epitope-tagged RanBPM construct was generated. Plasmids pcDNA3.1 (Mirk) and pcDNA3.1 (kinase-inactive YF-Mirk) had been generated previously (1.Lee K. Deng X. Friedman E. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 3631-3637PubMed Google Scholar). The deletion mutants ΔN (Δ1-110), ΔN2 (Δ1-233), ΔKC (Δ237-437), ΔC (Δ436-629), ΔC7 (aa1-519), ΔP (Δaa440-480), ΔC6 (Δaa464-480), and ΔC5 (aa1-604) were generated with selected restriction enzymes, while the leucine zipper quadruple mutant L226V/L233V/L240V/L247V was generated by site-directed mutagenesis using the Gene-Editor system (Promega). The (β-28)3-Luciferase plasmid (encoding three tandem repeats of the β-fibrinogen HNF1 binding domain in front of a TATA box promoter and a luciferase reporter gene), the expression plasmid pBJ5-DCoH, and the expression plasmid pBJ5-HNF1 were the kind gifts of Dr. G. Crabtree, Stanford. The plasmids pcDNA4-HA-Dyrk1A wild type and kinase-inactive pcDNA-HA-Dyrk1A-KR were the gifts of Dr. J. Mymryk (University of Western Ontario). The SRE-luciferase reporter plasmid was purchased from Clontech. Cell Culture—NIH3T3, 293T, and Mv1Lu mink lung epithelial cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 7% fetal bovine serum, modified and supplemented as described previously (21.Hafez M. Hsu S. Yan Z. Winawer S. Friedman E. Cell Growth Differ. 1992; 3: 753-762PubMed Google Scholar). The Mirk-inducible Mv1Lu C9 subline was isolated by stably transfecting cells with a pCMVLac1 repressor construct, selecting the hygromycin-resistant clone, and then stably transfecting Mirk in a pOPRSV1/MCS vector using G418 (LacSwitch II system, Stratagene). Migration Assays—Wound healing and cell migration assays were performed as detailed previously (22.Paciucci R. Vila M. Adell T. Diaz V. Tora M. Nakamura T. Real F. Am. J.

Briefly, after labeling with [3H]thymidine overnight, 3 × 105 cells were plated per Transwell (8-μm porosity, 12-mm diameter) (Millipore) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum with 0.4 ml in the upper chamber and 0.5 ml in the lower chamber. The wells were washed and transferred into fresh 24-well plates, treated for 24 h with either 200 μm IPTG to induce Mirk or 10 ng/ml HGF while cells were allowed to migrate. The cells that had migrated through the Transwell to the plate were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline and dissolved in a 1% SDS, 1 m NaOH solution, and the [3H]thymidine released was measured in a scintillation counter. For certain experiments, C9 cells were transiently transfected with RanBPM or vector control DNA overnight before seeding into Transwells. For wound healing experiments, a wound in the shape of a ∼1 × 1-mm cross was made, using the edge of a piece of sterile film, in the center of confluent monolayers in 6-well tissue culture plates. Cells tested were Mirk-inducible C9 cells, vector-only Lac1 transfectants, and parental Mv1Lu cells. Then the medium was changed, and cells were treated with 200 μm IPTG, 10 ng/ml HGF, both agents, or neither for 48 h. The wounds were photographed at zero time and after 48 h. Immunodetection—Following treatment as indicated and washing with cold phosphate-buffered saline, cells were lysed in RIPA buffer (phosphate-buffered saline, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, and protease inhibitors: 20 μg/ml leupeptin, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 200 μm sodium orthovanadate, and 20 mm sodium fluoride). Lysates were pelleted in a microcentrifuge for 15 min to remove insoluble material. Depending upon the experiment, 10-50 μg of cell lysates were blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes after separation by SDS-PAGE. The blots were blocked in 5% milk in TBST (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20) for 1 h at room temperature and incubated for 1 h at room temperature with primary antibody in TBST plus 4% bovine serum albumin, and proteins were subsequently detected by enhanced chemiluminescence. All Mirk blots used affinity-purified polyclonal antibody directed to the Mirk unique C terminus. Band density in autoradiograms was measured using a Lacie Silverscanner and Silverscanner III software and analyzed by the IP LabGel program. Transient Transfections—293T cells were transiently transfected by adding a complex of LipofectAMINE (2-4 μl/μg of DNA) in serum-free medium for 3 h and then allowing expression in growth medium for 24-36 h. For reporter gene assays, cells were seeded the day before transfection at 0.9 × 105/well and allowed to grow overnight in 7% serum-containing medium. Cells were transfected by incubating with a complex of PLUS reagent (3 μl/μg of DNA) and LipofectAMINE (2 μl/μg of DNA) in serum-free medium for 18-24 h in a CO2 incubator. The amount of total DNA used was kept constant by addition of empty vector DNA, and luciferase activities were calibrated by co-transfected β-galactosidase activity to normalize for the transfection efficiency. These assays were carried out in triplicate, and the data shown are representative of three independent experiments. Co-immunoprecipitation of Mirk and RanBPM—Mirk and RanBPM expression plasmids were co-transfected into either 293T or MV1Lu cells and allowed to express for 48 h. After lysis in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.5% Nonidet P-40 with protease inhibitors, RanBPM was immunoprecipitated by adding antibodies to the FLAG epitope followed by rocking overnight at 4 °C. Then 20 μl of protein A- or protein G-agarose conjugates (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was added and incubated for an additional 2 h at 4 °C. The agarose beads in each tube were washed three times followed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. GST Pull-down Experiments—GST fusion proteins were prepared as described previously (23.Kim G.-Y.

Mirk and Mirk mutants were produced in vitro by a coupled transcription and translation system (Promega) using 1 μg of plasmid/reaction. Translation took place in the presence of 20 μCi of [35S]methionine. The labeled TnT proteins and the GST-RanBPM fusion were incubated together in binding buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0 with protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science Complete) and 1% Triton X-100) overnight at 4 °C, incubated with glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads for 3 h, and then washed six times in binding buffer before analysis by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Expression of Mirk in Sf21 Insect Cells—Mirk was subcloned into pBACPAK8 (Invitrogen), stable clones in Sf21 cells were selected, and expression was confirmed by Western blotting of cell lysates. The hexahistidine-Mirk fusion protein was purified by a Talon spin column (Clontech) and then subjected to treatment with protein tyrosine phosphatase-β as described earlier (1.Lee K. Deng X. Friedman E. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 3631-3637PubMed Google Scholar). Size Fractionation by FPLC—Cells were lysed in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40 with protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science Complete). The total lysate was adjusted to 4 mg/ml, and 0.2 ml was loaded onto a Superdex 200 separation column (Amersham Biosciences) and eluted in elution buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 250 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.01% Tween 20) at 0.4 ml/min with fractions of 0.4 ml dropped into tubes containing 10 μg of bovine serum albumin/tube. Proteins were precipitated with acetone, 1 ml per tube, at -20 °C overnight, pelleted, and then dried before resuspension in SDS sample buffer followed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Recombinant Mirk from Sf21 cells was purified and sized on Superdex 200 with and without prior treatment with tyrosine phosphatase-β (1.Lee K. Deng X. Friedman E. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 3631-3637PubMed Google Scholar). Mirk protein was detected by absorbance at A280 using a UV monitor that analyzed the column eluate. In Vitro Kinase Reactions—GST-Mirk and HA-Dyrk1A, or their kinase-inactive mutant forms, were incubated together with 10 μg of MBP or ΔHNF1α-(1-283) and GST-RanBPM as noted in kinase buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol with protease and phosphatase inhibitors) containing 10 μm cold ATP plus 2.5 μCi of [32P]ATP for 10 min at 30 °C. Purified p38 was incubated together with GST-RanBPM for 30 min at 30 °C in kinase buffer as above and 10 μm cold ATP plus 2.5 μCi of [32P]ATP and 10 μg of purified recombinant p21 protein as substrate. Reaction mixtures were then analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Identification of RanBPM as a Mirk-interacting Protein—Full-length wild-type Mirk was used as bait in yeast two-hybrid screening. Seventeen candidate genes were identified after screening 3.5 × 106 clones of a human skeletal muscle cDNA library. DNA sequencing revealed that one of the Mirk-binding proteins encoded a partial sequence of RanBPM. The RanBPM clone isolated in the yeast two-hybrid assay contained a 2.7-kb fragment that coded for an N-terminal deleted RanBMP90 (amino acids 118-729) and additional 3′-untranslated sequences. Thus the initial 1-117 amino acids of RanBPM are not essential for binding to Mirk. Deletion analysis using Mirk mutants demonstrated that RanBPM interacts with the nonconserved C terminus of Mirk (Fig. 1, A and B). GST pull-down assays were used with 35S-prelabeled Mirk constructs to map the site of Mirk-RanBPM interaction. Full-length wild-type Mirk, a kinase-inactive construct, YF-Mirk (active site double mutant Y271F/Y273F), and a quadruple mutant of the putative leucine zipper (L4) exhibited similar binding to GST-RanBPM (Fig. 1A). Mirk deletion mutants were next assayed for binding to GST-RanBPM (Fig. 2A). These included ΔN, in which the entire nonconserved N terminus including the nuclear localization signal and the conserved “Dyrk box” were deleted; ΔN2, in which the entire nonconserved N terminus and conserved kinase subdomains I-V were deleted; ΔKC, in which the conserved kinase domains VI-XI were deleted; and ΔC, in which the entire nonconserved C terminus of Mirk was deleted including the PEST domain. Deletion of the entire N terminus and the initial five conserved kinase subdomains appeared to enhance binding of Mirk to RanBPM, while deletion of the nonconserved C terminus completely prevented binding to RanBPM (Fig. 1A). Thus Mirk binds to RanBPM using some sequences within its C terminus.Fig. 2Putative RanBPM binding site defined by deletion mapping.A, diagram of wild-type (WT) Mirk and Mirk deletion mutants. The position of amino acids 480-520 containing the putative RanBPM binding site is shown. B, consensus sequence in the nonconserved C termini of Mirk, human or rat Dyrk1A, and HIPK2 with their amino acid positions shown. This sequence in Mirk is within the 480-520 amino acid region containing the putative RanBPM binding site. hu, human; mu, murine.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Additional deletion mutants were prepared within the C terminus: a shorter C-terminal deletion mutant, ΔC7 (aa1-519); ΔP (Δaa440-480), in which the entire PEST domain was deleted; ΔC6 (Δaa464-480), in which part of the PEST domain was deleted; and ΔC5 (aa1-604), in which only the final 25 amino acids were deleted. The ability of these deletion mutants to bind to GST-RanBPM was compared with binding by wild-type Mirk. Deletion of the final 25 amino acids (ΔC5, data not shown) or the final 109 amino acids in ΔC7 (Fig. 1B) did not inhibit binding. Likewise deletion of the entire PEST domain (ΔP, Fig. 1B) or a partial PEST deletion (ΔC6, data not shown) did not block binding of Mirk to GST-RanBPM, while deletion of the entire C terminus (ΔC, aa1-436) completely inhibited binding (Fig. 1B). The region of Mirk lost in ΔC but retained in the other deletion mutants spans amino acids 480-520, which must include the RanBPM binding domain (Fig. 2A). This 40-amino acid-long stretch of Mirk was aligned with the related kinase homeodomain-interacting protein kinase 2 (HIPK2), which has been reported to bind to RanBPM using sequences within its nonconserved C terminus and N terminus (24.Wang Y. Schneider E.M. Li X. Duttenhofer I. Debatin K. Hug H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 297: 148Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), and with the closest relative of Mirk/Dyrk1B in the Dyrk/minibrain family, Dyrk1A. A 14-amino acid-long sequence (D/T)CEXX-SPQ(V/A) within the binding region for RanBPM in Mirk was homologous to sequences within the C-terminal nonconserved regions of Dyrk1A and HIPK2 (Fig. 2B). There is also a repeat of the SPQ sequence within HIPK2. These data demonstrate that a 40-amino acid-long segment of the nonconserved C terminus of Mirk mediates binding to RanBPM. To demonstrate that RanBPM and Mirk associate in vivo, RanBPM was immunoprecipitated from 293T cells following transient co-expression of FLAG epitope-tagged RanBPM and Mirk. The RanBPM immunoprecipitates contained co-precipitated Mirk as shown by Western blotting of the immunoprecipitates after size fractionation by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1C). Thus ectopically expressed Mirk and RanBPM complexed in vivo. The relatively low amount of co-immunoprecipitation between FLAG-RanBPM and Mirk shown here might reflect the mislocalization of much of the ectopic FLAG-RanBPM (discussed later, see Fig. 6A). To confirm in vivo association, Mv1Lu cells were co-transfected with FLAG-RanBPM and Mirk, and the following day the cells were treated for 30 min at 37 °C with the permeable cross-linking agent dimethyl-3-3′-dithiobispropionimidate. Mirk was then immunoprecipitated from the lysates that were examined by Western blotting for co-immunoprecipitated RanBPM, which was detected (Fig. 1D). Repeated experiments failed to detect Met protein within the immunoprecipitates (data not shown). However, Mirk and RanBPM associate in vivo. RanBPM Blocks the Kinase Activity of Mirk—We next explored the functional significance of the binding of RanBPM to Mirk. In vitro kinase reactions were performed with Mirk and increasing amounts of RanBPM using MBP as substrate. The highest concentration of RanBPM tested was approximately equimolar to Mirk, and this concentration of RanBPM inhibited Mirk activity 4-fold (Fig. 3A). Lower concentrations of RanBPM were less active with a 1:5 ratio of RanBPM to Mirk producing no detectable inhibition. Mirk phosphorylates the transcription factor HNF1α on at least one unique position within its CREB-binding protein binding domain, and this kinase activity is necessary for the coactivation by Mirk of the transcriptional activity of HNF1α (7.Lim S. Jin K. Friedman E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25040-25046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of HNF1α in vitro by Mirk was also inhibited by RanBPM with the highest concentration tested inhibiting Mirk activity by 70% (Fig. 3B). Phosphorylation of RanBPM by Mirk was not detected in these in vitro kinase experiments (data not shown). Mirk also did not phosphorylate DCoH, another binding protein identified by the yeast two-hybrid assay, but phosphorylated HNF1 to which DCoH bound (7.Lim S. Jin K. Friedman E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25040-25046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In analogous fashion, we hypothesize that Mirk may phosphorylate a protein to which RanBPM binds, such as Met. Dyrk1A is a kinase related to Mirk/Dyrk1B. Despite the odd nomenclature, they are not s"
https://openalex.org/W2002646124,"Excitotoxic neuronal injury related to excessive glutamate release is believed to play a key role in the pathogenesis of focal cerebral ischemia. Reversal of neuronal glutamate transporters caused by ATP fall and subsequent imbalance of membrane ionic gradients accounts for most glutamate release after cerebral ischemia. ATP synthesis from oxidative phosphorylation derives from the coupled functioning of the mitochondrial respiratory chain (MRC) and the ATP synthase; interestingly, the MRC is one of the main sites of cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation even in physiological circumstances. Hence, we have studied the effect of the antioxidants glutathione, superoxide dismutase, and alpha-tocopherol on infarct outcome, brain ATP, and glutamate levels after permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) in Fischer rats; we have also characterized the actions of antioxidants on MRC complexes. Our results show that intraperitoneal administration of antioxidants 2 h before MCAO enhances ATP synthesis and causes a neuroprotective effect concomitant to inhibition of ischemia-induced increase in brain glutamate. Antioxidants also increased mitochondrial ATP and MRC complex I-III activity and respiration, suggesting that these actions are due to removal of the inhibition caused by endogenous ROS on MRC. These findings may possess important therapeutic repercussions in the management of ischemic stroke."

https://openalex.org/W1984959562,"The interaction between the vascular endothelium and hemodynamic forces (and more specifically, fluid shear stress), induced by the flow of blood, plays a major role in vascular remodeling and in new blood vessels formation via a process termed arteriogenesis. Tie1 is an orphan tyrosine kinase receptor expressed almost exclusively in endothelial cells and is required for normal vascular development and maintenance. The present study demonstrates that Tie1 expression is rapidly down-regulated in endothelial cells exposed to shear stress, and more so to shear stress changes. This down-regulation is accompanied by a rapid cleavage of Tie1 and binding of the cleaved Tie1 45 kDa endodomain to Tie2. The rapid cleavage of Tie1 is followed by a transcriptional down-regulation in response to shear stress. The activity of the Tie1 promoter is suppressed by shear stress and by tumor necrosis factor alpha. Shear stress-induced transcriptional suppression of Tie1 is mediated by a negative shear stress response element, localized in a region of 250 bp within the promoter. The rapid down-regulation of Tie1 by shear stress changes and its rapid binding to Tie2 may be required for destabilization of endothelial cells in order to initiate the process of vascular restructuring."
https://openalex.org/W2111459296,"Neutrophil margination within blood vessels is an early finding during myocardial ischemia and can result in myocardial tissue injury. This phenomenon depends on the endothelial expression of adhesion molecules, which allow leukocyte extravasation. The hormone relaxin (RLX) was found to protect against experimental myocardial injury and to reduce neutrophil extravasation into the inflamed tissues. This study addresses the role of RLX in down-regulating endothelial adhesiveness to neutrophils and the possible involvement of NO, an anti-adhesive molecule, in the mechanism of action of RLX. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-primed rat coronary endothelial RCE) cells and neutrophils were co-cultured and their adhesion was quantified in the absence and presence of RLX, alone or together with the NO-synthase inhibitor L-NMMA. Inactivated RLX was used as control for specificity of the RLX effect. A 24-h incubation of LPS-primed RCE cells with RLX (60 and 600 ng/ml) caused a significant reduction of adherent neutrophils and of endothelial expression of the adhesion molecules P-selectin and VCAM-1 protein and mRNA, evaluated by immunohistochemistry, Western blot, and RT-PCR. These effects of RLX were blunted by L-NMMA and were not reproduced by inactivated RLX. These findings suggest that RLX has anti-inflammatory properties that could be of benefit in ischemic heart disease."

https://openalex.org/W1989993162,"Five melanocortin receptors, which form a subfamily of G protein-coupled receptors, are expressed in mammalian tissues and regulate such diverse physiological processes as pigmentation, adrenal function, energy homeostasis, feeding efficiency, and sebaceous gland lipid production, as well as immune and sexual function. Pigmentation in mammals is stimulated by alpha-melanocyte stimulating hormone (MSH), which binds to the melanocortin 1 receptor (Mc1r) and induces an activation of melanogenic enzymes through stimulation of adenylate cyclase and protein kinase A. The antagonist agouti signal protein (ASP) interacts with the Mc1r and blocks its stimulation by MSH. We examined the influence of ASP or MSH on Mc1r gene expression, and we report that both ligands influence the Mc1r 5' promoter structure in distinct manners. Our study further shows that MSH regulates Mc1r function at both the mRNA and protein levels, whereas ASP acts only on its translation."

However, specific details about their substrate specificity and mechanism of chaperone action are lacking. α1-Antichymotrypsin (ACT) and α1-antitrypsin (α1-AT) are two closely related members of the serpin superfamily that aggregate through nucleation-dependent and nucleation-independent pathways, respectively. The sHsp α-crystallin was unable to prevent the nucleation-independent aggregation of α1-AT, whereas α-crystallin inhibited ACT aggregation in a dose-dependent manner.

A large number of in vitro studies have shown that many proteins undergo inappropriate conformational changes, due to changes in solution conditions or mutation, that result in self-association and aggregate formation (1.Dobson C.M.

It exists as a heteromultimer with an average mass of 800 kDa and is composed of two closely related subunits, A and B, each of ∼20 kDa in mass. Until recently, α-crystallin was believed to be a lens-specific protein, protecting the other lens proteins from the precipitation associated with cataract blindness as well as providing transparency and refractive qualities (6.Derham B.K. Harding J.J. Prog. Retin. Eye Res. 1999; 18: 463-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar, 7.Horwitz J. Semin. Cell Dev.

However, both αA- and αB-crystallin have been found in many extralenticular tissues including the liver and brain, although only αB-crystallin is induced under stress conditions. Unlike members of the heat shock family of proteins such as GroEL/Hsp60, for which the chaperone mechanisms have been extensively characterized, less is understood about the precise mechanism and specificity of the sHsps. α-Crystallin typically sequesters aggregation-prone proteins into a high molecular weight complex and protects them from irreversible aggregation. However, under certain permissive folding conditions, bound substrates can be released, and in cooperation with other chaperones, in particular Hsp70 (6.Derham B.K. Harding J.J. Prog. Retin.

This structural change results in the exposure of an increased number of hydrophobic residues, suggesting that hydrophobic interactions play a key role in the chaperone activity of α-crystallin. Interestingly, these heat-induced changes are also accompanied by increased subunit exchange within the α-crystallin oligomer, indicating that, as with other sHsps, much smaller subunit oligomers may be the active chaperone species (6.Derham B.K.

The native serpin conformation consists of three β-sheets (A–C) surrounded by nine α-helices (A–I) (17.Elliott P.R. Abrahams J.P. Lomas D.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 275: 419-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). This scaffold presents a highly mobile reactive center loop, extending from the fifth strand of the A β-sheet. Under conditions of partial denaturation, caused by environmental changes or mutation, this reactive center loop can insert into the A β-sheet of another serpin, thereby promoting loop-sheet polymerization (13.Sivasothy P. Dafforn T.R. Gettins P.G. Lomas D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33663-33668Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Recent investigations into the mechanisms of serpin polymerization have suggested that individual serpins aggregate via different pathways. For example, α1-AT polymerizes through the formation of an intermediate ensemble that self-associates to form dimers which coalesce to form multimers (18.James E.L. Bottomley S.P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 356: 296-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 19.Devlin G.L. Chow M.K. Howlett G.J. Bottomley S.P. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 324: 859-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). However, the highly homologous plasma serpin, ACT, polymerizes through a nucleation-dependent process (20.Crowther D.C. Serpell L.C. Dafforn T.R. Gooptu B. Lomas D.A. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 2355-2363Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In this study, the substrate specificity of α-crystallin is investigated. We observe inhibition of the nucleation-dependent aggregation of ACT due to a specific interaction between ACT and α-crystallin. By contrast, α-crystallin does not prevent the nucleation-independent aggregation of α1-AT, suggesting that α-crystallin has the ability to specifically inhibit nucleation-dependent aggregation. Materials—4,4′-Dianilino-1,1′-binaphthyl-5,5′-disulfonic acid (bis-ANS) was purchased from Molecular Probes. Production of Proteins—Recombinant ACT was expressed and purified as described previously with the following modifications (21.Rubin H. Wang Z.M. Nickbarg E.B. McLarney S. Naidoo N. Schoenberger O.L. Johnson J.L. Cooperman B.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1199-1207Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After chromatography on a Q-Sepharose matrix, fractions containing inhibitory activity against bovine chymotrypsin were purified further by SP and DEAE chromatography. Recombinant wild type α1-AT was expressed and purified as described previously (22.Bottomley S.P. Stone S.R. Protein Eng. 1998; 11: 1243-1247Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The purity of these proteins was assessed by SDS- and non-denaturing-PAGE. The protein concentration of each serpin was determined using previously determined extinction coefficients for ACT (ϵ280 nm (1%) = 6.5) and α1-AT (ϵ280 nm (1%) = 5.3) (10.Lomas D.A. Elliott P.R. Sidhar S.K. Foreman R.C. Finch J.T. Cox D.W. Whisstock J.C. Carrell R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16864-16870Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 21.Rubin H. Wang Z.M. Nickbarg E.B. McLarney S. Naidoo N. Schoenberger O.L. Johnson J.L. Cooperman B.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1199-1207Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). α-Crystallin was prepared from calf lenses obtained from local abattoirs that had been stored at –20 °C as described previously (23.Lindner R.A. Kapur A. Carver J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27722-27729Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Prior to each experiment, lyophilized α-crystallin was dissolved in 50 mm Tris, 100 mm NaCl, pH 7.4, to a concentration of ∼2 mg/ml. The concentration of α-crystallin was determined using the extinction coefficient ϵ280 nm (1%) = 9.0. Production of Seed—α1-AT and ACT seed were prepared at monomer concentrations of 2.5 μm in 50 mm Tris, 100 mm NaCl, pH 7.4, by heating at 50 °C for 6 and 2 h, respectively. Samples were subsequently applied to a 10 × 300-mm Superose-6 column (Amersham Biosciences), and the protein that eluted in the void volume was collected such that no monomer was present. The protein concentrations of these samples were ascertained using the extinction coefficients reported above and were determined to possess no inhibitory activity against chymotrypsin. Aggregation Assays—Serpin aggregation was initiated by incubating α1-AT or ACT (2.5 μm) in 50 mm Tris, 100 mm NaCl, pH 7.4, at 50 °C with a mineral oil overlay to prevent evaporation during the course of the experiment. A constant temperature was maintained using a thermostatted cuvette holder and a circulating water bath. Changes in light scatter and bis-ANS fluorescence were recorded on a PerkinElmer Life Sciences LS50B spectrofluorimeter in a non-stirred 1-cm path length quartz cell. The light scatter experiments were performed using excitation and emission wavelengths of 400 and 405 nm, respectively. Changes in bis-ANS fluorescence were measured using excitation and emission wavelengths of 410 and 480 nm, respectively. CD spectra were measured on a Jasco 820s using a 0.1-cm path length quartz cell. Far-UV CD spectra from 200 to 250 nm were collected at a scan rate of 10 nm/min and accumulated five times. Gel Filtration Chromatography—All size exclusion chromatography (SEC) was carried out using a 10 × 300-mm Superose-6 column (Amersham Biosciences). 0.5-ml samples of protein were centrifuged for 5 min at 14,000 × g before application. Chromatography was carried out at 25 °C in 50 mm Tris, 100 mm NaCl, pH 7.4, with a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. The absorbance was monitored at a wavelength of 280 nm, and the data were analyzed using software supplied by the manufacturer of the fast protein liquid chromatography (Amersham Biosciences). Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis—SDS- and native PAGE was performed as described previously (24.Bottomley S.P. Chang W.-S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 1997; 241: 264-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Transverse urea gradient PAGE was performed using a continuous buffer system consisting of 43 mm imidazole and 35 mm Hepes at pH 7.5 and was carried out following the method of Goldenberg (25.Goldenberg D.P. Creighton T.E. Protein Structure: A practical Approach. IRL Press, New York1989: 225-250Google Scholar). ACT and α1-AT Aggregate through Nucleation-dependent and -independent Pathways, Respectively—Aggregation of ACT at 50 °C occurs with a sigmoidal increase in light scatter, in agreement with a previous study (20.Crowther D.C. Serpell L.C. Dafforn T.R. Gooptu B. Lomas D.A. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 2355-2363Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1a). At an ACT concentration of 2.5 μm, there is an initial lag period of ∼20 min prior to a gradual increase in light scatter that was complete after 70 min. The rate of ACT aggregation was concentration-dependent, over a range of 1–10 μm ACT, with the reaction reaching completion at much earlier times for higher protein concentrations (Fig. 1a). The initial lag phase showed an inverse correlation with protein concentration, with a much shorter lag time at higher ACT concentrations. In accord with a recent study (20.Crowther D.C. Serpell L.C. Dafforn T.R. Gooptu B. Lomas D.A. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 2355-2363Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), the rate of ACT aggregation was also sensitive to nucleation. The addition of preformed ACT polymer (5 μg/ml) promoted polymerization (Fig. 1b) and decreased the duration of the lag phase from 20 min to less than 10 min, with the full reaction reaching completion by 45 min. These effects were demonstrated to be concentration-dependent as the presence of greater concentrations of preformed polymer shortened the lag phase to less than 5 min. The aggregation of α1-AT followed by light scatter measurements showed distinct dissimilarities to that of ACT (Fig. 1c). α1-AT polymerization at 50 °C did not occur with a sigmoidal increase in light scatter, as no observable lag phase was present. Under these conditions, a hyperbolic increase in light scatter occurred that was significantly slower than that observed for ACT, reaching completion after ∼400 min (Fig. 1c, open circles). In addition, no nucleation dependence of α1-AT aggregation was observed even at a seed concentration of 50 μg/ml (Fig. 1c). Cumulatively, these data demonstrate that the mechanisms of ACT and α1-AT aggregation are significantly different. α-Crystallin Inhibits Only Nucleation-dependent Serpin Aggregation—Light scatter changes were used to examine the influence of α-crystallin on the aggregation reaction of both ACT and α1-AT. In these experiments, α-crystallin was able to suppress the light scatter increase associated with the thermal aggregation of ACT aggregation in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2a). The presence of equimolar amounts of α-crystallin almost completely suppressed ACT aggregation (Fig. 2a). Thus, under these conditions, the interaction between ACT and α-crystallin appeared to have a stoichiometry of approximately one-to-one on a molar subunit basis. In contrast, α-crystallin was unable to suppress thermal aggregation of α1-AT even at a 2-fold molar subunit excess of α-crystallin (Fig. 2b). When α-crystallin was incubated alone under the same conditions, there was no change in light scatter (data not shown). These data strongly indicate that α-crystallin displays substrate specificity in its chaperone action. Having established that α-crystallin inhibits ACT aggregation, we used size exclusion chromatography to gain insight into the interaction between the two proteins. Fig. 3a shows the elution profile of ACT (2.5 μm) incubated at 50 °C over a 2-h time period in the absence of α-crystallin. As expected, at 0 min, native monomeric ACT eluted as a single sharp peak at of ∼45 kDa. Progressively with time, the monomeric ACT peak reduced in size as more material eluted in the void volume of the column, indicating the formation of large soluble ACT polymers. After 80 min, the size of peak corresponding to the polymerized material decreased dramatically as the polymerized protein dropped out of solution and was removed by centrifugation prior to application to the column. The same reaction performed in the presence of equimolar amounts of α-crystallin is shown in Fig. 4a. Here, at 0 min, in addition to the monomeric ACT, the broad peak of α-crystallin eluted at ∼12.8 ml, indicative of its molecular mass of ∼800 kDa. A small peak eluting in the void volume was demonstrated by SDS-PAGE analysis to be large aggregates of α-crystallin (data not shown). During the incubation at 50 °C, a similar loss of the monomeric ACT was observed as in the absence of α-crystallin. However, this loss of monomer was not accompanied by the formation of polymeric ACT; instead, the size of the α-crystallin peak increased. SDS-PAGE analysis of this fraction confirmed that it contained both ACT and αA- and αB-crystallin (Fig. 4b, lane 3). The elution volume of the α-crystallin (Fig. 4a) did not change over the time course; however, the peak became significantly broader, tending toward lower elution volumes. In the presence or absence of α-crystallin, the loss of monomeric ACT reached completion around 80 min (Figs. 3a and 4a), in good agreement with the light scatter data (Fig. 1a). In both cases, however, ∼12% of the initial monomeric material persisted after heating. This material was intact, monomeric, and inactive against chymotrypsin (data not shown). In addition, it could not be unfolded by 8 m urea (Fig. 3b), suggesting that it is in the latent conformation of ACT in which the reactive center loop is inserted into its own A β-sheet to give an inactive monomer (26.Chang W.S. Lomas D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3695-3701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar).Fig. 4Inhibition of ACT aggregation by α-crystallin as monitored by SEC. As shown in a, equimolar amounts of ACT and α-crystallin were incubated at 50 °C. At the times indicated, samples were collected, and the reaction was quenched on ice prior to application to a Superose-6 column. As shown in b, after a 60-min incubation, the eluent from the size exclusion column between 11 and 14 ml (corresponding to the α-crystallin peak) was collected, pooled, and concentrated prior to analysis on 12% (w/v) SDS-PAGE. Lane 1, 5 μg of native ACT; lane 2, 5 μg of α-crystallin; lane 3, 60-min elution peak. The eluent from the size exclusion column between 11 and 14 ml was also collected when monomeric ACT was applied to the column to ensure that no ACT eluted in these volumes (lane 4). Molecular masses (MW) are in kDa.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The kinetics of monomeric ACT loss and ACT-α-crystallin complex formation were analyzed by integration of the peaks from the gel filtration data (Figs. 3a and 4a) to obtain information about the relative quantities of the protein species (Fig. 5). These data fitted well to a single exponential function, and the rate of ACT loss was virtually identical either in the absence or in the presence of α-crystallin (kapp = 0.028 ± 0.003 min–1 and 0.029 ± 0.001 min–1, respectively). Similarly, the formation of the ACT-α-crystallin complex could be fitted to a single exponential function, giving a comparable rate of 0.033 ± 0.006 min–1. Spectroscopic Analysis of ACT α-crystallin Interaction Reveals Binding of a Non-native ACT Species—Far-UV CD was used to assess the conformation of ACT in complex with α-crystallin by collecting the fraction containing the ACT-α-crystallin complex from the SEC and measuring the far-UV CD spectra (Fig. 6, thin broken line). α-Crystallin heated alone under the same conditions (thin solid line) gave a broad spectrum with a minimum at ∼215 nm, consistent with previous data (27.Bova M.P. Yaron O. Huang Q. Ding L. Haley D.A. Stewart P.L. Horwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6137-6142Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). This spectrum was subsequently subtracted from that of the ACT-α-crystallin complex (thick broken line). As previous studies have shown that the secondary and tertiary structures of α-crystallin are not grossly altered when in complex with a protein substrate (28.Lindner R.A. Kapur A. Mariani M. Titmuss S.J. Carver J.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 258: 170-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), this difference spectrum is assumed to represent the conformation of ACT in the complex. When compared with the native ACT spectrum at an identical concentration (thick solid line), ACT in complex with α-crystallin appears to have lost ∼20% of its ellipticity at 222 nm. Previous work has shown that there is a dramatic increase in bis-ANS fluorescence when the polymerogenic precursor of ACT is formed (29.Pearce M.C. Rubin H. Bottomley S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28513-28518Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). We examined the kinetics of this conformational change in the presence and absence of α-crystallin. Fig. 7 shows a dramatic increase in bis-ANS fluorescence intensity as a result of ACT undergoing a conformational change upon incubation at 50 °C; this change occurred with a rate of 1.06 ± 0.01 min–1. In agreement with previous studies (6.Derham B.K. Harding J.J. Prog. Retin. Eye Res. 1999; 18: 463-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar, 7.Horwitz J. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 11: 53-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 8.Van Montfort R. Slingsby C. Vierling E. Adv. Protein Chem. 2001; 59: 105-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar), we found that α-crystallin itself binds more bis-ANS when it undergoes its heat-induced activation (Fig. 7, inset, broken black line). Therefore, α-crystallin alone was incubated at 50 °C prior to the addition of ACT, such that the bis-ANS fluorescence changes associated with the α-crystallin conformational change could be separated from those of ACT. The change in bis-ANS fluorescence intensity when ACT was added to the solution containing α-crystallin occurred in a single kinetic phase with a rate of 0.95 ± 0.01 min–1, which is similar to the rate obtained in the absence of α-crystallin. The amplitudes of this change were also similar, whether in the presence or absence of α-crystallin, suggesting that under both conditions, ACT adopts a similar partially unfolded state. Taken together with the far-UV CD results, these data are consistent with ACT being in a non-native conformation when complexed to α-crystallin. sHsps possess the ability to bind to partially folded proteins and maintain their solubility. The mechanisms by which this chaperone function is carried out are poorly characterized. Previous studies have implied that yeast Hsp26, a sHsp, undergoes dissociation to produce a species that can bind the protein substrate (30.Haslbeck M. Walke S. Stromer T. Ehrnsperger M. White H.E. Chen S. Saibil H.R. Buchner J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6744-6751Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). These smaller species then reassemble to form the large complexes with bound substrate (30.Haslbeck M. Walke S. Stromer T. Ehrnsperger M. White H.E. Chen S. Saibil H.R. Buchner J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6744-6751Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). α-Crystallin also undergoes quaternary structural rearrangement upon complex formation with substrate proteins (31.Haley D.A. Bova M.P. Huang Q.L. McHaourab H.S. Stewart P.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 298: 261-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). It is generally believed that sHsps have little substrate specificity, i.e. they interact and complex to substrate proteins that are aggregating due to mutual associations between exposed hydrophobic surfaces (6.Derham B.K. Harding J.J. Prog. Retin. Eye Res. 1999; 18: 463-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar, 7.Horwitz J. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 11: 53-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 8.Van Montfort R. Slingsby C. Vierling E. Adv. Protein Chem. 2001; 59: 105-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). In other words, sHsps are highly promiscuous molecular chaperones. Our finding that α-crystallin is only capable of repressing the aggregation of ACT but not α1-AT suggests that α-crystallin may display substrate specificity based upon either structural differences between the two proteins and/or their different aggregation mechanisms. ACT and α1-AT display high sequence homology, with 44% of their residues being absolutely conserved (32.Chandra T. Stackhouse R. Kidd V.J. Robson K.J. Woo S.L. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 5055-5061Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). The crystal structures of both ACT (33.Wei A. Rubin H. Cooperman B.S. Christianson D.W. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 251-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) and α1-AT (17.Elliott P.R. Abrahams J.P. Lomas D.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 275: 419-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) have been solved and are almost identical. The most significant difference between the two native serpins is in the length of their reactive center loop regions, with that of ACT being four residues longer. It is unlikely that this small structural difference could play a role in the preferential binding of α-crystallin to ACT. However, what is important for the interaction of these proteins with α-crystallin is the partially unfolded conformations that they can adopt during aggregation. Previous studies with α1-AT indicate that aggregation proceeds through a single partially unfolded species that self-associates (18.James E.L. Bottomley S.P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 356: 296-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 19.Devlin G.L. Chow M.K. Howlett G.J. Bottomley S.P. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 324: 859-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 34.Dafforn T.R. Mahadeva R. Elliott P.R. Sivasothy P. Lomas D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9548-9555Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). In contrast, a recent study demonstrated that two partially folded species were formed during the aggregation of ACT (20.Crowther D.C. Serpell L.C. Dafforn T.R. Gooptu B. Lomas D.A. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 2355-2363Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). It is feasible that the non-native species of α1-AT and ACT may be sufficiently different in conformation to explain the specificity of α-crystallin interaction. However, given the high sequence homology and adoption of similar folding intermediates (29.Pearce M.C. Rubin H. Bottomley S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28513-28518Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 35.James E.L. Whisstock J.C. Gore M.G. Bottomley S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9482-9488Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), it seems unlikely that the relatively subtle differences in structure between ACT and α1-AT would have a major role in determining the substrate specificity of α-crystallin for ACT over α1-AT particularly because of the broad substrate specificity of α-crystallin and other sHsps as determined from many studies of sHsp chaperone action (6.Derham B.K. Harding J.J. Prog. Retin. Eye Res. 1999; 18: 463-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar, 7.Horwitz J. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 11: 53-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 8.Van Montfort R. Slingsby C. Vierling E. Adv. Protein Chem. 2001; 59: 105-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). Instead, a much more tangible contribution to specificity may be the distinct mechanistic and kinetic differences between the aggregation processes of the two serpins. The inhibitory effect of α-crystallin on ACT aggregation was dose-dependent, with full repression occurring at a ratio of one ACT molecule per subunit of α-crystallin (Fig. 2a). This stoichiometry is in agreement with that found in the chaperone interaction of sHsps with other stressed substrate proteins, e.g. α-lactalbumin (36.Carver J.A. Lindner R.A. Lyon C. Canet D. Hernandez H. Dobson C.M. Redfield C. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 318: 815-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). In this case, and as with all of the other substrate proteins shown previously to interact with α-crystallin (37.Abgar S. Vanhoudt J. Aerts T. Clauwaert J. Biophys J. 2001; 80: 1986-1995Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 38.Hatters D.M. Lindner R.A. Carver J.A. Howlett G.J. J. Biol.

Commun. 2001; 287: 642-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), the aggregation profile is sigmoidal (Figs. 1a and 2a), indicative of a nucleation-dependent mechanism. α-Crystallin does not prevent the aggregation of α1-AT, which occurs via a simple polymerization process involving the sequential addition of α1-AT monomers to form a chain in an essentially one-way process. By contrast, nucleation-dependent aggregation is a dynamic process involving equilibria between various aggregated states. Although α-crystallin typically exists as a large heteromultimer, previous studies have clearly demonstrated the dynamic nature of the quaternary structure that arises from extensive subunit exchange (45.Bova M.P. Ding L.L. Horwitz J. Fung B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29511-29517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Thus, similar dynamic interchange of subunits occurs in both the chaperone, α-crystallin, and its substrate protein, ACT, during their interaction. Previously, we have proposed that dynamic interchange of both proteins facilitates their mutual incorporation during chaperone action into a complex without the requirement for an external input of energy, i.e. via ATP hydrolysis (36.Carver J.A. Lindner R.A. Lyon C. Canet D. Hernandez H. Dobson C.M. Redfield C. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 318: 815-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). It would seem from the evidence presented herein that a similar mechanism is operating during the interaction of ACT with α-crystallin. Furthermore, as is apparent from comparing Fig. 2, a and b, the aggregation of α1-AT occurs over a much longer time scale than that of ACT. α-Crystallin is a much more efficient chaperone when it interacts with slowly aggregating proteins (36.Carver J.A. Lindner R.A. Lyon C. Canet D. Hernandez H. Dobson C.M. Redfield C. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 318: 815-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Thus, if aggregation kinetics were the only criteria in determining whether α-crystallin bound to either serpin, it would have been expected to prevent the aggregation of α1-AT much more effectively than ACT. Clearly, this is not the case. Elevated temperature increases the rate of subunit exchange in α-crystallin in addition to causing partial unfolding of the protein and exposure of greater hydrophobicity (6.Derham B.K. Harding J.J. Prog. Retin. Eye Res. 1999; 18: 463-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar, 7.Horwitz J. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 11: 53-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 8.Van Montfort R. Slingsby C. Vierling E. Adv. Protein Chem. 2001; 59: 105-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). It is to the exposed hydrophobic substrate-binding region(s) that partially folded substrate proteins are thought to bind. The loss of monomeric ACT is unaffected by the presence of α-crystallin, and its complexation to α-crystallin occurs at virtually the same rate. The implication from these data is that α-crystallin interacts with a monomeric form of ACT that is in a conformationally altered (destabilized) state. In agreement with this, other studies have shown that α-crystallin interacts with monomeric stressed states of substrate proteins rather than the aggregated species (46.Lindner R.A. Treweek T.M. Carver J.A. Biochem. J. 2001; 354: 79-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 47.Farahbakhsh Z.T. Huang Q.L. Ding L.L. Altenbach C. Steinhoff H.J. Horwitz J. Hubbell W.L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 509-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Furthermore, these species are in a partially folded intermediate conformation. An interesting observation from this study is the formation of latent ACT during the aggregation reaction (Fig. 3b). The presence of α-crystallin was also unable to prevent its accumulation (Figs. 3 and 4). The formation of latent serpin represents a misfolding event distinct from aggregation, and the data presented here suggest a bifurcation in the misfolding pathway of ACT in the absence of α-crystallin, with the majority of the material forming polymers and the remainder (∼12%) forming the latent species. Latent ACT has been found in the lungs of patients with chronic bronchitis and emphysema (26.Chang W.S. Lomas D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3695-3701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The indifference of α-crystallin to the precursor of latent ACT supports previous findings that the chaperone only interacts with misfolding intermediates that are on an irreversible pathway toward an aggregated and precipitated form, i.e. stable, monomeric species, even if they are partially unfolded, are not recognized by α-crystallin (23.Lindner R.A. Kapur A. Carver J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27722-27729Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 48.Treweek T.M. Lindner R.A. Mariani M. Carver J.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1481: 175-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Both ACT and α1-AT are acute phase plasma proteins, with the latter being by far the most abundant in circulation. However, the deficiency of either protein due to the homozygous inheritance of point-mutated alleles results in the development of early onset panlobular emphysema caused by the unprotected proteolysis of elastin by immune proteases (49.Lomas D.A. Mahadeva R. J. Clin. Investig. 2002; 110: 1585-1590Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Although αA-crystallin is predominantly an eye lens protein (50.Srinivasan A.N. Nagineni C.N. Bhat S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23337-23341Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), αB-crystallin has been shown to be present in many other tissues, especially those with high metabolism and high protein turnover, including the liver, where the two serpins of this study are synthesized (51.Dubin R.A. Wawrousek E.F. Piatigorsky J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 1083-1091Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar, 52.Iwaki T. Kume-Iwaki A. Liem R.K. Goldman J.E. Cell. 1989; 57: 71-78Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). Previously, the only demonstrated interaction of a molecular chaperone with a serpin has been the association of α1-AT with the endoplasmic reticulumresident chaperone, calnexin (53.Ou W.J. Cameron P.H. Thomas D.Y. Bergeron J.J. Nature. 1993; 364: 771-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). Terminally misfolded α1-AT forms a complex with calnexin, which is subsequently tagged with ubiquitin for degradation. Studies indicate that this clearance system is sufficiently protective for the 85–90% of α1-AT deficiency individuals that do not develop liver pathologies (54.Sveger T. N. Engl. J. Med. 1976; 294: 1316-1321Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar). The apparent frequency of liver pathology in individuals with ACT deficiency is much lower than those with α1-AT, leading to the notion that more efficient pathways of clearance exist for misfolded ACT (49.Lomas D.A. Mahadeva R. J. Clin. Investig. 2002; 110: 1585-1590Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). The effective and specific suppression of the nucleation-dependent polymerization of ACT by α-crystallin (and therefore most likely other sHsps), coupled with the co-expression of both of these proteins within liver tissue, implies a potential role for sHsps in the clearance of misfolded ACT. In conclusion, the analysis of the interaction between α1-AT and ACT with α-crystallin provides new insights into the substrate specificity of the chaperone, which is based upon the mechanism and kinetics of the substrate protein aggregation process. α-Crystallin, and by inference, all sHsps, have a preference for nucleation-dependent aggregating substrate proteins, implying that dynamic exchange of the chaperone subunits and the aggregating substrate protein is an important determinant in their mutual chaperone association.

A small fraction of channels fail to inactivate (burst) at depolarized potentials where normal (wild type) channels fully inactivate. These noninactivating channels give rise to a sustained macroscopic current. We studied the effects of protein kinase A stimulation on sustained current in wild type and three disease-linked C-terminal mutant channels (D1790G, Y1795C, and Y1795H). We show that protein kinase A stimulation differentially affects gating in the mutant channels. Wild type, Y1795C, and Y1795H channels are insensitive to protein kinase A stimulation, whereas “bursting” in the D1790G mutant is markedly enhanced by protein kinase A-dependent phosphorylation. Our results suggest that the charge at position 1790 of the C terminus of the channel modulates the response of the cardiac sodium channel to protein kinase A stimulation and that phosphorylation of residue 36 in the N terminus and residue 525 in the cytoplasmic linker joining domains I and II of the channel α subunit facilitate destabilization of inactivation and thereby increase sustained current.

However, a small fraction of channels may fail to inactivate, a phenomenon termed “bursting.” Bursting channels allow passage of Na+ at depolarized potentials, resulting in sustained macroscopic current (Isus). A number of Na+ channel-linked mutations that underlie Long-QT syndrome (LQT-3) have been shown to promote channel bursting (7Bennett P.B. Yazawa K. Makita N. George A.L.

Furthermore, the C terminus of the Na+ channel α subunit modulates gating of brain and heart Na+ channels (19Mantegazza M. Yu F.H. Catterall W.A. Scheuer T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sc. U. S.

In this study we investigate the possibility that mutations in the heart Na+ channel C terminus may affect the functional response of the channel to PKA-dependent phosphorylation. We focused on the effects of PKA on Isus in wild type (WT) and three previously reported C-terminal mutations: D1790G (22An R.H. Wang X.L. Kerem B. Benhorin J. Medina A. Goldmit M. Kass R.S. Circ. Res. 1998; 83: 141-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), Y1795C (23Rivolta I. Abriel H. Tateyama M. Liu H. Memmi M. Vardas P. Napolitano C. Priori S.G. Kass R.S. J. Biol.

We were particularly interested in the response of D1790G channels to PKA stimulation because this mutation has been reported to promote Isus by some investigators (24Baroudi G. Chahine M. FEBS Lett. 2000; 487: 224-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) but not by others (22An R.H. Wang X.L. Kerem B. Benhorin J. Medina A. Goldmit M. Kass R.S. Circ.

We indeed found marked differences in the response of the mutant channels to PKA stimulation. Bursting activity was insensitive to PKA in WT, Y1795C, and Y1795H channels but was significantly enhanced in a PKA-dependent manner in D1790G channels. We extended our inquiry to try to elucidate the mechanism of this differential response of the mutations by carrying out site-directed mutagenesis. Our analysis suggests that PKA-dependent modulation of bursting is enhanced by alteration of the negative charge at residue 1790 and may require the phosphorylation of both Ser36 and Ser525 in the channel α subunit. The results support the idea that the C terminus of the Na+ channel plays an important role in modulating gating of the channel and suggest that multiple factors are likely to affect the cellular and systems phenotypes of disease-linked mutations of the Na+ α subunit. Mutagenesis and Transient Transfection—The C-terminal mutations of SCN5A were engineered into WT cDNA cloned in pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen) by overlap extension using mutation-specific primers and a QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The presence of the mutation was confirmed by sequence analysis (23Rivolta I. Abriel H. Tateyama M. Liu H. Memmi M. Vardas P. Napolitano C. Priori S.G. Kass R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30623-30630Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). All of the constructs were transiently expressed in HEK293 cells. Transient transfection was carried out using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen) according to the protocol suggested by the manufacturer. The cells were transfected with equal amounts of the α subunit and the hβ1 subunit (SCNB1), subcloned individually into the pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen) vector. In addition, the same amount of CD8 cDNA was co-transfected as a reporter gene (EBo-pCD vector; American Type Culture Collection; total cDNA, 2.5 μg). CD8-positive cells were patch clamped 48 h after transfection. Expression of CD8 did not alter the channel properties, compared with those of stably expressed channel (data not shown). Control experiments in which CD8 and hβ1 were transfected together using a bicistronic vector (pIRES, Clontech) were used to confirm co-expression of the hβ1 and α subunits as described above. Expressed channel biophysical properties were independent of the above conditions (data not shown). Electrophysiology—The membrane currents were measured using whole cell and single channel patch clamp procedures with Axopatch 200B amplifiers and the Pclamp 8 program (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA). All of the measurements were obtained at room temperature (22 °C). Macroscopic whole cell Na+ current was recorded using the following solutions. The normal internal solution contained 50 mmol/liter aspartic acid, 60 mmol/liter CsCl, 5 mmol/liter Na2-ATP, 11 mmol/liter EGTA, 10 mmol/liter HEPES, 1 mmol/liter CaCl2, 1 mmol/liter and MgCl2, pH 7.4, adjusted with CsOH. In some experiments, the major anion in the pipette solution was replaced by fluoride: 10 mmol/liter NaF, 110 mmol/liter CsF, 20 mmol/liter CsCl, 10 mmol/liter EGTA, 10 mmol/liter HEPES, pH 7.4, adjusted with 25 mmol/liter CsOH. The external solution contained 130 mmol/liter NaCl, 2 mmol/liter CaCl2, 5 mmol/liter CsCl, 1.2 mmol/liter MgCl2, 10 mmol/liter HEPES, 5 mmol/liter and glucose, pH 7.4, adjusted with CsOH. Dialysis with intracellular F– was accompanied by hyperpolarizing shifts in the voltage dependence of inactivation not recorded for the aspartate/Cl– intracellular solution (26Abriel H. Cabo C. Wehrens X.H. Rivolta I. Motoike H.K. Memmi M. Napolitano C. Priori S.G. Kass R.S. Circ. Res. 2001; 88: 740-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar); consequently holding potentials were changed from –100 to –150 mV for aspartate and F– pipette solutions. The data were discarded when the series resistance was more than 7 mΩ. Noninactivated sustained Na+ channel current (Isus) was determined by subtracting background currents measured in the presence of tetrodotoxin (TTX; 30 μm, Molecular Probes) from TTX-free records. The amplitude of Isus was measured 150 ms after depolarization to –10 mV to avoid channel re-openings that occur in the voltage range in which activation and inactivation overlap (window current) (25Wang D.W. Yazawa K. George A.L.J. Bennett P.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13200-13205Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 26Abriel H. Cabo C. Wehrens X.H. Rivolta I. Motoike H.K. Memmi M. Napolitano C. Priori S.G. Kass R.S. Circ. Res. 2001; 88: 740-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The voltage dependence of channel availability was determined by relative current amplitude after the application of conditioning pulses (500 ms) applied to a series of voltages once every 2 s. Boltzmann relationships were fit to the data using Origin (Microcal, Northhampton, MA) software to extract the voltage of half-maximal inactivation (V½) and slope factor (Vk) for this relationship. For single channel experiments, the pipettes were coated with Sylgard (Dow Chemical Co., Midland, MI) to decrease noise and capacitance of the glass. Electrode resistance was typically 5–7 MΩ when filled with single channel internal solution (110 mmol/liter NaCl, 10 mmol/liter HEPES, pH adjusted to 7.4). The external solution for single channel recordings was 140 mm KCl, 5 mm HEPES, 10 mm MgCl2, pH adjusted to 7.4. After establishing the cell-attached configuration (seal resistance > 10 GΩ), the membrane was held at a holding potential of –120 mV. Test pulses (–20 mV for 100 ms) were applied every 0.5 s. Single channel currents were filtered by a low pass filter in the clamp amplifier with a cut-off frequency of 5 kHz and digitized for storage on computer at a sampling frequency of 20 kHz. Capacity and leak currents were eliminated by digital subtraction of averaged null sweeps. Bursting activity was defined as repetitive (more than three times) and long lasting (more than 30 ms) channel openings (see Fig. 6). Bursting probability (Pb) for less than 11 channel patches was calculated by the following equation.Pb=1-(b/t)1/n(Eq. 1) where b, t, and n represent the number of non-bursting sweeps, total sweeps (1500–3000), and channels, respectively. The number of channels included in each patch was estimated by counting the overlap of channel openings. The data are represented as the means ± S.E. The statistical significance between control and treated group was evaluated by the unpaired Student's t test. Statistical significance of treated groups against control was first verified by analysis of variance (for multiple groups) and then evaluated by Dannet's t test; p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Okadaic acid, okadaic acid methylester (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA) and cyclic AMP (Sigma) were dissolved with internal solution and kept at –20 °C. The concentration of the stock solution was 2 μm for okadaic acid and okadaic acid methyl ester and 20 mm for cAMP. The protein kinase inhibitor peptide (PKI) was also purchased from Sigma and dissolved in pipette solution (20 μm). TTX was purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR) and dissolved in the bath solution (30 μm). For single channel experiments, the cells were preincubated in solutions containing okadaic acid (2 μm) for 30 min before single channel experiments. The cell-attached patch clamp experiments were then carried out with the same okadaic acid concentration in bath solution. To focus on possible changes in channel bursting induced by PKA, we measured currents in response to prolonged (150 ms) pulses to –10 mV, a voltage that is sufficiently positive to avoid measurement of channel reopening that may occur as a consequence of the overlap steady-state activation and inactivation curves (25Wang D.W. Yazawa K. George A.L.J. Bennett P.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13200-13205Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 27Attwell D. Cohen I. Eisner D. Ohba M. Ojeda C. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1979; 379: 137-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). In whole cell recordings, bursting channels are reflected in sustained inward (Isus) current under these conditions. As illustrated in Fig. 1, dialysis of cells with cAMP (200 μm) has no effect on Isus recorded in cells expressing WT, Y1795H, or Y1795C channels but markedly increases Isus in cells expressing D1790G channels. The results summarized in Fig. 1 suggest that cAMP-dependent phosphorylation may selectively increase Isus in D1790G channels. We next tested for activity of endogenous phosphatase activity that might exist and buffer phosphorylation-dependent changes in channel activity. Similar to the results summarized in Fig. 1, we found that dialysis of cells with the nonspecific phosphatase inhibitor okadaic acid (0.2 μm) significantly increased Isus of D1790G channels but had no significant effect on Isus recorded in cells expressing WT, Y1795C, or Y1795H channels (Fig. 2). Similarly we found but did not illustrate that Isus recorded in cells expressing two other disease linked mutant channels (ΔKPQ7 and S1103Y28) was unaffected by okadaic acid dialysis (ΔKPQ, 0.40 ± 0.06% (control, n = 6), 0.37 ± 0.08% (okadaic acid, n = 6, n.s.); S1103Y, 0.09 ± 0.01% (control, n = 5), 0.09 ± 0.02% (okadaic acid, n = 5, n.s.)). Thus, the results of these experiments suggest that okadaic acid and/or dialysis of cells with cAMP can increase Isus specifically in cells expressing D1790G channels. The effects of okadaic acid on Isus were due to dephosphorylation of a PKA-mediated reaction because 1) dialysis with the inactive methylester of okadaic acid did not have any effect and 2) concomitant dialysis of a PKA inhibitory peptide with okadaic acid ablated okadaic acid-enhanced Isus in cells expressing D1790G channels (Fig. 3). Further evidence supporting the effect of okadaic acid on D1790G channel current is due to inhibition of endogenous phosphatase activity is provided by the data in Fig. 4, which show that dialysis of cells with F–, which is also a nonspecific phosphatase inhibitor (29Ono K.

The voltage protocols used in the experiments summarized above were chosen to minimize possible effects on window currents; however, experiments summarized in Figs. 5 and 6 confirm that the effects of okadaic acid (and/or cAMP) on D1790G channel activity are a consequence of an increase in the bursting frequency of the expressed channels. An increase in sustained current that is caused by bursting should be detected over a broad range of voltages in response to a slow voltage ramp protocol. This is in contrast to window current, which occurs over a narrow voltage range, causing peak of current in response to a voltage ramp as illustrated in Fig. 5 for WT channels. The voltage dependence of WT channel current in response to the voltage ramp is clearly distinct from that of D1790G channels using the same protocol (Fig. 5, lower traces). In the case of D1790G channels, the non-zero current has a broad voltage dependence, and this current is more than doubled by dialysis with okadaic acid (0.2 μm) plus cAMP (200 μm). Single channel recordings (Fig. 6) confirm an effect on channel bursting. In these experiments, D1790G channel activity measured in cell-attached patches is altered by exposure of cells to okadaic acid. In these experiments cells were incubated in okadaic acid (2 μm) containing solution for 30 min, and then, in the continued presence of okadaic acid (2 μm), single channel recordings were carried out. Okadaic acid significantly (p < 0.05) increased the frequency for which bursting was detected compared with recordings made under identical experimental conditions but in the absence of okadaic acid. These data are summarized as the bar graph in Fig. 6B, which compares bursting frequency in the absence (0.004 ± 0.001%, control, n = 9) and presence (0.011 ± 0.003%, 2 μm OA, n = 10) of okadaic acid. Taken together, these data strongly suggest that D1790G channels are modulated by cAMP-dependent in a manner that increases the frequency of bursting for these channels and that this effect appears specific for D1790G versus WT and all other (four) disease-linked mutant channels we investigated. We carried out additional analysis by mutagenesis to determine 1) whether or not the change in charge that occurs via the D1790G mutation contributes to the cAMP sensitivity of channel bursting and 2) whether or not previously identified consensus PKA phosphorylation sites might be involved in this process. Residue 1790 falls within a region of the C-terminal tail of the α subunit, which is predicted to be highly structured and enriched with negative charges (20Cormier J.W. Rivolta I. Tateyama M. Yang A.S. Kass R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9233-9241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Because the naturally occurring mutation D1790G neutralizes a negative charge at residue 1790G, we tested the possibility that this alteration in charge may, at least in part, underlie the apparently unique responsiveness of D1790G channels to cAMP-dependent modulation. As such, we replaced the aspartate at this residue by a lysine (D1790K) that, instead of neutralizing the charge at this residue, changes its polarity. As is the case for D1790G channels, cells expressing D1790K channels do not exhibit marked Isus under control conditions (not shown) but share virtually an identical response to okadaic acid with D1790G channels (Fig. 7). Similar to currents for D1790G channels, D1790K Isus is more than doubled by okadaic acid (0.2 μm) dialysis, and the effect is completely inhibited by concomitant dialysis with PKI (20 μm) (Fig. 7). Importantly, replacing the aspartate at residue 1790 by another negatively charged amino acid, glutamate, has no effect on the sensitivity of channel bursting to cAMP. In fact both the basal bursting level and the lack of cAMP-dependent regulation of the D1790E channel are remarkably similar to those of the wild type (Asp1790) channel. Thus, it appears that mutation-induced alteration in charge at position 1790 plays an important role in conferring a cAMP sensitivity to bursting of the expressed channels. Mutagenesis, as summarized in Fig. 8, suggests that the effects of cAMP and okadaic acid on D1790G channels are mediated via PKA phosphorylation of specific sites on the α subunit. Using the D1790G mutant as a backbone, we then used alanine mutations to analyze the roles of three consensus PKA sites, Ser36, Ser525, and Ser528, in the response of D1790G channels to cAMP (200 μm) and okadaic acid (0.2 μm). The response of D1790G channels to cAMP was not changed when Ser528 (in the D1790G backbone) was mutated to alanine. Similarly, the individual mutations S36A and S525A in the D1790G backbone reduced but did not significantly alter cAMP-dependent D170G channel bursting. However, mutation of both Ser36 and Ser525 to alanine within the D1790G backbone significantly reduced the effects of cAMP and odakaic acid on D1790G channel bursting (Fig. 8). In fact there is no significant difference between Isus measured in the presence of okadaic acid and cAMP for the D1790G double mutant (S36A, S525A) channels compared with D1790G channels without these mutations but in the presence of the inhibitory peptide PKI. The results of this study strongly suggest that the D1790G mutation results in an increased sensitivity of channel bursting to PKA-dependent phosphorylation. Furthermore, the effects of cAMP on channel bursting appear to depend critically upon the negative charge at position 1790 of the C-terminal tail of the channel, because alteration of this charge by inherited (D1790G) or experimentally imposed (D1790K) mutation significantly increases PKA-dependent modulation of bursting, whereas replacement of Asp1790 by a negatively charged glutamate residue has no effect either on basal bursting activity or on the response of the channel to PKA stimulation. Recording conditions that inhibit endogenous phosphatase activity promote bursting of D1790G channels, whereas in the absence of phosphatase inhibitions, bursting of these channels is not significantly different from wild type channels. PKA-dependent Regulation of Isus Is Modulated by the C-terminal Domain—The Na+ channel α subunit expressed in multiple tissues has been reported to be a substrate for both PKA and protein kinase C-dependent phosphorylation (11Rossie S.

Science. 1991; 254: 115-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar), and various effects have been reported as consequences of phosphorylation of specific sites on the channel. Activation of protein kinase C has been reported to promote bursting of Nav1.2 channels, but PKA stimulation has been reported previously to have little or no effect on bursting of WT or of ΔKPQ mutant Nav1.5 channels (35Chandra R. Chauhan V.S. Starmer C.F. Grant A.O. Cardiovasc. Res. 1999; 42: 490-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Thus, this is the first report of significant PKA-dependent enhancement of Na+ channel bursting. Attention has focused increasingly on a role of the Na+ channel C terminus in modulation of channel inactivation. Kinetic and voltage-dependent properties of brain (Nav1.2) channel gating can be conferred upon heart (Nav1.5) channels by exchange of C-terminal domains (19Mantegazza M. Yu F.H. Catterall W.A. Scheuer T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sc. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 15348-15353Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). A recent study showed that truncation of a distal region of the C-terminal domain of the heart channel (Nav1.5) markedly stimulates the channel bursting (20Cormier J.W. Rivolta I. Tateyama M. Yang A.S. Kass R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9233-9241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Our results are consistent with these studies and suggest not only an important role of the C-terminal domain in determining the effects of PKA on channel bursting but that discrete regions are involved in this regulation. Diversity in Sodium Channel Structure May Contribute to Multiple Effects of PKA—Diversity in the sequences in the I and II cytoplasmic loops of Nav1.2 (brain) and Nav1.4 (skeletal muscle Na+ channels), which contain multiple PKA consensus phosphorylation sites, has been postulated to contribute distinct functional effects of PKA in these Na+ channel isoforms (12Murphy B.J. Rossie S. De Jongh K.S. Catterall W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 27355-27362Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Murphy B.J. Rogers J. Perdichizzi A.P. Colvin A.A. Catterall W.A. J. Biol.

Physiol. 2000; 278: C638-C645Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PKA-dependent reduction of Nav1.2 channel current was ablated or converted into a PKA-dependent increase in current by mutation of PKA consensus serines in the I-II linker. These effects were not seen when the I-II linker was replaced by the Nav1.4 I-II linker (37Smith R.D. Goldin A.L. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 1965-1974Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly experiments provide evidence for a key role of the I-II linker in the response of heart (Nav1.5) channels to cAMP (15Frohnwieser B. Chen L.Q. Schreibmayer W. Kallen R.G. J. Physiol. 1997; 498: 309-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). In this study five putative PKA consensus sites (Thr17, Ser483, Ser593, Thr979, and Thr1028) shown not to be involved in PKA-dependent modulation of Na+ channel (15Frohnwieser B. Chen L.Q. Schreibmayer W. Kallen R.G. J. Physiol. 1997; 498: 309-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) were not investigated. However three other consensus sites, including Ser525 in the I-II loop, were investigated, and we did find a role for the I-II linker (S525) in the PKA-dependent control of bursting. However, interestingly, this is not the only cytoplasmic segment implicated in our work. We find an equal contribution of an N-terminal serine (Ser36). Furthermore, the functional roles of these loops depend critically on the sequence of the C-terminal domain, suggesting that interactions among multiple cytoplasmic components of the channel contribute to the functional consequences of PKA-dependent modulation of the channel. Interestingly, similar interactions have been predicted previously for cytoplasmic loops and for direct interactions between the C- and N-terminal domains of rat skeletal (rSkM1) sodium channels (39Zhang H. Kolibal S. Vanderkooi J.M. Cohen S.A. Kallen R.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1467: 406-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Clearly our data suggest a similar possibility for Nav1.5 channels. Insight from Structural Studies of the Nav1.5 C-terminal Domain—A recent computational and experimental investigation of the secondary structure of the Nav1.5 C-terminal domain provided evidence for a proximal region of the C terminus that is highly structured and enriched in negative changes (20Cormier J.W. Rivolta I. Tateyama M. Yang A.S. Kass R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9233-9241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Residue Asp1790 falls within this region, as does residue Tyr1795. More distal in the C-terminal domain is a putative helical positively charged region that, when truncated, results in promotion of channel bursting (20Cormier J.W. Rivolta I. Tateyama M. Yang A.S. Kass R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9233-9241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). PKA promotes bursting for Asp1790 mutants (D1790G and D1790K) but not Tyr1795 mutant channels (Y1795H and Y1795C), despite that fact that both residues 1790 and 1795 are included in first α helix (H1) of the C terminus (20Cormier J.W. Rivolta I. Tateyama M. Yang A.S. Kass R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9233-9241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). However, according to the structural model, these residues face opposite directions. Asp1790 faces extraglobular and Tyr1795 faces intraglobular regions. This model predicts that Asp1790 can interact with other unknown proteins or internal loops of the Na+ channel α subunit, but Tyr1795 cannot because of the asymmetry of their orientation. Because deletion of the negative charge at 1790 residue promotes PKA-dependent modulation of modal gating, this negative charge may play an important role in stabilizing the inactivation state through electrostatic interactions with cytoplasmic loops of the channel. In rat skeletal Na+ channels, an electrostatic interaction between the N terminus (13–30, negative-rich) and C terminus (1716–1737, positive-rich) has been suggested (39Zhang H. Kolibal S. Vanderkooi J.M. Cohen S.A. Kallen R.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1467: 406-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The finding that the charge of residue 1790 appears to have a distinct role in PKA-dependent modulation of channel bursting suggests that its orientation or location in the structured proximal portion of the C-terminal domain may confer privileged access to key structures responsible for channel inactivation. Na+ channel inactivation is due to rapid block of the inner mouth of the channel pore by the cytoplasmic linker between domains III and IV that occurs within milliseconds of membrane depolarization (3Stuhmer W. Conti F. Suzuki H. Wang X. Noda M. Yahagi N. Kubo H. Numa S. Nature. 1989; 339: 597-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (940) Google Scholar, 4West J.W. Patton D.E. Scheuer T. Wang Y. Goldin A.L.

Science. 1988; 241: 1658-1661Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar), and bursting is an inactivation-deficient or unstable state (10Clancy C.E. Rudy Y. Nature. 1999; 400: 566-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). Modulation of bursting, or inactivation, thus suggests modification of these interactions. Our data implicate the N-terminal domain (Ser36), the I-II linker (Ser525), as well as the C-terminal domain (Asp1790) as modulators of this process. Complex interactions between the cytoplasmic loops of the channel, which may be altered either by mutation and or phosphorylation state, provide a broad range of possibilities for the roles of sympathetic-mediated modulation of Na+ channels in the heart. In summary, our data indicate that cAMP-dependent modulation of sodium channel gating can be affected by mutations in regions of the channel, such as the C-terminal domain, that do not directly contain PKA consensus sites and that the activity of endogenous kinases and phosphatases may contribute to channel activity recorded in heterologous expression systems.

https://openalex.org/W2168413632,"The pluripotency and high proliferative capacity of embryonic stem (ES) cells (1-3) makes them an attractive source of different cell types for biomedical research and cell replacement therapies. A major prerequisite for these applications is the availability of a homogeneous population of the desired cell type. However, ES cell-derived material contains, for example, undifferentiated cells, which can cause tumor formation after transplantation into the brain (4). To avoid such unwanted side effects, effective purification of distinct types of cells needs to be developed. Here, we describe an immunoisolation procedure to purify neurons from in vitro differentiated mouse ES cells using an antibody against the neuronal cell adhesion molecule L1 (5, 6). Our procedure yields a pure population of differentiated neurons, which are electrically excitable and form excitatory, glutamatergic, and inhibitory GABAergic synapses. The ability to highly purify ES cell-derived neurons will boost their molecular characterization and the further exploration of their therapeutic potential."

Secretin is a 27-residue peptide hormone with a diffuse pharmacophoric domain that binds to the secretin receptor, a prototypic member of the Class B family of G protein-coupled receptors. In this work, we have developed, characterized, and applied two new photolabile probes for this receptor, with sites for covalent attachment in peptide positions 12 and 14, surrounding the previously most informative site of affinity labeling of this receptor. The [Tyr10,(BzBz)Lys12]rat secretin-27 probe covalently labeled receptor residue Val6, whereas the [Tyr10,(BzBz)Lys14]rat secretin-27 probe labeled receptor residue Pro38. When combined with previous photoaffinity labeling data, there are now seven independent sets of constraints distributed throughout the peptide and receptor amino-terminal domain that can be used together to generate a new molecular model of the ligand-occupied secretin receptor. The aminoterminal domain of this receptor presented a stable platform for peptide ligand interaction, with the amino terminus of the peptide hormone extended toward the transmembrane helix domain of the receptor.

All of the natural ligands for the Class B G protein-coupled receptors, like secretin, represent moderately long linear peptide hormones that, by first principles, are quite flexible and provide substantial challenges for determination of the appropriate conformation for receptor docking. Although several of these ligands have had solution structures established by NMR (3Clore G.M. Nilges M. Brunger A. Gronenborn A.M. Eur. J.

Additionally, the amino-terminal domain of receptors in this family are large (greater than 120 residues), with complex topology, including three conserved disulfide bonds that are critical for ligand binding (1Ulrich C.D.

Attempts to gain insight into these structures have come from studies in which the non-glycosylated amino-terminal regions of the parathyroid hormone receptor and the corticotropin-releasing factor receptor have been produced in Escherichia coli, denatured, refolded, and had their disulfide bonds determined directly (5Grauschopf U.

Of interest, the pattern of disulfide bonding for the amino terminus of the corticotropin-releasing factor receptor determined under these conditions was different from that evaluated previously by mutagenesis of the entire intact receptor (7Qi L.J. Leung A.T. Xiong Y. Marx K.A. Abou-Samra A.B. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12442-12448Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The recent analysis by Taylor et al. (8Taylor W.R. Munro R.E.J.

Thus, even the constraints for molecular modeling of disulfide bonding are not as certain as would be optimal. Using the direct approach of intrinsic photoaffinity labeling, we have previously established five distinct spatial approximations between residues in various positions throughout the pharmacophoric domain of secretin and its receptor (9Dong M.

Of note, four of these five constraints, experimentally established for secretin peptide residues 6, 18, 22, and 26 (of 27 residues), covalently labeled residues within the first 36 residues at the distal end of the amino terminus of the receptor (9Dong M.

Therefore, this extensive set of data was only able to support a very limited and focused molecular model of this most distal region of the secretin receptor, and even that conformation was not firmly established (12Dong M. Zang M.W. Pinon D.I. Li Z. Lybrand T.P. Miller L.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 2490-2501Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Only the most recent study, labeling through peptide residue 13, established a covalent bond with a distinct region of the amino terminus of the receptor, at residue 103 (13Zang M.W. Dong M.Q.

This provided adequate information to propose a preliminary model of the entire amino-terminal domain of this receptor (13Zang M.W. Dong M.Q. Pinon D.I. Ding X.Q. Hadac E.M. Li Z.J. Lybrand T.P. Miller L.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 63: 993-1001Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). As part of the current project, we have extensively refined and expanded that model, and have experimentally tested it by performing two additional series of photoaffinity labeling experiments with new probes on either side of this most informative site. These probes incorporated photolabile residues into positions 12 or 14. Both bound specifically and saturably to the secretin receptor where they stimulated full biological responses. Each of these probes also covalently labeled this receptor in single, unique, and distinct residues. These residues were quite close to the sites predicted by the working model, and were subsequently incorporated into this model to further refine it. The seven photoaffinity labeling cross-links, together with the three disulfide bonds in the receptor amino-terminal domain, constitute a significant set of topological constraints for the ligand-receptor complex. Although there is still considerable conformational flexibility in both peptide and receptor, this set of ten constraints reduces dramatically the number of viable three-dimensional models for the peptide-receptor complex that must be considered. The resulting models provide additional insight into the nature of the ligand-receptor interaction for Class B G protein-coupled receptors and suggest new experiments to further test the conformation and the molecular basis of agonist-induced activation of this receptor.

Chem. 1987; 262: 13850-13856Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All other reagents were of analytical grade. Peptides—The photolabile secretin probes used in this study were [Tyr10,(BzBz)Lys12]rat secretin-27 ((BzBz)Lys12 probe) and [Tyr10, (BzBz)Lys14]rat secretin-27 ((BzBz)Lys14 probe). They were designed to incorporate a photolabile residue p-benzoylbenzoyl-l-lysine ((BzBz)Lys) to replace Arg12 and Gln14 of secretin, respectively. Like photolabile secretin probes used previously (9Dong M. Wang Y. Pinon D.I. Hadac E.M. Miller L.J. J. Biol.

Together with other peptides used in this study, i.e. rat secretin-27, [Tyr10]rat secretin-27, and the HA peptide, they were synthesized by solid-phase techniques and purified to homogeneity by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (15Powers S.P. Pinon D.I. Miller L.J. Int. J. Pept. Protein. Res. 1988; 31: 429-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The expected molecular masses of the probes were verified by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry. The radioligand used for binding (i.e. [Tyr10]rat secretin-27) and the (BzBz)Lys12 and the (BzBz)Lys14 probes were radioiodinated oxidatively with Na125I (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Boston, MA). Upon exposure to the solid-phase oxidant, IODO-BEADs, for 15 s, the resulting product was purified by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography to yield specific radioactivities of 2000 Ci/mmol (15Powers S.P.

These stable CHO cell lines were cultured at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 environment on Falcon tissue culture plasticware in Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 5% Fetal Clone-2 (HyClone Laboratories, Logan, UT). Cells were passaged twice a week and lifted mechanically before use. Development of a new secretin receptor mutant that incorporated an additional site for CNBr cleavage in a key position was necessary for the current work. This represented mutation of Pro8 to Met (P8M), prepared using an oligonucleotide-directed approach with the Quik-Change™ site-directed mutagenesis kit from Stratagene. The P8M secretin receptor construct was subcloned into the eukaryotic expression vector, pcDNA3 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), and its sequence was confirmed by direct DNA sequencing (17Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52741) Google Scholar). The P8M secretin receptor construct was expressed transiently in COS cells (American Type Cell Collection, Manassas, VA) after transfection using a modification of the DEAE-dextran method (18Holtmann M.H. Ganguli S. Hadac E.M. Dolu V. Miller L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14944-14949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). These cells were harvested mechanically 72 h after transfection. Plasma membranes from receptor-bearing cells were prepared using a procedure that has been well described, which included cell disruption by Dounce homogenization and sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation (19Hadac E.M. Ghanekar D.V. Holicky E.L. Pinon D.I. Dougherty R.W. Miller L.J. Pancreas. 1996; 13: 130-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Ligand Binding—This assay was used for characterization of the newly synthesized photolabile probes that were used in the current study. Briefly, increasing concentrations of the (BzBz)Lys12 or (BzBz)Lys14 probe (from 0 to 1 μm) were incubated with a constant amount of radioligand 125I-[Tyr10]rat secretin-27, and 5 μg enriched CHO-SecR plasma membranes for 1 h at room temperature in Krebs-Ringer-HEPES (KRH) medium (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 104 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm KH2PO4, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 2 mm CaCl2) containing 0.01% soybean trypsin inhibitor, and 0.2% bovine serum albumin. After incubation, bound and free radioligand were separated using a Skatron cell harvester (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) with receptor-binding glass-fiber filter mats that had been soaked in 0.3% Polybrene for 1 h, with the bound radioactivity being quantified in a γ-spectrometer. Non-specific binding was determined in the presence of 1 μm secretin and represented less than 20% of total radioligand in the incubation. The same assay was also utilized to characterize the binding activity of the COS cells transiently expressing the P8M secretin receptor construct. Binding curves were analyzed and plotted using the non-linear regression analysis program in the Prism software package (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). Binding kinetics were determined by analysis with the LIGAND program of Munson and Rodbard (20Munson P.J. Rodbard D. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 107: 220-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (7772) Google Scholar). Data are reported as the means ± S.E. of duplicate determinations from a minimum of three independent experiments. Biological Activity Assay—This was done by measuring the intracellular cAMP accumulation in CHO-SecR cells in response to stimulation by secretin or the photolabile analogues, representing either the (BzBz)Lys12 or the (BzBz)Lys14 probes, using reagents provided by Diagnostic Products Corp. (Los Angeles, CA). Briefly, Cells grown in 24-well plates were washed in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and stimulated by increasing concentrations (0–1 μm) of peptide for 30 min at 37 °C in KRH medium containing 1 mm 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, 0.01% soybean trypsin inhibitor, 0.1% bacitracin, and 0.2% bovine serum albumin. After incubation, cells were lysed by 6% perchloric acid, and cell lysates were then adjusted to pH 6.0 by adding 30% KHCO3 and cleared by centrifugation before being introduced into the assay tubes, as described previously (21Ganguli S.C. Park C.G. Holtmann M.H. Hadac E.M. Kenakin T.P. Miller L.J. J. Pharm. Exp. Ther. 1998; 286: 593-598PubMed Google Scholar). Radioactivity was quantified by scintillation counting in a liquid scintillation Beckman LS6000 counter. Assays were performed in duplicate and repeated in at least three independent experiments. Receptor Photoaffinity Labeling—Covalent labeling of the secretin receptor was achieved as described previously (9Dong M. Wang Y. Pinon D.I. Hadac E.M. Miller L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 903-909Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In brief, 50 μg of enriched receptor-bearing plasma membranes were incubated with 0.1 nm125I-[Tyr10,(BzBz)Lys12]rat secretin-27 or 125I-[Tyr10,(BzBz)Lys14]rat secretin-27 in the presence of increasing concentrations of secretin (from 0 to 1 μm) in KRH buffer in the dark for 1 h at room temperature. This was then photolyzed for 30 min at 4 °C in a Rayonet photochemical reactor (Southern New England Ultraviolet Company, Hamden, CT) equipped with 3500-Å lamps. Membranes were then washed, solubilized in Laemmli SDS sample buffer, and resolved by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels (22Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207445) Google Scholar). Labeled proteins were visualized by autoradiography. To scale up labeled receptor for further purification and peptide mapping, larger amounts of receptor-bearing membranes (200 μg) and 125I-[Tyr10,(BzBz)Lys12]rat secretin-27 or 125I-[Tyr10,(BzBz)Lys14]rat secretin-27 (0.5 nm) were incubated in the absence of competing secretin prior to photolysis. Peptide Mapping of the Site of Covalent Labeling—After gel electrophoresis, labeled bands prepared in large scale were cut out, eluted, lyophilized, and ethanol-precipitated, before being used for deglycosylation and peptide mapping by chemical and enzymatic cleavage. Deglycosylation of labeled secretin receptor was performed with endoglycosidase F under the conditions we previously reported (19Hadac E.M. Ghanekar D.V. Holicky E.L. Pinon D.I. Dougherty R.W. Miller L.J. Pancreas. 1996; 13: 130-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). CNBr and endoproteinase Lys-C were used separately and in sequence to cleave the labeled secretin receptor and its fragments, following procedures described previously (9Dong M. Wang Y. Pinon D.I. Hadac E.M. Miller L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 903-909Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Products of cleavage were resolved on 10% NuPAGE gels using MES buffer system (Invitrogen), with labeled products being visualized by autoradiography. The apparent molecular masses of labeled receptor fragments were determined by interpolation on a plot of the mobility of Multimark™ protein standards (Invitrogen) versus the log values of their apparent masses. Immunoprecipitation of labeled intact and digested HA-tagged receptor constructs using anti-HA monoclonal antibody was performed to determine the identities of some of the labeled fragments using procedures that we described previously (13Zang M.W. Dong M.Q. Pinon D.I. Ding X.Q. Hadac E.M. Li Z.J. Lybrand T.P. Miller L.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 63: 993-1001Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Identification of the Covalently Labeled Residues—Purified CNBr and endoproteinase Lys-C fragments from the radiolabeled secretin receptor were utilized for identification of the residues labeled with the (BzBz)Lys12 and the (BzBz)Lys14 probes by radiochemical Edman degradation sequencing. Receptor fragments containing cysteine residues were immobilized through their sulfhydryl groups utilizing the bifunctional cross-linker, m-maleimidobenzoyl-N-hydroxysulfosuccinimide ester, and N-(2-aminoethyl-1)-3-aminopropyl glass beads. Edman degradation was manually repeated up to eight cycles, in a manner that has been previously reported in detail (23Ji Z. Hadac E.M. Henne R.M. Patel S.A. Lybrand T.P. Miller L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24393-24401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 24Hadac E.M. Pinon D.I. Ji Z. Holicky E.L. Henne R.M. Lybrand T.P. Miller L.J. J. Biol.

Molecular Modeling of the Receptor Amino-terminal Region—Multiple sequence alignment was performed for Class B G protein-coupled receptors to ascertain those family members with significant sequence identity (>30%) and sequence similarity (>50%) to the amino-terminal domain of the secretin receptor. The NCBI, SwissProt, and EMBL databases were then searched for homologues of each of the closely related Class B family amino-terminal domains. Homologues with experimentally determined three-dimensional structures were assessed for suitability as templates in a homology modeling exercise using structure-based sequence alignment of the secretin receptor amino terminus. Three-dimensional homology models for the rat secretin receptor amino terminus were then built. Multiple sequence alignments were generated using the AMPS package (25Livingstone C.D. Barton G.J. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1993; 9: 745-756PubMed Google Scholar), and FASTA3 was used for all sequence data base searches (26Pearson W.R. Lipman D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2444-2448Crossref PubMed Scopus (9388) Google Scholar). Structure-based sequence alignments were generated using the program MOE with the Blossum62 scoring matrix (27Chemical Computing Group (2001) MOE 2001.01, Chemical Computing Group, Inc., Montreal, CanadaGoogle Scholar). Homology models were created using Modeler (28Sali A. Blundell T.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 779-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (10613) Google Scholar). Final models were assessed for stereochemical quality and side-chain packing profiles using the PROCHECK (29Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar) and QPACK programs (30Gregoret L.M. Cohen F.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 211: 959-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Ligand Docking to the Receptor Amino-terminal Domain—The NMR-derived solution structure of secretin (3Clore G.M. Nilges M. Brunger A. Gronenborn A.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 171: 479-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) was manually docked close to its putative binding site in the three-dimensional model, guided by our previous photoaffinity labeling data (9Dong M.

The docked complex model was then subjected to 100 steps of in vacuo energy minimization with no constraints, followed by brief (5 ps), low temperature (40 K) molecular dynamics simulations using a generalized Born model. Five constraints (Table I) were applied to impose peptide-receptor contacts determined from previous photoaffinity labeling experiments during the MD simulation, using a harmonic restraining potential with a 20 kcal/mol/Å force constant. The last configuration from the simulation was then energy minimized to generate a final structure for the complex. This same protocol was used to refine additional models that included the three putative disulfide bonds as extra topological constraints (5Grauschopf U. Lilie H. Honold K. Wozny M. Reusch D.

Both metric matrix and random embedding methods were used to generate three-dimensional structures. For the random embedding procedure, 75,000 iterations were employed for the embedding process, and 500 independent structures were generated by varying the initial seed value. To test the dependence of final structures on starting model conformations, fully extended and various random, compact initial conformations were used for both the receptor amino-terminal and peptide hormone fragments. After embedding, resultant structures were refined with 200 steps of energy minimization. In addition to the ten experimental constraints from cross-linking and disulfide binding patterns, empirical distance constraints were included to impose trans peptide bond conformations for the entire structure."

https://openalex.org/W2021387645,"Previous studies indicated that the determinants of coenzyme specificity in ferredoxin-NADP+ reductase (FNR) from Anabaena are situated in the 2′-phosphate (2′-P) NADP+ binding region, and also suggested that other regions must undergo structural rearrangements of the protein backbone during coenzyme binding. Among the residues involved in such specificity could be those located in regions where interaction with the pyrophosphate group of the coenzyme takes place, namely loops 155–160 and 261–268 in Anabaena FNR. In order to learn more about the coenzyme specificity determinants, and to better define the structural basis of coenzyme binding, mutations in the pyrophosphate and 2′-P binding regions of FNR have been introduced. Modification of the pyrophosphate binding region, involving residues Thr-155, Ala-160, and Leu-263, indicates that this region is involved in determining coenzyme specificity and that selected alterations of these positions produce FNR enzymes that are able to bind NAD+. Thus, our results suggest that slightly different structural rearrangements of the backbone chain in the pyrophosphate binding region might determine FNR specificity for the coenzyme. Combined mutations at the 2′-P binding region, involving residues Ser-223, Arg-224, Arg-233, and Tyr-235, in combination with the residues mentioned above in the pyrophosphate binding region have also been carried out in an attempt to increase the FNR affinity for NAD+/H. However, in most cases the analyzed mutants lost the ability for NADP+/H binding and electron transfer, and no major improvements were observed with regard to the efficiency of the reactions with NAD+/H. Therefore, our results confirm that determinants for coenzyme specificity in FNR are also situated in the pyrophosphate binding region and not only in the 2′-P binding region. Such observations also suggest that other regions of the protein, yet to be identified, might also be involved in this process.

Although the general catalytic mechanism of many NAD(P)+/H-dependent flavoenzymes is known, and despite the fact that the only difference between the two coenzymes is the 2′-P of the NADP+/H, the mechanism by which each enzyme is able to recognize either NAD+/H or NADP+/H is not yet completely understood (1.Medina M.

Previous studies on Anabaena FNR indicated that all of the residues interacting with the 2′-P are not involved to the same extent in determining coenzyme specificity (1.Medina M. Luquita A. Tejero J.

Thus, whereas in Anabaena FNR Ser-223 (previous studies on the single S223D mutant) and Tyr-235 (previous studies on the Y235F and Y235A mutants) have been shown to be critical residues in determining NADP+/H orientation and specificity, Arg-224 and Arg-233 only provide secondary interactions (1.Medina M. Luquita A. Tejero J. Hermoso J.A. Mayoral T. Sanz-Aparicio J. Grever K. Gómez-Moreno C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11902-11912Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Moreover, it has also been shown that the determinants for coenzyme specificity are not provided solely by those residues directly interacting with the 2′-P. Thus, in pea FNR, as well as in related flavoenzymes containing an FNR module, it has been shown that a conserved aromatic side chain shields the flavin ring and occupies the putative position of the nicotinamide moiety during ET involving protein substrates. It has been shown that this amino acid in FNR, and in many members of the FNR family, occupies the terminal sequence position and modulates the enzyme NADP+/H binding affinity and selectivity (2.Elmore C.L.

Sequence and structural analysis of different members of the FNR family with affinity for either NADP+/H or NAD+/H suggested that the regions formed by residues 155–161 and 261–265 of Anabaena FNR might be involved in such conformational changes and, therefore, in coenzyme discrimination (see Fig. 1 and Table I in Ref. 1.Medina M. Luquita A. Tejero J. Hermoso J.A. Mayoral T. Sanz-Aparicio J. Grever K. Gómez-Moreno C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11902-11912Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Previous studies (1.Medina M. Luquita A. Tejero J. Hermoso J.A. Mayoral T. Sanz-Aparicio J. Grever K. Gómez-Moreno C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11902-11912Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) have shown that replacement by site-directed mutagenesis of the Anabaena FNR Thr-155 (a residue present in all NADP+/H-dependent members) by Gly (a residue present in all NAD+/H-dependent members) produced an increase in the affinity of FNR for NAD+/H while producing an important structural modification in the 261–265 loop. Moreover, the structure recently solved for an Anabaena FNR-NADP+ complex shows a conformation for the 261–265 loop more similar to that shown by the corresponding residues of several NAD+/H-dependent members of the FNR family than the conformation observed for this loop in free FNR (see Fig. 2 in Ref. 16.Hermoso J.A. Mayoral T. Faro M. Gómez-Moreno C. Sanz-Aparicio J. Medina M. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 319: 1133-1142Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In particular, a Pro residue from a “Pro-rich loop” in the NAD+/H-dependent enzymes is systematically placed in the uncomplexed enzyme at the same position that the critical Leu-263 residue occupies in the co-crystallized FNR-NADP+ complex upon NADP+ binding (Fig. 1A, CII) (16.Hermoso J.A. Mayoral T. Faro M. Gómez-Moreno C. Sanz-Aparicio J. Medina M. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 319: 1133-1142Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In addition, structural comparison of the Anabaena FNR-NADP+ complex, obtained after soaking native FNR crystals in an NADP+ solution (Fig. 1A, CI) (11.Serre L. Vellieux F.M.D. Medina M. Gómez-Moreno C. Fontecilla-Camps J.C. Frey M. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 263: 20-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), with the complex between NADP+ and a pea FNR mutant in which the C-terminal Tyr residue was replaced by Ser (Fig. 1A, CIII) (13.Deng Z. Aliverti A. Zanetti G. Arakaki A.K. Ottado J. Orellano E.G. Calcaterra N.B. Ceccarelli E.A. Carrillo N. Karplus A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 847-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) allows us to postulate a mechanism of coenzyme recognition and binding involving structural reorganization of the enzyme (16.Hermoso J.A. Mayoral T. Faro M. Gómez-Moreno C. Sanz-Aparicio J. Medina M. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 319: 1133-1142Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). However, these structural rearrangements observed in FNR upon coenzyme binding are already observed in the NAD+/H-dependent enzymes in the absence of coenzyme (16.Hermoso J.A. Mayoral T. Faro M. Gómez-Moreno C. Sanz-Aparicio J. Medina M. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 319: 1133-1142Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). These observations clearly suggest that the mechanisms for coenzyme recognition and complex reorganization in FNR, and therefore in NADP+/H-dependent members of the FNR family, are different from those of the NAD+/H-dependent enzymes. Thus, in the case of the FNR, it seems that the free enzyme possesses a large cavity to accommodate the 2′-P-AMP moiety of the coenzyme, which upon binding is reorganized in order to perfectly match the charge and shape of the adenine portion of the substrate. However, in the case of the NAD+/H-dependent family members, such a narrow cavity is already preformed in the free enzyme and probably does not need to undergo significant structural rearrangements in order to accommodate the adenine moiety of NAD+/H, as has been described for the case of the phthalate dioxygenase reductase-NADH complex (16.Hermoso J.A. Mayoral T. Faro M. Gómez-Moreno C. Sanz-Aparicio J. Medina M. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 319: 1133-1142Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 17.Correll C.C. Batie C.J. Ballou D.P. Ludwig M.L. Science. 1992; 258: 1604-1610Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Therefore, this cavity formation must contribute to the coenzyme specificity in the FNR family, which might be explained as a consequence of the nature of both the residues interacting directly with the 2′-P and the residues shaping the pocket that accommodates the pyrophosphate moiety. In the present study further site-directed mutagenesis studies have been carried out in these Anabaena FNR regions (Fig. 1) in order to clarify the subtle structural features that confer coenzyme specificity. The following groups of mutations on Anabaena FNR have been investigated (Fig. 1B): (a) single and combinational mutations in the pyrophosphate binding region involving residues Thr-155, Ala-160, and Leu-263; (b) combinational mutations at the 2′-P binding region involving residues Ser-223, Arg-224, Arg-233, and Tyr-235; and (c) simultaneous mutations at the pyrophosphate and the 2′-P-binding sites. The obtained binding, kinetic, and structural data have been compared with those of WT FNR, and other FNR mutants previously reported, in order to clarify the subtle structural features that confer coenzyme specificity to this enzyme. Oligonucleotide-directed Mutagenesis—Anabaena FNR site-directed mutants were prepared by two different methods. Some of the mutants were prepared by using the Transformer site-directed mutagenesis kit (Clontech) in combination with suitable synthetic oligonucleotides (1.Medina M. Luquita A. Tejero J. Hermoso J.A. Mayoral T. Sanz-Aparicio J. Grever K. Gómez-Moreno C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11902-11912Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) and by using as template a construct of the petH gene previously cloned into the expression vector pTrc99a (1.Medina M. Luquita A. Tejero J. Hermoso J.A. Mayoral T. Sanz-Aparicio J. Grever K. Gómez-Moreno C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11902-11912Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). A new construct, pET28-FNR, was also prepared by cloning the petH gene into the NcoI and HindIII sites of the pET-28a(+) vector (Novagen). The mutants prepared by using this latter construct as template were produced using the QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) with suitable oligonucleotides. The pTrc99a vectors with the desired mutation were used to transform the Escherichia coli PC strain 0225 (18.Medina M. Martínez-Júlvez M. Hurley J.K. Tollin G. Gómez-Moreno C. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 2715-2728Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), whereas the pET28-FNR vectors were transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3) Gold cells (Stratagene). Purification of Anabaena Ferredoxin and FNR Mutants—FNR mutants from pTrc99a vectors were purified from isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside-induced LB cultures as described previously (18.Medina M. Martínez-Júlvez M. Hurley J.K. Tollin G. Gómez-Moreno C. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 2715-2728Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). An analogous protocol was used for mutants of pET28-FNR, but cultures were grown at 30 °C for 24 h, and no isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added. Some of the mutants were not retained by the Cibacron blue gel and were purified by using a fast protein liquid chromatography system from Amersham Biosciences with a Mono-Q column (1.Medina M. Luquita A. Tejero J. Hermoso J.A. Mayoral T. Sanz-Aparicio J. Grever K. Gómez-Moreno C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11902-11912Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Recombinant WT Fd from Anabaena was prepared as described (19.Hurley J.K. Salamon Z. Meyer T.E. Fitch J.C. Cusanovich M.A. Markley J.L. Cheng H. Xia B. Chae Y.K. Medina M. Gómez-Moreno C. Tollin G. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9346-9354Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). UV-visible spectra and SDS-PAGE were used as purity criteria. Spectral Analysis—Ultraviolet/visible spectral analyses were carried out using either a Hewlett-Packard diode array 8452 spectrophotometer, a KONTRON Uvikon 860 spectrophotometer, or a KONTRON Uvikon 942 spectrophotometer. Circular dichroism was carried out on a Jasco 710 spectropolarimeter at room temperature. Far-UV spectra were carried out with either 0.7 μm protein in a 1-cm path length cuvette or 5 μm protein in a 1-mm path length cuvette. Protein concentrations for the near-UV/visible spectra were between 3 and 5 μm in a 1-cm path length cuvette. Photoreduction of different FNR forms was performed at room temperature in an anaerobic cuvette containing 32–65 μm FNR samples and 3 μm dRf in 50 mm Tris/HCl buffer, pH 8, under anaerobic conditions as described previously (1.Medina M. Luquita A. Tejero J. Hermoso J.A. Mayoral T. Sanz-Aparicio J. Grever K. Gómez-Moreno C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11902-11912Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Dissociation constants of the complexes between oxidized FNR mutants and either NADP+ or NAD+ were measured by difference spectroscopy as described previously (1.Medina M. Luquita A. Tejero J. Hermoso J.A. Mayoral T. Sanz-Aparicio J. Grever K. Gómez-Moreno C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11902-11912Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Errors in the estimated Kd values were ±15%. Enzymatic Assays—Diaphorase activity, assayed with 2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol as artificial electron acceptor, was determined for all the FNR mutants in 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, as described previously (1.Medina M. Luquita A. Tejero J. Hermoso J.A. Mayoral T. Sanz-Aparicio J. Grever K. Gómez-Moreno C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11902-11912Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In the case of the diaphorase reactions studied with NADH, high enzyme concentrations (0.5–9 μm) were required in order to detect and follow their activity. Therefore, in some of these cases the coenzyme concentration used was only 100 times higher than that of the corresponding enzyme. This was also the case for all FNR forms containing the S223D mutation when using NADPH, where the enzyme concentration in the cuvettes was 4 μm. When assaying the reaction of the other FNR enzymes with NADPH, enzyme concentrations in the range 3–500 nm were used. Errors in the estimated values of Km and kcat were ±25 and ±10%, respectively. Stopped-flow Kinetic Measurements—Fast electron transfer (ET) processes between NADPH or NADH and the different FNRox mutants were studied by stopped-flow methodology in 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, under anaerobic conditions using an Applied Photophysics SX17.MV spectrophotometer interfaced with an Acorn 5000 computer using the SX18.MV software of Applied Photophysics as described previously (1.Medina M. Luquita A. Tejero J. Hermoso J.A. Mayoral T. Sanz-Aparicio J. Grever K. Gómez-Moreno C. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 2715-2728Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The apparent observed rate constants (kapp) were calculated by fitting the data to a mono- or bi-exponential equation. Errors in their estimated values were ±15%. Final FNR concentrations were kept between 6 and 11 μm. Unless otherwise stated final NADPH concentrations were in the range of 160–200 μm, whereas NADH was used at ∼2.5 mm. The time course of the reactions was followed at 460 nm, although other wavelengths, 340 and 600 nm, were also analyzed. Laser Flash Photolysis Measurements—The laser flash photolysis and the photochemical systems that generate reduced protein in situ were as described previously (18.Medina M. Martínez-Júlvez M.

Samples containing 0.1 mm dRf and 1 mm EDTA in 4 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, were deaerated in a long stem 1-cm path length cuvette by bubbling with H2O-saturated argon gas for 1 h. Microliter volumes of concentrated protein were introduced through a rubber septum using a Hamilton syringe under anaerobic conditions. Generally, 4–10 flashes were averaged. Kinetic traces were analyzed using a computer fitting routine (Kinfit, OLIS, Bogart, GA). Experiments were performed at room temperature. Crystal Growth, Data Collection, and Structure Refinement—Crystals of the L263P, T155G/A160T, and T155G/A160T/L263P FNR mutants were grown by the hanging drop method. The 5-μl droplets consisted of 2 μl of 0.75 mm protein solution buffered with 10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 1 μl of unbuffered β-octyl glucoside at 5% (w/v), and 2 μl of reservoir solution containing 18–20% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 6000, 20 mm ammonium sulfate, 0.1 m Mes/NaOH, pH 5.0. The droplets were equilibrated against 1 ml of reservoir solution at 20 °C. Under these conditions crystals grew to a maximum size of 0.8 × 0.4 × 0.4 mm within 1–7 days in the presence of phase separation caused by the detergent. Cryoprotectant additives were tested in order to find suitable conditions to use cryotechniques. Finally, crystals were soaked in a solution containing 70–75% of mother liquor and 25–30% glycerol for 1 min. One crystal for each FNR mutant was mounted in a fiber loop and frozen at 100 K with a cryogenic system in a nitrogen stream. X-ray data were collected on a Mar Research (Germany) IP area detector using graphite monochromated CuKα radiation generated by an Enraf-Nonius rotating anode generator to a maximum resolution of 1.6 Å. Crystals belong to the P65 hexagonal space group. The Vm is 3.0 Å3/Da with one FNR molecule in the asymmetric unit and 60% solvent content. All data sets were processed with MOSFLM (22.Leslie A.G.W. Helliwell J.R. Machin P.A. Papiz M.Z. Proceedings of the CCP4 Study Weekend. SERC Daresbury Laboratory, Warrington, UK1987: 39-50Google Scholar) and scaled and reduced with SCALA from the CCP4 package (23.Collaborative Computational Project Number 4 Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19797) Google Scholar). The L263P, T155G/A160T, and T155G/A160T/L263P structures were solved by molecular replacement using the program AmoRe (24.Navaza J. Acta Cryst. Sect. A. 1994; 50: 157-163Crossref Scopus (5030) Google Scholar) on the basis of the 1.8-Å resolution native FNR model (11.Serre L. Vellieux F.M.D. Medina M. Gómez-Moreno C. Fontecilla-Camps J.C. Frey M. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 263: 20-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) without the FAD cofactor. An unambiguous single solution for the rotation and translation functions was obtained for all proteins. These solutions were refined by the fast rigid body refinement program FITING (25.Castellano E. Oliva G. Navaza J. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1992; 25: 281-284Crossref Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The models were subjected to alternate cycles of conjugate gradient refinement with the program X-PLOR (26.Brünger A.T. X-PLOR: A System for X-ray Crystallography and NMR. Version 3.851. Yale University Press, New Haven, CT1993Google Scholar) and manual model building with the software package O (27.Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13014) Google Scholar). Finally, water molecules were added. The resulting model was again subjected to more cycles of positional and B factor refinement. The final models comprise residues 9–303 (the first 8 residues were not observed in the electron density map), one FAD moiety, oneSO42- molecule, and solvent molecules. Relevant refinement parameters are presented in Table I. The coordinates and structure factors for all these mutants have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank with accession numbers 1OGJ, 1OGI, and 1H42 for the L263P, T155G/A160T, and T155G/A160T/L263P mutants, respectively.Table IStructure determination statisticsData collectionFNR formT155G/A160T/L263PT155G/A160TL263PTemperature (K)100100100X-ray sourceRotating anodeRotating anodeRotating anodeSpace groupP65P65P65Cell a, b, c (Å)85.81; 85.81; 96.1387.32; 87.32; 96.5587.26; 87.26; 96.69Resolution range (Å)31.94-2.1520.49-1.6320.49-1.63No. unique reflections21,60550,90251,351Completeness of data (%) All data98.998.999.8 Outer shell98.9 (2.00-2.15Å)98.9 (1.73-1.63Å)99.8 (1.73-1.63Å) RsymaRsym = Σhkl Σi |Il - 〈I〉|/Σhkl Σi 〈I〉.0.0950.0670.053Refinements statistics Resolution range (Å)14.86-2.1520.5-1.619.9-1.6 No. protein atoms233623372337 No. hetero atoms585858 No. solvent atoms280358355 RfactorbRfactor = ||Fo| - |Fc||/|Fo| × 100.

Open table in a new tab Expression and Purification of the Different FNR Mutants— The level of expression in E. coli of all the mutated FNR forms was judged to be similar to that of the recombinant WT protein. All of the mutants were obtained in homogeneous form and in amounts suitable to perform the demanding characterization studies described herein. FNR forms containing the S223D mutation and also those with more than three mutations in the 2′-P interaction region interacted weakly with the Cibacron blue column (1.Medina M. Luquita A. Tejero J.

Spectral Properties—No major differences were detected in the UV-visible absorption or in the near-UV or visible CD spectra of any of the FNR forms (not shown). Therefore, no major structural perturbations appear to have been introduced by the mutations in the FAD environment, and the extinction coefficient of Anabaena WT FNR (9.4 mm–1 cm–1 at 458 nm) (28.Pueyo J.J. Gómez-Moreno C. Prep. Biochem. 1991; 21: 191-204PubMed Google Scholar) has been assumed herein for all the FNR mutants. The far-UV CD spectra showed only a slight reduction of the 208 nm peak in two mutants, T155G/R224Q/R233L/Y235F and T155G/S223D/R224Q/R233L/Y235F, indicating that only very subtle modifications, if any, have occurred in the protein folding because of the introduce"

https://openalex.org/W2075058272,"A reconstituted in vitro bacteriophage T4 DNA replication system was studied on a synthetic 70-mer minicircle substrate. This substrate was designed so that dGMP and dCMP were exclusively incorporated into the leading and the lagging strand, respectively. This design allows the simultaneous and independent measurement of the leading and lagging strand synthesis. In this paper, we report our results on the characterization of the 70-mer minicircle substrate. We show here that the minicircle substrate supports coordinated leading and lagging strand synthesis under the experimental conditions employed. The rate of the leading strand fork movement was at an average of approximately 150 nucleotides/s. This rate decreased to less than 30 nucleotides/s when the helicase was omitted from the reaction. These results suggest that both the holoenzyme and the primosome can be simultaneously assembled onto the minicircle substrate. The lagging strand synthesized on this substrate is of an average of 1.5 kb, and the length of the Okazaki fragments increased with decreasing [rNTPs]. The proper response of the Okazaki fragment size toward the change of the priming signal further indicates a functional replisome assembled on the minicircle template. The effects of various protein components on the leading and lagging strand synthesis were also studied. The collective results indicate that coordinated strand synthesis only takes place within certain protein concentration ranges. The optimal protein levels of the proteins that constitute the T4 replisome generally bracket the concentrations of the same proteins in vivo. Omission of the primase has little effect on the rate of dNMP incorporation or the rate of the fork movement on the leading strand within the first 30 s of the reaction. This inhibition only becomes significant at later times of the reaction and may be associated with the accumulation of single-stranded DNA leading to the collapse of active replisomes."
https://openalex.org/W2037179957,"Induction of the Saccharomyces MAL structural genes encoding maltose permease and maltase requires the MAL activator, a DNA-binding transcription activator. Genetic analysis of MAL activator mutations suggested that protein folding and stability play an important role in MAL activator regulation and led us to explore the role of the Hsp90 molecular chaperone complex in the regulation of the MAL activator. Strains carrying mutations in genes encoding components of the Hsp90 chaperone complex, hsc82Δ hsp82-T101I and hsc82Δ cpr7Δ, are defective for maltase induction and exhibit significantly reduced growth rates on media containing a limiting concentration of maltose (0.05%). This growth defect is suppressed by providing maltose in excess. Using epitope-tagged alleles of the MAL63 MAL activator, we showed that Mal63p levels are drastically reduced following depletion of cellular Hsp90. Overexpression (∼3-fold) of Mal63p in the hsc82Δ hsp82-T101I and hsc82Δ cpr7Δ strains suppresses their Mal– growth phenotype, suggesting that Mal63p levels are limiting for maltose utilization in strains with abrogated Hsp90 activity. Consistent with this, the half-life of Mal63p is significantly shorter in the hsc82Δ cpr7Δ strain (reduced about 6-fold) and modestly affected in the Hsp90-ts strain (reduced about 2-fold). Most importantly, triple hemagglutinin-tagged Mal63p protein is found in association with Hsp90 as demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation. Taken together, these results identify the inducible MAL activator as a client protein of the Hsp90 molecular chaperone complex and point to a critical role for chaperone function in alternate carbon source utilization in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Induction of the Saccharomyces MAL structural genes encoding maltose permease and maltase requires the MAL activator, a DNA-binding transcription activator. Genetic analysis of MAL activator mutations suggested that protein folding and stability play an important role in MAL activator regulation and led us to explore the role of the Hsp90 molecular chaperone complex in the regulation of the MAL activator.

In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, maltose fermentation requires maltose permease, a proton symporter that transports maltose across the plasma membrane; maltase, an α-glucosidase that hydrolyzes maltose to produce glucose; and the MAL activator, a DNA-binding transcription activator (reviewed in Refs. 1Needleman R.B.

Genet. 1999; 36: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Maltose-induced expression of maltase and maltose permease requires the MAL activator and maltose permease, and strains lacking either gene are noninducible (3Needleman R.B. Kaback D.B. Dubin R.A.

Medintz I. Michels C.A. Eukaryotic Cell. 2002; 1: 696-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) showed that intracellular maltose is sufficient to stimulate induction, thereby demonstrating that the role of the permease in induction is simply to provide sufficient intracellular inducer to activate the maltose sensor. The maltose sensor has not been identified, but the MAL activator is a candidate. The genes encoding maltose permease, maltase, and the MAL activator are clustered in a complex MAL locus. S. cerevisiae yeast strains can carry anywhere from one to five unlinked copies of a MAL locus, named MAL1–4 and MAL6, which map to sites near the telomere of different chromosomes (5Charron M.J. Read E Haut S.R. Michels C.A. Genetics. 1989; 122: 307-316Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The presence of any one of these five loci is sufficient for maltose fermentation. All of the five MAL loci are highly homologous both structurally and functionally. The genes encoding maltose permease and maltase share a bi-directional promoter that contains the DNA-binding site of the MAL activator, thereby providing for the coordinate expression of these maltose utilization enzymes (2Hu Z.

Mal63p is 470 residues in length and contains a six-cysteine zinc finger DNA-binding domain in the N-terminal ∼60–100 residues, a single transcription activation domain in approximately residues 60–250, and a C-terminal regulatory domain in approximately residues 250–470 (2Hu Z.

Genetics. 1997; 146: 1287-1298Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our genetic studies of the MAL activator suggest that protein folding and stability play important roles in MAL activator regulation (2Hu Z. Gibson A.W. Kim J.H. Wojciechowicz L.A. Zhang B. Michels C.A. Curr. Genet. 1999; 36: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 8Gibson A.W. Wojciechowicz L.A. Danzi S.E. Zhang B. Kim J.H. Hu Z. Michels C.A.

Characterization of constitutive alleles of the MAL activator localized the maltose-responsive regulatory domain to the C-terminal ∼200 residues and demonstrated that this region is a negative regulator of MAL activator function. mal64 is a nonfunctional homologue of MAL63 but can be activated to a constitutive MAL activator by mutation (11Dubin R.A. Charron M.J. Haut S.R. Needleman R.B. Michels C.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 1027-1035Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). These MAL64-C mutations are nonsense mutations at codons 282 and 307 (8Gibson A.W. Wojciechowicz L.A. Danzi S.E. Zhang B. Kim J.H. Hu Z. Michels C.A. Genetics. 1997; 146: 1287-1298Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The sequence of the MAL activator constitutive mutants MAL23-C and MAL43-C of the MAL2 and MAL4 loci, respectively, reported in Gibson et al. (8Gibson A.W. Wojciechowicz L.A. Danzi S.E. Zhang B. Kim J.H. Hu Z. Michels C.A. Genetics. 1997; 146: 1287-1298Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) contain multiple sequence alterations located largely in the C-terminal regulatory domain. Danzi et al. (9Danzi S.E. Zhang B. Michels C.A. Curr. Genet. 2000; 38: 233-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) used in vitro mutagenesis to localize those residues in the MAL activator that are important for negative regulation. They identified clustered alterations in three regions (residues 250–307, 343–357, and 419–461), and the introduction of multiple alterations in any one of these regions fully relieves negative regulation by this C-terminal domain. They also found that other sites throughout the protein could modulate the constitutive phenotype of mutations in these regions. But the C-terminal region also plays a positive role in MAL activator induction. Charged cluster to alanine scanning mutagenesis of this C-terminal negative regulatory domain of Mal63p produced a series of noninducible alleles that alter residues in regions adjacent to or overlapping two of the three negative regulatory regions defined by Danzi et al. (9Danzi S.E. Zhang B. Michels C.A. Curr. Genet. 2000; 38: 233-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 10Danzi S.E. Bali M. Michels C.A. Curr. Genet. 2003; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Taken together, this genetic analysis suggests that conformational changes involving complex protein-protein interactions regulate MAL activator activity. All efforts to identify interactions between different domains of Mal63p using two-hybrid analysis were unsuccessful, and Hu et al. (2Hu Z. Gibson A.W. Kim J.H. Wojciechowicz L.A. Zhang B. Michels C.A. Curr. Genet. 1999; 36: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) proposed that the interactions were likely to be intermolecular. The well documented role for the Hsp90 molecular chaperone complex in the inducer binding and regulation of other transcription activators such as the steroid hormone receptors raised the possibility that the Hsp90 chaperone complex could be a candidate for this MAL activator-interacting protein(s) and thus may be involved in the maltose stimulation of the MAL activator. The results reported here explore this possibility. Hsp90 is a highly conserved, abundantly expressed, essential protein in eukaryotes that is localized to the cytoplasm and nucleus (specific references may be found in Refs. 12Pratt W.B. Toft D.O.

Hsp90 is the key component of a large complex of proteins, many of them molecular chaperones, that function together assisting certain proteins to achieve an activated conformation in response to external or physiological signals. Despite its abundance, Hsp90 is unlikely to be required for de novo folding of the bulk of newly synthesized proteins. Instead it appears to play a role in the maturation of a specific set of newly synthesized proteins, so-called client or substrate proteins, and in the refolding and assembly of misfolded proteins that accumulate in cells following exposure to mild heat shock or other stresses. Therefore, Hsp90 has both stress-related and housekeeping functions and, as such, plays an essential role in processes controlling cell growth and differentiation in unstressed cells. Many of the components of the Hsp90 chaperone complex are conserved both in structure and function from S. cerevisiae to mammals. In Saccharomyces this includes the following genes: HSC82 and HSP82 encode Hsp90; the SSA and SSB family of genes encode Hsp70 isoforms (21Chang H.-C.J. Lindquist S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24983-24988Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Bohen S.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3330-3339Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar); YDJ1 encodes Hsp40 (23Kimura Y.

Gaber R.F. Science. 1996; 274: 1713-1715Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar); CDC37 encodes p50Cdc37 (27Hunter T. Poon R.Y.C.

Chem. 1999; 274: 26654-26660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Saccharomyces does not encode a homologue of Hip/p48. HSC82 and CPR7 are constitutively expressed, whereas their homologues, HSP82 and CPR6, respectively, are stress-induced. Thus, although the different isoforms are functionally overlapping, they are differentially expressed and probably play distinct cellular roles. Hsp90 is an ATPase, and its ATPase activity is essential for its chaperone function (reviewed in Ref. 20Pratt W.B. Toft D.O. Exp. Biol. Med. 2003; 228: 111-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (1276) Google Scholar). Several of the components listed above, including Hsp70, Hsp40, Hip/p48, and Hop/p60, are involved in client protein selection and the assembly of the chaperone complex (reviewed in Ref. 20Pratt W.B. Toft D.O. Exp. Biol. Med. 2003; 228: 111-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (1276) Google Scholar). Others such as p23, p50Cdc37, and Aha1 modulate the ATPase activity of Hsp90. The immunophilins, which include cyclophilins and FBPK proteins, have peptidyl proline isomerase activity and tetratricopeptide repeat domains and work to modulate client protein maturation and activation. Saccharomyces has been used for the study of mammalian steroid hormone receptor activation (particularly glucocorticoid and androgen receptors) and Src protein kinase maturation. Neither of these proteins is a natural substrate of the yeast Hsp90 chaperone complex, and although much important information has been obtained, it would be valuable to identify and characterize endogenous yeast substrates. To date the only Saccharomyces proteins identified as substrates of the Hsp90 chaperone complex are Ste11 protein kinase, Gcn2 kinase, and the heme-regulated transcription activator HapI (30Louvion J.F. Abbas-Terki T. Picard D. Yeast. 1998; 9: 3071-3983Google Scholar, 31Donze O. Picard D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8422-8432Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 32Lee H.C. Hon T. Zhang L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7430-7437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Here we investigate the role of Hsp90 chaperone complex in MAL gene regulation. We find that in strains carrying mutations in components of the Hsp90 complex maltose-dependent MAL gene induction is defective. Depletion of Hsp90 causes the rapid loss of Mal63p MAL activator protein, and in Hsp90 chaperone mutant strains, Mal63p half-life is reduced up to 5-fold. Most significantly, Mal63 MAL activator immunoprecipitates with His-tagged Hsp90 from native cell extracts. Thus, the Saccharomyces MAL activator is shown to be a novel signal transducing protein client of the Hsp90 chaperone complex, further demonstrating the integration of chaperone function into nonstress cellular metabolism. Yeast Strains and Plasmids—The Saccharomyces strains used in this study are listed in Table I. Strain W303 carries naturally occurring defective copies of the MAL1 and MAL3 loci (33Han E.-K. Cotty F. Sottas C. Jiang H. Michels C.A. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 17: 1093-1107Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Both loci contain functional maltose permease and maltase genes, referred to as MAL11 (also known as AGT1) and MAL12, respectively, at MAL1, and MAL31 and MAL33, respectively, at MAL3. Sequences homologous to the MAL63 MAL activator gene are found at both MAL1 and MAL3, referred to as mal13 and mal33, respectively, but these genes are nonfunctional. Thus, strain W303 does not ferment maltose. Plasmid-borne copies of MAL63 complement the defective chromosomal copies of the MAL activator genes. Plasmid pMAL63 was constructed by subcloning the BamHI-SalI fragment carrying MAL63 on its native promoter into the Escherichia coli yeast/shuttle vector YCp50 as described by Gibson et al. (8Gibson A.W. Wojciechowicz L.A. Danzi S.E. Zhang B. Kim J.H. Hu Z. Michels C.A.

Gene (Amst.). 1995; 156: 119-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (1603) Google Scholar). Plasmid p414GPD of this series was used to construct p414GPD-MAL63/FLAG. It is a CEN vector containing the TRP1 selection marker and the promoter of TDH1, encoding glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, which is a highly expressed constitutive promoter. The MAL63 coding region was amplified by PCR using an upstream primer that inserts a BamHI site and the sequence encoding the FLAG epitope at the 5′ end of the MAL63 open reading frame (primer B11; Table II) and a downstream primer that inserts a SalI site immediately following the MAL63 termination codon (primer B5; Table II). The amplified BamHI-SalI fragment was inserted into the BamHI and SalI sites in the multiple cloning sequence of p414GPD creating a GPD promoter-MAL63/FLAG fusion gene and plasmid p414GPD-MAL63/FLAG.Table IIList of primersPrimerPrimer sequenceB115′-GGGGGATCCATGGATTATAAGGATGACGATGACAAGGGTATTGCGAAACAGTCTTGC-3′B55′-GGGGGTCGACAACGGCGTGAACAATAAA-3′KM-N5′-GGGGATCCAAAATGGGCGGCCGCATTGCGAAACAGTCTTGC-3′MB-45′-CCAAAATGGGCGGCCGCATCTTTTACC-3′MB-55′-CGCAATACCGCGGCCGCACTGAGCAG-3′ Open table in a new tab The FLAG tag sequence in plasmid p414GPD-MAL63/FLAG was replaced with a triple HA 1The abbreviations used are: HAhemagglutininPGKphosphoglycerol kinase. tag sequence to create plasmid p414GPD-MAL63/HA3 as follows. The fragment encoding the 5′ half of the MAL63 open reading frame was amplified using a 5′ primer (KM-N; Table II) that inserts a NotI site between codons 2 and 3 of MAL63 and a 3′ primer complementary to a sequence just downstream of the EcoRI site at codons 215/216 of MAL63. This amplified product was digested with BamHI and EcoRI and used to replace the BamHI-EcoRI fragment containing the 5′ end of the tagged MAL63 gene in p414GPD-MAL63/FLAG, thereby removing the FLAG sequence. A 115-base pair NotI fragment containing three copies of the sequences encoding the HA epitope was inserted into the NotI site in the proper orientation, creating a GPD promoter-MAL63/HA3 fusion gene and plasmid p414GPD-MAL63/HA3. hemagglutinin phosphoglycerol kinase. Plasmid p416GPD from the Mumberg et al. (34Mumberg D. Muller R. Funk M. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 156: 119-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (1603) Google Scholar) series contains URA3 as the selectable marker but is otherwise the same as p414. The SacI-KpnI fragment containing the entire GPD promoter-MAL63/HA3 tagged fusion gene was released from p414GPD-MAL63/HA3 by digestion with SacI and KpnI and inserted into SacI-KpnI-digested plasmid p416 to create plasmid p416GPD-MAL63/HA3. Vector plasmid p416TEF is another from the Mumberg et al. (34Mumberg D. Muller R. Funk M. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 156: 119-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (1603) Google Scholar) series. It is a CEN plasmid and contains URA3 as the selectable marker gene and the promoter of the TEF1 gene, a lower level constitutive promoter. The full MAL63 open reading frame was amplified by PCR using primer KM-N (Table II) as the 5′ primer, which inserts a NotI site between codons 2 and 3 of MAL63, and a 3′ primer complementary to the sequence just downstream of the natural MAL63 termination codon (B5; Table II). The amplified product was digested with BamHI and SalI and inserted into BamHI- and SalI-digested plasmid p416TEF to create a TEF1 promoter-MAL63 fusion gene. A 115-base pair NotI fragment containing three copies of the sequences encoding the HA epitope was amplified using primers MB-4 and MB-5 (Table II) from p414GPD-MAL63/HA3 and inserted into the NotI site of the TEF1 promoter-MAL63 fusion gene in the proper orientation producing a TEF1 promoter-MAL63/HA3 fusion gene and plasmid pTEF-MAL63/HA3. Preparation of Cell Extracts and Immunoblot Analysis—The strains were grown in the appropriate selective minimal medium to mid-log phase (A600 of 0.2–0.5). An aliquot of the culture, volume in milliliters approximately equal to 15 divided by A600, was harvested by filtration, washed with 50 mm KPO4 buffer, pH 7.4, plus 2% sodium azide, and frozen while still on the filter paper at –80 °C for at least 20 min. The frozen cells were defrosted and resuspended in 1 ml of 50 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.5, containing a mixture of protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science; complete, mini, EDTA-free protease Inhibitor tablets (catalogue number 1836170) plus Sigma yeast protease inhibitor mixture (catalogue number P8215)), pelleted by centrifugation, and resuspended in 300 μl of SB buffer. SB buffer is prepared by dissolving one tablet of Roche Applied Science protease inhibitor, 8 μl of Sigma yeast protease inhibitor mixture, 0.1 g of SDS, and a toothpick tip-full of sodium bisulfite in 2 ml of H2O. An equal volume of glass beads was added to the cell suspension, and the samples were vortexed at a medium speed at 4 °C for 20 min. The samples were placed in a 37 °C water bath for 20 min, after which an additional 50 μl of SB buffer was added to each sample, and the samples were vortexed again for 2 min at 4 °C. The glass beads were separated from the extract by centrifugation at 4 °C, and the supernatant was removed. The samples were boiled for 4 min and stored at –80 °C. The protein concentration of the cell extract was determined by the Lowry assay method. Western blot analysis was carried out using standard methods, and the proteins were detected using an Amersham Vistra ECF kit in which the secondary antibody is conjugated to a fluorescent dye. The signal was visualized using a Molecular Dynamics Storm 860 and quantitated using software provided by the manufacturer. This method allows relatively accurate quantitation of the signal that is linear over ∼5 logs. M2 anti-FLAG antibody was obtained from Sigma. The anti-Hsp90 antibody was a gift from Susan Lindquist. Phosphoglycerol kinase (PGK) was detected by anti-PGK antibody from Molecular Probes. PGK levels are relatively constant at different growth conditions, and thus PGK levels were used as a control to adjust for loading variations in those experiments in which accurate quantitation was needed. Co-immunoprecipitation—The tagged proteins were co-expressed in wild-type cells and grown in selective media. The cells were harvested, resuspended in a nondenaturing buffer containing 50 mm sodium molybdate and extensive protease inhibitors, and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. The protein extracts were made via glass bead lysis at 4 °C and quantitated by Lowry assay. 50 μg of extract was mixed with 2× sample loading buffer and boiled for 3 min. Approximately 1 mg of total cell extract was then combined with 100 μl of a 50% slurry of Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen) and incubated on ice for 15 min. The resin was washed twice with lysis buffer containing 5 mm imidazole and twice again with lysis buffer containing 10 mm imidazole. The remaining protein was eluted by boiling in sample buffer for 3 min. All of the protein samples were electrophoresed using 10% SDS-PAGE and electroblotted to nitrocellulose, and specific proteins were detected using the indicated antibodies and enhanced chemiluminescence. Maltase Assay—The cells were grown to mid-log, harvested by centrifugation, and resuspended in 0.5 ml of potassium phosphate buffer, and an equal volume of glass beads was added. The extracts were prepared by votexing the cell suspension three times for 1 min each, keeping the mixture cooled on ice. Maltase activity was measured in whole cell extracts as described in Dubin et al. (35Dubin R.A. Needleman R.B. Gossett D. Michels C.A. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 164: 605-610Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Activity is expressed as nmol of p-nitrophenol-α-glucopyranoside hydrolyzed per min/mg of protein. Protein concentration of the cell extracts was measured using the Bio-Rad protein assay dye reagent. The assay values are the averages of results from three independent transformants assayed in duplicate. Variation is ∼20%. Maltase Induction and Maltose Utilization Are Defective in Strains Carrying Mutations in Components of the Hsp90 Chaperone Complex—We investigated the effects of Hsp90 chaperone mutations using an isogenic strain series derived from strain W303 carrying mutations in the genes encoding the two differentially expressed Hsp90 isoforms, HSC82 and HSP82, or in the gene encoding the constitutively expressed cyclophilin isoform, CPR7. Strain hsc82Δ (hsc82Δ HSP82) lacks the gene encoding the constitutive Hsp90 isoform, HSC82. Strain S153 (hsc82Δ hsp82-T101I) contains a null mutation in both HSC82 and HSP82 but carries a plasmid-borne copy of the temperature-sensitive allele hsp82-T101I expressed from the high level constitutive glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase gene promoter. The hsp82-T101I product exhibits reduced activity even at the permissive temperature (24 °C) but is inactivated further at higher temperatures (36Nathan D.F. Lindquist S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3917-3925Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). In strains expressing only hsp82-T101I, no growth is observed on media containing glucose as the sole carbon source at temperatures above ∼35 °C, indicating full loss of Hsp90 activity. Strains carrying a null mutation in CPR7 and null mutations in both CPR7 and HSC82 were also studied. Duina et al. (26Duina A.A. Chang H.-C.J. Marsh J.A. Lindquist S. Gaber R.F. Science. 1996; 274: 1713-1715Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar) found that growth on glucose-containing medium at 30 °C was slowed in the cpr7Δ strain, unaffected in the hsc82Δ strain, but reduced in the cpr7Δ hsc82Δ double null strain. Strain W303 carries two copies of the genes encoding maltose permease (MAL11, also called AGT1, and MAL31) and maltase (MAL12 and MAL32) but does not ferment maltose because it lacks a functional MAL activator gene. To study maltose utilization in this strain series MAL63, the MAL activator gene from the MAL6 locus was introduced into the Hsp90 mutant strains by transformation with the CEN plasmid pMAL63. The ability of these strains to induce maltase expression was determined. Transformants were grown in selective medium under uninduced conditions at 24 °C to mid-log phase and induced with maltose at either 24 or 35 °C. Maltase activity was assayed at time 0 and at 4 h after the addition of maltose. The results are shown in Fig. 1. The wild-type strain is able to induce to similar levels at both 24 and 35 °C. Loss of HSC82 alone causes a modest decrease in the rate of induction at 24 °C,"
https://openalex.org/W2006434965,"DNA replication is a highly processive and efficient process that involves the coordination of at least eight proteins to form the replisome in bacteriophage T4. Replication of DNA occurs in the 5′ to 3′ direction resulting in continuous replication on the leading strand and discontinuous replication on the lagging strand. A key question is how a continuous and discontinuous replication process is coordinated. One solution is to avoid having the completion of one Okazaki fragment to signal the start of the next but instead to have a key step such as priming proceed in parallel to lagging strand replication. Such a mechanism requires protein elements of the replisome to readily dissociate during the replication process. Protein trapping experiments were performed to test for dissociation of the clamp loader and primase from an active replisome in vitro whose template was both a small synthetic DNA minicircle and a larger DNA substrate. The primase, clamp, and clamp loader are found to dissociate from the replisome and are continuously recruited from solution. The effect of varying protein concentrations (dilution) on the size of Okazaki fragments supported the protein trapping results. These findings are in accord with previous results for the accessory proteins but, importantly now, identify the primase as dissociating from an active replisome. The recruitment of the primase from solution during DNA synthesis has also been found for Escherichia coli but not bacteriophage T7. The implications of these results for RNA priming and extension during the repetitive synthesis of Okazaki fragments are discussed.

The implications of these results for RNA priming and extension during the repetitive synthesis of Okazaki fragments are discussed. The replisome of bacteriophage T4 serves as a model system to examine the intricate mechanisms of DNA replication. The eight proteins that comprise the T4 replisome are all functionally conserved in higher organisms. The foundation of the replisome is the DNA polymerase holoenzyme that is assembled from the polymerase (gp43), 1The abbreviations used are: gpgene productTRFIItailed replicative form IICPM7-diethylamino-3-(4′maleimidylphenyl)-4-methylcoumarinITCisothermal calorimetry. the clamp (gp45), and the clamp loader (gp44/62) proteins and catalyzes the processive incorporation of nucleotides in the 5′ to 3′ direction. Working in conjunction with the holoenzyme is the primosome, which is formed from the primase (gp61), the helicase (gp41), the helicase accessory protein (gp59), and single-stranded binding protein (gp32). Hexameric gp41 unwinds the double-strand DNA in an ATP- or GTP-dependent manner (1.Dong F. Gogol E.P. von Hippel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7462-7473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). gp32 acts to coat and protect the single-strand DNA generated by unwinding of the template DNA from degradation and to prevent reannealing. The hexameric primase synthesizes pentaribonucleotide primers needed for the initiation of each Okazaki fragment (2.Valentine A.M. Ishmael F.T. Shier V.K. Benkovic S.J. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 15074-15085Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). gp59, apparently acting as a hexamer, facilitates the assembly of the primosome complex (3.Ishmael F.T. Alley S.C. Benkovic S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 20555-20562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar).

Kinetic and biochemical analyses of individual proteins and protein subassemblies within this system have elucidated the structural and mechanistic details of parts of the replisome. The kinetic mechanism and the conformational changes that occur during the assembly of the DNA polymerase holoenzyme have been well characterized (4.Alley S.C. Abel-Santos E. Benkovic S.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 3076-3090Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 5.Alley S.C. Trakselis M.A. Mayer M.U. Ishmael F.T. Jones A.D. Benkovic S.J. J. Biol.

This assembly mechanism proceeds through 10 steps in a pathway that commences with the clamp loader binding to the clamp and hydrolyzing ATP along with many subsequent conformational changes. The final solution structure model of the holoenzyme complex has been depicted with the C terminus of gp43 inserted into a subunit interface of gp45 augmented by major protein contacts between the two (5.Alley S.C. Trakselis M.A. Mayer M.U. Ishmael F.T. Jones A.D. Benkovic S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39340-39349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Assembly of the primosome also proceeds through a number of steps to form its final complex consisting of several, apparently stacked hexameric ring structures. 2M. A. Trakselis and F. T. Ishmael, unpublished observations. The binding of gp59 to gp32 coated DNA facilitates the loading of a hexameric helicase with the lagging DNA strand passing through the center of a complex of the helicase and gp59 (3.Ishmael F.T. Alley S.C. Benkovic S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 20555-20562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Monomeric gp59, which becomes hexameric in the presence of gp32, is thought to displace or destabilize gp32 from the single-strand DNA exposing a binding site for the helicase (8.Ishmael F.T. Alley S.C. Benkovic S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25236-25242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 9.Jones C.E. Mueser T.C. Dudas K.C. Kreuzer K.N. Nossal N.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8312-8318Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The gp59 hexamer in turn stimulates formation of a hexameric gp41, and the latter in turn ultimately leads to the assembly of a hexameric primase (2.Valentine A.M. Ishmael F.T. Shier V.K. Benkovic S.J. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 15074-15085Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). All three proteins, gp59, gp41, gp61, are present in the initial primosome complex. Primosomes from other organisms are also thought to form multiprotein complexes. In bacteriophage T7, the primase and helicase functions are contained on one polypeptide, gp4, which has two domains: an N-terminal primase domain and a C-terminal helicase domain (10.Kusakabe T. Baradaran K. Lee J. Richardson C.C. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1542-1552Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 11.Guo S. Tabor S. Richardson C.C. J. Biol.

A. 1998; 95: 7957-7962Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). EM structures of gp4 show a hexameric protein complex that wraps around single-strand DNA forming a ring similar to what is seen with bacteriophage T4 3M. Norcum, unpublished observations. (13.Egelman H.H. Yu X. Wild R. Hingorani M.M. Patel S.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3869-3873Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Only three additional proteins are required for coordinated leading and lagging strand synthesis in T7: the polymerase (gp5), single-stranded binding protein (gp2.5), and thioredoxin from the Escherichia coli host (14.Lee J. Chastain P.D. Kusakabe T. Griffith J.D. Richardson C.C. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 1001-1010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The change in the size of Okazaki fragments can be monitored to measure the effect of diluting certain proteins during active replication to determine their dissociative properties. Titrating any of the levels of protein components in T7 as well as varying the frequency of priming sites does not alter the Okazaki fragment size (14.Lee J. Chastain P.D. Kusakabe T. Griffith J.D. Richardson C.C. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 1001-1010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The lagging strand polymerase was found to recycle after completion of an Okazaki fragment, and all of the replisome proteins remained bound to the replication fork during the course of replication. It was suggested that the size of the Okazaki fragment was determined by the length of a replication loop and that a critical mass of bound gp2.5 was necessary to cause the recycling of the lagging strand polymerase after priming by gp4 (15.Lee J. Chastain P.D. Griffith J.D. Richardson C.C. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 316: 19-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In E. coli, the rate of DNA synthesis is about three times faster than that of phage T4 or T7, perhaps reflecting its much greater genomic size and the number of proteins responsible for an active replisome. In the E. coli replisome, there are both a leading and lagging strand DNA pol III holoenzyme consisting of at least 10 gene products. The β protein acts as the clamp to hold the polymerases onto DNA, whereas τ acts to directly link the leading and lagging strand holoenzymes (16.O'Donnell M. Kuriyan J. Kong X.P. Stukenberg P.T. Onrust R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 953-957Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 17.Studwell-Vaughan P.S. O'Donnell M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19833-19841Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The primosome consists of a helicase (DnaG), a primase (DnaB), and five other accessory proteins along with the single-stranded binding protein, SSB. By using dilution experiments, it was found that some proteins such as DnaB and β act distributively, whereas others such as DnaC and pol III act processively. Variation in the amount of dNTPs and rNTPs also changes the size of the Okazaki fragments (18.Wu C.A. Zechner E.L. McHenry C.S. Franden M.A. McHenry C.S. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4064-4073Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The mechanisms acting to control the size of the Okazaki fragments are not fixed at the time of assembly but can be varied during the lifetime of the replisome. Collectively, the data provide evidence for a highly interactive coordinated system where the discontinuous nature of lagging strand synthesis is orchestrated primarily by the primase dissociating/reassociating (recruitment from solution) with the replisome. Bacteriophage T4 has a replication system that shares properties with higher organisms, but the fewer number of protein components allows for more intense biochemical characterization. Coordinated DNA replication was also characterized in vitro for T4 with identical rates of leading and lagging strand synthesis on a minicircle template (19.Salinas F. Benkovic S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7196-7201Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 43.Yang J. Trakselis M.A. Roccasecca R.M. Benkovic S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 49828-49838Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Inhibition of the lagging strand synthesis by incorporation of ddCTP also inhibited the synthesis of the leading strand signifying coordination between the holoenzymes. Initial evidence to support the recycling of the polymerases was provided by Alberts et al. (20.Alberts B.M. Barry J. Bedinger P. Formosa T. Jongeneel C.V. Kreuzer K.N. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1983; 47: 655-668Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) in studies where the concentration of gp43 did not change the size of the Okazaki fragments. Further dilution experiments on preformed replication complexes by Kadyrov and Drake (21.Kadyrov F.A. Drake J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29559-29566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) found that the Okazaki fragment length increased upon dilution of gp32, gp45, and gp44/62 on a M13mp2 tailed double-stranded DNA substrate. These results thus identified the single-strand binding protein, the clamp, and clamp loader as acting distributively (dissociating/reassociating during replisome replication). Recently, Kadyrov and Drake (22.Kadyrov F.A. Drake J.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 4387-4397Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) extended their studies to examine the effect of using small minicircle substrates to study DNA replication and suggested that a small DNA substrate was unable to support coordinated replication. In the accompanying paper (43.Yang J. Trakselis M.A. Roccasecca R.M. Benkovic S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 49828-49838Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), we showed that under our conditions the smaller 70-bp minicircle acts as a template for coordinated DNA synthesis and exhibits rates approaching that of the larger tailed replicative form II (TRFII) substrate derived from M13mp18. Therefore, utilization of this small minicircle DNA substrate under the appropriate conditions for biochemical characterization successfully mimics larger replication forks found in vivo. A complementary method to the previously reported dilution protocol uses protein traps to probe the dissociative properties of proteins within the replisome. Protein traps were utilized to verify the results obtained from dilution experiments and to identify additional protein components that may dissociate during replication with either the minicircle system or the TRFII template. Catalytically inactive mutants or dominant negatives of gp61 and gp44 were created to determine their effect when added in excess to a functioning replisome. Inhibition of DNA replication on either the leading or lagging strands by a protein trap addition suggests that the protein of interest dissociates from the replisome and is recruited from solution at some point during replication. Inactive mutants of gp44 and gp61 were found to inhibit minicircle DNA synthesis on both the lagging strand and the leading strand suggesting that the clamp loader and the primase dissociate from the replisome. Moreover, the addition of gp44 or gp61 protein traps to the TRFII DNA template increased the size of Okazaki fragments consistent with their dissociation from the replisome. These results are similar to findings in E. coli where the primase dissociates but differs from those for T7 where gp4 containing both priming and helicase activity does not dissociate. This study thus verified the dissociation/reassociation of the clamp loader and clamp proteins from an active T4 replisome but importantly identified the primase as also being continuously recruited to the replisome during DNA replication.

DNA annealing was performed in a 40-μl volume of a buffer containing 20 mm Tris acetate (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgOAc, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 250 nm M13mp18 (as circular chromosomes), and 375 nm of a 73-mer oligonucleotide (5′-(T)43GATGTCCGCAACATCAAACATGACCACTGC-3′) whose 30 3′ nucleotides are complementary to the viral DNA, which was heated for 5 min at 95 °C and cooled at room temperature for 2 h. The annealed DNA was immediately used in a DNA synthesis reaction in a total volume of 1 ml of a buffer containing 20 mm Tris acetate (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgOAc, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 65 mm KOAc, 50 mm annealed DNA, 1 mm ATP, 0.2 mm dATP, 0.2 mm dGTP, 0.2 mm dCTP, 0.2 mm dTTP, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 34 μm gp43, 450 μm gp45 (as monomer), 148 μm gp44/62 and incubated for 50 min at 37 °C. The mixture was purified once by phenol/chloroform extraction, precipitated with ethanol, resuspended in TE buffer, and passed through micro-spin columns (Bio-Rad). The concentration of the substrate was determined by absorption at 260 nm. Neutral agarose gel electrophoresis of 1 μg of substrate revealed that 90% of single-strand DNA was converted into a tailed double-stranded form. Creation of Dominant Negative Proteins—The primase trap was created by site-directed mutagenesis to change a conserved glutamic acid (Glu-234) thought to be important for catalysis as identified by sequence alignments with other primases (29.Strack B.

Mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing (Pennsylvania State University Nucleic Acid Facility). Purification of gp61-E234Q was performed as described previously (2.Valentine A.M. Ishmael F.T. Shier V.K. Benkovic S.J. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 15074-15085Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The clamp loader trap was also created by site-directed mutagenesis by changing the conserved lysine in the nucleotide binding domain or p-loop of the Walker A motif of gp44 to affect ATP turnover.

Fragment AD was prepared by PCR using primers A and D with pET26b-gp44 as template. Fragment BC was created similarly using PCR. Overlap extension PCR using fragments AD and BC yielded the mutant gp44-K56A. The full-length fragment was digested with NdeI and NcoI and ligated into similarly digested pET26b to yield pET26b-gp44(K56A). Mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing (Pennsylvania State University Nucleic Acid Facility). pET26b-gp44(K56A) was cotransformed with pET22b-gp62 into BL21DE3 cells.

Fluorescence titrations were carried out to determine the KD value for the interaction between gp44(K56A)/62 with gp45(S158C/W199F/W92F)-CPM (6.Trakselis M.A. Alley S.C. Abel-Santos E. Benkovic S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8368-8375Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Excitation of the tryptophan donors in gp44(K46A)/62 at 280 nm was used to detect energy transfer to a CPM acceptor attached to gp45(S158C/W199F/W92F) devoid of tryptophans. Tryptophan quenching served to determine the binding curve. Slit widths were 2 nm, and emission was monitored in 1-nm increments with 0.5-s integration time. Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) experiments were performed on a thermostated MicroCal VP-ITC system as described previously (2.Valentine A.M. Ishmael F.T. Shier V.K. Benkovic S.J. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 15074-15085Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). gp61 and gp61(E234Q) were dialyzed into complex buffer, and the 45-mer containing a 5′-GTT priming site (5′-G GGT GGG AGG GAG GTT TGC AAC TGA TCG ATG ATA GTA CGT CTG TG) was diluted directly into complex buffer. For all experiments, the 45-mer was titrated into the sample cell containing either gp61 or gp61(E234Q), and the binding sites (N), dissociation constant (KD), and thermodynamic properties (ΔH and ΔS) were analyzed using Origin 5.0 (OriginLab, Northampton, MA). Replication Assays—The standard reaction conditions used in all minicircle reactions were described in detail in the accompanying paper (43.Yang J. Trakselis M.A. Roccasecca R.M. Benkovic S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 49828-49838Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) and consisted of 100 nm minicircle, 200 nm holoenzyme (gp43, gp45 trimers, and gp44/62), 600 nm primosome (gp41, gp61, and gp59 as monomers), and 5 μm gp32 in complex buffer consisting of 20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 150 mm KOAc, and 10 mm MgOAc, 500 μm each of dATP, dGTP, dCTP, and dTTP, 4 mm ATP, and 500 μm each of CTP, GTP, and UTP in a 100-μl total volume (Fig. 1B). [α-32P]dGTP (3000 Ci/mmol) and [α-32P]dCTP (3000 Ci/mmol) were present at 100 μCi/ml to measure leading and lagging strand synthesis, respectively. Reaction conditions with the TFRII DNA template were as follows: 3 nm TRFII, 16.6 nm gp43, 104 nm gp45 trimers, 16.2 nm gp44/62, 20 nm gp41 (hexamers), 36 nm gp61 (hexamers), 57 nm gp59 (hexamers), 4 μm gp32, 2 mm ATP, 200 μm dNTPs, 400 μm rNTPs, and 250 μCi/ml [α-32P]dGTP in complex buffer. Different orders of addition of the components were examined to determine the best substrate sequence for the reaction. Unless otherwise noted, the DNA polymerase holoenzyme (gp43, gp45, and gp44/62) was first preincubated at 37 °C with the DNA template in the presence of half of the ATP concentration for 1 min followed by the addition of the primosome (gp41, gp61, and gp59) and gp32 along with dNTPs, rNTPs, and the other half of ATP concentration (either 2 mm for the minicircle or 1 mm for TFRII). 5–20-μl aliquots were removed at various time points and quenched with an equal volume of 0.5 mm EDTA. Addition of a 5-fold molar excess of protein trap or additional protein components occurred at 90 s into the reaction for minicircle substrates and 5 min for TRFII substrates unless otherwise noted (Fig. 1C). To determine the size of leading and lagging strand products, samples were electrophoresed on a 0.8% alkaline agarose gel (30 mm NaOH and5mm EDTA) for 36 h. After electrophoresis, the gels were dried onto DE81 paper and visualized using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). Analysis of the distribution of DNA products on the alkaline gel through visualization by the PhosphorImager was quantified over the length of the lane. Determination of the amount of leading and lagging strand synthesis in the minicircle system was done by running the samples on a second 20% denaturing PAGE gel followed by PhosphorImaging. For the TFRII substrate quantification of the amount of leading and lagging strand synthesis was measured by PhosphorImager screening of two rectangles in each lane, one encircling the area above the 7249 bases (the length of the substrate), corresponding to the leading strand products, and the second one below the same band encompassing the lagging strand products. The specific activity of the 32P in the reaction was determined by spotting various amounts of the diluted reaction mixture on DE81 filter papers, in order to generate a standard curve whose slope was the specific activity of the radiolabeled nucleotide (counts/pmol dNTPs). This value was used to calculate the pools of dNTPs at each time point in the reaction to obtain the rate of pools dNTPs/min incorporated into either the leading or lagging strands. An average of at least four areas was used to calculate and correct for the background value of the gel. Concentration Titration Experiments—Different starting concentrations of either gp44/62, gp45, or gp61 were used in the minicircle reaction to determine the effect of concentration on Okazaki fragment size. The replisome was preassembled as described with either 4- or 16-fold lower concentrations of either gp44/62 or gp45, and 3- or 9-fold lower concentrations of gp61. [α-32P]dCTP was added to the reaction mixture 60 s after the start time in order to detect only Okazaki fragments made from active replisomes, and the reaction was then quenched with EDTA after 3 min. The different reaction mixtures were then electrophoresed on an alkaline agarose gel, and the sizes of the Okazaki fragments were analyzed. Data Analysis—Percent active replication complexes can be estimated using two different methods. The first method calculates the number of complexes that are active throughout the reaction cycle compared with a theoretical value, and the second method calculates the number of complexes that have been active. The theoretical value is based on the rate of DNA synthesis in bp/s and the concentration of the replisome (equivalent to the concentration of the mi"

A reversed carbon dioxide gradient from the lungs into the blood was demonstrated at the 50-foot depth. At 90 feet, 45 percent of the pre-dive carbon dioxide content of the lungs had disappeared. There was no indication of a reversed oxygen gradient during ascent."
https://openalex.org/W2103288374,"In type 2 diabetes, glucose phosphorylation, a regulatory step in glucose utilization by skeletal muscle, is impaired. Since glucokinase expression in skeletal muscle of transgenic mice increases glucose phosphorylation, we examined whether such mice counteract the obesity and insulin resistance induced by 12 wk of a high-fat diet. When fed this diet, control mice became obese, whereas transgenic mice remained lean. Furthermore, high-fat fed control mice developed hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia (a 3-fold increase), indicating that they were insulin resistant. In contrast, transgenic mice were normoglycemic and showed only a mild increase in insulinemia (1.5-fold). They also showed improved whole body glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity and increased intramuscular concentrations of glucose 6-phosphate and glycogen. A parallel increase in uncoupling protein 3 mRNA levels in skeletal muscle of glucokinase-expressing transgenic mice was also observed. These results suggest that the rise in glucose phosphorylation by glucokinase expression in skeletal muscle leads to increased glucose utilization and energy expenditure that counteracts weight gain and maintains insulin sensitivity."
https://openalex.org/W2124216673,"The major protein component (apoB-100) of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) is known as a multipotential molecule the several functional regions of which can all be affected by key structural modifications driven by specific domains. Based on our previous report on structural and conformational modifications of apoB-100 in the presence of 17-beta-estradiol (E2), we characterized the interaction between E2 and the apoB-100 and further explored the induced alterations in terms of the structural arrangement of the whole LDL particle. We report evidence for the existence on apoB-100 of a single specific and saturable binding site for E2, the occupancy of which modifies the overall structure of the protein, inducing an increase in the alpha-helix fraction. As a consequence, the structure of the LDL particle is deeply perturbed, with a change in the arrangement of both the outer shell and lipid core and an overall volume shrinkage. The evidence of a regulation of apoB-100 structure by a physiological ligand opens new perspectives in the study of the biological addressing of the LDL particle and suggests a novel rationale in the search for mechanisms underlying the beneficial role of E2 in decreasing the risk of early lesions in atherosclerosis."
https://openalex.org/W2416563428,Cohen's method for preparing the nerve growth factor from mouse submaxillary glands was followed to the last ammonium sulfate fraction. Further purification was accomplished with carboxymethyl- and diethylaminoethyl- column chromatography. Three peaks were obtained for each column; the third peak obtained with diethylaminoethyl cellulose was the most active. Electrophoresis of this active fraction produced one anodal and two cathodal bands. Each band was inactive for nerve outgrowth. However combinations of the cathodal bands produced 3+ growth. One cathodal band was not dialyzable; the other was dialyzable and negative for ultraviolet absorption at 280 millimicrons.
https://openalex.org/W2110981832,"The Clara cell secretory protein (CCSP) imparts a protective effect to the lung during oxidant injury. However, exposure to supplemental oxygen, a common therapeutic modality for lung disease, represses the expression of CCSP in the adult mouse lung. We investigated the mechanisms of hyperoxia-induced repression of the mouse CCSP promoter. Deletion experiments in vivo and in vitro indicated that the hyperoxia-responsive elements are localized to the proximal -166 bp of the CCSP promoter. Electrophoretic mobility shift and supershift analyses demonstrated increased binding of c-Jun at the activator protein-1 site, increased binding of CCAAT/enhancer binding protein (C/EBP) beta at the C/EBP sites, and decreased binding at the Nkx2.1 sites. Western analyses revealed that hyperoxia exposure induced an increase in the expression of the C/EBPbeta isoform liver-inhibiting protein (LIP) and an increase in cytoplasmic Nkx2.1. Cotransfection of LIP or c-Jun expression plasmids decreased the transcriptional activity of the proximal -166-bp CCSP promoter. These observations suggest that hyperoxia-induced repression of the CCSP gene is mediated, at least in part, at the level of transcription and that multiple mechanisms mediate this repression. Moreover, these novel observations may provide insights for generation of therapeutic interventions for the amelioration of oxidant-induced lung injury."
