https://openalex.org/W2165214298,"Humans expressing a defective form of the transcription factor AIRE (autoimmune regulator) develop multiorgan autoimmune disease. We used aire- deficient mice to test the hypothesis that this transcription factor regulates autoimmunity by promoting the ectopic expression of peripheral tissue- restricted antigens in medullary epithelial cells of the thymus. This hypothesis proved correct. The mutant animals exhibited a defined profile of autoimmune diseases that depended on the absence of aire in stromal cells of the thymus. Aire-deficient thymic medullary epithelial cells showed a specific reduction in ectopic transcription of genes encoding peripheral antigens. These findings highlight the importance of thymically imposed ""central"" tolerance in controlling autoimmunity."
https://openalex.org/W2013895253,"We report on stimulated Raman scattering in an approximately 1-meter-long hollow-core photonic crystal fiber filled with hydrogen gas under pressure. Light was guided and confined in the 15-micrometer-diameter hollow core by a two-dimensional photonic bandgap. Using a pulsed laser source (pulse duration, 6 nanoseconds; wavelength, 532 nanometers), the threshold for Stokes (longer wavelength) generation was observed at pulse energies as low as 800 ± 200 nanojoules, followed by a coherent anti-Stokes (shorter wavelength) generation threshold at 3.4 ± 0.7 microjoules. The pump-to-Stokes conversion efficiency was 30 ± 3% at a pulse energy of only 4.5 microjoules. These energies are almost two orders of magnitude lower than any other reported energy, moving gas-based nonlinear optics to previously inaccessible parameter regimes of high intensity and long interaction length."
https://openalex.org/W1975905715,"Modification of low density lipoprotein (LDL) can result in the avid uptake of these lipoproteins via a family of macrophage transmembrane proteins referred to as scavenger receptors (SRs). The genetic inactivation of either of two SR family members, SR-A or CD36, has been shown previously to reduce oxidized LDL uptakein vitro and atherosclerotic lesions in mice. Several other SRs are reported to bind modified LDL, but their contribution to macrophage lipid accumulation is uncertain. We generated mice lacking both SR-A and CD36 to determine their combined impact on macrophage lipid uptake and to assess the contribution of other SRs to this process. We show that SR-A and CD36 account for 75–90% of degradation of LDL modified by acetylation or oxidation. Cholesteryl ester derived from modified lipoproteins fails to accumulate in macrophages taken from the double null mice, as assessed by histochemistry and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. These results demonstrate that SR-A and CD36 are responsible for the preponderance of modified LDL uptake in macrophages and that other scavenger receptors do not compensate for their absence.

The uptake of modified lipoproteins by macrophages leads to lipid-laden foam cells and fatty streak development in the arterial wall, one of the earliest steps in the progression of the atherosclerotic plaque. Scavenger receptor family members SR-A and CD36 have been identified as receptors for modified lipoproteins on macrophages, and their relevance to lipid uptake has been demonstrated in vitro and in vivo. Studies with SR-A or CD36 knockout mice show that disruption of either receptor pathway partially inhibits uptake of acetylated LDL (AcLDL) or oxidized LDL (OxLDL) in macrophages and retards atherosclerotic progression in hypercholesterolemic mice (1Suzuki H.

It is not known, however, whether the major pathways of modified lipid uptake in macrophages comprise just these two receptors or whether other, more recently identified, scavenger receptors can contribute significantly to that process. Since the cloning of the first two macrophage scavenger receptors (now called SR-A type I and type II (4Kodama T. Freeman M. Rohrer L. Zabrecky J. Matsudaira P. Krieger M. Nature. 1990; 343: 531-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar, 5Rohrer L. Freeman M. Kodama T. Penman M. Krieger M. Nature. 1990; 343: 570-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar)), the broad SR family has grown considerably (reviewed in Ref. 6Peiser L. Gordon S. Microbes Infect. 2001; 3: 149-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). The full range of scavenger receptor functions is far from clear, but these proteins have been shown to be involved in innate immune responses, cellular adhesion, and phagocytosis of apoptotic cells, in addition to their role in lipid uptake. It is evident that some functions overlap between some members, providing biological redundancy, but specialized functions are likely to characterize each receptor. On the basis of functional studies and evidence for expression in the arterial intima, only some of the SRs are good candidates for contributing to atherosclerotic foam cell formation. In addition to SR-A and CD36, these receptors include: 1) CD68 (SR-D class), 2) lectin-like oxidized LDL receptor (LOX-1, SR-E class), 3) scavenger receptor expressed by endothelial cells (SREC, SR-F class), and 4) scavenger receptor for phosphotidylserine and oxidized lipoprotein (SR-PSOX, SR-G class). In vitro studies have demonstrated that LOX-1, SR-PSOX, and SREC bind modified LDL with dissociation constants in the range of 3–36 μg/ml, comparable with that of SR-A (7Freeman M.W. Ekkel Y.

Although OxLDL has been shown to bind CD68, this binding has been characterized primarily on the basis of ligand blot analysis (12Ramprasad M.P. Fischer W. Witztum J.L. Sambrano G.R. Quehenberger O. Steinberg D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1995; 92: 9580-9584Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). This methodology may overestimate the importance of the role of CD68 in lipid uptake as the majority of the protein appears to be localized in intracellular compartments that would not mediate modified lipoprotein uptake from the extracellular environment. CD68, LOX-1, and SR-PSOX have all been detected in human atherosclerotic lesions and could, therefore, be positioned to play a role in foam cell formation in the arterial intima (13Geng Y.J. Holm J.

To quantitate the relative importance of SR-A and CD36 in the macrophage response to different forms of modified LDL and to assess compensatory mechanisms for lipid uptake in their absence, we have generated mice lacking both SR-A and CD36. The binding, uptake, and degradation of AcLDL, as well as LDL oxidized by copper ions or by reactive nitrogen species generated by a myeloperoxidase/hydrogen peroxide/nitrite system, were determined in wild type macrophages and in those lacking either one or both receptors. GC-MS measurements of cholesterol mass and histochemical staining for neutral lipid uptake were also performed in these cells. The results of these studies indicate that SR-A and CD36 are responsible for the preponderance of modified LDL uptake in macrophages and that other scavenger receptors do not compensate for their loss. Cell culture reagents were from Invitrogen.125I and 32P were obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. SR-AI/II-deficient mice were generously provided by Dr. T. Kodama (University of Tokyo) (1Suzuki H. Kurihara Y. Takeya M. Kamada N. Kataoka M. Jishage K. Ueda O. Sakaguchi H. Higashi T. Doi T. Matsumoto A. Azuma S. Noda T. Toyoda Y. Itakura H. Yazaki Y.

The CD36−/− mice used in these studies were generated as described (16Febbraio M. Abumrad N.A. Hajjar D.P. Sharma K. Cheng W. Pearce S.F. Silverstein R.L. J. Biol.

Both lines were backcrossed for five generations to C57BL/6J mice prior to intercrossing of the lines to generate mice lacking both SR-A and CD36. Double knockout mice (SR-A−/−/CD36−/−) were generated from heterozygote intercrosses at the expected ration of 1:16. SR-A and CD36 genotypes were verified by PCR analyses of tail DNA as described previously (1Suzuki H. Kurihara Y. Takeya M. Kamada N. Kataoka M. Jishage K. Ueda O. Sakaguchi H. Higashi T. Doi T.

Mice were injected intraperitoneally with 3% thioglycollate broth, and elicited macrophages were collected after 4 days by peritoneal lavage as described previously (17Moore K.J. Fabunmi R.P. Andersson L.P. Freeman M.W. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1998; 18: 1647-1654Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Macrophages were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum overnight, and non-adherent cells were removed by washing. Macrophages prepared in this manner routinely stained positively for CD11b (>95%) and F4/80 (>70%) by flow cytometry. Human LDL (density = 1.019–1.063) was purchased from Biomedical Technologies (Stoughton, MA). Iodination of LDL was accomplished by a modified iodine monochloride reaction (18Goldstein J.L. Basu S.K. Brown M.S. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 98: 241-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (1287) Google Scholar). Acetylation of LDL and125I-LDL was performed as described previously, (9Andersson L.P. Freeman M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19592-19601Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) and the specific activity of 125I-acetyl LDL ranged from 400–600 cpm/ng of LDL protein. For copper ion-mediated oxidation, LDL and125I-LDL (250 μg/ml) were incubated with 5 μm CuSO4 at 37 °C for 8 (mildly oxidized) or 24 h (extensively oxidized) (17Moore K.J. Fabunmi R.P. Andersson L.P. Freeman M.W. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1998; 18: 1647-1654Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Oxidation was terminated by addition of 50 μm butylated hydroxytoluene and 200 μm EDTA. Mildly OxLDL had a relative electrophoretic mobility ∼2.0 times that of native, unmodified LDL, whereas extensively OxLDL had a relative mobility of 3.5 times. The specific activity of 125I-copper-oxidized LDL was 300–600 cpm/ng of protein. LDL oxidized by the myeloperoxidase/hydrogen peroxide/nitrite system was prepared as described (19Podrez E.A. Schmitt D. Hoff H.E. Hazen S.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 1547-1560Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). Binding assays were performed at 4 °C using 10 μg/ml modified 125I-LDL (AcLDL or OxLDL) in the presence or absence of a 20-fold excess of unlabeled modified LDL competitor as described previously (9Andersson L.P. Freeman M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19592-19601Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Specific binding of AcLDL or OxLDL was calculated as the total binding of modified 125I-LDL minus binding in the presence of unlabelled modified LDL competitor. Degradation of modified LDL was assessed at 37 °C for 5 h using 10 μg/ml modified 125I-LDL (AcLDL or OxLDL) in the presence or absence of a 20-fold excess of unlabeled modified LDL competitor as described (7Freeman M.W. Ekkel Y. Rohrer L. Penman M. Freedman N.J. Chisolm G.M. Kreiger M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1991; 88: 4931-4935Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Specific degradation was calculated as the total degradation of modified 125I-LDL minus degradation in the presence of unlabelled competitor. All measurements were performed on triplicate samples and were conducted independently at least three times. To assess foam cell formation, cells were incubated with 40 μg/ml LDL or OxLDL for 48 h, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, and stained with Oil Red O to visualize lipid accumulation. Staining was recorded on an Olympus X10 microscope equipped with a digital camera. Free and esterified cellular cholesterol were measured by gas chromatography as described (20Jacobs N.L. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 1973-1987Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Moore K.J. Rosen E.D. Fitzgerald M.L. Randow F. Andersson L.P. Altshuler D. Milstone D. Mortensen R.M. Speigelmen B.M. Freeman M.W. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 41-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). 6 × 106 cells were incubated with 40 μg/ml OxLDL or AcLDL for 48 h and then extracted with hexane:isopropanol (3:2). Stigmasterol (Sigma) was added as an internal standard, and lipid extracts were washed once with water and divided into two equal aliquots. One lipid aliquot was saponified for determination of total cholesterol, and the second aliquot was analyzed for free cholesterol using gas chromatography and mass spectrometry. The samples were injected (splitless) into an Agilent 6890 GC-MS (G2613A system, Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA) equipped with a J&W DB17 fused silica capillary column (15 m × 0.25 mm inner diameter × 0.5 μm; J&W Scientific, Folsom, CA). The GC temperature program was as follows: the initial temperature was 260 °C for 5 min, and then it was increased to 280 °C (5 °C/min) and held at 280 °C for 11 min. A model 5973N mass-selective detector (Agilent Technologies) was used in scan modes to identify the samples. Cholesterol measurements were obtained on triplicate samples and normalized to cellular protein content. The esterified cholesterol fraction was calculated by subtraction of the free cholesterol from total cholesterol. 5 × 105 cells were preincubated with 1 μg of FcBlock (Pharmingen) in phosphate-buffered saline, 1% fetal bovine serum for 15 min to block nonspecific antibody binding to Fc receptors. Cells were then incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated CD11b (BD Transduction Laboratories), F4/80 (Serotec, Oxford, UK), or isotype control antibody (IgG2b and IgA, BD Transduction Laboratories) for 30 min on ice. For detection of CD36, cells were incubated with monoclonal anti-murine CD36 antibody (Cascade Bioscience, Winchester, MA) for 30 min on ice, washed three times in phosphate-buffered saline, and incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-IgA secondary antibody for 30 min. After washing extensively with phosphate-buffered saline, stained cells were analyzed on a Coulter fluorescent cell sorter, and 10,000 events in the live gate were recorded. For lipopolysaccharide (LPS) experiments, 3 × 106 cells were stimulated with 100 ng/ml Escherichia coli K12 LPS (Sigma) for 6 h. Tumor necrosis factor-α and IL-6 in cell culture supernatants were assayed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Pierce) as described previously (17Moore K.J. Fabunmi R.P. Andersson L.P. Freeman M.W. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1998; 18: 1647-1654Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Mice deficient in both SR-A and CD36 (SR-A−/−/CD36−/−) were derived in the expected Mendelian ratios and appeared healthy when compared with wild type, SR-A (SR-A−/−), or CD36 (CD36−/−) single null mice. Macrophages from all genotypes (wild type; SR-A−/−; CD36−/−; and SR-A−/−/CD36−/−) expressed similar levels of the macrophage cell surface markers, CD11b and F4/80, as assessed by flow cytometry (Fig. 1 A). Furthermore, macrophages from all genotypes produced similar levels of tumor necrosis factor-α and IL-6 in response to bacterial LPS (Fig. 1 B). These findings indicate that the absence of both SR-A and CD36 does not appear to alter the expression of myeloid differentiation markers, nor does it affect the cytokine responses to the prototypical stimulator of macrophage inflammatory pathways, bacterial endotoxin. To define the contributions of SR-A and CD36 to modified lipid uptake, we performed binding and degradation studies on macrophages derived from wild type, SR-A−/−, CD36−/−, or SR-A−/−/CD36−/− mice using LDL modified by acetylation or oxidation, using either copper ions or a myeloperoxidase/hydrogen peroxide/nitrite oxidizing system. Fig.2 A shows that during a 5-h incubation with 125I-AcLDL, SR-A−/−macrophages degraded 70% less ligand than did wild type macrophages (p < 0.0001). CD36, whose role in AcLDL uptake has been controversial, appears to play a relatively minor role in AcLDL degradation, as evidenced by the very modest decline (13%) measured in the CD36−/− macrophages. In macrophages lacking both SR-A and CD36, AcLDL degradation fell ∼80%. Thus, the effect of the loss of both receptors appears to reflect the summation of their respective contributions and indicates that these two transmembrane proteins account for the vast majority of AcLDL uptake and degradation. In contrast to the effect on degradation of the ligand, specific binding of AcLDL was decreased by only 44% in SR-A−/− macrophages (p < 0.0001, Fig.2 B). Somewhat surprisingly, CD36 contributed more to AcLDL binding than to its degradation as a 28% decrease in binding to CD36−/− macrophages was observed (Fig. 2 B). In macrophages taken from SR-A−/−/CD36−/−mice, AcLDL binding fell by 54%. These results indicate that alternative mechanisms can contribute to AcLDL binding to macrophages, accounting for nearly half of the total AcLDL bound. Nevertheless, relatively little of this alternatively bound ligand is internalized and degraded, as evidenced by the 80% decrease in degradation in the SR-A−/−/CD36−/− mouse. The evidence demonstrating that both SR-A and CD36 can bind and degrade oxidized LDL is substantial. The relative affinities of this ligand for the two receptors appear to be determined by the degree of oxidation of the LDL. Extensive oxidation of LDL appears to be required for rapid uptake via SR-A, whereas mildly oxidized LDL is preferentially internalized via CD36 (2Febbraio M. Podrez E.A. Smith J.D. Hajjar D.P.

To assess the contributions of other receptors to the process of oxidized LDL uptake and degradation, we performed binding and degradation studies using LDL that had been subjected to mild or extensive oxidizing conditions. A third form of oxidation, myeloperoxidase-hydrogen peroxide-nitrite modification, which may represent a more physiologically relevant pathway of LDL oxidation, was also tested (3Podrez E.A. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 1095-1108Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar, 19Podrez E.A. Schmitt D. Hoff H.E. Hazen S.L. J. Clin.

Biol. Chem. 2002; 8: 8Google Scholar) The mildly oxidized LDL used in these experiments had a relative electrophoretic mobility that was twice that of native LDL (data not shown). This corresponds to a derivatization of 25–30% of its lysine residues (24Steinbrecher U.P. Witztum J.L. Parthasarthy S. Steinberg D. Arteriosclerosis. 1987; 7: 135-143Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Chang Y.H. Abdalla D.S.P. Sevanian A. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1997; 23: 202-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). A 68% decrease in degradation and a 90% decrease in binding, relative to that in wild type macrophages, was measured when this modified LDL was incubated with CD36−/−macrophages (Fig. 3 A). In contrast, binding and degradation of mildly oxidized LDL were reduced by only 25 and 40%, respectively, in the SR-A−/−macrophages. A further reduction in binding and degradation (up to 90%) was observed in macrophages lacking both SR-A and CD36 (Fig.3 A). The more extensively oxidized LDL had an electrophoretic mobility 3.5 times that of native LDL, corresponding to 40–50% derivitization of lysine residues. At this level of oxidation, receptor specificity was altered with the ligand degraded preferentially through SR-A rather than CD36 (Fig. 3 B). A 47% decrease in degradation of this ligand was measured in macrophages lacking SR-A as compared with a 26% decrease in CD36−/−macrophages. Interestingly, a similar discordance between binding and degradation, as noted for AcLDL, was again observed. CD36−/− macrophages showed a much greater decrease in binding (62%) than did the SR-A−/− cells (13%) despite the reverse rank order for degradation (Fig. 3 B). When both receptors were inactivated, a 69% decrease in binding and a 78% decrease in degradation were measured. The results obtained with LDL oxidized by the myeloperoxidase/hydrogen peroxide/nitrite system were concordant with that of LDL mildly oxidized by copper ions. CD36 was the preferred receptor for this ligand (Fig. 4). Degradation of this form of oxidized LDL was reduced by 60%, and binding was reduced by 74% in CD36−/− macrophages. The corresponding changes in SR-A−/− macrophages were 30 and 23% decreases for degradation and binding, respectively. A 75% decrease in both binding and degradation was measured in the SR-A−/−/CD36−/− macrophages (Fig. 4). Taken together, these experiments clearly demonstrate that SR-A and CD36 account for the vast majority of lipid uptake and degradation involving modified LDL that has been altered either by acetylation or by varying degrees of oxidation. No more than 25%, and as little as 10%, of these modified lipoproteins appears to be taken up and degraded by pathways not involving SR-A or CD36. To directly assess the potential of the alternative scavenger receptor pathways to contribute to foam cell formation, we incubated SR-A−/−/CD36−/−macrophages with oxidized LDL and assessed lipid accumulation morphologically by Oil Red O staining and quantitatively by GC-MS. Macrophages were incubated with acLDL or mildly oxidized LDL for 48 h and then stained with Oil Red O to detect cholesteryl ester accumulation (Fig. 5). As would be predicted by our binding and degradation results, the intensity of Oil Red O staining was dramatically reduced in both the CD36−/− and SR-A−/−/CD36−/−macrophages. To better quantitate this decline, GC-MS was utilized to measure cholesterol and cholesteryl ester mass in macrophages incubated with no modified lipoprotein or with AcLDL or OxLDL (TableI). In wild type cells incubated with OxLDL, total cholesterol mass increased ∼30% with an increase in cholesteryl ester mass from undetectable levels to 20 μg/mg of cellular protein. For AcLDL, the comparable numbers were a 70% increase in total cholesterol mass and the accumulation of 25 μg of cholesteryl ester from a previously undetectable level. Strikingly, in SR-A−/−/CD36−/− macrophages, incubation with OxLDL led to no change in the total cholesterol mass and no accumulation of cholesteryl ester. Incubation of these cells with AcLDL produced a 30% increase in total cholesterol mass, but again, no cholesteryl ester accumulation was detected. These findings demonstrate that in the absence of both SR-A and CD36, no cholesteryl ester accumulation occurs in response to incubation with either AcLDL or OxLDL, confirming the histologic impression of the absence of any foam cell formation.Table IAccumulation of total and esterified cholesterol in peritoneal macrophagesTreatmentCellular CholesterolTotalEsterifiedWild typeSRA−/−; CD36−/−Wild typeSRA−/−; CD36−/−μg/mg of proteinNone97.07 ± 4.3108.75 ± 7.4Not detectedNot detectedOxLDL129.08 ± 2.71-ap < 0.05 versus no treatment.103.86 ± 11.220.32 ± 4.9Not detectedAcLDL170.79 ± 21.71-ap < 0.05 versus no treatment.131.28 ± 13.925.07 ± 2.6Not detectedTotal cholesterol accumulation in macrophages treated with AcLDL or mildly oxidized (Cu++) LDL. 6 × 106 cells were incubated with 40 μg/ml modified LDL for 48 h.

Chandler A.B. Glagov S. Guyton J.R. Insull Jr., W. Rosenfeld M.E. Schaffer S.A. Schwartz C.J. Wagner W.D. Wissler R.W. Arterioscler.

Biosci. 2001; 6: D429-D455Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As the family of macrophage scavenger receptors provides a high affinity uptake mechanism for the accumulation of lipid derived from modified LDL, it is widely believe that they play a critical role in foam cell formation. The number of SR family members has grown substantially in recent years, but because of their redundancy, it has been difficult to assess the relative contribution of each of these proteins to the lipid uptake process. We, therefore, sought to characterize the receptor pathways in macrophages that could mediate modified LDL uptake and determine their contribution to cholesteryl ester accumulation and foam cell formation. Mice lacking SR-A or CD36 were intercrossed, producing animals lacking both receptors. Comparison of these animals with wild type mice and single null progenitors of the double knockouts permitted us to quantitate the amount of lipid uptake mediated by each of the two pathways, as well as all alternative pathways not involving SR-A or CD36. The results demonstrate that SR-A and CD36 are the critical contributors to modified lipoprotein uptake in macrophages in vitro. In the absence of both receptors, lipoprotein uptake and degradation were reduced by 75–90%, using four different types of modified LDL. Using LDL mildly oxidized by copper ions, we demonstrate that lipid accumulation can occur in sufficient quantities to account for the histologic conversion of macrophages to foam cells. In addition, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry measurements directly quantitated this lipid accumulation and found ∼200 nmol of total cholesterol/mg of cellular protein in macrophages incubated with OxLDL for 48 h. 30 nmol of that total represented esterified cholesterol. When acetylated LDL was employed as the ligand, the total cholesterol content was 263 nmol/mg of cellular protein, of which 38 nmol was esterified cholesterol. The alternative receptor pathways, whose contributions could only be quantitated in the absence of both CD36 and SR-A, account for a very small percentage of the lipoprotein degradation measured. Moreover, we were unable to demonstrate histologic conversion of SR-A−/−/CD36−/−macrophages to foam cells when exposed to OxLDL. This finding was confirmed by GC-MS, which showed no accumulation of cholesteryl ester in the SR-A−/−/CD36−/− cells. These results provide strong evidence that more recently identified SRs, including CD68, LOX-1, SR-PSOX, and SREC, play a minor role, if any, in modified LDL uptake by macrophages. Of interest, the process of lipid uptake mediated by SR-A and CD36 appears to be distinct in that SR-A binding of ligand results in a greater degradation rate than does CD36 binding. Previous studies of OxLDL and AcLDL uptake have shown trafficking of these lipids to different intracellular compartments, and Lougheed et al.(29Lougheed M. Moore E.D. Scriven D.R. Steinbrecher U.P. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1999; 19: 1881-1890Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) have suggested that this difference could arise from the involvement of separate receptors in the uptake process. Our results suggest this to be the case with AcLDL uptake predominantly driven by the action of SR-A, whereas mildly OxLDL uptake is primarily mediated by CD36 (3Podrez E.A. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 1095-1108Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). The degree of oxidation, however, strongly influences the pathway of OxLDL degradation. With more extensively oxidized LDL, the contribution of the SR-A pathway is enhanced. Interestingly, the reduction in binding of extensively oxidized LDL to CD36−/− macrophages, relative to wild type macrophages, was greater than that seen with SR-A-deficient cells despite the larger decline in degradation in the latter. Although this result could be a consequence of a higher recycling rate of internalized SR-A molecules back to the plasma membrane, it is also possible that SR-A links to a distinct and more efficient pathway of ligand degradation. Studies are currently underway to explore these differences in greater detail. The studies reported here utilized in vitro modified lipoproteins. By employing several forms of oxidized LDL, as well as acetylated LDL, we have tried to examine the full spectrum of modified lipoproteins that could interact with scavenger receptors. Whether different forms of modified lipoproteins exist in vivoremains unknown. Thus, our conclusion concerning the limited role of the alternative SRs does not preclude the possibility that they participate in the uptake of other forms of lipoproteins or that they could affect atherogenesis via altogether different mechanisms. Of note, however, quantitative real-time reverse transcription-PCR measurements of the mRNA encoding CD68, LOX-1, SR-PSOX, or SREC showed no increase in the SR-A−/−/CD36−/− macrophages, indicating that the transcription of these receptors is not up-regulated in response to the loss of any function that SR-A or CD36 performs in a macrophage (data not shown). The generation of mice lacking these alternative SRs will be required to shed light on their other potential functions, as well as any contribution they may make to in vivo lipid uptake. In addition, the recent report of Kruthet al. (30Kruth H.S. Huang W. Ishii I. Zhang W.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34573-34580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), demonstrating that native LDL can promote lipid accumulation in vitro in phorbol ester-treated human monocyte-macrophages, suggests that lipid accumulation and foam cell formation might also arise from non-scavenger receptor-mediated pathways. The generation of mice lacking both of the critical receptor pathways necessary for modified lipoprotein uptake should facilitate future studies of atherogenesis. By intercrossing the SR-A−/−/CD36−/− mice with hyperlipidemic mouse strains, it should be possible to determine whether these receptors are, in fact, required for macrophage foam cell formationin vivo. These studies are currently in progress. Although both single null mice showed decreases in atherosclerosis in previous studies, foam cell formation was not completely abrogated. Our in vitro data, demonstrating the absence of foam cell formation and cholesteryl ester accumulation in the double null macrophages, suggest that the hyperlipidemic SR-A−/−/CD36−/−mouse might indeed fail to generate macrophage foam cells in vivo. The results of these in vivo studies should therefore clarify both the utility of the in vitro ligands in predicting in vivo lipid uptake and the potential role of alternative pathways in macrophage foam cell formation. Through such experimental approaches, it should be possible to directly test the hypothesis that foam cell formation plays a causal role in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and is not simply a marker of lipid deposition in the arterial intima. Should that hypothesis prove correct, the delineation of the major pathways of lipid uptake in macrophages provides potential targets for therapies designed to ameliorate atherosclerotic heart disease."

SATB1 (‘special AT-rich sequence binding 1’), a protein found predominantly in thymocytes4, regulates genes by folding chromatin into loop domains, tethering specialized DNA elements to an SATB1 network structure5. Ablation of SATB1 by gene targeting results in temporal and spatial mis-expression of numerous genes and arrested T-cell development, suggesting that SATB1 is a cell-type specific global gene regulator6. Here we show that SATB1 targets chromatin remodelling to the IL-2Rα (‘interleukin-2 receptor α’) gene, which is ectopically transcribed in SATB1 null thymocytes. SATB1 recruits the histone deacetylase contained in the NURD chromatin remodelling complex to a SATB1-bound site in the IL-2Rα locus, and mediates the specific deacetylation of histones in a large domain within the locus. SATB1 also targets ACF1 and ISWI, subunits of CHRAC and ACF nucleosome mobilizing complexes, to this specific site and regulates nucleosome positioning over seven kilobases. SATB1 defines a class of transcriptional regulators that function as a ‘landing platform’ for several chromatin remodelling enzymes and hence regulate large chromatin domains."

We examined the impact of steroid receptor-mediated transcription on RNA processing with reporter genes subject to alternative splicing driven by steroid-sensitive promoters. Steroid hormones affected the processing of pre-mRNA synthesized from steroid-sensitive promoters, but not from steroid-unresponsive promoters, in a steroid receptor-dependent and receptor-selective manner. Several nuclear receptor coregulators showed differential splicing effects, suggesting that steroid hormone receptors may simultaneously control gene transcription activity and exon content of the product mRNA by recruiting coregulators involved in both processes."
https://openalex.org/W2005646823,"The motor abnormalities of Parkinson's disease (PD) are caused by alterations in basal ganglia network activity, including disinhibition of the subthalamic nucleus (STN), and excessive activity of the major output nuclei. Using adeno-associated viral vector–mediated somatic cell gene transfer, we expressed glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD), the enzyme that catalyzes synthesis of the neurotransmitter GABA, in excitatory glutamatergic neurons of the STN in rats. The transduced neurons, when driven by electrical stimulation, produced mixed inhibitory responses associated with GABA release. This phenotypic shift resulted in strong neuroprotection of nigral dopamine neurons and rescue of the parkinsonian behavioral phenotype. This strategy suggests that there is plasticity between excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission in the mammalian brain that could be exploited for therapeutic benefit."

Replacement of tyrosine residues in Dab1 that are phosphorylated in response to Reelin by phenylalanines in knockin mice abolished Dab1 function (12Howell B.W. Herrick T.M. Hildebrand J.D. Zhang Y. Cooper J.A. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 877-885Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Furthermore, mice that lack both Reelin and Dab1 are no more affected than animals that lack only Reelin or Dab1 (11Howell B.W. Herrick T.M. Cooper J.A. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 643-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar), suggesting that they are components of the same pathway. Tyrosine phosphorylation of Dab1 allows it to interact with nonreceptor tyrosine kinases including Abl and Src family members, suggesting that Dab1 itself might function as a regulator of tyrosine kinase signaling in the cell (13Howell B.W. Gertler F.B. Cooper J.A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 121-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). The phosphotyrosine binding (PTB) domain of Dab1, which mediates the interaction of the adaptor protein with the NPXY motifs in the cytoplasmic domains of the Reelin receptors, also has an independent affinity for phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate- or PI 4,5-bisphosphate-rich microdomains in the plasma membrane (14Howell B.W. Lanier L.M. Frank R. Gertler F.B. Cooper J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5179-5188Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). Both of these phospholipids are substrates for phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), a lipid kinase that is activated by tyrosine kinases at the cytoplasmic leaflet of the plasma membrane (15Chung C.Y.

Here we show that Reelin activates a PI3K-dependent signaling cascade in cultured embryonic neurons, resulting in the activation of protein kinase B (PKB; also called Akt) and the inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β) by phosphorylation on specific regulatory residues. Genetic evidence indicates that activation of Reelin-induced PI3K signaling is dependent on the presence of VLDLR, apoER2, and Dab1. Reelin signaling results in a reduction of cellular levels of specific phosphorylated forms of the microtubule-associated protein tau. Either inhibition of Reelin binding to its receptors or inhibition of PI3K prevents Reelin-induced activation of this pathway. Furthermore, all components of the Reelin pathway are present or enriched in the axonal growth cones, suggesting that leading processes of migrating neurons are sites where positional cues conferred by Reelin are first received. PI3K inhibitors wortmannin and LY294002 were purchased from Sigma and Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA), respectively. All other kinase and phosphatase inhibitors were purchased from Calbiochem. All other reagents were from Sigma. Animals deficient for apoER2 (lrp8) and VLDLR (vldlr) were maintained on a mixed C57BL/6J × 129 strain background (6Trommsdorff M. Gotthardt M. Hiesberger T. Shelton J. Stockinger W. Nimpf J.

All wild type, single apoer2 −/−and vldlr −/− mice, as well as doubleapoer2 −/−;vldlr −/−mice were littermates. Mice homozygous for the reeler spontaneous mutation (reln rl) were purchased from Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME) and were on a B6C3Fe background. Jon Cooper and Brian Howell generously provided Dab1-deficient mice (mixed Balb-c/B6 background) (7Howell B.W. Hawkes R. Soriano P. Cooper J.A. Nature. 1997; 389: 733-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar). All animals were maintained in accordance with National Institutes of Health and University of Texas Southwestern Animal Resources Center animal care guidelines. For PKB and CDK5 activities, 300 μg of total protein from cultured neurons were brought to 1 ml in freshly made kinase lysis buffer (0.5% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 25 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 80 mm glycerol phosphate, 2 mm sodium vanadate, 0.1 μmokadaic acid, and mammalian protease inhibitor mixture (10 μl/ml; Sigma). PKB was immunoprecipitated with 2 μg of mouse monoclonal anti-PKB antibody (SKB1 clone; Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY) and CDK5 with 2 μg of anti-CDK5 antibody (C-8; Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Control immunoprecipitates were done with 2 μg of either normal mouse or rabbit IgG. After overnight rotation at 4 °C, 20 μl of protein G-Sepharose were added, and the tubes were incubated for 2 h. Immunoprecipitates were washed twice with 1 ml of kinase lysis buffer and twice with kinase reaction buffer (KB buffer; 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol). Immunoprecipitated PKB and CDK5 were assayed in a total of 40 μl of KB buffer supplemented with 50 μm sodium orthovanadate, 1 μm PKI peptide (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA), 50 nm microcystin, 50 nm okadaic acid, 100 μm cold ATP/10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. Tubes containing immunoprecipitated PKB were incubated with 33 μm crosstide-paramyosin fusion protein as substrate (New England Biolabs) and CDK5 immunoprecipitates with 100 μmhistone H1 (Calbiochem). After 20 min of incubation at 30 °C, reaction mixtures were stopped by adding 20 μl of 2× Laemmli buffer. Samples were run on SDS-PAGE. Gels were dried after staining with Coomassie Blue. Kinase activity values were obtained using a Typhoon phosphor imager after overnight exposure. Background kinase activity values from immunoprecipitates with nonimmune control antibodies were subtracted. Stably transfected HEK-293 cells expressing recombinant full-length mouse Reelin (18D'Arcangelo G. Nakajima K. Miyata T. Ogawa M. Mikoshiba K. Curran T. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 23-31Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were kindly provided by Michael Frotscher and Eckardt Förster (University of Freiburg). For a typical batch of Reelin, nontransfected HEK-293 and Reelin-expressing cells were grown on 10 81-cm2 dishes with ∼4 × 106 cells/dish in 20 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (low glucose with 0.2% bovine serum albumin). Cells were grown for 2 days, and Reelin- or mock-conditioned media were collected, centrifuged at 3,000 × g for 15 min, and sterile-filtered. The supernatant was concentrated 20–40-fold using 100-kDa cut-off centrifugal filters (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). To ascertain that activation of the PI3K pathway was dependent on Reelin, concentrated Reelin samples were size-fractionated by gel filtration on Superose 6. Fractions containing full-length Reelin (∼50% of total protein in the fractions) were pooled and tested for their ability to stimulate PI3K-dependent phosphorylation of PKB and GSK-3β. Results from these control experiments were indistinguishable from Reelin-conditioned culture supernatant experiments. Control media from untransfected 293 cells were collected, concentrated, and applied to cultured cells under the exact same conditions and in exactly the same relative concentrations as the Reelin-containing samples. Embryonic cortical neurons from mice (E15-E16) or rats (E17-E18) were obtained using standard protocols (19Banker G. Goslin K. Nature. 1988; 336: 185-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). For wild type mice or rats, embryos were collected at E15. Cortical lobes were isolated, and after removing the meninges, the lobes were chopped into small pieces, pooled, and trypsinized for 15 min at 37 °C. Trypsinization was stopped by the addition of fetal calf serum (one-twentieth volume). After centrifugation, cells were washed twice in Hanks' balanced salt solution (Invitrogen). Neurons were dissociated by triturating 40 times in Hanks' balanced salt solution with 12 mm MgCl2, 0.025% DNase, 0.4 μg/ml trypsin inhibitor, and 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin with a polished glass Pasteur pipette and transferred to Neurobasal medium containing B27 serum supplement (Invitrogen), penicillin/streptomycin, and 1 mm l-glutamine. Cells were plated at ∼1000 cells/mm2 on poly-d-lysine (Sigma)-coated plates. Wild type embryonic neurons were obtained from mouse or from rat embryos and yielded identical results in all experiments. For Dab1 or apoER2/VLDLR-deficient cultures, mouse embryos were treated individually until plating onto cell culture dishes, with a hind portion of the embryo used for genotyping. After 3 days in culture, one-half of the neuronal culture medium was exchanged for fresh medium. On day 4 after plating, cells were stimulated either with mock-conditioned medium or with Reelin (see above). The estimated final concentration of Reelin added to the culture medium was 5 nm. Cells were washed once in PBS and then lysed with lysis buffer (PBS with 2 mmEDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.25% deoxycholic acid, 0.5% SDS, protease inhibitors (mixture tablets, EDTA-free; Roche Molecular Biochemicals), phosphatase inhibitor mixture 1 and 2 (Sigma)). Lysate was centrifuged for 20 min at 4 °C, and supernatants were assayed for protein content. The glutathioneS-transferase (GST) receptor-associated protein (RAP) fusion protein and GST protein were prepared as described (20Herz J. Goldstein J.L. Strickland D.K. Ho Y.K. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21232-21238Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). GST-RAP and GST were added at 30 μg/ml for 1 h prior to and during Reelin stimulation. PI3K inhibitors LY294002 (catalog no. 9901; Cell Signaling Technology) and Wortmannin (W1628; Sigma) were applied at the indicated concentrations 1 h prior to Reelin stimulation and for duration of the assay. Equal amounts of protein (10 μg for neuronal cultures and 25 μg for brain fractions) were separated by 4–15% gradient SDS gel electrophoresis, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and blocked in Blotto (5% milk in phosphate-buffered saline with 0.05% Tween 20, pH 7.4; Sigma) for 1 h. Membranes were incubated overnight at 4 °C with polyclonal or monoclonal antibodies directed against Dab1, apoER2, CDK5 (sc-173; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), phospho-GSK-3β (Ser9) (catalog no. 9336; Cell Signaling Technology), GSK-3β (G22320; Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY), phospho-PKB (Ser473) (44-622; BioSource, Camarillo, CA), PKB (catalog no. 9272; Cell Signaling Technology), PI3K (06-497; Upstate Biotechnology), phospho-PTEN (Ser380) (catalog no. 9551; Cell Signaling Technology), Reelin (G10; kindly provided by Andre Goffinet), phosphotyrosine (4G10; Upstate Biotechnology), or phospho-PKB (Thr308) (catalog no. 9275; Cell Signaling Technology) or AT8 antibody (Innogenetics, Ghent, Belgium). After washing, secondary horseradish peroxidase-linked antibodies (Amersham Biosciences) were applied at 1:2000 in Blotto for 1 h, washed, and developed with SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate (Pierce) and exposed to Kodak X-Omat Blue XB-1 film (Eastman Kodak Co.). Reelin-stimulated neurons were harvested in radioimmune precipitation buffer (PBS with 5 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 0.1% deoxycholic acid, phosphatase, and protease inhibitors). Samples were normalized for protein and then incubated with Dab1 antibody or preimmune antibodies that were bound to protein A-Sepharose (Sigma) at 4 °C for 2 h, followed by three washes with radioimmune precipitation buffer. Proteins were eluted with twice-concentrated gel-loading buffer (4% SDS, 40% glycerol, 0.2m Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 5.6 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 5 mm EDTA, and 0.02% bromphenol blue) at 100 °C for 5 min, followed by 4–15% SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. Fetal rat brain (gestational stage E18) was fractionated as described by Pfenninger et al. (21Pfenninger K.H. Ellis L. Johnson M.P. Friedman L.B. Somlo S. Cell. 1983; 35: 573-584Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar) to obtain growth cone particles. Briefly, the low speed supernatant of fetal brain homogenate was loaded on a discontinuous sucrose gradient in which the 0.75 and 1 m sucrose layers were replaced with a single 0.83 m sucrose step. This facilitated collection of the interface and increased growth cone particle yield without decreasing purity (22Lohse K. Helmke S.M. Wood M.R. Quiroga S. de la Houssaye B.A. Miller V.E.

The 0.32 m/0.83 minterface was collected, diluted with 0.32 m sucrose, and centrifuged to yield the GCP fraction, which was resuspended in 0.32m sucrose for use in experiments. Cortical neurons were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus B27 supplement (Invitrogen) for 3 days on dishes coated with 0.3 mg/ml poly-d-lysine. After stimulation with mock-conditioned media or with Reelin, cells were processed for immunocytochemistry. Briefly, cells were first washed with warm PHEM buffer (60 mm Pipes, 25 mm Hepes, 10 mm EGTA, 1 mmMgCl2, pH 7.4) and fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde, 0.01% glutaraldehyde in PHEM at 37 °C for 10 min. After fixation, cells were washed three times with PBS, extracted with 0.2% Triton X-100 for 10 min, and blocked in 10% goat serum, 5% bovine serum albumin for 1 h. Primary antibodies were diluted in block solution and incubated overnight at 4 °C. Immunohistochemistry-specific polyclonal rabbit anti-phospho-PKB (Cell Signaling Technology) and 4G10 antibody were used at a 1:100 dilution. Monoclonal anti-tubulin (DM1A clone) was used at a 1:400 dilution. Secondary antibodies were goat anti-mouse IgG-labeled with OG488 or goat anti-rabbit Texas Red (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) used at a 1:400 dilution in block solution. Images were acquired with an Orca CCD camera (Hamamatsu) controlled by OpenLab software (Improvision) and processed for presentation in Adobe Photoshop. To identify the biochemical signaling pathways that are activated by Reelin signaling in the embryonic brain, we developed a sensitivein vitro assay in which we could follow the regulation of cellular kinase activities in whole cell lysates in response to Reelin exposure. To achieve this, it was necessary to reduce Reelin-independent cellular signal input that would otherwise differentially affect the various pools of these kinases and thereby obscure any Reelin-specific effect. This was accomplished by culturing primary embryonic neurons for several days in a minimal medium before stimulation with recombinant Reelin. Reelin-independent kinase activation, for instance by cell adhesion molecules such as integrins, was minimized by plating the cells on polylysine instead of other commonly used mixtures of extracellular matrix components. Reelin was partially purified from the supernatant of stably transfected 293 cells by column chromatography and size exclusion filtration. Conditioned medium from nontransfected 293 cells served as a control in all experiments. Exposure of cultured neurons to Reelin (Fig. 1 A, lane 2) greatly increased the levels of phosphorylated Dab1 in immunoprecipitates (upper panel) as well as in whole cell lysates (middle panel) compared with mock medium (lane 1). Since tau is hyperphosphorylated in animals genetically deficient in Reelin signaling (5Hiesberger T. Trommsdorff M. Howell B.W. Goffinet A. Mumby M.C. Cooper J.A. Herz J. Neuron. 1999; 24: 481-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (791) Google Scholar), we investigated whether Reelin can directly reduce tau phosphorylation in primary neuronal cultures. Immunoblot analysis of extracts with an antibody directed against the tau phospho-Ser202/Thr205 epitope revealed a marked reduction of phospho-tau in response to Reelin. This suggested that one or more kinases that phosphorylate tau at this site are inhibited as a result of Reelin signaling. Two multifunctional neuronal kinases implicated in tau phosphorylation are CDK5 and GSK-3β. The activity of the latter is inhibited by phosphorylation of a serine at position 9 by PKB. Enzymatic activity of the total cellular pool of CDK5 was unaffected by Reelin (93.2 ± 4.5% of control). However, the activity of PKB, the primary cellular kinase inhibiting GSK-3β, was increased 2-fold in the same cells (205.6 ± 5.0% of control). This suggested that PKB and GSK-3β might be part of a Reelin signaling cascade. A time course experiment (Fig. 1 B) showed that Dab1 phosphorylation reached maximal levels after 20 min of Reelin stimulation (lane 4). Phosphorylation of both GSK-3β and PKB showed a similar pattern of activation, with maximal phosphorylation by 20–30 min and a clear reduction by 60 min. Total levels of GSK-3β and PKB remained unchanged under the same conditions. Enzymatic activity of PKB, but not CDK5, was stimulated by Reelin and correlated with phosphorylation of PKB on Ser473. All subsequent experiments were thus carried out for 20 min. Maximal activation of PKB requires phosphorylation at two sites: Ser473 and Thr308. To determine whether Reelin differentially affected the phosphorylation of PKB at these sites, we performed the experiment shown in Fig. 1 C. Primary embryonic neurons were unstimulated (lanes 1 and2), exposed to mock medium (lanes 3and 4), or exposed to Reelin (lanes 5and 6). Whereas Thr308 phosphorylation was unaffected by any of these conditions, Ser473phosphorylation was induced only when Reelin was present (lanes 5 and 6) and correlated with Dab1 phosphorylation in both rat and mouse primary cultured neurons (Fig. 1, B and C, respectively). Total levels of Dab1, PKB, and GSK-3β remained unchanged with Reelin treatment. RAP universally blocks the binding of ligands to LDL receptor family members (20Herz J. Goldstein J.L. Strickland D.K. Ho Y.K. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21232-21238Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Strickland D.K. Ashcom J.D. Williams S. Burgess W.H. Migliorini M. Argraves W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 17401-17404Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). RAP also blocks the Reelin-induced phosphorylation of Dab1 in primary neurons by preventing Reelin binding to apoER2 and VLDLR (5Hiesberger T. Trommsdorff M. Howell B.W. Goffinet A. Mumby M.C. Cooper J.A. Herz J. Neuron. 1999; 24: 481-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (791) Google Scholar). To determine whether the phosphorylation of PKB and GSK-3β requires Reelin binding to both receptors and subsequent Dab1 phosphorylation, we incubated primary mouse neurons in the presence (Fig. 2 a, lanes 1, 4, and 6) or absence (lanes 2, 3, 5, and7) of Reelin, GST-RAP fusion protein (lanes 3–5), or the GST control protein (lanes 6 and 7). A similar experiment was performed in primary rat neurons (Fig. 2 b). GST-RAP effectively blocked Reelin-induced Dab1 phosphorylation (Fig. 2 a,lane 4), whereas GST-RAP alone had no effect (Fig. 2 a, lanes 3 and 5). Reelin-stimulated phosphorylation of PKB at Ser473 was markedly reduced by GST-RAP (Fig. 2 a, comparelane 4 with lanes 1 and6; Fig. 2 b, compare lanes 2and 6 with lane 4). GST control protein did not affect Reelin-induced phosphorylation of Dab1, PKB, and GSK-3β (Fig. 2, a and b). Phosphorylation of GSK-3β at Ser9 in response to Reelin was also reduced in the presence of RAP (Fig. 2 b, lane 4). Total levels of Dab1, PKB, and GSK-3β were comparable between the samples and unaffected by the various conditions (Fig. 2, aand b). Since RAP will inhibit ligand binding to all LDL receptor family members, we designed a genetic approach to determine whether apoER2 and VLDLR specifically were responsible for the Reelin-mediated phosphorylation of PKB and GSK-3β. To achieve this, we isolated neurons from mice lacking various numbers of alleles for both receptors. Since apoER2/VLDLR double deficient mice do not survive to breeding age (6Trommsdorff M. Gotthardt M. Hiesberger T. Shelton J. Stockinger W. Nimpf J. Hammer R.E. Richardson J.A. Herz J. Cell. 1999; 97: 689-701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1089) Google Scholar), we used crosses between mice that lacked three of the four receptor alleles. This generated pregnancies in which 25% of the embryos were deficient for both receptors, with remaining embryos containing one or two wild type alleles to serve as controls. Fig.3 shows that Reelin is capable of stimulating phosphorylation of Dab1 or PKB, as long as the embryos from which the neurons had been isolated retained at least one functional apoER2 or VLDLR allele (Fig. 3 a). In mice that were completely deficient in apoER2 and VLDLR, no appreciable Reelin-stimulated phosphorylation of either Dab1 or PKB was detected (Fig. 3 a). Total levels of PKB or Dab1 (not shown) were not changed by treatment with mock or Reelin. Dab1 is one of several cytoplasmic adaptor proteins that bind to the intracellular domains of apoER2 and VLDLR (24Gotthardt M. Trommsdorff M. Nevitt M.F. Shelton J. Richardson J.A. Stockinger W.

Schneider W.J. Nimpf J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25625-25632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). To determine whether Dab1 or some other adaptor or scaffolding protein were required for Reelin-mediated activation of the PKB pathway, we prepared neurons from embryos that were wild type, heterozygous, or homozygous for thedab1 knockout allele. As expected, no phosphorylated or total Dab1 protein was detected indab1 −/− neurons (Fig.3 b, lanes 1 and 2), and Reelin-induced phosphorylation of PKB on Ser473 or of GSK-3β on Ser9 occurred only in cells that contained at least one functional dab1 allele (lanes 3–6). Total levels of PKB and GSK-3β were independent ofdab1 genotype or Reelin treatment. To determine whether Reelin stimulation of PKB and inhibition of GSK-3β required activation of PI3K, we incubated neurons with Reelin in the presence or absence of PI3K inhibitors: LY294002 (Fig.4 A) or wortmannin (Fig.4 B). Dab1 phosphorylation by Reelin was unaltered whether or not LY294002 was present (Fig. 4 A). However, Reelin-induced phosphorylation of both PKB and GSK-3β were completely blocked by LY294002 (lanes 5 and 6), although total levels of both proteins remained unchanged. Wortmannin also markedly inhibited phosphorylation of PKB at Ser473 (Fig.4 B). Activation of PI3K and subsequent phosphorylation of PKB can also be achieved by inactivation of a negative regulator of PI3K, the lipid phosphatase PTEN. However, no changes in the phosphorylation state of PTEN at its regulatory Ser380residue were observed under any conditions (data not shown), suggesting that PTEN protein was not involved in Reelin signaling. Migrating neurons in the mammalian brain probably receive extracellular signals through their leading processes or growth cones. We found that the Reelin receptor apoER2 and the adaptor protein Dab1 as well as PI3K were relatively enriched in purified axonal growth cones from fetal rat brains (Fig. 5 A). PKB was also present in growth cones but appeared similarly distributed between growth cones and total cell lysate. The enrichment of nonphosphorylated tau and GAP-43 and the relative depletion of the dendritic marker MAP2 confirm the high degree of enrichment of axonal growth cones that was achieved in this preparation (22Lohse K. Helmke S.M. Wood M.R. Quiroga S. de la Houssaye B.A. Miller V.E. Negre-Aminou P. Pfenninger K.H. Brain Res. Dev. Brain Res. 1996; 96: 83-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar).

The Cu and B nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra at 35 millikelvin indicate an apparently discontinuous phase transition from uniform magnetization to a modulated superstructure near 27 tesla, above which a magnetization plateau at 1/8 of the full saturation has been observed. Comparison of the Cu NMR spectrum and the theoretical analysis of a Heisenberg spin model demonstrates the crystallization of itinerant triplets in the plateau phase within a large rhomboid unit cell (16 spins per layer) showing oscillations of the spin polarization. Thus, we are now in possession of an interesting model system to study a localization transition of strongly interacting quantum particles."

Vanadate has previously been used as a transition state mimic of protein enzymes that catalyze the same reaction. Comparison of the 2.2 angstrom resolution structure of a vanadate–hairpin ribozyme complex with structures of precursor and product complexes reveals a rigid active site that makes more hydrogen bonds to the transition state than to the precursor or product. Because of the paucity of RNA functional groups capable of general acid-base or electrostatic catalysis, transition state stabilization is likely to be an important catalytic strategy for ribozymes."
https://openalex.org/W2027204577,"Chronologies for Late Quaternary marine sediment records are usually based on radiocarbon ages of planktonic foraminifera. Signals carried by other sedimentary components measured in parallel can provide complementary paleoclimate information. A key premise is that microfossils and other indicators within a given sediment horizon are of equal age. We show here that haptophyte-derived alkenones isolated from Bermuda Rise drift sediments are up to 7000 years older than coexisting planktonic foraminifera. This temporal offset, which is apparently due to lateral transport of alkenones on fine-grained particles from the Nova Scotian margin, markedly influences molecular estimates of sea surface temperatures. More broadly, the observation raises questions about both the temporal and the geographic fidelity of paleoenvironmental records encoded by readily transported components of sediments."
https://openalex.org/W1992568289,"Highly uniform and conformal coatings can be made by the alternating exposures of a surface to vapors of two reactants, in a process commonly called atomic layer deposition (ALD). The application of ALD has, however, been limited because of slow deposition rates, with a theoretical maximum of one monolayer per cycle. We show that alternating exposure of a surface to vapors of trimethylaluminum and tris(tert-butoxy)silanol deposits highly conformal layers of amorphous silicon dioxide and aluminum oxide nanolaminates at rates of 12 nanometers (more than 32 monolayers) per cycle. This process allows for the uniform lining or filling of long, narrow holes. We propose that these ALD layers grow by a previously unknown catalytic mechanism that also operates during the rapid ALD of many other metal silicates. This process should allow improved production of many devices, such as trench insulation between transistors in microelectronics, planar waveguides, microelectromechanical structures, multilayer optical filters, and protective layers against diffusion, oxidation, or corrosion."

Polycrystalline fibers are oriented with the outer contour of the jaw. Using nanoindentation, we show that the mineral has a structural role and enhances hardness and stiffness.

We report the neural correlates of depth perception from texture gradient in the cortex. In the caudal part of the lateral bank of intraparietal sulcus, many neurons were selective to 3D surface orientation defined by texture gradient, and their response was invariant over different types of texture pattern. Most of these neurons were also sensitive to a disparity gradient, suggesting that they integrate texture and disparity gradient signals to construct a generalized representation of 3D surface orientation."

Androgens control a variety of developmental processes that create the male phenotype and are important for male fertility.

These ligand-regulated transcription factors are composed of single polypeptides harboring three separable functional domains as follows: a relatively well conserved C-terminal ligand-binding domain, a highly conserved DNA-binding domain, and a poorly conserved N-terminal domain. In the absence of ligand, AR is complexed in the cytoplasm to chaperone proteins that keep the receptor in a transcriptionally inactive form. Upon binding the hormone, AR dissociates from the chaperones and translocates to the nucleus where it binds to androgen-response elements (AREs) (1Quigley C.A. De Bellis A. Marschke K.B. El-Wady M.K.

Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) is a powerful technique to recognize endogenous transcription factors assembled onto gene promoters in vivo (21Hecht A. Grunstein M.

Our results show that in androgen-treated LNCaP cells, loading of AR and recruitment of coactivators and pol II to the PSA promoter is a transient and cyclic event that involves hyperacetylation of core histones.

Both the cyclic nature of PSA promoter occupancy by AR and androgen-mediated induction of PSA mRNA accumulation are abolished by a proteasome inhibitor, indicating that proteasome function is critically involved in the regulation of AR-dependent transcription.DISCUSSIONIn this work, we have shown that agonist-dependent loading of holo-AR and recruitment of coactivators and pol II to PSA and KLK2 promoters in LNCaP cells are transient and cyclic. Even though the anti-androgen bicalutamide-liganded AR was able to occupy the promoter, it was incapable of recruiting pol II and coactivators. Importantly, both the cyclic nature of PSA promoter occupancy by AR and androgen-elicited induction of PSA mRNA accumulation were abolished by a proteasome inhibitor, indicating that proteasome function is a critical mechanism in AR-dependent transcriptional regulation.Remodeling of chromatin by covalent modifications of nucleosomal proteins is an important event in transcription (11Kingston R.E. Narlikar G.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2339-2352Google Scholar, 46Kadam S. Emerson B.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2002; 14: 262-268Google Scholar, 47Rice J.C. Allis C.D. Nature. 2001; 414: 258-261Google Scholar). The degree of core histone acetylation generally correlates with the transcriptional status on a given gene (11Kingston R.E. Narlikar G.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2339-2352Google Scholar, 16Chen H. Lin R.J. Xie W. Wilpitz D. Evans R.M. Cell. 1999; 98: 675-686Google Scholar, 47Rice J.C. Allis C.D. Nature. 2001; 414: 258-261Google Scholar). In this work, we show that the acetylation state of histone H3 on the PSA promoter increases rapidly in response to T treatment and AR occupancy. Assembly of the AR transcription complex resembles rapid and cyclic association of holo-ERα and a number of coactivators with the cathepsin promoterin vivo (13Shang Y. Hu X. DiRenzo J. Lazar M.A. Brown M. Cell. 2000; 103: 843-852Google Scholar). Also with the pS2 promoter, estrogen treatment results in hyperacetylation of histones H3 and H4 with concurrent recruitment of the TATA-binding protein to the promoter (48Sewack G.F. Ellis T.W. Hansen U. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1404-1415Google Scholar). Interestingly, recruitment of SRC and vitamin D receptor-interacting protein complexes to the pS2 promoter occurs at opposite phases, suggesting an exchange between these coactivator complexes (49Burakov D. Crofts L.A. Chang C.-P.B. Freedman L.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 14359-14362Google Scholar). Ordered recruitment of histone acetyltransferases and the thyroid hormone-associated protein complexes has also been shown recently (50Sharma D. Fondell J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7934-7939Google Scholar) to take place in the thyroid hormone-responsive dio1 promoter, and histone acetylation is a prerequisite for thyroid hormone-associated protein/mediator recruitment. Moreover, binding of p65/RelA to the IκBα promoter in response to lipopolysaccharide stimulus is also a fast and transient process with rapid changes in histone acetylation (51Saccani S. Pantano S. Natoli G. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 193: 1351-1359Google Scholar). These results suggest that the cyclic dynamics of transcription complex assembly is a common feature of promoters activated by inducible transcription factors.Regular cycling of nuclear receptor transcription complexes may represent a mechanism that enables continuous monitoring of the environment (13Shang Y. Hu X. DiRenzo J. Lazar M.A. Brown M. Cell. 2000; 103: 843-852Google Scholar). What could be the biochemical mechanism underlying the release of the transcription complexes from the promoters? An inhibitor of cdk7 and cdk9, protein kinases responsible for phosphorylation of the C-terminal domain of pol II large subunit, stabilized ERα transcription complexes, suggesting that the release of these complexes requires phosphorylation of pol II (13Shang Y. Hu X. DiRenzo J. Lazar M.A. Brown M. Cell. 2000; 103: 843-852Google Scholar). The cyclicity may also be regulated via phosphorylation of steroid receptors and through modifications of coactivators. Notably, cdk7 kinase is also able to phosphorylate nuclear receptors, including ERα (52Chen D. Riedl T. Washbrook E. Pace P.E. Coombes R.C. Egly J.M. Ali S. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 127-137Google Scholar, 53Keriel A. Stary A. Sarasin A. Rochette-Egly C. Egly J.M. Cell. 2002; 109: 125-135Google Scholar). Phosphorylation often marks proteins for ubiquitination and subsequent degradation (54Weissman A.M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 169-178Google Scholar). Our data implicating the proteasome in AR-dependent transcription and release of AR from the PSA promoter is in line with the findings that the proteasome regulatory particle and proteasome-mediated degradation of transcriptional activators are coupled to the transcription process (40Conaway R.C. Brower C.S. Conaway J.W. Science. 2002; 296: 1254-1258Google Scholar, 41Molinari E. Gilman M. Natesan S. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6439-6447Google Scholar, 42Salghetti S.E. Caudy A.A. Chenoweth J.G.

EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3760-3769Google Scholar). These data suggest that degradation of AR and/or other proteins in the AR transcription complex is necessary for subsequent rounds of transcription.In addition to an agonist-bound AR, anti-androgen-liganded receptor is also loaded onto the PSA promoter in vivo. This is in line with the ability of CDX-occupied AR to translocate to the nucleus and to interact with AREs in transfected cells (23Karvonen U. Kallio P.J. Jänne O.A. Palvimo J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 271: 15973-15979Google Scholar, 56Tomura A. Goto K. Morinaga H. Nomura M. Okabe T. Yanase T. Takayanagi R. Nawata H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28395-28401Google Scholar, 57Poukka H. Karvonen U. Yoshikawa N. Tanaka H. Palvimo J.J. Jänne O.A. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 2991-3001Google Scholar). However, anti-androgen does not allow the assembly of the AR transcription complex, as the loading of AR onto the PSA promoter was not accompanied by recruitment of pol II, CBP, and GRIP1, indicating that an agonist-elicited conformation is mandatory for the proper assembly of the AR transcription complex. Agonists also influence the phosphorylation and the small ubiquitin-related modifier 1 (SUMO-1) modification of AR (58Gioeli D. Ficarro S.B. Kwiek J.J. Aaronson D. Hancock M. Catling A.D. White F.M. Christian R.E. Settlage R.E. Shabanowitz J. Hunt D.F. Weber M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29304-29314Google Scholar, 59Poukka H. Karvonen U. Jänne O.A. Palvimo J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 14145-14150Google Scholar), and it is thus possible that a specific covalent modification of AR is involved in the assembly. The lack of recruitment of coactivators in the presence of CDX is in accordance with our recent finding that AR exposed to CDX fails to influence nuclear distribution of GRIP1 (60Karvonen U. Jänne O.A. Palvimo J.J. FEBS Lett. 2002; 523: 43-47Google Scholar). Moreover, Shang et al.(61Shang Y. Myers M. Brown M. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 601-610Google Scholar) recently reported similar results on bicalutamide and the loading of AR onto the PSA promoter. They additionally showed that the bicalutamide induces recruitment of corepressor complexes to the proximal promoter but not to the upstream enhancer region (ARE III).Besides the factors of the general transcription machinery and coactivators with histone acetyltransferase or methyltransferase activity, several other proteins are known to interact with AR in vitro and activate AR function in reporter gene assays (9Heinlein C.A. Chang C. Endocr. Rev. 2002; 23: 175-200Google Scholar, 10Jänne O.A. Moilanen A.M. Poukka H. Rouleau N. Karvonen U. Kotaja N. Häkli M. Palvimo J.J. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2000; 28: 401-405Google Scholar). However, very little is known about the role of these factors, some of which are expressed in a cell-specific fashion, in the assembly or disassembly of AR transcription complexes. The potential cell type- and promoter-specific differences in the AR transcription complexes as well as characterization of the complexes during the postulated ligand-independent activation of transcription by AR (62Culig Z. Hobisch A. Cronauer M.V. Radmay C. Trapman J. Hittmair A. Bartsch G. Klocker H. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 5474-5478Google Scholar) warrant further studies. Androgens control a variety of developmental processes that create the male phenotype and are important for male fertility. Notably, androgens play a key role both in the development and maintenance of normal prostate and in the initiation and progression of prostate cancer, the most common male malignancy in the Western world (1Quigley C.A. De Bellis A. Marschke K.B. El-Wady M.K. Wilson E.M. French F.S. Endocr. Rev. 1995; 16: 271-321Google Scholar, 2Gelmann E.P. J. Clin. Oncol. 2002; 20: 3001-3015Google Scholar). The action of androgens is mediated through the androgen receptor (AR) 1The abbreviations used are: AR, androgen receptor; AcH3, acetylated histone H3; ARE, androgen-response element; CBP, CRE-binding protein-binding protein; CDX, casodex; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; ER, estrogen receptor; FCS, fetal calf serum; GRIP1, glucocorticoid receptor-interacting protein 1; KLK2, kallikrein 2; PCAF, p300/CBP-associated factor; pol II, RNA polymerase II; PSA, prostate-specific antigen; T, testosterone; CREB, cAMP-response element-binding protein; PMSF, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; nt, nucleotide; snRNA, small nuclear RNA; SRC, steroid receptor coactivator. 1The abbreviations used are: AR, androgen receptor; AcH3, acetylated histone H3; ARE, androgen-response element; CBP, CRE-binding protein-binding protein; CDX, casodex; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; ER, estrogen receptor; FCS, fetal calf serum; GRIP1, glucocorticoid receptor-interacting protein 1; KLK2, kallikrein 2; PCAF, p300/CBP-associated factor; pol II, RNA polymerase II; PSA, prostate-specific antigen; T, testosterone; CREB, cAMP-response element-binding protein; PMSF, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; nt, nucleotide; snRNA, small nuclear RNA; SRC, steroid receptor coactivator. that belongs to the steroid hormone subfamily of nuclear receptors (3Beato M. Herrlich P. Schütz G. Cell. 1995; 83: 851-857Google Scholar). These ligand-regulated transcription factors are composed of single polypeptides harboring three separable functional domains as follows: a relatively well conserved C-terminal ligand-binding domain, a highly conserved DNA-binding domain, and a poorly conserved N-terminal domain. In the absence of ligand, AR is complexed in the cytoplasm to chaperone proteins that keep the receptor in a transcriptionally inactive form. Upon binding the hormone, AR dissociates from the chaperones and translocates to the nucleus where it binds to androgen-response elements (AREs) (1Quigley C.A. De Bellis A. Marschke K.B. El-Wady M.K. Wilson E.M. French F.S. Endocr. Rev. 1995; 16: 271-321Google Scholar, 2Gelmann E.P. J. Clin. Oncol. 2002; 20: 3001-3015Google Scholar). Experiments performed under in vitroconditions have suggested that the ligand-induced conformational change enables the receptor to recruit coactivators and/or proteins of the general transcriptional machinery to target gene promoters (4Beato M. Sánchez-Pacheco A. Endocr. Rev. 1996; 17: 587-609Google Scholar, 5McKenna N.J. Lanz R.B. O'Malley B.W. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 321-344Google Scholar, 6Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G.

Metab. 2002; 13: 55-60Google Scholar). The best characterized coactivators include the steroid receptor coactivator (SRC) family members (SRC-1, SRC-2/glucocorticoid receptor-interacting protein 1(GRIP1)/transcription intermediary factor 2 (TIF2), and SRC-3/activator of thyroid and retinoic receptor/amplified in breast cancer (AIB1)), CREB-binding protein (CBP/p300), and CBP/p300-associated factor (PCAF). A growing list of recently discovered AR coregulators supports the notion that a complex network of proteins regulates transcription by androgens (9Heinlein C.A. Chang C. Endocr. Rev. 2002; 23: 175-200Google Scholar, 10Jänne O.A. Moilanen A.M. Poukka H. Rouleau N. Karvonen U. Kotaja N. Häkli M. Palvimo J.J. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2000; 28: 401-405Google Scholar). Histone acetylation is a dynamic process directed by histone acetyltransferases and histone deacetylases, resulting in alterations in nucleosome structure (6Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 121-141Crossref Google Scholar, 11Kingston R.E. Narlikar G.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2339-2352Google Scholar, 12Kim M.Y. Hsiao S.J. Kraus W.L. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6084-6094Google Scholar). Acetylation of histone tails is thought to relax chromatin packaging and thereby facilitate gene transcription. Recruitment of complexes that affect acetylation of chromatin domains has been shown to be important for transcriptional regulation by steroid receptors (5McKenna N.J. Lanz R.B. O'Malley B.W. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 321-344Google Scholar, 6Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 121-141Crossref Google Scholar, 7McKenna H.J. O'Malley B.W. Cell. 2002; 108: 465-474Google Scholar, 8Hermanson O. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2002; 13: 55-60Google Scholar). Many of the coactivator molecules, including PCAF, CBP/p300, and SRC-1, possess inherent histone acetyltransferase activity (5McKenna N.J. Lanz R.B. O'Malley B.W. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 321-344Google Scholar, 6Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 121-141Crossref Google Scholar, 7McKenna H.J. O'Malley B.W. Cell. 2002; 108: 465-474Google Scholar, 8Hermanson O. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2002; 13: 55-60Google Scholar). Recent assays in vivo have revealed that holo-estrogen receptor (ER) α and several coactivators indeed assemble onto estrogen-responsive promoters in a cyclic fashion and in a specific order, indicating that promoter remodeling by histone acetylation is a dynamic and stepwise process (13Shang Y. Hu X. DiRenzo J. Lazar M.A. Brown M. Cell. 2000; 103: 843-852Google Scholar). In addition to core histones, CBP/p300 and PCAF are capable of acetylating steroid receptors, such as AR and ER, and the coactivator SRC-3/activator of thyroid and retinoic receptor/AIB1 (14Wang C. Fu M. Angeletti R.H. Siconolfi-Baez L. Reutens A.T. Albanese C. Lisanti M.P. Katzenellenbogen B.S. Kato S. Hopp T. Fuqua S.A.W. Lopez G.N. Kushner P.J. Pestell R.G. J. Biol.

In contrast to coactivators, corepressors bind to nuclear receptors in the absence of ligand, or in the presence of an antagonist, and recruit histone deacetylases, leading to condensation of nucleosomal structures and repression of transcription (6Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 121-141Crossref Google Scholar, 8Hermanson O. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2002; 13: 55-60Google Scholar). AR is able to interact in vitro, in cell-free systems and in transfection assays, with the general transcription factors TFIIH and TFIIF and a large number of nuclear coregulatory proteins (9Heinlein C.A. Chang C. Endocr. Rev. 2002; 23: 175-200Google Scholar, 10Jänne O.A. Moilanen A.M. Poukka H. Rouleau N. Karvonen U. Kotaja N. Häkli M. Palvimo J.J. Biochem. Soc.

A. 1997; 94: 8485-8490Google Scholar). However, the physiological significance of the majority of these interactions has remained elusive. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) is a powerful technique to recognize endogenous transcription factors assembled onto gene promoters in vivo (21Hecht A. Grunstein M. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 304: 399-414Google Scholar). To understand better AR-dependent transcription in vivo, we have performed ChIP assays in LNCaP cells using the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) as the main target promoter (22Cleutjens K.B.J.M. van Eekelen C.C.E.M. van der Korput H.A.G.M. Brinkmann A.O. Trapman J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6379-6388Google Scholar). Our results show that in androgen-treated LNCaP cells, loading of AR and recruitment of coactivators and pol II to the PSA promoter is a transient and cyclic event that involves hyperacetylation of core histones. Even though the anti-androgen bicalutamide-occupied AR is able to associate with the promoter, it is incapable of recruiting pol II and coactivators. Both the cyclic nature of PSA promoter occupancy by AR and androgen-mediated induction of PSA mRNA accumulation are abolished by a proteasome inhibitor, indicating that proteasome function is critically involved in the regulation of AR-dependent transcription. DISCUSSIONIn this work, we have shown that agonist-dependent loading of holo-AR and recruitment of coactivators and pol II to PSA and KLK2 promoters in LNCaP cells are transient and cyclic. Even though the anti-androgen bicalutamide-liganded AR was able to occupy the promoter, it was incapable of recruiting pol II and coactivators.

These data suggest that degradation of AR and/or other proteins in the AR transcription complex is necessary for subsequent rounds of transcription.In addition to an agonist-bound AR, anti-androgen-liganded receptor is also loaded onto the PSA promoter in vivo. This is in line with the ability of CDX-occupied AR to translocate to the nucleus and to interact with AREs in transfected cells (23Karvonen U. Kallio P.J. Jänne O.A. Palvimo J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 271: 15973-15979Google Scholar, 56Tomura A. Goto K. Morinaga H. Nomura M. Okabe T. Yanase T. Takayanagi R. Nawata H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28395-28401Google Scholar, 57Poukka H.

However, anti-androgen does not allow the assembly of the AR transcription complex, as the loading of AR onto the PSA promoter was not accompanied by recruitment of pol II, CBP, and GRIP1, indicating that an agonist-elicited conformation is mandatory for the proper assembly of the AR transcription complex. Agonists also influence the phosphorylation and the small ubiquitin-related modifier 1 (SUMO-1) modification of AR (58Gioeli D. Ficarro S.B. Kwiek J.J. Aaronson D. Hancock M. Catling A.D. White F.M.

A. 2000; 97: 14145-14150Google Scholar), and it is thus possible that a specific covalent modification of AR is involved in the assembly. The lack of recruitment of coactivators in the presence of CDX is in accordance with our recent finding that AR exposed to CDX fails to influence nuclear distribution of GRIP1 (60Karvonen U. Jänne O.A. Palvimo J.J. FEBS Lett. 2002; 523: 43-47Google Scholar). Moreover, Shang et al.(61Shang Y. Myers M. Brown M. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 601-610Google Scholar) recently reported similar results on bicalutamide and the loading of AR onto the PSA promoter. They additionally showed that the bicalutamide induces recruitment of corepressor complexes to the proximal promoter but not to the upstream enhancer region (ARE III).Besides the factors of the general transcription machinery and coactivators with histone acetyltransferase or methyltransferase activity, several other proteins are known to interact with AR in vitro and activate AR function in reporter gene assays (9Heinlein C.A. Chang C. Endocr. Rev. 2002; 23: 175-200Google Scholar, 10Jänne O.A. Moilanen A.M. Poukka H. Rouleau N. Karvonen U. Kotaja N. Häkli M. Palvimo J.J. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2000; 28: 401-405Google Scholar). However, very little is known about the role of these factors, some of which are expressed in a cell-specific fashion, in the assembly or disassembly of AR transcription complexes. The potential cell type- and promoter-specific differences in the AR transcription complexes as well as characterization of the complexes during the postulated ligand-independent activation of transcription by AR (62Culig Z. Hobisch A. Cronauer M.V. Radmay C. Trapman J. Hittmair A. Bartsch G. Klocker H. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 5474-5478Google Scholar) warrant further studies. In this work, we have shown that agonist-dependent loading of holo-AR and recruitment of coactivators and pol II to PSA and KLK2 promoters in LNCaP cells are transient and cyclic. Even though the anti-androgen bicalutamide-liganded AR was able to occupy the promoter, it was incapable of recruiting pol II and coactivators. Importantly, both the cyclic nature of PSA promoter occupancy by AR and androgen-elicited induction of PSA mRNA accumulation were abolished by a proteasome inhibitor, indicating that proteasome function is a critical mechanism in AR-dependent transcriptional regulation. Remodeling of chromatin by covalent modifications of nucleosomal proteins is an important event in transcription (11Kingston R.E. Narlikar G.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2339-2352Google Scholar, 46Kadam S. Emerson B.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2002; 14: 262-268Google Scholar, 47Rice J.C. Allis C.D. Nature. 2001; 414: 258-261Google Scholar). The degree of core histone acetylation generally correlates with the transcriptional status on a given gene (11Kingston R.E. Narlikar G.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2339-2352Google Scholar, 16Chen H. Lin R.J. Xie W. Wilpitz D. Evans R.M. Cell. 1999; 98: 675-686Google Scholar, 47Rice J.C. Allis C.D. Nature. 2001; 414: 258-261Google Scholar). In this work, we show that the acetylation state of histone H3 on the PSA promoter increases rapidly in response to T treatment and AR occupancy. Assembly of the AR transcription complex resembles rapid and cyclic association of holo-ERα and a number of coactivators with the cathepsin promoterin vivo (13Shang Y. Hu X. DiRenzo J. Lazar M.A. Brown M. Cell. 2000; 103: 843-852Google Scholar). Also with the pS2 promoter, estrogen treatment results in hyperacetylation of histones H3 and H4 with concurrent recruitment of the TATA-binding protein to the promoter (48Sewack G.F. Ellis T.W. Hansen U. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1404-1415Google Scholar). Interestingly, recruitment of SRC and vitamin D receptor-interacting protein complexes to the pS2 promoter occurs at opposite phases, suggesting an exchange between these coactivator complexes (49Burakov D. Crofts L.A. Chang C.-P.B. Freedman L.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 14359-14362Google Scholar). Ordered recruitment of histone acetyltransferases and the thyroid hormone-associated protein complexes has also been shown recently (50Sharma D. Fondell J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7934-7939Google Scholar) to take place in the thyroid hormone-responsive dio1 promoter, and histone acetylation is a prerequisite for thyroid hormone-associated protein/mediator recruitment. Moreover, binding of p65/RelA to the IκBα promoter in response to lipopolysaccharide stimulus is also a fast and transient process with rapid changes in histone acetylation (51Saccani S. Pantano S. Natoli G. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 193: 1351-1359Google Scholar). These results suggest that the cyclic dynamics of transcription complex assembly is a common feature of promoters activated by inducible transcription factors. Regular cycling of nuclear receptor transcription complexes may represent a mechanism that enables continuous monitoring of the environment (13Shang Y. Hu X. DiRenzo J. Lazar M.A. Brown M. Cell. 2000; 103: 843-852Google Scholar). What could be the biochemical mechanism underlying the release of the transcription complexes from the promoters? An inhibitor of cdk7 and cdk9, protein kinases responsible for phosphorylation of the C-terminal domain of pol II large subunit, stabilized ERα transcription complexes, suggesting that the release of these complexes requires phosphorylation of pol II (13Shang Y. Hu X. DiRenzo J. Lazar M.A. Brown M. Cell. 2000; 103: 843-852Google Scholar). The cyclicity may also be regulated via phosphorylation of steroid receptors and through modifications of coactivators. Notably, cdk7 kinase is also able to phosphorylate nuclear receptors, including ERα (52Chen D. Riedl T. Washbrook E. Pace P.E. Coombes R.C. Egly J.M. Ali S. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 127-137Google Scholar, 53Keriel A. Stary A. Sarasin A. Rochette-Egly C. Egly J.M. Cell. 2002; 109: 125-135Google Scholar). Phosphorylation often marks proteins for ubiquitination and subsequent degradation (54Weissman A.M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 169-178Google Scholar). Our data implicating the proteasome in AR-dependent transcription and release of AR from the PSA promoter is in line with the findings that the proteasome regulatory particle and proteasome-mediated degradation of transcriptional activators are coupled to the transcription process (40Conaway R.C. Brower C.S. Conaway J.W. Science. 2002; 296: 1254-1258Google Scholar, 41Molinari E. Gilman M. Natesan S. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6439-6447Google Scholar, 42Salghetti S.E. Caudy A.A. Chenoweth J.G.

https://openalex.org/W2139551405,"Recently, it has been shown that the exogenous addition of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) increases endothelial nitric oxide (NO⋅) production. The current study is designed to determine whether endogenous levels of H2O2 are ever sufficient to stimulate NO⋅ production in intact endothelial cells. NO⋅ production was detected by a NO⋅-specific microelectrode or by an electron spin resonance spectroscopy using Fe2+-(DETC)2 as a NO⋅-specific spin trap. The addition of H2O2 to bovine aortic endothelial cells caused a potent and dose-dependent increase in NO⋅ release. Incubation with angiotensin II (10−7 mol) elevated intracellular H2O2 levels, which were attenuated with PEG-catalase. Angiotensin II increased NO⋅ production by 2-fold, and this was prevented by Losartan and by PEG-catalase, suggesting a critical role of AT1 receptor and H2O2 in this response. In contrast, NO⋅ production evoked by either bradykinin or calcium ionophore A23187 was unaffected by PEG-catalase. As in bovine aortic endothelial cells, angiotensin II doubled NO⋅ production in aortic endothelial cells from C57BL/6 mice but had no effect on NO⋅ production in endothelial cells from p47phox−/− mice. In contrast, A23187stimulated NO⋅ production to a similar extent in endothelial cells from wild-type and p47phox−/− mice. In summary, the present study provides direct evidence that endogenous H2O2, derived from the NAD(P)H oxidase, mediates endothelial NO⋅ production in response to angiotensin II. Under disease conditions associated with elevated levels of angiotensin II, this response may represent a compensatory mechanism. Because angiotensin II also stimulates O2.¯ production from the NAD(P)H oxidase, the H2O2 stimulation of NO⋅ may facilitate peroxynitrite formation in response to this octapeptide.

Growing evidence indicates that angiotensin II activates the vascular NADPH oxidase, leading to increased production of superoxide anion ( O2.¯) 1The abbreviations used are: O2.¯, superoxide anion; NO⋅, endothelial nitric oxide; eNOS, endothelial nitric oxide synthase; MAECs, mouse aortic endothelial cells, MEM, minimum Eagle's medium; PEG, polyethylene glycol; SOD, superoxide dismutase; DCFH-DA, 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein diacetate; DETC, diethyl dithiocarbamate; l-NAME, l-nitroarginine methyl ester; ESR, electron spin resonance. 1The abbreviations used are: O2.¯, superoxide anion; NO⋅, endothelial nitric oxide; eNOS, endothelial nitric oxide synthase; MAECs, mouse aortic endothelial cells, MEM, minimum Eagle's medium; PEG, polyethylene glycol; SOD, superoxide dismutase; DCFH-DA, 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein diacetate; DETC, diethyl dithiocarbamate; l-NAME, l-nitroarginine methyl ester; ESR, electron spin resonance.

This results in the loss of many of the beneficial effects of NO⋅, including vasodilatation (5Cai H. Harrison D.G. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: 840-844Google Scholar). We and others have shown that angiotensin II contributes to endothelial dysfunction in vivo by this mechanism (6Rajagopalan S. Kurz S. Munzel T. Tarpey M. Freeman B.A. Griendling K.K. Harrison D.G. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 1916-1923Google Scholar, 7Laursen J.B. Rajagopalan S. Galis Z. Tarpey M. Freeman B.A. Harrison D.G. Circulation. 1997; 95: 588-593Google Scholar, 8Warnholtz A. Nickenig G.

On the other hand, O2.¯ serves as a source of other reactive oxygen species, which may contribute to vascular disease and, in some cases, may have specific signaling properties (9Griendling K.K. Ushio-Fukai M. Regul. Pept. 2000; 91: 21-27Google Scholar). In particular, the dismutation product of O2.¯, H2O2, may mediate compensatory responses. For example, we have shown that H2O2 potently induces endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) gene expression in endothelial cells via a Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II/Janus kinase 2-dependent pathway (10Drummond G.R. Cai H. Davis M.E. Ramasamy S. Harrison D.G. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: 347-354Google Scholar, 11Cai H. Davis M.E. Drummond G.R. Harrison D.G. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2001; 21: 1571-1576Google Scholar).Recently, is has been shown that exogenous H2O2acutely activates eNOS to cause endothelial NO⋅ release (12Thomas S.R. Chen K. Keaney Jr., J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6017-6024Google Scholar). These responses were only observed when micromolar concentrations of H2O2 were employed. It remains unclear, therefore, whether endogenous levels of H2O2are ever sufficiently high to stimulate NO⋅ production in response to either physiological or pathophysiological stimuli. One such pathophysiological stimulus, angiotensin II, is known to activate the NADPH oxidase and could lead to H2O2formation. Previous studies have suggested that angiotensin II increases NO⋅ production, although the precise signaling mechanisms have not been defined (13Saito S. Hirata Y. Emori T. Imai T. Marumo F. Hypertens. Res. 1996; 19: 201-206Google Scholar, 14Pueyo M.E. Arnal J.F. Rami J. Michel J.B. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: C214-C220Google Scholar, 15Thorup C. Kornfeld M. Goligorsky M.S. Moore L.C. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1999; 10: S220-S224Google Scholar). The present study is designed to examine whether endogenous accumulation of H2O2 in response to angiotensin II and other stimuli is sufficient to stimulate endothelial NO⋅production.DISCUSSIONPrevious studies have indicated that H2O2is a potent stimulus for NO⋅ production by endothelial cells and that this seems to involve activation of eNOS by phosphorylation of serine 1179 and dephosphorylation of threonine 495 (12Thomas S.R. Chen K. Keaney Jr., J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6017-6024Google Scholar). In the present studies, we addressed the question of whether or not H2O2 produced endogenously could activate endothelial cell NO⋅ production. To address this question, we examined responses to angiotensin II, which has previously been shown to increase both O2.¯ and peroxynitrite in endothelial cells (14Pueyo M.E. Arnal J.F. Rami J. Michel J.B. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: C214-C220Google Scholar). We found that angiotensin II stimulates NO⋅ production from endothelial cells as detected by two distinct methodologies for detection of the NO⋅ radical and that H2O2 seems to function as an intracellular second messenger in this response. The source of H2O2 is identified to be the endothelial NADPH oxidase, based on experiments with endothelial cells from p47phox−/− mice. This H2O2-dependent eNOS signaling pathway seemed to be specific for angiotensin II, because it was not observed for other agonists, including bradykinin and A23187.As shown previously, the application of exogenous H2O2 to endothelial cells caused an acute and potent increase in endothelial NO⋅ production. This seemed to be a direct effect of H2O2, and it was not mediated by Fenton products of H2O2, because hydroxyl radical chelators had no effect on this response. Data from NO⋅-specific microelectrode and ESR with NO⋅-specific spin trap Fe2+(FETC)2 strongly support the belief that angiotensin II increases endothelial NO⋅ production. Of note, this response was prevented by Losartan, suggesting that it was mediated by the AT1 receptor. It has been reported that angiotensin IV, a cleavage product of angiotensin II, can stimulate endothelium-dependent vasodilatation and release NO⋅in some endothelial cells (25Seyedi N. Xu X. Nasjletti A. Hintze T.H. Hypertension. 1995; 26: 164-170Google Scholar, 26Kramar E.A. Krishnan R. Harding J.W. Wright J.W. Regul. Pept. 1998; 74: 185-192Google Scholar, 27Patel J.M. Martens J.R.

Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1999; 10: 481-491Google Scholar). In addition, activation of the AT2 receptor by angiotensin II has been associated with the activation of kininogen, bradykinin production, and, ultimately, NO⋅ release via activation of the bradykinin receptor (29Gohlke P. Pees C. Unger T. Hypertension. 1998; 31: 349-355Google Scholar, 30Siragy H.M. Inagami T. Ichiki T. Carey R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6506-6510Google Scholar, 31Tsutsumi Y.

The fact that Losartan inhibited the response to angiotensin II in the current studies does not discount these other mechanisms, as the AT2 and the angiotensin IV receptor may not be expressed at high levels in bovine aortic endothelial cells but provides yet another mechanism whereby angiotensin II can stimulate NO⋅ production. Prima facie, the ability of angiotensin II to stimulate NO⋅release seems at odds with the notion that angiotensin II causes endothelial dysfunction by increasing reactive oxygen species production and thereby inactivating NO⋅. In fact, it is likely, based on previous studies, that angiotensin II is simultaneously stimulating both O2.¯ and NO⋅, facilitating peroxynitrite production.Our current findings are in keeping with the concept that H2O2 can serve as an intracellular signaling molecule. Early work demonstrated that H2O2 can both activate tyrosine kinases and inhibit tyrosine phosphatases (33Hayes G.R. Lockwood D.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 8115-8119Google Scholar,34Sullivan S.G. Chiu D.T. Errasfa M. Wang J.M. Qi J.S. Stern A. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1994; 16: 399-403Google Scholar).

Chem. 1995; 270: 21195-21198Google Scholar). It has been shown that catalase, after reacting with H2O2, can activate guanylate cyclase. This seems to occur via a unique mechanism that is quite different from the heme-mediated activation of guanylate cyclase by nitric oxide (44Mohazzab H.K. Agarwal R. Wolin M.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: H235-H241Google Scholar). Recent data suggest that H2O2 can activate phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, leading to phosphorylation of eNOS at serine 1179, which may contribute to the activation of the enzyme in response to angiotensin II.In the present studies, we found that the NADPH oxidase was essential for angiotensin II stimulation of endothelial cell NO⋅production. Cells from p47phox−/− mice demonstrated no response to angiotensin II, although they produce NO⋅ normally when stimulated with the calcium ionophoreA23187. This finding is consistent with the concept that angiotensin II is a potent stimulus for NAD(P)H oxidase activation (1Griendling K.K. Minieri C.A. Ollerenshaw J.D. Alexander R.W. Circ. Res. 1994; 74: 1141-1148Google Scholar, 2Bayraktutan U. Draper N. Lang D. Shah A.M. Cardiovasc. Res. 1998; 38: 256-262Google Scholar, 3Zhang H. Schmeisser A. Garlichs C.D. Plotze K. Damme U. Mugge A.

Whereas most studies have focused on the O2.¯ production by this oxidase, either spontaneous or superoxide dismutase-mediated dismutation of O2.¯ could lead to increased levels of intracellular H2O2. Furthermore, recent preliminary studies from our laboratory have suggested that membranes of vascular smooth muscle and endothelial cells produce about 4-fold more H2O2 than O2.¯ when stimulated by the addition of NAD(P)H. Although the Fe2+ center of this enzyme would be expected to mediate only a one-electron reduction of oxygen and thus produce only O2.¯, it may be that the release of the O2.¯ is electrostatically hindered so that H2O2, after spontaneous dismutation, is favored. Nevertheless, our data would indicate that this enzyme clearly releases sufficient H2O2 to modulate eNOS activation upon stimulation of cells with angiotensin IIIn summary, the present study provides direct evidence that endogenous H2O2, derived from the NAD(P)H oxidase, mediates NO⋅ production in response to angiotensin II in endothelial cells. In disease conditions associated with elevated angiotensin II levels, this response may represent a compensatory mechanism. Because angiotensin II also stimulates O2.¯ production from the NAD(P)H oxidase, the H2O2stimulation of NO⋅ may facilitate peroxynitrite formation in response to this octapeptide. Growing evidence indicates that angiotensin II activates the vascular NADPH oxidase, leading to increased production of superoxide anion ( O2.¯) 1The abbreviations used are: O2.¯, superoxide anion; NO⋅, endothelial nitric oxide; eNOS, endothelial nitric oxide synthase; MAECs, mouse aortic endothelial cells, MEM, minimum Eagle's medium; PEG, polyethylene glycol; SOD, superoxide dismutase; DCFH-DA, 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein diacetate; DETC, diethyl dithiocarbamate; l-NAME, l-nitroarginine methyl ester; ESR, electron spin resonance. 1The abbreviations used are: O2.¯, superoxide anion; NO⋅, endothelial nitric oxide; eNOS, endothelial nitric oxide synthase; MAECs, mouse aortic endothelial cells, MEM, minimum Eagle's medium; PEG, polyethylene glycol; SOD, superoxide dismutase; DCFH-DA, 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein diacetate; DETC, diethyl dithiocarbamate; l-NAME, l-nitroarginine methyl ester; ESR, electron spin resonance.

Donaldson F. Lewis M.J. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: 463-469Google Scholar). Superoxide, in turn, reacts with the nitric oxide radical (NO⋅) in a diffusion-limited fashion to form peroxynitrite. This results in the loss of many of the beneficial effects of NO⋅, including vasodilatation (5Cai H. Harrison D.G. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: 840-844Google Scholar). We and others have shown that angiotensin II contributes to endothelial dysfunction in vivo by this mechanism (6Rajagopalan S. Kurz S. Munzel T. Tarpey M. Freeman B.A. Griendling K.K. Harrison D.G. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 1916-1923Google Scholar, 7Laursen J.B. Rajagopalan S. Galis Z. Tarpey M. Freeman B.A. Harrison D.G. Circulation. 1997; 95: 588-593Google Scholar, 8Warnholtz A. Nickenig G.

On the other hand, O2.¯ serves as a source of other reactive oxygen species, which may contribute to vascular disease and, in some cases, may have specific signaling properties (9Griendling K.K. Ushio-Fukai M. Regul. Pept. 2000; 91: 21-27Google Scholar). In particular, the dismutation product of O2.¯, H2O2, may mediate compensatory responses. For example, we have shown that H2O2 potently induces endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) gene expression in endothelial cells via a Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II/Janus kinase 2-dependent pathway (10Drummond G.R. Cai H. Davis M.E. Ramasamy S. Harrison D.G. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: 347-354Google Scholar, 11Cai H. Davis M.E. Drummond G.R. Harrison D.G. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2001; 21: 1571-1576Google Scholar). Recently, is has been shown that exogenous H2O2acutely activates eNOS to cause endothelial NO⋅ release (12Thomas S.R. Chen K. Keaney Jr., J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6017-6024Google Scholar). These responses were only observed when micromolar concentrations of H2O2 were employed. It remains unclear, therefore, whether endogenous levels of H2O2are ever sufficiently high to stimulate NO⋅ production in response to either physiological or pathophysiological stimuli. One such pathophysiological stimulus, angiotensin II, is known to activate the NADPH oxidase and could lead to H2O2formation. Previous studies have suggested that angiotensin II increases NO⋅ production, although the precise signaling mechanisms have not been defined (13Saito S. Hirata Y. Emori T. Imai T. Marumo F. Hypertens. Res. 1996; 19: 201-206Google Scholar, 14Pueyo M.E. Arnal J.F. Rami J. Michel J.B. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: C214-C220Google Scholar, 15Thorup C. Kornfeld M. Goligorsky M.S. Moore L.C. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1999; 10: S220-S224Google Scholar). The present study is designed to examine whether endogenous accumulation of H2O2 in response to angiotensin II and other stimuli is sufficient to stimulate endothelial NO⋅production. DISCUSSIONPrevious studies have indicated that H2O2is a potent stimulus for NO⋅ production by endothelial cells and that this seems to involve activation of eNOS by phosphorylation of serine 1179 and dephosphorylation of threonine 495 (12Thomas S.R. Chen K. Keaney Jr., J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6017-6024Google Scholar). In the present studies, we addressed the question of whether or not H2O2 produced endogenously could activate endothelial cell NO⋅ production. To address this question, we examined responses to angiotensin II, which has previously been shown to increase both O2.¯ and peroxynitrite in endothelial cells (14Pueyo M.E. Arnal J.F. Rami J. Michel J.B. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: C214-C220Google Scholar). We found that angiotensin II stimulates NO⋅ production from endothelial cells as detected by two distinct methodologies for detection of the NO⋅ radical and that H2O2 seems to function as an intracellular second messenger in this response. The source of H2O2 is identified to be the endothelial NADPH oxidase, based on experiments with endothelial cells from p47phox−/− mice. This H2O2-dependent eNOS signaling pathway seemed to be specific for angiotensin II, because it was not observed for other agonists, including bradykinin and A23187.As shown previously, the application of exogenous H2O2 to endothelial cells caused an acute and potent increase in endothelial NO⋅ production. This seemed to be a direct effect of H2O2, and it was not mediated by Fenton products of H2O2, because hydroxyl radical chelators had no effect on this response. Data from NO⋅-specific microelectrode and ESR with NO⋅-specific spin trap Fe2+(FETC)2 strongly support the belief that angiotensin II increases endothelial NO⋅ production. Of note, this response was prevented by Losartan, suggesting that it was mediated by the AT1 receptor. It has been reported that angiotensin IV, a cleavage product of angiotensin II, can stimulate endothelium-dependent vasodilatation and release NO⋅in some endothelial cells (25Seyedi N. Xu X. Nasjletti A. Hintze T.H. Hypertension. 1995; 26: 164-170Google Scholar, 26Kramar E.A. Krishnan R. Harding J.W. Wright J.W. Regul. Pept. 1998; 74: 185-192Google Scholar, 27Patel J.M. Martens J.R.

Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1999; 10: 481-491Google Scholar). In addition, activation of the AT2 receptor by angiotensin II has been associated with the activation of kininogen, bradykinin production, and, ultimately, NO⋅ release via activation of the bradykinin receptor (29Gohlke P. Pees C. Unger T. Hypertension. 1998; 31: 349-355Google Scholar, 30Siragy H.M. Inagami T. Ichiki T. Carey R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6506-6510Google Scholar, 31Tsutsumi Y.

The fact that Losartan inhibited the response to angiotensin II in the current studies does not discount these other mechanisms, as the AT2 and the angiotensin IV receptor may not be expressed at high levels in bovine aortic endothelial cells but provides yet another mechanism whereby angiotensin II can stimulate NO⋅ production. Prima facie, the ability of angiotensin II to stimulate NO⋅release seems at odds with the notion that angiotensin II causes endothelial dysfunction by increasing reactive oxygen species production and thereby inactivating NO⋅. In fact, it is likely, based on previous studies, that angiotensin II is simultaneously stimulating both O2.¯ and NO⋅, facilitating peroxynitrite production.Our current findings are in keeping with the concept that H2O2 can serve as an intracellular signaling molecule. Early work demonstrated that H2O2 can both activate tyrosine kinases and inhibit tyrosine phosphatases (33Hayes G.R. Lockwood D.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Whereas most studies have focused on the O2.¯ production by this oxidase, either spontaneous or superoxide dismutase-mediated dismutation of O2.¯ could lead to increased levels of intracellular H2O2. Furthermore, recent preliminary studies from our laboratory have suggested that membranes of vascular smooth muscle and endothelial cells produce about 4-fold more H2O2 than O2.¯ when stimulated by the addition of NAD(P)H. Although the Fe2+ center of this enzyme would be expected to mediate only a one-electron reduction of oxygen and thus produce only O2.¯, it may be that the release of the O2.¯ is electrostatically hindered so that H2O2, after spontaneous dismutation, is favored. Nevertheless, our data would indicate that this enzyme clearly releases sufficient H2O2 to modulate eNOS activation upon stimulation of cells with angiotensin II In summary, the present study provides direct evidence that endogenous H2O2, derived from the NAD(P)H oxidase, mediates NO⋅ production in response to angiotensin II in endothelial cells. In disease conditions associated with elevated angiotensin II levels, this response may represent a compensatory mechanism. Because angiotensin II also stimulates O2.¯ production from the NAD(P)H oxidase, the H2O2stimulation of NO⋅ may facilitate peroxynitrite formation in response to this octapeptide."

In Drosophila, the TEF-1 homolog Scalloped interacts with the cofactor Vestigial to drive differentiation of the wing and indirect flight muscles. Here, we identify three mammalian vestigial-like genes,Vgl-1, Vgl-2, and Vgl-3, that share homology in a TEF-1 interaction domain. Vgl-1 andVgl-3 transcripts are enriched in the placenta, whereasVgl-2 is expressed in the differentiating somites and branchial arches during embryogenesis and is skeletal muscle-specific in the adult. During muscle differentiation, Vgl-2 mRNA levels increase and Vgl-2 protein translocates from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. In situ hybridization revealed co-expression of Vgl-2 with myogenin in the differentiating muscle of embryonic myotomes but not in newly formed somites prior to muscle differentiation. Like Vgl-1, Vgl-2 interacts with TEF-1. In addition, we show that Vgl-2 interacts with MEF2 in a mammalian two-hybrid assay and that Vgl-2 selectively binds to MEF2 in vitro. Co-expression of Vgl-2 with MEF2 markedly co-activates an MEF2-dependent promoter through its MEF2 element. Overexpression of Vgl-2 in MyoD-transfected 10T½ cells markedly increased myosin heavy chain expression, a marker of terminal muscle differentiation. These results identify Vgl-2 as an important new component of the myogenic program.

These results identify Vgl-2 as an important new component of the myogenic program. Commitment of pluripotent cells to the skeletal muscle lineage involves multiple inductive signals and the hierarchical activation of several transcription factors (1Cossu G. Borello U. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6867-6872Google Scholar). Differentiation of skeletal muscle cells is coupled to withdrawal from the cell cycle and is accompanied by transcriptional activation of muscle-specific genes. The MyoD family of basic-helix-loop-helix transcription factors, including MyoD, Myf5, myogenin, and MRF4, plays a central role in activating the muscle differentiation program (2Molkentin J.D. Olson E.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9366-9373Google Scholar). Activation of muscle gene expression by the MyoD family of factors is dependent on their association with members of the MEF2 family of MADS box transcription factors (3Molkentin J.D. Black B.L. Martin J.F. Olson E.N. Cell. 1995; 83: 1125-1136Google Scholar). Together, MyoD and MEF2 account for a large part of muscle-specific gene activation. In addition, many muscle genes contain muscle-specific cytidine-adenosine-thymidine cis-elements (5′-CATDSH-3′) that are also required for muscle-specific expression (4Mar J.H. Ordahl C.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 6404-6408Google Scholar, 5Mar J.H. Ordahl C.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 4271-4283Google Scholar). The proteins that bind to these elements belong to the transcription enhancer factor-1 (TEF-1) 1The abbreviations used are: TEF-1, transcription enhancer factor-1; EST, expressed sequence tag; Vgl-1, Vestigial-like 1; TDU, human Vgl-1; CMV, cytomegalovirus; MLC2v, chicken myosin light chain 2v; e, embryonic day; SKA, skeletal muscle α-actin; HDAC, histone deacetylase; SRF, serum response factor; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyl transferase. family of transcription factors (6Farrance I.K. Mar J.H. Ordahl C.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17234-17240Google Scholar). TEF-1 factors regulate tissue-specific gene expression in muscle and placenta (7Larkin S.B. Farrance I.K.G. Ordahl C.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3742-3755Google Scholar, 8Jiang S.-W. Eberhardt N.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10384-10392Google Scholar) and are considered to be general transcription factors in other tissues (for review see Ref. 9Butler A.J. Ordahl C.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 296-306Google Scholar). TEF-1 factors are not tissue-restricted in their expression, suggesting that additional cofactors are required to confer tissue-specific function. Proteins that interact with TEF-1 include the basic-helix-loop-helix leucine zipper protein Max (10Gupta M.P. Amin C.S. Gupta M. Hay N. Zak R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3924-3936Google Scholar), the nuclear protein poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase (9Butler A.J. Ordahl C.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 296-306Google Scholar), the steroid receptor co-activator proteins (11Belandia B. Parker M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30801-30805Google Scholar), the Src/Yes-associated protein YAP65 (12Vassilev A. Kaneko K.J. Shu H. Zhao Y. DePamphilis M.L. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1229-1241Google Scholar), and a serum response factor (13Gupta M. Kogut P. Davis F.J. Belaguli N.S. Schwartz R.J. Gupta M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10413-10422Google Scholar). Some of these cofactors are known to participate in muscle differentiation. For example, the steroid receptor co-activator GRIP-1 is necessary for MEF2C-dependent gene expression and muscle differentiation (14Chen S.L. Dowhan D.H. Hosking B.M. Muscat G.E. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1209-1228Crossref Google Scholar). In addition, poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase interaction with TEF-1 contributes to the muscle-specific activity of a muscle-specific cytidine-adenosine-thymidine element (9Butler A.J. Ordahl C.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 296-306Google Scholar). However, no TEF-1 cofactor has been identified that has a tissue-restricted pattern of expression. In Drosophila, the TEF-1 homolog Scalloped is required for the development of chemosensory organs on the wing blade (15Campbell S. Inamdar M. Rodrigues V. Raghavan V. Palazzolo M. Chovnick A. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 367-379Google Scholar). The finding that TEF-1 could functionally substitute for Scalloped duringDrosophila development (16Deshpande N. Chopra A. Rangarajan A. Shashidhara L.S. Rodrigues V. Krishna S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10664-10668Google Scholar) suggested that evolutionarily conserved cofactors might be present in both Drosophila and vertebrates. The nuclear protein Vestigial is a necessary cofactor of Scalloped in Drosophila (17Halder G. Polaczyk P. Kraus M.E. Hudson A. Kim J. Laughon A. Carroll S. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3900-3909Google Scholar, 18Paumard-Rigal S. Zider A. Vaudin P. Silber J. Dev. Genes Evol. 1998; 208: 440-446Google Scholar, 19Simmonds A.J. Liu X. Soanes K.H. Krause H.M. Irvine K.D. Bell J.B. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3815-3820Google Scholar). Moreover,Drosophila Vestigial was shown to physically interact with both Scalloped and human TEF-1 (19Simmonds A.J. Liu X. Soanes K.H. Krause H.M. Irvine K.D. Bell J.B. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3815-3820Google Scholar), suggesting the existence of vertebrate homologs of Vestigial. The Drosophila vestigialgene plays a central role in the development and patterning of the wing: loss of Vestigial results in a failure of wing development, and ectopic expression of Vestigial in tissues of the eyes, legs, and antennae leads to the development of ectopic wings (20Kim J. Sebring A. Esch J.J. Kraus M.E. Vorwerk K. Magee J. Carroll S.B. Nature. 1996; 382: 133-138Google Scholar). Binding of the Vestigial cofactor switches the DNA-target selectivity of the Scalloped protein (21Halder G. Carroll S.B. Development. 2001; 128: 3295-3305Crossref Google Scholar) and activates wing-specific genes. vestigialexpression is regulated by inputs from three signaling pathways: Wingless, Decapentaplegic, and Notch/Suppressor of Hairless and by its own expression in a positive feedback loop (22Klein T. Arias A.M. Development. 1999; 126: 913-925Google Scholar). These signals are also known to play an important role in skeletal muscle differentiation in vertebrates. Recently, vestigial was shown to specify the differentiation of the indirect flight muscles, providing direct evidence that Vestigial plays a role in muscle differentiation (23Sudarsan V. Anant S. Guptan P. VijayRaghavan K. Skaer H. Dev. Cell. 2001; 1: 829-839Google Scholar). However, the mechanism of Vestigial function remains poorly understood. A human protein related to Vestigial was identified from an expressed sequence tag (EST) isolated from a fetal heart cDNA library and named tondu (TDU) (24Vaudin P. Delanoue R. Davidson I. Silber J. Zider A. Development. 1999; 126: 4807-4816Google Scholar). Northern blot analysis of fetal tissues also revealed tondu mRNA in fetal kidney and lung, however, expression was not examined in adult tissues. tondu was shown to physically and functionally interact with TEF-1. We also identified this cDNA in a search of the GenBankTM data base for genes related toDrosophila vestigial, but gave it the name Vestigial-like 1 (Vgl-1), based on its homology to the previously describedDrosophila vestigial. In addition, we found two human genomic sequences that encode different mRNAs, which we call Vgl-2 and Vgl-3. Here, we show that Vgl-2 is a muscle-specific cofactor of TEF-1 in adult tissues, that Vgl-2 is up-regulated and translocates from the cytoplasm to the nucleus upon muscle differentiation, that Vgl-2 interacts with MEF2 and co-activates an MEF2-dependent muscle-specific promoter. Moreover, co-expression of Vgl-2 with MyoD significantly increases the expression of myosin heavy chain, a marker of terminally differentiated muscle. Taken together, our results identify Vgl-2 as an important new transcriptional cofactor of the muscle-specific program. The sequence ofDrosophila vestigial was used in a BLAST search of GenBankTM to identify vestigial-like genes. Three genomic clones, one on Xq26.1–27.2, one on 6q21, and a third on chromosome 3, contained a sequence motif related to the TEF-1 interaction domain of Vestigial. ESTs related to these genomic clones were identified in the human EST data base. EST 347406, initially isolated from a human fetal heart cDNA library, corresponded to the Vgl-1 cDNA and was obtained from Genome Systems, Inc. (St. Louis, MO). The sequence of this EST has been reported by others (24Vaudin P. Delanoue R. Davidson I. Silber J. Zider A. Development. 1999; 126: 4807-4816Google Scholar). For Vgl-2, an antisense oligonucleotide corresponding to the sequence homologous to the TEF-1 interaction domain (GenBankTM accession #798880, nucleotides 88263–88320), 5′-GGCCCTGCTGAAATGTTCATCCACCACGGAGCTGATGTCCCCCTGGAAATAAGTGAAG-3′, was used to probe a human multiple-tissue Northern blot.Vgl-2 expression was restricted to adult human skeletal muscle. To isolate the Vgl-2 cDNA, human skeletal muscle cDNA was obtained (a gift from Prof. Eric Hoffman) and used for reverse transcription-PCR. The following oligonucleotides were used, 5′-CCTGAGCTCCGGGGAAGGAGAG-3′ and 5′-CAGCTTTGCCCACGCACAGACC-3′, corresponding to sequences in the 5′-untranslated region predicted from the genomic sequence (GenBankTM accession #798880, nucleotides 90979–90958 and 83166–83187) and to sequence in the 3′-untranslated region (GenBankTM accession #798880, nucleotides 83166–83187) in an EST (1089328) that maps to the same genomic locus and that produced the same profile when used to screen the Northern blot. An antisense oligonucleotide specific for theVgl-3 gene on human chromosome 3 (GenBankTMaccession #AC012221, nucleotides 113762–113718, 5′-GCTCTTGAGAAGTGTTCATCCACTACTGACCCAATGTCTCCCTGG-3′) corresponds to the TEF-1 interaction domain. The mouse Vgl-2 cDNA was isolated from an adult diaphragm cDNA library (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). All cDNAs were sequenced on both strands. A human multiple-tissue Northern blot and a dot blot containing RNA from 50 human tissues (Clontech Laboratories, Palo Alto, CA) were sequentially probed with 32P-end-labeled antisense oligonucleotides corresponding to the sequence encoding the TEF-1 interaction domain in Vgl-2 and Vgl-3. All oligonucleotides were synthesized and high pressure liquid chromatography-purified by Operon Technologies (Alameda, CA). Theses blots were also probed with a32P-labeled random primed full-length Vgl-1cDNA. RNA was also prepared from mouse C2C12 cells and transfected 10T½ cells cultured in 10% fetal bovine serum or induced to differentiate by changing the medium to 2% horse serum. This RNA was used for Northern blot analysis. The mouse Vgl-2 cDNA was used to screen the C2C12 and 10T½ Northern blots. Blots were visualized on a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences) or by autoradiography on x-ray film. Parasagittal sections of mouse embryos were purchased from Calbiochem-Novabiochem (San Diego, CA). Swiss Webster mouse embryos for whole mount in situhybridization were dissected from timed pregnancies with embryonic day (e) 0.5 being noon on the day of the vaginal plug. Sense and antisense digoxigenin-labeled riboprobes for mouse Vgl-2 andmyogenin (gift of Drs. Bill Klein and Anita Myer) were synthesized according to a supplier protocol (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Indianapolis, IN). Whole mount in situhybridization was performed according to D. Wilkinson (25Wilkinson D.G. Wilkinson D.G. In Situ Hybridization: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1992: 75-83Google Scholar). Hybridization and post-hybridization washes were carried out at 60 °C for sections and at 63–65 °C for whole mounts. The CMV enhancer-driven human TEF-1 plasmid pXJ40-TEF-1A containing human TEF-1 with a synthetic initiator codon and the parental plasmid pXJ40 have been described previously (26Xiao J.H. Davidson I. Matthes H. Garnier J.M. Chambon P. Cell. 1991; 65: 551-568Google Scholar). The pXJ40-RTEF-1 expression plasmid has also been described previously, where we designated the leucine codon 7 codons 5′ to the isoleucine codon in RTEF-1, which is replaced by methionine in pXJ40-TEF-1A, as the initiator of human RTEF-1 (27Stewart A.F.R. Suzow J. Kubota T. Ueyama T. Chen H.H. Circ. Res. 1998; 83: 43-49Google Scholar). The pACT-MyoD vector from the Promega CheckMateTM mammalian Two-Hybrid System was digested with BamHI, and the 1.7-kb MyoD fragment was ligated into the pXJ40 expression vector. The mouse −113 bp SKA/CAT reporter construct was a gift of Professor Paul Simpson (28Karns L.R. Kariya K. Simpson P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 410-417Google Scholar). The mouse −113-bp SKA promoter fragment was subcloned into the pGL2 basic luciferase vector. The −397-bp fragment of the chicken skeletal α-actin promoter was a gift of Professor Mahesh Gupta (13Gupta M. Kogut P. Davis F.J. Belaguli N.S. Schwartz R.J. Gupta M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10413-10422Google Scholar). A −250-bp fragment of the chicken myosin light chain 2v (MLC2v) promoter was generated by PCR from published sequences (29Zhou M.D. Goswami S.K. Martin M.E. Siddiqui M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1222-1231Google Scholar) and subcloned into the pGL2 basic luciferase vector as reported previously (30Maeda T. Gupta M.P. Stewart A.F.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 294: 791-797Google Scholar). The MEF2 site in the MLC2v promoter was mutated to a non-functional site using the QuikChangeTM site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and the following oligonucleotide primers: 5′-CATGGGGTTACCTTTAGCCTGGAATGGGGTG-3′ and 5′-CACCCCATTCCAGGCTAAAGGTAACCCCATG-3′ that contain two mutated sites (underlined) that prevent MEF2 binding, as shown previously (30Maeda T. Gupta M.P. Stewart A.F.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 294: 791-797Google Scholar). The MatchmakerTM mammalian two-hybrid system (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) was used initially to test for interaction between TEF-1 and Vgl factors, using the pG5CAT reporter plasmid. We subsequently used the pG5luc luciferase reporter plasmid from the CheckMateTM mammalian two-hybrid kit (Promega, Madison, WI). We first tested for TEF-1/Vgl interactions by making fusion constructs between the pM vector (containing the coding sequence for the yeast GAL4 DNA binding domain and a multiple cloning site) and Vgl factors tested with the pVP16 vector (encoding the activation domain of the herpes simplex virus VP16 protein) fused to the activation domain of TEF-1 or RTEF-1. The pM-Vgl-1 vector was constructed by linearizing the pM vector withBamHI, filling-in with Klenow, digesting withPstI, and ligating in-frame to the filled-inEcoRI/PstI fragment of Vgl-1. The pM-Vgl-2 vector was constructed by linearizing the pM vector with EcoRI, filling-in with Klenow, digesting with HindIII and ligating in-frame to the filled-in BspHI/HindIII fragment of Vgl-2. The pVP16-TEF-(80–426) vector was made by linearizing the pVP16 vector with EcoRI, filling in with Klenow, digesting with XbaI, and ligating in-frame to the filled-inBspEI/XbaI fragment of a PCR-generated mutant of TEF-1 carrying a BspEI site, reported previously (31Ueyama T. Zhu C. Valenzuela Y.M. Suzow J.G. Stewart A.F.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17476-17480Google Scholar). The pVP16-TEF-(168–426) vector was made by linearizing pVP16 withMluI, filling-in with Klenow, digesting withXbaI, and ligating in-frame to the filled-inBamHI/XbaI TEF-1 fragment from pXJ40-TEF-1A. pVP16-RTEF-(89–434) was made by linearizing the pVP16 vector withEcoRI, filling-in with Klenow, digesting withXbaI, and ligating in-frame with the filled-inBspEI/XbaI fragment of RTEF-1 from pXJ40-RTEF-1. Because the pM and pVP16 vectors have the same in-frame multiple cloning sites, the converse constructs were made by swapping the inserts from the pM vectors to the pVP16 vectors and vice versa. Thus, the EcoRI/XbaI fragments of pM-Vgl-1 and pM-Vgl-2 were ligated into pVP16 to make pVP16-Vgl-1 and pVP16-Vgl-2. Similarly, the EcoRI/XbaI fragments of pVP16-TEF-(80–426) and pVP16-TEF-(168–426) were ligated into pM to make pM-TEF-(80–426) and pM-TEF-(168–426). The pMRTEF-(89–434) vector was made by releasing an EcoRI fragment from pVP16-RTEF-(89–434) and ligating to the EcoRI-linearized pM plasmid. In addition, pM-RTEF-(214–434) was made by linearizing pM with MluI, filling-in with Klenow, digesting with XbaI, and ligating to the filled-in NcoI/XbaI fragment of pXJ40-RTEF-1. The pM-RTEF-(234–434) vector was made by linearizing pM withXmaI, filling-in with Klenow, digesting withHindIII, and ligating to the filled-inXhoI/HindIII fragment of a PCR-generated mutant of RTEF-1 carrying an XhoI site, reported previously (31Ueyama T. Zhu C. Valenzuela Y.M. Suzow J.G. Stewart A.F.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17476-17480Google Scholar). The pM-TEF-(225–426) vector was made by linearizing pM withMluI, filling-in with Klenow, digesting withXbaI, and ligating to the filled-inXhoI/XbaI fragment of pXJ40-TEF-1A. The pM-MEF2 expression vectors were obtained as follows: pM-MEF2-(1–178) was generated by PCR amplification of a fragment containing an XmaI site (underlined) 4 codons upstream of the MEF2C initiator codon, using the oligonucleotide 5′-GAGAGAAGAAACCCGGGGACTATGGGGAG-3′ and an oligonucleotide containing the PstI site (underlined) in the MEF2C cDNA, 5′-CATACTATTCCTCTGCAGAGACG-3′. The full-length pM-MEF2 was generated by ligating a PstI/PstI fragment of MEF2C cDNA encoding amino acids 178–466 into thePstI-linearized pM-MEF2-(1–178) vector. The pM-MEF2-(178–436) vector was made by subcloning aPstI/EcoRI fragment into the pM vector. The pM-MEF2-(1–302) and pM-MEF2-(302–466) vectors were made by releasing an EcoRV/XbaI or anXmaI/EcoRV fragment from the full-length vector, respectively. The myc-tagged mouse Vgl-2 expression vector was made by subcloning in-frame a PvuII/XhoI fragment containing the full-length mouse Vgl-2 sequence from pXJ40-Vgl-2 into a pBScmyc vector linearized at SmaI/XhoI. The cmyc-Vgl-2 cDNA was then released with ClaI/XhoI and recloned into pBluescript linearized with ClaI/XhoI to obtain a useful BamHI site at the 5′end. TheBamHI/XhoI cmyc-Vgl-2 fragment was released from pBluescript and subcloned into pXJ40. Deletion of the C-terminal domain of Vgl-2 was obtained following release of anSfiI/XhoI fragment from pXJ40-cmycVgl-2, by filling-in with Klenow fragment and religation to generate ΔC-Vgl-2. All constructs were sequenced at the University of Pittsburgh core facility. Neonatal rat cardiac myocytes were isolated as described previously (32Simpson P. J. Clin. Invest. 1983; 72: 732-738Google Scholar) and cultured at low density (106 viable cells per 60-mm dish) in Hanks' minimal essential medium supplemented with 5% calf serum (HyClone, Logan, UT) and bromodeoxyuridine (100 μm) to prevent non-myocyte proliferation. Twenty-four hours after plating, the medium was replaced with serum-free minimal essential medium supplemented with human insulin (10 μg/ml, Sigma), human transferrin (10 μg/ml, Sigma), and bovine serum albumin (1 mg/ml, Sigma). The following day, cardiac myocytes were transfected using the calcium phosphate precipitation method for 2 h with serum-containing medium. A total of 20 μg of DNA was added per plate, with 5 μg of −113 SKA-CAT reporter plasmid and 100 ng of CMV-driven expression plasmid, and the mixture was adjusted to 20 μg with pBluescript plasmid. In the case of the mammalian two-hybrid assay, the pG5luc reporter was co-transfected with the pGAL4 and pVP16 plasmids in 20 μg of total DNA adjusted with pBluescript. After transfection, the plates were rinsed several times in fresh medium, maintained in serum-free medium for 2 days, and then harvested for CAT or luciferase assays. CV-1 fibroblasts, C3H 10T½ cells, or the myogenic C2C12 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. C2C12 cells were induced to differentiate by changing the medium to 2% horse serum. Cells were cultured in six-well plates and transfected with 0.7 μg of the luciferase reporter plasmids and 0.1 μg of a pXJ40-derived expression plasmid using the LipofectAMINE reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) in serum-free medium. To test for the effects of Vgl and TEF or Vgl and MEF2 factors at muscle-specific promoters, 0.7 μg of the luciferase reporter plasmids and 0.05 μg each of the pXJ40-Vgl and pXJ40-TEF or pXJ40-Vgl and pXJ40-MEF2 expression plasmids were used. For the two-hybrid assay, 0.7 μg of the pG5lux reporter plasmid was transfected with 0.1 μg of the pM expression vectors and 0.1 μg of the pVP16 vectors. Three hours after transfection, medium was replaced with serum-containing medium for 24 h. Chloramphenicol acetyl transferase (CAT) activity was assessed as described previously (27Stewart A.F.R. Suzow J. Kubota T. Ueyama T. Chen H.H. Circ. Res. 1998; 83: 43-49Google Scholar). Activities (mean ± S.E.) of the SKA and MLC2v reporters were expressed relative to the activity in the presence of the empty CMV expression vector, set at 1-fold. By independent samples ttest, mean -fold activities of the SKA promoter's response to TEF-1 and RTEF-1 and to Vgl-1 and Vgl-2 expression were considered different from control at the p < 0.05 significance level. In the mammalian two-hybrid assay, activity of the pG5CAT reporter was compared when co-transfected with empty expression vectors pM and pVP16 as a negative control (no interaction) and with the pM-P53 and pVP16-TAg vectors as a positive control. Interaction was set at 100% by the transactivation of pG5CAT by the positive control. When pG5luc was used as a reporter, luciferase activity was assessed on a luminometer following the manufacturer's instructions. In vitrobinding studies were performed using purified MBP-Vgl-2 immobilized on an amylose-Sepharose resin (New England BioLabs) and in vitro transcribed/translated MEF-2 protein. Typically, 5 μl of35S-labeled MEF2 protein was incubated in the presence of 5 μg of immobilized Vgl-2 fusion protein in 500 μl of binding buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 0.3% Igepal CA-630, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.25% bovine serum albumin) for 2 h at 4 °C with agitation and then centrifuged for 2 min at 15,000 r.p.m. at room temperature. The resin was washed three times in 500 μl of binding buffer without bovine serum albumin. The protein complexes were released from the resin after boiling in Laemmli buffer and resolved by SDS-PAGE. Labeled proteins were visualized and quantified by autoradiography on a PhosphorImager. Drosophila Vestigial was recently shown to physically interact with human TEF-1, thereby suggesting the presence of vestigial homologs in mammals (16Deshpande N. Chopra A. Rangarajan A. Shashidhara L.S. Rodrigues V. Krishna S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10664-10668Google Scholar). To identify these genes, we used the sequence of Drosophila vestigial in a BLAST search of GenBankTM. Three human genomic clones, one on Xq26.1–27.2, one on 6q21, and a third on chromosome 3, contained a sequence motif related to the TEF-1 interaction domain of Vestigial. These genes were named vestigial-like 1 (Vgl-1), Vgl-2, and Vgl-3. ESTs related to these genomic clones were identified in the human EST data base. EST 347406, initially isolated from a human fetal heart cDNA library, corresponded to the Vgl-1 cDNA. The sequence of this EST has been reported by others (24Vaudin P. Delanoue R. Davidson I. Silber J. Zider A. Development. 1999; 126: 4807-4816Google Scholar). A human Vgl-2 cDNA was amplified from human skeletal muscle cDNA by reverse transcription-PCR. The mouse Vgl-2 cDNA was isolated from an adult diaphragm cDNA library. For Vgl-3, only partial sequence was identified on human chromosome 3 that corresponds to the TEF-1 interaction domain. The sequence of human (AY056583) and mouse (AF542181) Vgl-2 cDNAs have been deposited in GenBankTM, and the corresponding amino acid sequences are shown in Fig. 1A. The human cDNA likely represents a splicing isoform that deletes most of the C terminus of Vgl-2, because the 3′-untranslated repeat of human and mouse Vgl-2 are highly similar, and sequences corresponding to the mouse C-terminal domain are present on human chromosome 6q21 (data not shown). The existence of alternatively spliced isoforms of human Vgl-2 would be consistent with the presence of multiple transcripts detected by Northern blot analysis (Fig. 1B). The highly conserved TEF-1 interaction domains of Vgl-1, Vgl-3, and DrosophilaVestigial are aligned with the same sequence of Vgl-2. Less than 10% sequence identity was observed outside the TEF-1 interaction domain between different members of the vestigial family. Northern blot analysis of RNA from adult human tissues revealed thatVgl-1 and Vgl-3 transcripts are placenta-enriched, with trace levels of Vgl-1 expression detected in the kidney and Vgl-3 in the pancreas. In contrast, Vgl-2 expression is skeletal muscle-specific in adult tissues (Fig. 1B). These results were confirmed with a dot blot containing RNAs derived from 50 human tissues and with an adult mouse multi-tissue Northern blot (data not shown). A previous report examined the expression of Vgl-1 in human fetal tissues, where it was detected in the kidney and lungs but not the brain or liver (24Vaudin P. Delanoue R. Davidson I. Silber J. Zider A. Development. 1999; 126: 4807-4816Google Scholar). Thus, if Vgl factors functionally interact with TEF-1 factors in these tissues, as suggested by their highly conserved TEF-1 interaction domains (Fig. 1A), they likely contribute to the tissue-specific functions of the TEF-1 factors. Given that TEF-1 factors are implicated in cardiac muscle gene regulation, it is interesting to note the absence of Vgl-1, Vgl-2, or Vgl-3 transcripts in the adult heart or in neonatal rat cardiac myocytes (data not shown). Because Vgl-2 expression in adult tissues was limited to skeletal muscle, we next examined its expression during muscle differentiation using the mouse cell line C2C12. The mouse cell line C2C12 remains as proliferative and undifferentiated myoblasts when cultured in high serum but differentiates into multinucleated myotubes when serum is partially withdrawn. Northern blot analysis of RNA isolated from sub-confluent C2C12 cells maintained in high serum revealed that Vgl-2 is present in these cultures (Fig. 1C). However, this likely reflects the presence of a small number of differentiated muscle cells, as the differentiated muscle marker myosin heavy chain was also expressed at low levels (data not shown). Upon serum withdrawal, Vgl-2 mRNA levels were progressively up-regulated in differentiating myotubes. Thus, muscle differentiation is associated with an increase in Vgl-2 expression. Because Vgl-2 expression is muscle-specific in adult tissues, we determined the timing of Vgl-2 expression in relation to a known marker of the myogenic differentiation program using in situ hybridization of whole mount embryos and in sections (Fig. 2). During embryonic development, the epaxial skeletal muscles of the back are derived from the myotome compartment of the somites, whereas all hypaxial limb muscles are der"

Here we show that nectin-1α undergoes intramembrane proteolytic processing analogous to that of the Alzheimer's disease amyloid precursor protein, mediated by a presenilin (PS)-dependent γ-secretase-like activity. 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) treatment of Chinese hamster ovary cells activated a first proteolytic event, resulting in ectodomain shedding of nectin-1α. Subsequent cleavage of the remaining 26-kDa membrane-anchored C-terminal fragment (CTF) was inhibited independently by three specific γ−secretase inhibitors and by expression of the dominant negative form of PS1. The PS/γ-secretase-like cleavage product was detected in vivofollowing proteasome inhibitor treatment of cells. An in vitro γ-secretase assay confirmed the generation of a 24-kDa nectin-1α intracellular domain, peripherally associated with the membrane fraction. We also found nectin-1α to interact with the N-terminal fragment of PS1. Finally, γ-secretase inhibition resulted in β-catenin release from cell junctions, concomitantly with the accumulation of the 26-kDa nectin-1α CTF, suggesting that high levels of nectin-1α CTF interfere with TPA-induced remodeling of cell-cell junctions. Our results are consistent with a previously reported role for PS/γ-secretase in adherens junction function involving cleavage of cadherins.

Mechanisms governing apoptosis and clearance of activated neutrophils from inflamed areas are still poorly understood. We used dimethylsulfoxide-differentiated HL-60 cells showing inducible oxidase activity to study NADPH oxidase-induced apoptosis pathways typical of neutrophils. Activation of the NADPH oxidase by phorbol myristate acetate caused oxidative stress as shown by production of superoxide and hydrogen peroxide, depletion of intracellular glutathione, and peroxidation of all three major classes of membrane phospholipids, phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, and phosphatidylserine. In addition, phorbol myristate acetate stimulation of the NADPH oxidase caused apoptosis, as evidenced by apoptosis-specific phosphatidylserine externalization, increased caspase-3 activity, chromatin condensation, and nuclear fragmentation. Furthermore, phorbol myristate acetate stimulation of the NADPH oxidase caused recognition and ingestion of dimethylsulfoxide-differentiated HL-60 cells by J774A.1 macrophages. To reveal the apoptosis-related component of oxidative stress in the phorbol myristate acetate-induced response, we pretreated cells with a pancaspase inhibitor, benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethyl ketone (z-VAD-fmk), and found that it caused partial inhibition of hydrogen peroxide formation as well as selective protection of only phosphatidylserine, whereas more abundant phospholipids, phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine, were oxidized to the same extent in the absence or presence of z-VAD-fmk. In contrast, inhibitors of NADPH oxidase activity, diphenylene iodonium and staurosporine, as well as antioxidant enzymes, superoxide dismutase/catalase, completely protected all phospholipids against peroxidation, inhibited expression of apoptotic biomarkers and externalization of phosphatidylserine, and reduced phagocytosis of differentiated HL-60 cells by J774A.1 macrophages. Similarly, zymosan-induced activation of the NADPH oxidase resulted in the production of superoxide and oxidation of different classes of phospholipids of which only phosphatidylserine was protected by z-VAD-fmk. Accordingly, zymosan caused apoptosis in differentiated HL-60 cells, as evidenced by caspase-3 activation and phosphatidylserine externalization. Finally, zymosan triggered caspase-3 activation and extensive SOD/catalase-inhibitable phosphatidylserine exposure in human neutrophils. Overall, our results indicate that NADPH oxidase-induced oxidative stress in neutrophil-like cells triggers apoptosis and subsequent recognition and removal of these cells through pathways dependent on oxidation and externalization of phosphatidylserine.

Neutrophils aid host defense by killing invading microorganisms through production of highly reactive oxygen species (ROS) 1The abbreviations used are: ROS, reactive oxygen species; z-VAD-fmk, benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethyl ketone; DPI, diphenylene iodonium; FBS, fetal bovine serum; MCLA, 2-methyl-6-(4-methoxyphenyl)-3,7-dihydroimidazol[1,2-a]pyrazin-3-one hydrochloride; MPO, myeloperoxidase; PC, phosphatidylcholine; PE, phosphatidylethanolamine; PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; PnA, cis-parinaric acid; PS, phosphatidylserine; SOD, superoxide dismutase; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; HPTLC, high performance thin layer chromatography; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid1The abbreviations used are: ROS, reactive oxygen species; z-VAD-fmk, benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethyl ketone; DPI, diphenylene iodonium; FBS, fetal bovine serum; MCLA, 2-methyl-6-(4-methoxyphenyl)-3,7-dihydroimidazol[1,2-a]pyrazin-3-one hydrochloride; MPO, myeloperoxidase; PC, phosphatidylcholine; PE, phosphatidylethanolamine; PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; PnA, cis-parinaric acid; PS, phosphatidylserine; SOD, superoxide dismutase; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; HPTLC, high performance thin layer chromatography; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid generated by activation of the NADPH oxidase complex. When released inappropriately into the extracellular milieu, these ROS can cause persistent inflammation and considerable damage to the surrounding, healthy tissues. To prevent calamitous release of ROS, macrophages remove excess activated neutrophils from an inflammatory site in a regulated way, through processes that ensure swift resolution of inflammation yet make provision for neutrophils to fulfill their microbicidal function. Phagocytic cells carry out this clearance by recognizing apoptotic neutrophils through a mechanism that involves the exposure of phosphatidylserine (PS) on the neutrophil cell surface (1Fadok V.A. de Cathelineau A.

Apoptosis. 1998; 3: 9-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Neutrophils are short lived; in the absence of inflammation, resting neutrophils undergo apoptosis in the circulation after 6–9 h (7Etzioni A. Tonetti M. Immunol. Rev. 2000; 178: 138-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Conversely, when neutrophils reach a site of inflammation, apoptosis is delayed by inflammatory cytokines in the tissues, providing additional time for completion of the neutrophil's microbicidal function (8Webb P.R. Wang K.Q. Schell-Toellner D. Pongracz J. Salmon M. Lord J.M. Apoptosis. 2000; 5: 451-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). However, neutrophils also become activated when they migrate from the blood; their subsequent production of ROS generates oxidative stress that instigates apoptosis (9Lundqvist-Gustafsson H. Bengtsson T. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1999; 65: 196-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 10Narayanan P.K. Ragheb K. Lawler G. Robinson J.P. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1997; 61: 481-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Redox-dependent mechanisms for apoptosis include the intracellular production of superoxide (O2⨪) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) by activation of the NADPH oxidase in the granule pool (9Lundqvist-Gustafsson H. Bengtsson T. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1999; 65: 196-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) or the down-regulation of key antioxidant systems of the cell, such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), and a decrease in GSH (10Narayanan P.K. Ragheb K. Lawler G. Robinson J.P. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1997; 61: 481-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In addition, macrophages and phagocytic cells in the inflammatory area release Fas ligand during phagocytosis, contributing further to triggering apoptosis in neutrophils (11Brown S.B. Savill J. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 480-485PubMed Google Scholar). Altogether, the organism maintains a delicate balance among ROS production, cytokine-induced delay of apoptosis, and ROS-promoted neutrophilic death to protect the host tissues from excessive oxidative injury. Although the involvement of the NADPH oxidase in neutrophil apoptosis has been demonstrated (9Lundqvist-Gustafsson H. Bengtsson T. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1999; 65: 196-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 10Narayanan P.K. Ragheb K. Lawler G. Robinson J.P. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1997; 61: 481-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), specific signaling pathways through which oxidative stress participates in recognition and clearance of apoptotic neutrophils have not been elucidated. We have previously shown that specific oxidation and externalization of PS was characteristic of oxidant-induced apoptosis in several different cell lines (12Kagan V.E. Fabisiak J.P. Shevedova A.A. Tyurina Y.Y. Tyurin V.A. Schor N.F. Kawai K. FEBS Lett. 2000; 477: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). We further hypothesized that NADPH oxidase-induced oxidative stress plays a specific role in recognition and clearance, a role realized through selective oxidation of PS, associated with PS externalization on the neutrophilic cell surface, and subsequent recognition of apoptotic cells by macrophages. In the present work, we used Me2SO-differentiated HL-60 cells as a model to study NADPH oxidase-induced apoptosis pathways typical of neutrophils. In a separate series of experiments, we also used human neutrophils to corroborate our findings. Me2SO-differentiated HL-60 cells, in contrast to their nondifferentiated parental cells, possess a complete NADPH oxidase system (13Hua J. Hasebe T. Someya A. Nakamura S. Sugimoto K. Nagaoka I. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2000; 68: 216-224PubMed Google Scholar) that can be activated by various agents (phorbol esters, chemoattractant peptides, and phagocytosable particles such as opsonized zymosan, calcium ionophores, etc.). Our results suggest the following sequence of events in the apoptotic execution program of Me2SO-differentiated HL-60 cells stimulated with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) or opsonized zymosan: (i) activation of NADPH oxidase-dependent O2⨪ and H2O2 production; (ii) oxidation of different classes of phospholipids of which only PS was specifically protected by a pancaspase inhibitor, z-VAD-fmk; (iii) externalization of PS on the cell surface; and (iv) recognition and clearance of apoptotic cells by the macrophage cell line J774A.1 (after PMA stimulation). The involvement of the NADPH oxidase in this signaling cascade has been evidenced by the inhibitory effect of diphenylene iodonium (DPI) and staurosporine as well as by a combination of SOD/catalase. Thus, we present evidence of a new signaling pathway for apoptosis in which oxidative stress is inherently involved in PS oxidation and externalization and its subsequent recognition and through which neutrophilic cells facilitate their own clearance by macrophages.

HPLC solvents (methanol, chloroform, hexane, and water) were obtained from Aldrich. Cetyltrimethylammonium bromide was purchased from Acros Organics (Pittsburgh, PA). 7-Amino-4-methylcoumarin and acetyl-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-amino-4-methylcoumarin were purchased from Peptides International (Louisville, KY).

Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and RPMI 1640 medium, agarose, and 100-bp DNA ladder standards were obtained from Invitrogen Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA). The purity of PnA was determined by UV spectrophotometry at 304 nm in ethanol (ε = 80 mm−1cm−1). All other chemicals used were of analytical grade. HL-60 human promyelocytic leukemia cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 12.5% heat-inactivated FBS at 37 °C and in a humidified atmosphere (5% CO2 plus 95% air). Cells were seeded at a density of 5 × 105/ml and grown for 6 days in the presence of 1.25% Me2SO to induce differentiation to the neutrophilic lineage. Fresh medium with Me2SO was added on the third day of culture to prevent cell overgrowth and depletion of nutrients (14Trayner I.D. Bustorff T. Etches A.E. Muffi G.J. Foss Y. Farzaneh F. Leukemia Res. 1998; 22: 537-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Several different criteria were utilized to characterize the effectiveness of differentiation (15Wijermans P.W. Ossenkoppele G.J. Huijgens P.C. Imandt L.M.F.M. de Waal F.C. Langenhuijsen M.M.A.C. Leukemia Res. 1987; 11: 641-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar): (i) an increase of NADPH oxidase activity from <0.05 in nondifferentiated HL-60 cells to 1.25 nmol of superoxide/min/106 cells in Me2SO-treated PMA-stimulated HL-60 cells; (ii) a 12-fold decrease of MPO activity (from 55.25 ± 9.16 to 4.62 ± 1.30 nmol of guaiacol reduced/min/106 cells before and after Me2SO treatment, respectively); (iii) the fact that over 95% of Me2SO-treated cells were viable and had a significantly smaller size than parental nondifferentiated cells (14Trayner I.D. Bustorff T. Etches A.E. Muffi G.J. Foss Y. Farzaneh F. Leukemia Res. 1998; 22: 537-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar); and (iv) FACScan analysis to determine the number of Me2SO-differentiated HL-60 cells after stimulation with PMA utilizing dihydrorhodamine 123 staining for the NADPH oxidase. After PMA stimulation, 97 ± 1% of Me2SO-differentiated HL-60 cells were responsive to dihydrorhodamine 123 (5 μg/ml) staining, whereas less than 1% of nondifferentiated cells appeared to be dihydrorhodamine 123-positive (16van Pelt L.J. van Zwieten R. Weening R.S. Roos D. Verhoeven A.J. Bolscher B.G. J. Immunol. Methods. 1996; 191: 187-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). After 6 days, cells were collected by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 5 min, washed in prewarmed PBS buffer (pH 7.4), and resuspended in PBS buffer containing 0.5 mm CaCl2, 1 mmMgCl2, and 30 mm glucose (PBS+). Cells were either immediately used for assays or kept on ice for no longer than 3 h. For some experiments (those involving assays for GSH, caspase-3 activity, aminophospholipid externalization, annexin V binding assay, nuclear morphology, and DNA laddering), cells were washed and resuspended in FBS-free RPMI 1640 medium without phenol red. After treatment of cells (2 × 106 cells/ml) with PMA, an equal volume of phenol red-free RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 25% FBS (to yield a final concentration of 12.5% FBS) was added to cells, and incubation was extended for another 2 or 4 h. At the end of this period, cells were recovered and washed once with serum-free RPMI 1640 medium. When tested, inhibitors (20 μm DPI, 0.1 μg/ml staurosporine, 50 units/ml SOD plus 50 units/ml catalase (1000 units/ml for neutrophils), and 50 μm z-VAD-fmk) were included in the incubation mixture 5–30 min prior to PMA treatment. Both Me2SO-differentiated HL-60 cells and neutrophils were stimulated by 50 μg/ml zymosan (opsonized in human or autologous serum, for neutrophil experiments, at 37 °C for 20–30 min) in RPMI medium for 2–6 h. Neutrophils were also stimulated with 0.1 μg/ml PMA. In all experiments, cell viability after treatments was greater than 90%, as assayed by the trypan blue dye exclusion method. Macrophages (J774A.1; ATCC cell line) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 50 μg/ml gentamycin sulfate and incubated in a humidified atmosphere (5% CO2 plus 95% air) at 37 °C. Neutrophils were isolated from blood obtained from adult blood donors as described by Fadeel et al. (17Fadeel B. Åhlin A. Henter J.-I. Orrenius S. Hampton M.B. Blood. 1998; 92: 4808-4818Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells (1.0 × 106 cells/ml) were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS and penicillin plus streptomycin. Following PMA treatment, neutrophils were recovered by trypsinization according to standard procedures; for zymosan-treated cells, no trypsinization was necessary. After stimulation of cells with PMA, NADPH oxidase activity was determined as the superoxide (O2⨪) production by two different methods: MCLA-enhanced chemiluminescence (to measure instant O2⨪ production at any given moment) and cytochromec reduction (to measure cumulative amounts of O2⨪produced over a period of time). Me2SO-differentiated and naive HL-60 cells (2 × 106 cells/ml) in prewarmed PBS+ were monitored continuously for 1 min in Luminescent Analyzer 633 (Coral Biomedical Inc., San Diego, CA), set at 37 °C and continuous mixing, in the presence of 4 μm MCLA. After 1 min, a stimulant (0.125 μg/ml PMA or 50 μg/ml zymosan) was added by automated injection, and continuous readings were taken for another 10–30 min. Assays were performed in the absence and in the presence of various inhibitors (SOD/catalase, z-VAD-fmk, staurosporine, or DPI) added 5–30 min prior to the addition of MCLA. Total O2⨪ release was measured as the area under the curve (mV × s) upon PMA or opsonized zymosan stimulation and after subtracting values obtained in the presence of SOD. Data were collected and analyzed with the Multiuse PC software version 2.0.2 for Luminoskan 1251 Carousel (Labsystems). Cells, at a density of 2 × 106 cells/ml of prewarmed PBS+ (1-ml final volume) containing 100 μm cytochrome c, were incubated at 37 °C in the absence and in the presence of 50 units/ml SOD. At 5-min intervals after stimulation of cells with 0.125 μg/ml PMA, 50-μl aliquots were taken; reactions were stopped by the addition of an excess of SOD, and aliquots were mixed on a vortex and put on ice. Cells were pelleted, and clear supernatants were monitored in a SpectroMate microspectrophotometer (World Precision Instruments Inc., Sarasota, FL). Superoxide-dependent reduction of cytochrome c was calculated by subtracting the absorbance values at 550 nm (ε = 29.5 mm−1cm−1) of samples without SOD from those with SOD. H2O2 levels were determined using Amplex Red (10-acetyl-3,7-dihydroxyphenoxazine) reagent, the oxidation of which yields a fluorescent product in the presence of hydrogen peroxide and horseradish peroxidase (18Mohanty J.G. Jaffe J.S. Schulman E.S. Raible D.G. J. Immunol. Methods. 1997; 202: 133-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). Briefly, Amplex Red (50 μm) and 1 unit/ml horseradish peroxidase were added to cells (105/100 μl) incubated in PBS; the reaction was initiated by PMA in the presence or absence of DPI, SOD/catalase, or z-VAD-fmk for 30 min at 37 °C. After incubation, the cells were centrifuged (1000 × g for 5 min), and the measurements were carried out in the supernatants at 530/590 nm (λex/λem) by using a CytoFluor model 2350 fluorescence microplate reader (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). Fluorescence read-outs were converted into H2O2concentrations (μm) by using a calibration curve and presented as nmol of H2O2/106cells. Amplex Red assay of H2O2 determines only extracellular H2O2. The source of this extracellular H2O2 could be (i) extracellular nonenzymatic dismutation of superoxide radicals generated by PMA stimulation and (ii) intracellularly produced H2O2 (in particular, generated by disrupted mitochondrial electron transport in the course of apoptosis). This intracellularly produced H2O2 could be catalytically decomposed, at least in part, before it was excreted from cells into extracellular environments. As a result, part of intracellularly generated H2O2 was not detectable in our experiments with the Amplex Red assay. To minimize potential effect of adventitious transition metals on the results of the assay, our measurements of H2O2 in cell suspensions in PBS were performed after pretreatment of the buffer with a chelating resin (Chelex 100 resin; Bio-Rad). Glutathione content in the cells was determined fluorometrically using ThioGlo-1™ as previously described (19Kagan V.E. Yalowich J.C. Borisenko G.G. Tyurina Y.Y. Tyurin V.A. Thampatty P. Fabisiak J.P. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 56: 494-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells treated with PMA and/or a variety of inhibitors (SOD/catalase, staurosporine, and DPI) were incubated for 30 min, harvested, resuspended in PBS, and lysed by freezing and thawing once. Immediately after the addition of 10 μm ThioGlo-1™ to the cell lysates, fluorescence was measured in a CytoFluor 2350 (Millipore Corp.) fluorescence microplate reader using excitation at 360 ± 40 nm and emission at 530 ± 25 nm. Total protein sulfhydryls relative to controls were determined as an additional fluorescence response at the same wavelength 1 h after the addition of 3.3 mm SDS to the ThioGlo-1™-treated lysates kept at room temperature in the dark. PnA was metabolically incorporated into Me2SO-differentiated HL-60 cell phospholipids (2 × 106 cells/ml) by the addition of PnA-human serum albumin complex to give a final concentration of 1 μg of PnA/106cells in FBS-free RPMI 1640 medium without phenol red; cells were incubated for 2 h at 37 °C. PnA-labeled cells were incubated with 0.125 μg/ml PMA or 50 μg/ml opsonized zymosan in PBS+ buffer for 30 min at 37 °C in the absence and in the presence of various inhibitors including SOD/catalase, DPI, staurosporine, and z-VAD-fmk. At the end of the incubation period, phospholipid oxidation was determined according to previously described methods (20Kagan V.E. Ritov V.B. Tyurina Y.Y. Tyurin V.A. Methods Mol. Biol. 1998; 108: 71-87PubMed Google Scholar). The phospholipid classes in the lipid extract (50 μg of total phospholipids) were separated by two-dimensional HPTLC on silica G plates (5 × 5 cm; Whatman) according to methods previously described (21Vladimirov Y.A.

Labeling of externalized aminophospholipids, PS and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), with fluorescamine (a nonpermeating probe for visualizing lipids that contain primary amino groups) was carried out by a slight modification of methods previously described by our laboratory (22Fabisiak J.P.

Briefly, HL-60 cells (3 × 107) treated with PMA from 0.5 to 2.5 h were suspended in labeling buffer (150 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mmMgCl2, 2 mm CaCl2, 5 mmNaHCO3, 5 mm glucose, and 20 mmHEPES; pH 8.0). Cells were gently agitated in the presence of fluorescamine (200 μm) for 15 s. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4. Cells were collected by centrifugation, and lipids were extracted by the Folch procedure (23Folch J. Lees M. Sloan-Stanley G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1957; 226: 497-509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and analyzed by HPTLC. Fluorescamine-modified PS and PE were localized by exposure of HPTLC plates to UV light by using a Fluor-S™ MultiImager (Bio-Rad) imaging system. Unmodified phospholipids were visualized under visible light in a Fluor-S™ MultiImager (Bio-Rad) imaging system after exposure of HPTLC plates to iodine vapor. The phosphorus content of phospholipids was determined according to Bottcher et al. (24Bottcher C.J.F. van Gent C.M. Pries C. Anal. Chim. Acta. 1961; 24: 203-204Crossref Scopus (848) Google Scholar) after scraping representative spots from the plate. The amounts of modified PS and PE were expressed as percentages of the total PS and PE (unmodified plus modified) recovered from the plate on the basis of phosphorus content assay. Annexin V binding to cells was determined using a commercially available staining kit (Oncogene Research Products, Boston, MA) and flow cytometry as previously described (22Fabisiak J.P. Tyurina Y.Y. Tyurin V.A. Lazo J.S. Kagan V.E. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 13781-13790Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). PMA-stimulated cells were washed once with PBS. Cells were incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated annexin V (0.5 μg/ml) for 15 min and then were collected by centrifugation and washed with binding buffer. Propidium iodide (0.6 μg/ml) was added, and cells were immediately analyzed with a FACScan flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA) with simultaneous monitoring of green fluorescence (530 nm, 30-nm band pass filter) for annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate and red fluorescence (long pass emission filter that transmits light >650 nm) associated with propidium iodide. A time course for PS externalization was carried out at 0, 0.5, 2.5, and 4.5 h after the addition of PMA or opsonized zymosan to cells. For neutrophils, PS externalization was assessed at 3 and 6 h after the addition of PMA and zymosan, respectively. The activity of caspase-3 was determined as described previously (25Kagaya S. Kitanaka C. Noguchi K. Mochizuki T. Sugiyama A. Asai A. Yasuhara N. Eguchi Y. Tsujimoto Y. Kuchino Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6736-6745Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Briefly, at the indicated times (30 min, 2.5 h, and 4.5 h) after stimulation with PMA or opsonized zymosan, cells were collected, washed in PBS, and lysed for 20 min on ice in lysis buffer containing 10 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.4), 2 mm EDTA, 0.1% CHAPS, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 5 mm dithiothreitol. The suspensions were centrifuged at 4 °C, and the supernatants were collected as lysates. For measurement of caspase activity, 10 μg of lysate diluted to 20 μl with lysis buffer was mixed with 20 μl of 2× ICE buffer (40 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.4), 20% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 4 mmdithiothreitol) containing 40 μmacetyl-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-amino-4-methylcoumarin (a fluorogenic peptide substrate) and incubated for 60 min at 37 °C. After 60 min, 460 μl of distilled water was added, and the fluorescence was measured in a CytoFluor 2350 (Millipore) fluorescence microplate reader using excitation at 360 ± 40 nm and emission at 460 ± 40 nm. One unit of caspase activity was defined as the amount of enzyme required to release 1 pmol of 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin/min. The protein concentration of 10 μg of cell lysates was measured by the method of Bradford (26Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (214455) Google Scholar). For neutrophil experiments, Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-7-amino-4-methylcoumarin data are presented as pmol of 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin released per 106 cells, as previously described (17Fadeel B. Åhlin A. Henter J.-I. Orrenius S. Hampton M.B. Blood. 1998; 92: 4808-4818Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). At specified time intervals, commensurate aliquots of PMA-stimulated HL-60 cell suspension were taken, and cells were washed and resuspended in PBS. Hoechst 33342 (5 μg/ml) was added, and cells were examined under fluorescence microscopy. Results were expressed as the percentage of the cells showing characteristic nuclear morphological features of apoptosis (nuclear condensation and f"

We recently identified NRAGE, a protein that directly interacts with the p75NTR cytosolic region and facilitates p75NTR-mediated cell death. For the present study, we developed an inducible recombinant NRAGE adenovirus to dissect the mechanism of NRAGE-mediated apoptosis. Induced NRAGE expression resulted in robust activation of the JNK pathway that was not inhibited by the pharmacological mixed lineage kinase (MLK) inhibitor CEP1347. NRAGE induced cytosolic accumulation of cytochrome c, activation of Caspases-3, -9 and -7, and caspase-dependent cell death. Blocking JNK and c-Jun action by overexpression of the JNK-binding domain of JIP1 or dominant-negative c-Jun ablated NRAGE-mediated caspase activation and NRAGE-induced cell death.

These findings identify NRAGE as a p75NTR interactor capable of inducing caspase activation and cell death through a JNK-dependent mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. The neurotrophins are a family of growth factors involved in the survival, development, and death of specific populations of neurons and non-neuronal cells. Their effects are mediated by binding to cell surface tyrosine-kinase receptors and to the p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR). 1The abbreviations used are: p75NTR, p75 neurotrophin receptor; JNK, c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase; JIP, JNK-interacting protein; JBD, JNK binding domain; MLK, mixed lineage kinase; EGFP, enhanced green fluorescence protein; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; MTT, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide; LDH, lactate dehydrogenase; m.o.i., multiplicity of infection; PARP, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase; BAF, Boc-Asp-fmk; Ad, adenovirus; HA, hemagglutinin. Roles for tyrosine-kinase receptors in neurotrophin-dependent growth, survival, and synapse function are well established, but the precise physiological functions of p75NTR are still being defined. p75NTR can act as a co-receptor for tyrosine-kinase receptors, but p75NTR is also expressed in many cells that lack catalytically active tyrosine-kinase receptors, where it functions autonomously to mediate neurotrophin signaling events (1Barrett G.L. Prog. Neurobiol. 2000; 61: 205-229Google Scholar). Numerous studies over the last several years have shown that p75NTR can induce apoptosis in a variety of settings. For example, p75NTR-dependent cell death has been observed in cultured trigeminal neurons (2Davey F. Davies A.M. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 915-918Google Scholar), embryonic hippocampal neurons (3Friedman W.J. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 6340-6346Google Scholar), neonatal sympathetic neurons (4Bamji S.X. Majdan M. Pozniak C.D. Belliveau D.J. Aloyz R. Kohn J. Causing C.G. Miller F.D. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 911-923Google Scholar), neonatal Schwann cells (5Soilu-Hanninen M. Ekert P. Bucci T. Syroid D. Bartlett P.F. Kilpatrick T.J. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 4828-4838Google Scholar), neuroblastoma cells (6Bunone G. Mariotti A. Compagni A. Morandi E. Della Valle G. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 1463-1470Google Scholar), and within explants of otic vesicles (7Frago L.M. Leon Y. de la Rosa E.J. Gomez-Munoz A. Varela-Nieto I. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 549-556Google Scholar). In vivo, overexpression of the intracellular domain of p75NTR in transgenic mouse neurons results in widespread apoptosis of peripheral and central neurons (8Majdan M. Lachance C. Gloster A. Aloyz R. Zeindler C. Bamji S. Bhakar A. Belliveau D. Fawcett J. Miller F.D. Barker P.A. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 6988-6998Google Scholar). Accordingly, disruption of nerve growth factor binding to p75NTR reduces apoptosis in the retina (9Frade J.M. Rodriguez-Tebar A. Barde Y.A. Nature. 1996; 383: 166-168Google Scholar); mice lacking full-length p75NTR exhibit decreased apoptosis in the developing spinal cord and retina (10Frade J.M. Barde Y.A. Development. 1999; 126: 683-690Crossref Google Scholar) and display increased numbers of sympathetic and sensory neurons following the normal period of naturally occurring cell death (4Bamji S.X.

Neurosci. 2000; 16: 258-268Google Scholar). The precise signaling events that link p75NTR activation to apoptotic cascades remain uncertain, but several findings suggest that activation of the JNK pathway may play a key role. A number of studies have shown that p75NTR-dependent apoptosis correlates with an increase in JNK activity (3Friedman W.J. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 6340-6346Google Scholar, 4Bamji S.X. Majdan M.

Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23097-23104Google Scholar), and some studies have demonstrated that blockade of the JNK pathway with chemical inhibitors (3Friedman W.J. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 6340-6346Google Scholar, 13Yoon S.O. Casaccia-Bonnefil P. Carter B. Chao M.V. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 3273-3281Google Scholar) or dominant-negative forms of JNK (15Harrington A.W. Kim J.Y. Yoon S.O. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 156-166Google Scholar) attenuates p75NTR-dependent death in oligodendrocytes and hippocampal neurons. Several p75NTR-interacting proteins have been recently identified (1Barrett G.L. Prog. Neurobiol. 2000; 61: 205-229Google Scholar). Some of these, including NRIF (16Casademunt E. Carter B.D. Benzel I. Frade J.M. Dechant G. Barde Y.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6050-6061Google Scholar) and NADE (17Mukai J. Hachiya T. Shoji-Hoshino S. Kimura M.T. Nadano D. Suvanto P. Hanaoka T. Li Y. Irie S. Greene L.A. Sato T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17566-17570Google Scholar), appear to facilitate p75NTR-dependent apoptosis, but to date, p75NTR interactors have not been linked to specific apoptotic cascades. We recently demonstrated that NRAGE, a novel member of the MAGE family, binds to p75NTR under physiological conditions and facilitates p75NTR-dependent cell death (18Salehi A.H. Roux P.P. Kubu C.J. Zeindler C. Bhakar A. Tannis L.L. Verdi J.M. Barker P.A. Neuron. 2000; 27: 279-288Google Scholar). For the present study, we developed an overexpression paradigm to examine signaling pathways activated by NRAGE. Our data indicate that NRAGE is a potent apoptotic inducer that activates a mitochondrial death pathway involving cytochrome c release and activation of Caspase-9, -7, and -3. NRAGE-induced apoptosis correlates with MLK-independent activation of JNK and with c-Jun phosphorylation. Accordingly, blockers of JNK activity or c-Jun-mediated transcription inhibit NRAGE-dependent caspase activation and reduce apoptosis. Together, these data demonstrate that the p75NTR interactor NRAGE activates a mitochondrial apoptotic cascade through a JNK- and c-Jun-dependent pathway. zVAD-fmk was purchased from Enzyme System Products.

The antibody raised against the amino terminus of NRAGE has been previously described (18Salehi A.H. Roux P.P. Kubu C.J. Zeindler C. Bhakar A. Tannis L.L. Verdi J.M. Barker P.A. Neuron. 2000; 27: 279-288Google Scholar). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories. Immunoreactive bands were detected using enhanced chemiluminescence purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. All other reagents were from Sigma or ICN Biochemicals, unless otherwise indicated. Preparation of recombinant adenovirus expressing enhanced green fluorescence protein (EGFP), β-galactosidase, and the myristoylated p75NTR intracellular domain (mICD) has been previously described (14Roux P.P. Bhakar A.L. Kennedy T.E. Barker P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23097-23104Google Scholar). Recombinant adenoviruses expressing FLAG-tagged JNK-binding domain of JIP1, FLAG-tagged dominant-negative c-Jun, and HA epitope-tagged MLK-3 were provided by Dr. Aviva Tolkovsky, Aegera Therapeutics, and David Kaplan, respectively, and their construction has been described elsewhere (19Harding T.C.

To produce recombinant adenovirus driving the Tet-inducible expression of Myc epitope-tagged full-length NRAGE, full-length rat NRAGE cDNA was subcloned into the vector cytomegalovirus 5′-TetO, and recombinant virus was generated and plaque purified in 293A cells. All viruses were amplified in 293A cells and purified on a sucrose gradient, as previously described (14Roux P.P. Bhakar A.L. Kennedy T.E. Barker P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23097-23104Google Scholar). Viruses were then titered by optical density and by using the tissue culture infectious dose 50 (TCID) assay in 293A cells (22Quantum Biotechnology, Inc. Ad Easy Vector System Application Manual, Version 1.2. Quantum Biotechnologies, Montreal, Canada2000Google Scholar). Titers are expressed as plaque-forming units. The PC12rtTA cell line was purchased from Clontech (catalogue no. C3015–1) and maintained in 10% CO2 at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Clontech), 5% horse serum, 2 mml-glutamine, 100 μg/ml penicillin/streptomycin, and 100 μg/ml G418. Cells were plated 18–24 h prior to infection. Where indicated, 1 μg/ml doxycycline was added to the plates at time of infection. Forty-eight hours post-infection, cells were harvested on ice, washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline, and caspase activity was measured at room temperature using the fluorescent substrate DEVD-amino-methyl-coumarin (AMC) at a concentration of 10 μm as described previously (23Thornberry N.A. Rano T.A. Peterson E.P. Rasper D.M. Timkey T. Garcia-Calvo M. Houtzager V.M. Nordstrom P.A. Roy S. Vaillancourt J.P. Chapman K.T. Nicholson D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17907-17911Google Scholar). Cytosol-enriched subcellular fractions were prepared using a modification of a previously described protocol (24Samali A. Cai J. Zhivotovsky B. Jones D.P. Orrenius S. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2040-2048Scopus (448) Google Scholar). In brief, 5,000,000 cells were harvested, washed once in Tris-buffered saline (10 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl), once in Buffer A (100 mm sucrose, 1 mm EGTA, 20 mm MOPS (pH 7.4)), and then resuspended in 500 μl of Buffer B (Buffer A plus 5% Percoll, 0.01% digitonin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). A sample of this suspension was retained as total cell lysate. The remainder was incubated on ice for 15 min and then centrifuged at 2500 × g for 10 min to remove intact cells and nuclei. The supernatant was then centrifuged at 15 000 × g for 15 min to pellet mitochondria. The final supernatant was designated cytosol. Cells were lysed in RIPA buffer (10 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and analyzed for protein content using the BCA assay (Pierce). Samples were normalized for protein content, suspended in Laemmli sample buffer, separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and electroblotted onto nitrocellulose. Blocking and secondary antibody incubations of immunoblots were performed in Tris-buffered saline/Tween (10 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 0.2% Tween 20) supplemented with 5% (w/v) dried skim milk powder. All primary antibody incubations were performed in the blocking solution, except for those involving phospho-specific antibodies, which were performed in Tris-buffered saline/Tween supplemented with 5% (w/v) bovine serum albumin. Immunoreactive bands were detected by chemiluminescence (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Analysis of cell survival was performed by MTT assay using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT), which was added at a final concentration of 1 mg/ml for the last 4 h of a 2-day infection. The reaction was ended by the addition of 1 volume of solubilization buffer (20% SDS, 10% dimethylformamide, and 20% acetic acid). After overnight solubilization, specific and nonspecific absorbances were read at 570 and 690 nm, respectively. In each experiment, each data point was performed in triplicate or quadruplicate, and experimental results were analyzed by multiple analyses of variance with statistical probabilities assigned using the Tukey test for multiple comparisons. Each experiment was carried out independently at least three times. In the case of MTT assays that were accompanied by parallel lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) experiments, cells were treated as described below prior to infection. Analysis of cell death was performed by the LDH assay using the cytotoxicity detection kit (Roche, catalogue no. 1644793) according to the manufacturer's instructions. In brief, prior to infection, cells were washed three times with an equal volume of PC12rtTA medium, and then the medium serum concentration was reduced by 20% by the addition of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. Forty hours after infection, cell cultures were centrifuged at 500 × g, and the supernatant was added to an equal volume of LDH reaction mixture supplied by the manufacturer (Roche). After 15–30 min of incubation, specific and nonspecific absorbances were read at 490 (A490 nm) and 690 (A690 nm), respectively. Values reported were calculated using the following formula: (A490 nm − A690 nm) − (A490 nm of media alone −A690 nm of media alone). Each data point was performed in triplicate or quadruplicate, and experimental results were analyzed by multiple analyses of variance with statistical probabilities assigned using the Tukey test for multiple comparisons. Each experiment was carried out independently at least three times. To investigate signaling pathways involved in NRAGE-mediated cell death, we constructed a recombinant adenovirus driving the expression of full-length NRAGE (AdNRG). Previous attempts to produce virus in which expression of an NRAGE fragment was driven by a constitutively active cytomegalovirus promoter had proven unsuccessful, presumably because of a pro-apoptotic effect of NRAGE. Therefore, we designed an adenovirus that would allow for the doxycycline-inducible expression of full-length NRAGE (tagged with an amino-terminal myc epitope, myc-NRAGE) in cells co-expressing a doxycycline-regulated trans-acting factor, rtTA. For our studies, PC12 cells stably expressing the doxycycline-regulated trans-acting factor were used (PC12rtTA). Fig. 1A shows that NRAGE expression in AdNRG-infected cells is minimal in the absence of doxycycline but is strongly induced following addition of 1 μg/ml doxycycline. A small amount of 'leaky’ NRAGE expression occurs, even in the absence of doxycycline, but only at high multiplicities of infection (m.o.i.). To determine whether NRAGE induces cell death, PC12rtTAcells were infected with AdNRG in the absence or presence of 1 μg/ml doxycycline. AdNRG-infected PC12rtTA that were treated with doxycycline displayed dose-dependent cytoplasmic condensation, cell shrinkage, and detachment from the plate (data not shown). MTT viability assays performed to quantify this effect indicated that cells infected with AdNRG and treated with doxycycline displayed a significant loss in cell viability at all m.o.i. tested (Fig. 1B). In contrast, cells infected with a control virus expressing enhanced green fluorescence protein (AdGFP) showed no significant loss of viability in presence or absence of doxycycline (Fig. 1B). As expected (14Roux P.P. Bhakar A.L. Kennedy T.E. Barker P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23097-23104Google Scholar), cells treated with a virus that constitutively expresses a myristoylated form of the p75NTR intracellular domain showed reduced viability that was unaffected by doxycycline (Fig. 1B). Together, these data indicate that NRAGE overexpression induces PC12rtTA cell death. Most forms of apoptosis converge on caspases as downstream effectors (25Budihardjo I. Oliver H. Lutter M. Luo X. Wang X. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 269-290Google Scholar). To determine whether caspases are activated during NRAGE-mediated cell death, a fluorogenic synthetic peptide (DEVD-amino-methyl-coumarin) cleavage assay (26Kidd V.J. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1998; 60: 533-573Google Scholar) was used to assess caspase activity (Fig. 2A). Doxycycline treatment had no effect on caspase activity in control-uninfected cells, and cells infected with a control AdGFP virus did not display increased caspase activity relative to control-uninfected cells in either the absence or presence of doxycycline. In contrast, cells infected with AdNRG and treated with doxycycline showed a robust induction of DEVD cleavage activity. Caspases are present within the cell in zymogen forms that, following an apoptotic signal, undergo proteolytic cleavage to produce active caspases (25Budihardjo I. Oliver H. Lutter M. Luo X. Wang X. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 269-290Google Scholar). To identify specific caspases activated by NRAGE overexpression, cells were either left uninfected or were infected with AdGFP or AdNRG in the absence or presence of doxycycline. Cells were then lysed and analyzed by immunoblot for levels of the intact Caspase-9 zymogen and for cleavage/activation of effector Caspases-3 and -7. Fig. 2B shows that doxycycline-induced NRAGE expression results in the reduction in levels of the Caspase-9 zymogen, a corresponding increase in activated Caspase-3 and -7, and the cleavage of PARP, a dual Caspase-3/7 substrate (25Budihardjo I. Oliver H. Lutter M. Luo X. Wang X. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 269-290Google Scholar). Uninfected cells or cells infected with AdGFP showed no evidence of caspase activation in either the absence or presence of doxycycline. Together, these results indicate that NRAGE is a potent inducer of Caspase-9, an initiator caspase, and Caspases-3 and -7, downstream effector caspases. To confirm that caspase activation is necessary for NRAGE-mediated cell death, the viability of cells overexpressing myc-NRAGE was examined after treatment with either Boc-Asp-fmk (BAF) or zVAD-fmk, both broad-spectrum inhibitors of caspase activity (26Kidd V.J. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1998; 60: 533-573Google Scholar). MTT survival and LDH death assays both revealed that NRAGE-induced death is significantly inhibited in the presence of BAF or zVAD-fmk (Fig. 2C), confirming a role for caspase activity in NRAGE-induced cell death. Together, these data establish that NRAGE induces cell death through an apoptotic mechanism involving caspase activation. Cleavage of the Caspase-9 zymogen requires formation of a complex consisting of Caspase-9, Apaf-1, and cytosolic cytochromec (25Budihardjo I. Oliver H. Lutter M. Luo X. Wang X. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 269-290Google Scholar). Release of cytochrome c from mitochondria into the cytosol is a key regulatory step in this process (27Gorman A.M. Ceccatelli S. Orrenius S. Dev.

To determine whether cytochrome c is released during NRAGE-induced apoptosis, cells were left uninfected or were infected with either AdNRG or with a control adenovirus driving constitutive expression of β-galactosidase (AdLacZ) in the presence of doxycycline (Fig. 2D). Cells were then lysed, subjected to subcellular fractionation, and cytosolic fractions were analyzed for cytochromec levels by immunoblot. Cytochrome c was not detected in the cytosol of uninfected cells or in cells infected with AdLacZ. However, high levels of cytochrome c were detected in the cytosol of cells expressing myc-NRAGE (Fig. 2D), indicating that NRAGE overexpression induces cytochrome crelease from the mitochondria. In some models of apoptosis, cytochrome c release may be a secondary event that occurs after caspase activation (25Budihardjo I. Oliver H. Lutter M. Luo X. Wang X. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 269-290Google Scholar, 28Li H. Zhu H. Xu C.J. Yuan J. Cell. 1998; 94: 491-501Google Scholar). To determine whether NRAGE-induced release of cytochrome c from mitochondria is independent of caspase activation, the effect of the caspase inhibitor zVAD-fmk on the accumulation of cytosolic cytochromec was examined. Fig. 2D shows that zVAD-fmk did not reduce NRAGE-mediated cytosolic cytochrome caccumulation, indicating that NRAGE-induced cytochrome crelease is not a consequence of caspase activation but instead lies upstream of caspase activation. Activation of Jun kinase (JNK) and consequent transcriptional events play a necessary role in several neuronal cell death paradigms that involve cytochrome c release (20Whitfield J. Neame S.J. Paquet L. Bernard O. Ham J. Neuron. 2001; 29: 629-643Google Scholar, 29Ham J. Eilers A. Whitfield J. Neame S.J. Shah B. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2000; 60: 1015-1021Google Scholar,30Chen Y.R. Tan T.H. Int. J. Oncol. 2000; 16: 651-662Google Scholar), such as p75NTR-dependent apoptosis (3Friedman W.J. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 6340-6346Google Scholar, 15Harrington A.W. Kim J.Y. Yoon S.O. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 156-166Google Scholar). To determine whether JNK is activated during NRAGE-induced apoptosis, PC12rtTA cells were left uninfected or were infected with AdNRG or the control viruses AdGFP or AdLacZ in the presence or absence of 1 μg/ml doxycycline, then lysed, and analyzed by immunoblot for JNK phosphostatus. Fig. 3 shows that NRAGE expression induced a robust increase in JNK phosphorylation with no increase in total JNK1 protein levels. JNK activation results in phosphorylation of c-Jun, which in turn leads to transcriptional activation of target promoters, including the promoter for c-Jun itself (31Angel P. Hattori K. Smeal T. Karin M. Cell. 1988; 55: 875-885Google Scholar, 32Pulverer B.J. Kyriakis J.M. Avruch J. Nikolakaki E. Woodgett J.R. Nature. 1991; 353: 670-674Google Scholar). Therefore, to confirm that NRAGE-mediated phosphorylation of JNK was an indication of JNK signaling pathway activation, phosphostatus and protein levels of c-Jun were determined. NRAGE overexpression resulted in a dramatic increase in both the phosphorylation of c-Jun (visualized by phospho-Jun Ser63immunoblot and by slower migrating band in the total c-Jun immunoblot) and in total c-Jun levels (Fig. 3). In contrast, cells infected with AdGFP or AdLacZ showed no alteration in the levels or phosphostatus of JNK or c-Jun. Under these infection conditions, EGFP is highly expressed by AdGFP, and it accumulates to much higher levels than myc-NRAGE (Fig. 3, bottom panel), indicating that the effects of NRAGE on the JNK pathway do not reflect overexpression artifacts. Together, these data demonstrate that NRAGE specifically increases JNK activity, leading to the phosphorylation of c-Jun and activation of c-Jun transcriptional activity. Mixed lineage kinases (MLKs) are MAP kinase kinase kinases (MAP3Ks) that have been identified as the upstream activators of the JNK pathway necessary for neurotrophin withdrawal-induced apoptosis (33Maroney A.C.

To determine whether CEP1347 blocks NRAGE-dependent activation of the JNK pathway, PC12rtTA cells were infected with either AdGFP, AdNRG, or with AdMLK-3, a recombinant adenovirus driving the expression of HA epitope-tagged MLK-3, and were then treated with CEP1347 or with a vehicle control. As expected, NRAGE or MLK-3 overexpression induced robust JNK phosphorylation, whereas EGFP overexpression had no discernable effect on JNK phosphostatus (Fig. 4A, compare lanes 2–4). Application of CEP1347 for 1 h strongly inhibited MLK-3-induced JNK phosphorylation but, surprisingly, had no effect on JNK phosphorylation induced by NRAGE (Fig. 4A, comparelanes 3 and 7, 4 and 8). To confirm that CEP1347 was indeed ineffective in blocking NRAGE-dependent activation of the JNK pathway, cells infected with AdNRG or with AdMLK-3 were maintained in CEP1347 for the duration of the infection and then examined for levels of c-Jun. Fig. 4B shows that NRAGE and MLK-3 overexpression induced c-Jun expression, presumably as a result of JNK-dependent AP-1-mediated transcription. CEP1347 treatment led to an almost complete block of the MLK-3-mediated increase in c-Jun protein levels but had no effect on accumulation of c-Jun induced by NRAGE. Therefore, it can be concluded that in PC12rtTA cells, NRAGE induces JNK activity and c-Jun accumulation through an MLK-independent pathway. The above observations are consistent with the hypothesis that NRAGE-mediated activation of the JNK pathway induces c-Jun-mediated transcriptional events that result in mitochondrial cytochromec release, Caspase-9 activation, and the activation of effector Caspases-3 and -7. To directly address the requirement of JNK activation in NRAGE apoptotic signaling, we employed an adenovirus (AdJBD) encoding the JNK binding domain of the JNK-interacting protein-1, which acts to sequester JNK and thereby inhibit JNK-dependent c-Jun phosphorylation (19Harding T.C. Xue L. Bienemann A. Haywood D. Dickens M. Tolkovsky A.M. Uney J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4531-4534Google Scholar). To examine the role of c-Jun-dependent transcription on NRAGE-induced apoptosis, we used an adenovirus encoding a c-Jun dominant-negative mutant (AdΔJun) that lacks the c-Jun transactivation domain and functions as an inhibitor of AP-1 activity (20Whitfield J.

https://openalex.org/W2140258025,"Insulin stimulates the fusion of intracellular vesicles containing the glucose transporter Glut4 with the plasma membrane in adipocytes and muscle cells. Glut4 vesicle fusion is thought to be catalyzed by the interaction of the vesicle solubleN-ethyl-maleimide-sensitive fusion protein attachment protein receptor VAMP2 with the target solubleN-ethyl-maleimide-sensitive fusion protein attachment protein receptors SNAP-23 and syntaxin 4. Here, we use combined membrane fractionation, detergent solubility, and sucrose gradient flotation to demonstrate that the large majority (>70%) of SNAP-23 and a significant proportion of syntaxin 4 (∼35%) are associated with plasma membrane lipid rafts in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Furthermore, VAMP2 is shown to be concentrated in lipid rafts isolated from intracellular membranes. Insulin stimulation had no effect on the plasma membrane raft association of SNAP-23 or syntaxin 4 but promoted VAMP2 insertion into plasma membrane rafts. Immunofluorescence analysis revealed that SNAP-23 was clustered at the plasma membrane and almost completely segregated from the transferrin receptor. SNAP-23 distribution seemed to be distinct from caveolin-1, and clusters of SNAP-23 were dispersed after cholesterol extraction with methyl-β-cyclodextrin, suggesting that the majority of SNAP-23 is associated with non-caveolar, cholesterol-rich lipid rafts. The results described implicate lipid rafts as important platforms for Glut4 vesicle fusion and suggest the hypothesis that such rafts may represent a spatial integration point of insulin signaling and membrane traffic."

Telomeres are distinct DNA-protein structures that protect eukaryotic chromosome ends from degradation and inappropriate recombination or fusion. Telomeres shorten every time a cell divides because of incomplete DNA replication and DNA end processing. When telomere length reaches a critical point, cells stop dividing and undergo replicative senescence (reviewed in Refs. 1Wright W.E. Shay J.W. Curr. Opin. Genet.

Cooper J.P. Cech T.R. Science. 1995; 269: 1533-1534Google Scholar). Most human somatic cells do not have telomerase activity and have a defined life span (5Hayflick L. Morrhead P. Exp. Cell Res. 1961; 25: 585-621Google Scholar), whereas most cancer cells have an indefinite proliferative capacity and maintain their telomere length by up-regulating telomerase (6Shay J.W. Bacchetti S.

In human cells, several proteins associated with telomerase activity have been identified. The “foldosome” proteins hsp90 and p23 interact with hTERT and are involved in assembly of telomerase activity (10Holt S.E. Aisner D.L. Baur J. Tesmer V.M. Dy M. Ouellette M. Trager J.B. Morin G.B.

Another telomerase-associated protein, TEP1, associates with both hTR and hTERT but is not essential for telomerase activity or telomere length maintenance in vivo (18Harrington L. McPhail T. Mar V.

Ku is a heterodimeric protein composed of an ∼70-kDa subunit (Ku70) and an ∼80-kDa subunit (Ku80 or Ku86). It is one of the most abundant proteins in human cells and is involved in multiple important cellular metabolic processes such as non-homologous end joining, V(D)J recombination of immunoglobulins and T-cell receptor genes, transcriptional regulation, DNA replication, regulation of heat shock-induced responses, and regulation of telomere maintenance (reviewed in Ref. 35Tuteja R.

The precise mechanism of Ku action at the telomere is still unclear. We report here that Ku associates physically with human telomerase. Immunoprecipitation with Ku-specific antibodies followed by the telomeric repeat amplification protocol (TRAP) 1The abbreviations used are: TRAP, telomeric repeat amplification protocol; HA, hemagglutinin; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; RRL, rabbit reticulocyte lysate; RF, release factor; DNA-PKcs, DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit assay demonstrated the association of Ku with telomerase both in vivo andin vitro. We also detected the association of Ku with hTERT protein in the absence of hTR or telomeric DNA, suggesting that the Ku-telomerase association is likely to be mediated through its interaction with the telomerase catalytic subunit.

Genet. 1997; 17: 498-502Google Scholar). Telomerase activity was reconstituted in the RRL system as described previously (10Holt S.E. Aisner D.L. Baur J. Tesmer V.M. Dy M. Ouellette M. Trager J.B. Morin G.B. Toft D.O. Shay J.W. Wright W.E. White M.A. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 817-826Google Scholar), and activity in all samples was determined by TRAP (10Holt S.E. Aisner D.L. Baur J. Tesmer V.M.

Wright W.E. Shay J.W. Harley C.B. Morin G.B. Nat. Genet. 1997; 17: 498-502Google Scholar). Non-radioactive TRAP analysis was performed as described (15Ford L.P. Shay J.W. Wright W.E. RNA. 2001; 7: 1068-1075Google Scholar) except that 25 cycles of PCR (95 °C for 30 s, 52 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s) were used to amplify telomerase-extended product. Products were separated on 10% polyacrylamide gels and visualized with the Storm 860 System using red fluorescence (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). For radioactive TRAP analysis, the TRAP-eze telomerase detection kit (Intergen, Purchase, NY), which includes a 36-bp internal standard to allow quantitation of activity, was used. After telomerase extension for 20 min at room temperature, extended products were amplified by a two-step PCR (94 °C for 30 s and 60 °C for 30 s) for 24 cycles. Products were separated on 10% polyacrylamide gels and exposed to phosphorimaging screens. Quantitative estimates of telomerase activity were calculated by determining the ratio of the 36-bp internal standard to the 6-bp telomerase-specific ladder. Immunoprecipitation from cell lysates was performed as described (10Holt S.E. Aisner D.L. Baur J. Tesmer V.M. Dy M. Ouellette M. Trager J.B. Morin G.B. Toft D.O. Shay J.W. Wright W.E. White M.A. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 817-826Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Cells were suspended in lysis buffer (0.01% Nonidet P-40, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 50 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 20% glycerol plus protease inhibitor (CompleteMini EDTA-free; Roche Molecular Biochemicals)) and then sonicated at 50 J/watt-s for three 5-s pulses. Lysates were spun at 13,000 rpm for 15 min, and the resulting supernatants were used for immunoprecipitation. Approximately 10 μg of each antibody was precoupled to 20 μl of 50% slurry of protein A/G+-agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) by incubating for 1 h at 4 °C with constant rotation. Antibody-coated beads were washed three times with lysis buffer prior to use in immunoprecipitation reactions. Lysates corresponding to 500,000 cells in 5% bovine serum albumin were added to the antibody beads and rotated for 1 h at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitations were then washed four times with the lysis buffer (350 μl for 10 min with rotation at 4 °C). The agarose bead pellets were resuspended in a final volume of 25 μl with lysis buffer, and aliquots were removed for TRAP assays. For immunoblotting assays after immunoprecipitation, 5 μl of agarose beads was heated at 80 °C for 10 min in SDS sample buffer (boiling in SDS sample buffer caused most of the hTERT protein to remain at the origin, presumably because of aggregative precipitation). The agarose beads were removed by brief centrifugation, and the supernatant was loaded immediately on SDS-PAGE gel (7.5%). For immunoprecipitation from in vitro reactions, ∼10 μg of each antibody was precoupled to 20 μl of 50% slurry of protein A/G+-agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) by incubating for 1 h at 4 °C with constant rotation. Antibody-coated beads were washed three times with lysis buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 20% glycerol, 100 mm NaCl, 0.2 mm EGTA, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and 0.1% bovine serum albumin) prior to use in immunoprecipitation reactions. Two microliters of the in vitro reconstituted telomerase (for detecting Ku association with telomerase in vitro) or 2 μl of the in vitro synthesized HA-hTERT (for detecting Ku association with hTERT) was mixed with 2 μl of the in vitro synthesized Ku70 and Ku80 and incubated at 30 °C for 30 min to allow binding of Ku to telomerase or hTERT. The mixture was added to 100 μl of lysis buffer and then incubated with antibody-coated beads at 4 °C for an additional hour with constant rotation. Agarose pellets were subsequently washed three times with lysis buffer (350 μl for 10 min with rotation at 4 °C). The agarose bead pellets were resuspended in a final volume of 15 μl with lysis buffer, and aliquots were removed for TRAP assays. To detect precipitated proteins, washed pellets were heated to 80 °C for 10 min in SDS sample buffer, and the beads were removed by brief centrifugation. The supernatant was then subjected to electrophoresis on SDS-PAGE gel (7.5%). Dried gels were exposed to a PhosphorImager screen (Molecular Dynamics) for 24 h. The human lung carcinoma cell line H1299 is telomerase-positive. To test whether Ku associates with telomerase in vivo, we used monoclonal antibodies against Ku70 and Ku80 to pull down telomerase from H1299 cell extracts. Following immunoprecipitation, the precipitates were subjected to TRAP analysis. As shown in Fig.1 A, Ku70 and Ku80 monoclonal antibodies (α-Ku70 (N3H10); see lane 7 and α-Ku80 (Ab-7); see lane 10) precipitated telomerase activity, measured as TRAP activity, similar to an hTERT antibody, indicating that Ku70 and Ku80 may associate with telomerase in vivo. An antibody to p23, which has been shown to associate with telomerase (10Holt S.E. Aisner D.L. Baur J. Tesmer V.M. Dy M. Ouellette M. Trager J.B. Morin G.B. Toft D.O. Shay J.W. Wright W.E. White M.A. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 817-826Google Scholar), was used as a positive control (Fig. 1 A, lane 11). Neither mouse IgG nor control antibodies to ribosomal release factor (RF) precipitated telomerase (Fig. 1 A, lanes 4 and 6). Other anti-Ku antibodies, α-Ku70 (Ab-5) and α-Ku80 (Ab-2), were unable to immunoprecipitate telomerase from H1299 cell extracts (Fig.1 A, lanes 8 and 9). Immunoprecipitation followed by immunoblotting analyses showed that Ab-5 (an antibody that does not associate with telomerase) and N3H10 (an antibody that does associate with telomerase) precipitated Ku70 equally (Fig. 1 B), and Ab-2 and Ab-7 precipitated Ku80 equally (data not shown). This suggests that if the interaction with telomerase in cell extracts is because of nonspecific attachment of the very abundant Ku proteins (45Mimori T. Akizuki M. Yamagata H. Inada S. Yoshida S. Homma M. J. Clin. Invest. 1981; 68: 611-620Google Scholar), it is localized to specific domains that are blocked by the Ab-5 antibody of Ku70 and the Ab-2 antibody to Ku80. Ku is essential for human somatic tissue culture cells, and Ku−/− cells undergo massive apoptosis after limited rounds of cell divisions (42Li G. Nelsen C. Hendrickson E.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 832-837Google Scholar). The human colon cancer cell HCT116 derivative with a targeted disruption of one copy of Ku80 contains only 20–50% as much Ku80 and Ku70 protein as the parental wild-type cells (42Li G. Nelsen C. Hendrickson E.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 832-837Google Scholar) (Fig. 1 C). To explore the possibility that the anti-Ku70 and anti-Ku80 antibodies may bind nonspecifically to telomerase, we first tested whether the anti-Ku70 and anti-Ku80 antibodies precipitated less telomerase activity from the Ku80 heterozygous cells. As shown in Fig.1 D, the amount of telomerase activity precipitated by anti-Ku70 (N3H10) and anti-Ku80 (Ab-7) antibodies was reduced dramatically in Ku80 heterozygous cells compared with wild-type parental cells, indicating that the association of Ku with telomerase is likely to be specific. We then tested whether anti-hTERT antibody could immunoprecipitate Ku proteins. Immunoprecipitation followed by immunoblotting analysis revealed that polyclonal anti-hTERT antibody precipitated Ku70 and Ku80 (Fig. 1 E) but did not precipitate other abundant proteins such as ERK-1 (46Cobb M.H. Hepler J.E. Cheng M. Robbins D. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1994; 5: 261-268Google Scholar) and actin (Fig. 1 E). Meanwhile, neither Ku70 nor Ku80 antibody precipitated ERK-1 or actin (Fig.1 E). This adds additional evidence that the association of Ku with telomerase is specific. We then tested whether Ku70 and Ku80 associate with telomerase in telomerase immortalized cells. As shown in Fig.2, antibodies specific to Ku70 and Ku80 proteins precipitated human telomerase activity in BJ fibroblasts overexpressing hTERT ectopically. Therefore, Ku70 and Ku80 associate with telomerase in both cancer cells and hTERT-expressing normal diploid cells. DNA-PKcs, the catalytic subunit of DNA-dependent protein kinase, functions together with Ku, the regulatory subunit of DNA-dependent protein kinase, in DNA double-strand break repair (35Tuteja R. Tuteja N. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2000; 35: 1-33Google Scholar). To determine whether DNA-PKcs is essential for the association of Ku70/80 (presumably as the Ku heterodimer) with human telomerase, we used the human glioma cell line MO59J, which lacks DNA-PKcs but contains a normal Ku protein level (43Lees-Miller S.P. Godbout R. Chan D.W. Weinfeld M. Day III, R.S. Barron G.M. Allalunis-Turner J. Science. 1995; 267: 1183-1185Google Scholar) in the immunoprecipitation assay. Despite the absence of DNA-PKcs, antibodies specific to Ku70 and Ku80 still precipitated telomerase activity (Fig. 3). Therefore, the DNA-PKcs subunit is not essential for the association of Ku with telomerase. Telomerase activity was reconstituted in an RRL using in vitrotranscribed hTR and in vitro transcribed and translated HA-tagged hTERT (10Holt S.E. Aisner D.L. Baur J. Tesmer V.M. Dy M. Ouellette M. Trager J.B. Morin G.B. Toft D.O. Shay J.W. Wright W.E. White M.A. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 817-826Google Scholar). Ku70 and Ku80 proteins were also in vitro transcribed and translated in RRL. As shown in Fig.4, α-Ku70 (N3H10) and α-Ku80 (Ab-7) precipitated telomerase activity whereas α-Ku70 (Ab-5) and α-Ku80 (Ab-2) did not. This is consistent with the in vivo results (Fig. 1 A). The positive control, an antibody specific to p23, precipitated telomerase (10Holt S.E. Aisner D.L. Baur J. Tesmer V.M. Dy M. Ouellette M. Trager J.B. Morin G.B. Toft D.O. Shay J.W. Wright W.E. White M.A. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 817-826Google Scholar) whereas an irrelevant antibody to translation release factor (α-RF) did not. No telomeric DNA is present in the reconstituted telomerase RRL. The only DNA present in the reconstituted telomerase mixture was the cDNA sequence for HA-tagged hTERT from the in vitrotranscription/translation reaction and the hTR DNA template sequence from the in vitro transcription reaction. Although the Ku70/80 heterodimer associates with telomeric DNA (34Hsu H.L. Gilley D. Blackburn E.H. Chen D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12454-12458Google Scholar), the capability of Ku association with the in vitro reconstituted telomerase establishes that the Ku association with telomerase can be independent of telomeric DNA. To determine whether Ku could associate with the protein component of human telomerase, we mixed in vitro synthesized HA-tagged hTERT, Ku70, and Ku80 proteins to perform immunoprecipitation in the absence of hTR. As shown in Fig. 5, [35S]methionine-labeled HA-tagged hTERT was immunoprecipitated with anti-HA, anti-Ku70 (N3H10), anti-Ku80 (Ab-7), and the positive control anti-p23 (9Mergny J.L. Riou J.F. Mailliet P. Teulade-Fichou M.P. Gilson E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 839-865Google Scholar) but not with the antibodies that failed to immunoprecipitate telomerase activity in vivo(anti-Ku70 (Ab-5) and anti-Ku80 (Ab-2)). Therefore, the association of hTERT with Ku70 and Ku80 did not require the presence of the telomerase template RNA. The relative intensity of the bands in Fig. 5 suggests that the interaction is specific for Ku70/80 heterodimers. Although the intensity of the Ku70 band in the input mixture was greater than that for Ku80, roughly equal amounts of both were co-precipitated by the anti-HA and anti-p23 antibodies. The doublet between Ku80 and Ku70 represents either internal initiation or degradation products of Ku80. Although it is precipitated by Ku80 antibodies, it does not interact with Ku70, because it is not precipitated with Ku70 antibodies. The absence of this doublet from the anti-HA and anti-p23 precipitates further supports the conclusion that hTERT associates specifically with Ku70/Ku80 heterodimers. The lower intensity of the Ku70/Ku80 bands in the anti-HA and anti-p23 precipitates likely reflects the dilution of labeled Ku70/80 with abundant unlabeled Ku70/80 present in the reticulocyte lysate (data not shown). The inability of anti-Ku70 Ab-5 and anti-Ku80 Ab-2 to precipitate hTERT is consistent with their inability to precipitate telomerase in vivo and in vitro, indicating Ab-5 and Ab-2 interfere with the ability of Ku to associate with hTERT. In this report, we present evidence showing a physical association of the Ku heterodimer with telomerase. The association of Ku with telomerase can be mediated through its association with the telomerase catalytic subunit hTERT. This association is independent of the presence of telomeric DNA and does not require DNA-PKcs. This finding is consistent with previous reports that DNA-PKcs is not required for localization of Ku to telomeric DNA (34Hsu H.L. Gilley D. Blackburn E.H. Chen D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12454-12458Google Scholar). In yeast, the RNA component of telomerase, TLC1, genetically interacts with Ku telomerically bound (47Peterson S.E. Stellwagen A.E. Diede S.J. Singer M.S. Haimberger Z.W. Johnson C.O. Tzoneva M. Gottschling D.E. Nat. Genet. 2001; 27: 64-67Google Scholar). We observed that human Ku associated with the catalytic subunit of telomerase (Fig. 5) in the absence of hTR. However, these results do not exclude the possibility that human Ku may interact with hTR. Alternatively, significant differences may exist between yeast and mammalian telomere regulation (reviewed in Ref.48Goytisolo F.A. Blasco M.A. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 584-591Google Scholar). In yeast, Ku deficiency results in loss of telomeric repeats, loss of telomere clustering, loss of telomeric silencing, and deregulation of the G-strand overhang (31Boulton S.J. Jackson S.P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1819-1828Google Scholar, 33Gravel S. Larrivee M. Labrecque P. Wellinger R.J. Science. 1998; 280: 741-744Google Scholar, 49Boulton S.J. Jackson S.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 4639-4648Google Scholar, 50Laroche T. Martin S.G. Tsai-Pflugfelder M. Gasser S.M. J. Struct. Biol. 2000; 129: 159-174Google Scholar). However, mouse Ku86 deficiency results in elongated telomeres without affecting the G-strand overhang (39Samper E. Goytisolo F.A. Slijepcevic P. van Buul P.P. Blasco M.A. EMBO Rep. 2000; 1: 244-252Google Scholar, 40Espejel S. Franco S. Rodriguez-Perales S. Bouffler S.D. Cigudosa J.C. Blasco M.A. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2207-2219Google Scholar). The yeast Ku interaction with telomeres and/or telomerase may be somewhat different from that of mammalian Ku. Ku plays a role in telomere homeostasis (reviewed in Ref. 35Tuteja R. Tuteja N. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2000; 35: 1-33Google Scholar), but its precise mechanism of action is unclear. Ku mutant mouse cells show a high rate of telomere-telomere fusion events (36Hsu H.L. Gilley D. Galande S.A. Hande M.P. Allen B. Kim S.H. Li G.C. Campisi J. Kohwi-Shigematsu T. Chen D.J. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2807-2812Google Scholar, 38Bailey S.M. Meyne J. Chen D.J. Kurimasa A. Li G.C. Lehnert B.E. Goodwin E.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14899-14904Google Scholar, 39Samper E. Goytisolo F.A. Slijepcevic P. van Buul P.P. Blasco M.A. EMBO Rep. 2000; 1: 244-252Google Scholar), indicating that Ku acts to protect telomere ends from fusion events. This telomere “capping” function for Ku is superficially paradoxical in light of its role elsewhere in promoting non-homologous end joining but probably reflects its role as part of a modified DNA repair complex located at the telomere. Recently, it has been shown that Ku86 deficiency results in telomere elongation in telomerase-positive mice but not in telomerase-negative mice, suggesting Ku is a negative regulator of telomerase (40Espejel S. Franco S. Rodriguez-Perales S. Bouffler S.D. Cigudosa J.C. Blasco M.A. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2207-2219Google Scholar). However, this may reflect other properties of Ku than its properly regulated role at telomeres. Multicellular organisms should actively inhibit telomerase access to double-strand breaks to prevent the addition of telomeric repeats that would interfere with normal double-strand break repair. The end-fusion that occurs in the Ku80−/− mouse implies that telomeres are now being recognized as double-strand breaks and in that context Ku may function to inhibit telomerase activity. However, it may have a different role when a DNA repair complex modified properly (that masks rather than signals a DNA end problem) coordinates with the replication machinery to regulate telomerase activity on telomere during the normal cell cycle. The dual function of Ku associating with both telomere and telomerase suggests a distinct role of Ku at the telomere. Although it protects telomere ends from fusion events, it may also regulate the access of telomerase to telomere DNA ends. Proteins that interact with Ku might contribute to the regulation of telomerase. Telomere-binding proteins, such as TRF1 (23van Steensel B. de Lange T. Nature. 1997; 385: 740-743Google Scholar) and TRF2 (28Smogorzewska A. van Steensel B. Bianchi A. Oelmann S. Schaefer M.R. Schnapp G. de Lange T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1659-1668Google Scholar), have been proposed to regulate telomerase at the mammalian telomere. Overexpression of TRF1 or TRF2 results in progressive shortening of telomere length (23van Steensel B. de Lange T. Nature. 1997; 385: 740-743Google Scholar, 28Smogorzewska A. van Steensel B. Bianchi A. Oelmann S. Schaefer M.R. Schnapp G. de Lange T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1659-1668Google Scholar). TRF1 and TRF2 only bind to double-stranded regions of telomeric DNA (28Smogorzewska A. van Steensel B. Bianchi A. Oelmann S. Schaefer M.R. Schnapp G. de Lange T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1659-1668Google Scholar, 51Griffith J. Bianchi A. de Lange T. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 278: 79-88Google Scholar), and TRF2 is a key component responsible for the formation of the telomeric t-loop (52Griffith J.D. Comeau L. Rosenfield S. Stansel R.M. Bianchi A. Moss H. de Lange T. Cell. 1999; 97: 503-514Google Scholar). However, we found no association of TRF1 or TRF2 with telomerase activity in vivo (data not shown). Interestingly, Ku binds tightly to TRF1 (36Hsu H.L. Gilley D. Galande S.A. Hande M.P. Allen B. Kim S.H. Li G.C. Campisi J. Kohwi-Shigematsu T. Chen D.J. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2807-2812Google Scholar) and TRF2 (37Song K. Jung D. Jung Y. Lee S.G. Lee I. FEBS Lett. 2000; 481: 81-85Google Scholar), and it has been proposed to contribute to t-loop formation. It is possible that the association of telomerase with Ku may trap telomerase at the double-stranded region of telomeric DNA and thus reducing the ability of telomerase to access the exposed 3′ overhang. Although this is the first report demonstrating that Ku associates with hTERT and telomerase, many questions remain on how telomere length is actually regulated by telomere- and telomerase-associated factors. Understanding the factors involved in telomere regulation should lead to a better understanding of cancer and cellular senescence.

Both of these peptides contain the 15 amino acid sequence GCCSYPPCFATNPDC, with the globular (native) isomer having the disulfide connectivity Cys(2–8 and 3–15) and the ribbon isomer having the disulfide connectivity Cys(2–15 and 3–8). The solution structures of the peptides were determined by NMR spectroscopy, and their ability to block the nicotinic acetylcholine receptors on dissociated neurons of the rat parasympathetic ganglia was examined. The ribbon disulfide isomer, although having a less well defined structure, is surprisingly found to have approximately 10 times greater potency than the native peptide.

The main component of the venom of cone snails, carnivorous mollusks from tropical marine environments, is a group of disulfide-rich peptides that act as potent and highly specific antagonists of ion channels and receptors (1Olivera B.M.

The first and second cysteines in α-conotoxins are always adjacent to one another, but the number of residues between the second and third cysteines and between the third and fourth cysteines varies (Fig. 1). Based on the intracysteine loop spacing the toxins are divided into four framework classes, with loop spacings of 3/5, 4/3, 4/6 or 4/7. All of the 3/5 α-conotoxins antagonize muscle nAChRs, whereas the 4/X classes, with the exception of EI, are active against the neuronal nAChRs (TableI). The difference in the functions of the classes is reflected in distinct differences between their sequences and three-dimensional structures. Whereas all of the α-conotoxins feature a central helix flanked by turns, the helix is 310 in 3/5 α-conotoxins and takes an α configuration in members of the 4/X classes.Table IRepresentatives of the α-, ɛ-, ρ-, and χ/λ conotoxin familiesNameSequenceReceptoraM, muscle nicotinic acetylcholine receptor; N, neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor; NET, noradrenaline transporter.DiSbDiS, disulfide connectivity.m/ncm and n refer to the number of residues between the second and third cysteine and between the third and fourth cysteine.FdF, family.Ref.GIECC-NPACGRHYS–C∗M (α1)2βγδG3/5α53Gray W.R.

Open table in a new tab The 3/5 α-conotoxin GI and derivatives thereof have been used recently to examine the cooperative formation of disulfide bonds (18Kaerner A. Rabenstein D.L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5459-5470Google Scholar). GI, and related 3/5 α-conotoxins GII and MI, have been used in studies concerned with determining the effect of changes to the number or connectivity of disulfide bonds on peptide function (19Hashimoto K. Uchida S. Yoshida H. Nishiuchi Y. Sakakibara S. Yukari K. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1985; 118: 351-354Google Scholar, 20Almquist R.G. Kadambi S.R. Yasuda D.M. Weitl F.L. Polgar W.E. Toll L.R. Int. J. Peptide Protein Res. 1989; 34: 455-462Google Scholar, 21Mok K.H. Han K.-H. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 11895-11904Google Scholar). Gehrmann et al. (22Gehrmann J. Alewood P.F. Craik D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 278: 401-415Google Scholar) determined the NMR solution structures of the three possible disulfide bond isomers of GI and found considerable structural variations among them. Whereas the globular form exhibited a single well defined conformation in solution, the ribbon and beads isomers displayed an increasing degree of conformational heterogeneity. The connectivity of the disulfides in the beads isomer so dramatically reduced the stability of the structure that a single superposition of the ensemble of NMR structures was not possible.Zhang and Snyder (23Zhang R. Snyder G.H. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 11343-11348Google Scholar) have shown that the spacings of the cysteines can affect the preferred disulfide connectivity of α-conotoxins. In their study, they oxidized GI and various mutants of GI, including Pro-5 → Ala GI mutants with or without residues Cys-7 and Ala-6 swapped. Oxidation of the GI analogues, in both denaturing and folding solvents, and the subsequent analysis of the resulting isomers by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) revealed that shortening the first loop of the framework from three to two non-cysteine residues resulted in a reversal of the preferences for different isomers. Mutation of the proline to an alanine did not affect the preferences. They concluded that an even number of residues in a loop is preferred over an odd number of residues for loop sizes of fewer than five residues. This conclusion is consistent with earlier studies in which they examined the formation of a single disulfide bond in small peptides containing two cysteines separated by different numbers of amino acid residues (24Zhang R.M. Snyder G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 18472-18479Google Scholar).In general, studies of disulfide bonding in α-conotoxins have been confined to the 3/5 class. It was of interest to examine the effects of disulfide bonding on structure in α-conotoxins from different framework classes because of the significant effects of cysteine spacing on disulfide bonding preferences seen in model systems and the differences in structure and function between the various α-conotoxin classes. Such studies are given further impetus by the fact that new families of conotoxins with alternative disulfide connectivities are now being found. For example a new family of conotoxins that displays the ribbon disulfide connectivity as their native form has been isolated recently (25Sharpe I.A. Gehrmann J. Loughnan M.L. Thomas L. Adams D.A. Atkins A. Palant E. Craik D.J. Adams D.J. Alewood P.F. Lewis R.J. Nat. Neurosci. 2001; 4: 902-907Google Scholar, 26Balaji R.A. Ohtake A. Sato K. Gopalakrishnakone P. Kini R.M. Seow K.T. Bay B.H. J.

Chem. 2000; 275: 32391-32397Google Scholar). These molecules, referred to as χ or λ-conotoxins, are of similar size but exhibit different biological activity, primary sequences, and cysteine spacings to the α-conotoxins (Table I).The observed preference for globular disulfide bond connectivity over the ribbon and beads forms in 3/5 α-conotoxins is consistent with the rules established by Zhang and Snyder (23Zhang R. Snyder G.H. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 11343-11348Google Scholar). By applying the same rules to the 4/X α-conotoxins, it is clear that the globular and ribbon forms would be preferred over the beads isomer. A disulfide bond between adjacent cysteines is energetically unfavorable. The reason for the absolute preference for the globular connectivity over the ribbon connectivity in 4/X α-conotoxins is not obvious from analysis of cysteine spacings. As is shown in TableII, small conotoxins with 4/Xspacings may exhibit either globular or ribbon disulfide bond connectivities in their native forms.Table IILoop sizes of the three possible disulfide bond isomers fo r different framework classes of conotoxinFramework (m/n)3/54/04/24/34/64/7G4:95:55:75:85:115:12R10:36:48:49:412:413:4B0:50:00:20:30:60:7 Open table in a new tab In this paper we report the chemical synthesis and NMR solution structures of the globular (native) and ribbon disulfide bond isomers of a 4/6 α-conotoxin, AuIB (28Luo S. Kulak J.M. Cartier G.E. Jacobsen R.B. Yoshikami D. Olivera B.M. McIntosh J.M. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 8571-8579Google Scholar). We also report the finding that the AuIB ribbon isomer has 10-fold greater activity in dissociated neurons of rat parasympathetic ganglia than native AuIB, and we consider this in light of the structural data. Although some studies have looked at the function of α-conotoxins with altered numbers or arrangements of disulfide bonds, none of these studies included members of the 4/6 or 4/7 classes (19Hashimoto K. Uchida S. Yoshida H. Nishiuchi Y. Sakakibara S. Yukari K. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1985; 118: 351-354Google Scholar, 20Almquist R.G. Kadambi S.R. Yasuda D.M. Weitl F.L. Polgar W.E. Toll L.R. Int. J.

In those classes the reason for the preference for globular connectivity over ribbon connectivity is unclear. In addition, although activity of some α-conotoxins has been increased through mutation of specific residues, there have been no previous reports of an increase in biological activity as a result of altering disulfide bond connectivity from native.DISCUSSIONIn the current study, we have synthesized and have determined the three-dimensional solution structures of the ribbon and native forms of α-conotoxin AuIB. Native α-conotoxin AuIB features an α-helical region from Tyr-5 to Asn-12 that is flanked by turns, whereas in the ribbon form the helical nature of AuIB is lost. We have also investigated the potency of the native and ribbon AuIB peptides as antagonists of the nAChRs present in rat parasympathetic neurons and have made the surprising finding that the ribbon isomer is approximately 10 times more potent at this site than native AuIB.The consensus features of the native AuIB structure described here are similar to those in a recently reported structure (17Cho J.-H. Mok K.H. Olivera B.M. McIntosh J.M. Park K.-H. Han K.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8680-8685Google Scholar), with the α-helical region spanning the same residues in both. The two structures are virtually identical in the first loop, but there are some minor changes, over residues 12–14, in the second loop. Comparison of the NOE and angle restraints used in calculation of the two AuIB structures identifies some differences that may explain this structural change. The use of 750 MHz NMR data in our study allowed us to include more medium and long range NOE restraints in the structure calculations than the previous study, which used 600 MHz NMR data. In particular, we included 50 medium and long range NOEs, and the other study included 32 (although they stated 38 in the paper there were 32 in the deposited restraints). Twenty of these NOE restraints were identical, and many of the other restraints although not identical were derived from interactions between the same amino acid residues. The Asn-12 χ1 angle was restrained in our structure but not in the Choet al. (17Cho J.-H. Mok K.H. Olivera B.M. McIntosh J.M. Park K.-H. Han K.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8680-8685Google Scholar) structure. In addition, the Cho et al. (17Cho J.-H. Mok K.H. Olivera B.M. McIntosh J.M. Park K.-H. Han K.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8680-8685Google Scholar) structure included NOEs between Asn-12 and Cys-15 and between Cys-8 and Thr-11 that were not observed in our spectra. We included NOEs between Phe-9 and Thr-11, Asp-14, and Cys-15 that were not observed by Cho et al. (17Cho J.-H. Mok K.H. Olivera B.M. McIntosh J.M. Park K.-H. Han K.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8680-8685Google Scholar). These restraint differences explain the observed structural differences, but the origin of the restraint differences is not clear as similar experimental conditions were used. The major difference was that they used a peptide concentration of 6 mm whereas we used 2 mm.AuIB is a member of the 4/6 family of α-conotoxins, and because it is the only member of this class for which structural information is available, it was of interest to compare its structure with members of other framework classes. Fig. 6b shows that the first loop of AuIB overlays well with the representative 4/7 α-conotoxin PnIB. Indeed AuIB features the α-helix that is typical of the 4/7 class. The only significant difference between the structure of AuIB and α-conotoxins from the 4/7 class is that the second loop is tighter in AuIB due to the smaller loop size. The 4/6 α-conotoxin AuIB also overlays well with the 4/3 α-conotoxin ImI over the first loop but exhibits large structural differences from ImI in the second loop (not shown).In structures of the 4/7 α-conotoxins determined by x-ray crystallography, PnIA, PnIB, and EpI, a region of 310 helix is observed N-terminal to the α-helix (7Hu S. Gehrmann J. Alewood P.F. Craik D.J. Martin J.L. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11323-11330Google Scholar, 8Hu S. Gehrmann J. Guddat L.W. Alewood P.F. Craik D.J. Martin J.L.

There are no solution structures reported for these molecules, but ImI has the same first loop as EpI, and four independent solution structures of ImI have been reported. An N-terminal 310 helical motif is reported in just one of the four ImI NMR structures (16Rogers J.P. Luginbuhl P. Shen G.S. McCabe R.T. Stevens R.C. Wemmer D.E. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 3874-3882Google Scholar), and no other NMR structures of α-conotoxins report this element of secondary structure (9Shon K. Koerber S.C. Ricier J.E. Olivera B.M. McIntosh J.M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 15693-15700Google Scholar, 11Hill J.M. Oomen C.J. Miranda L.P. Bingham J. Alewood P.F. Craik D.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15621-15630Google Scholar, 12Franco A. Mari F. Lett.

Mok K.H. Olivera B.M. McIntosh J.M. Park K.-H. Han K.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8680-8685Google Scholar). In the structure described here a 310helix is detected in 6 of 20 AuIB structures. It appears that the 310 helix is a nascent element of structure that may be stabilized as the peptides are crystallized.The general similarity in the backbone fold of the 4/X α-conotoxins suggests that an understanding of their varying specificities requires a more detailed examination of the surface properties of the molecules. Fig. 8 shows surface representations of AuIB and of the 4/7 α-conotoxins PnIA, MII, and EpI. An initial comparison of the surface properties of AuIB and PnIA shows that they are quite similar. These peptides, however, show different specificity, binding to α3β4 and α3β2 receptor subtypes, respectively. Both AuIA and AuIC bind to the α3β4 receptor but with less potency than AuIB. They differ from AuIB in having an additional residue in the second loop, Tyr-15, and by having a Ser in position 13 rather than a Pro. Tyr-15 in PnIA is therefore probably not the factor that prevents PnIA from binding to the α3β4 receptor. A closer examination of the surface properties of AuIB and PnIA shows that the distinct large hydrophobic surface in AuIB is smaller and is encroached upon by the nearby polar residues Asn-11 and Cys-16 in PnIA to a greater degree than occurs for the corresponding residues in AuIB. The hydrophobic patch in MII, another α3β2-specific α-conotoxin, is also smaller than in AuIB and encroached upon by polar and charged residues. In EpI, which binds to both α3β4 and α3β2 receptors, the hydrophobic residues form a ridge that protrudes from the surrounding polar and charged residues. Perhaps then the hydrophobic patch in AuIB is important in determining specificity for the β4 subunit over the β2 subunit. EpI may be able to bind to the α3β4 receptor as the ridge of hydrophobic residues are raised above the surrounding polar and charged residues and may be able to interact. There is also the possibility that EpI contacts different residues in the α3β4 receptor than AuIB. This was found to be the case for ImI and PnIA binding to the α7 receptor.Figure 8Solvent-accessible surfaces of AuIB (a), PnIA (8Hu S. Gehrmann J. Guddat L.W. Alewood P.F. Craik D.J. Martin J.L.

This was not found to be the case in our structure of native AuIB, and we therefore believe that a change in the position of Asp-14 in AuIB relative to where it lies in AuIA and AuIC is not likely to be the cause of the observed increased activity in AuIB over AuIA and AuIC. We cannot, however, rule this out because Asp-14 may be in a different position in AuIA and AuIC than it is in PnIA due to the replacement of the Pro-13 in PnIA with a Ser in that position in AuIA and AuIC.Our NMR studies show that a decrease in structural homogeneity occurs when the connectivities of the disulfide bonds of AuIB are changed from their native form. The disulfide bonds in the ribbon isomer brace the peptide to some extent but not as tightly as in the native isomer. Comparison of the structures shows that the ribbon structure is largely unchanged from the native structure in the first loop of the molecule (Fig. 6). The second loop is very different, being looser than the corresponding loop in the native peptide. This structure is reminiscent of ImI, shown in Fig. 6c, where the first loop is identical to members of the 4/7 family but the second loop is significantly altered (13Gehrmann J. Daly N.L. Alewood P.F. Craik D.J. J. Med. Chem. 1999; 42: 2364-2372Google Scholar).The reduction in structural homogeneity that results from altering the disulfide connectivity from the globular to ribbon form provides an insight into the role of the disulfide bonds in defining the structure. The trend in backbone atom pairwise RMSDs between the native and ribbon forms of AuIB is similar to that seen for the native and ribbon forms of GI. In both cases the ribbon isomer is less precisely defined (i.e. has higher RMSD values) than the respective native peptide. Increases in RMSD values can result either from a lack of sufficient NOE or dihedral angle restraints or from inherent flexibility. Based on the trends in slow exchange amide protons and temperature coefficients, it appears that the latter is the more likely explanation and that the large RMSD for the ribbon isomer of AuIB reflects a high degree of flexibility in this structure. Thus, the disulfide bonds appear to play a role both in influencing the final shape of the molecule and its dynamic flexibility.In the case of GI, the ribbon connectivity resulted in a structure that, although relatively well defined, was different from that of the native structure. The inactivity of the ribbon isomer of GI was attributed to its non-native structure and to only a moderate increase in structural flexibility over the native form (22Gehrmann J. Alewood P.F. Craik D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 278: 401-415Google Scholar). That was presumed to prevent it from adopting the fold required for binding to the muscle nAChR. It is interesting to note that the ribbon isomer of AuIB is a potent antagonist of nAChRs in dissociated neurons of rat parasympathetic ganglia. The ability of the AuIB ribbon isomer to bind to the neuronal nAChR may reflect greater flexibility in this peptide, as compared with the GI ribbon isomer, allowing it to adopt a conformation that is capable of binding. The greater flexibility of the ribbon isomer of AuIB is reflected not only in the higher RMSD than GI but also in the fact that it has no slowly exchanging protons at all, whereas Ala-6 is slowly exchanging in the GI ribbon isomer.A further understanding of the reasons for the activity of the ribbon isomer would be assisted by mutagenesis studies. There are currently no extensive mutagenesis data available in AuIB analogues, but some insight into residues important for binding can be obtained from a comparison of the structure of AuIB and the structure activity relationship data of related α-conotoxins. Residues in PnIB and ImI that interact with the α7 receptor have been identified (50Quiram P.A. Sine S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11007-11011Google Scholar, 51Quiram P.A. Jones J.J. Sine S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19517-19524Google Scholar, 52Quiram P.A. McIntosh J.M. Sine S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4889-4896Google Scholar). Whereas AuIB binds to the α3β4 receptor rather than the α7 receptor, it is interesting to note that for both PnIB and ImI two of the important residues for binding are on the first loop and one is in the second loop. All of the important residues are in the central region of the peptides, corresponding to the helical region. In the ribbon isomer of AuIB the first loop is essentially unchanged from that in the native. If the suggestion that the residues responsible for the interaction of AuIB with the α3β4 receptor are in similar positions to the residues in PnIB and ImI that interact with the α7 receptor is correct, then binding of ribbon AuIB to the receptor is logical. Residues in the first loop are essentially in the same positions relative to one another as they are in the native isomer. The lack of activity in the GI ribbon isomer and the activity of the AuIB ribbon isomer may also reflect differences in the tolerance of the neuronal and muscle nAChR-binding sites to different antagonist conformations.It is interesting that despite the apparent flexibility of the ribbon isomer of AuIB, it is more active than the native isomer. It appears that once bound, the ribbon isomer is able to have a highly complementary fit with the receptor site.This study shows that α-conotoxin function can, in the case of AuIB, be increased through changing the disulfide connectivity to a non-native form. This raises the question as to why the ribbon form is not selected over the globular form in the native venom. Altho"
https://openalex.org/W2137963069,"The leukocyte integrin αMβ2 is a highly promiscuous leukocyte receptor capable of binding a multitude of unrelated ligands. To understand the molecular basis for the broad ligand recognition of αMβ2, the inter-integrin chimera was created. In the chimeric integrin, the βd-α5 loop-α5 helix segment comprised of residues Lys245–Arg261 from the αMI domain of αMβ2 was inserted into the framework of αLβ2. The construct was expressed in HEK 293 cells, and the ability of generated cells to adhere to fibrinogen and its derivatives was characterized first. Grafting the αM(Lys245–Arg261) sequence converted αLβ2 into a fibrinogen-binding protein capable of mediating efficient and specific adhesion similar to that of wild-type αMβ2. Verifying a switch in the binding specificity of αLβ2, the chimeric receptor became competent to support cell migration to fibrinogen. Mutations at positions Phe246, Asp254, and Pro257 within Lys245–Arg261 of αMβ2 produced significant decreases in cell adhesion, illustrating the critical role of these residues in ligand binding. The insertion of αM(Lys245–Arg261) imparted to the chimeric integrin the ability to recognize many typical αMβ2 protein ligands. Furthermore, cells expressing the chimeric receptor, but not αLβ2, were able to stick to uncoated plastic, which represents the hallmark of wild-type αMβ2. These results suggest that αM(Lys245–Arg261) serves as a consensus binding site for interaction with a variety of distinct molecules and, thus, may define the degenerate recognition properties inherent to αMβ2. The leukocyte integrin αMβ2 is a highly promiscuous leukocyte receptor capable of binding a multitude of unrelated ligands. To understand the molecular basis for the broad ligand recognition of αMβ2, the inter-integrin chimera was created. In the chimeric integrin, the βd-α5 loop-α5 helix segment comprised of residues Lys245–Arg261 from the αMI domain of αMβ2 was inserted into the framework of αLβ2. The construct was expressed in HEK 293 cells, and the ability of generated cells to adhere to fibrinogen and its derivatives was characterized first. Grafting the αM(Lys245–Arg261) sequence converted αLβ2 into a fibrinogen-binding protein capable of mediating efficient and specific adhesion similar to that of wild-type αMβ2. Verifying a switch in the binding specificity of αLβ2, the chimeric receptor became competent to support cell migration to fibrinogen. Mutations at positions Phe246, Asp254, and Pro257 within Lys245–Arg261 of αMβ2 produced significant decreases in cell adhesion, illustrating the critical role of these residues in ligand binding. The insertion of αM(Lys245–Arg261) imparted to the chimeric integrin the ability to recognize many typical αMβ2 protein ligands. Furthermore, cells expressing the chimeric receptor, but not αLβ2, were able to stick to uncoated plastic, which represents the hallmark of wild-type αMβ2. These results suggest that αM(Lys245–Arg261) serves as a consensus binding site for interaction with a variety of distinct molecules and, thus, may define the degenerate recognition properties inherent to αMβ2. The integrin αMβ2 (CD11b/CD18, Mac-1) is the major receptor expressed primarily on the surface of phagocytic leukocytes such as neutrophils and monocytes and mediates critical adhesive reactions during the inflammatory responses. Numerous studies have shown that αMβ2 contributes to all steps of neutrophil trafficking, i.e. firm adhesion of neutrophils to the surface of activated endothelial cells, subsequent transmigration of adherent cells through the endothelium, and migration of leukocytes through the extracellular matrix to the site of inflammation (1Kishimoto T.K. Baldwin E.T. Anderson D.C. Inflammation: Basic Principles and Clinical Correlates. 3rd Ed. Lippincott Williams and Wilkins, Philadelphia1999Google Scholar). In addition, evaluation of neutrophil functions in αMβ2-deficient mice provided direct evidence that αMβ2 also mediates phagocytosis of opsonized particles, homotypic aggregation, and adhesion-dependent respiratory burst and degranulation (2Lu H.

Von Andrian U.H. Arnaout M.A. Mayadas T.N. Immunity. 1996; 5: 653-666Google Scholar). Complexity of the αMβ2 functions arises from its ability to recognize numerous ligands. αMβ2 is the most promiscuous member of the integrin family of adhesion receptors. To date, more than 30 protein and non-protein molecules have been reported to bind αMβ2. Ligands with characterized functions include intercellular adhesion molecules 1, 2, and 3 (4Gahmberg C.G.

In addition, αMβ2 binds many extracellular matrix proteins, such as fibronectin, laminin, collagens, vitronectin, thrombospondin, Cyr61, and connective tissue growth factor (14Davis G.E. Exp.

Blood. 2002; 99: 4457-4465Google Scholar). αMβ2 has also been reported to serve as a receptor for many pathogens such as Candida albicans (21Forsyth C.B. Mathews H.L. Cell. Immunol. 1996; 170: 91-100Google Scholar),Leishmania gp63 (22Russell D.G. Wright S.D. J. Exp. Med. 1988; 168: 279-292Google Scholar), and Bordetella pertussis(23Relman D. Tuomanen E. Fialkov S. Golenbock D.T. Saukkonen K. Wright S.D. Cell. 1990; 61: 1375-1382Google Scholar). Another distinction of αMβ2 is its ability to bind a variety of structurally diverse molecules with unrelated functions. The extravagant repertoire of αMβ2 ligands includes keyhole limpet hemocyanin (24Shappell S.B. Toman C. Anderson D.C. Taylor A.A. Entman M.L. Smith C.W. J. Immunol. 1990; 144: 2702-2711Google Scholar), elastase (25Cai T.Q. Wright S.D. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 1213-1223Google Scholar), myeloperoxidase (26Johansson M.W. Patarroyo M. Oberg F. Siegbahn A. Nilsson K. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 1133-1139Google Scholar), catalase (14Davis G.E. Exp. Cell Res. 1992; 200: 242-252Google Scholar), transferrin (14Davis G.E. Exp.

Cell Res. 1992; 200: 242-252Google Scholar), bovine serum albumin (27Frieser M. Hallmann R. Johansson S. Vestweber D. Goodman S.L. Sorokin L. Eur. J. Immunol. 1996; 26: 3127-3136Google Scholar), and ovalbumin (14Davis G.E. Exp. Cell Res. 1992; 200: 242-252Google Scholar). At the other extreme, αMβ2 is able to bind non-protein ligands, such as heparin (28Diamond M.S. Alon R. Parkos C.A. Quinn M.T. Springer T.A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 1473-1482Google Scholar), β-glucan (29Thornton B.P. Vetvicka V. Pitman M. Goldman R.C. Ross G.D. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 1235-1246Google Scholar), and non-coated plastic (27Frieser M. Hallmann R. Johansson S. Vestweber D. Goodman S.L. Sorokin L. Eur. J. Immunol. 1996; 26: 3127-3136Google Scholar). Broad binding specificity exhibited by αMβ2is not shared by the related leukocyte integrin αLβ2 even though these two integrins share some overlapping functional properties. Nonetheless, αLβ2 binds only intercellular adhesion molecules (4Gahmberg C.G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 643-650Google Scholar). The molecular basis for such a broad αMβ2 substrate recognition is not known. Likewise, the physiological significance of the degenerate recognition properties of αMβ2 and the mechanisms of their regulation are not understood. Binding of many ligands, including Fg (30Diamond M.S. Garcia-Aguilar J. Bickford J.K. Corbı́ A.L. Springer T.A. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 1031-1043Google Scholar), fibronectin, 2Lishko, V.

Springer T.A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 1473-1482Google Scholar), is mediated through the αMI domain, a ∼24-kDa subdomain located close to the NH2 terminus of the αM subunit. These data suggest that the αMI domain may be primarily responsible for binding of various ligands and, thus, contain sequences and/or structural information that allows αMβ2 to exhibit promiscuity in ligand binding. The molecular requirements for αMβ2 binding to several ligands, including NIF (35Zhang L. Plow E.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17558-17564Google Scholar), iC3b (36McGuire S.L. Bajt M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25866-25871Google Scholar, 37Zhang L. Plow E.F. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8064-8071Google Scholar), and Fg (38Yakubenko V.P. Solovjov D.A. Zhang L. Yee V.C. Plow E.F. Ugarova T.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 275: 13995-14003Google Scholar), were characterized, and critical amino acid residues in the αMI domain that contribute to binding were identified. Previous studies of αMβ2-ligand interactions emphasized the differences in binding of various ligands to the αMI domain. It was proposed that overlapping, but not identical, binding sites in the αMI domain are involved in ligand binding (39Zhang L. Plow E.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18211-18216Google Scholar) and that a mosaic of different residues is responsible for selective binding of distinct ligands (40Ustinov V.A. Plow E.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18769-18776Google Scholar). It is noteworthy that mutations of residues in one particular region of the αMI domain, the αM(Lys245–Arg261) sequence, which forms a loop βd-α5 and an adjacent helix α5 in the crystal structure (41Lee J.-O. Rieu P. Arnaout M.A. Liddington R. Cell. 1995; 80: 631-638Google Scholar), invariably resulted in the decreased binding of ligands tested (35Zhang L. Plow E.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17558-17564Google Scholar, 36McGuire S.L. Bajt M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25866-25871Google Scholar, 38Yakubenko V.P. Solovjov D.A. Zhang L. Yee V.C. Plow E.F. Ugarova T.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 275: 13995-14003Google Scholar, 40Ustinov V.A. Plow E.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18769-18776Google Scholar), suggesting that this sequence may be a common recognition site. More recently, we have shown that mutations in this region impaired the binding of the recombinant αMI domain to the Fg recognition peptide γ-(383–395) (P2-C) (38Yakubenko V.P. Solovjov D.A. Zhang L. Yee V.C. Plow E.F. Ugarova T.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 275: 13995-14003Google Scholar). Conversely, grafting αM(Lys245–Arg261) in the recombinant αLI domain transformed it into a P2-C-binding protein. In this study, we have engineered a chimeric integrin in which αM(Lys245–Arg261) was inserted into the framework of αLβ2 to clarify the role of this sequence in binding of Fg and of other ligands. We have demonstrated that this modification induced a switch in the ligand binding specificity of αLβ2. Conversion of αLβ2 into an integrin capable of mediating adhesion to Fg was verified by the ability of the chimeric receptor to support cell migration to Fg. In addition, to gain an understanding of the molecular basis for αMβ2 promiscuity in ligand binding we have tested adhesion of the modified receptor to different ligands. Based on the acquired capacity of the chimeric integrin to recognize typical αMβ2 ligands, we suggest that the αM(Lys245–Arg261) may be a consensus binding site in αMβ2 that interacts with diverse ligands. Human Fg was obtained from Enzyme Research Laboratories (South Bend, IN). The D100 (Mr 100,000) fragment of Fg was prepared by digestion of Fg with plasmin as described (42Ugarova T.P. Budzynski A.Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13687-13693Google Scholar). Fibronectin was isolated from fresh human blood by gelatin-agarose affinity chromatography (43Vuento M. Vahery A. Biochem. J. 1979; 183: 331-337Google Scholar). Ovalbumin and BSA were purchased from Sigma, and keyhole limpet hemocyanin was from Calbiochem-Novabiochem. Recombinant Cyr61, synthesized in a baculovirus system using Sf9 insect cells, was purified from serum-free conditioned media by chromatography on Sepharose S as described (44Kireeva M.L. Mo F.E. Yang G.P. Lau L.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1326-1334Google Scholar). NIF was a gift from Corvas International (San Diego, CA). The P2-C peptide (TMKIIPFNRLTIG), corresponding to Fg sequence γ-(383–395), was synthesized and purified as described (45Ugarova T.P. Solovjov D.A. Zhang L. Loukinov D.I. Yee V.C. Medved L.V. Plow E.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22519-22527Google Scholar). The hybridoma cell lines producing mAbs 44a (anti-αM) and IB4 (anti-β2) were obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA). The mAbs were purified from their conditioned media using protein A-agarose according to the manufacturer's protocol (Amersham Biosciences). mAb 2LPM19c was obtained from Dako Corp. mAb 1413 (clone R7.1), directed against the αL subunit, and mAb 1965 (clone JB1A), directed against β1 integrins, were from Chemicon International (Temecula, CA). mAb 24 (46), which recognizes the epitope within the I-like domain of the common β2 subunit (47Lu C. Shimaoka M. Zang Q. Takagi J. Springer T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2393-2398Google Scholar) in αMβ2 and αLβ2, was a generous gift from Dr. Nancy Hogg (Imperial Cancer Research Fund, UK). The coding region for the αM integrin subunit was excised from the pCIS2M-αM vector, which was provided by Dr. E. Plow (Cleveland Clinic). The full-length cDNAs of the αLand β2 subunits were cloned from a human Jurkat T lymphoblastoid cell line cDNA library. The library was synthesized from total cellular RNA using SuperScriptII reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) as described previously (48Yakubenko V.P. Lobb R.R. Plow E.F. Ugarova T.P. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 260: 73-84Google Scholar). The full-length cDNAs of αM and αL were cloned into pcDNA3.1/Neo(−) vector, and full-length cDNA of the β2 was cloned into pcDNA3.1/Hygro(−) vector (Invitrogen). Site-directed mutagenesis of the αM subunit was performed using the QuikChangeTM mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, San Diego, CA). The pcDNA3.1/Neo(−) construct containing DNA encoding the full-length αM was modified by site-directed mutagenesis using two mutagenic primers containing the desired mutation as previously described (38Yakubenko V.P. Solovjov D.A. Zhang L. Yee V.C. Plow E.F. Ugarova T.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 275: 13995-14003Google Scholar). To create cDNA for chimeric αL integrin with the inserted αM sequence Lys245–Arg261, pGEX4T vector generated previously for expression of the chimeric αL/αM(Lys245–Arg261)I domain in Escherichia coli was used (38Yakubenko V.P. Solovjov D.A. Zhang L. Yee V.C. Plow E.F. Ugarova T.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 275: 13995-14003Google Scholar). The entire chimeric I domain was inserted into the αL-pcDNA3.1 construct using the inserted ClaI 595 and endogenousBglII 1071 sites. Fig. 1 shows the schematic representation of the generated I domains. The accuracy of DNA sequences for the entire αM, αL, β2, and mutants was verified by sequencing. Human embryonic kidney 293 cells were obtained from the ATCC and maintained in DMEM/F-12 (BioWhittaker, Walkersville, MD) supplemented with 10% FBS, 2 mm glutamine, 15 mm HEPES, 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin, and 0.1 unit/ml penicillin. Cells were stably transfected with pcDNA3.1 plasmids with inserted β2 and wild-type or mutant α using LipofectAMINETM 2000 reagent (Invitrogen). After 48 h at 37 °C in 5% CO2, cells were harvested and cultured in medium with 500 μg/ml G418 (Invitrogen) and 250 μg/ml hygromycin (Invitrogen). After 14 days, surviving cells were collected, sorted, and analyzed using flow cytometry and immunoprecipitation. FACS analyses were performed to assess the expression of receptors on the surface of the cells transfected with wild-type and mutant forms of the αMβ2 and αLβ2 integrins. The cells were incubated with anti-αM mAb 44a, anti-β2 mAb IB4, anti-αL mAb 1413, and the conformation-dependent mAb 24 and analyzed in a FACS Scan ™ (BD Biosciences) as described (38Yakubenko V.P. Solovjov D.A. Zhang L. Yee V.C. Plow E.F. Ugarova T.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 275: 13995-14003Google Scholar). Populations of cells expressing similar amounts of the receptors were selected by fluorescence-activated cell sorting using a BD Biosciences FACS Vantage instrument. The cells (5 × 106) were labeled with 100 μg of Immunopure Sulfo-NHS-LC-Biotin (Pierce) in 200 μl of phosphate-buffered saline for 30 min at 22 °C. The cells were solubilized with a lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mmCaCl2, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 100 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 mm benzamidine) for 30 min at 22 °C. The lysates were incubated with 10 μg of normal mouse IgG (Sigma) and 50 μl of Zysorbin-G (Zymed Laboratories Inc., San-Francisco, CA) for 2 h at 4 °C. After centrifugation, the supernatant was incubated with 10 μg of mAb IB4 (anti-β2) for 2 h at 4 °C. The integrin-mAb complex was captured by incubating with 50 μl of protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) for 2 h at 4 °C. The immunoprecipitated proteins were eluted with SDS-PAGE loading buffer and analyzed by Western blotting. The Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore) were incubated with streptavidin conjugated to horseradish peroxidase and developed using enhanced SuperSignal chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce). For adhesion assays, the 96-well tissue culture plates (Corning Costar, Cambridge, MA) were coated with different concentrations of the P2-C peptide, D100 fragment, Fg, and other protein ligands for 3 h at 37 °C or overnight at 4 °C. Ovalbumin and BSA were denatured by heating at 70 °C for 1 h before immobilization on the plates. The wells were post-coated with 0.5% polyvinyl alcohol for 1 h at 22 °C. The cells expressing wild-type or mutant forms of integrin receptors were labeled with 10 μm calcein AM (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR), and assays were performed as described previously (49Lishko V.K. Yakubenko V.P. Hertzberg K.M. Grieninger G. Ugarova T.P. Blood. 2001; 98: 2448-2455Google Scholar). Cell migration assays were performed under sterile conditions using uncoated Transwell® inserts with a pore size of 8 μmand 6.5 mm in diameter (Corning Costar). The lower chambers contained 600 μl of Fg at 50 μg/ml in DMEM/F-12 medium. Cells were resuspended at a concentration of 3 × 106/ml in DMEM/F-12. 100-μl aliquots of cells were placed in the upper chamber and incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO2 for 8 h. To label cells, calcein AM was added to the lower chamber at 10 μmfinal concentration 2 h before completion of the migration assay. Assays were stopped by removing cells from the upper surface of the polycarbonate membrane by wiping the surface twice with a cotton-tipped applicator. The cells migrating to the bottom of the filter were detected using a CytoFluorII fluorescence plate reader (Applied Biosystems, Farmington, MA). In previous studies, we have demonstrated that Fg recognition peptide P2-C and the D fragment of Fg bind to the Lys245–Arg261 sequence within the recombinant αMI domain (38Yakubenko V.P. Solovjov D.A. Zhang L. Yee V.C. Plow E.F. Ugarova T.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 275: 13995-14003Google Scholar). To verify that αM(Lys245–Arg261) functions as the binding site for P2-C in the context of whole integrin and to test the role of this segment in binding of other αMβ2 ligands, chimeric αL/αM(Lys245–Arg261)β2integrin (designated L/M) was expressed in HEK 293 cells. In this receptor, the 17-residue segment from the αMI domain,245KFGDPLGYEDVIPEADR261, was inserted into the homologous position of αLβ2 (Fig. 1). In addition, the wild-type αMβ2 and αLβ2integrins were expressed to serve as a “positive” cell line that binds Fg and a “negative” cell line that does not bind Fg, respectively. Stable transfectants were established, and cell populations expressing similar levels of αMβ2, αLβ2, and chimeric integrins were selected by cell sorting using anti-αM-specific mAb 44a, anti-β2-specific mAb IB4, and anti-αL mAb 1413 (Fig. 2A). Because αM(Lys245–Arg261) is a short segment and it was grafted into the homologous position of the structurally similar αLI domain, it was unlikely that the structure of the chimeric I domain was perturbed. Nevertheless, to support this assertion experimentally, we assessed the binding of mAb 24 (46), which recognizes a cation-dependent and ligand-competent conformation of the receptor and which was used in previous studies as a sensitive probe of correct folding of αMβ2 and αLβ2in recombinant cells (35Zhang L. Plow E.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17558-17564Google Scholar, 36McGuire S.L. Bajt M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25866-25871Google Scholar). FACS analyses demonstrated that the wild-type and chimeric receptors exhibited a similar capacity to bind mAb 24 (Fig. 2A, lower panel). Cell expression and heterodimer association of the integrins were also evaluated by immunoprecipitation of detergent-lysed surface-labeled cells (Fig. 2B). Anti-β2 mAb IB4 immunoprecipitated both the α and β subunits from cells co-transfected with β2 and the wild-type αM, αL, or chimeric α subunit. Thus, these results indicated that different α subunits were assembled with β2 on the cell surface and that the insertion of the αM(Lys245–Arg261) did not affect heterodimer formation. The cell line expressing L/M integrin was first tested for its ability to adhere to immobilized P2-C, Fg, and the D100 fragment. As shown in Fig. 3A, cells expressing the chimeric integrin demonstrated a dose-dependent and saturable adhesion to P2-C with ∼30% of added cells adherent at the plateau (maximal adhesion). Adhesion of the L/M-expressing cells was similar to that of the wild-type αMβ2-transfected cells (∼35% maximal adhesion) and was significantly higher than that of the wild-type αLβ2-expressing cells (∼10% maximal adhesion). To determine the effect of αM(Lys245–Arg261) grafting on ligand binding properties of the chimeric integrin further, we tested cell adhesion to Fg and the D100 fragment. Adhesion of the L/M-expressing cells to both physiologic ligands was essentially identical to that of the wild-type αMβ2-expressing cells (Fig. 3Bshown for Fg). In particular, adhesion of the L/M-expressing cells to Fg had a concentration-dependent pattern typical for adhesion of wild-type αMβ2-expressing cells (50Ugarova T.P. Yakubenko V.P. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2001; 936: 368-386Google Scholar). In contrast, the αLβ2-mediated adhesion to Fg and D100 was low (2–4%), and adhesion of mock-transfected cells was negligible. Microscopic examination of adherent cells confirmed that many chimera-expressing cells adhered to P2-C. However, the morphology of the cells was somewhat different from that of the wild-type αMβ2-expressing cells (Fig. 4); although the wild-type αMβ2-expressing cells were well spread, the L/M-expressing cells were rounded.Figure 4Microscopic examination of adherent cells. The αMβ2-, αLβ2-, and L/M-expressing cells were allowed to adhere to wells coated with 50 μg/ml P2-C for 30 min at 37 °C, then nonadherent cells were removed, and adherent cells were photographed.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The specificity of the interaction between L/M chimera and P2-C was verified using soluble P2-C and function-blocking mAbs directed against αM and β2 subunits. Adhesion of cells bearing the chimeric integrin to P2-C was inhibited by more than 95% at 200 μg/ml soluble P2-C, similar to that of the wild-type αMβ2-expressing cells (Fig. 5). Also, adhesion of both cell lines was inhibited by mAb IB4 against the common β2 subunit (Fig. 5). In contrast, only the αMβ2-mediated adhesion was efficiently inhibited by anti-αM mAbs 44a and 2LPM19c, whereas the L/M-expressing cells were not sensitive to these mAbs (Fig. 5, shown for mAb 2LPM19c). This is consistent with the data that the epitopes for mAbs 44a and 2LPM19c were localized to the sequences in the αMI domain other than αM(Lys245–Arg261) and that the inhibitory effect of these mAbs on αMβ2-mediated adhesion was likely allosteric (37Zhang L. Plow E.F. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8064-8071Google Scholar). In addition, we have tested the effect of NIF, a high affinity inhibitor of αMβ2-mediated neutrophil functions (7Moyle M. Foster D.L. McGrath D.E. Brown S.M. Laroche Y. De Meutter J. Bogowitz C.A. Fried V.A. Ely J.A. Moyle M. Foster D.L. McGrath D.E. Brown S.M. Laroche Y. De Meutter J. Stanssens P. Bogowitz C.A. Fried V.A. Ely J.A. Soule H.R. Vlasuk G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10008-10015Google Scholar), on adhesion of the L/M-expressing cells to P2-C. Previous studies demonstrated that NIF bound to the αMI domain and efficiently inhibited adhesion of the αMβ2-expressing cells to Fg and its derivatives (39Zhang L. Plow E.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18211-18216Google Scholar, 45Ugarova T.P. Solovjov D.A. Zhang L. Loukinov D.I. Yee V.C. Medved L.V. Plow E.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22519-22527Google Scholar), suggesting that the binding site for Fg and NIF may overlap. However, NIF did not inhibit binding of the D fragment to the αMI domain recognition peptides, αM(Lys245–Tyr252) and αM(Glu253–Arg261) (38Yakubenko V.P. Solovjov D.A. Zhang L. Yee V.C. Plow E.F. Ugarova T.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 275: 13995-14003Google Scholar), indicating that these sequences by themselves are not sufficient to ensure NIF binding. To investigate further the role of the αM(Lys245–Arg261) segment in NIF binding, the cells expressing the chimeric integrins or wild-type αMβ2 were preincubated with NIF and then added to wells coated with P2-C. In confirmation of the previous findings, NIF effectively inhibited adhesion of the wild-type αMβ2-expressing cells to the D100 fragment and P2-C with IC50 values of 0.1 and 0.5 μg/ml, respectively. In contrast, NIF showed no inhibition of adhesion of the L/M-expressing cells to both Fg ligands (not shown). It appears that the binding of the soluble and high affinity ligand NIF is principally different from the binding of low affinity adhesive ligands. In support of this idea, mutations in the β2subunit, which impaired adhesion to protein ligands, did not affect NIF binding (39Zhang L. Plow E.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18211-18216Google Scholar). Taken together, these results demonstrated that grafting the αM(Lys245–Arg261) sequence into αLβ2, which does not bind Fg, conver"

The inhibitory effect of diamide on TH catalytic activity is enhanced significantly by GSH. Treatment of TH with diamide in the presence of [35S]GSH results in the incorporation of35S into the enzyme. The effect of diamide-GSH on TH activity is prevented by dithiothreitol (DTT), as is the binding of [35S]GSH, indicating the formation of a disulfide linkage between GSH and TH protein cysteinyls. Loss of TH catalytic activity caused by diamide-GSH is partially recovered by DTT and glutaredoxin, whereas the disulfide linkage of GSH with TH is completely reversed by both. Treatment of intact PC12 cells with diamide results in a concentration-dependent inhibition of TH activity. Incubation of cells with [35S]cysteine, to label cellular GSH prior to diamide treatment, followed by immunoprecipitation of TH shows that the loss of TH catalytic activity is associated with a DTT-reversible incorporation of [35S]GSH into the enzyme. A combination of matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization/mass spectrometry and liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry was used to identify the sites of S-glutathionylation in TH. Six cysteines (177, 249, 263, 329, 330, and 380) of the seven cysteine residues in TH were confirmed as substrates for modification. Only Cys-311 was notS-glutathionylated. These results establish that TH activity is influenced in a reversible manner byS-glutathionylation and suggest that cellular GSH may regulate dopamine biosynthesis under conditions of oxidative stress or drug-induced toxicity.

Perhaps the most extreme example of such toxicity is that seen in Parkinson's Disease, a neurodegenerative disorder that results over time in the near-total destruction of the nigrostriatal dopamine system. Less extreme examples of toxicity to dopamine nerve endings are displayed by drugs of abuse from the amphetamine class, including methamphetamine and 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (1Gibb J.W. Johnson M. Elayan I. Lim H.K. Matsuda L. Hanson G.R. NIDA Res. Monogr. 1997; 173: 128-145Google Scholar, 2Cadet J.L. Brannock C. Neurochem. Int. 1998; 32: 117-131Google Scholar). Drug-induced damage to DA neurons and the neuropathology associated with Parkinson's Disease are thought to be mediated, at least in part, by reactive oxygen and reactive nitrogen species (3Good P.F. Hsu A. Werner P. Perl D.P. Olanow C.W. J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 1998; 57: 338-342Google Scholar, 4Gutteridge J.M. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1994; 738: 201-213Google Scholar, 5Olanow C.W. Tatton W.G.

The initial cellular response to oxidative stress is often a reduction in the levels of GSH and a corresponding increase of GSSG, the oxidized form of GSH (7Cotgreave I.A. Gerdes R.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 242: 1-9Google Scholar, 8Dringen R. Gutterer J.M. Hirrlinger J. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 275: 4912-4916Google Scholar, 9Slama P. Jabre F. Tron T. Reglier M. FEBS Lett. 2001; 491: 55-58Google Scholar). In the presence of various reactive species, GSH can form disulfide links with protein cysteine residues, a posttranslational modification referred to asS-glutathionylation (10Klatt P. Lamas S. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 4928-4944Google Scholar, 11Thomas J.A. Chai Y.C. Jung C.H. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 233: 385-395Google Scholar, 12Thomas J.A. Poland B. Honzatko R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 319: 1-9Google Scholar). The enzymatic reduction of protein-GSH mixed disulfides is mediated by thioltransferases, and these important enzymes are found in neurons (13Balijepalli S. Tirumalai P.S. Swamy K.V. Boyd M.R. Mieyal J.J. Ravindranath V. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 1170-1178Google Scholar), bacteria (14Holmgren A. Aslund F. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 252: 283-292Google Scholar), and plants (15Yano H. Wong J.H. Lee Y.M. Cho M.J. Buchanan B.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4794-4799Google Scholar). The reversible modification of cysteines by GSH-disulfide linkage is thought to serve a protective function, masking critical protein sulfhydryls from more extensive or irreversible oxidation. Thiolation-dethiolation reactions have been observed in many essential cellular systems including energy and respiratory function (16Cabiscol E. Levine R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

FASEB J. 1999; 13: 1481-1490Google Scholar). Thiolation-dethiolation reactions in neurons are not as well understood as in nonneuronal cells, but evidence is emerging that these processes do occur after oxidative stress or in response to neurotoxicity. For example, metabolic inhibition in neurons leads to enhanced formation of protein-GSH mixed disulfides (24Ehrhart J. Zeevalk G.D. J. Neurochem. 2001; 77: 1496-1507Google Scholar), and transgenic mice overexpressing thioltransferases in brain are protected from ischemia-induced neural damage (25Takagi Y. Mitsui A. Nishiyama A. Nozaki K. Sono H. Gon Y. Hashimoto N. Yodoi J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4131-4136Google Scholar). It also appears that cellular toxins and stressors can target protein sulfhydryl repair enzymes for inhibition (26Starke D.W. Chen Y. Bapna C.P. Lesnefsky E.J. Mieyal J.J. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1997; 23: 373-384Google Scholar, 27Chrestensen C.A. Starke D.W. Mieyal J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26556-26565Google Scholar), leading to a shift in cellular redox balance favoring oxidation. In view of the fact that cellular GSH levels and function are dramatically altered in Parkinson's Disease (28Jenner P. Mov. Disord. 1998; 13: 24-34Google Scholar, 29Owen A.D. Schapira A.H. Jenner P.

Neurochem. 1998; 71: 2112-2122Google Scholar) and are, likewise, compromised by drugs known to damage DA nerves selectively including MPTP (31Ferraro T.N. Golden G.T. DeMattei M. Hare T.A. Fariello R.G. Neuropharmacology. 1986; 25: 1071-1074Google Scholar), 6-hydroxydopamine (32Perumal A.S. Tordzro W.K. Katz M. Jackson-Lewis V. Cooper T.B. Fahn S. Cadet J.L. Brain Res. 1989; 504: 139-141Google Scholar), and the amphetamines (33Harold C. Wallace T. Friedman R. Gudelsky G. Yamamoto B. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2000; 400: 99-102Google Scholar,34Moszczynska A. Turenne S. Kish S.J. Neurosci. Lett. 1998; 255: 49-52Google Scholar), we considered the possibility that S-glutathionylation could influence DA neurochemistry. As there are no disulfides in the native structure of TH (35Goodwill K.E. Sabatier C. Marks C. Raag R. Fitzpatrick P.F. Stevens R.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 578-585Google Scholar), each cysteine is subject to regulation byS-glutathionylation. We report presently that tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), the initial and rate-limiting enzyme in the synthesis of the neurotransmitter dopamine, is modified byS-glutathionylation and this posttranslational modification results in a reduction in TH catalytic function. Tetrahydrobiopterin was obtained from Dr. B. Schircks Laboratories (Jona, Switzerland). Thrombin, pGEX-4T vectors, and protein A-Sepharose beads were purchased from AmershamBiosciences. GSH, GSH-agarose, DTT, cycloheximide, diamide, diethylenetriaminepenta-acetic acid,N-ethylmaleimide, cyanogen bromide (CNBr, as a 5.0m solution in acetonitrile), 4-dimethylaminophenylazophenyl-4′-maleimide (DABMI), porcine gastric pepsin, and α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (CHCA) were purchased from Sigma. Tyrosine L-(ring-3,5-3H), [35S]GSH, [35S]cysteine, and RenaissanceR Western blot Chemiluminescence Reagent Plus were purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. PC12 cells were from ATCC, and all tissue culture media and reagents were purchased from Invitrogen. Recombinant human glutaredoxin (GRx) was obtained from American Diagnostica, Inc. BioMax MR film was from Kodak. A monoclonal antibody against TH was purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals, and horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG was obtained from Cappel/Organon. Guanidine hydrochloride was from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA). C18 ZipTips were purchased from Millipore (Bedford, MA). A Peptide CapTrap for LC/MS/MS was purchased from Michrom Bioresources (Auburn, CA). Acetonitrile (ACN) and trifluoroacetic acid were HPLC grade. All other reagents were of analytical grade from commercial sources. TH was cloned by reverse-transcriptase PCR of rat brain RNA, and its sequence was verified by nucleotide sequencing. The full-length form of TH was ligated in frame into pGEX-4T2 and expressed as a GST fusion protein as previously described (36Kuhn D.M. Sadidi M. Lu X. Kriepke C. Geddes T. Borges C. Watson J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; Google Scholar, 37Kuhn D.M. Aretha C.W. Geddes T.J. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 10289-10294Google Scholar). TH was cleaved from the GST fusion tag by treatment with thrombin. Native TH was purified to homogeneity from cultured PC12 cells as described by Kuhn and Billingsley (38Kuhn D.M. Billingsley M.L. Neurochem. Int. 1987; 11: 463-475Google Scholar). TH protein (3–5 μm, with respect to the 60 kDa monomer) was incubated with varying concentrations of diamide, GSH, or diamide + GSH in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, containing 100 μm DPTA for 15 min at 30 °C. Samples were diluted 1:10 with potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, and then TH catalytic activity was immediately assayed as described by Lerner et al. (39Lerner P. Nose P. Ames M.M. Lovenberg W. Neurochem. Res. 1978; 3: 641-651Google Scholar). Attempts to reverse the effects of diamide ± GSH on TH were carried out by adding DTT or GRx to dialyzed enzyme samples (2 h of dialysis against potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4) after treatment with diamide ± GSH, and incubations were continued for an additional 15–30 min at 30 °C before dilution and assay. Protein was measured using the method of Bradford (40Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Google Scholar). Recombinant or purified PC12 TH was treated exactly as described above for the catalytic assays with the exception that GSH was replaced with [35S]GSH. The enzyme was subjected to non-reducing SDS-PAGE, and proteins were electroblotted to nitrocellulose. Blots were first exposed to film for autoradiography and were subsequently probed with a monoclonal antibody against TH. Immunoreactivity was visualized with the use of an HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody and enhanced chemiluminescence. In some instances, TH samples were treated with DTT or GRx after exposure to diamide + [35S]GSH, followed by SDS-PAGE and blotting to nitrocellulose. PC12 cells were maintained in culture in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 5% fetal calf and 10% inactivated horse serum in an atmosphere of 95% CO2/5% oxygen. When cells reached ∼75% confluence, they were harvested and replated at a density of 50,000 cells/ml in 6-well plates. Cells were washed 3× with Krebs-Ringer phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, and diamide was added directly to this media in varying concentrations. In some experiments, PC12 cells were prepared for metabolic labeling (described below), and the effect of diamide on TH activity was tested. Cells were incubated for 15 min at 37 °C in the presence of diamide, after which they were washed 3× with ice-cold buffer and harvested by scraping. Cells were lysed by sonication in 100 μl of 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.0, and the supernatant fraction from a 15-min centrifugation step at 40,000 × g was used for assays of TH catalytic activity. PC12 cells were cultured as described above and were then prepared for metabolic labeling of cellular GSH with [35S]cysteine as previously described (11Thomas J.A. Chai Y.C. Jung C.H. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 233: 385-395Google Scholar, 20Jahngen-Hodge J. Obin M.S. Gong X. Shang F. Nowell T.R. Gong J. Abasi H. Blumberg J. Taylor A. J. Biol.

Endogenous, low molecular thiols were depleted from PC12 cells by replacing culture media with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium lacking sulfur-containing amino acids and containing 10% dialyzed serum for 16 h at 37 °C. The protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide (50 μg/ml) was added to cells and after 1 h, [35S]cysteine (30 μCi/ml) was added, and incubations continued in the presence of cycloheximide for another 4 h at 37 °C. Cells were washed 3× with Krebs-Ringer phosphate buffer to remove unincorporated isotope, and exposed to 10 mm diamide for 15 min at 37 °C as described above. Cells were next washed 3× with Krebs-Ringer phosphate buffer, harvested, and lysed by sonication. The supernatant fraction from a 15-min centrifugation step at 40,000 × g was split and treated with either 50 mm N-ethylmaleimide (to prevent scrambling of the [35S]GSH) or 25 mm DTT (to remove the [35S]GSH) prior to immunoprecipitation of TH. A polyclonal antibody raised against PC12 TH (38Kuhn D.M. Billingsley M.L. Neurochem. Int. 1987; 11: 463-475Google Scholar) was added to the supernatant fraction (1:1000 dilution of antiserum), and samples were incubated at 4 °C overnight. Immunoprecipitates were adsorbed to protein A-Sepharose at 4 °C for 2 h, washed 3× with 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, and eluted from beads with 10% SDS. Samples were exposed to non-reducing SDS-PAGE and electroblotting as described above. Blots were first exposed to film overnight at room temperature for autoradiography and were subsequently probed with a monoclonal antibody against TH. Immunoreactivity was visualized with the use of an HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody and enhanced chemiluminescence. To determine sites of S-glutathionylation, TH was either subjected to cyanogen bromide cleavage followed by sample clean-up and analysis by MALDI/MS (Cys-329 and Cys-330 status determined in this manner) or cleaved with pepsin and labeled with the chromophoric maleimide DABMI, followed by HPLC then analysis by MALDI/MS and LC/MS/MS. The proteolytic cleavage techniques described below were chosen because of their action at low pH values, which minimizes disulfide exchange. CNBr cleavage of TH was performed to isolate Cys-329 and Cys-330. Twenty micrograms of untreated TH, diamide-treated TH, and diamide + GSH-treated TH were purified after treatment by RP-HPLC. The HPLC system consisted of Waters Alliance 2695 pumps (controlled by a personal computer) in line with a Waters 2487 dual wavelength detector set at 214 nm. Initial chromatographic conditions were set at 15% solvent B (ACN containing 0.1% (v/v) trichloroacetic acid)/85% solvent A (water containing 0.1% (v/v) trichloroacetic acid) over a Vydac C18 (2.1 mm × 150 mm, 3-μm particle size, 300-Å pores) column. Solvent composition was linearly ramped to 90% B over 60 min at 0.2 ml/min. Fractions corresponding to the whole protein were collected and dried in a vacuum system. One hundred twenty-six microliters of 6 m guanidine HCl dissolved in 0.1m HCl was added to each sample, followed by addition of 54 μl of 1.1 m CNBr in ACN. The reaction vessel was overlaid with nitrogen and allowed to react in the dark for 16 h. Excess CNBr and ACN were removed under vacuum, and samples were diluted to 360 μl with water. Half of each sample was removed and made 0.8% (v/v) in trichloroacetic acid. Samples were then cleaned up with a C18 ZipTip and eluted into 2 μl of 0.1% (v/v) trichloroacetic acid in water/ACN (50/50) saturated with CHCA. The elution solution was then spiked with 0.5 pmol each of bradykinin and insulin as internal standards bringing the total volume to 2.5 μl. 0.5 μl was then spotted onto a MALDI plate using the thin-layer spotting technique of Cadene and Chait (42Cadene M. Chait B.T. Anal. Chem. 2000; 72: 5655-5658Google Scholar). Peptic cleavage was carried out to isolate all cysteines other than Cys-329 and Cys-330, the status of which were determined with CNBr cleavage followed with analysis by MALDI/MS(above). Thirty-three μg of untreated TH, diamide-treated TH, and diamide + GSH-treated TH were purified by RP-HPLC as described above and dried under vacuum. Samples were then reconstituted in 165 μl of 6 m guanidine HCl in 10 mm HCl (pH adjusted to 2), 125.4 μl of 10 mm HCl, 33 μl of 1.0 m NaCl in 10 mm HCl, and 6.6 μl of pepsin dissolved in 10 mm HCl at 500 ng/μl and allowed to digest for 16 h at 37 °C. One hundred sixty-five microliters of a 6 mguanidine HCl/0.1 m citrate buffer, pH 5, that had been saturated with ACN and DABMI were added to each sample and allowed to react for 1 h at room temperature. Because the salt concentration was too high to allow for immediate analysis of the digest by MALDI/MS or LC/MS/MS, a preliminary purification was carried out by RP-HPLC. The proteolytic peptides in the digest mixture were purified and separated by microbore RP-HPLC (Vydac C18 column: 1.0 mm × 150 mm, 5-μm particle size, 300-Å pores, 50 μl/min) under a gradient held at 2% solvent B (defined above) for 12 min then ramped to 45% solvent B over 70 min. Half of each fraction was removed and pooled with all other fractions from this preliminary RP-HPLC run, then concentrated for analysis by LC/MS/MS. The remaining half of each fraction was dried under vacuum and reconstituted in 2 μl of the described MALDI matrix solution and spotted as described above. A Voyager DE-STR MALDI-TOF MS (PE Biosystems Inc., Framingham, MA) equipped with a 337-nm laser was used with external standards of bradykinin and bovine pancreatic insulin. LC/MS/MS analysis was carried out on a Waters CapLC system connected to a ThermoFinnigan LCQ Deca ion trap. Duplicates from each sample were injected onto a Peptide CapTrap (Michrom Bioresources), washed for 6 min at 20 μl/min with water/ACN (98/2, v/v) containing 0.1% (v/v) formic acid, separated on a 75-μm × 5-cm ProteoPep C18 PicoFrit column, and analyzed by LC/MS and LC/MS/MS. DABMI-labeled peptides produce a unique set of peaks when analyzed by MALDI/MS due to prompt fragmentation reactions that occur when the laser strikes the sample (e.g. see Fig. 7). This set of peaks allows for easy recognition of DABMI-labeled (i.e. originally free cysteine-containing) peptides in the MALDI mass spectrum without the use of MS/MS and without knowledge of the peptide sequence. A more detailed report on the chemistry and application of DABMI as a tool for protein science will be prepared separately. A mass mapping approach was employed to elucidate the structure of putative cysteine-containing peptides that were recognized through DABMI labeling. Based on the mass of the DABMI-labeled peptides, masses of the corresponding glutathionylated peptides were calculated; hits for these calculated masses (via a search using TurboSequest) were confirmed after analysis by LC/MS/MS. Actual peak assignments in MS/MS spectra were made manually. For a spectrum to be considered a valid hit for a glutathionylated peptide, all peaks with a relative intensity greater than 10% had to be assigned; as it turned out, ∼90% + of all peaks greater than 5% relative intensity were assigned. Assignments also were required to be consistent with fragments expected from a low-energy collision-induced dissociation ion trap mass spectrometer. Several candidate MS/MS spectra were rejected due to failure to meet the above criteria. TH activity is reduced by the highly specific thiol oxidant diamide. Fig. 1 shows that increasing concentrations of diamide cause a slight inhibition of TH between concentrations of 0.1–0.5 mm, but concentrations of 1–5 mm result in ∼30–40% inhibition of catalytic activity. The addition of a constant concentration of GSH (1 mm) to incubations with varying concentrations of diamide substantially enhances the inhibition of TH. For example, GSH increased the inhibition of TH to 34% of control in the presence of 1 mmdiamide, whereas without GSH, diamide reduced TH activity to only 70% of control. Treatment of TH with GSH alone did not have an effect on enzyme activity in concentrations up to 10 mm (data not shown). The effect of diamide, as well as the combination of GSH + diamide, on TH activity was statistically significant (p < 0.05 for each condition, ANOVA). The GSH-induced enhancement of the diamide effect on TH was also statistically significant (p < 0.05, ANOVA). GSH-induced enhancement of the diamide effect on the catalytic activity of TH purified from PC12 cells was the same as observed with recombinant TH (data not shown). The effect of the sulfhydryl-reducing agent DTT on TH inhibition caused by diamide + GSH was tested, and the results are presented in Fig. 2A. When DTT (1 mm) was added to incubations prior to GSH + diamide, the inhibition of TH was completely prevented. DTT also prevents the inhibition of TH caused by diamide alone (data not shown). However, attempts to reverse inhibition of TH caused by GSH + diamide were somewhat less effective. Fig. 2B shows that the addition of DTT (10 mm) to TH after exposure to GSH + diamide partially restores TH catalytic activity. DTT led to the recovery of ∼50% of the lost activity, an effect that was statistically significant (p < 0.05, Bonferonni's test). Neither higher concentrations nor longer incubation times increased the extent to which the inhibition of TH could be reversed by DTT (data not shown). GRx was also tested for the ability to reverse the inhibition of TH caused by diamide + GSH, and the results are presented in Fig. 2B. GRx (1 μm), in the presence of GSH (0.5 mm), caused a significant recovery of TH activity. The recovery of activity caused by GRx was slightly greater in magnitude than that of DTT, reaching ∼60% of control. The effect of GRx + GSH was statistically significant (p < 0.05, Bonferroni's test). Neither GRx nor GSH alone had effects on TH activity. To investigate the mechanism by which GSH enhances TH inhibition under sulfhydryl oxidizing conditions, treatment of the enzyme with GSH + diamide was modified to include [35S]GSH, and TH was subjected to SDS-PAGE under nonreducing conditions. The resulting autoradiogram is presented in Fig. 3. Exposure of TH to [35S]GSH alone did not modify the protein but when the enzyme was treated with [35S]GSH in the presence of diamide, 35S was incorporated into TH (lane 2). Under nonreducing (but denaturing) conditions, TH electrophoreses as the 60-kDa monomer. If DTT was added to reactions before GSH + diamide, the enzyme was not modified by the incorporation of isotope (Fig. 3, lane 3). Similarly, if either DTT or GRx (+ GSH) was added to enzyme preparations after [35S]GSH + diamide treatment, the [35S]GSH-mediated labeling of TH was reversed (Fig. 3, lanes 4 and 5). Purified PC12 TH responded in the same manner as recombinant TH when treated with diamide + [35S]GSH, and these results are included in Fig. 3 (lanes 6–10) as well. The PC12 form of TH also electrophoreses as the 60-kDa monomer under non-reducing conditions. PC12 cells were treated with diamide, and the effects on TH activity are presented in Fig. 4. It can be seen that cellular TH activity was reduced by diamide in a concentration-dependent manner. Immunoprecipitation of TH from cells that had been metabolically labeled with [35S]cysteine (in the presence of cycloheximide to block protein translation) and then treated with inhibitory concentrations of diamide (10 mm), revealed an incorporation of [35S]GSH into the protein. These results are presented in Fig. 5A, lane 3. TH was not labeled with [35S]GSH in the absence of diamide. Treatment of immunoprecipitated TH with DTT prior to electrophoresis removed the [35S]GSH label (Fig. 5, lane 4). When the autoradiogram shown in Fig. 5A was probed with a monoclonal antibody against TH, all lanes displayed immunoreactivity, confirming that the polyclonal antibody against TH that was used for immunoprecipitation of cell extracts had bound roughly equivalent amounts of antigen under all treatment conditions.Figure 5S-Glutathionylation of TH in PC12 cells.PC12 cells were cultured and metabolically labeled with [35S]cysteine as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Unincorporated isotope was removed by washing, and cells were treated with 10 mm diamide for 15 min at 37 °C. After removal of diamide with three washes, intact cells were harvested and lysed, and TH was immunoprecipitated from the cytosolic fraction using a polyclonal antibody against TH (1:1000 dilution). Immunoprecipitates were adsorbed to Sepharose A beads and subsequently resolved by SDS-PAGE and electroblotted to nitrocellulose. The incorporation of [35S]GSH into immunoprecipitated TH was determined by autoradiography (A), and blots were then probed with a monoclonal antibody against TH (B). The treatment conditions for PC12 cells associated with the respective lanes were: (1), untreated cells; (2), labeling of cellular GSH with [35S]cysteine; (3) diamide (10 mm) treatment after labeling of GSH with [35S]cysteine; and (4), treatment of immunoprecipitates with DTT prior to SDS-PAGE. Lane 5 is an external standard of recombinant TH protein (5 μg) to confirm immunoprecipitations and immunoblotting.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The sites of S-glutathionylation in TH were determined by MALDI/MS and LC/MS/MS. Because two of the cysteine residues in TH are juxtaposed (i.e. Cys-329 and Cys-330), CNBr proved to be the most effective cleavage technique to obtain these residues in a single peptide. A peak for the expected cleavage productH2N-HSPEPDCCHELLGHVPMh, where Mh indicates a homoserine lactone residue, was readily found in the MALDI mass spectra of both the untreated and diamide-treated TH (Fig. 6). Interestingly, the m/z value found corresponds to the expected cleavage product containing an intramolecular disulfide bond (calculated monoisotopic mass of 1850.8 Da for [M+H]+). This disulfide bond is not a feature of wild type TH and is an artifact of t"

The mechanisms that mediate the response of the neuronal cells to the axonal injury are still unknown. We have previously shown that semaphorins, axon guidance molecules with repulsive cues, are capable of mediating apoptosis in cultured neuronal cells (Shirvan, A., Ziv, I., Fleminger, G., Shina, R., He, Z., Brudo, I., Melamed, E., and Brazilai, A. (1999) J. Neurochem.73, 961–971). In this study, we examined the involvement of semaphorins in an in vivo experimental animal model of complete axotomy of the rat optic nerve. We demonstrate that a marked induction of type III semaphorin proteins takes place in ipsilateral retinas at early stages following axotomy, well before any morphological signs of RGC apoptosis can be detected. Time course analysis revealed that a peak of expression occurred after 2–3 days and then declined. A small conserved peptide derived from semaphorin 3A that was previously shown to induce neuronal death in culture was capable of inducing RGC loss upon its intravitreous injection into the rat eye. Moreover, we demonstrate a marked inhibition of RGC loss when axotomized eyes were co-treated by intravitreous injection of function-blocking antibodies against the semaphorin 3A-derived peptide. Marked neuronal protection from degeneration was also observed when the antibodies were applied 24 h post-injury. We therefore suggest that semaphorins are key proteins that modulate the cell fate of axotomized RGC. Neutralization of the semaphorin repulsive function may serve as a promising new approach for treatment of traumatic injury in the adult mammalian central nervous system or of ophthalmologic diseases such as glaucoma and ischemic optic neuropathy that induce apoptotic RGC death.

Axon guidance molecules are a large family of secreted and membrane-bound proteins that participate in axonal pathway formation during development of the nervous system in a receptor-mediated process (reviewed in Refs. 1Nieto M.A. Neuron. 1996; 17: 1039-1048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 2Tessier-Lavigne M.

Neuron. 1997; 18: 193-207Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). In particular, several members of the semaphorin family of proteins may play an important role in navigating axonal networks throughout neuronal development via their chemorepulsive activity on neuronal growth cones (5Kolodkin A.L. Prog. Brain Res. 1998; 117: 115-132Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Mark M.D. Lohrum M. Puschel A.W. Cell Tissue Res. 1997; 290: 299-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 7Puschel A.W. Adams R.H. Betz H. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 1996; 7: 419-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The basic structure of sema includes a semaphorin domain of 500 bp as well as immunoglobulin-like and thrombospondin domains. Semaphorins are currently grouped into nine subclasses, which contain both secreted and transmembranous members (3Van Vactor D.V. Lorenz L.J. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: R201-R204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 8Yu H.H. Kolodkin A.L. Neuron. 1999; 22: 11-14Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Inhibition of axonal outgrowth was demonstrated by some semaphorins; it occurs at the tip of the growth cone and is manifested by depolymerization and loss of F-actin (9Fan J. Mansfield G. Redmond T. Gordon-Weeks P.R. Raper J.A. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 867-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 10Driessens M.H. Hu H. Nobes C.D. Self A. Jordens I. Goodman C.S. Hall A. Curr.

The downstream pathways by which semaphorins exert their actions are still unclear, but are known to include the neuropilin and plexin receptors (11Chen H. Chedotal A. He Z. Goodman C.S. Tessier-Lavigne M. Neuron. 1997; 19: 547-559Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar, 12Fujisawa H. Kisukawa T. Curr. Opin.

Strittmatter S.M. Nature. 1995; 376: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar) and G-proteins (14Jin Z. Strittmatter S.M. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 6256-6263Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, it has recently been shown that semaphorins are bifunctional molecules, and cyclic nucleotides can regulate their activity from repulsion to attraction (15Bagnard D. Lohrum M. Uziel D.

Involvement of semaphorin family members in other physiological phenomena was suggested, such as regulation of organ formation outside the nervous system (17Behar O. Golden J.A. Mashimo H. Schoen F.J. Fishman M.C. Nature. 1996; 383: 525-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar), regulation of the immune response (18Delaire S. Elhabazi A. Bensussan A. Boumsell L. Cell. Mol.

Fleminger G. Shina R. He Z. Brudo I. Melamed E. Barzilai A. J. Neurochem. 1999; 73: 961-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). In a model system of cultured chick sympathetic neurons undergoing dopamine-induced apoptosis, induction of both collapsin-1, now termed chick semaphorin 3A (Sema3A 1The abbreviations used are: Sema3A, semaphorin 3A; RGC, retinal ganglion cell(s); 4-Di-10-Asp, 4-(4-(didecylamino)styryl)-N-methylpyridinium iodide; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; KLH, keyhole limpet hemocyanin1The abbreviations used are: Sema3A, semaphorin 3A; RGC, retinal ganglion cell(s); 4-Di-10-Asp, 4-(4-(didecylamino)styryl)-N-methylpyridinium iodide; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; KLH, keyhole limpet hemocyanin; a secreted and diffusible type III semaphorin with repulsive activity), and CRMP-62 was detected. This up-regulation was evident at the early stages following exposure to the apoptotic trigger, even before the emergence of the typical morphological signs of apoptosis. The up-regulation of Sema3A expression was coupled to the onset of the commitment time point of the neurons to the death process. Moreover, marked and prolonged protection of neurons from dopamine-induced apoptosis was achieved by co-treatment of cells with function-blocking anti-Sema3A antibodies. Antibodies against neuropilin-1, the putative semaphorin III/Sema3A receptor (23He Z. Tessier-Lavigne M. Cell. 1997; 90: 739-751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (955) Google Scholar, 24Kolodkin A.L. Levengood D.V. Rowe E.G. Tai Y. Giger R.J. Ginty D.D. Cell. 1997; 90: 753-762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (985) Google Scholar), also inhibited neuronal apoptosis. In addition, induction of apoptosis was evident by treatment of neurons with a recombinant human semaphorin III protein (22Shirvan A. Ziv I. Fleminger G. Shina R. He Z. Brudo I. Melamed E. Barzilai A. J. Neurochem. 1999; 73: 961-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). These results demonstrated a correlation between the semaphorin death-inducing activity and the repulsive activity on axonal growth cones. We therefore proposed that repulsive diffusible cues, acting on appropriate receptor-bearing cells, could modulate neuronal cell fate (22Shirvan A. Ziv I. Fleminger G. Shina R. He Z. Brudo I. Melamed E. Barzilai A. J. Neurochem. 1999; 73: 961-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Further support for our studies was provided by the indication of involvement of semaphorins in apoptosis of sensory neurons (25Gagliardini V. Fankhauser C. Neuroscience. 1999; 14: 301-316Google Scholar) and neuronal progenitor cells (26Bagnard D. Vaillant C. Khunth S.-T. Dufay N. Lohrum M. Puschel A.W. Belin M.-F. Thomasset N. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 3332-3341Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The molecular mechanisms responsible for transforming the repellent guidance cue from the damaged axon into a death signal that may affect the cell body are unknown. Therefore, it was important to further substantiate and extend our in vitro findings to an experimental in vivo model of neuronal apoptosis. One of the models used to study the fate of injured neurons in the adult central nervous system is the visual system, in which retinal apoptosis occurs following axonal injury to the optic nerve. In rats, transection of the optic nerve close to the cell bodies is a trigger for retrograde degeneration and delayed death of retinal ganglion cells (RGC) (27Berkelaar M. Clarke D.B. Wang Y.C. Bray G.M. Aguayo A.J. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 4368-4374Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The mechanism that initiates the loss of retinal cell bodies as a function of axonal injury is still unknown, and several hypotheses have been suggested (reviewed in Ref. 28So K.F. Yip H.K. Vision Res. 1998; 38: 1525-1535Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). However, many lines of evidence indicate that apoptotic processes are responsible for the loss of RGC in the retina following axotomy of the optic nerve and for the loss of other axotomized or traumatized central nervous system neurons (27Berkelaar M. Clarke D.B. Wang Y.C. Bray G.M. Aguayo A.J. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 4368-4374Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,29Garcia-Valenzuela E. Shareef S. Walsh J. Sharma S.C. Exp.

Maffei L. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 5292-5301Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This secondary death of the RGC also serves as an example of the correlation between neuronal cell survival and axonal integrity. Such a correlation is supported by studies indicating that when an axon is injured, the cell body goes through a series of changes that may culminate in the death of the axotomized neurons (32Lieberman A.R. Bellairs G. Gray E.G. Essays of the Nervous System. Clarendon Press, Oxford1974: 71-105Google Scholar). Following optic nerve axotomy in adult rats, initial reduction of the original population of RGC is observed 5–7 days after injury. A rapid process of cell death then takes place, and >80% of the RGC die within 2 weeks after the injury (27Berkelaar M. Clarke D.B. Wang Y.C. Bray G.M. Aguayo A.J. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 4368-4374Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33Peinaldo-Ramon P. Salvador M. Villegas-Perez M.P. Vidal-Sanz M. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis.

Bahr M. Cell Death & Differ. 1999; 6: 673-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Because a relatively long interval precedes this massive death process, it can be speculated that a time window exists in which protective intervention with modulators that attenuate or prevent cell death can be employed. Indeed, partial and temporal rescue of RGC from axotomy-induced apoptosis was obtained by several approaches. These included early treatment with microglial inhibitors (36Thanos S. Mey J. Wild M. J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 455-466Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 37Thanos S. Mey J. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 1057-1079Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), glial or brain-derived neurotrophic factors (38Koeberle P.D. Ball A.K.

Vision Res. 1998; 38: 1537-1543Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Therefore, we chose the visual system as an in vivo model in which neuronal apoptosis can be induced and, more importantly, that can also offer an opportunity to intervene and alter the fate of the injured RGC. We now report that high levels of semaphorin expression are transiently induced in the rat retina at an early post-axotomy stage and before any RGC death is observed. Furthermore, we demonstrate that rescue of RGC from axotomy-induced degeneration can be achieved by treatment of the injured retina with intraocular administration of anti-Sema3A function-blocking antibodies. Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats (8–10 weeks old, 300 g) were deeply anesthetized (50 mg/kg xylazine and 35 mg/kg ketamine), and their left optic nerves were exposed by lateral canthotomy. The conjuctivae were incised lateral to the cornea, and the retractor bulbus muscles were separated. Through a small opening in the menings (∼200 μm), the nerve fibers were completely transected at a distance of 2–3 mm from the globe. The procedure was performed without damage to the nerve vasculature and optic nerve blood supply and with minimal damage to the meninges by the use of a specially designed glass dissector with a 200-μm tip and a smooth blunt edge (45Solomon A.S. Lavie V. Hauben U. Monsonego A. Yoles E. Schwartz M. J. Neurosci. Methods. 1996; 70: 21-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The injury was unilateral in all animals, and the other eye served as a control. At day 8 following axotomy of the optic nerve, the rats were deeply anesthetized. Small crystals of the lipophilic neurotracer dye 4-(4-(didecylamino)styryl)-N-methylpyridinium iodide (4-Di-10-Asp; Molecular Probes, Inc.) were dissolved gently in incomplete Freund's adjuvant (at a concentration of 1 mm; Difco). This dye serves as a marker for living RGC because it is transmitted through the axonal network and stains the cell bodies of live neurons only, whereas nonviable neurons as well as other cell types such as endothelial cells remained unstained (42Lazarov-Spiegler O. Solomon A.S. Schwartz M. Vision Res. 1999; 39: 169-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The dye was applied to the transected nerve 0.5 mm from the proximal border of the transection site. The site of injury was visible by its grayish color in comparison with the rest of the nerve, which maintained its original color. Four days after dye application, retinas were excised, whole-mounted on Millipore filters, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and viewed under a fluorescent microscope using a fluorescein isothiocyanate filter. Two independent and blinded researchers counted the number of labeled RGC in flat-mounted retinas by fluorescent microscopy. For each retina, 20 representative microscopic fields were evaluated: 10 fields from the peripheral area and 10 fields from the central area (each field covering an area of 0.069 mm2). Central retinal areas were defined as located within two-thirds from the optic disc, and peripheral retinal areas were defined as located within one-third of the retinal radius. (These definitions were based on the apparent change in density of RGC between the two central and peripheral areas.) For comparison, we performed a previously described counting method (35Isenmann S. Engel S. Gillardon F. Bahr M. Cell Death & Differ. 1999; 6: 673-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) that divides each quadrant of the retina into three different areas and counts a total of two microscopic fields from each area of the retina (making a total of 12 fields). However, when the two counting protocols were compared (by counting the RGC in control retinas), we found that the numbers came out the same. Therefore, we saw no advantage in using the previously described method, and we used the above protocol for the entire analysis. Retinas from eyes that were subjected to axotomy contained less RGC and were compared with intact retinas. Histological parameters are presented as means ± S.E. Mann-Whitney and analysis of variance tests were used to assess the results. Sema3A-derived peptides (Pep1A, corresponding to amino acids 363–380 from chick Sema3A, and the control peptide Pep3A, corresponding to amino acids 240–256 according to Ref. 46Luo Y. Raible D. Raper J.A. Cell. 1993; 75: 217-227Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (998) Google Scholar) were synthesized by Genemed Biotechnologies, Inc. (San Francisco, CA) and purified to homogeneity on a RP-18 column (Vydac, Hesperia, CA) using a Gilson Model 303 HPLC system. Prior to injection, each peptide was dissolved in PBS, and a total amount of 0.33 mg/kg in a volume of 2 μl was injected into the vitreous body of one eye, and the opposite eye served as a control. Insertion was at the corneal limbal border behind the lens, over the optic nerve head area and close to the retinal surface. Polyclonal anti-Sema3A antibodies were prepared in rabbits by immunization against Pep1A, a peptide corresponding to amino acids 363–380 from chick Sema3A (46Luo Y. Raible D. Raper J.A. Cell. 1993; 75: 217-227Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (998) Google Scholar). The sequence of this peptide is identical in chick Sema3A, human semaphorin III, and rat and mouse semaphorin D. These antibodies were therefore expected to react with the highly conserved Sema3A/semaphorin III/semaphorin D proteins present in those species. Synthetic peptides were obtained and purified as described above. Peptide conjugates with keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH; Sigma) were prepared by incubation of the peptide (3 mg) with 1 ml of KLH containing 10 mg of protein and 1.25% glutaraldehyde. After 3–4 min at room temperature, the reaction was stopped by addition of 0.1 ml of 1 m glycine in water. Two rabbits were immunized against the peptide. Rabbits were immunized by subcutaneous injections of 0.1 mg of KLH-conjugated peptide. Booster shots were injected 2, 5, and 8 weeks after immunization. The titer of the antibodies in the serum was 1:104 as determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and compared with preimmune serum. Both the immune and preimmune sera were fractionated using 40% saturated ammonium sulfate and dialyzed against PBS. These antibodies were previously characterized and shown to react with the chick Sema3A protein and to act as function-blocking antibodies that block the repellent activity of human semaphorin III (22Shirvan A. Ziv I. Fleminger G. Shina R. He Z. Brudo I. Melamed E. Barzilai A. J. Neurochem. 1999; 73: 961-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). These antibodies were used in this study for inhibiting the effect of axotomy. Balb/c mice were immunized subcutaneously with 50 μg of KLH-conjugated Pep1A in complete Freund's adjuvant and boosted four times subcutaneously with 50 μg of KLH-conjugated Pep1A in incomplete Freund's adjuvant at 3-week intervals. Three days before fusion, mice were boosted by intravenously injection of 50 μg of KLH-conjugated Pep1A in PBS. One mouse that had a relatively high titer (as evidenced by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with bovine serum albumin-conjugated Pep1A) and that was also positive in Western blot analysis, immunohistochemistry, and immunoprecipitation was chosen for fusion. Hybridomas were prepared by fusion of spleen cells with mouse myeloma NS0 cells (donated by Dr. C. Milstein. Following the cloning procedure, positive clones were chosen for the preparation of ascitic fluids, which was carried out by intraperitoneal injection of 2–5 × 106hybridoma cells into pristane-primed male mice. The fluid was harvested starting at 7–10 days and then twice every 2nd day. Ascitic fluids were centrifuged at 800 × g and kept frozen at −80 °C. The antibodies were characterized by their ability to react with a single protein with the right molecular mass (110 kDa) in chick embryo retinas at embryonic day 18, by their ability to immunoprecipitate this protein, and by their ability to label the ganglion cell layer of embryonic day 18 retinal slices. These antibodies were used in this study for both immunohistochemistry and Western blot analysis. For protective antibody treatment, the axotomized animals were grouped into four groups of four to six rats each. Two groups were injected with the partially purified polyclonal anti-Sema3A antibody (at a single dose of 30 μg in a volume of 2 μl). One of the groups was injected immediately after optic nerve transection (time 0), and the second group was injected with the antibody 24 h post-injury. The other two groups served as controls: one group was injected with preimmune serum (30 μg in a volume of 2 μl, taken from the same rabbit used for immunization), and the second with PBS. The anti-Sema3A antibody was injected into the vitreous body of the axotomized eye. Injection was performed using a glass pipette that was inserted into the eye globe. Insertion was at the corneal limbic border behind the lens, over the optic nerve head area and close to the retinal surface. Injection of the anti-Sema3A antibody did not cause any signs of inflammation or irritation or any other changes that may indicate that this treatment is toxic. Clinical examination of the eyes was performed using a slit lamp, and the eyes were monitored for any signs of hyperemia, edema, discharge, fibrin, and other inflammatory parameters. Western blot analysis was performed as described by Harlow and Lane (65Harlow E. Lane D. A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988: 490-492Google Scholar) using 8% polyacrylamide gels. Each lane was loaded with an equal amount of protein extracts (175 μg), which, following electrophoresis, were transferred to an Immobilon (polyvinylidene disulfide) membrane for 1.5 h. Blots were stained with Ponceau to verify equal loading and transfer of proteins. Membranes were then probed with monoclonal anti-semaphorin antibodies (1:1000 dilution). The intensity of the signal was determined using the ECL-Plus detection system (Amersham Biosciences, Buckinghamshire, UK). Dissected retinas from optic nerve-axotomized rat eyes and from non-injured control were from optic nerve-axotomized rat eyes, and controls were fixed in 3.5% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 1–2 h and then infiltrated for cryoprotection with 4% sucrose for 2 h at 4 °C, followed by 20% sucrose + 5% glycerol in PBS at the same temperature, overnight. Fixed tissue was quickly frozen in liquid nitrogen. Cross-sections (10 μm) were placed on subbed slides (1% gelatin containing 0.3% chromium potassium sulfate) and stored at −20 °C. Sections were washed with PBS and incubated in PBS and 1% bovine serum albumin for 30 min at room temperature. The sections were incubated overnight with the primary monoclonal antibody against Sema3A at 4 °C. The slides were then washed three times with PBS and incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG for 1 h at room temperature. After washing three times with PBS, the sections were mounted with galvanol. Observations were made and photography was carried out with a Zeiss Axioplan microscope with an appropriate filter. As a control, the sections were reacted either with preimmune rabbit serum or with the secondary antibody only. Cross-sections were stained with a cell-permeable form of bisbenzimide (Hoechst 33342) at a concentration of 4 μg/ml for 30 min at 37 °C. Cells were visualized by UV light microscopy, and the relative number of apoptotic nuclei with condensed or fragmented chromatin was then evaluated and compared with non-apoptotic nuclei, showing a pale and diffuse staining. Photomicrographs using a UV filter were taken for documentation. In the adult rat, injury to the optic nerve leads to delayed apoptotic death of the RGC. To establish the experimental model, rats were subjected to intrameningeal complete axotomy of the optic nerve in one eye, whereas the second eye served as a control. To demonstrate the effect of axotomy on RGC in this experimental system, two approaches were used. One method estimated the number of live RGC that were still detected 12 days following the injury. The RGC from one eye that was subjected to optic nerve axotomy were retrograde-labeled by application (at day 8) of the neurotracer dye 4-Di-10-Asp, and the retina was fixed and flat-mounted 4 days later. Non-axotomized eyes taken from different normal rats (that were not subjected to optic nerve axotomy) served as controls. The retinas were then observed under a fluorescence microscope (Fig. 1). The axotomized retinas appeared to be depleted, with very few live RGC compared with intact retinas, in which multiple cells were observed, and the large RGC exhibited long neuritic processes. The number of stained (live) RGC was counted, and the results are presented in Table I. At 12 days after the injury (8 days after axotomy + 4 days of staining), a massive loss of RGC was observed in both the central and peripheral retinal areas. The survival rates were 35 and 52%, respectively. The higher death rate of the central RGC may be explained by the proximity to the injury site, which was close to the cell bodies of these neurons. The overall RGC death in our experimental system was compatible with results from previously published protocols following 8 days of axotomy (35Isenmann S. Engel S. Gillardon F. Bahr M. Cell Death & Differ. 1999; 6: 673-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) and was ∼60%.Table IEffect of anti-Sema3A antibody on RGC survival following axotomyTreatmentCentral areaSurvivalPeripheral areaSurvivalAverageSurvival%%%Normal control (untreated)2355 ± 3781001162 ± 1641001759 ± 291100Axotomy without treatment (8 days)834 ± 6735603 ± 5952719 ± 14041Axotomy with preimmune serum administration625 ± 2127674 ± 9558650 ± 6037Axotomy with antibody administration immediately following injury1785 ± 502751257 ± 4671081501 ± 32785Axotomy with antibody administration 24 h post-injury2586 ± 3451061635 ± 1601402110 ± 286120Shown are RGC numbers 8 days after optic nerve axotomy either with no treatment or with intraocular injection of preimmune serum (immediately following injury) or anti-Sema3A antibodies.

https://openalex.org/W1975372612,"RhoG is a member of the Rho family of small GTPases and shares high sequence identity with Rac1 and Cdc42. Previous studies suggested that RhoG mediates its effects through activation of Rac1 and Cdc42. To further understand the mechanism of RhoG signaling, we studied its potential activation pathways, downstream signaling properties, and functional relationship to Rac1 and Cdc42 in vivo. First, we determined that RhoG was regulated by guanine nucleotide exchange factors that also activate Rac and/or Cdc42. Vav2 (which activates RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42) and to a lesser degree Dbs (which activates RhoA and Cdc42) activated RhoG in vitro. Thus, RhoG may be activated concurrently with Rac1 and Cdc42. Second, some effectors of Rac/Cdc42 (IQGAP2, MLK-3, PLD1), but not others (e.g. PAKs, POSH, WASP, Par-6, IRSp53), interacted with RhoG in a GTP-dependent manner. Third, consistent with this differential interaction with effectors, activated RhoG stimulated some (JNK and Akt) but not other (SRF and NF-κB) downstream signaling targets of activated Rac1 and Cdc42. Finally, transient transduction of a tat-tagged Rac1(17N) dominant-negative fusion protein inhibited the induction of lamellipodia by the Rac-specific activator, Tiam1, but not by activated RhoG. Together, these data argue that RhoG function is mediated by signals independent of Rac1 and Cdc42 activation and instead by direct utilization of a subset of common effectors.

Together, these data argue that RhoG function is mediated by signals independent of Rac1 and Cdc42 activation and instead by direct utilization of a subset of common effectors. The Rho family of small GTPases constitutes a major branch of the Ras superfamily of proteins, and like the other Ras-like GTPases, they function as GDP/GTP-regulated molecular switches where the GTP bound form is active and the GDP bound is inactive (1Takai Y. Sasaki T. Matozaki T. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 153-208Google Scholar, 2Ridley A.J. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 471-477Google Scholar). Proteins in the Rho family are activated by guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) 1The abbreviations used are: GEF, guanine nucleotide exchange factor; DH, Dbl homology; PH, Pleckstrin homology; GAP, GTPase activating protein; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; HA, hemagglutinin; GFP, green fluorescent protein; GST, glutathione S-transferase; GFP, green fluorescent protein; RBD, RhoA-GTP binding domain; PBD, p21 binding domain; GBD, GTPase binding domain; JNK, c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase; SRF, serum response factor 1The abbreviations used are: GEF, guanine nucleotide exchange factor; DH, Dbl homology; PH, Pleckstrin homology; GAP, GTPase activating protein; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; HA, hemagglutinin; GFP, green fluorescent protein; GST, glutathione S-transferase; GFP, green fluorescent protein; RBD, RhoA-GTP binding domain; PBD, p21 binding domain; GBD, GTPase binding domain; JNK, c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase; SRF, serum response factor and inactivated by GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs). GEFs stimulate the exchange of GDP for GTP on the GTPase. Rho GEFs are also referred to as Dbl family proteins, and all members possess a tandem Dbl homology (DH) catalytic domain and a pleckstrin homology (PH) regulatory domain structure (3Whitehead I.P. Campbell S. Rossman K.L. Der C.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1332: F1-F23Google Scholar,4Cerione R.A. Zheng Y. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 216-222Google Scholar). GAPs inactivate Rho proteins via stimulation of their intrinsic GTPase activity (5Gamblin S.J. Smerdon S.J. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1998; 8: 195-201Google Scholar). Rho family proteins have an additional group of negative regulatory proteins, guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitors, that both inhibit nucleotide exchange and regulate Rho protein association with membranes (6Olofsson B. Cell. Signal. 1999; 11: 545-554Google Scholar). Currently, at least 18 mammalian Rho family GTPases have been identified, and Cdc42, Rac1, and RhoA have been the most extensively studied and characterized. Perhaps the best characterized function of Rho proteins is their ability to regulate the actin cytoskeleton and thereby regulate cell morphology, adhesion, and migration (7Hall A. Science. 1998; 279: 509-514Google Scholar, 8Schmitz A.A. Govek E.E. Bottner B. Van Aelst L. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 261: 1-12Google Scholar). Cdc42 induces actin polymerization and the formation of filopodia in conjunction with its regulation of cell polarity (9Nobes C.D. Hall A. Cell. 1995; 81: 53-62Google Scholar, 10Kozma R. Ahmed S. Best A. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1942-1952Google Scholar, 11Stowers L. Yelon D. Berg L.J. Chant J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5027-5031Google Scholar). Rac1 typically controls cell protrusion through actin polymerization, formation of lamellipodia, and membrane ruffles (12Ridley A.J. Paterson H.F. Johnston C.L. Diekmann D. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 401-410Google Scholar). The characteristic property of RhoA is its stimulation of myosin-based contractility, which in turn controls focal adhesion and stress-fiber formation as well as cellular adhesion and motility (13Ridley A.J. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 389-399Google Scholar, 14Chrzanowska-Wodnicka M. Burridge K. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 1403-1415Google Scholar). In addition, Rho GTPases also regulate gene transcription and cell proliferation and are required for the transforming activity of Ras and other oncoproteins (15Bar-Sagi D. Hall A. Cell. 2000; 103: 227-238Google Scholar, 16Pruitt K. Der C.J. Cancer Lett. 2001; 171: 1-10Google Scholar). RhoG is most similar to Rac1 and Cdc42 in sequence identity (72 and 62%, respectively) and function. Earlier studies suggested that RhoG stimulates pathways distinct from those activated by Cdc42 and Rac1. This conclusion was based on the finding that co-expression of activated RhoG together with activated Rac1 and Cdc42 caused a 4-fold enhancement of the transforming activity that was seen with only Rac1 and Cdc42 (17Roux P. Gauthier-Rouviere C. Doucet-Brutin S. Fort P. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 629-637Google Scholar). However, more recent studies support a model in which RhoG mediates similar functions as Rac and Cdc42 by causing the downstream activation of Rac and Cdc42. For example, activated RhoG caused actin cytoskeletal changes in NIH 3T3 cells consistent with simultaneous activation of Rac and Cdc42 (18Gauthier-Rouviere C. Vignal E. Meriane M. Roux P. Montcourier P. Fort P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 1379-1394Google Scholar). Additionally, it was demonstrated that dominant-negative mutants of Cdc42 and Rac1 could block RhoG-induced neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells (19Katoh H. Yasui H. Yamaguchi Y. Aoki J. Fujita H. Mori K. Negishi M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7378-7387Google Scholar). Finally, transient expression of activated RhoG increased the activation of endogenous Cdc42 and Rac1 (19Katoh H. Yasui H. Yamaguchi Y. Aoki J. Fujita H. Mori K. Negishi M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7378-7387Google Scholar), suggesting that RhoG signals through Cdc42 and Rac1. The manner in which RhoG causes the activation of Cdc42 and Rac1 was not determined Presently, little is known regarding the upstream signals that cause RhoG activation and the effectors of RhoG function. Extracellular stimuli cause activation of Rho GTPase primarily through the activation of Dbl-family GEFs. Several Dbl family members (Vav2, Vav3, and Trio) have been found to activate RhoG in vitro (20Schuebel K.E. Movilla N. Rosa J.L. Bustelo X.R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6608-6621Google Scholar, 21Movilla N. Bustelo X.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7870-7885Google Scholar, 22Blangy A. Vignal E. Schmidt S. Debant A. Gauthier-Rouviere C. Fort P. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 729-739Google Scholar). Because these GEFs also activate Rac, Rac and RhoG may be activated concurrently rather than sequentially. Downstream, little is known about RhoG effector binding. In yeast two-hybrid binding analyses, it was determined that RhoG did not interact with Pak1, POR-1, or WASP (18Gauthier-Rouviere C. Vignal E. Meriane M. Roux P. Montcourier P. Fort P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 1379-1394Google Scholar), three binding partners of Rac and/or Cdc42, arguing that RhoG cannot mediate Rac/Cdc42-associated events via the utilization of effectors shared with Rac or Cdc42. To further evaluate the relationship between RhoG and Cdc42/Rac signaling, we tested the ability of RhoG to bind and become activated by Rac or Cdc42 GEFs, to bind to effectors of Rac and Cdc42, to activate downstream signaling pathways stimulated by Rac and Cdc42, and to determine whether RhoG specifically activates Cdc42 and Rac1. Our results strongly indicate that in our cell system, RhoG mediates its effects independent of an activation of Rac1 and Cdc42. We isolated cDNA sequences encoding RhoG by polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-mediated DNA amplification from two different human cDNA libraries. Both cDNA sequences were identical to those described previously for wild-type RhoG (Genbank accession no. XM006153). We then utilized this sequence to generate mutant sequences encoding dominant-negative (G15A and T17N) and dominant-activated (Q61L) by using the QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Wild-type and mutated RhoG cDNAs were subsequently subcloned into the pGEX 4T-1 (Amersham Biosciences) bacterial, or pEGFP-C3 (Clontech), and pCDNA3 (Invitrogen) (with an addition of an NH2-terminal hemaglutinin (HA) tag) mammalian expression vectors. Similarly, bacterial expression vectors for wild-type and mutant (G15/17A and Q61/63L) human Cdc42, Rac1, and RhoA were made by subcloning cDNA sequences encoding these proteins into pGEX 4T-1 for expression of glutathione S-transferase (GST)-tagged fusion proteins. cDNA sequences encoding green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged activated (Q61L) and dominant-negative (T17N) Rac1 were made by mutagenesis of human wild-type Rac1 using the QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) and were then subcloned into pEGFP-C3. cDNA sequences encoding a GFP-tagged fragment of the tandem DH-PH domains of Tiam1 were excised from the Tiam1 DH-PH fragment from the pCGN-Tiam1 DH-PH plasmid vector (23Karnoub A.E. Worthylake D.K. Rossman K.L. Pruitt W.M. Campbell S.L. Sondek J. Der C.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 1037-1041Google Scholar) and subcloned into pEGFP-C1 (Clontech). cDNA sequences encoding a GFP-tagged fragment of the RhoA-GTP binding domain (RBD) of rhotekin, a RhoA-specific effector, was made by PCR-mediated DNA amplification from a pGEX-rhotekin RBD plasmid construct (24Arthur W.T. Petch L.A. Burridge K. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 719-722Google Scholar) and subcloned into pEGFP-C1. cDNA sequences encoding an HA epitope-tagged fragment of the Cdc42-specific, partial CRIB domain-containing effector IRSp53 ΔSH3 was made by PCR-mediated DNA amplification of the cDNA sequence encoding amino acids 1–364 from a human cDNA library and then subcloned into the pCGN-hygro mammalian expression vector. Mammalian expression vectors for expression of Vav1, Vav2, Dbl, Dbs, Ect2, Lfc, LARG, MLK3, and Rac1(17N) have been described previously by our laboratories (25Abe K. Whitehead I.P. O'Bryan J.P.

NIH 3T3 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagles medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% bovine calf serum (Sigma) and penicillin/streptomycin/fungizone (Invitrogen). DNA transfections were done by using LipofectAMINE Plus (Invitrogen) by the protocol recommended by the manufacturer. Microinjections were done by plating cells on 35-mm culture dishes with 1.2 mm glass bottoms (MatTek Corp.) 24 h before injection. On the day of injection, normal growth medium was replaced by microinjection medium (50% normal growth medium and 50% of Hank's balanced saline solution buffered with 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.2), and the cultures were placed under phase contrast at 400× on a Nikon Eclipse TE300 inverted fluorescent microscope, and expression vector plasmids diluted to 25 ng/μl in double distilled H2O were injected. Nuclear injections were performed using an Eppendorf Microinjection System (InjectMan 5179 and Femtojet 5246, Eppendorf) at a pressure of 20 hPa. To control the injection process and identify microinjected cells, rhodamine-labeled dextran (Sigma) was mixed with the DNA at final a concentration of 10 mg/ml. Approximately 25 cells were injected for each condition. After microinjection, cells were changed back to normal growth medium and incubated at 37 °C in a 10% CO2incubator for 3 h before fixing and immunofluorescent staining. For transduction of tat-tagged bacterial fusion proteins, cells were plated on glass coverslips on day 0, LipofectAMINE-mediated transfection with pEGFP RhoG(61L), Rac1(61L), or Tiam1 DH-PH day 1, and tat-Rac1(17N) was added at a concentration of 50 μg/ml in serum-free medium at day 2 for 3 h before cells were fixed and stained. Bacterially expressed tat-tagged protein was purified and delivered to cells (50 μg/ml) as described previously (34Vocero-Akbani A. Chellaiah M.A. Hruska K.A. Dowdy S.F. Methods Enzymol. 2001; 332: 36-49Google Scholar). For LipofectAMINE-mediated transduction of GST or GST-Pak1 PBD, the cells were plated on coverslips in 24-well plates and transfected as described above with expression plasmid DNAs encoding the indicated proteins. The day after the transfection, 5 μg of GST or GST-Pak1 PBD protein was mixed with 5 μl of LipofectAMINE and then added to each well in serum-free medium. Two h after the addition of the protein-LipofectAMINE mix, the cells were fixed and stained. Immunofluorescent labeling for the transduced protein showed that at least 90% of the cells had taken up the protein. In vitro protein interaction analyses between cellularly expressed GEFs or effectors to recombinant Rho proteins was performed as described previously (31Reuther G.W. Lambert Q.T. Booden M.A. Wennerberg K. Becknell B. Marcucci G. Sondek J. Caligiuri M.A. Der C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27145-27151Google Scholar). Briefly, epitope-tagged GEFs or effectors were transiently overexpressed in NIH 3T3 cells by LipofectAMINE Plus transfection. Twenty-four h post-transfection, cells were lysed and GST or GST-tagged versions of Rho proteins were bound to glutathione Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) were added to the lysates and rotated for 30 min. The beads were washed three times with lysis buffer, and the bound material was subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blot analyses with antibodies that recognize the epitope tag associated with each expressed protein (anti-Myc 9E10, Sigma; anti-HA HA11, Covance; anti-GFP, Clontech; anti-T7, Novagen). For GEF binding assays, bacterially expressed protein for nucleotide-free G15A (G17A in RhoA) mutants of the Rho proteins were used. For effector binding assays, the GTPase-deficient, constitutively GTP-bound Q61L (Q63L in RhoA) mutants were used. Fluorescence spectroscopic analysis of N-methylanthraniloyl-GTP incorporation into GDP-preloaded GST-RhoG was carried out using a FLUOstar fluorescence microplate reader (BMG Lab Technologies) at 25 °C using procedures similar to those described previously (35Leonard D.A. Evans T. Hart M. Cerione R.A. Manor D. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 12323-12328Google Scholar). Exchange reaction assay mixtures containing 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 50 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1% glycerol, 500 nm N-methylanthraniloyl-GTP (Biomol), and 2 μm GTPase were prepared and allowed to equilibrate by shaking. At the indicated time, bacterially expressed Vav2 DH-PH-CRD (100 nm), Dbs DH-PH (150 nm), Tiam-1 DH-PH (150 nm), or Dbl DH-PH (150 nm) was added and the relative N-methylanthraniloyl fluorescence (excitation = 360 nm, emission = 455 nm) was monitored. Experiments were performed in triplicate. The DH-PH proteins were kind gifts from Drs. Michelle Booden (Vav2) and John Sondek (Dbs, Dbl, and Tiam1) (University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC). NIH 3T3 cells were transiently transfected with expression constructs encoding the indicated protein 24 h before they were fixed with paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with Triton X-100, stained with Texas Red-labeled phalloidin (Molecular Probes), and mounted on slides. Fluorescence microscopy was performed with a Zeiss Axioscope equipped with a MicroMAX 5-MHz cooled charge-coupled device camera (Princeton Instruments) and analyzed using Metamorph software (Universal Imaging Corp.). Assays for the nucleotide bound status of Cdc42, Rac1, and RhoA was performed as described previously (36Bagrodia S. Taylor S.J. Jordon K.A. Van Aelst L. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23633-23636Google Scholar, 37Ren X.D. Kiosses W.B. Schwartz M.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 578-585Google Scholar) by LipofectAMINE transfection of NIH 3T3 cells 24 h before they were lysed and subjected to pull-down assays with either GST-Pak1 PBD (for GTP-bound Cdc42 and Rac1) or GST-rhotekin RBD (for GTP-bound RhoA) bound to glutathione Sepharose beads, run on SDS-PAGE, gels and the subject to Western blot analysis with antibodies specific for Cdc42, Rac1, or RhoA (Transduction Laboratories). To control for equal cellular protein being used in each sample, total cell lysates were also run on gels and subjected to Western blot analysis for the Rho protein tested. Assays for activation of JNK, Akt, and Pak1 were done by transiently transfecting NIH 3T3 cells with the empty vector alone, or vectors encoding activated Rho proteins or GEFs, followed by 20 h of serum starvation in medium supplemented with 0.5% serum prior to lysis in SDS-PAGE sample buffer, separation by SDS-PAGE, and immunoblot analysis for phosphorylated and activated JNK or Akt with phospho-specific antibodies (Cell Signaling catalog number 9271 and 9255, respectively) and total JNK and Akt (Cell Signaling). For Pak1 activation assays, an expression vector for a Myc epitope-tagged Pak1 was co-transfected with the constructs to be tested, to increase the sensitivity of the assay. The remainder of the assay was done as described for JNK and Akt but with a phospho-specific Pak1 antibody (a kind gift from Dr. Jonathan Chernoff, Fox Chase Cancer Center, Philadelphia, PA) and a Myc epitope antibody (9E10, Sigma). Activation of serum response factor (SRF) and NF-κB was determined by co-transfecting the expression construct to be tested with reporter plasmids in which the luciferase gene is under the control of an SRF- or an NF-κB-responsive minimal promoter sequence 24 h before lysis of the cells and luciferase activity was analyzed using enhanced chemiluminescence reagents and a Monolight 2010 luminometer (Analytical Luminescence) as described previously (38Hauser C.A. Westwick J.K. Quilliam L.A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 255: 412-426Google Scholar). Extracellular stimuli cause activation of Rho GTPases most commonly through activation of Dbl-family proteins. Thus, to better understand the stimuli by which RhoG could be activated in cells, we evaluated the ability of a variety of Dbl family proteins to activate RhoG. For these analyses, we determined the ability of the isolated DH/PH domains of various Dbl family proteins to bind nucleotide-free RhoG or to stimulate the exchange of guanine nucleotide on wild-type RhoG in vitro (Fig. 1). Vav1 and Vav2 are two highly related GEFs for Rac and Cdc42 (26Abe K. Rossman K.L. Liu B. Ritola K.D. Chiang D. Campbell S.L. Burridge K. Der C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10141-10149Google Scholar, 32Liu B.P. Burridge K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7160-7169Google Scholar), and both bound strongly to RhoG and a DH-PH fragment of Vav2 efficiently stimulated guanine nucleotide exchange in vitro. The related RhoA and Cdc42 GEFs, Dbl and Dbs (28Whitehead I. Kirk H. Kay R. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 713-721Google Scholar, 39Srivastava S.K. Wheelock R.H. Aaronson S.A. Eva A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 8868-8872Google Scholar), both bound weakly to nucleotide-free RhoG, but only Dbs stimulated guanine nucleotide exchange activity on RhoG in vitro. Ect2 has been described as a RhoA and Rac-specific GEF (40Miki T. Smith C.L. Long J.E. Eva A. Fleming T.P. Nature. 1993; 362: 462-465Google Scholar) and it also bound weakly to nucleotide-free RhoG. In contrast, the Cdc42-specific GEF intersectin-L (41Guipponi M. Scott H.S. Chen H. Schebesta A. Rossier C. Antonarakis S.E. Genomics. 1998; 53: 369-376Google Scholar, 42Hussain N.K. Jenna S. Glogauer M. Quinn C.C. Wasiak S. Guipponi M. Antonarakis S.E. Kay B.K. Stossel T.P. Lamarche-Vane N. McPherson P.S. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 927-932Google Scholar) did not bind RhoG and the Rac-specific GEF Tiam1 (43Habets G.G. Scholtes E.H. Zuydgeest D. van der Kammen R.A. Stam J.C. Berns A. Collard J.G. Cell. 1994; 77: 537-549Google Scholar, 44Michiels F. Habets G.G. Stam J.C. van der Kammen R.A. Collard J.G. Nature. 1995; 375: 338-340Google Scholar) did not bind or stimulate the exchange of nucleotide on RhoG. Finally, the RhoA-specific exchange factors LARG (31Reuther G.W. Lambert Q.T. Booden M.A. Wennerberg K. Becknell B. Marcucci G. Sondek J. Caligiuri M.A. Der C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27145-27151Google Scholar) and Lfc (45Glaven J.A. Whitehead I.P. Nomanbhoy T. Kay R. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27374-27381Google Scholar) did not bind to RhoG. In the cases in which binding and exchange of nucleotide were both tested, we observed a direct correlation between the two assays for all the Rho proteins described. However, one exception involved Dbl, which did bind nucleotide-free RhoG in our assays, although surprisingly did not stimulate the exchange of nucleotide on wild-type RhoG. From these data, we concluded that RhoG can be activated by a variety of GEFs known to activate Rac and/or Cdc42. RhoG has been found previously not to interact with the Rac1 and/or Cdc42-specific effectors Pak1, WASP, and POR-1 when analyzed by two-hybrid binding assays (18Gauthier-Rouviere C. Vignal E. Meriane M. Roux P. Montcourier P. Fort P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 1379-1394Google Scholar). To further evaluate the ability of RhoG to interact with effectors of RhoA, Rac, and/or Cdc42, we performed pull-down analyses using bacterially expressed GST-tagged fusion proteins of activated mutants of Cdc42, Rac1, RhoG, and RhoA with lysates of cells in which Rho protein effectors had been transiently expressed (Fig. 2). Similar to previous observations, we found that RhoG did not bind Pak1 and WASP. In addition, it did not bind to Pak5, Pak6, PAR6, IRSp53, or POSH. Activated RhoG did, on the other hand, bind to the previously reported RhoG-binding fragment RhoGIP122, as well as the Rac/Cdc42-specific effectors MLK3, PLD1, and IQGAP2 (Fig. 2). All four of these interactions were shown to depend on GTP loading of the GTPase, because the binding to wild-type (GDP-loaded) RhoG was strongly diminished. These new potential RhoG effectors include both CRIB-domain containing (MLK3) and non-CRIB (IQGAP2 and PLD1) effectors. Furthermore, we could not detect RhoG binding to the RhoA effector rhotekin or the two RhoGAPs, p50 and p190 (data not shown). These data indicate that RhoG signals, in part, through some of the same downstream effectors as Cdc42 and Rac1. When transiently expressed as a GFP-tagged (Fig. 3) or an HA epitope-tagged (data not shown) protein in NIH 3T3 cells, an activated Q61L mutant (RhoG(61L)) (Fig. 3, C and D) gave a change in cell shape and actin organization similar to what was seen in cells expressing Rac1(61L) (Fig. 3, E and F). However, with Rac1(61L), lamellipodia formed in all directions around the periphery of the cell, whereas with RhoG(61L), lamellipodia often developed at several regions but were absent from one end of the cell, resulting in a more polarized appearance. In contrast, expression of Cdc42(61L) caused a limited formation of filopodia (Fig. 3,G and H), and when co-expressed with Rac1(61L) the two together were unable to reconstitute the polarized morphology of RhoG(61L)-expressing cells (Fig. 3, I and J). Interestingly, the RhoG(61L)-induced morphology is similar to what was seen when an activated mutant of Vav2, an activator of Cdc42, Rac1, and RhoG, was expressed in these cells (Fig. 3, K andL), indicating that Vav2 might mediate its morphological effects partly through activation of RhoG. These results suggest that RhoG, in part, might regulate cell protrusions by unique mechanisms that do not involve the activation of Rac1 and Cdc42. Pull-down analyses showed previously that transient overexpression of activated RhoG in PC12 cells caused activation of endogenous Rac1 and Cdc42, suggesting that in PC12 cells, these two GTPases are targets of downstream signaling from RhoG (19Katoh H. Yasui H. Yamaguchi Y. Aoki J. Fujita H. Mori K. Negishi M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7378-7387Google Scholar). We extended these analyses to a different cell type and also found that activated RhoG caused activation of endogenous Rac1 and Cdc42 (Fig.4). To verify the specificity of these activities, we also evaluated the consequences of activated GFP-tagged Rac1(61L) and Cdc42(61L). Surprisingly, these also promoted the apparent activation of endogenous Rac and Cdc42 (Fig. 4), indicating that the effect seen by exogenously expressed activated RhoG in our cells is either a nonspecific artifact of overexpression or possibly reflects a physiological feedback loop in which several Rac/Cdc42-like GTPases activate each other. In no case did RhoG(61L), Rac1(61L), or Cdc42(61L) have any effect on the GTP loading of endogenous RhoA (data not shown), indicating that overexpression of activated GTPases may only affect the GTP levels of closely related Rho proteins. Nevertheless, these observations question whether overexpression of activated mutants of GTPases followed by pull-down analysis is a reliable approach to determine whether one Rho GTPase activates another in a cascade. To further compare the downstream effector interactions of RhoG with those of Rac and Cdc42, we evaluated the ability of RhoG to activate the JNK mitogen-activated protein kinase, the Akt serine/threonine kinase, and the SRF and NF-κB nuclear transcription factors. NIH 3T3 cells were transiently transfected with either empty vector or expression vector plasmid DNAs encoding RhoG(61L), Rac1(61L), or the DH-PH domain fragment of the Rac-specific GEF Tiam1 and then assayed for the activation of the signaling pathways described above. We included Tiam1 because RhoG activation of Rac would likely involve activation of a Dbl-family protein. Whereas RhoG(61L) activated JNK and Akt to similar levels as Rac1(61L) (Fig5, A and B), only Rac1 significantly activated SRF- or NF-κB-dependent gene transcriptio"
https://openalex.org/W2076497809,"We previously found that oscillatory fluid flow activated MC3T3-E1 osteoblastic cell Ca2+imobilization via the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate pathway in the presence of 2% fetal bovine serum (FBS). However, the molecular mechanism of fluid flow-induced Ca2+i mobilization is unknown. In this study, we first demonstrated that oscillatory fluid flow in the absence of FBS failed to increase [Ca2+]i in MC3T3-E1 cells. Apyrase (10 units/ml), which rapidly hydrolyzes 5′ nucleotide triphosphates to monosphophates, prevented the fluid flow induced increases in [Ca2+]i in the presence of FBS. Adding ATP or UTP to flow medium without FBS restored the ability of fluid flow to increase [Ca2+]i, suggesting that ATP or UTP may mediate the effect of fluid flow on [Ca2+]i. Furthermore, adenosine, ADP, UDP, or adenosine 5′-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) did not induce Ca2+i mobilization under oscillatory fluid flow without FBS. Pyridoxal phosphate 6-azophenyl-2,4′-disulfonic acid, an antagonist of P2X purinoceptors, did not alter the effect of fluid flow on the Ca2+i response, whereas pertussis toxin, a Gi/o-protein inhibitor, inhibited fluid flow-induced increases in [Ca2+]i in the presence of 2% FBS. Thus, by the process of elimination, our data suggest that P2Y purinoceptors (P2Y2 or P2Y4) are involved in the Ca2+i response to fluid flow. Finally, a decreased percentage of MC3T3-E1 osteoblastic cells treated with P2Y2 antisense oligodeoxynucleotides responded to fluid flow with an increase in [Ca2+]i, and an increased percentage of ROS 17/2.8 cells, which do not normally express P2Y2 purinoceptors, transfected with P2Y2 purinoceptors responded to fluid flow in the presence of 2% FBS, confirming that P2Y2 purinoceptors are responsible for oscillatory fluid flow-induced Ca2+imobilization. Our findings shed new light of the molecular mechanisms responsible for oscillatory fluid flow-induced Ca2+i mobilization in osteoblastic cells.

Our findings shed new light of the molecular mechanisms responsible for oscillatory fluid flow-induced Ca2+i mobilization in osteoblastic cells. It is well known that mechanical loading of bone results in a variety of biophysical signals that may affect bone cellular metabolism and differentiation (1Donahue H.J.

One of these biophysical signals, extracellular fluid flow, has been demonstrated to be a potent stimulator of osteoblastic cell metabolic activity, differentiation, extracellular matrix protein production, and gene expression (4Ajubi N.E.

Recently we reported that oscillatory fluid flow in the presence of 2% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 1The abbreviations used are: FBS, fetal bovine serum; ATPγS, adenosine 5′-O-(3-thiotriphosphate); Ca2+i, intracellular calcium; MEM, minimal essential medium; N/m2, Newtons/meter2; P2Y2-AS, antisense oligodeoxynucleotides of P2Y2; P2Y2-SCR, scrambled control oligodeoxynucleotides of P2Y2. activated MC3T3-E1 osteoblastic cell intracellular calcium (Ca2+i) mobilization via the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate pathway and increased steady state levels of osteopontin, a bone extracellular matrix protein, mRNA in a Ca2+i-dependent manner (9You J. Reilly G.C. Zhen X. Yellowley C.E. Chen Q. Donahue H.J. Jacobs C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13365-13371Google Scholar). We and others (10Allen F.D. Hung C.T. Pollack S.R. Brighton C.T. J. Biomech. 2000; 33: 1585-1591Google Scholar) also found that extracellular signaling molecules present in FBS are necessary for fluid flow-induced increases in intracellular calcium ion concentration ([Ca2+]i) in bone cells. However, the nature of these signaling molecules, their receptors, and their roles in oscillatory fluid flow-induced Ca2+i mobilization are still unclear. Ca2+i is an early response second messenger that plays an important role in a number of intracellular signaling pathways and is typically observed to increase dramatically within seconds of stimulation. As a second messenger, Ca2+itransduces extracellular changes (i.e. first messenger) to the cell interior and potentially to the genome and is important in the regulation of a variety of cellular functions (11Hardingham G.E. Chawla S. Johnson C.M. Bading H. Nature. 1997; 385: 260-265Google Scholar). For instance, we previously demonstrated that oscillatory fluid flow regulates steady state osteopontin mRNA levels in a manner dependent on Ca2+i mobilization and via extracellular signal-regulated kinase and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways (9You J. Reilly G.C. Zhen X. Yellowley C.E. Chen Q. Donahue H.J. Jacobs C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13365-13371Google Scholar). In addition, other studies demonstrated that oscillations in intracellular Ca2+ regulate expression of transcription factors such as NFAT, NFκB, and Oct/OAP, which may be involved in cellular differentiation (12Dolmetsch R.E. Xu K. Lewis R.S. Nature. 1998; 392: 933-936Google Scholar, 13Li W. Llopis J. Whitney M. Zlokarnik G. Tsien R.Y. Nature. 1998; 392: 936-941Google Scholar). Thus, understanding the molecular mechanism of fluid-induced Ca2+i mobilization is a very important step elucidating mechanotransduction pathways in osteoblastic cells. It is well documented that extracellular nucleotides such as ATP and UTP induce a broad spectrum of cell responses including Ca2+i mobilization. These responses include excitation of sympathetic neurons, muscle cell proliferation, endothelial cell adhesion, spermiogenesis, acid-base equilibrium in intestinal epithelial cells, and mucociliary clearance in normal cystic fibrosis airway epithelia (14Boarder M.R. Hourani S.M. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1998; 19: 99-107Google Scholar, 15Anderson C.M. Parkinson F.E. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1997; 18: 387-392Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar, 16Communi D. Boeynaems J.M. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1997; 18: 83-86Google Scholar). It is also recognized that extracellular nucleotides act as important signaling molecules for cell-cell communication among bone cells (17Jorgensen N.R. Henriksen Z. Sorensen O.H. Eriksen E.F. Civitelli R. Steinberg T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7574-7580Google Scholar). Additionally there is increasing evidence that extracellular nucleotides play an important role in bone remodeling (18Dixon S.J. Sims S.M. Drug Dev. Res. 2000; 49: 187-200Google Scholar). Therefore, extracellular nucleotides are potential candidates responsible for fluid flow-induced Ca2+i mobilization in bone cells. The extracellular nucleotides ATP and UTP are known to exert their effects via a family of specific receptors termed P2 purinergic receptors (purinoceptors) (19Lambrecht G. Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Arch. Pharmacol. 2000; 362: 340-350Google Scholar, 20von Kugelgen I. Wetter A. Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Arch. Pharmacol. 2000; 362: 310-323Google Scholar). The P2 purinoceptors are divided into the P2X receptors, which are ligand-gated ion channels, and the P2Y receptors, which are G protein-coupled receptors. Up to seven P2X subtypes (P2X1-P2X7) and several types of P2Y receptors (P2Y1, P2Y2, P2Y4, P2Y6, P2Y11) have been cloned (19Lambrecht G. Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Arch. Pharmacol. 2000; 362: 340-350Google Scholar, 20von Kugelgen I. Wetter A. Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Arch. Pharmacol. 2000; 362: 310-323Google Scholar). P2 purinoceptors are expressed in osteoblastic cells of rat and human origin (21Schofl C. Cuthbertson K.S. Walsh C.A. Mayne C. Cobbold P. von zur Muhlen A. Hesch R.D. Gallagher J.A. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1992; 7: 485-491Google Scholar), and several studies have demonstrated that extracellular nucleotides such as ATP and ADP increase osteoblastic cell proliferation and differentiation through specific P2 purinoceptors (22Bowler W.B. Dixon C.J. Halleux C. Maier R. Bilbe G. Fraser W.D. Gallagher J.A. Hipskind R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14315-14324Google Scholar, 23Nakamura E. Uezono Y. Narusawa K. Shibuya I. Oishi Y. Tanaka M. Yanagihara N. Nakamura T. Izumi F. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2000; 279: 510-519Google Scholar). Thus, in this study we hypothesized that extracellular nucleotides such as ATP and UTP and their specific purinoceptors mediate oscillatory fluid flow-induced Ca2+i mobilization in osteoblastic cells. To test our hypothesis, we first utilized apyrase, an enzyme that quickly hydrolysis 5′ nucleotide triphosphates to monophosphates, to examine whether extracellular 5′ nucleotide triphosphates such as ATP and UTP are necessary for oscillatory fluid flow to induce Ca2+i mobilization in MC3T3-E1 osteoblastic cells. Secondly, different nucleotides and their agonists or antagonists were added to the fluid medium to investigate the possible involvement of different nucleotides responsible for oscillatory fluid flow-induced Ca2+i mobilization. We identified P2Y as the purinoceptors involved in the fluid flow-induced Ca2+i response. Finally, we employed molecular techniques to manipulate functional purinoceptor expression in osteoblastic cells to confirm that a specific purinoceptor, P2Y2, is involved in oscillatory fluid flow-induced Ca2+iresponses. The mouse osteoblastic cell line MC3T3-E1 was cultured in minimal essential α medium (MEM-α) (Invitrogen) containing 10% FBS (Hyclone, Logan, UT) and 1% penicillin and streptomycin (Invitrogen). The rat osteoblastic cell line ROS 17/2.8, which does not normally express P2Y2 receptors (24Jorgensen N.R. Geist S.T. Civitelli R. Steinberg T.H. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 497-506Google Scholar), was grown in minimal essential medium (MEM) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated calf serum (Hyclone), 0.1 mm nonessential amino acids, 1 mm sodium pyruvate (Invitrogen), 2 mml-glutamine, and 1% penicillin and streptomycin. ROS 17/2.8 cells transfected with human P2Y2 purinoceptors (ROS/P2Y2) were cultured in the same media as ROS 17/2.8 but with 400 μg/ml Geneticin (Invitrogen) added. All cells were maintained in a humidified incubator at 37 °C with 5% CO2. 0.85 × 105cells were subcultured on quartz slides for 2 days before experiments. The fluid flow chamber employed in this study is a parallel plate design, and the flow delivery device generated 1 Hz sinusoidally oscillating flow (peak shear stress 2 N/m2). Both have been described in previous studies (9You J. Reilly G.C. Zhen X. Yellowley C.E. Chen Q. Donahue H.J. Jacobs C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13365-13371Google Scholar, 25Jacobs C.R. Yellowley C.E. Davis B.R. Zhou Z. Cimbala J.M. Donahue H.J. J. Biomech. 1998; 31: 969-976Google Scholar). [Ca2+]i was quantified with the fluorescent dye fura-2. Fura-2 exhibits a shift in absorption when bound to Ca2+ such that the emission intensity when illuminated with ultraviolet light increases with [Ca2+]i at a wavelength of 340 nm and decreases with [Ca2+]i at 380 nm. The ratio of light intensity between the two wavelengths corresponds to [Ca2+]i. A calibration curve of intensity ratio and [Ca2+]i was obtained using fura-2 in buffered calcium standards supplied by the manufacturer (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR). Preconfluent (80%) cells were washed with MEM-α and 2% FBS at 37 °C, incubated with a 10 μmfura-2-acetoxymethyl ester (Molecular Probes) solution for 30 min at 37 °C, and washed again with fresh MEM-α and 2% FBS. The quartz slide with the cells was mounted on a parallel plate flow chamber filled with the experimental media. The chamber was placed on an inverted fluorescence microscope (Nikon, Melville, NY) and left undisturbed for 30 min before experiments. Cell ensembles were illuminated at wavelengths of 340 and 380 nm in turn. Emitted light was passed through a 510-nm interference filter and detected with an intensifier charge-coupled device camera (International LTD., Sterling, VA). Images were recorded once every 2 s and analyzed using image analysis software (Metafluor; Universal Imaging, West Chester, PA). Basal [Ca2+]i was sampled for 3 min and followed by 3 min of oscillatory fluid flow. Antisense oligodeoxynucleotides directed against P2Y2, 5′-CAG GTC TGC TGC CAT-3′ (P2Y2-AS), which had been demonstrated to inhibit P2Y2 purinoceptor function in astrocytes (26Stella N. Estelles A. Siciliano J. Tence M. Desagher S. Piomelli D. Glowinski J. Premont J. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 2939-2946Google Scholar), were employed to target the P2Y2 purinoceptor on MC3T3-E1 cells. Scrambled control oligodeoxynucleotides of P2Y2, 5′-GTG CTC GTA CGT ACC-3′ (P2Y2-SCR), were designed and synthesized at the Core Facilities of Pennsylvania State University College of Medicine. 8 × 104 MC3T3-E1 cells were precultured for 24 h and incubated in the presence of P2Y2-AS or P2Y2-SCR with LipofectAMINE PLUS (Invitrogen) for 2.5 h. After transfection, cells were cultured in fresh culture medium for another 24 h before fluid flow experiments. Cellular uptake of antisense oligodeoxynucleotides, which were labeled with fluorescein isothiocyanate at their 5′-end (Synthetic Genetics Inc., San Diego, CA), was verified by observation of fluorescein isothiocyanate with a fluorescence microscope. Five nucleotides (ATP, UTP, GTP, CTP, and TTP) were employed as extracellular signaling molecules in flow experiments. Apyrase (10 units/ml), an enzyme that rapidly hydrolyzes 5′ nucleotide triphosphates to monophosphates, was used to inhibit the nucleotides effects (27Homolya L. Steinberg T.H. Boucher R.C. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 1349-1360Google Scholar) and was applied 30 min before fluid flow. Different purinoceptor agonists (ADP, UDP, ATPγS, and adenosine) and antagonist (pyridoxal phosphate 6-azophenyl-2′,4′-disulfonic acid) were added to the experimental media to identify which specific purinoceptors were expressed on the MC3T3-E1 cells. Pertussis toxin (Calbiochem) was used to assess the role of Gi/o-proteins in the Ca2+i response to fluid flow. Cells were exposed to 200 ng/ml pertussis toxin in media for 90 min before fluid flow. To remove triphosphate contamination from diphosphate nucleotides, 1 mm stock solutions of UDP and ADP were pretreated with 10 units/ml hexokinase for 30 min at 37 °C in the presence of 5 mm glucose (28Lazarowski E.R. Paradiso A.M. Watt W.C. Harden T.K. Boucher R.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2599-2603Google Scholar). All the reagents were from Sigma unless otherwise indicated. We used a numerical procedure from mechanical analysis known as Rainflow cycle counting to identify calcium oscillations (29Jacobs C.R. Yellowley C.E. Nelson D.V. Donahue H.J. Computer Methods Biomech. Biomed. Eng. 2000; 3: 31-40Google Scholar). Briefly, this technique identifies complete cycles or oscillations in the time history data even when they are superimposed upon each other and, therefore, can be used to distinguish and quantify Ca2+i responses from background noise. We defined a response as an oscillation in [Ca2+]i at least 2-fold greater than that of the average base-line level of nontreated cells. Base-line [Ca2+]i data were recorded for each slide for 3 min before the application of oscillatory fluid flow. Data were expressed as the mean ± S.E. To compare observations from no flow and flow responses, a two-sample Student t test was used in which sample variance was not assumed to be equal. To compare observations from more than two groups, a one-way analysis of variance was employed followed by a Bonferroni selected-pairs multiple comparisons test (Instat, GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, CA).p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. To investigate the role of extracellular molecules in FBS or induced by FBS in fluid flow-induced Ca2+i mobilization, MC3T3-E1 cells were exposed to flow media with or without FBS (Fig. 1A). In the absence of 2% FBS, oscillatory fluid flow (2N/m2, 1Hz) induced an increase in [Ca2+]i in only 5.72 ± 1.44% of cells, a value not significantly different from that of cells during the no flow period (4.35 ± 1.31%) (p > 0.05) (Fig. 1C). However, within 30 s of starting oscillatory fluid flow with the media containing 2% FBS, 65.9 ± 3.94% of cells increased [Ca2+]i, a value significantly greater than the no flow control (5.96 ± 1.05%) (p < 0.01) (Figs. 1, B and C). In the presence of both 2% FBS and apyrase (10 units/ml), the percentage of cells responding with an increase in [Ca2+]i was 3.91 ± 1.62%, a value not significantly different from the percentage responding during the no flow period (2.64 ± 1.98%) (p > 0.05). As was the case with our previous studies (9You J. Reilly G.C. Zhen X. Yellowley C.E. Chen Q. Donahue H.J. Jacobs C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13365-13371Google Scholar), the average amplitude of [Ca2+]i in all responding cells during all oscillatory flow conditions was not significantly different from that of cells during no flow periods (data not shown). To examine whether extracellular nucleotide triphosphates are involved in fluid flow-induced Ca2+i mobilization, all five nucleotide triphosphates (ATP, UTP, GTP, CTP, and TTP) were added individually to the fluid flow medium to replace 2% FBS. In the presence of 5 μm ATP or UTP, exposure to oscillatory fluid flow resulted in 74.3 ± 5.59 or 75.5 ± 2.28%, respectively, of cells displaying an increased [Ca2+]i, whereas 1.19 ± 0.51 or 0.96 ± 0.57% of cells did so during no flow periods (p < 0.01) (Fig. 2). However, only 4.19 ± 1.52, 5.38 ± 2.13, or 3.52 ± 2.16% of cells responded to oscillatory fluid flow with an increased [Ca2+]i in the presence of CTP, GTP, TTP (5 μm), respectively, whereas 1.23 ± 1.0, 2.54 ± 1.64, or 1.23 ± 0.89%, respectively, of cells did so during control periods (p > 0.05). To identify which purinoceptors are responsible for oscillatory fluid flow and, potentially, extracellular signaling molecule-induced Ca2+i mobilization, purinoceptor agonists or antagonists were added to the flow medium. In the presence of adenosine (5–50 μm), a P1 purinoceptor agonist, oscillatory fluid flow did not induce increases in [Ca2+]i in a greater percentage of cells than the oscillatory flow control (no FBS) (3.53 ± 1.92% versus 4.34 ± 1.45%;p > 0.05) (Fig. 3). This was also the case in the presence of ATPγS (5–50 μm), a P2X and P2Y11 purinoceptor agonist (6.39 ± 3.23%versus 4.34 ± 1.45%; p > 0.05). Moreover, neither the specific P2Y1 purinoceptor agonist ADP (5–50 μm) nor the P2Y6 purinoceptor agonist UDP (5–50 μm) was able to increase the percentage of cells responding to oscillatory fluid flow above the percentage responding to oscillatory flow control (no FBS) (2.46 ± 1.23 and 4.38 ± 2.13%, respectively, versus 4.34 ± 1.45%;p > 0.05). In the presence of 2% FBS, pyridoxal phosphate 6-azophenyl-2′,4′-disulfonic acid (PPADS) (30 μm), a P2X antagonist, did not have any effect on the fluid flow-induced Ca2+i response relative to the oscillatory flow control (2% FBS) (64.3 ± 5.85 versus65.9 ± 3.94%; p > 0.05). However, pertussis toxin (PTX; 200 ng/ml), which inhibits Gi/oproteins, to which P2Y purinoceptors but not other purinoceptors are coupled dramatically reduced the percentage of cells responding to fluid flow (in the presence of 2% FBS) relative to the oscillatory flow control (in the presence of 2% FBS) (2.67 ± 2.16versus 65.9 ± 3.94%; p < 0.01). Our agonist and antagonist results suggested that P2Y purinoceptors contribute to oscillatory fluid flow-induced increases in [Ca2+]i. Therefore, we examined the function of P2 purinoceptors in MC3T3-E1 osteoblastic cells. The dependence of the rise in [Ca2+]i on ATP, UTP, ADP, and UDP concentration was assessed (Fig. 4), and the equipotency of ATP and UTP suggested P2Y2 purinoceptor expression in the MC3T3-E1 cells. To further confirm that P2Y2 purinoceptors are involved in fluid flow-induced Ca2+i mobilization, MC3T3-E1 cells were exposed to fluid flow in the presence of mouse P2Y2 antisense oligodeoxynucleotides. ATP (5 μm) increased [Ca2+]i in P2Y2-SCR-treated MC3T3-E1 cells but did so to a lesser degree in P2Y2-AS-treated cells (74.9 ± 3.36 nm versus 136.4 ± 6.29 nm, respectively, p < 0.01) (Fig. 5A). P2Y2-AS treatment significantly decreased the percentage of MC3T3-E1 cells responding to fluid flow with an increase in [Ca2+]i relative to P2Y2-SCR-treated cells (29.0 ± 9.03% versus65.3 ± 7.69%; p < 0.05) in the presence of 2% FBS (Fig. 5B). We next examined oscillatory fluid flow responsiveness in ROS 17/2.8 osteoblastic cells, which normally do not express P2Y2 purinoceptors, genetically engineered to express P2Y2 purinoceptors (24Jorgensen N.R. Geist S.T. Civitelli R. Steinberg T.H. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 497-506Google Scholar). Oscillatory fluid flow induced an increase in [Ca2+]i in significantly fewer wild type ROS 17/2.8 cells than in P2Y2 purinoceptors expressing ROS 17/2.8 cells (25.80 ± 6.0 versus 69.0 ± 5.87%;p < 0.01) (Fig. 6).Figure 5P2Y2-AS treatment inhibits oscillatory fluid flow induced increases in [Ca2+]i in MC3T3-E1 osteoblastic cells. A, when MC3T3-E1 cells were exposed to 5 μm ATP, the average increase in [Ca2+]i amplitude over basal in P2Y2-AS-treated cells was significantly reduced relative to P2Y2-SCR treated cells (**,p < 0.01). Each data point represents the mean ± S.E. of the response to applied agonists at each concentration,n = 77–79 cells. B, P2Y2-AS treatment significantly decreased the percentage of MC3T3-E1 cells responding to oscillatory (Osc.) fluid flow (2N/m2, 1 Hz) with an increase in [Ca2+]i relative to P2Y2-SCR-treated cells in the presence of 2% FBS (*, p< 0.05). Each bar represents the mean ± S.E., and each experiment was repeated on six slides.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Figure 6Exposure of oscillatory fluid flow increases [Ca2+]i in ROS 17/2.8 cells expressing the P2Y2 purinoceptors.

Turner C.H. Calcif. Tissue Int. 1995; 57: 344-358Google Scholar, 3van der Meulen M.C. Huiskes R. J. Biomech. 2002; 35: 401-414Google Scholar). Accumulating evidence suggests that extracellular fluid flow induced by mechanical loading is a potential physiological signal to trigger osteoblastic cell response to mechanical loading and may be a better candidate for transducing mechanical loads than other biophysical signals including substrate deformation and endogenous electric fields (6Owan I. Burr D.B. Turner C.H. Qiu J. Tu Y. Onyia J.E. Duncan R.L. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 1997; 42: C810-C815Google Scholar, 7Smalt R. Mitchell T. Howard R.L. Chambers T.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: E751-E758Google Scholar, 8You J. Yellowley C.E. Donahue H.J. Zhang Y. Chen Q. Jacobs C.R. J. Biomech. Eng. 2000; 122: 387-393Google Scholar, 30Hung C.T. Allen F.D. Pollack S.R. Brighton C.T. J. Biomech. 1996; 29: 1403-1409Google Scholar). Recently, we demonstrated that oscillatory fluid flow, which mimics fluid flow induced by mechanical loading in vivo, is a potent bone cell activator and induces Ca2+i release and increases osteopontin gene expression via extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 and p38 activation (9You J. Reilly G.C. Zhen X. Yellowley C.E. Chen Q. Donahue H.J. Jacobs C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13365-13371Google Scholar). Additionally the increased osteopontin expression is Ca2+i-dependent. However, the molecular mechanisms of fluid flow-induced Ca2+i mobilization are still unknown. Our findings are the first direct experimental evidence demonstrating that oscillatory fluid flow and the extracellular signaling molecules ATP and UTP, interacting with their specific P2Y purinoceptors, play an important role in bone cell mechanotransduction. Our data demonstrate that extracellular signaling molecules contribute to oscillatory fluid flow-induced Ca2+imobilization since oscillatory fluid flow did not activate Ca2+i mobilization in the absence of the extracellular signaling molecules present in FBS. This is consistent with prior studies that demonstrate that FBS modulates the Ca2+i response of primary cultured bone cells to steady fluid flow (10Allen F.D. Hung C.T. Pollack S.R. Brighton C.T. J. Biomech. 2000; 33: 1585-1591Google Scholar). In the absence of FBS steady fluid flow only minimally and inconsistently induced Ca2+imobilization in primary osteoblastic cells. Several lines of evidence suggest that ATP is involved in mechanically induced Ca2+i mobilization. For instance, steady fluid flow modulates the Ca2+i response to ATP in vascular endothelial cells (31Dull R.O. Davies P.F. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 261: H149-H154Google Scholar). Additionally, exposure of rat aortic smooth muscle cells to mechanical stretch (32Hamada K. Takuwa N. Yokoyama K. Takuwa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6334-6340Google Scholar) and rabbit endothelial cells (33Bodin P. Bailey D. Burnstock G. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1991; 103: 1203-1205Google Scholar) as well as human astrocytoma cells (34Lazarowski E.R. Homolya L. Boucher R.C. Harden T.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24348-24354Google Scholar) to fluid flow stimulates the release of ATP. In skeletal tissue ATP induces osteoblastic cell Ca2+i mobilization (35Shimegi S. Calcif. Tissue Int. 1996; 58: 109-113Google Scholar), and hydrostatic pressure stimulates ATP release from the chondocytes in pellet cultures. Finally, the addition of apyrase, which rapidly hydrolyzes 5′ nucleotide triphosphates to monophosphates, prevents mechanically induced Ca2+i wave propagation in polarized epithelia cultures (27Homolya L. Steinberg T.H. Boucher R.C. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 1349-1360Google Scholar). Taken together, these results suggest that extracellular nucleotides such as ATP may contribute to oscillatory fluid flow-induced Ca2+i mobilization in osteoblastic cells. Our results also demonstrate that two of the five nucleotide triphosphates, ATP and UTP, are able to restore the ability of fluid flow to increase [Ca2+]i in the absence of FBS, suggesting that ATP and UTP may mediate the effect of fluid flow on [Ca2+]i. Previous studies demonstrate that exposure of endothelial cells to steady fluid flow in the presence of ATP induces Ca2+i mobilization (31Dull R.O. Davies P.F. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 261: H149-H154Google Scholar, 36Yamamoto K. Korenaga R. Kamiya A. Ando J. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: 385-391Google Scholar). Additionally, it has been demonstrated that UTP is involved in the intracellular Ca2+ wave propagation induced by mechanical stimulation in polarized epithelia (27Homolya L. Steinberg T.H. Boucher R.C. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 1349-1360Google Scholar). Thus, our data as well as other studies suggest ATP and UTP are involved in mechanically induced Ca2+i mobilization. In this study, we demonstrated that P2Y receptors (P2Y2 or P2Y4) may be involved in the Ca2+i response to fluid flow by adding different purinoceptor agonists and antagonists to the flow media. Furthermore, treatment with P2Y2 antisense oligodeoxynucleotides decreased the percentage of MC3T3-E1 osteoblastic cells that respond to fluid flow with an increase in [Ca2+]i. Additionally, ROS 17/2.8 cells, which do not normally express P2Y2 purinoceptors, transfected with P2Y2 purinoceptors responded to fluid flow in the presence of 2% FBS, confirming the involvement of P2Y2 purinoceptors. Taken together, our data suggest that P2Y2 purinoceptors are responsible for oscillatory fluid flow-induced Ca2+i mobilization in osteoblastic cells. Similarly, P2Y2 purinoceptors have been demonstrated to be involved in mechanically induced Ca2+i wave propagation in airway epithelia in vitro (27Homolya L. Steinberg T.H. Boucher R.C. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 1349-1360Google Scholar). Although our antisense treatment of MC3T3-E1 cells significantly decreased the percentage of cells responding with an increases in [Ca2+]i, 29.0 ± 9.03% of the cells still responded to oscillatory fluid flow. Furthermore, antisense treatment only partially inhibited ATP-induced Ca2+imobilization. This suggests that P2Y2 purinoceptors were still being expressed after antisense treatment. Previous studies demonstrated that wild type ROS 17/2.8 cells, which lack P2Y2 purinoceptors, do not respond to steady fluid flow or ATP with an increase in [Ca2+]i (21Schofl C. Cuthbertson K.S. Walsh C.A. Mayne C. Cobbold P. von zur Muhlen A. Hesch R.D. Gallagher J.A. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1992; 7: 485-491Google Scholar, 37Allen F.D. Hung C.T. Pollack S.R. Brighton C.T. Cell. Eng. 1996; 1: 117-124Google Scholar). On the other hand, we found that oscillatory fluid flow induced an increase in [Ca2+]i in a very low percentage of ROS 17/2.8 cells, just over 25.8% of the cells exposed. The difference of our study and others may be due to a different source of ROS 17/2.8 cells and culture environment. It may also suggest that the other P2 purinoceptors expressed in ROS 17/2.8 cells may contribute to fluid flow-induced Ca2+i responses. Although our data suggest that P2Y purinoceptors are responsible for oscillatory fluid flow-induced Ca2+i mobilization in osteoblastic cells, other studies demonstrated that in human endothelial cells steady fluid flow in the presence of ATP activates Ca2+i influx via P2X purinoceptors (36Yamamoto K. Korenaga R. Kamiya A. Ando J. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: 385-391Google Scholar). This suggests that either endothelial cells utilize different purinoceptors for mechanotransduction or that steady fluid flow utilizes a different mechanism than oscillatory fluid flow. This emphasizes the importance of using a mechanical stimulus appropriate for the cells being examined when trying to elucidate mechanotransduction pathways. Furthermore, that endothelial cells may utilize different purinoceptors in mechanotransduction than do osteoblastic cells suggests that osteoblastic mechanotransduction pathways can be targeted, e.g. in developing bone anabolic agents, without affecting endothelial cell mechanotransduction. The physiological consequence of mechanically induced activation of the ATP/cytosolic Ca2+ pathway in osteoblastic cells is unclear. However, ATP, through an interaction with P2X purinoceptors, activates DNA synthesis in human osteoblastic MG-63 cells (23Nakamura E. Uezono Y. Narusawa K. Shibuya I. Oishi Y. Tanaka M. Yanagihara N. Nakamura T. Izumi F. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2000; 279: 510-519Google Scholar). Additionally ATP, acting through P2Y purinoceptors, modulates mesenchymal cell differentiation in vitro (38Meyer M.P. Swann K. Burnstock G. Clarke J.D. Dev. Dyn. 2001; 222: 494-505Google Scholar). These observations together with data suggesting that mechanical signals, including fluid flow, increase the expression of markers of osteoblastic differentiation (6Owan I. Burr D.B. Turner C.H. Qiu J. Tu Y. Onyia J.E. Duncan R.L. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 1997; 42: C810-C815Google Scholar, 39Carvalho R.S. Schaffer J.L. Gerstenfeld L.C. J. Cell.

Materials Eng. 1997; 7: 369-377Google Scholar) suggest that extracellular nucleotides may mediate the effect of mechanical signals, especially fluid flow, on bone cell differentiation. Several limitations should be considered when interpreting our results. For instance, although our results strongly suggest that P2Y2 purinoceptors are involved in fluid flow-induced Ca2+i mobilization, it is also likely the other P2Y purinoceptors, for instance P2Y4 purinoceptors, may be involved in Ca2+i mobilization. Therefore, the comprehensive characterization of all P2Y subtypes of osteoblastic cells and their roles in bone cell mechanotransduction is under way in our laboratory. From this study, it is still not clear whether extracellular nucleotides (ATP, UTP alone, or both) are released by cells after the cells sense oscillatory fluid flow or whether these nucleotides already exist locally around cells and are activated by fluid flow to induce Ca2+i mobilization. Further investigation of the dynamics of the extracellular nucleotide release during fluid flow is necessary. Finally, our P2Y purinoceptor results were conducted in two different osteoblastic cell lines. Therefore, it is likely that the results can be extrapolated to other osteoblastic cell lines including primary cultures. In summary, we have shown that extracellular nucleotides ATP and UTP are essential for oscillatory fluid flow-induced Ca2+i mobilization in osteoblastic cells in the presence of FBS. Furthermore, P2Y, specifically P2Y2, is the purinoceptor responsible for oscillatory fluid flow-induced Ca2+i mobilization. Taken together, these data suggest that oscillatory fluid flow acts through the interaction of the extracellular nucleotides ATP/UTP with P2Y (P2Y2 or P2Y4) purinoceptors to induce Ca2+i mobilization in osteoblastic cells. Our studies shed new light of the molecular mechanisms responsible for oscillatory fluid flow induced Ca2+i mobilization in osteoblastic cells. The understanding of molecular mechanisms of fluid flow-induced Ca2+i mobilization in osteoblastic cells will provide guidance in developing novel therapeutic approaches to various diseases such as disuse osteopenia and age-related osteoporosis.

https://openalex.org/W2092123647,"Several Rabs, including Rab11, regulate the traffic and sorting of proteins in the endosomal pathway. Recently, six novel Rab11 family interacting proteins (FIPs) were identified. Although they share little overall sequence homology, all FIPs contain a conserved Rab11-binding domain. Here we investigate the role of FIPs as Rab11-targeting proteins and show that the Rab11-binding domain assumes an α-helical structure, with the conserved residues forming a hydrophobic Rab11-binding patch. This hydrophobic patch mediates the formation of mutually exclusive complexes between Rab11 and various members of FIP protein family. Furthermore, the formation of Rab11/FIP complexes regulates Rab11 localization by recruiting it to distinct endocytic compartments. Thus, we propose that Rab11/FIP complexes serve as targeting patches, regulating Rab11 localization and recruitment of additional cellular factors to different endocytic compartments.

Members of the Rab GTPase family have emerged as important regulators of vesicular trafficking, with specific Rab proteins governing specific membrane trafficking steps (1Gonzalez Jr., L. Scheller R.H. Cell. 1999; 96: 755-758Google Scholar). Rab1 and Rab2 seem to regulate protein transport from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi (2Tisdale E.J. Bourne J.R. Khosravi-Far R. Der C.J. Balch W.E. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 749-761Google Scholar, 3Plutner H. Cox A.D. Pind S. Khosravi-Far R. Bourne J.R. Schwaninger R. Der C.J. Balch W.E. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 31-43Google Scholar), whereas Rab6 was shown to be important for intra-Golgi transport (4Martinez O. Schmidt A. Salamero J. Hoflack B. Roa M. Goud B. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1575-1588Google Scholar). At least six Rab proteins (Rabs 4, 5, 7, 9, 11, and 15) regulate trafficking and sorting of endocytosed material between endosomes, lysosomes, and the plasma membrane (5van der Sluijs P. Hull M. Webster P. Male P. Goud B. Mellman I. Cell. 1992; 70: 729-740Google Scholar, 6Ullrich O. Reinsch S. Urbe S. Zerial M. Parton R.G. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 913-924Google Scholar, 7Chavrier P. Goud B. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 466-475Google Scholar). Rab11, in particular, plays an essential role in protein recycling from endosomes to the plasma membrane (6Ullrich O. Reinsch S. Urbe S. Zerial M. Parton R.G. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 913-924Google Scholar). Furthermore, Rab11 has been implicated in regulating several other membrane transport pathways, including phagocytosis (8Cox D. Lee D.J. Dale B.M. Calafat J. Greenberg S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 680-685Google Scholar), apical targeting in epithelial cells (9Wang X. Kumar R. Navarre J. Casanova J.E. Goldenring J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29138-29146Google Scholar), insulin-dependent glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) transport to plasma membrane (10Kessler A. Tomas E. Immler D. Meyer H.E. Zorzano A. Eckel J. Diabetologia. 2000; 43: 1518-1527Google Scholar), and protein transport from endosomes to the trans-Golgi network (11Wilcke M. Johannes L. Galli T. Mayau V. Goud B. Salamero J. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 1207-1220Google Scholar). Despite considerable effort, the mechanism of Rab11 action remains to be fully understood. Cycling between GTP- and GDP-bound forms of Rab proteins is suggested to regulate the recruitment of various effectors to cellular membranes, thereby affecting the targeting and fusion of transport vesicles (12Bourne H.R. Sanders D.A. McCormick F. Nature. 1991; 349: 117-127Google Scholar). Thus, the ability of Rabs to interact with several different effector molecules, which are localized in different trafficking pathways, could be the basis for the specific functions of Rab proteins in a variety of cellular processes. Consistent with the role of Rab11 in multiple membrane traffic pathways, several Rab11-interacting proteins have been identified. Using yeast two-hybrid experiments, it has been shown that Rab11 interacts with the myosin Vb globular tail domain, suggesting that Rab11 may regulate the membrane traffic by docking the myosin motor to transferrin receptor-containing transport vesicles (13Lapierre L.A. Kumar R. Hales C.M. Navarre J. Bhartur S.G. Burnette J.O. Provance Jr., D.W. Mercer J.A. Bahler M. Goldenring J.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1843-1857Google Scholar). Another Rab11-binding protein, Rab11BP/Rabphilin-11, has also been shown to regulate transferrin receptor delivery to recycling endosomes (RE) 1The abbreviations used are: RE, recycling endosomes; FIP, Rab11 family interacting protein; RBD, Rab11-binding domain; GST, glutathione S-transferase; GFP, green fluorescent protein; Tf, transferrin; TxR, Texas Red; EE, early endosome. 1The abbreviations used are: RE, recycling endosomes; FIP, Rab11 family interacting protein; RBD, Rab11-binding domain; GST, glutathione S-transferase; GFP, green fluorescent protein; Tf, transferrin; TxR, Texas Red; EE, early endosome.

In addition, we and others have recently identified six novel Rab11-interacting proteins belonging to a family of proteins known as the family of Rab11-interacting proteins (FIPs) (16Walace D.M. Lindsay A.J. Hendrick A.G. McCaffrey M.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 292: 909-915Google Scholar, 17Lindsay A.J. Hendrick A.G. Cantalupo G. Senic-Matuglia F. Goud B. Bucci C. McCafrey M.W.

Chem. 2001; 276: 39067-39075Google Scholar). Although they share little overall sequence homology, all FIP proteins contain a conserved Rab11-binding domain (RBD) at the C terminus of the protein (19Prekeris R. Davies J.M. Scheller R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38966-38970Google Scholar). Although RBD is necessary for Rab11 binding (19Prekeris R. Davies J.M. Scheller R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38966-38970Google Scholar), the essential elements of the Rab11-binding domain remain to be defined. Furthermore, the role of FIP proteins in membrane traffic is unclear. Given that most mammalian cells express several FIP proteins, one possible role of FIP proteins could be the formation of mutually exclusive complexes with Rab11, thereby directing the recruitment of Rab11 to different membrane traffic pathways. Indeed, the finding that all FIPs seem to contain equivalent, highly conserved Rab11-binding domains is consistent with that idea. In this study, we characterized the impact of Rab11/FIP binding on endocytic traffic. We showed that the RBD assumes an α-helical structure, with the conserved residues forming a hydrophobic, Rab11-binding patch. In addition, we demonstrated that FIPs compete with each other for binding to Rab11 in vitroand form mutually exclusive complexes with Rab11 in vivo. Finally, we showed that FIP proteins regulate Rab11 localization by recruiting it to distinct membranous organelles. Thus, we propose that Rab11/FIP complexes serve as targeting patches regulating Rab11 localization and recruitment of additional cellular factors to different endocytic compartments. HeLa cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum and 2 mml-glutamine. HeLa cells were transiently transfected using an electroporation procedure as described previously (19Prekeris R. Davies J.M. Scheller R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38966-38970Google Scholar). Polyclonal rabbit anti-Rip11 antibody was described previously (18Prekeris R. Klumperman J. Scheller R.H. Mol Cell. 2000; 6: 1437-1448Google Scholar). Polyclonal rabbit anti-FIP2, anti-Eferin, and anti-Rab11 antibodies were prepared by immunization with recombinant FIP2 (490–624), Eferin (600–759), and full-length Rab11a, respectively. All recombinant proteins were expressed as GST fusion proteins as described previously (21Prekeris R. Klumperman J. Chen Y.A. Scheller R.H. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 957-971Google Scholar). Rabbit polyclonal anti-GFP antibody was obtained from Clontech Inc. Mouse monoclonal anti-myc (9E10) antibody was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Texas Red and fluorescin-conjugated secondary antibodies were obtained from Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories. Texas Red-labeled transferrin was obtained from Molecular Probes. cDNAs encoding Rip11, FIP2, and Eferin were fused to the C terminus of pEGFP-N3 vector (Clontech). cDNA encoding Rip11 (490–652) was fused to the N terminus of pEGFP-C1 (Clontech) or pCMV-Tag3a (Stratagene) vectors. GST gene fusion constructs were made by cloning Rab11a, FIP2, Eferin, and Rip11a fragments into pGEX-KG (Amersham Biosciences) and transforming them into BL-21 codon + Escherichia coli (Stratagene). GST proteins were expressed and purified using glutathione beads as described previously (21Prekeris R. Klumperman J. Chen Y.A. Scheller R.H. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 957-971Google Scholar). GST-fusion proteins were eluted from glutathione column by thrombin cleavage. Soluble proteins were then repurified using a size-exclusion S200 column (Pharmacia). The fractions containing the protein of interest were pooled and checked for purity by separating on SDS-PAGE, followed by Coomassie Blue staining. The molecular weight of purified proteins was determined by mass spectroscopy (University of Colorado Health Sciences Center core facilities). The molar extinction coefficient (E280) for each protein was calculated using UV spectrophotometry by absorption at 205- and 280-nm wavelengths as described previously (32Stoscheck C.M. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 182: 50-69Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined either by Bradford assay (33Bradford M.M. Anal Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Google Scholar) (in vitro binding experiments) or using E280 and absorption at 280 nm (CD experiments). In vitro binding assays were performed using 25 μl of packed glutathione beads coated with 20 μg of GST-fusion protein in a final volume of 500 μl and varying amounts of soluble proteins. Reaction buffer consisted of 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mmNaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mmCaCl2, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1.5 μmpepstatin. Guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate or guanosine 5′-O-(2-thio)diphosphate were added where indicated. Reactions were kept suspended at room temperature for 30 min, pelleted at 2000 × g for 3 min, and washed three times in 1 ml of reaction buffer without bovine serum albumin but with 100 nm guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate or guanosine 5′-O-(2-thio)diphosphate, as necessary. Bound proteins were eluted with 1% SDS. Proteins were separated on SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie Blue or immunoblotted. Gels were imaged using a Bio-Rad gel documentation system and quantified using Quantity One software (version 4.1.1; Bio-Rad). CD spectra and thermal melts were recorded on a Jasco J-810 spectrophotometer equipped with a thermoelectric temperature controller. Measurements were made using a 0.1-cm path-length quartz cuvette. Thermal unfolding experiments were performed by measuring the CD signal at 222 nm (1 min averaging time) in 2 °C steps. Data were converted to a fraction of folded protein by fitting the lower and upper base lines as 0 and 100% folded, respectively. HeLa cells were grown to 70% confluence on four 100-mm plates. Cells were then scraped off in phosphate-buffered saline, washed, and resuspended in homogenization medium (0.25 msucrose, 78 mm KCl, 8.37 mm CaCl2, 10 mm EGTA, 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, and 4 mm MgCl2). Cells were ruptured using 20 strokes of a Dounce homogenizer. Pellet debris and nuclei were sedimented at 1,000 × g. A 5–20% iodixanol gradient was formed using a two-chamber gradient maker, and 1,000 × gsupernatants were loaded on top of the gradient. Gradient was centrifuged at 90,000 × g for 18 h. Gradient was then collected in 24 0.5-ml fractions and analyzed by immunoblotting. For immunofluorescence microscopy, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min. Cells were then permeabilized with 0.4% saponin, and nonspecific sites were blocked with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.2% bovine serum albumin, 0.4% saponin, and 1% fetal bovine serum. After incubation with antibodies, samples were extensively washed and mounted in VectaShield (Vector Laboratories). Cells were imaged with inverted Zeiss Axiovert 200 M deconvolution microscope. Image processing was done using Intelligent Imaging Innovations three-dimensional rendering and exploration software. For quantitation of colocalization of transiently transfected HeLa cells, only cells expressing low amounts of protein were used. The cells were considered low expressers when the fluorescence of GFP-tagged protein was similar (no more then 2-fold higher) to the fluorescence obtained from the antibodies against the endogenous protein with which it was being costained. All images were digitally deconvolved before the analysis. The background fluorescence was calculated by imaging an empty field. The background fluorescence was then subtracted from all the images before quantitation. For analysis of transferrin recycling, HeLa cells were plated on collagen-coated glass coverslips and grown to 60% confluence. Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C in serum-free, HEPES-buffered, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 20 μg/ml of Texas Red-conjugated transferrin (Molecular Probes). Cells were then washed extensively, returned to 37 °C, and incubated in serum-supplemented Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.2 mg/ml of unlabeled transferrin. At each time point, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and imaged using an inverted Zeiss Axiovert 200 M deconvolution microscope. Since the identification of Rip11 (18Prekeris R. Klumperman J. Scheller R.H. Mol Cell. 2000; 6: 1437-1448Google Scholar), the family of Rab11-interacting proteins has grown to include six members: Rip11, FIP2, RCP, Eferin, FIP4, and FIP1 (Fig. 1A) (16Walace D.M. Lindsay A.J. Hendrick A.G. McCaffrey M.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 292: 909-915Google Scholar, 18Prekeris R. Klumperman J. Scheller R.H. Mol Cell. 2000; 6: 1437-1448Google Scholar, 19Prekeris R. Davies J.M. Scheller R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38966-38970Google Scholar, 20Hales C. Griner R. Hobdy-Henderson K. Dorn M. Hardy D. Kumar R. Navarre J. Chan E. Lapierre L. Goldenring J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39067-39075Google Scholar). Based on sequence homology, all FIPs can be divided into three classes (Fig. 1A). Class I FIPs (Rip11 and FIP2) contain a C2 domain at the N-terminal end of the protein. Class II FIPs (Eferin and FIP4) contain two EF-hand domains. Class III includes only one member, FIP1, which exhibits no homology to known protein domains. The common feature of all FIP proteins is the presence of a highly conserved, 20-amino acid motif at the C terminus of the protein, known as Rab11/25 binding domain (RBD) (19Prekeris R. Davies J.M. Scheller R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38966-38970Google Scholar). Although this domain has been shown to be necessary and sufficient for binding to Rab11 and Rab25, it is unlikely that the RBD represents the entire Rab11- and FIP-interacting interface. Indeed, Rab11 binding to an RBD peptide is not GTP-dependent (19Prekeris R. Davies J.M. Scheller R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38966-38970Google Scholar). Furthermore, Rab11 binding affinity to the RBD peptide is measured in the millimolar range (data not shown), suggesting that other motifs may be important for mediating Rab11 binding. Interestingly, in addition to the RBD domain, all FIPs also contain a predicted α-helix at the C terminus of the protein (Fig. 1A). To test whether these helices might be important for Rab11 binding, we created Rip11 (490–652), FIP2 (378–511), and Eferin (665–759) truncation mutants that contained only RBD domain and predicted α-helix. CD analysis of Rip11 (490–652) (Fig. 2, D,F, and G) and FIP2 (378–511) (data not shown) confirmed that the C termini of both these proteins are highly structured (melting temperature, 68 °C) and predominantly α-helical. To test whether the α-helix is required for Rip11 binding to Rab11, we incubated GST-Rip11 (490–652)-coated glutathione beads with increasing concentrations of soluble recombinant Rab11a. As shown in the Fig. 1, B and C, addition of an α-helical motif to RBD increased the relative binding of Rip11 binding to Rab11 (EC50, 5 μm) but not Rab4. Furthermore, Rip11 (490–652) binding to Rab11 was GTP-dependent (Fig. 1B, inset), compared with Rip11 (630–652), which contains only the RBD domain (19Prekeris R. Davies J.M. Scheller R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38966-38970Google Scholar). Similar binding affinities (Fig. 1B) and GTP-dependence (data not shown) were also observed for FIP2 (378–511) and Eferin (665–759).Figure 2Hydrophobic patch formed by RBD domain is required for Rip11 and Rab11 interactions.

B, recombinant Rab11a was incubated with glutathione beads coated with either GST or various GST-Rip11 (490–652) mutants. Bound Rab11 was visualized by immunoblotting with anti-Rab11 antibodies. C–G, Rab11-Rip11 (490–652) complex was formed using glutathione beads coated with GST-Rip11 (490–652). Complex was then eluted by thrombin cleavage and analyzed by either by Coomassie Blue staining (C) or CD spectroscopy (D–G). D, CD spectra of Rip11 (490–652), Rab11a, and Rip11 (490–652)-Rab11 complex were gathered at 37 °C. Rab11+Rip11 represents added Rip11 (490–652) and Rab11a individual spectra. All proteins used for CD analysis were repurified using gel-filtration chromatography (inset).G, the protein folding was monitored at 222-nm wavelengths. The data were converted to a fraction of folded protein by fitting the lower and upper base lines as 0 and 100% folded, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Despite the apparent requirement of an α-helical domain for Rab11 binding, there is little sequence homology among FIP proteins outside of the RBD domain. Thus, how the specificity for Rab11 is encoded within the FIP family of proteins remains unclear. One possibility is that RBD must be in the helical conformation to mediate Rab11-FIP interactions efficiently. Indeed, RBD does overlap with the last two heptads of the α-helical domain. Furthermore, when plotted in the α-helical conformation, all conserved hydrophobic residues of the RBD domain form a hydrophobic patch (Fig. 2A, black). Substitution of the central isoleucine (Fig. 2A,asterisk) with glutamic acid (I629E) completely abolished Rab11 binding, whereas a conservative substitution with valine (I629V) had no effect on Rip11 association to Rab11 (Fig. 2B). The data presented above suggest that the RBD in its α-helical conformation, mediates FIP protein binding to Rab11 GTPase. To determine the stoichiometry of the FIP-Rab11 complex, we purified a Rab11-Rip11 (490–652) complex and subjected it to SDS-PAGE and CD analysis. As shown in the Fig. 2C, Rab11 and Rip11 form a complex with 1:1 stoichiometry. Interestingly, CD analysis of the Rab11-Rip11 (490–652) complex suggests that the binding of Rip11 to Rab11 results in the induction of additional α-helices in one or both binding partners (Fig. 2D). This also results in stabilization of the protein structure, indicated by an increase in the Rab-Rip11 complex melting temperature (77.9 ± 1.48 °C) compared with Rab11a (72.3 ± 0.35 °C) and Rip11 (490–652) (68.9 ± 0.202 °C) alone (Fig. 2, E, F, and G). Because Rip11 interacts with Rab11 via RBD domain with 1:1 stoichiometry, we investigated the possibility that various FIPs form mutually exclusive complexes with Rab11. To test this, we measured Rab11 binding to GST-Rip11 (490–652) and GST-Eferin (665–759) in the presence of increasing concentrations of soluble Rip11 (490–652). As shown in Fig. 3K, soluble Rip11 (490–652) inhibited Rab11 binding to Rip11 and to Eferin in a concentration-dependent manner, suggesting that FIP proteins compete for Rab11 binding. That, however, does not discount the possibility that individual Rab11/FIP complexes may oligomerize, thus forming large protein complexes that include several different FIPs. Indeed, Rip11, as well as some other FIP proteins, have been shown to form dimers in a Rab11-independent manner (16Walace D.M. Lindsay A.J. Hendrick A.G. McCaffrey M.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 292: 909-915Google Scholar). 2J. Meyers and R. Prekeris, unpublished data. To address that possibility, we immunoprecipitated Rip11 from HeLa cells and immunoblotted precipitants for the presence of Eferin protein. As shown in Fig. 3L, neither Eferin nor FIP2 coprecipitated with Rip11 protein complex (left). Rip11 and Eferin did coprecipitate with Rab11, suggesting that both FIPs do bind Rab11 in vivo. These data indicate that FIP2, Eferin, and Rip11 form mutually exclusive complexes with Rab11. Considering the fact that FIPs compete with each other for binding to Rab11, they would be expected to “share” cellular Rab11. Indeed, myc-Rab11a only partially colocalized with any individual FIP, such as Rip11 (36.5 ± 1.39%) and Eferin (22.73 ± 0.32%), in transiently transfected HeLa cells (Figs. 3, A–D, and4G). That colocalization was dependent on Rab11 activity, because a dominant-negative Rab11a mutant (S25N) showed very little colocalization with either Rip11 (4.34 ± 2.98%) or Eferin (6.77 ± 1.98%) (Figs. 3J and4G). To determine whether various FIPs are localized to the same cellular membranes, we transfected HeLa cells with Rip11-GFP and immunostained them with anti-Eferin antibodies. As shown in Fig. 3,E and F, Rip11 and Eferin localized to different organelles with very little overlap between them (8.1 ± 4.3%). Thus, Rip11 and Eferin seemed to play roles in distinct Rab11-dependent membrane traffic pathways. Consistent with that, brefeldin A treatment resulted in tubulation of Rip11-containing organelles, but had little effect on Eferin-containing membranes (Fig. 3, G and H). Interestingly, not all FIPs were segregated onto distinct endocytic compartments. Although Rip11 and FIP2 also formed mutually exclusive complexes with Rab11 (data not shown), they did exhibit some overlap (54 ± 6.2%) (Fig. 3I). Immunofluorescence analysis of FIP proteins suggests that they may be localized to overlapping but distinct subpopulations of endosomes. To test that, membranes from HeLa cells were separated using preformed linear 5–20% iodixanol gradient (Fig. 4A) and immunoblotted for the presence of Rip11, FIP2, and Eferin (Fig. 4B). Consistent with immunofluorescence microscopy data, all FIP proteins were present in the fractions containing endosomal membranes and displayed overlapping but distinct distribution patterns. Given the fact that FIPs compete with each other for binding to Rab11, it would be expected that overexpression of any FIP should increase its colocalization with Rab11 GTPase. Indeed, transient expression of Eferin-GFP (Fig. 4, C and D) or Rip11-GFP (Fig. 4, E and F) significantly increased their colocalization with Rab11 (Fig. 4G). Furthermore, a similar effect was also obtained by overexpressing GFP-Rip11 (490–653) (Fig. 4G). Interestingly, overexpression of Rip11 (490–653) caused extensive tubulation of Rab11-positive endocytic membranes (Fig. 5, A and B). Consistent with the mutually exclusive complex formation of FIPs with Rab11, those tubules were devoid of Eferin (Fig. 5C) and FIP2 (Fig. 5D). Thus, overexpression of Rip11 and Eferin, and especially Rip11 (490–653), seemed to sequester most of the Rab11 away from other FIP proteins. To our surprise, overexpression of GFP-Rip11 (490–653) did not change the localization of endogenous Eferin and FIP2. Despite that, Eferin and FIP2 showed very little colocalization with Rab11 (Fig. 5G); they were still localized to punctuate membranous structures (Fig. 5, C andD). Thus, membrane association of FIP2 and Eferin seemed to be independent of Rab11 binding, suggesting that Rab11 was not involved in recruiting FIP proteins to their corresponding endocytic compartment. To test whether Rab11 was required for FIP binding to membranes, we transfected HeLa cells with GFP-Rip11 (490–653)-I629E construct. Because the I629E mutation eliminates Rip11 binding to Rab11 (Fig. 2B), the localization of Rip11 (490–653)-I629E would be independent of Rab11 association. As shown in the Fig. 5F, GFP-Rip11 (490–653)-I629E did localize to Rab11-positive structures in the cell periphery but had no effect on Rab11 distribution (Fig. 5E). Furthermore, whereas I629E mutation inhibited coprecipitation of GFP-Rip11 (490–653) with Rab11, GFP-Rip11 (490–653)-I629E mutants were still capable of binding to cellular membranes (Fig. 5H). We must note, however, that the I629E mutation increased the amount of GFP-Rip11 (490–653) present in the cytosol (data not shown; Fig. 5, F and H). Thus, whereas Rip11 (490–653) can be targeted to membranes independently of Rab11, Rab11 might be required to stabilize Rip11 association with membranes. Our data suggested that FIP proteins might play a role in targeting Rab11 to different endocytic compartments by competing with each other for binding to Rab11. Thus, overexpression of Rip11 (490–653) would be expected to inhibit Rab11-dependent membrane traffic by sequestering Rab11. To test this, we took advantage of a well characterized transferrin (Tf) recycling assay (22De Renzis S. Sonnichsen B. Zerial M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 124-133Google Scholar). Endocytosed Tf is sequentially transported through Rab5, Rab4, and Rab11 compartments before being delivered to the plasma membrane (23Sonnichsen B. De Renzis S. Nielsen E. Rietdorf J. Zerial M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 901-914Google Scholar, 24Daro E. van der Sliujis P. Galli T. Mellman I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9559-9564Google Scholar). The Tf transport throughout different recycling compartments can be followed by using Texas Red-conjugated Tf (Tf-TxR). First, Tf-TxR was bound to plasma membrane Tf receptors by incubating HeLa cells with Tf-TxR at 4 °C for 1 h. Tf-TxR internalization was then initiated by shifting cells to 37 °C. After 5 min, the majority of Tf-TxR was localized to large peripheral endosomes (Fig. 6A). These compartments also stained for EEA1 (data not shown), thus confirming their identity as early endosomes (EE). After 20 min of incubation at 37 °C, some of the Tf-TxR moved to perinuclear compartment (Fig. 6B). This compartment stained for Rab11, and therefore represented RE. Finally, after 60 min of incubation at 37 °C most of the Tf-TxR moved to RE, with trace staining left on EE (Fig. 6C). To test whether Rip11 (490–653) had any effect on Tf traffic, we transfected HeLa cells with GFP-Rip11 (490–653) (Fig. 6E,green, and G, green) and then followed Tf-TxR transport through EE and RE. After 5 min of internalization, Tf-TxR could be detected in peripheral EE, proving that Rip11 (490–653) had no effect on Tf-TxR endocytosis and delivery to EE (Fig. 6, D and E). Overexpression of GFP-Rip11 (490–653), however, did inhibit Tf-TxR delivery to RE. Even after 60 min of incubation at 37 °C, Tf-TxR remained largely confined to EE (Fig. 6F). Rip11 (490–653)-induced tubules remained largely devoid of any transferrin receptor-TxR (Fig. 6G). Rip11 (490–653) effect was dependent on Rab11 binding because GFP-Rip11 (490–653)-I629E did not inhibit Tf-TxR transport to RE (Fig. 6,H-J). Thus, overexpression of Rip11 (490–653) seemed to inhibit transport from EE to RE, presumably by sequestering Rab11 and making it unavailable for other Rab11 effectors. The key step in understanding endocytic transport is characterization of interactions between Rab GTPase and its binding partners. The identification of multiple Rab11 binding proteins presents a challenge in determining how Rab11 regulates protein transport between plasma membrane and endocytic compartments. One possibility is that several Rab11-interacting proteins form a large protein complex that is involved in coordinating the sequential transport of cargo through various endocytic domains. Our data, however, suggest the existence of several distinct Rab11-containing complexes. The finding that FIP family proteins form mutually exclusive complexes with Rab11 suggests that FIPs play an essential role in regulating the assembly and cellular localization of Rab11-targeting patches. Rab11 has been implicated in the regulation of multiple membrane traffic pathways, including phagocytosis (8Cox D. Lee D.J. Dale B.M. Calafat J. Greenberg S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 680-685Google Scholar), insulin-dependent GLUT4 trafficking (10Kessler A. Tomas E. Immler D. Meyer H.E. Zorzano A. Eckel J. Diabetologia. 2000; 43: 1518-1527Google Scholar), apical transport in epithelial cells (9Wang X. Kumar R. Navarre J. Casanova J.E. Goldenring J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29138-29146Google Scholar), and EE-to-trans-Golgi network transport (11Wilcke M. Johannes L. Galli T. Mayau V. Goud B. Salamero J. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 1207-1220Google Scholar). Thus, it is tempting to speculate that different Rab11/FIP complexes may regulate distinct membrane transport steps/pathways. Consistent with this, various FIPs have different tissue expression patterns. For instance, Rip11 is enriched in kidney epithelial cells (18Prekeris R. Klumperman J. Scheller R.H. Mol Cell. 2000; 6: 1437-1448Google Scholar), whereas FIP4 seems to be expressed almost exclusively in brain tissue (25Nagase T. Ishikawa K. Suyama M. Kikuno R. Hirosawa M. Miyajima N. Tanaka A. Kotani H. Nomura N. Ohara O. DNA Res. 1998; 5: 355-364Google Scholar). In addition, we demonstrated here that Rip11, Eferin, and FIP2 had an overlapping but distinctly different cellular distribution patterns. Finally, previous studies implicated the involvement of FIP1, Rip11, and FIP2 in different membrane transport pathways (18Prekeris R. Klumperman J. Scheller R.H. Mol Cell. 2000; 6: 1437-1448Google Scholar, 20Hales C. Griner R. Hobdy-Henderson K. Dorn M. Hardy D. Kumar R. Navarre J. Chan E. Lapierre L. Goldenring J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39067-39075Google Scholar, 26Lindsay A.J. McCaffrey M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 27193-27199Google Scholar). The classical Rab effector proteins are recruited to appropriate plasma membranes through binding to Rab GTPases (1Gonzalez Jr., L. Scheller R.H. Cell. 1999; 96: 755-758Google Scholar). Surprisingly, our data revealed that FIP proteins did not require Rab11 for membrane binding. Indeed, overexpression of a dominant-negative Rab11 mutant (Fig. 3J) or Rip11 (490–653) (Fig. 5, C andD) had no effect on membrane binding of endogenous FIP2, Rip11, and Eferin. Furthermore, the Rab11 binding mutant, Rip11 (490–653)-I629E, was still localized to Rab11-containing endosomes (Fig. 5F), although with somewhat lower efficiency. These observations raise an interesting possibility that FIPs may play a role in targeting Rab11 to the appropriate endocytic compartments. Consistent with that, overexpression of Rip11-GFP, FIP2-GFP, or GFP-Rip11 (490–652) dramatically changed Rab11 distribution by sequestering Rab11 GTPase in a subpopulation of endocytic membranes (Fig. 5, A–D, and G). What is the function of FIP proteins? One possibility is that they play a role as Rab11 scaffolding proteins. Indeed, although Rabs bind to membranes via geranylgeranyl groups attached to a C terminus of the protein, how Rabs are targeted to specific cellular compartments remains unclear. With their differential distribution and Rab11-independent membrane binding, FIPs would be good candidates to play a role of Rab11 scaffolding proteins. Another possibility is that Rab11/FIP protein complexes are the essential components of targeting patches involved in recruitment of additional cellular factors. Other Rab GTPases, namely Rab5 and Rab27, were also reported to form similar targeting patches by binding to EEA1 and melanophilin, respectively (22De Renzis S. Sonnichsen B. Zerial M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 124-133Google Scholar, 27Zerial M. McBride H. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 107-117Google Scholar, 28Wu X. Wang F. Rao K. Sellers J.R. Hammer 3rd., J.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 1735-1749Google Scholar, 29Wu X.S. Rao K. Zhang H. Wang F. Sellers J.R. Matesic L.E. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Hammer 3rd., J.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 271-278Google Scholar). Recent reports show that both Rab11 and FIP2 are involved in recruiting myosin Vb to transport vesicles (13Lapierre L.A. Kumar R. Hales C.M. Navarre J. Bhartur S.G. Burnette J.O. Provance Jr., D.W. Mercer J.A. Bahler M. Goldenring J.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1843-1857Google Scholar, 20Hales C. Griner R. Hobdy-Henderson K. Dorn M. Hardy D. Kumar R. Navarre J. Chan E. Lapierre L. Goldenring J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39067-39075Google Scholar). Furthermore, Eferin was shown to interact with ADP-ribosylation factors (ARF5 and ARF6) (30Shin O.H. Ross A.H. Mihai I. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36609-36615Google Scholar, 31Shin O.H. Couvillon A.D. Exton J.H. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 10846-10852Google Scholar). Thus, it is tempting to speculate that class II FIPs (Eferin and FIP4) may regulate transport vesicle budding via interactions with ARF GTPases, whereas class I FIPs (Rip11 and FIP2) may be involved in regulating the motility of transport vesicles. The requirement of Rab11/FIP complex formation for the recruitment of additional membrane transport regulators could be the mechanism of imparting spatial and temporal constraints to the trafficking and fusion of transport vesicles/tubules. Interestingly, our CD data suggested that Rab11 binding to Rip11 results in conformational changes in one or both binding partners (Fig. 2, D–G). This could result in exposure of a cryptic binding site that could be used to bind the other membrane traffic regulators, such as molecular motors. In conclusion, FIP proteins may play a role as Rab11 scaffolding proteins, in this way ensuring the targeting of Rab11 to appropriate endocytic compartments. Upon Rab11 binding, Rab11/FIP complexes then may serve as targeting patches for the recruitment of additional cellular factors, such as molecular motors or ARF GTPases. In principle, this mechanism would allow cells to modify and regulate various endocytic membrane transport pathways by changing the expression levels and localization of FIP proteins.

https://openalex.org/W1966677025,"The presence of two protein-tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) domains is a striking feature in most transmembrane receptor PTPs (RPTPs). The generally inactive membrane-distal PTP domains (RPTP-D2s) bind and are proposed to regulate the membrane-proximal PTP domains (RPTP-D1s). We set out to characterize the interactions between RPTP-D1s and RPTP-D2s in vivo by co-immunoprecipitation of hemagglutinin-tagged fusion proteins encoding the transmembrane domain and RPTP-D1 and myc-tagged RPTP-D2. Seven RPTPs from four different subfamilies were used: RPTPα, RPTPε, LAR, RPTPς, RPTPδ, CD45, and RPTPμ. We found that RPTP-D2s bound to RPTPs with different affinities. The presence of intrinsic RPTP-D2 altered the binding specificity toward other RPTP-D2s positively or negatively, depending on the identity of the RPTPs. Furthermore, the C terminus of RPTP-D2s and the “wedge” in RPTP-D1s played a central role in binding specificity. Finally, full-length RPTPα and LAR heterodimerized in an oxidative stress-dependent manner. Like RPTPα-D2, the LAR-D2 conformation was affected by oxidative stress, suggesting a common regulatory mechanism for RPTP complex formation. Taken together, interactions between RPTP-D1s and RPTP-D2s are a common but specific mechanism that is likely to be regulated.

Protein-tyrosine phosphorylation is of major importance for cell migration, proliferation, differentiation, and transformation within higher eukaryotic organisms. A common way to transmit extracellular signals into the cytoplasm is through receptor protein-tyrosine kinase (RPTK) 1The abbreviations used are: (R)PTK, (receptor) protein-tyrosine kinase; (R)PTP, (receptor) protein-tyrosine phosphatase; D1, membrane-proximal PTP domain; D2, membrane-distal PTP domain; HA: hemagglutinin, FRET, fluorescence resonance energy transfer; aa, amino acid(s); PVDF, polyvinylidene difluoride; LAR, leukocyte common antigen related; CFP, cyan fluorescent protein; HARPTPα, hemagglutinin-tagged RPTPα; YFP, yellow fluorescent protein 1The abbreviations used are: (R)PTK, (receptor) protein-tyrosine kinase; (R)PTP, (receptor) protein-tyrosine phosphatase; D1, membrane-proximal PTP domain; D2, membrane-distal PTP domain; HA: hemagglutinin, FRET, fluorescence resonance energy transfer; aa, amino acid(s); PVDF, polyvinylidene difluoride; LAR, leukocyte common antigen related; CFP, cyan fluorescent protein; HARPTPα, hemagglutinin-tagged RPTPα; YFP, yellow fluorescent protein activation that consequently activates cytosolic proteins by protein-tyrosine phosphorylation. Tyrosine phosphorylation levels are negatively regulated by the protein-tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) (1Hunter T. Cell. 1995; 80: 225-236Google Scholar). The family of PTPs is divided into two large groups, the cytosolic PTPs and the transmembrane, receptor-like PTPs (RPTPs) (2Neel B.G. Tonks N.K. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 193-204Google Scholar, 3den Hertog J. Mech. Dev. 1999; 85: 3-14Google Scholar). Most of the RPTPs include two PTP domains, of which the membrane proximal domain (RPTP-D1) contains all or most of the PTP activity. An understanding of the conservation of the membrane distal PTP domain (RPTP-D2) has remained elusive for a long time. Recent reports suggest a regulatory instead of a catalytic function. Indeed, most of the RPTP-D2s are inactive or very weakly active (4Wang Y. Pallen C.J. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3231-3237Google Scholar). However, the structure of these RPTP-D2s is similar to that of RPTP-D1s (5Nam H.J. Poy F. Krueger N.X. Saito H. Frederick C.A. Cell. 1999; 97: 449-457Google Scholar), and mutation of only two residues, which are otherwise highly conserved in active PTPs, restored catalytic activity in several RPTP-D2s (5Nam H.J. Poy F. Krueger N.X. Saito H. Frederick C.A. Cell. 1999; 97: 449-457Google Scholar, 6Lim K.L. Ng C.H. Pallen C.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1434: 275-283Google Scholar, 7Lim K.L. Kolatkar P.R. Ng K.P. Ng C.H. Pallen C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28986-28993Google Scholar, 8Buist A. Zhang Y.L. Keng Y.F. Wu L. Zhang Z.Y. den Hertog J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 914-922Google Scholar), suggesting that there is evolutionary pressure to keep RPTP-D2s inactive (8Buist A. Zhang Y.L. Keng Y.F. Wu L. Zhang Z.Y. den Hertog J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 914-922Google Scholar).Biochemical and structural studies show that RPTP-D2s bind to RPTP-D1s in an intra- and intermolecular fashion. RPTPδ-D2 was found to directly inhibit RPTPς-D1 activity through binding to the juxtamembrane region of RPTPς-D1 (9Wallace M.J. Fladd C. Batt J. Rotin D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2608-2616Google Scholar). In addition, RPTPα binds to various RPTP-D2s, suggesting that cross-talk between RPTPs may be a shared mechanism of regulation (10Blanchetot C. den Hertog J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12446-12452Google Scholar). Inter- and intramolecular interactions between purified CD45-D1 and CD45-D2 suggest they are direct. CD45-D2 binding to CD45-D1 may disrupt CD45-D1/CD45-D1 homodimerization, perhaps leading to the CD45-D1 activation detected (11Felberg J. Johnson P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17839-17845Google Scholar). Recently, the juxtamembrane region of RPTPμ was shown to bind in an intramolecular fashion with both PTP domains of RPTPμ, thus regulating RPTPμ-D1 activity (12Feiken E. van Etten I. Gebbink M.F. Moolenaar W.H. Zondag G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15350-15356Google Scholar, 13Aricescu A.R. Fulga T.A. Cismasiu V. Goody R.S. Szedlacsek S.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 280: 319-327Google Scholar). Finally, the crystal structure of the complete cytoplasmic domain of LAR, containing LAR-D1 and LAR-D2, provided some structural evidence for intramolecular D1/D2 binding (5Nam H.J. Poy F. Krueger N.X. Saito H. Frederick C.A. Cell. 1999; 97: 449-457Google Scholar). LAR-D1 interacts extensively with LAR-D2 through the spacer region. Using intramolecular FRET, the conformation of RPTPα-D2 was found to change from a “closed” to an “open” conformation in an oxidative stress-dependent manner. The change in conformation has functional consequences, because only the open RPTPα-D2 binds intermolecularly with RPTP domains (14Blanchetot C. Tertoolen L.G. den Hertog J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 493-503Google Scholar). However, whether RPTP-D1/RPTP-D2 binding is a general mechanism and, if so, with what specificity, is not known.The function of RPTP-D1/RPTP-D2 binding may be to regulate RPTP-D1 activity, either directly or through regulation of RPTP-D1/RPTP-D1 dimerization. Several reports suggest that RPTP-D1 activity of RPTPα and CD45 is negatively regulated by dimerization (15Bilwes A.M. den Hertog J. Hunter T. Noel J.P. Nature. 1996; 382: 555-559Google Scholar, 16Desai D.M. Sap J. Schlessinger J. Weiss A. Cell. 1993; 73: 541-554Google Scholar, 17Jiang G. den Hertog J. Su J. Noel J. Sap J. Hunter T. Nature. 1999; 401: 606-610Google Scholar, 18Jiang G. den Hertog J. Hunter T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5917-5929Google Scholar, 19Majeti R. Bilwes A.M. Noel J.P. Hunter T. Weiss A. Science. 1998; 279: 88-91Google Scholar). The crystal structure of RPTPα-D1 shows a direct reciprocal interaction of a helix-loop-helix “wedge” structure in the juxtamembrane region with the catalytic site of the opposing monomer (15Bilwes A.M. den Hertog J. Hunter T. Noel J.P. Nature. 1996; 382: 555-559Google Scholar). The juxtamembrane domain of RPTPς and the wedge of RPTPα are involved in binding to RPTP-D2s (9Wallace M.J. Fladd C. Batt J. Rotin D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2608-2616Google Scholar, 10Blanchetot C. den Hertog J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12446-12452Google Scholar). Furthermore, CD45-D1 showed an increase in activity when fused to CD45-D2, presumably due to the increase in monomerization (11Felberg J. Johnson P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17839-17845Google Scholar). The involvement of the wedge in RPTP-D1/RPTP-D2 binding suggested a possible role for RPTP-D2s in the regulation of RPTP-D1/RPTP-D1 dimerization (10Blanchetot C. den Hertog J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12446-12452Google Scholar) or in direct regulation of the catalytic activity (9Wallace M.J. Fladd C. Batt J. Rotin D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2608-2616Google Scholar, 11Felberg J. Johnson P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17839-17845Google Scholar).Like RPTKs, RPTPs may form heterodimers in vivo. Studies on the Erb family of RPTKs showed that heterodimerization induced specific downstream events different than the ones induced by homodimerization (20Alroy I. Yarden Y. FEBS Lett. 1997; 410: 83-86Google Scholar, 21Riese D.J. Stern D.F. Bioessays. 1998; 20: 41-48Google Scholar). To get basic insight into the relationship between RPTPs, we set out to identify binding between various RPTPs, including RPTPα, RPTPε, LAR, RPTPδ, RPTPς, RPTPμ, and CD45, and their RPTP-D2sin vivo. We found that specific RPTP-D1/RPTP-D2 interactions were favored. The presence of intrinsic RPTP-D2 affected the binding specificity. Furthermore, we found that the C-terminal sequence, at least in RPTPδ-D2, and the wedge in RPTPα were critical to direct RPTPδ-D2 binding specificity suggesting multiple sites of interaction. Finally, we also show heterodimerization between full-length RPTPα and LAR in an oxidative stress-dependent manner. Taken together, we show that binding of RPTPs to RPTP-D2s are common but specific and that RPTP-D2s contain all the features necessary to drive the specificity of RPTP dimerization. Furthermore, our results suggest a specific mechanism of cross-talk between RPTPs.DISCUSSIONLike RPTKs, RPTPs may be regulated by dimerization (27Weiss A. Schlessinger J. Cell. 1998; 94: 277-280Google Scholar). Even though multiple regions may be involved in RPTP dimerization, an important component for dimerization is RPTP-D2. RPTPδ-D2 binds to RPTPς-D1 (9Wallace M.J. Fladd C. Batt J. Rotin D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2608-2616Google Scholar), different RPTP-D2s bind to RPTPα (10Blanchetot C. den Hertog J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12446-12452Google Scholar), and CD45-D2 and RPTPμ-D2 bind to their respective RPTP-D1s. Furthermore, the fact, that the so-called wedge structure, which interacts with the catalytic site of RPTP-D1 in the RPTPα dimer (15Bilwes A.M. den Hertog J. Hunter T. Noel J.P. Nature. 1996; 382: 555-559Google Scholar), also binds to RPTP-D2s (9Wallace M.J. Fladd C. Batt J. Rotin D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2608-2616Google Scholar, 10Blanchetot C. den Hertog J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12446-12452Google Scholar), suggests that RPTP-D2s may be involved in the regulation of dimerization (in trans) (10Blanchetot C. den Hertog J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12446-12452Google Scholar). Our results form the basis of a matrix of in vivo binding between RPTPs and RPTP-D2s. Such a matrix shows that all RPTP-D2s tested bound to membrane-localized RPTP-D1s but with different affinities. Apparently, four different patterns exist for RPTP/RPTP-D2 binding (Table I): 1) RPTPε-D2 and RPTPς-D2 always bound relatively well to all RPTP-D1s tested; 2) RPTPδ-D2 bound either strongly (to RPTPα, RPTPε, or LAR-D1D2) or not at all (to the other RPTPs); 3) RPTPα-D2 and RPTPμ-D2 bound with relatively similar but weak affinity to all RPTP-D1s tested; and 4) LAR-D2 and CD45-D2 also have a similar binding pattern and bound weakly to some but not to other RPTPs. Very closely related RPTP-D2s have significantly different binding properties. RPTPε-D2 bound strongly to all RPTP-D1s, whereas RPTPα-D2, the closest homologue of RPTPε-D2, bound with much less affinity. Furthermore, LAR-D2, RPTPς-D2, and RPTPδ-D2 have very different binding affinities, while they all share very high sequence homology. LAR-D2 bound weakly but specifically to RPTPs. RPTPς-D2 bound strongly to all RPTPs tested, whereas RPTPδ-D2 bound strongly to some RPTPs, but not at all to others. Taken together, our results show that RPTP-D2s have all the characteristics for being at the base of the specificity of RPTP dimerization. Furthermore, our results show that accurate predictions of RPTP-D1/RPTP-D2 interactions based on sequence comparison is still not possible, putting emphasis on our experimental approach to unravel RPTP-D1/RPTP-D2 interactions and function.The presence or absence of intrinsic RPTP-D2 affected the binding efficiency between the remaining RPTP-D1 and other RPTP-D2s. For instance, LAR-D1D2 preferentially bound RPTPδ-D2 while LAR-D1 preferentially bound RPTPς-D2 (Fig. 3 B). These results are consistent with the model that intramolecular D1/D2 binding regulates intermolecular D1/D2 interactions. Indeed, it was shown for CD45 and RPTPμ that the juxtamembrane region and the spacer region, when fused to RPTP-D1, alter the binding specificity of D1 toward RPTP-D2 (12Feiken E. van Etten I. Gebbink M.F. Moolenaar W.H. Zondag G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15350-15356Google Scholar,30Hayami-Noumi K. Tsuchiya T. Moriyama Y. Noumi T. FEBS Lett. 2000; 468: 68-72Google Scholar). Furthermore, we previously showed that the spacer region and the C-terminal region of RPTPα-D2 bind intramolecularly and regulate the interaction between RPTPα-D1 and RPTPα-D2 (14Blanchetot C. Tertoolen L.G. den Hertog J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 493-503Google Scholar). Because the binding specificity of RPTP-D1s is different than RPTP-D1D2s, our results suggest that stimuli may induce a reshuffling of RPTP dimers.We have previously shown that the C terminus of RPTPα-D2 was involved in binding to RPTPα (10Blanchetot C. den Hertog J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12446-12452Google Scholar). Using RPTPδ-D2, we further show the importance of the C terminus in RPTP-D2s and of the wedge in RPTP-D1s. Replacement of the C-terminal sequence of RPTPδ-D2 changed the binding specificity and affinity. The corresponding region in LAR forms a helix that is localized at the interface between LAR-D1 and LAR-D2 in the crystal structure (5Nam H.J. Poy F. Krueger N.X. Saito H. Frederick C.A. Cell. 1999; 97: 449-457Google Scholar), providing structural support that this region is somehow involved in intramolecular RPTPD1/RPTPD2 binding. The fact that mutation of this region positively and negatively altered the binding efficiency of different RPTPs may suggest that the C terminus forms (part of) the binding site for RPTP-D1s or plays an indirect role (by regulating RPTP-D2 opening). Other sites are involved in RPTP-D1/RPTP-D2 binding as well, because replacement of the C terminus increased binding in some cases. These results suggest that multiple binding sites between RPTP-D1 and RPTP-D2s exist and may compete and/or cooperate. The juxtamembrane region (Fig. 4 C and Refs. 9Wallace M.J. Fladd C. Batt J. Rotin D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2608-2616Google Scholar and10Blanchetot C. den Hertog J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12446-12452Google Scholar), the C-terminal region (Fig. 4 and Ref. 10Blanchetot C. den Hertog J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12446-12452Google Scholar), and the spacer region (5Nam H.J. Poy F. Krueger N.X. Saito H. Frederick C.A. Cell. 1999; 97: 449-457Google Scholar, 12Feiken E. van Etten I. Gebbink M.F.

Moriyama Y. Noumi T. FEBS Lett. 2000; 468: 68-72Google Scholar) are all involved in RPTP-D1/RPTP-D2 binding. The differences in binding between constructs may be due to differences in binding efficiency to one or more binding sites. A matrix such as the one described here may help to pinpoint specific binding sites or help to define these sites.Homodimerization of RPTPα and CD45 is now well established. However, we found that oxidative stress stimulation was necessary to allow co-immunoprecipitation of full-length RPTPα dimers (14Blanchetot C. Tertoolen L.G. den Hertog J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 493-503Google Scholar). Oxidative stress induced a change in the conformation of RPTPα-D2 that released RPTPα from a closed to an open conformation allowing stabilization of dimers. Here we show that oxidative stress induced formation of heterodimers between full-length RPTPα and LAR as well. Using FRET, we demonstrated that oxidative stress induced a conformational change in LAR-D2 as well, albeit to a lesser extent than in RPTPα-D2. Although this was the first time that full-length RPTP heterodimers were detected, cross-talk between RPTPs has been proposed before. Importantly, several elaborate studies on Drosophila axon pathfinding clearly indicate functional cooperation and competition between RPTPs (28Desai C.J. Krueger N.X. Saito H. Zinn K. Development. 1997; 124: 1941-1952Google Scholar, 29Sun Q. Schindelholz B. Knirr M. Schmid A. Zinn K. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2001; 17: 274-291Google Scholar). Although these studies only show genetic interactions, it is now tempting to speculate that cross-talk betweenDrosophila RPTPs may be mediated by direct, stimulation-dependent heterodimerization.A burning question that remains is: what is the effect of RPTP-D2 on RPTP-D1 activity? RPTPδ-D2 binding inhibits RPTPς-D1 (9Wallace M.J. Fladd C. Batt J. Rotin D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2608-2616Google Scholar), and RPTPμ-D2 binding decreases RPTPμ-D1 catalytic activity (12Feiken E. van Etten I. Gebbink M.F. Moolenaar W.H. Zondag G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15350-15356Google Scholar, 13Aricescu A.R. Fulga T.A. Cismasiu V. Goody R.S. Szedlacsek S.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 280: 319-327Google Scholar). In contrast, the presence of CD45-D2 fused to CD45-D1 led to an increase in total PTP catalytic activity, presumably due to an increase in monomerization (11Felberg J. Johnson P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17839-17845Google Scholar). Furthermore, in vitro no changes in RPTPα-D1 activity were detected after addition of RPTPα-D2 (data not shown). Taken together, these results suggest that the effect of RPTP-D2s on RPTP-D1s may depend on the RPTP, or on the RPTP-D1/RPTP-D2 combination. Indeed, the strength and site(s) of the interaction may be important. Strong binding of RPTP-D2 to the wedge may lead to inactivation of RPTP-D1, whereas weak and dynamic RPTP-D2 binding to the wedge may lead to monomerization and activation of RPTP-D1. For these reasons, all RPTP-D1/RPTP-D2 combinations will need to be studied for changes in activity. However, these activity assays are technically difficult, because the stoichiometry of binding of RPTP-D1 to RPTP-D2 will influence the effect of RPTP-D2 on RPTP-D1 activity in assaysin vitro. A much-preferred configuration would require analysis of dephosphorylation of physiological substrates in living cells, which is not feasible yet for all RPTPs.In conclusion, our results suggest that specific and regulated heterodimerization between RPTPs occurs in vivo. RPTP-D2s have specific affinity for RPTP-D1s and consequently may be at the base of functional and regulatory cross-talk between RPTPs. Protein-tyrosine phosphorylation is of major importance for cell migration, proliferation, differentiation, and transformation within higher eukaryotic organisms. A common way to transmit extracellular signals into the cytoplasm is through receptor protein-tyrosine kinase (RPTK) 1The abbreviations used are: (R)PTK, (receptor) protein-tyrosine kinase; (R)PTP, (receptor) protein-tyrosine phosphatase; D1, membrane-proximal PTP domain; D2, membrane-distal PTP domain; HA: hemagglutinin, FRET, fluorescence resonance energy transfer; aa, amino acid(s); PVDF, polyvinylidene difluoride; LAR, leukocyte common antigen related; CFP, cyan fluorescent protein; HARPTPα, hemagglutinin-tagged RPTPα; YFP, yellow fluorescent protein 1The abbreviations used are: (R)PTK, (receptor) protein-tyrosine kinase; (R)PTP, (receptor) protein-tyrosine phosphatase; D1, membrane-proximal PTP domain; D2, membrane-distal PTP domain; HA: hemagglutinin, FRET, fluorescence resonance energy transfer; aa, amino acid(s); PVDF, polyvinylidene difluoride; LAR, leukocyte common antigen related; CFP, cyan fluorescent protein; HARPTPα, hemagglutinin-tagged RPTPα; YFP, yellow fluorescent protein activation that consequently activates cytosolic proteins by protein-tyrosine phosphorylation. Tyrosine phosphorylation levels are negatively regulated by the protein-tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) (1Hunter T. Cell. 1995; 80: 225-236Google Scholar). The family of PTPs is divided into two large groups, the cytosolic PTPs and the transmembrane, receptor-like PTPs (RPTPs) (2Neel B.G. Tonks N.K. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 193-204Google Scholar, 3den Hertog J. Mech. Dev. 1999; 85: 3-14Google Scholar). Most of the RPTPs include two PTP domains, of which the membrane proximal domain (RPTP-D1) contains all or most of the PTP activity. An understanding of the conservation of the membrane distal PTP domain (RPTP-D2) has remained elusive for a long time. Recent reports suggest a regulatory instead of a catalytic function. Indeed, most of the RPTP-D2s are inactive or very weakly active (4Wang Y. Pallen C.J. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3231-3237Google Scholar). However, the structure of these RPTP-D2s is similar to that of RPTP-D1s (5Nam H.J. Poy F. Krueger N.X. Saito H. Frederick C.A. Cell. 1999; 97: 449-457Google Scholar), and mutation of only two residues, which are otherwise highly conserved in active PTPs, restored catalytic activity in several RPTP-D2s (5Nam H.J. Poy F. Krueger N.X. Saito H. Frederick C.A. Cell. 1999; 97: 449-457Google Scholar, 6Lim K.L. Ng C.H. Pallen C.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1434: 275-283Google Scholar, 7Lim K.L. Kolatkar P.R. Ng K.P. Ng C.H. Pallen C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28986-28993Google Scholar, 8Buist A. Zhang Y.L. Keng Y.F. Wu L. Zhang Z.Y. den Hertog J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 914-922Google Scholar), suggesting that there is evolutionary pressure to keep RPTP-D2s inactive (8Buist A. Zhang Y.L. Keng Y.F. Wu L. Zhang Z.Y. den Hertog J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 914-922Google Scholar). Biochemical and structural studies show that RPTP-D2s bind to RPTP-D1s in an intra- and intermolecular fashion. RPTPδ-D2 was found to directly inhibit RPTPς-D1 activity through binding to the juxtamembrane region of RPTPς-D1 (9Wallace M.J. Fladd C. Batt J. Rotin D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2608-2616Google Scholar). In addition, RPTPα binds to various RPTP-D2s, suggesting that cross-talk between RPTPs may be a shared mechanism of regulation (10Blanchetot C. den Hertog J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12446-12452Google Scholar). Inter- and intramolecular interactions between purified CD45-D1 and CD45-D2 suggest they are direct. CD45-D2 binding to CD45-D1 may disrupt CD45-D1/CD45-D1 homodimerization, perhaps leading to the CD45-D1 activation detected (11Felberg J. Johnson P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17839-17845Google Scholar). Recently, the juxtamembrane region of RPTPμ was shown to bind in an intramolecular fashion with both PTP domains of RPTPμ, thus regulating RPTPμ-D1 activity (12Feiken E. van Etten I. Gebbink M.F. Moolenaar W.H. Zondag G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15350-15356Google Scholar, 13Aricescu A.R. Fulga T.A. Cismasiu V. Goody R.S. Szedlacsek S.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 280: 319-327Google Scholar). Finally, the crystal structure of the complete cytoplasmic domain of LAR, containing LAR-D1 and LAR-D2, provided some structural evidence for intramolecular D1/D2 binding (5Nam H.J. Poy F. Krueger N.X. Saito H. Frederick C.A. Cell. 1999; 97: 449-457Google Scholar). LAR-D1 interacts extensively with LAR-D2 through the spacer region. Using intramolecular FRET, the conformation of RPTPα-D2 was found to change from a “closed” to an “open” conformation in an oxidative stress-dependent manner. The change in conformation has functional consequences, because only the open RPTPα-D2 binds intermolecularly with RPTP domains (14Blanchetot C. Tertoolen L.G. den Hertog J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 493-503Google Scholar). However, whether RPTP-D1/RPTP-D2 binding is a general mechanism and, if so, with what specificity, is not known. The function of RPTP-D1/RPTP-D2 binding may be to regulate RPTP-D1 activity, either directly or through regulation of RPTP-D1/RPTP-D1 dimerization. Several reports suggest that RPTP-D1 activity of RPTPα and CD45 is negatively regulated by dimerization (15Bilwes A.M. den Hertog J. Hunter T. Noel J.P. Nature. 1996; 382: 555-559Google Scholar, 16Desai D.M. Sap J. Schlessinger J. Weiss A. Cell. 1993; 73: 541-554Google Scholar, 17Jiang G. den Hertog J. Su J. Noel J. Sap J. Hunter T. Nature. 1999; 401: 606-610Google Scholar, 18Jiang G. den Hertog J. Hunter T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5917-5929Google Scholar, 19Majeti R. Bilwes A.M. Noel J.P. Hunter T. Weiss A. Science. 1998; 279: 88-91Google Scholar). The crystal structure of RPTPα-D1 shows a direct reciprocal interaction of a helix-loop-helix “wedge” structure in the juxtamembrane region with the catalytic site of the opposing monomer (15Bilwes A.M. den Hertog J. Hunter T. Noel J.P. Nature. 1996; 382: 555-559Google Scholar). The juxtamembrane domain of RPTPς and the wedge of RPTPα are involved in binding to RPTP-D2s (9Wallace M.J. Fladd C. Batt J. Rotin D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2608-2616Google Scholar, 10Blanchetot C. den Hertog J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12446-12452Google Scholar). Furthermore, CD45-D1 showed an increase in activity when fused to CD45-D2, presumably due to the increase in monomerization (11Felberg J. Johnson P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17839-17845Google Scholar). The involvement of the wedge in RPTP-D1/RPTP-D2 binding suggested a possible role for RPTP-D2s in the regulation of RPTP-D1/RPTP-D1 dimerization (10Blanchetot C. den Hertog J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12446-12452Google Scholar) or in direct regulation of the catalytic activity (9Wallace M.J. Fladd C. Batt J. Rotin D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2608-2616Google Scholar, 11Felberg J. Johnson P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17839-17845Google Scholar). Like RPTKs, RPTPs may form heterodimers in vivo. Studies on the Erb family of RPTKs showed that heterodimerization induced specific downstream events different than the ones induced by homodimerization (20Alroy I. Yarden Y. FEBS Lett. 1997; 410: 83-86Google Scholar, 21Riese D.J. Stern D.F. Bioessays. 1998; 20: 41-48Google Scholar). To get basic insight into the relationship between RPTPs, we set out to identify binding between various RPTPs, including RPTPα, RPTPε, LAR, RPTPδ, RPTPς, RPTPμ, and CD45, and their RPTP-D2sin vivo. We found that specific RPTP-D1/RPTP-D2 interactions were favored. The presence of intrinsic RPTP-D2 affected the binding specificity. Furthermore, we found that the C-terminal sequence, at least in RPTPδ-D2, and the wedge in RPTPα were critical to direct RPTPδ-D2 binding specificity suggesting multiple sites of interaction. Finally, we also show heterodimerization between full-length RPTPα and LAR in an oxidative stress-dependent manner. Taken together, we show that binding of RPTPs to RPTP-D2s are common but specific and that RPTP-D2s contain all the features necessary to drive the specificity of RPTP dimerization. Furthermore, our results suggest a specific mechanism of cross-talk between RPTPs. DISCUSSIONLike RPTKs, RPTPs may be regulated by dimerization (27Weiss A. Schlessinger J. Cell. 1998; 94: 277-280Google Scholar). Even though multiple regions may be involved in RPTP dimerization, an important component for dimerization is RPTP-D2. RPTPδ-D2 binds to RPTPς-D1 (9Wallace M.J. Fladd C. Batt J. Rotin D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2608-2616Google Scholar), different RPTP-D2s bind to RPTPα (10Blanchetot C. den Hertog J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12446-12452Google Scholar), and CD45-D2 and RPTPμ-D2 bind to their respective RPTP-D1s. Furthermore, the fact, that the so-called wedge structure, which interacts with the catalytic site of RPTP-D1 in the RPTPα dimer (15Bilwes A.M. den Hertog J. Hunter T. Noel J.P. Nature. 1996; 382: 555-559Google Scholar), also binds to RPTP-D2s (9Wallace M.J. Fladd C. Batt J. Rotin D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2608-2616Google Scholar, 10Blanchetot C. den Hertog J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12446-12452Google Scholar), suggests that RPTP-D2s may be involved in the regulation of dimerization (in trans) (10Blanchetot C. den Hertog J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12446-12452Google Scholar). Our results form the basis of a matrix of in vivo binding between RPTPs and RPTP-D2s. Such a matrix shows that all RPTP-D2s tested bound to membrane-localized RPTP-D1s but with different affinities. Apparently, four different patterns exist for RPTP/RPTP-D2 binding (Table I): 1) RPTPε-D2 and RPTPς-D2 always bound relatively well to all RPTP-D1s tested; 2) RPTPδ-D2 bound either strongly (to RPTPα, RPTPε, or LAR-D1D2) or not at all (to the other RPTPs); 3) RPTPα-D2 and RPTPμ-D2 bound with relatively similar but weak affinity to all RPTP-D1s tested; and 4) LAR-D2 and CD45-D2 also have a similar binding pattern and bound weakly to some but not to other RPTPs. Very closely related RPTP-D2s have significantly different binding properties. RPTPε-D2 bound strongly to all RPTP-D1s, whereas RPTPα-D2, the closest homologue of RPTPε-D2, bound with much less affinity. Furthermore, LAR-D2, RPTPς-D2, and RPTPδ-D2 have very different binding affinities, while they all share very high sequence homology. LAR-D2 bound weakly but specifically to RPTPs. RPTPς-D2 bound strongly to all RPTPs tested, whereas RPTPδ-D2 bound strongly to some RPTPs, but not at all to others. Taken together, our results show that RPTP-D2s have all the characteristics for being at the base of the specificity of RPTP dimerization. Furthermore, our results show that accurate predictions of RPTP-D1/RPTP-D2 interactions based on sequence comparison is still not possible, putting emphasis on our experimental approach to unravel RPTP-D1/RPTP-D2 interactions and function.The presence or absence of intrinsic RPTP-D2 affected the binding efficiency between the remaining RPTP-D1 and other RPTP-D2s. For instance, LAR-D1D2 preferentially bound RPTPδ-D2 while LAR-D1 preferentially bound RPTPς-D2 (Fig. 3 B). These results are consistent with the model that intramolecular D1/D2 binding regulates intermolecular D1/D2 interactions. Indeed, it was shown for CD45 and RPTPμ that the juxtamembrane region and the spacer region, when fused to RPTP-D1, alter the binding specificity of D1 toward RPTP-D2 (12Feiken E. van Etten I. Gebbink M.F. Moolenaar W.H. Zondag G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15350-15356Google Scholar,30Hayami-Noumi K. Tsuchiya T. Moriyama Y. Noumi T. FEBS Lett. 2000; 468: 68-72Google Scholar). Furthermore, we previously showed that the spacer region and the C-terminal region of RPTPα-D2 bind intramolecularly and regulate the interaction between RPTPα-D1 and RPTPα-D2 (14Blanchetot C. Tertoolen L.G. den Hertog J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 493-503Google Scholar). Because the binding specificity of RPTP-D1s is different than RPTP-D1D2s, our results suggest that stimuli may induce a reshuffling of RPTP dimers.We have previously shown that the C terminus of RPTPα-D2 was involved in binding to RPTPα (10Blanchetot C. den Hertog J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12446-12452Google Scholar). Using RPTPδ-D2, we further show the importance of the C terminus in RPTP-D2s and of the wedge in RPTP-D1s. Replacement of the C-terminal sequence of RPTPδ-D2 changed the binding specificity and affinity. The corresponding region in LAR forms a helix that is localized at the interface between LAR-D1 and LAR-D2 in the crystal structure (5Nam H.J. Poy F. Krueger N.X. Saito H. Frederick C.A. Cell. 1999; 97: 449-457Google Scholar), providing structural support that this region is somehow involved in intramolecular RPTPD1/RPTPD2 binding. The fact that mutation of this region positively and negatively altered the binding efficiency of different RPTPs may suggest that the C terminus forms (part of) the binding site for RPTP-D1s or plays an indirect role (by regulating RPTP-D2 opening). Other sites are involved in RPTP-D1/RPTP-D2 binding as well, because replacement of the C terminus increased binding in some cases. These results suggest that multiple binding sites between RPTP-D1 and RPTP-D2s exist and may compete and/or cooperate. The juxtamembrane region (Fig. 4 C and Refs. 9Wallace M.J. Fladd C. Batt J. Rotin D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2608-2616Google Scholar and10Blanchetot C. den Hertog J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12446-12452Google Scholar), the C-terminal region (Fig. 4 and Ref. 10Blanchetot C. den Hertog J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12446-12452Google Scholar), and the spacer region (5Nam H.J. Poy F. Krueger N.X. Saito H. Frederick C.A. Cell. 1999; 97: 449-457Google Scholar, 12Feiken E. van Etten I. Gebbink M.F. Moolenaar W.H. Zondag G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15350-15356Google Scholar, 14Blanchetot C. Tertoolen L.G. den Hertog J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 493-503Google Scholar, 30Hayami-Noumi K. Tsuchiya T. Moriyama Y. Noumi T. FEBS Lett. 2000; 468: 68-72Google Scholar) are all involved in RPTP-D1/RPTP-D2 binding. The differences in binding between constructs may be due to differences in binding efficiency to one or more binding sites. A matrix such as the one described here may help to pinpoint specific binding sites or help to define these sites.Homodimerization of RPTPα and CD45 is now well established. However, we found that oxidative stress stimulation was necessary to allow co-immunoprecipitation of full-length RPTPα dimers (14Blanchetot C. Tertoolen L.G. den Hertog J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 493-503Google Scholar). Oxidative stress induced a change in the conformation of RPTPα-D2 that released RPTPα from a closed to an open conformation allowing stabilization of dimers. Here we show that oxidative stress induced formation of heterodimers between full-length RPTPα and LAR as well. Using FRET, we demonstrated that oxidative stress induced a conformational change in LAR-D2 as well, albeit to a lesser extent than in RPTPα-D2. Although this was the first time that full-length RPTP heterodimers were detected, cross-talk between RPTPs has been proposed before. Importantly, several elaborate studies on Drosophila axon pathfinding clearly indicate functional cooperation and competition between RPTPs (28Desai C.J. Krueger N.X. Saito H. Zinn K.

RPTPδ-D2 binding inhibits RPTPς-D1 (9Wallace M.J. Fladd C. Batt J. Rotin D. Mol. Cell.

In contrast, the presence of CD45-D2 fused to CD45-D1 led to an increase in total PTP catalytic activity, presumably due to an increase in monomerization (11Felberg J. Johnson P. J. Biol.

Strong binding of RPTP-D2 to the wedge may lead to inactivation of RPTP-D1, whereas weak and dynamic RPTP-D2 binding to the wedge may lead to monomerization and activation of RPTP-D1. For these reasons, all RPTP-D1/RPTP-D2 combinations will need to be studied for changes in activity.

RPTPδ-D2 binds to RPTPς-D1 (9Wallace M.J. Fladd C. Batt J. Rotin D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2608-2616Google Scholar), different RPTP-D2s bind to RPTPα (10Blanchetot C. den Hertog J. J. Biol.

Furthermore, the fact, that the so-called wedge structure, which interacts with the catalytic site of RPTP-D1 in the RPTPα dimer (15Bilwes A.M. den Hertog J. Hunter T. Noel J.P. Nature. 1996; 382: 555-559Google Scholar), also binds to RPTP-D2s (9Wallace M.J. Fladd C. Batt J. Rotin D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2608-2616Google Scholar, 10Blanchetot C. den Hertog J. J. Biol.

RPTPς-D2 bound strongly to all RPTPs tested, whereas RPTPδ-D2 bound strongly to some RPTPs, but not at all to others.

For instance, LAR-D1D2 preferentially bound RPTPδ-D2 while LAR-D1 preferentially bound RPTPς-D2 (Fig. 3 B). These results are consistent with the model that intramolecular D1/D2 binding regulates intermolecular D1/D2 interactions. Indeed, it was shown for CD45 and RPTPμ that the juxtamembrane region and the spacer region, when fused to RPTP-D1, alter the binding specificity of D1 toward RPTP-D2 (12Feiken E. van Etten I. Gebbink M.F. Moolenaar W.H. Zondag G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15350-15356Google Scholar,30Hayami-Noumi K. Tsuchiya T. Moriyama Y. Noumi T. FEBS Lett. 2000; 468: 68-72Google Scholar). Furthermore, we previously showed that the spacer region and the C-terminal region of RPTPα-D2 bind intramolecularly and regulate the interaction between RPTPα-D1 and RPTPα-D2 (14Blanchetot C. Tertoolen L.G. den Hertog J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 493-503Google Scholar). Because the binding specificity of RPTP-D1s is different than RPTP-D1D2s, our results suggest that stimuli may induce a reshuffling of RPTP dimers. We have previously shown that the C terminus of RPTPα-D2 was involved in binding to RPTPα (10Blanchetot C. den Hertog J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12446-12452Google Scholar). Using RPTPδ-D2, we further show the importance of the C terminus in RPTP-D2s and of the wedge in RPTP-D1s. Replacement of the C-terminal sequence of RPTPδ-D2 changed the binding specificity and affinity. The corresponding region in LAR forms a helix that is localized at the interface between LAR-D1 and LAR-D2 in the crystal structure (5Nam H.J. Poy F. Krueger N.X. Saito H. Frederick C.A. Cell. 1999; 97: 449-457Google Scholar), providing structural support that this region is somehow involved in intramolecular RPTPD1/RPTPD2 binding. The fact that mutation of this region positively and negatively altered the binding efficiency of different RPTPs may suggest that the C terminus forms (part of) the binding site for RPTP-D1s or plays an indirect role (by regulating RPTP-D2 opening). Other sites are involved in RPTP-D1/RPTP-D2 binding as well, because replacement of the C terminus increased binding in some cases. These results suggest that multiple binding sites between RPTP-D1 and RPTP-D2s exist and may compete and/or cooperate. The juxtamembrane region (Fig. 4 C and Refs. 9Wallace M.J. Fladd C. Batt J.

Moriyama Y. Noumi T. FEBS Lett. 2000; 468: 68-72Google Scholar) are all involved in RPTP-D1/RPTP-D2 binding. The differences in binding between constructs may be due to differences in binding efficiency to one or more binding sites. A matrix such as the one described here may help to pinpoint specific binding sites or help to define these sites. Homodimerization of RPTPα and CD45 is now well established. However, we found that oxidative stress stimulation was necessary to allow co-immunoprecipitation of full-length RPTPα dimers (14Blanchetot C. Tertoolen L.G. den Hertog J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 493-503Google Scholar). Oxidative stress induced a change in the conformation of RPTPα-D2 that released RPTPα from a closed to an open conformation allowing stabilization of dimers. Here we show that oxidative stress induced formation of heterodimers between full-length RPTPα and LAR as well. Using FRET, we demonstrated that oxidative stress induced a conformational change in LAR-D2 as well, albeit to a lesser extent than in RPTPα-D2. Although this was the first time that full-length RPTP heterodimers were detected, cross-talk between RPTPs has been proposed before. Importantly, several elaborate studies on Drosophila axon pathfinding clearly indicate functional cooperation and competition between RPTPs (28Desai C.J. Krueger N.X. Saito H. Zinn K. Development. 1997; 124: 1941-1952Google Scholar, 29Sun Q. Schindelholz B. Knirr M. Schmid A. Zinn K. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2001; 17: 274-291Google Scholar). Although these studies only show genetic interactions, it is now tempting to speculate that cross-talk betweenDrosophila RPTPs may be mediated by direct, stimulation-dependent heterodimerization. A burning question that remains is: what is the effect of RPTP-D2 on RPTP-D1 activity? RPTPδ-D2 binding inhibits RPTPς-D1 (9Wallace M.J. Fladd C. Batt J. Rotin D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2608-2616Google Scholar), and RPTPμ-D2 binding decreases RPTPμ-D1 catalytic activity (12Feiken E. van Etten I. Gebbink M.F. Moolenaar W.H. Zondag G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15350-15356Google Scholar, 13Aricescu A.R. Fulga T.A. Cismasiu V. Goody R.S. Szedlacsek S.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 280: 319-327Google Scholar). In contrast, the presence of CD45-D2 fused to CD45-D1 led to an increase in total PTP catalytic activity, presumably due to an increase in monomerization (11Felberg J. Johnson P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17839-17845Google Scholar). Furthermore, in vitro no changes in RPTPα-D1 activity were detected after addition of RPTPα-D2 (data not shown). Taken together, these results suggest that the effect of RPTP-D2s on RPTP-D1s may depend on the RPTP, or on the RPTP-D1/RPTP-D2 combination. Indeed, the strength and site(s) of the interaction may be important. Strong binding of RPTP-D2 to the wedge may lead to inactivation of RPTP-D1, whereas weak and dynamic RPTP-D2 binding to the wedge may lead to monomerization and activation of RPTP-D1. For these reasons, all RPTP-D1/RPTP-D2 combinations will need to be studied for changes in activity. However, these activity assays are technically difficult, because the stoichiometry of binding of RPTP-D1 to RPTP-D2 will influence the effect of RPTP-D2 on RPTP-D1 activity in assaysin vitro. A much-preferred configuration would require analysis of dephosphorylation of physiological substrates in living cells, which is not feasible yet for all RPTPs. In conclusion, our results suggest that specific and regulated heterodimerization between RPTPs occurs in vivo. RPTP-D2s have specific affinity for RPTP-D1s and consequently may be at the base of functional and regulatory cross-talk between RPTPs.

(1999) J. Biol. Chem. 274, 13462–13469), and arrestin 3 (Wu, G., Krupnick, J. G., Benovic, J. L., and Lanier, S. M. (1997) J. Biol. Chem. 272, 17836–17842), suggesting that a three-dimensional surface, rather than a linear sequence, provides the basis for these interactions as proposed for 3i loop tethering of the α2A-AR to the basolateral surface of Madin-Darby canine kidney cells (Edwards, S. W., and Limbird, L. E. (1999) J. Biol. Chem. 274, 16331–16336). Sequences at the extreme N-terminal and C-terminal ends of the 3i loop are critical for interaction with spinophilin but not for interaction with 14-3-3ζ or arrestin 3, for which the C-terminal half of the loop is more important. Competition binding for35S-labeled α2A-AR 3i loop binding to glutathione S-transferase (GST)-spinophilin amino acids 151–444 revealed a relative affinity of spinophilin ≅ arrestin > 14-3-3ζ for the unphosphorylated α2A-AR 3i loop. Agonist occupancy of the α2A-AR increases receptor association with spinophilin, and arrestin 3 appears to compete for this enrichment. However, when the G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 substrate sequence was deleted from the 3i loop, arrestin 3 could not compete for the agonist-enriched binding of spinophilin to the mutant α2A-AR. These data are consistent with a model where sequential or competitive interactions among spinophilin, arrestin, and/or 14-3-3ζ play a role in α2A-AR functions.

In native cells, these receptors mediate inhibition of adenylyl cyclase, activation of receptor-operated K+ currents, suppression of voltage-gated Ca2+ currents, and activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase activity (1Richman J.G.

The α2-ARs often mediate their responses in highly polarized cells, such as epithelial cells from the kidney and intestine or neurons of the peripheral and central nervous system (9Ruffolo R.R. Hieble J.P. Pharmacol. Ther. 1994; 61: 1-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). We have studied the polarization of the α2-AR subtypes extensively in Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCKII) cells as a model system. In these studies, we demonstrated that basolateral targeting of the α2A-AR required sequences embedded in or near the bilayer, whereas retention on that surface involved the third intracellular (3i) loop (10Keefer J.R. Kennedy M.E. Limbird L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16425-16432Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These findings suggested the possibility that the 3i loop may interact with proteins underlying the basolateral surface to extend its half-life there. In studies intended to identify 3i loop-interacting proteins, we demonstrated that the 3i loop interacts with 14-3-3ζ (11Prezeau L. Richman J.G. Edwards S.W. Limbird L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13462-13469Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) as well as with spinophilin (12Richman J.G. Brady A.E. Wang Q. Hensel J.L. Colbran R.J. Limbird L.E. J.

To further understand the role of receptor interactions with spinophilin and/or 14-3-3ζ proteins, we sought to identify the particular regions of the α2A-AR 3i loop sequence involved in the protein-protein contacts. The present studies examine the basis for α2A-AR 3i loop interactions with spinophilin, 14-3-3ζ proteins, and arrestin 3 (also known as β-arrestin 2), another molecule known to interact with the α2A-AR 3i loop (15DeGraff J.L.

We also explored the functional relevance of these interactions by assessing the ability of spinophilin or arrestin to compete for receptor interactions upon agonist occupancy. The data obtained are consistent with a regulatory cycle where agonist-regulated interactions of these proteins occur, perhaps relevant for α2A-AR-mediated functions and/or localization. The pGEMEX-2 vector and TNT in vitrotranslation kit were from Promega (Madison, WI). [35S]Methionine (1000 Ci/mmol) was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences.

Anti-HA rat monoclonal antibody was from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Anti-HA mouse monoclonal antibody (HA.11) was from CRP (BabCO, Denver, PA). Immobilized protein G-agarose was from Pierce. All other chemicals were reagent-grade from Fisher Chemicals (Pittsburgh, PA). Four methionines were inserted via PCR into the N terminus of the porcine α2A-AR 3i loop (amino acids 218–377 (12Richman J.G. Brady A.E. Wang Q. Hensel J.L. Colbran R.J. Limbird L.E. J. Biol.

The resulting construct, referred to as (Met)4-α2A3i (structure WT in Fig. 3), was verified by DNA sequencing. Deletions and truncations were introduced into (Met)4-α2A3i through PCR and/or restriction enzyme digestion and religation of corresponding fragments; all constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. The resulting 3i loop structures (designated 1–8) each carry a deletion as follows: 1, Δaa 252–267; 2, Δaa 268–285; 3, Δaa 286–303; 4, Δaa 304–314; 5, Δaa 315–326; 6, Δaa 327–340; 7, Δaa 301–343; 8, Δaa 351–377. Structures 9 and 10 represent the N- (aa 218–294) and C- (aa 294–377) terminal half of the loop, respectively. Structures 11–13 each carry a deletion at the origin of the N-terminal half of the loop: 11, Δaa 218–231; 12, Δaa 241–251; 13, Δaa 252–267. Structures 14 and 16 contain aa 294–350 and aa 232–359, respectively. Structure 15 contains aa 218–350 with a deletion of aa 252–267. Wild type and mutant 3i loops were transcribed, translated, and35S-labeled using the Promega transcription and translation-coupled (TNT) rabbit reticulocyte lysate kit as described previously (11Prezeau L. Richman J.G. Edwards S.W. Limbird L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13462-13469Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Following each synthesis, products were analyzed and quantitated by 12% SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. The band representing each probe was cut out of the dried gel and counted in scintillation mixture to determine cpm/aliquot of product attributable to35S-labeled 3i loops. GST pull-down assays were performed such that each incubation contained an equivalent amount of35S-labeled wild type or mutant 3i loops. A DNA fragment encoding the α2A-AR 3i loop amino acids 239–370, representing the NotI/Eco47III fragment from the cDNA encoding the porcine α2A-AR, was blunted and then subcloned into the pGEX2T SmaI site in frame with the DNA encoding GST; the resulting construct is referred to as GST-α2A3i short (GST-α2A3is, structure WTS in Fig. 4). Deletions and truncations were introduced into GST-α2A3is through PCR and/or restriction enzyme digestion and religation of corresponding fragments. Resulting structures of the GST-3i loop, numbered 17–25, each carry a deletion as follows: 17, Δaa 252–267; 18, Δaa 268–285; 19, Δaa 286–303; 20, Δaa 304–314; 21, Δaa 315–326; 22, Δaa 327–340; 23, Δaa 301–343; 24, Δaa 344–359; 25, Δaa 360–370. Structures 26 and 27 contain aa 239–294 and aa 294–370 of the 3i loop fused with GST, respectively. The full-length α2A-AR 3i loop (aa 218–377) was fused with GST by subcloning theEcoRI/HindIII (blunt) fragment from (Met)4-α2A3i into pGEX2T/EcoRI (blunt) vector; the resulting construct is referred to as GST-α2A3i long (GST-α2A3iL, structure WTL in Fig. 4). The N-terminal half of the 3i loop (aa 218–294) was fused with GST by subcloning theEcoRI/HindIII (blunt) fragment from structure 9 into pGEX2T/EcoRI (blunt) vector; the resulting structure is referred to as structure 28. In all studies where GST fusion proteins were employed, we stained the same SDS-PAGE gel as evaluated with autoradiography with Coomassie Blue to confirm that equivalent amounts were present in all incubations. GST-spinophilin fusion protein was generated with spinophilin amino acid regions 151–444 (referred to as GST-Sp151–444) and expressed in DH5α or BL21 cells as described previously (12Richman J.G.

Briefly, bacteria were grown at 37 °C to anA 600 = 0.6. GST or GST fusion protein expression was initiated with the addition of 1 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside and allowed to proceed for 2–6 h at 37 °C. Bacteria were collected and lysed by probe sonication for three 30-s bursts on ice in TT+ buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.5% Triton X-100, 1 mg/ml lysozyme, 200 mm NaCl, 100 μm PMSF, 1 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 units/ml aprotinin). The lysate was centrifuged for 10 min at 13,000 × g at 4 °C. The supernatant (15 ml) of this centrifugation was incubated with GSH-agarose (1 ml of a 1:1 slurry equilibrated in TT+buffer) for 1 h at 4 °C via inversion. This solution was transferred to a 0.8 × 4-cm Poly-Prep column (Bio-Rad) and washed sequentially with 12 ml of TT+ buffer, 3 ml of 333 mm NaCl in TT+ buffer, and then with 6 ml of TT+ buffer. GST or GST fusion protein was eluted from the GSH-agarose by adding 3 ml of 10 mm GSH (free acid) in TT+ buffer, pH 7.5. Eluted protein was concentrated and exchanged into PBS buffer using an Amicon stirred cell. Four methionines were inserted via PCR into the N terminus of a spinophilin fragment, spinophilin amino acids 151–444, and the resulting product was subcloned into the modified pGEMEX2 vector in which the sequence-encoding viral coat protein Gene 10 was deleted. The resulting construct pGEMEX2-(Met)4-Sp151–444 was verified by DNA sequencing. pCDNA3-HA14-3-3ζ was a generous gift from Dr. Haian Fu (Emory University). Arrestin 3 cDNA, graciously provided by Dr. Jeffery Benovic (Thomas Jefferson University), was PCR-amplified and subcloned into the pCDNA3-HA vector. Resulting pCDNA3-HA-arrestin 3 was verified by DNA sequencing. Sp151–444, HA-14-3-3ζ, and HA-arrestin 3 were transcribed and translated with or without [35S]Met using TNT rabbit reticulocyte lysate kit as described previously (12Richman J.G. Brady A.E. Wang Q. Hensel J.L. Colbran R.J. Limbird L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15003-15008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Following each synthesis, radiolabeled products were analyzed by 10% SDS-PAGE and autoradiography and quantitated by counting the representative band on dried gel in scintillation mixture. The concentrations of unlabeled proteins synthesized in parallel were estimated accordingly, assuming that in vitro transcription/translation from the same template with or without [35S]Met would proceed at comparable efficiency. Increasing amounts of GST or GST-Sp151–444 fusion protein (0.00034–34 μg, representing an estimated 2.34 × 10−11m to 1.77 × 10−6m of the fusion protein in the incubation) were incubated with 50 μl of GSH-agarose (1:1 slurry equilibrated with TTB buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.05% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 0.01% bovine serum albumin, 100 μm PMSF) in a total reaction volume at 235 μl for the first 5 points (0.00034–3.4 μg) and 315 μl for the last point (34 μg) for 2 h at 4 °C. Then 15 μl of 35S-labeled 3i loop (31,000 cpm, estimated as 2.3 × 10−11m) was added to each incubation and rotated for another 2 h at 4 °C via inversion. After collection by centrifugation, the resin was washed three times with 1 ml of TTB. Interaction with GST-Sp151–444 versus GST (control) was determined by elution of the 3i loop into 1× Laemmli buffer (400 mmTris, pH 6.8, 700 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1% SDS, 10% glycerol) and separation of the eluates by 12% SDS-PAGE. The degree of interaction was quantitated by cutting and counting the bands from the dried gel corresponding to the 3i loop (determined via autoradiography) in scintillation mixture. To assess the relative affinity of the 3i loop for spinophilin, arrestin 3, or 14-3-3ζ, 5 μg of GST or GST-Sp151–444 was incubated with 20 μl of GSH-agarose slurry for 2 h at 4 °C. Increasing amounts (0–16 μl) of in vitro translated Sp151–444, 14-3-3ζ, or arrestin 3 were mixed with rabbit reticulocyte lysate to reach a total volume of 16 μl and then added to each incubation together with 6000 cpm (estimated as 9.2 × 10−12m) 35S-labeled 3i loop with a total reaction volume at 120 μl. After 2 h of incubation at 4 °C, resins were washed and eluted. 35S-labeled 3i loop in the eluate was separated and quantitated as described above. Interactions of mutant 35S-labeled 3i loops with GST-Sp151–444 were assessed as follows: in each 250-μl reaction, 25 μg of GST or GST-Sp151–444 fusion protein was incubated with 50 μl of GSH-agarose (1:1 slurry equilibrated with TTB) for 2 h at 4 °C. Equal amounts of 35S-labeled wild type or mutant 3i loops were added to each incubation and rotated for another 2 h at 4 °C. After collection by centrifugation, the resin was washed three times with 1 ml of TTB. Bound wild type or mutant 3i loops were eluted, resolved, and quantitated as above. GST or GST fusion proteins expressed from a 25-ml culture of DH5α bacteria transformed with wild type or mutant GST-3i loop constructs (estimated as 25 μg per culture) were incubated with 100 μl of GSH agarose (1:1 slurry equilibrated with TTB buffer) for 2 h at 4 °C (as described above). After three washes with TTB (333 mm NaCl was included in the second wash), either 120,000 cpm of35S-labeled 14-3-3ζ or Sp151–444 or 11,000 cpm of35S-labeled arrestin 3 was added to each incubation with a reaction volume of 200 μl in TTB and rotated for another 2 h at 4 °C. The resin was then collected and washed three times with 1 ml of TTB. Interactions of wild type or mutant GST-3i loops with Sp151–444, 14-3-3ζ, and arrestin 3 were determined by elution of the Sp151–444, 14-3-3ζ, or arrestin 3 in 1× Laemmli buffer and separation of the eluates by 12% (for 14-3-3ζ) or 10% (for Sp151–444 and arrestin 3) SDS-PAGE, respectively. To quantitate the degree of interaction, the bands corresponding to Sp151–444, 14-3-3ζ, or arrestin 3 were cut from the dried gel (determined via autoradiography) and counted in a scintillation mixture. COS-M6 cells were plated at 2 × 106 on 10-cm plates or 3.5 × 105 on 12.5-cm2 flasks in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum and 100 unit/ml penicillin and 10 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C/5% CO2. The next day, cells were transfected using FuGENE 6 reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacture's manual. The ability of agonist occupancy of the α2A-AR to increase association of a particular protein with the α2A-AR or an α2A-AR-enriched complex was assessed using co-immunoisolation strategies. COS-M6 cells transiently transfected with cDNA encoding HA-α2A-AR (17Keefer J.R. Limbird L.E. J. Biol.

The incubation was terminated by placing the culture dishes on ice, aspirating the incubation medium, and washing it once with ice-cold PBS containing 1 mmMgCl2 and 0.5 mm CaCl2. Cells were then scraped into ice-cold lysis buffer containing 15 mmHepes, pH 7.6, 5 mm EGTA, and 5 mm EDTA with 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate freshly added and passaged through a 19-gauge needle five times up/down followed by 15 min of centrifugation at 18,000 × g at 4 °C. Pellets were solubilized in 4 mg/ml DβM, 0.8 mg/ml CHS lysis buffer containing 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 25 mm glycylglycine, and 5 mm EGTA with the following protease inhibitors: 100 μm PMSF, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, by 10 passage through a 25-gauge needle on a 1-ml syringe. The extract was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was defined as the solubilized membrane preparation. Typically, 0.4 ml of detergent extract was precleared with 25 μl of a 1:1 protein G-agarose/DβM/CHS lysis buffer slurry and incubated with a 1:50 dilution of rat anti-HA antibody overnight at 4 °C before addition of 25 μl of a 1:1 slurry of protein G-agarose for 2 h. The protein G-agarose was pre-equilibrated in DβM/CHS lysis buffer (see above) also containing 0.25% bovine serum albumin to block nonspecific binding of protein. The protein G-agarose-rat anti-HA-α2A-AR complex was then washed three times with 1 ml of DβM/CHS wash buffer (0.5 mg/ml DβM, 0.1 mg/ml CHS, 20 mm Hepes, 25 mm glycylglycine, 5 mmEDTA). Bound protein was eluted in 1× Laemmli buffer by a 15-s water bath sonication and 5 min of incubation at 70 °C and separated on 10% SDS-PAGE. Western blot analyses were performed following ECL Western blotting protocols (Amersham Biosciences). COS-M6 cells grown in 12.5-cm2 flasks were transiently transfected with cDNA encoding wild type HA-α2A-AR or a mutant HA-α2A-AR ΔLEESSSS (10Keefer J.R. Kennedy M.E. Limbird L.E. J. Biol.

Cells were labeled with 0.1 mCi/ml [32P]orthophosphate for 1 h following incubation in phosphate-free, serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 2 h at 37 °C. Cells were then treated with 100 μm epinephrine (agonist-treated) or 1 μmyohimbine (antagonist-treated) for 5 min at 37 °C in the presence of 1 μm propranolol to block epinephrine effects on trace endogenous β-adrenergic receptors. The incubation was terminated by placing the culture dishes on ice, aspirating the incubation medium, and washing the dishes twice with ice-cold PBS containing 2 mm Na3VO4. Cells were then scraped into 400 μl of PBS lysis buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, 0.05% SDS, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 10 mmNaF, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, and protease inhibitors, passaged ten times through a 20-gauge needle on a 1-ml syringe, and rotated end over end for 30 min at 4 °C. The lysate was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C; the resulting supernatant was subjected to immunoprecipitation with rat anti-HA antibody and 15 μl of a 1:1 slurry of protein G-agarose/PBS lysis buffer. Immunoisolates were washed three times with 1 ml of PBS lysis buffer, eluted in 1× Laemmli buffer by a 15-s water bath sonication and 5 min of incubation at 70 °C, separated on 10% SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by autoradiography.

The interaction of the α2A-AR with spinophilin has been demonstrated to occur under a number of experimental conditions, including agonist-regulated immunoisolation from intact cells, interaction of the35S-labeled α2A-AR 3i loop with GST-spinophilin, and binding of 35S-labeled spinophilin to affinity-absorbed intact α2A-AR (12Richman J.G.

In this study, we focused on characterizing interaction of the α2A-AR 3i loop with spinophilin-(151–444), the receptor-interaction domain (12Richman J.G. Brady A.E. Wang Q. Hensel J.L. Colbran R.J.

As shown in Fig. 1 B, the interaction of spinophilin-(151–444) with the 35S-labeled 3i loop is a concentration-dependent and apparently saturable phenomenon, i.e. the binding of spinophilin-(151–444) to the 3i loop is dependent upon increasing concentrations of GST-Sp151–444, whereas similar incremental additions of GST alone do not lead to detectable binding of the 35S-labeled 3i loop. This finding demonstrates that the interactions are highly specific in nature and require spinophilin-(151–444) for their detection. We have shown previously that not only spinophilin (12Richman J.G.

Others have demonstrated the interaction of arrestin 3 (also known as β-arrestin 2) with the 3i loop of the α2A-AR (15DeGraff J.L. Gagnon A.W. Benovic J.L. Orsini M.J. J. Biol.

To evaluate the relative affinity of the 3i loop for spinophilinversus 14-3-3ζ or arrestin 3, we examined the ability ofin vitro translated but unlabeled 14-3-3ζ, spinophilin, or arrestin 3 to “usurp” the 35S-labeled 3i loop ligand available for binding to GST-Sp151–444 (Fig. 2 A). We utilized this approach because, unlike for GST-Sp151–444, we were unable to synthesize large quantities of either GST-14-3-3ζ or GST-arrestin 3, and thus could not perform competition binding experiments in the traditional fashion. As shown in Fig. 2 B, the presence of in vitrotranslated, unlabeled (Met)4-spinophilin-(151–444), 14-3-3ζ, and arrestin 3 decreases availability of the35S-labeld 3i loop for GST-Sp151–444 binding. Spinophilin-(151–444) and arrestin 3 have a relatively equal affinity in doing so, which is 10-fold more sensitive than inhibition of35S-labeled 3i loop binding by 14-3-3ζ (Fig. 2 C). Under the conditions of this experiment, the 3i loop is not phosphorylated, which has implications for the interpretations of findings to be discussed in Fig. 6, A and C. It is also interesting to note that spinophilin competes for 80% of35S-labeled α2A-AR 3i loop binding, whereas arrestin 3 and 14-3-3ζ compete for only ∼50% of binding. The possible significance of this finding is addressed later.Figure 6Competition of arrestin 3 for the α2A-AR-spinophilin interaction in intact cells.

Observations of the recent nova V2487 Oph 1998 by the X-ray Multi-Mirror satellite (XMM-Newton) provide evidence that accretion (probably on a magnetic white dwarf) was reestablished as early as 2.7 years after the explosion. In addition, positional correlation with a source previously discovered by the Röntgen Satellite (ROSAT) in 1990 suggests that the site of a nova explosion had been seen in x-rays before the outburst."

Plasma fibronectin consists of two similar subunits of molecular mass 200–250 kDa, held together near the C terminus by two disulfide bonds. Each subunit is composed of homologous repeating structural modules (type I, II, and III, referred to here as F1, F2, and F3) (3Ruoslahti E. Annu. Rev.

Fibronectin F3 modules are known to be involved in several interactions including heparin binding and cell binding via integrins.Heparin and heparan sulfate glycosaminoglycans are acidic complex polysaccharides found outside cells (9Sasisekharan R.

The most common repeat structure unit is the trisulfated disaccharide, IdoUA2S-GlcNS6S,1 but a number of structural variations of this disaccharide exist, leading to microheterogeneity. Heparin-binding proteins play important roles in various biological processes; it is therefore important to understand the molecular basis of heparin-protein interactions (11Mulloy B. Linhardt R.J.

Physically and structurally distinct heparin-binding sites have been identified on fibronectin. One of these, called Hep-1, is in the N-terminal region, and a recent study identified a novel heparin-binding site in the alternatively spliced IIICS region (14Mostafavi-Pour Z. Askari J.A. Whittard J.D. Humphries M.J. Matrix Biol. 2001; 20: 63-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The major site, however, lies at the C terminus and is designated as Hep-2. Both Hep-1 and Hep-2 promote cell adhesion and attachment, which are independent of integrin receptors (15McCarthy J.B. Hagen S.T. Furcht L.T. J.

From various studies it has been established that the heparin binding activity of the Hep-2 region is 10–25-fold stronger than Hep-1 (24Benecky M.J. Kolvenbach C.G. Amrani D.L. Mosesson M.W.

EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1468-1479Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) of the Hep-2 region (12–14F3) confirmed the existence of this positively charged cluster; the six basic residues of 13F3 were found to project into the solvent from the ABE face of a β-sheet. The crystal structure also suggested a possible heparin-binding site on 14F3 (35Sharma A. Askari J.A. Humphries M.J. Jones E.Y. Stuart D.I. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1468-1479Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Studies have been carried out with peptides to explore heparin binding activity on14F3 but have not been tested in the context of the folded domain (28Ingham K.C. Brew S.A. Migliorini M.M. Busby T.F. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 12548-12553Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar).The work in this paper describes the mapping of the Hep-2 domain on fibronectin. There are relatively few x-ray structures of heparin-protein complexes available because heterogeneity and polydispersity of the heparin can cause problems in crystallization. Here NMR methods in conjunction with isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) and molecular modeling have been used for mapping the heparin-binding site.RESULTSThe structure of the 13F3, 14F3, and13–14F3 Constructs in SolutionAlthough the structure of 12–14F3 has already been determined by crystallography, it has not so far been possible to produce co-crystals of heparin and 12–14F3. Our primary goal here is to define the site of heparin binding rather than re-determine the structure in solution.Recombinant proteins were prepared corresponding to individual13F3 and 14F3 modules as well as the13–14F3 module pair. The 15N and1H NMR resonances of backbone amide protons of13F3, 14F3, and 13–14F3 were assigned using three-dimensional 15N-edited NOESY and TOCSY experiments. The observed pattern of nuclear Overhauser effects involving amide protons in the individual modules13F3 and 14F3 (data not shown) indicated that all these proteins are folded, with a predominantly β-sheet structure, typical of a fibronectin type-III module (35Sharma A. Askari J.A. Humphries M.J. Jones E.Y. Stuart D.I. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1468-1479Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 55Spitzfaden C. Grant R.P. Mardon H.J. Campbell I.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 265: 565-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Information about the module interface can be obtained by comparing chemical shifts of individual modules with chemical shifts in the module pair. Only residues at the module interface exhibit chemical shift differences between the single modules and the module pair. There is also a striking correlation between residues that experience shifts and residues that have a different calculated solvent exposure between individual modules and the module pair. These data encourage the assumption that the solution structures of 13F3,14F3, and 13–14F3 are very similar to their structure in the crystallized 12–14F3 fragment.Sedimentation Equilibrium ExperimentsThe apparent molecular masses of 9933 ± 390 and 18658 ± 349 Da for 13F3 and 13–14F3 at pH 4.5 agree well with the calculated molecular masses of 10224.4 and 20147.9 Da. However, the observed molecular masses at pH 7.4 are 13,122 ± 882 and 21,718 ± 1263 Da for 13F3 and13–14F3, suggesting that there is a tendency to aggregate at higher pH. Precipitation of NMR samples of 13F3 was indeed observed at higher pH; therefore, all the NMR experiments were recorded at pH 4.5.Heparin Binding to 13F3; Identification of the Binding SurfaceNMR StudiesInvestigation of the nature of heparin-fibronectin interactions is hampered by the fact that glycosaminoglycans are generally heterogeneous in size and charge density (56Lindahl U. Kjellen L. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1991; 66: 44-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). This study utilized several heparin disaccharides (see Table I) differing in their sulfation pattern; heparin-derived oligosaccharides (IV-61, highly sulfated), hexasaccharide and octasaccharide (prepared from bovine lung heparin, which is known to have a high degree of sulfation in the heparin chain), and low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) (from porcine intestinal mucosal and bovine lung) from Sigma.The heparin-binding site on 13F3 was investigated by titrating 15N-labeled 13F3 with heparin oligosaccharides while monitoring chemical shift changes in1H-15N HSQC spectra. Of four disaccharides, only one, I-S, showed binding to 13F3, whereas the other three did not bind even at very high concentrations. I-S did not bind, however, in the presence of 150 mm NaCl. All other oligosaccharides including LMWH induced significant chemical shift changes at physiological ionic strength. In all HSQC spectra, a single set of resonances was obtained, and shifts were observed at each addition of heparin until saturation, indicating that binding was on the fast exchange time scale relative to the 1H and15N resonance frequency differences between free and bound13F3. The results are consistent with earlier studies that showed that trisulfated oligosaccharide binds best to the Hep-2 region (57Walker A. Gallagher J.T. Biochem. J. 1996; 317: 871-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 58Lyon M. Rushton G. Askari J.A. Humphries M.J. Gallagher J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4599-4606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar).The differential chemical shift changes experienced by the13F3 backbone amide resonances in the presence of various oligosaccharides or low M r heparin were very similar. The results are illustrated in Fig. 1 for oligosaccharide IV-61, LMWH, and hexasaccharide. To map these effects on the protein backbone, the sum of the magnitude of the changes in 1H and 15N chemical shifts was calculated with a weighting factor applied to15N chemical shifts to compensate for the larger15N chemical shift range (59Shuker S.B. Hajduk P.J. Meadows R.P. Fesik S.W. Science. 1996; 274: 1531-1534Crossref PubMed Scopus (1797) Google Scholar, 60Wishart D.S. Sykes B.D. Richards F.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 222: 311-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (1780) Google Scholar). Oligosaccharides of higher molecular mass than IV-61 were also tested, as stronger binding is expected because of the increased charge of the ligand, but higher oligosaccharides caused protein precipitation possibly because of oligosaccharide-mediated protein aggregation.Commercially available heparins are typically heterogeneous with respect to degree of sulfation and molecular weight (61Gallagher J.T. Turnbull J.E. Glycobiology. 1992; 2: 523-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 62Yanagishita M. Hascall V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9451-9454Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The hexasaccharide prepared from bovine lung heparin is the most homogeneous preparation among all the oligosaccharide used in this study. LMWH, IV-61, and bovine lung hexasaccharide were from different sources and of different homogeneity, but each binds to13F3, affecting the same residues. Therefore, the heterogeneity within each sample has no effect on binding.Most of the protein residues experience no chemical shift perturbation, indicating that heparin binding does not alter the overall protein structure (Fig. 2). The following residues in 13F3 exhibit large changes in their backbone1H, 15N chemical shifts upon addition of heparin: Ser-3, Arg-9, Arg-23, Thr-24, Lys-25, Thr-26, Glu-27, Ile-29, and Ser-55 (Δδ > 0.1). Ala-2, Arg-6, Arg-7, Ala-8, Val-10, Ser-55, Tyr-72, Ser-81, and Val-83 also show changes in chemical shifts, albeit smaller (0.05 ≤ Δδ < 0.1) (the above list is based on the results of all three oligosaccharides, LMWH, IV-61, and bovine lung hexasaccharide; see Fig. 1). All the affected residues lie in the triple-stranded β-sheet portion of13F3. Of the six basic residues (Arg-6, Arg-7, Arg-9, Arg-23, Lys-25, and Lys-54), which have been proposed to be involved in heparin binding, we found that only three of them, Arg-9, Arg-23, and Lys-25 exhibit strong perturbation. The slight perturbation observed for Arg-6 and Arg-7 contrasts with mutagenesis (34Busby T.F. Argraves W.S. Brew S.A. Pechik I. Gilliland G.L. Ingham K.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18558-18562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) data, showing that these residues are critical for heparin binding. It is worth noting that chemical shift mapping of backbone resonances as done here may not give a representative view of the role of side chains in ligand binding (see for example Ref. 63Mayo K.H.

Residues that are present in β-strands do not show a large shift (Fig. 3). Ser-3, which is in the loop region, shows the strongest perturbation, whereas Ser-21 and Ser-55, which are present in β-strands, show very weak perturbation. The polar side chain of the residues Thr-24, Thr-26, and Glu-27 may form hydrogen bonds with the oligosaccharide as seen in several heparin-fibroblast growth factor complex structures (64DiGabriele A.D.

Under the same conditions as used for 13F3, 15N and1H chemical shifts of residues in 14F3 were not significantly perturbed by the heparin oligosaccharides or disaccharides tested, even at very high concentrations (residues 90–179, Fig. 4).Figure 3Mapping of the heparin-binding site in module13F3 is indicated by showing those residues that undergo chemical shift perturbation. Backbone residues with relatively large changes in chemical shift (Δδ ≥ 0.1) are shown inblue, whereas residues with shifts in the range (0.05 ≤ Δδ ≤ 0.1) are shown in white.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 4Weighted chemical shift differences observed on the addition of low molecular weight heparin to the13–14F3 pair (a) and the isolated13F3 and 14F3 (b) modules plotted together.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The NMR titration with 13–14F3 was performed similarly to those with individual 13F3 and 14F3 modules; the results are shown in Fig. 4 a. Titration of13–14F3 did not show any significant change in backbone chemical shift compared with residues from module 14F3 (Fig. 4 b). The residues of the 14F3 module in the pair do not show any significant change as observed for the isolated 14F3 module. The residues in 13F3 region are, however, affected in a very similar way to those in the individual 13F3 module. These data, therefore, indicate the presence of one dominant binding site within the first 29 residues of13F3. Fig. 5 shows the fractional change in the chemical shifts of backbone amide proton of affected residues upon the addition of heparin. We can, thus, conclude that the dominant heparin binding site is on module 13F3 and that, under the experimental conditions used, binding to14F3, whether on its own or attached to 13F3, is insignificant.Figure 5The fractional change in chemical shift f δ observed on the addition of heparin for a few selected resonances of 13F3 (a) and 13–14F3 (b). f δi is defined as ‖ςi/Δς‖, where Δς = ςfinal− ςinitial.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The salt-dependent binding of heparin (the13–14F3-heparin complex can be disrupted by increasing ionic strength) supports the notion that the charge density is an important requirement for interaction. Because the low molecular weight heparin gives the same binding site as hexasaccharide and octasaccharides, there is no evidence for an extended site to which longer oligosaccharides bind, indicating that the heparin sequence that binds to the protein is no more than a hexasaccharide in length.ITC StudiesThe binding of lowM r heparin to 13F3,14F3, and 13–14F3 was also analyzed by ITC. Although 13F3 and 13–14F3 showed binding with low M r heparin, 14F3 did not under these conditions. Representative titrations of lowM r heparin with 13F3 and13–14F3 are presented in Fig. 6. Although an interaction with heparin is observed with 13F3, the plot of heat evolved against molar ratio cannot be confidently defined by a simple model corresponding to a single binding site, preventing an accurate determination of enthalpy of binding, stoichiometry, and affinity. This complexity may result from processes additional to the direct protein heparin interaction and is supported by the observation of precipitation of the 13F3 sample at the end of the experiment when conditions were explored. In contrast, the binding of low M r heparin to 13–14F3 exhibited a good distribution, and the data fit to a single binding site model. Heparin binding was characterized by a K A of 3.5 ± 0.4 × 105m−1(K D 2.9 μm), ΔH 0 of −4079 ± 66 cal/mol, ΔS 0 of 12.13 cal/mol/K, and stoichiometry of 1.1 ± 0.01. This binding is enthalpically dominated, and generally, a positive ΔS 0 is a strong indication that water molecules have been expelled from the complex interface. The main limitation in determination of exact thermodynamic parameters is uncertainty in the measurement of heparin concentration; the quoted K D is therefore an apparent value. TableII summarizes previously reported binding constants of heparin with Hep-2 region of fibronectin. The values are all of a similar order of magnitude, as observed with13–14F3. Interaction of heparin with 13F3 and13–14F3 but not 14F3 in these experiments supports the results of the NMR analyses that the heparin-binding site is limited to the 13F3, although 13–14F3 may be more stable in solution than 13F3 on its own.Figure 6Calorimetric titration of 13F3 (42 μm) (a) and13–14F3 (50 μm) (b) with low molecular weight heparin (2 mm) in 50 mm acetate buffer containing 150 mm NaCl at pH 4.5. The upper panels show heat released per the addition of 5 μl of heparin sample from the syringe.

There are three classes of PI3Ks. The type I enzymes seem to act as PtdIns(4,5)P2 3-kinases in vivo; they can be activated by a variety of close-to-receptor transduction events and drive accumulation of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 in the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane.

J. 1998; 335: 139-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). All of the above PI3K effectors bind 3-phosphorylated lipids via a PH domain. PH domains are protein modules of ∼100 amino acids that bind a variety of ligands ranging from inositol phosphates and phosphoinositides to possibly G-protein βγ-subunits (18Haslam R.J. Koide H.B. Hemmings B.A. Nature. 1993; 363: 309-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar, 19Lemmon M.A. Ferguson K.M. Biochem. J. 2000; 350: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar). Those PH domains that bind phosphoinositides specifically form a subset that can be recognized via a consensus sequence of basic residues implicated in binding. Initially this concept was based solely on a limited number of sequence alignments, however, as more phosphoinositide binding PH domains were characterized the early consensus has been evolved and further validated by work that has described the structure of a number of PH domains, some with phosphoinositide-based ligands bound (20Ferguson K.M. Kavran J.M. Sankaran V.G. Fournier E. Isakoff S.J. Skolnik E.Y. Lemmon M.A. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 373-384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). Many different types of proteins seem to use PH domains as phosphoinositide binding modules including enzymes (e.g. PKB, BTK, Vav, and PDK-1) and adaptor proteins (e.g. DAPP-1). It is generally thought that phosphoinositide-dependent shifts in signaling proteins from predominantly cytosolic to membrane distributions are, in some way, activating. In the case of PKB this seems to result from co-localization with its upstream regulator PDK-1 combined with increased availability of the site PDK phosphorylates (threonine 308 in PKBα) as a result of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3binding (21Vanhaesebroeck B. Alessi D.R. Biochem. J. 2000; 15: 561-576Google Scholar). For DAPP-1, which has been claimed to bind PLC-γ (11Marshall A.J. Niiro H. Lerner C.G. Yun T.J. Thomas S. Disteche C.M. Clark E.A. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 191: 1319-1332Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), it is presumably the relocation of the PLC-γ, to the cell surface and the location of its phospholipid substrate that could be relevant. Through the application of PI3K inhibitors, some of which have been described above, it has become clear that type I PI3K signaling regulates a huge variety of cellular responses. One of the most widely important of these is cell survival (22Marte B.M. Downward J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 355-358Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar). In essence PI3Ks and PKB are thought to supply a signal from some receptors that block cells from undergoing apoptosis (23Khwaja A. Rodriguez-Viciana P. Wennstrom S. Warne P.H. Downward J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2783-2793Crossref PubMed Scopus (933) Google Scholar). These signals operate constitutively in the presence of relatively low levels of survival factors but their inactivation upon factor withdrawal leads rapidly to apoptosis (1Vanhaesebroeck B. Leevers S.J. Ahmadi K. Timms J. Katso R. Driscoll P.C. Woscholski R. Parker P.J. Waterfield M.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 535-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (1362) Google Scholar). Filamins are actin-binding proteins that act to stabilize large three-dimensional actin networks, through their ability to dimerize (24Stossel T.P. Condeelis J. Cooley L. Hartwig J.H. Noegel A. Schleicher M. Shapiro S.S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 138-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (817) Google Scholar, 25Van der Flier A. Sonnenberg A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1538: 99-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). Mammals can make α-, β-, and γ-filamins that possess different tissue distributions. The filamins also seem to bind to a variety of membrane-associated structural or signaling proteins, typically via a region of the molecule that does not interfere with the actin-binding or dimerization domains and these include, cytoplasmic tails of integrins and receptors. Hence filamins can be seen as structural proteins contributing directly to the mechanical properties of the cytoskeleton but also as points at which a variety of cell-surface signals can converge on the actin cytoskeleton. In this article we describe the identification, cloning, and expression of a PH domain-containing protein that binds PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 and behaves as a PtdIns(3,4,5)P3-effector but also associates with γ-filamin and undergoes a novel redistribution in response to reductions in PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 levels. The cDNA encoding the full-length open reading frame of LL5β was obtained via the I.M.A.G.E. clones 531882 (accession numbers, aa116053), 208876 (accession number, h63748), and 82052 (accession number, t68150), which were all obtained from the I.M.A.G.E Consortium (UK HGMP Resource Centre, Hinxton, United Kingdom). The full-length open reading frame of LL5β (3762 bp) was ligated in-frame with an amino-terminal Myc or Glu-Glu tag into pCMV3, pEGFP (Clontech), or the pGEX 4T1 (AmershamBiosciences) bacterial expression vectors. Point mutants at the PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 binding motif (K1162A and R1163A), LL5βΔPH (residues 1–1138), and the isolated PH domain (residues 1138–1253) were generated by a PCR-based mutagenic strategy and ligated in-frame with an amino-terminal Myc or Glu-Glu (Glu-Glu) tag into pCMV3, pEGFP, and the pGEX4T1 expression vectors. All inserts were verified by sequence analysis (Babraham Technix). Full-length γ-filamin cDNA was a kind gift from Dominic Chung (University of Washington). PAE cells expressing wild-type or mutant (Y740F/Y751F) PDGF-β receptor were maintained in F-12 nutrient mixture (Ham's F-12, Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (HI-FBS, Invitrogen). COS-7 cells were maintained in DMEM (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% HI-FBS (Invitrogen). All cells were maintained at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 humidified atmosphere and were not allowed to reach confluence. PAE and COS-7 cells were transfected by electroporation with 20 μg of total plasmid DNA as described previously (10Anderson K.E. Lipp P. Bootman M. Ridley S.H. Coadwell J. Ronnstrand L. Lennartsson J. Holmes A.B. Painter G.F. Thuring J. Lim Z. Erdjument-Bromage H. Grewal A. Tempst P. Stephens L.R. Hawkins P.T. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 1403-1412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Transfected PAE cells were plated onto glass coverslips (∼8 × 104 cells per coverslip) in Ham's F-12 media containing 10% HI-FBS for 12 h, then serum starved for 6–8 h in F-12 media supplemented with 0.5% fatty acid-free BSA, in the presence of 1 units/ml penicillin and 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen). Transfected COS-7 cells were plated onto glass coverslips (∼8 × 104 cells per coverslip) in DMEM containing 10% FBS for 12–16 h, then serum starved for 12 h in DMEM supplemented with 0.5% fatty acid-free BSA, in the presence of 1 unit/ml penicillin and 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin. Twelve hours following transfection of PAE cells with GFP-LL5β, cells were washed with F-12 media either containing 10% FBS or 0.1% fatty acid-free BSA for 2 h. Cells were trypsinized, treated with trypsin inhibitor (Sigma), and left in suspension (end-on end rotation) for either 30 min or 2 h at 37 °C in Hepes-buffered F-12 media (pH 7.2). Cells were then washed, resuspended in PBS, and cytospun (300 rpm for 3 min) onto coverslips, fixed in paraformaldehyde, and examined under fluorescence microscopy. Transfected cells were grown on coverslips and serum-starved as described above. Cells were then washed and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min in F-12 media containing 0.5% fatty acid-free BSA, 30 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), and 1 unit/ml penicillin and 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin prior to stimulation for the indicated times. Cells were treated with human PDGF (B-B10 ng/ml) (Autogen Bioclear) for 5 min, latrunculin B (10 μg/ml) (Sigma) for 10 min, or wortmannin (100 nm, Sigma) for 15 min. Following treatment, cells were promptly fixed by incubating with buffer containing 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature followed by 3 washes with 150 mm Tris (pH 7.4). Depending on the requirement of the primary antibody, in some cases, cells were fixed in ice-cold 100% methanol for 5 min and rinsed in dH2O. For cells transfected with GFP constructs, coverslips were then rinsed in dH2O and mounted on slides using Aqua Polymount (Polysciences Inc.). A series of dyes for detection of mitochondria (mitotracker red, 100 nm, 15 min; Molecular Probes), lysosomes (lysotracker red, 50 nm, 30 min; Molecular Probes), and the transferrin receptor conjugated to Texas Red dye (marker for endosomes, 3 min for early endosomes and 10 min for late endosomes) were added to live cells expressing GFP contructs prior to fixation. For all other immunofluorescence studies, cells were fixed and permeabilized in PBS, 0.1% Triton X-100 for 10 min, washed three times in PBS, then incubated with PBS + 1% BSA (w/v) for 30 min at room temperature before being incubated with anti-Myc monoclonal antibody anti-clathrin polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-EEA1 monoclonal antibody (Transduction Laboratories), anti-caveolin-1 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), TRITC-phalloidin (Sigma), anti-α-tubulin (Sigma), anti-vinculin (Sigma), or anti-PMP70 antibody (Sigma), as indicated for 1 h at room temperature. Coverslips were washed three times for 5 min in PBS + 0.5% BSA and then incubated with the appropriate secondary fluorescein isothiocyanate/RITC-conjugated antibody (1 h at room temperature). Coverslips were then washed four times in PBS + 0.5% BSA (5 min), PBS (5 min), then rinsed in dH2O before being mounted onto slides, allowed to dry, and viewed under a Zeiss Axiophot fluorescence microscope. Images were captured using a SPOT digital camera (Diagnostic Instruments). Cells were transfected, cultured on sterile glass coverslips, and treated as described above. For imaging, coverslips were mounted on the stage of an Olympus 1 × 70 microscope interfaced with an UltraView confocal system. The cells were imaged at 37 °C using a thermostatically controlled cell chamber and incubated in PAE salt solution (25 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 1.8 mmCaCl2, 5.37 mm KCl, 0.81 mmMgSO4, 112.5 mm NaCl, 25 mm d-glucose, 1 mm NaHCO3, and 0.1% (w/v) fatty acid-free BSA). Time-lapse images of GFP-transfected cells were obtained using an UltraView confocal microscope (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). GFP fluorescence was excited at 488 nm and the emission was collected at wavelengths >505 nm using a long pass filter. Typically, 12 bit ∼600 × 400 pixel images were captured every 2–3 s. A 745-bp fragment encoding the unique NH2 terminus of LL5β was used as a probe for Northern blot analysis. The probe was labeled with [γ-32P]dCTP (Amersham Biosciences) and the Prime-a-Gene labeling system (Promega). The radioactive probe was applied to multiple tissue Northern blots containing RNA from various human tissues obtained from Clontech and carried out according to the recommended protocol. 1 × 107 COS-7 cells were transfected by electroporation with 20 μg of the DNA construct encoding Myc-tagged LL5β. Cells were allowed to recover in DMEM containing 10% HI-FBS in two 15-cm diameter dishes for 48 h and were washed and lysed with 5 ml/dish of lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.5), 0.12m NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm EGTA, 5 mm β glycerophosphate, 1 mm orthovanadate, 10 mm NaF). Lysates were centrifuged (190,000 ×g av for 30 min). Samples of the supernatants (0.5 ml) were mixed with 50 μm free dipalmitoyl forms of competing phosphoinositides (16Krugmann S. Anderson K.E.

They were transferred to 5-μl packed PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 beads (16Krugmann S. Anderson K.E. Ridley S.H. Risso N. McGregor A. Coadwell J. Davidson K. Eguinoa A. Ellson C.D. Lipp P. Manifava M.

Sedimented beads were washed (4 times, <15 min) in modified lysis buffer (0.1% Nonidet P-40 rather than 1% Nonidet P-40). Proteins were eluted with SDS sample buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and detected by immunoblotting (anti-Myc (monoclonal)). Recombinant proteins, GST-LL5β and GST-LL5βΔPH, were expressed in bacteria and purified on GS-Sepharose beads. The glutathione-Sepharose beads bound to GST LL5β and GST-LL5βΔPH were used to “pull down” interacting proteins from COS-7 cell lysates. Previously seeded COS-7 cells were washed twice in PBS and left in Met- and Cys-free DMEM for 35 min. Then, 0.2 mCi of [35S]methionine and [35S]cysteine (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was added 16 h prior to lysis. Lysates were centrifuged for 10 min at 4 °C at 13,000 × g av and supernatants were transferred to 2 μg of GST LL5β and GST-LL5βΔPH purified on 30 μl of glutathione-Sepharose beads, and allowed to mix for 2 h at 4 °C. Four washes were then carried out in lysis buffer (30 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), 10 mm NaF, 5 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mmMgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 110 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol) followed by a final wash in modified lysis buffer containing 0.25% Nonidet P-40 instead of 1% Nonidet P-40. Proteins were eluted in SDS sample buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE, the gel dried down onto Whatman paper, and exposed to x-ray film for 2 days at −70 °C. In preparation for the trypsin digestion of the interacting protein, the above pull-down method was carried out on a larger scalewithout 35S labeling; the SDS-PAGE gel was stained with Coomassie Blue and the relevant band cut out and further cut into gel slices of ∼1 mm3. This was washed in 3× 50% acetonitrile, 25 mm NH4 bicarbonate (pH 8), then soaked in 100% acetonitrile for 5 min, and dried in a 5200 centrifugal concentrator for 20 min. 10 μg of excision grade trypsin (Sigma) in 25 mm NH4 bicarbonate (pH 8) was added to the dried gel slices and digested at 37 °C for 16 h. Extraction of peptides was carried out by soaking the gel slice in 50% acetonitrile, 5% trifluoroacetic acid for 30 min with gentle agitation. A second extraction was carried out as above and the combined extracts were dried as before for 1 h. The dried sample was then reconstituted by adding 4 μl of 50% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The generated peptides were then analyzed at Applied Biosystems by a mass spectrometer (Qstar PulsarI). Using the consensus Lys-Xaa-Gly/Ser-Xaa(6–11)-Arg/Lys-Xaa-Arg-Phe/Leu in 1996 (26Isakoff S.J. Cardozo T. Andreev J., Li, Z. Ferguson K.M. Abagyan R. Lemmon M.A. Aronheim A. Skolnik E.Y. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5374-5387Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar) we identified a partial human protein sequence in the NCB1/EMBL protein expressed sequence tag data base encoding the COOH-terminal domain of a protein, previously called LL5 (rat) (27Levi L. Hanukoglu I. Raikhinstein M. Kohen F. Koch Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1216: 342-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), that we predicted would bind PtdIns(3,4,5)P3. Sequencing the relevant Image clone (82052) revealed upstream overlaps with further expressed sequence tags and iteration identified a potential upstream start codon with an in-frame stop immediately upstream. Although we began searching for the human orthologue of rat LL5, we ended up with the open reading frame of a paralogue of the human orthologue of rat LL5. The predicted open reading frame was for a 160-kDa protein (see Fig. 1 A) and a full-length clone (accession number AJ496194) was created from Image clones 531883, 208876, and 82052. The protein contains a single spectrin repeat and a COOH-terminal PH domain. The same PH domain was also identified as a potential PtdIns(3,4,5)P3-binding protein in a screen by Isakoff et al. (26Isakoff S.J. Cardozo T. Andreev J., Li, Z. Ferguson K.M. Abagyan R. Lemmon M.A. Aronheim A. Skolnik E.Y. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5374-5387Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar) and subsequently by Dowler et al. (28Dowler S. Currie R.A. Campbell D.G. Deak M. Kular G. Downes C.P. Alessi D.R. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 19-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar) (who called the host protein LL5β and a closely related molecule LL5α, which is the human orthologue of the rat LL5). We will retain the nomenclature Dowler et al. (28Dowler S. Currie R.A. Campbell D.G. Deak M. Kular G. Downes C.P. Alessi D.R. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 19-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar) applied to the PH domain of this protein and hence will term it LL5β. LL5α and LL5β are different proteins that occur at different locations and have less than 70% identity at the protein level. A 745-bp probe from the NH2-terminal region of LL5β, which would not recognize LL5α, was used to analyze a Northern blot prepared from human tissues. A 6-kb band was detected in a number of tissues with the highest levels found in heart, kidney, and placenta (see Fig. 1 B). Expression plasmids encoding NH2-terminal Myc- and GFP-tagged LL5β (and various constructs, see below) were prepared and transiently transfected into COS-7 and PAE cells. Anti-Myc immunoblots of appropriately transfected PAE or COS-7 cells revealed a 160-kDa protein (see Fig. 2 A). We analyzed the lipid binding specificity of LL5β in vitro. Cytosolic fractions were prepared from COS-7 cells transfected with Myc-LL5β and mixed with Affi-Gel beads covalently attached to PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 (16Krugmann S. Anderson K.E. Ridley S.H. Risso N. McGregor A. Coadwell J. Davidson K. Eguinoa A. Ellson C.D. Lipp P. Manifava M. Ktistakis N. Painter G. Thuring J.W. Cooper M.A. Lim Z.Y. Holmes A.B. Dove S.K. Michell R.H. Grewal A. Nazarian A.

The beads were washed, and bound proteins were eluted and immunoblotted with anti-Myc antibody. This revealed that ∼1–2% of input LL5β was recovered on the beads. Various competing, free phosphoinositides were added to the binding reactions and this revealed that PtdIns(3,4,5)P3most effectively displaced LL5β from the beads (see Fig 2B); indicating that LL5β can bind PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 selectively under these assay conditions. Mutations in the PH domain predicted to disrupt lipid binding (LL5βΔPH and LL5β-K1162A/R1163A) abolished LL5β binding to the PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 beads (Fig. 2 C). We transiently expressed Myc- or GFP-LL5β in PAE cells stably overexpressing the PDGFβ receptor. In the presence of serum or after only short periods of serum starvation (up to 6 h), the LL5β constructs appeared predominantly cytosolic in fixed cells. After prolonged serum starvation (8 h or more) a significant proportion of Myc- or GFP-LL5β become particulate apparently at the expense of the cytosolic pool in both living or fixed cells. After approximately 6 h of serum starvation, when the protein was predominantly cytosolic, stimulation with PDGF resulted in a partial translocation of both Myc- and GFP-LL5β to the edge of the cell (Fig. 3). This event was observed in both living and fixed cells using confocal and standard epifluorescence microscopes. The translocation was apparently more prolonged than that displayed by proteins such as DAPP-1 or PKB studied under similar conditions. Furthermore, it appeared that the peripheral accumulation of LL5β constructs correlated with reductions in both its cytosolic and particulate pools (also see below). PAE cells were similarly transfected with a GFP-tagged form of the isolated PH domain of LL5β. It did not translocate to the edge of the cell in response to PI3K stimulation. However, we note that although full-length GAP1m translocates to the cell membrane in a PI3K-dependent manner, the isolated PH domain does not translocate when expressed as an independent module. 2P. J. Cullen, personal communication. In an attempt to assess the PI3K dependence of this response we preincubated PAE cells transiently expressing Myc- or GFP-LL5β with LY294002 or wortmannin, however, there was a profound redistribution of both constructs in response to the PI3K inhibitors alone that was observed in both living (GFP) or fixed cells (both tags). The cytosolic levels of GFP-LL5β were very substantially reduced and an intracellular vesicular compartment, apparently identical to that seen in cells after prolonged serum starvation, became decorated (Fig. 4 A, see also Supplementary Material for a video showing the effects of wortmannin on the distribution of GFP-LL5β in living PAE cells). We have not seen this phenomenon before in the context of similar experiments with PAE cells studying proteins such as PDK-1, PKB, ARAP-3, PRex-1, and DAPP-1 (10Anderson K.E. Lipp P. Bootman M.

https://openalex.org/W2053492909,"Coactivators such as TIF2 and SRC-1 modulate the positioning of the dose-response curve for agonist-bound glucocorticoid receptors (GRs) and the partial agonist activity of antiglucocorticoid complexes. These properties of coactivators differ from their initially defined activities of binding to, and increasing the total levels of transactivation by, agonist-bound steroid receptors. We now report that constructs of TIF2 and SRC-1 lacking the two activation domains (AD1 and AD2) have significantly less ability to increase transactivation but retain most of the activity for modulating the dose-response curve and partial agonist activity. Mammalian two-hybrid experiments show that the minimum TIF2 segment with modulatory activity (TIF2.4) does not interact with p300, CREB-binding protein, or PCAF, which also modulates GR activities. DRIP150 and DRIP205 have been implicated in coactivator actions but are unable to modulate GR activities. The absence of synergism by PCAF or DRIP150 with SRC-1 or TIF2, respectively, further suggests that these other factors are not involved. The ability of a TIF2.4 fragment (i.e. TIF2.37), which is not known to interact with proteins, to block the actions of TIF2.4 suggests that an unidentified binder mediates the modulatory activity of TIF2. Pull-down experiments with GST/TIF2.4 demonstrate a direct interaction of TIF2 with GR in a hormone-dependent fashion that requires the receptor interaction domains of TIF2 and is equally robust with agonists and most antiglucocorticoids. These observations, which are confirmed in mammalian two-hybrid assays, suggest that the capacity of coactivators such as TIF2 to modulate the partial agonist activity of antisteroids is mediated by the binding of coactivators to GR-antagonist complexes. In conclusion, the modulatory activity of coactivators with GR-agonist and -antagonist complexes is mechanistically distinct from the ability of coactivators to augment the total levels of transactivation and appears to involve the binding to both GR-steroid complexes and an unidentified TIF2-associated factor(s).

Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1638-1651Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar), is considered important. In general, the comodulators are thought to bind only to the p160 coactivators (13Liu Z. Wong J.

Chem. 2000; 275: 40810-40816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). However, PCAF, which was initially identified as a binder of p300/CBP (16Yang X.-J. Ogryzko V.V. Nishikawa J.-i. Howard B.H. Nakatani Y. Nature. 1996; 382: 319-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (1315) Google Scholar), has also been reported to bind to glucocorticoid receptors in pull-down assays in a ligand-independent fashion (14Blanco J.C.G. Minucci S. Lu J. Yang X.-J. Walker K.K. Chen H. Evans R.M. Nakatani Y. Ozato K. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1638-1651Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the ligand-dependent association of PCAF with retinoic acid receptors is different from its association with SRC-1 or p/CIP (=AIB1) (17Korzus E. Torchia J. Rose D.W. Xu L. Kurokawa R. McInerney E.M. Mullen T.-M. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Science. 1998; 279: 703-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar). The multiprotein complexes called DRIP/TRAP/Mediator are thought to be recruited by the above coactivator-comodulator complexes to relay the original signal from the steroid receptors (18Fondell J.D. Guermah M. Malik S. Roeder R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1959-1964Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 19Freedman L.P. Cell. 1999; 97: 5-8Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). These complexes are proposed then to modify other components of the transcriptional complex to give the final transcriptional response. We have recently shown that another property of the p160 coactivators is to modulate both the dose-response curve of agonists,i.e. the concentration of steroid required for half-maximal induction (EC50), and the partial agonist activity of antagonists. This behavior has been seen for glucocorticoid receptors (GR) (20Szapary D. Huang Y. Simons Jr., S.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 2108-2121Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 21Chen S.

Endocrinol. 2002; (in press)Google Scholar) and progesterone receptors (23Giannoukos G. Szapary D. Smith C.L. Meeker J.E.W. Simons Jr., S.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 255-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). This modulation of the dose-response curve (or EC50) and of the partial agonist activity of antisteroids has important theoretical and clinical consequences. The EC50 for induction of most genes is near the physiological levels of hormone. Therefore, changes in the EC50 of one steroid-responsive gene versusanother will both cause different levels of induction from the two genes by endogenous steroids and provide a sensitive mechanism for the differential control of expression of these two genes during development, differentiation, and homeostasis. Antagonists are extremely useful in endocrine therapies to inhibit the actions of endogenous hormones in situations such as inflammation (24Vayssiere B.M. Dupont S. Choquart A. Petit F. Garcia T. Marchandeau C. Gronemeyer H. Resche-Rigon M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 1245-1255Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar), conception (25Baulieu E.E. Science. 1989; 245: 1351-1357Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar), and hormone-dependent cancers (26Crawford E.D. Eisenberger M.A. McLeod D.G. Spaulding J.T. Benson R. Dorr F.A.

Rev. 1990; 11: 578-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar) but often produce undesirable side effects. If one could increase the partial agonist activity for genes other than the one to be suppressed, this would greatly reduce the number of side effects that result from the indiscriminate repression of all responsive genes. Interestingly, the overexpression of corepressors (SMRT and NCoR) (28Chen J.D. Evans R.M. Nature. 1995; 377: 454-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (1707) Google Scholar,29Horlein A.J. Naar A.M. Heinzel T.

Nature. 1995; 377: 397-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (1705) Google Scholar) often produces a response opposite to that of increased coactivators. Thus, corepressors can cause both a right shift in the dose-response curve to higher EC50 values and a decrease in the partial agonist activity of antisteroids for GR (20Szapary D. Huang Y. Simons Jr., S.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 2108-2121Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 30Song L.-N. Huse B. Rusconi S. Simons Jr., S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24806-24816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) and progesterone receptors (23Giannoukos G. Szapary D. Smith C.L. Meeker J.E.W. Simons Jr., S.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 255-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 30Song L.-N. Huse B. Rusconi S. Simons Jr., S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24806-24816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the ability of added SMRT to antagonize the actions of overexpressed TIF2 suggests that the final responses are determined by an equilibrium reaction with receptors that depends upon the ratio of coactivators to corepressors (20Szapary D. Huang Y. Simons Jr., S.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 2108-2121Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Despite the major quantitative effects on steroid receptor gene transactivation that are caused by varying the intracellular levels of coactivators, only general features of the mechanism by which coactivators modulate steroid receptor induction properties are known. The ability of coactivators to augment the total amount of induced gene transcripts requires coactivator binding to the agonist-bound receptors and may result from more efficient binding/recruitment of transcription complex core factors (31Chi T. Lieberman P. Ellwood K. Carey M. Nature. 1995; 377: 254-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 32Dove S.L. Joung J.K. Hochschild A. Nature. 1997; 386: 627-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). In contrast, the conventional model of steroid hormone action is silent on how coactivators might change either the EC50, and the position of the dose-response curve, or the partial agonist activity of antisteroids. In fact, the current thinking is that coactivators do not interact with antagonist-bound receptors (1McKenna N.J. Lanz R.B. O'Malley B.W. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 321-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (1652) Google Scholar, 3Robyr D. Wolffe A.P. Wahli W. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 329-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar, 11Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 121-141Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), in which case the modulation of the partial agonist activity of antisteroid complexes by coactivators would have to involve indirect interactions. Whereas the ability of coactivators to increase the total levels of transactivation with receptor-agonist complexes proceeds via binding to receptors, it is not known if similar interactions are required for the modulation of the EC50, and the dose-response curve, of receptor-agonist complexes. One indication that separate pathways are involved comes from studies with TIF2, which does not contain the intrinsic HAT activity that is associated with many coactivators (1McKenna N.J. Lanz R.B. O'Malley B.W. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 321-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (1652) Google Scholar, 3Robyr D. Wolffe A.P. Wahli W. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 329-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar,11Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 121-141Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). TIF2 binds to CBP (8Voegel J.J. Heine M.J.S. Tini M. Vivat V. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 507-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar), although, which does have HAT activity (12Ogryzko V.V. Schiltz R.L. Russanova V. Howard B.H. Nakatani Y. Cell. 1996; 87: 953-959Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2389) Google Scholar). However, the ability of TIF2 to modulate GR activities was found to be independent of the HAT activity of CBP (21Chen S. Sarlis N.J. Simons Jr., S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30106-30117Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), which can itself modulate GR transactivation properties (20Szapary D. Huang Y. Simons Jr., S.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 2108-2121Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). A second indication of separate pathways is the observation that several factors can alter the dose-response curve and partial agonist activity of GR complexes in a manner that is independent of their effects on total transcriptional activity of GR (20Szapary D. Huang Y. Simons Jr., S.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 2108-2121Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 30Song L.-N. Huse B. Rusconi S. Simons Jr., S.S. J. Biol.

Chem. 2002; 277: 12541-12549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Finally, a recent report indicates that TIF2 acts via a rate-limiting intermediate or step that does not regulate the total levels of receptor-mediated gene induction (21Chen S. Sarlis N.J. Simons Jr., S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30106-30117Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The purpose of this study, therefore, was to examine in greater detail whether the intrinsic ability of a coactivator to increase the total transactivation of GR is required for its ability to modulate the EC50, or dose-response curve, of GR-agonist complexes and the partial agonist activity of GR-antagonist complexes. We took the approach of asking if the minimal domains of coactivators that are required for GR modulation are the same or different from those needed for conventional coactivator activity. At the same time, we inquired if the effects of this minimal modulatory domain could be replaced by any other proteins that are thought to interact with the p160 coactivators. The ability of receptor-antagonist complexes to interact with coactivators was also determined. From these studies, we conclude that the modulation of GR transactivation activities involves direct interactions of coactivators with both GR-agonist and -antagonist complexes in a manner that is mediated by parameters that are unrelated to both the conventional coactivator domains and known coactivator-associated proteins.

For pSG5/TIF2.37, the primers were 5′-CGGGATCCACCATGAAAGATGATACTAAAGATATTGGTTTACC-3′ and 5′-CGGGATCCCTACCCTATATTCATGACCTGAG-3′. For pSG5/TIF2.38, the primers were 5′-CGGGATCCACCATGAAAGATGATACTAAAGATATTGGTTTACC-3′ and 5′-CGGGATCCCTAAGCTCCCTCATCACTCGGAG-3′. In both cases, the amplified DNA was then cut with BamHI and inserted into theBamHI site of pSG5. GAL/TIF2.4 was prepared by first amplifying the TIF2.4 fragment by PCR from pSG5-TIF2.4 using 5′-GGAATTCGAGAGAGCTGACGGGCAGAGC-3′ and 5′-CGGGATCCCTACCCTATATTCATGACCTGAG-3′ as primers. The PCR product was cut with BamHI and EcoRI and inserted into theBamHI and EcoRI sites of the GAL plasmid (pm, Clontech). GAL/TIF2.4m123 was constructed by the same method except that pSG5-TIF2.4m123 was used as the template. For VP16/TIF2.4, the TIF2.4 fragment was cut from GAL/TIF2.4 and inserted into the BamHI and EcoRI sites of the VP16 plasmid (Clontech). For VP16/ TIF2.3, the TIF2.3 fragment was PCR amplified from pSG5-TIF2.3 with 5′-GGAATTCGAGAGAGCTGACGGGCAGAGC-3′ and 5′-CTGTCTCATCATTTTGGC-3′, cut with BamHI and EcoRI, and inserted into theBamHI and EcoRI sites of VP16 plasmid. PGEX-TIF2.4 and GAL/TIF2.4m123 were prepared by excising the TIF2.4 (or TIF2.4m123) fragment from GAL/TIF2.4 (or GAL/TIF2.4m123) and inserting it into the EcoRI and SalI sites of pGEX-6p-1 (Amersham Biosciences). Monolayer cultures of CV-1 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Biofluids Inc., Rockville, MD) at 37 °C in a humidified incubator (5% CO2). Transient transfections were achieved using calcium phosphate precipitation (39Szapary D. Oshima H. Simons Jr., S.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 941-952PubMed Google Scholar) or 1.0 μl of LipofectAMINE Reagent (Invitrogen) or 0.5 μl of FuGENE 6 (Roche Molecular Diagnostics) in 0.3 ml of Opti-MEM I (Invitrogen) without serum in 24-well plates (10-fold more in 60-mm dishes). As a control for the transfected cofactors, equimolar amounts of the empty plasmid vector were added. The total transfected DNA was adjusted to 300 ng/well of a 24-well plate (or 3 μg/60-mm dish) with pBluescriptII SK+(Stratagene). Renilla TK or TS (5–10 ng/well of a 24-well plate) was included as an internal control. Cells were incubated with plasmid DNA, Opti-MEM I, and LipofectAMINE or FuGENE 6 reagent for 24 h, after which this mixture was replaced by the normal media (10% fetal calf serum, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium). The cells were induced with steroids for 20–24 h and then harvested. The cells were lysed and assayed for reporter gene activity using the Dual Luciferase Assay reagents according to manufacturer's instruction (Promega, Madison, WI). Luciferase activity was measured by an EG&G Berthhold's luminometer (Microlumat LB 96P). The data were normalized either for total protein or Renilla null luciferase activity. The recommended procedure for the Mammalian Matchmaker two-hybrid assay kit (Clontech) was modified slightly by changing from a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter to a Luciferase Reporter pFRLuc (Stratagene), which is under the control of five repeats of the upstream activating sequence for the binding of GAL4. pGEX series of plasmids were transformed into Escherichia coli (BL21; AmershamBiosciences) according to the manufacturer's procedure. A single colony was picked and inoculated into 3 ml of LB broth with 100 ng/ml ampicillin. After overnight culture, 1 ml of bacterial culture was diluted into 50 ml of LB broth containing 100 ng/ml ampicillin, shaken at 37 °C for 2 h, adjusted to 0.1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, and shaken at 37 °C for another 3 h. The cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed once with phosphate-buffered saline, resuspended in 10 ml of phosphate-buffered saline, and sonicated for 30 cycles at 30% of maximum power. The supernatant was collected for use after centrifugation (5000 × g for 20 min). pRBAL-GR (1 μl), 40 μl of Promega TnT (SP6) quick coupled transcription/translation system master mixture, and 2 μl of [35S]methionine (Amersham Biosciences) were brought up to a total volume of 50 μl with H2O and incubated at 30 °C for 90 min according to the manufacturer's (Promega) recommendations. Different steroid hormones (Dex, Dex-Mes, Dex-Ox, progesterone, and RU486) were added into the transcription-translation reaction during the 30 °C incubation to both increase the stability of the synthesized GR and to cause activation of the GR-steroid complex. Sonicated bacterial lysate (0.5 ml) containing overexpressed GST, GAL/TIF2.4, or GAL/TIF2.4m123 was incubated with 20 μl of glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads for 1 h at 0 °C. The mixture was centrifuged (12,000 × g), the supernatant was discarded, and the pellet was washed with phosphate-buffered saline (3 × 1 ml). Each 20-μl sample of immobilized GST or GST-chimera was then incubated overnight with 10 μl of hormone prebound, activated, 35S-labeled GR translation product. The matrix was washed with phosphate-buffered saline (4× 1 ml). The immobilized proteins were removed from the beads by heating at 90 °C for 5 min in 20 μl of 2× SDS loading buffer. The proteins were then separated on 10% SDS-PAGE gels and the bound GR was located by autoradiography. Unless otherwise noted, all experiments were performed in triplicate several times. The error bars in graphs of individual experiments correspond to the S.D. of the triplicate values. KaleidaGraph 3.5 (Synergy Software, Reading, PA) was used to determine a least-squares best fit (R 2was almost always ≥0.95) of the experimental data to the theoretical dose-response curve, which is given by the equation derived from Michaelis-Menten kinetics of y = [free steroid]/([free steroid] + K d) (where the concentration of total steroid is approximately equal to the concentration of free steroid because only a small portion is bound), to yield a single EC50 value. The values of nindependent experiments are then analyzed for statistical significance by the two-tailed Student's t test using the program “InStat 2.03” for Macintosh (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). In paired analyses, all comparisons in a given figure are performed at the same time with the same seeding of cells and then analyzed forn different experiments. TIF2/GRIP1 is one of the three p160 coactivators that increase the total induced levels of gene product with steroid receptors (5Voegel J.J. Heine M.J.S. Zechel C. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H.

Of the various domains of TIF2/GRIP1 that have been identified (Fig. 1 A), the receptor interaction domains (RIDs) and the two activation domains (AD1 and AD2) have been found to be required for full coactivator activity (8Voegel J.J.

Here we describe the functional and structural properties of a set of recombinant FIII9–10 mutants containing various alanine substitutions within the key synergistic site, DRVPHSRN in FIII9, either alone or in combination with another substitution (Leu1408 to Pro), on the opposite face of FIII9, that increases stability and the functional capacity of FIII9–10. We show that the introduction of mutations into the synergistic sequence of FIII9–10 has a negative effect on the adhesion of baby hamster kidney fibroblasts and results in reduced ability of these ligands to recognize integrin α5β1. Conformational stability of the FIII9 domain in the synergy site mutants is likewise reduced in comparison with native FIII9. The Leu1408 to Pro substitution in mutant FIII9–10 proteins carrying substitutions in the synergy site results in a substantial recovery of the adhesive activity of the mutants and affinity to α5β1. In keeping with the enhancement of functional activity, the Leu1408 to Pro substitution in the FIII9–10 synergy site mutants also causes a significant increase in conformational stability of FIII9. These observations imply a strong positive correlation between the biological activity and conformational stability of the assessed FIII9–10 mutants and suggest that a Leu1408 to Pro substitution restores the biological activity of the mutants via their ability to restore their conformational stability. We conclude that domain stability may be a major determinant of the synergistic potential of FIII9. Our data underscore the value of using more than one approach in such structure-function studies and the requirement for validating the global structural integrity of protein ligands in which sequences that disrupt function have been perturbed.

The central cell binding domain, which is known to recognize α5β1, αvβ3, αIIbβ3 and at least eight other integrins, is particularly well characterized (for a review, see Ref. 1Johansson S. Svineng G. Wennerberg K. Armulik A. Lohikangas L. Front. Biosci. 1997; 2: 126-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). This region, spanning type III domains FIII8, FIII9, and FIII10, has become the focus of intensive research as a model for the universal and ubiquitous RGD-driven receptor-ligand interactions. The RGD tripeptide motif, residing on a protruding, flexible loop within the FIII10 module (2Main A.L. Harvey T.S. Baron M. Boyd J. Campbell I.D. Cell. 1992; 71: 671-678Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar, 3Leahy D.J. Aukhil I. Erickson H.P.

Although it is presently not clear by which mechanism an RGD-containing ligand initiates a conformational change in the integrin headpiece and transmittal of the adhesive signal across the plasma membrane, the recent solution of the crystal structure of integrin αvβ3 in complex with an isolated RGD peptide by Xiong et al. (7Xiong J.P. Stehle T. Zhang R. Joachimiak A. Frech M. Goodman S.L. Arnaout M.A. Science. 2002; 296: 151-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (1387) Google Scholar) is an important first step toward elucidating the structural basis of the FIII10-integrin interaction. The FIII9 domain adjacent to FIII10 is known to act in synergy with the latter in promoting integrin-mediated cell adhesion, drastically increasing the activity of a single FIII10 domain but not having any activity on its own (8Mardon H.J. Grant K. FEBS Lett. 1994; 340: 197-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). A number of sites within FIII9 have been proposed to be critical for its synergistic effect. The most well studied of these is the DRVPHSRN sequence or the so-called “synergy site,” the larger part of which is located on a surface loop of FIII9 lying approximately in plane with the RGD loop (3Leahy D.J. Aukhil I. Erickson H.P. Cell. 1996; 84: 155-164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar, 9Copié V. Tomita Y. Akiyama S.K. Aota S. Yamada K.M. Venable R.M. Pastor R.W. Krueger S. Torchia D.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 277: 663-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) and thus being potentially accessible for contact with the integrin dimer. Previous studies have demonstrated that integrins binding to the FIII9–10 domain pair have a common requirement for the intact RGD motif, but they display distinct preferences for individual residues within the synergy site of FIII9 or may not need this site at all. For instance, while high affinity α5β1 binding is most sensitive to substitutions for Arg1379 (10Aota S. Nomizu M. Yamada K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24756-24761Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the most critical residues for αIIbβ3 appear to be Asp1373 and Arg1374 (11Bowditch R.D. Hariharan M. Tominna E.F. Smith J.W. Yamada K.M. Getzoff E.D. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10856-10863Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas αvβ3 and α3β1are indifferent to the presence of the FIII9 domain (11Bowditch R.D. Hariharan M. Tominna E.F. Smith J.W. Yamada K.M. Getzoff E.D. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10856-10863Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Akiyama S.K. Aota S. Yamada K.M. Cell Adhes. Commun. 1995; 3: 13-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Other amino acids in the vicinity of the classical synergy site (notably Arg1369, Arg1371, Thr1385, and Asn1386) have also been shown to contribute to the synergistic activity of FIII9 (13Redick S.D. Settles D.L. Briscoe G. Erickson H.P. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 521-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), although no integrin specificity has been determined for these residues. Taken together, these findings support the notion that each distinct integrin-ligand interaction, despite exhibiting some overall topological similarities, has its idiosyncratic characteristics, which define the precise conditions for an efficient and specific binding to the synergistic FIII9–10 module pair. Biophysical studies have revealed that in comparison with FIII10, the FIII9 domain is thermodynamically rather unstable (14Spitzfaden C. Grant R.P. Mardon H.J. Campbell I.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 265: 565-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) and displays much slower folding kinetics (15Plaxco K.W. Spitzfaden C. Campbell I.D. Dobson C.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 270: 763-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Coupling to the neighboring FIII modules within fibronectin clearly plays an important role in stabilizing FIII9, since it exhibits around 3-fold higher conformational stability in module pairs FIII8–9 and FIII9–10 than on its own (16Altroff H. van der Walle C.F. Asselin J. Fairless R. Campbell I.D. Mardon H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38885-38892Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), and altering its distance from FIII10 by introducing interdomain linkers of varying length critically reduces its stability (14Spitzfaden C. Grant R.P. Mardon H.J. Campbell I.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 265: 565-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The relationship between the thermodynamic properties of FIII9 and its synergistic integrin-dependent biological activity, however, remains little studied despite its likely important implications for understanding the mechanism of integrin-ligand complex formation. A previous investigation has shown that the decrease in FIII9 stability due to the insertion of the above-mentioned linkers between FIII9 and FIII10 coincides with the reduced adhesive activity of the domain pair and impaired induction of intracellular signaling (17Grant R.P. Spitzfaden C. Altroff H. Campbell I.D. Mardon H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6159-6166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). More recently, we were able to demonstrate a link between the enhancement of biological function of the FIII9–10 pair by the FIII8 module and its positive influence on the structural stability of FIII9 (16Altroff H. van der Walle C.F. Asselin J. Fairless R. Campbell I.D. Mardon H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38885-38892Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In the latter study we also probed the role of the FIII9 synergy site in stabilizing the FIII8–9 pair within the FIII8–9–10 module tandem, documenting a negative impact of perturbing the synergy sequence in this three-domain context. Here, we have specifically addressed the question whether, and to what extent, do specific amino acid residues within the synergistic DRVPHSRN loop contribute to the global stability of FIII9 and how this relates to the functional performance of the FIII9–10 domain pair. We use a combination of biophysical, biochemical, and biological methods to show that the altered structural properties of various FIII9–10 synergy site mutants are strongly linked to their integrin α5β1-dependent function. Cloning of the wild type FIII9–10 domain pair into the pGEX2T vector (AmershamBiosciences) has been described elsewhere (8Mardon H.J. Grant K. FEBS Lett. 1994; 340: 197-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Amino acid substitutions into the wild type FIII9–10 construct were introduced following the QuikChangeTM protocol (Stratagene). The following mutations were made to the synergistic DRVPHSRN sequence of FIII9: Arg1379 to Ala (DRVPHSAN; mutant Ala1); Asp1373-Arg1374 to Ala-Ala and Ser1378-Arg1379-Asn1380 to Ala-Ala-Ala (AAVPHAAA; mutant Ala5), as highlighted in Fig. 1. Creation of mutant Ala3, containing the substitution of Ser1378-Arg1379-Asn1380 with Ala-Ala-Ala (DRVPHAAA), has been described previously (16Altroff H. van der Walle C.F. Asselin J. Fairless R.

Constructs harboring mutations in the synergy site were further mutated in FIII9 by substituting Leu1408 with Pro (mutants Ala1-L1408P, Ala3-L1408P, and Ala5-L1408P). The latter substitution was also introduced into the wild type FIII9–10 pair, resulting in mutant L1408P (see Table I). The DNA sequence of all created mutants was confirmed using Sanger DNA sequencing methodology (Department of Biochemistry, University of Oxford).Table INotations used for mutant FIII9–10 proteinsFIII9–10 mutantAlanine substitutions in the 1373DRVPHSRN1380sequence of FIII9Substitution of Leu1408 with ProAla1DRVPHSAN−Ala3DRVPHAAA−Ala5AAVPHAAA−L1408PDRVPHSRN+Ala1-L1408PDRVPHSAN+Ala3-L1408PDRVPHAAA+Ala5-L1408PAAVPHAAA+ Open table in a new tab Wild type and mutant FIII9–10 constructs were expressed in Escherichia coli as glutathione S-transferase (GST)1 fusion proteins and purified as described previously (8Mardon H.J.

For equilibrium chemical denaturation studies, cleaved FIII proteins were obtained by thrombin digest of the respective GST fusion proteins as described elsewhere (16Altroff H. van der Walle C.F. Asselin J. Fairless R. Campbell I.D. Mardon H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38885-38892Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Integrin α5β1 used in ELISA and surface plasmon resonance studies was purified from human placenta as described previously (16Altroff H. van der Walle C.F. Asselin J. Fairless R. Campbell I.D. Mardon H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38885-38892Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). ELISAs with plate-bound α5β1 and soluble FIII9–10 ligands were carried out in the presence of divalent cations as detailed earlier (16Altroff H. van der Walle C.F. Asselin J. Fairless R. Campbell I.D. Mardon H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38885-38892Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Assays were performed in duplicate, and background antibody binding in the absence of ligand was subtracted from the readings. Nonspecific binding of the GST fusion proteins to uncoated wells blocked with bovine serum albumin was measured separately for each ligand concentration point and subsequently subtracted from the corresponding values for total binding. Dose-response data from the assays were analyzed by non-linear regression using a sigmoidal curve fit (Prism, GraphPad Software). Assay results are expressed as the means of at least three independent experiments. Error bars represent S.E. (dose-response curves) or 95% confidence intervals (bar graphs). Real-time biomolecular interaction analysis was performed using a BIACORE 2000 instrument (Biacore, Uppsala, Sweden). All experiments were performed at room temperature using the standard HEPES-buffered saline as running buffer. Briefly, 9000–16,000 resonance units anti-GST antibody (Biacore) was immobilized on CM5 sensor chips (Biacore) according to the manufacturer's instructions (BIAapplications Handbook, Biacore). A volume of 30 μl of different GST-tagged FIII9–10 proteins diluted in HEPES-buffered saline were then injected at 5 μl/min to reach a constant level of binding. For kinetic measurements, integrin α5β1 was injected for 10 min at three different concentrations (80, 160, and 320 nm) at a constant flow rate of 5 μl/min. Both the association and dissociation reactions were performed in Tris-buffered saline (25 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4) containing MnCl2, MgCl2, and CaCl2at 2 mm each. The same injections of integrin were performed on a GST protein used as a reference. The sensor surfaces were regenerated with a short pulse of 10 mm glycine, pH 2.2. Data were analyzed by using the global fitting algorithm of the BIAevaluation 3.0 software package (Biacore), using a simple 1:1 kinetic model. At least two independent experiments were performed for each α5β1-FIII9–10 interaction. Error bars represent S.D. Cell attachment and spreading assays were performed with baby hamster kidney (BHK) fibroblasts as detailed elsewhere (8Mardon H.J. Grant K. FEBS Lett. 1994; 340: 197-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Cell attachment was quantified by staining adherent cells with 0.1% crystal violet as described previously (8Mardon H.J. Grant K. FEBS Lett. 1994; 340: 197-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The data obtained are expressed as the means ± S.E. of at least three independent experiments. Equilibrium unfolding experiments were carried out on recombinant GST-cleaved FIII9–10 proteins, incubated in 0–4 m guanidinium hydrochloride (GdnHCl) in phosphate-buffered saline, as described previously (16Altroff H. van der Walle C.F. Asselin J. Fairless R. Campbell I.D. Mardon H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38885-38892Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Measurements were performed at 25 °C on a Shimadzu RF5001PC spectrofluorimeter, using an excitation wavelength of 278 nm. Fluorescence emitted was recorded at wavelengths ranging from 360 to 425 nm. Data from the experiments were fitted for a two-state unfolding mechanism as described earlier (20Pace C.N. Scholtz J.M. Creighton T.E. Protein Structure, A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1997: 299-321Google Scholar). Error bars in the bar graphs represent 95% confidence intervals. To evaluate the effect of perturbing the synergy site of FIII9 on integrin α5β1 recognition, solid-phase receptor binding assays were performed with wild type FIII9–10 ligand and mutants Ala1, Ala3, and Ala5 (Fig. 2), incorporating various substitutions within the DRVPHSRN sequence (see Table I). The apparentK d of the interaction (ligand concentration at the midpoint of the dose-response curves shown in Fig. 2 a) was observed to increase gradually as more substitutions were introduced, rising from ∼2 nm for the wild type to ∼5 nm for mutants Ala1 and Ala3 and ∼15 nm for mutant Ala5 (Fig. 2 b, closed bars on theleft-hand panel). This dependence of high affinity α5β1 binding on the intact synergy site was in agreement with previous studies (16Altroff H. van der Walle C.F. Asselin J. Fairless R. Campbell I.D. Mardon H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38885-38892Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 18Mould A.P. Askari J.A. Aota S. Yamada K.M. Irie A. Takada Y. Mardon H.J. Humphries M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17283-17292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) and further demonstrated the differential and co-operative effect of individual synergistic residues in securing efficient receptor recognition. The results obtained by ELISA were confirmed using surface plasmon resonance (SPR), allowing the monitoring of real-time kinetic parameters of the ligand-integrin complex formation. The apparentK d values for the α5β1-FIII9–10 interaction calculated by this method showed a similar increase upon introduction of mutations into the synergy loop of FIII9, being lowest for native FIII9–10 (∼17 nm) and highest for mutant Ala5 (∼63 nm) (Fig. 2 b, closed bars on theright-hand panel). This difference stemmed from both the slower association (on-rate) and faster dissociation (off-rate) of the integrin from the mutated FIII9–10 mutants, as compared with the wild type (data not shown). The discrepancy between the relativeK d values from these experiments and the ELISA data (the affinity of the least active mutant versus wild type decreasing ∼4- and ∼8-fold, respectively) is likely due to the different assay formats used. SPR analysis was conducted with captured fibronectin ligands and soluble integrin, whereas immobilized integrin and soluble fibronectin fragments were used for ELISAs. Also, in SPR studies the integrin binds to the captured ligand in constant flow conditions, whereas the ELISAs are conducted in the absence of flow, which may have contributed to the variance of the relative affinities of individual FIII9–10 ligands. Nevertheless, both techniques show a clear dependence of binding affinity on the native structure of the synergy loop and further suggest that this synergy requirement is maintained regardless of the particular method of presentation of the FIII9–10 ligand to the integrin. Earlier studies in our laboratory have shown that a single Leu1408 to Pro mutation within the FIII9–10 domain pair is able to confer a significant increase in structural stability to the native FIII9 domain maintaining an intact synergy loop (19van der Walle, C. F., Altroff, H. & Mardon, H. J. (2002)Protein Eng. 15, in pressGoogle Scholar). We therefore sought to assess the functional consequences of this substitution in the context of wild type FIII9–10 as well as synergy site mutants Ala1, Ala3, and Ala5 with relatively poor integrin binding properties. ELISAs performed with the various FIII9–10 mutants and immobilized α5β1 (Fig. 2 b,open bars) revealed that mutant L1408P bound to the integrin with ∼3-fold higher affinity than the wild type (apparentK d ≈ 0.7 nm), and the same substitution in mutant Ala5-L1408P resulted in a similar ∼3-fold enhancement of function over Ala5. A modest improvement in α5β1 binding capacity was also seen with mutants Ala1-L1408P and Ala3-L1408P in comparison with mutants Ala1 and Ala3, respectively. Having determined the solid-phase integrin binding properties of the aforementioned FIII9–10 mutants, we proceeded to test the ability of these fibronectin fragments to support integrin-mediated adhesion of BHK fibroblasts, which express integrins α5β1 and αvβ3 (17Grant R.P. Spitzfaden C. Altroff H. Campbell I.D. Mardon H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6159-6166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), as a physiologically more relevant measure of biological activity (Fig. 3). Quantification of cell attachment to protein-coated surfaces (Fig. 3 a) revealed that wild type FIII9–10 and mutant Ala1 were significantly better adhesive substrates for BHK cells than mutants Ala3 and Ala5, the latter retaining only ∼50 and ∼30% of the wild type activity, respectively, at a coating concentration of 1 μm. Cell spreading, a secondary event in the process of cell adhesion, was even more sensitive to perturbations in the synergy loop; the level of cell spreading at the same coating concentration dropped to ∼70 and ∼40% of wild type FIII9–10 activity for Ala1 and Ala3, respectively, while the response for Ala5 was barely ∼10% of that of the wild type (Fig. 3 b). The FIII9–10 mutants carrying an L1408P substitution were tested in these assays to determine whether this mutation was able to recover the adhesion promoting capability lost in the FIII9–10 synergy site mutants. The adhesive properties of mutant L1408P were enhanced in comparison with the native FIII9–10 at lower coating concentrations, confirming previous findings. Cell attachment on mutants Ala3-L1408P and Ala5-L1408P was restored to wild type levels, being ∼2- and ∼4-fold more efficient compared with Ala3 and Ala5, respectively, at 1 μm coating concentration (Fig. 3 c). Attachment to Ala1-L1408P, however, was reduced in comparison with Ala1. The spreading of BHK cells was likewise affected by the L1408P substitution (Fig. 3 d). The activity of mutants Ala3-L1408P and Ala5-L1408P was significantly increased compared with Ala3 and Ala5 (∼2- and ∼8-fold, respectively, at 1 μm coating concentration). Cell spreading on mutant Ala1-L1408P remained at the same level as that supported by mutant Ala1. Previous experiments with longer fibronectin fragments spanning domains FIII8 through FIII10 had indicated a role for the FIII9 synergistic sequence in contributing to the structural stability of the FIII8–9 pair (16Altroff H. van der Walle C.F. Asselin J. Fairless R. Campbell I.D. Mardon H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38885-38892Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In this study, we explored further the correlation between the differential functional activity of FIII9–10 constructs harboring various mutations in the synergy site and their thermodynamic properties. Data from equilibrium unfolding experiments performed with FIII9–10 mutants using GdnHCl as a denaturant are presented in Fig. 4 and Table II. Global unfolding of the FIII9–10 domain pair is known to occur by a well defined two-step transition allowing for separate analysis of unfolding parameters for the individual FIII9 and FIII10 domains (14Spitzfaden C. Grant R.P. Mardon H.J. Campbell I.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 265: 565-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 16Altroff H. van der Walle C.F. Asselin J. Fairless R. Campbell I.D. Mardon H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38885-38892Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Since the stability of FIII10 does not depend significantly on the presence of FIII9 (16Altroff H. van der Walle C.F. Asselin J. Fairless R. Campbell I.D. Mardon H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38885-38892Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), only the first step of the denaturation curve, corresponding to the unfolding of FIII9 (14Spitzfaden C. Grant R.P. Mardon H.J. Campbell I.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 265: 565-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), was of interest here and is shown in isolation for clarity. The analysis used assumes a two-state domain unfolding mechanism as described by Pace and Scholtz (20Pace C.N. Scholtz J.M. Creighton T.E. Protein Structure, A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1997: 299-321Google Scholar). While FIII9 in mutant Ala1 displayed roughly the same unfolding properties as in wild type FIII9–10, the FIII9 module in mutant Ala3 was destabilised, an effect that was more pronounced for mutant Ala5 (Fig. 4 a). The concentration of denaturant leading to 50% domain unfolding ([GdnHCl]12) dropped from 1.9 m for wild type FIII9 to 1.5 m for Ala3 and to 1.2 m for Ala5 (Fig. 4 b, closed bars), and the respective negative shifts in the free energy of unfolding (ΔG (H2O)) relative to the wild type increased from −1.0 kcal mol−1 (Ala3) to −1.7 kcal mol−1 (Ala5) (Table II). These results thus demonstrate that the thermodynamic stability of FIII9 within the FIII9–10 pair is sensitive to specific amino acid substitutions within the synergy loop. When unfolding curves for FIII9 in mutants incorporating the Leu1408 to Pro substitution were assessed, a substantial shift to the right was seen for all Pro1408 mutants as compared with their Leu1408counterparts (Fig. 4 c). The corresponding increase in conformational stability of FIII9 as reflected by the respective [GdnHCl]12 and ΔG(H2O) values was ∼1.5-fold for all Pro/Leu mutant pairs (Fig. 4 b,open bars, and Table II).Table IIEquilibrium unfolding parameters for the first denaturation step of the wild type and mutant FIII9–10 domain pairsFIII9–10 construct[GdnHCl]1/2ΔG (H2O)2-aDue to potential errors associated with determining the individual slope (m) values for the linear transition region, the values of ΔG (H2O) were calculated from an average m value of 2.60 kcal mol−1m−1 (20).mmkcal mol −1kcal mol −1 m −1Wild type1.874.862.71Ala12.015.232.44Ala31.493.872.96Ala51.233.202.81L1408P2.727.071.73Ala1-L1408P3.007.802.34Ala3-L1408P2.175.642.60Ala5-L1408P1.965.103.202-a Due to potential errors associated with determining the individual slope (m) values for the linear transition region, the values of ΔG (H2O) were calculated from an average m value of 2.60 kcal mol−1m−1 (20Pace C.N.

Open table in a new tab Finally, the observed differential thermodynamic stability of the FIII9–10 mutants was compared with their functional activity by performing correlation analysis. Mutant Ala1-L1408P was excluded from linear regression calculations due to its anomalously high stability/activity ratio. The results of the analysis, plotted in Fig. 5, reveal a strong correlation between the structural stability of the FIII9–10 proteins and mean biological activity (Pearson correlation coefficient r = 0.92; p = 0.004). The current study was aimed toward elucidating the structural basis for the synergistic biological activity of FIII9 in the FIII9–10 module pair of fibronectin. By the use of a range of methods, we have established a distinct role for the DRVPHSRN synergy sequence within the FIII9 domain in maintaining the overall conformational stability of FIII9. Our findings demonstrate that: (i) perturbing the native configuration of the FIII9 synergy site, required for efficient integrin α5β1 binding and cell adhesion, leads to impaired domain stability; (ii) the Leu1408 to Pro mutation can compensate for loss of biological activity of the synergy site mutants; and (iii) a strong correlation exists between the global structural integrity and synergistic function of the FIII9–10 pair. We have used alanine scanning mutagenesis within the synergy site to establish the structural importance of residues previously reported to play a key role in integrin-dependent adhesive processes (10Aota S. Nomizu M. Yamada K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24756-24761Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Bowditch R.D. Hariharan M. Tominna E.F. Smith J.W. Yamada K.M. Getzoff E.D. Ginsberg M.H. J.

Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 521-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). In our experiments, the reduction in biological activity for a single Arg1379 mutant (Ala1) is very similar to that observed recently by Redick et al. (13Redick S.D. Settles D.L. Briscoe G. Erickson H.P. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 521-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Further loss of function upon mutating both the N- and C-terminal portions of the DRVPHSRN sequence (in Ala5) is also in good general agreement with the latter report. Further substitutions of amino acids outside the DRVPHSRN site have been shown to have an effect in combination with Arg1379 in FIII7–10 fragments (13Redick S.D. Settles D.L. Briscoe G. Erickson H.P. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 521-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), although it is not clear to what extent these substitutions affect local or global foldedness. While confirming earlier findings, we show here that the perturbations introduced in the FIII9–10 mutants not only affect the functionality of the synergy site but also have a strong negative effect on the thermodynamic stability of the FIII9 domain. Equilibrium denaturation experiments reveal that even though the synergy site resides on a solvent-exposed surface loop protruding from the main domain core, it contributes significantly to the overall foldedness of FIII9, as synergy site mutants carrying multiple substitutions unfold at much lower denaturant concentrations than the wild type. The fact that this effect is not observable for the single Arg1379mutant points to the involvement of more extensive interactions between the core and the synergy loop in conferring stability to FIII9. The structure-function correlation seen with the synergy site mutants is further reinforced by the finding that a single independent substituted residue (Pro for Leu1408) on the other side of the FIII9 module (shown in Fig. 1), conceivably unable to make a direct contact with either the synergy loop itself or the integrin receptor, essentially reverses the effect of inactivating the synergy site both in terms of biological function and structural characteristics of the FIII9–10 pair. Such indirect influence on integrin α5β1-dependent activities is therefore most likely exerted via global stabilization of the FIII9 module. In a previous report, we studied the influence of the FIII8 module within the FIII8–9–10 domain tandem upon the stability of FIII9, showing a causal link between FIII8-induced enhancement of synergistic biological activity and restoration of structural integrity of an FIII9–10 pair containing a dysfunctional synergy site (16Altroff H. van der Walle C.F. Asselin J. Fairless R. Campbell I.D. Mardon H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38885-38892Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). On the basis of these findings, we suggested that the requirement for the DRVPHSRN sequence may only be critical for integrin binding in the case of an isolated FIII9–10 pair. However, here we show that a Leu1408 to Pro substitution within FIII9–10 achieves a similar effect without the need for an additional N-terminal domain. Taken together, these two studies imply that any sufficiently strong influence producing an increase in the global stability of FIII9, be it a single critical amino acid substitution or a whole additional domain, may overcome the requirement for an intact synergy site in securing efficient integrin recognition. This kind of conformation-dependent receptor competency appears to play an important role in the regulation of adhesion-related cellular responses. The latter notion may be relevant in the light of the evidence that some integrins appear to modulate synergy site binding as a function of their activation state. For instance, α5β1 may lose its dependence on the synergy sequence in the presence of stimulatory antibodies or Mn2+ions (21Danen E.H. Aota S. van Kraats A.A. Yamada K.M. Ruiter D.J. van Muijen G.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21612-21618Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), while α4β1 and α4β7 only recognize FIII9 when constitutively activated (22Yin Z. Giacomello E. Gabriele E. Zardi L. Aota S. Yamada K.M. Skerlavaji B. Doliana R. Colombatti A. Perris R. Blood. 1999; 93: 1221-1230PubMed Google Scholar). Thus the requirement for the synergy site may to a large extent depend on the specific overall conformation of both the fibronectin ligand and the integrin receptor. Earlier studies utilizing synergy site-derived peptides in isolation (11Bowditch R.D. Hariharan M. Tominna E.F. Smith J.W. Yamada K.M. Getzoff E.D. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10856-10863Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or in the context of a foreign FIII scaffold (10Aota S. Nomizu M. Yamada K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24756-24761Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have shown that mutations in the DRVPHSRN sequence can affect integrin binding and cell adhesion even in the absence of a native FIII9 fold. This suggests that while maintaining conformational stability of FIII9 may be an important function of the synergy loop, it is likely that this is not the only mechanism whereby this region fulfils its synergistic potential and that, as proposed by a number of previous reports, direct and specific molecular interactions between residues in the synergy site and the ligand binding pocket of the receptor are also crucial for biological activity. As suggested previously (16Altroff H. van der Walle C.F. Asselin J. Fairless R. Campbell I.D. Mardon H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38885-38892Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), full uncoupling of these two mechanisms of action may not be possible, and both need to be taken into account when modeling the establishment and maintenance of fibronectin-integrin interactions. The specific stability parameters of the FIII9–10 domain pair appear to depend upon the particular conditions in which domain unfolding is evoked. For instance, while chemical denaturation unfolding experiments employed in this and other studies show that the FIII9 module is thermodynamically much less stable than FIII10, steered molecular dynamics simulations using forced mechanical stretching of the module pair predict that FIII9 may be mechanically more stable than FIII10 (23Craig D. Krammer A. Schulten K. Vogel V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5590-5595Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The apparent contradiction between the two data sets may be explained by consideration of the fact that forced unfolding is a kinetic process that queries the height of energetic barriers separating different folded states rather than the equilibrium energies measured by chemical unfolding. Given that the forced unfolding method mimicks the physiologically highly relevant stretching of the fibronectin molecule under tension and that the FIII9 domain responds differently in different unfolding scenarios, it would be interesting to investigate how the synergy site mutants employed in the current study would affect the mechanical (as opposed to thermodynamic) stability of FIII9 and which specific intradomain interactions are most vulnerable to disruption by stretching. In conclusion, this report provides strong evidence in support of the hypothesis that domain stability is an important determinant of integrin α5β1-dependent synergistic biological potential of the FIII9 module. Our observation that relatively minor amino acid substitutions produce unexpectedly large effects in the thermodynamic stability of FIII9 thus highlights the requirement for careful structural evaluation of modular proteins participating in similar receptor-ligand interactions.

Voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels are fundamental components of the presynaptic release machinery whereby glutamate release and hence synaptic strength can be modulated (20Hille B. Trends Neurosci. 1994; 17: 531-535Google Scholar). Indeed, a number of electrophysiological studies have shown that the release of glutamate depends primarily on the activity of P/Q- and N-type Ca2+ channels (21Luebke J.I. Dunlap K. Turner T. Neuron. 1993; 11: 895-902Google Scholar, 22Mintz I.M. Sabatini B.L. Regehr W.G. Neuron. 1995; 15: 675-688Google Scholar, 23Wheeler D.B. Randall A. Tsien R.W. J.

Neurosci. 2001; 21: 3721-3728Google Scholar). These same electrophysiological studies have suggested that Ca2+ channels exhibit a heterogeneous distribution in glutamatergic nerve terminals, which may express N- or P/Q-type calcium channels or a combination of both. Because the Ca2+ channel profile may confer specific release properties to glutamatergic nerve terminals, it is possible that the distinct group III mGluRs are also restricted to subpopulations of nerve terminals depending upon the type or combination of Ca2+ channels present. However, due to the small size of the synaptic boutons and because synaptic transmission studies provide average measures of the release from a large number of nerve terminals, the precise distribution of Ca2+ channels in single nerve terminals remains largely unknown. It also remains to be established whether presynaptic mGluRs are expressed in terminals endowed with a particular subtype of Ca2+ channels. In this study, by imaging Ca2+ in single nerve terminals, we have established the distribution of Ca2+ channels and group III mGluRs. In the cerebrocortical preparation of nerve terminals from young rats, two mGluRs exhibiting high and low affinity forl(+)-2-amino-4-phosphonobutyrate (l-AP4) and immunocytochemically identified as mGluR4 and mGluR7, respectively, reduced the entry of Ca2+ and the release of glutamate in a different subpopulation of terminals. Interestingly, we found that mGluR4 was primarily located in terminals that coexpress N- and P/Q-type Ca2+ channels, whereas mGluR7 was preferentially expressed with N-type Ca2+ channels. This distinct distribution of Ca2+ channel types in mGluR4- and mGluR7-expressing nerve terminals may account for the terminal-specific modulation of glutamate release through group III mGluRs. These data demonstrate for the first time the selective distribution of two group III mGluRs in a different population of Ca2+channel-containing nerve terminals. Synaptosomes were purified on discontinuous Percoll gradients (Amersham Biosciences, Uppsala, Sweden) as previously described (26Dunkley P.R. Jarvie P.E. Heath J.W. Kidd G.J.E. Rostas J.A.P. Brain Res. 1986; 372: 115-129Google Scholar, 27Wang J.K.T. Walaas S.I. Sihra T.S. Aderem A. Greengard P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 2253-2256Google Scholar). Briefly, cerebral cortices were isolated from young male Wistar rats (3 weeks old) and homogenized in medium containing 0.32 m sucrose (pH 7.4). The homogenate was centrifuged at 2000 × g for 2 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was spun again at 9500 × g for 12 min. From the pellets formed, the white loosely compacted layer containing the majority of the synaptosomes was gently resuspended in 8 ml of 0.32 sucrose (pH 7.4). Of this synaptosomal suspension, 2 ml was placed onto a 3-ml Percoll discontinuous gradient containing 0.32 msucrose; 1 mm EDTA; 0.25 mm dl-dithiothreitol; and 3, 10, or 23% Percoll (pH 7.4). After centrifugation at 25,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, the synaptosomes were recovered from between the 10 and 23% Percoll bands and diluted in a final volume of 30 ml of HEPES buffer medium (HBM) containing 140 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 5 mm NaHCO3, 1.2 mmNaH2PO4, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm glucose, and 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4). Following centrifugation at 22,000 × g for 10 min, the synaptosomes were resuspended in 8 ml of HBM, and the protein content was determined by the biuret method. Finally, 1 mg of the synaptosomal suspension was diluted in 8 ml of HBM and spun at 3000 ×g for 10 min. The supernatant was discarded, and the pellets containing the synaptosomes were stored on ice. Under these conditions, the synaptosomes remained fully viable for at least 4–6 h as judged by the extent of KCl- and 4-aminopyridine-induced glutamate release. Glutamate release was assayed by on-line fluorometry as described previously (28Nicholls D.G. Sihra T.S. Sánchez-Prieto J. J. Neurochem. 1987; 49: 50-57Google Scholar). Synaptosomal pellets were resuspended in HBM (0.67 mg/ml) and preincubated at 37 °C for 1 h in the presence of 16 μm bovine serum albumin to bind any free fatty acids released from synaptosomes during the preincubation. A 1-ml aliquot was transferred to a stirred cuvette containing 1 mm NADP+, 50 units of glutamate dehydrogenase (Sigma), and 1.33 mm CaCl2 or 200 nm free Ca2+, and the fluorescence of NADPH was followed in a PerkinElmer Life Sciences LS-50 luminescence spectrometer at excitation and emission wavelengths of 340 and 460 nm, respectively. Traces were calibrated by addition of 2 nmol of glutamate at the end of each assay. Data points were obtained at 2-s intervals and corrected for Ca2+-independent release. Thus, the Ca2+-dependent release was calculated by subtracting the release obtained during a 5-min period of depolarization at 200 nm free Ca2+ from the release at 1.33 mm CaCl2. Synaptosomes in HBM (2 mg/ml) with 16 μm bovine serum albumin were preincubated with 5 μm fura-2/AM and 1.33 mm CaCl2for 40 min. The synaptosomal suspension was attached to a polylysine-coated coverslip for 1 h. A superfusion chamber was carved in small Petri dish, which was mounted on a Nikon inverted stage microscope. The medium was fed into the chamber by gravity at 1–1.5 ml/min from a prewarmed (37 °C) reservoir and continuously removed by aspiration. Synaptosomes were illuminated alternately at 340 and 380 nm for 0.8 s through a ×100 objective with the aid of a monochromator (Kinetic Imaging, Ltd.), and the fluorescence emitted from the nerve terminals was collected through a band-pass filter centered at 510 nm. The video images were obtained using a slow-scan CCD camera (Hamamatsu C4880) operating at 12-bit digitalization (4096 levels), and the output from the camera was stored by a computerized imaging system (Kinetic Imaging, Ltd.). Individual synaptosomes were visualized as bright round spots in fluorescence images. Background at F 340 nm andF 380 nm was substracted from each series ofF 340 nm and F 380 nmimages. A binary mask constructed by local equalization and thresholding of row images was applied to isolate round measuring areas, zeroing pixels outside of the bright spots. Using this, some synaptosomes were not analyzed, but never >5–10%. Ratio images were stored as 32-bit floating point number data. The cytosolic free [Ca2+] was derived from theF 340 nm/F 380 nm ratio with the equation derived by Grynkiewicz et al. (29Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Google Scholar) using Lucida Version 3.0 (Kinetic Imaging, Ltd.).R max, R min, and β parameters were determined from in vitro calibration by recording fluorescence from small droplets of fura-2 free acid (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) dissolved in intracellular solution containing 100 mm KCl, 10 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm MOPS, and 10 μm fura-2 (pH 7.0) plus 2 mmCaCl2 (saturated Ca2+) or 2 mm EGTA (0 Ca2+). For cytosolic free [Ca2+] measurements, synaptosomes were stimulated by 10-s pulses (indicated in each graph by a bar) of 30 mm KCl in the absence and presence of pharmacological agonists or antagonists. Drugs were applied to the nerve terminals by switching the perfusion solution. The affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal antibody against mGluR7a and the affinity-purified guinea pig polyclonal antibodies against mGluR4a and mGluR8a used here have been described elsewhere (6Shigemoto R. Kinoshita A. Wada E. Nomura S. Ohishi H. Takada M. Flor P.J. Neki A. Abe T. Nakanishi S. Mizuno N. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 7503-7522Google Scholar). The monoclonal anti-synaptophysin antibody was obtained from Sigma. The rabbit polyclonal antibodies against the vesicular glutamate transporters VGLUT1 and VGLUT2 were obtained from Synaptic Systems (Göttingen, Germany). The rabbit polyclonal anti-glutamate decarboxylase (GAD-65) antiserum were purchased from Chemicon International, Inc. (Temecula, CA). To control the immunochemical reaction, primary antibodies were omitted from the staining procedure, whereupon no immunoreactivity resembling that obtained using the specific antibodies could be detected. The synaptosomes were allowed to attach to a polylysine-coated coverslip for 1 h and then fixed for 5 min in 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m phosphate buffer (pH 7.4). Following several washes with 0.1 m phosphate buffer (pH 7.4), the synaptosomes were preincubated in 10% normal goat serum diluted in Tris-buffered saline (TBS; 50 mm Tris buffer (pH 7.4) containing 0.9% NaCl) with 0.2% Triton X-100 for 1 h. They were then incubated for 24 h with the appropriate primary antiserum diluted in TBS with 1% normal goat serum and 0.2% Triton X-100: mGluR7a (1 μg/ml), mGluR4a (1 μg/ml), mGluR8a (1 μg/ml), VGLUT1 (1:1000), VGLUT2 (1:1000), GAD-65 (1:1000), and synaptophysin (1:1000). After washing with TBS, the synaptosomes were incubated for 2 h with Cy2-coupled goat anti-rabbit or anti-mouse antibody or fluorescein-coupled donkey anti-guinea pig antibody. The secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc., West Grove, PA) were diluted 1:200 in TBS. After several washes with TBS, the coverslips were mounted with Fluoromount (Serva), and the synaptosomes were viewed with a Nikon Diaphot microscope equipped with a ×100 objective, a mercury lamp light source, and fluorescein-rhodamine Nikon filter sets. ω-Conotoxin GVIA (ω-CgTx) and ω-agatoxin IVA (ω-AgaTx) were supplied by Peptide Institute, Inc. (Osaka, Japan). l-AP4 was from Tocris Cookson (Bristol, UK). Fura-2/AM was from Molecular Probes, Inc. NADP+ and all other reagents were from Sigma. The depolarization elicited with 30 mm KCl in cerebrocortical nerve terminals from young rats (3 weeks old) induced a Ca2+-dependent release of 1.58 ± 0.02 nmol of glutamate/mg ± S.E. (n = 10). This release was reduced by 22.2 ± 1.4% (n = 8) by the group III mGluR agonist l-AP4 at 20 μmand by 46.3 ± 1.3% (n = 8) when the agonist concentration was increased to 1 mm (Fig.1 A). The inhibition of glutamate release by l-AP4 followed a biphasic dose-response curve, with EC50 values of 1.37 and 371 μm, respectively. These data suggest that at least two mGluRs are involved in the inhibition of glutamate release in this preparation, one with a high and the second with a low affinity forl-AP4 (Fig. 1 B). Because group III mGluR-mediated inhibition of induced glutamate release is the consequence of a reduction in Ca2+ channel activity (8Trombley P.Q. Westbrook G.L. J. Neurosci. 1992; 12: 2043-2050Google Scholar, 10Herrero I. Vázquez E. Miras-Portugal M.T. Sánchez-Prieto J. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1996; 8: 700-709Google Scholar, 17Takahashi T. Forsythe I.D.

Chem. 2002; 277: 14092-14101Google Scholar), Ca2+ imaging experiments were performed to determine which subpopulation of nerve terminals expresses these receptors. Immobilized fura-2-loaded nerve terminals were used to determine the impact of activating group III mGluRs with respect to calcium influx induced by depolarization at the level of a single nerve terminal. A total of 2180 fura-2-loaded nerve terminals that responded to KCl were analyzed from five separate fields similar to that shown in Fig. 2 A. Although the basal cytosolic free [Ca2+] was 78.1 ± 3.0 nm(n = 60), the responses to 10 s of depolarization with 30 mm KCl were transient, ranging from 500 to 800 nm. Nerve terminals expressing mGluRs with high and low affinity for l-AP4 were distinguished by their responses to applications of 20 μm and then 1 mm l-AP4 in the presence of 30 mm KCl. A subpopulation of nerve terminals (24.4 ± 1.2%) responded to 20 μm l-AP4 with a strong reduction of the Ca2+ response (Fig. 2 B), whereas another subpopulation (30.3 ± 1.7%) responded only to the application of 1 mm l-AP4 (Fig. 2 C). The viability of the preparation was assessed by further addition of 30 mm KCl, which elicited a Ca2+ response comparable to that produced by the first depolarization in the absence of l-AP4. In addition, in 45.3 ± 1.0% of the fura-2-loaded particles, l-AP4 did not alter the Ca2+ responses (Fig. 2 D), indicating that this subpopulation of nerve terminals does not express functionall-AP4-sensitive mGluRs. Immunocytochemical staining was performed to identify the mGluR that might mediate the responses to l-AP4. Among thel-AP4-sensitive receptors (mGluR4 and mGluR6–8), mGluR6 is not expressed in the brain (11Nakajima Y. Iwakabe H. Azawa C. Nawa H. Shigemoto R. Mizuno N. Nakanishi S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11868-11873Google Scholar). Thus, only the distribution of mGluR4, mGluR7, and mGluR8 and that of the vesicular protein synaptophysin was examined by immunocytochemistry. In these experiments, a lower concentration of nerve terminals was attached to the polylysine-coated coverslips to facilitate visualization. Among the synaptophysin-containing particles (589 particles from seven fields), mGluR7 was detected in 29.5 ± 3.4% (mean ± S.E.) of the terminals (Fig. 3, A–C). The mGluR4 protein was detected in 25.2 ± 2.8% of the synaptophysin-containing particles (734 particles from seven fields) (Fig. 3, D–F). In agreement with previous reports of the restricted expression of mGluR8 in the cerebral cortex (30Kinoshita A. Ohishi H. Neki A. Nomura S. Shigemoto R. Takada M. Nakanishi S. Mizuno N. Neurosci. Lett. 1996; 207: 61-64Google Scholar), mGluR8 was found only in a small subpopulation (1.9 ± 0.6%) of synaptophysin-containing nerve terminals (1578 particles from 11 fields) (Fig. 3, G–I). The mGluR4 and mGluR7 subtypes have been shown to exhibit high (12Tanabe Y. Nomura A. Masu M. Shigemoto R. Mizuno N. Nakanishi S. J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 1372-1378Google Scholar) and low (13Okamoto N. Hori S. Akazawa C. Hayashi Y. Shigemoto R. Mizuno N. Nakanishi S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1231-1236Google Scholar) affinity forl-AP4, respectively, in modulating G protein-coupled effectors. Thus, it is likely that these two mGluRs mediate the majority of the responses to l-AP4 in cerebrocortical nerve terminals from young rats. The finding that 20 μm l-AP4 inhibited the release of glutamate by 22.2 ± 1.4% and the Ca2+response in 24.4 ± 1.2% of the nerve terminal population strongly suggests that most of the nerve terminals that respond to low concentrations of l-AP4 are glutamatergic. A similar conclusion was reached when considering the mGluR with low affinity forl-AP4 because at 1 mm, this agonist reduced the release of glutamate by 24.1 ± 1.3% and the Ca2+response in 30.3 ± 1.7% of the nerve terminals. To further study this possibility, synaptosomes were labeled with antiserum against the vesicular protein synaptophysin, and glutamatergic nerve terminals were identified with antisera against the vesicular glutamate transporters VGLUT1 (31Takamori S. Rhee J.S. Rosenmund C. Jahn R. Nature. 2000; 497: 189-194Google Scholar, 32Bellocchio E.E. Reimer R.J. Fremeau Jr., R.T. Edwards R.H. Science. 2000; 289: 957-960Google Scholar) and VGLUT2 (33Fremeau Jr., R.T. Troyer M.D. Pahner I. Nygaard G.O. Tran C.H. Reimer R.J. Bellocchio E.E. Fortin D. Storm-Mathisen J. Edwards R.H. Neuron. 2001; 31: 247-260Google Scholar, 34Takamori S. Rhee J.S. Rosenmund C. Jahn R. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21 (1–6): RC182Google Scholar). To identify GABAergic nerve terminals, co-labeling was performed with synaptophysin and antiserum against the GABA-synthesizing enzyme glutamate decarboxylase, GAD-65 (35Kaufman D.L. Houser C.R. Tobin A.J. J. Neurochem. 1991; 56: 720-723Google Scholar). VGLUT1 was detected in 62.0 ± 3.3% (mean ± S.E.) of the synaptophysin-containing particles (625 particles from 11 fields) (Fig. 4, A–C). VGLUT2 was present in 16.6 ± 2.2% of the synaptophysin-expressing particles analyzed (319 particles from seven fields) (Fig. 4, D–F). GAD-65 was detected in 23.0 ± 2.8% of a total of 304 particles from six fields (Fig. 4, G–I). Because nerve terminals coexpressing both VGLUT1 and VGLUT2 have not been found (36Herzog E. Bellenchi G.C. Gras C. Bernard V. Ravassard P. Bedet C. Gasnier B. Giros B. El Mestikawy S. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21 (1–6): RC181Google Scholar), we concluded that ∼80% of the nerve terminals in the synaptosomal preparation were glutamatergic. These data are consistent with the quantitative distribution of glutamatergic and GABAergic synapses in the rodent cerebral cortex (37Somogyi P. Tamás G. Luján R. Buhl E.H. Brain Res. Rev. 1998; 26: 113-135Google Scholar). Although our Ca2+ imaging and glutamate release data suggest that most of the nerve terminals in which l-AP4 alters the Ca2+ responses are glutamatergic, It also seems likely that a proportion of nerve terminals that respond to l-AP4 are GABAergic (38Luján R. Shigemoto R. Somogyi P. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1998; 10 (Abstr. 54.16)Google Scholar, 39Corti C. Aldegheri L. Somogyi P. Ferraguti F. Neuroscience. 2002; 110: 403-420Google Scholar). In a number of studies of synaptic transmission in which Ca2+ channel blockers have been employed, the non-uniform distribution of the Ca2+ channels appears to be associated with glutamate release (21Luebke J.I. Dunlap K. Turner T. Neuron. 1993; 11: 895-902Google Scholar, 22Mintz I.M. Sabatini B.L. Regehr W.G. Neuron. 1995; 15: 675-688Google Scholar, 23Wheeler D.B. Randall A. Tsien R.W. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 2226-2237Google Scholar, 24Reid C.A. Clements J.D. Bekkers J.M. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 2738-2745Google Scholar, 25Qian J. Noebels J.L. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 3721-3728Google Scholar). However, only one study has addressed the heterogeneous distribution of Ca2+ channels at the level of single presynaptic terminals from rat hippocampal cells in culture (40Reuter H. Neuron. 1995; 14: 773-779Google Scholar). Because Ca2+channels are key elements of the release machinery, and subpopulations of nerve terminals with different release properties express group III mGluRs (2Scanziani M. Gahwiler B. Charpak S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12004-12009Google Scholar), it is likely that different subtypes of group III mGluRs might be located in nerve terminals that contain different Ca2+ channels. To study this possibility, we first performed Ca2+ imaging experiments to determine which types of Ca2+ channels are expressed in the nerve terminals. Fixed fura-2-loaded nerve terminals were depolarized with 30 mm KCl in the absence and presence of ω-CgTx (41Olivera B.M. Gray W.R. Zeikus R. Mcintosh J.M. Varga J. River J. Santos V. Cruz L.J. Science. 1985; 230: 1338-1343Google Scholar) and ω-AgaTx (22Mintz I.M. Sabatini B.L. Regehr W.G. Neuron. 1995; 15: 675-688Google Scholar), selective inhibitors of N- and P/Q-type voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels, respectively. In total, 1644 fura-2-loaded particles from four fields were analyzed, from which four different types of responses were obtained. In a subpopulation of nerve terminals (47.5 ± 2.0%), the Ca2+ response was strongly reduced by ω-CgTx (2 μm), but not by ω-AgaTx (200 nm) (Fig.5 A), indicating the presence of N-type Ca2+ channels alone. In a second subpopulation (42.6 ± 1.1%), inhibition was observed following exposure to both toxins (Fig. 5 B). In this population, although either toxin alone reduced the Ca2+ significantly, a stronger reduction was observed when the two toxins were applied together, clear evidence for the coexistence of N- and P/Q-type Ca2+channels in these terminals. A small subpopulation of nerve terminals (3.9 ± 2.0%) expressed only P/Q-type Ca2+ channels as indicated by the ability of ω-AgaTx to reduce the Ca2+response (Fig. 5 C). Finally, in 6.1 ± 2.5% of the nerve terminals, the Ca2+ response was resistant to both toxins (Fig. 5 D). In another set of experiments in which 1526 fura-2-loaded particles from three fields were analyzed, we established that cerebrocortical nerve terminals were largely insensitive (95.5 ± 0.6%) to the L-type channel blocker nifedipine (10 μm) (Fig.6 A). In the remaining 4.5 ± 0.6% of the nerve terminals, the Ca2+ response was inhibited by blocking these channels (Fig. 6 B). However, the KCl-induced Ca2+ response was completely abolished by the nonspecific Ca2+ channel blocker Cd2+ (30 μm) in all nerve terminals (Fig. 6, A andB). We next set out to determine whether mGluRs with different affinities for l-AP4 are preferentially distributed in any of these subpopulations of nerve terminals or whether they are randomly distributed. To this end, nerve terminals were stimulated with 30 mm KCl in the presence of 20 μm l-AP4, 1 mm l-AP4, 2 μm ω-CgTx, or 200 nmω-AgaTx. In these experiments, 3074 fura-2-loaded particles from six fields were analyzed. mGluRs with low affinity for l-AP4 were found largely (69.9 ± 1.5%) in N-type Ca2+channel-expressing nerve terminals (Fig.7 A) and to a lesser extent (30.1 ± 1.5%) in nerve terminals endowed with N- and P/Q-type Ca2+ channels (Fig. 7 B). Co-localization of mGluRs with low affinity for l-AP4 and P/Q-type Ca2+ channels was very rarely observed (2 out of 3074 particles) (data not shown). In contrast, mGluRs sensitive to 20 μm l-AP4 were primarily expressed (73.7 ± 1.4%) in nerve terminals exhibiting both N- and P/Q-type calcium channels (Fig. 8 A). In these terminals, l-AP4 reduced the Ca2+ response further than exposure to either of the toxins alone, indicating that the mGluR inhibited both types of Ca2+ channels. In the remaining terminals sensitive to 20 μm l-AP4 (26.3 ± 1.4%), only N-type Ca2+ channels were found (Fig. 8 B). We did not detect any response to 20 μm l-AP4 in P/Q-type Ca2+channel-containing nerve terminals.Figure 8Inhibition of the KCl-induced Ca2+ responses by low concentrations of l-AP4 and Ca2+ channel toxins. Ca2+ responses were determined in the presence of 20 μm or 1 mm l-AP4, 200 nm ω-AgaTx (ω-Aga-IVA), or 2 μm ω-CgTx (ω-CgT-GVIA). Control Ca2+ responses were induced by 30 mm KCl in the absence of toxins at the end of the experiment.

Previously, we demonstrated that Y1424A is important for CFTR endocytosis (Prince, L. S., Peter, K., Hatton, S. R., Zaliauskiene, L., Cotlin, L. F., Clancy, J. P., Marchase, R. B., and Collawn, J. F.

Here we show that a second substitution in the carboxyl-terminal tail of CFTR, I1427A, on Y1424A background more than doubles CFTR surface expression as monitored by surface biotinylation. Internalization assays indicate that enhanced surface expression of Y1424A,I1427A CFTR is caused by a 76% inhibition of endocytosis. Patch clamp recording of chloride channel activity revealed that there was a corresponding increase in chloride channel activity of Y1424A,I1427A CFTR, consistent with the elevated surface expression, and no change in CFTR channel properties. Y14124A showed an intermediate phenotype compared with the double mutation, both in terms of surface expression and chloride channel activity. Metabolic pulse-chase experiments demonstrated that the two mutations did not affect maturation efficiency or protein half-life. Taken together, our data show that there is an internalization signal in the COOH terminus of CFTR that consists of Tyr1424-X-X-Ile1427where both the tyrosine and the isoleucine are essential residues. This signal regulates CFTR surface expression but not CFTR biogenesis, degradation, or chloride channel function. The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is a chloride channel that undergoes endocytosis through clathrin-coated pits.

Previous studies have demonstrated that CFTR is internalized from the cell surface (1Prince L.S. Workman Jr., R.B. Marchase R.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Schatz P.J. Guggino W.B. Li M. FEBS Lett. 1998; 427: 103-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 6Short D.B. Trotter K.W. Reczek D. Kreda S.M. Bretscher A. Boucher R.C. Stutts M.J.

Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10972-10977Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). How these interactions affect cell surface expression is not clear, but they imply that CFTR may exist in at least two cell surface pools, one tethered to the actin cytoskeleton and one associated with the endocytic pathway. Subcellular localization studies reveal that CFTR is found in the endosomes in epithelial cells (9Webster P. Vanacore L. Nairn A.C. Marino C.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: C340-C348Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), supporting the view that CFTR enters the endocytic pathway. Whether CFTR is constitutively recycled is not known. In previous studies, our laboratory demonstrated that a key feature of CFTR endocytosis was the presence of a tyrosine residue at position 1424 in the COOH-terminal tail of CFTR. Because tyrosine-based signals have been proposed to consist of the motif YXXΦ where Φ is a large hydrophobic residue and X is any residue (10Trowbridge I.S. Collawn J.F. Hopkins C.R. Ann. Rev. Cell Biol. 1993; 9: 129-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (701) Google Scholar), we tested the hypotheses that the isoleucine residue at position 1427 is important for CFTR endocytosis and that ablation of this putative signal YXXI would increase the steady-state surface expression of CFTR. To this end, we performed an integrated series of biochemical and electrophysiological assays designed to study maturation efficiency, trafficking, and Cl− channel function of the wild-type and two COOH-terminal mutant CFTR proteins. We find that the substitution of Tyr1424 and Ile1427 with alanine residues resulted in a 2-fold increase in surface expression, whereas the single Y1424A mutation shows an intermediate phenotype. CFTR internalization assays revealed that the elevated surface expression was attributed to a dramatic decrease in endocytosis, suggesting that these residues are necessary for CFTR internalization. Because the chloride channel activity and relative surface expression of Y1424A and I1427A CFTR are elevated to a similar extent, we propose that these substitutions affect protein trafficking but not CFTR chloride channel function. To our knowledge, this is the first CFTR mutant that has enhanced rather than diminished activity at the cell surface because of attenuation of internalization. CFTR (wild-type) was provided by the Gregory James Cystic Fibrosis Center Vector Core and Dr. Jeong Hong. The construction of the Y1424A mutant was described previously (3Prince L.S. Peter K.

For construction of the Y1424A,I1427A mutant, aBstXI-SgrAI fragment that coded for the COOH-terminal tail region of Y1424A CFTR was subcloned into pSK-Bluescript (Stratagene). A second-site mutation was prepared from the corresponding pSK-Bluescript vector containing theBstXI-SgrAI fragment from single-stranded DNA as described previously (11Collawn J.F. Stangel M.

The mutations were verified by dideoxynucleotide sequencing (13Tabor S. Richardson C.C. Biochemistry. 1987; 84: 4767-4771Google Scholar) using the Sequenase kit (U. S.

The cells were incubated at 37 °C in a humidified incubator for 24–48 h before analysis. One 100-mm dish of transfected COS-7 cells was used 48 h post-transfection. CFTR was immunoprecipitated using a polyclonal antibody to nucleotide binding domain 1 (a generous gift from Dr. David Bedwell at the University of Alabama at Birmingham) and phosphorylated with [γ32P]ATP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and cAMP-dependent protein kinase (Promega). Labeled CFTR was analyzed by SDS-PAGE, autoradiography, and phosphorimaging analysis as described previously (3Prince L.S. Peter K. Hatton S.R. Zaliauskiene L. Cotlin L.F. Clancy J.P. Marchase R.B.

Cell-surface biotinylation of glycoproteins and detection of CFTR were performed as described previously (1Prince L.S. Workman Jr., R.B. Marchase R.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

After biotinylation and lysis, samples were divided into two equal samples and immunoprecipitated with anti-CFTR nucleotide binding domain 1 antibody and protein A-agarose. One of the immunoprecipitated samples was then eluted from the beads using Laemmli sample buffer (without bromphenol blue), diluted in RIPA buffer (150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0) 10-fold, and the biotinylated fraction was captured with avidin-Sepharose beads (Pierce). Both total CFTR and biotinylated CFTR were then in vitro phosphorylated using [γ32P]ATP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and cAMP-dependent protein kinase (Promega) as described previously (3Prince L.S.

One day post-transfection, COS-7 cells (one 35-mm dish/time point) were rinsed three times and incubated in methionine-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 1 h and then pulsed in the same media containing 200 μCi/ml trans-[35S]methionine (ICN Biomedicals). Pulse-labeled cells were chased for 0, 4, 14, 18, or 24 h in complete media. At each time point, the cells were placed on ice and rinsed with cold phosphate-buffered saline, lysed in RIPA buffer, and incubated for an additional 30 min on ice. CFTR was immunoprecipitated from the post-nuclear supernatants and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography (PhosphorImager, AmershamBiosciences). Calculation of the protein half-lives was performed as described by Straley et al. (1998) (14Straley K.S. Daugherty B.L. Aeder S.E. Hockenson A.L. Kim K. Green S.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 1683-1694Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Individual dishes of transfected COS-7 cells were used in electrophysiological recordings as described previously (15Moyer B.D. Loffing J. Schwiebert E.M. Loffing-Cueni D. Halpin P.A. Karlson K.H. Ismailov I.I. Guggino W.B. Langford G.M. Stanton B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21759-21768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). One modification is that PClamp 8.0 software was used in this study. COS-7 cells were transiently transfected with each of the CFTR constructs along with pGL-1 (pGreen Lantern-1, a green fluorescence protein (GFP) plasmid). Under these conditions, >90% GFP and CFTR co-transfectants respond to cyclic AMP mixture (250 μm 8-Br-cAMP and chlorophenyl thio-cAMP plus 2 μm forskolin) treatment with an increase in whole cell Cl− conductance. Background levels of cyclic AMP-activated Cl− conductance were monitored in non-transfected cells in the same dish that lack GFP fluorescence, in mock-transfected cells, and in parental cells. In these whole-cell recordings, the bath (extracellular) solution contained 145 mm Tris-Cl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm glucose, 60 mm sucrose, and 5 mmHEPES, pH 7.45. The pipette (intracellular) solution contained 145 mm Tris-Cl, 5 mm HEPES, 100 nmCaCl2 and MgCl2 (chelated with 2 mmEGTA), and 5 mm Mg2+-ATP, pH 7.45. These solutions were designed to study the only current flowing through Cl− channels because Cl− is the only permeant ion in solution, to clamp intracellular Ca2+ at ∼100 nm, and to prevent swelling-activated Cl−currents with added sucrose in the bath solution. Assays of single channel recordings were obtained from membrane patches in both the cell-attached and inside-out configurations. Recording pipettes were constructed from borosilicate glass capillaries (Warner Instrument Corporation, Hamden, CT) using a Narishige PC-10 microelectrode puller (Narishige Scientific Instrument Laboratory, Tokyo, Japan) and were fire-polished with a Narishige microcentrifuge. The pipettes were partially filled with standard pipette solution and had tip resistances of 5–10 megohms. Experiments were performed at room temperature (20–22 °C). Currents were recorded at 50–60 mV (negative to pipette potential) using an Axopatch 200B patch clamp amplifier (Axon Instruments, Union City, CA) low pass-filtered at 1000 Hz (LPF-8, Warner Instruments), sampled every 100 μs with a Digidata 1321A interface (Axon Instruments), and stored onto the computer hard disk using PClamp 8 software (Axon Instruments). A brief protocol of stepping the holding potential from −100 to +100 mV and back to −100 mV served to inactivate a contaminating voltage-dependent Cl− channel (probably ClC-2) that was hyperpolarization-activated but inactivated permanently by a +100-mV pulse. The pipette solution contained (in mmol/liter): 150 NaCl, 1 MgCl2, 1 CaCl2, 5 HEPES, pH 7.4. The bath solution contained (in mmol/liter): 150 NaCl, 1 MgCl2, 5 EGTA, 5 HEPES, pH 7.4. Internalization assays were performed as described previously (3Prince L.S. Peter K. Hatton S.R. Zaliauskiene L. Cotlin L.F. Clancy J.P. Marchase R.B. Collawn J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3602-3609Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) that included the modifications of the surface biotinylation assay described above. Our hypothesis in these experiments is that if both tyrosine 1424 and isoleucine 1427 are important for CFTR internalization, complete disruption of these residues should increase CFTR surface expression. Because little is known concerning the nature of CFTR endocytosis and recycling or how these processes affect CFTR function, we constructed a double substitution COOH-terminal mutant in which both tyrosine 1424 and the isoleucine 1427 were changed to alanine. First, we determined the effects of these substitutions on CFTR surface expression by comparing the percentage of wild-type and mutant CFTR at the cell surface using a surface biotinylation assay. COS-7 cells expressing wild-type, Y1424A, and Y1424A,I1427A CFTR were surface-biotinylated and lysed in RIPA buffer (see “Materials and Methods”). Total CFTR was measured following immunoprecipitation from 50% of the lysate detected by in vitro phosphorylation ([γ-32P]ATP and protein kinase A) and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography (Fig. 1,top panel, total CFTR). CFTR was also immunoprecipitated from the other half of the lysate. This fraction was then eluted from the protein-A beads, reprecipitated using monomeric avidin-Sepharose (to separate biotinylated CFTR), and detected as described above for the total CFTR (Fig. 1, top panel). The percentage CFTR at the cell surface was markedly increased for Y1424A,I1427A CFTR compared with both wild-type (108% increase, n = 10,p < 0.001) and Y1424A CFTR (59% increase,n = 10, p < 0.001) (Fig. 1,bottom panel). The surface biotinylation data indicated that modification of residues Tyr1424 and Ile1427increased the steady-state surface expression of CFTR. The potential mechanisms that could account for these differences include changes in 1) maturation efficiency, 2) protein half-life, or 3) internalization and/or recycling rates. To test the effects of these mutations on maturation efficiency and protein half-life, we performed metabolic pulse-chase experiments on COS-7 cells expressing wild-type, Y1424A, and Y1424A,I1427A CFTR. CFTR half-lives were measured 24 h post-transfection. The results in Fig. 2 show that the half-lives for wild-type (Wt), Y1424A, and Y1424A,I1427A CFTR were 10.3 ± 2.3, 11.3 ± 2.6, and 11.3 ± 1.5 h (mean ± S.D.). This finding indicated that the elevated surface expression of the mutants was not attributed to enhanced protein half-life. In the same series of experiments, we also compared the amount of immaturely glycosylated CFTR (Band B) at 0 time with the amount of maturely glycosylated CFTR (Band C) at 4 h (top panel). The average maturation efficiency for wild-type (Wt), Y1424A, and Y1424A,I1427A CFTR were 32, 31, and 31%, respectively (bottom right panel). This finding demonstrated that elevated surface expression of Y1424A,I1427A CFTR was not because of alterations in maturation efficiency. To test whether elevated surface expression was attributed to alterations in the internalization rate of CFTR, we performed internalization assays on COS-7 cells expressing wild-type, Y1424A, and Y1424A,I1427A CFTR. Using a warm-up period between periodate and the biotin LC-hydrazide treatments (0 or 2.5 min), we monitored the loss of the surface pool of CFTR (see “Materials and Methods”). During this warm-up period, previously oxidized carbohydrate residues are internalized and therefore do not react with the membrane-impermeant biotin LC hydrazide (1Prince L.S. Workman Jr., R.B. Marchase R.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5192-5196Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). A representative internalization assay for each of the constructs is shown in Fig.3, top panel. A summary of eight assays is shown in the lower panel. For wild-type CFTR, 34% of the surface pool was internalized in 2.5 min. For Y1424A and Y1424A,I1427A CFTR, internalization dropped to 21 and 8%, respectively, during the same time period. These results demonstrate that CFTR endocytosis is inhibited by 76% when these two residues are modified. Because the biochemical data suggested that a specific motif in the CFTR COOH terminus dramatically affected endocytosis and because point mutations in the NH2 terminus lead to both disruption of binding to docking machinery and changes in CFTR ion channel function, we tested whether the mutation of Tyr1424and Ile1427 affected chloride channel function. Whole cell patch clamp recordings were performed to assess the total population of CFTR Cl− channels in the plasma membrane of transfected COS-7 cells. Tris-Cl-containing solutions were used in bath (extracellular) and pipette (intracellular) solutions so that Cl− was the only major permeant ionic species in the recordings. GFP was also expressed together with the CFTR-bearing vectors to detect cells that were successfully transfected prior to recording. Cells that did not express GFP served as internal controls. Three sets of transiently transfected COS-7 cells were examined in parallel with the above biotinylation experiments (TableI). In agreement with the surface biotinylation assays, CFTR whole cell Cl− currents in Y1424A CFTR and Y1424A,I1427A CFTR-transfected cells were elevated compared with wild-type CFTR-expressing cells (Table I), suggesting that the elevated Cl− channel activity was the result of the elevated surface expression of CFTR. Typical whole cell current traces after stimulation with cAMP agonist mixture for wild-type and mutant CFTR are shown in Fig.4 A. Fig. 4 B shows wild-type CFTR Cl− current-voltage relationships demonstrating insensitivity of the currents to DIDS (100 μm) and inhibition of the currents by glibenclamide (100 μm). These pharmacological properties are consistent with wild-type CFTR (16Schwiebert E.M. Morales M.M. Devidas S. Egan M.E. Guggino W.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2674-2679Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The time and voltage independence of the currents and the linear I–V relationship are also consistent with CFTR chloride channel activity. Fig. 4, C and D, show the Y1424A and Y1424A,I1427A Cl− current-voltage relationships, respectively, and indicate that although the sensitivities to DIDS and glibenclamide remain similar to wild-type (Fig. 4 B), the total current is elevated in the single and double mutants. Whereas the representative I–V plots show a variability in sensitivity to glibenclamide, inhibition with this Cl− channel-blocking drug was only partial ranging from 50 to 90% for both wild-type and mutant currents.Table ISummary of whole cell patch clamp recordings for wild-type CFTR and for CFTR mutants shows elevated activity in the mutants relative to wild typeTransient transfectioncAMP-activated chloride current1-aThree sets of transiently transfected COS-7 cells were analyzed in parallel with the protein biochemistry.

Open table in a new tab Single channel biophysical properties of wild-type, Y1424A, and Y1424A,I1427A CFTR were also assessed. Before the recording of CFTR Cl− channel properties under cAMP-stimulated conditions was undertaken, voltage steps between −100 and +100 mV were necessary to inactivate a pseudo-channel with similar Cl−conductance as CFTR. The properties of this channel were not inconsistent with ClC-2, known to be expressed in COS-7 cells (17Thiemann A. Grunder S. Pusch M. Jentsch T.J. Nature. 1992; 356: 57-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). Representative recordings of wild-type, Y1424A, and Y1424A,I1427A CFTR at 50–60 mV (negative to pipette potential) are shown in Fig.4 E. Single channel conductance for all three constructs was 7–8 picoSiemens for stretches of the recordings where a subset of the channels could be analyzed. Biophysical analysis of single channel kinetics was not possible, because each patch obtained from a positively transfected cell had at least 10 channels. We could never obtain patches with a single channel. Furthermore, a base line without channel openings was not observed. Nevertheless, the whole cell and single channel recordings together show that the difference in Cl− channel activity is attributed to elevated surface expression without a significant change in CFTR chloride channel properties among wild-type, Y1424A, and Y1424A,I1427A CFTR. The data presented here demonstrate that two key residues in the COOH-terminal tail dramatically regulate the steady-state distribution of CFTR between the cell surface and intracellular sites. This is the first demonstration of a CFTR mutant whose activity is actually enhanced relative to wild-type CFTR. We established this observation using both surface biotinylation and patch clamp measurements. In examining the mechanism for the elevated surface expression of CFTR, we first showed that total expression levels of wild-type, Y1424A, and Y1424A,I1427A were the same. We next demonstrated that maturation efficiency and protein half-life were unaffected, suggesting that a primary alteration caused by these substitutions involved changes in distribution between the intracellular and cell surface compartments. This alteration could result from decreased internalization or increased recycling or both. Moreover, we showed that Y1424A,I1427A CFTR was internalized much more slowly than the native protein (76% inhibition at 2.5 min) with an internalization rate of ∼2%/min. Several observations suggest that the only internalization signal in CFTR is the Tyr1424-X-X-Ile1427 motif in the COOH-terminal tail. First, the ablation of the only endocytosis signal in the transferrin receptor YTRF resulted in a similar loss of internalization activity (11Collawn J.F. Stangel M. Kuhn L.A. Esekogwu V. Jing S. Trowbridge I.S. Tainer J.A. Cell. 1990; 63: 1061-1072Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the rate of endocytosis of the 20YTRF23 →20ARTA23 mutant was the same as a transferrin receptor containing only a 4-amino acid cytoplasmic tail, indicating that this motif and more specifically these two residues were the only residues in the 61-amino acid cytoplasmic tail of the transferrin receptor that were necessary for endocytosis. Second, the internalization rate of Y1424A,I1427A CFTR is comparable with the rate of bulk flow lipid uptake via the endocytic pathway (∼2%/min.) (18Mukherjee S. Ghosh R.N. Maxfield F.R. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 759-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (1298) Google Scholar), suggesting that the residual internalization activity observed in these studies reflects nonspecific uptake through clathrin-coated pits. Considering that clathrin-coated pits constitute ∼2% of the cell surface (18Mukherjee S. Ghosh R.N. Maxfield F.R. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 759-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (1298) Google Scholar), our findings suggest that the double mutant has completely lost the ability to concentrate in these surface domains. This result has particular significance given the increasing evidence that CFTR enters the endocytic pathway via clathrin-coated pits (2Lukacs G.L. Segal G. Kartner N. Grinstein S. Zhang F. Biochem. J. 1997; 328: 353-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 4Bradbury N.A. Cohn J.A. Venglarik C.J. Bridges R.J. J. Biol.

Chem. 2001; 276: 46251-46259Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The signal identified here, YXXI, appears to function only as an internalization signal and not a “down-regulation” signal for conferring CFTR degradation. If YXXI was important to mediate CFTR degradation, metabolic pulse-chase experiments would have revealed an extended half-life when the signal was inactivated. Our studies indicate that CFTR lacking YXXI is stabilized at the cell surface because endocytosis of this mutant is severely compromised. This also suggests that CFTR participates in the membrane-recycling pathway. This idea is consistent with previously reported immunolocalization studies that have shown that CFTR co-localizes with rab4, a component of recycling endosomes (9Webster P. Vanacore L. Nairn A.C. Marino C.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: C340-C348Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The reasons why CFTR would be part of this pathway are unclear, but it may be to regulate the amount of functional chloride channels at the cell surface in the same manner as aquaporins and glucose transporters are regulated (20Brown D.

The specific residues identified by these studies, YXXI, that are important for CFTR endocytosis are conserved in the ten COOH-terminal tail sequences spanning from Xenopus to human (3Prince L.S. Peter K. Hatton S.R. Zaliauskiene L. Cotlin L.F. Clancy J.P. Marchase R.B. Collawn J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3602-3609Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The tyrosine residue is conserved among all species with the exception of the dogfish, which has a phenylalanine residue. The isoleucine residue is conserved in 7 of 10 sequences with a very conservative leucine residue substitution in the other three, indicating that this motif, YXX(I/L), is highly conserved in the sequences identified to date. Both FXXL (dogfish) and YXX(I/L) conform to the YXXΦ motif common to internalization signals, where X is any amino acid and Φ is a hydrophobic residue (10Trowbridge I.S. Collawn J.F. Hopkins C.R. Ann. Rev. Cell Biol. 1993; 9: 129-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (701) Google Scholar). The identification of the YXXI signal is also consistent with recent studies that a region that includes this sequence interacts with the endocytic clathrin adaptor complex AP-2 using plasmon resonance analysis (19Weixel K.M. Bradbury N.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46251-46259Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Together, their study (19Weixel K.M. Bradbury N.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46251-46259Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) and ours support the view that CFTR endocytosis occurs through clathrin-coated pits. Our study shows that two residues in the COOH-terminal tail, tyrosine 1424 and isoleucine 1427, regulate the steady-state distribution of CFTR between the plasma membrane and intracellular sites. This raises the important and testable hypotheses that the Y1424,I1427 signal controls CFTR entry into clathrin-coated pit regions at the apical membrane and that ablation of this signal abrogates one type of microdomain targeting in polarized epithelial cells.

https://openalex.org/W1998075516,"In this study we have examined the roles of endogenous cysteine residues in the rat brain K+-dependent Na+/Ca2+ exchanger protein, NCKX2, by site-directed mutagenesis. We found that mutation of Cys-614 or Cys-666 to Ala inhibited expression of the exchanger protein in HEK-293 cells, but not in an in vitro translation system. We speculated that Cys-614 and Cys-666 might form an extracellular disulfide bond that stabilized protein structure. Such an arrangement would place the C terminus of the exchanger outside the cell, contrary to the original topological model. This hypothesis was tested by adding a hemagglutinin A epitope to the C terminus of the protein. The hemagglutinin A epitope could be recognized with a specific antibody without permeabilization of the cell membrane, supporting an extracellular location for the C terminus. Additionally, the exchanger molecule could be labeled with biotin maleimide only following extracellular application of β-mercaptoethanol. Surprisingly, mutation of Cys-395, located in the large intracellular loop, to Ala, prevented reduction-dependent labeling of the protein. The activity of wild-type exchanger, but not the Cys-395 → Ala mutant, was stimulated after application of β-mercaptoethanol. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated self-association between wild-type and FLAG-tagged exchanger proteins that could not be inhibited by Cys-395 → Ala mutation. These results suggest that NCKX2 associates as a dimer, an interaction that does not require, but may be stabilized by, a disulfide linkage through Cys-395. This linkage, perhaps by limiting protein mobility along the dimer interface, reduces the transport activity of NCKX2.

Cytosolic Ca2+ ions play key second messenger roles in numerous physiological processes in virtually all types of animal cells (1Berridge M.J. Lipp P. Bootman M.D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Biol. 2000; 1: 11-21Google Scholar). Ca2+ entering the cell across the plasma membrane during calcium signaling must be quantitatively extruded to the extracellular environment to maintain long term cellular Ca2+ homeostasis. Plasma membrane Na2+/Ca2+ exchangers are a crucial component of the Ca2+ efflux process and have been extensively investigated in a wide range of tissues, particularly in the heart and brain (2Blaustein M.P. Lederer W.J. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 763-854Google Scholar, 3Philipson K.D. Nicoll D.A. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2000; 62: 111-133Google Scholar). Various functional and molecular studies have revealed the existence of two families of Na2+/Ca2+exchanger proteins that share sequence similarity in two intramolecular homologous domains known as α-repeats (4Schwarz E.M. Benzer S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10249-10254Google Scholar).

Science. 1990; 250: 562-565Google Scholar), NCX2 (8Li Z. Matsuoka S. Hryshko L.V. Nicoll D.A. Bersohn M.M. Burke E.P. Lifton R.P. Philipson K.D. J. Biol.

NCX1 is expressed at high levels in cardiac muscle, brain, and kidney and is also present to a lesser extent in many other tissues (10Lee S.L. Yu A.S. Lytton J. J. Biol.

Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17434-17439Google Scholar, 9Nicoll D.A. Quednau B.D. Qui Z. Xia Y.R. Lusis A.J. Philipson K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24914-24921Google Scholar). All three exchangers share an overall amino acid identity of ∼70% that rises to more than 80% within the predicted transmembrane segments (TMS) (9Nicoll D.A. Quednau B.D. Qui Z. Xia Y.R. Lusis A.J. Philipson K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24914-24921Google Scholar). The second family, K+-dependent Na2+/Ca2+exchangers (NCKX), are believed to catalyze the electrogenic countertransport of 4 Na+ for 1 Ca2+ and 1 K+ (12Cervetto L. Lagnado L. Perry R.J. Robinson D.W. McNaughton P.A. Nature. 1989; 337: 740-743Google Scholar, 13Szerencsei R.T. Prinsen C.F. Schnetkamp P.P. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 6009-6015Google Scholar, 14Dong H. Light P.E. French R.J. Lytton J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25919-25928Google Scholar). NCKX exchangers differ from NCX proteins in their absolute requirement for K+, lower Ca2+transport rates, and primary amino acid sequence outside the α-repeats (2Blaustein M.P. Lederer W.J. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 763-854Google Scholar). NCKX1 was initially cloned from bovine rod photoreceptors and was believed to play a central and unique role in the mammalian phototransduction pathway because its ionic stoichiometry represented an adaptation to the unusual ionic environment of the vertebrate eye (15Reilander H. Achilles A. Friedel U. Maul G. Lottspeich F. Cook N.J. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1689-1695Google Scholar, 16Schnetkamp P.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13231-13239Google Scholar). However, evidence from functional measurements revealed some Na+/Ca2+ exchange processes that were dependent on K+ in tissues other than eye, for instance brain synaptic plasma membrane (17Dahan D. Spanier R. Rahamimoff H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2067-2075Google Scholar) and platelet (18Kimura M. Aviv A. Reeves J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6874-6877Google Scholar). This result led to the search for other putative NCKX family members. Consequently, NCKX2 was first cloned from rat brain (19Tsoi M. Rhee K.H. Bungard D. Li X.F. Lee S.L. Auer R.N. Lytton J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4155-4162Google Scholar) and then from chick and human cone photoreceptors (20Prinsen C.F. Szerencsei R.T. Schnetkamp P.P. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 1424-1434Google Scholar), and NCKX3 was recently cloned from brain and skeletal muscle (21Kraev A. Quednau B.D. Leach S. Li X.F. Dong H. Winkfein R. Perizzolo M. Cai X. Yang R. Philipson K.D. Lytton J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23161-23172Google Scholar). Expansion of the NCKX family suggests a wider role for K+-dependent Na+/Ca2+ exchange in maintaining cellular Ca2+ homeostasis than previously anticipated. The tissue-specific expression patterns of these known NCKX members may reflect the different Ca2+ handling properties of different tissues or cells.Cysteine accessibility studies have suggested that the initial hydropathy-based topological model of NCX1 needed to be revised so that mature NCX1 is now thought to contain nine TMSs with two re-entrant loops (22Nicoll D.A. Ottolia M. Lu L. Lu Y. Philipson K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 910-917Google Scholar, 23Iwamoto T. Uehara A. Imanaga I. Shigekawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38571-38580Google Scholar, 24Qiu Z. Nicoll D.A. Philipson K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 194-199Google Scholar). The current topological model of NCKX, based solely on hydropathy analysis, is reminiscent of the original NCX model before modification. Recently, examination of the hydropathy profile for NCKX3 gave rise to a new topological model in which the C-terminal hydrophobic domain contains only five TMSs, thus placing the C terminus of the exchanger protein outside the cell (21Kraev A. Quednau B.D. Leach S. Li X.F. Dong H. Winkfein R. Perizzolo M. Cai X. Yang R. Philipson K.D. Lytton J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23161-23172Google Scholar), in conflict with the initially proposed NCKX model in which the C-terminal half contains six TMSs and an intracellular C terminus. Indeed, experimental determination of the topology of the Escherichia coli inner membrane protein YrbG, a putative bacterial Na+/Ca2+ exchanger, suggested the C-terminal half has five TMSs and placed the C terminus extracellularly (25Saaf A. Baars L. von Heijne G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18905-18907Google Scholar).Cardiac Na+/Ca2+ exchanger activity was observed to be enhanced dramatically after treatment with a combination of reducing and oxidizing reagents (26Reeves J.P. Bailey C.A. Hale C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 4948-4955Google Scholar). Thiol-disulfide interchange was proposed to be the molecular mechanism underlying redox modification of exchange activity, although the precise amino acid(s) involved have not yet been identified (27Santacruz-Toloza L. Ottolia M. Nicoll D.A. Philipson K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 182-188Google Scholar). To date, experimental evidence for dynamic regulation of NCKX-type exchangers is quite limited. In this study, we have used site-directed mutagenesis to investigate the role native cysteine residues play in NCKK2 exchanger protein stability and in transport activity. A preliminary report describing some of these results was published previously in abstract form (28Cai X. Zhang K. Lytton J. Biophys. J. 2002; 82 (abstr.): 566AGoogle Scholar).EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESAll molecular procedures were performed according to standard protocols (29Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York2002Google Scholar, 30Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001Google Scholar) or the directions of reagent manufacturers, unless noted otherwise. Common chemical reagents were obtained from Fisher, Sigma, or BDH and were of analytical grade or better, unless indicated otherwise. 3-(N-Maleimidylpropionyl)biocytin (biotin maleimide, or MPB) was from Sigma or Molecular Probes. 4-Acetamido-4′-maleimidylstilbene-2,2′-disulfonic acid (AMS) was from Molecular Probes.Construction of NCKX2 MutantsThe construction of the wild-type and the FLAG-tagged full-length rat brain NCKX2 cDNA was described previously (19Tsoi M. Rhee K.H. Bungard D. Li X.F. Lee S.L. Auer R.N. Lytton J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4155-4162Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis was performed with the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) overlap extension method using the Expand High Fidelity PCR system from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Briefly, a pair of complementary primers in which cysteine-coding nucleotides were changed to those for alanine were synthesized. PCR fragments were generated using these mutagenic primers and external primers that flanked convenient unique restriction endonuclease sites in a two-step process. The purified fragment was digested and subcloned into the correspondingly digested full-length exchanger clone in pBluescript II SK (−) (Stratagene). The cDNA clone plasmid was then digested with KpnI and BamHI, and the ∼2.5-kilobase pair fragment containing the full-length NCKX2 clone was subcloned into the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3.1+ (Invitrogen). We made point mutations for each of the last four native cysteine residues of NCKX2, Cys-395 → Ala, Cys-614 → Ala, Cys-633 → Ala, and Cys-666 → Ala. We also generated combined cysteine to alanine mutations named according to the linear order of cysteines in NCKX2: C1–4 (Cys-16 → Ala, Cys-24 → Ala, Cys-154 → Ala, and Cys-224 → Ala), C1–5 (Cys-16 → Ala, Cys-24 → Ala, Cys-154 → Ala, Cys-224 → Ala, and Cys-395 → Ala), and C1–5,7 (Cys-16 → Ala, Cys-24 → Ala, Cys-154 → Ala, Cys-224 → Ala, Cys-395 → Ala, and Cys-633 → Ala). An additional cysteine residue was reintroduced back into the C1–5,7 construct to substitute Ser-105 in the N terminus (named C1–5,7+Ser-105 → Cys), or one residue at a time at selected sites between the putative loops in the C-terminal half. An HA epitope was inserted at the C terminus of FLAG-tagged NCKX2 as a 9-amino acid peptide extension (YPYDVPDYA) by a similar PCR overlap mutagenesis procedure as described above, and the HA-tagged construct was designated as FLAG-NCKX2-HA671. All constructs were confirmed by sequencing to ensure that no polymerase errors were introduced into the amplified segments.Antibody PreparationAffinity-purified rabbit antibody PA1–926 (Affinity Bioreagents, Inc.) was generated against a synthetic peptide corresponding to amino acid residues 90–102 (DLNDKIRDYTPQP) of the rat brain NCKX2. Polyclonal antibody F was prepared at the Southern Alberta Cancer Research Centre Hybridoma Facility by immunizing rabbits with a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein containing amino acids 384–463 of the rat brain NCKX2.Expression in HEK-293 CellsTransient expression of Qiagen-purified cDNA constructs in HEK-293 cells was performed using a standard calcium-phosphate precipitation protocol with BES buffer essentially as described previously (19Tsoi M. Rhee K.H. Bungard D. Li X.F. Lee S.L. Auer R.N. Lytton J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4155-4162Google Scholar). Two days following transfection, postnuclear extracts were prepared by solubilizing transfected cells for 20 min in ice-cold lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.14 m NaCl, 10 mmEDTA, 25 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 100 units/ml aproptinin, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) followed by centrifugation for 30 min at 16,000 × g. Protein concentration was determined by Bradford assay (reagent from Bio-Rad) using bovine γ-globulin as a standard. Immunoblotting was performed as described previously (19Tsoi M. Rhee K.H. Bungard D. Li X.F. Lee S.L. Auer R.N. Lytton J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4155-4162Google Scholar, 31Lytton J. Westlin M. Burk S.E. Shull G.E. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14483-14489Google Scholar) using PA1–926 antibody or M2 anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody (Sigma) and detected using Pierce SuperSignal Plus ECL reagents.In Vitro TranslationIn vitro translation of wild-type or mutated NCKX2 was performed essentially as described previously (21Kraev A. Quednau B.D. Leach S. Li X.F. Dong H. Winkfein R. Perizzolo M. Cai X. Yang R. Philipson K.D. Lytton J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23161-23172Google Scholar). In brief, cDNA constructs in the pcDNA3.1(+) vector were transcribed and translated in vitro using the TNT-T7 system (Promega) together with [35S]-methionine (Amersham Biosciences), in the presence of 0.1% Triton X-100. Following an incubation of 90 min at 30 °C, the products were resolved on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel, dried, and detected by autoradiography using Biomax MR film (Eastman Kodak Co.).Indirect ImmunofluorescenceLocation of the HA epitope was determined using immunofluorescence essentially as described previously (19Tsoi M. Rhee K.H. Bungard D. Li X.F. Lee S.L. Auer R.N. Lytton J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4155-4162Google Scholar) with some modifications. In brief, HEK-293 cells transfected with the FLAG-NCKX2-HA671 construct were grown on glass coverslips that had been precoated with 1 mg/ml poly-d-lysine (Sigma). HA-tagged intracellular Ca2+ release channel ryanodine receptor 3 (RyR3) construct (generous gift from Dr. W. Chen) was used as a control to demonstrate the integrity of the plasma membrane barrier. Transfected HEK-293 cells were rinsed in PBSCM (PBS supplemented with 0.1 mm CaCl2 and 1 mm MgCl2, pH 7.4) and then incubated with the rabbit anti-HA polyclonal antibody (1:500) in PBSCM containing 0.2% gelatin for 1 h at room temperature. The cells were then fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBSCM and blocked with 0.2% gelatin/PBSCM for 30 min. A rhodamine-conjugated anti-rabbit second antibody (1:500) was employed in 0.2% gelatin/PBSCM for 30 min. After extensive washing with PBSCM, the cells were then treated with M2 anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody (1:500) followed by a FITC-conjugated anti-mouse second antibody. In permeabilization experiments, the cells were first fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and then permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 before consecutive application of first and second antibodies as described above. Immunofluorescence microscopy was performed using standard epifluorescence optics on a Zeiss Axioscop II through a Fluar 63× objective. Images were captured using a Spot digital camera and processed with Photoshop.Cysteine-selective Labeling of NKCX2 ExchangersBiotin maleimide labeling of the NCKX2 wild-type and mutated proteins followed methods described previously (32Seal R.P. Leighton B.H. Amara S.G. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 296: 318-331Google Scholar, 33Karlin A. Akabas M.H. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 293: 123-145Google Scholar) with modification. In brief, 2 days after transfection, HEK-293 cells on 100-mm dishes were washed three times with 10 ml of PBSCM and then incubated with 3 ml of 2% β-mercaptoethanol (β-ME) in PBSCM or 2% ethanol in PBSCM for 15 min at room temperature. Cells were washed three times with 10 ml PBSCM and treated with 2 ml of PBSCM containing 100 μm biotin maleimide (20 mm stock in Me2SO) for 15 min. After washing with 10 ml of PBSCM twice, the reaction was quenched by application of 3 ml of 2% β-ME in PBSCM for 5 min followed by washing twice with 10 ml of PBSCM. In some experiments, 2 ml of 100 μm AMS in PBSCM (20 mm stock in Me2SO) was applied before addition of biotin maleimide to block extracellular cysteine labeling. Postnuclear cell lysis and protein concentration measurements were carried out as described above.All immunoprecipitation (IP) experiments were performed at 4 °C. 1 mg of protein extract was used, and the volume of the supernatant was adjusted to 1 ml with IP buffer (lysis buffer supplemented with 0.1 mg/ml ovalbumin, 1 mm benzamidine, 2 μg/μl leupeptin, and 2 μg/μl pepstatin A). After centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 5 min, the supernatant was precleared with protein A-Sepharose beads (Sigma) and transferred to a new tube. The supernatant was then mixed with 10 μg of anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody by rotating for 2 h and followed by 100 μl of 20% protein A beads for 30 min. The beads were washed consecutively by centrifuging at 3,000 rpm for 2 min, once each with IP buffer plus 0.5 m NaCl, IP buffer plus 0.1% SDS, and wash buffer (0.1% Triton X-100, 25 mm Tris-Cl, and 1 mm EDTA). The sample was then transferred to a fresh tube, and bounded proteins were recovered by adding 40 μl of 4× SDS sample buffer containing 8% β-ME and heating to 50 °C for 5 min.The proteins were separated on a 9% SDS-PAGE gel and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Biotin-labeled proteins were analyzed by incubating the membranes with PBS plus 0.1% Tween 20 containing 0.1 μg/ml horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin for 1 h after blocking with 2% bovine serum albumin for 1 h. After washing, the membranes were then developed using SuperSignal Plus ECL reagents (Pierce). To assess the level of protein present in each lane, the membranes were stripped with 0.2 m NaOH for 15 min and reprobed with rabbit anti-NCKX2 polyclonal antibody F, followed by application of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG antibody. The membranes were developed using ECL reagents.Calcium Imaging and Data AnalysisCalcium transport into transfected HEK-293 cells was measured by fura-2 fluorescent ratio digital imaging essentially as described previously (19Tsoi M. Rhee K.H. Bungard D. Li X.F. Lee S.L. Auer R.N. Lytton J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4155-4162Google Scholar, 21Kraev A. Quednau B.D. Leach S. Li X.F. Dong H. Winkfein R. Perizzolo M. Cai X. Yang R. Philipson K.D. Lytton J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23161-23172Google Scholar) with modification. In brief, 2 days after transfection, HEK-293 cells grown on poly-d-lysine-precoated coverslips were loaded with 5 μm fura-2 AM (Molecular Probes) and mounted in a perfusion chamber on a microscope stage. The ratio of fura-2 fluorescence was captured with excitation at 340 or 380 nm using the ImageMaster system (Photon Technology International). Several perfusion solutions were used: solution I (145 mm NaCl, 10 mmd-glucose, 0.1 mmCaCl2, 10 mm HEPES-trimethylamine, pH 7.4), solution II (in which the NaCl of solution I was replaced with 140 mm LiCl and 5 mm KCl), and solution III (in which the NaCl of solution I was substituted with 140 mmNaCl and 5 mm KCl). For testing activity of mutants, cells were initially perfused with solution I for 5 min, followed by alternating changes to solution II for 2 min. For investigating redox-dependent regulation of NCKX2, cells were first incubated with solution III for 17 min without collecting ratio imaging data. Upon changing to perfusion solution I for 2 min, fura-2 fluorescence measurements were started. Perfusion was changed successively to solution II for 2 min and solution I for 2 min. Then, the cells were incubated with either 2% β-ME or 2% ethanol in solution III for 15 min, followed by perfusion with solution III for 2 min. Finally, the cells were subjected consecutively to perfusion solutions I, II, and I for 2 min each.Imaging data were analyzed as described previously (19Tsoi M. Rhee K.H. Bungard D. Li X.F. Lee S.L. Auer R.N. Lytton J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4155-4162Google Scholar, 21Kraev A. Quednau B.D. Leach S. Li X.F. Dong H. Winkfein R. Perizzolo M. Cai X. Yang R. Philipson K.D. Lytton J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23161-23172Google Scholar) using the ImageMaster program and Excel (Microsoft). For redox experiments, all the ratio data were normalized to the height of the first peak ratio. The height of peaks (with base line subtracted) following treatment was compared with the control peak height before treatment. Data were then tested for statistical significance using one-way analysis of variance with Newman-Keuls multiple comparison.Co-immunoprecipitationThe FLAG epitope-tagged NCKX2 (the FLAG epitope is amino acids DYKDDDDK) was created by altering the extracellular sequence found at amino acids 90–97 (DLNDKIRD) in the rat brain NCKX2 as described previously (19Tsoi M. Rhee K.H. Bungard D. Li X.F. Lee S.L. Auer R.N. Lytton J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4155-4162Google Scholar). Consequently FLAG-tagged NCKX2 is not recognized by the PA1–926 antibody (see Fig. 5), which is directed against amino acids 90–102. Two days after co-transfection of the appropriate wild-type and FLAG-tagged constructs, HEK-293 cells were solubilized and NCKX2 was immunoprecipitated using M2 anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody as described above, except the only detergent in the lysis/IP buffer was 1% CHAPS. Protein A beads were then washed three times with IP buffer containing 0.3% CHAPS. Samples were eluted from protein A beads and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting using PA1–926 antibody and reprobed with anti-FLAG antibody, as describe above.DISCUSSIONIn this study, we have prepared cDNA constructs that express the plasma membrane NCKX2 exchanger protein with various single or combined mutations of cysteine residues, to investigate the role of native sulfhydryls in the expression and function of NCKX2. We demonstrated that, of eight endogenous cysteine residues, both Cys-614 and Cys-666 were critical for functional expression of NCKX2 in HEK-293 cells. In mammalian cells, the cytosol is a reducing environment, which prevents the formation of inter- or intrachain disulfide bonds between intracellularly exposed cysteine residues. Therefore, disulfide bonds of an integral membrane protein most likely exist either extracellularly, embedded internally in the protein structure, or within the lipid bilayer. Thus, we speculated that Cys-614 and Cys-666 might form a structurally and functionally important cystine disulfide bond, exposed on the extracellular side of the plasma membrane.To test this hypothesis, we examined the location of the nearby C terminus of NCKX2 with carefully controlled immunofluorescence experiments. Our data confirmed an extracellular location of the C terminus. On the basis of these data, we propose a new topology model for NCKX2 (Fig. 2C) that is consistent with both the prediction for NCKX3 (21Kraev A. Quednau B.D. Leach S. Li X.F. Dong H. Winkfein R. Perizzolo M. Cai X. Yang R. Philipson K.D. Lytton J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23161-23172Google Scholar) and the data on the putative bacterial Na+/Ca2+ exchanger protein, YrbG (25Saaf A. Baars L. von Heijne G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18905-18907Google Scholar). These findings give rise to the possibility that NCKX-type exchangers may have a different topology than NCX-type exchangers in which the C terminus is believed to be inside the cell (3Philipson K.D. Nicoll D.A. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2000; 62: 111-133Google Scholar).NCKX-type exchangers and NCX-type exchangers share no significant similarity in their amino acid sequences outside the α-repeat regions. However, both new models for NCKX- and NCX-type exchangers place the α-repeat regions on the opposite face of the membrane (22Nicoll D.A. Ottolia M. Lu L. Lu Y. Philipson K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 910-917Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that NCX and NCKX exchangers have similar conserved structural elements formed by the α-repeat regions, surrounded by a different overall transmembrane structure. It remains an intriguing possibility that such structural differences between NCKX- and NCX-type exchangers may underlie their distinctive ion stoichiometry. The accuracy of this new NCKX-type exchanger topology will need more supportive proof from further experimental studies.Studies using cysteine-scanning mutagenesis of NCX1 have revealed a novel C-terminal structure that differs remarkably from the previous putative topological model based on hydropathy analysis (3Philipson K.D. Nicoll D.A. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2000; 62: 111-133Google Scholar). A cysteine-labeling experiment using biotin maleimide demonstrated that the endogenous sulfhydryls of NCKX2 could not be detected under normal conditions. Therefore, cysteine residues were reintroduced, one at a time, at sites in the putative C-terminal loops. None of these reintroduced cysteine residues reacted with biotin maleimide, even after β-ME treatment, suggesting they may be buried in the membrane and hence inaccessible for labeling. Furthermore, and discussed below, β-ME-dependent labeling of NCKX2 did not involve the endogenous Cys-614 and Cys-666 proposed to have an extracellular disposition. These results may indicate that the current model for threading of the C terminus protein of NCKX2 through the membrane needs substantial revision, as demonstrated by the topological studies of NCX1 (22Nicoll D.A. Ottolia M. Lu L. Lu Y. Philipson K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 910-917Google Scholar, 23Iwamoto T. Uehara A. Imanaga I. Shigekawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38571-38580Google Scholar).Furthermore, treatment of NCKX2 with reducing agent stimulated its activity, an effect that was abolished by mutation of Cys-395 to Ala. Redox signaling"
https://openalex.org/W2064713399,"The effectors of monomeric GTP-binding proteins can influence interactions with GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) in two ways. In one case, effector and GAP binding to the GTP-binding protein is mutually exclusive. In another case, the GTP-binding protein bound to an effector is the substrate for the GTPase-activating protein. Here predictions for these two mechanisms were tested for the Arf1 effector GGA and ASAP family Arf GAPs. GGA inhibited Arf GAP activity of ASAP1, AGAP1, ARAP1, and Arf GAP1 and inhibited binding of Arf1·GTPγS to AGAP1 with K i values correlating with the K d for the GGA·Arf1 complex. ASAP1 blocked Arf1·GTPγS binding to GGA with a K isimilar to the K d for the ASAP·Arf1·GTPγS complex. No interaction of GGA with ASAP1 was detected. Consistent with GGA sequestering Arf from GAPs, overexpression of GGA slowed the rate of Arf dissociation from the Golgi apparatus following treatment with brefeldin A. Mutational analysis revealed the amino-terminal α-helix and switch I of Arf1 contributed to interaction with both GGA and GAPs. These data exclude the mechanism previously documented for Arf GAP1/coatomer in which Arf1 is inactivated in a tripartite complex. Instead, termination of Arf1 signals mediated through GGA require that Arf1·GTP dissociates from GGA prior to interaction with GAP and consequent hydrolysis of GTP.

The Arfs are a family of GTP-binding proteins within the Ras superfamily (1Moss J. Vaughan M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21431-21434Google Scholar, 2Moss J. Vaughan M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12327-12330Google Scholar). The Arfs include Arf1–6 and the Arf-like proteins. Of these two groups, the Arf proteins have been the most extensively studied. The Arf proteins were first identified as cofactors for cholera toxin-catalyzed ADP-ribosylation of the heterotrimeric GTP-binding protein Gs (3Kahn R.A. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 7906-7911Google Scholar). Subsequently, physiological roles for the Arfs have been found as regulators of membrane traffic and the actin cytoskeleton (for reviews see Refs. 1Moss J. Vaughan M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21431-21434Google Scholar, 2Moss J. Vaughan M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12327-12330Google Scholar, and 4Rothman J.E.

Like other GTP-binding proteins, Arf functions as a switch. Arf·GDP is inactive. Arf·GTP binds effectors to mediate signals. A number of Arf·GTP-binding proteins have been identified including vesicle coat proteins (coatomer, AP1, AP3, AP4, GGA1/2/3), phospholipase D, phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate 5-kinase, arfaptin, and arfophilin (5Donaldson J.G. Jackson C.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 475-482Google Scholar, 7Randazzo P.A. Nie Z. Miura K. Hsu V.W. Science STKE. 2000; (http://www.stke.org/cgi/content/full/OC_sigtrans; 2000/RE1)Google Scholar). The function of coat proteins requires that Arf cycles between the active and inactive forms (1Moss J. Vaughan M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21431-21434Google Scholar, 4Rothman J.E. Nature. 1994; 372: 55-63Google Scholar, 6Donaldson J.G. Klausner R.D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 527-532Google Scholar). Arf·GTP binds to and recruits coat proteins to a donor membrane, and the hydrolysis of GTP to form Arf·GDP is necessary for coat proteins to dissociate from vesicles. The physiologic function of Arf with other effectors presumably also requires a cycle of GTP binding and hydrolysis. Effectors have been found to affect the interaction of Ras family GTP-binding proteins with their cognate GAPs 1The abbreviations used are: GAPs, GTPase-activating proteins; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate; (PI(4, 5)P2, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate; DTT, dithiothreitol; PA, phosphatidic acid; BFA, brefeldin A; GST, glutathioneS-transferase; GFP, green fluorescent protein; VHS, Vps27, Hrs, STAM1 homology; GAT, GGA and TOM1 homology; GGA, Golgi-associated, γ-adaptin homologous, Arf-interacting in one of two ways (8Vetter I.R. Wittinghofer A. Science. 2001; 294: 1299-1304Google Scholar). First, some effectors have been found to inhibit GAP activity. For instance, Ras GAPs and effectors compete for an overlapping binding site on Ras·GTP; therefore, Ras effectors inhibit GAPs, and Ras must be dissociated from the effector in order to be inactivated by GAP (8Vetter I.R. Wittinghofer A. Science. 2001; 294: 1299-1304Google Scholar, 9Spoerner M. Herrmann C. Vetter I.R. Kalbitzer H.R. Wittinghofer A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1995; 270: 2901-2905Google Scholar). The Ran effector importin is also inhibitory (8Vetter I.R. Wittinghofer A. Science. 2001; 294: 1299-1304Google Scholar, 13Floer M. Blobel G. Rexach M. J.

Cell. 1999; 97: 635-646Google Scholar). In other cases, effectors have been found to facilitate interaction of GTP-binding proteins with GAPs. One example is Ran-binding protein (RanBP) (8Vetter I.R. Wittinghofer A. Science. 2001; 294: 1299-1304Google Scholar, 15Vetter I.R. Arndt A. Kutay U. Gorlich D. Wittinghofer A. Cell. 1999; 97: 635-646Google Scholar, 16Bischoff F.R. Gorlich D.

A complex of Ran with RanBP is the substrate for Ran GAP. As for other GTP-binding proteins, the conversion of Arf·GTP to Arf·GDP is facilitated by GAPs (18Vitale N. Patton W.A. Moss J. Vaughan M.

Arf1 inactivation is thought to involve a tripartite complex of Arf GAP, Arf1, and the Arf-binding protein coatomer (26Goldberg J. Cell. 1999; 96: 893-902Google Scholar). However, different from that found for other Ras-like GTP-binding proteins, Arf GAP1 activity has been found to be stimulated 2–3 orders of magnitude by the effector coatomer (26Goldberg J. Cell. 1999; 96: 893-902Google Scholar). Based on these results, coatomer has been proposed to contribute a catalytic residue into the GTP-binding site of Arf1, consequently inducing the hydrolysis of GTP, while simultaneously bound to Arf1·GTP and Arf GAP1. Here we tested whether the regulatory interactions described for Arf GAP1 and coatomer extrapolate to the Arf effector GGA. Our results exclude the formation of tripartite complex of GAP·Arf1·GGA as occurs with coatomer and Arf GAP1. Instead, the data are consistent with Arf1 regulation being similar to that of Ras. GGA and GAPs compete for overlapping sites on Arf1. Therefore, Arf1 must dissociate from the coat protein GGA prior to inactivation by Arf GAPs. The open reading frame for a His6-tagged Arf GAP1 in pcDNA3 was the gift from Drs. Victor Hsu and Dan Cassel. POW12 for the expression of Arf1 in bacteria has been described previously (27Randazzo P.A. Weiss O. Kahn R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 219: 362-369Google Scholar). Constructs for the bacterial expression of fusions of GST and the VHS and VHS GAT domains of GGA3 and for a His6-tagged full-length GGA1 were gifts from Drs. Rosa Puertollano and Juan Bonifacino (NICHD, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda). The reading frames expressing the VHS, VHS GAT, and GAT domains of GGA1 were amplified from the plasmid provided by Dr. Bonifacino using Vent polymerase and inserted into pET19 to provide a vector for expression the His10-tagged proteins. GFP fused to the VHS and to the VHS GAT domains from GGA3 and yellow fluorescent protein fused to GGA1 were gifts from Drs. Juan Bonifacino and Rosa Puertollano. Mutations were introduced using the Quikchange kit (Stratagene). Arf proteins were expressed in bacteria and purified as described (27Randazzo P.A. Weiss O. Kahn R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 219: 362-369Google Scholar). The proteins were not myristoylated. In preliminary studies we found that GGA inhibited GAP activity against myristoylated Arf and nonmyristoylated Arf to the same extent. Therefore, we used nonmyristoylated Arf to ensure homogeneity of the proteins as the extent of myristoylation of recombinant Arfs varied between preparations and between the mutants used in these studies. A fusion protein of GST and the VHS GAT domains of GGA3 was expressed and purified as described (28Dell'Angelica E.C. Puertollano R. Mullins C. Aguilar R.C. Vargas J.D. Hartnell L.M. Bonifacino J.S. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 81-93Google Scholar). His6-tagged GGA1 was expressed in bacteria, and His6 Arf GAP1 was expressed in HEK293T cells. Both proteins were purified using the Talon® kit from Clontech. AGAP1 and [347–804]AGAP1 were expressed as proteins fused to GST 2Z. Nie, K. Stanley, S. Stauffer, K. Jacques, D. Hirsch, and P. Randazzo, submitted for publication. and purified using glutathione beads (Amersham Biosciences) by standard methods. FLAG-tagged ARAP1 and ASAP1b were expressed in and purified from HEK293T cells (20Miura K. Jacques K.M. Stauffer S. Kubosaki A. Zhu K.J. Hirsch D.S. Resau J. Zheng Y. Randazzo P.A. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 109-119Google Scholar, 30Randazzo P.A. Miura K. Jackson T.R. Methods Enzymol. 2001; 329: 343-354Google Scholar). [325–724]ASAP1b was expressed in and purified from bacteria (21Andreev J. Simon J.P. Sabatini D.D. Kam J. Plowman G. Randazzo P.A. Schlessinger J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2338-2350Google Scholar, 22Brown M.T. Andrade J. Radhakrishna H. Donaldson J.G. Cooper J.A. Randazzo P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7038-7051Google Scholar). Two approaches were used to quantify protein-protein binding. One was a direct measurement. Because of low affinities, precipitation assays with washes could not be used. Instead, GGA fused to GST was immobilized on glutathione beads. In a separate reaction, Arf1 was loaded with [35S]GTPγS by incubating 1–5 μmrecombinant Arf1 with 0.5–1 μm[35S]GTPγS (specific activity = 50,000 cpm/pmol) in 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 1 mm dithiothreitol (DTT) for 60 min at 30 °C. Arf1·[35S]GTPγS was then incubated with the immobilized GGA at constant temperature (30 °C) in 20 mmTris, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm GTP, 2 mmMgCl, 1 mm DTT, 0.1% Triton X-100 and, unless otherwise indicated, 90 μm phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2) and 360 μm phosphatidic acid in a total volume of 50–100 μl. The beads were separated from bulk solution by a brief (5–10 s) centrifugation. Eighty percent of the total volume was removed as supernatant. GTPγS bound to Arf1 both in the supernatant and in the solution containing the beads (pellet) was determined by scintillation spectrometry. With no binding, 20% of the Arf·GTPγS should be associated with the beads because this is the relative volume of the beads relative to the total reaction volume. The percent of Arf·GTPγS associated with the beads should increase on binding to GGA as described in Equation 1. This same approach was used with GST-AGAP1. The results for AGAP1 agreed with theK d value determined by competitive inhibition of Arf GAP activity by Arf1·GTPγS, (Arf·GTPγS)pelletEquation 1 =0.2(Arf·GTPγS)total+0.8(Bmax)[GGA](Kd+[GGA])where (Arf1·GTPγS)pellet is the amount of Arf·GTPγS in the pellet; (Arf·GTPγS)total is the total amount of Arf1·GTPγS in the assay, andB max is the maximum observed binding. Wittinghofer and colleagues (12Herrmann C. Martin G.A. Wittinghofer A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2901-2905Google Scholar) have described another approach to determine affinities. As shown in the scheme in Fig. 2 B, which is exactly analogous to that described for Ras (12Herrmann C. Martin G.A. Wittinghofer A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2901-2905Google Scholar), GTP dissociates from free Arf1 at a rate of k −1 and Arf1 bound to GGA at a rate of k −2 as described in Equation 2.−d[Arf1·GTPγS]/dtEquation 2 =k−1[Arf1·GTPγS]+k−2[GGA·Arf1·GTPγS]GTP dissociates much more slowly from Arf1·GGA than from free Arf1 (see Fig. 2 C), i.e. k −1 ≫ k −2; therefore, the rate of dissociation can be estimated by Equation3.−d[Arf1·GTPγS]/dt=k−1[Arf1·GTPγS]freeEquation 3 (Arf1·GTPγS)free is Arf1·GTPγS that is not complexed with GGA. With Arf1·GTPγS ≪ K d for binding GGA, we were able to estimate the K d by measuring the dissociation rate, k obs, at varying concentrations of GGA and fitting the data to Equation 4(12Herrmann C. Martin G.A. Wittinghofer A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2901-2905Google Scholar).kobs=k−11+[GGA]KdEquation 4 In these experiments, [35S]GTPγS·Arf1 was prepared by incubating 1 μm Arf1 with 1 μm[35S]GTPγS in 25 mm Tris, 100 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 1 mm DTT at 30 °C for 60 min. 7.5 μl of the reaction was added to a reaction containing 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 mm GTPγS (no radiolabel), 22.5 μmPI(4,5)P2, 360 μm PA, and other additions as indicated to initiate the displacement of [35S]GTPγS by unlabeled GTPγS. Samples were taken at 6 time points, and protein-bound 35S was trapped on nitrocellulose, and35S was quantified by scintillation spectrometry. The data were fit to a single exponential decay equation to determinek obs. NIH 3T3 fibroblasts were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C. The cells were transfected with the indicated plasmids using FuGENE (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Twenty four hours after transfection, the cells were treated for 1 min with 56 μm brefeldin A (BFA), fixed with 2% formaldehyde, and immunostained with an antibody to Arf (1D9 mouse monoclonal, ABR). The secondary antibody for visualizing Arf was Alexa 594-conjugated goat anti-mouse. Nitrocellulose filter binding to determine protein-bound nucleotide was performed as described (27Randazzo P.A. Weiss O. Kahn R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 219: 362-369Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined by the Bio-Rad Dye binding assay. GAP activity was determined as described (31Randazzo P.A. Kahn R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10758-10763Google Scholar). Statistical analyses were performed with GraphPad Prism®. As we had found previously (32Puertollano R. Randazzo P.A. Presley J.F. Hartnell L.M. Bonifacino J.S. Cell. 2001; 105: 93-102Google Scholar), GGA inhibited Arf GAP activity (Fig. 1). The inhibition was independent of the GAP being examined. Truncated GGA3 consisting of the VHS GAT domains was titrated into GAP reactions using ASAP1, a truncated ASAP1 consisting of the residues 325–724, AGAP1, Arf GAP1, and ARAP1 as enzymes. The inhibition in each case occurred with similarK i values for GGA (Fig. 1 A and TableI).Table ICorrelation of inhibition and dissociation constantsGAPKiVHS GAT (GGA3)VHS GAT (GGA1)GAT (GGA1)VHSGGA1μmA.

Open table in a new tab Inhibition by GGA was dependent on GAT, the domain of GGA that binds Arf1·GTP. By using either AGAP1 or ASAP1, we found that full-length GGA1, truncated proteins consisting of the VHS GAT domains of either GGA1 or GGA3, and the isolated GAT domain of GGA1 inhibited GAP activity (Table I and Fig. 1, A and B). The isolated VHS domain had little or no effect. Inhibition of GAP activity correlated with GGA binding to Arf1·GTP. Binding of Arf1 to GGA has been demonstrated by two-hybrid experiments; however, this approach does not allow affinities to be quantified and, consequently, correlation with the inhibition constants. We used two assays to quantify equilibrium binding. In one, Arf1 loaded with [35S]GTPγS was incubated with VHS GAT fused with GST and bound to glutathione-agarose beads. The beads were separated from the bulk solution by centrifugation, and Arf1·GTPγS in the bulk solution and the pellet was measured. By using this assay, we found that GGA bound Arf1 ∼10-fold more tightly in the presence of PA and PI(4,5)P2 (conditions used for the GAP assays) than in the absence of these lipids (Fig.2 A). The K dof 0.51 μm ± 0.06 μm correlated closely with the K i of 0.5 μm measured for GAP activity of ASAP1, AGAP1, ARAP1, and Arf GAP1. A second approach to measure the interaction between GGA and Arf1 has been used to examine effector interaction with Ras by Wittinghofer and colleagues (12Herrmann C. Martin G.A. Wittinghofer A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2901-2905Google Scholar). As for Ras, dissociation of GTP from Arf1 bound to effector (k −2 in Fig. 2 B) is much slower than GTP dissociation from free Arf1 (k −1). Therefore, the K dvalue for Arf1·GGA could be determined by measuring the GTPγS dissociation rate, k obs, in the presence of increasing concentrations of GGA (Fig. 2 C) and analyzing the relationship between the k obs and effector concentration according to Equation 4. The derivedK d was similar to the values determined from the direct binding assay (Table I, part B). The results further support the correlation between K d for Arf1·effector andK i for effector inhibition of GAP activity. The isolated GAT domain had a higher K i in the GAP assay and a higher K d for Arf1 binding than did the VHS GAT(GGA1) or VHS GAT (GGA3) (Table I, part B). The similarity between K d and K ivalues suggested that GGA inhibited GAP activity by sequestering Arf1·GTP. However, these results do not exclude other mechanisms of inhibition including an inhibitory interaction between the GAP and effector. If GGA sequestered Arf1·GTP, then GGA should inhibit the binding of Arf1·GTP to GAP. To test this prediction, we examined Arf1 bound to the slowly hydrolyzable GTP analog GTPγS. GAP does not induce hydrolysis of GTPγS bound to Arf1. Without hydrolysis of GTP, we were able to measure the direct binding of Arf1·GTPγS to a protein composed of the pleckstrin homology, Arf GAP, and ANK repeat domains of AGAP1 fused to GST with the same assay used to measure binding of Arf1·GTPγS to GGA fused to GST. A K dof 0.78 ± 0.16 μm was determined, similar to theK d of 1.1 ± 0.05 μm determined by competition of Arf1·GTPγS with Arf1·GTP in the GAP assay. VHS GAT (GGA1) into the binding assay inhibited Arf1·GTPγS binding to AGAP1 with a K i of 0.94 ± 0.2 μm(assuming a K d for AGAP1·Arf1 of 0.78 μm, Fig.3 A). If GGA sequesters Arf1·GTP, then, conversely, Arf1·GTP bound to GAP should be sequestered from GGA. To test this, we again examined Arf1 bound to GTPγS so effects could not be attributed to inactivating Arf1. We found that [325–724]ASAP1 inhibited Arf1·GTPγS binding to GGA (Fig. 3 B). TheK d for ASAP1·Arf1·GTPγS, 4.0 ± 0.6 μm, was similar to the K i, 4.3 ± 0.31 μm, determined assuming the K dfor GGA·Arf1 is 0.5 μm. No interaction between ASAP1 and GGA was detected when each was present in excess of the concentration of GAP giving half-maximal inhibition of Arf1·GGA interaction (Fig. 3 C). [325–724]ASAP1 was incubated with GST-VHS GAT immobilized on glutathione beads. The amount of ASAP1 associated with the beads was the same in the absence or presence of GGA. Taken together, these data exclude the formation of a three part complex of Arf1·GTP·GGA·GAP. The data also exclude the possibility of a direct interaction between GGA and GAP resulting in the inhibition of Arf1·GTP binding to either protein in the complex. Instead, the data are consistent with mutually exclusive binding of GAP and GGA to Arf1. As a further test for the effect of GGA on GAP activity, the effect of overexpressing GGA and GGA constructs on BFA-induced Arf dissociation from the Golgi was examined. If GGA binding to Arf prevented GAP activity, then GGA should slow Arf dissociation from the Golgi that results from inactivation of exchange factors with BFA. As predicted, the VHS domain of GGA, which does not bind Arf, had no effect on Arf dissociation from the Golgi (not shown). However, the VHS GAT domain and full-length GGA1 protein slowed Arf dissociation (Fig.4). When untreated, Arf was concentrated around the nucleus in cells that did not express GGA ectopically (open arrows), cells that expressed VHS GAT (solid arrows), or cells that ectopically expressed epitope-tagged GGA1 (arrowheads). After a 1-min BFA treatment, the distribution of Arf had substantially changed from a perinuclear to a diffuse distribution in nontransfected cells (open arrows). In contrast, Arf was still perinuclear in the cells expressing VHS GAT (solid arrows) or GGA1 (arrowheads). These results are similar to those obtained with GFP-tagged Arf1 (32Puertollano R. Randazzo P.A. Presley J.F. Hartnell L.M. Bonifacino J.S. Cell. 2001; 105: 93-102Google Scholar). If the GAP and effectors have overlapping sites, then mutations in Arf1 affecting the binding site should affect both GAP and GGA interaction. Several mutant Arf1s were chosen to test this prediction. Because of the previously documented critical role of the amino-terminal α-helix (33Randazzo P.A. Terui T. Sturch S. Fales H.M. Ferrige A.G.

Terui T. Sturch S. Kahn R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29490-29494Google Scholar, 36Hong J.X. Haun R.S. Tsai S.C. Moss J. Vaughan M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9743-9745Google Scholar) and Arf1 with residues 3–7 replaced with residues 3–7 of ScArf1 ([3–7LFASK]Arf1) (33Randazzo P.A. Terui T. Sturch S. Fales H.M. Ferrige A.G. Kahn R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14809-14815Google Scholar). We examined Arf1 with mutations in residues of switch I and II. Some of these mutants had been shown previously (37Kuai J. Boman A.L. Arnold R.S. Zhu X.J. Kahn R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4022-4032Google Scholar) to affect interaction with GGA in two-hybrid studies. The effects of these mutations on nucleotide binding have been documented previously (37Kuai J. Boman A.L. Arnold R.S. Zhu X.J. Kahn R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4022-4032Google Scholar, 38Kuai J. Boman A.L. Arnold R.S. Zhu X.J. Kahn R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4022-4032Google Scholar). We also examined Arf1 with a mutation at glutamate 105. This mutant Arf1 bound GTPγS to the same extent as did the wild type protein (not shown). We first compared the effect of the mutations on interactions with two Arf GAPs, AGAP1 and ASAP1. The amount of GAP necessary to induce hydrolysis of 50% of the GTP bound to Arf1 (we call this amount of GAP “C 50 ” for concentration for 50% hydrolysis) was determined (Table II). The C 50 is proportional toK m/k cat. Therefore, a large number would indicate a low affinity (large K m), lowk cat, or both. The relative effects of the mutations in Arf1 on C 50 values were similar for AGAP1 and ASAP1. Mutation of residues 3–7 ([3–7LFASK]Arf1), tyrosine 81 ([Y81H]Arf1), or glutamate 105 ([E105A]Arf1) did not affect the C 50 for either ASAP1 or AGAP1. Deletion of the amino terminus ([Δ13]Arf1), mutation of isoleucine 49 ([I49T]Arf1), or mutation of phenylalanine 51 ([F51Y]Arf1) affected the C 50 values for both Arf GAPs. TheC 50 values in part reflect changes in affinities. The effects of the mutations on direct binding to AGAP1 correlated with effects on C 50 values (TableII). Mutation of residues 3–7, tyrosine 81, and glutamate 105 had no effect on affinity, whereas deletion of the amino terminus, mutation of isoleucine 49, and mutation of phenylalanine 51 decreased the affinity.Table IIEffect of Arf1 mutations on interaction with GGA and GAPsKdC50VHS GATAGAP1AGAP1ASAP1μmμmArf10.51 ± 0.06 (5)0.78 ± 0.16 (8)55 ± 26 (5)0.45 ± 0.17 (19)[Δ13]Arf13.7 ± 0.95 (3)NBDaNBD, no binding detected.NADbNAD, no activity detected.104 ± 39 (4)[3–7LFASK]Arf10.64 ± 0.03 (2)0.62 ± 0.05 (2)66 ± 11 (2)0.32 ± 0.15 (3)[I49T]Arf11.8 ± 0.71 (3)1.1 ± 0.11 (3)516 ± 90 (2)12 ± 4.7 (3)[F51Y]Arf13.0 ± 0.11 (2)2.3 ± 0.64 (3)615 ± 75 (2)3.8 ± 1.6 (3)[R79G]Arf10.45 ± 0.18 (2)Not doneNot done0.69 ± 0.26 (3)[Y81H]Arf11.7 ± 0.3 (2)0.53 ± 0.06 (3)50 ± 12 (2)0.48 ± 0.27 (3)[E105A]Arf1Not done0.63 ± 0.07 (3)"

However, there is an imperfect correlation between Aβ deposition and neuronal loss or dementia. To clarify neuronal responses to Aβ, Aβ-induced gene expression in cultured cortical neurons was analyzed by differential display followed by Northern blotting. Here we report that nonaggregated or aggregated Aβ induced microtubule-associated protein 1B (MAP1B) mRNA, especially the alternative transcript containing exon 3U, before disruption of the cell membrane by Aβ. An alternative transcript containing exon 3U is translated into an N-terminal truncated shorter isoform of MAP1B. Transfection experiments reveal that overexpression of this isoform does not accelerate neurite outgrowth or apoptosis of cortical neurons. In contrast, overexpression of MAP1B fragments containing the N-terminal 126 amino acids promoted neurite outgrowth and neuronal apoptosis. These results suggest that Aβ does not induce deleterious full-length MAP1B directly, but overexpression of full-length MAP1B might act as an effector of cell death in neurodegenerative disorders related to cytoskeletal abnormalities. β-amyloid (Aβ) is presumed to play a pathogenic role in Alzheimer's disease (AD).

Pathological studies of Down's syndrome have indicated that deposition of Aβ throughout the neocortex is the earliest event among the three lesions seen in the AD neocortex (1Wisniewski K.E. Wisniewski H.M. Wen G.Y. Ann. Neurol. 1985; 17: 278-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (976) Google Scholar). Moreover, mutations in the three genes associated with familial AD cause increases in Aβ production (2Hardy J. Trends Neurosci. 1997; 20: 154-159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1275) Google Scholar), and Aβ has a toxic effect on cultured neuronal cells via an increase in reactive oxygen species production and/or activation of specific immediate-early genes (3Small D.H.

These contradictory findings in vitro and in vivo suggest that Aβ induces not only molecules that activate the cell death pathway but also molecules that protect neurons from Aβ toxicity in the neocortex. To begin to understand the molecular mechanisms of Aβ toxicity and the protective response of neurons against Aβ, we applied the method of RNA differential display to isolate the genes implicated in Aβ toxicity or protective responses to Aβ. The results presented here demonstrate that nonaggregated or aggregated Aβ induces MAP1B mRNA, especially the alternative transcript containing exon 3U. Transfection experiments of MAP1B isoforms in cultured cortical neurons indicated that full-length MAP1B but not the alternative MAP1B isoform resulted in the acceleration of neuronal death. Cerebral cortices dissected from day E17 embryonic rats were dissociated by incubation with 0.08% trypsin/0.008% DNase I at 37 °C for 10 min and passed through a 62-μm nylon mesh. The cells (4 × 104 cell/well or 4.5 × 106 cells/dish, respectively) were seeded in 96-well plates or 6-cm dishes, both of which were precoated with gelatin-polyornithine, and were cultured for 7 days in MEM with 5% fetal bovine serum and 10 μm β-mercaptoethanol. For treatment with nonaggregated Aβ peptide, Aβ-(1–42) (Bachem) was dissolved at 250 μm in 0.05 N HCl, filtered through a 0.45-μm membrane filter, diluted with MEM with N2 supplement (MEM-N2), and neutralized. The nonaggregated Aβ peptide was added to the 7-DIV cultures at a concentration of 5 μm immediately after preparation. For treatment with aggregated Aβ peptide, Aβ-(1–42) was dissolved at 250 μm in 0.05 n HCl, neutralized, and incubated at 37 °C for 4 days. The aggregated peptide suspension was diluted with MEM-N2 and added to the 7 DIV cultures at a concentration of 5 μm. Neuronal viability was determined by an MTT assay (12Manthorpe M. Fagnani R. Skaper S.D. Varon S. Brain Res. 1986; 390: 191-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar) and trypan blue exclusion. Poly(A)+RNA from cultured rat neurons was isolated using an Amersham Biosciences Micro mRNA purification kit. Reverse transcription was carried out using AMV reverse transcriptase XL (Life Sciences) and the three two-base-anchored oligo(dT) primers (T11), GG, CG, or AA. PCR amplification was performed with the three oligo(dT) primers in combination with 24 arbitrary primers (Display Systems Biotech) in the presence of [32P]dCTP. PCR products were electrophoresed on Gene Gel Clean (Amersham Biosciences) and exposed to the imaging plate of a Fuji Bioimage analyzer BAS 2500. cDNAs were eluted from differentially displayed bands, amplified with the same primer sets described above, and cloned into a pCR2.1 vector (Invitrogen). Aliquots of 1 μg of poly (A)+RNA were denatured, electrophoretically fractionated on a 1.4% agarose/formaldehyde gel, and transferred to a nylon membrane. Hybridization was performed in the solution containing cloned cDNA labeled with [32P]dCTP using a random labeling kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Radioactivities of the bands were measured using a Fuji Bioimage analyzer BAS 2500. A 64-bp cDNA fragment obtained by the differential display method was used to screen 4 × 105 colonies from a SuperScript Rat Neuronal Cell cDNA Library (Invitrogen). The corresponding DNA was sequenced using a Taq cycle sequencing kit (Takara) with a fluorescence autosequencer ABI377. RT-PCR analysis was carried out according to the methods of Kutschera et al. (1998) (13Kutschera W. Zauner W. Wiche G. Probst F. Genomics. 1998; 49: 430-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Briefly, first-strand cDNA was synthesized from poly(A)+RNA of cultured rat neurons using SuperScript II and random hexamers (Invitrogen). PCR was carried out with ELONGase Enzyme Mix (Invitrogen). For amplification of regular transcripts of rat MAP1B, the upstream primer was nucleotides 169–190 (accession no.U52950) (14Liu D. Fischer I. Gene. 1996; 172: 307-308Crossref Scopus (10) Google Scholar), which are located in exon 1 of MAP1B. For amplification of alternative transcripts containing exon 3U (accession no. AF035827) and 3A (accession no. AF035829), the upstream primers were nucleotides −98 to −74 and −58 to −34, respectively (13Kutschera W. Zauner W. Wiche G. Probst F. Genomics. 1998; 49: 430-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The downstream primer was nucleotides 684–660, which are located in exon 5 of MAP1B (accession no. X60370) (15Zauner W. Kratz J. Staunton J. Feick P. Wiche G. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 57: 66-74PubMed Google Scholar) for all amplifications. PCR products were electrophoretically fractionated on a 1.4% agarose gel and transferred to a nylon membrane. A cDNA probe of MAP1B for Southern hybridization was obtained by RT-PCR using primers corresponding to nucleotides 191–208 (located in exon 1) and 620–602 (located in exon 5). Hybridization was performed in the solution containing cloned cDNA labeled using the [32P[dCTP random labeling kit. Full-length rat cDNA for MAP1B was generated by RT-PCR. First-strand cDNA was synthesized using SuperScript II and poly(A)+RNA from cultured rat neurons. PCR was carried out with ELONGase Enzyme Mix. Upstream primers were nucleotides 26–48, 253–274, 1404–1426, 3156–3179, 4042–4063, 5053–5080, and 6181–6204. Downstream primers were nucleotides 656–632, 1663–1641, 4161–4139, 4841–4818, 6280–6259, 7061–7036, and 7451–7428, respectively (14Liu D. Fischer I. Gene. 1996; 172: 307-308Crossref Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 15Zauner W. Kratz J. Staunton J. Feick P. Wiche G. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 57: 66-74PubMed Google Scholar). Each PCR product was cloned into pCR2.1 vector (Invitrogen). A cDNA for alternative transcripts containing exon 3U was cloned by RT-PCR using an upstream primer located in exon 3U, nucleotides −409 to −386 (13Kutschera W. Zauner W. Wiche G. Probst F. Genomics. 1998; 49: 430-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) and a downstream primer located in exon 4, nucleotides 478–458 (14Liu D. Fischer I. Gene. 1996; 172: 307-308Crossref Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 15Zauner W. Kratz J. Staunton J. Feick P. Wiche G. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 57: 66-74PubMed Google Scholar). The PCR fragment containing exon 3U was fused to the AatII site of full-length MAP1B. The nucleotide sequences of all PCR fragments were analyzed to confirm the authenticity of rat MAP1B cDNA. The full-length transcript and the alternative transcript starting from exon 3U of MAP1B were cloned into pCMV-Tag 5 containing a c-Myc epitope (Stratagene). The constructs were transfected into 6-DIV cortical neurons with LipofectAMINE 2000 according to the manufacturer's manual (Invitrogen). For re-plating experiments, cells were removed from dishes 20 h after transfection with 0.05% trypsin, washed with MEM/10% FBS three times, and seeded into 6-cm dishes precoated with gelatin-polyornithine. Re-plated cells were cultured for 6 h in MEM with 5% fetal bovine serum and 10 μm β-mercaptoethanol. For serum withdrawal experiments, the culture medium was replaced with MEN-N2 20 h after transfection, and the cells were cultured for an additional 24 h. Cells were incubated with 10 μm Hoechst 33342 in PBS (−) for 10 min, fixed with ethanol at −20 °C for 10 min, blocked with 2% skim milk for 30 min, and reacted with the primary antibodies for 1 h followed by 1 h of reaction with the secondary antibodies. The primary antibodies used were polyclonal anti-Myc-tag antibodies (MBL International) and a monoclonal anti-MAP1B antibody (AA6). Secondary antibodies were Texas Red-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Vector Laboratories) and fluorescein-conjugated anti-mouse Ig (AmershamBiosciences). Transfected cells were visualized with an Olympus epifluorescence microscope. At least 400 transfected cells were examined for each construct for measuring the neurite length. Apoptotic neurons were counted in at least 600 transfected cells for each construct and in each transfection experiment. Cells were harvested 20 h after transfection, extracted with radioimmune precipitation assay (RIPA) buffer containing 2 mm EDTA and protease inhibitors, and centrifuged 20 min at 14,000 rpm at 4 °C. Cell lysates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (a 3–10% acrylamide linear gradient gel). After the proteins were transferred to Immobilon, a Myc-tag was detected with anti-Myc-tag antibodies (MBL International) by the enhanced chemiluminescence method. The neurotoxicity of Aβ-(1–42) to rat cortical neurons was assessed by the MTT reduction or the trypan blue exclusion. A significant decrease in MTT reduction was detected after 3 h of either nonaggregated or aggregated Aβ-(1–42) treatment (p < 0.001 or p< 0.05, respectively) and continued until at least 48 h of treatment (Fig. 1 A), whereas the neuronal viability assessed by trypan blue exclusion began to decrease at 6 h of treatment with either nonaggregated or aggregated Aβ (p < 0.05) (Fig. 1 B). After the addition of nonaggregated Aβ peptide, the neuronal viability continuously decreased for at least up to 48 h; however, the decrease in neuronal viability reached a plateau at 24 h after treatment with aggregated Aβ peptide. These results indicate that the decline in metabolic activity induced in neurons by Aβ treatment occurs before the disruption of the plasma membrane and that nonaggregated Aβ is more toxic than aggregated Aβ. To identify Aβ-responsive genes by differential display RT-PCR before the disruption of the cell membrane by Aβ, we compared RNA fingerprinting patterns from neurons exposed to Aβ-(1–42) (5 μm) for 3 h with those from control neurons. Most of the bands observed in this screening using 72 primer pairs showed the same patterns in control neurons and in neurons treated with nonaggregated or aggregated Aβ. A cDNA band obtained with the primer set T11GG and upstream primer no. 13 (5′-TGGATTGGTC-3′) showed an increase in the neurons treated with either nonaggregated or aggregated Aβ (Fig. 2 A). This band contained a 64-bp cDNA (clone i132). Northern blot analysis using clone i132 as a probe confirmed the differential expression in Aβ-treated neurons (Fig. 2 B). By iterative screening of a nerve cell cDNA library using the clone i132 as a probe, a cDNA (3.572 kb) was identified as the 3′-untranslated region of MAP1B (accession no.AF115776). The MAP1B gene is transcribed into three different transcripts, i.e. a regular transcript containing exons 1–7 and two alternative transcripts containing either exon 3U or 3A and 3–7 (13Kutschera W. Zauner W. Wiche G. Probst F. Genomics. 1998; 49: 430-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). RT-PCR using 5′-specific primers located in exon 1, 3U, and 3A and a common 3′-primer located in exon 5 followed by Southern blot hybridization using a MAP1B-specific probe showed that only the transcript containing exon 3U increased in neurons treated with either nonaggregated or aggregated Aβ-(1–42) for 3 h (Fig. 3 B). Northern blot analysis confirmed the significant induction of the alternative transcript containing exon 3U in cortical neurons treated with nonaggregated or aggregated Aβ-(1–42) for 3 h (Fig. 3 C). The mRNAs of microtubule-associated proteins other than MAP1B were also analyzed by Northern blotting. However, neither τ, MAP1A, nor β-tubulin mRNA was not affected by treatment with nonaggregated or aggregated Aβ-(1–42) for 3–24 h (Fig. 3 C). MAP1B is a minor component of paired helical filaments found in Alzheimer's disease brains (16Hasegawa M. Arai T. Ihara Y. Neuron. 1990; 4: 909-918Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 17Geddes J.W. Lundgren K. Kim Y.K. J. Neurosci.

Acta Neuropathol. 1996; 91: 78-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 21Jensen P.H. Islam K. Kenney J. Nielsen M.S. Power J. Gai W.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21500-21507Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). It is not known which isoforms, full-length MAP1B or shorter isoforms (MAP1B Δ126), are involved in the formation of paired helical filaments or Lewy bodies. To investigate which isoforms of MAP1B are responsible for the degeneration of neurons, we examined the effects of overexpression of MAP1B fragments on neurite sprouting and neuronal apoptosis. Because the indistinguishable electrophoretic mobility between full-length MAP1B (MAP1B-(1–2459)) and MAP1B Δ126 (MAP1B-(127–2459)) makes it difficult to examine the expression of each MAP1B isoform in transfected neurons by Western blotting, MAP1B fragments MAP1B-(1–1367) and MAP1B-(127–1367), both of which were tagged with c-Myc epitope, were generated and expressed in 6-DIV cortical neurons. Fragments MAP1B-(1–1367) and MAP1B-(127–1367) were detectable with anti-Myc antibodies and an authentic MAP1B antibody, AA6. The expression of exogenous MAP1B proteins was confirmed by Western blotting (Fig. 4 B) and immunocytochemistry (Fig. 4, C and D) using an antibody against c-Myc. As shown, both the construct encoding amino acids 1–1367 and the one encoding 127–1367 gave rise to a protein band with a different size. Both proteins expressed in cortical neurons were larger than those deduced from the predicted amino acid sequence (152 or 138 kDa, respectively), as was full-length MAP1B (280–300 kDa in SDS-PAGE but 269 kDa deduced from the predicted amino acid sequence). Immunofluorescence double staining for c-Myc and MAP1B indicated that transfected neurons expressed both MAP1B fragments with distribution patterns similar to that of endogenous MAP1B (Fig. 4 C). The transfection efficiencies of constructs MAP1B-(1–1367) or MAP 1B-(127–1367) were 4.5% or 2.7%, respectively, indicating that the lower level of fragment MAP1B-(127–1367) expression in Western blot reflects, in part, the lower transfection efficiency of construct MAP1B-(127–1367) in cortical neurons. To examine the effect of overexpression of MAP1B fragments on neurite extension, cortical neurons transfected with constructs MAP1B-(1–1367) or MAP1B-(127–1367) were enzymatically removed from dishes, re-plated onto gelatin-polyornithine-coated dishes, and cultured for 6 h. As shown in Fig. 5 A, overexpression of fragment MAP1B-(1–1367) in cortical neurons shifted the peak of neurite length to a longer range. The average neurite lengths of MAP1B-(1–1367)-expressing (63.1 ± 1.3 μm) and MAP1B(127–1367)-expressing neurons (54.9 ± 1.0 μm) were significantly different (p < 0.0001). To examine the effect of overexpression of MAP1B fragments on neuronal apoptosis after serum withdrawal, cortical neurons expressing MAP1B-(1–1367) or MAP1B-(127–1367) and showing DNA fragmentation were visualized by immunostaining with anti-Myc antibodies and Hoechst 33342, and the percentage of apoptotic neurons relative to the total number of transfected neurons was determined. Fig. 5 B shows that the overexpression of MAP1B-(1–1367) in neurons induced a significantly higher level of apoptosis than that of MAP1B-(127–1367) or untransfection. To confirm the apoptotic properties of the MAP1B isoform containing the N-terminal 126 amino acid fragment, full-length or shorter isoforms (MAP1B Δ126), both of which were tagged with the c-Myc epitope, were expressed in 6-DIV cortical neurons, and their effects on neuronal apoptosis were assessed after serum withdrawal. Fig. 6 shows that neurons expressing full-length MAP1B were more sensitive to serum withdrawal than those expressing MAP1B Δ126 or untransfected neurons. These results indicate that overexpression of the MAP1B fragment containing the N-terminal 126 amino acids in cortical neurons may make neurons vulnerable to apoptotic signals. MAP1B is expressed abundantly in the fetal or neonatal brain (22Safaei R. Fischer I. J. Neurochem. 1989; 52: 1871-1879Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 23Schoenfeld T.A. McKerracher L.

The re-expression of developmentally regulated proteins such as MAP1B and CRMP2 (25Yoshida H. Watanabe A. Ihara Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9761-9768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) in the AD neurons may contribute to the aberrant neuritic sprouting process in the AD brain (26Arendt T. Neuroscience. 2001; 102: 723-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Two different possible explanations for this are that the aberrant sprouting may be a neuronal response to neurodegeneration or activated glial cells at the end stage of the disease or that the aberrant sprouting may be induced by the deposition of Aβ or plaque-associated molecules at an early stage before neurodegeneration. The aberrant axonal growth in the vicinity of amyloid plaques in APP-transgenic mice, which develop amyloid plaques but not neuronal loss, suggests that deposition of Aβ induces the aberrant sprouting (27Phinney A.L. Deller T. Stalder M. Calhoun M.E. Frotscher M. Sommer B. Staufenbiel M. Jucker M. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 8552-8559Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). If deposition of Aβ or plaque-associated molecules induces the aberrant sprouting before neurodegeneration, it is reasonable to speculate that Aβ or these plaque-associated molecules cause the re-expression of developmentally regulated proteins. In the present study, we demonstrated that nonaggregated or aggregated Aβ induced MAP1B mRNA, especially the alternative transcript-containing exon 3U, suggesting that Aβ may lead to re-expression of developmentally regulated MAP1B in neurons. Whether the MAP1B isoform(s) contained in neurofibrillary tangles and senile plaque neurites is/are the full-length form or the alternative isoforms still remains unknown. RT-PCR analysis of MAP1B transcripts using human brain poly(A)+RNA did not reveal which transcript was up-regulated in the AD brain because of the low quality of the postmortem poly(A)+RNA for analysis of the 5′-end of the cDNA. The next issue addressed here was whether the overexpression of developmentally regulated protein MAP1B induces degeneration of neurons. We demonstrated that overexpression of full-length MAP1B but not of the alternative MAP1B isoform (MAP1B Δ126) in cultured cortical neurons resulted in good growth of neurites and acceleration of neuronal death. It is unlikely that acceleration of neuronal death in MAP1B-overexpressing neurons is due to a high concentration of MAP1B in neurons. The exogenous MAP1B concentrations in cortical neurons transfected with different MAP1B isoforms were calculated from the transfection efficiency and level of the MAP1B protein as determined by Western blotting. The exogenous MAP1B concentration in neurons expressing fragment MAP1B-(1–1367) was 3.5-fold higher than that in neurons expressing fragment MAP1B-(127–1367). The immunofluorescence intensity of the MAP1B epitope as recognized by monoclonal antibody AA6 in neurons expressing fragment MAP1B-(1–1367) was almost similar to that in neurons expressing fragment MAP1B-(127–1367). Thus, the susceptibility of MAP1B-expressing neurons to death may be an isoform-specific feature; full-length MAP1B may promote neurite sprouting and neuronal death, but the alternative isoform may not be deleterious. In agreement with our finding that the alternative isoform of MAP1B does not accelerate neuronal death, a recent report indicated that up-regulation of the MAP1B alternative isoform in heterozygotes of MAP1B-deficient mice does not cause any overt abnormalities in the nervous system (28Gonzalez-Billault C. Demandt E. Wandosell F. Torres M. Bonaldo P. Stoykova A. Chowdhury K. Gruss P. Avila J. Sanchez M.P. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2000; 16: 408-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The isoform-specific deleteriousness of MAP1B appeared to be analogous to the expression of certain τ-isoforms in specific tauopaties (29Goedert M. Spillantini M.G. Davies S.W. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1998; 8: 619-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). However, it is not known whether overexpression of full-length MAP1B might promote neuronal death via impairing organelle transport as τ does (30Ebneth A. Godemann R. Stamer K. Illenberger S. Trinczek B. Mandelkow E. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 777-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar). As expected from the aberrant axonal sprouting before neurodegeneration in APP transgenic mice (27Phinney A.L. Deller T. Stalder M. Calhoun M.E. Frotscher M. Sommer B. Staufenbiel M. Jucker M. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 8552-8559Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), Aβ indeed induced a developmentally regulated protein, an alternative isoform of MAP1B. However, this isoform of MAP1B did not accelerate neuronal death when it was overexpressed in cultured cortical neurons. It should not be ruled out that non-Aβ components of plaque amyloid, e.g. heparan sulfate proteoglycan, apoprotein E, agrin, and CLAC-P/collagen type XXV (31Snow A.D. Mar Nochlin D. Kinata K. Kato M.

Recent reports suggested that MAP1B may play a role in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders related to cytoskeletal abnormalities. The high level of MAP1B in Lewy bodies indicates that overexpression of MAP1B might be involved in the formation of Lewy bodies (21Jensen P.H. Islam K. Kenney J. Nielsen M.S. Power J. Gai W.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21500-21507Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Mutations of gigaxonin induce giant axonal neuropathy via loss of gigaxonin-MAP1B light chain interactions (35Ding J. Liu J.-J. Kowal A.S. Nardine T. Bhattacharya P. Lee A. Yang Y. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 427-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). MAP1B, whose isoforms are not clearly defined, is up-regulated in the immediate-early phase of apoptosis in cerebellar granule neurons deprived of potassium and serum (36Chiang L.W. Grenier J.M. Ettwiller L. Jenkins L.P. Ficenec D. Martin J. Jin F. DiStefano P.S. Wood A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2814-2819Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that common cell death signal(s) among neurodegenerative disorders related to cytoskeletal abnormalities might stimulate the expression of full-length MAP1B, which might act as an effector of cell death (37Yuan J. Yankner B.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: E44-E45Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Further studies to identify molecules that induce full-length MAP1B should contribute to our understanding of the role of MAP1B in neurodegeneration. I thank S.

Modification of either the conserved N-terminal cysteines (GIRK1C53 and GIRK2C65) or the middle C-terminal cysteines (GIRK1C310 and GIRK2C321) independently inhibited GIRK1/GIRK2 heteromeric channels. With the exception of GIRK2C65, these cysteines were relatively inaccessible to large modifying reagents. The accessibility was further reduced by a mutation at the end of the second transmembrane domain that stabilized the open state of the channel. Thus it is unlikely that these cysteines line the permeation pathway of the open pore. Cysteines introduced 3 and 6 amino acids upstream of GIRK2C321 (G318C and E315C) were considerably more accessible. The effect of modification was dependent on the charge of the reagent. Modification of E315C in GIRK2 and E304C in GIRK1 by sodium (2-sulfonatoethyl) methanethiosulfonate (MTSES(−)) increased the current by ∼17-fold, whereas modification by 2-aminoethyl methanethiosulfonate hydrochloride (MTSEA(+)), abolished the current.

In contrast, polyamines and Mg2+ interact with the channel to inhibit currents by a mechanism of pore blockade (10Matsuda H. J. Physiol. 1991; 435: 83-99Google Scholar, 11Fakler B. Brandle U. Bond C.

The majority of regulators of Kir channels bind to regions within the cytoplasmic N- and C-terminal tails of the Kir subunits. Kir subunits contain two transmembrane (TM) segments with a short N terminus and a long C terminus of between 200 and 300 amino acids. Little is known of the structure of the cytoplasmic regions or of the conformational changes that occur during the process of regulation. Kir subunits assemble as tetramers, and the second TM helices line the pore and form a gate that controls ion flux (13Liu Y. Holmgren M. Jurman M.E. Yellen G.

Reuveny E. Neuron. 2001; 29: 669-680Google Scholar). For different members of the Kir family, the region of high sequence similarity extends ∼30 amino acids from TM1 into the N terminus and ∼170 amino acids from TM2 into the C terminus. The cytoplasmic regions adjacent to TM1 and TM2 have been proposed to form an intracellular vestibule of the pore (18Lu T. Zhu Y.G. Yang J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9926-9931Google Scholar). Modification of cysteines introduced into these regions of Kir2.1 inhibit channel currents, and at the E224C position the extent of inhibition was shown to be proportional to the size of the modifying reagent, suggesting that the mechanism was one of pore blockade. The Glu-224 residue in Kir2.1 and a histidine at a similar position in Kir6.2 (His-216) were also shown to affect polyamine block by electrostatic interactions, suggesting that they face the permeation pathway (19Taglialatela M. Ficker E. Wible B.A. Brown A.M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5532-5541Google Scholar, 20Yang J. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Neuron. 1995; 14: 1047-1054Google Scholar, 21Baukrowitz T. Tucker S.J. Schulte U. Benndorf K. Ruppersberg J.P. Fakler B. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 847-853Google Scholar). Positively charged residues within the proximal C terminus are also known to be important for binding phosphoinositides, and an aspartate within this region of GIRK2 and GIRK4 mediates the activation of GIRK channels by Na+(7Sui J.L. Chan K.W. Logothetis D.E. J. Gen. Physiol. 1996; 108: 381-391Google Scholar) and inhibition by eicosanoids (22Rogalski S.L. Chavkin C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14855-14860Google Scholar). The role of the highly conserved middle C-terminal region in Kir channel function is not well understood. It is also involved in binding phosphoinositides (6Cukras C.A. Jeliazkova I. Nichols C.G. J. Gen. Physiol. 2002; 119: 581-591Google Scholar, 23Soom M. Schonher R. Kubo Y. Kirsch C. Klinger R. Heinemenn S.H. FEBS Lett. 2001; 490: 49-53Google Scholar), and determinants of Gβγbinding have been identified within this region and within the proximal N and C termini (24He C. Yan X. Zhang H. Mirshahi T. Jin T. Huang A. Logothetis D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6088-6096Google Scholar). A glutamate at position 299 in Kir2.1 was shown to have a profound effect on polyamine block (25Kubo Y. Murata Y. J. Physiol. 2001; 531: 645-660Google Scholar), which suggests that this segment might also contribute to an intracellular vestibule of the pore. For Kir1.1 there is good evidence that the C terminus is folded in such a way as to bring the middle segment in close proximity to the N-terminal-TM1 border (26Schulte U. Hahn H. Wiesinger H. Ruppersberg J.P. Fakler B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34575-34579Google Scholar, 27Ruppersberg J.P. Pflugers Arch. 2000; 441: 1-11Google Scholar). Intrasubunit electrostatic interactions between the arginine at position 311, the arginine at position 41, and lysine at position 80, shift the pka value of Lys-80 by more than 3 pH units. The protonation of Lys-80 causes the movement of the N- and middle C-terminal regions with respect to one another, and the channel closes. Cysteines within these regions (Cys-49 and Cys-308) become accessible to modification when the channel closes but are inaccessible at high pH when the channel is open. The movement of the N and C termini with respect to one another may be a gating conformational change that is common to many of the Kir channels but is induced by different regulators (26Schulte U. Hahn H. Wiesinger H. Ruppersberg J.P. Fakler B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34575-34579Google Scholar, 28Trapp S. Tucker S.J. Ashcroft F.M. J. Gen. Physiol. 1998; 112: 325-332Google Scholar). The N-terminal cysteine is conserved in all of the Kir subunits, and modification of this cysteine in Kir6.2 (28Trapp S. Tucker S.J. Ashcroft F.M. J. Gen. Physiol. 1998; 112: 325-332Google Scholar), Kir1.1 (26Schulte U. Hahn H. Wiesinger H. Ruppersberg J.P. Fakler B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34575-34579Google Scholar), and Kir2.1 (18Lu T. Zhu Y.G. Yang J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9926-9931Google Scholar) has been shown to inhibit channel currents. Similar to Cys-49 in Kir1.1, the accessibility of Cys-42 in Kir6.2 is reduced in the open state. In GIRK1/GIRK4 heteromeric channels, the N-terminal cysteines were shown to mediate the redox modulation of channel currents (29Zeidner G. Sadja R. Reuveny E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35564-35570Google Scholar). Zeidner et al. (29Zeidner G. Sadja R. Reuveny E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35564-35570Google Scholar) proposed that the neighboring lysines stabilize the oxidation of these cysteines, and as a result, mixed disulfides are formed by interaction with reduced glutathione, which inhibits channel activity. The GIRK subunits also have a cysteine within the middle C terminus that is at the homologous position as Cys-308 in Kir1.1. Its involvement in regulating channel activity has not been investigated. In this study we have used sulfhydryl-modifying reagents of different charge to look at the accessibility of endogenous and engineered cysteines within the N and middle C terminus of GIRK1/GIRK2 heteromeric channel and to investigate the control of gating by these domains. We demonstrate a critical role for charge within the middle C terminus in regulating the gating of GIRK channels. A preliminary account of these findings was reported in Murrell-Lagnadoet al. (30Murrell-Lagnado R.D. Guo Y. Biophys. J. 2002; 82: 2900Google Scholar). Rat GIRK1 and GIRK2 cDNAs were subcloned into the BamHI andEcoRI site of the pBG7.2 vector (8Ho I.H. Murrell-Lagnado R.D. J. Physiol. 1999; 520: 645-651Google Scholar) and into similar sites of the pGEMHE vector. The human m2 muscarinic receptor was inserted into pBluescript KS (II)+. The point mutations to GIRK1 and GIRK2 were performed in the pBG7.2 vector using the GeneEditorTM in vitro site-directed mutagenesis system (Promega). The double (GIRK1C53V,C179S and GIRK2C65V,C190S), triple (GIRK1C53V,C179S,C231S and GIRK2C65V,C190S,C221S), and quadruple mutants (GIRK1C53V,C179S,C231S,C310V and GIRK2C65V,C190S,C221S,C321V) were generated by subcloning mutated segments using standard procedures. The sequences of all the constructs were confirmed by automated DNA sequencing. Oocytes were surgically removed from Xenopus laevis and dissociated from connective tissue as described in Ho and Murrell-Lagnado (8Ho I.H. Murrell-Lagnado R.D. J. Physiol. 1999; 520: 645-651Google Scholar). Isolated oocytes were microinjected with 50 nl of cRNAs dissolved in water. The in vitro transcription of cRNAs was performed as described previously (31Stevens E.B. Woodward R. Ho I.H. Murrell-Lagnado R. J. Physiol. 1997; 503: 547-562Google Scholar). Constructs in the pGEMHE vector were linearized with NdeI, and capped cRNAs were made using the T7 polymerase mMESSAGE mMACHINE kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). Injected oocytes were transferred to a Petri dish containing ND96 solution (mm) (96 NaCl, 2 KCl, 1.8 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, 5 HEPES, pH 7.6, with NaOH) with 10 mg/liter gentamicin (Sigma) at 18 °C for 3–6 days before recording. Two-electrode voltage clamp recordings were performed with an OC-725B amplifier (Warner Instruments Corp., Hamden, CT) as described in Ho and Murrell-Lagnado (8Ho I.H. Murrell-Lagnado R.D. J. Physiol. 1999; 520: 645-651Google Scholar). Micropipettes filled with 3 m KCl had resistances between 0.5 and 2 megohms. In the continuous recording, the oocytes were sequentially perfused with ND96 solution, high K+ solution (mm) (90 KCl, 1 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, 10 HEPES, pH 7.4, with KOH), 3 μm carbachol in high K+ solution, and 1 mm BaCl2 in high K+ solution. The holding potential was −80 mV, and records were filtered at 1 kHz. Patch clamp recordings were made using an AXOPATCH 200A amplifier (Axon Instruments) as described in Ho and Murrell-Lagnado (8Ho I.H. Murrell-Lagnado R.D. J. Physiol. 1999; 520: 645-651Google Scholar). Pipettes filled with pipette solution (mm) (96 KCl, 1 MgCl2, 1.8 CaCl2, 10 HEPES, pH 7.2, with KOH) had resistances between 0.5 and 3 megohms. The bath solution contained (mm) 96 KCl, 10 EGTA, 20 HEPES, 0.5 MgCl2, 0.2 NaF, and 0.1 Na3VO4, pH 7.2. After addition of 5 mm MgATP, the free Mg2+ concentration was calculated to be ∼2 mm. Sulfhydryl-modifying reagents dissolved in the bath solution at the desired concentration were applied to inside-out membrane patches via an RSC-160 rapid solution changer (Biologic). The reagents used were DTNB (5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) Sigma), MTS compounds (MTSET, (2-(trimethylammonium)ethl)methanethiosulfonate bromide; MTSEA, 2-aminoethyl methanethiosulfonate hydrochloride; and MTSES, sodium (2-sulfonatoethyl)methanethiosulfonate, Toronto Research Chemicals Inc., Canada), and DTT (dithiothreitol, Sigma). Currents were recorded at a holding potential of −80 mV, sampled at 5 kHz, and filtered at 1 kHz. Both 1-s and 10-s voltage ramps from −80 to + 80 mV were performed throughout the recording to check that there were no non-inwardly rectifying channels present in the patch. To determine the single-channel conductance the holding potential was varied from −80 to −120 mV. The inhibition and activation rate constants following application of the sulfhydryl-modifying reagents were obtained by fitting single-exponential curves to the data with the Levenberg-Marquardt least-squares algorithm, using Igro Pro software (version 3, Wavemetrics, Lake Oswego, OR). The percent inhibition and activation were calculated after subtracting the leak current measured at +80 mV. The values are presented as means ± S.D. Single channel data were analyzed using TAC software to determine unitary current amplitudes and open time distributions (version 2.51, SKALAR Instruments, Seattle, WA). Statistical analyses were performed with Student's unpaired t test using InStat software (version 2.01, GraphPad). Levels of statistical significance were: * =p < 0.001 and ** = p < 0.05. In inside-out membrane patches from Xenopus oocytes, GIRK1/GIRK2 channel activity was maintained by the inclusion of ATP in the bath solution, albeit at a lower level than basal cell-attached activity. Under these conditions, application of the sulfhydryl-modifying reagent, DTNB (500 μm), produced a rapid and total inhibition of channel currents, and this was reversed by application of 10 mm DTT (Fig. 1A). GIRK2 has 4 intracellular cysteines, 3 of which are conserved in GIRK1 (Fig. 1B). To identify the target cysteine mediating inhibition by DTNB these 4 cysteines in GIRK2 and the conserved 3 cysteines in GIRK1, plus an additional cysteine at position 230, were replaced (Fig. 1B). Initially we substituted either alanine or serine, however, at the N-terminal and middle C-terminal positions (C2 and C4), this profoundly inhibited basal and agonist-induced channel activity (Fig. 1C). Instead, valine substitutions were better tolerated at both positions. At the C1 position the serine substitutions dramatically increased the basal current amplitude and reduced agonist-induced currents. This was shown previously for GIRK channels (17Sadja R. Smadja K. Alagem N. Reuveny E. Neuron. 2001; 29: 669-680Google Scholar), and it was proposed that mutations at this position stabilize an open conformation that in the wild type channel is stabilized by the binding of Gβγ subunits. Single-channel records showed that the mean open time was increased ∼3-fold by this mutation (Table I) without a change in the single-channel conductance. Another cysteine previously shown to be involved in the Gβγ gating of GIRK channels is C3 in GIRK4 (32Krapivinsky G. Kennedy M.E. Nemec J. Medina I. Krapivinsky L. Clapham D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16946-16952Google Scholar). Mutating the equivalent cysteine in GIRK2 (C221S) did not impair m2 receptor-stimulation, although it did significantly reduce the amplitude of basal currents (p < 0.001). When mutations were combined to produce double (C1S,C2V), triple (C1S,C2V,C3S), and quadruple (C1S,C2V,C3S,C4V) mutant subunits, the basal currents were high because of the C1S mutation (Fig. 1C).Table IThe effect of cysteine mutations in GIRK1/GIRK2 channels on single-channel open times and on the rate of inhibition by DTNBMean open timeInhibition rate constantmsm−1S−1G1/G21.72 ± 0.01275 ± 12G1(C1S)/G2(C1S)5.6 ± 0.2ap < 0.001 andb p < 0.05 indicate where additional mutations produced a significant change in the mean value.146 ± 14ap < 0.001 andb p < 0.05 indicate where additional mutations produced a significant change in the mean value.G1(C1S,C2V)/G2(C1S,C2V)4.5 ± 0.1b4.5 ± 0.1bG1(C1S,C2V,C3S)/G2(C1S,C2V,C3S)4.3 ± 0.54.6 ± 0.7G1(C1S,C2V,C3S,C4V)/G2(C1S,C2V,C3S,C4V)4.3 ± 0.7No inhibitiona p < 0.001 andb p < 0.05 indicate where additional mutations produced a significant change in the mean value. Open table in a new tab The C1S mutation in GIRK1 and GIRK2 produced a ∼2-fold decrease in the rate of inhibition by DTNB (Table I and Fig. 2) but did not affect the extent of inhibition. However, when this mutation was combined with the C2V mutation, there was no apparent inhibition of currents following a 2-min application of 0.5 mm DTNB (Fig. 2A). We therefore conclude that inhibition by internal sulfhydryl compounds is mediated by modification of the N-terminal cysteines. The slowing of inhibition by the C1S mutation suggests that the N-terminal cysteines are less accessible when the channel is in an open rather than closed conformation. Although the double mutant (C1S,C2V) channel was not inhibited by a 2-min application of 0.5 mm DTNB, it was blocked by 10 mm DTNB in a DTT-reversible manner (Fig. 2A). Mutating the C3 cysteines had no effect on DTNB inhibition, whereas substituting valines for the C4 cysteines rendered the channel insensitive to DTNB. These results indicate that modification of the C4 cysteines can inhibit channel currents independently of the N-terminal cysteines. These middle C-terminal cysteines are, however, relatively inaccessible to DTNB. By coexpressing different combinations of mutant GIRK1 and GIRK2 subunits, we compared the cysteines in GIRK1 with those in GIRK2 in terms of their accessibility and influence on channel activity (Fig. 3). A 1-min application of DTNB (0.5 mm) completely blocked GIRK1(C1S,C2V)/GIRK2(C1S) currents but had little effect on GIRK1(C1S)/GIRK2(C1S,C2V) currents (Fig. 3A). Thus, only the GIRK2 N-terminal cysteine is readily accessible to DTNB, and its modification is sufficient for complete inhibition of the heteromeric channel activity. We tested whether the C1S mutation was substantially slowing access to either the GIRK1 C2 cysteine or the C4 cysteines by comparing the rates of inhibition of GIRK1/GIRK2(C2V) and GIRK1(C1S)/GIRK2(C1S,C2V) currents. There was a 2-fold increase in the rate constant without the C1S mutation (p < 0.001) indicating that access to these cysteines as well as the GIRK2 N-terminal cysteine is reduced when the open state is stabilized (Fig. 3B). DTNB is a relatively bulky modifying reagent, so we used smaller MTS reagents to test whether the effect of modifying the C2 and C4 cysteines was dependent upon the size or charge of the modifying reagent. We coexpressed the GIRK1 single mutant (C1S) with the GIRK2 quadruple mutant (C1S,C2V,C3S,C4V), so that only C2 and C4 in GIRK1 were potential targets. MTSEA completely abolished channel currents with a rate constant of 89 ± 2.0m−1s−1 (Fig. 3C). This effect was probably mediated via C2 because with only the GIRK1 C4 present, MTSEA produced ∼18% inhibition of the current (TableII and Fig. 3D). Similar results were obtained with the larger MTSET and the negatively charged MTSES: they completely blocked currents when C2 and C4 were present in GIRK1 but produced little or no inhibition with only C4 present (Fig. 3D and Table II). All three MTS reagents also abolished currents through the GIRK1 quadruple mutant, GIRK2 single mutant heteromer. Thus, the inhibitory effect of modifying either the GIRK1 or GIRK2 N-terminal cysteine was not dependent upon the charge of the reagent. The effect of modifying the C4 residues was, however, dependent on the charge and size of the modifying reagent. At the GIRK1 C4 residue, only modification by DTNB produced a substantial inhibition of the current (Fig. 4D). At the GIRK2 C4 residue, modification by DTNB and MTSEA completely abolished channel currents, whereas modification by MTSES produced only a 50% inhibition (p < 0.001). The nature of the C4 residue in GIRK2, therefore, has more influence on channel activity than C4 in GIRK1.Table IIInhibition mediated by modification of N- and middle C-terminal cysteines in either GIRK1 or GIRK2Percent inhibitionMTSEAMTSETMTSESDTNB%G1(C1S)/G2(C1S,C2V,C3S,C4V)100100100Not determinedG1(C1S,C2V,C3S)/G2(C1S,C2V,C3S,C4V)18 ± 2aValues differ significantly from 100% (p < 0.001).0aValues differ significantly from 100% (p < 0.001).15 ± 2aValues differ significantly from 100% (p < 0.001).51 ± 5aValues differ significantly from 100% (p < 0.001).G1(C1S,C2V,C3S,C4V)/G2(C1S)100100100Not determinedG1(C1S,C2V,C3S,C4V)/G2(C1S,C2V,C3S)10010053 ± 7aValues differ significantly from 100% (p < 0.001).100a Values differ significantly from 100% (p < 0.001). Open table in a new tab The mechanisms of inhibition mediated by the N- and middle C-terminal cysteines are unlikely to involve direct pore blockade by the modifying reagent. Three out of the four cysteines were relatively inaccessible to modification with and without the C1S mutation, and even the GIRK2 N-terminal cysteine became less accessible when the open state of the channel was stabilized by the C1S mutation. This is not consistent with the side groups of these residues lining the permeation pathway of the open pore. Therefore the effects must be on the gating mechanism of the channel. To further investigate the involvement of the middle C-terminal region in regulating channel gating we introduced cysteines upstream and downstream of the C4 position (Cys-321) in the quadruple mutant GIRK2. These were coexpressed with the GIRK1 quadruple mutant subunit. Substituting cysteine for Arg-324 in GIRK2 had little effect on the basal or carbachol-induced whole cell currents (p > 0.05) (Fig. 4A) and did not confer sensitivity to DTNB (10 mm), suggesting that this residue is not involved in the gating of the channel. By contrast, substituting cysteine for Tyr-327 abolished functional expression of the heteromer (Fig. 4A). Three and six residues upstream of C4 the G318C and the E315C mutations did not significantly alter either basal or carbachol-induced whole cell currents (p > 0.05) (Fig. 4A). However, modification of either residue by MTSEA caused complete inhibition of channel currents with rate constants between 4- and 6-fold faster than for Cys-321 (p < 0.001) (Fig. 4B). The larger reagent MTSET inhibited the E315C mutant with a rate >10-fold faster than for Cys-321 (p < 0.001) (Fig. 4B). Therefore, the side groups at the 315 and 318 positions are considerably more accessible than the side group at the 321 position. At G318C, the negatively charged MTSES also inhibited channel currents (Fig. 4B), but at the E315C residue MTSES had the opposite effect to that of MTSEA and caused a 2-fold activation of channel currents (Fig. 4, C and D). We substituted cysteine for the equivalent glutamate in the quadruple mutant GIRK1 (E304) and observed a similar effect: ∼2-fold potentiation of the current by MTSES, although neither MTSEA nor MTSET caused an inhibition (Fig. 4C). When the GIRK1 E304C mutant was coexpressed with the GIRK2 E315C mutant, there was a substantial reduction in the amplitude of the whole cell currents compared with the wild type channel (Fig. 4A) (p < 0.001). In this case, application of MTSES increased the current by ∼17-fold, whereas MTSEA and MTSET caused complete inhibition. Thus, it appears that the loss of all negatively charged groups at this position within the heteromeric complex has a dramatic inhibitory effect on the current. Neutralization of two out of four residues can be tolerated and so can positive charge at the GIRK1 Glu-304 position, although not at the GIRK2 Glu-315 position. MTSES not only increased the inward current, it also reduced the extent of channel rectification, as shown by ramping the voltage from −80 to +80 mV (Fig. 4C). To determine whether the effect of charge at the 304/315 position was on single-channel conductance or on the gating of the channel, we compared single-channel currents of the quadruple mutant channel and the E304C/E315C mutant channel before and after modification by MTSES (Fig. 5). Neither the mutation nor MTSES modification altered the single-channel conductance. The most obvious effect of applying MTSES was an increase in the open probability of the channel that was caused by an increase in the frequency of openings. The duration of the individual openings, however, did not increase, and there were more individual brief openings that were not fully resolved. Within the cytoplasmic regions of GIRK channel subunits there are three conserved cysteines (C1, C2, and C4). Although they are widely dispersed within the polypeptide sequence, all three have an important role in the gating of the channel. Substitutions at C1 dramatically potentiated the basal activity of the channel, whereas substitutions at C2 and C4 inhibited channel activity. Modification of C2 and C4 by sulfhydryl reagents was also found to have a profound inhibitory effect on channel currents. From the rate of inhibition it is apparent that access to the C4 cysteines and the C2 cysteine in GIRK1 for the relatively bulky DTNB is restricted, whereas C2 in GIRK2 is more exposed. The accessibility was state-dependent and decreased when the open state of the channel was stabilized by mutating the cysteine at the end of TM2 (C1S). The restricted accessibility of these cysteines is not consistent with them lining the permeation pathway of an inner vestibule of the open pore. Also, the dramatic decrease in channel function when either the C2 or C4 cysteines were mutated to alanine suggests that the side groups are buried in the open conformation rather than projecting into a water-filled vestibule. Therefore the mechanism of inhibition by the modifying reagents is unlikely to be one of direct pore blockade. Instead we favor an allosteric mechanism by which modification destabilizes the open state of the channel. Immediately upstream of C4 the cysteines introduced into GIRK2 at positions 318 and 315 were considerably more accessible than C4 itself. The rapid modification of Cys-318 and Cys-315 by the positively charged MTSEA produced complete inhibition of channel currents. In contrast, modification of Cys-315 by the negative MTSES caused a rapid activation of channel currents. Thus, a switch in charge at this single position within the middle of the GIRK2 C terminus appears to be sufficient to gate the channel open or closed. Both GIRK1 and GIRK2 have a glutamate at the 304/315 position, and when the GIRK1 E304C and GIRK2 E315C mutants were coexpressed, the functional expression was extremely low, thus indicating the important regulatory role of the endogenous acidic residue. Single channel records indicate that negative charge at this position does not affect the single-channel conductance but rather increases the open probability of the channel. The open state was stabilized when only two out of four subunits had a glutamate at this position. Individually the E304C and E315C mutations had little effect on the amplitude of the whole cell currents, and modification by MTSES produced a modest 2-fold enhancement in the current compared with the 17-fold increase when both glutamates were mutated to cysteine. This glutamate is conserved in all members of the Kir family. A mutation of this glutamate to lysine in Kir2.1 has been identified as one of the mutations responsible for Andersen's syndrome in humans (33Plaster N.M. Tawil R. Tristani-Firouzi M. Canun S. Bendahhou S. Tsunoda A. Donaldson M.R. Iannaccone S.T. Brunt E. Barohn R. Clark J. Deymeer F. George Jr., A.L. Fish F.A. Hahn A. Nitu A. Ozdemir C. Serdaroglu P. Subramony S.H. Wolfe G. Fu Y.H. Ptacek L.J. Cell. 2001; 105: 511-519Google Scholar) and has been shown to dramatically reduce Kir2.1 currents (34Preisig-Muller R. Schlichthorl G. Goerge T. Heinen S. Bruggemann A. Rajan S. Derst C. Veh R.W. Daut J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7774-7779Google Scholar). In a recent study by Chen et al. (35Chen L. Kawano T. Bajic S. Kaziro Y. Itoh H. Art J.J. Nakajima Y. Nakajima S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 8430-8435Google Scholar), they showed that mutating this conserved glutamate in GIRK1 and GIRK2 to alanine substantially reduced the amplitude of the whole cell currents but did not affect single-channel conductance. The conserved role of this glutamate in G-protein-sensitive and -insensitive channels suggests that this residue is of fundamental importance in the gating of all inward rectifiers. The effects of cysteine modification at this position are therefore unlikely to involve a change in the interaction between GIRKs and G-proteins. All members of the Kir family are activated by phosphoinositides and three independent sites within the C terminus of Kir2.1 were identified as binding PIP2-containing liposomes (23Soom M. Schonher R. Kubo Y. Kirsch C. Klinger R. Heinemenn S.H. FEBS Lett. 2001; 490: 49-53Google Scholar). This included regions upstream and downstream of the equivalent region that we have mutated around C4. Cukras et al. (6Cukras C.A. Jeliazkova I. Nichols C.G. J. Gen. Physiol. 2002; 119: 581-591Google Scholar) used a different membrane association assay to identify a region from 170 to 320 in Kir6.2 as the essential core of the lipid-interacting domain. Based on predictions of the secondary structure of this region they proposed that the segment from Asp-306 to Phe-315 formed a conserved alpha helix. Mutations on one face of this putative helix abolished channel activity and reduced the membrane association of the C-terminal fragments. The equivalent region in Kir3.2 extends from Thr-329 to Phe-339, whereas the region that we mutated from Glu-315 to Tyr-327 is immediately upstream of this putative helix and downstream of a putative beta strand. It is unlikely that the mutations or modifications that we made involved residues that directly interact with phospholipids. Negative charge would be expected to reduce rather than promote the binding of PIP2. One possibility is that the structure of the nearby PIP2 binding regions was disrupted by the modifications. Our preferred hypothesis, however, is that the region around C4 of GIRKs is important for coupling the binding of phospholipids to stabilization of the open state of the channel. The mechanism for pH-dependent gating of Kir1.1 appears to involve a close association between the N and middle C terminus when the channel is open that is disrupted when the channel closes (26Schulte U. Hahn H. Wiesinger H. Ruppersberg J.P. Fakler B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34575-34579Google Scholar, 27Ruppersberg J.P. Pflugers Arch. 2000; 441: 1-11Google Scholar). The decrease in the accessibility of C2 and C4 in GIRKs when the channel open state is stabilized by the C1S mutation is similar to what was reported for the conserved cysteines (Cys-49 and Cys-308) in Kir1.1. For Kir1.1, modification of these cysteines by DTNB required the channel to be closed at low pH (26Schulte U. Hahn H. Wiesinger H. Ruppersberg J.P. Fakler B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34575-34579Google Scholar). In Kir6.2, Jones et al. (36Jones P.A. Tucker S.J. Ashcroft F.M. FEBS Lett. 2001; 508: 85-89Google Scholar) identified three segments within the C terminus that interact with the N terminus. One of these was from 279–323, which includes the region homologous to the middle C-terminal segment that we mutated in the GIRK subunits. One possibility is that the proximal N terminus and middle C terminus of Kirs contribute to a gating ring just inside the cytoplasm similar to what has recently been shown for the Ca2+-activated K+ channel MthK (37Jiang Y. Lee A. Chen J. Cadene M. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. Nature. 2002; 417: 523-526Google Scholar, 38Jiang Y. Lee A. Chen J. Cadene M. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. Nature. 2002; 417: 515-522Google Scholar). In MthK there is a structural domain within the C terminus called the RCK domain that is important for gating. Eight of these domains form a gating ring, and Ca2+ ions bind between adjacent domains causing a reshaping of the interfaces between these domains, thereby exerting a force on the pore-lining helices that opens the pore. By analogy we propose that modification of the charge at the 304/315 position gates the channel by an allosteric mechanism involving a change in the relative orientations of the N- and middle C-terminal segments of the subunits.

Schmidt B. Wachter E. Weiss H. Neupert W. Cell. 1986; 47: 939-951Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). During import and assembly into the bc 1complex a presequence is cleaved from the iron-sulfur protein precursor, and a [2Fe-2S] cluster is inserted into the protein. InNeurospora crassa and Saccharomyces cerevisiaethe presequence is removed in two steps, whereas in mammals the presequence is cleaved in a single step and retained as a subunit in the bc 1 complex (2Brandt U., Yu, L, Yu, C.A. Trumpower B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8387-8390Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). InSchizosaccharomcyes pombe processing of the iron-sulfur protein precursor also occurs in one step but can be converted to two step processing by changing a proline in the presequence to a serine (3Nett J.H. Schägger H. Trumpower B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8652-8658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The two step processing of the iron-sulfur protein precursor that occurs in S. cerevisiae is not essential for import and assembly of functionally active iron-sulfur protein into thebc 1 complex because mutated forms of the iron-sulfur protein that are processed to mature size in a single step are properly assembled into the bc 1 complex and are functional (4Nett J.H. Denke E. Trumpower B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 274: 2212-2217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (23) Google Scholar). We previously investigated the relationship between assembly of the apoprotein into the bc 1 complex and insertion of the [2Fe-2S] cluster in S. cerevisiae. We showed that the apoprotein can be assembled into the bc 1 complex if the cluster is not inserted (5Graham L.A. Trumpower B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22485-22492Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which suggests that the [2Fe-2S] cluster is added after the apoprotein is assembled into thebc 1 complex. We also showed that if processing of intermediate to mature size iron-sulfur protein is blocked by mutations in the presequence, the intermediate size iron-sulfur protein accumulates in the bc 1 complex and is functionally active (6Nett J.H. Trumpower B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9253-9257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). This result establishes that the second protease-processing step takes place after intermediate size iron-sulfur protein has been assembled into thebc 1 complex and that the [2Fe-2S] cluster is inserted into the apoprotein before the second protease-processing step, although it does not establish that this sequence of events is obligatory. We have now characterized the cytochrome bc 1complex from a yeast mutant in which the [2Fe-2S] cluster is not inserted into the Rieske iron-sulfur protein due to a mutation of a serine that forms a hydrogen bond to the iron-sulfur cluster to a cysteine. We show that although the protein lacking the iron-sulfur cluster is assembled into the bc 1 complex and processed to mature size, it is structurally abnormal, as evidenced by susceptibility to protease degradation. In addition, failure to insert the [2Fe-2S] cluster impairs both center P and center N. These results are discussed in relation to how insertion of the iron-sulfur cluster affects assembly of the Rieske protein into thebc 1 complex and the structure of thebc 1 dimer.

Chem. 1991; 266: 22485-22492Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The stained gels were scanned, and the intensities of the signal were quantified using a UMAX scanner and the NIH Image software. Each of the inhibitors was diluted in ethanol, and the concentration was determined from optical spectra obtained in an Aminco DW2aTMUV/Visible spectrophotometer with the OLIS DW2 conversion and OLIS software. The difference spectrum, after subtracting the ethanol background, was recorded from 250–400 nm. To accurately determine the concentration for each inhibitor, the absorbance was measured at concentrations that yielded 0.1–0.15 absorbance units after diluting stock solutions of the inhibitors. To minimize random dilution errors, each dilution was performed 5 or 6 times, and the diluted solutions were combined. The extinction coefficients used to calculate the concentrations of the stock solutions were, for antimycin, 4.8 mm−1cm−1 at 320 nm, for stigmatellin, 65.5 mm−1cm−1 at 267 nm, and for myxothiazol, 10.5 mm−1cm−1 at 313 nm (13von Jagow G. Link T.A. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 126: 253-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). All of the inhibitor dilutions were prepared daily, and the concentrations were determined before a titration was started. Pre-steady state reduction of cytochrome b was followed at room temperature by stopped flow rapid scanning spectroscopy using the OLIS Rapid Scanning Monochromator (On-Line Instrument Systems, Inc., Bogart, GA). The spectrophotometer was equipped with a 1200 lines/nm grating blazed at 500 nm. This produced a 75-nm spectrum, centered at 550 nm, with a resolution of 0.4 nm. The dead time of the instrument was 2 ms, and the end of this period was chosen as time zero. Data was collected at 1000 scans/s. The rationale for this pre-steady state kinetics method was discussed previously (14Snyder C.H. Trumpower B.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1365: 125-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Reactions were started by rapid mixing of 3 μm bc 1 complex in assay buffer containing 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 6.0, 250 mm sucrose, 1 mm sodium azide, 0.2 mm EDTA, and 0.01% Tween 20 against an equal volume of the same buffer containing 50 μm menaquinol. A fresh solution of menaquinol substrate was prepared from menaquinone before each experiment as described previously (8Snyder C.H. Trumpower B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31209-31216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The bc 1 complex was diluted shortly before each titration. The exact bc 1concentration was determined by difference spectra recorded in the Aminco DW2aTM spectrophotometer. The cytochromec 1 concentration was determined from the difference spectrum of the ascorbate-reduced versusferricyanide-oxidized enzyme, using an extinction coefficient of 17.5 mm−1cm−1 at 553–548 nm (15Cavazzoni M. Svobodova J. Desantis A. Fato R. Lenaz G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 303: 246-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Cytochrome b concentration was determined from the difference spectrum of the dithionite-reduced versusferricyanide-oxidized enzyme, using an extinction coefficient of 25 mm−1cm−1 at 563–578 nm (15Cavazzoni M. Svobodova J. Desantis A. Fato R. Lenaz G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 303: 246-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). To determine the rate constants for reduction of cytochrome bthrough center N, the bc 1 complex from the wild-type yeast was mixed with a 2-fold excess of stigmatellin to block the reaction through center P. It was not necessary to include stigmatellin with the bc 1 complex from the CHS14 mutant because the absence of iron-sulfur cluster prevents reduction of cytochrome b through center P. To determine the titer for inhibition of the reduction of cytochromeb with antimycin, the antimycin was incubated with the enzyme 2 min before starting the reaction. An oxidized spectrum was obtained by mixing the oxidized bc 1 complex against assay buffer and averaging the data sets to a single scan. For each inhibitor concentration, three data sets were averaged, and the oxidized spectrum was subtracted from each scan. From the three-dimensional data set comprised of wavelength, absorbance, and time, the time course and amplitude change for cytochrome breduction at 563 nm was extracted using the OLIS software. The bc 1 complex was diluted to an approximate concentration of 3 μm in assay buffer (pH 7.0), and the exact concentration was determined as described above. A baseline was obtained by reducing the bc 1complex with dithionite in both sample and reference cuvettes in the Aminco DW2aTM spectrophotometer. Increasing amounts of antimycin were added to the sample cuvette and an equal amount of ethanol to the reference cuvette. After allowing the inhibitor to equilibrate with the enzyme for 2 min, a difference spectrum was recorded for each concentration of inhibitor added. For each inhibitor concentration the absorbance difference at 565–558 nm was determined. The same procedure was used to measure the red shift induced by myxothiazol binding, except the absorbance difference at 564–559 nm was determined. Binding of antimycin to the wild-type and CHS14 mutantbc 1 complexes was measured by the quenching of antimycin fluorescence. The method was essentially as described by Berden and Slater (16Berden J.A. Slater E.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1972; 256: 199-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Briefly, a sample of W303 or CHS14bc 1 complex was diluted to an approximate concentration of 2 μm in assay buffer at pH 7.0, and the exact concentration was determined in the Aminco DW2aTMspectrophotometer as described above. Antimycin fluorescence was measured with a Hitachi fluorescence spectrophotometer model F-3010 equipped with a 150 W xenon lamp using an excitation wavelength of 332 nm and an emission wavelength of 454 nm. Quartz cells of 10 nm light path for excitation and 5 nm light path for emission were used. The time average was set at 10 s for each reading, and the machine response was 2 s. Increasing amounts of antimycin were added to the bc 1 complex and incubated at room temperature for 2 min before measurement. Fluorescence by increasing amounts of antimycin in the absence of bc 1complex was measured as a control for each titration. The yeast bc 1complex was recently crystallized, and its three-dimensional structure has been determined (17Hunte C. Koepke J. Lange C. Rossmanith T. Michel H. Structure. 2000; 8: 669-684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar). The crystal structure showed that the yeastbc 1 complex is a dimer, as was previously shown for the beef and the chicken enzymes (18Xia D., Yu, C.A. Kim H. Xia J.Z. Kachurin A.M. Zhang L., Yu, L. Deisenhofer J. Science. 1997; 277: 60-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (876) Google Scholar, 19Iwata S. Lee J.W. Okada K. Lee J.K. Iwata M. Rasmussen B. Link T.A. Ramaswamy S. Jap B.K.

Nature. 1998; 392: 677-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (943) Google Scholar). In the dimer the two copies of the Rieske iron-sulfur protein are intertwined and oriented in a trans manner with respect to each monomer as shown in Fig. 1 A. The head domain of the iron-sulfur protein comes in close contact with hemeb L of cytochrome b and cytochromec 1 of one monomer, whereas the N-terminal and transmembrane domains of the protein are anchored in the other monomer, close to heme b H. Confirmation of an intertwined dimer in solution was provided when a stable bc 1complex from Rhodobacter sphaeroides was generated carrying two intersubunit disulfide bonds, one between the head domain of the iron-sulfur protein and cytochrome b and the other between the tail domain of the iron-sulfur protein and cytochrome b(21Xiao K. Chandrasekaran A., Yu, L. Yu C-A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46125-46131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The iron-sulfur protein molecule contains three domains, an extrinsic domain consisting of residues 93–215, a linker region consisting of residues 81–92, and a transmembrane domain consisting of residues 51–80. The extrinsic domain carries the iron-sulfur cluster and forms, together with a domain in cytochrome b proximal to hemeb L, the ubiquinol oxidizing pocket, center P (17Hunte C. Koepke J. Lange C. Rossmanith T. Michel H. Structure. 2000; 8: 669-684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar, 20Zhang Z. Huang L. Schulmeister V.M. Chi Y-I. Kim K-K. Hung L-W. Crofts A.R.

Chem. 1991; 266: 19958-19964Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The transmembrane region of the iron-sulfur protein is an alpha helix, as shown in Fig. 1 A. The tail of the transmembrane region comes within 20 Å of the quinone reducing center N. This is the region where ubiquinone closely interacts with heme b H of cytochrome b, indicated by the arrow pointing to the ubiquinone head-group in Fig. 1 A. The transmembrane domain of the iron-sulfur protein is in close contact with helix E of cytochrome b, which abuts heme b H at center N. Three layers of antiparallel β-strands surround the [2Fe-2S] cluster, which is coordinated by His-161, His-181, Cys-159, and Cys-178 as shown in Fig. 1 B. A hydrogen bond network to the iron-sulfur cluster includes Ser-183 and Tyr-185, located in the β7 strand. These two residues are conserved in all Rieske iron-sulfur proteins that oxidize ubiquinol. The hydroxyl group of Ser-183 is hydrogen-bonded to S1 at a distance of 3.2 Å. In a previous study (9Denke E. Merbitz-Zahradnik T. Hatzfeld O.M. Snyder C. Link T.A. Trumpower B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9085-9093Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) we characterized mutations in Ser-183 that altered the cytochrome c reductase activity of thebc 1 complex due to changes in the midpoint potential of the iron-sulfur protein. An S183T mutation that weakened the hydrogen bond from Ser-183 to the iron-sulfur cluster dropped the midpoint potential by 26 mV and caused a 20% loss of activity. An S183A mutation that eliminated the hydrogen bond dropped the midpoint potential of the iron-sulfur protein from +285 mV to +150 mV and caused a 90% loss of activity. We also noted that when Ser-183 was replaced with Cys the resulting yeast were petite and the mitochondrial membranes had no bc 1 complex activity (6Nett J.H. Trumpower B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9253-9257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 9Denke E. Merbitz-Zahradnik T. Hatzfeld O.M. Snyder C. Link T.A. Trumpower B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9085-9093Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). However, we did not investigate the basis for loss ofbc 1 complex activity. We thus proceeded to further characterize the bc 1 complex from the respiratory-deficient yeast carrying the S183C mutation in the Rieske iron-sulfur protein. We first examined the iron-sulfur cluster in the isolated bc 1 complex from the CHS14 yeast mutant carrying the S183C mutation in the Rieske protein and compared it with that from a wild-typebc 1 complex. In the reduced state thebc 1 complex from wild-type yeast shows a negative CD band at 500 nm, which is free of interfering signals as shown in Fig. 2 A. Thebc 1 complex from the CHS14 mutant lacks the 500 nm band (Fig. 2 B), indicating that the cluster is absent and therefore explaining the absence of bc 1 complex activity in the mutant (6Nett J.H. Trumpower B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9253-9257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 9Denke E. Merbitz-Zahradnik T. Hatzfeld O.M. Snyder C. Link T.A. Trumpower B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9085-9093Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Because the 500-nm CD band characteristic of the iron-sulfur cluster was not detectable, no attempt was made to characterize the cluster by EPR spectroscopy. We previously observed that mutations in the highly conserved cysteines and histidines that ligate the cluster cause loss of the iron-sulfur cluster and very low amounts of the apoprotein present in thebc 1 complexes from those mutants (5Graham L.A. Trumpower B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22485-22492Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To check for loss of the iron-sulfur apoprotein from thebc 1 complex in the CHS14 mutant, we performed a Western blot analysis to compare the amounts of apoprotein in mitochondrial membranes and isolated enzyme. The top panelin Fig. 3 shows the Western blot analysis of wild-type and CHS14 membranes and pure bc 1complexes, and the lower panel shows the quantification of the scans. The amount of cytochrome c 1 in each sample was arbitrarily set at 100%, and the amount of iron-sulfur protein relative to cytochrome c 1 was calculated from the densitometry scan. The amount of iron-sulfur protein relative to cytochrome c 1 in the purifiedbc 1 complex from the CHS14 mutant is 83% of that in the wild-type bc 1 complex, if the enzyme is isolated in the presence of the protease inhibitor DFP (Fig. 3). This indicates that the apoprotein is assembled into both halves of thebc 1 dimer but somewhat more readily lost from the enzyme if the iron-sulfur cluster is absent. Lack of iron-sulfur cluster does not affect processing of the protein to mature size by the mitochondrial processing peptidases because there is no accumulation of intermediate-ISP in the membranes or in the isolated enzyme from the CHS14 mutant. This contrasts with mutants where amino acids in the presequence that are recognized by mitochondrial processing peptidases have been mutated (11Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). Although the iron-sulfur protein is assembled into thebc 1 complex and processed to mature size in the CHS14 mutant, it is more sensitive to proteolysis than the iron-sulfur protein in the membranes from the wild-type yeast if protease inhibitor is omitted. When membranes were isolated from the wild-type yeast without DFP there is a small, but detectable, amount of proteolysis of the iron-sulfur protein in the membranes (Fig. 3). Consequently, the amounts of iron-sulfur protein relative to cytochromec 1 in membranes isolated from the wild-type yeast in the presence or absence of DFP are essentially identical (+5%). If DFP is omitted during isolation of mitochondrial membranes from the CHS14 mutant, there is extensive proteolysis of the iron-sulfur protein as shown by the appearance of proteolytic degradation products as lower molecular weight bands. Consequently, the amount of iron-sulfur protein in membranes from the CHS14 mutant is only 58% as much in the wild-type membranes. By a similar Western blot analysis we observed that the proteolytic degradation products were lost when thebc 1 complex was purified from these membranes (results not shown). As mentioned above, the residue mutated in the CHS14 mutant, Ser-183, has been changed to Thr, Ala, and Cys (9Denke E. Merbitz-Zahradnik T. Hatzfeld O.M. Snyder C. Link T.A. Trumpower B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9085-9093Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The first two mutations caused a change in the iron-sulfur protein redox potential, but the protein remained in normal amounts and retained the cluster. It seems that the Ser-183 hydroxyl group is not essential for the formation of the cluster, as evidenced by the presence of the cluster in the S183A form of the protein. Although the S183C mutation caused the loss of the cluster, the apoprotein is stable if protected from proteolysis. Therefore, it appears that an additional Cys residue interferes with insertion of the [2Fe-2S] cluster, but it can stabilize the extrinsic domain and therefore the protein, possibly by forming a disulfide bridge with Cys-159 or Cys-178 in this region (see Fig. 1 B). Modeling of the S183C mutation indicates that the sulfur of the introduced Cys-183 is 4.15 Å from the sulfur of Cys-159 and 3.16 Å from the sulfur of Cys-178. Lack of the 500-nm signal in the CD spectrum of the mutantbc 1 complex (Fig. 2) shows conclusively that the iron-sulfur cluster is lost, whereas the Western blots (Fig. 3) show that the apoprotein remains in the membranes and in the purified enzyme. We thus decided to further characterize center P and center N in the purified enzyme to understand what effects the S183C mutation has on the structure of the bc 1 complex. As expected, there was no reduction of cytochrome b or cytochrome c 1 via center P due to the absence of the iron-sulfur cluster (results not shown). There is also a change in the structure of center P, as indicated by a change in binding of myxothiazol to the bc 1 complex from the CHS14 mutant. Myxothiazol was shown to bind at center P of the bovinebc 1 complex with a stoichiometry of one myxothiazol per bc 1 monomer and to cause a red shift in the optical spectrum of cytochrome b L(13von Jagow G. Link T.A. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 126: 253-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar, 23von Jagow G. Engel W.D. FEBS Letts. 1981; 136: 19-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 24von Jagow G. Ljungdahl P.O. Graf P. Ohnishi T. Trumpower B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 6318-6326Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A binding stoichiometry of one myxothiazol perbc 1 monomer was similarly demonstrated for the yeast bc 1 complex by titrating the myxothiazol-induced shift in the cytochrome b optical spectrum (25Gutierrez-Cirlos E.B. Trumpower B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1195-1202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). We thus used the shift in the cytochrome b optical spectrum induced by myxothiazol binding to probe the structure of center P in the bc 1 complex from the CHS14 mutant. As can be seen in Fig. 4, whereas a binding stoichiometry of one myxothiazol per bc 1 monomer was observed with the enzyme from the wild-type yeast, the stoichiometry with the enzyme from the CHS14 mutant was only 0.5 perbc 1 monomer. This result was unexpected because it has been shown that binding of similar methoxyacrylates is unaffected when the Rieske protein is extracted from the bovinebc 1 complex (22Brandt U. Haase U. Shägger H. von Jagow G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19958-19964Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This suggests that failure to insert the iron-sulfur cluster alters the structure of center P. To see if the S183C mutation had an effect on center N of the bc 1complex, we examined the rates of cytochrome b reduction through center N in the CHS14 bc 1 complex as a function of menaquinol concentration. As can be seen in Fig. 5, the second order rate constant for cytochrome b reduction in the wild-typebc1 complex decreased from 5.3 × 105m−1s−1 to 2.2 × 105m−1s−1 as the concentration of menaquinol increased. In the bc 1 complex from the CHS14 mutant the second order rate constant decreased from 5.4 × 105m−1s−1 to 1.64 × 105m−1s−1. From these results we conclude that the rate of electron transfer through center N is not significantly changed by the absence of iron-sulfur cluster. Although the rate constant is slightly smaller at higher menaquinol concentrations in the bc 1 complex from the CHS14 mutant than in the wild-type enzyme, we consider this change insignificant in view of the limited number of data points. Although the rate of cytochrome b reduction is the same in the bc 1 complexes from the wild-type and CHS14 mutant, the amount of cytochrome b that is reducible through center N is significantly decreased in the mutant. Fig. 6 shows spectra of thebc 1 complexes after reduction with 25 μm menaquinol and dithionite. Stigmatellin was included with the wild-type bc 1 complex to prevent reduction through center P in that enzyme. In thebc 1 complex from the wild-type yeast menaquinol reduced 59% of the dithionite-reducible cytochrome b. In contrast, menaquinol reduced only 37% of the dithionite-reducible cytochrome b in the CHS14 bc 1complex. This difference remained constant when using higher concentrations of menaquinol. For example, 61 and 41% of the dithionite-reducible cytochrome b were reduced with 75 μm menaquinol in the wild-type and mutantbc 1 complexes, respectively (data not shown). Notably, there is no damage to the cytochrome b in the CHS14 mutant bc 1 complex. The spectrum of the dithionite-reduced bc 1 complex shows the same absorption maximum and the same 2:1 ratio ofb:c 1 for the wild-type and mutantbc 1 complexes. To further characterize center N in the mutant, we titrated the pre-steady state reduction of cytochrome b with antimycin as described previously (14Snyder C.H. Trumpower B.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1365: 125-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 25Gutierrez-Cirlos E.B. Trumpower B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1195-1202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In this assay,bc 1 complex was pre-mixed with antimycin and then reduced with 25 μm menaquinol. To block reduction of cytochrome b through center P in the wild-typebc1 complex, the enzyme was mixed with stigmatellin. As shown in Fig. 7, reduction of cytochrome b through center N is inhibited by antimycin. With bc 1 complex from wild-type yeast the stoichiometry is 1:1, but with the enzyme from the CHS14 mutant the stoichiometry is 0.5 antimycin per bc 1monomer. Antimycin causes a red shift in the alpha band of the cytochromeb spectrum upon binding to reducedbc 1 complex (13von Jagow G. Link T.A. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 126: 253-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). To further evaluate the titer for antimycin binding we titrated the antimycin-induced red shift in the spectrum of the CHS14 bc 1 complex and compared it the red shift of a wild-type bc 1complex as shown in Fig. 8. As antimycin is titrated into the wild-type bc 1 complex the absorbance change increases until a stoichiometry of one antimycin perbc 1 complex is obtained, after which there is very little absorbance change upon further additions of the inhibitor. In contrast, the titration of antimycin into the CHS14bc 1 complex is biphasic. The absorbance increases incrementally until 0.5 equivalents of antimycin perbc 1 complex are added, and then there is a more gradual increment in absorbance as additional antimycin is added. These results indicate that antimycin binds with equal affinity to both center N sites in the dimeric bc 1 complex from the wild-type yeast but that it binds with significantly different affinities to the two sites in the bc 1 complex from the CHS14 mutant. We also used the quenching of antimycin fluorescence to examine the binding stoichiometry. Upon binding to the bc 1complex antimycin fluorescence is quenched, and when the enzyme becomes saturated further addition of antimycin results in incremental increases in fluorescence. This allows the binding to be measured under conditions where the b hemes are oxidized. As shown in Fig. 9, quenching of the antimycin fluorescence is saturated in the wild-type bc 1complex when the stoichiometry of binding reaches a value close to one equivalent of antimycin per bc 1 monomer, in agreement with the results previously obtained by this method (16Berden J.A. Slater E.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1972; 256: 199-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The titer for quenching of antimycin fluorescence in thebc 1 complex from the CHS14 mutant indicated a high affinity binding site that becomes saturated at 0.5 equivalents per bc 1 complex, thus confirming the results from titration of the red shift in the optical spectrum. A second, lower affinity binding site is not obvious from the fluorescence quenching titration, but it is possible that it is not revealed in this titration due to the limited number of data points. The striking finding from our results is that failure to insert the [2Fe-2S] cluster into the Rieske iron-sulfur affects the structure of center N, which is on the opposite side of the membrane from the extrinsic domain where the cluster is located. Although the head domain of the Rieske protein and center N are located on opposite sides of the mitochondrial membrane, there is genetic evidence for interaction between these two sites. In Rhodobacter capsulatus a series of revertants were isolated from mutations at Leu-136 of the Rhodobacter iron-sulfur protein, equivalent to Ile-167 in the yeast protein, which is located within 8.5 Å of the iron-sulfur cluster in the head domain of the Rieske protein (26Brasseur G. Sled V. Liebl U. Ohnishi T. Daldal F. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11685-11696Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Some of the revertants were compensatory mutations located on residues 44 or 46 of the N-terminal domain of the Rhodobacter protein, near center N. This indicates a structural interaction between the head domain of the Rieske protein and center N across the bacterial membrane. Single mutations generated on the latter two amino acids in the absence of the mutation on residue 136 were without phenotype as regards photosynthetic growth, inhibitor sensitivity, and EPR spectra, but the redox potential of the iron-sulfur cluster increased from 312 to 385 mV. This demonstrates that a structural change in the N-terminal domain of the Rieske protein can effect the properties of the iron-sulfur cluster. By various criteria we found that 50% of thebc 1 complex was damaged at center P and center N. Because the bc 1 complex is a dimer this could indicate that 50% of the enzyme is damaged or that one monomer in all of the dimers is damaged. If the entire enzyme dimer were damaged, one would expect the extent of inactive enzyme to vary in multiple preparations. The fact that the titer for inhibitors was consistently diminished to one per dimer in multiple preparations of enzyme suggests that one monomer in all of the dimers is damaged. The S183C mutation alters the binding of ligands at both centers P and N. The stoichiometry of myxothiazol binding in thebc 1 complex from the mutant indicates that center P can bind only one inhibitor per dimer. Whereas deletion of the gene for the Rieske iron-sulfur protein causes a decrease in the alpha band of cytochrome b (27Ljungdahl P.O. Beckmann J.D. Trumpower B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 3723-3731Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the presence of a stable iron-sulfur protein without cluster does not have an effect on the spectrum of cytochrome b. This suggests that the structural change at center P is subtle and has not affected the hemeb L environment. The structural change at center N is also subtle. Although the decreased reduction of cytochrome b by menaquinol through center N suggests that menaquinol reacts with only one half of the dimer and only one antimycin is bound with high affinity to the dimer, the optical spectrum indicates there was no significant change in the heme b H environment. The crystal structure of the bc 1 complex shows that the iron-sulfur protein forms center P of one monomer and is close to center N in the second monomer. Because the iron-sulfur protein is intertwined in the dimeric enzyme we hypothesize that a mutation in the extrinsic head domain of the iron-sulfur protein in one monomer exerts an effect across the membrane in a trans manner, affecting center N of the other monomer. The amounts of iron-sulfur protein in the purified enzyme from the CHS14 mutant indicate that the apoprotein is inserted into both halves of the dimer and remains during purification of the bc 1 complex. The extent of protease susceptibility of the protein lacking the iron-sulfur cluster suggests that the protein is not properly inserted into one of the monomers. Taken together these results suggest that the S183C mutation allows the correct insertion of one iron-sulfur protein, but not the second, and only the correctly inserted iron-sulfur protein allows binding of ligands in each center."
https://openalex.org/W2044390592,"Catalysis by Escherichia coliand Porphyromonas gingivalis iron superoxide dismutase was activated by addition of primary amines, as measured by pulse radiolysis and stopped-flow spectrophotometry. This activation was saturable for most amines investigated, and a free energy plot of the apparent second-order rate constant of activation was linear as a function of the pK a of the amine, indicating activation by proton transfer. Amines provide an alternate rather than the only pathway for proton transfer, and catalysis was appreciable in the absence of amines. Solvent hydrogen isotope effects were near unity for amine activation, which is consistent with rate-contributing proton transfer if the pK a of the proton acceptor on the enzyme is not in the region of the pK a values of the amines studied, from 7.8 to 10.6. The activation of catalysis by these amines was uncompetitive with respect to superoxide, interpreted as proton transfer in a ternary complex of amine with the enzyme-bound peroxide dianion. Catalysis by Escherichia coliand Porphyromonas gingivalis iron superoxide dismutase was activated by addition of primary amines, as measured by pulse radiolysis and stopped-flow spectrophotometry. This activation was saturable for most amines investigated, and a free energy plot of the apparent second-order rate constant of activation was linear as a function of the pK a of the amine, indicating activation by proton transfer. Amines provide an alternate rather than the only pathway for proton transfer, and catalysis was appreciable in the absence of amines. Solvent hydrogen isotope effects were near unity for amine activation, which is consistent with rate-contributing proton transfer if the pK a of the proton acceptor on the enzyme is not in the region of the pK a values of the amines studied, from 7.8 to 10.6. The activation of catalysis by these amines was uncompetitive with respect to superoxide, interpreted as proton transfer in a ternary complex of amine with the enzyme-bound peroxide dianion. The superoxide dismutases (SODs) 1The abbreviations used are: SOD, superoxide dismutase; Fe-SOD, iron superoxide dismutase; Mn-SOD, manganese superoxide dismutase; Ches, 2-(cyclohexylamino)ethanesulfonic acid; Taps, 3-[[tris(hydroxymethyl)-methyl]amino]propanesulfonic acid; Caps, 3-cyclohexylamino-1-propane sulfonic acid; SHIE, solvent hydrogen isotope effect are cyclic redox enzymes that provide protection against oxidative damage caused by the reactions of the superoxide radical anion O2⨪.

The catalysis of the dismutation of superoxide occurs in two stages in which the metal ion, designated M in Reactions 1 and 2, alternates between the M3+ and M2+ forms (2Miller A.-F. Sorkin D.L.

Despite this high degree of structural homology, substitution of one metal for the other generally results in an inactive enzyme (8Schwartz A.L. Yikilmaz E. Vance C.K. Vathyam S. Koder R.L.

A subclass of SOD exists that is able to utilize either manganese or iron as catalytic metal ion; these are termed cambialistic SODs and are of significant interest from the perspective of metal specificity as well as catalytic mechanism. A well studied cambialistic SOD is that fromPorphyromonas gingivalis, the crystal structure of which is reported for the manganese- and iron-containing forms (10Sugio S. Hiraoka B.Y. Yamakura R. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 3487-3495Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Although they all share common features of their catalytic pathways, the copper/zinc- and nickel-containing SODs have structures unrelated to the manganese- and iron-containing SODs (2Miller A.-F.

The crystal structures of the iron- and manganese-containing superoxide dismutases generally show a trigonal bipyramidal geometry about the oxidized metal with three histidines, one aspartic acid, and one solvent molecule as ligands (6Borgstahl G.E.O.

Major features of the active site appear very similar in each enzyme, including the highly conserved hydrogen-bonded network connecting the metal-coordinated solvent molecule and residues Gln-69 2The numbering of residues is according to human Mn-SOD (46Beck Y.

Although this active site Gln emanates from a different backbone position in Fe-SOD and Mn-SOD, the side chain orientation is very similar in both. This Gln has a significant role in the modulation of the redox potential of the metal (8Schwartz A.L. Yikilmaz E. Vance C.K. Vathyam S. Koder R.L. Miller A.-F. J. Inorg.

Catalysis by Mn-SOD exhibits a strong and reversible product inhibition that occurs within milliseconds in measurements by stopped-flow and pulse radiolysis (16Hsu J.-L. Hsieh Y. Tu C.K. O'Connor D.

Soc. 1991; 113: 4069-4076Crossref Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The identity of this inhibited form is suggested to be the side-on peroxo-complex of Mn(III)SOD (17Bull C. Niederhoffer E.C. Yoshida T. Fee J.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1991; 113: 4069-4076Crossref Scopus (143) Google Scholar), but structural data are not yet available to confirm this suggestion. Such a product inhibition is not observed with Fe-SOD (15Bull C. Fee J.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1985; 107: 3295-3304Crossref Scopus (164) Google Scholar), although Fe-SOD is subject to irreversible inhibition by the Fenton reactions of H2O2 (3Cabelli D.E. Riley D. Rodriguez J.A. Valentine J.S. Zhu H. Meunier B. Biomimetic Oxidations Catalyzed by Transition Metal Complexes. Imperial College Press, London1999: 461-508Google Scholar). With maximal catalytic turnovers k cat in excess of 104 s−1, both Fe-SOD and Mn-SOD appear determined in rate by proton transfer steps that must occur at a rate at least as rapid as k cat. The maximum velocity of catalysis by E. coli Fe-SOD has an appreciable solvent hydrogen isotope effect (SHIE), near 3 (18Fee J.A. Yoshida T. Bull C. O'Neill P. Fielden E.M. Rotilio G. Superoxide and Superoxide Dismutase in Chemistry, Biology and Medicine. Elsevier Science Publishing Co., Inc., New York1986: 205-211Google Scholar), and moreover, it is enhanced by millimolar concentrations of general acid catalysts such as primary amines (15Bull C. Fee J.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1985; 107: 3295-3304Crossref Scopus (164) Google Scholar), features that strongly suggest a rate-contributing proton transfer in the catalytic pathway. This involves either one or two proton transfers from solvent to the enzyme depending on whether product dissociates as HO2− or as H2O2, which has not been determined. Moreover, if two proton transfers are involved, it is not known at which stage of catalysis, Reaction 1 or 2, these proton transfers occur. Three ionizable groups that could possibly be involved in such proton transfers are Tyr-34, His-30, and the metal-bound water. These are all participants in the hydrogen bond network of the active site. Replacement of Tyr-34, His-30, as well as other residues within the hydrogen-bonded network of human Mn-SOD results in k cat values decreased at least an order of magnitude, suggesting a role for the hydrogen bond network in support of the proton transfers (19Silverman D.N. Nick H.S. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 349: 61-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). In addition, the dissociation of the product-inhibited complex of human Mn-SOD is associated with a SHIE near 2, suggesting a role for proton transfer (20Hearn A.S. Stroupe M.E. Cabelli D.E. Lepock J.R. Tainer J.A. Nick H.S. Silverman D.N. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 12051-12058Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The activation of E. coli Fe-SOD by general acid catalysts provides an opportunity to examine in closer detail the proton transfer steps in the overall catalytic pathway. Such activation by exogenous proton donors has been informative in elucidating proton transfer pathways in other protein systems such as carbonic anhydrase, giving information on the properties of the proton transfer and of the proton acceptor on the enzyme (21Kresge A.J. Silverman D.N. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 308: 276-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). We used stopped-flow and pulse radiolysis techniques to show that activation of Fe-SOD by primary amines is an example of nonessential activation; that is, it occurs via proton transfer as an alternate rather than an exclusive pathway for proton transfer. Moreover, the mechanism of this activation is uncompetitive with respect to substrate superoxide, limiting the steps in the pathway where this activation could occur. The SHIE for proton transfer by exogenous amines and the linear free energy plot of the activation of catalysis of Fe-SOD establish limits for the pK a of the proton acceptor group on the enzyme. Purification of E. coli Fe-SOD was carried out as described in Slykhouse and Fee (22Slykhouse T.O. Fee J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 5472-5477Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with the following modifications: Sod A − /Sod B − E. coli containing a construct withE. coli Fe-SOD (gift of Dr. Anne-Francis Miller) was grown to an A 600 of 0.4 before induction with isopropyl-b-d-thiogalactopyranoside. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and lysed. Purification proceeded as described, omitting the hydroxylapatite column. Enzyme purity was monitored at each step by SDS-polyacrylamide gels, which upon the elution from the final column showed only one intense band. Enzyme concentration was determined spectroscopically, as was metal occupancy, by measuring the A 350, which corresponds to the Fe3+ with ε = 1850m−1cm−1 (22Slykhouse T.O. Fee J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 5472-5477Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The total enzyme concentration was taken as the total metal-occupied enzyme. P. gingivalis Fe-SOD was graciously supplied by Dr. Fumiyuki Yamakura. Metal occupancy was determined by flame atomic absorption spectroscopy. For P. gingivalis Fe-SOD, iron occupancy was 59%, and manganese occupancy was 0.6%. Activation of catalysis byE. coli Fe-SOD was measured by the stopped-flow technique of McClune and Fee (23McClune G.J. Fee J.A. Biophys J. 1978; 24: 65-69Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) in which a solution of KO2 in Me2SO is diluted into an aqueous solution containing enzyme and buffers. KO2 (Aldrich, spectrophotometric grade) was dissolved in the dimethyl sulfoxide with an approximately equimolar amount of 18-crown-6 ether to increase solubility. A dual-drive sequential mixing stopped-flow spectrophotometer (Applied Photophysics, SX.18MV) was used to measure the change in the absorption of superoxide at 250 nm (ε = 2000m−1cm−1 (24Rabani J. Nielson S.O. J. Phys. Chem. 1969; 73: 3736-3744Crossref Scopus (201) Google Scholar)). To enhance the efficiency of mixing, we used a sequence of two dilutions. In the first, superoxide in Me2SO from a 250-μl syringe was mixed with an aqueous solution containing 2 mm Caps and 1 mm EDTA at pH 11 from a 2.5-ml syringe, a 10:1 dilution of the Me2SO solution. After a 500- ms delay, this solution was rapidly diluted again in a 1:1 ratio with a solution containing enzyme, 200 mm buffer (sodium borate, Taps, or Ches), 1.0 mm EDTA, and primary amines as activators. Average dead time was 4 ms for the mixing of enzyme and substrate. Final Me2SO concentration was 4.5% by volume. No enhancement of catalytic activity of E. coli Fe-SOD was detected when borate or Taps buffer were increased in concentration from 5 to 180 mm; ionic strength was maintained with 0.1 mNa2SO4. Concentrations of borate buffer above 0.2 m depressed the activity of Fe-SOD by at most 40%, an effect noted previously (25Benovic J. Tillman T. Cudd A. Fridovich I. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1983; 221: 329-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). D2O (99.9 atom %, Isotec, Miamisburg, OH) was used to measure solvent hydrogen isotope effects; D2O was filtered through charcoal and glass-distilled. All experiments were carried out at 25 °C at either a 2- or 10-mm path length. The average of four to eight reaction traces of the first 5–10% of the reaction was used to determine initial rates. The uncatalyzed rates were subtracted. Pulse radiolysis experiments were carried out at Brookhaven National Laboratory using the 2 MeV van de Graaff accelerator. Dosimetry was determined using the KSCN dosimeter as described by Cabelli et al. (26Cabelli D.E. Guan Y. Leveque V. Hearn A.S. Tainer J.A. Nick H.S. Silverman D.N. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 11686-11692Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). All UV spectra were recorded at 25 °C on a Cary 210 spectrophotometer with a path length of either 2 or 6.1 cm. Solutions contained enzyme, 30 mmformate, and 0.5 m ethanol (as hydroxyl radical scavengers), 50 μm EDTA, and 2 mm Taps at pH 8.2. Superoxide radicals formed in an aqueous air saturated solution via the mechanisms described by Schwarz (27Schwarz H.A. J. Chem. Educ. 1981; 58: 101-105Crossref Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Decay of superoxide was observed spectrophotometrically at 260 nm. Initial rates were calculated from the first 10% of the progress curve and were subsequently used to determine the steady-state parameters through a least-squares fitting process (Enzfitter; Biosoft). We observed the saturable activation by exogenous amines of catalysis by E. coli Fe-SOD at steady state. Results determined by stopped-flow spectrophotometry for ethanolamine are shown in Fig. 1 (plotted using the concentration of ethanolammonium ion) in which the concentration of superoxide was maintained at the near saturating level of 780 μm.KmO·2 for superoxide was determined to be 100 ± 20 μm under the conditions of Fig. 1; this and other steady-state constants for catalysis by E. coli Fe-SOD are given in Table I and are in agreement with those reported earlier (15Bull C. Fee J.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1985; 107: 3295-3304Crossref Scopus (164) Google Scholar).

In our hands, this activation was saturable for the activating amines of Table II, except for 3-aminopropionic acid. These variations are most likely due to different experimental conditions; Bull and Fee (15Bull C. Fee J.A. J. Am. Chem.

Data are the mean and standard deviation of at least three measurements. The activation of Fe-SOD was further investigated by variation of the concentrations of both the superoxide and proton donor. The activation by glycine is shown as a Hanes-Woolf plot in Fig.2. The common intercept on the ordinate indicates thatkcat/KmO·2does not change with varying glycine concentrations, described as an uncompetitive activation (28Segel I.H. Enzyme Kinetics. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1975: 183-188Google Scholar). A replot of the slopes of each line in the Hanes-Woolf plot versusactivator concentration was hyperbolic. Results similar to Fig. 2 were obtained with ethanolammonium ion as proton donor under the conditions of Fig. 2; that is, the data at different ethanolamine concentrations came to a common intercept on the ordinate. Thus, the activation of superoxide dismutase by these exogenous amines was found to be an example of nonessential, uncompetitive activation (28Segel I.H. Enzyme Kinetics. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1975: 183-188Google Scholar). This behavior is consistent with the nonessential activator mechanism shown in Scheme FS1 and described by Equation 1.v[E]=kcat[O2⨪]KmO2⨪+[O2⨪]1+[BH+]βKmB1+[BH+]KmBEquation 1 Here BH+ is the exogenous proton donor, and β is the factor by which k cat is enhanced by activator. At the saturating concentration of O2⨪, the result shown in Equation 2 occurs,v[E]=kcatobs=kcat1+[BH+]KmB1+[BH+]βKmBEquation 2 In the absence of activator, Equation 2 givesv/[E] = k cat. In the presence of concentrations of activator close to saturation,v/[E] = βk cat in which β > 1.0 and expresses the extent of activation at saturation. Rearrangement of Equation 2 gives the following expression (28Segel I.H. Enzyme Kinetics. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1975: 183-188Google Scholar), Equation 3,1kcatobs−kcat=KmBkcatββ−11[BH+]+1kcat1β−1Equation 3 Equation 3 shows that a plot of 1/( kcatobs −k cat) versus 1/[BH+] should be linear with an intercept that gives the maximal velocity attributed to the activation k cat(β − 1) and a slope that gives the (reciprocal of the) apparent second-order rate constant due to the activating amines, (β − 1)k cat/β KmB. Such a plot is shown in the inset to Fig. 1 for activation by ethanolammonium. For brevity, (β − 1)k cat/β KmBis designated (k cat/K m)donor. 3(k cat/K m)donoris (β − 1)k cat/β KmBof Equation 3.Several other primary amines were found to enhance catalysis of superoxide decay by E. coli Fe-SOD; specific examples are listed in Table II along with β and (k cat/K m)donorvalues. Weak acids that are not primary amines such as morpholine and 1,2-dimethylimidazole did not enhance catalysis under the conditions of Fig. 1. Activation by primary amines was observed in catalysis with Fe-SOD from P. gingivalis (Table I). Values of the apparent second-order rate constant for activation (k cat/K m)donorare plotted versus the solution value of the pK a of the activating amine in Fig.3. Even the largest value of (k cat/K m)donor(4.7 μm−1 s−1 for glycine methyl ester; Table II) is not close to diffusion control, in contrast tokcat/KmO-2 , which is closer to diffusion control at 250 μm−1 s−1 for E. coliFe-SOD (Table I). The free energy plot of Fig. 3 is fit to a straight line with a slope of 0.50 ± 0.07. β and (β − 1)k cat values did not display a linear correlation on a free energy plot.

We have no data to indicate the pK a of the amines when bound to enzyme in the complex that leads to activation of catalysis; in the absence of such data, we have used the solution values of pK a of amines in Fig. 3. This may account in part for the scatter of points in this figure; additional scatter could be attributed to structural variations in the general acid catalysts. The binding of these amines to E. coli Fe-SOD is weak as suggested by the KmB values and the concentrations of amines required to approach saturation; the KmB values range from about 4 to 50 mm for the amines of Fig. 3. Perhaps such weak binding would indicate little change in pK a of the amine upon binding. This was the case with activating derivatives of imidazole and pyridine during catalysis by carbonic anhydrase (29An H. Tu C.K. Duda D. Montanez-Clemente I. Math K. Laipis P.J. McKenna R. Silverman D.N. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 3235-3242Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). A role for exogenous proton donors and acceptors in catalysis is well studied in enzymatic reactions that consume or generate protons, such as the hydration/dehydration of CO2/HCO3− catalyzed by carbonic anhydrase (29An H.

Ther. 1997; 74: 1-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar) and the activation of a site-specific mutant of aspartate aminotransferase (31Toney M.D. Kirsch J.F. Science. 1989; 243: 1485-1488Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). However, there is an interesting difference between activation of Fe-SOD and these examples. In carbonic anhydrase, the steady-state turnover in the catalyzed dehydration of HCO3− approaches zero as the concentration of exogenous proton donor is reduced to concentrations below 1 mm (32Pocker Y. Janjic N. Miao C.H. Bertini I. Luchinat C. Maret W. Zeppezauer M. Zinc Enzymes. Birkhauser, Boston1985: 341-356Google Scholar, 33Jonsson B.-H. Steiner H. Lindskog S. FEBS Lett. 1976; 64: 310-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). For many isozymes of carbonic anhydrase, His-64 acts as a proton shuttle to transfer protons from buffers in solution to the zinc-bound hydroxide at the active site (34Tu C.K. Silverman D.N. Forsman C. Jonsson B.H. Lindskog S. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 7913-7918Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). After each dehydration step that releases CO2, the zinc-bound hydroxide must be reprotonated from solution to complete the catalytic cycle. Water itself is not sufficient as a proton donor to the zinc-bound hydroxide or to His-64 to carry out this process at a rate exceeding about 103 s−1 (35Eigen M. Hammes G.G. Adv. Enzymol. 1963; 25: 1-38PubMed Google Scholar, 36Fee J.A. McClune G.J. Lees A.C. Zidovetzki R. Pecht I. Isr. J. Chem. 1981; 21: 54-58Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar). As a result, in the absence of exogenous buffers, catalysis is nearly abolished. In catalysis by Fe-SOD, the steady-state velocity does not approach zero in the absence of exogenous amine but maintains an appreciable value at 2 ms−1 (Fig. 1). This fact excludes a catalytic mechanism in which a residue of the enzyme itself acts as proton shuttle and the function of the exogenous amine is to rapidly protonate this shuttle residue. This mechanism is excluded because it requires a rapid reprotonation rate of the shuttle residue, and catalysis would decrease greatly in the absence of exogenous proton donor, which is not observed (Fig. 1). These observations suggest that solvent itself is the predominant mechanism that provides the proton in catalysis by Fe-SOD. This was also suggested on the basis of kinetic and structural data, for example the pH independence of k cat, the SHIE of 3 on k cat (15Bull C. Fee J.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1985; 107: 3295-3304Crossref Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 18Fee J.A. Yoshida T. Bull C. O'Neill P. Fielden E.M. Rotilio G. Superoxide and Superoxide Dismutase in Chemistry, Biology and Medicine. Elsevier Science Publishing Co., Inc., New York1986: 205-211Google Scholar), and the crystal structures of E. coli Fe-SOD and azide-inhibited complexes (7Lah M.S. Dixon M.M. Pattridge K.A. Stallings W.C. Fee J.A. Ludwig M.L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 1646-1660Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). Since the metal-bound water molecule will have its pK a depressed, this is a likely source of rapid proton transfer in the active site. When the iron of Fe-SOD is in the oxidized state, the solvent ligand has pK a near 5, whereas in the reduced state, this ligand has pK afrom 9 to 11 (36). Further analysis of the activation data, discussed below, suggests that amines as exogenous proton donors provide an alternate pathway to the proton transfer in which the metal-bound water is the proton donor and the bound peroxide anion is the proton acceptor. We observed activation by amines of P. gingivalisFe-SOD with kinetic constants similar to those for E. coliFe-SOD (Table I), indicating that this activation is not a specific property of the E. coli enzyme but is probably general among many Fe-SODs. Significant features of the free energy plot or Brønsted plot for activation by exogenous amines (Fig. 3) yield further information on the catalysis. The logarithm of the rate constant (k cat/K m)donordescribing the activation of Fe-SOD catalysis by amines was a linear function of the pK a of activating amines (Fig. 3); this confirms that activation occurs by proton transfer. We did not observe any significant correlation in kcatobs or β, which may mean that the component of k cat due to activation does not have a significant contribution from proton transfer steps or that we lack accuracy on this parameter, which is difficult to measure, requiring large concentrations of both superoxide and amine. The slope of a free energy plot for a proton transfer reaction provides evidence on the position of the transition state with respect to reactants and products (37Kresge A.J. Caldin E.F. Gold V. Proton-Transfer Reactions. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1975: 179-199Crossref Google Scholar). The slope in Fig. 3, which is the Brønsted coefficient α, is 0.50 ± 0.07, indicating a position midway between reactants and products. In a free energy plot with extensive curvature, it is possible to estimate the pK a of the donor group on the enzyme (35Eigen M. Hammes G.G. Adv. Enzymol. 1963; 25: 1-38PubMed Google Scholar, 38Rowlett R.S. Silverman D.N. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1982; 101: 6734-6741Google Scholar). However, with the free energy plot of Fig. 3, it is not possible to estimate the pK a of the proton acceptor group on Fe-SOD. This lack of curvature is in contrast to the very curved free energy plots for bimolecular proton transfer between nitrogen and oxygen acids and bases occurring non-enzymatically in solution (39Kresge A.J. Acc. Chem. Res. 1975; 8: 354-360Crossref Scopus (300) Google Scholar) and is also in contrast to the very curved plots and low intrinsic kinetic barrier observed for general acid catalysis in site-specific mutants of carbonic anhydrase (40Silverman D.N. Tu C.K. Chen X. Tanhauser S.M. Kresge A.J. Laipis P.J. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 10757-10762Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The lack of curvature in Fig. 3, although over a narrow range of pK a values, indicates that the proton transfer to the Fe-SOD from exogenous amines has a large intrinsic kinetic barrier when compared with that for the non-enzymatic transfer of protons between electronegative atoms, which is near 2 kcal/mol (39Kresge A.J. Acc. Chem. Res. 1975; 8: 354-360Crossref Scopus (300) Google Scholar). Previous reports on proton transfer between electronegative atoms describe increased values of the SHIE in a narrow range of pK a values for the proton donors (2–6 pK a units with a maximal value of the SHIE at pK a(donor) − pK a(acceptor) near zero) with SHIE near unity outside this range. This observation was made both for non-enzymatic proton transfer between electronegative atoms (41Bergman N.-A. Chiang Y. Kresge A.J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1978; 100: 5954-5956Crossref Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 42Cox M.M. Jencks W.P. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1978; 100: 5956-5957Crossref Scopus (67) Google Scholar) and for the enzymatic case of carbonic anhydrase (40Silverman D.N. Tu C.K. Chen X. Tanhauser S.M. Kresge A.J. Laipis P.J. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 10757-10762Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 43Taoka S. Tu C.K. Kistler K.A. Silverman D.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17988-17992Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). An explanation for a maximum in isotope effect near ΔpK a value of zero in proton transfer reactions is based on a comparison of symmetric and asymmetric transition states by Westheimer (44Westheimer F.H. Chem. Rev. 1961; 61: 265-273Crossref Scopus (851) Google Scholar). The SHIE on the rate constant (k cat/K m)donor is unity within error for activation of Fe-SOD by exogenous amines (TableII). That we do not observe a region of increased SHIE for rate constant (k cat/K m)donor(Table II) indicates that the proton-donating amines we used do not have pK a values close to that of the proton acceptor in Fe-SOD. This suggests, for example, that Tyr-34 (pK a 8.5 for E. coli Fe(II)SOD; Ref. 45Sorkin D.L. Miller A.-F. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4916-4924Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) is not the proton acceptor, and perhaps neither is the aqueous ligand of Fe(II)SOD if it has a pK a less than 11. These conclusions are consistent with the pH-independent nature ofk cat for E. coli Fe-SOD in the pH range of 7–11 (15Bull C. Fee J.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1985; 107: 3295-3304Crossref Scopus (164) Google Scholar), since k cat for the overall catalysis is limited by the proton transfer step. The data are also consistent with proton transfer to the peroxide dianion bound to iron, which is anticipated to have very high pK a. The data for activation of E. coli Fe-SOD by glycine (Fig. 2) and ethanolamine (data not shown) indicate an uncompetitive activation with respect to superoxide. The steady-state rate equation derived from the catalytic pathway of Reactions 1 and 2 is complex and contains terms with substrate concentration squared. However, we can draw some conclusions from the uncompetitive nature of the activation of catalysis by exogenous amines. The most straightforward interpretation based on known features of the pathway is that the activators donate a proton within a ternary complex of enzyme, peroxide, and amine. 5Other mechanisms are consistent with uncompetitive inhibition. An example is catalysis at large superoxide concentrations, which produces a predominant concentration at the steady state of the enzyme species that immediately precedes a rate-limiting proton transfer step, and proton donation from exogenous amines occurs to that predominant enzyme form. In this case, uncompetitive inhibition does not require proton transfer in a ternary complex. We assume that rate-limiting proton transfer by amines assists product release, as shown in Scheme FS1. Scheme FS1 reflects uncompetitive activation if β in Equations Equation 1, Equation 2, Equation 3 is greater than unity (inhibition if β is less than unity). Scheme FS1 is based on the 5-6-5 mechanism of Lah et al. (7Lah M.S. Dixon M.M. Pattridge K.A. Stallings W.C. Fee J.A. Ludwig M.L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 1646-1660Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar) in which substrate superoxide binding in the active site expands the coordination shell of the metal to octahedral. Scheme FS1 does not show the coordination sites of three histidines and one aspartate. Thus, our data are consistent with the amines providing an alternate pathway to proton donation by the iron-bound water. The data do not indicate where the amine binds for this proton transfer; the active site channel of Fe-SOD is narrow (7Lah M.S. Dixon M.M. Pattridge K.A. Stallings W.C. Fee J.A. Ludwig M.L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 1646-1660Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). (k cat/K m)donorvalues are near 1 μm−1 s−1 and far from diffusion control. These exogenous donors could bind at some distance from the metal and transfer protons through a hydrogen-bonded chain to the iron-bound peroxide anion. We thank Dr. Diane Cabelli for assistance with pulse radiolysis experiments, Dr. Anne-Frances Miller for providing E. coli Fe-SOD, and Dr. Fumiyuki Yamakura for Fe-SOD from P. gingivalis."

To address whether GH has direct actions on pituitary cells, lipid signaling in GH4ZR7 somatomammotroph cells was examined. GH (EC50 = 5 nm) stimulated diacylglycerol (DAG) and ceramide formation in parallel by over 10-fold within 15 min and persisting for >3 h. GH-induced DAG/ceramide formation was blocked by pertussis toxin (PTX) implicating Gi/Goproteins and was potentiated 1.5-fold by activation of Gi/Go-coupled dopamine-D2S receptors, which had no effect alone. Following PTX pretreatment, only PTX-resistant Gαi3, not Gαo or Gαi2, rescued GH-induced DAG/ceramide signaling. GH-induced DAG/ceramide formation was also blocked in cells expressing Gβγ blocker GRK-ct. In GH4ZR7 cells, GH induced phosphorylation of JAK2 and STAT5, which was blocked by PTX and mimicked by ceramide analogue C2-ceramide or sphingomyelinase treatment to increase endogenous ceramide. We conclude that in GH4 pituitary cells, GH induces formation of DAG/ceramide via a novel Gαi3/Gβγ-dependent pathway.

Rev. 1998; 19: 717-797Google Scholar). Secretion of GH is stimulated by hypothalamic GH-releasing hormone and inhibited by the hypothalamic tetradecapeptide somatostatin and by IGF. In addition, somatostatin agonists (e.g. octreotide) and dopamine-D2 agonists (e.g. bromocryptine) are used clinically to treat acromegaly (a syndrome produced by hypersecretion of GH) and to inhibit somatomammotroph growth and GH production (3Colao A. Lombardi G. Lancet. 1998; 352: 1455-1461Google Scholar). Negative feedback via autocrine actions of GH at the pituitary has been postulated (4Asa S.L. Coschigano K.T. Bellush L. Kopchick J.J. Ezzat S. Am. J. Pathol. 2000; 156: 1009-1015Google Scholar) but is yet to be clearly demonstrated. The GH receptor is a member of the type I cytokine receptor superfamily, related to PRL and erythropoietin receptors that homodimerize to initiate signaling (5Gadina M. Hilton D. Johnston J.A. Morinobu A. Lighvani A. Zhou Y.J. Visconti R. O'Shea J.J. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2001; 13: 363-373Google Scholar). The GH receptor signals through the JAK2 tyrosine kinase-signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (STAT5) transcription factor pathway to induce gene expression (6Kelly P.A. Goujon L.

Metab. 2001; 12: 252-257Google Scholar). Phosphorylation on residue Tyr-694 by JAK2 is obligatory for STAT5 activation (10Gouilleux F. Wakao H. Mundt M. Groner B. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4361-4369Google Scholar). The two STAT5 variants, STAT5a and STAT5b, have 90% identical protein sequences and are independently regulated and activated in various cell types (11Park S.H. Liu X. Hennighausen L. Davey H.W. Waxman D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7421-7430Google Scholar). Studies using STAT5a or STAT5b knockout mice have demonstrated that STAT5b, but not STAT5a, is required for GH-induced regulation of IGF1 and sex-specific steroidogenic enzymes in liver (11Park S.H. Liu X. Hennighausen L. Davey H.W. Waxman D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7421-7430Google Scholar, 12Davey H.W. Xie T. McLachlan M.J. Wilkins R.J. Waxman D.J. Grattan D.R.

While STAT5 activation is implicated in many GH actions, other signaling pathways not involving STAT5 appear to be recruited for GH-induced stimulation of other pathways including MAPK phosphorylation and phosphatidyl inositol 3′-kinase or protein kinase C activation (14Moutoussamy S. Renaudie F. Lago F. Kelly P.A. Finidori J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15906-15912Google Scholar, 15Moutoussamy S. Kelly P.A. Finidori J. Eur. J.

Ceramide is a novel second messenger implicated in regulation of cell differentiation, proliferation, inflammation, and apoptosis (17Liu B. Obeid L.M. Hannun Y.A. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 8: 311-322Google Scholar, 18Basu S. Kolesnick R. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 3277-3285Google Scholar, 19Liu G. Kleine L. Hebert R.L. Crit. Rev. Clin. Lab. Sci. 1999; 36: 511-573Google Scholar). Ceramide plays an important role in signaling of a subgroup of cytokine receptors that includes tumor necrosis factor and interleukin-1 receptors (5Gadina M. Hilton D. Johnston J.A. Morinobu A.

Lobie P.E. Clin. Exp. Pharmacol. Physiol. 1999; 26: 760-764Google Scholar). However, the coupling of the GH/PRL-related family of receptors to ceramide has not been reported. We therefore examined whether GH might influence ceramide formation in pituitary cells as part of an autocrine feedback pathway and whether dopamine-D2 agonists would influence GH action. Rat pituitary tumor GH4C1 cells synthesize and secrete PRL and GH and provide an excellent model of pituitary somatomammotrophs used for over 30 years (22Albert P.R. Vitam. Horm. 1994; 48: 59-109Google Scholar). In this report we have identified a novel induction of DAG and ceramide formation by GH that is blocked by PTX, implicating the involvement of Gi/Go proteins (23Birnbaumer L. Cell. 1992; 71: 1069-1072Google Scholar). The contribution of specific Gα subunits to GH autocrine signaling pathways was addressed using PTX-insensitive mutants of Gαi2, Gαi3, and Gαoindividually transfected into GH4ZR7 pituitary cells (GH4C1 cells transfected with the dopamine-D2S receptor (24Albert P.R. Neve K.A. Bunzow J.R. Civelli O. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2098-2104Google Scholar, 25Banihashemi B. Albert P.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 2393-2404Google Scholar)). In PTX-insensitive G protein mutants, the carboxyl-terminal ribosyl-acceptor cysteine was changed to a nonacceptor serine. The Cys-to-Ser mutation is a structurally conservative change, and the mutant G proteins remain functional following PTX pretreatment (26Chuprun J.K. Raymond J.R. Blackshear P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 773-781Google Scholar, 27Ghahremani M.H. Cheng P. Lembo P.M. Albert P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9238-9245Google Scholar, 28Ghahremani M.H. Forget C. Albert P.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1497-1506Google Scholar). The role of Gβγ subunits was evaluated by using the carboxyl-terminal domain of G protein-coupled receptor kinase (GRK-ct), a selective Gβγ scavenger (29Koch W.J. Hawes B.E. Inglese J. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6193-6197Google Scholar). In GH4ZR7 cells, dopamine-D2S receptor activation potentiated GH-induced DAG and ceramide formation. We have identified Gαi3 and Gβγ as crucial for both GH-induced ceramide formation and dopamine-D2-induced potentiation of the GH response. Apomorphine, dopamine, Staphylococcus aureus SMase, PTX, 1,2-dioleoyl-rac-glycerol (C18:1[cis]-9), DAG, puromycin, and all other drugs, standards, and salts were purchased from Sigma. Human GH (iodination grade) and Escherichia coli DAG kinase (13 units/mg protein) were from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA). Sera, media, and Geneticin (G418) were obtained from Invitrogen, Inc. [γ-32P]ATP and [α-32P]dCTP (>3000 Ci/mmol) were from AmershamBiosciences. Thin-layer chromatography (TLC) plates (0.25 mm thick) were purchased from Whatman. Solvents were supplied by BDH. Plasmids pY3 and pCMV-LacZ II were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). The cDNAs encoding wild-type rat Gαo, Gαi1, Gαi2, and Gαi3 were generously provided by Dr. Randall Reed, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD. Phospho-STAT5 (Tyr-694) antibody, phosphoplus® STAT3 (Tyr-705) and phosphoplus® p44/42 MAPK antibody kits were purchased from New England Biolabs (Mississauga, Ontario, Canada). As previously described (27Ghahremani M.H. Cheng P. Lembo P.M. Albert P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9238-9245Google Scholar), PTX-insensitive Gαi/o mutants were generated by point mutation of rat cDNAs (30Jones D.T. Reed R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 14241-14249Google Scholar) encoding Gαi2 and Gαi3 subunits at cysteine 351 (352 for Gαi2). The TGT (cysteine codon) was mutated to TCT (serine) and confirmed by Sanger dideoxynucleotide sequencing. The mutant Gαi2 and Gαi3 cDNAs were FLAG-tagged at the initiator ATG codon, and the cDNAs were subcloned in KpnI-EcoRI-cut pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) to generate Gαi2-PTX, Gαi3-PTX, and Gαo-PTX. The carboxyl-terminal domain of OK-GRK2 cDNA (31Lembo P.M. Ghahremani M.H. Albert P.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 138-147Google Scholar), beginning from Thr-493, was tagged at the amino-terminal with RGS-His6, and the His-GRK-ct fragment was cloned into pcDNA3 to produce the GRK-ct construct. GH4ZR7 cells and derivative clones were maintained in Ham's F10 medium with 8% fetal bovine serum (FBS) at 37 °C, 5% CO2. Gαi2-PTX, Gαi3-PTX, and Gαo-PTX (20 μg) were cotransfected individually with pGK-puro (2 μg) into GH4ZR7 cells using calcium phosphate co-precipitation. The transfected cells were cultured in F10 + 8% FBS containing puromycin (20 μg/ml) for 3–4 weeks. Antibiotic-resistant clones were picked (24 clones/transfection) and tested for expression of the corresponding Gαi/oproteins by Western blot analysis. The following Gαi2-PTX, Gαi3-PTX, Gαo-PTX and GRK-ct clones were selected for analysis, respectively: Gi2Z 24, Gi3Z 15, Gαo 15, and GRKZ 17. These cells express about 2- to 3-fold times the endogenous level of total Gα protein in GH4ZR7 cells, suggesting that the ratio of PTX-insensitive/endogenous Gα proteins in the clones was 1–2-fold (25Banihashemi B. Albert P.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 2393-2404Google Scholar). Equivalent numbers of cells were cultured in ten 10-cm plates with Ham's F10 medium plus 8% FBS in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2, 95% air at 37 °C, grown to 80–90% confluence, and placed in serum-free F10 medium for 16 h. For PTX treatment, the cells were treated with 10 ng/ml PTX for 16 h prior to experimentation. Cells were rinsed with serum-free F10 medium and treated with experimental compounds at 37 °C as indicated. Following incubations, cells were twice rinsed with ice-cold PBS and lipids extracted (32Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Google Scholar). After centrifugation at 500 ×g for 1 min at 4 °C, the supernatants were aspirated and the cells were lyzed with 0.5 ml of chloroform/methanol/HCl (20:40:1, v/v/v), and sonicated in 5-s intervals × 6 on ice. Cells were rinsed with 1 ml of chloroform and 0.3 ml of 1 m NaCl and spun at 14,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The upper aqueous layer was discarded, and the lower lipid-containing layer was transferred to a 1-ml glass Chrompack vial, dried under a stream of O2-free N2 gas, and redissolved in 200 μl of chloroform. The samples were stored at −80 °C until analysis. The particulate protein interface was air-dried, dissolved in 0.5 ml of 2m NaOH, and assayed for protein according to Lowry's method. DAG and ceramide were quantified using the DAG kinase method (33Preiss J. Loomis C.R. Bishop W.R. Stein R. Niedel J.E. Bell R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 8597-8600Google Scholar, 34Wright T.M. Rangan L.A. Shin H.S. Raben D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 9374-9380Google Scholar). A blank tube and a standard ceramide/DAG tube were included as controls. For each sample, 10 μl of DAG kinase (20 milliunits), 50 μl of reaction buffer (100 mm imidazole, pH 6.6, 25 mm MgCl2and 2 mm EGTA), 10 μl of 20 mmdithiothreitol, and 10 μl of [γ-32P]ATP (2.5 × 105 dpm/nmol) were added and incubated at 25 °C for 30 min, and the reactions terminated by addition of 0.5-ml ice-cold chloroform/methanol (1:2 v/v). The lipids were separated and extracted by addition of 0.5 ml of chloroform and 0.5 ml of 1 m NaCl spun at 14,000 × g for 3 min, and the upper aqueous phase was discarded. The organic phase was sequentially washed with 0.5 ml of 1% perchloric acid, 0.3 ml of chloroform/methanol (1:2 v/v), 0.2 ml of chloroform, and 0.2 ml of water, dried under N2, and reconstituted in 25 μl of chloroform/methanol (95:5, v/v). The samples were spotted onto a Silica Gel 60 TLC plate, heat-activated, and developed in a solvent mixture of chloroform/acetone/methanol/acetic acid/water (10:4:3:2:1, v/v/v/v/v). Since DAG kinase can use ceramide or DAG as substrate, [32P]ceramide-phosphate represented ceramide production and [32P]phosphatidic acid represented DAG production. The TLC plates were exposed to phosphor screens for 18 h, and [32P]ceramide-phosphate and [32P]phosphatidic acid were quantified using the Molecular Dynamics System ImageQuaNT computer software. Results are expressed as percentage of control. The binding assay was performed using 50 μg of protein and 15,000 cpm/sample of125I-hGH (2150 Ci/mmol, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in a final volume of 300 μl (0.021 nm final concentration) of TME buffer (75 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 12.5 mmMgCl2, 1 mm EDTA) containing 0.1% BSA (35Klempt M. Bingham B. Breier B.H. Baumbach W.R. Gluckman P.D. Endocrinology. 1993; 132: 1071-1077Google Scholar). To assess nonspecific binding 1 nm unlabeled hGH was added to the reaction. Incubation at room temperature was stopped after 30 min by the addition of 500 μl of cold 100 mm Tris, pH 7.4. The reaction was then filtered through GF/C filters and washed three times with 5 ml of cold 100 mm Tris, pH 7.4. Triplicate measurements were performed for all samples. Cells were treated as described above. Cell pellets were frozen on dry ice/ethanol and stored at –80 °C. Samples were sonicated 10–15 s, heated at 95 °C for 5 min, and centrifuged, and 40 μl/sample loaded onto SDS-PAGE gel and electrotransferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The membrane was blocked (1 h, room temperature), probed with primary antibody (1:1000, overnight, 4 °C), washed in TBST (10 mmTris-HCl, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.05% Tween 20) and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (1:2000) and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-biotin antibody (1:1000) to detect biotinylated protein markers (2 h at room temperature). The blot was then washed, incubated with LumiGLO (1 min), and exposed to x-ray film. Exposures in the linear range (gray scale) were scanned and quantified using the UnScanIt program (Silk Scientific Inc., Orem, Utah). The data were analyzed by repeated measure using analysis of variance for each set of experiments. Differences of p < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. The acute action of GH on endogenous DAG and ceramide levels in GH4ZR7pituitary cells was assessed by the DAG kinase assay. The cells were washed to remove extracellular (secreted) GH and assayed in serum-free medium. GH induced a 10-fold increase in both DAG and ceramide production in a concentration-dependent manner from 10−10 to 10−6m at 20 min with an EC50 of ∼5 nm (Fig. 1). Addition of exogenous SMase (0.1 units/ml) was included as a positive control to demonstrate the hydrolysis of endogenous SM to form ceramide. The phosphorylated DAG and ceramide species co-migrated with the respective standards, confirming the identity of the products. GH (10−7m) robustly increased both DAG and ceramide production in parallel, which was maximal within 15 min and declined but remained significantly elevated at 3 h (Fig. 2). Low levels of GH are secreted by GH4C1 cells at a rate of 0.2 ng/ml/min or 10−11 mol/liter/min (36Albert P.R. Tashjian Jr., A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 15350-15363Google Scholar), sufficient to reach a threshold concentration (10−9m) for DAG/ceramide formation in 1.5 h following initiation of treatments (see “Materials and Methods”). However, GH is also metabolized, hence the actual GH concentration under culture conditions may be lower and did not appear to interfere with actions of exogenous GH.Figure 2Sustained GH-induced increases in DAG and ceramide production in GH4ZR7cells. GH4ZR7 cells treated with 10−7m GH for 15 min and 3 h. Lipids were extracted from cells and separated as described under “Material and Methods”, and a representative image is shown.

R., in press. Cells were pretreated with or without 10 ng/ml PTX for 16 h, a concentration that blocks Gi/Go-mediated signaling in these cells (22Albert P.R. Vitam. Horm. 1994; 48: 59-109Google Scholar). PTX treatment blocked GH-induced DAG and ceramide formation, thus implicating Gi/Go proteins (Fig. 3). By contrast, PTX or dopamine-D2 agonist apomorphine (10−6m) alone did not alter DAG or ceramide formation. Importantly, PTX treatment did not change the level of specific 125I-GH binding sites measured in crude membranes from GH4ZR7 cells. Specific 125I-GH binding was 118 ± 45 fmol/mg in GH4ZR7cells (mean ± S.E., n = 3), and binding in PTX-treated cells was 104 ± 8% of control binding, indicating that blockade of GH-induced ceramide by PTX was not due to loss of receptor sites. To examine further whether activation of the D2S receptor modulates DAG or ceramide formation, GH4ZR7 cells were incubated with GH, apomorphine (a D2 receptor agonist) or both GH and apomorphine (Fig. 4). Although dopamine-D2S receptor activation alone did not influence DAG or ceramide formation, apomorphine potentiated by 1.5- to 2-fold times the GH-induced formation of DAG and ceramide. In parental GH4C1 cells, which lack dopamine receptors, GH induced both DAG and ceramide formation but this effect was not enhanced by apomorphine (data not shown), indicating that apomorphine-induced potentiation is mediated via activation of dopamine-D2S receptors present on GH4ZR7 cells. Pretreatment with PTX blocked GH-induced ceramide production in GH4ZR7 and GH4C1 cells and also completely blocked DAG/ceramide production by apomorphine/GH (Fig. 5), indicating that D2S-induced potentiation of GH action involves Gi/Goproteins.Figure 5Both GH - and apomorphine/GH-induced DAG and ceramide formation is blocked by PTX pretreatment.GH4ZR7 cells were treated as described in previous figures, and representative image of labeled DAG and ceramide products is shown above, and below averages of three experiments (mean ± S.E.), *, p < 0.03 and **,p < 0.01, compared with control.

Albert P.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 2393-2404Google Scholar). As observed in wild-type GH4ZR7 cells and in Gαi2-PTX and Gαi3-PTX clones, the level of ceramide production induced by combination of apomorphine and GH was greater than for GH alone (Fig. 6 and data not shown). To examine the importance of Gαi2-PTX and Gαi3-PTX, cells were pretreated with PTX to block endogenous Gi/oproteins and challenged with GH or apomorphine/GH in combination. PTX blocked completely DAG and ceramide production stimulated by GH or apomorphine/GH in Gαi2-PTX cells (Fig. 6). However in Gαi3-PTX cells, both DAG and ceramide production were at least 50% resistant to PTX pretreatment (Fig. 7). Since ∼50% of the total Gαi3 was PTX-sensitive endogenous protein (25Banihashemi B. Albert P.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 2393-2404Google Scholar), a recovery of 50% of the response would be expected from the remaining fraction of PTX-insensitive Gi3 proteins. Thus Gαi3, but not Gαi2, plays a crucial role in both GH- and apomorphine/GH-induced DAG and ceramide formation. To examine the role of Gαo subunits in GH-induced lipid signaling, GH4ZR7 cells were stably transfected with Gαo-PTX. In these cells, PTX completely blocked DAG and ceramide formation induced by the combination of apomorphine and GH (Fig. 8), indicating that like Gαi2-PTX, Gαo-PTX does not rescue GH-induced lipid signaling.Figure 7Apomorphine/GH-induced DAG and ceramide formation is rescued by Gαi3-PTX. GH4ZR7 cells expressing PTX-insensitive Gαi3 cDNA were treated for 20 min with 10−6m apomorphine or apomorphine and 10−7m GH without or with PTX pretreatment (10 ng/ml, 16 h).

Hawes B.E. Inglese J. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6193-6197Google Scholar), the carboxyl-terminal domain of G protein-coupled receptor kinase (GRK-ct) was used to examine the role of Gβγ subunits in signaling to ceramide formation. We have transfected GRK-ct into GH4ZR7 cells and identified expression of GRK-ct by Western blot (25Banihashemi B. Albert P.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 2393-2404Google Scholar). Neither apomorphine nor apomorphine/GH induced DAG or ceramide formation in GRK-ct cells (Fig. 9). This suggests that Gβγ subunits are necessary for ceramide formation induced by the combination of apomorphine and GH. Based on the results above, we examined the influence of GH, apomorphine, PTX, and ceramide on well known and potential downstream pathways of the GH receptor including phosphorylation of JAK2, STAT5 (Fig. 10), STAT3 or MAPK. In GH4ZR7 cells, GH alone increased phosphorylation of JAK2 (100% increase over basal) and STAT5 (40% increase), which was more strongly enhanced with both apomorphine and GH (160% increase over basal for phospho-JAK2, 90% increase for phospho-STAT5). Treatment with a ceramide analogue (C2-ceramide) or SMase (to increase endogenous ceramide) also increased JAK2 phosphorylation by 90 and 150%, and STAT5 phosphorylation by 60 and 90%, respectively. Interestingly, PTX-blocked apomorphine/GH-induced STAT5 phosphorylation by 50%, further supporting a role for the PTX-sensitive ceramide pathway in GH-induced STAT5 phosphorylation in these cells. By contrast, these compounds elicited no changes in STAT3 or MAPK phosphorylation (data not shown). Our results indicate that GH induces a G protein-dependent increase in lipid metabolism to generate DAG and ceramide in GH4 cells. Previous studies in pre-adipocyte Ob1771 cells (37Doglio A. Dani C. Grimaldi P. Ailhaud G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 1148-1152Google Scholar, 38Catalioto R.M. Ailhaud G. Negrel R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 173: 840-848Google Scholar) and in pancreatic β-cells (39Sjoholm A. Zhang Q. Welsh N. Hansson A. Larsson O. Tally M. Berggren P.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21033-21040Google Scholar) have shown that GH induces DAG formation via activation of PC-PLC. By analogy, GH may activate PLC in GH4 cells to induce DAG formation. Both DAG and ceramide formation were induced in parallel, suggesting interconversion between these lipids possibly via SM synthase, which can convert DAG into ceramide, leading to depletion of SM (40van Helvoort A. van't Hof W. Ritsema T. Sandra A. van Meer G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1763-1769Google Scholar, 41Luberto C. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14550-14559Google Scholar). Alternately, DAG can activate acidic SMase to generate ceramide (42Schutze S. Machleidt T. Kronke M. J. Leukoc. Biol. 1994; 56: 533-541Google Scholar, 43Schutze S. Wiegmann K. Machleidt T. Kronke M. Immunobiology. 1995; 193: 193-203Google Scholar). Interconversion of DAG to ceramide would account for the identical Gαi3 and Gβγ dependencies of GH-mediated lipid formation. The actions of GH in GH4 cells were sensitive to PTX pretreatment, indicating a role for Gi/Goproteins. Upon activation, GH receptors dimerize, associate with JAK2, and recruit a family of negative regulators, the SOCS (suppressors of cytokine signaling) proteins (44Finidori J. Vitam. Horm. 2000; 59: 71-97Google Scholar, 45Ram P.A. Waxman D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35553-35561Google Scholar). Coupling of the GH receptor to PTX-sensitive G proteins is relatively unexplored, and potential interactions of GH receptors or associated proteins such as SOCS proteins with G proteins remain elusive. There is some evidence that GH-like receptors interact with G proteins. In Nb2 cells, Gαi proteins labeled by PTX-mediated ADP ribosylation were cross-linked to the PRL receptor using a 16-Å cross-linking agent, but not cross-linkers with shorter molecular lengths, consistent with a direct physical interaction (46Too C.K. Shiu R.P. Friesen H.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 173: 48-52Google Scholar). In addition, some PTX-sensitive GH-induced responses have been reported. For example, GH-induced PC-PLC activation in Ob1771 preadipocytes (37Doglio A. Dani C. Grimaldi P. Ailhaud G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 1148-1152Google Scholar,38Catalioto R.M. Ailhaud G. Negrel R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 173: 840-848Google Scholar) and GH-mediated DAG formation and mitogenesis in pancreatic β-cells (39Sjoholm A. Zhang Q. Welsh N. Hansson A. Larsson O. Tally M. Berggren P.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21033-21040Google Scholar) are PTX-sensitive actions. Similarly, activation of the homologous PRL receptor in Nb2 lymphoma cells enhances PTX labeling of Gi proteins (suggesting activation) and induces PTX-sensitive mitogenesis (47Larsen J.L. Dufau M.L. Endocrinology. 1988; 123: 438-444Google Scholar, 48Too C.K. Murphy P.R. Friesen H.G. Endocrinology. 1989; 124: 2185-2192Google Scholar, 49Larsen J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10583-10587Google Scholar). Taken together, these results are consistent with coupling of the GH receptor to PTX-sensitive Gi proteins to activate PLC thereby generating DAG, which can be converted to ceramide. Although coupled to Gi/Go proteins, GH signaled differently from the Gi/Go-coupled dopamine D2 receptor to induce PTX-sensitive DAG and ceramide formation since apomorphine alone had no effect. Nevertheless there was an interaction between GH and D2 signaling since apomorphine potentiated GH-induced lipid signaling and JAK2/STAT5 activation. Furthermore, GH- and apomorphine/GH-induced DAG and ceramide formation were both rescued by Gαi3-PTX and blocked by GRK-ct, suggesting a crucial role for Gαi3/Gβγ for both receptors. The dopamine-D2 receptor utilizes Gi3 to mediate activation of potassium channels in pituitary cells (50Lledo P.M. Homburger V. Bockaert J. Vincent J.D. Neuron. 1992; 8: 455-463Google Scholar) via binding of Gβγ to the GIRK potassium channel (51Clapham D.E. Neer E.J. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1997; 37: 167-203Google Scholar), and is likely to couple to Gαi3/Gβγ in GH4 pituitary cells. The mechanism by which GH receptors couple to Gi3 remains to be elucidated, but GH receptors appear to interact with Gi proteins differently from Gi-coupled heptahelical receptors (such as adenosine or D2S receptors). In adipocytes, GH prevented coupling of adenosine receptor-mediated inhibition of cAMP and activation of phosphatidylinositol-specific-PLC and blocked PTX-induced ADP-ribosylation (52Roupas P. Chou S.Y. Towns R.J. Kostyo J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 1691-1695Google Scholar, 53Doris R.A. Kilgour E. Houslay M.D. Vernon R.G. J. Endocrinol. 1998; 158: 295-303Google Scholar). GH may induce relocalization of Gαi subunits, prevent their coupling to adenylyl cyclase (53Doris R.A. Kilgour E. Houslay M.D. Vernon R.G. J. Endocrinol. 1998; 158: 295-303Google Scholar, 54Yip R.G. Goodman H.M. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 1219-1227Google Scholar), and allow efficient coupling to DAG/ceramide formation. Since sites of ceramide synthesis display discrete subcellular localization (55Hannun Y.A. Obeid L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25847-25850Google Scholar), differences in the localization of D2S- and GH-receptor coupling might account for their differing effectiveness to induce ceramide formation in GH4 pituitary cells. Our data show that C2-ceramide and sphingomyelinase induce JAK2/STAT5 activation in GH4 cells, suggesting a link between GH-induced changes in DAG/ceramide and the classical GH-receptor-mediated JAK/STAT pathway. Consistent with our results, sphingomyelinase was shown to increase ceramide levels and was found to activate JAK2 and STAT1/3 in cultured human fibroblasts (56Maziere C. Conte M.A. Maziere J.C. FEBS Lett. 2001; 507: 163-168Google Scholar). Importantly, as observed for GH-mediated ceramide formation, GH-induced JAK2/STAT5 activation was enhanced by apomorphine and was partially blocked by PTX, suggesting that both G protein-dependent and -independent pathways lead to JAK2/STAT5 activation in these cells. Thus Gi-mediated ceramide signaling regulates GH-induced JAK2/STAT5 activation. In addition to regulating JAK2/STAT5, GH-induced ceramide formation may activate other signaling cascades (19Liu G. Kleine L. Hebert R.L. Crit. Rev. Clin. Lab. Sci. 1999; 36: 511-573Google Scholar). Both GH (16Love D.W. Whatmore A.J. Clayton P.E. Silva C.M.

Kleine L. Hebert R.L. Crit. Rev. Clin. Lab. Sci. 1999; 36: 511-573Google Scholar, 20Raines M.A. Kolesnick R.N. Golde D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14572-14575Google Scholar) have been shown to activate the MAPK cascade in other cell types, but we observed no induction of p42/44-MAPK by either GH or ceramide in GH4 cells. Ceramide regulates other pathways including the SAPK/JNK cascade, and several proapoptotic pathways, but the roles of these pathways in GH4 cells is not known. Multiple negative feedback pathways regulate GH secretion at the level of the hypothalamus and pituitary. At the level of the hypothalamus, GH inhibits GH-releasing hormone synthesis and enhances somatostatin release, resulting in decreased GH secretion at the pituitary (58Peng X.D. Park S. Gadelha M.R. Coschigano K.T. Kopchick J.J. Frohman L.A. Kineman R.D. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 1117-1123Google Scholar, 59Kamegai J. Unterman T.G. Frohman L.A. Kineman R.D.

Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 1709-1717Google Scholar). GH-induced IGF formation is believed to be the primary negative feedback pathway to inhibit GH synthesis in somatotrophs (1Melmed S. Yamashita S. Yamasaki H. Fagin J. Namba H. Yamamoto H. Weber M. Morita S. Webster J. Prager D. Rec. Prog. Horm. Res. 1996; 51: 189-215Google Scholar, 2Giustina A. Veldhuis J.D. Endocr. Rev. 1998; 19: 717-797Google Scholar). In addition, Gi/Go-coupled dopamine-D2 and somatostatin receptors also inhibit GH secretion and somatomammotroph growth (3Colao A. Lombardi G. Lancet. 1998; 352: 1455-1461Google Scholar). It is tempting to speculate that GH may negatively regulate its own secretion; however, evidence for a non-IGF-mediated autocrine pituitary feedback by GH is indirect (4Asa S.L. Coschigano K.T. Bellush L. Kopchick J.J. Ezzat S. Am. J. Pathol. 2000; 156: 1009-1015Google Scholar, 61Nakamoto J.M. Gertner J.M. Press C.M. Hintz R.L. Rosenfeld R.G. Genel M. J. Clin. Endocrinol.

The GH receptor is expressed in rat and human anterior pituitary and binds and internalizes radiolabeled GH, suggesting a role for GH to regulate its secretion from the pituitary (63Mertani H.C. Pechoux C. Garcia-Caballero T. Waters M.J. Morel G. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1995; 80: 3361-3367Google Scholar, 64Mertani H.C. Waters M.J. Jambou R. Gossard F. Morel G.

Endocrinol. 1991; 128: R9-R11Google Scholar). However, the signaling of the GH receptor in pituitary cells has not been investigated. Our finding of a novel G protein-mediated action of GH to induce DAG/ceramide as well as JAK2/STAT5 activation in GH4 cells suggests a role for GH in regulation of pituitary function. GH4 cells are a pituitary cell strain that has provided an important model of somatotrophs that synthesize and secrete levels of GH that are sufficient to mediate autocrine GH-induced actions (22Albert P.R. Vitam. Horm. 1994; 48: 59-109Google Scholar). Interestingly, C2-ceramide has been shown to inhibit GH secretion from rat anterior pituitary cells (67Negishi T. Chik C.L. Ho A.K. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 5691-5697Google Scholar), suggesting that GH-induced ceramide formation could mediate negative feedback inhibition of GH secretion. Previously unexplored direct actions of GH on DAG and ceramide may provide a more sensitive method to address direct actions of GH in regulation of somatotroph function in vivo."
