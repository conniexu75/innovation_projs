Martin et al. (p. 1304 ) exploited this unique situation to study the mechanisms behind the emergence. Honey bee populations have long been established on the isolated Hawaiian Islands but only recently have some islands become infested with the Varroa mite. This mite has selected for a single viral pathogen-deformed wing virus among the honey bee population, with the appearance of a single dominant virus strain, which has now spread worldwide. Thus, a normally benign viral pathogen has become one of the most widely distributed and contagious insect viruses on the planet."
https://openalex.org/W2075312701,"Studies in anesthetized animals have suggested that activity in early visual cortex is mainly driven by visual input and is well described by a feedforward processing hierarchy. However, evidence from experiments on awake animals has shown that both eye movements and behavioral state can strongly modulate responses of neurons in visual cortex; the functional significance of this modulation, however, remains elusive. Using visual-flow feedback manipulations during locomotion in a virtual reality environment, we found that responses in layer 2/3 of mouse primary visual cortex are strongly driven by locomotion and by mismatch between actual and expected visual feedback. These data suggest that processing in visual cortex may be based on predictive coding strategies that use motor-related and visual input to detect mismatches between predicted and actual visual feedback."

Nancy et al. (p. 1317 ) found that careful regulation of cellular recruitment signals allowed for fetal tolerance in mice. Although high numbers of T cells localized to the myometrium layer of the uterine wall in pregnant mice, very few T cells were found in the decidua, the uterine tissue that encapsulates the fetus and placenta. Thus, in pregnancy, regulation of immune cell localization may allow for organ-specific immune tolerance."

Many of these applications involve electron transfer events at the particle surface after light absorption. Schrauben et al. (p. 1298 ) now show, through a series of radical trap kinetic studies, that proton transfer can concurrently accompany electron transfer at the solvent interfaces of two common nanoparticle formulations (oxides of titanium and of zinc). The results may help in the optimization of particle structure and energetics."

Working in vitro, using micropatterned substrates, Reymann et al. (p. 1310 ) demonstrate that myosins can use a “selection orientation” mechanism to pull selectively on actin filaments, contract the actin network and disassemble it, or walk on the filaments, align them, allow their growth, and control filament orientation."
https://openalex.org/W2070581367,"The steroid 17β-estradiol (E2) is well known to influence hippocampal functions such as memory, affective behaviors, and epilepsy. There is growing awareness that in addition to responding to ovarian E2, the hippocampus of both males and females synthesizes E2 as a neurosteroid that could acutely modulate synaptic function. Previous work on acute E2 actions in the hippocampus has focused on excitatory synapses. Here, we show that E2 rapidly suppresses inhibitory synaptic transmission in hippocampal CA1. E2 acts through the α form of the estrogen receptor to stimulate postsynaptic mGluR1-dependent mobilization of the endocannabinoid anandamide, which retrogradely suppresses GABA release from CB1 receptor-containing inhibitory presynaptic boutons. Remarkably, this effect of E2 is sex specific, occurring in females but not in males. Acute E2 modulation of endocannabinoid tone and consequent suppression of inhibition provide a mechanism by which neurosteroid E2 could modulate hippocampus-dependent behaviors in a sex-specific manner."

AS model mice, which carry a maternal Ube3a null mutation (Ube3am−/p+), recapitulate major features of AS in humans, including enhanced seizure susceptibility. Excitatory neurotransmission onto neocortical pyramidal neurons is diminished in Ube3am−/p+ mice, seemingly at odds with enhanced seizure susceptibility. We show here that inhibitory drive onto neocortical pyramidal neurons is more severely decreased in Ube3am−/p+ mice. This inhibitory deficit follows the loss of excitatory inputs and appears to arise from defective presynaptic vesicle cycling in multiple interneuron populations. In contrast, excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs onto inhibitory interneurons are largely normal. Our results indicate that there are neuron type-specific synaptic deficits in Ube3am−/p+ mice despite the presence of Ube3a in all neurons. These deficits result in excitatory/inhibitory imbalance at cellular and circuit levels and may contribute to seizure susceptibility in AS.

Inhibitory neurotransmission is reduced in adult Ube3am−/p+ mice Inhibition is decreased onto excitatory, but not FS-inhibitory interneurons Decreased inhibition arises from multiple inhibitory interneuron classes Synaptic vesicle cycling defect may impair inhibitory neurotransmission Angelman syndrome (AS) is characterized by severe intellectual disabilities, EEG abnormalities, gait disturbances, disrupted sleep patterns, profound language impairment, and autism (Williams et al., 2006Williams C.A. Beaudet A.L. Clayton-Smith J. Knoll J.H. Kyllerman M. Laan L.A. Magenis R.E. Moncla A. Schinzel A.A. Summers J.A. Wagstaff J. Angelman syndrome 2005: updated consensus for diagnostic criteria.Am. J. Med. Genet. A. 2006; 140: 413-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). Seizures are present in 90% of AS patients, significantly impacting their quality of life and that of their caregivers (Thibert et al., 2009Thibert R.L. Conant K.D. Braun E.K. Bruno P. Said R.R.

AS is caused by deletions or loss-of-function mutations in the maternally inherited allele of UBE3A (Rougeulle et al., 1997Rougeulle C. Glatt H. Lalande M. The Angelman syndrome candidate gene, UBE3A/E6-AP, is imprinted in brain.Nat. Genet. 1997; 17: 14-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). UBE3A encodes an E3 ubiquitin ligase that, in the brain, is expressed primarily from the maternal allele as a result of neuron-specific imprinting (Albrecht et al., 1997Albrecht U. Sutcliffe J.S. Cattanach B.M. Beechey C.V. Armstrong D. Eichele G. Beaudet A.L. Imprinted expression of the murine Angelman syndrome gene, Ube3a, in hippocampal and Purkinje neurons.Nat. Genet. 1997; 17: 75-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). Similar to humans with AS, mice lacking maternal Ube3a (Ube3am−/p+) have abnormal EEG activity and are susceptible to cortical seizures, suggesting that loss of Ube3a might disrupt the excitatory/inhibitory balance in the neocortex (Jiang et al., 1998Jiang Y.H. Armstrong D. Albrecht U. Atkins C.M. Noebels J.L. Eichele G. Sweatt J.D. Beaudet A.L.

Loss of maternally inherited Ube3a results in decreased excitatory synaptic drive onto pyramidal neurons in layer 2/3 (L2/3) of neocortex, as evidenced by a loss of dendritic spines (Yashiro et al., 2009Yashiro K. Riday T.T. Condon K.H. Roberts A.C. Bernardo D.R. Prakash R. Weinberg R.J. Ehlers M.D. Philpot B.D. Ube3a is required for experience-dependent maturation of the neocortex.Nat. Neurosci. 2009; 12: 777-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Decreased Ube3a-mediated proteasomal degradation of Arc and Ephexin5 proteins may lead to excitatory synaptic defects (Greer et al., 2010Greer P.L. Hanayama R. Bloodgood B.L. Mardinly A.R. Lipton D.M. Flavell S.W. Kim T.K. Griffith E.C. Waldon Z.

These observations suggest a mechanism for how the loss of Ube3a may cause fewer and/or weaker excitatory synapses. While these deficits may be relevant to cognitive phenotypes in Ube3am−/p+ mice, they would not on their own predict hyperexcitability and increased seizure susceptibility. We hypothesized that Ube3a loss results in more severe inhibitory deficits, with the net outcome favoring cortical hyperexcitability. Here, we use the visual cortex as a model to study the role of Ube3a in the establishment and function of inhibitory circuits. We show that Ube3am−/p+ mice have an abnormal accumulation of clathrin-coated vesicles at inhibitory axon terminals, indicating a defect in vesicle cycling. Consistent with this observation, inhibitory synaptic transmission onto L2/3 pyramidal neurons recovers slower following vesicle depletion in Ube3am−/p+ mice, compared to wild-types. Recovery following high-frequency stimulation of excitatory synapses onto L2/3 pyramidal neurons, however, is normal. This discrepancy among synapse types may further contribute to excitatory/inhibitory imbalance during high levels of activity. Finally, we show that synaptic inputs onto inhibitory neurons in Ube3am−/p+ mice are largely normal. We conclude that neuron type-specific synaptic deficits are likely to underlie neocortical excitatory/inhibitory imbalance in AS. An excitatory/inhibitory imbalance in AS could arise from reduced numbers of inhibitory interneurons, abnormal inhibitory connectivity, and/or decreased inhibitory neurotransmission. To test the first possibility, we performed immunohistochemistry for three markers—parvalbumin, calretinin, and somatostatin—which together label 96% of the total GABAergic interneurons in L2/3 of mouse primary visual cortex (V1) (Gonchar et al., 2007Gonchar Y. Wang Q. Burkhalter A. Multiple distinct subtypes of GABAergic neurons in mouse visual cortex identified by triple immunostaining.Front Neuroanat. 2007; 1: 3Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We compared Ube3am−/p+ mice and their wild-type (WT) 129Sv/Ev strain littermate controls at postnatal day 80 (P80), an age where AS model mice exhibit abnormal EEG patterns and are susceptible to seizures (Jiang et al., 1998Jiang Y.H. Armstrong D. Albrecht U. Atkins C.M. Noebels J.L. Eichele G. Sweatt J.D. Beaudet A.L. Mutation of the Angelman ubiquitin ligase in mice causes increased cytoplasmic p53 and deficits of contextual learning and long-term potentiation.Neuron. 1998; 21: 799-811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar). We found no differences in the density of inhibitory interneurons expressing these markers (Figures 1A and 1B), implying that the relative number of inhibitory interneurons is normal in L2/3 of V1. Next we investigated the strength and number of inhibitory synapses onto L2/3 pyramidal neurons. Using whole-cell voltage-clamp, we recorded miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents (mIPSCs) in the presence of tetrodotoxin to gauge spontaneous inhibitory synaptic activity onto excitatory L2/3 pyramidal neurons. We recorded mIPSCs at two ages: P25, during the critical period for ocular dominance plasticity and when excitatory deficits have been observed previously, and P80, when the visual cortex is fully mature. We observed no difference in mIPSC amplitude between WT and Ube3am−/p+ mice at either P25 or P80, suggesting that the loss of Ube3a did not change the strength of inhibitory synapses (Figure 1D and Table S1 available online). While we saw no genotypic differences in mIPSC frequency at P25, L2/3 pyramidal neurons in Ube3am−/p+ mice had a reduction in mIPSC frequency by P80 (Figure 1E). These observations indicate that the loss of Ube3a leads to fewer functional inhibitory synapses, or a reduction of their release probability onto L2/3 pyramidal neurons. To further investigate the development of inhibitory inputs onto L2/3 pyramidal neurons, we recorded evoked inhibitory postsynaptic currents (eIPSCs) using L4 stimulation at different intensities in P25 and P80 Ube3am−/p+ and WT mice (Figure 1F). This type of stimulation activates diverse inhibitory inputs and, with strong stimulation, can activate most of the inhibitory inputs onto L2/3 pyramidal neurons (Morales et al., 2002Morales B. Choi S.Y. Kirkwood A. Dark rearing alters the development of GABAergic transmission in visual cortex.J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 8084-8090PubMed Google Scholar). We saw no significant difference in eIPSC amplitude at P25 (Figure 1G), but a large decrease in eIPSC amplitude at P80 in Ube3am−/p+ mice compared to WT (Figure 1H). Together, these results confirm that there is a severe deficit in the amount of inhibition arriving onto L2/3 pyramidal cells in the mature visual cortex of Ube3am−/p+ mice. In principle, a decrease in eIPSC amplitude could arise from reductions in the number of postsynaptic GABA receptors, a decrease in the release probability of inhibitory axon terminals, fewer functional inhibitory synapses, or a depolarized inhibitory interneuron action potential threshold. It is unlikely that the decrease in eIPSC amplitude at P80 is due to a decrease in the number of GABA receptors at active synapses, since the amplitude of mIPSCs was similar in Ube3am−/p+ and WT mice. To assess whether the decrease in eIPSC amplitude is due to the loss of functional synapses or to a decrease in release probability, we examined the paired-pulse ratio of inhibitory inputs. Specifically, we stimulated L4 at varying interpulse intervals to evoke IPSCs in L2/3 pyramidal cells, and compared the paired-pulse ratio in WT and Ube3am−/p+ mice. We observed no difference in the paired-pulse ratio between genotypes at either P25 or P80, implying that release at functional inhibitory inputs onto L2/3 pyramidal cells is normal in response to brief stimuli given at several interpulse intervals (Figure 1I). Finally, we found no difference in the action potential threshold or intrinsic excitability of FS neurons (a major class of inhibitory interneurons) in Ube3am−/p+ mice compared to WT, indicating that reduced eIPSC amplitude is unlikely to be due to reductions in evoked action potentials in inhibitory interneurons (Figures S1A and S1B). By exclusion, our data suggest a reduction in the total number of functional inhibitory synapses. Our previous observations of reduced inhibition were made in Ube3am−/p+ mice on the 129Sv/Ev strain, which are susceptible to spontaneous seizures (Jiang et al., 1998Jiang Y.H. Armstrong D. Albrecht U. Atkins C.M. Noebels J.L. Eichele G. Sweatt J.D. Beaudet A.L.

Decreased hippocampal inhibition and a selective loss of interneurons in experimental epilepsy.Science. 1987; 235: 73-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (881) Google Scholar). To address this concern, we tested for possible synaptic deficits in Ube3am−/p+ mice maintained on the C57BL/6J strain, which have a low incidence of evoked seizures and no reported spontaneous seizures (Jiang et al., 1998Jiang Y.H. Armstrong D. Albrecht U. Atkins C.M. Noebels J.L. Eichele G. Sweatt J.D. Beaudet A.L. Mutation of the Angelman ubiquitin ligase in mice causes increased cytoplasmic p53 and deficits of contextual learning and long-term potentiation.Neuron. 1998; 21: 799-811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar). We performed mIPSC recordings at P80 in WT and Ube3am−/p+ C57BL/6J mice to test if synaptic defects arose in the absence of spontaneous seizures. As before, we observed no genotypic differences in the amplitude of mIPSCs, but a large decrease in mIPSC frequency in Ube3am−/p+ mice (Figure 2A ). We also performed mEPSC recordings in L2/3 pyramidal neurons in mice on the C57BL/6J strain to confirm previous results from the 129Sv/Ev strain (Yashiro et al., 2009Yashiro K. Riday T.T. Condon K.H. Roberts A.C. Bernardo D.R. Prakash R. Weinberg R.J. Ehlers M.D. Philpot B.D. Ube3a is required for experience-dependent maturation of the neocortex.Nat. Neurosci. 2009; 12: 777-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Consistent with previous results, there was a significant decrease in mEPSC frequency, but not amplitude, between Ube3am−/p+ and WT mice (Figure 2B). These observations reveal that Ube3am−/p+ L2/3 pyramidal neurons have a 50% reduction in spontaneous inhibitory synaptic activity, but only a 28% decrease in excitatory synaptic activity. Additionally, intrinsic excitability of L2/3 pyramidal neurons was increased in Ube3am−/p+ mice compared to WT (Figure S1C). Together these data suggest that a disproportionate loss of inhibition may lead to an excitatory/inhibitory imbalance in Ube3am−/p+ L2/3 pyramidal neurons. Ube3a is expressed by both excitatory and inhibitory interneurons in the cerebral cortex (Sato and Stryker, 2010Sato M. Stryker M.P. Genomic imprinting of experience-dependent cortical plasticity by the ubiquitin ligase gene Ube3a.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2010; 107: 5611-5616Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Therefore, Ube3a loss might be expected to affect both neuron classes. To assess this possibility, we recorded spontaneous synaptic activity in fast-spiking (FS) inhibitory interneurons, which we identified by membrane properties, aspinous dendrites, and characteristic high firing rates (Okaty et al., 2009Okaty B.W. Miller M.N. Sugino K. Hempel C.M. Nelson S.B. Transcriptional and electrophysiological maturation of neocortical fast-spiking GABAergic interneurons.J. Neurosci. 2009; 29: 7040-7052Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). FS inhibitory interneurons in L2/3 were targeted for whole-cell recording at P80, an age at which excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission onto L2/3 pyramidal neurons is altered. In contrast to L2/3 pyramidal neurons, the loss of Ube3a did not affect either the amplitude or the frequency of mIPSCs onto FS inhibitory interneurons (Figure 2C). Moreover, excitatory connections onto FS inhibitory interneurons appeared normal, as Ube3a loss did not alter mEPSC amplitude or frequency (Figure 2D). Similar to L2/3, Ube3a loss did not change the frequency or amplitude of mIPSCs or mEPSCs onto L5/6 FS inhibitory interneurons (Figures S2A and S2B). These results imply that Ube3a loss has neuron type-specific synaptic effects. We examined the effects of Ube3a loss on FS inhibitory interneurons, which provide the majority of perisomatic inhibitory input to L2/3 pyramidal neurons (Jiang et al., 2010Jiang B. Huang S. de Pasquale R. Millman D. Song L. Lee H.K. Tsumoto T. Kirkwood A. The maturation of GABAergic transmission in visual cortex requires endocannabinoid-mediated LTD of inhibitory inputs during a critical period.Neuron. 2010; 66: 248-259Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), impart feed-forward and feedback inhibition, and have been implicated in seizure susceptibility (Di Cristo et al., 2004Di Cristo G. Wu C. Chattopadhyaya B. Ango F. Knott G. Welker E. Svoboda K. Huang Z.J. Subcellular domain-restricted GABAergic innervation in primary visual cortex in the absence of sensory and thalamic inputs.Nat. Neurosci. 2004; 7: 1184-1186Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Despite the challenge of performing paired recordings in adult neocortical slices, we were able to investigate synaptic connectivity between 83 pairs of L2/3 FS inhibitory interneurons and L2/3 pyramidal neurons in WT and Ube3am−/p+ mice at P80 (Table S3). We first analyzed synaptic connectivity from FS inhibitory interneurons to pyramidal neurons. Using current-clamp recordings, we evoked action potentials in FS interneurons with depolarizing current injections at 30 Hz, and simultaneously recorded the response in pyramidal neurons (Figure 3A ). To measure short-term plasticity we normalized the amplitude of the evoked IPSPs to the amplitude of the first IPSP in the train. We observed no change in the short-term plasticity between genotypes (Figure 3B). However, the amplitude of the first IPSP between these pairs was significantly decreased in Ube3am−/p+ mice, indicating decreased connection strength from FS inhibitory interneurons to L2/3 pyramidal neurons (Figure 3C). We also found a 31% decrease in connection probability in Ube3am−/p+ mice compared to WT mice (Figure 3D), supporting the conclusion that the decreased IPSP amplitude is likely due to a reduction in the number of functional synapses made from FS interneurons to pyramidal neurons. Finally, we estimated the average inhibitory drive from FS inhibitory interneurons onto L2/3 pyramidal neurons, by calculating the product of connection strength and connection probability, finding that inhibitory drive was reduced by 71% in Ube3am−/p+ mice compared to WT mice (Figure 3E). To further investigate possible effects of Ube3a loss on synaptic connectivity, we examined the connections from L2/3 pyramidal neurons to FS inhibitory interneurons. We measured short-term plasticity and found that Ube3am−/p+ mice had increased facilitation at synapses from pyramidal neuron to FS interneurons (Figure S3B). To assess connection strength in this pathway, we measured the amplitude of the first EPSP evoked in the postsynaptic FS interneuron, detecting no difference between genotypes (Figure S3C). Finally, we found no genotypic difference in the connection probability of L2/3 pyramidal to FS inhibitory interneuron pairs (Figure S3D). These data suggest that, while excitatory connection frequency and strength onto L2/3 FS interneurons are unchanged in Ube3am−/p+ mice, excitatory inputs onto FS inhibitory interneurons have altered short-term plasticity, potentially leading to defective engagement of FS inhibitory interneurons during trains of activity. The unchanged strength of the pyramidal-to-FS inhibitory interneuron connections in Ube3am−/p+ mice was unexpected, since short-term plasticity measurements indicated a change in release probability at this synapse. We conclude that other factors, such as differences in calcium buffering, coupling of calcium channels to release machinery, or vesicular trafficking, must underlie the observed changes (Atwood and Karunanithi, 2002Atwood H.L. Karunanithi S. Diversification of synaptic strength: presynaptic elements.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2002; 3: 497-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Together, these experiments identify a specific inhibitory interneuron subtype, FS inhibitory interneurons, that is at least partially responsible for the decrease in inhibition found in L2/3 pyramidal neurons in the AS model. L2/3 pyramidal neurons receive inhibition from a variety of inhibitory interneuron subtypes (Markram et al., 2004Markram H. Toledo-Rodriguez M. Wang Y. Gupta A. Silberberg G. Wu C. Interneurons of the neocortical inhibitory system.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2004; 5: 793-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (2105) Google Scholar). To test whether inhibitory deficits in Ube3am−/p+ mice could also be ascribed to other types of interneurons, we used agatoxin, a potent irreversible antagonist of P/Q-type voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs), to block release of GABA selectively from FS inhibitory interneurons (Jiang et al., 2010Jiang B. Huang S. de Pasquale R. Millman D. Song L. Lee H.K. Tsumoto T. Kirkwood A. The maturation of GABAergic transmission in visual cortex requires endocannabinoid-mediated LTD of inhibitory inputs during a critical period.Neuron. 2010; 66: 248-259Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Agatoxin suppressed ∼90% of the total eIPSCs in both WT and Ube3am−/p+ mice 20 min after perfusion of the toxin (Figure 3G). The agatoxin-insensitive portion of the eIPSC had an increased latency from stimulation onset and an increased rise time, suggesting that the agatoxin-insensitive inputs targeted the distal dendrites of L2/3 pyramidal neurons (Figures S3G and S3H). Agatoxin-insensitive inputs also had decreased paired-pulse depression compared to the total eIPSC, a signature of non-FS inhibitory interneurons (Figure S3F) (Gupta et al., 2000Gupta A. Wang Y. Markram H. Organizing principles for a diversity of GABAergic interneurons and synapses in the neocortex.Science. 2000; 287: 273-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (812) Google Scholar). After agatoxin perfusion, we recorded eIPSCs at different stimulation intensities and again found a decrease in the strength of inhibitory inputs in the Ube3am−/p+ mice, compared to WT, demonstrating that Ube3a loss also affects inputs from non-FS classes of inhibitory interneurons (Figure 3H). Our electrophysiological data suggest that inhibitory deficits in Ube3am−/p+ mice result from a loss of functional inhibitory synapses onto L2/3 pyramidal neurons. However, a reduction in functional synapses could arise anatomically from fewer synaptic contacts, postsynaptically by a loss of functional receptors, or presynaptically by a severe depletion of releasable synaptic vesicles rendering a subset of inhibitory axon terminals nonfunctional. To test for an anatomical correlate to our functional data, we used immunohistochemistry to stain WT and Ube3am−/p+ mice for the vesicular GABA transporter (VGAT), a marker for the axon terminals of inhibitory interneurons (Chaudhry et al., 1998Chaudhry F.A. Reimer R.J. Bellocchio E.E. Danbolt N.C. Osen K.K. Edwards R.H. Storm-Mathisen J. The vesicular GABA transporter, VGAT, localizes to synaptic vesicles in sets of glycinergic as well as GABAergic neurons.J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 9733-9750Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We were surprised to see similar densities of VGAT-positive puncta in WT and Ube3am−/p+ mice, suggesting no change in the number of inhibitory interneuron axon terminals (Figures S4A–S4C). However, there remained the possibility that some of these axon terminals were nonfunctional. To explore this possibility, we used electron microscopy to examine synaptic structure in WT and Ube3am−/p+ mice. Postembedding immunogold localization of GABA was used to identify inhibitory synapses onto somata in L2/3 of V1. The area of GABA-positive axon terminals and proportion of mitochondria per terminal were not different between WT and Ube3am−/p+ mice (Figures 4A2 and 4A3). However, there was a decrease in the number of synaptic vesicles, and a large increase in the number of clathrin-coated vesicles (CCVs), in the Ube3am−/p+ mice compared to WT (Figures 4A4 and 4A5 and S4F and S4G). We also tested whether the defects we observed in inhibitory synapses were generalized to excitatory synapses. Similar to inhibitory synapses, we observed a decrease in the number of synaptic vesicles, but no change in the area of excitatory axon terminals or the proportion of mitochondria per terminal (Figures 4B1–4B4 and S4D and S4E). Finally, we saw little or no decrease in the number of CCVs at excitatory synapses between genotypes (Figures 4B5 and S4D and S4E). These data suggest a defect in synaptic vesicle cycling in inhibitory synapses of Ube3am−/p+ mice. Previous studies examining synaptic vesicle cycling have identified genes whose mutation leads to increased numbers of CCVs in axon terminals (Slepnev and De Camilli, 2000Slepnev V.I. De Camilli P. Accessory factors in clathrin-dependent synaptic vesicle endocytosis.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2000; 1: 161-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). Many of these mutant synapses maintain the ability to release neurotransmitter and have normal short-term plasticity; however, during periods of high activity these synapses fail to adequately replenish their synaptic vesicle pool, resulting in a delayed recovery to baseline levels of transmitter release (Luthi et al., 2001Luthi A. Di Paolo G. Cremona O. Daniell L. De Camilli P. McCormick D.A. Synaptojanin 1 contributes to maintaining the stability of GABAergic transmission in primary cultures of cortical neurons.J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 9101-9111PubMed Google Scholar). These studies led us to test whether inhibitory synapses in the Ube3am−/p+ mice had functional deficits similar to other synaptic vesicle cycling mutants. We applied a train of 800 stimuli at 10 Hz while recording eIPSCs in L2/3 pyramidal neurons in WT and Ube3am−/p+ mice (Figure 4C). We then decreased the stimulation frequency to 0.33 Hz and recorded the recovery phase of the eIPSC (Figure 4C1). Ube3a loss had no effect on the depletion phase of the eIPSC (Figure 2C2) in agreement with our previous experiments examining short-term plasticity (Figures 1I and 3B). However, we found a large decrease in the rate and level of recovery of the eIPSC in Ube3am−/p+ mice compared to WT (Figure 4C3). These data are consistent with defects in inhibitory synaptic vesicle cycling in Ube3am−/p+ mice. Specifically, the decrease in recovery of the eIPSC, combined with the increase in CCVs, suggests an inability of newly endocytosed CCVs to reenter and replenish the synaptic vesicle pool. These defects may render a subset of inhibitory synapses nonfunctional in Ube3am−/p+ mice. Finally, we challenged excitatory synapses with the same high frequency stimulation protocol that we used to test inhibitory synapses (Figure 4D1). Unlike inhibitory synapses, Ube3a loss did not have an effect on the recovery of excitatory synapses from high-frequency stimulation (Figure 4D3). Thus, the pronounced accumulation of CCVs observed at inhibitory synapses correlates well with the selective deficits in the synaptic recovery from high-frequency stimulation. Moreover, these functional data demonstrate that a period of heightened excitatory/inhibitory imbalance may occur following a high-frequency train of activity in this circuit. This work demonstrates that maternal loss of Ube3a, as seen in individuals with AS, leads to neuron type-specific synaptic deficits. Our findings suggest that loss of Ube3a can result in an excitatory/inhibitory imbalance in the neocortex. Earlier studies showing decreased excitatory neurotransmission in Ube3am−/p+ mice were difficult to reconcile with reports of high seizure susceptibility (Jiang et al., 1998Jiang Y.H. Armstrong D. Albrecht U. Atkins C.M. Noebels J.L. Eichele G. Sweatt J.D. Beaudet A.L.

Neurosci. 2009; 12: 777-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Our data provides clarification, showing that the loss of Ube3a causes a particularly severe decrease in inhibitory input to L2/3 pyramidal neurons. We also report that AS model mice have a synaptic vesicle cycling defect, which suggests a basis for this deficit. The vesicle cycling defects we observe are similar to those observed after deletion of the presynaptic proteins synaptojanin (Cremona et al., 1999Cremona O. Di Paolo G. Wenk M.R. Lüthi A. Kim W.T.

Notably, inhibitory synapses may be particularly sensitive to disruptions in vesicular trafficking, due to their enhanced activity and smaller vesicle pools (Hayashi et al., 2008Hayashi M. Raimondi A. O'Toole E. Paradise S. Collesi C. Cremona O. Ferguson S.M. De Camilli P. Cell- and stimulus-dependent heterogeneity of synaptic vesicle endocytic recycling mechanisms revealed by studies of dynamin 1-null neurons.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2008; 105: 2175-2180Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). These results, combined with our functional studies describing defective inhibitory synaptic transmission in Ube3am−/p+ mice, suggest a means by which a hyperexcitable cortical circuit could arise despite fewer excitatory synapses. Ube3a is present in both excitatory and inhibitory interneurons in the brain (Sato and Stryker, 2010Sato M. Stryker M.P. Genomic imprinting of experience-dependent cortical plasticity by the ubiquitin ligase gene Ube3a.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2010; 107: 5611-5616Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Our results showing different synaptic defects onto excitatory and inhibitory neurons indicate Ube3a deficiency causes neuron type-specific deficits. Since Ube3a targets its substrate proteins for proteasomal degradation, the consequences of Ube3a loss may depend on which substrate proteins are normally present in a cell. This hypothesis is supported by recent work showing that Arc, a protein expressed postsynaptically in excitatory but not inhibitory interneurons, is a Ube3a substrate (Greer et al., 2010Greer P.L. Hanayama R. Bloodgood B.L. Mardinly A.R. Lipton D.M. Flavell S.W. Kim T.K. Griffith E.C. Waldon Z.

Shepherd J.D. Tropea D. Wang K.H. Bear M.F. Sur M. Loss of Arc renders the visual cortex impervious to the effects of sensory experience or deprivation.Nat. Neurosci. 2010; 13: 450-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Thus, the loss of Ube3a is expected to cause an inappropriate overexpression of Arc in excitatory neurons without affecting inhibitory interneurons. Given the ability of Arc to influence AMPA receptor endocytosis (Chowdhury et al., 2006Chowdhury S. Shepherd J.D. Okuno H. Lyford G. Petralia R.S. Plath N. Kuhl D. Huganir R.L. Worley P.F. Arc/Arg3.1 interacts with the endocytic machinery to regulate AMPA receptor trafficking.Neuron. 2006; 52: 445-459Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar), the neuron type-specific expression of Arc could partly explain the excitatory synaptic defects observed onto L2/3 pyramidal neurons and the lack of effect in FS interneurons. Conversely, our findings suggest a synaptic defect in Ube3am−/p+ mice at inhibitory synapses, primarily affecting presynaptic function at inhibitory synapses and resulting in fewer functional synapses. Intriguingly, the observed excitatory and inhibitory defects both involve endocytic processes, albeit at different sides of the synaptic cleft, suggesting that common processes may be involved. Altered function of GABA receptors and/or inhibitory interneurons has been hypothesized to underlie many of the phenotypes seen in AS (Dan and Boyd, 2003Dan B. Boyd S.G. Angelman syndrome reviewed from a neurophysiological perspective. The UBE3A-GABRB3 hypothesis.Neuropediatrics. 2003; 34: 169-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). While attention has focused on how defects in GABAergic neurotransmission may relate to epileptic phenotypes in AS, abnormalities in inhibition can have wide-ranging consequences, including disrupting synaptic plasticity, cortical network oscillations, and cortical circuit architecture (Cardin et al., 2009Cardin J.A. Carlén M. Meletis K. Knoblich U. Zhang F. Deisseroth K. Tsai L.H. Moore C.I.

Critical period plasticity in local cortical circuits.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2005; 6: 877-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (1557) Google Scholar). For example, FS inhibitory interneurons have a critical role in ocular dominance plasticity (Hensch et al., 1998Hensch T.K. Fagiolini M. Mataga N. Stryker M.P. Baekkeskov S. Kash S.F. Local GABA circuit control of experience-dependent plasticity in developing visual cortex.Science. 1998; 282: 1504-1508Crossref PubMed Scopus (725) Google Scholar), which is severely reduced in Ube3am−/p+ mice (Sato and Stryker, 2010Sato M. Stryker M.P. Genomic imprinting of experience-dependent cortical plasticity by the ubiquitin ligase gene Ube3a.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2010; 107: 5611-5616Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, Yashiro et al., 2009Yashiro K. Riday T.T. Condon K.H. Roberts A.C. Bernardo D.R. Prakash R. Weinberg R.J.

Our finding that inhibitory interneuron to L2/3 pyramidal neuron connections are altered in Ube3am−/p+ mice may prove important for understanding the mechanisms underlying plasticity and learning defects in AS. Understanding the specific synaptic impairments caused by the global loss of Ube3a may provide insights into the intractable nature of seizures found in many individuals with AS. Excitatory/inhibitory imbalance has been observed in several genetic disorders that meet diagnostic criteria for autism spectrum disorders, including neuroligin-3 mutation, Fragile X, and Rett syndrome (Dani et al., 2005Dani V.S. Chang Q. Maffei A. Turrigiano G.G. Jaenisch R. Nelson S.B. Reduced cortical activity due to a shift in the balance between excitation and inhibition in a mouse model of Rett syndrome.Proc. Natl.

Moreover, excitatory/inhibitory imbalance may be a general neurophysiological feature of autism spectrum disorders, contributing to inappropriate detection or integration of salient sensory information due to a decreased signal-to-noise ratio (Rubenstein and Merzenich, 2003Rubenstein J.L.

https://openalex.org/W2087656399,"Due to its extreme salinity and high Mg concentration the Dead Sea is characterized by a very low density of cells most of which are Archaea. We discovered several underwater fresh to brackish water springs in the Dead Sea harboring dense microbial communities. We provide the first characterization of these communities, discuss their possible origin, hydrochemical environment, energetic resources and the putative biogeochemical pathways they are mediating. Pyrosequencing of the 16S rRNA gene and community fingerprinting methods showed that the spring community originates from the Dead Sea sediments and not from the aquifer. Furthermore, it suggested that there is a dense Archaeal community in the shoreline pore water of the lake. Sequences of bacterial sulfate reducers, nitrifiers iron oxidizers and iron reducers were identified as well. Analysis of white and green biofilms suggested that sulfide oxidation through chemolitotrophy and phototrophy is highly significant. Hyperspectral analysis showed a tight association between abundant green sulfur bacteria and cyanobacteria in the green biofilms. Together, our findings show that the Dead Sea floor harbors diverse microbial communities, part of which is not known from other hypersaline environments. Analysis of the water's chemistry shows evidence of microbial activity along the path and suggests that the springs supply nitrogen, phosphorus and organic matter to the microbial communities in the Dead Sea. The underwater springs are a newly recognized water source for the Dead Sea. Their input of microorganisms and nutrients needs to be considered in the assessment of possible impact of dilution events of the lake surface waters, such as those that will occur in the future due to the intended establishment of the Red Sea-Dead Sea water conduit."
https://openalex.org/W2019920909,"Pandemic H1N1 influenza A (H1N1pdm) is currently a dominant circulating influenza strain worldwide. Severe cases of H1N1pdm infection are characterized by prolonged activation of the immune response, yet the specific role of inflammatory mediators in disease is poorly understood. The inflammatory cytokine IL-6 has been implicated in both seasonal and severe pandemic H1N1 influenza A (H1N1pdm) infection. Here, we investigated the role of IL-6 in severe H1N1pdm infection. We found IL-6 to be an important feature of the host response in both humans and mice infected with H1N1pdm. Elevated levels of IL-6 were associated with severe disease in patients hospitalized with H1N1pdm infection. Notably, serum IL-6 levels associated strongly with the requirement of critical care admission and were predictive of fatal outcome. In C57BL/6J, BALB/cJ, and B6129SF2/J mice, infection with A/Mexico/4108/2009 (H1N1pdm) consistently triggered severe disease and increased IL-6 levels in both lung and serum. Furthermore, in our lethal C57BL/6J mouse model of H1N1pdm infection, global gene expression analysis indicated a pronounced IL-6 associated inflammatory response. Subsequently, we examined disease and outcome in IL-6 deficient mice infected with H1N1pdm. No significant differences in survival, weight loss, viral load, or pathology were observed between IL-6 deficient and wild-type mice following infection. Taken together, our findings suggest IL-6 may be a potential disease severity biomarker, but may not be a suitable therapeutic target in cases of severe H1N1pdm infection due to our mouse data."
https://openalex.org/W2015574237,"Using light and serial electron microscopy, we show profound refinements in motor axonal branching and synaptic connectivity before and after birth. Embryonic axons become maximally connected just before birth when they innervate ∼10-fold more muscle fibers than in maturity. In some developing muscles, axons innervate almost every muscle fiber. At birth, each neuromuscular junction is coinnervated by approximately ten highly intermingled axons (versus one in adults). Extensive die off of terminal branches occurs during the first several postnatal days, leading to much sparser arbors that still span the same territory. Despite the extensive pruning, total axoplasm per neuron increases as axons elongate, thicken, and add more synaptic release sites on their remaining targets. Motor axons therefore initially establish weak connections with nearly all available postsynaptic targets but, beginning at birth, massively redistribute synaptic resources, concentrating many more synaptic sites on many fewer muscle fibers. Analogous changes in connectivity may occur in the CNS."
https://openalex.org/W2050896965,"The health of the coral reefs of the Abrolhos Bank (southwestern Atlantic) was characterized with a holistic approach using measurements of four ecosystem components: (i) inorganic and organic nutrient concentrations, [1] fish biomass, [1] macroalgal and coral cover and (iv) microbial community composition and abundance. The possible benefits of protection from fishing were particularly evaluated by comparing sites with varying levels of protection. Two reefs within the well-enforced no-take area of the National Marine Park of Abrolhos (Parcel dos Abrolhos and California) were compared with two unprotected coastal reefs (Sebastião Gomes and Pedra de Leste) and one legally protected but poorly enforced coastal reef (the “paper park” of Timbebas Reef). The fish biomass was lower and the fleshy macroalgal cover was higher in the unprotected reefs compared with the protected areas. The unprotected and protected reefs had similar seawater chemistry. Lower vibrio CFU counts were observed in the fully protected area of California Reef. Metagenome analysis showed that the unprotected reefs had a higher abundance of archaeal and viral sequences and more bacterial pathogens, while the protected reefs had a higher abundance of genes related to photosynthesis. Similar to other reef systems in the world, there was evidence that reductions in the biomass of herbivorous fishes and the consequent increase in macroalgal cover in the Abrolhos Bank may be affecting microbial diversity and abundance. Through the integration of different types of ecological data, the present study showed that protection from fishing may lead to greater reef health. The data presented herein suggest that protected coral reefs have higher microbial diversity, with the most degraded reef (Sebastião Gomes) showing a marked reduction in microbial species richness. It is concluded that ecological conditions in unprotected reefs may promote the growth and rapid evolution of opportunistic microbial pathogens."
https://openalex.org/W2051947642,"Flowering is an important agronomic trait that determines crop yield. Soybean is a major oilseed legume crop used for human and animal feed. Legumes have unique vegetative and floral complexities. Our understanding of the molecular basis of flower initiation and development in legumes is limited. Here, we address this by using a computational approach to examine flowering regulatory genes in the soybean genome in comparison to the most studied model plant, Arabidopsis. For this comparison, a genome-wide analysis of orthologue groups was performed, followed by an in silico gene expression analysis of the identified soybean flowering genes. Phylogenetic analyses of the gene families highlighted the evolutionary relationships among these candidates. Our study identified key flowering genes in soybean and indicates that the vernalisation and the ambient-temperature pathways seem to be the most variant in soybean. A comparison of the orthologue groups containing flowering genes indicated that, on average, each Arabidopsis flowering gene has 2-3 orthologous copies in soybean. Our analysis highlighted that the CDF3, VRN1, SVP, AP3 and PIF3 genes are paralogue-rich genes in soybean. Furthermore, the genome mapping of the soybean flowering genes showed that these genes are scattered randomly across the genome. A paralogue comparison indicated that the soybean genes comprising the largest orthologue group are clustered in a 1.4 Mb region on chromosome 16 of soybean. Furthermore, a comparison with the undomesticated soybean (Glycine soja) revealed that there are hundreds of SNPs that are associated with putative soybean flowering genes and that there are structural variants that may affect the genes of the light-signalling and ambient-temperature pathways in soybean. Our study provides a framework for the soybean flowering pathway and insights into the relationship and evolution of flowering genes between a short-day soybean and the long-day plant, Arabidopsis."
https://openalex.org/W2028304954,"Predatory aquatic insects are a diverse group comprising top predators in small fishless water bodies. Knowledge of their diet composition is fragmentary, which hinders the understanding of mechanisms maintaining their high local diversity and of their impacts on local food web structure and dynamics. We conducted multiple-choice predation experiments using nine common species of predatory aquatic insects, including adult and larval Coleoptera, adult Heteroptera and larval Odonata, and complemented them with literature survey of similar experiments. All predators in our experiments fed selectively on the seven prey species offered, and vulnerability to predation varied strongly between the prey. The predators most often preferred dipteran larvae; previous studies further reported preferences for cladocerans. Diet overlaps between all predator pairs and predator overlaps between all prey pairs were non-zero. Modularity analysis separated all primarily nectonic predator and prey species from two groups of large and small benthic predators and their prey. These results, together with limited evidence from the literature, suggest a highly interconnected food web with several modules, in which similarly sized predators from the same microhabitat are likely to compete strongly for resources in the field (observed Pianka's diet overlap indices >0.85). Our experiments further imply that ontogenetic diet shifts are common in predatory aquatic insects, although we observed higher diet overlaps than previously reported. Hence, individuals may or may not shift between food web modules during ontogeny."

Living with a stoma is a challenge, not only for the patient and their carers, but also for society as a whole. Due to methodological problems of PSC assessment, the associated health-economic burden of medium to longterm complications has been poorly described.The aim of the present study was to create a model to estimate treatment costs of PSCs using the standardized assessment Ostomy Skin Tool as a reference. The resultant model was applied to a real-life global data set of stoma patients (n = 3017) to determine the prevalence and financial burden of PSCs.Eleven experienced stoma care nurses were interviewed to get a global understanding of a treatment algorithm that formed the basis of the cost analysis. The estimated costs were based on a seven week treatment period. PSC costs were estimated for five underlying diagnostic categories and three levels of severity. The estimated treatment costs of severe cases of PSCs were increased 2-5 fold for the different diagnostic categories of PSCs compared with mild cases. French unit costs were applied to the global data set.The estimated total average cost for a seven week treatment period (including appliances and accessories) was 263€ for those with PSCs (n = 1742) compared to 215€ for those without PSCs (n = 1172). A co-variance analysis showed that leakage level had a significant impact on PSC cost from 'rarely/never' to 'always/often' p<0.00001 and from 'rarely/never' to 'sometimes' p = 0.0115.PSCs are common and troublesome and the consequences are substantial, both for the patient and from a health economic viewpoint. PSCs should be diagnosed and treated at an early stage to prevent long term, debilitating and expensive complications."

In the present study, the effect of H(2)S on the proliferation of normal and cancerous colon epithelial cells was investigated. An immortalized colon epithelial cell line (YAMC) and a panel of colon cancer cell lines (HT-29, SW1116, HCT116) were exposed to H(2)S at concentrations similar to those found in the human colon. H(2)S inhibited normal and cancerous colon epithelial cell proliferation as measured by MTT assay. The anti-mitogenic effect of H(2)S was accompanied by G(1)-phase cell cycle arrest and the induction of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21(Cip). Moreover, exposure to H(2)S led to features characteristic of autophagy, including increased formation of LC3B(+) autophagic vacuoles and acidic vesicular organelles as determined by immunofluorescence and acridine orange staining, respectively. Abolition of autophagy by RNA interference targeting Vps34 or Atg7 enhanced the anti-proliferative effect of H(2)S. Further mechanistic investigation revealed that H(2)S stimulated the phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and inhibited the phosphorylation of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and S6 kinase. Inhibition of AMPK significantly reversed H(2)S-induced autophagy and inhibition of cell proliferation. Collectively, we demonstrate that H(2)S inhibits colon epithelial cell proliferation and induces protective autophagy via the AMPK pathway."

CD8+ T cells are an important component of the cell mediated immune (CMI) response against S. Typhi. Recently, interleukin (IL)-17A has been shown to contribute to mucosal immunity and protection against intracellular pathogens. To investigate multifunctional IL-17A responses against S. Typhi antigens in T memory subsets, we developed multiparametric flow cytometry methods to detect up to 6 cytokines/chemokines (IL-10, IL-17A, IL-2, interferon-γ (IFN-γ), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and macrophage inflammatory protein-1β (MIP-1β)) simultaneously. Five volunteers were immunized with a 4 dose regimen of live-attenuated S. Typhi vaccine (Ty21a), peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were isolated before and at 11 time points after immunization, and CMI responses were evaluated. Of the 5 immunized volunteers studied, 3 produced detectable CD8+ T cell responses following stimulation with S. Typhi-infected autologous B lymphoblastoid cell lines (B-LCL). Additionally, 2 volunteers had detectable levels of intracellular cytokines in response to stimulation with S. Typhi-infected HLA-E restricted cells. Although the kinetics of the responses differed among volunteers, all of the responses were bi- or tri-phasic and included multifunctional CD8+ T cells. Virtually all of the IL-17A detected was derived from multifunctional CD8+ T cells. The presence of these multifunctional IL-17A+ CD8+ T cells was confirmed using an unsupervised analysis program, flow cytometry clustering without K (FLOCK). This is the first report of IL-17A production in response to S. Typhi in humans, indicating the presence of a Tc17 response which may be important in protection. The presence of IL-17A in multifunctional cells co-producing Tc1 cytokines (IL-2, IFN-γ and TNF-α) may also indicate that the distinction between Tc17 and Tc1 responses in humans is not as clearly delineated as suggested by in vitro experiments and animal models."

Among patients with HER2-enriched tumors there was a significant benefit in both DFS and OS (log-rank test; p = 0.021 and p = 0.006, respectively) for those treated with paclitaxel. The subtype classification was found to be of both predictive and prognostic value. Setting luminal A as the referent category, the adjusted for prognostic factors HR for relapse for patients with TNBC was 1.91 (95% CI: 1.31-2.80, Wald's p = 0.001) and for death 2.53 (95% CI: 1.62-3.60, p<0.001). Site of and time to first relapse differed according to subtype. Locoregional relapses and brain metastases were more frequent in patients with TNBC, while liver metastases were more often seen in patients with HER2-enriched tumors.Triple-negative phenotype is of adverse prognostic value for DFS and OS in patients treated with adjuvant dose-dense sequential chemotherapy. In the pre-trastuzumab era, the HER2-enriched subtype predicts favorable outcome following paclitaxel-containing treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2027597645,"Background Glutaminase is expressed in most mammalian tissues and cancer cells, but the regulation of its expression is poorly understood. An essential step to accomplish this goal is the characterization of its species- and cell-specific isoenzyme pattern of expression. Our aim was to identify and characterize transcript variants of the mammalian glutaminase Gls2 gene. Methodology/Principal Findings We demonstrate for the first time simultaneous expression of two transcript variants from the Gls2 gene in human, rat and mouse. A combination of RT-PCR, primer-extension analysis, bioinformatics, real-time PCR, in vitro transcription and translation and immunoblot analysis was applied to investigate GLS2 transcripts in mammalian tissues. Short (LGA) and long (GAB) transcript forms were isolated in brain and liver tissue of human, rat and mouse. The short LGA transcript arises by a combination of two mechanisms of transcriptional modulation: alternative transcription initiation and alternative promoter. The LGA variant contains both the transcription start site (TSS) and the alternative promoter in the first intron of the Gls2 gene. The full human LGA transcript has two in-frame ATGs in the first exon, which are missing in orthologous rat and mouse transcripts. In vitro transcription and translation of human LGA yielded two polypeptides of the predicted size, but only the canonical full-length protein displayed catalytic activity. Relative abundance of GAB and LGA transcripts showed marked variations depending on species and tissues analyzed. Conclusions/Significance This is the first report demonstrating expression of alternative transcripts of the mammalian Gls2 gene. Transcriptional mechanisms giving rise to GLS2 variants and isolation of novel GLS2 transcripts in human, rat and mouse are presented. Results were also confirmed at the protein level, where catalytic activity was demonstrated for the human LGA protein. Relative abundance of GAB and LGA transcripts was species- and tissue-specific providing evidence of a differential regulation of GLS2 transcripts in mammals."
https://openalex.org/W2084934743,"The G-protein coupled estrogen receptor 30 (GPR30) is a seven-transmembrane domain receptor that mediates rapid estrogen responses in a wide variety of cell types. This receptor is highly expressed in the cardiovascular system, and exerts vasodilatory effects. The objective of the present study was to investigate the effects of GPR30 on vascular responsiveness in diabetic ovariectomized (OVX) rats and elucidate the possible mechanism involved. The roles of GPR30 were evaluated in the thoracic aorta and cultured endothelial cells. The GPR30 agonist G1 induced a dose-dependent vasodilation in the thoracic aorta of the diabetic OVX rats, which was partially attenuated by the nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitor, nitro-L-arginine methylester (L-NAME) and the GPR30-selective antagonist G15. Dose-dependent vasoconstrictive responses to phenylephrine were attenuated significantly in the rings of the thoracic aorta following the acute G1 administration in the diabetic OVX rats. This effect of G1 was abolished partially by L-NAME and G15. The acute administration of G1 increased significantly the eNOS activity and the concentration of NO in the endothelial cells exposed to high glucose. G1 treatment induced an enhanced endothelium-dependent relaxation to acetylcholine (Ach) in the diabetic OVX rats. Further examination revealed that G1 induced vasodilation in the diabetic OVX rats by increasing the phosphorylation of eNOS. These findings provide preliminary evidence that GPR30 activation leads to eNOS activation, as well as vasodilation, to a certain degree and has beneficial effects on vascular function in diabetic OVX rats."
https://openalex.org/W2077298047,"Polymorphonuclear cells (neutrophils) play an important role in the systemic inflammatory response syndrome and the development of sepsis. These cells are essential for the defense against microorganisms, but may also cause tissue damage. Therefore, neutrophil numbers and activity are considered to be tightly regulated. Previous studies have investigated gene transcription during experimental endotoxemia in whole blood and peripheral blood mononuclear cells. However, the gene transcription response of the circulating pool of neutrophils to systemic inflammatory stimulation in vivo is currently unclear. We examined neutrophil gene transcription kinetics in healthy human subjects (n = 4) administered a single dose of endotoxin (LPS, 2 ng/kg iv). In addition, freshly isolated neutrophils were stimulated ex vivo with LPS, TNFα, G-CSF and GM-CSF to identify stimulus-specific gene transcription responses. Whole transcriptome microarray analysis of circulating neutrophils at 2, 4 and 6 hours after LPS infusion revealed activation of inflammatory networks which are involved in signaling of TNFα and IL-1α and IL-1β. The transcriptome profile of inflammatory activated neutrophils in vivo reflects extended survival and regulation of inflammatory responses. These changes in neutrophil transcriptome suggest a combination of early activation of circulating neutrophils by TNFα and G-CSF and a mobilization of young neutrophils from the bone marrow."
https://openalex.org/W2027772087,"The antifungal activity of allicin and its synergistic effects with the antifungal agents flucytosine and amphotericin B (AmB) were investigated in Candida albicans (C. albicans). C. albicans was treated with different conditions of compounds alone and in combination (allicin, AmB, flucytosine, allicin + AmB, allicin + flucytosine, allicin + AmB + flucytosine). After a 24-hour treatment, cells were examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) to measure morphological and biophysical properties associated with cell death. The clearing assay was conducted to confirm the effects of allicin. The viability of C. albicans treated by allicin alone or with one antifungal drug (AmB, flucytosine) in addition was more than 40% after a 24-hr treatment, but the viability of groups treated with combinations of more than two drugs was less than 32%. When the cells were treated with allicin alone or one type of drug, the morphology of the cells did not change noticeably, but when cells were treated with combinations of drugs, there were noticeable morphological changes. In particular, cells treated with allicin + AmB had significant membrane damage (burst or collapsed membranes). Classification of cells according to their cell death phase (CDP) allowed us to determine the relationship between cell viability and treatment conditions in detail. The adhesive force was decreased by the treatment in all groups compare to the control. Cells treated with AmB + allicin had a greater adhesive force than cells treated with AmB alone because of the secretion of molecules due to collapsed membranes. All cells treated with allicin or drugs were softer than the control cells. These results suggest that allicin can reduce MIC of AmB while keeping the same efficacy."
https://openalex.org/W1988636106,"The achievement of a robust, effective and responsible form of data sharing is currently regarded as a priority for biological and bio-medical research. Empirical evaluations of data sharing may be regarded as an indispensable first step in the identification of critical aspects and the development of strategies aimed at increasing availability of research data for the scientific community as a whole. Research concerning human genetic variation represents a potential forerunner in the establishment of widespread sharing of primary datasets. However, no specific analysis has been conducted to date in order to ascertain whether the sharing of primary datasets is common-practice in this research field. To this aim, we analyzed a total of 543 mitochondrial and Y chromosomal datasets reported in 508 papers indexed in the Pubmed database from 2008 to 2011. A substantial portion of datasets (21.9%) was found to have been withheld, while neither strong editorial policies nor high impact factor proved to be effective in increasing the sharing rate beyond the current figure of 80.5%. Disaggregating datasets for research fields, we could observe a substantially lower sharing in medical than evolutionary and forensic genetics, more evident for whole mtDNA sequences (15.0% vs 99.6%). The low rate of positive responses to e-mail requests sent to corresponding authors of withheld datasets (28.6%) suggests that sharing should be regarded as a prerequisite for final paper acceptance, while making authors deposit their results in open online databases which provide data quality control seems to provide the best-practice standard. Finally, we estimated that 29.8% to 32.9% of total resources are used to generate withheld datasets, implying that an important portion of research funding does not produce shared knowledge. By making the scientific community and the public aware of this important aspect, we may help popularize a more effective culture of data sharing."
https://openalex.org/W2121213440,"Stripe rust, leaf rust, tan spot, and Karnal bunt are economically significant diseases impacting wheat production. The objectives of this study were to identify quantitative trait loci for resistance to these diseases in a recombinant inbred line (RIL) from a cross HD29/WH542, and to evaluate the evidence for the presence loci on chromosome region conferring multiple disease resistance.The RIL population was evaluated for four diseases and genotyped with DNA markers. Multi-trait (MT) analysis revealed thirteen QTLs on nine chromosomes, significantly associated with resistance. Phenotypic variation explained by all significant QTLs for KB, TS, Yr, Lr diseases were 57%, 55%, 38% and 22%, respectively. Marginal trait analysis identified the most significant QTLs for resistance to KB on chromosomes 1BS, 2DS, 3BS, 4BL, 5BL, and 5DL. Chromosomes 3AS and 4BL showed significant association with TS resistance. Significant QTLs for Yr resistance were identified on chromosomes 2AS, 4BL and 5BL, while Lr was significant on 6DS. MT analysis revealed that all the QTLs except 3BL significantly reduce KB and was contributed from parent HD29 while all resistant QTLs for TS except on chromosomes 2DS.1, 2DS.2 and 3BL came from WH542. Five resistant QTLs for Yr and six for Lr were contributed from parents WH542 and HD29 respectively. Chromosome region on 4BL showed significant association to KB, TS, and Yr in the population. The multi environment analysis for KB identified three putative QTLs of which two new QTLs, mapped on chromosomes 3BS and 5DL explained 10 and 20% of the phenotypic variation, respectively.This study revealed that MT analysis is an effective tool for detection of multi-trait QTLs for disease resistance. This approach is a more effective and practical than individual QTL mapping analyses. MT analysis identified RILs that combine resistance to multiple diseases from parents WH542 and/or HD29."
https://openalex.org/W2046787124,"The sensitivity of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) for detecting microstructural white matter alterations has motivated the application of voxel-based statistics (VBS) to fractional anisotropy (FA) images (FA-VBS). However, detected group differences may depend on the spatial registration method used. The objective of this study was to investigate the influence of spatial registration on detecting cerebral asymmetries in FA-VBS analyses with reference to data obtained using Tract-Based Spatial Statistics (TBSS). In the first part of this study we performed FA-VBS analyses using three single-contrast and one multi-contrast registration: (i) whole-brain registration based on T2 contrast, (ii) whole-brain registration based on FA contrast, (iii) individual-hemisphere registration based on FA contrast, and (iv) a combination of (i) and (iii). We then compared the FA-VBS results with those obtained from TBSS. We found that the FA-VBS results depended strongly on the employed registration approach, with the best correspondence between FA-VBS and TBSS results when approach (iv), the “multi-contrast individual-hemisphere” method was employed. In the second part of the study, we investigated the spatial distribution of residual misregistration for each registration approach and the effect on FA-VBS results. For the FA-VBS analyses using the three single-contrast registration methods, we identified FA asymmetries that were (a) located in regions prone to misregistrations, (b) not detected by TBSS, and (c) specific to the applied registration approach. These asymmetries were considered candidates for apparent FA asymmetries due to systematic misregistrations associated with the FA-VBS approach. Finally, we demonstrated that the “multi-contrast individual-hemisphere” approach showed the least residual spatial misregistrations and thus might be most appropriate for cerebral FA-VBS analyses."
https://openalex.org/W2152223198,"Congenital hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (CHH) is characterized by low gonadotropins and failure to progress normally through puberty. Mutations in the gene encoding the GnRH receptor (GNRHR1) result in CHH when present as compound heterozygous or homozygous inactivating mutations. This study identifies and characterizes the properties of two novel GNRHR1 mutations in a family in which three brothers display normosmic CHH while their sister was unaffected. Molecular analysis in the proband and the affected brothers revealed two novel non-synonymous missense GNRHR1 mutations, present in a compound heterozygous state, whereas their unaffected parents possessed only one inactivating mutation, demonstrating the autosomal recessive transmission in this kindred and excluding X-linked inheritance equivocally suggested by the initial pedigree analysis. The first mutation at c.845 C>G introduces an Arg substitution for the conserved Pro 282 in transmembrane domain (TMD) 6. The Pro282Arg mutant is unable to bind radiolabeled GnRH analogue. As this conserved residue is important in receptor conformation, it is likely that the mutation perturbs the binding pocket and affects trafficking to the cell surface. The second mutation at c.968 A>G introduces a Cys substitution for Tyr 323 in the functionally crucial N/DPxxY motif in TMD 7. The Tyr323Cys mutant has an increased GnRH binding affinity but reduced receptor expression at the plasma membrane and impaired G protein-coupling. Inositol phosphate accumulation assays demonstrated absent and impaired Gα(q/11) signal transduction by Pro282Arg and Tyr323Cys mutants, respectively. Pretreatment with the membrane permeant GnRHR antagonist NBI-42902, which rescues cell surface expression of many GNRHR1 mutants, significantly increased the levels of radioligand binding and intracellular signaling of the Tyr323Cys mutant but not Pro282Arg. Immunocytochemistry confirmed that both mutants are present on the cell membrane albeit at low levels. Together these molecular deficiencies of the two novel GNRHR1 mutations lead to the CHH phenotype when present as a compound heterozygote."
https://openalex.org/W2074739802,"Background Generalist herbivores are challenged not only by the low nitrogen and high indigestibility of their plant foods, but also by physical and chemical defenses of plants. This study investigated the foods of wild parrots in the Peruvian Amazon and asked whether these foods contain dietary components that are limiting for generalist herbivores (protein, lipids, minerals) and in what quantity; whether parrots chose foods based on nutrient content; and whether parrots avoid plants that are chemically defended. Methodology/Principal Findings We made 224 field observations of free-ranging parrots of 17 species in 8 genera foraging on 102 species of trees in an undisturbed tropical rainforest, in two dry seasons (July-August 1992–1993) and one wet season (January-February1994). We performed laboratory analyses of parts of plants eaten and not eaten by parrots and brine shrimp assays of toxicity as a proxy for vertebrates. Parrots ate seeds, fruits, flowers, leaves, bark, and insect larvae, but up to 70% of their diet comprised seeds of many species of tropical trees, in various stages of ripeness. Plant parts eaten by parrots were rich in protein, lipid, and essential minerals, as well as potentially toxic chemicals. Seeds were higher than other plant materials in protein and lipid and lower in fiber. Large macaws of three species ate foods higher in protein and lipids and lower in fiber compared to plant parts available but not eaten. Macaws ate foods that were lower in phenolic compounds than foods they avoided. Nevertheless, foods eaten by macaws contained measurable levels of toxicity. Macaws did not appear to make dietary selections based on mineral content. Conclusions/Significance Parrots represent a remarkable example of a generalist herbivore that consumes seeds destructively despite plant chemical defenses. With the ability to eat toxic foods, rainforest-dwelling parrots exploited a diversity of nutritious foods, even in the dry season when food was scarce for other frugivores and granivores."
https://openalex.org/W1989095713,"The tumor suppressor p53 has a crucial role in the DNA damage response. Here, we proposed an integrated model of the p53 network and explored how the nuclear and mitochondrial p53 pathways are coordinated to determine cell fates after -irradiation in radiosensitive tissues. Using numerical simulations, we found that depending on the extent of DNA damage, cells may survive, commit apoptosis after cell cycle arrest, or undergo apoptosis soon after irradiation. There exists a large cell-to-cell variability in outcome because of stochasticity in the generation and repair of DNA damage as well as cellular heterogeneity. At the cell population level, there occur two waves of apoptosis: a fast wave mediated by mitochondrial p53 within three hours postirradiation, and a slow wave mediated by nuclear p53 after eight hours postirradiation. Thus, we propose a two-step mechanism for cell fate decision. The first step is to decide whether DNA damage is severe enough to trigger apoptosis directly through the mitochondrial p53 pathway, while the second step is to determine whether the damage is fixed after cell cycle arrest. Such a mechanism may represent an efficient and reliable control mode, avoiding unnecessary death or greatly promoting the execution of apoptosis. It was also demonstrated that nuclear p53 can inhibit the pro-apoptotic activity of mitochondrial p53 by transactivating p21, and Mdm2 can facilitate apoptosis by promoting the mono-ubiquitination of p53. These results are either in good agreement with experimental observations or experimentally testable. Our work suggests that both the transcription-independent and -dependent p53 activities are indispensable for a reliable choice of cell fate and also provides clues to therapeutic manipulation of the p53 pathway in cancer treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2139977117,"Background Comorbidity is often mentioned as interfering with “optimal” treatment decisions in diabetes care. It is suggested that diabetes-related comorbidity will increase adequate treatment, whereas diabetes-unrelated comorbidity may decrease this process of care. We hypothesized that these effects differ according to expected priority of the conditions. Methods We evaluated the relationship between comorbidity and treatment intensification in a study of 11,248 type 2 diabetes patients using the GIANTT (Groningen Initiative to Analyse type 2 diabetes Treatment) database. We formed a cohort of patients with a systolic blood pressure ≥140 mmHg (6,820 hypertensive diabetics), and a cohort of patients with an HbA1c ≥7% (3,589 hyperglycemic diabetics) in 2007. We differentiated comorbidity by diabetes-related or unrelated conditions and by priority. High priority conditions include conditions that are life-interfering, incident or requiring new medication treatment. We performed Cox regression analyses to assess association with treatment intensification, defined as dose increase, start, or addition of drugs. Results In both the hypertensive and hyperglycemic cohort, only patients with incident diabetes-related comorbidity had a higher chance of treatment intensification (HR 4.48, 2.33–8.62 (p<0.001) for hypertensives; HR 2.37, 1.09–5.17 (p = 0.030) for hyperglycemics). Intensification of hypertension treatment was less likely when a new glucose-regulating drug was prescribed (HR 0.24, 0.06–0.97 (p = 0.046)). None of the prevalent or unrelated comorbidity was significantly associated with treatment intensification. Conclusions Diabetes-related comorbidity induced better risk factor treatment only for incident cases, implying that appropriate care is provided more often when complications occur. Diabetes-unrelated comorbidity did not affect hypertension or hyperglycemia management, even when it was incident or life-interfering. Thus, the observed “undertreatment” in diabetes care cannot be explained by constraints caused by such comorbidity."
https://openalex.org/W2072467425,"Alterations in tetraspanin CO-029 expression are associated with the progression and metastasis of cancers in the digestive system. However, how CO-029 promotes cancer metastasis is still poorly understood. To determine the mechanism, we silenced CO-029 expression in HT29 colon cancer cells and found that the CO-029 knockdown significantly reduced cell migratory ability. The diminished cell migration was accompanied by the upregulation of both integrin-dependent cell-matrix adhesion on laminin and calcium-dependent cell-cell adhesion. The cell surface levels of laminin-binding integrin α3β1 and fibronectin-integrin α5β1 were increased while the level of CD44 was decreased upon CO-029 silencing. These changes contribute to the altered cell-matrix adhesion. The deregulated cell-cell adhesion results, at least partially, from increased activity of cadherins and reduced level of MelCAM. In conclusion, CO-029 functions as a regulator of both cell-matrix and cell-cell adhesion. During colon cancer progression, CO-029 promotes cancer cell movement by deregulating cell adhesions."

https://openalex.org/W2013915123,"Pseudohypoparathyroidism (PHP) indicates a group of heterogeneous disorders whose common feature is represented by impaired signaling of hormones that activate Gsalpha, encoded by the imprinted GNAS gene. PHP-Ib patients have isolated Parathormone (PTH) resistance and GNAS epigenetic defects while PHP-Ia cases present with hormone resistance and characteristic features jointly termed as Albright's Hereditary Osteodystrophy (AHO) due to maternally inherited GNAS mutations or similar epigenetic defects as found for PHP-Ib. Pseudopseudohypoparathyroidism (PPHP) patients with an AHO phenotype and no hormone resistance and progressive osseous heteroplasia (POH) cases have inactivating paternally inherited GNAS mutations.We here describe 17 subjects with an AHO-like phenotype that could be compatible with having PPHP but none of them carried Gsalpha mutations. Functional platelet studies however showed an obvious Gs hypofunction in the 13 patients that were available for testing. Methylation for the three differentially methylated GNAS regions was quantified via the Sequenom EpiTYPER. Patients showed significant hypermethylation of the XL amplicon compared to controls (36 ± 3 vs. 29 ± 3%; p<0.001); a pattern that is reversed to XL hypomethylation found in PHPIb. Interestingly, XL hypermethylation was associated with reduced XLalphaS protein levels in the patients' platelets. Methylation for NESP and ExonA/B was significantly different for some but not all patients, though most patients have site-specific CpG methylation abnormalities in these amplicons. Since some AHO features are present in other imprinting disorders, the methylation of IGF2, H19, SNURF and GRB10 was quantified. Surprisingly, significant IGF2 hypermethylation (20 ± 10 vs. 14 ± 7%; p<0.05) and SNURF hypomethylation (23 ± 6 vs. 32 6%; p<0.001) was found in patients vs. controls, while H19 and GRB10 methylation was normal.In conclusion, this is the first report of methylation defects including GNAS in patients with an AHO-like phenotype without endocrinological abnormalities. Additional studies are still needed to correlate the methylation defect with the clinical phenotype."
https://openalex.org/W2020930607,"Many animals are able to perceive the earth magnetic field and to use it for orientation and navigation within the environment. The mechanisms underlying the perception and processing of magnetic field information within the brain have been thoroughly studied, especially in birds, but are still obscure. Three hypotheses are currently discussed, dealing with ferromagnetic particles in the beak of birds, with the same sort of particles within the lagena organs, or describing magnetically influenced radical-pair processes within retinal photopigments. Each hypothesis is related to a well-known sensory organ and claims parallel processing of magnetic field information with somatosensory, vestibular and visual input, respectively. Changes in activation within nuclei of the respective sensory systems have been shown previously. Most of these previous experiments employed intensity enhanced magnetic stimuli or lesions. We here exposed unrestrained zebra finches to either a stationary or a rotating magnetic field of the local intensity and inclination. C-Fos was used as an activity marker to examine whether the two treatments led to differences in fourteen brain areas including nuclei of the somatosensory, vestibular and visual system. An ANOVA revealed an overall effect of treatment, indicating that the magnetic field change was perceived by the birds. While the differences were too small to be significant in most areas, a significant enhancement of activation by the rotating stimulus was found in a hippocampal subdivision. Part of the hyperpallium showed a strong, nearly significant, increase. Our results are compatible with previous studies demonstrating an involvement of at least three different sensory systems in earth magnetic field perception and suggest that these systems, probably less elaborated, may also be found in nonmigrating birds."
https://openalex.org/W2132440940,"We explore impacts on pristine atolls subjected to anthropogenic near-field (human habitation) and far-field (climate and environmental change) pressure. Using literature data of human impacts on reefs, we parameterize forecast models to evaluate trajectories in coral cover under impact scenarios that primarily act via recruitment and increased mortality of larger corals. From surveys across the Chagos, we investigate the regeneration dynamics of coral populations distant from human habitation after natural disturbances. Using a size-based mathematical model based on a time-series of coral community and population data from 1999–2006, we provide hind- and forecast data for coral population dynamics within lagoons and on ocean-facing reefs verified against monitoring from 1979–2009. Environmental data (currents, temperatures) were used for calibration. The coral community was simplified into growth typologies: branching and encrusting, arboresent and massive corals. Community patterns observed in the field were influenced by bleaching-related mortality, most notably in 1998. Survival had been highest in deep lagoonal settings, which suggests a refuge. Recruitment levels were higher in lagoons than on ocean-facing reefs. When adding stress by direct human pressure, climate and environmental change as increased disturbance frequency and modified recruitment and mortality levels (due to eutrophication, overfishing, pollution, heat, acidification, etc), models suggest steep declines in coral populations and loss of community diversification among habitats. We found it likely that degradation of lagoonal coral populations would impact regeneration potential of all coral populations, also on ocean-facing reefs, thus decreasing reef resilience on the entire atoll."

Here, we show that the non-cell autonomous induction of DIAP-1 is mediated by Yorkie, the conserved downstream effector of Hippo signaling. The non-cell autonomous induction of Yorkie is due to Notch signaling from vps25 mutant cells. Moreover, activated Notch in normal cells is sufficient to induce non-cell autonomous Yorkie activity in wing imaginal discs. Our data identify a novel mechanism by which Notch promotes cell survival non-cell autonomously and by which neoplastic tumor cells generate a supportive microenvironment for tumor growth."
https://openalex.org/W2135624908,"Fig trees are a ubiquitous component of tropical rain forests and exhibit an enormous diversity of ecologies. Focusing on Ficus subgenus Sycomorus, a phenotypically diverse and ecologically important Old World lineage, we examined the evolution of fruit traits using a molecular phylogeny constructed using 5 kilobases of DNA sequence data from 63 species (50% of global diversity). In particular, we ask whether patterns of trait correlations are consistent with dispersal agents as the primary selective force shaping morphological diversity or if other ecological factors may provide a better explanation? Fig colour, size and placement (axial, cauliflorous, or geocarpic) were all highly evolutionarily liable, and the same fruit traits have evolved in different biogeographic regions with substantially different dispersal agents. After controlling for phylogenetic autocorrelation, we found that fig colour and size were significantly associated with fig placement and plant-life history traits (maximum plant height and leaf area, respectively). However, contrary to prevailing assumptions, fig placement correlated poorly with known dispersal agents and appears more likely determined by other factors, such as flowering phenology, nutrient economy, and habitat preference. Thus, plant life-history, both directly and through its influence on fig placement, appears to have played a prominent role in determining fruit traits in these figs."
https://openalex.org/W2011100473,"Emerging evidence has implicated the role of tumor initiating cells (TICs) in the process of cancer metastasis. The mechanism underlying the conversion of TICs from stationary to invasive remains to be characterized. In this report, we employed less invasive breast cancer TICs, SK-3rd, that displays CD44high/CD24low with high mammosphere-forming and tumorigenic capacities, to investigate the mechanism by which stationary TICs are converted to invasive TICs. Invasive ability of SK-3rd TICs was markedly enhanced when the cells were cultured under hypoxic conditions. Given the role of membrane type 1-matrix metalloproteinase (MT1-MMP) in cancer invasion/metastasis, we explored a possible involvement of MT1-MMP in hypoxia-induced TIC invasion. Silencing of MT1-MMP by a shRNA approach resulted in diminution of hypoxia-induced cell invasion in vitro and metastasis in vivo. Under hypoxic conditions, MT1-MMP redistributed from cytoplasmic storage pools to the cell surface of TICs, which coincides with the increased cell invasion. In addition, CD44, a cancer stem-like cell marker, inversely correlated with increased cell surface MT1-MMP. Interestingly, cell surface MT1-MMP gradually disappeared when the hypoxia-treated cells were switched to normoxia, suggesting the plasticity of TICs in response to oxygen content. Furthermore, we dissected the pathways leading to upregulated MT1-MMP in cytoplasmic storage pools under normoxic conditions, by demonstrating a cascade involving Twist1-miR10b-HoxD10 leading to enhanced MT1-MMP expression in SK-3rd TICs. These observations suggest that MT1-MMP is a key molecule capable of executing conversion of stationary TICs to invasive TICs under hypoxic conditions and thereby controlling metastasis."
https://openalex.org/W1986380124,"Adipogenesis, the differentiation of fibroblast-like mesenchymal stem cells into mature adipocytes, is tightly regulated by a complex cascade of transcription factors, including the nuclear receptor Peroxisome proliferator activator receptor γ (PPARγ). RNAi-mediated knock down libraries may present an atractive method for the identification of additional adipogenic factors. However, using in vitro adipogenesis model systems for high-throughput screening with siRNA libraries is limited since (i) differentiation is not homogeneous, but results in mixed cell populations, and (ii) the expression levels (and activity) of adipogenic regulators is highly dynamic during differentiation, indicating that the timing of RNAi-mediated knock down during differentiation may be extremely critical. Here we report a proof-of-principle for a novel RNAi screening method to identify regulators of adipogenesis that is based on lethality rescue rather than differentiation, using microRNA expression driven by a PPARγ responsive RNA polymerase II promoter. We validated this novel method through screening of a dedicated deubiquitinase knock down library, resulting in the identification of UCHL3 as an essential deubiquitinase in adipogenesis. This system therefore enables the identification of novel genes regulating PPARγ-mediated adipogenesis in a high-throughput setting."
https://openalex.org/W2054722404,"Adhesion to host tissues is an initiating step in a majority of bacterial infections. In the case of Gram-negative bacteria this adhesion is often mediated by a specific interaction between an adhesin, positioned at the distal end of bacterial pili, and its receptor on the surface of the host tissue. Furthermore, the rod of the pilus, and particularly its biomechanical properties, is believed to be crucial for the ability of bacteria to withstand external forces caused by, for example, (in the case of urinary tract infections) urinary rinsing flows by redistributing the force to several pili. In this work, the adhesion properties of P-piliated E. coli and their dependence of pH have been investigated in a broad pH range by both the surface plasmon resonance technique and force measuring optical tweezers. We demonstrate that P piliated bacteria have an adhesion ability throughout the entire physiologically relevant pH range (pH 4.5 – 8). We also show that pH has a higher impact on the binding rate than on the binding stability or the biomechanical properties of pili; the binding rate was found to have a maximum around pH 5 while the binding stability was found to have a broader distribution over pH and be significant over the entire physiologically relevant pH range. Force measurements on a single organelle level show that the biomechanical properties of P pili are not significantly affected by pH."
https://openalex.org/W2170630443,"Background Well-controlled trophoblast invasion at maternal-fetal interface is a critical event for the normal development of placenta. CD82 is a member of transmembrane 4 superfamily, which showed important role in inhibiting tumor cell invasion and migration. We surmised that CD82 are participates in trophoblast differentiation during placenta development. Methodology/Principal Findings CD82 was found to be strongly expressed in human first trimester placental villous and extravillous trophoblast cells as well as in trophoblast cell lines. To investigate whether CD82 plays a role in trophoblast invasion and migration, we further utilized human villous explants culture model on matrigel and invasion/migration assay of trophoblast cell line HTR8/SVneo. CD82 siRNA significantly promoted outgrowth of villous explants in vitro (P<0.01), as well as invasion and migration of HTR8/SVneo cells (P<0.05), whereas the trophoblast proliferation was not affected. The enhanced effect of CD82 siRNA on invasion and migration of trophoblast cells was found associated with increased gelatinolytic activities of matrix metalloproteinase MMP9 while over-expression of CD82 markedly decreased trphoblast cell invasion and migration as well as MMP9 activities. Conclusions/Significance These findings suggest that CD82 is an important negative regulator at maternal-fetal interface during early pregnancy, inhibiting human trophoblast invasion and migration."
https://openalex.org/W1978465346,"Assimilable organic carbon (AOC) is commonly used to measure the growth potential of microorganisms in water, but has not yet been investigated for measuring microbial growth potential in soils. In this study, a simple, rapid, and non-growth based assay to determine AOC in soil was developed using a naturally occurring luminous strain Vibrio harveyi BB721 to determine the fraction of low molecular weight organic carbon in soil water extract. Calibration of the assay was achieved by measuring the luminescence intensity of starved V. harveyi BB721 cells in the late exponential phase with a concentration range from 0 to 800 µg l(-1) glucose (equivalent to 0-16.0 mg glucose C kg(-1) soil) with the detection limit of 10 µg l(-1) equivalent to 0.20 mg glucose C kg(-1) soil. Results showed that bioluminescence was proportional to the concentration of glucose added to soil. The luminescence intensity of the cells was highly pH dependent and the optimal pH was about 7.0. The average AOC concentration in 32 soils tested was 2.9±2.2 mg glucose C kg(-1). Our data showed that AOC levels in soil water extracts were significantly correlated (P<0.05) with microbial biomass determined as microbial biomass carbon, indicating that the AOC concentrations determined by the method developed might be a good indicator of soil microbial biomass. Our findings provide a new approach that may be used to determine AOC in environmental samples using a non-growth bioluminescence based assay. Understanding the levels of AOC in soil water extract provides new insights into our ability to estimate the most available carbon pool to bacteria in soil that may be easily assimilated into cells for many metabolic processes and suggest possible the links between AOC, microbial regrowth potential, and microbial biomass in soils."
https://openalex.org/W2002426469,"Many species of tsetse flies are infected with a virus that causes salivary gland hypertrophy (SGH) symptoms associated with a reduced fecundity and fertility. A high prevalence of SGH has been correlated with the collapse of two laboratory colonies of Glossina pallidipes and colony maintenance problems in a mass rearing facility in Ethiopia. Mass-production of G. pallidipes is crucial for programs of tsetse control including the sterile insect technique (SIT), and therefore requires a management strategy for this virus. Based on the homology of DNA polymerase between salivary gland hypertrophy virus and herpes viruses at the amino acid level, two antiviral drugs, valacyclovir and acyclovir, classically used against herpes viruses were selected and tested for their toxicity on tsetse flies and their impact on virus replication. While long term per os administration of acyclovir resulted in a significant reduction of productivity of the colonies, no negative effect was observed in colonies fed with valacyclovir-treated blood. Furthermore, treatment of a tsetse colony with valacyclovir for 83 weeks resulted in a significant reduction of viral loads and consequently suppression of SGH symptoms. The combination of initial selection of SGHV-negative flies by non-destructive PCR, a clean feeding system, and valacyclovir treatment resulted in a colony that was free of SGH syndromes in 33 weeks. This is the first report of the use of a drug to control a viral infection in an insect and of the demonstration that valacyclovir can be used to suppress SGH in colonies of G. pallidipes."
https://openalex.org/W2002695088,"Background Hyperglycemia is commonly observed in extremely low gestational age newborns (ELGANs) and is associated with both increased morbidity and mortality. The objective of this study was to examine the relationship between neonatal hyperglycemia and adiponectin levels in ELGANs. Methodology/Principal Findings Ten preterm infants between 22+6/7 and 27+3/7 weeks’ gestation with neonatal hyperglycemia (defined as pre-feeding blood glucose levels above 200mg/dl on two consecutive measurements with a maximum parenteral glucose infusion of 4mg/kg*min−1) formed the case cohort of this study. To every single patient of this case cohort a patient with normal fasting ( = pre-feeding) blood glucose levels was matched in terms of gestational age and gender. Adiponectin ELISAs were performed both at onset of hyperglycemia and at term-equivalent age. In the case cohort 9/10 patients had to be treated with insulin for 1–26 days (range 0.01–0.4 IU/kg*h−1). Compared to matched-paired controls, significant hypoadiponectinemia was observed at onset of hyperglycemia in these affected patients (6.9µg/ml versus 15.1µg/ml, p = 0.009). At term equivalent age, normoglycemia without any insulin treatment was found in both groups. Moreover, adiponectin levels at that time were no longer significantly different (12.3µg/ml versus 20.0µg/ml; p = 0.051) possibly indicating a mechanistic relevance of this adipokine in regulating insulin sensitivity in ELGANs. Conclusions/Significance Decreased circulating adiponectin levels are correlated with hyperglycemia in ELGANs and may contribute to the pathogenesis of impaired glucose homeostasis in these infants. These findings suggest that adiponectin might be a potential future drug target for the potentially save treatment of hyperglycemia in pre-term infants."
https://openalex.org/W2073832945,"Background For visualizing large-scale biochemical network maps, it is important to calculate the coordinates of molecular nodes quickly and to enhance the understanding or traceability of them. The grid layout is effective in drawing compact, orderly, balanced network maps with node label spaces, but existing grid layout algorithms often require a high computational cost because they have to consider complicated positional constraints through the entire optimization process. Results We propose a hybrid grid layout algorithm that consists of a non-grid, fast layout (preprocessor) algorithm and an approximate pattern matching algorithm that distributes the resultant preprocessed nodes on square grid points. To demonstrate the feasibility of the hybrid layout algorithm, it is characterized in terms of the calculation time, numbers of edge-edge and node-edge crossings, relative edge lengths, and F-measures. The proposed algorithm achieves outstanding performances compared with other existing grid layouts. Conclusions Use of an approximate pattern matching algorithm quickly redistributes the laid-out nodes by fast, non-grid algorithms on the square grid points, while preserving the topological relationships among the nodes. The proposed algorithm is a novel use of the pattern matching, thereby providing a breakthrough for grid layout.

https://openalex.org/W1994618392,"Visual working memory (VWM) is known as a highly capacity-limited cognitive system that can hold 3–4 items. Recent studies have demonstrated that activity in the intraparietal sulcus (IPS) and occipital cortices correlates with the number of representations held in VWM. However, differences among those regions are poorly understood, particularly when task-irrelevant items are to be ignored. The present fMRI-based study investigated whether memory load-sensitive regions such as the IPS and occipital cortices respond differently to task-relevant information. Using a change detection task in which participants are required to remember pre-specified targets, here we show that while the IPS exhibited comparable responses to both targets and distractors, the dorsal occipital cortex manifested significantly weaker responses to an array containing distractors than to an array containing only targets, despite that the number of objects presented was the same for the two arrays. These results suggest that parietal and occipital cortices engage differently in distractor processing and that the dorsal occipital, rather than parietal, activity appears to reflect output of stimulus filtering and selection based on behavioral relevance."
https://openalex.org/W2007345250,"Mycobacterium tuberculosis Beijing strains are frequently associated with tuberculosis outbreaks and drug resistance. However, contradictory evidence and limited study generalizability make it difficult to foresee if the emergence of Beijing strains in high-income immigrant-receiving countries poses an increased public health threat. The purpose of this study was to determine if Beijing strains are associated with high risk disease presentations relative to other strains within Canada.This was a retrospective population-based study of culture-confirmed active TB cases in a major immigrant-receiving province of Canada in 1991 through 2007. Of 1,852 eligible cases, 1,826 (99%) were successfully genotyped. Demographic, clinical, and mycobacteriologic surveillance data were combined with molecular diagnostic data. The main outcome measures were site of disease, lung cavitation, sputum smear positivity, bacillary load, and first-line antituberculosis drug resistance.A total of 350 (19%) patients had Beijing strains; 298 (85%) of these were born in the Western Pacific. Compared to non-Beijing strains, Beijing strains were significantly more likely to be associated with polyresistance (aOR 1.8; 95% CI 1.0-3.3; p = 0.046) and multidrug-resistance (aOR 3.4; 1.0-11.3; p = 0.049). Conversely, Beijing strains were no more likely than non-Beijing strains to be associated with respiratory disease (aOR 1.3; 1.0-1.8; p = 0.053), high bacillary load (aOR 1.2; 0.6-2.7), lung cavitation (aOR 1.0; 0.7-1.5), immediately life-threatening forms of tuberculosis (aOR 0.8; 0.5-1.6), and monoresistance (aOR 0.9; 0.6-1.3). In subgroup analyses, Beijing strains only had a significant association with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (aOR 6.1; 1.2-30.4), and an association of borderline significance with polyresistant tuberculosis (aOR 1.8; 1.0-3.5; p = 0.062), among individuals born in the Western Pacific.Other than an increased risk of polyresistant or multidrug-resistant tuberculosis, Beijing strains appear to pose no more of a public health threat than non-Beijing strains within a high-income immigrant-receiving country."
https://openalex.org/W1998161762,"In dynamical systems theory, a system which can be described by differential equations is called a continuous dynamical system. In studies on genetic oscillation, most deterministic models at early stage are usually built on ordinary differential equations (ODE). Therefore, gene transcription which is a vital part in genetic oscillation is presupposed to be a continuous dynamical system by default. However, recent studies argued that discontinuous transcription might be more common than continuous transcription. In this paper, by appending the inserted silent interval lying between two neighboring transcriptional events to the end of the preceding event, we established that the running time for an intact transcriptional event increases and gene transcription thus shows slow dynamics. By globally replacing the original time increment for each state increment by a larger one, we introduced fractional differential equations (FDE) to describe such globally slow transcription. The impact of fractionization on genetic oscillation was then studied in two early stage models--the Goodwin oscillator and the Rössler oscillator. By constructing a ""dual memory"" oscillator--the fractional delay Goodwin oscillator, we suggested that four general requirements for generating genetic oscillation should be revised to be negative feedback, sufficient nonlinearity, sufficient memory and proper balancing of timescale. The numerical study of the fractional Rössler oscillator implied that the globally slow transcription tends to lower the chance of a coupled or more complex nonlinear genetic oscillatory system behaving chaotically."
https://openalex.org/W2143674608,"Noninvasive approaches to measuring cerebral circulation and metabolism are crucial to furthering our understanding of brain function. These approaches also have considerable potential for clinical use “at the bedside”. However, a highly nontrivial task and precondition if such methods are to be used routinely is the robust physiological interpretation of the data. In this paper, we explore the ability of a previously developed model of brain circulation and metabolism to explain and predict quantitatively the responses of physiological signals. The five signals all noninvasively-measured during hypoxemia in healthy volunteers include four signals measured using near-infrared spectroscopy along with middle cerebral artery blood flow measured using transcranial Doppler flowmetry. We show that optimising the model using partial data from an individual can increase its predictive power thus aiding the interpretation of NIRS signals in individuals. At the same time such optimisation can also help refine model parametrisation and provide confidence intervals on model parameters. Discrepancies between model and data which persist despite model optimisation are used to flag up important questions concerning the underlying physiology, and the reliability and physiological meaning of the signals."
