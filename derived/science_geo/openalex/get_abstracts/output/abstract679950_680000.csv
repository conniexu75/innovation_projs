https://openalex.org/W3194048913,"Compelling experimental evidence suggests that microglial activation is involved in the spread of tau tangles over the neocortex in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). We tested the hypothesis that the spatial propagation of microglial activation and tau accumulation colocalize in a Braak-like pattern in the living human brain. We studied 130 individuals across the aging and AD clinical spectrum with positron emission tomography brain imaging for microglial activation ([11C]PBR28), amyloid-β (Aβ) ([18F]AZD4694) and tau ([18F]MK-6240) pathologies. We further assessed microglial triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) concentrations and brain gene expression patterns. We found that [11C]PBR28 correlated with CSF soluble TREM2 and showed regional distribution resembling TREM2 gene expression. Network analysis revealed that microglial activation and tau correlated hierarchically with each other following Braak-like stages. Regression analysis revealed that the longitudinal tau propagation pathways depended on the baseline microglia network rather than the tau network circuits. The co-occurrence of Aβ, tau and microglia abnormalities was the strongest predictor of cognitive impairment in our study population. Our findings support a model where an interaction between Aβ and activated microglia sets the pace for tau spread across Braak stages. Microglial activation and tau accumulation propagate together in patients with Alzheimer’s disease, suggesting an interaction that determines disease progression."

Jung et al . developed a process to assemble nanomaterials as a monolayer that is partially embedded in an ultrathin elastomer. The process works by depositing a mixed solvent containing nanostructured silver and/or gold, along with elastomer, onto deionized water. This results in a layer of nanoparticles residing at the interface coating with elastomer, which is further densified by the addition of surfactant. The process is scalable, and the resulting elastomer membranes can be transferred to other substrates. —MSL"
https://openalex.org/W3195820203,"RNA molecules adopt three-dimensional structures that are critical to their function and of interest in drug discovery. Few RNA structures are known, however, and predicting them computationally has proven challenging. We introduce a machine learning approach that enables identification of accurate structural models without assumptions about their defining characteristics, despite being trained with only 18 known RNA structures. The resulting scoring function, the Atomic Rotationally Equivariant Scorer (ARES), substantially outperforms previous methods and consistently produces the best results in community-wide blind RNA structure prediction challenges. By learning effectively even from a small amount of data, our approach overcomes a major limitation of standard deep neural networks. Because it uses only atomic coordinates as inputs and incorporates no RNA-specific information, this approach is applicable to diverse problems in structural biology, chemistry, materials science, and beyond."

Griffin et al . found that a particular type of bacteria called enterococci enhance anti–PD-L1 immunotherapy in mice (see the Perspective by Ansaldo and Belkaid). The researchers show that enterococci secrete an enzyme called SagA that breaks down components of the bacterial cell wall. This process results in the release of muramyl peptide fragments, which in turn act as stimulatory molecules to promote signaling of the innate immune sensor protein NOD2 and improved immunotherapy responses. —PNK"
https://openalex.org/W3193815771,"Behaviors and disorders related to self-regulation, such as substance use, antisocial behavior and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, are collectively referred to as externalizing and have shared genetic liability. We applied a multivariate approach that leverages genetic correlations among externalizing traits for genome-wide association analyses. By pooling data from ~1.5 million people, our approach is statistically more powerful than single-trait analyses and identifies more than 500 genetic loci. The loci were enriched for genes expressed in the brain and related to nervous system development. A polygenic score constructed from our results predicts a range of behavioral and medical outcomes that were not part of genome-wide analyses, including traits that until now lacked well-performing polygenic scores, such as opioid use disorder, suicide, HIV infections, criminal convictions and unemployment. Our findings are consistent with the idea that persistent difficulties in self-regulation can be conceptualized as a neurodevelopmental trait with complex and far-reaching social and health correlates."

Gibson et al . combined two complementary methods that manipulate internal interface properties to dramatically decrease the thermal conductivity of the inorganic material BiO 2 Cl 2 Se (see the Perspective by Kim and Cahill). The authors took advantage of both in-plane structural distortions and weak bonding layers to push the conductivity down to 0.1 watts per kelvin per meter: only four times that of air. The principles should be applicable to other systems and provide a method for developing crystals with extremely low thermal conductivity. —BG"
https://openalex.org/W3194633533,"Background COVID-19 has proved to have an indirect impact on essential health services in several parts of the world which could lead to increased morbidity and mortality and loss of the gains made in the past decades. There were no synthesized scientific evidences which could show the impact of COVID-19 epidemics/pandemic on essential health services in Tigray, Northern Ethiopia. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the impacts of COVID-19 epidemics/pandemic on essential health services provision in Tigray, Northern Ethiopia. Methods A pre-post study design was used to assess the impacts of COVID-19 on essential health services delivery in Tigray, Northern Ethiopia in the second quarter of 2020 (Post COVID-19) compared to similar quarter in 2019 (Pre COVID-19). The study focuses on five categories; namely; maternal, neonatal and child health care; communicable diseases with a focus on HIV and TB-HIV co-infection; prevention of mother to child transmission of HIV; basic emergency, outpatient, inpatient and blood bank services, non-communicable diseases and road traffic accidents (RTAs). Analysis was done using Stata version 14.0 software package. The effects of COVID-19 epidemics/pandemic were calculated taking the differences between post COVID -19 and pre COVID-19 periods and the levels of service disruptions presented using proportions. Wilcoxon sign rank test was done and a significance level of ≤0.05 was considered as having significant difference among the two quarters. Results There were significant increase in institutional delivery, delivery by Caesarian Section (CS), still birth, postnatal care within 7 days of delivery, the number of children who received all vaccine doses before 1 st birthday, the number of under 5 children screened and had moderate acute malnutrition, the number of under 5 children screened and had severe acute malnutrition and children with SAM admitted for management. However, there were significant decrease in HIV testing and detection along with enrolment to antiretroviral therapy (ART) care, number of patients with cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk ≥ 30% received treatment, RTAs, total units of blood received from national blood transfusion service (NBTS) and regional blood banks, total number of units of blood transfused and emergency referral. There were no significant changes in outpatient visits and admissions. Conclusion Despite commendable achievements in maintaining several of the essential health services, COVID-19 has led to an increase in under nutrition in under five children, decline in HIV detection and care, CVD, cervical cancer screening and blood bank services. Therefore, governments, local and international agencies need to introduce innovative ways to rapidly expand and deliver services in the context of COVID-19. Moreover, lower income countries have to customize comprehensive and coordinated community-based health care approaches, including outreach and campaigns. In addition, countries should ensure that NCDs are incorporated in their national COVID-19 response plans to provide essential health care services to people living with NCDs and HIV or HIV-TB co-infection during the COVID-19 pandemic period."

Why did these sudden coolings occur? Yin et al . used a suite of climate models to show that an insolation threshold exists, beneath which the slow decrease of energy from the sun leads to rapid climate cooling. This effect results from weakening of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation involving sea ice feedbacks in the Nordic and Labrador Seas. —HJS"
https://openalex.org/W3195418364,"Objectives We examined undergraduate STEM students’ experiences during Spring 2020 when universities switched to remote instruction due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Specifically, we sought to understand actions by universities and instructors that students found effective or ineffective, as well as instructor behaviors that conveyed a sense of caring or not caring about their students’ success. Methods In July 2020 we conducted 16 focus groups with STEM undergraduate students enrolled in US colleges and universities (N = 59). Focus groups were stratified by gender, race/ethnicity, and socioeconomic status. Content analyses were performed using a data-driven inductive approach. Results Participants (N = 59; 51% female) were racially/ethnically diverse (76% race/ethnicity other than non-Hispanic white) and from 32 colleges and universities. The most common effective instructor strategies mentioned included hybrid instruction (35%) and use of multiple tools for learning and student engagement (27%). The most common ineffective strategies mentioned were increasing the course workload or difficulty level (18%) and use of pre-recorded lectures (15%). The most common behaviors cited as making students feel the instructor cared about their success were exhibiting leniency and/or flexibility regarding course policies or assessments (29%) and being responsive and accessible to students (25%). The most common behaviors cited as conveying the instructors did not care included poor communication skills (28%) and increasing the difficulty of the course (15%). University actions students found helpful included flexible policies (41%) and moving key services online (e.g., tutoring, counseling; 24%). Students felt universities should have created policies for faculty and departments to increase consistency (26%) and ensured communication strategies were honest, prompt, and transparent (23%). Conclusions To be prepared for future emergencies, universities should devise evidence-based policies for remote operations and all instructors should be trained in best practices for remote instruction. Research is needed to identify and ameliorate negative impacts of the pandemic on STEM education."
https://openalex.org/W3195624899,"In eukaryotic cells, half of all proteins function as subunits within multiprotein complexes. Imbalanced synthesis of subunits leads to unassembled intermediates that must be degraded to minimize cellular toxicity. Here, we found that excess PSMC5, a subunit of the proteasome base, was targeted for degradation by the HERC1 ubiquitin ligase in mammalian cells. HERC1 identified unassembled PSMC5 by its cognate assembly chaperone PAAF1. Because PAAF1 only dissociates after assembly, HERC1 could also engage later assembly intermediates such as the PSMC4-PSMC5-PAAF1 complex. A missense mutant of HERC1 that causes neurodegeneration in mice was impaired in the recognition and ubiquitination of the PSMC5-PAAF1 complex. Thus, proteasome assembly factors can serve as adaptors for ubiquitin ligases to facilitate elimination of unassembled intermediates and maintain protein homeostasis."
https://openalex.org/W3194337530,"EUROCAT is a European network of population-based congenital anomaly (CA) registries. Twenty-one registries agreed to participate in the EUROlinkCAT study to determine if reliable information on the survival of children born with a major CA between 1995 and 2014 can be obtained through linkage to national vital statistics or mortality records. Live birth children with a CA could be linked using personal identifiers to either their national vital statistics (including birth records, death records, hospital records) or to mortality records only, depending on the data available within each region. In total, 18 of 21 registries with data on 192,862 children born with congenital anomalies participated in the study. One registry was unable to get ethical approval to participate and linkage was not possible for two registries due to local reasons. Eleven registries linked to vital statistics and seven registries linked to mortality records only; one of the latter only had identification numbers for 78% of cases, hence it was excluded from further analysis. For registries linking to vital statistics: six linked over 95% of their cases for all years and five were unable to link at least 85% of all live born CA children in the earlier years of the study. No estimate of linkage success could be calculated for registries linking to mortality records. Irrespective of linkage method, deaths that occurred during the first week of life were over three times less likely to be linked compared to deaths occurring after the first week of life. Linkage to vital statistics can provide accurate estimates of survival of children with CAs in some European countries. Bias arises when linkage is not successful, as early neonatal deaths were less likely to be linked. Linkage to mortality records only cannot be recommended, as linkage quality, and hence bias, cannot be assessed."
https://openalex.org/W3194988817,"Implementation of evidence-based practice in clinical practice is crucial. Nurses and midwives play a vital role in using updated evidence. However, limited support and barriers to implementing evidence-based practice hamper the use of up-to-date evidence in clinical decision-making practice. Therefore, this study aimed to explore the implementation of evidence-based practice of nurses and midwives working in public hospitals.A qualitative descriptive study was conducted to explore the experience of implementing evidence-based practice among nurses and midwives working in public hospitals. A total of 86 participants, of which, 25 in-depth interviews, 5 FGDs having 47 participants and 14 participants were involved during observations, were considered in Amhara Region public hospitals from November 17, 2019 to April 25, 2020. The observational data, interview and FGD transcripts were imported into NVivo 12 plus to manage and analyze the data using the Computer-Assisted Data Analysis Software Program (CAQDAS). The data were analyzed through thematic content analysis.Nurses and midwives perceived that implementation of evidence-based practice is the use of research findings, guidelines, hospital protocols, books, and expert experience in clinical decision-making practice. However, there was limited support for the implementation of evidence-based practice by nurses and midwives. The lack of knowledge and skill to use evidence like research findings, time mismanagement, the lack of motivation, the lack of resources and training were the perceived barriers to the implementation of evidence-based practice. Stick to the traditional practice due to lack of incentive and unclear job description between diploma and BSc nurses and midwives were the perceived causes of the lack of motivation.The experience of evidence-based practice of nurses and midwives indicated that there was limited support for the implementation of evidence-based practice. However, research findings were rarely used in clinical decision-making practice The Knowledge, attitude towards implementing evidence-based practice, lack of resources and training, time mismanagement and lack of motivation were the barriers to the implementation of evidence-based practice. Therefore, the promotion of adopting the implementation of evidence-based practice and training on the identified barriers are mandatory."
https://openalex.org/W3196253938,"Background The effects of pre-existing endemic human coronavirus (HCoV) immunity on SARS-CoV-2 serologic and clinical responses are incompletely understood. Objectives We sought to determine the effects of prior exposure to HCoV Betacoronavirus HKU1 spike protein on serologic responses to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein after intramuscular administration in mice. We also sought to understand the baseline seroprevalence of HKU1 spike antibodies in healthy children and to measure their correlation with SARS-CoV-2 binding and neutralizing antibodies in children hospitalized with acute coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) or multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C). Methods Groups of 5 mice were injected intramuscularly with two doses of alum-adjuvanted HKU1 spike followed by SARS-CoV-2 spike; or the reciprocal regimen of SARS-Cov-2 spike followed by HKU1 spike. Sera collected 21 days following each injection was analyzed for IgG antibodies to HKU1 spike, SARS-CoV-2 spike, and SARS-CoV-2 neutralization. Sera from children hospitalized with acute COVID-19, MIS-C or healthy controls (n = 14 per group) were analyzed for these same antibodies. Results Mice primed with SARS-CoV-2 spike and boosted with HKU1 spike developed high titers of SARS-CoV-2 binding and neutralizing antibodies; however, mice primed with HKU1 spike and boosted with SARS-CoV-2 spike were unable to mount neutralizing antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. HKU1 spike antibodies were detected in all children with acute COVID-19, MIS-C, and healthy controls. Although children with MIS-C had significantly higher HKU1 spike titers than healthy children (GMT 37239 vs. 7551, P = 0.012), these titers correlated positively with both SARS-CoV-2 binding (r = 0.7577, P &lt;0.001) and neutralizing (r = 0.6201, P = 0.001) antibodies. Conclusions Prior murine exposure to HKU1 spike protein completely impeded the development of neutralizing antibodies to SARS-CoV-2, consistent with original antigenic sin. In contrast, the presence of HKU1 spike IgG antibodies in children with acute COVID-19 or MIS-C was not associated with diminished neutralizing antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2."
https://openalex.org/W3194238653,"Background Despite efforts to improve childhood immunization coverage in Nigeria, coverage has remained below the national acceptable level. In December 2019, we conducted an assessment of Missed Opportunities for Vaccination (MOV) in Ondo State, in Southwest Nigeria. The objectives were to determine the magnitude of, explore the reasons for, as well as possible solutions for reducing MOV in the State. Methods This was a cross-sectional study using a mixed-methods approach. We purposively selected 66 health facilities in three local government authorities, with a non-probabilistic sampling of caregivers of children 0–23 months for exit interviews, and health workers for knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) surveys. Data collection was complemented with focus group discussions and in-depth interviews with caregivers and health workers. The proportion of MOV among children with documented vaccination histories were determined and thematic analysis of the qualitative data was carried out. Results 984 caregivers with children aged 0–23 months were interviewed, of which 869 were eligible for inclusion in our analysis. The prevalence of MOV was 32.8%. MOV occurred among 90.8% of children during non-vaccination visits, and 7.3% during vaccination visits. Vaccine doses recommended later in the immunization series were given in a less timely manner. Among 41.0% of health workers, they reported their vaccination knowledge was insufficient. Additionally, 57.5% were concerned about and feared adverse events following immunization. Caregivers were found to have a low awareness about vaccination, and issues related to the organization of the health system were found to contribute towards MOV. Conclusions One in three children experienced a MOV during a health service encounter. Potential interventions to reduce MOV include training of health workers about immunization policies and practices, improving caregivers’ engagement and screening of vaccination documentation by health workers during every health service encounter."
https://openalex.org/W3195789499,"Compared with the well-described XY sex determination system in mammals, the avian ZW sex determination system is poorly understood. Knockdown and overexpression studies identified doublesex and mab-3-related transcription factor 1 (DMRT1) as the testis-determining gene in chicken. However, the detailed effects of DMRT1 gene disruption from embryonic to adult development are not clear. Herein, we have generated DMRT1-disrupted chickens using the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats-associated protein 9 system, followed by an analysis of physiological, hormonal, and molecular changes in the genome-modified chickens. In the early stages of male chicken development, disruption of DMRT1 induced gonad feminization with extensive physiological and molecular changes; however, functional feminine reproductivity could not be implemented with disturbed hormone synthesis. Subsequent RNA-sequencing analysis of the DMRT1-disrupted chicken gonads revealed gene networks, including several novel genes linearly and non-linearly associated with DMRT1, which are involved in gonad feminization. By comparing the gonads of wild type with the genome-modified chickens, a set of genes were identified that is involved in the ZW sex determination system independent of DMRT1. Our results extend beyond the Z-dosage hypothesis to provide further information about the avian ZW sex determination system and epigenetic effects of gonad feminization."
https://openalex.org/W3194120864,"Bovine paratuberculosis (PTB) is a chronic inflammatory disease caused by Mycobacterium avium susbp. paratuberculosis (MAP). Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) significantly associated with susceptibility to bovine PTB. The main objective of this study was to identify quantitative trait loci (QTLs) associated with MAP infection in Spanish Holstein cows (N = 983) using combinations of diagnostic tests and imputed whole-genome sequence (WGS) data. The infection status of these animals was defined by three diagnostic methods including ELISA for MAP-antibodies detection, and tissue culture and PCR for MAP detection. The 983 cows included in this study were genotyped with the Bovine MD SNP50 Bead Chip, and the corresponding genotypes were imputed to WGS using the 1,000 Bull genomes reference population. In total, 33.77 million SNP variants per animal were identified across the genome. Linear mixed models were used to calculate the heritability (h2) estimates for each diagnostic test and test combinations. Next, we performed a case-control GWAS using the imputed WGS datasets and the phenotypes and combinations of phenotypes with h2 estimates > 0.080. After performing the GWAS, the test combinations that showed SNPs with a significant association (PFDR ≤ 0.05), were the ELISA-tissue PCR-tissue culture, ELISA-tissue culture, and ELISA-tissue PCR. A total of twelve quantitative trait loci (QTLs) highly associated with MAP infection status were identified on the Bos taurus autosomes (BTA) 4, BTA5, BTA11, BTA12, BTA14, BTA23, BTA24, and BTA28, and some of these QTLs were linked to immune-modulating genes. The identified QTLs on BTA23 spanning from 18.81 to 22.95 Mb of the Bos taurus genome overlapped with several QTLs previously found to be associated with PTB susceptibility, bovine tuberculosis susceptibility, and clinical mastitis. The results from this study provide more clues regarding the molecular mechanisms underlying susceptibility to PTB infection in cattle and might be used to develop national genetic evaluations for PTB in Spain."
https://openalex.org/W3195297147,"Purpose To compare the safety and efficacy of microshunt implantation augmented with Mitomycin C in patients with pseudoexfoliation glaucoma (PEXG) and primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG). Methods In this retrospective, single centre, interventional study, 46 eyes of 41 patients with PEXG (20 eyes) and POAG (26 eyes) underwent microshunt implantation. Definition of failure was an intraocular pressure (IOP) lower than 5 or higher than 17mmHg on two consecutive visits, an IOP reduction lower than 20% on two consecutive visits, the need of surgical revisions or reoperations or loss of light perception. Outcome was rated as complete success if achieved without medication, otherwise as qualified success. Furthermore, postoperative complications and interventions were compared between the two groups. Results Patient demographics were similar, except for older age in the PEXG group (70.9±8.6 versus 77.6±8; p = 0.02). Mean IOP dropped from 21.5±5.8mmHg (PEXG) and 18.2±4.5mmHg (POAG) at baseline to 12.8±3.0mmHg ( p &lt;0.0001) and 12.9±4.2mmHg ( p &lt;0.0001), respectively, at one year. Mean number of medications were reduced from 2.8±1.3 to 0.3±0.8 for PEXG patients ( p &lt;0.0001) and from 2.7±1.3 to 0.3±0.8 for POAG patients ( p &lt;0.0001). At one year of follow-up 75.0% of PEXG patients achieved complete success and 80.0% qualified success. In the POAG group rates were 73.1% and 76.9%, respectively. Postoperative complications were comparable between both groups, except for higher rates of hypotony ( p = 0.04) and choroidal detachment ( p = 0.03) in the PEXG group. Conclusion Microshunt implantation demonstrated similar efficacy results in PEXG and POAG eyes at a follow-up of 12 months. Higher rates of transient hypotony and choroidal detachment were observed in PEXG eyes."

This study was designed to investigate the effect of postoperative high-load long-duration inspiratory muscle training on pulmonary function, inspiratory muscle strength, and functional capacity after mitral valve replacement surgeries.Prospective randomized controlled trial.A total of one hundred patients (mean age 38.3±3.29years) underwent mitral valve replacement surgery were randomized into experimental (n = 50) and control (n = 50) groups. The control group received conventional physiotherapy care, while experimental group received conventional care in addition to inspiratory muscle training, with 40% of the baseline maximal inspiratory pressure targeting a load of 80% by the end of the 8 weeks intervention protocol. Inspiratory muscle training started on the patient's first day in the inpatient ward. Lung functions, inspiratory muscle strength, and functional capacity were evaluated using a computer-based spirometry system, maximal inspiratory pressure measurement and 6MWT respectively at 5 time points and a follow-up assessment was performed 6 months after surgery. Repeated measure ANOVA and post-hoc analyses were used (p <0.05).Group-time interactions were detected for all the studied variables (p<0.001). Between-group analysis revealed statistically significant postoperative improvements in all studied variables in the experimental group compared to the control group (p <0.001) with large effect size of η2 ˃0.14. Within-group analysis indicated substantial improvements in lung function, inspiratory pressure and functional capacity in the experimental group (p <0.05) over time, and these improvements were maintained at follow-up.High intensity, long-duration postoperative inspiratory muscle training is highly effective in improving lung function, inspiratory muscle strength, and functional capacity after mitral valve replacement surgeries."

Method A total of 410 overweight/obese subjects (130 with OSA with NAFLD, 100 with OSA without NAFLD, 95 without OSA and with NAFLD and 85 without OSA and without NAFLD) were recruited. Degree of NAFLD was based on liver ultrasound and of OSA on overnight polysomnography. Genotyping was performed by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism and confirmed by gene sequencing. Result Mean values of blood pressure, body fat markers, blood glucose, lipids, liver function, and markers of insulin resistance were significantly increased in OSA and NAFLD subjects (p&lt;0.05). In addition, according to age (years) categories, blood pressure, blood glucose, lipids, obesity markers, and markers of insulin resistance were significantly higher in 45–60 years group as compared to 20–45 years group (p&lt;0.05). In IRS1 gene, the genotype frequency (%) of Arg/Arg was significantly higher in NAFLD and OSA subjects. In addition, Gly/Arg genotype of IRS1 gene was associated with significantly higher body mass index, fat mass, %body fat, triglycerides, cholesterol, alkaline phosphate, aspartate transaminase, fasting insulin and HOMA-IR levels in OSA and NAFLD subjects. No significant difference in genotype frequencies of IRS2 was observed between four groups. Further we found that subjects carrying IRS1 Gly/Arg (OR 4.49, 95% C.I. 1.06–12.52, p = 0.002) genotype possess a much higher risk of OSA and NAFLD compared to IRS2 Gly/Asp (OR 1.01, 95% C.I. 0.8–2.56, p = 0.05). In sub group analysis of IRS1 Gly/Arg have significant differences between the mild, moderate and severe group (P&lt;0.05). In addition, patients with the ‘Gly’ allele were inclined to develop more severe OSA. Conclusion We concluded that Asian Indian subject carrying the allele Gly972Arg polymorphism of IRS1 is predisposed to develop OSA and NAFLD."
https://openalex.org/W3194577042,"Songbirds learn their vocalizations during developmental sensitive periods of song memorization and sensorimotor learning. Some seasonal songbirds, called open-ended learners, recapitulate transitions from sensorimotor learning and song crystallization on a seasonal basis during adulthood. In adult male canaries, sensorimotor learning occurs each year in autumn and leads to modifications of the syllable repertoire during successive breeding seasons. We previously showed that perineuronal nets (PNN) expression in song control nuclei decreases during this sensorimotor learning period. Here we explored the causal link between PNN expression in adult canaries and song modification by enzymatically degrading PNN in HVC, a key song control system nucleus. Three independent experiments identified limited effects of the PNN degradation in HVC on the song structure of male canaries. They clearly establish that presence of PNN in HVC is not required to maintain general features of crystallized song. Some suggestion was collected that PNN are implicated in the stability of song repertoires but this evidence is too preliminary to draw firm conclusions and additional investigations should consider producing PNN degradations at specified time points of the seasonal cycle. It also remains possible that once song has been crystallized at the beginning of the first breeding season, PNN no longer play a key role in determining song structure; this could be tested by treatments with chondroitinase ABC at key steps in ontogeny. It would in this context be important to develop multiple stereotaxic procedures allowing the simultaneous bilateral degradation of PNN in several song control nuclei for extended periods."
https://openalex.org/W3195008746,"Human serum albumin (HSA) has been widely used as a pharmaceutical excipient in Botulinum toxin serotype A (BoNT/A) products that are indicated for use in therapeutics and cosmetics. However, HSA as a human-derived material has some concerns, such as the potential risk of transmission of infectious agents, an insufficient supply, and difficulty in maintaining a certain quality. For those reasons, newly developed BoNT/A products (CORETOX®, Medytox, Inc., Republic of Korea) contained polysorbate 20, a non-human-derived excipient, to replace the HSA. However, most safety studies of polysorbate 20 have been conducted with non-invasive routes of administration, and thus there are a few studies on the safety of polysorbate 20 when administered intramuscularly. To secure the in vivo safety profile of polysorbate 20, a four-week repeated intramuscular dose toxicity study (0.02, 0.1, and 0.4 mg/kg, one injection every two weeks for a total of three injections) was conducted in 66 Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats. An intradermal irritation study was further conducted with 18 New Zealand White (NZW) rabbits. The toxicological evaluation of HSA (0.06 and 0.12 mg/kg) was also carried out as a comparative substance. Systemic and local toxicities were not observed in any of the SD rats or NZW rabbits based on clinical signs, body weight, hematology, clinical biochemistry, macroscopic findings on necropsy, histopathology of the injection site, and allergic reactions. The current study suggested that intramuscular administration of polysorbate 20 was considered to be safe at a level similar to that of HSA, which has an in vivo safety profile accumulated over the years. This provided the basis for the in vivo safety profile of polysorbate 20 administered intramuscularly and the scientific reliability of the use of polysorbate 20 as an alternative to HSA, which is used as an excipient for various pharmaceuticals in terms of its safety."

Analysis of microsatellite loci and mitochondrial D-loop sequences reveal significantly reduced genetic differentiation and a shallow population structure. Despite the low genetic variability, no bottleneck was observed but 12 microsatellite loci were informative in reflecting probable inbreeding. These findings provide a valuable source of knowledge to maximize genetic variability and enhance the success of future conservation plans for captive and wild populations of Hume's pheasant."
https://openalex.org/W3195961553,"Although commonly thought to produce prostacyclin (prostaglandin I2; PGI2) that evokes vasodilatation and protects vessels from the development of diseases, the endothelial cyclooxygenase (COX)-mediated metabolism has also been found to release substance(s) called endothelium-derived contracting factor(s) (EDCF) that causes endothelium-dependent contraction and implicates in endothelial dysfunction of disease conditions. Various mechanisms have been proposed for the process; however, the major endothelial COX metabolite PGI2, which has been classically considered to activate the I prostanoid receptor (IP) that mediates vasodilatation and opposes the effects of thromboxane (Tx) A2 produced by COX in platelets, emerges as a major EDCF in health and disease conditions. Our recent studies from genetically altered mice further suggest that vasomotor reactions to PGI2 are collectively modulated by IP, the vasoconstrictor Tx-prostanoid receptor (TP; the prototype receptor of TxA2) and E prostanoid receptor-3 (EP3; a vasoconstrictor receptor of PGE2) although with differences in potency and efficacy; a contraction to PGI2 reflects activities of TP and/or EP3 outweighing that of the concurrently activated IP. Here, we discuss the history of endothelium-dependent contraction, evidences that support the above hypothesis, proposed mechanisms for the varied reactions to endothelial PGI2 synthesis as well as the relation of its dilator activity to the effect of another NO-independent vasodilator mechanism, the endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor. Also, we address the possible pathological and therapeutic implications as well as questions remaining to be resolved or limitations of our above findings obtained from genetically altered mouse models."
https://openalex.org/W3193405622,"Most desert plants form symbiotic relationships with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF), yet fungal identity and impacts on host plants remain largely unknown. Despite widespread recognition of the importance of AMF relationships for plant functioning, we do not know how fungal community structure changes across a desert climate gradient, nor the impacts of different fungal communities on host plant species. Because climate change can shape the distribution of species through effects on species interactions, knowing how the ranges of symbiotic partners are geographically structured and the outcomes of those species interactions informs theory and improves management recommendations. Here we used high throughput sequencing to examine the AMF community of Joshua trees along a climate gradient in Joshua Tree National Park. We then used a range of performance measures and abiotic factors to evaluate how different AMF communities may affect Joshua tree fitness. We found that fungal communities change with elevation resulting in a spectrum of interaction outcomes from mutualism to parasitism that changed with the developmental stage of the plant. Nutrient accumulation and the mycorrhizal growth response of Joshua tree seedlings inoculated with fungi from the lowest (warmest) elevations was first negative, but after 9 months had surpassed that of plants with other fungal treatments. This indicates that low elevation fungi are costly for the plant to initiate symbiosis, yet confer benefits over time. The strong relationship between AMF community and plant growth suggests that variation in AMF community may have long term consequences for plant populations along an elevation gradient."
https://openalex.org/W3193492481,"Narwhals ( Monodon monoceros ) are gregarious toothed whales that strictly reside in the high Arctic. They produce a broad range of signal types; however, studies of narwhal vocalizations have been mostly descriptive of the sounds available in the species’ overall repertoire. Little is known regarding the functions of highly stereotyped mixed calls (i.e., biphonations with both sound elements produced simultaneously), although preliminary evidence has suggested that such vocalizations are individually distinctive and function as contact calls. Here we provide evidence that supports this notion in narwhal mother-calf communication. A female narwhal was tagged as part of larger studies on the life history and acoustic behavior of narwhals. At the time of tagging, it became apparent that the female had a calf, which remained close by during the tagging event. We found that the narwhal mother produced a distinct, highly stereotyped mixed call when separated from her calf and immediately after release from capture, which we interpret as preliminary evidence for contact call use between the mother and her calf. The mother’s mixed call production occurred continually over the 4.2 day recording period in addition to a second prominent but different stereotyped mixed call which we believe belonged to the narwhal calf. Thus, narwhal mothers produce highly stereotyped contact calls when separated from their calves, and it appears that narwhal calves similarly produce distinct, stereotyped mixed calls which we hypothesize also contribute to maintaining mother-calf contact. We compared this behavior to the acoustic behavior of two other adult females without calves, but also each with a unique, stereotyped call type. While we provide additional support for individual distinctiveness across narwhal contact calls, more research is necessary to determine whether these calls are vocal signatures which broadcast identity."
https://openalex.org/W3193726246,"Introduction Physical activity (PA) plays an important role in the prevention of cardiovascular diseases, especially in children. Previous studies which investigated the role of PA and sedentary time (ST) in cardiovascular disease used different measurements and found inconsistent results. The current study used recommended standardized measures and provides an overview of PA and ST among Dutch primary school children and their associations with cardiovascular risk factors. Methods 503 children (55% girls, mean age (± SD) 10 ± 1y) were included. PA (total PA, lightPA and moderate to vigorous PA (MVPA)) and ST were measured with the Actigraph GT3X accelerometer. PA in different domains was measured with the BAECKE questionnaire. Cardiovascular risk factors included BMI z-score, waist circumference, blood pressure (z-score) and estimated cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) as measured with the 20 meter shuttle run test. Results Children spent 57 ± 20 min/day (8%) on MVPA and 42% of the children reached the MVPA guideline of 60 min/day. Total PA and MVPA (h/day) were negatively associated with BMI z-score (B = -0.452, p = 0.011) and waist circumference (B = -3.553, p = 0.011) and positively associated with CRF (B = 2.527, p = &lt;0.001). ST was positively associated with BMI z-score (B = 0.108, p = 0.048) and waist circumference (B = 0.920, p = 0.033). No significant associations were found between total PA or PA intensities and blood pressure. Conclusion This study used standardized measures of PA and therefore created an accurate overview of PA, ST and their associations with cardiovascular risk factors. PA and ST were associated with BMI z-score, waist circumference and CRF. The findings emphasize the importance of promoting MVPA in children, but also highlight the potential benefits of reducing ST to improve cardiovascular risk factors.

https://openalex.org/W3195900184,"To meet monitoring and recovery planning needs, demographic vital rates of two endangered freshwater mussels (Bivalvia: Unionidae)-the Cumberlandian Combshell (Epioblasma brevidens, Lea 1831) and Oyster Mussel (Epioblasma capsaeformis, Lea 1834), species endemic to the Tennessee and Cumberland river basins, U.S.A-were estimated and compared using census methodologies. Annual variation in population density and size, recruitment rate, mortality rate, sex ratios, and female fecundity of both species were observed from 2004-2014 at three fixed sites, spanning a 33.8 kilometer (KM) reach of the Clinch River, Hancock County, Tennessee. Mean population size of E. brevidens estimated from 11 censuses was 2,598 individuals at Swan Island (KM 277.1), 8,744 at Frost Ford (KM 291.8), and 879 at Wallen Bend (KM 309.6); collectively, these demes grew at an annual rate of 7% over the study period. Mean population size of E. capsaeformis was 7,846 individuals at Swan Island, 265,442 at Frost Ford, and 11,704 at Wallen Bend; collectively, these demes grew at an annual rate of 6%. Population size, variability in population growth, recruitment, and mortality of the shorter-lived E. capsaeformis (maximum age = 16 yrs, rarely >10 yrs) were higher than those of the longer-lived E. brevidens (maximum age = 25 yrs). Stream discharge was associated with realized per-capita population growth rate for both species when juvenile (Ages 1-3) data was included. Linear regression analysis showed that the growth rate of E. brevidens was negatively associated with median annual discharge (p = 0.0274) and that growth rate of E. capsaeformis was negatively associated with the number of days having extreme high discharge preceding a census (p = 0.0381). Fecundity of female E. brevidens averaged 34,947 (SE = 2,492) glochidia and ranged from 18,987 to 56,151, whereas fecundity of female E. capsaeformis averaged 9,558 (SE = 603) glochidia and ranged from 3,456 to 22,182. Estimated vital rates indicated that the two species are characterized by different life-history strategies, with E. brevidens exhibiting a periodic strategy (between K- and r-selected) and E. capsaeformis an opportunistic strategy (r-selected). These life history strategies are likely influenced by each species' longevity and habitat preference, in addition to the life histories and population dynamics of their primary fish hosts."
https://openalex.org/W3194174663,"Cerebrovascular abnormality is linked to Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRDs). ApoE-Ɛ4 (APOE4) is known to play a critical role in neurovascular dysfunction, however current medical imaging technologies are limited in quantification. This cross-sectional study tested the feasibility of a recently established imaging modality, quantitative ultra-short time-to-echo contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (QUTE-CE MRI), to identify small vessel abnormality early in development of human APOE4 knock-in female rat (TGRA8960) animal model. At 8 months, 48.3% of the brain volume was found to have significant signal increase (75/173 anatomically segmented regions; q<0.05 for multiple comparisons). Notably, vascular abnormality was detected in the tri-synaptic circuit, cerebellum, and amygdala, all of which are known to functionally decline throughout AD pathology and have implications in learning and memory. The detected abnormality quantified with QUTE-CE MRI is likely a result of hyper-vascularization, but may also be partly, or wholly, due to contributions from blood-brain-barrier leakage. Further exploration with histological validation is warranted to verify the pathological cause. Regardless, these results indicate that QUTE-CE MRI can detect neurovascular dysfunction with high sensitivity with APOE4 and may be helpful to provide new insights into health and disease."
https://openalex.org/W3194643231,"Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) is a hereditary bone disease where gene mutations affect Type I collagen formation resulting in osteopenia and increased fracture risk. There are several established mouse models of OI, but some are severe and result in spontaneous fractures or early animal death. The Amish Col1a2 G610C/+ (G610C) mouse model is a newer, moderate OI model that is currently being used in a variety of intervention studies, with differing background strains, sexes, ages, and bone endpoints. This study is a comprehensive mechanical and architectural characterization of bone in G610C mice bred on a C57BL/6 inbred strain and will provide a baseline for future treatment studies. Male and female wild-type (WT) and G610C mice were euthanized at 10 and 16 weeks (n = 13–16). Harvested tibiae, femora, and L4 vertebrae were scanned via micro-computed tomography and analyzed for cortical and trabecular architectural properties. Femora and tibiae were then mechanically tested to failure. G610C mice had less bone but more highly mineralized cortical and trabecular tissue than their sex- and age-matched WT counterparts, with cortical cross-sectional area, thickness, and mineral density, and trabecular bone volume, mineral density, spacing, and number all differing significantly as a function of genotype (2 Way ANOVA with main effects of sex and genotype at each age). In addition, mechanical yield force, ultimate force, displacement, strain, and toughness were all significantly lower in G610C vs. WT, highlighting a brittle phenotype. This characterization demonstrates that despite being a moderate OI model, the Amish G610C mouse model maintains a distinctly brittle phenotype and is well-suited for use in future intervention studies."
https://openalex.org/W3196207727,"Our laboratory has demonstrated that captopril, an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, mitigates hematopoietic injury following total body irradiation in mice. Improved survival in mice is correlated with improved recovery of mature blood cells and bone marrow, reduction of radiation-induced inflammation, and suppression of radiation coagulopathy. Here we investigated the effects of captopril treatment against radiation injuries in the Göttingen mini pig model of Hematopoietic-Acute Radiation Syndrome (H-ARS). Minipigs were given captopril orally (0.96 mg/kg) twice daily for 12 days following total body irradiation (60Co 1.79 Gy, 0.42-0.48 Gy/min). Blood was drawn over a time course following irradiation, and tissue samples were collected at euthanasia (32-35 days post-irradiation). We observed improved survival with captopril treatment, with survival rates of 62.5% in vehicle treated and 87.5% in captopril treated group. Additionally, captopril significantly improved recovery of peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and a trend toward improvement in recovery of red blood cells and platelets. Captopril significantly reduced radiation-induced expression of cytokines erythropoietin and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor and suppressed radiation-induced acute-phase inflammatory response cytokine serum amyloid protein A. Using quantitative-RT-PCR to monitor bone marrow recovery, we observed significant suppression of radiation-induced expression of redox stress genes and improved hematopoietic cytokine expression. Our findings suggest that captopril activities in the Göttingen minipig model of hematopoietic-acute radiation syndrome reflect findings in the murine model."
https://openalex.org/W3193399934,"The reopening of schools during the COVID-19 pandemic has raised concerns about widespread infection and transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in educational settings. In June 2020, Public Health England (PHE) initiated prospective national surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 in primary schools across England (sKIDs). We used this opportunity to assess the feasibility and agreeability of large-scale surveillance and testing for SARS-CoV-2 infections in school among staff, parents and students.Staff and students in 131 primary schools were asked to complete a questionnaire at recruitment and provide weekly nasal swabs for SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR testing (n = 86) or swabs with blood samples for antibody testing (n = 45) at the beginning and end the summer half-term. In six blood sampling schools, students were asked to complete a pictorial questionnaire before and after their investigations.In total, 135 children aged 4-7 years (n = 40) or 8-11 years (n = 95) completed the pictorial questionnaire fully or partially. Prior to sampling, oral fluid sampling was the most acceptable test (107/132, 81%) followed by throat swabs (80/134, 59%), nose swabs (77/132, 58%), and blood tests (48/130, 37%). Younger students were more nervous about all tests than older students but, after completing their tests, most children reported a ""better than expected"" experience with all the investigations. Students were more likely to agree to additional testing for nose swabs (93/113, 82%) and oral fluid (93/114, 82%), followed by throat swabs (85/113, 75%) and blood tests (72/108, 67%). Parents (n = 3,994) and staff (n = 2,580) selected a preference for weekly testing with nose swabs, throat swabs or oral fluid sampling, although staff were more flexible about testing frequency.Primary school staff and parents were supportive of regular tests for SARS-CoV-2 and selected a preference for weekly testing. Children preferred nose swabs and oral fluids over throat swabs or blood sampling."
https://openalex.org/W3194104488,"The aim of our study was to assess the importance of different Colombian bioregions in terms of the supply of useful plant species and the quality of the available distribution data. We assembled a dataset of georeferenced collection localities of all vascular plants of Colombia available from global and local online databases. We then assembled a list of species, subspecies and varieties of Colombia's useful plants and retrieved all point locality information associated with these taxa. We overlaid both datasets with a map of Colombia's bioregions to retrieve all species and useful species distribution records in each bioregion. To assess the reliability of our estimates of species numbers, we identified information gaps, in geographic and environmental space, by estimating their completeness and coverage. Our results confirmed that Colombia's third largest bioregion, the Andean moist forest followed by the Amazon, Pacific, Llanos and Caribbean moist forests contained the largest numbers of useful plant species. Medicinal use was the most common useful attribute across all bioregions, followed by Materials, Environmental uses, and Human Food. In all bioregions, except for the Andean páramo, the proportion of well-surveyed 10×10 km grid cells (with ≥ 25 observation records of useful plants) was below 50% of the total number of surveyed cells. Poor survey coverage was observed in the three dry bioregions: Caribbean deserts and xeric shrublands, and Llanos and Caribbean dry forests. This suggests that additional primary data is needed. We document knowledge gaps that will hinder the incorporation of useful plants into Colombia's stated plans for a bioeconomy and their sustainable management. In particular, future research should focus on the generation of additional primary data on the distribution of useful plants in the Amazon and Llanos (Orinoquia) regions where both survey completeness and coverage appeared to be less adequate compared with other regions."
https://openalex.org/W3194773684,"More species in warm waters Past patterns of diversity can be used as a baseline for understanding how current, human-induced changes are affecting biodiversity. Womack et al . looked at mollusk fossils from 40 million years ago in New Zealand to determine how ocean temperatures influence species richness and functional redundancy, a measure of how many species fill similar ecological roles. Both richness and redundancy increased in periods with warmer water, meaning that there were more species and that those species often filled similar ecological roles. Such ecological redundancy can increase ecosystem resilience, and understanding its relationship with temperature can help us see where human activities are driving change. —SNV"

Many of these traffic collisions take place in urban areas, where traffic levels can be elevated. Yet, little is known about the extent to which urban population size impacts road traffic collision rates. Here, we use urban scaling models to analyse geographic and road traffic collision data from over 300 European urban areas in order to study this issue. Our results show that there is no significant change in the number of road traffic collisions per person for urban areas of different sizes. However, we find individual urban locations with traffic collision rates which are remarkably high. These findings have the potential to inform policies for the allocation of resources to prevent road traffic collisions across the different cities."
https://openalex.org/W3195309131,"In vertebrates, retinal rod and cone photoreceptor cells rely significantly on glycolysis. Lactate released from photoreceptor cells fuels neighboring retinal pigment epithelium cells and Müller glial cells through oxidative phosphorylation. To understand this highly heterogeneous metabolic environment around photoreceptor cells, single-cell analysis is needed. Here, we visualized cellular AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activity and ATP levels in the retina by two-photon microscopy. Transgenic mice expressing a hyBRET-AMPK biosensor were used for measuring the AMPK activity. GO-ATeam2 transgenic mice were used for measuring the ATP level. Temporal metabolic responses were successfully detected in the live retinal explants upon drug perfusion. A glycolysis inhibitor, 2-deoxy-d-glucose (2-DG), activated AMPK and reduced ATP. These effects were clearly stronger in rods than in cones. Notably, rod AMPK and ATP started to recover at 30 min from the onset of 2-DG perfusion. Consistent with these findings, ex vivo electroretinogram recordings showed a transient slowdown in rod dim flash responses during a 60-min 2-DG perfusion, whereas cone responses were not affected. Based on these results, we propose that cones surrounded by highly glycolytic rods become less dependent on glycolysis, and rods also become less dependent on glycolysis within 60 min upon the glycolysis inhibition."

A Reproductive Survivorship Patient Reported Outcome Measure (RS-PROM) is not currently available but could assist patients address reproductive concerns. Purpose To develop and test the acceptability, feasibility and appropriateness of a RS-PROM tool to be used to assess reproductive needs of cancer survivors aged 18–45 years. Methods We reviewed the outcomes of a recently published audit of reproductive care provided in our cancer survivorship clinic to identify gaps in current service provided and used this along with available validated reproductive measures, to develop this pilot RS-PROM. Survivors aged 18–45 years either attending the SCH survivorship clinic over a 1-year period or participants on the Australasian Oncofertility Registry (AOFR) who had agreed to be contacted for future research studies were asked to complete the RS-PROM and a questionnaire on the acceptability, feasibility and appropriateness of content included. Results One-hundred and fifty patients participated (61.3% females). Median age at cancer diagnosis was 24.5 years (range: 2–45 years). Eighty percent of participants reported the length of the RS-PROM was “just right”, 92% agreed they would not mind completing the RS-PROM and 92.7% were willing to answer all questions, with 97% agreeing that the RS-PROM would be an important tool in addressing difficult sexual/reproductive topics concerning with healthcare professionals. Conclusion The large majority of survivors participating in our pilot study found the RS-PROM to be an acceptable, feasible and useful tool to assist discussions of their sexual and reproductive health concerns and experiences with their clinical team."
https://openalex.org/W3194137272,"Aiming at conservative Maxwell equations with periodic oscillatory solutions, we adopt exponentially fitted trapezoidal scheme to approximate the temporal and spatial derivatives. The scheme is a multisymplectic scheme. Under periodic boundary condition, the scheme satisfies two discrete energy conservation laws. The scheme also preserves two discrete divergences. To reduce computation cost, we split the original Maxwell equations into three local one-dimension (LOD) Maxwell equations. Then exponentially fitted trapezoidal scheme, applied to the resulted LOD equations, generates LOD multisymplectic scheme. We prove the unconditional stability and convergence of the LOD multisymplectic scheme. Convergence of numerical dispersion relation is also analyzed. At last, we present two numerical examples with periodic oscillatory solutions to confirm the theoretical analysis. Numerical results indicate that the LOD multisymplectic scheme is efficient, stable and conservative in solving conservative Maxwell equations with oscillatory solutions. In addition, to one-dimension Maxwell equations, we apply least square method and LOD multisymplectic scheme to fit the electric permittivity by using exact solution disturbed with small random errors as measured data. Numerical results of parameter inversion fit well with measured data, which shows that least square method combined with LOD multisymplectic scheme is efficient to estimate the model parameter under small random disturbance."
https://openalex.org/W3195073613,"Landfill site selection is problematic in many countries, especially developing nations where there is rapid population growth, which leads to high levels of inadequate waste disposal. To find sustainable landfill sites in sprawling cities, this study presents an approach that combines geographic information system (GIS) with multi-criteria (social, environmental and, technical criteria) and the population growth projection. The greater Maputo area in Mozambique was selected as a representative city for the study, which is undergoing rapid urbanization. Six criteria, i.e., land use, transport networks, hydrology, conservation reserve, geology and slope, were considered and overlaid in the GIS using an analytic hierarchy process (AHP). The arithmetic projection of the population trend suggests that the greater Maputo area is experiencing a rapid and uncontrolled population growth, especially in Matola city. These pronounced changes in population then significantly change the landfill placement decision making. Dynamic and static scenarios were created, based on the analysis of multi-criteria and the areas likely to undergo future increased population growth. A comparative evaluation in a scenario of dynamic behavior considering future population showed that suitable areas for landfill sites have been drastically modified due to social and environmental factors affected by population distribution in some regions. The results indicate that some suitable areas can generate land use conflicts due to population growth with unplanned land use expansion. Finally, the western part of Matola city is recognized as the most recommendable landfill site, which can serve both Maputo and Matola city with affordable costs. This study provides an effective landfill placement decision making approach, which is possible to be applied anywhere, especially in developing countries to improve sustainable municipal solid waste management systems."
https://openalex.org/W3195683641,"Effective livestock vaccination has the potential to raise prosperity and food security for the rural poor in low and middle income countries. To understand factors affecting access to vaccination services, and guide future policy, smallholder farmers in three locations in India were questioned about vaccination of their cattle and buffalo, with particular reference to foot and mouth disease (FMD), haemorrhagic septicaemia (HS) and blackquarter (BQ). In the three regions 51%, 50%, and 31% of respondents reported vaccinating their livestock; well below any threshold for effective population level disease control. However, within the third region, 65% of respondents in villages immediately surrounding the Kaziranga National Park reported vaccinating their cattle. The majority of respondents in all three regions were aware of FMD and HS, awareness of BQ was high in the Kanha and Bandhavgarh regions, but much lower in the Kaziranga region. The majority of respondents had positive attitudes to vaccination; understood vaccination protected their animals from specific diseases; and wished to immunise their livestock. There was no significant association between the age or gender of respondent and the immunisation of their livestock. Common barriers to immunisation were: negative attitudes to vaccination; lack of awareness of date and time of vaccination events; and difficulty presenting animals. Poor access to vaccination services was significantly associated with not vaccinating livestock. Fear of adverse reactions to vaccines was not significantly associated with not vaccinating livestock. Respondents who reported that vets or animal health workers (AHWs) were their main source of animal health knowledge were significantly more likely to have immunised their livestock in the last twelve months. Participants cited poor communication from vaccinators as problematic, both in publicising immunisation programmes, and explaining the purpose of vaccination. Where vaccinations were provided free of charge, farmers commonly displayed passive attitudes to accessing vaccination services, awaiting organised “immunisation drives” rather than seeking vaccination themselves. Based on these findings the following recommendations are made to improve participation and effectiveness of immunisation programmes. Programmes should be planned to integrate with annual cycles of: disease risk, agricultural activity, seasonal climate, social calendar of villages; and maximise efficiency for vaccinators. Dates and times of immunisation in each village must be well publicised, as respondents frequently reported missing the vaccinators. Relevant farmer education should precede immunisation programmes to mitigate against poor knowledge or negative attitudes. Immunisation drives must properly engage beneficiaries, particularly ensuring that services are accessible to female livestock keepers, and sharing some responsibilities with local farmers. Payment of a small monetary contribution by animal keepers could be considered to encourage responsibility for disease prevention, making vaccination an active process by farmers."
https://openalex.org/W3195987413,"Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) has a 5-year relative survival of 50%, partly because markers of early-stage disease are not available in current clinical diagnostics. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether EOC is associated with transcriptional profiles in blood collected up to 7 years before diagnosis. For this, we used RNA-stabilized whole blood, which contains circulating immune cells, from a sample of EOC cases from the population-based Norwegian Women and Cancer (NOWAC) postgenome cohort. We explored case-control differences in gene expression in all EOC (66 case-control pairs), as well as associations between gene expression and metastatic EOC (56 pairs), serous EOC (45 pairs, 44 of which were metastatic), and interval from blood sample collection to diagnosis (≤3 or >3 years; 34 and 31 pairs, respectively). Lastly, we assessed differential expression of genes associated with EOC in published functional genomics studies that used blood samples collected from newly diagnosed women. After adjustment for multiple testing, this nested case-control study revealed no significant case-control differences in gene expression in all EOC (false discovery rate q>0.96). With the exception of a few probes, the log2 fold change values obtained in gene-wise linear models were below ±0.2. P-values were lowest in analyses of metastatic EOC (80% of which were serous EOC). No common transcriptional profile was indicated by interval to diagnosis; when comparing the 100 genes with the lowest p-values in gene-wise tests in samples collected ≤3 and >3 years before EOC diagnosis, no overlap in these genes was observed. Among 86 genes linked to ovarian cancer in previous publications, our data contained expression values for 42, and of these, tests of LIME1, GPR162, STAB1, and SKAP1, resulted in unadjusted p<0.05. Although limited by sample size, our findings indicated less variation in blood gene expression between women with similar tumor characteristics."

Participants were exposed to images of nature and urban scenes that had been matched a priori for their liking scores by an independent participant sample (n = 300). Participants (N = 44) were either asked to memorise each image during walking or to rate each image for its visual discomfort after each walk. Irrespective of experimental task, liking score but not environment type predicted gait velocity. Moreover, subjective visual discomfort was predictive of gait velocity. The positive impact of nature described in the literature thus might, at least in part, be due to people's aesthetic preferences for nature images."

We sought to clarify the prevalence of this condition and its predisposing factors in Zambia by pooling data from previous studies conducted in hospital and community settings.Gastric pH was measured in participants from five separate studies by collecting gastric aspirate from fasted adults and children under 3 years of age undergoing gastroscopy. Gastric pH was correlated with serological testing for Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infections.We studied 597 individuals (487 adults and 110 children). Hypochlorhydria was present in 53% of adults and 31% of children. HIV infection was detected in 41% of adults and 11% of children. H. pylori serology was available for 366 individuals: 93% of adults and 6% of children were seropositive. In univariate analysis, hypochlorhydria was significantly associated with HIV seropositivity (OR 1.7; 95% CI 1.2-2.4; p = 0.004) and H. pylori antibody seropositivity (OR 4.9; 95% CI 2.8-8.6; p<0.0001), and with advancing age in HIV negative individuals (p = 0.0001). In multivariable analysis, only H. pylori was associated with hypochlorhydria (OR 4.0; 95% CI 2.2-7.2; p<0.0001) while excluding possible exposure to proton pump inhibitors.Hypochlorhydria is common in our population, with H. pylori being the dominant factor. Only young HIV seronegative individuals had a low prevalence of hypochlorhydria. This may have implications for the risk of other health conditions including gastric cancer."

https://openalex.org/W3195846492,"At the population level we would expect that people with obesity undergo diabetes screening tests more often than people with overweight and much more often than people with normal weight. We described the trends of diabetes screening according to body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference (WC) in Peru.Pooled analysis of health national surveys (2015-2019); men and women aged 35-70 years. We used relative frequencies to study: among those who have had a glucose test in the last year, how many there were in each BMI and WC category. We fitted a Poisson model to study whether people with high BMI or WC were more likely to have had a glucose test.People with overweight (PR = 1.34; 95% CI: 1.29-1.38), obesity (PR = 1.57; 95% CI: 1.51-1.63) and central obesity (PR = 1.63; 95% CI: 1.35-1.96) were more likely to have had a glucose test. At the sub-national level, there was one (of twenty-five) region in which men with obesity were more often screened for diabetes than men with overweight and much more than men with normal weight. There were seven regions in which women with obesity were the most often screened for diabetes.Consistent with a risk-based prevention approach, people with obesity would be screened for diabetes more often than those with overweight and those with normal weight. This ideal profile was only observed in few regions. Diabetes screening strategies should be strengthened and homogenised, so that they reach those at high risk of diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W3196130547,"Paclitaxel® (PC) is one of the most effective and profitable anti-cancer drugs. The most promising sources of this compound are natural materials such as tissue cultures of Taxus species and, more recently, hazelnut (Corylus avellana L.). A large part of the PC biosynthetic pathway in the yew tree and a few steps in the hazelnut have been identified. Since understanding the biosynthetic pathway of plant-based medicinal metabolites is an effective step toward their development and engineering, this paper aimed to identify taxadiene-5α-ol-O-acetyltransferase (TDAT) in hazelnut. TDAT is one of the key genes involved in the third step of the PC biosynthetic pathway. In this study, the TDAT gene was isolated using the nested-PCR method and then characterized. The cotyledon-derived cell mass induced with 150 μM of methyl jasmonate (MeJA) was utilized to isolate RNA and synthesize the first-strand cDNA. The full-length cDNA of TDAT is 1423 bp long and contains a 1302 bp ORF encoding 433 amino acids. The phylogenetic analysis of this gene revealed high homology with its ortholog genes in Quercus suber and Juglans regia. Bioinformatics analyses were used to predict the secondary and tertiary structures of the protein. Due to the lack of signal peptide, protein structure prediction suggested that this protein may operate at the cytoplasm. The homologous superfamily of the T5AT protein, encoded by TDAT, has two domains. The highest and lowest hydrophobicity of amino acids were found in proline 142 and lysine 56, respectively. T5AT protein fragment had 24 hydrophobic regions. The tertiary structure of this protein was designed using Modeler software (V.9.20), and its structure was verified based on the results of the Verify3D (89.46%) and ERRAT (90.3061) programs. The T5AT enzyme belongs to the superfamily of the transferase, and the amino acids histidine 164, cysteine 165, leucine 166, histidine 167, and Aspartic acid 168 resided at its active site. More characteristics of TDAT, which would aid PC engineering programs and maximize its production in hazelnut, were discussed."
https://openalex.org/W3196152732,"We present the first comparative plastome study of Pleurothallidinae with analyses of structural and molecular characteristics and identification of the ten most-variable regions to be incorporated in future phylogenetic studies. We sequenced complete plastomes of eight species in the subtribe and compared phylogenetic results of these to parallel analyses of their nuclear ribosomal DNA operon (26S, 18S, and 5.8S plus associated spacers) and partial mitochondrial genome sequences (29-38 genes and partial introns). These plastomes have the typical quadripartite structure for which gene content is similar to those of other orchids, with variation only in the composition of the ndh genes. The independent loss of ndh genes had an impact on which genes border the inverted repeats and thus the size of the small single-copy region, leading to variation in overall plastome length. Analyses of 68 coding sequences indicated the same pattern of codon usage as in other orchids, and 13 protein-coding genes under positive selection were detected. Also, we identified 62 polymorphic microsatellite loci and ten highly variable regions, for which we designed primers. Phylogenomic analyses showed that the top ten mutational hotspots represent well the phylogenetic relationships found with whole plastome sequences. However, strongly supported incongruence was observed among plastid, nuclear ribosomal DNA operon, and mitochondrial DNA trees, indicating possible occurrence of incomplete lineage sorting and/or introgressive hybridization. Despite the incongruence, the mtDNA tree retrieved some clades found in other analyses. These results, together with performance in recent studies, support a future role for mitochondrial markers in Pleurothallidinae phylogenetics."
https://openalex.org/W3193753060,"ABO blood types could be a biological predisposition for depression. The present cross-sectional analysis was conducted amid the second wave of COVID-19 in Japan during July 2020. We wanted to investigate the association between ABO blood types and depressive symptoms among workers (352 men and 864 women, aged 21–73 years) of a medical institution in Tokyo, Japan, which took a leading role in the response to COVID-19 in the country. A Poisson regression model with a robust variance estimator was used to estimate the prevalence ratio (PR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for depressive symptoms associated with ABO blood types. Overall, the prevalence of depressive symptoms (using two questions employed from a Two-question case-finding instrument) was 22.0%. The adjusted PRs (95% CI) for depressive symptoms, comparing the carriers of blood type O, A, and AB with those of type B, were 0.88 (0.66, 1.18), 0.81 (0.62, 1.07), and 1.07 (0.74, 1.53), respectively. There was no difference in the prevalence of depressive symptoms between non-B and B carriers. The present study did not support the association of ABO blood types with depressive symptoms."
https://openalex.org/W3194683518,"Moments before I presented my first seminar as a postdoc to my lab group, my eyelids grew heavy and my sense of alertness dissolved into a dreamlike state. It was a sleep attack—a result of narcolepsy, which I was diagnosed with 2 years earlier. I apologized for my incessant yawning and continued with my talk despite an overwhelming urge to sleep. It’s one of many moments when my narcolepsy made my career difficult. But ever since I learned of a renowned scientist who has narcolepsy, I’ve known I can succeed in science, too.



> “I … feared my career in science had reached a dead end.” 

I’ve fought the urge to sleep for much of my life. At a young age, I fell asleep in bizarre places—on the front lawn, in a pile of stuffed animals—and in school I was frequently reprimanded for yawning. Fearing others would think I was lazy, I got in the habit of working harder on my schoolwork than everyone else. As an undergraduate, I relied on energy drinks to keep me awake through long hours studying. But when exams were over, I’d stay in bed for days to recuperate.

Graduate school was more difficult because my work was never “done.” There was always a new paper to read or an experiment to plan. Shortly after passing my Ph.D. qualifying exam, I worked in the lab every day for more than 30 days straight. That sapped what little energy I had in the first place.

The stress and exhaustion exacerbated my sleep issues. On more than one occasion, I had to postpone planned experiments and rush home to take a nap. During conversations with my mentor, my stream of thought would sometimes run dry midsentence and I would have to ask him what I was talking about.

I thought depression caused my brain fog and fatigue, so I started seeing a psychiatrist. After 2 years, and multiple medications, I was no better. So she had me complete a sleep questionnaire, which led to a referral to a sleep clinic and a series of sleep tests.

Shortly thereafter I received my diagnosis: narcolepsy. The news was a relief because it meant I might finally receive appropriate treatment and learn how to manage my symptoms. But I also feared my career in science had reached a dead end. As a neuroscientist, how could I uncover the inner workings of the brain with one that is “broken”? How could I succeed if I had to put sleep hygiene ahead of science?

Then I stumbled on an article about George Church, a prominent Harvard University geneticist who has narcolepsy. Calling his condition “a feature, not a bug,” he said his daytime bouts of sleep are opportunities for creative, quasi-conscious thought, when he’s hatched some of his best ideas. Reading about his condition was empowering. It gave me a sense of belonging, one that went beyond “sure, you can enter our circle” to “you’re in our circle and we’re better for it.”

I wrote Dr. Church an email, telling him how much his perspective meant to me. To my surprise, he sent a detailed reply. “Lecture classes were very hard for me,” he wrote. “I even flunked out of my first attempt at Ph.D.” His words helped me cultivate a fierce sense of self-compassion. I began to accept that my best can look different from day to day and that I might struggle with some aspects of academia more than others.

I also implemented many of the strategies he recommended for dealing with narcolepsy, including waiting until evening to eat a large meal and breaking up the day physically with a mixture of standing, pacing, and sitting. I registered with my university’s disability office and made requests for workplace accommodations. The university bought me a standing desk, which helped me feel more alert, and I received permission to take naps at work. I made similar requests when I started a postdoc last year.

I still harbor fears of seeming lazy, and I worry that the brain fog I suffer from will one day settle and never lift. But these fears do not stop me from continuing to pursue my goal of managing my own lab one day. Thanks to Dr. Church, I know it’s possible—as long as I take care of myself."
https://openalex.org/W3194693220,"Based on product lifecycle management (PLM) theory and social comparison theory, this paper constructs a performance ranking model of automobile product development project team members, uses an active server provider (ASP) to develop the system, realizes the online operation and real-time analysis of the performance management system, and solves the problems of the low efficiency, low morale and unfair assessment of product development team members caused by traditional performance assessment. The performance management platform for the team members of the automotive product development project uses a PLM system to realize a systematic and standardized list of project functions and provide a performance appraisal management system that can be evaluated and fairly compared for project team members. Based on the performance appraisal practice of automotive product development project team members of M Automotive Products Company, this study verified the feasibility of the ranking model’s transformation to work habits based on the predetermined and result data of the mission completion rate, the punctuality rate and the degree of improvement of the management level of product development project team. Through the tracking of the team performance ranking function, it is found that the model can solve the problems of untimely assessment and insufficient incentives in the current traditional performance appraisal, enhance the overall enthusiasm of the team, and give full play to the subjective initiative of the team."
