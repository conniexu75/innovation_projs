https://openalex.org/W3107730772,"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus is causing a global pandemic, and cases continue to rise. Most infected individuals experience mildly symptomatic coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), but it is unknown whether this can induce persistent immune memory that could contribute to immunity. We performed a longitudinal assessment of individuals recovered from mild COVID-19 to determine whether they develop and sustain multifaceted SARS-CoV-2-specific immunological memory. Recovered individuals developed SARS-CoV-2-specific immunoglobulin (IgG) antibodies, neutralizing plasma, and memory B and memory T cells that persisted for at least 3 months. Our data further reveal that SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG memory B cells increased over time. Additionally, SARS-CoV-2-specific memory lymphocytes exhibited characteristics associated with potent antiviral function: memory T cells secreted cytokines and expanded upon antigen re-encounter, whereas memory B cells expressed receptors capable of neutralizing virus when expressed as monoclonal antibodies. Therefore, mild COVID-19 elicits memory lymphocytes that persist and display functional hallmarks of antiviral immunity."
https://openalex.org/W3111079131,"Objective To investigate the relationship between viral load and secondary transmission in novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Methods Epidemiological and clinical data were obtained from immunocompetent laboratory-confirmed patients with COVID-19 who were admitted to and/or from whom viral loads were measured at Toyama University Hospital. Using a case-control approach, index patients who transmitted the disease to at least one other patient were analysed as “cases” (index patients) compared with patients who were not the cause of secondary transmission (non-index patients, analysed as “controls”). The viral load time courses were assessed between the index and non-index symptomatic patients using non-linear regression employing a standard one-phase decay model. Results In total, 28 patients were included in the analysis. Median viral load at the initial sample collection was significantly higher in symptomatic than in asymptomatic patients and in adults than in children. Among symptomatic patients (n = 18), non-linear regression models showed that the estimated viral load at onset was higher in the index than in the non-index patients (median [95% confidence interval]: 6.6 [5.2–8.2] vs. 3.1 [1.5–4.8] log copies/μL, respectively). In adult (symptomatic and asymptomatic) patients (n = 21), median viral load at the initial sample collection was significantly higher in the index than in the non-index patients (p = 0.015, 3.3 vs. 1.8 log copies/μL, respectively). Conclusions High nasopharyngeal viral loads around onset may contribute to secondary transmission of COVID-19. Viral load may help provide a better understanding of why transmission is observed in some instances, but not in others, especially among household contacts."
https://openalex.org/W3113005448,"Timely identification of COVID-19 patients at high risk of mortality can significantly improve patient management and resource allocation within hospitals. This study seeks to develop and validate a data-driven personalized mortality risk calculator for hospitalized COVID-19 patients. De-identified data was obtained for 3,927 COVID-19 positive patients from six independent centers, comprising 33 different hospitals. Demographic, clinical, and laboratory variables were collected at hospital admission. The COVID-19 Mortality Risk (CMR) tool was developed using the XGBoost algorithm to predict mortality. Its discrimination performance was subsequently evaluated on three validation cohorts. The derivation cohort of 3,062 patients has an observed mortality rate of 26.84%. Increased age, decreased oxygen saturation (≤ 93%), elevated levels of C-reactive protein (≥ 130 mg/L), blood urea nitrogen (≥ 18 mg/dL), and blood creatinine (≥ 1.2 mg/dL) were identified as primary risk factors, validating clinical findings. The model obtains out-of-sample AUCs of 0.90 (95% CI, 0.87–0.94) on the derivation cohort. In the validation cohorts, the model obtains AUCs of 0.92 (95% CI, 0.88–0.95) on Seville patients, 0.87 (95% CI, 0.84–0.91) on Hellenic COVID-19 Study Group patients, and 0.81 (95% CI, 0.76–0.85) on Hartford Hospital patients. The CMR tool is available as an online application at covidanalytics.io/mortality_calculator and is currently in clinical use. The CMR model leverages machine learning to generate accurate mortality predictions using commonly available clinical features. This is the first risk score trained and validated on a cohort of COVID-19 patients from Europe and the United States."

https://openalex.org/W3111854290,"Binding of arrestin to phosphorylated G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) controls many aspects of cell signaling. The number and arrangement of phosphates may vary substantially for a given GPCR, and different phosphorylation patterns trigger different arrestin-mediated effects. Here, we determine how GPCR phosphorylation influences arrestin behavior by using atomic-level simulations and site-directed spectroscopy to reveal the effects of phosphorylation patterns on arrestin binding and conformation. We find that patterns favoring binding differ from those favoring activation-associated conformational change. Both binding and conformation depend more on arrangement of phosphates than on their total number, with phosphorylation at different positions sometimes exerting opposite effects. Phosphorylation patterns selectively favor a wide variety of arrestin conformations, differently affecting arrestin sites implicated in scaffolding distinct signaling proteins. We also reveal molecular mechanisms of these phenomena. Our work reveals the structural basis for the long-standing ""barcode"" hypothesis and has important implications for design of functionally selective GPCR-targeted drugs."
https://openalex.org/W3111146891,"Most proteins assemble into multisubunit complexes1. The persistence of these complexes across evolutionary time is usually explained as the result of natural selection for functional properties that depend on multimerization, such as intersubunit allostery or the capacity to do mechanical work2. In many complexes, however, multimerization does not enable any known function3. An alternative explanation is that multimers could become entrenched if substitutions accumulate that are neutral in multimers but deleterious in monomers; purifying selection would then prevent reversion to the unassembled form, even if assembly per se does not enhance biological function3-7. Here we show that a hydrophobic mutational ratchet systematically entrenches molecular complexes. By applying ancestral protein reconstruction and biochemical assays to the evolution of steroid hormone receptors, we show that an ancient hydrophobic interface, conserved for hundreds of millions of years, is entrenched because exposure of this interface to solvent reduces protein stability and causes aggregation, even though the interface makes no detectable contribution to function. Using structural bioinformatics, we show that a universal mutational propensity drives sites that are buried in multimeric interfaces to accumulate hydrophobic substitutions to levels that are not tolerated in monomers. In a database of hundreds of families of multimers, most show signatures of long-term hydrophobic entrenchment. It is therefore likely that many protein complexes persist because a simple ratchet-like mechanism entrenches them across evolutionary time, even when they are functionally gratuitous."
https://openalex.org/W3111602020,"The formation of arteries is thought to occur by the induction of a highly conserved arterial genetic programme in a subset of vessels that will later experience an increase in oxygenated blood flow1,2. The initial steps of arterial specification require both the VEGF and Notch signalling pathways3-5. Here, we combine inducible genetic mosaics and transcriptomics to modulate and define the function of these signalling pathways in cell proliferation, arteriovenous differentiation and mobilization. We show that endothelial cells with high levels of VEGF or Notch signalling are intrinsically biased to mobilize and form arteries; however, they are not genetically pre-determined, and can also form veins. Mechanistically, we found that increased levels of VEGF and Notch signalling in pre-arterial capillaries suppresses MYC-dependent metabolic and cell-cycle activities, and promotes the incorporation of endothelial cells into arteries. Mosaic lineage-tracing studies showed that endothelial cells that lack the Notch-RBPJ transcriptional activator complex rarely form arteries; however, these cells regained the ability to form arteries when the function of MYC was suppressed. Thus, the development of arteries does not require the direct induction of a Notch-dependent arterial differentiation programme, but instead depends on the timely suppression of endothelial cell-cycle progression and metabolism, a process that precedes arterial mobilization and complete differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W3112028900,"The ion channels Piezo1 and TRPV4 have both, independently, been implicated in high venous pressure– and fluid shear stress–induced vascular hyperpermeability in endothelial cells. However, the mechanism by which Piezo1 and TRPV4 channels execute the same function is poorly understood. Here we demonstrate that Piezo1 regulates TRPV4 channel activation in endothelial cells and that Piezo1-mediated TRPV4 channel opening is a function of the strength and duration of fluid shear stress. We first confirmed that either fluid shear stress or the Piezo1 agonist, Yoda1, led to an elevation in intracellular calcium ([Ca2+]i) and that application of the Piezo1 antagonist, GsMTx4, completely blocked this change. We discovered that high and prolonged shear stress caused sustained [Ca2+]i elevation that was blocked by inhibition of TRPV4 channel opening. Moreover, Piezo1 stimulated TRPV4 opening through activation of phospholipase A2. TRPV4-dependent sustained [Ca2+]i elevation was responsible for fluid shear stress–mediated and Piezo1-mediated disruption of adherens junctions and actin remodeling. Blockade of TRPV4 channels with the selective TRPV4 blocker, HC067047, prevented the loss of endothelial cell integrity and actin disruption induced by Yoda1 or shear stress and prevented Piezo1-induced monocyte adhesion to endothelial cell monolayers. These findings demonstrate that Piezo1 activation by fluid shear stress initiates a calcium signal that causes TRPV4 opening, which in turn is responsible for the sustained phase calcium elevation that triggers pathological events in endothelial cells. Thus, deleterious effects of shear stress are initiated by Piezo1 but require TRPV4. The ion channels Piezo1 and TRPV4 have both, independently, been implicated in high venous pressure– and fluid shear stress–induced vascular hyperpermeability in endothelial cells.

Endothelial cells are under constant mechanical force due to blood pressure and flow in both the arterial and venous systems. Blood flowing across endothelial cells within blood vessels generates shear stress. Under normal physiological conditions, a dynamic balance between mechanical shear stress and biological responses maintains endothelial integrity (1Zhou J. Li Y.S. Chien S.

Piezo1 is a mechanically activated ion channel and mediates pressure induced pancreatitis.Nat. Commun. 2018; 9: 1715Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) and is linked to TRPV4 (33Swain S.M. Romac J.M. Shahid R.A. Pandol S.J. Liedtke W. Vigna S.R. Liddle R.A. TRPV4 channel opening mediates pressure-induced pancreatitis initiated by Piezo1 activation.J Clin. Invest. 2020; 130: 2527-2541Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Therefore, we postulated that Piezo1 signaling coupled to TRPV4 activation may also account for the effects of shear stress on endothelial cells. Here we demonstrate that high shear stress activates Piezo1 and causes an initial increase in [Ca2+]i that triggers activation of TRPV4 in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and HEK293T cells expressing both Piezo1 and TRPV4. Activation of TRPV4 causes a sustained [Ca2+]i elevation leading to loss of endothelial cell contacts, actin disruption, and endothelial cell monocyte adhesion. Shear stress is a physiological activator of mechanical ion channels in endothelial cells. In endothelial cells, shear stress regulates levels of intracellular calcium ([Ca2+]i) and downstream calcium signaling (24Ryskamp D.A. Frye A.M. Phuong T.T. Yarishkin O. Jo A.O. Xu Y. Lakk M.

We evaluated the magnitude and duration of shear stress forces that affected [Ca2+]i in HUVECs by applying shear stresses at physiological level (≤5 dyne/cm2) and pathological levels (37Ballermann B.J.

Shear stresses of 4 and 12 dyne/cm2 applied for 1 min increased peak [Ca2+]i (Fig. 1, A–B). Applying a force of 12 dyne/cm2 for 1 min caused a sustained elevation in [Ca2+]i (intensity calculated at 8 min after initiation of force), but the same force applied for a shorter time (12 dyne/cm2 for 5 s) or lower shear stress (4 dyne/cm2) for 1 min elicited only a transient [Ca2+]i rise and did not produce prolonged elevation in [Ca2+]i (Fig. 1, A–C). Endothelial cells express the mechanically sensitive, calcium-permeable ion channel Piezo1 (14Li J. Hou B. Tumova S. Muraki K. Bruns A. Ludlow M.J. Sedo A. Hyman A.J. McKeown L. Young R.S.

Invest. 2016; 126: 4527-4536Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). As an initial step in evaluating its role, we utilized the Piezo1 agonist, Yoda1. Yoda1 (2 μM and 5 μM), in a dose-dependent manner, increased peak [Ca2+]i and caused sustained [Ca2+]i elevations (fluorescence intensity calculated at 8 min after Yoda1 application) (Fig. 1, D–F). Thus, the level of [Ca2+]i produced by Piezo1 activation in HUVECs was dependent upon the Yoda1 concentration (Fig. 1, D–F). To determine if Piezo1 was responsible for shear stress–induced calcium influx, we used the mechanoreceptor blocker, GsMTx4 (39Bae C. Sachs F. Gottlieb P.A. The mechanosensitive ion channel Piezo1 is inhibited by the peptide GsMTx4.Biochemistry. 2011; 50: 6295-6300Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). GsMTx4 (10 μM) completely inhibited the shear stress (12 dyne/cm2)–induced elevation in [Ca2+]i (Fig. 1, G–I). We observed that a higher dose of Yoda1 (10 μM) or GsMTx4 (10 μM) applied for up to 11 min did not affect the cell viability as all cells treated with Yoda1 or GsMTx4 responded to the calcium ionophore, ionomycin (1 μM) (Fig. S1, A–D). Although Piezo1 directly senses mechanical force (18Syeda R. Florendo M.N. Cox C.D. Kefauver J.M. Santos J.S. Martinac B. Patapoutian A. Piezo1 channels are inherently mechanosensitive.Cell Rep. 2016; 17: 1739-1746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar), its fast inactivation kinetics and low single-channel conductance (15Coste B. Mathur J. Schmidt M. Earley T.J. Ranade S. Petrus M.J. Dubin A.E. Patapoutian A. Piezo1 and Piezo2 are essential components of distinct mechanically activated cation channels.Science. 2010; 330: 55-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (1433) Google Scholar) render it unlikely to be directly responsible for the sustained elevation in [Ca2+]i seen with higher shear forces. It is notable that endothelial cells also express another calcium-permeable ion channel—TRPV4 (4Mendoza S.A. Fang J. Gutterman D.D. Wilcox D.A. Bubolz A.H. Li R. Suzuki M. Zhang D.X.

Even though cells expressing TRPV4 exhibit mechanosensitivity, direct channel activation by mechanical force has not been demonstrated (9Bubolz A.H. Mendoza S.A. Zheng X. Zinkevich N.S. Li R.

Anandamide and arachidonic acid use epoxyeicosatrienoic acids to activate TRPV4 channels.Nature. 2003; 424: 434-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (795) Google Scholar). Therefore, the ability of shear stress to activate TRPV4 channels seems to be indirect. To evaluate the contribution of TRPV4 to sense shear force, we tested 1 μM HC067047 (HC067), a concentration that has been reported to completely block TRPV4 channel activity (21Everaerts W. Zhen X. Ghosh D. Vriens J. Gevaert T. Gilbert J.P. Hayward N.J. McNamara C.R. Xue F. Moran M.M. Strassmaier T. Uykal E. Owsianik G. Vennekens R. De Ridder D. et al.Inhibition of the cation channel TRPV4 improves bladder function in mice and rats with cyclophosphamide-induced cystitis.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2010; 107: 19084-19089Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). HC067 slightly reduced the initial rise in [Ca2+]i produced by shear force applied at 12 dyne/cm2 for 1 min but completely blocked the sustained calcium elevation (Fig. 2, A–C). This observation demonstrates that activation of the TRPV4 channel is responsible for the secondary, sustained elevation in [Ca2+]i produced by shear force. Addtionally, HC067 (1 μM) completely blocked the Yoda1-induced sustained elevation in [Ca2+]i without affecting the initial rise in [Ca2+]i, confirming that the Yoda1-induced and shear stress–induced secondary [Ca2+]i phase is due to activation of TRPV4 and the initial transient [Ca2+]i rise occurs through activation of Piezo1 (Fig. 2, D–F). To determine if selective activation of TRPV4 channels can reproduce the sustained [Ca2+]i elevation, we tested the effects of the TRPV4 agonist, GSK1016790A (GSK101) and the endogenous TRPV4 agonist 5',6'-EET. Both GSK101 (50 nM) and 5',6'-EET (5 μM) produced sustained [Ca2+]i elevations in HUVECs (Fig. 2, G–I); however, the kinetics of the [Ca2+]i elevations were somewhat different. GSK101 caused a more rapid rise and subsequent decline in [Ca2+]i rise than 5',6'-EET. A detailed study of the gating mechanisms, binding affinity, and half-lives of GSK101 and 5',6'-EET and their dose-dependent effects on TRPV4 activation will be needed to fully explain these changes. Along these lines, we observed that a lower concentration of 5',6'-EET reduced both the maximum and sustained [Ca2+]i elevations in HUVECs (Fig. S2, A–C). Intracellular signals including PLA2 have been shown to activate TRPV4 (6Loot A.E. Popp R. Fisslthaler B. Vriens J. Nilius B. Fleming I.

https://openalex.org/W3111336653,"Pterosaurs were the first vertebrates to evolve powered flight1 and comprised one of the main evolutionary radiations in terrestrial ecosystems of the Mesozoic era (approximately 252–66 million years ago), but their origin has remained an unresolved enigma in palaeontology since the nineteenth century2–4. These flying reptiles have been hypothesized to be the close relatives of a wide variety of reptilian clades, including dinosaur relatives2–8, and there is still a major morphological gap between those forms and the oldest, unambiguous pterosaurs from the Upper Triassic series. Here, using recent discoveries of well-preserved cranial remains, microcomputed tomography scans of fragile skull bones (jaws, skull roofs and braincases) and reliably associated postcrania, we demonstrate that lagerpetids—a group of cursorial, non-volant dinosaur precursors—are the sister group of pterosaurs, sharing numerous synapomorphies across the entire skeleton. This finding substantially shortens the temporal and morphological gap between the oldest pterosaurs and their closest relatives and simultaneously strengthens the evidence that pterosaurs belong to the avian line of archosaurs. Neuroanatomical features related to the enhanced sensory abilities of pterosaurs9 are already present in lagerpetids, which indicates that these features evolved before flight. Our evidence illuminates the first steps of the assembly of the pterosaur body plan, whose conquest of aerial space represents a remarkable morphofunctional innovation in vertebrate evolution. Lagerpetids, bipedal archosaurs that are thought to be related to dinosaurs, are instead a sister group to pterosaurs, and although they have no obvious flight adaptations they share numerous synapomorphies with pterosaurs across the entire skeleton."

Participants were approached via social media (SM), and 2006 participants (953 [47.5%] females and 1053 [52.5%] males) were included in this study. SM was the leading source of information for 43.9% of the study participants. Most of the participants had various misconceptions such as “females are more vulnerable to develop this infection, rinsing the nose with saline and sipping water every 15 minutes protects against Coronavirus, flu and pneumonia vaccines protect against this virus.” About one-third of participants (31.7%) had self-reported disturbed social, mental, and psychological wellbeing due to the pandemic. Many participants became more religious during this pandemic. Two-thirds of the study participants (68.1%) had good knowledge scores. Attitudes were highly positive in 93.1%, and practice scores were adequate in 97.7% of the participants. Participants’ educational status was a predictor of high knowledge scores. Male gender and divorced status were predictors of low practice scores, and aged 51–61 years, private-sector jobs, and student status were predictors of high practice scores. Being Saudi was a predictor of a positive attitude, while the male gender and divorced status were predictors of a negative attitude. Higher education was a predictor of good concepts, while the older age and businessmen were predictors of misconceptions. Overall, our study participants had good knowledge, positive attitudes, and good practices, but several myths were also prevalent. Being a PhD and a Saudi national predicted high knowledge scores and positive attitudes, respectively. A higher education level was a predictor of good concepts, and students, private-sector jobs, and aged 51–61 years were predictors of high practice scores. Study participants had good understanding of the effects of this pandemic."
https://openalex.org/W3112358871,"Behavioural experiences activate the FOS transcription factor in sparse populations of neurons that are critical for encoding and recalling specific events1-3. However, there is limited understanding of the mechanisms by which experience drives circuit reorganization to establish a network of Fos-activated cells. It is also not known whether FOS is required in this process beyond serving as a marker of recent neural activity and, if so, which of its many gene targets underlie circuit reorganization. Here we demonstrate that when mice engage in spatial exploration of novel environments, perisomatic inhibition of Fos-activated hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons by parvalbumin-expressing interneurons is enhanced, whereas perisomatic inhibition by cholecystokinin-expressing interneurons is weakened. This bidirectional modulation of inhibition is abolished when the function of the FOS transcription factor complex is disrupted. Single-cell RNA-sequencing, ribosome-associated mRNA profiling and chromatin analyses, combined with electrophysiology, reveal that FOS activates the transcription of Scg2, a gene that encodes multiple distinct neuropeptides, to coordinate these changes in inhibition. As parvalbumin- and cholecystokinin-expressing interneurons mediate distinct features of pyramidal cell activity4-6, the SCG2-dependent reorganization of inhibitory synaptic input might be predicted to affect network function in vivo. Consistent with this prediction, hippocampal gamma rhythms and pyramidal cell coupling to theta phase are significantly altered in the absence of Scg2. These findings reveal an instructive role for FOS and SCG2 in establishing a network of Fos-activated neurons via the rewiring of local inhibition to form a selectively modulated state. The opposing plasticity mechanisms acting on distinct inhibitory pathways may support the consolidation of memories over time."
https://openalex.org/W3110897904,"It is well established that a subset of cells within primary breast cancers can undergo an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), although the role of EMT in metastasis remains controversial. We previously demonstrated that breast cancer cells that had undergone an oncogenic EMT could increase metastasis of neighboring cancer cells via non-canonical paracrine-mediated activation of GLI activity that is dependent on SIX1 expression in the EMT cancer cells. However, the mechanism by which these SIX1-expressing EMT cells activate GLI signaling remained unclear. In this study, we demonstrate a novel mechanism for activation of GLI-mediated signaling in epithelial breast tumor cells via EMT cell-induced production and secretion of VEGF-C. We show that VEGF-C, secreted by breast cancer cells that have undergone an EMT, promotes paracrine-mediated increases in proliferation, migration, and invasion of epithelial breast cancer cells, via non-canonical activation of GLI-signaling. We further show that the aggressive phenotypes, including metastasis, imparted by EMT cells on adjacent epithelial cancer cells can be disrupted by either inhibiting VEGF-C in EMT cells or by knocking down NRP2, a receptor which interacts with VEGF-C, in neighboring epithelial cancer cells. Interrogation of TCGA and GEO public datasets supports the relevance of this pathway in human breast cancer, demonstrating that VEGF-C strongly correlates with activation of Hedgehog signaling and EMT in the human disease. Our study suggests that the VEGF-C/NRP2/GLI axis is a novel and conserved paracrine means by which EMT cells enhance metastasis, and provides potential targets for therapeutic intervention in this heterogeneous disease."

A newer strain is made to emerge in the population when a preexisting strain has reached equilbrium. We assume that this newer strain does not exhibit cross-immunity with the original strain, hence those who are vaccinated and recovered from the original strain become susceptible to the newer strain. Recent events involving the COVID-19 virus shows that it is possible for a viral strain to emerge from a population at a time when the influenza virus, a well-known virus with a vaccine readily available, is active in a population. We solved for four different equilibrium points and investigated the conditions for existence and local stability.

However, the renal complications of COVID-19 are not yet well explored. This study aimed to identify the incidence of acute kidney injury (AKI) in patients with COVID-19 and to evaluate its impact on patient outcomes. This retrospective study included 704 patients with COVID-19 who were hospitalized at two hospitals in Daegu, Korea from February 19 to March 31, 2020. AKI was defined according to the serum creatinine criteria in the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) guidelines. The final date of follow-up was May 1, 2020. Of the 704 patients, 28 (4.0%) developed AKI. Of the 28 patients with AKI, 15 (53.6%) were found to have AKI stage 1, 3 (10.7%) had AKI stage 2, and 10 (35.7%) had AKI stage 3. Among these patients, 12 (42.9%) recovered from AKI. In the patients with AKI, the rates of admission to intensive care unit (ICU), administration of mechanical ventilator (MV), and in-hospital mortality were significantly higher than in patients without AKI. Multivariable analysis revealed that old age (Hazard ratio [HR] = 4.668, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.250–17.430, p = 0.022), high neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (HR = 1.167, 95% CI = 1.078–1.264, p &lt; 0.001), elevated creatinine kinase (HR = 1.002, 95% CI = 1.001–1.004, p = 0.007), and severe AKI (HR = 12.199, 95% CI = 4.235–35.141, p &lt; 0.001) were independent risk factors for in-hospital mortality. The Kaplan-Meier curves showed that the cumulative survival rate was lowest in the AKI stage 3 group ( p &lt; 0.001). In conclusion, the incidence of AKI in patients with COVID-19 was 4.0%. Severe AKI was associated with in-hospital death."

Nervous system injury or neurodegenerative disease can lead to profound alterations in neural circuit function. The precise cellular basis is poorly defined in any context, but disruption of circuit signaling is generally thought to occur as a result of a loss of physical connectivity between damaged neurons. Indeed, axon and synapse degeneration are among the best correlates of functional loss in patients with a variety of brain injuries or neurological diseases (Burke and O’Malley, 2013Burke R.E. O’Malley K. Axon degeneration in Parkinson’s disease.Exp. Neurol. 2013; 246: 72-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar; Hill et al., 2016Hill C.S. Coleman M.P. Menon D.K.

If the physiology of bystander neurons is radically altered by their damaged neighbors, this would force us to reconsider the simple loss-of-physical-connectivity model as the appropriate explanation for functional loss in neural circuits after trauma. It is well documented that bystander neurons can change their physiology in response to their neighbors being injured (Meyer and Ringkamp, 2008Meyer R.A. Ringkamp M. A role for uninjured afferents in neuropathic pain.Sheng Li Xue Bao. 2008; 60: 605-609PubMed Google Scholar). For instance, mouse L5 spinal nerve transection results in the degeneration of distal L5 afferents in sciatic nerve alongside intact L4 C fiber afferents. Within 1 day after L5 lesion, L4 C fibers develop spontaneous activity that lasts for at least 1 week and appears to mediate injury-induced pain and hyperalgesia behaviors (Wu et al., 2001Wu G. Ringkamp M. Hartke T.V. Murinson B.B. Campbell J.N. Griffin J.W. Meyer R.A. Early onset of spontaneous activity in uninjured C-fiber nociceptors after injury to neighboring nerve fibers.J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: RC140Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Bystander effects have also been observed in the central nervous system (CNS). In a mouse model of mild traumatic brain injury (TBI), 1 day after injury, pyramidal neurons with severed axons and intact bystander neurons both exhibited injury-induced changes in action potential firing and afterhyperpolarization. Injured neurons failed to recover, while bystander neurons ultimately exhibited a return to normal firing properties (Greer et al., 2012Greer J.E. Povlishock J.T. Jacobs K.M. Electrophysiological abnormalities in both axotomized and nonaxotomized pyramidal neurons following mild traumatic brain injury.J. Neurosci. 2012; 32: 6682-6687Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). How injured neurons or surrounding glia signal to bystander neurons, or how bystander neurons receive this signal, is not known, but the similar electrophysiological changes observed in axotomized and intact dorsal root ganglion neurons have been proposed to be associated with Wallerian degeneration (Ma et al., 2003Ma C. Shu Y. Zheng Z. Chen Y. Yao H. Greenquist K.W. White F.A. LaMotte R.H. Similar electrophysiological changes in axotomized and neighboring intact dorsal root ganglion neurons..J. Neurophysiol. 2003; 89: 1588-1602Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Recent work has begun to illuminate the mechanisms by which damaged axons autonomously drive their own degeneration during Wallerian degeneration. A forward genetic screen in Drosophila identified the sterile α/Armadillo/Toll-interleukin receptor homology domain (dSarm) molecule as essential for axon auto-destruction, as loss of dSarm completely blocked Wallerian degeneration (Osterloh et al., 2012Osterloh J.M.

Logan M.A. et al.dSarm/Sarm1 is required for activation of an injury-induced axon death pathway.Science. 2012; 337: 481-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). All known dSarm pro-degenerative function requires the BTB and BACK domain molecule Axundead (Axed), another powerful regulator of axon degeneration (Neukomm et al., 2017Neukomm L.J. Burdett T.C.

Sarm1 inhibition is thus an exciting potential approach for blocking axon loss and neuroinflammation in human disease (Wang et al., 2018Wang Q. Zhang S. Liu T. Wang H. Liu K. Wang Q. Zeng W.

In mammals, axotomy leads to the depletion of the labile NAD+ biosynthetic enzyme Nmnat2 (Gilley and Coleman, 2010Gilley J. Coleman M.P. Endogenous Nmnat2 is an essential survival factor for maintenance of healthy axons.PLoS Biol. 2010; 8: e1000300Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar) and a decrease in NAD+ in severed axons (Wang et al., 2005Wang J.

Nmnat2 loss somehow activates Sarm1 (Gilley et al., 2015Gilley J. Orsomando G. Nascimento-Ferreira I. Coleman M.P. Absence of SARM1 rescues development and survival of NMNAT2-deficient axons.Cell Rep. 2015; 10: 1974-1981Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), which is proposed to lead to further NAD+ depletion and metabolic catastrophe in the severed axon (Gerdts et al., 2015Gerdts J. Brace E.J. Sasaki Y. DiAntonio A. Milbrandt J. SARM1 activation triggers axon degeneration locally via NAD+ destruction.Science. 2015; 348: 453-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar) through a Sarm1-intrinsic NAD+ hydrolase activity (Essuman et al., 2017Essuman K. Summers D.W. Sasaki Y. Mao X. DiAntonio A. Milbrandt J.

The Sarm1 NAD+ hydrolase activity appears to be activated directly by the NAD+ precursor, NMN, presumably through allosteric conformational changes in Sarm1 upon NMN binding (Bratkowski et al., 2020Bratkowski M.

This NAD+ depletion model has been proposed as the primary mechanism by which Sarm1 drives axon loss, and to explain the mechanistic basis of protection by several other neuroprotective molecules (Gerdts et al., 2016Gerdts J.

For instance, the slow Wallerian degeneration molecule (WldS), which includes the highly stable NAD+ biosynthetic enzyme Nmnat1, is thought to protect axons by substituting for the labile Nmnat2 molecule, thereby reducing NMN levels and avoiding NAD+ depletion (Gilley and Coleman, 2010Gilley J. Coleman M.P. Endogenous Nmnat2 is an essential survival factor for maintenance of healthy axons.PLoS Biol. 2010; 8: e1000300Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar; Lunn et al., 1989Lunn E.R.

A local mechanism mediates NAD-dependent protection of axon degeneration.J. Cell Biol. 2005; 170: 349-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). Similarly, the protective effects of loss of the E3 ubiquitin ligase Highwire/Phr1 is thought to result from blockade of its direct role in degrading Nmnat2, such that in hiw/phr1 mutants Nmnat2 is stabilized and continues to maintain NAD+ levels (Babetto et al., 2013Babetto E.

The Highwire ubiquitin ligase promotes axonal degeneration by tuning levels of Nmnat protein.PLoS Biol. 2012; 10: e1001440Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Elegant genetic studies in C. elegans demonstrated that TIR-1 (the worm homolog of dSarm/Sarm1) is part of a signaling cascade downstream of the voltage-gated calcium channel UNC-36 and CamK-II and signals via the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling cascade (Chuang and Bargmann, 2005Chuang C.F.

A Toll-interleukin 1 repeat protein at the synapse specifies asymmetric odorant receptor expression via ASK1 MAPKKK signaling.Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 270-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Based on this work, MAPK signaling was examined for roles in Wallerian degeneration but met with mixed results. Changes in MAPK signaling (i.e., phosphorylation of MAPK pathway members) were found in axons within 15–30 min after axotomy, were Sarm1 dependent and suppressed by Nmnat overexpression (Yang et al., 2015Yang J. Wu Z. Renier N. Simon D.J. Uryu K. Park D.S. Greer P.A. Tournier C. Davis R.J. Tessier-Lavigne M. Pathological axonal death through a MAPK cascade that triggers a local energy deficit.Cell. 2015; 160: 161-176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), and partial suppression of axon degeneration was observed after simultaneous blockade of multiple MAPK components (Walker et al., 2017Walker L.J. Summers D.W. Sasaki Y. Brace E.J. Milbrandt J. DiAntonio A. MAPK signaling promotes axonal degeneration by speeding the turnover of the axonal maintenance factor NMNAT2.eLife. 2017; 6: 6Crossref Scopus (82) Google Scholar; Yang et al., 2015Yang J. Wu Z.

Pathological axonal death through a MAPK cascade that triggers a local energy deficit.Cell. 2015; 160: 161-176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). But how MAPK signaling modulates axon degeneration, particularly in the context of Sarm1 signaling, remains controversial, as one study proposed MAPK signals downstream of Sarm1 (Yang et al., 2015Yang J. Wu Z. Renier N. Simon D.J. Uryu K. Park D.S. Greer P.A. Tournier C. Davis R.J. Tessier-Lavigne M. Pathological axonal death through a MAPK cascade that triggers a local energy deficit.Cell. 2015; 160: 161-176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), while another argued Sarm1 was upstream of MAPK signaling (Walker et al., 2017Walker L.J. Summers D.W. Sasaki Y. Brace E.J. Milbrandt J. DiAntonio A. MAPK signaling promotes axonal degeneration by speeding the turnover of the axonal maintenance factor NMNAT2.eLife. 2017; 6: 6Crossref Scopus (82) Google Scholar), and the neuroprotective phenotypes resulting from MAPK blockade do not approach levels afforded by loss of Sarm1 in vivo. In this study, we used a partial nerve injury model to examine early changes in the physiology of severed axons and neighboring uninjured bystander neurons. We show that axotomy of even a small subset of neurons leads to inhibition of cargo transport in all axons within the nerve and suppression of sensory signal transduction in bystander neurons. Surprisingly, this early blockade of axon transport and sensory signal transduction required dSarm in both severed and uninjured bystander neurons, where it signaled via the conserved UNC-36/MAPK signaling pathway. Early suppression of axon transport and bystander neuron function did not require dSarm NAD+ hydrolase function or Axed, was not modulated by NMN, and was not induced by depletion of dNmnat. This suggests it is mechanistically different from later events in axon death, where dSarm drives axon degeneration with Axed. Intriguingly, we found that this early spreading of injury signals to bystander neurons required the Draper receptor in surrounding glia, indicating that glial cells actively signal to inhibit the function of bystander neurons in vivo. Our work identifies new roles for dSarm and glia in modifying neurophysiology early after injury, assigns the NAD+ hydrolase function exclusively to later axon degenerative events, and reveals a new role for UNC-36/MAPK signaling in promoting these dSarm-dependent changes early after an injury has occurred in the nervous system. We propose that two temporally and genetically separable phases of dSarm signaling exist that mediate these distinct injury-induced changes in neurophysiology and axon degeneration. We wished to examine immediate injury-induced changes in neurophysiology in severed axons along with neighboring intact neurons. To accomplish this, we used a partial axotomy model in the adult Drosophila wing. The L1 wing vein nerve houses ~290 sensory neurons whose cell bodies are aligned along the anterior wing margin, with all axons projecting medially and synapsing in the thoracic ganglion (Fang et al., 2012Fang Y. Soares L. Teng X. Geary M. Bonini N.M. A novel Drosophila model of nerve injury reveals an essential role of Nmnat in maintaining axonal integrity.Curr.

Rapid in vivo forward genetic approach for identifying axon death genes in Drosophila.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2014; 111: 9965-9970Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Sensory axons are ensheathed by glial cells along their length (Neukomm et al., 2014Neukomm L.J. Burdett T.C. Gonzalez M.A. Züchner S. Freeman M.R. Rapid in vivo forward genetic approach for identifying axon death genes in Drosophila.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2014; 111: 9965-9970Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Transecting the wing nerve at its midpoint severs the axons of approximately half of the sensory neurons (Figure 1A); those with cell bodies distal to the injury site are axotomized, while those with cell bodies proximal to the injury site remain intact and survive for weeks after injury. Severed axons undergo Wallerian degeneration ~8–10 h after axotomy and neuronal debris is cleared by surrounding glial cells within 5–7 days (Neukomm et al., 2014Neukomm L.J. Burdett T.C. Gonzalez M.A. Züchner S. Freeman M.R. Rapid in vivo forward genetic approach for identifying axon death genes in Drosophila.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2014; 111: 9965-9970Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). We live imaged axon transport in the L1 wing vein as a first step toward determining how axon biology changes in response to nerve injury. Sensory neurons were sparsely labeled using the mosaic analysis with a repressible cell marker (MARCM) approach (Lee and Luo, 1999Lee T. Luo L.

USA. 2014; 111: 9965-9970Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), which allowed for the GAL4/UAS-dependent labeling of single cell clones with membrane tethered GFP or RFP. After surgical removal of the distal half of the wing, we directly compared the phenotypes of severed axons alongside remaining intact neighboring neurons (Figure 1A). For examination of changes in axon transport, we labeled four different types of axon cargoes: autophagosomes (UAS-mCherry-Atg8a), lysosomes (UAS-GFP-lamp), synaptic vesicles (UAS-syt-GFP), and mitochondria (UAS-mito-GFP). In uninjured wings, autophagosomes were transported in anterograde and retrograde directions along axons, with almost ~80% of the total population exhibiting movement (both anterograde and retrograde) during the 3-min observation window (Figures 1B and 1C; Video S1). https://www.cell.com/cms/asset/5cdacf52-495c-4b71-82ee-9ec3c21d10d7/mmc2.mp4Loading ...

Autophagosomes Are Highly Motile in the Axons of Uninjured Wings, Related to Figure 1Fluorescent labeled autophagosomes (ok371-Gal4, UAS-mcherry-atg8a) were monitored in the axon clones of uninjured wings, video is recorded for 3 min. In severed axons, the number of motile autophagosomes decreased to ~25% within 1 h and continued to decrease at each hour time point until it was <4% at 4 h after injury (Figures 1B and 1C; Video S2). To our surprise, we found that the percentage of moving autophagosomes also dropped significantly in the axons of neighboring intact bystander neurons (~40% by 1 h after injury; Figures 1B and 1D; Video S3) and partially recovered by 6 h after axotomy. We observed a similar time course for suppression of axon transport of lysosomes (Figures S1A and S1B) and synaptic vesicles (Figures S1C and S1D), with a near full blockade of transport in severed axons and partial suppression in bystander neurons. We found mitochondria were largely stationary in adult post-mitotic neurons, which is consistent with work showing that as axons mature mitochondria become more stable (Lewis et al., 2016Lewis Jr., T.L.

Does wing injury or nerve injury drive changes in bystander axon physiology? To answer this question, we lesioned the wing from the posterior margin anteriorly through the wing, but left the L1 nerve intact. We found no change in axon transport in response to this surgery, suggesting that lesion of L1 nerve itself was required to induce bystander effects (Figure S2). Finally, we sought to determine whether the proximity of neuronal cell bodies of bystander neurons to the injury site affected the severity of axon transport blockade or whether blockade of axon transport was uniform throughout the wing nerve. We lesioned the L1 wing nerve distally, removing only ~20 neuronal cell bodies from the tip of the wing, and then imaged the transport of autophagosomes in intact bystander neurons at 3 h after injury at two sites along the wing nerve, one distant from (site A) and one closer to (site B) the injury site (Figure 1E). We found that regardless of the distance of the cell body from the lesion site or even the reduced number of severed axons in the more distally injured nerve preparation (~20 in the distal lesion versus ~110 with midpoint lesions), the suppression of autophagosome transport was similar in bystander neurons and approximated that observed when we lesioned the midpoint of the wing. These data indicate that nerve injury efficiently suppresses axon transport throughout the L1 wing nerve within 3 h after injury, even with relatively small injuries (~20 neurons out of 290 total). Because the axons of uninjured cells also exhibited this phenotype, we conclude that bystander neurons can detect nerve injuries even at a distance and respond by suppression of axon transport. Approximately 8–10 h after axotomy of the L1 wing vein, axon death is driven cell autonomously by dSarm in severed axons (Neukomm et al., 2014Neukomm L.J. Burdett T.C. Gonzalez M.A. Züchner S. Freeman M.R. Rapid in vivo forward genetic approach for identifying axon death genes in Drosophila.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2014; 111: 9965-9970Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). While dSarm is primarily thought to drive axon death at these later stages, we used MARCM technology to assay dsarm mutant clones to determine whether dSarm was also required for this early suppression of axon transport. We generated sparse MARCM clones of dsarm null alleles (dsarm896), which lead to the production of ~8–10 homozygous mutant, GFP+ clones being present in a field of (~280) otherwise wild-type neurons in the L1 nerve. Under MARCM conditions, we can therefore assay directly for cell-autonomous requirements for dsarm in GFP+ clones. We found normal rates of axon transport of autophagosomes (Figures 2A, 2B, and 2F ; Video S4) and lysosomes (Figure S3) in axons in dsarm896 null mutant clones before injury. However, in contrast to wild-type clones, dsarm896 null clones exhibited normal rates of axon transport of autophagosomes in severed axons for at least 6 h after axotomy (Figures 2A and 2F; Video S5). This was confirmed using markers for lysosomes (Figure S3), and this could be rescued by a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) that covers dsarm locus to restore endogenous expression of dsarm (Figure 2F). We conclude that dSarm is required within the first few hours after axotomy for blockade of axon transport in the distal stumps of severed axons. https://www.cell.com/cms/asset/e3b61e2a-c7e7-442b-932a-822c1f0ab5b4/mmc5.mp4Loading ...

https://openalex.org/W3112045924,"Estimation of the postmortem interval in advanced postmortem stages is a challenging task. Although there are several approaches available for addressing postmortem changes of a (human) body or its environment (ecologically and/or biochemically), most are restricted to specific timeframes and/or individual and environmental conditions. It is well known, for instance, that buried bodies decompose in a remarkably different manner than on the ground surface. However, data on how established methods for PMI estimation perform under these conditions are scarce. It is important to understand whether and how postmortem changes are affected under burial conditions, if corrective factors could be conceived, or if methods have to be excluded for respective cases. We present the first multi-methodological assessment of human postmortem decomposition carried out on buried body donors in Europe, at the Amsterdam Research Initiative for Sub-surface Taphonomy and Anthropology (ARISTA) in the Netherlands. We used a multidisciplinary approach to investigate postmortem changes of morphology, skeletal muscle protein decomposition, presence of insects and other necrophilous animals as well as microbial communities (i.e., microbiomes) from August to November 2018 associated with two complete body exhumations and eight partial exhumations. Our results clearly display the current possibilities and limitations of methods for PMI estimation in buried remains and provide a baseline for future research and application."
https://openalex.org/W3111795298,"Objective The present study aims to examine the association between women’s decision-making autonomy and utilization of maternal healthcare services among the currently married women in India. Methods A total of 32,698 currently married women aged 15–49 years who had at least one live birth in the past five years preceding the survey and had information regarding autonomy collected by the National Family Health Survey 2015–16 were used for analysis. Bivariate and multivariate logistic regression models were employed for the analyses of this study. Results Utilization of maternal healthcare services was higher among the women having a high level of decision-making autonomy compared to those who had a low autonomy in the household. The regression results indicate that women’s autonomy was significantly associated with increased odds of maternal healthcare services in India. Women with high autonomy had 37% and 33% greater likelihood of receiving ANC (AOR: 1.37, 95% CI: 1.25–1.50) and PNC care (AOR: 1.33, 95% CI: 1.24–1.42) respectively compared to women having low autonomy. However, no significant association was observed between women’s autonomy and institutional delivery in the adjusted analysis. Conclusion This study recommends the need for comprehensive strategies involving improvement of women’s autonomy along with expansion of education, awareness generation regarding the importance of maternity care, and enhancing public health infrastructure to ensure higher utilization of maternal healthcare services that would eventually reduce maternal mortality."

This paper constructs an evaluation index system containing social undesirable outputs, and uses the Super-SBM model and the Malmquist-Luenberger index to evaluate green innovation efficiency in 42 cities along the Yangtze River Economic Belt from 2013 to 2017. Additionally, spatial autocorrelation analysis is used to study the spatial correlation of green innovation efficiency. Finally, the coupling coordination degree model is used to study the coupling coordination degree between green innovation efficiency and high-tech industries. The following results were obtained. (1) The average value of green innovation efficiency increased from 1.0446 to 1.0987, and the annual average growth rate of total factor productivity of green innovation was 1.1%. (2) Green innovation efficiency of the Yangtze River Economic Belt had a significant spatial positive correlation, but the types of agglomeration among cities in different sections of the Yangtze River were quite different. (3) The coupling coordination degree between green innovation efficiency and the development level of high-tech industries in the cities of the Yangtze River Economic Belt was in the basic coordination stage.

https://openalex.org/W3112213222,"The complexity of Neolithic population movements and their interpretation through material culture have been the subject of archaeological research for decades. One of the dominant narratives proposes that groups from the Starčevo-Körös-Criş complex spread from the central towards the northern Balkans in the Early Neolithic and eventually brought the Neolithic lifestyle into present-day Hungary. Broad geographical migrations were considered to shape the continuous expansion of Neolithic groups and individuals. However, recent archaeological research, aDNA, and isotope analyses challenged the synchronous appearance of specific material culture distributions and human movement dynamics through emphasizing communication networks and socio-cultural transformation processes. This paper seeks to retrace the complexity of Neolithic mobility patterns across Hungary by means of strontium and oxygen stable isotope analyses, which were performed on a total of 718 human dental enamel samples from 55 Neolithic sites spanning the period from the Starčevo to the Balaton-Lasinja culture in Transdanubia and from the Körös to the Tiszapolgár cultural groups on the Great Hungarian Plain (Alföld). This study presents the largest strontium and oxygen isotope sample size for the Neolithic Carpathian Basin and discusses human mobility patterns on various geographical scales and throughout archaeological cultures, chronological periods, and sex and gender categories in a multiproxy analysis. Based on our results, we discuss the main stages of the Neolithisation processes and particularly trace individual movement behaviour such as exogamy patterns within extensive social networks. Furthermore, this paper presents an innovative differentiation between mobility patterns on small, micro-regional, and supra-regional scales, which provides new insights into the complex organisation of Neolithic communities."
https://openalex.org/W3112298362,"Background For Malaysia, a nation highly dependent on migrant labour, the large non-citizen workforce presents a unique health system challenge. Although documented migrant workers are covered by mandatory healthcare insurance (SPIKPA), financial constraints remain a major barrier for non-citizen healthcare access. Malaysia recently extended protection for migrant workers under the national social security scheme (SOCSO), previously exclusive to citizens. This study aims to evaluate healthcare financing and social security policies for migrant workers to identify policy gaps and opportunities for intervention. Methods A total of 37 in-depth interviews were conducted of 44 stakeholders from July 2018 to July 2019. A mixed-methods analysis combining major themes from qualitative interviews with policy document reviews was conducted. Descriptive analysis of publicly available secondary data, namely revenues collected at government healthcare facilities, was conducted to contextualise the policy review and qualitative findings. Results We found that migrant workers and employers were unaware of SPIKPA enrolment and entitlements. Higher fees for non-citizens result in delayed care-seeking. While the Malaysian government nearly doubled non-citizen healthcare fees revenues from RM 104 to 182 million (USD 26 to 45 million) between 2014 to 2018, outstanding revenues tripled from RM 16 to 50 million (USD 4 to 12 million) in the same period. SPIKPA coverage is likely inadequate in providing financial risk protection to migrant workers, especially with increased non-citizens fees at public hospitals. Undocumented workers and other migrant populations excluded from SPIKPA contribution to unpaid fees revenues are unknown. Problems described with the previous Foreign Workers Compensation Scheme (FWCS), could be partially addressed by SOCSO, in theory. Nevertheless, questions remain on the feasibility of implementing elements of SOCSO, such as recurring payments to workers and next-of-kin overseas. Conclusion Malaysia is moving towards migrant inclusion with the provision of SOCSO for documented migrant workers, but more needs to be done. Here we suggest the expansion of the SPIKPA insurance scheme to include all migrant populations, while broadening its scope towards more comprehensive coverage, including essential primary care."

Recent studies indicate that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are crucial for regulating the functional brain development during neurogenesis. This study aimed to determine the regulatory effects and potential mechanisms of lncRNA Peg13 (Peg13) on sevoflurane exposure-related neurotoxicity against neural stem cells (NSCs). Methods Mouse embryotic NSCs were isolated and their self-renewal and differentiation were characterized by immunofluorescence. NSCs were exposed to 4.1% sevoflurane 2 h daily for three consecutive days. The potential toxicities of sevoflurane against NSCs were evaluated by neurosphere formation, 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine (EdU) incorporation and flow cytometry assays. The Peg13, miR-128-3p and Sox13 expression in NSCs were quantified. The potential interactions among Peg13, miR-128-3p and Sox13 were analyzed by luciferase reporter assay. The effects of Peg13 and/or miR-128-3p over-expression on the sevoflurane-related neurotoxicity and Sox13 expression were determined in NSCs. Results The isolated mouse embryotic NSCs displayed potent self-renewal ability and differentiated into neurons, astrocytes and oligodendrocytes in vitro, which were significantly inhibited by sevoflurane exposure. Sevoflurane exposure significantly down-regulated Peg13 and Sox13, but enhanced miR-128-3p expression in NSCs. Transfection with miR-128-3p mimics, but not the control, significantly mitigated the Peg13 or Sox13-regulated luciferase expression in 293T cells. Peg13 over-expression significantly reduced the sevoflurane-related neurotoxicity and increased Sox13 expression in NSCs, which were mitigated by miR-128-3p transfection. Conclusion Such data indicated that Peg13 mitigated the sevoflurane-related neurotoxicity by sponging miR-128-3p to preserve Sox13 expression in NSCs."
https://openalex.org/W3111080516,"Males in a wide variety of taxa, including insects, birds and mammals, produce vocalizations to attract females. Male house mice emit ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs), especially during courtship and mating, which are surprising complex. It is often suggested that male mice vocalize at higher rates after interacting with a female, but the evidence is mixed depending upon the strain of mice. We conducted a study with wild-derived house mice ( Mus musculus musculus ) to test whether male courtship vocalizations (i.e., vocalizations emitted in a sexual context) are influenced by a prior direct interaction with a female, and if so, determine how long the effect lasts. We allowed sexually naïve males to directly interact with a female for five minutes (sexual priming), and then we recorded males’vocalizations either 1, 10, 20, or 30 days later when presented with an unfamiliar female (separated by a perforated partition) and female scent. We automatically detected USVs and processed recordings using the Automatic Mouse Ultrasound Detector (A-MUD version 3.2), and we describe our improved version of this tool and tests of its performance. We measured vocalization rate and spectro-temporal features and we manually classified USVs into 15 types to investigate priming effects on vocal repertoire diversity and composition. After sexual priming, males emitted nearly three times as many USVs, they had a larger repertoire diversity, and their vocalizations had different spectro-temporal features (USV length, slope and variability in USV frequency) compared to unprimed controls. Unprimed control males had the most distinctive repertoire composition compared to the primed groups. Most of the effects were found when comparing unprimed to all primed males (treatment models), irrespective of the time since priming. Timepoint models showed that USV length increased 1 day after priming, that repertoire diversity increased 1 and 20 days after priming, and that the variability of USV frequencies was lower 20 and 30 days after priming. Our results show that wild-derived male mice increased the number and diversity of courtship vocalizations if they previously interacted with a female. Thus, the USVs of house mice are not only context-dependent, they depend upon previous social experience and perhaps the contexts of these experiences. The effect of sexual priming on male courtship vocalizations is likely mediated by neuro-endocrine-mechanisms, which may function to advertise males’ sexual arousal and facilitate social recognition."
https://openalex.org/W3111688009,"Evaluative research of technological officiating aids in sports predominantly focuses on the respective technology and the impact on decision accuracy, whereas the impact on stakeholders is neglected. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the immediate impact of the recently introduced Video Assistant Referee, often referred to as VAR, on the sentiment of fans of the English Premier League. We analyzed the content of 643,251 tweets from 129 games, including 94 VAR incidents, using a new variation of a gradient boosting approach to train two tree-based classifiers for text corpora: one classifier to identify tweets related to the VAR and another one to rate a tweet’s sentiment. The results of 10-fold cross-validations showed that our approach, for which we only took a small share of all features to grow each tree, performed better than common approaches (naïve Bayes, support vector machines, random forest and traditional gradient tree boosting) used by other studies for both classification problems. Regarding the impact of the VAR on fans, we found that the average sentiment of tweets related to this technological officiating aid was significantly lower compared to other tweets (-0.64 vs. 0.08; t = 45.5, p &lt; .001). Further, by tracking the mean sentiment of all tweets chronologically for each game, we could display that there is a significant drop of sentiment for tweets posted in the periods after an incident compared to the periods before. A plunge that persisted for 20 minutes on average. Summed up, our results provide evidence that the VAR effects predominantly expressions of negative sentiment on Twitter. This is in line with the results found in previous, questionnaire-based, studies for other technological officiating aids and also consistent with the psychological principle of loss aversion."
https://openalex.org/W3112058390,"Background In many countries, there is evidence that intimate partner violence is prevalent among young women. This study aimed to determine the prevalence and the factors associated with intimate partner violence in young women (aged 15–24 years) attending secondary schools in Maputo, Mozambique. Method Using a probability proportional sampling strategy, 431 participants were recruited, and the data were collected using a self-administered questionnaire. Binary and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to assess the association between IPV and sociodemographic and sociocultural factors. Odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) are reported. Results Of the 413 participants, 248 (60%) (95% CI: 55.15–64.61) had experienced at least one form of IPV in their lifetime. Then, of the 293 participants who had a partner in the previous 12 months prior to the data collection, 186 (63.4%) (95% CI: 57.68–69.00) reported IPV in the 12 months prior to data collection. The psychological violence was the predominant type of violence, lifetime prevalence 230 (55.7%), and over the previous 12 months 164 (55.9%). The risk of IPV was associated with young women lacking religious commitment (AOR, 1.596, 95% CI: 1.009–2.525, p = 0.046) and if the head of the young women’s household was unemployed (AOR, 1.642 95% CI: 1.044–2.584, p = 0.032). In the bivariate analysis the odds of being abused remained lower among the younger teenage women (OR, 0.458 95% CI: 0.237–0.888, p = 0.021), and higher, among young women if the partner was employed (OR, 2.247 95% CI: 1.187–4.256, p = 0.013) and among the young women believing that males are superior to females (OR, 2.298 95% CI:1.014–5.210. p = 0.046). Conclusion These findings reveal a high prevalence of IPV among young women. Comprehensive programs should incorporate socioeconomic empowerment strategies to increase women’s autonomy. There is a need to address religious beliefs through cultural perspectives, to improve social interactions that promote violence free relationships, gender egalitarian norms, and physical and emotional wellbeing for young women."
https://openalex.org/W3110741079,"Rainbow trout ( Oncorhynchus mykiss ) are frequently used as experimental animals in ecotoxicological studies, in which they are experimentally exposed to defined concentrations of test substances, such as heavy metals, pesticides, or pharmaceuticals. Following exposure to a broad variety of aquatic pollutants, early morphologically detectable toxic effects often manifest in alterations of the gills. Suitable methods for an accurate and unbiased quantitative characterization of the type and the extent of morphological gill alterations are therefore essential prerequisites for recognition, objective evaluation and comparison of the severity of gill lesions. The aim of the present guidelines is to provide practicable, standardized and detailed protocols for the application of unbiased quantitative stereological analyses of relevant morphological parameters of the gills of rainbow trout. These gill parameters inter alia include the total volume of the primary and secondary gill lamellae, the surface area of the secondary gill lamellae epithelium ( i . e ., the respiratory surface) and the thickness of the diffusion barrier. The featured protocols are adapted to fish of frequently used body size classes (300–2000 g). They include well-established, conventional sampling methods, probes and test systems for unbiased quantitative stereological analyses of light- and electron microscopic 2-D gill sections, as well as the application of modern 3-D light sheet fluorescence microscopy (LSFM) of optically cleared gill samples as an innovative, fast and efficient quantitative morphological analysis approach. The methods shown here provide a basis for standardized and representative state-of-the-art quantitative morphological analyses of trout gills, ensuring the unbiasedness and reproducibility, as well as the intra- and inter-study comparability of analyses results. Their broad implementation will therefore significantly contribute to the reliable identification of no observed effect concentration (NOEC) limits in ecotoxicological studies and, moreover, to limit the number of experimental animals by reduction of unnecessary repetition of experiments."
https://openalex.org/W3111706305,"For the past decade, migratory beekeepers who provide honey bees for pollination services have experienced substantial colony losses on a recurring basis that have been attributed in part to exposure to insecticides, fungicides, or their combinations applied to crops. The phytochemicals p -coumaric acid and quercetin, which occur naturally in a wide variety of bee foods, including beebread and many types of honey, can enhance adult bee longevity and reduce the toxicity of certain pesticides. How variation in concentrations of natural dietary constituents affects interactions with xenobiotics, including synthetic pesticides, encountered in agroecosystems remains an open question. We tested the effects of these two phytochemicals at a range of natural concentrations on impacts of consuming propiconazole and chlorantraniliprole, a triazole fungicide and an insecticide frequently applied as a tank mix to almond trees during bloom in California’s Central Valley. Propiconazole, even at low field concentrations, significantly reduced survival and longevity when consumed by adult bees in a sugar-based diet. The effects of propiconazole in combination with chlorantraniliprole enhanced mortality risk. The detrimental effects of the two pesticides were for the most part reduced when either or both of the phytochemicals were present in the diet. These findings suggest that honey bees may depend on non-nutritive but physiologically active phytochemical components of their natural foods for ameliorating xenobiotic stress, although only over a certain range of concentrations; particularly at the high end of the natural range, certain combinations can incur additive toxicity. Thus, efforts to develop nectar or pollen substitutes with phytochemicals to boost insecticide tolerance or immunity or to evaluate toxicity of pesticides to pollinators should take concentration-dependent effects of phytochemicals into consideration."
https://openalex.org/W3112288710,"Odorant-dependent behaviors in insects are triggered by the binding of odorant ligands to the variable subunits of heteromeric olfactory receptors. Previous studies have shown, however, that specific odor binding to ORco, the common subunit of odorant receptor heteromers, may allosterically alter olfactory receptor function and profoundly affect subsequent behavioral responses. Using an insect cell–based screening platform, we identified and characterized several antagonists of the odorant receptor coreceptor of the African malaria vector Anopheles gambiae (AgamORco) in a small collection of natural volatile organic compounds. Because some of the identified antagonists were previously shown to strongly repel Anopheles and Culex mosquitoes, we examined the bioactivities of the identified antagonists against Aedes, the third major genus of the Culicidae family. The tested antagonists inhibited the function of Ae. aegypti ORco ex vivo and repelled adult Asian tiger mosquitoes (Ae. albopictus). Binary mixtures of specific antagonists elicited higher repellency than single antagonists, and binding competition assays suggested that this enhanced repellence is due to antagonist interaction with distinct ORco sites. Our results also suggest that the enhanced mosquito repellency by antagonist mixtures is due to additive rather than synergistic effects of the specific antagonist combinations on ORco function. Taken together, these findings provide novel insights concerning the molecular aspects of odorant receptor function. Moreover, our results demonstrate that a simple screening assay may be used for the identification of allosteric modifiers of olfactory-driven behaviors capable of providing enhanced personal protection against multiple mosquito-borne infectious diseases.

This system relies on the stable expression of homomeric AgamORco in cells constitutively expressing a luminescence-emitting calcium biosensor reporter protein. Here, we report on the screening of a small collection of VOCs of plant, arthropod, and bacterial origins for the identification of modulators of AgamORco function. The screening resulted in the identification of several AgamORco-specific antagonists. Considering the high degree of phylogenetic conservation of ORco and its functional relevance, which was demonstrated by our previous findings that natural compounds inhibiting AgamORco activity were capable of repelling at least two mosquito genera, Anopheles and Culex, we examined whether the identified ORco antagonists were also active against the third major genus of Culicidae mosquitoes, Aedes. Two tested antagonists elicited significant inhibition of inward currents mediated by VUAA1 in Xenopus laevis oocytes expressing Aedes aegypti ORco (AaegORco). Examination of the bioactivity of the identified antagonists, as well as binary and ternary mixtures thereof, against available laboratory populations of Aedes albopictus elicited an avoidance behavior. Some of the mixtures caused anosmia-like effects similar to equivalent doses of N,N-diethyl-3-methylbenzamide (DEET). Antagonist binding competition assays against an OA point to the simultaneous binding of one antagonist to the OA-binding site on ORco and to one or more alternative binding sites of the other as a plausible cause for the observed enhanced activities of the binary mixtures. The screening platform employed in this study exploits the property of AgamORco homomers to form functional ligand-gated cation channels in cultured lepidopteran cells (34Tsitoura P. Koussis K.

The screening protocol, performed in a 96-well format, involved the sequential addition of a tested compound and N-(4-ethylphenyl)-2-{[4-ethyl-5-(3-pyridinyl)-4H-1,2,4-triazol-3-yl]thio}acetamide, the Orco Receptor Activator Molecule, ORcoRAM2, as OA, both at 100 μM concentrations, to the transformed cells (Fig. 1). Similarly to the working scheme presented earlier (34Tsitoura P. Koussis K. Iatrou K. Inhibition of Anopheles gambiae odorant receptor function by mosquito repellents.J. Biol. Chem. 2015; 290: 7961-7972Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 35Tsitoura P. Iatrou K. Positive allosteric modulation of insect olfactory receptor function by ORco agonists.Front. Cell Neurosci. 2016; 10: 275Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), the general principle for agonist/antagonist screening has been that the addition of ethanol solvent or a compound devoid of ORco-binding activity would allow Ca2+ influx resulting in cellular luminescence upon sequential addition of the ORco agonist, whereas the addition of a compound acting as an ORco antagonist would prevent, partially or completely, luminescence emission upon secondary addition of the ORco agonist. The same expression platform also allows the identification of compounds acting as ORco agonists. In that case, addition of an active compound would be expected to cause calcium ion influx and hence cell luminescence emission, whereas no response would be expected upon addition of the known agonist after the dissipation of the first luminescence burst, owing to temporary inactivation of the ORco channel (34Tsitoura P.

Chem. 2015; 290: 7961-7972Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). For the identification of ORco antagonist hits, the secondary responses to OA addition were set arbitrarily at a maximum of 60% of the normal channel response to OA addition, i.e., a 40% or higher inhibition of ORco functional response. For the case of ORco agonists, the primary responses to the addition of the screened compounds were also set arbitrarily at 60% or greater relative to the normal channel response obtained upon addition of the known OA, OrcoRAM2 (Fig. 2). The examination of 50 natural VOCs (Table S1) for the presence of AgamORco function modulators employed as control the mosquito repellent isopropyl cinnamate (IPC) (compound II; (44Christophers S.R. Mosquito repellents; being a report of the work of the mosquito repellent inquiry, Cambridge, 1943-5.J. Hyg. (Lond). 1947; 45: 176-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar)) that was previously shown to act as an AgamORco channel antagonist (34Tsitoura P. Koussis K. Iatrou K. Inhibition of Anopheles gambiae odorant receptor function by mosquito repellents.J. Biol. Chem. 2015; 290: 7961-7972Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The initial screen resulted in the identification of five hits with AgamORco antagonistic activity (Fig. 2). Two of the identified hits, carvacrol (CRV) and cumin alcohol (CA) (compounds I and III, respectively), were previously shown to be effective repellents for An. gambiae and Culex spp mosquitoes (33Kröber T. Koussis K. Bourquin M. Tsitoura P. Konstantopoulou M. Awolola T.S. Dani F.R. Qiao H. Pelosi P. Iatrou K. Guerin P.M. Odorant-binding protein-based identification of natural spatial repellents for the African malaria mosquito Anopheles gambiae.Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2018; 96: 36-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) and also to inhibit AgamORco activity to an extent that was not determined at the time (34Tsitoura P. Koussis K. Iatrou K. Inhibition of Anopheles gambiae odorant receptor function by mosquito repellents.J. Biol. Chem. 2015; 290: 7961-7972Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In contrast, no relevant information existed concerning the bioactivity of the other three antagonist hits, compounds #4 (linalyl acetate [LA]), #39 ((2E,4E)-2,4-octadienal [OCT]), and #45 ((1S)-3-carene [CAR]) (Fig. 2 and Table S1). No agonists inducing significant AgamORco activity were found in this VOC collection. Although several compounds such as #5, 8, 10, 13, 14, 17, and 18 (Fig. 2 and Table S1) produced, upon primary addition, notable responses suggestive of an agonist-like behavior, the observed responses ranged between 20% and 30% of that obtained upon addition of the known OA, i.e., considerably lower than the 60% minimum response limit that was set for potential agonists. Although noted, these compounds have yet to be characterized further. A quantitative assessment of the effects of the antagonist hits on AgamORco channel function was undertaken by determining the inhibition in the OA-dependent channel activity by increasing antagonist concentrations. As is depicted by the dose–response curves presented in Figure 3, all five hits were found to antagonize AgamORco channel function in a dose-dependent manner with IC50 values ranging from 23 to 83 μM. To confirm the cross-species bioactivity of these compounds in mosquitoes, we tested the activity of the two most potent antagonists, CRV and OCT (Fig. 3), on Xenopus oocytes expressing Ae. aegypti ORco (AaegORco). Across all treatments, we observed a consistent increase in the third VUAA1-induced response relative to the first and second VUAA1 administrations (Fig. 4A). For this reason, the inhibition level (Fig. 4B) was calculated by normalizing the response amplitude elicited by the second stimulation, to the average current responses elicited by the first and last VUAA1 stimulations. Although neither of the two compounds elicited currents in water-injected oocyte controls (Fig. S1), OCT and CRV reduced VUAA1-activated currents (Fig. 4A) by approximately 60% and 85%, respectively (Fig. 4B), in accordance with the cell-based results, where CRV was found to be a more potent inhibitor compared with OCT (Fig. 3). The five AgamORco antagonists identified in the cell-based screening assay were subsequently tested for repellence activity against laboratory populations of an aggressive mosquito species, the Asian tiger mosquito, Ae. albopictus. Repellency was evaluated by the reduction in the number of mosquito landings on an exposed portion of a human hand. The widely used repellent DEET (45Mccabe E.T. Barthel W.F. Gertler S.I. Hall S.A.

The bioassays (see Table S2 for quantifications of landing numbers) showed that, at the highest tested dose (0.2 μl/cm2, 1–1.4 μmole/cm2), all compounds significantly reduced mosquito landing counts relative to the solvent controls (Fig. 5A and Table 1). At a dose of 0.04 μl/cm2 (210–280 nmole/cm2), the strongest ORco antagonists, CRV and OCT, displayed repellent activities comparable to that of DEET, whereas the activity of CA was noticeably lower (Fig. 5B and Table 1). At the lowest tested dose (0.01 μl/cm2, 52–70 nmole/cm2), all compounds were found to display repellent activities weaker than that of DEET, with OCT eliciting the lowest repellency of all (Fig. 5C and Table 1).Table 1Repellence indices of tested compounds in human hand landing assaysCompound name (abbreviation)StructureMolecular weightμL equivalent per cm2nmole per cm2Mean % repellencyDEET Pr(<[t])N,N-Diethyl-3-methylbenzamide (DEET)191.30.21042100 ± 00.04208100 ± 00.015296.7 ± 2.6Carvacrol (CRV)150.20.2130099.8 ± 0.70.377370.0426099.1 ± 20.239940.016567.8 ± 96.9E-16Cumin alcohol (CA)150.20.2130099.8 ± 0.70.042760.0426078 ± 71.3E-060.016563.2 ± 11.81.3E-14Isopropyl cinnamate (IPC)190.20.2107096 ± 1.60.048350.04214--0.0154--Linalyl acetate (LA)196.30.292072.3 ± 15.60.000910.04184--0.0146--(2E,4E)-2,4-Octadienal (OCT)124.20.21410100 ± 0-0.0428097.9 ± 2.70.063090.017013.8 ± 12.88.6E-25(1S)-3-Carene (CAR)136.20.2127089.8 ± 4.30.001810.04254--0.0164--All tests were carried out over a period of 5 min.

Such movement patterns include the toroidal mills seen in fish shoals, highly aligned parallel motion like that of flocks of migrating birds, and the swarming of insects. Since the 1970’s a wide range of collective motion models have been studied that prescribe rules of interaction between individuals, and that are capable of generating emergent patterns that are visually similar to those seen in real animal group. This does not necessarily mean that real animals apply exactly the same interactions as those prescribed in models. In more recent work, researchers have sought to infer the rules of interaction of real animals directly from tracking data, by using a number of techniques, including averaging methods. In one of the simplest formulations, the averaging methods determine the mean changes in the components of the velocity of an individual over time as a function of the relative coordinates of group mates. The averaging methods can also be used to estimate other closely related quantities including the mean relative direction of motion of group mates as a function of their relative coordinates. Since these methods for extracting interaction rules and related quantities from trajectory data are relatively new, the accuracy of these methods has had limited inspection. In this paper, we examine the ability of an averaging method to reveal prescribed rules of interaction from data generated by two individual based models for collective motion. Our work suggests that an averaging method can capture the qualitative features of underlying interactions from trajectory data alone, including repulsion and attraction effects evident in changes in speed and direction of motion, and the presence of a blind zone. However, our work also illustrates that the output from a simple averaging method can be affected by emergent group level patterns of movement, and the sizes of the regions over which repulsion and attraction effects are apparent can be distorted depending on how individuals combine interactions with multiple group mates."
https://openalex.org/W3111174503,"Elongin is an RNA polymerase II (RNAPII)-associated factor that has been shown to stimulate transcriptional elongation in vitro. The Elongin complex is thought to be required for transcriptional induction in response to cellular stimuli and to ubiquitinate RNAPII in response to DNA damage. Yet, the impact of the Elongin complex on transcription in vivo has not been well studied. Here, we performed comprehensive studies of the role of Elongin A, the largest subunit of the Elongin complex, on RNAPII transcription genome-wide. Our results suggest that Elongin A localizes to actively transcribed regions and potential enhancers, and the level of recruitment correlated with transcription levels. We also identified a large group of factors involved in transcription as Elongin A–associated factors. In addition, we found that loss of Elongin A leads to dramatically reduced levels of serine2-phosphorylated, but not total, RNAPII, and cells depleted of Elongin A show stronger promoter RNAPII pausing, suggesting that Elongin A may be involved in the release of paused RNAPII. Our RNA-seq studies suggest that loss of Elongin A did not alter global transcription, and unlike prior in vitro studies, we did not observe a dramatic impact on RNAPII elongation rates in our cell-based nascent RNA-seq experiments upon Elongin A depletion. Taken together, our studies provide the first comprehensive analysis of the role of Elongin A in regulating transcription in vivo. Our studies also revealed that unlike prior in vitro findings, depletion of Elongin A has little impact on global transcription profiles and transcription elongation in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W3111284234,"Background A previous multi-site study involving lower- and middle-income countries demonstrated that asthma in older adults is associated with long-term exposure to particulate matter, male gender and smoking. However, variations may occur within individual countries, which are relevant to inform health promoting policies as populations live longer. The present study estimates asthma prevalence and examines the sociodemographic characteristics and environmental determinants associated with asthma in older adults in Ghana. Methods This study utilised data from the nationally representative World Health Organization Study on global AGEing and adult health (SAGE) Ghana Wave 2. A final sample of 4621 individuals residing in 3970 households was used in analytical modelling. Factors associated with asthma were investigated using single level and multilevel binary logistic regression models. Results Asthma was reported by 102 (2.2%) respondents. Factors associated with asthma in the univariate model were: those aged 60–69 (OR = 5.22, 95% CI: 1.24, 21.95) and 70 or more (OR = 5.56, 95% CI: 1.33, 23.26) years, Ga-Adangbe dialect group (OR = 1.65, 95% CI: 1.01, 2.71), no religion (OR = 3.59, 95% CI: 1.77, 7.28), having moderate (OR = 1.76, 95% CI: 1.13, 2.75) and bad/very bad (OR = 2.75, 95% CI: 1.58, 4.80) health state, and severe/extreme difficulty with self-care (OR = 3.49, 95% CI: 1.23, 9.88) and non-flush toilet facility (OR = 0.62, 95% CI: 0.39, 0.99). Factors independently associated with asthma in the adjusted models were: those aged 60–69 (OR = 4.49, 95% CI: 1.03, 19.55) years, father with primary education or less (OR = 0.40, 95% CI: 0.17, 0.94), no religion (OR = 2.52, 95% CI: 1.18, 5.41), and households with non-flush toilet facility (OR = 0.58, 95% CI: 0.35, 0.96). Significant residual household-level variation in asthma was observed. Over 40% of variance in asthma episodes could be attributable to residual household-level variations. Conclusion Individual as well as household factors were seen to influence the prevalence of asthma in this national survey. Clinical management of these patients in health facilities should consider household factors in addition to individual level factors."
https://openalex.org/W3112864504,"Background The cost of university presents various challenges with regards to students’ daily learning activities. This is particularly evident in developing countries, where higher education students face acute financial problems that greatly affect their daily educational activities. In Ethiopia, public university students do benefit from governmental cost-sharing programs. Moreover, health sciences students have additional costs during their clinical placements that are above the common expenses for university students. Objectives Authors aim to explore the challenges that undergraduate health sciences students in their clinical year face with limited pocket money, as well as how students perceive these limited funds affecting their learning activities and their ability to meet challenges. Methods This descriptive qualitative study was conducted at the Department of Medical Radiologic Technology, College of Health Sciences, at Addis Ababa University in Ethiopia. Interviews were conducted between January 28, 2019 and February 1, 2019 with twelve students; and only ten participants were included in the study. The semi-structured questions explored participants’ experiences and perceptions regarding the challenges of a lack of pocket money and its impacts on their learning activities. Their reaction to financial challenges was assessed. Results Four themes that are related to the impact of a lack of money on learning activities emerged from our interviews. First, students believed that their difficulty in obtaining pocket money from family or other funding sources contributed to their financial stress, which negatively impacted their learning. Moreover, their difficulty in affording the basic needs for a student greatly affected their learning abilities in the classroom as well as in their clinical placements. The ability to self-manage was also a significant concern for students, with the pressure to use self-control and proper money management adding to their financial stress. Lastly, students observed that the lack of pocket money affected their ability to make social connections at university, which they saw as negatively impacting their learning abilities. Conclusion Ethiopian undergraduate health sciences students faced many challenges due to the lack of pocket money and these challenges affected student learning both directly or indirectly. Based on our data, we believe that the underlying causes of student financial hardship can be addressed by increasing public awareness of university expenses, clarifying the cost-sharing system to the public, redesigning the cost-sharing policy, and improving university services. Additionally, teaching students self-management skills is also another area that could increase student success."
https://openalex.org/W3110817878,"The trajectory of moving eukaryotic cells depends on the kinetics and direction of extending pseudopods. The direction of pseudopods has been well studied to unravel mechanisms for chemotaxis, wound healing and inflammation. However, the kinetics of pseudopod extension–when and why do pseudopods start and stop- is equally important, but is largely unknown. Here the START and STOP of about 4000 pseudopods was determined in four different species, at four conditions and in nine mutants (fast amoeboids Dictyostelium and neutrophils, slow mesenchymal stem cells, and fungus B . d . chytrid with pseudopod and a flagellum). The START of a first pseudopod is a random event with a probability that is species-specific (23%/s for neutrophils). In all species and conditions, the START of a second pseudopod is strongly inhibited by the extending first pseudopod, which depends on parallel filamentous actin/myosin in the cell cortex. Pseudopods extend at a constant rate by polymerization of branched F-actin at the pseudopod tip, which requires the Scar complex. The STOP of pseudopod extension is induced by multiple inhibitory processes that evolve during pseudopod extension and mainly depend on the increasing size of the pseudopod. Surprisingly, no differences in pseudopod kinetics are detectable between polarized, unpolarized or chemotactic cells, and also not between different species except for small differences in numerical values. This suggests that the analysis has uncovered the fundament of cell movement with distinct roles for stimulatory branched F-actin in the protrusion and inhibitory parallel F-actin in the contractile cortex."
https://openalex.org/W3112492166,"Carbonic anhydrase-IX (CA-IX) is attracting much attention as a target molecule for cancer treatment since high expression of CA-IX can lead to a poor prognosis of patients.

Here, we applied the US2 platform to positron emission tomography (PET) imaging and pharmacological therapy targeting CA-IX high-expressing tumors by introducing 68 Ga and nat In, respectively. In an in vitro cell binding assay, [ 67 Ga]Ga-US2, an alternative complex of [ 68 Ga]Ga-US2 with a longer half-life, markedly bound to CA-IX high-expressing (HT-29) cells compared with low-expressing (MDA-MB-231) cells. In a biodistribution study with HT-29 and MDA-MB-231 tumor-bearing mice, [ 67 Ga]Ga-US2 showed accumulation in the HT-29 tumor (3.81% injected dose/g at 60 min postinjection) and clearance from the blood pool with time. PET with [ 68 Ga]Ga-US2 clearly visualized the HT-29 tumor in model mice at 60 min postinjection. In addition, the administration of [ nat In]In-US2 to HT-29 tumor-bearing mice led to tumor growth delay and prolonged mouse survival, while no critical toxicity was observed. These results indicate that [ 68 Ga]Ga-US2 and [ nat In]In-US2 may be useful imaging and therapeutic agents targeting CA-IX, respectively, and that US2 may serve as an effective cancer theranostic platform utilizing CA-IX."
https://openalex.org/W3112822640,"Most species of modern iguanas (Iguania, Iguanidae) dig burrows for dwelling and nesting, yet neither type of burrow has been interpreted as trace fossils in the geologic record. Here we describe and diagnose the first known fossil example of an iguana nesting burrow, preserved in the Grotto Beach Formation (Early Late Pleistocene, ~115 kya ) on San Salvador Island, The Bahamas. The trace fossil, located directly below a protosol, is exposed in a vertical section of a cross-bedded oolitic eolianite. Abundant root traces, a probable land-crab burrow, and lack of ghost-crab burrows further indicate a vegetated inland dune as the paleoenvironmental setting. The trace fossil matches dimensions and overall forms of burrows made by modern iguanas, and internal structures indicate active backfilling consistent with modern iguana nesting burrows. The trace fossil is also located on an island with a modern native species of rock iguana ( Cyclura riyeli riyeli ), suggesting a presence of iguanas on San Salvador since the Late Pleistocene. This nesting burrow may provide a search image for more fossil iguana burrows in The Bahamas and other places with long-established iguana species and favorable geological conditions for preserving their burrows."

However, while diacutaneous fibrolysis is applied to soft tissue, its effects on muscular properties are unknown. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the effects of diacutaneous fibrolysis on muscle properties as measured by tensiomyography and myotonometry in asymptomatic subjects. An analytical descriptive study was performed. A single session of diacutaneous fibrolysis on the gastrocnemius muscle was applied to one limb (treated limb group) and the other limb was the control (control limb group). Subjects were assessed with tensiomyography and myotonometry before treatment (T0), after treatment (T1) and 30 minutes later (T2). The primary outcomes were tensiomyography and myotonometry variables. The treated limb group showed a statistically significant increase (p&lt;0.05) in tensiomyography parameters. A decrease in rigidity and increase in relaxation was also observed on myotonometry at T1, with some of the effects being maintained at T2. Rigidity and relaxation at T1 were statistically significant between groups (p&lt;0.05). A single session of diacutaneous fibrolysis to the gastrocnemius muscle of asymptomatic subjects produced immediate changes in muscle properties. These changes were maintained 30 minutes after the application of the technique."
https://openalex.org/W3110652088,"The purpose of the study is to solve problems, i.e., increasingly significant processing delay of massive monitoring data and imbalanced tasks in the scheduling and monitoring center for a railway network. To tackle these problems, a method by using a smooth weighted round-robin scheduling based on backpressure flow control (BF-SWRR) is proposed. The method is developed based on a model for message queues and real-time streaming computing. By using telemetry data flow as input data sources, the fields of data sources are segmented into different sets by using a distributed model of stream computing parallel processing. Moreover, the round-robin (RR) scheduling method for the distributed server is improved. The parallelism, memory occupancy, and system delay are tested by taking a high-speed train section of a certain line as an example. The result showed that the BF-SWRR method for clusters can control the delay to within 1 s. When the parallelism of distributed clusters is set to 8, occupancy rates of the CPU and memory can be decreased by about 15%. In this way, the overall load of the cluster during stream computing is more balanced."
https://openalex.org/W3110732201,"Insights into the effects of osteoarthritis (OA) and physical interventions on the musculoskeletal system are limited. Our goal was to analyze musculoskeletal changes in OA mice and test the efficacy of 8-week exposure to hypergravity, as a replacement of physical activity. 16-week-old male (C57BL/6J) mice allocated to sham control and OA groups not centrifuged (Ctrl 1g and OA 1g, respectively) or centrifuged at 2g acceleration (Ctrl 2g and OA 2g). OA 1g displayed decreased trabecular bone in the proximal tibia metaphysis and increased osteoclastic activity and local TNFα gene expression, all entirely prevented by 2g gravitational therapy. However, while cortical bone of tibia midshaft was preserved in OA 1g (vs. ctrl), it is thinner in OA 2g (vs. OA 1g). In the hind limb, OA at 1g increased fibers with lipid droplets by 48% in the tibialis anterior, a fact fully prevented by 2g. In Ctrl, 2g increased soleus, tibialis anterior and gastrocnemius masses. In the soleus of both Ctrl and OA, 2g induced larger fibers and a switch from type-II to type-I fiber. Catabolic (myostatin and its receptor activin RIIb and visfatine) and anabolic (FNDC5) genes dramatically increased in Ctrl 2g and OA 2g (p&lt;0.01 vs 1g). Nevertheless, the overexpression of FNDC5 (and follistatine) was smaller in OA 2g than in Ctrl 2g. Thus, hypergravity in OA mice produced positive effects for trabecular bone and muscle typology, similar to resistance exercises, but negative effects for cortical bone."
https://openalex.org/W3112100866,"Objectives Taiwan has implemented the Diagnosis Related Groups (DRGs) since 2010, and the quality of care under the DRG-Based Payment System is concerned. This study aimed to examine the characteristics, related factors, and time distribution of emergency department (ED) visits, readmission, and hospital transfers of inpatients under the DRG-Based Payment System for each Major Diagnostic Category (MDC). Methods We conducted a retrospective cohort study using data from the National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD) from 2012 to 2013 in Taiwan. Multilevel logistic regression analysis was used to examine the factors related to ED visits, readmissions, and hospital transfers of patients under the DRG-Based Payment System. Results In this study, 103,779 inpatients were under the DRG-Based Payment System. Among these inpatients, 4.66% visited the ED within 14 days after their discharge. The factors associated with the increased risk of ED visits within 14 days included age, lower monthly salary, urbanization of residence area, comorbidity index, MDCs, and hospital ownership (p &lt; 0.05). In terms of MDCs, Diseases and Disorders of the Kidney and Urinary Tract (MDC11) conferred the highest risk of ED visits within 14 days (OR = 4.95, 95% CI: 2.69–9.10). Of the inpatients, 6.97% were readmitted within 30 days. The factors associated with the increased risk of readmission included gender, age, lower monthly salary, comorbidity index, MDCs, and hospital ownership (p &lt; 0.05). In terms of MDCs, the inpatients with Pregnancy, Childbirth and the Puerperium (MDC14) had the highest risk of readmission within 30 days (OR = 20.43, 95% CI: 13.32–31.34). Among the inpatients readmitted within 30 days, 75.05% of them were readmitted within 14 days. Only 0.16% of the inpatients were transferred to other hospitals. Conclusion The study shows a significant correlation between Major Diagnostic Categories in surgery and ED visits, readmission, and hospital transfers. The results suggested that the main reasons for the high risk may need further investigation for MDCs in ED visits, readmissions, and hospital transfers."
https://openalex.org/W3113011984,"Throughout the day, we may sometimes catch ourselves in patterns of thought that we experience as rigid and difficult to disengage from. Such “sticky” thinking can be highly disruptive to ongoing tasks, and when it turns into rumination constitutes a vulnerability for mental disorders such as depression and anxiety. The main goal of the present study was to explore the stickiness dimension of thought, by investigating how stickiness is reflected in task performance and pupil size. To measure spontaneous thought processes, we asked participants to perform a sustained attention to response task (SART), in which we embedded the participant’s concerns to potentially increase the probability of observing sticky thinking. The results indicated that sticky thinking was most frequently experienced when participants were disengaged from the task. Such episodes of sticky thought could be discriminated from neutral and non-sticky thought by an increase in errors on infrequent no-go trials. Furthermore, we found that sticky thought was associated with smaller pupil responses during correct responding. These results demonstrate that participants can report on the stickiness of their thought, and that stickiness can be investigated using pupillometry. In addition, the results suggest that sticky thought may limit attention and exertion of cognitive control to the task."
https://openalex.org/W3113035404,"Background Until now, no vaccine or effective drug is available for the control, prevention, and treatment of COVID-19. Preventive measures are the only ways to be protected from the disease and knowledge of the people about the preventive measures is a vital matter. Objectives The aim of the study was to assess the knowledge of the general people in Rajshahi district, Bangladesh regarding the COVID-19 preventive measures. Methodology This cross sectional study was conducted from March 10 to April 25, 2020. Data were collected with a semi-structured questionnaire from 436 adult respondents selected by using a mixed sampling technique. Frequency analysis, chi-square test, and logistic regression model were utilized in this study. SPSS (IBM, Version 22) was used for data analysis. 95% confidence interval and p-value = 0.05 were accepted for statistical significance. Results Only 21.6% of the respondents had good knowledge of the COVID-19 preventive measures. The highest 67.2% of them knew that washing hands with soap could prevent the disease, but contrarily, the highest 72.5% did not know that avoidance of touching mouth, nose, and eyes without washing hands was a preventive measure. Only 28.4% and 36.9% of the respondents knew that maintaining physical distancing and avoiding mass gatherings were measures of prevention of COVID-19 respectively. The younger age (≤25 years), low family income (≤15,000 Bangladeshi Taka (BDT), occupation others than business and service, and nuclear family had the lower odds of having no/less knowledge about the preventive measures. Conclusions The knowledge level of the general people regarding prevention of COVID-19 was alarmingly low in Bangladesh. The government of Bangladesh, health policy makers and donor agencies should consider the findings and take immediate steps for improving knowledge of the public about prevention of the disease."
https://openalex.org/W3113313204,"Objective The discussion of racism within undergraduate public health classrooms can be highly influenced by local and national conversations about race. We explored the impact of local and national events on students’ ability to name racism on a public health exam highlighting the impact of racism on maternal and infant health disparities for Black mothers. Methods We undertook this research within the context of an undergraduate introductory public health course at a primarily white institution in the Northeastern part of the United States. A qualitative content analysis of undergraduate student responses to a final exam question soliciting the importance of racism to health outcomes among Black mothers in the United States was undertaken. ANOVA tests were run to assess differences on naming racism, using semantic alternatives, and providing alternative explanations during three main time periods: prior to the election of the 45th president of the United States (pre-Trump), after the election (post-Trump), and after a nationally recognized racist campus incident. Results Between the pre- and post-Trump periods we see no differences in naming racism or providing alternative explanations. We do see a reduction in the proportion of students providing semantic alternatives for racism in the post-Trump period (32.2 vs. 25.2%, p = 0.034). After the racist campus incident, we see increases in the proportion of students naming race (53.6 vs. 73.8%, p = 0.021) and decreases in the proportion providing an alternative explanation (43.1 vs. 12.9%, p = 0.004), but no differences in the proportion of students who used semantic alternatives. Discussion This work lends itself to our understanding of how local climate affects public health teaching and may also influence students’ learning about important social and structural determinants of health. National and local climate should frame and guide public health teaching."
https://openalex.org/W3111307245,"Whilst both cardiac output (CO) and total peripheral resistance (TPR) determine mean arterial blood pressure (MAP), their relative importance in the pressor response to isometric exercise remains unclear. This study aimed to elucidate the relative importance of these two different factors by examining pressor responses during cardiopulmonary unloading leading to step-wise reductions in CO. Hemodynamics were investigated in 11 healthy individuals before, during and after two-minute isometric exercise during lower body negative pressure (LBNP; -20mmHg and -40mmHg). The blood pressure response to isometric exercise was similar during normal and reduced preload, despite a step-wise reduction in CO during LBNP (-20mmHg and -40mmHg). During -20mmHg LBNP, the decreased stroke volume, and consequently CO, was counteracted by an increased TPR, while heart rate (HR) was unaffected. HR was increased during -40 mmHg LBNP, although insufficient to maintain CO; the drop in CO was perfectly compensated by an increased TPR to maintain MAP. Likewise, transient application of LBNP (-20mmHg and -40mmHg) resulted in a short transient drop in MAP, caused by a decrease in CO, which was compensated by an increase in TPR. This study suggests that, in case of reductions of CO, changes in TPR are primarily responsible for maintaining the pressor response during isometric exercise. This highlights the relative importance of TPR compared to CO in mediating the pressor response during isometric exercise."
https://openalex.org/W3112124090,"Purpose The present study aimed to evaluate the characteristics of fundus autofluorescence in Japanese patients with retinal angiomatous proliferation (RAP). Methods We retrospectively reviewed 100 eyes from 76 patients (male, n = 45; female, n = 31; age range, 50–94 years; mean ± standard deviation, 81.4 ± 6.4 years) with treatment-naïve RAP, which was diagnosed based on the identification of retinal–retinal anastomosis on early-phase fluorescein angiography or indocyanine green angiography (ICGA) and the identification of a hot spot on late-phase ICGA. RAP was classified into the following three stages: stage 1, proliferation of intraretinal capillaries originating from the deep retinal complex (intraretinal neovascularization); stage 2, growth of the retinal vessels into the subretinal space (subretinal neovascularization); and stage 3, clinically or angiographically observed choroidal neovascularization. In all cases, short-wavelength and near-infrared autofluorescence (SW-AF, NIR-AF) was evaluated using a confocal scanning laser ophthalmoscope. Results The conditions of the 100 eyes were as follows: stage 1 RAP, n = 6 (6%); stage 2 RAP without retinal pigment epithelial detachment (PED), n = 40 (40%); stage 2 RAP with PED, n = 44 (44%); and stage 3 RAP, 10 (10%). On NIR-AF imaging, the number of abnormalities that were observed to correspond to the RAP lesions on ICGA (87 eyes, 87%) was significantly greater in comparison to SW-AF imaging (27 eyes, 27%). The mean follow-up period in all 76 patients was 39.2 months. In the 76 patients with unilateral disease, 21 (21%) eyes developed RAP in the fellow eye during the follow-up period. Among 18 eyes that were examined by both SW-AF and NIR-AF imaging before the onset of RAP lesions, NIR-AF imaging showed hypoautofluorescence in 15 (83%) eyes before the onset of RAP lesions. Conclusions SW-AF and NIR-AF abnormalities may be related to the dysfunction of the photoreceptor/retinal pigment epithelium complex. Hypoautofluorescence on NIR-AF imaging may accurately indicate the presence or onset of RAP lesions."
https://openalex.org/W3112470982,"Excessive nitric oxide (NO) production and mitochondrial dysfunction can activate protein degradation in disuse-induced skeletal muscle atrophy. However, the increase in NO production in atrophied muscles remains controversial. In addition, although several studies have investigated the PTEN-induced kinase 1 (PINK1)/Parkin pathway, a mitophagy pathway, in atrophied muscle, the involvement of this pathway in soleus muscle atrophy is unclear. In this study, we investigated the involvement of neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) and the PINK1/Parkin pathway in soleus muscle atrophy induced by 14 days of hindlimb unloading (HU) in adult rats. HU lowered the weight of the soleus muscles. nNOS expression showed an increase in atrophied soleus muscles. Although HU increased malondialdehyde as oxidative modification of the protein, it decreased 6-nitrotryptophan, a marker of protein nitration. Additionally, the nitrosocysteine content and S-nitrosylated Parkin were not altered, suggesting the absence of excessive nitrosative stress after HU. The expression of PINK1 and Parkin was also unchanged, whereas the expression of heat shock protein 70 (HSP70), which is required for Parkin activity, was reduced in atrophied soleus muscles. Moreover, we observed accumulation and reduced ubiquitination of high molecular weight mitofusin 2, which is a target of Parkin, in atrophied soleus muscles. These results indicate that excessive NO is not produced in atrophied soleus muscles despite nNOS accumulation, suggesting that excessive NO dose not mediate in soleus muscle atrophy at least after 14 days of HU. Furthermore, the PINK1/Parkin pathway may not play a role in mitophagy at this time point. In contrast, the activity of Parkin may be downregulated because of reduced HSP70 expression, which may contribute to attenuated degradation of target proteins in the atrophied soleus muscles after 14 days of HU. The present study provides new insights into the roles of nNOS and a protein degradation pathway in soleus muscle atrophy."
https://openalex.org/W3112731703,G Protein-Coupled Receptors (GPCRs) mediate intracellular signaling in response to extracellular ligand binding and are the target of one-third of approved drugs. Ligand binding modulates the GPCR molecular free energy landscape by preferentially stabilizing active or inactive conformations that dictate intracellular protein recruitment and downstream signaling. We perform enhanced sampling molecular dynamics simulations to recover the free energy surfaces of a thermostable mutant of the GPCR serotonin receptor 5-HT 2B in the unliganded form and bound to a lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) agonist and lisuride antagonist. LSD binding imparts a ∼110 kJ/mol driving force for conformational rearrangement into an active state. The lisuride-bound form is structurally similar to the apo form and only ∼24 kJ/mol more stable. This work quantifies ligand-induced conformational specificity and functional selectivity of 5-HT 2B and presents a platform for high-throughput virtual screening of ligands and rational engineering of the ligand-bound molecular free energy landscape.
https://openalex.org/W3111063490,"Newborns, regardless of the method of termination of pregnancy, are exposed to the first exogenous stress factors during delivery. The purpose of the study was to evaluate the differences in newborns’ thermal response to vaginal (VD) vs caesarean section (CS) delivery. The temperature was measured during the first minutes of life within 122 healthy full-term newborns, on the forehead, chest and upper-back by infrared camera (FLIR T1030sc HD). The lowest temperatures were recorded in the forehead of VD newborns (significantly difference with CS; p &lt; 0.001), the warmest was the chest. A significant correlation was found between the duration of the second stage of natural childbirth and surface temperature and pO2 in the newborn blood. The temperatures of selected body surface areas correlate highly positively, regardless of the mode of delivery. In the case of healthy neonates, with normal birth weight and full-term, VD creates more favourable conditions stimulating the mechanisms of adaptation for a newborn than CS."
https://openalex.org/W3113077457,"The signal peptides, present at the N-terminus of many proteins, guide the proteins into cell membranes. In some proteins, the signal peptide is with an extended N-terminal region. Previously, it was demonstrated that the N-terminally extended signal peptide of the human PTPRJ contains a cluster of arginine residues, which attenuates translation. The analysis of the mammalian orthologous sequences revealed that this sequence is highly conserved. The PTPRJ transcripts in placentals, marsupials, and monotremes encode a stretch of 10–14 arginine residues, positioned 11–12 codons downstream of the initiating AUG. The remarkable conservation of the repeated arginine residues in the PTPRJ signal peptides points to their key role. Further, the presence of an arginine cluster in the extended signal peptides of other proteins (E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase, NOTCH3) is noted and indicates a more general importance of this cis-acting mechanism of translational suppression."
https://openalex.org/W3112669174,"Background Presepsin is involved in binding lipopolysaccharides and previous studies have confirmed its value as a marker for early diagnosis and prediction of severity in sepsis. Comparable studies assessing the predictive potential regarding postoperative complications and mortality following pancreatic resection are lacking. Methods This prospective study included 70 patients undergoing pancreatic resection from December 2017 until May 2019. Presepsin was measured preoperatively, on postoperative day 1, 3 and 8 (POD1/3/8) and correlated with the clinical course and mortality. Results Severe complications (Clavien-Dindo ≥3a) occurred in 28 patients (40%), postoperative pancreatic fistula (POPF) grade B/C occurred in 20 patients (28.6%), infectious complications in 28 (40%), and four patients (5.7%) died during hospital stay. Presepsin levels at any timepoint did not correlate with further development of postoperative complications or in-hospital mortality whereas CRP levels on postoperative day (POD) 3 were significantly associated with clinically relevant POPF (AUC 0.664, 95%CI 0.528–0.800; p = 0.033). Preoperative Presepsin levels as well as Presepsin on POD1 were significantly elevated in patients with malignant compared to benign underlying disease (299pg/ml vs. 174pg/ml and 693.5pg/ml vs. 294pg/ml; p = 0.009 and 0.013, respectively). Conclusion In our cohort, Presepsin was not eligible to predict the postoperative course following pancreatic resection. However, Presepsin levels were significantly elevated in patients with malignant disease, this finding warrants further investigation."
