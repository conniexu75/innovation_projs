https://openalex.org/W2912017471,"Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are an intriguing class of RNA due to their covalently closed structure, high stability, and implicated roles in gene regulation. Here, we used an exome capture RNA sequencing protocol to detect and characterize circRNAs across >2,000 cancer samples. When compared against Ribo-Zero and RNase R, capture sequencing significantly enhanced the enrichment of circRNAs and preserved accurate circular-to-linear ratios. Using capture sequencing, we built the most comprehensive catalog of circRNA species to date: MiOncoCirc, the first database to be composed primarily of circRNAs directly detected in tumor tissues. Using MiOncoCirc, we identified candidate circRNAs to serve as biomarkers for prostate cancer and were able to detect circRNAs in urine. We further detected a novel class of circular transcripts, termed read-through circRNAs, that involved exons originating from different genes. MiOncoCirc will serve as a valuable resource for the development of circRNAs as diagnostic or therapeutic targets across cancer types."

However, chimpanzee tissue is inaccessible during neocortical neurogenesis when differences in brain size first appear. To identify human-specific features of cortical development, we leveraged recent innovations that permit generating pluripotent stem cell-derived cerebral organoids from chimpanzee. Despite metabolic differences, organoid models preserve gene regulatory networks related to primary cell types and developmental processes. We further identified 261 differentially expressed genes in human compared to both chimpanzee organoids and macaque cortex, enriched for recent gene duplications, and including multiple regulators of PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling. We observed increased activation of this pathway in human radial glia, dependent on two receptors upregulated specifically in human: INSR and ITGB8. Our findings establish a platform for systematic analysis of molecular changes contributing to human brain development and evolution."
https://openalex.org/W2911928150,"Cell size varies greatly between cell types, yet within a specific cell type and growth condition, cell size is narrowly distributed. Why maintenance of a cell-type specific cell size is important remains poorly understood. Here we show that growing budding yeast and primary mammalian cells beyond a certain size impairs gene induction, cell-cycle progression, and cell signaling. These defects are due to the inability of large cells to scale nucleic acid and protein biosynthesis in accordance with cell volume increase, which effectively leads to cytoplasm dilution. We further show that loss of scaling beyond a certain critical size is due to DNA becoming limiting. Based on the observation that senescent cells are large and exhibit many of the phenotypes of large cells, we propose that the range of DNA:cytoplasm ratio that supports optimal cell function is limited and that ratios outside these bounds contribute to aging."

To fully characterize the transcriptome of localized prostate cancer, we performed ultra-deep total RNA-seq on 144 tumors with rich clinical annotation. This revealed a linear transcriptomic subtype associated with the aggressive intraductal carcinoma sub-histology and a fusion profile that differentiates localized from metastatic disease. Analysis of back-splicing events showed widespread RNA circularization, with the average tumor expressing 7,232 circular RNAs (circRNAs). The degree of circRNA production was correlated to disease progression in multiple patient cohorts. Loss-of-function screening identified 11.3% of highly abundant circRNAs as essential for cell proliferation; for ∼90% of these, their parental linear transcripts were not essential. Individual circRNAs can have distinct functions, with circCSNK1G3 promoting cell growth by interacting with miR-181. These data advocate for adoption of ultra-deep RNA-seq without poly-A selection to interrogate both linear and circular transcriptomes.

Prostate cancer is the most frequently diagnosed non-cutaneous cancer in men worldwide (Mohler et al., 2016Mohler J.L. Armstrong A.J. Bahnson R.R. D’Amico A.V. Davis B.J. Eastham J.A. Enke C.A.

A poorly characterized component of the prostate cancer transcriptome is circular transcripts (circRNAs), which have been implicated in other diseases (Guarnerio et al., 2016Guarnerio J. Bezzi M.

The biogenesis and emerging roles of circular RNAs.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2016; 17: 205-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (1105) Google Scholar). As a result, full diversity of the prostate cancer transcriptome and its implication remained hidden. To fill this gap, we performed ultra-deep non-poly-A RNA-seq on 144 localized prostate tumors, linked to long-term clinical follow-up. This allowed us to map the transcriptome in unprecedented depth, identifying 1,233 unique fusion genes (21 recurrent and 2 prognostic) and 76,311 distinct circRNAs. The global burden of circRNAs was correlated with tumor aggressivity, and 171 circRNAs essential to prostate cancer cell proliferation were identified. These data show that the cancer transcriptome harbors numerous functional entities not observable with traditional molecular strategies. To assess the transcriptome of prostate cancer, we assembled a cohort of 144 patients with sporadic, localized, intermediate-risk disease (CPC-GENE, Canadian Prostate Cancer Genome Network). All patients were treated by radical prostatectomy, with median 6.5-years follow-up (Table S1). A treatment-naive surgical specimen was subjected to pathology review and then macro-dissected to a minimum of 70% tumor cellularity. The RNA of each sample was quantified via strand-specific, ribosomal RNA-depleted RNA-seq, with a median of 382 million (M) ± 138 M reads per tumor. After processing through standard quality-control and data-processing pipelines (Table S1; Figure S1A), the median tumor harbored 118,753 ± 7,373 transcripts, derived from 17,958 ± 333 coding and 17,742 ± 1,579 non-coding genes. There were 18,340 transcripts present in all tumors, including 15,112 protein-coding isoforms such as AR, MYC, and KLK3 (Figures 1A and 1B ). High-abundance transcripts were often ubiquitous: 12,797 of the 13,416 most abundant were detected in every sample. By contrast, an intriguing subset of 180 high-abundance transcripts were detected in five or fewer samples (i.e., 3.5% of patients), making them candidate enhancer-hijacking events (Weischenfeldt et al., 2017Weischenfeldt J.

The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) network identified integrated prostate cancer subtypes (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2015Cancer Genome Atlas Research NetworkThe Molecular Taxonomy of Primary Prostate Cancer.Cell. 2015; 163: 1011-1025Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1861) Google Scholar). To link these to transcriptomic subtypes, we applied unsupervised machine learning to the top quartile of transcripts detected in all samples, ranked by interquartile range. These 4,585 transcripts included 3,905 protein-coding and 680 non-coding (353 antisense, 286 lncRNA [long non-coding RNA], 12 snRNA [small nuclear RNA] and 29 snoRNA [small nucleolar RNA]) and delineated five patient subtypes (P1–P5) and five RNA subtypes (R1–R5; Figures 1C, S1B, and S1C). The average silhouette score was 0.76 for sample clustering and 0.39 for gene clustering (Figure S1D). Samples in P1–P3 had higher global genomic instability, assessed as the percent of the genome with a copy-number aberration (PGA, Student’s t test, p = 3.29 × 10−4; Figure S1E). P1 also had a higher proportion of prostate cancer driver genes deleted than other subtypes, including the tumor suppressors NKX3-1 (78% versus 42%; p = 1.6 × 10−3, proportions test), TP53 (50% versus 19%; p = 8.0 × 10−3, proportions test), and PTEN (60% versus 30%; p = 8.7 × 10−4, proportions test; Figure S1F). Intriguingly, 63% of samples in P1 harbored intraductal carcinoma and cribriform architecture (IDC/CA) relative to 20%–40% of patients in other subtypes (p = 0.013; χ2 test). While IDC/CA is associated with aggressive prostate cancer (Böttcher et al., 2018Böttcher R. Kweldam C.F. Livingstone J. Lalonde E. Yamaguchi T.N. Huang V. Yousif F. Fraser M. Bristow R.G. van der Kwast T. et al.Cribriform and intraductal prostate cancer are associated with increased genomic instability and distinct genomic alterations.BMC Cancer. 2018; 18: 8Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, Chua et al., 2017Chua M.L.K.

Urol. 2017; 72: 665-674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), the rate of biochemical relapse (BCR) did not differ among the patient subtypes (log-rank test, p = 0.88; Figure S1G). Samples in P2 had the highest proportion of CHD1 deletions (46% versus 13%; p = 3.4 × 10−4; proportions test; Figure S1F), reminiscent of a TCGA subtype characterized by aberrant SPOP and CHD1 (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2015Cancer Genome Atlas Research NetworkThe Molecular Taxonomy of Primary Prostate Cancer.Cell. 2015; 163: 1011-1025Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1861) Google Scholar). Systematic comparison of our transcriptomic subtypes to the TCGA ones confirmed the similarity of P2 to the TCGA subtype distinguished by SPOP and CHD1 mutations. By contrast, the other transcriptomic subtypes did not closely match specific TCGA subtypes (Figure S1H). We also compared our transcriptomic subtypes to previously defined copy-number alteration (CNA) ones (Fraser et al., 2017Fraser M. Sabelnykova V.Y. Yamaguchi T.N. Heisler L.E. Livingstone J. Huang V. Shiah Y.-J. Yousif F. Lin X. Masella A.P. et al.Genomic hallmarks of localized, non-indolent prostate cancer.Nature. 2017; 541: 359-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar): 44% (15/34) of samples in P3 correspond to a genomic subtype characterized by recurrent sub-telomeric amplifications, while P4 and P5 correspond to a copy-number quiet genomic subtype (72%; 49/68; Figures S1I and S1J). Despite these specific membership overlaps, overall similarity between CNA and transcriptomic subtypes was low (Adjusted Rand index = 0.134), suggesting that multiple transcriptomic phenotypes can emerge from single genomic ones. To assess the functional hallmarks of each RNA subtype, we used g:Profiler (Reimand et al., 2016Reimand J. Arak T. Adler P. Kolberg L. Reisberg S. Peterson H. Vilo J. g:Profiler-a web server for functional interpretation of gene lists (2016 update).Nucleic Acids Res. 2016; 44: W83-W89Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar) to identify significantly enriched pathways (false discovery rate [FDR] < 0.05; Table S1; Figure S1K). Since R5 was enriched in immune-related pathways, we associated the abundance of these genes with immune activity. The mean abundance of genes in R5 was positively correlated with the percentage of infiltrating immune cells (Yoshihara et al., 2013Yoshihara K. Shahmoradgoli M. Martínez E. Vegesna R. Kim H. Torres-Garcia W. Treviño V. Shen H. Laird P.W. Levine D.A. et al.Inferring tumour purity and stromal and immune cell admixture from expression data.Nat Commun. 2013; 4: 2612Crossref PubMed Scopus (3587) Google Scholar) (Spearman’s ρ = 0.66; p < 2.2 × 10−16) and cytolytic activity (Rooney et al., 2015Rooney M.S. Shukla S.A. Wu C.J. Getz G. Hacohen N. Molecular and genetic properties of tumors associated with local immune cytolytic activity.Cell. 2015; 160: 48-61Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2119) Google Scholar) (Spearman’s ρ = 0.67, p = 7.20 × 10−19; Figure S1L). These pathway differences suggest that transcriptomic subtypes may be initiated or driven differently. To identify candidate tumor-specific isoforms, we next evaluated the landscape of fusion genes. Our deep-sequencing coverage revealed fusions not detectable in previous RNA-seq studies, with 1,223 unique fusions identified (Table S1). The median tumor harbored 14 ± 13 distinct fusions (median ± SD). There were 21 recurrent fusions (≥10% of the cohort; Figure 1D). Of the recurrent fusions, 13 were read-through fusions, including the SLC45A3:ELK4 fusion seen in almost all patients (142/146), as expected (Rickman et al., 2009Rickman D.S. Pflueger D. Moss B. VanDoren V.E. Chen C.X. de la Taille A. Kuefer R. Tewari A.K. Setlur S.R. Demichelis F. Rubin M.A. SLC45A3-ELK4 is a novel and frequent erythroblast transformation-specific fusion transcript in prostate cancer.Cancer Res. 2009; 69: 2734-2738Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). A previously unreported read-through fusion involved the SCHLAP1 lncRNA and UBE2E3 mRNA. SCHLAP1 is associated with aggressive prostate cancer (Bhandari et al., 2019Bhandari V. Hoey C. Liu L.Y. Lalonde E. Ray J. Livingstone J. Lesurf R. Shiah Y.-J. Vujcic T. Huang X. et al.Molecular landmarks of tumor hypoxia across cancer types.Nat.

Genet. 2013; 45: 1392-1398Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar), but this fusion was not associated with disease relapse. We also identified a read-through fusion between RP11-356O9.1 and TTC6, genes flanking FOXA1 but on opposite strand. Both this fusion and TBCEL:TECTA were associated with BCR (Figures S1M and S1N), and tumors harboring both were at elevated risk for relapse (p = 0.006; hazard ratio [HR] = 5.00, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.6–15.7; Figure S1O). We next examined the relationship between each pairwise combination of the 21 recurrent fusions. Recurrent fusions co-occurred more than expected by chance (permutation test with 106 iterations; p = 1.0 × 10−6; Figure 1D). Interestingly, the tumor-initiating TMPRSS2:ERG (T2E) fusion was neither significantly co-occurring nor mutually exclusive with others (hypergeometric test; Q > 0.05). Rather, SCHLAP1:UBE2E3 fusion co-occurred with TBCEL:TECTA, SAMD5:SASH1, and AC004066.3:PPA2 fusions (hypergeometric test; Q < 0.05). Concordant with the concept of nimbosus, SCHLAP1:UBE2E3 fusion was also strongly associated with IDC/CA (Figure 1D; proportions test; FDR = 0.0015) (Chua et al., 2017Chua M.L.K. Lo W. Pintilie M.

Urol. 2017; 72: 665-674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). To understand interplay between somatic mutations and the transcriptome, we explored associations between the recurrent fusions with 40 previously published genomic driver events (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2015Cancer Genome Atlas Research NetworkThe Molecular Taxonomy of Primary Prostate Cancer.Cell. 2015; 163: 1011-1025Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1861) Google Scholar, Fraser et al., 2017Fraser M.

Recapitulating previous results, T2E fusion was associated with TP53 and PTEN mutations, while T2E-negative tumors were enriched for SPOP and CHD1 mutations (Figure S1P). SPOP mutations co-occurred with PRCAT47:CDYL2 fusion (proportions test; Q = 0.045). These associations corroborate previous findings that SPOP mutations drive prostate tumorigenesis through a mechanism independent of T2E fusion and PTEN loss (Blattner et al., 2017Blattner M. Liu D. Robinson B.D. Huang D. Poliakov A. Gao D. Nataraj S. Deonarine L.D.

To determine whether the fusion landscape changes with transition to lethal castrate-resistant disease, we analyzed fusions in metastatic lesions from the Stand Up 2 Cancer (SU2C) cohort using the same pipeline (Figure 1E) (Robinson et al., 2015Robinson D. Van Allen E.M. Wu Y.-M. Schultz N. Lonigro R.J. Mosquera J.M. Montgomery B. Taplin M.-E. Pritchard C.C. Attard G. et al.Integrative Clinical Genomics of Advanced Prostate Cancer.Cell. 2015; 162: 454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). Fusions were twice as common in metastatic as in localized tumors, despite lower sequencing coverage for metastases (median 28 versus 14; p = 1.2 × 10−8; Mann–Whitney U test). There were 33 recurrent fusions, including TBCEL:TECTA found in 34% of metastases. Unlike in localized disease, fusions in metastatic lesions did not tend toward either mutual exclusivity or co-occurring (permutation test, 106 iterations). Overall, 17 fusions were significantly enriched and 6 significantly depleted in metastatic relative to localized tumors, including 12 recurrent in metastatic lesions but undetected in localized ones (logistic regression and Fisher’s exact test; Q < 0.05; Figure 1E). This shift in fusion genes may be indicative of selective adaptation to treatment and adaptation to metastatic sites or disease progression, and it highlights new candidate metastasis drivers. The ubiquity of read-through fusions in prostate cancer suggests dysfunctional transcription and splicing machinery, which could affect splicing events like RNA circularization (Chen, 2016Chen L.-L. The biogenesis and emerging roles of circular RNAs.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2016; 17: 205-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (1105) Google Scholar). Our data provide a unique opportunity to assess circRNAs. Using CIRCexplorer (Zhang et al., 2014Zhang X.-O. Wang H.-B. Zhang Y. Lu X. Chen L.-L. Yang L. Complementary sequence-mediated exon circularization.Cell. 2014; 159: 134-147Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1233) Google Scholar), we identified 76,311 distinct circRNAs (≥2 back-splicing reads [BSRs]) in the CPC-GENE cohort (Figure 2A). BSRs generally followed a negative binomial distribution (Figures S2A and S2B), allowing calculation of circRNA abundance via FPKM (fragments per kilobase of transcript per million mapped reads) quantification. Using linear fusion transcript information, we detected 62 fusion-circRNAs (f-circRNAs), which occurred more frequently in tumors with greater extent (Figure S2C). Because of the lack of recurrence for f-circRNAs, we elected to focus on canonical circRNAs, but these f-circRNAs represent a class of intriguing biomarker candidates.Figure S2Quantification and Characterization of circRNA and Parental Gene, Related to Figure 2Show full caption(A) P values from Kolmogorov-Smirnov test between observed and simulated data with negative binomial model on a -log10 transformed scale.(B) The proportion of observed data explained by simulated data in a linear model, for all data (left two columns) and data excluding the 2% circRNAs with highest read counts (right two columns).(C) Fusion circRNA distribution.

Collectively, these data show that chronic inflammation permanently reconfigures the tissue-resident TCRγδ+ IEL compartment in CeD. Tissue-resident lymphocytes have been investigated extensively under steady-state conditions and during the induction of local memory populations in response to acute infections (Mueller and Mackay, 2016Mueller S.N. Mackay L.K. Tissue-resident memory T cells: local specialists in immune defence.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2016; 16: 79-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar). In mice, the tissue-resident TCRαβ+ CD8αβ+ pool is highly stable and responds to secondary antigenic challenge via local proliferation of pre-existing memory cells (Beura et al., 2018Beura L.K. Mitchell J.S. Thompson E.A. Schenkel J.M. Mohammed J. Wijeyesinghe S. Fonseca R. Burbach B.J. Hickman H.D.

Immunol. 2018; 19: 183-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar), which endure over time despite the accumulation of new tissue-resident populations driven by subsequent infections (Park et al., 2018Park S.L. Zaid A. Hor J.L. Christo S.N. Prier J.E. Davies B. Alexandre Y.O. Gregory J.L. Russell T.A. Gebhardt T. et al.Local proliferation maintains a stable pool of tissue-resident memory T cells after antiviral recall responses.Nat. Immunol. 2018; 19: 183-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). However, it remains unclear whether chronic inflammation can permanently reconfigure the tissue-resident T cell compartment. Intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs) expressing γδ T cell receptors (TCRs) are tissue-resident T cells that play a key role in immune surveillance via dynamic scanning of the intestinal epithelium (Hoytema van Konijnenburg et al., 2017Hoytema van Konijnenburg D.P. Reis B.S. Pedicord V.A. Farache J. Victora G.D. Mucida D. Intestinal epithelial and intraepithelial T cell crosstalk mediates a dynamic response to infection.Cell. 2017; 171: 783-794.e13Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Murine TCRγδ+ cells seed the intestine early in life, irrespective of microbial colonization or exposure to dietary antigen (Di Marco Barros et al., 2016Di Marco Barros R. Roberts N.A. Dart R.J. Vantourout P. Jandke A. Nussbaumer O. Deban L. Cipolat S. Hart R.

Lambolez F. Mucida D. The light and dark sides of intestinal intraepithelial lymphocytes.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2011; 11: 445-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). Moreover, the peripheral and intraepithelial TCRγδ+ compartments are largely non-overlapping as a consequence of distinct migratory characteristics, especially a lack of recirculating IELs (Chennupati et al., 2010Chennupati V. Worbs T. Liu X. Malinarich F.H. Schmitz S. Haas J.D. Malissen B. Förster R. Prinz I. Intra- and intercompartmental movement of γδ T cells: intestinal intraepithelial and peripheral γδ T cells represent exclusive nonoverlapping populations with distinct migration characteristics.J.

Extrathymic derivation of gut lymphocytes in parabiotic mice.Immunology. 1999; 96: 57-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Celiac disease (CeD) is a gastrointestinal inflammatory disorder triggered and maintained by dietary exposure to gluten (Jabri and Sollid, 2009Jabri B. Sollid L.M. Tissue-mediated control of immunopathology in coeliac disease.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2009; 9: 858-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Antigen exposure can therefore be controlled in vivo, providing a unique opportunity to study the dynamics of human tissue-resident T cells in the setting of chronic inflammation. Active disease is characterized histologically by villous atrophy and immunologically by expanded populations of IELs (Jabri and Sollid, 2009Jabri B. Sollid L.M. Tissue-mediated control of immunopathology in coeliac disease.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2009; 9: 858-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Adherence to a gluten-free diet (GFD) leads to resolution of the villous abnormalities, together with a decrease in the frequencies of gluten-specific TCRαβ+ CD4+ T cells in the lamina propria and cytolytic TCRαβ+ CD8+ IELs, which are consequently implicated in the pathogenesis of CeD (Jabri and Sollid, 2009Jabri B. Sollid L.M. Tissue-mediated control of immunopathology in coeliac disease.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2009; 9: 858-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). In contrast, TCRγδ+ IEL expansions generally persist in situ, despite a lack of exposure to gluten (Kutlu et al., 1993Kutlu T. Brousse N. Rambaud C. Le Deist F. Schmitz J. Cerf-Bensussan N. Numbers of T cell receptor (TCR) αβ+ but not of TcR γδ+ intraepithelial lymphocytes correlate with the grade of villous atrophy in coeliac patients on a long term normal diet.Gut. 1993; 34: 208-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). For this reason, tissue-resident TCRγδ+ IELs are thought to regulate disease activity (Hayday, 2000Hayday A.C. γδ cells: a right time and a right place for a conserved third way of protection.Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 975-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (958) Google Scholar), potentially by suppressing the influx of circulating T cells and/or by maintaining tissue integrity (Hayday et al., 2001Hayday A. Theodoridis E. Ramsburg E. Shires J. Intraepithelial lymphocytes: exploring the Third Way in immunology.Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 997-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar), rather than participate actively in the pathogenesis of CeD (Kutlu et al., 1993Kutlu T. Brousse N. Rambaud C. Le Deist F. Schmitz J. Cerf-Bensussan N. Numbers of T cell receptor (TCR) αβ+ but not of TcR γδ+ intraepithelial lymphocytes correlate with the grade of villous atrophy in coeliac patients on a long term normal diet.Gut. 1993; 34: 208-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). However, these propositions remain speculative, pending a detailed functional evaluation of TCRγδ+ IELs in patients with CeD. We set out to address this knowledge gap and more fundamentally to determine the effects of chronic inflammation on human tissue-resident TCRγδ+ IELs. In line with previous studies (Halstensen et al., 1989Halstensen T.S. Scott H. Brandtzaeg P. Intraepithelial T cells of the TcR γ/δ+ CD8- and Vδ1/Jδ1+ phenotypes are increased in celiac disease.Scand. J. Immunol. 1989; 30: 665-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar, Kutlu et al., 1993Kutlu T. Brousse N. Rambaud C. Le Deist F. Schmitz J. Cerf-Bensussan N. Numbers of T cell receptor (TCR) αβ+ but not of TcR γδ+ intraepithelial lymphocytes correlate with the grade of villous atrophy in coeliac patients on a long term normal diet.Gut. 1993; 34: 208-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), we found higher frequencies (Figure 1A) and absolute numbers (Figure 1B) of Vδ1+ IELs in patients with CeD relative to healthy controls (Table S1), irrespective of adherence to a GFD (Figure 1C). Moreover, Vδ1+ T cells constituted a significantly higher fraction of all TCRγδ+ IELs in patients with active CeD (Figure 1D). A majority of Vδ1+ IELs in healthy controls and patients with CeD expressed markers of tissue residency, namely CD69 and CD103 (Mueller and Mackay, 2016Mueller S.N. Mackay L.K. Tissue-resident memory T cells: local specialists in immune defence.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2016; 16: 79-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar) (Figure 1E). Vδ1+ IELs also expressed low levels of CD45RA and CCR7, indicative of an effector memory (TEM) phenotype (Sallusto et al., 1999Sallusto F. Lenig D. Förster R. Lipp M. Lanzavecchia A. Two subsets of memory T lymphocytes with distinct homing potentials and effector functions.Nature. 1999; 401: 708-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (4625) Google Scholar), whereas the corresponding Vδ1+ peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) comprised a mixture of naive and terminally differentiated effector (TEMRA) cells (Figure 1F). Expanded populations of Vδ1+ IELs were therefore integrated as bona fide tissue-resident lymphocytes in patients with CeD. TCRαβ+ CD8αβ+ IELs in patients with CeD typically express increased levels of NKG2D and activating CD94/NKG2A– NK receptors (Jabri and Sollid, 2009Jabri B. Sollid L.M. Tissue-mediated control of immunopathology in coeliac disease.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2009; 9: 858-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). We found no evidence of a similar phenotype among Vδ1+ IELs from patients with active CeD (Figures S1A and S1B). However, a vast majority of control Vδ1+ IELs expressed the activating natural cytotoxicity receptors (NCRs) NKp46 and/or NKp44 (Figure 2A), irrespective of age (Figure 2B) and in situ expansion (Figure S1C). These observations suggested a definitive tissue-resident phenotype, reinforced by a lack of NCR expression on the surface of Vδ1+ PBLs (Figure S1D). In contrast, Vδ1+ IELs from patients with active or GFD-treated CeD rarely expressed NKp46 and almost exclusively lacked NKp44 (Figure 2A). This disease-associated loss of NCR+ Vδ1+ IELs was refractory to long-term treatment with a GFD, unlike the concomitant loss of NCR+ CD3– IELs, indicating a cell type-restricted effect distinct from the generic microenvironmental perturbations induced by CeD (Figures 2A and S1E). Moreover, Vδ1+ IELs expressing NKp46 and NKp44 were absent from the duodenum, the site of tissue destruction, but present in the colon of patients with GFD-treated CeD (Figure 2C). These results suggested that chronic inflammation precipitated an irretrievable and active site-specific loss of NK-like Vδ1+ IELs in patients with CeD.Figure 2Innate-like Vδ1+ IELs Are Lost in CeDShow full caption(A) Frequency of IELs expressing NKp46 with or without NKp44.

One-way ANOVA with Tukey’s test for multiple comparisons. See also Figures S1 and S6. To determine the functional relevance of these NCRs, we measured cellular degranulation ex vivo and in response to stimulation with IL-15, which is upregulated under inflammatory conditions and is known to promote NK receptor-mediated cytolytic activity (Jabri and Abadie, 2015Jabri B. Abadie V. IL-15 functions as a danger signal to regulate tissue-resident T cells and tissue destruction.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2015; 15: 771-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Co-engagement of NKp46 and NKp44 in conjunction with TCR ligation significantly increased granule exocytosis among control Vδ1+ IELs relative to TCR ligation alone (Figure 2D), but only after pre-stimulation with IL-15 (Figures 2D and S1F). Vδ1+ IELs from healthy controls also expressed high levels of the cytolytic molecule granzyme B (Figure S1G) and degranulated at significantly higher frequencies than Vδ1+ IELs from patients with CeD (Figure 2E). These findings revealed that the healthy small intestine harbored a unique set of innate-like and potentially cytolytic Vδ1+ IELs that were displaced in the setting of CeD. To examine the functional properties of Vδ1+ IELs in more depth, we extended our analysis to cytokine production directly ex vivo. Control Vδ1+ IELs produced very little interferon (IFN)-γ or tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α on a percent cell basis (Figure 3A). In contrast, approximately 50% of Vδ1+ IELs from patients with active CeD produced IFN-γ, but not TNF-α (Figure 3A). Significantly lower frequencies of IFN-γ+ Vδ1+ IELs were detected in patients with GFD-treated CeD (Figure 3A). Irrespective of disease status, Vδ1+ PBLs produced both IFN-γ and TNF-α, and neither TCRαβ+ CD8αβ+ nor TCRαβ+ CD4+ IELs displayed enhanced production of IFN-γ in patients with active CeD (Figure 3A). A significant increase in IFN-γ production was also detected among Vδ1+ IELs isolated from patients with GFD-treated CeD after gluten challenge relative to donor-matched Vδ1+ IELs isolated prior to gluten challenge, whereas no such chronological differences were observed in the corresponding TCRαβ+ CD8αβ+ or TCRαβ+ CD4+ IEL compartments (Figure 3B). These data suggested a gluten-dependent and cell type-restricted gain of IFN-γ-producing function among Vδ1+ IELs in patients with active CeD. In further analyses, we performed ex vivo RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) to determine whether naturally occurring Vδ1+ IELs, represented by the prevalent NKp46+ (NCR+) subset in healthy controls, were fundamentally distinct from disease-associated Vδ1+ IELs, represented by the prevalent NKp46– (NCR–) subset in patients with CeD. A total of 645 genes exhibited differential expression between control NCR+ Vδ1+ IELs and NCR– Vδ1+ IELs from patients with active CeD (Figure S2A). Similar differences were observed in comparisons between control NCR+ Vδ1+ IELs and NCR– Vδ1+ IELs from patients with GFD-treated CeD (Figure S2B). Moreover, this overarching dichotomy was confirmed using minimum spanning tree (MST) analysis (Xu et al., 2002Xu Y. Olman V. Xu D. Clustering gene expression data using a graph-theoretic approach: an application of minimum spanning trees.Bioinformatics. 2002; 18: 536-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar), which showed that control NCR+ Vδ1+ IELs formed distinct clusters relative to NCR– Vδ1+ IELs from patients with active or GFD-treated CeD (Figure 4A).Figure 4The Transcriptional Program of Vδ1+ IELs Is Permanently Altered in CeDShow full caption(A) Transcriptional profiles of NCR+ Vδ1+ IELs from healthy controls, NCR– Vδ1+ IELs from patients with active CeD, and NCR– Vδ1+ IELs from patients with GFD-treated CeD compared using minimum spanning tree analysis.(B) Differentially expressed genes from the NK module passing a false discovery rate < 10% from any two-way contrast between the Vδ1+ IEL populations in (A).

Targeted analysis of genes encoding archetypal NK receptors and cytolytic effector molecules (Table S2; Meresse et al., 2006Meresse B. Curran S.A. Ciszewski C. Orbelyan G. Setty M. Bhagat G. Lee L. Tretiakova M. Semrad C. Kistner E. et al.Reprogramming of CTLs into natural killer-like cells in celiac disease.J. Exp. Med. 2006; 203: 1343-1355Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar) confirmed the innate-like nature and cytolytic potential of control Vδ1+ IELs (Figure 4B). In particular, GZMK, FCGR3A, and TYROBP were significantly overexpressed among control NCR+ Vδ1+ IELs (Figure 4B). A similar analysis of genes encoding various cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors (Table S2) revealed that IFNG, CCL4, and IL10 were significantly overexpressed among NCR– Vδ1+ IELs from patients with CeD (Figure 4C). Transcripts encoding IL-4, IL-9, IL-13, and IL-17 were not detected. Moreover, control NCR+ Vδ1+ IELs expressed significantly more AREG, which encodes a growth factor implicated in tissue repair (Zaiss et al., 2015Zaiss D.M.W. Gause W.C. Osborne L.C. Artis D. Emerging functions of amphiregulin in orchestrating immunity, inflammation, and tissue repair.Immunity. 2015; 42: 216-226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar), relative to NCR– Vδ1+ IELs from patients with active CeD (Figure 4C). Analogous patterns were observed for other genes associated with tissue repair (Linehan et al., 2018Linehan J.L. Harrison O.J. Han S.-J. Byrd A.L. Vujkovic-Cvijin I. Villarino A.V. Sen S.K. Shaik J.

Clear differences also emerged with respect to the expression of transcription factors associated with immune function (Table S2). For example, control NCR+ Vδ1+ IELs specifically expressed GATA3 and IRF8, which have been implicated in the regulation of innate immunity (Adams et al., 2018Adams N.M. Lau C.M. Fan X. Rapp M. Geary C.D. Weizman O.-E. Diaz-Salazar C. Sun J.C.

To assess the relative impact of origin versus phenotype, we also compared NCR+ Vδ1+ IELs from healthy controls with NCR+ Vδ1+ IELs from patients with active CeD. The latter were occasionally found in younger patients (Figure S2C), but lacked expression of NKp44, in contrast to control NCR+ Vδ1+ IELs. Unbiased multidimensional scaling (MDS) analysis revealed that control NCR+ Vδ1+ IELs formed a distinct subset, whereas NCR+ and NCR– Vδ1+ IELs from patients with active CeD clustered together (Figure S2D). Accordingly, differences observed between control NCR+ Vδ1+ IELs and NCR– Vδ1+ IELs from patients with active CeD (Figure S2B) were mimicked between control NCR+ Vδ1+ IELs and NCR+ Vδ1+ IELs from patients with active CeD (Figure S2E). Transcriptional differences among Vδ1+ IELs were therefore driven by disease state rather than NCR expression, irrespective of adherence to a GFD. In line with the functional and phenotypic data, these results demonstrated that Vδ1+ IELs formed distinct subsets characterized by divergent gene expression programs in healthy controls and patients with CeD. To determine whether the switch from innate-like NCR+ Vδ1+ IELs in the healthy state to IFN-γ-producing NCR– Vδ1+ IELs in CeD was associated with cellular turnover, we used an unbiased molecular approach to characterize all expressed TRG and TRD gene rearrangements in flow-sorted Vδ1+ T cell populations isolated directly ex vivo from donor-matched PBLs and IELs (Figures S3A–S3C; Tables S3 and S4; Davey et al., 2017Davey M.S.

Unbiased molecular analysis of T cell receptor expression using template-switch anchored RT-PCR.Curr Protoc Immunol. 2011; Chapter 10 (Unit10.33)PubMed Google Scholar). Control Vδ1+ IELs almost exclusively used the TRGV4 gene, unlike donor-matched Vδ1+ PBLs (Figures 5A and 5B ; Table S5A). No such preference was observed in patients with active or GFD-treated CeD (Figures 5A and 5B; Table S5A). Accordingly, TRGV4 gene transcripts were significantly enriched among control Vδ1+ IELs relative to Vδ1+ IELs from patients with active or GFD-treated CeD (Figures 5A and 5B; Table S5A). These results were corroborated in a separate cohort via RNA-seq analysis, which also showed that TRGV gene use was not related to NCR expression (Figure S3D). Moreover, control Vδ1– IELs displayed a similarly extreme preference for the TRGV4 gene and expressed NCRs at frequencies equivalent to those observed among control Vδ1+ IELs (Figures 5C and S3E). In contrast, Vδ1– IELs from patients with CeD displayed no obvious preference for a particular TRGV gene and lacked expression of NCRs, akin to Vδ1+ IELs from patients with CeD (Figures 5C and S3E). This disease-associated loss of TRGV4 gene transcripts occurred independently of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class II alleles linked with CeD (Table S3). Of note, no TRGJ gene bias was observed among groups or tissues, reflecting widespread use of the TRGJ1 gene (Figure S3F and Table S5B). Collectively, these data suggested that TRGV4 gene rearrangements facilitated the selection of naturally occurring TCRγδ+ IELs, which were supplanted in patients with CeD.Figure 5The Vδ1+ IEL TCR Repertoire Is Permanently Reshaped in CeDShow full caption(A) Proportion of unique CDR3γ sequences using a particular TRGV gene among Vδ1+ PBLs and IELs.

Next, we sought evidence of antigen-driven clonal expansions within the remodeled Vδ1+ IEL TCR repertoires in patients with CeD. A subset of patients with active CeD harbored low-diversity repertoires, which were not apparent in patients with GFD-treated CeD (Figure S4A). These results suggested that gluten consumption stimulated the expansion of particular clonotypes in the Vδ1+ IEL pool, at least in some patients with active CeD, whereas gluten withdrawal allowed diversification, potentially via a loss of antigenic drive and/or de novo recruitment of non-expanded Vδ1+ IELs. To address this possibility, we tested for amino acid (aa) preferences among unique CDR3δ sequences, with the aim of identifying Vδ1+ TCR motifs associated with active CeD. No group-specific aa enrichments were detected to indicate a disease-associated molecular signature (Figure S4B and Table S5C). Of note, TRDJ1 gene transcripts predominated across study groups (Figure S4C). At the genetic level, preferential use of TRDD3 and, to a lesser extent, TRDD2 in the forward frame was observed across the CDR3δ dataset as a whole (Figure S4D), but there was no evidence for preferential use of a specific TRDD gene among Vδ1+ IELs from patients with active CeD (Figure S4E). These data suggested that gluten-induced reshaping of the Vδ1+ IEL repertoire was not associated with a clear CDR3δ motif. In line with this interpretation, two previously described CDR3δ motifs associated with g"

This work defines how RdDM components establish DNA methylation and enables new strategies for epigenetic gene regulation via targeted DNA methylation. Cytosine DNA methylation is a key epigenetic mark involved in the silencing of transposable elements (TEs) and genes in eukaryotes. Improving our knowledge of the pathways that trigger methylation in plants is critical, not only for understanding how methylation is established naturally, but also for creating DNA-methylation-targeting tools that can be used to establish novel epigenetic alleles of important plant genes. Plant genomes are methylated within three sequence contexts: CG, CHG, or CHH (where H is A, T, C) (Law and Jacobsen, 2010Law J.A. Jacobsen S.E. Establishing, maintaining and modifying DNA methylation patterns in plants and animals.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2010; 11: 204-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (2532) Google Scholar). Methylation establishment requires the plant-specific RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM) pathway, which can be divided into two major arms and acts via the de novo DNA methyltransferase DOMAINS REARRANGED METHYLTRANSFERASE 2 (DRM2) (Law and Jacobsen, 2010Law J.A. Jacobsen S.E. Establishing, maintaining and modifying DNA methylation patterns in plants and animals.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2010; 11: 204-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (2532) Google Scholar). In the RdDM “arm 1,” RNA polymerase IV (Pol IV) generates transcripts (P4-RNAs) that are converted into double-stranded RNAs (dsRNA) by RNA-DEPENDENT RNA POLYMERASE 2 (RDR2) and subsequently processed into 24-nt siRNAs by DICER-LIKE 3 (DCL3) (Kuo et al., 2017Kuo H.Y.

In the absence of DCL3, other DICER-LIKE proteins—DCL1, DCL2, and DCL4—can process P4-RNAs into 21-nt or 22-nt small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) that trigger de novo methylation by RdDM (Bond and Baulcombe, 2015Bond D.M.

Mutations in NRPD1, the Pol IV catalytic subunit, lead to a virtually complete loss of 24-nt siRNAs genome wide (Matzke et al., 2015Matzke M.A. Kanno T. Matzke A.J.

Jacobsen S.E. Comprehensive analysis of silencing mutants reveals complex regulation of the Arabidopsis methylome.Cell. 2013; 152: 352-364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar). Pol IV accessory proteins include the CLASSY SNF2-related putative chromatin remodeler family (CLSY) involved in global Pol IV recruitment (Zhou et al., 2018Zhou M. Palanca A.M.S. Law J.A. Locus-specific control of the de novo DNA methylation pathway in Arabidopsis by the CLASSY family.Nat. Genet. 2018; 50: 865-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), and SAWADEE HOMEODOMAIN HOMOLOG 1 (SHH1), which binds the repressive histone mark H3K9 methylation associated with DNA methylation and is required for Pol IV recruitment at a subset of RdDM sites (Law et al., 2013Law J.A. Du J. Hale C.J. Feng S. Krajewski K. Palanca A.M. Strahl B.D. Patel D.J. Jacobsen S.E. Polymerase IV occupancy at RNA-directed DNA methylation sites requires SHH1.Nature. 2013; 498: 385-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). siRNAs for RdDM can be alternatively generated from other RNAs, like viral or Pol-II dependent, in “non-canonical RdDM” (Cuerda-Gil and Slotkin, 2016Cuerda-Gil D. Slotkin R.K. Non-canonical RNA-directed DNA methylation.Nat. Plants. 2016; 2: 16163Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). These RNAs can be processed into dsRNAs by RDR1 and RDR6 and subsequently cleaved into siRNAs by different DCL proteins (Cuerda-Gil and Slotkin, 2016Cuerda-Gil D. Slotkin R.K. Non-canonical RNA-directed DNA methylation.Nat. Plants. 2016; 2: 16163Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Subsequently, siRNAs are loaded into ARGONAUTE 4 (AGO4) or its homologs, AGO6 and AGO9 (Matzke et al., 2015Matzke M.A. Kanno T. Matzke A.J. RNA-Directed DNA Methylation: The Evolution of a Complex Epigenetic Pathway in Flowering Plants.Annu. Rev. Plant Biol. 2015; 66: 243-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). In the RdDM arm 2, RNA Pol V, together with a number of accessory proteins, generates longer non-coding RNAs at target loci (Böhmdorfer et al., 2016Böhmdorfer G. Sethuraman S. Rowley M.J.

Other factors implicated in RdDM include the microrchidia (MORC) ATPases, MORC1 and MORC6, that act as heterodimers to mediate gene silencing (Matzke et al., 2015Matzke M.A. Kanno T. Matzke A.J.

Unlike RdDM mutants, morc mutants show reactivation of many methylated regions without a corresponding DNA-methylation loss and thus appear to act downstream of DNA methylation at most loci. However, morc mutants do show a loss of DNA methylation at a small subset of RdDM loci that are also transcriptionally derepressed in morc mutants (Harris et al., 2016Harris C.J. Husmann D. Liu W.

In addition, physical interactions between MORC1 and MORC6 with the RdDM proteins SUVH2, SUVH9, IDN2, and DMS3 have been reported (Jing et al., 2016Jing Y. Sun H. Yuan W. Wang Y. Li Q. Liu Y. Li Y.

Cell. 2000; 6: 791-802Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar) is normally repressed by promoter DNA methylation in wild-type plants. Loss of FWA methylation creates heritable fwa epialleles showing ectopic FWA expression and a late flowering phenotype (Soppe et al., 2000Soppe W.J. Jacobsen S.E. Alonso-Blanco C. Jackson J.P. Kakutani T. Koornneef M. Peeters A.J. The late flowering phenotype of fwa mutants is caused by gain-of-function epigenetic alleles of a homeodomain gene.Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 791-802Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). We previously showed that tethering the RdDM component SUVH9 to an artificial zinc finger (ZF) that targets the FWA promoter can reintroduce heritable DNA methylation, restoring FWA repression and early flowering (Johnson et al., 2014Johnson L.M. Du J. Hale C.J. Bischof S. Feng S. Chodavarapu R.K. Zhong X. Marson G. Pellegrini M. Segal D.J. et al.SRA- and SET-domain-containing proteins link RNA polymerase V occupancy to DNA methylation.Nature. 2014; 507: 124-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Here, we show that ZF fusions with many other RdDM components can also promote DNA methylation at FWA, as well as at thousands of additional loci targeted by this ZF. Importantly, Pol IV and Pol V co-targeting synergistically enhanced targeted methylation, revealing that siRNA biogenesis and recruitment of the DNA-methylation machinery are largely independent and both important for efficient methylation targeting. We also utilized ZF-RdDM fusions to dissect the hierarchy of action of RdDM components, providing unprecedented mechanistic insight into de novo DNA methylation. These findings provide a framework for the study and manipulation of DNA-methylation patterns in plants. We utilized the targeting approach previously described in Johnson et al., 2014Johnson L.M.

When transformed into the unmethylated fwa background, 9 different fusion proteins restored an early-flowering phenotype indicative of DNA methylation and silencing of FWA in T1 plants. These included components of the first (NRPD1, RDR2, and SHH1; Figures S1B, S1G, and S1H) and second (DMS3, RDM1, and SUVH9; Figures S2A, S3A, and S3B) arms of the RdDM pathway, MORC6 and MORC1 (Figures S3C and S3D) and the catalytic domain of the tobacco DRM2 methyltransferase (DRMcd) (Figure S3F).Figure S3RDM-1, SUVH9-, and MORC-Mediated Targeted Methylation, Related Figure 3Show full captionFlowering time of Col-0 and fwa untransformed plants as well as T1 plants of (A) RDM1-ZF, (B) ZF-SUVH9, (C) MORC6-ZF and (D) MORC1-ZF in different mutant backgrounds introgressed into fwa mutant.(E) Flowering time of 4 representative ZF-DRMcd T2 lines in different mutant backgrounds. wt corresponds to single fwa mutant and the rest of named mutants are in fwa background.

Combining ZF-RdDM fusions with RdDM mutations offered a unique approach to interrogate the hierarchy of action of RdDM proteins in de novo DNA methylation. Thus, we transformed ZF-RdDM fusion constructs into RdDM mutants that had been introgressed into the fwa background and scored flowering time of T1 populations (Figures S1, S2, and S3). We also confirmed flowering phenotypes in T2 plants descended from the four earliest T1 plants (Figures 1A, 1D, 1E, 2A , 3A, 3C, 3D, 3 E, and S3E) and confirmed FWA methylation in representative T2 lines for all fusions that triggered early flowering (Figures 1B, 2B, 3B, and S3G). We also confirmed the lack of methylation in backgrounds where the representative fusions of the first arm (NRPD1-ZF), the second arm (DMS3-ZF), and ZF-DRMcd (Figures 1B, 2B, and S3G) did not induce early flowering.Figure 2DMS3 Targeted MethylationShow full caption(A) Flowering time of control lines and four representative DMS3-ZF T2 lines in wild-type or different mutants that had been introgressed into the fwa background.(B) CG, CHG, and CHH DNA-methylation levels over the FWA promoter measured by BS-PCR-seq in representative DMS3-ZF T2 lines in wild-type or different mutants introgressed into fwa.

SHH1 loss did not block targeted methylation and silencing, consistent with SHH1 acting upstream of Pol IV recruitment (Law et al., 2013Law J.A. Du J. Hale C.J. Feng S. Krajewski K. Palanca A.M. Strahl B.D. Patel D.J. Jacobsen S.E. Polymerase IV occupancy at RNA-directed DNA methylation sites requires SHH1.Nature. 2013; 498: 385-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar) (Figure 1A, 1B, and S1B). Similar results were obtained in the clsy1 mutant background (Figures 1A, 1B, and S1B), indicating that this chromatin remodeling protein is dispensable when Pol IV is artificially targeted to chromatin. However, NRPD1-ZF failed to trigger methylation in the rdr2 mutant, consistent with previous observations that RDR2 is needed for P4-RNA production (Blevins et al., 2015Blevins T. Podicheti R.

NRPD1-ZF induced FWA methylation in dcl3, as well as in dcl2 dcl4, indicating that different DCLs can process P4-RNAs into siRNAs for methylation targeting (Figures 1A, 1B, and S1B). This is consistent with the observation that DCL2 and DCL4 can produce 21- to 22-nt siRNAs in non-canonical Pol II-RDR6 RdDM (Cuerda-Gil and Slotkin, 2016Cuerda-Gil D. Slotkin R.K. Non-canonical RNA-directed DNA methylation.Nat. Plants. 2016; 2: 16163Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Moreover, NRPD1-ZF triggered FWA methylation in dcl2 dcl3 dcl4 triple-mutant plants (Figure 1B). However, contrary to all other mutant backgrounds, we only observed early-flowering plants in the T2, not the T1 generation (Figures 1A and S1B), indicating that methylation targeting was less efficient compared to single or double dcl mutants. A similar observation was reported using VIGS to target methylation to FWA (Bond and Baulcombe, 2015Bond D.M. Baulcombe D.C. Epigenetic transitions leading to heritable, RNA-mediated de novo silencing in Arabidopsis thaliana.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2015; 112: 917-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). To analyze siRNA biogenesis in different DCL mutant backgrounds containing NRPD1-ZF, we performed small RNA sequencing (sRNA-seq) in T2 lines. We did not detect FWA siRNAs in the unmethylated fwa epiallele, and NRPD1-ZF triggered the production of mostly 24-nt siRNAs and some 21-nt and 22-nt siRNAs (Figures 1C and S1C). As expected, dcl3 mainly reduced 24-nt FWA siRNAs (Figures 1C and S1C). The dcl3 and especially the dcl2 dcl3 dcl4 mutants also accumulated longer sRNAs (up to 36 nt) (Figure S1D), likely corresponding to unprocessed P4-RNAs (Kuo et al., 2017Kuo H.Y. Jacobsen E.L. Long Y. Chen X. Zhai J. Characteristics and processing of Pol IV-dependent transcripts in Arabidopsis.J. Genet. Genomics. 2017; 44: 3-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), and likely accounting for some of the 21- to 24-nt signal remaining in these mutants (Figure 1C). Although we were unable to test the contribution of DCL1 due to lethality of dcl1 null mutants, the biogenesis of the remaining sRNAs in dcl2 dcl3 dcl4 is likely the consequence of DCL1 activity or due to DCL-independent activities (Kuo et al., 2017Kuo H.Y. Jacobsen E.L. Long Y. Chen X. Zhai J. Characteristics and processing of Pol IV-dependent transcripts in Arabidopsis.J. Genet. Genomics. 2017; 44: 3-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). NRPD1-ZF triggered early flowering and methylation in ago4 and ago6 ago9 mutants (Figures 1A, 1B, and S1B), suggesting that these AGOs are functionally redundant in mediating FWA methylation. However, NRPD1-ZF did not trigger methylation in ago4 ago6 ago9, highlighting the importance of these three AGOs for targeted de novo methylation (Figures 1A, 1B, and S1B). Similarly, NRPD1-ZF failed to trigger methylation in the Pol V mutant nrpe1 or in drm1 drm2 double mutants (DRM1 is a lowly expressed DRM2 homolog), consistent with a requirement for these RdDM components downstream of siRNA biogenesis (Figures 1A, 1B, and S1B). Lastly, a CHROMOMETHYLASE 3 (CMT3) mutant did not block targeted FWA methylation (Figures 1A, 1B, and S1B). Targeted methylation with ZF-SUVH9 (which recruits Pol V) was previously shown to be heritable after segregating away the ZF-SUVH9 transgene (Johnson et al., 2014Johnson L.M. Du J. Hale C.J. Bischof S. Feng S. Chodavarapu R.K. Zhong X. Marson G. Pellegrini M. Segal D.J. et al.SRA- and SET-domain-containing proteins link RNA polymerase V occupancy to DNA methylation.Nature. 2014; 507: 124-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). We found that methylation targeted by NRPD1 was also heritable, since plants that had segregated away the NRPD1-ZF transgene were early flowering and showed FWA methylation similar to plants that carried the transgene (Figures S1E and S1F). RDR2-ZF induced DNA methylation and silencing of FWA, with a methylation pattern similar to that of NRPD1-ZF (Figures 1B, 1D, and S1G). However, RDR2-ZF failed to trigger early flowering in nrpd1 (Figures 1D and S1G), consistent with the strong association of RDR2 with the Pol IV complex and its role in converting P4-RNAs into dsRNA. RDR2-ZF behaved similarly to NRPD1-ZF in all other tested mutant backgrounds, except for its ability to induce FWA silencing in the rdr2 mutant, as predicted (Figures 1B, 1D, and S1G). SHH1-ZF triggered FWA silencing and methylation (Figures 1B, 1E, and S1H). As expected for a Pol IV recruitment factor, SHH1-ZF could not induce FWA silencing in nrpd1 or rdr2 mutants or in nrpe1 and drm1 drm2 mutants (Figures 1E and S1H). Interestingly, SHH1 could induce FWA methylation in clsy1, suggesting that SHH1 can act independently of"

Remarkably, their strong attraction to humans is suppressed for days after the blood meal by an unknown mechanism. We investigated a role for neuropeptide Y (NPY)-related signaling in long-term behavioral suppression and discovered that drugs targeting human NPY receptors modulate mosquito host-seeking. In a screen of all 49 predicted Ae. aegypti peptide receptors, we identified NPY-like receptor 7 (NPYLR7) as the sole target of these drugs. To obtain small-molecule agonists selective for NPYLR7, we performed a high-throughput cell-based assay of 265,211 compounds and isolated six highly selective NPYLR7 agonists that inhibit mosquito attraction to humans. NPYLR7 CRISPR-Cas9 null mutants are defective in behavioral suppression and resistant to these drugs. Finally, we show that these drugs can inhibit biting and blood-feeding on a live host, suggesting a novel approach to control infectious disease transmission by controlling mosquito behavior.Video AbstracteyJraWQiOiI4ZjUxYWNhY2IzYjhiNjNlNzFlYmIzYWFmYTU5NmZmYyIsImFsZyI6IlJTMjU2In0.eyJzdWIiOiJjZGQ0ODkyMTY5YWZhZDcyOWFjMGM2NzZkNTQyZGE1YyIsImtpZCI6IjhmNTFhY2FjYjNiOGI2M2U3MWViYjNhYWZhNTk2ZmZjIiwiZXhwIjoxNjc4NTU0NzMyfQ.IWqIlOv-k_s5VeH8vGctMuo6d2wnVQraplkJ0BqNeSWpc9I1CuK41HdQ7D0Y6zjDHGcYmCbA6N0lcR7GhcwcYlJktBF9CHD5koGyOMgn6PpFoexqUY5L9_rheIMShGWZjfq-W2eu99JcPhHcNOXLQ3nI54um-tcAKtPkF34pXJyOtVpX82kWquECPon_feVDg7YME6Znl4oyzekjKhsJzRBOO9-7XghUE78QjO2glylQt-WovwhdjdTuq8lpd2U5XEezFwsr68oTZaENO_q4uDjfzWNPOlJwE84dhLxMJYbGEIoehrmIgjzRsefINHApB-S0Y68C00Y3CXXoaHvtUw(mp4, (16.2 MB) Download video"
https://openalex.org/W2792895533,"Pollen grains are known for their impressive variety of species-specific, microscale surface patterning. Despite having similar biological developmental steps, pollen grain surface features are remarkably geometrically varied. Previous work suggests that a physical process may drive this pattern formation and that the observed diversity of patterns can be explained by viewing pollen pattern development as a phase transition to a spatially modulated phase. Several studies have shown that the polysaccharide material of plant cell walls undergoes phase separation in the absence of cross-linking stabilizers of the mixed phase. Here we show experimental evidence of a change in density of the extracellular polysaccharide material (primexine) during pollen cell development leads to a spatially modulated phase. The spatial pattern of this phase-separated primexine is also mechanically coupled to the undulation of the pollen cell membrane. The resulting patterned pools of denser primexine form the negative template of the ultimate sites of sporopollenin deposition, leading to the final micropattern observed in the mature pollen. We then present a general physical model of pattern formation via modulated phases. Using analytical and numerical techniques, we find that most of the pollen micropatterns observed in biological evolution could result from a physical process of modulated phases. However, an analysis of the relative rates of transitions from states that are equilibrated to or from states that are not equilibrated suggests that while equilibrium states of this process have occurred throughout evolutionary history, there has been no particular evolutionary selection for distinctly patterned equilibrated states."
https://openalex.org/W2912024414,"Using end-to-end models for ecosystem-based management requires knowledge of the structure, uncertainty and sensitivity of the model. The Norwegian and Barents Seas (NoBa) Atlantis model was implemented for use in 'what if' scenarios, combining fisheries management strategies with the influences of climate change and climate variability. Before being used for this purpose, we wanted to evaluate and identify sensitive parameters and whether the species position in the foodweb influenced their sensitivity to parameter perturbation. Perturbing recruitment, mortality, prey consumption and growth by +/- 25% for nine biomass-dominating key species in the Barents Sea, while keeping the physical climate constant, proved the growth rate to be the most sensitive parameter in the model. Their trophic position in the ecosystem (lower trophic level, mid trophic level, top predators) influenced their responses to the perturbations. Top-predators, being generalists, responded mostly to perturbations on their individual life-history parameters. Mid-level species were the most vulnerable to perturbations, not only to their own individual life-history parameters, but also to perturbations on other trophic levels (higher or lower). Perturbations on the lower trophic levels had by far the strongest impact on the system, resulting in biomass changes for nearly all components in the system. Combined perturbations often resulted in non-additive model responses, including both dampened effects and increased impact of combined perturbations. Identifying sensitive parameters and species in end-to-end models will not only provide insights about the structure and functioning of the ecosystem in the model, but also highlight areas where more information and research would be useful-both for model parameterization, but also for constraining or quantifying model uncertainty."

Here, using siRNA-mediated gene silencing and various human cells, we report that UNC45A is essential for breast cancer cell growth, but is dispensable for normal cell proliferation. Immunofluorescence microscopy, along with gene microarray and RT-quantitative PCR analyses, revealed that UNC45A localizes to the cancer cell nucleus, where it up-regulates the transcriptional activity of the glucocorticoid receptor and thereby promotes expression of the mitotic kinase NIMA-related kinase 7 (NEK7). We observed that UNC45A-deficient cancer cells exhibit extensive pericentrosomal material disorganization, as well as defects in centrosomal separation and mitotic chromosome alignment. Consequently, these cells stalled in metaphase and cytokinesis and ultimately underwent mitotic catastrophe, phenotypes that were rescued by heterologous NEK7 expression.

The molecular mechanisms underlying the function and localization of UNC45A in cancer cells, however, has not been well studied. Here, we report that UNC45A is largely dispensable for the proliferation of immortalized, nontransformed mammary cell lines, but is essential for breast cancer cell proliferation in vitro and in vivo. In cancer cells, UNC45A localizes to the cell nucleus, where it promotes glucocorticoid receptor (GR) transcription of the mitotic kinase gene NEK7. Previous research established that NEK7 is required for cell cycle progression because of its ability to regulate aspects of mitotic spindle formation and cytokinesis (22Yissachar N. Salem H.

Cancer cells lacking UNC45A expression exhibit a strikingly similar phenotype to NEK7 knockout cells, suggesting that UNC45A control of the cell cycle in cancer cells is mediated by NEK7 signaling. We investigated the role of UNC45A in the proliferation of breast cancer cell lines in vitro. Microscopic analysis indicates that silencing UNC45A using siRNA causes cell proliferation arrest and ultimately cell death in Hs578T cells (Fig. 1, A and B). In contrast, loss of UNC45A expression had no noticeable effect on the shape or proliferation of Hs578Bst cells; these results were confirmed using an MTT cell proliferation assay. Fig. 1C shows that silencing UNC45A did not affect the proliferation of any nontransformed cell line tested, including the Hs578Bst, HME, and MCF-10A mammary epithelial lines. In contrast, loss of UNC45A significantly reduced the proliferation of all transformed cell lines tested, including Hs578T and MDA-MB-231 (both triple negative), (MCF-7 (ER/PR-positive), and the metastatic ZR-75-1, further supporting the concept that UNC45A expression may be required for the growth of various breast cancer subtypes. To investigate the specific role of UNC45A in cancer cell proliferation in vivo, we used the non-obese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficiency (NOD-SCID) mouse model (Fig. 1, E–G), surgically implanted with 105 MDA-MB-231 cells stably harboring lentivirus-based doxycycline-inducible UNC45A shRNA (or nontargeting shRNA control) into the mammary fat pads. Two days later, mice were fed doxycycline-containing food for 6 weeks. UNC45A was efficiently silenced in tumors harboring UNC45A versus control shRNA (Fig. 1G). Loss of UNC45A expression inhibited tumor growth, as illustrated by ex vivo images of tumors in control versus knockdown animals (Fig. 1E, left and right panels, respectively), as well as by the average tumor weights (Fig. 1F). Together, these findings demonstrate that UNC45A is essential for cancer cell proliferation in vitro and in vivo. To better understand how UNC45A might regulate cancer cell proliferation, we performed microarray analysis using mRNAs from Hs578T cells treated with either UNC45A siRNA or control nontargeting siRNA. As predicted, UNC45A mRNA was significantly reduced in UNC45A siRNA-treated Hs578T cells, which correlated with changes in the expression of 121 other genes, of which 62 exhibit at least a 1.64-fold or greater change (Fig. 2A, Table S1). Ingenuity Pathway Analysis indicates that these differentially expressed genes are involved in different pathologies, including: cancer, endocrine disorders, and inflammatory and cardiovascular diseases (Fig. 2B). Further analysis indicated that these genes are also connected to molecular networks involved in: cell-to-cell signaling and proliferation, cellular movement, molecular transport, and lipid metabolism (Fig. 2C). Some of the genes identified are also associated with control of cell cycle, cell morphology, multicellular organization, and development of the nervous system and its function (Fig. S1A). Based on its relevance to cell division, we noted that loss of UNC45A was associated with a 2-fold decrease in the mRNA encoding the mitotic kinase NEK7 (Fig. 2A, Table S1). Loss of NEK7 was validated by RT-qPCR and immunoblot analyses of a panel of cancer-derived cell lines. Silencing UNC45A drastically reduced mRNA and protein expression of NEK7 in Hsp578T, MDA-MB-453, MCF-7, and T47D breast cancer cells (Fig. 2D). Loss of NEK7 was also observed in HeLa cells and MDA-MB-231 (Fig. S1, C and E). Remarkably, whereas loss of UNC45A in nontransformed, immortalized breast epithelial cells (Hs578Bst and HME) significantly reduced NEK7 mRNA expression, this resulted in only a 50–70% decrease in NEK7 protein expression (Fig. 2D), suggesting that in normal cells, NEK7 expression is not totally dependent on UNC45A, whereas in cancer cells, UNC45A appears to be required for NEK7 expression. Indeed, the remaining NEK7 protein (30–50%) observed in normal cells might contribute to the relative insensitivity of these cells to the requirement of UNC45A for cell proliferation that we observed in cancer cells (Fig. 1C). Although NEK7 is one of 11 NEK family members (29Fry A.M. O'Regan L. Sabir S.R. Bayliss R. Cell cycle regulation by the NEK family of protein kinases.J. Cell Sci. 2012; 125 (23132929): 4423-443310.1242/jcs.111195Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar), our microarray data showed that only NEK7 expression is altered when UNC45A is silenced (Fig. 2A, Table S1). Loss of UNC45A did not significantly affect the transcription of other key components of the NEK signaling axis. This was validated by RT-qPCR showing that silencing UNC45A did not alter NEK6 mRNA levels in Hs578T, MCF-7, or MDA-MB-453 cells (Fig. 3A). Similarly, NEK9 patterns of expression were unchanged after UNC45A silencing in both MCF-7 and MDA-MB-453 cells. In Hs578T cells, however, loss of UNC45A significantly increased NEK9 mRNA expression, but it did not alter NEK9 protein expression (Fig. 3B). Similar results were obtained when HeLa cells were used (Fig. 3B). We next examined the impact of UNC45A loss on NEK7 signaling. We tested whether loss of UNC45A alters the phosphorylation/activation of the mitotic kinesin Eg5, an established downstream target of NEK6 and NEK7. Eg5 is a member of molecular motor proteins that play essential roles in mitosis through regulation of spindle assembly and function. Eg5 contributes to the establishment and balance of forces in the mitotic spindles and drives the sliding of microtubules (30Kapitein L.C. Peterman E.J. Kwok B.H. Kim J.H. Kapoor T.M. Schmidt C.F. The bipolar mitotic kinesin Eg5 moves on both microtubules that it crosslinks.Nature. 2005; 435 (15875026): 114-11810.1038/nature03503Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar, 31Ferenz N.P.

NEK6/7 phosphorylation of Eg5 at Ser-1033 is essential for Eg5 accumulation at the centrosomes, which is necessary for centrosomal separation and normal mitotic spindle formation (27Bertran M.T. Sdelci S. Regué L. Avruch J. Caelles C. Roig J. Nek9 is a Plk1-activated kinase that controls early centrosome separation through Nek6/7 and Eg5.EMBO J. 2011; 30 (21642957): 2634-264710.1038/emboj.2011.179Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 32Sdelci S.

As expected, UNC45A deletion drastically reduced NEK7 protein expression in Hs578T and HeLa cells (Fig. 3B). Accordingly, we also observed a drastic loss of phosphorylation as determined by the only available phosphospecific antibody recognizing active forms of both NEK7 and -6 (Fig. 3B). The loss of NEK7 translates into a significant decrease in phosphorylation of Eg5 at Ser-1033, previously shown to be the target site of NEK6/7 kinases (27Bertran M.T. Sdelci S. Regué L. Avruch J. Caelles C. Roig J. Nek9 is a Plk1-activated kinase that controls early centrosome separation through Nek6/7 and Eg5.EMBO J. 2011; 30 (21642957): 2634-264710.1038/emboj.2011.179Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that UNC45A's function lies upstream of NEK7 and the signaling pathway controlling Eg5. Supporting this conclusion, knocking down NEK7 in Hs578T and HeLa cells did not affect UNC45A protein levels (Fig. S2A), and had no noticeable decrease in total Eg5 or NEK9 protein levels (Fig. 3C). To test the hypothesis that NEK7 might play a key role in UNC45A function during cell proliferation, we assessed whether expression of heterologous NEK7 could rescue the growth of cancer cells lacking UNC45A. pcDNA3 vector expressing mouse HA-tagged NEK7 (HA-mNEK7) was transfected into HeLa and MDA-MB-23 cells harboring doxycycline-inducible UNC45A shRNA. We initially treated cells with doxycycline for 5 days to completely silence endogenous UNC45A expression before transfecting them with the heterologous HA-mNEK7 construct. As shown in Fig. S1, B–E), transient expression of HA-mNEK7 in HeLa and MDA-MB-231 cells treated with doxycycline resulted in a significant rescue of cell proliferative capacity. In fact, when heterologous HA-mNEK7 is introduced earlier (48 h), before complete loss of UNC45A and NEK7 has occurred, cell proliferation capacity is even further enhanced (Fig. 3, D–G). These results strongly suggest that NEK7 is a major mediator of the cancer cell proliferation defect we observed in UNC45A-silenced cells. Because silencing UNC45A results in a significant decrease in NEK7 mRNA and protein levels selectively in cancer cells, as well as reduced phosphorylation of NEK7’s downstream target Eg5 in cancer cells, we reasoned that lack of UNC45A might lead to centrosomal separation defects and mitotic abnormalities, two phenotypes previously associated with NEK7 deletion in various cell lines (22Yissachar N. Salem H. Tennenbaum T. Motro B.

To test this hypothesis, we used a pericentrin antibody and immunofluorescence microscopy to examine the number and pattern of centrosomes in cells lacking UNC45A expression. As illustrated in Fig. 4A (lower panels), loss of UNC45A expression results in centrosome amplification (cells with more than 2 centrosomes), as well as defects in centrosome separation in Hs578T cells compared with control cells (Fig. 4A, upper panels). The overall average distance between centrosomes is significantly smaller in Hs578T, MCF-7, and HeLa cells lacking UNC45A (Fig. 4B). In contrast, centrosome number and separation in the nontransformed Hs578Bst cells is not significantly affected (Fig. 4B), consistent with the hypothesis that “residual” NEK7 expression in UNC45A-silenced normal cells might be protective (Fig. 1C). Further immunofluorescence analysis showed a strikingly disorganized pattern of pericentrosomal material in Hs578T cells lacking UNC45A compared with control cells (Fig. 4, C–E). The observed centrosomal abnormalities in UNC45A-deficient cancer cells correlated with loss of mitotic activity and an accumulation of polynucleated cells (Fig. 4C). As expected, silencing NEK7 in Hs578T (Fig. S2B) also induced accumulation of polynucleated cells (Fig. S2C, white arrowheads, and D) with micronuclei (Fig. S2C, red arrowheads). Further analysis showed that loss of NEK7 caused a drastic disorganization of centrosomal material in Hs578T cells (Fig. S2, E and F). Importantly, the abnormal centrosome phenotype induced by loss of UNC45A was significantly rescued when exogenous HA-mNEK7 was overexpressed in Hs578T cells lacking UNC45A (Fig. 4, F and G, and Fig. S3). Together, these findings suggest that UNC45A is essential for normal centrosome homeostasis, and provide further support for the notion that these functions are mediated by NEK7, a known centrosome regulator, in cancer cells. Similar results were obtained when HeLa cells were used. Indeed, loss of UNC45A causes drastic centrosomal abnormalities in HeLa cells leading to accumulation of multinucleated cells (Fig. 5, A–C). Additional insight into the specific role that UNC45A might play during cell division was obtained by time-lapse microscopy using HeLa cells expressing the fusion protein histone H2B-GFP (33Kanda T. Sullivan K.F. Wahl G.M. Histone-GFP fusion protein enables sensitive analysis of chromosome dynamics in living mammalian cells.Curr. Biol. 1998; 8 (9545195): 377-38510.1016/S0960-9822(98)70156-3Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (781) Google Scholar). HeLa cells were transiently transfected with UNC45A siRNA (or nontargeting siRNA control), followed by time-lapse fluorescence microscopy after 72 h post-transfection (Movies S1 and S2). Cells treated with control siRNA progress to anaphase within 20–30 min of initiating metaphase, completing mitosis within 60–90 min (Movie S1, Fig. 5D, upper panel, and E, Fig. S4). In contrast, cells lacking UNC45A are delayed in mitosis and form multinucleated cells, which frequently undergo apoptosis (Movie S2, Fig. 5D, middle panels, and E, Fig. S4). During this aberrant, prolonged metaphase (∼120 min), chromosomes failed to align (Fig. 5D, middle panels, 30–165 min). In some cases, cells were unable to enter anaphase and instead retrogress to form an early metaphase-like state trying unsuccessfully to align their chromosomes. Ultimately, a few chromosomes remained lagging (Fig. 5D, middle panel, 105–165 min) and formed extra micronuclei (Fig"

https://openalex.org/W2914517965,"Objective To estimate the effect of inadequate maternal weight gain in the third trimester on the risk of intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) in rural Bangladesh. Methods This study analyzed data from 1,463 mother-infant pairs in Matlab, Bangladesh which were available through the electronic databases of Matlab Health and Demographic Surveillance System and Matlab hospital of the International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh (icddr,b). All the mothers were admitted to Matlab hospital for childbirth from January 2012 to December 2014, and they had singleton live births at term. Third-trimester weight gain (kg) was calculated by subtracting the estimated weight at the end of the second trimester from the weight taken before childbirth. Inadequate third-trimester weight gain was defined as 4 kg or less irrespective of pre-gravid nutritional status. IUGR was defined as a birth weight below 2500 g in full-term newborns (LBW-Term), and a birth weight for gestational age and infant sex less than the 10th percentile (SGA-10th) and 2 standard deviations below the mean birth weight (SGA-2SD) based on the international newborn standards from the INTERGROWTH-21st project. Multivariable logistic regression models were fitted to determine the independent effect of inadequate weight gain in the third trimester on the risk of IUGR. Results A total of 824 (56.3%) women experienced inadequate weight gain in the third trimester of pregnancy. In this study, 215 (14.7%), 573 (39.2%) and 220 (15.0%) infants were born as LBW-Term, SGA-10th and SGA-2SD, respectively. In the multivariable logistic regression models, compared to adequate weight gain in the third-trimester, the odds ratios (OR) for LBW-Term, SGA-10th and SGA-2SD for inadequate weight gain were 1.8 (95% CI: 1.3, 2.5; p < 0.001), 1.4 (95% CI: 1.1, 1.8; p = 0.002) and 1.8 (95% CI: 1.3, 2.4; p = 0.001), respectively. Conclusions Both inadequate third-trimester weight gain and IUGR are prevailing public health concerns in rural Bangladesh. Inadequate weight gain in the third trimester substantially increased the risk of IUGR. Public health programs focusing on the promotion of adequate weight gain in the third trimester of pregnancy with an ultimate aim to decrease IUGR should be implemented."
https://openalex.org/W2912488437,"Background Psoriasis is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) at younger ages that is not identifiable by traditional risk factors. Screening for subclinical atherosclerosis with ultrasound has only been investigated in carotid arteries. Femoral artery ultrasound has never been considered for this purpose. The link between psoriasis and accelerated atherosclerosis has not yet been established. Objective To study the usefulness of femoral artery ultrasound for the detection of subclinical atherosclerosis in psoriasis. We also investigated its possible relationship with changes in insulin resistance. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional study in 140 participants, 70 patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis and 70 healthy controls, matched 1:1 for age, sex, and BMI. Femoral and carotid atherosclerotic plaques were evaluated by ultrasonography. Insulin resistance was assessed by the homeostasis model assessment method (HOMA-IR). Results Femoral atherosclerotic plaque prevalence was significantly higher in patients with psoriasis (44.64%) than in controls (19.07%) (p<0.005), but no significant difference was found in carotid plaque prevalence (p<0.3). Femoral plaques were significantly more prevalent than carotid plaques (21.42%) among patients with psoriasis (p<0.001). In the regression analysis, insulin resistance was the most influential determinant of atherosclerosis in psoriasis and C-reactive protein the most significant predictor of insulin resistance. Conclusions Ultrasound screening for femoral atherosclerotic plaques improves the detection of subclinical atherosclerosis in patients with psoriasis, whereas the study of carotid arteries is not sufficiently accurate. Insulin resistance appears to play a greater role in the development of atherosclerosis in these patients in comparison to other classical CVD risk factors."
https://openalex.org/W2913155528,"Neurons can maintain stable synaptic connections across adult life. However, the signals that regulate expression of synaptic proteins in the mature brain are incompletely understood. Here, we describe a transcriptional feedback loop between the biosynthesis and repertoire of specific phospholipids and the synaptic vesicle pool in adult Drosophila photoreceptors. Mutations that disrupt biosynthesis of a subset of phospholipids cause degeneration of the axon terminal and loss of synaptic vesicles. Although degeneration of the axon terminal is dependent on neural activity, activation of sterol regulatory element binding protein (SREBP) is both necessary and sufficient to cause synaptic vesicle loss. Our studies demonstrate that SREBP regulates synaptic vesicle levels by interacting with tetraspanins, critical organizers of membranous organelles. SREBP is an evolutionarily conserved regulator of lipid biosynthesis in non-neuronal cells; our studies reveal a surprising role for this feedback loop in maintaining synaptic vesicle pools in the adult brain."
https://openalex.org/W2914938653,"Objective The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of Neisseria meningitidis, Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, group A Streptococcus (GAS), and Staphylococcus aureus in asymptomatic elderly people and to unravel risk factors leading to colonization. Methods A multi-centre cross-sectional study was conducted including 677 asymptomatic adults aged 65 years or more, living at home or in nursing homes. Study areas were Greater Aachen (North-Rhine-Westphalia) and Wuerzburg (Bavaria), both regions with medium to high population density. Nasal and oropharyngeal swabs as well as questionnaires were collected from October 2012 to May 2013. Statistical analysis included multiple logistic regression models. Results The carriage rate was 1.9% ([95%CI: 1.0–3.3%]; 13/677) for H. influenzae, 0.3% ([95%CI: 0–1.1%]; 2/677) for N. meningitidis and 0% ([95% CI: 0–0.5%]; 0/677) for S. pneumoniae and GAS. Staphylococcus aureus was harboured by 28.5% of the individuals ([95% CI: 25.1–32.1%]; 193/677) and 0.7% ([95% CI: 0.2–1.7%]; 5/677) were positive for methicillin-resistant S. aureus. Among elderly community-dwellers colonization with S. aureus was significantly associated with higher educational level (adjusted OR: 1.905 [95% CI: 1.248–2.908]; p = 0.003). Among nursing home residents colonization was associated with being married (adjusted OR: 3.367 [1.502–7.546]; p = 0.003). Conclusion The prevalence of N. meningitidis, H. influenzae, S. pneumoniae and GAS was low among older people in Germany. The S. aureus rate was expectedly high, while MRSA was found in less than 1% of the individuals."
https://openalex.org/W2951064353,"Kinetic simulation is a useful approach for elucidating complex cell-signaling systems. The numerical simulations required for kinetic modeling in live cells critically require parameters such as protein concentrations and dissociation constants (Kd ). However, only a limited number of parameters have been measured experimentally in living cells. Here we describe an approach for quantifying the concentration and Kd of endogenous proteins at the single-cell level with CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knock-in and fluorescence cross-correlation spectroscopy. First, the mEGFP gene was knocked in at the end of the mitogen-activated protein kinase 1 (MAPK1) gene, encoding extracellular signal-regulated kinase 2 (ERK2), through homology-directed repair or microhomology-mediated end joining. Next, the HaloTag gene was knocked in at the end of the ribosomal S6 kinase 2 (RSK2) gene. We then used fluorescence correlation spectroscopy to measure the protein concentrations of endogenous ERK2-mEGFP and RSK2-HaloTag fusion constructs in living cells, revealing substantial heterogeneities. Moreover, fluorescence cross-correlation spectroscopy analyses revealed temporal changes in the apparent Kd values of the binding between ERK2-mEGFP and RSK2-HaloTag in response to epidermal growth factor stimulation. Our approach presented here provides a robust and efficient method for quantifying endogenous protein concentrations and dissociation constants in living cells."
https://openalex.org/W2914924793,"During preimplantation mouse development stages, emerging pluripotent epiblast (Epi) and extraembryonic primitive endoderm (PrE) cells are first distributed in the blastocyst in a “salt-and-pepper” manner before they segregate into separate layers. As a result of segregation, PrE cells become localised on the surface of the inner cell mass (ICM), and the Epi is enclosed by the PrE on one side and by the trophectoderm on the other. During later development, a subpopulation of PrE cells migrates away from the ICM and forms the parietal endoderm (PE), while cells remaining in contact with the Epi form the visceral endoderm (VE). Here, we asked: what are the mechanisms mediating Epi and PrE cell segregation and the subsequent VE vs PE specification? Differences in cell adhesion have been proposed; however, we demonstrate that the levels of plasma membrane-bound E-cadherin (CDH1, cadherin 1) in Epi and PrE cells only differ after the segregation of these lineages within the ICM. Moreover, manipulating E-cadherin levels did not affect lineage specification or segregation, thus failing to confirm its role during these processes. Rather, we report changes in E-cadherin localisation during later PrE-to-PE transition which are accompanied by the presence of Vimentin and Twist, supporting the hypothesis that an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition process occurs in the mouse peri-implantation blastocyst."

Pathogen detection microarrays have been used to diagnose viral and bacterial infections in clinical samples and to evaluate the safety of biological drug materials. In this study, the Axiom Microbiome Array was evaluated to determine its sensitivity, specificity and utility in microbiome analysis of veterinary clinical samples. The array contains probes designed to detect more than 12,000 species of viruses, bacteria, fungi, protozoa and archaea, yielding the most comprehensive microbial detection platform built to date. The array was able to detect Shigella and Aspergillus at 100 genome copies, and vaccinia virus DNA at 1,000 genome copies. The Axiom Microbiome Array made correct species-level calls in mock microbial community samples. When tested against serum, tissue, and fecal samples from pigs experimentally co-infected with porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus and porcine circovirus type 2, the microarray correctly detected these two viruses and other common viral and bacterial microbiome species. This cost-effective and high-throughput microarray is an efficient tool to rapidly analyze large numbers of clinical and environmental samples for the presence of multiple viral and bacterial pathogens."
https://openalex.org/W2913100127,"Personalised medicine targeted to specific biomarkers such as BRAF and c-Kit has radically improved the success of melanoma therapy. More recently, further advances have been made using therapies targeting the immune response. In particular, therapies targeting the PD-1/PD-L1 or CTLA-4 axes alone or in combination have shown more sustained responses in 30-60% of patients. However, these therapies are associated with considerable toxicities and useful biomarkers to predict responders and non-responders are slow to emerge. Here we developed a reliable melanoma circulating tumor cell (CTC) detection method with PD-L1 evaluation on CTCs. A set of melanoma cell surface markers was tested as candidates for targeted melanoma CTC isolation and a melanoma specific immunostaining-based CTC identification protocol combined with PD-L1 detection was established. In vitro testing of the effect of exposure to blood cells on melanoma cell PD-L1 expression was undertaken. Immunomagnetic targeting isolated melanoma CTCs in up to 87.5% of stage IV melanoma patient blood samples and 3 8.6% of these had some PD-L1 expressing CTCs. Our in vitro data demonstrate PD-L1 induction on melanoma cells in the blood.This study established a robust, reliable method to isolate melanoma CTCs and detect expression of PD-L1 on these cells."

Unlike most other viruses, PBCV-1 encodes most, if not all, of the machinery required to glycosylate its major capsid protein (MCP). The structures of the four N-linked glycans from the PBCV-1 MCP consist of nonasaccharides, and similar glycans are not found elsewhere in the three domains of life. Here, we identified the roles of three virus-encoded glycosyltransferases (GTs) that have four distinct GT activities in glycan synthesis. Two of the three GTs were previously annotated as GTs, but the third GT was identified in this study. We determined the GT functions by comparing the WT glycan structures from PBCV-1 with those from a set of PBCV-1 spontaneous GT gene mutants resulting in antigenic variants having truncated glycan structures. According to our working model, the virus gene a064r encodes a GT with three domains: domain 1 has a β-l-rhamnosyltransferase activity, domain 2 has an α-l-rhamnosyltransferase activity, and domain 3 is a methyltransferase that decorates two positions in the terminal α-l-rhamnose (Rha) unit.

Two monosaccharides, arabinose (Ara) and mannose (Man), occur as nonstoichiometric substituents, resulting in the existence of four glycoforms (Fig. 1). Currently, structures of this type are unknown elsewhere in the three domains of life. The discovery of these glycans has prompted our interest in viral glyco-related genes. In this regard, 17 of the PBCV-1 genes encode enzymes that manipulate sugars at different levels (12Van Etten J.L. Agarkova I. Dunigan D.D. Tonetti M. De Castro C. Duncan G.A. Chloroviruses have a sweet tooth.Viruses. 2017; 9 (28441734): E8810.3390/v9040088Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), with six of them annotated as encoding putative GTs: a064r (638 amino acids), a111/114r (860 aa), a219/222/226r (677 aa), a473l (517 aa), a546l (396 aa), and a075l (280 aa) (Table S1). In addition, a098r encodes a functional hyaluronate synthase (13DeAngelis P.L. Jing W. Graves M.V. Burbank D.E. Van Etten J.L. Hyaluronan synthase of chlorella virus PBCV-1.Science. 1997; 278 (9388183): 1800-180310.1126/science.278.5344.1800Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The genes encoding these GTs are scattered throughout the genome of the virus, and PSORT predicted that most of these proteins are soluble and located in the cytoplasm; a473l and a219/222/226r are predicted to encode GTs with six and nine transmembrane domains, respectively, whereas the ngLOC program predicts that A075L is located in the chloroplast, but only at a 15% confidence level. Thus, PBCV-1 encodes six GTs, a small number when compared with the complexity of its N-glycans. One solution to this paradox is that one or more of the six GTs might have multiple functional domains, making this restricted repertoire of enzymes sufficient to synthesize these structures. A second possibility is that some other virus genes encode enzymes that do not match GTs in the databases and so are overlooked during the searches. Finally, we cannot exclude the possibility that a host-encoded GT(s) could be involved in the glycosylation process. The protein encoded by gene a064r is of special interest.

Furthermore, glycosylation of the PBCV-1 MCP occurs in the cytoplasm. The current study addresses two issues related to PBCV-1 glycosylation. First, the structures of the glycans attached to five PBCV-1 antigenic variant MCPs are described. Second, using genetic and glycan structure evidence, we identify four of the putative GT activities involved in the synthesis of the glycan(s).

The 1H NMR spectrum of each variant (Fig. 2) differed from that of WT virus PBCV-1, supporting our hypothesis that the glycans were different. Accordingly, the features of each antigenic class will be described in the order of increasing structural complexity of the glycans. By convention, the monosaccharide residues identified in each oligosaccharide are labeled with the same (or a similar) letter used for the analogue unit of the glycan of the WT virus PBCV-1 (Fig. 1 and Figs. S1–S8 in the supporting material). Unless mentioned otherwise, we have focused on the major glycan structure of each of the variants. In some cases, minor structures made up less than 5–10% of the total sample. This virus is the most difficult to handle in laboratory conditions because it is unstable and tends to degrade during normal purification procedures. This intrinsic fragility of the viral particles hindered the obtaining of large amounts of biomass. Thus, to avoid further losses during chromatographic purification, the glycopeptide mixture was studied directly, omitting this purification step. Inspection of the 1H NMR spectrum of the P1L6 glycan (Fig. 2 and Fig. S1) showed two anomeric signals at 5.61 and 5.28 ppm along with a set of small signals at ∼5.0 ppm, whereas the other regions were crowded with signals from peptides resulting from capsid protein digestion. The structure of the glycan was determined by combining the chemical data with the analysis of the heteronuclear single quantum correlation (HSQC) spectrum. GC-MS analysis of the partially methylated and acetylated alditol derivatives (not shown) indicated that the sample contained a 2-linked Fuc, a terminal Gal, a terminal Xyl, and a 3,4-linked Glc. The HSQC spectrum (Fig. S1 and Table S2) had four anomeric resonances, and the overlap with the spectrum of the PBCV-1 glycan, used as a reference, permitted the identification of three of the four residues. As for H (3,4-substituted N-linked β-Glc), E (terminal α-Gal), and N (terminal β-Xyl), the 13C NMR chemical shifts were almost identical to that of the reference glycan, with only minor variations in the 1H NMR chemical shifts. The remaining carbon resonances were assigned to Fuc A, whose values differed from those of the reference glycoside (19Bock K. Pedersen C. Carbon-13 nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy of monosaccharides.Adv. Carbohydr. Chem. Biochem. 1983; 41: 27-6610.1016/S0065-2318(08)60055-4Crossref Scopus (1454) Google Scholar) due to glycosylation at C-2. Thus, the N-linked glycan of P1L6 is a tetrasaccharide, significantly truncated compared with that of WT PBCV-1. It contained all of the units of the chlorovirus N-glycans present in the conserved core region except for the Xyl attached to Fuc, referred to as the distal Xyl (14De Castro C. Speciale I. Duncan G. Dunigan D.D. Agarkova I. Lanzetta R. Sturiale L. Palmigiano A. Garozzo D. Molinaro A. Tonetti M. Van Etten J.L. N-Linked glycans of chloroviruses sharing a core architecture without precedent.Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 2016; 55 (26582281): 654-65810.1002/anie.201509150Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The identity of the E1L3 and E11 glycans was deduced from the similarities between the anomeric region of their proton spectra (Fig. S2A) and by the coincidence of their HSQC spectra (Figs. S2B and S3). In addition, when compared with P1L6 HSQC (Fig. S1), both E11 and E1L3 had one additional anomeric signal at 5.03 ppm. As for E1L3, comparison of its HSQC spectrum with that of PBCV-1 glycopeptides permitted the ready identification of several monosaccharide units (Table S3): the N-linked Glc H, the proximal Xyl N, and the Gal E. The anomeric proton at 5.03 ppm was identified by analyzing the other 2D NMR spectra, including correlation spectroscopy (COSY), total correlation spectroscopy (TOCSY), and transverse rotating frame Overhauser effect spectroscopy (T-ROESY). These data revealed that this resonance arose from a d-Rha unit linked at O-3 of the Fuc unit A. Unlike the WT glycan, this d-Rha was not further substituted with the terminal Man G; therefore, it was labeled F′ (and not F). Thus, E1L3 and E11 glycans are extended derivatives of P1L6 with the d-Rha unit. Accordingly, the Fuc residue was substituted at both O-2 and O-3 positions, in agreement with the GC-MS linkage analysis of this fraction (Fig. S2C). The 1H NMR (Fig. S4A) and HSQC (EPA2 reported as an example in Fig. S4B) spectra of EPA1 and EPA2 glycopeptides were almost identical, and both displayed two anomeric signals at 4.5–4.4 ppm, the region that in the PBCV-1 WT glycan contains the two β-Xyl units M and N. The units with anomeric signals at 5.63, 5.23, 5.04, 5.01, and 4.42 ppm were readily attributed to the Fuc A, Gal E, d-Rha F′, Glc H, and proximal Xyl N, respectively, by comparison with PBCV-1 glycan data. Notably, the proton and carbon chemical shifts of Fuc A (Table S4) indicated that this Fuc was substituted at all of the positions available, whereas d-Rha F′ was not glycosylated. Hence, NMR analysis focused on the additional anomeric signal at 4.46 ppm. Studying the connectivities from all of the 2D NMR spectra revealed that this signal belonged to a Xyl unit, connected to O-4 of A as in the PBCV-1 WT glycan, but not further substituted. Accordingly, this Xyl was labeled M′. Overall, the NMR data showed that the structure of the glycans of the antigenic class B, EPA1 and EPA2, consisted of the conserved core region characteristic of all of the chlorovirus N-glycans described to date (14De Castro C.

The glycopeptides from the three variants of Class A shared a similar pattern of signals in the anomeric region of the 1H NMR spectra, although some marginal variations of their relative intensities were noted (Fig. S5A). Compared with Class B, the anomeric region of the 1H NMR spectra of class A contained several additional signals, and the structural elucidation of these glycopeptides was performed by the combined analysis of the 2D NMR spectra (Figs. S5–S7 and Tables S5 and S6) as discussed for the other variants and detailed in the supporting material. Indeed, P9L10 produces a family of four glycopeptides, named P9L10A–D (Fig. S6), with the distal Xyl M (or M""; see “Discussion” in the supporting material) further elongated with the β-l-Rha unit. These four glycans differed in the nonstoichiometric presence of two residues, Man and Ara, as shown in Fig. S6. As for the P9L1 glycopeptides, the HSQC spectrum was almost superimposable on that of P9L10. Some variations occurred for the intensities of some signals as deduced by comparing their proton spectra (Fig. S5A). In P9L1, the intensities of E and E′ were comparable, suggesting that d-Rha was much less substituted with Man compared with P9L10 glycopeptides. Densities reporting the Ara (D unit) were not detected, indicating that this unit was absent or below the detection limit. Accordingly, P9L1 produced two main glycopeptides, analogues to P9L10A and P9L10B (Fig. S6). As for the glycopeptides of P91 (Fig. S7 and Table S6), most of the densities of its HSQC spectrum (Fig. S7, A and B) overlapped with those of the P9L1 and P9L10 variants. Like P9L1, the P91 variant lacks the Ara substitution to β-l-Rha, and it produced two oligosaccharides equivalent to P9L10A and P9L10B, as confirmed by analyzing the homonuclear spectra (T-ROESY in Fig. S7C and TOCSY in Fig. S7D). Importantly, these spectra enabled the assignment of densities that escaped the HSQC detection due to the low amount of the sample, including C-4 or C-5 of M"" (the putative position of these densities is enclosed in a dotted circle in Fig. S7B). The P91 HSQC spectrum contained some additional signals, including a methyl group at 1H/13C 3.56/62.4 ppm (Fig. S7A) and an anomeric proton at 1H/13C 4.75/103.4 ppm (Fig. S7B). NMR analysis of this new residue determined that it was a β-l-Rha, labeled as I"", that differed from I and I′ because it was methylated at O-2 (Table S6). Methylation at O-2 did not induce relevant variations in the chemical shift values of all of the other monosaccharides of the glycan, except for H-4/C-4 values (1H/13C 3.71/80.5 ppm) of the Xyl unit to which it was attached, named M‴. For this new oligosaccharide (named P91; Fig. S7), it was not possible to confirm whether the d-Rha uni"

Agrobacterium-mediated transformation method was used to study each deletion construct in tobaccos. Sequence analysis showed that several cis-acting elements (MYB binding site, Box-II, a TGACG-element, a CGTCA-element and a low temperature responsive element) were located within the promoter. Deletion analysis suggested the sequence between −1,694 and −1394bp may contain cis-elements associated with GUS up regulation. The MYB binding site (-757) might act as a negative drought-responsive element. There might be repressor elements located in the region (−1,694 to −1394bp) to repress Zmap expression under 4°C.

https://openalex.org/W2912623752,"Osteonecrosis of the jaw induced by administration of bisphosphonates (BPs), BP-related osteonecrosis (BRONJ), typically develops after tooth extraction and is medically challenging. As BPs inhibit oral mucosal cell growth, we hypothesized that suppression of the wound healing-inhibiting effects could prevent BRONJ onset after tooth extraction. Since basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) promotes wound healing, but has a short half-life, we examined whether the initiation of BRONJ could be prevented by applying a bFGF-containing gelatin hydrogel over the extraction sockets of BRONJ model rats. Forty-three rats, received two intravenous injections of zoledronic acid 60 μg/kg, once per week for a period of 2 weeks, underwent extraction of a unilateral lower first molar. The rats here were randomly assigned to the bFGF group (n = 15 rats, gelatin hydrogel sheets with incorporated bFGF applied over the sockets); the phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) group (n = 14 rats, gelatin hydrogel sheets without bFGF applied over the sockets); or the control group (n = 14 rats, nothing applied over the sockets). One rat in the bFGF group was sacrificed immediately after tooth extraction. Twenty-one rats were sacrificed at 3 weeks, and the remaining 21 rats were sacrificed at 8 weeks after tooth extractions. The harvested mandibles were analyzed using micro-computed tomography and sections were evaluated qualitatively for mucosal disruption and osteonecrosis. The incidence of osteonecrosis at 8 weeks after tooth extraction was 0% in the bFGF group, 100% in the PBS group, and 85.7% in the control group. The frequency of complete coverage of the extraction socket by mucosal tissue was significantly greater in the bFGF group than in the other groups. These results suggest that application of bFGF in the extraction socket promoted socket healing, which prevented BRONJ development. The growth-stimulating effects of bFGF may have offset the inhibition of wound healing by BP."
https://openalex.org/W2912167146,"Smut disease caused by the fungal pathogen Thecaphora frezii Carranza & Lindquist is threatening the peanut production in Argentina. Fungicides commonly used in the peanut crop have shown little or no effect controlling the disease, making it a priority to obtain peanut varieties resistant to smut. In this study, recombinant inbred lines (RILs) were developed from three crosses between three susceptible peanut elite cultivars (Arachis hypogaea L. subsp. hypogaea) and two resistant landraces (Arachis hypogaea L. subsp. fastigiata Waldron). Parents and RILs were evaluated under high inoculum pressure (12000 teliospores g-1 of soil) over three years. Disease resistance parameters showed a broad range of variation with incidence mean values ranging from 1.0 to 35.0% and disease severity index ranging from 0.01 to 0.30. Average heritability (h2) estimates of 0.61 to 0.73 indicated that resistance in the RILs was heritable, with several lines (4 to 7 from each cross) showing a high degree of resistance and stability over three years. Evidence of genetic transfer between genetically distinguishable germplasm (introgression in a broad sense) was further supported by simple-sequence repeats (SSRs) and Insertion/Deletion (InDel) marker genotyping. This is the first report of smut genetic resistance identified in peanut landraces and its introgression into elite peanut cultivars."
https://openalex.org/W2914453167,"Translocation of the glucose transporter GLUT4 to the sarcolemma accounts for glucose uptake in skeletal muscle following insulin administration. The protein kinase Akt2 and the small GTPase Rac1 have been implicated as essential regulators of insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation. Several lines of evidence suggest that Rac1 is modulated downstream of Akt2, and indeed the guanine nucleotide exchange factor FLJ00068 has been identified as an activator of Rac1. On the other hand, the mechanisms whereby Akt2 and Rac1 are regulated in parallel downstream of phosphoinositide 3-kinase are also proposed. Herein, we aimed to provide additional evidence that support a critical role for Akt2 in insulin regulation of Rac1 in mouse skeletal muscle. Knockdown of Akt2 by RNA interference abolished Rac1 activation following intravenous administration of insulin or ectopic expression of a constitutively activated phosphoinositide 3-kinase mutant. The activation of another small GTPase RalA and GLUT4 translocation to the sarcolemma following insulin administration or ectopic expression of a constitutively activated form of phosphoinositide 3-kinase, but not Rac1, were also diminished by downregulation of Akt2 expression. Collectively, these results strongly support the notion that Rac1 acts downstream of Akt2 leading to the activation of RalA and GLUT4 translocation to the sarcolemma in skeletal muscle."
https://openalex.org/W2914705519,"The alkaliphilic bacterium Pseudomonas pseudoalcaligenes CECT5344 uses free cyanide and several metal-cyanide complexes as the sole nitrogen source and tolerates high concentrations of metals like copper, zinc and iron, which are present in the jewelry wastewaters. To understand deeply the regulatory mechanisms involved in the transcriptional regulation of cyanide-containing wastewaters detoxification by P. pseudoalcaligenes CECT5344, RNA-Seq has been performed from cells cultured with a cyanide-containing jewelry wastewater, sodium cyanide or ammonium chloride as the sole nitrogen source. Small RNAs (sRNAs) that may have potential regulatory functions under cyanotrophic conditions were identified. In total 20 sRNAs were identified to be differentially expressed when compared the jewelry residue versus ammonium as nitrogen source, 16 of which could be amplified successfully by RT-PCR. As predicted targets of these 16 sRNAs were several components of the nit1C gene cluster encoding the nitrilase NitC essential for cyanide assimilation, the cioAB gene cluster that codes for the cyanide-insensitive cytochrome bd-type terminal oxidase, the medium length-polyhydroxyalkanoates (ml-PHAs) gene cluster, and gene clusters related with a global nitrogen limitation response like those coding for glutamine synthase and urease. Other targets were non-clustered genes (or their products) involved in metal resistance and iron acquisition, such as metal extrusion systems and the ferric uptake regulatory (Fur) protein, and a GntR-like regulatory family member probably involved in the regulation of the cyanide assimilation process in the strain CECT5344. Induction of genes targeted by sRNAs in the jewelry residue was demonstrated by qRT-PCR."
https://openalex.org/W2914447356,"Objective To retrospectively evaluate the value of computerized 3D texture analysis for differentiating pulmonary metastases from non-metastatic lesions in pediatric patients with osteosarcoma. Materials and methods This retrospective study was approved by the institutional review board. The study comprised 42 pathologically confirmed pulmonary nodules in 16 children with osteosarcoma who had undergone preoperative computed tomography between January 2009 and December 2014. Texture analysis was performed using an in-house program. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to identify factors for differentiating metastatic nodules from non-metastases. A subgroup analysis was performed to identify differentiating parameters in small non-calcified pulmonary nodules. The receiver operator characteristic curve was created to evaluate the discriminating performance of the established model. Results There were 24 metastatic and 18 non-metastatic lesions. Multivariate analysis revealed that higher mean attenuation (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 1.014, P = 0.003) and larger effective diameter (OR, 1.745, P = 0.012) were significant differentiators. The analysis with small non-calcified pulmonary nodules (7 metastases and 18 non-metastases) revealed significant inter-group differences in various parameters. Logistic regression analysis revealed that higher mean attenuation (OR, 1.007, P = 0.008) was a significant predictor of non-calcified pulmonary metastases. The established logistic regression model of subgroups showed excellent discriminating performance in the ROC analysis (area under the curve, 0.865). Conclusion Pulmonary metastases from osteosarcoma could be differentiated from non-metastases by using computerized texture analysis. Higher mean attenuation and larger diameter were significant predictors for pulmonary metastases, while higher mean attenuation was a significant predictor for small non-calcified pulmonary metastases."
https://openalex.org/W2911862241,"AMPA-type glutamate receptors (AMPARs) mediate fast excitatory neurotransmission in the mammalian central nervous system. Preferential AMPAR subunit assembly favors heteromeric GluA1/GluA2 complexes. The presence of the GluA2 subunit generates Ca2+-impermeable (CI) AMPARs that have linear current-voltage (I-V) relationships. However, diverse forms of synaptic plasticity and pathophysiological conditions are associated with shifts from CI to inwardly rectifying, GluA2-lacking, Ca2+-permeable (CP) AMPARs on time scales ranging from minutes to days. These shifts have been linked to GluA1 phosphorylation at Ser-845, a protein kinase A (PKA)-targeted site within its intracellular C-terminal tail, often in conjunction with protein kinase A anchoring protein 79 (AKAP79; AKAP150 in rodents), which targets PKA to GluA1. However, AKAP79 may impact GluA1 phosphorylation at other sites by interacting with other signaling enzymes. Here, we evaluated the ability of AKAP79, its signaling components, and GluA1 phosphorylation sites to induce CP-AMPARs under conditions in which CI-AMPARs normally predominate. We found that GluA1 phosphorylation at Ser-831 is sufficient for the appearance of CP-AMPARs and that AKAP79-anchored protein kinase C (PKC) primarily drives the appearance of these receptors via this site. In contrast, other AKAP79-signaling components and C-terminal tail GluA1 phosphorylation sites exhibited a permissive role, limiting the extent to which AKAP79 promotes CP-AMPARs. This may reflect the need for these sites to undergo active phosphorylation/dephosphorylation cycles that control their residency within distinct subcellular compartments. These findings suggest that AKAP79, by orchestrating phosphorylation, represents a key to a GluA1 phosphorylation passcode, which allows the GluA1 subunit to escape GluA2 dominance and promote the appearance of CP-AMPARs.

https://openalex.org/W2910668792,"The initial steps in the synthesis of leukotrienes are the translocation of 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO) to the nuclear envelope and its subsequent association with its scaffold protein 5-lipoxygenase-activating protein (FLAP). A major gap in our understanding of this process is the knowledge of how the organization of 5-LO and FLAP on the nuclear envelope regulates leukotriene synthesis. We combined single molecule localization microscopy with Clus-DoC cluster analysis, and also a novel unbiased cluster analysis to analyze changes in the relationships between 5-LO and FLAP in response to activation of RBL-2H3 cells to generate leukotriene C4. We identified the time-dependent reorganization of both 5-LO and FLAP into higher-order assemblies or clusters in response to cell activation via the IgE receptor. Clus-DoC analysis identified a subset of these clusters with a high degree of interaction between 5-LO and FLAP that specifically correlates with the time course of LTC4 synthesis, strongly suggesting their role in the initiation of leukotriene biosynthesis."

The results are as follows: (1) Both the MIIT universities and universities nationwide in China have increased their international academic publications, and MIIT have shown a greater increase for the past decade. (2) In terms of U-I-G interaction, for UG relations, the Tug value of MIIT universities has remained stable, while that of universities in China has become declined. For UI relations, the Tui value of both MIIT universities and universities in China has shown steady growth. For UIG relations, MIIT universities have a greater synergistic effect of Triple Helix relationship than universities in China. (3) For more details in seven MIIT universities, universities elected into “Project 985”, including HIT, BUAA, BIT and NPU, have published more papers, and been more synergistic with government and industry (UIG relations) than other three universities, including NUAA, NUST and HEU.

https://openalex.org/W2911702078,"Many patients with primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) experience non-hepatic symptoms that are possibly linked to altered interoception, the sense of the body's internal state. We used magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to determine if PBC patients exhibit structural and functional changes of the thalamus and insula, brain regions that process signals related to interoception.Fifteen PBC patients with mild disease and 17 controls underwent 3 Tesla T1-weighted MRI, resting-state functional MRI, and quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM), to measure thalamic and insular volume, neuronal activity and iron deposition, respectively. Group differences were assessed using analysis of covariance, and stepwise linear regression was used to determine the predictive power of clinical indicators of disease.PBC patients exhibited reduced thalamic volume (p < 0.01), and ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) non-responders exhibited lower left thalamus activity (p = 0.05). PBC patients also exhibited reduced anterior insula activity (p = 0.012), and liver stiffness positively correlated with MRI indicators of anterior insula iron deposition (p < 0.02).PBC affects structure and function of brain regions critically important to interoception. Moreover, these brain changes occur in patients with early, milder disease and thus may potentially be reversible."

FA assembly depends on various scaffold proteins, including the G protein–coupled receptor kinase-interacting protein 1 (GIT1), paxillin, and liprin-α. Although liprin-α and paxillin are known to competitively interact with GIT1, the molecular basis governing these interactions remains elusive. To uncover the underlying mechanisms of how GIT1 is involved in FA assembly by alternatively binding to liprin-α and paxillin, here we solved the crystal structures of GIT1 in complex with liprin-α and paxillin at 1.8 and 2.6 Å resolutions, respectively. These structures revealed that the paxillin-binding domain (PBD) of GIT1 employs distinct binding modes to recognize a single α-helix of liprin-α and the LD4 motif of paxillin. Structure-based design of protein variants produced two binding-deficient GIT1 variants; specifically, these variants lost the ability to interact with liprin-α only or with both liprin-α and paxillin. Expressing the GIT1 variants in COS7 cells, we discovered that the two PBD-meditated interactions play different roles in either recruiting GIT1 to FA or facilitating FA assembly. Additionally, we demonstrate that, unlike for the known binding mode of the FAT domain to LD motifs, the PBD of GIT1 uses different surface patches to achieve high selectivity in LD motif recognition.

Biochemical and functional characterization of the interaction between liprin-α1 and GIT1: implications for the regulation of cell motility.PLoS One. 2011; 6 (21695141): e2075710.1371/journal.pone.0020757Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). However, without detailed interaction information, it would be difficult to understand how these competitive interactions are coordinated and regulated in FA. Here, we determined crystal structures of GIT1_PBD in complex with a single α-helix (SAH) of liprin-α2 and the LD4 motif of paxillin. Although liprin-α2_SAH and paxillin_LD4 associate with the same binding groove on GIT1_PBD, surprisingly, these two helical peptides adopt binding orientations reversed to each other. Cellular analysis using the designed GIT1 mutations indicated that the GIT1/paxillin interaction controls the GIT1's localization to FA and the GIT1/liprin-α interaction promotes FA assembly. The structure of the GIT1_PBD/paxillin_LD4 complex reveals a novel LD recognition mode that involves a new surface patch on GIT1_PBD in addition to the canonical LD binding surface found in the FAT domain of FAK. To understand the assembly mechanism of GIT1, liprin-α, and paxillin, we investigated the binding of GIT1 to liprin-α and paxillin, which is mediated by the paxillin-binding domain of GIT1 (GIT1_PBD). To narrow down the minimal PBD-binding region in liprin-α2, various fragments were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified with high quality (Fig. 1A). As indicated by an isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC)-based assay, a small fragment containing residues 642–671 in liprin-α2 interacts with GIT1_PBD with a binding affinity of ∼3 μm (Fig. 1D). Neither an extension at the N-terminal nor at the C-terminal part of the fragment could significantly increase the binding affinity (Fig. S1A), suggesting that the 30-residue fragment contains essential and sufficient elements for the binding of liprin-α2 to GIT1_PBD. Although this fragment was predicted as a coiled-coil (14Ko J. Kim S. Valtschanoff J.G. Shin H. Lee J.R. Sheng M. Premont R.T. Weinberg R.J. Kim E. Interaction between liprin-α and GIT1 is required for AMPA receptor targeting.J.

Combining the CD spectrum of the fragment (Fig. S1C), we concluded that the fragment folds as a single α-helix. Therefore, the fragment in liprin-α2 was named hereafter as SAH. Similar to liprin-α2_SAH, the LD4 motif of paxillin (paxillin_LD4), also a single α-helix, interacts with GIT1_PBD with a binding affinity of ∼4 μm (Fig. 1E), consistent with the previous reports (15Zhang Z.M. Simmerman J.A. Guibao C.D. Zheng J.J. GIT1 paxillin-binding domain is a four-helix bundle, and it binds to both paxillin LD2 and LD4 motifs.J. Biol.

As the bindings of liprin-α and paxillin to GIT1_PBD are mutually exclusive (13Asperti C. Astro V. Pettinato E. Paris S. Bachi A. de Curtis I.

To address this question, we aimed to solve the complex structures of GIT1_PBD/liprin-α2_SAH and GIT1_PBD/paxillin_LD4 by using X-ray crystallography. Gel filtration analysis showed that GIT1_PBD forms a stable complex with either liprin-α2_SAH or paxillin_LD4 in solution (Fig. S2, A and B). Crystallization trails for the two complex samples yielded high-quality crystals. The crystal structures of the two complexes, GIT1_PBD/liprin-α2_SAH and GIT1_PBD/paxillin_LD4, were successfully determined at 1.8 and 2.6 Å resolutions, respectively, by using the molecular replacement method (Table 1). Most residues of liprin-α2_SAH (29 of the 30 total residues) and paxillin_LD4 (21 of the 24 total residues) in these two structures were clearly assigned (Fig. 2, A and B). As a FAT-like domain, GIT1_PBD adopts the four-helix-bundle conformation. The overall structures of GIT1_PBD in the two complexes are essentially same as its apo-form structure (overall root mean square deviations of 0.9 and 1.0 Å, respectively), indicating that GIT1_PBD does not undergo conformational change upon target binding. Consistent with our biochemical analysis, both liprin-α2_SAH and paxillin_LD4 form single helices to interact with GIT1_PBD on the same surface composed of the first helix (H1) and the last helix (H4) (Fig. 2, C and D), well explaining the competitive binding of liprin-α and paxillin to GIT1_PBD (13Asperti C.

However, to our surprise, despite containing an LD-like motif, liprin-α2_SAH binds to GIT1_PBD with the reverse orientation, in which the SAH helix is antiparallel to the H1 helix (Fig. 2C). Although the interacting orientations are different for the two PBD-binding peptides, both liprin-α2_SAH and paxillin_LD4 use their hydrophobic sides in their amphipathic helices to tightly pack with the H1/H4 groove of GIT1_PBD through hydrophobic interactions, which are further strengthened by hydrogen bondings (Fig. 2, E and F). In support of our findings, previous structural studies reported that hydrophobic interactions involving the GIT1_PBD/paxillin_LD4 interaction are critical for complex formation (15Zhang Z.M.

Additionally, Asp-267 in paxillin_LD4 forms a salt bridge with Lys-758 in GIT1_PBD (Fig. 2F), which is a characteristic interaction in the LD-binding mode (15Zhang Z.M. Simmerman J.A. Guibao C.D.

Sequence analysis further shows that the interface residues in GIT1, liprin-α2, and paxillin are highly conserved across species (Fig. 2, G–I), suggesting that the two different GIT1-binding modes observed for liprin-α2_SAH and paxillin_LD4 are likely to be shared by other members of the liprin-α family and HIC-5, respectively. As the bindings of liprin-α2_SAH and paxillin_LD4 to GIT1_PBD are mainly mediated by hydrophobic interactions (Fig. 2, E and F), we carefully analyzed the interfaces by comparing the buried hydrophobic residues of the two bound peptides. In the LD4 peptide, Leu-266LD4, Leu-269LD4, and Leu-273LD4, the conserved leucine residues in the LD core (Fig. 1B), interact with the hydrophobic groove formed by the H1 and H4 helices of GIT1_PBD, which is a general LD-binding feature identified in other FAT-like domains (Fig. S3). Interestingly, by aligning the two peptide-bound GIT1_PBD structures together, we found that the side chains of Ile-660SAH, Leu-657SAH, and Leu-653SAH in the SAH peptide could be overlapped precisely with those of the three leucine residues in the LD4 peptide (Fig. 3A), despite the different helical orientations between the two peptides. Likewise, the reversed amino acid sequence of the SAH peptide can be aligned to the LD4 sequence with the hydrophobic residues matched (Fig. 3B). This suggests the central roles of these hydrophobic residues in the binding of liprin-α2_SAH and paxillin_LD4 to GIT1_PBD. In addition to the three overlapped residues, a few C-terminal residues of both of the two peptides significantly contribute to the intermolecular hydrophobic interactions. As shown in Fig. 3A, Ile-664SAH and Ile-667SAH in the SAH peptide interact with the upper part of the H1/H4 groove, formed by the N terminus of H1 and the C terminus of H4, whereas the bulky side chain of Phe-276LD4 in the LD4 peptide occupies the H1/H4 groove in the lower part. In contrast, the corresponding positions of Ile-664SAH and Ile-667SAH in the LD4 peptide (Ala-262LD4 and Ala-259LD4) and of Phe-276LD4 in the SAH peptide (Ala-650SAH) are all alanine residues (Fig. 3, A and B), of which small side chains barely touch the H1/H4 groove, thereby contributing little to the bindings of either paxillin_LD4 or liprin-α2_SAH to GIT1_PBD. Thus, replacing Ala-650SAH with a phenylalanine in the SAH peptide may artificially create an additional PBD-binding site by mimicking the binding of Phe-276LD4 to GIT1_PBD. In line with this hypothesis, the A650F mutation of liprin-α2_SAH largely enhances the binding (Fig. S4). Based on the above analysis, we conclude that GIT1_PBD can specifically recognize liprin-α2_SAH and paxillin_LD4 by combinatorial usage of different surface patches in the H1/H4 groove, in which the upper and lower parts of the groove provide the binding specificities for the SAH and LD4 peptides, respectively, whereas the middle part of the groove creates the common binding surface for both of the two peptides (Fig. 3A). The binding mode differences between paxillin_LD4 and liprin-α2_SAH allow us to design GIT1 mutations, A754Q and I655Q, for disruption of specific target interactions with GIT1_PBD. The A754Q mutation largely decreases the hydrophobicity of the overlapped binding surface and imposes steric hindrance for interactions, thereby disrupting the bindings of GIT1_PBD to both liprin-α2_SAH and paxillin_LD4. By contrast, as Ile-655 locates on the SAH-binding surface on GIT1_PBD, the I655Q mutation presumably prevents GIT1_PBD from binding to liprin-α2_SAH while it retains the ability of GIT1_PBD to bind with paxillin_LD4. Fully consistent with our design, neither liprin-α2_SAH nor paxillin_LD4 shows detectable binding to the A754Q mutant, whereas the I655Q mutant interacts with paxillin_LD4 but not liprin-α2_SAH, as indicated by ITC-based measurements (Fig. 3C) and analytical gel filtration analysis (Fig. S2, C–F). As the core component of FA, paxillin is indispensable for FA assembly (25Brown M.C. Turner C.E. Paxillin: adapting to change.Physiol.

Methylation specific epigenetic marks are one of the players of the complex epileptogenesis scenario leading to GGE. In this study, we have set out to perform genome-wide methylation profiling to analyze GGE trios each consisting of an affected parent-offspring couple along with an unaffected parent. We have developed a novel scoring scheme within trios to categorize each locus analyzed as hypo or hypermethylated. This stringent approach classified differentially methylated genes in each trio and helped us to produce trio specific and pooled gene lists with inherited and aberrant methylation levels. In order to analyze the methylation differences from a boarder perspective, we performed enrichment analysis with these lists using the PANOGA software. This collective effort has led us to detect pathways associated with the GGE phenotype, including the neurotrophin signaling pathway. We have demonstrated a trio based approach to genome-wide DNA methylation analysis that identified individual and possibly minor changes in methylation marks that could be involved in epileptogenesis leading to GGE."

Genome analysis of the P. fijiensis PKS8-1 gene identified it as part of a gene cluster including genes encoding two transcription factors, a regulatory protein, a glyoxylase/beta-lactamase-like protein, an MFS transporter, a cytochrome P450, two aldo/keto reductases, a dehydrogenase, and a decarboxylase. Genome analysis of the related pathogens Pseudocercospora musae, Pseudocercospora eumusae, and Pseudocercospora pini-densiflorae, identified orthologous clusters containing a nearly identical combination of genes. Phylogenetic analysis of PKS8-1 identified homology to PKS proteins in the monodictyphenone and cladofulvin pathways in Aspergillus nidulans and Cladosporium fulvum, respectively. Analysis of clustered genes showed that the PKS8-1 cluster shares genes for enzymes involved in the production of the emodin intermediate in the monodictyphenone and cladofulvin pathways, but differs in many genes, suggesting production of a different metabolic product. Time course analysis of gene expression in infected banana showed up-regulation of PKS8-1 and four of eight clustered genes as early as 2 weeks post-inoculation and remaining high through 9 weeks. Overexpression of the pathway through constitutive expression of an aflR-like transcription factor gene in the cluster resulted in increased expression in culture of PKS8-1 as well as the four clustered genes that are up-regulated in infected plants. No differences were seen in timing or severity of disease symptoms with the overexpression strains relative to controls, however gene expression analysis showed no difference in expression in planta by an overexpression strain relative to controls. Thus constitutive expression of the aflR-like gene is not sufficient to upregulate the pathway above normal expression in planta. Pathway expression during all phases of disease development and conservation of the pathway in related Pseudocercospora species support a role for this pathway in disease."

Most of the victims of recurrent older adult abuse are female and younger elderly. Psychological abuse was the most recurrent, followed by financial abuse, occurring in the victim's own home. In João Pessoa, older women and elderly living with their abusers were at a higher risk of report of multiple abuse acts. In Ribeirão Preto, living with the aggressor was a risk factor for multiple violent acts. In the total population of the study, living without companion and not living with the aggressor were identified as protective factors against recurrent violence. The need to implement social and legal actions to improve safety for the more vulnerable groups is emphasized."

Occlusion bodies (OBs) of SpexNPV isolate 244.1 were examined, and the nucleotide sequence of the genome was determined and characterized. SpexNPV-244.1 OBs consisted of irregular polyhedra with a size and appearance typical for alphabaculoviruses. Virions within the polyhedra contained 1–8 nucleocapsids per unit envelope. The SpexNPV-244.1 genome was comprised of a 129,528 bp circular sequence, in which 139 ORFs were annotated. Five homologous regions (hrs) consisting of a variable number of 28-bp imperfect palindromes were identified in the genome. The genome sequence contained the 38 core genes of family Baculoviridae, as well as three ORFs unique to the SpexNPV sequence and one ORF that was apparently acquired by horizontal gene transfer with a betabaculovirus ancestor. Phylogenetic inference with core gene amino acid sequence alignments placed SpexNPV-244.1 in a lineage containing alphabaculoviruses of Spodoptera frugiperda and Spodopotera exigua which in turn is part of a larger group of alphabaculoviruses from the subfamily Noctuinae in the lepidopteran family Noctuidae. Kimura-2-parameter pairwise nucleotide distances indicated that SpexNPV-244.1 represented a different and previously unlisted species in the genus Alphabaculovirus. Gene parity plots indicated that the gene order of SpexNPV-244.l was extensively collinear with that of Spodoptera exigua NPV (SeMNPV).

https://openalex.org/W2914714125,"This study explores whether there is a short-term relationship between intragenerational social mobility and mortality while individuals are working and whether it is widespread across different causes of death. Net of accumulated advantages and disadvantages, social mobility may influence mortality through health selection or changes in well-being. Men and women working in 1996 up to age 65 are observed annually until 2012 in Swedish register data. Time-varying covariates and origin and destination status are controlled for in discrete time event-history analyses. Results show that when men were upwardly mobile, mortality was lower due to cancer, CVD, IHD, and suicide. Upward mobility was only associated with lower odds of suicide for women. When downwardly mobile, cancer mortality was higher for both men and women and smoking-related cancer mortality was higher for men. Social mobility was not linked to deaths related to accidents and poisoning or alcohol-related mortality. The results may support a relationship between social mobility and mortality characterized by health selection: Only in the case of a chronic illness (cancer) was downward mobility associated with higher mortality. The widespread relationship between upward mobility and lower mortality for men may also indicate positive health selection into attaining a higher class and that individuals with poor health may be less likely to search for better positions or receive promotions."

Chi-square trend test was used to analyze trends between the prevalence of carotid plaques with an increasing CHA2DS2-VASc score. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression was also used to assess the association between carotid plaques and CHA2DS2-VASc scores. The area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) was used to determine the optimal cutoff points of different CHA2DS2-VASc scores in NVAF patients.NVAF patients with carotid plaques had higher CHA2DS2-VASc scores compared with patients who did not have carotid plaques (3.01±1.36 vs. 2.55±1.28, P < 0.05). In all participants, male participants and female participants, the prevalence of carotid plaques increased significantly as the CHA2DS2-VASc score increased (P for trend < 0.001). Multivariate logistic regression analysis demonstrated that for each 1-point increase in the CHA2DS2-VASc score, there was an associated 37% increase in the prevalence of carotid plaques. ROC curve analysis revealed that a CHA2DS2-VASc score ≥ 2 in male patients (sensitivity, 44.67%; specificity, 75.64%; AUC, 0.639) or ≥ 3 in female patients (sensitivity, 47.24%; specificity, 72.40%; AUC, 0.634) were associated with carotid plaques.The prevalence of carotid plaques in patients with NVAF was associated with the CHA2DS2-VASc score."
https://openalex.org/W2913078461,"Background High-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) is a sensitive biomarker of systemic inflammation and is related to the development and progression of cardiometabolic diseases. Beyond individual-level determinants, characteristics of the residential physical and social environment are increasingly recognized as contextual determinants of systemic inflammation and cardiometabolic risks. Based on a large nationwide sample of adults in Germany, we analyzed the cross-sectional association of hsCRP with residential environment characteristics. We specifically asked whether these associations are observed independent of determinants at the individual level. Methods Data on serum hsCRP levels and individual sociodemographic, behavioral, and anthropometric characteristics were available from the German Health Interview and Examination Survey for Adults (2008–2011). Area-level variables included, firstly, the predefined German Index of Socioeconomic Deprivation (GISD) derived from the INKAR (indicators and maps on spatial and urban development in Germany and Europe) database and, secondly, population-weighted annual average concentration of particulate matter (PM10) in ambient air provided by the German Environment Agency. Associations with log-transformed hsCRP levels were analyzed using random-intercept multi-level linear regression models including 6,768 participants aged 18–79 years nested in 162 municipalities. Results No statistically significant association of PM10 exposure with hsCRP was observed. However, adults residing in municipalities with high compared to those with low social deprivation showed significantly elevated hsCRP levels (change in geometric mean 13.5%, 95%CI 3.2%-24.7%) after adjusting for age and sex. The observed relationship was independent of individual-level educational status. Further adjustment for smoking, sports activity, and abdominal obesity appeared to markedly reduce the association between area-level social deprivation and hsCRP, whereas all individual-level variables contributed significantly to the model. Conclusions Area-level social deprivation is associated with higher systemic inflammation and the potentially mediating role of modifiable risk factors needs further elucidation. Identifying and assessing the source-specific harmful components of ambient air pollution in population-based studies remains challenging."
https://openalex.org/W2914384343,"Background Assessment of prognosis of work functioning is a challenging aspect of work disability evaluations. To gain insight into this process, we conducted a qualitative study to determine the aspects considered and the difficulties, needs and potential solutions affecting the prognosis assessment by physicians performing disability evaluations. Methods In-depth, semi-structured individual interviews were conducted with 20 physicians performing disability evaluations for the Dutch social security institute: the national institute for employee benefit schemes. Verbatim transcripts were independently analyzed by two researchers using MAXQDA software until significant themes emerged and data saturation was achieved. Results The responses that emerged from the interviews were clustered in three primary themes. The first theme was “Aspects considered by physicians in assessing prognosis.” When making a prognosis, physicians considered the following medical issues: nature and severity of disease, the role of treatment, course of the disease, external information, and medical evidence. Patient-related issues and physician-related aspects were also distinguished. Patient-related aspects concerned the patients’ work perspectives and coping or recovery behavior. Physician-related aspects concerned awareness of the physician’s own role and reflection on aspects such as empathy for clients and ethical considerations. The second theme was “Difficulties physicians face in assessing prognosis,” which included challenges during the assessment of diseases of a complex or less concrete nature, applying prognostic evidence to the individual, and lack of time when seeking prognostic evidence. The third theme concerned “Needs and solutions” formulated by physicians that facilitated the prognostic assessment. It consisted of continuous education, better collaboration with medical specialists and/or labor experts, and the use of prognostic tools such as checklists, apps or internet applications incorporating evidence on prognosis. Conclusions Physicians identified several medical and patient-related aspects that elucidated the prognosis assessment. Given the variety of challenges and the need for further support found in the current study, future research should focus on the development and evaluation of training, tools, and guidelines to improve prognosis assessment by physicians."
https://openalex.org/W2914505363,"Background Little is known about the causality and pathological mechanism underlying the association of seasonal variation with myocardial injury in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). Objective We evaluated the association of seasonal effect with myocardial injury using cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging in STEMI patients undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Methods In 279 patients undergoing primary PCI for STEMI, CMR was performed for a median of 3.3 days after the index procedure. Of these, STEMI occurred in 56 patients in the winter (Winter group), 80 patients in the spring (Spring group), 76 patients in the summer (Summer group), and 67 patients in the autumn (Autumn group), respectively. We compared myocardial infarct size, extent of area at risk (AAR), myocardial salvage index (MSI) and microvascular obstruction (MVO) area as assessed by CMR according to the season in which STEMI occurred. Results In the CMR analysis, the myocardial infarct size was not significantly different among the Winter group (21.0 ± 10.5%), the Spring group (19.6 ± 11.5%), the Summer group (18.6 ± 10.6%), and the Autumn group (21.1 ± 11.3%) (P = 0.475). The extent of AAR, MSI, and MVO areas were similar among the four groups. In the subgroup analysis, myocardial infarct size, extent of AAR, MSI, and MVO were not significantly different between the Harsh climate (winter + summer) and the Mild climate (spring + autumn) groups. Conclusions Seasonal influences may not affect advanced myocardial injury in STEMI patients undergoing primary PCI."
https://openalex.org/W2912801911,"Most neutralizing antibodies against highly pathogenic avian influenza A virus H5N1 recognize the receptor-binding site (RBS) on the globular head domain and the stem of H5N1 hemagglutinin (HA). Through comprehensive analysis of multiple human protective antibodies, we previously identified four vulnerable sites (VS1-VS4) on the globular head domain. Among them, the VS1, occupying the opposite side of the RBS on the same HA, was defined by the epitope of antibody 65C6. In this study, we report the crystal structures of two additional human H5N1 antibodies isolated from H5N1-infected individuals, 3C11 and AVFluIgG01, bound to the head at 2.33- and 2.30-Å resolution, respectively. These two new antibody epitopes have large overlap with and extend beyond the original VS1. Site-directed mutagenesis experiments identified eight pivotal residues (Ser-126b, Lys-165, Arg-166, Ser-167, Tyr-168, Asn-169, Thr-171, and Asn-172) critical for 65C6-, 3C11-, and AVFluIgG01-binding and neutralization activities. These residues formed a unique ""Y""-shaped surface on H5N1 globular head and are highly conserved among H5N1 viruses. Our results further support the existence of a vulnerable site distinct from the RBS and the stem region of H5N1 HA, and future design of immunogens should take this particular site into consideration."
https://openalex.org/W2912701492,"In effort to address the shortage of emergency medical care in Cameroon, the Yaoundé Emergency Center (CURY) was established in June, 2015 in Yaoundé, Cameroon. To evaluate its impact on the communities of Yaoundé, we assessed the changes in utilizations of emergency medical care since the establishment of the CURY. In 2014 the first survey was conducted on randomly selected 619 households (3,201 individuals) living in six health districts of Yaoundé. In 2017 the second quantitative survey was conducted on 622 households (3,472 individuals) using the same survey methods as the first survey. In both surveys, data on demographic information, socioeconomic status, and utilization of healthcare, including emergency care in the past year were collected on every member of the households via face-to-face interview. Data on two surveys were compared. Participants in the both surveys had similar age and gender distribution with mean age of 21–22 and 46% being male. In 2014 survey, healthcare utilization rates for emergency unit, outpatient, and hospitalization were 4.8%, 36.7%, and 10.0%, respectively. In 2017 survey, corresponding rates were 5.8%, 32.5%, and 9.2%%, respectively. The increase in the utilization of emergency unit between two surveys showed a marginal statistical significance (p = 0.08), while outpatient utilization showed statistically significant decrease from 2014 to 2017 survey (from 36.7% to 32.5%; p <0.001). After the establishment of a dedicated emergency medical center in Yaoundé, Cameroon, the utilization of emergency care was increased in the Yaoundé community. Further studies are warranted to examine the direct effect of the establishment of the CURY on healthcare utilization in Yaoundé."
https://openalex.org/W2912216933,"To study the short-term effects of a single-dose chloral hydrate on neonatal auditory perception by measuring auditory event-related potentials (aERPs).Thirty-nine full-term neonates, aged 2-28 days and weighing 2980-4350 g, were divided into two groups including a chloral hydrate group (CH group, n = 17) and a non-chloral hydrate control group (non-CH group, n = 22). The CH group was given single-dose chloral hydrate (30 mg/kg) orally before aERPs measurement. An auditory oddball paradigm was used to elicit aERPs. P2 and N2 components of the ERP were recorded from electrodes at the Fz and Cz locations, and the areas under their curves (P2 and N2 areas) were calculated for the comparison between two groups.Significant differences was found in the P2 area between the two groups at Fz and Cz (Fz: F (1,37) = 487.75, P < 0.05; Cz: F (1,37) = 1465.94, P < 0.05). Similarly, significant difference was also in the N2 area between the two groups at both locations (Fz: F(1,37) = 153.38, P < 0.05; Cz: F(1,37) = 798.42, P < 0.05).A single-dose of chloral hydrate impacts neonatal auditory perception in the short-term. Long-term effects will also be studied in future."
https://openalex.org/W2913685823,"In the era of big science, countries allocate big research and development budgets to large scientific facilities that boost collaboration and research capability. A nuclear fusion device called the “tokamak” is a source of great interest for many countries because it ideally generates sustainable energy expected to solve the energy crisis in the future. Here, to explore the scientific effects of tokamaks, we map a country’s research capability in nuclear fusion research with normalized revealed comparative advantage on five topical clusters—material, plasma, device, diagnostics, and simulation—detected through a dynamic topic model. Our approach captures not only the growth of China, India, and the Republic of Korea but also the decline of Canada, Japan, Sweden, and the Netherlands. Time points of their rise and fall are related to tokamak operation, highlighting the importance of large facilities in big science. The gravity model points out that two countries collaborate less in device, diagnostics, and plasma research if they have comparative advantages in different topics. This relation is a unique feature of nuclear fusion compared to other science fields. Our results can be used and extended when building national policies for big science."
