Spruce lignin gives only vanillin1, whereas hardwood lignins give both aldehydes in relative quantities depending on the species2. Only limited success has attended efforts to separate them by chemical means2,3. Separation by vacuum sublimation2 employs 0·4 gm. of the mixed aldehydes and requires specialized equipment. The present communication shows that separation can be effected by paper partition chromatography using petroleum ether saturated with water as the mobile phase."

which arrival times of elastic waves from a near-by earthquake
were used to calculate the velocity of earthquake
waves in the earth's crust, He found for longitudinal
waves a velocity of 5.4 km/ sec in the upper 50 km and a
velocity of about 7.8 km/sec below that. Earthquake
records from other regions furnished similar results and
indicated one or more intermediate layers. Later, when
artificial explosions were recorded, it was found that the
velocity in the uppermost layers is appreciably higher than
that found from earthquake records. Data are available
now for parts of Europe and the United States. They
indicate a velocity of about 6 km/sec immediately below
the sedimentary layers, increasing (in some regions) to
as much as 61 km/sec at a depth of about 10 km. The
Mohorovicic discontinuity is found in general at a depth
between 30 and 40 km, and the velocity below it is between
8.1 and 8.2 km/sec. The discrepancy between the results from earthquake waves and those from artificial
explosions is beyond the limits of error. This new interpretation
is suggested to explain all observations."

https://openalex.org/W2077509797,"THE occurrence of a new strain of mice (Mus musculus, L.) resembling the extinct souris luxées of Rabaud1 has been reported2 ; these mice show extensive abnormalities of the hind limbs, including absence of the tibia (hemimelia). The condition was found to be due to the presence in homozygous form of a single mutant gene which was called 'luxate', symbol lx. This has been found to be in the linkage group designated as the third by Dunn, Grüneberg and Snell8, closely linked to macrocytic anæmia, Wv 4. The other markers known to be in this group are recessive spotting, s, hairlessness, hr 6, and pirouette, pi 6; s, hr and Wv are known to lie in that order7."
https://openalex.org/W2060382514,THE recent development of scintillation counters as high-efficiency detectors of gamma-radiation makes attractive the possibility of detecting neutrons by means of the γ-rays produced in many neutron-induced reactions. Particularly interesting is the detection of the 480-keV. γ-ray given off by the excited lithium-7 in the reaction:

The enzymatically liberated phosphate is converted to the lead salt, and the usual treatment with ammonium sulfide and careful rinsing with water follows. It is necessary to substitute lead for the cobalt of the alkaline phosphatase procedure, since cobalt sulfide is insufficiently soluble in the HCl required subsequently."

The amount of atropine required to block the effect of acetylcholine does not affect the action of histamine on unstriated muscle1. According to Forst2 and Feld-berg3, the contraction induced by histamine in unstriated guinea-pig muscle is only slightly diminished by small doses of atropine."

Tobler et al.1 obtained a fluoranthene disulphonic acid, which on fusion with alkali followed by oxidation gave a coloured ‘chin-hydronartigen’ compound, and they rightly pointed out that a quinoid product would mean that sulphonation had occurred at the 4 : 11-positions. Their evidence, however, is not conclusive and experimental details are lacking."

Specimens of urine from women pregnant from six weeks to seven months were used. In each series, two or more experimental toads were used. Controls in each series were injected with urine from a woman known not to be pregnant."

https://openalex.org/W4244191744,"AT the fifth sections meeting of the Conference of the British Institute of Management which took, place at Chonville in May 1949, the question of whether tnere is need for standard terminology and nameiclature in management was discussed. In the opening paper Mr. Winston Rogers, head of the Department of Management at Acton Technical College, stressed the need for tieflpiinology to be standardized as soon as possible although, at the same time, he recognized that the freezing of terminology at too early a stage in the development of scientific management would lead to difficulties. Among the people who would immediately ben'efit by this standardization would be authors, technical -editors of publishing houses, industrial education officers and lecturers in management subjects. Once the need for standardized terminology had been admitted, it would be necessary to consider the five following points : the criteria which any term must fulfil ; the nature of the contemplated standardization ; the most desirable province for preliminary exploitation; the composition of the team of investigators ; the authority responsible for the enforcement of the standardized terminology. Mr. Rogers examined each point in turn, and after considerable discussion it was agreed that the British Institute of Management should be asked to examine existing terms, to publish then current meanings and to encourage standard usage whenever possible. Efforts should be made to extend this work to the international field, after initial attempts in the English-speaking countries."
