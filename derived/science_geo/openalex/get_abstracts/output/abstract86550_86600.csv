https://openalex.org/W1609528353,"The cardiac ventricular myosin phenotype is developmentally and hormonally regulated. The genes coding for the two myosin heavy chains ( MHCs ), alpha and beta, have been recently isolated and characterized. In this study, we establish the precise temporal expression of these MHC genes in correlation with the myosin phenotype both during cardiac development and in response to different thyroid hormone levels and also document their expression in other muscle tissues. The close correlation observed between the relative abundance of the alpha- and beta-MHC mRNAs and corresponding isozymes demonstrates that the MHC phenotype is produced by the expression of the alpha- and beta-MHC genes and is regulated by changes in the level of their respective mRNAs. The opposite effect of thyroid hormone on the expression of the alpha- and beta-MHC genes in the ventricular myocardium indicates that these genes are regulated in an antithetic fashion. Finally, the MHC mRNAs encoded by the alpha- and beta-MHC genes are also present in the atrial myocardium and in the soleus, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W1973435759,"We have isolated and mapped an X-linked recessive mutation in Drosophila that blocks associative learning, and have partially characterized it biochemically. The mutation affects adenylate cyclase activity. Cyclase activity from mutant flies differed from the wild-type enzyme in that it was not stimulated by calcium or calmodulin. Mutant cyclase activity did respond to guanyl nucleotides, fluoride, and monoamines, which suggests that the defect is neither in the hormone receptor nor in either known GTP-binding regulatory protein. The mutation possibly affects the catalytic subunit directly. We postulate that there is at least one other type of adenylate cyclase activity that is unaffected by the mutation and insensitive to calcium/calmodulin."
https://openalex.org/W1998790265,"We have shown that covalent conjugation of ubiquitin to proteins is temperature-sensitive in the mouse cell cycle mutant ts85 due to a specifically thermolabile ubiquitin-activating enzyme (accompanying paper). We show here that degradation of short-lived proteins is also temperature sensitive in ts85 , in contrast to wild-type and revertant cells. While more than 70% of the prelabeled abnormal proteins (containing amino acid analogs) or puromycyl peptides are degraded within 4 hr at the permissive temperature in both ts85 and wild-type cells, less than 15% are degraded in ts85 cells at the nonpermissive temperature. Degradation of abnormal proteins and puromycyl peptides in both ts85 cells and wild-type cells is nonlysosomal and ATP-dependent. Immunochemical analysis shows a strong and specific reduction in the levels of in vivo labeled ubiquitin-protein conjugates at the nonpermissive temperature in ts85 cells. Degradation of normal, short-lived proteins is also specifically temperature sensitive in ts85 . We suggest that the contribution of ubiquitin-independent pathways to the degradation of short-lived proteins in this higher eucaryotic cell is no more than 10%, and possibly less."
https://openalex.org/W1969336855,"Ubiquitin, a 76 residue protein, occurs in eucaryotic cells either free or covalently joined to a variety of protein species. Previous work suggested that ubiquitin may function as a signal for attack by proteinases specific for ubiquitin-protein conjugates. We show that the mouse cell line ts85 , a previously isolated cell cycle mutant, is temperature-sensitive in ubiquitin-protein conjugation, and that this effect is due to the specific thermolability of the ts85 ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1). From E1 thermoinactivation kinetics in mixed (wild-type plus ts85 ) extracts, and from copurification of the determinant of E1 thermolability with E1 in ubiquitin-affinity chromatography, we conclude that the determinant of E1 thermolability is contained within the E1 polypeptide. ts85 cells fail to degrade otherwise short-lived intracellular proteins at the nonpermissive temperature (accompanying paper), demonstrating that degradation of the bulk of short-lived proteins in this higher eucaryotic cell proceeds through a ubiquitin-dependent pathway. We discuss possible roles of ubiquitin-dependent pathways in DNA transactions, the cell cycle, and the heat shock response."
https://openalex.org/W2036042116,"A high percentage of transgenic mice developing from eggs microinjected with plasmids containing the SV40 early region genes and a metallothionein fusion gene develop tumors within the choroid plexus. A line of mice has been established in which nearly every affected animal succumbs to this brain tumor. Thymic hypertrophy and kidney pathology are also observed in some mice. SV40 T-antigen mRNA and protein are readily detected in affected tissues; however, SV40 T-antigen gene expression is barely detectable in unaffected tissues or in susceptible tissues prior to overt pathology, suggesting that tumorigenesis depends upon activation of the SV40 genes. Comparison of DNA from tumor tissue (or cell lines derived from tumors) with DNA from unaffected tissues reveals structural rearrangements as well as changes in DNA methylation of the foreign DNA. The SV40 genes are frequently amplified in tumor tissue, which further indicates that their expression is intimately involved in tumorigenesis in transgenic mice."
https://openalex.org/W2036272159,"X-ray studies have established that the structure of a right-handed, Watson-Crick double helix can change from place to place along its length as a function of base sequence. The base pairs transmit deformations out to the phosphate backbone, where they can then be recognized by proteins and other DNA-binding reagents. Here we have examined at single-bond resolution the interactions of three commonly used nucleases (DNAase I, DNAase II, and copper-phenanthroline) with a DNA of natural origin, the 160 bp tyrT promoter. All three of these reagents seem sensitive to DNA backbone geometry rather than base sequence per se. Their sequence-dependent patterns of cleavage provide evidence for structural polymorphism of several sorts: global variation in helix groove width, global variation in radial asymmetry, and local variation in phosphate accessibility. These findings explain how sequence zones of a certain base composition, or purine-pyrimidine asymmetry, can influence the recognition of DNA by protein molecules."
https://openalex.org/W2128569886,"A chromosomal myc gene displays one of three patterns of activity depending upon the arrangement of the gene and its allelic partner. In nonmalignant B cells both myc alleles are normally expressed. In Burkitt lymphoma cells carrying both a translocated and a nontranslocated myc allele, the translocated allele is inappropriately expressed, while the nontranslocated allele is virtually inactive. Here we examine the chromatin structure of these genes using DNAase I hypersensitivity in nonmalignant lymphoblastoid cells and in the Burkitt lymphoma, BL31 . Three hypersensitivity patterns emerge that correlate with the state of the gene and reveal sites associated with putative regulatory structures. One region is associated with the two myc promoters, one with a specific nuclear protein binding site, and one--which is markedly enhanced in the inactive germline gene in the Burkitt cell--with a putative negative control region. The perturbation of the normal pattern in this particular Burkitt cell may be due to the action of an immunoglobulin enhancer."
https://openalex.org/W1535671912,"A factor (ARF) that is required for the cholera toxin-dependent ADP-ribosylation of the stimulatory, GTP-binding regulatory component (Gs) of adenylate cyclase has been purified about 2000-fold from cholate extracts of rabbit liver membranes. ARF is an intrinsic membrane protein with Mr = 21,000. The final product can be resolved into two polypeptides with very similar molecular weights; each of these has ARF activity. The ADP-ribosylation of Gs can now be studied with defined components. GTP and ARF are both necessary cofactors. The data imply that the substrates for the activated toxin are NAD and a GTP X Gs X ARF complex, and the reaction proceeds in a lipid environment. The apparent ability of ARF to bind to the alpha subunit of Gs suggests that it may play another, unknown role in the regulation of adenylate cyclase activity."
https://openalex.org/W2109717569,"The family of approximately 16 genes encoding the mouse ribosomal protein L32 has been characterized by an analysis of a representative set of genomic clones. Surprisingly, this family contains only a single expressed intron-containing gene. This gene, termed rpL32 , has been completely sequenced and found to possess certain novel features including the presence in two of its introns of a sequence with high homology to the 5' end of U1 snRNA and a 5' terminal region exceptionally rich in pyrimidines. Most of the other members of the L32 family appear to be processed genes, some of which are identical or very similar to the rpL32 gene, except for the lack of introns. One unmutated gene was found to be integrated 28 nucleotides downstream of a canonical TATA box. However, despite this feature, the gene does not seem to be expressed, as judged by its extent of methylation compared to the expressed rpL32 gene."
https://openalex.org/W1980092242,"The nucleotide sequence of a partial cDNA for the bovine low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor revealed an open reading frame of 264 amino acids that encodes the COOH-terminal 25% of the receptor protein. The sequence predicts a cytoplasmic domain of 50 amino acids at the COOH terminus, followed in order by a membrane-spanning region of 27 hydrophobic amino acids and an externally disposed stretch of 42 amino acids, that is rich in serine and threonine residues and appears to be the site of O-linked glycosylation. This orientation was confirmed by proteolysis experiments in which the relevant fragments were localized by blotting with anti-peptide antibodies and a galactose-specific lectin. The extracytoplasmic domain of the LDL receptor contains a region that is 38% identical with a 96 amino acid sequence in the precursor to mouse epidermal growth factor (EGF), a peptide hormone. This unexpected homology raises the possibility that proteins involved in growth stimulation (e.g., EGF precursor) and nutrient delivery (e.g., LDL receptor) may have a common evolutionary origin."
https://openalex.org/W2126120030,"We describe and characterize a complex reaction that catalyzes DNA supercoiling and chromatin assembly in vitro. A Xenopus oocyte extract supplemented with ATP and Mg++ converts DNA circles into minichromosomes that display a native, 200 bp periodicity. When supercoiled DNA is added to this extract it undergoes a time-dependent series of topological changes, which precisely mimic those found when the DNA is microinjected into oocytes. As judged by the conformation of the subsequently deproteinized DNA, the supercoiled DNA is first relaxed, in a reaction that takes 4 min, and then it is resupercoiled in a slower process that takes 4 hr. The relaxation is partially inhibited by EDTA, to an extent that suggests that that it is catalyzed by a type I DNA topoisomerase. The resupercoiling , on the other hand, requires ATP and Mg++, is completely inhibited by EDTA, and is inhibited by novobiocin in a manner that suggests it is catalyzed by a type II DNA topoisomerase. These findings, and the ones reported in the preceding paper ( Ryoji and Worcel , 1984), lead us to propose that chromatin assembly is an active, ATP-driven process."
https://openalex.org/W2025203479,"Approximately 50% of tumors induced by mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) contain an acquired provirus within a limited region of chromosomal DNA, termed int-2. We have extended our previous characterization of this locus and have mapped provirus integration sites in 21 independent tumors. Although integration occurs at multiple sites, proviruses within int-2 are distributed into two oppositely oriented groups whose transcription is directed away from a central domain. Provirus insertion in int-2 is accompanied by expression of RNA derived, at least in part, from this central domain. Since the RNA is not detected in normal mammary tissue, we conclude that MMTV integration activates the expression of a cellular gene within int-2 and that this event may contribute to tumorigenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1970863559,"We describe a region of human DNA containing four metallothionein (hMT) genes. One of these genes, hMT-IA, was found to encode a functional protein that confers heavy metal resistance to NIH 3T3 cells after transfer on a bovine papilloma virus-derived vector. This gene is expressed in cultured human cell lines, but at a lower basal level than the hMT-IIA gene; it shows a different induction response to heavy metals and glucocorticoids than the hMT-IIA gene. Induction of the human MT family therefore does not represent an equivalent elevation in the level of expression of individual genes, but is the sum of the differential responses of active members. The differential response is due to functional differences of the respective promoter/regulatory regions of the genes as shown by gene-fusion experiments. While the hMT-IIA promoter is responsive to Cd++, Zn++, and glucocorticoids, the hMT-IA promoter mediates response only to Cd++."
https://openalex.org/W1981221383,"We have determined the nucleotide sequence of the transposable maize controlling element Activator (Ac). The Ac element is 4563 bp long and has an imperfect terminal repetition of 11 bp. The element contains two open reading frames (ORF) encoding polypeptides of 839 and 210 amino acids. Evidence derived from structural analysis of a closely related, but transposition-defective Dissociation (Ds) element indicates that the large ORF is the structural gene for a trans-acting function required for transposition. The two ORFs diverge from a short intergenic region which contains characteristic eucaryotic transcription initiation sequences."
https://openalex.org/W1606138580,"Using cultured GH1 cells, we reported that stimulation (3- to 5-fold) of growth hormone synthesis and mRNA levels by thyroid hormone is mediated by a chromatin-associated receptor. Thyroid hormone also elicits a rapid reduction of homologous receptor in GH1 cells primarily by decreasing the synthetic rate of receptor ( Raaka , B. M., and Samuels , H. H. (1981) J. Biol. Chem. 256, 6883-6889). Without 3,5,3'-triiodo-L-thyronine (L-T3), glucocorticoid agonists induced a limited and delayed effect while L-T3 + glucocorticoid synergistically stimulated the response an additional 2- to 4-fold compared to L-T3. In this study, we utilized GC cells, a related cell line, to compare the abundance of L-T3-receptor complexes to the rate of growth hormone mRNA synthesis and gene transcription. Gene transcription was assessed by in vitro labeling of nuclei with [alpha-32P]UTP which were derived from cells incubated with hormone(s), while mRNA synthesis was determined in intact cells by [3H]uridine labeling. Labeled growth hormone mRNA and gene transcripts were quantitated by filter hybridization to plasmid containing growth hormone cDNA. L-T3 rapidly decreased receptor levels in GC cells with kinetics similar to that in GH1 cells. Both the L-T3 and the synergistic L-T3 + glucocorticoid stimulation of growth hormone mRNA synthesis changed in parallel with the level of L-T3-receptor complexes. Glucocorticoid hormones alone elicited a variable response which resulted in minimal stimulation or inhibition of growth hormone mRNA synthesis or gene transcription rates. No apparent lag was identified between the kinetics of L-T3 binding to receptor and stimulation of growth hormone gene transcription. L-T3 stimulated growth hormone gene transcription rates maximally in 1 h which then progressively decreased in parallel with L-T3-receptor levels. Using [3H]uridine pulse-chase, growth hormone mRNA was found to have a half-life of approximately 50 h in agreement with the decay curve of growth hormone production of deinduced cells. Our studies suggest that regulation of the growth hormone response is predominantly determined by positive control of growth hormone gene transcription which is proportional to the concentration of thyroid hormone-receptor complexes."
https://openalex.org/W1592783225,"The hydroxyl radical-mediated oxidation of 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide, benzene, ketomethiolbutyric acid, deoxyribose, and ethanol, as well as superoxide anion and hydrogen peroxide formation was quantitated in reconstituted membrane vesicle systems containing purified rabbit liver microsomal NADPH-cytochrome P-450 reductase and cytochromes P-450 LM2, P-450 LMeb , or P-450 LM4, and in vesicle systems devoid of cytochrome P-450. The presence of cytochrome P-450 in the membranes resulted in 4-8-fold higher rates of O-2, H2O2, and hydroxyl radical production, indicating that the oxycytochrome P-450 complex constitutes the major source for superoxide anions liberated in the system, giving as a consequence hydrogen peroxide and also, subsequently, hydroxyl radicals formed in an iron-catalyzed Haber-Weiss reaction. Depletion of contaminating iron in the incubation systems resulted in small or negligible rates of cytochrome P-450-dependent ethanol oxidation. However, small amounts (1 microM) of chelated iron (e.g. Fe3+-EDTA) enhanced ethanol oxidation specifically when membranes containing the ethanol and benzene-inducible form of cytochrome P-450 (cytochrome P-450 LMeb ) were used. Introduction of the Fe-EDTA complex into P-450 LMeb -containing incubation systems caused a decrease in hydrogen peroxide formation and a concomitant 6-fold increase in acetaldehyde production; consequently, the rate of NADPH consumption was not affected. In iron-depleted systems containing cytochrome P-450 LM2 or cytochrome P-450 LMeb , an appropriate stoichiometry was attained between the NADPH consumed and the sum of hydrogen peroxide and acetaldehyde produced. Horseradish peroxidase and scavengers of hydroxyl radicals inhibited the cytochrome P-450 LMeb -dependent ethanol oxidation both in the presence and in the absence of Fe-EDTA. The results are not consistent with a specific mechanism for cytochrome P-450-dependent ethanol oxidation and indicate that hydroxyl radicals, formed in an iron-catalyzed Haber-Weiss reaction and in a Fenton reaction, constitute the active oxygen species. Cytochrome P-450-dependent ethanol oxidation under in vivo conditions would, according to this concept, require the presence of non-heme iron and endogenous iron chelators."
https://openalex.org/W2005498658,"A sequence closely linked to the Saccharomyces cerevisiae HO gene confers autonomous replication in yeast. I have subjected this putative replication origin to deletion and point mutagenesis in order to identify structural features that are important requirements for autonomous replication in vivo. This analysis identifies a 14 bp core region, which is crucial for function and shows partial sequence conservation between a number of autonomously replicating sequences. Point mutations within the core region can abolish autonomous replication. The core region is flanked on one side by a sequence of about 20 bp, which is important for efficient autonomous replication. Deletion of this flanking sequence reduces, but does not necessarily eliminate, autonomous replication."
https://openalex.org/W2081271027,We describe the molecular cloning of the human transferrin receptor gene by a gene transfer approach. Mouse Ltk- cells were cotransformed with the herpes simplex thymidine kinase gene and total human DNA. Transformants expressing human transferrin receptor were isolated by selection on hypoxanthine/aminopterin/thymidine (HAT) medium and fluorescence-activated cell sorting of HAT-resistant cells. Thirty-four kilobases of human DNA was isolated by screening a genomic library constructed from the DNA of a secondary transformant. Gene transfer of the cloned DNA established that 31 kb of DNA was sufficient to encode the receptor. A probe from the 5' end of the gene was used to isolate a cDNA clone with an insert of 4.9 kb. Hybridization of the cDNA to the cloned genomic DNA revealed a minimum of 12 exons. They extend over the entire 31 kb of expressing DNA and over 2 kb of adjacent 3' untranslated sequences that are not required for receptor expression in L cells.
https://openalex.org/W2006874407,"Analysis of the subcellular location of the proteins encoded by the oncogenes of avian myeloblastosis virus and avian leukemia virus E26 (p45v-myb and p135gag-myb-ets, respectively) and by the chicken c-myb gene (p75c-myb) shows that all three proteins are located in the nucleus. In AMV-infected (but not transformed) chicken fibroblasts p45v-myb also resides in the nucleus, indicating that a nuclear location of p45v-myb in these cells is not sufficient to achieve transformation. In AMV-transformed mye-loblasts a small fraction of p45v-myb occupies an additional site in the perinuclear region of the cytoplasm. If the myeloblasts are caused to differentiate to macrophages, most of p45v-myb is found in the cytoplasm. This redistribution of p45v-myb within the cell may be responsible for reversion of the transformed phenotype."
https://openalex.org/W2043517704,"Mutations in a cell-cycle gene NDA2 of Schizosaccharomyces pombe have pleiotropic effects on nuclear division, nuclear location, and thiabendazole sensitivity ( Toda et al., 1983). By transformation and nucleotide sequence determination, we identified NDA2 as one of two alpha-tubulin genes present in the genome of S. pombe. Two cloned sequences complemented cold-sensitive and thiabendazole-supersensitive nda2 mutations; one was derived from NDA2 that encodes alpha 1-tubulin, the other from an unidentified locus encoding alpha 2-tubulin. The predicted amino acid sequences showed that the alpha 1- and alpha 2-tubulins had respective residues of 455 and 449 (molecular weights 51,200 and 50,600). The homology to porcine alpha-tubulin was 76% in both cases. Frequent alterations took place in the two restricted regions. The alpha 1-tubulin (NDA2) clone had a 90 bp intervening sequence, the alpha 2-tubulin clone did not. RNA blot hybridization experiments indicated that both genes are transcribed. S. pombe tubulin was isolated by cycles of assembly and disassembly. Presumed alpha- and beta-tubulin polypeptide bands reacted with monoclonal antibodies specific for chicken alpha- and beta-tubulins."
https://openalex.org/W1543525864,"We have utilized purified reactants and cofactors to examine the form of the stimulatory guanine nucleotide-binding regulatory component (Gs) of adenylate cyclase that serves as a substrate for ADP-ribosylation by cholera toxin; we have also investigated some of the consequences of that covalent modification. Activation of Gs with nonhydrolyzable analogs of GTP, which causes dissociation of its subunits, completely inhibits the toxin-catalyzed covalent modification. However, this effect cannot be explained by subunit dissociation, since activation of Gs by fluoride is not inhibitory and ADP ribosylation of the alpha (45,000-Da) subunit of Gs proceeds equally well in the presence and absence of the beta (35,000-Da) subunit. ADP-ribosylation of the alpha subunit of Gs decreases its apparent affinity for the beta subunit; however, the affinity of alpha and ADP-ribosyl-alpha for GTP appear to be approximately the same. ADP-ribosylation of Gs thus promotes the dissociation of its alpha and beta subunits. This effect may account for or contribute to the activation of adenylate cyclase by cholera toxin."

https://openalex.org/W1977470885,"The 130 kd transforming protein of Fujinami sarcoma virus (FSV P130gag -fps) possesses a tyrosine-specific protein kinase activity and is itself phosphorylated at several tyrosine and serine residues in FSV-transformed cells. We have used oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis of the FSV genome to change the TAT codon for tyrosine (1073), the major site of P130gag -fps phosphorylation, to a TTT codon for phenylalanine that cannot be phosphorylated. This mutant FSV induces the transformation of rat-2 cells but with a long latent period as compared with wild-type FSV. The P130gag -fps protein encoded by the mutant retains the ability to phosphorylate tyrosine, but is five times less active as a kinase in vitro than wild-type FSV P130gag -fps. These data indicate that tyrosine phosphorylation stimulates the biochemical and biological activities of FSV P130gag -fps, and they set a precedent for the ability of this amino acid modification to modulate protein function."
https://openalex.org/W1500549443,"Myxothiazol, an antibiotic from Myxococcus fulvus, which inhibits mitochondrial respiration in the bc1 complex of the respiratory chain, has effects on the redox components of isolated succinate-cytochrome c reductase complex which suggest that it interacts with both cytochrome b and the iron-sulfur protein of the bc1 complex. The inhibitor appears to increase the midpoint potentials of cytochromes b-562 and b-566, as indicated by an increase in their reducibility by the succinate/fumarate couple. It also causes a red shift in the optical spectrum of ferrocytochrome b-566, as reported previously (Becker, W. F., Von Jagow , G., Anke , T., Steglisch , W. (1981) FEBS Lett. 132, 329-333). This red shift is enhanced by Triton X-100, and there is no shift in the spectrum of b-562. These results are consistent with evidence that mutations conferring myxothiazol resistance in yeast map to the mitochondrial gene for cytochrome b ( Thierbach , G., and Michaelis, G. (1982) Mol. Gen. Genet. 186, 501-506). In addition, myxothiazol has effects on reduction of the cytochromes b and c1 by succinate or ubiquinol which are identical to those caused by removal of the iron-sulfur protein from the bc1 complex. It blocks reduction of cytochrome c1 during single and multiple turnovers of the bc1 complex, but does not block reduction of the b cytochromes. In the presence of antimycin, it blocks reduction of both cytochromes b and c1. In contrast to antimycin, myxothiazol inhibits oxidant-induced reduction of both b cytochromes and does not inhibit their oxidation by fumarate. Myxothiazol also inhibits reduction of the iron-sulfur protein by ubiquinol and shifts the gx resonance in the EPR spectrum of the iron-sulfur protein from g = 1.79 to 1.76. It does not affect the midpoint potential of the iron-sulfur protein, but does eliminate the increase in midpoint potential which is caused by inhibitory hydroxyquinones which bind to the iron-sulfur protein. The effects of myxothiazol are consistent with a protonmotive Q cycle pathway of electron transfer in which myxothiazol binds to cytochrome b and displaces quinone from the iron-sulfur protein of the bc1 complex. These results suggest either that a myxothiazol-induced conformational change in cytochrome b is transmitted to a quinone binding site on the iron-sulfur protein, or that there is a quinone binding site which consists of peptide domains from both cytochrome b and iron-sulfur protein."
https://openalex.org/W1604834291,"The complete nucleotide sequences of three cloned cDNAs corresponding to human liver apolipoprotein E (apo-E) mRNA were determined. Analysis of the longest cDNA showed that it contained 1157 nucleotides of mRNA sequence with a 5'-terminal nontranslated region of 61 nucleotides, a signal peptide region corresponding to 18 amino acids, a mature protein region corresponding to 299 amino acids, and a 3'-terminal nontranslated region of 142 nucleotides. The inferred amino acid sequences from two cDNAs were identical and corresponded to the amino acid sequence for plasma apo-E3 that has been reported previously ( Rall , S. C., Jr., Weisgraber , K. H., and Mahley , R. W. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257, 4171-4178). The third cDNA differed from the other two cDNAs in five nucleotide positions. Three of these differences occurred in the third nucleotide position of amino acid codons, resulting in no change in the corresponding amino acids at residues Val-85, Ser-223, and Gln-248. The other two altered nucleotides occurred in the first nucleotide position of codons, leading to changes in the amino acids encoded. In the variant sequence, a threonine replaced the normal alanine at residue 99 and a proline replaced the normal alanine at residue 152. We have concluded that the human liver donor was heterozygous for the epsilon 3 genotype. The variant cDNA corresponds to a new, previously undescribed variant form of apo-E in which the amino acid substitutions of the protein are electrophoretically silent; it would probably be undetectable by standard apo-E phenotyping methods. The amino acid substitution at position 152 occurs in a region of apo-E that appears to be important for receptor binding, and it may have clinical significance."
https://openalex.org/W2016878346,"We have characterized a variant Burkitt lymphoma in which translocation joins the immunoglobulin kappa locus on chromosome 2 to the c-myc gene on chromosome 8. This Burkitt lymphoma is especially interesting because, in contrast to the more common lymphomas that carry 8;14 translocations, it carries a translocation that involves a light chain locus and occurs 3' to and at least 20 kb downstream of the c-myc gene. Furthermore, the c-myc gene from the translocated chromosome is abnormally expressed in that there is a characteristic shift in c-myc promoter utilization and an increase in c-myc transcript. These disturbances could be explained by novel structural alterations that occur in the c-myc gene and include a duplication of a 2.5 kb segment of DNA containing the two c-myc promoters and their untranslated leader exons. Interestingly, these alterations arise at a considerable distance from the translocation breakpoint."
https://openalex.org/W2011710311,"We examine the influence of the immunoglobulin locus on the expression of the translocated c-myc oncogene in mouse plasmacytomas. The level of c-myc RNA was 30- 35-fold greater in tumor cells than in normal, quiescent B cells. Mitogen stimulation of the lymphocytes with lipopolysaccharide induced a 15-fold increase in c-myc expression per cell to a level that was similar to that in the transcription of the translocated c-myc gene involved initiation from sequences in the first c-myc intron. Abundant RNA transcripts were also found from the noncoding strand of the c-myc intron in most tumor lines. S1 nuclease mapping was used to locate the intronic sequences that are used to initiate the tumor-specific c-myc RNAs. Six different initiation sites within the intron were mapped, none of which have the TATA sequence usually associated with eucaryotic RNA polymerase II promoters. The noncoding strand transcripts were also found to initiate in the c-myc intron. Transcription of the c-myc coding strand was independent of the position of the translocation breakpoint, even when the heavy chain switch and constant regions were deleted."
https://openalex.org/W1516614567,"Calcineurin possesses phosphatase activity towards both protein (Stewart, A.A., Ingebritsen , T.S., Manalan , A., Klee , C.B., and Cohen, P. (1982) FEBS Lett. 137, 80-84) and nonprotein substrates ( Pallen , C.J., and Wang, J.H. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 8550-8553). These phosphatase activities are divalent cation-dependent and stimulated by calmodulin. We have utilized the nonprotein chromogenic substrate p-nitrophenyl phosphate to investigate the effects of several divalent metal ions on calcineurin activity and have found that Ni2+ is the best activator of calcineurin both in the presence and absence of calmodulin. A slightly less potent activator is Mn2+. Although the mechanisms and extents of activation stimulated by these two metal ions are different, we present evidence to suggest a competition for binding to the enzyme. Pretreatment of calcineurin with either of these two metal ions enhances the activation of calcineurin by Ca2+/calmodulin and may be a physiological mechanism by which calcineurin activity is regulated by Ca2+."
https://openalex.org/W1965593774,"A deletion mutation, malE delta 12-18, removes seven residues from the hydrophobic core of the maltose binding protein (MBP) signal peptide and thus prevents secretion of this protein to the periplasm of E. coli. Intragenic suppressor mutations of malE delta 12-18 have been obtained, some highly efficient in their ability to restore proper MBP export. Twelve independently isolated suppressors represent six unique mutational events. Five result in alterations within the MBP signal peptide; one changes the amino acid at residue 19 of the mature MBP. Analysis of these suppressors indicates that the length of the hydrophobic core is a major determinant of signal peptide function. The experiments further suggest that the hydrophobic core region serves primarily a structural role in mediating protein secretion, and that other sequences outside of this region may be responsible for providing the initial recognition of the MBP nascent chain as a secreted protein."
https://openalex.org/W2052094613,"A novel mutagenesis procedure based on the insertion of a hexameric nucleotide sequence into Rsa I restriction sites of cloned DNA has been applied to a copy of the Fujinami sarcoma virus (FSV) genome with the aim of identifying functional regions in the transforming protein. Mutations specifying peptide insertions in both the NH2- and the COOH-terminal fps-specific portions of the transforming protein reduce or abolish the capacity of the genome to induce transformed foci in rat-2 cells. Insertion of multiple copies of the hexamer into one central position in the oncogene results in dislocation of the NH2- and COOH-terminal regions in the primary structure, but has no inhibitory effect on focus induction. Taken together, the results imply that both the NH2- and COOH-terminal fps-specific portions of the FSV oncogene product possess determinants which function in fibroblast transformation, and that cooperation of these two regions is not sensitive to their separation in the primary structure."

Although nitroreduction occurred in the presence of respiratory substrates such as beta-hydroxybutyrate, malate-glutamate, succinate, or endogenous substrates, nitro anion radical formation activity was much greater on addition of exogenous reduced pyridine nucleotides. NAD(P)H generated from endogenous mitochondrial NAD(P)+ by intramitochondrial reactions could not be used for the NAD(P)H nitroreductase reactions unless the mitochondria were solubilized by detergent. In addition, NAD(P)H nitroreductase activity was detected in the crude mitochondrial outer membrane fraction, with a higher activity than in mitoplasts and intact mitochondria. These results provide direct evidence of a nitrofuran reductase activity associated with the mitochondrial outer membrane that is far more important than that of respiratory chain enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W1564656332,"The effects of biotin upon the intracellular level of cGMP and the activity of glucokinase were examined in primary cultures of adult rat hepatocytes. The addition of biotin to the culture medium of hepatocytes increased their content of cGMP 3-fold within 1 h. A 4-fold increase in the activity of glucokinase was observed in response to the addition of the vitamin to the culture medium and the maximal response was observed 6 h following the addition to the medium. These maximum effects were noted when biotin was present in the culture medium at a concentration of 10(-6) M. The induction of glucokinase activity by biotin was preceded by an increase in the intracellular level of cGMP. The addition of 8-bromo-cGMP to the culture medium also increased the activity of glucokinase and its effects were not additive with respect to the effects of biotin. The induction of glucokinase by biotin or the cyclic nucleotide analog was not observed in the absence of insulin. The effects of biotin upon the activity of glucokinase could be mimicked by including glucose in the culture medium. When hexose utilization by the hepatocytes was blocked by the addition to the culture medium of N-acetylglucosamine, the induction of glucokinase by biotin was unaffected, whereas the induction brought about by glucose was not observed. The changes in the activity of the enzyme brought about by biotin or 8-bromo-cGMP was shown to arise as the result of changes in the rate of synthesis of the enzyme. In addition, using an in vitro translation assay and immunoprecipitation, it was found that biotin and 8-bromo-cGMP increased the amount of translatable mRNA coding for the enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W2133171228,"The complete nucleotide sequence of a mobile element from Trypanosoma brucei is presented along with the sequence of its target site, which shows that the insertion has generated a 7 base pair direct repeat. The cloned copy of the element is a dimeric structure, one end of each monomer consisting of a stretch of 14 A residues preceded by a putative trypanosome polyadenylation signal. Six base pairs of DNA of unknown origin are found in the dimer between the two copies of the element. Evidence suggests that the element is present in the genome mainly as a monomer whose sequence is conserved across several species of trypanosome. The element contains an open reading frame encoding the same 160 amino acid protein in both sequenced copies and is extensively transcribed from both strands."
https://openalex.org/W2092785836,"Various maturation forms of the plant protein thaumatin were expressed in yeast, using a promoter fragment of the glyceraldehyde- 3P -dehydrogenase (GAPDH) gene. Plasmids encoding preprothaumatin were shown to direct the synthesis of a processed form of the plant protein. The important role of signal sequences in the expression of the plant protein in yeast was indicated by the observation that plasmids encoding processed thaumatin forms were only poorly expressed, if at all. Nucleotide sequence analysis of the 843 nucleotide GAPDH promoter fragment revealed a characteristic structure with two regions of dyad symmetry containing translational starts of GAPDH and a putative 38 amino acid peptide. A promoter fragment from which the upstream region was deleted proved to be less efficient in thaumatin expression."
https://openalex.org/W1533385963,"The distribution of proteases potentially reactive with peptide sequences containing pairs of basic amino acids or single basic amino acids was studied in subcellular fractions of a transplantable rat insulinoma using the affinity probes 125I-Tyr-Ala-Lys- ArgCH2Cl and 125I-Tyr-Ala-norleucine- ArgCH2Cl . Both probes labeled predominantly proteins of Mr = 39,000, 31,500, and 25,000. The Mr = 25,000 component appeared to be of lysosomal origin, while the Mr = 39,000 and 31,500 proteins were present in both the lysosomes and insulin granules. The Mr = 39,000 and 31,500 proteins were identified as precursor/product forms of the cysteine protease cathepsin B, while assays performed with fluorigenic peptide substrates suggested that the Mr = 25,000 protein was probably cathepsin L and/or H. The greater reactivity of the Mr = 39,000 form with the dibasic probe suggests that the relative proportions of the Mr = 39,000 and 31,500 forms of cathepsin B in different organelles may determine the extent to which the enzyme expresses activity as a specific (prohormone processing) endopeptidase or a more general (degradative) peptidase."
https://openalex.org/W1555716918,"Human factor I is a two-chain plasma glycoprotein composed of disulfide-linked 50,000- and 38,000-dalton subunits. Analysis of its biosynthesis and postsynthetic processing demonstrated that factor I is synthesized as a single chain precursor (pro-I) that undergoes glycosylation and limited proteolysis to generate the native protein. One of three human hepatoma cell lines, HepG2 , secreted factor I predominantly (70-90%) in a single chain pro-I form. The other cell lines secrete factor I predominantly in its two chain native form. The defect in conversion of pro-I to I in HepG2 was protein specific since other multichain proteins, derived from single chain precursors, the third, fourth, and fifth components of complement were processed normally. Further analysis of the inefficient pro-I to I conversion by HepG2 revealed that Xenopus oocytes injected with HepG2 mRNA secreted factor I in a predominantly two-chain form. In addition, the apparent sizes of native factor I, transferrin, and alpha-1-antitrypsin secreted by the three hepatoma lines differed due to differences in postsynthetic processing."
https://openalex.org/W1551032490,"Electron paramagnetic resonance studies of the Fe2+- and Fe3+-adriamycin complexes are reported which demonstrate iron-mediated reduction of O2 by adriamycin. Under anaerobic conditions, Fe2+ binds to adriamycin, giving rise to an EPR-silent Fe2+-adriamycin complex. On addition of O2, the Fe2+ is oxidized to Fe3+ and a spectrum of Fe3+-adriamycin is seen. Under anaerobic conditions, the signal of Fe3+-adriamycin decreases as a function of time as the Fe3+ bound to adriamycin is reduced to Fe2+, and a transient spectrum of iron bound to oxidized adriamycin is observed. On addition of O2, the EPR signal of Fe3+-adriamycin returns as Fe2+ is oxidized back to Fe3+ with electron transfer to O2. This cycle of iron-catalyzed O2 reduction may be the mechanism of adriamycin's antitumor potency and some of its toxic side effects."
https://openalex.org/W2130452759,"Influenza virus-specific proteins are synthesized at essentially the same levels in late adenovirus-infected HeLa cells as in cells not infected with adenovirus, indicating that influenza viral mRNA escapes the blocks exerted by adenovirus against host-cell mRNA expression-transport from the nucleus and translation. A significant proportion of the influenza viral mRNAs synthesized in these cells possesses the 5' ends of the major late adenovirus transcripts, resulting from capped RNA-primed initiation of influenza viral mRNA synthesis. We determined whether the ability of influenza viral mRNA to escape from the adenovirus-imposed blocks is due to utilization of the adenovirus-specific transport and translational systems because of the adenovirus 5' ends on the influenza viral mRNAs, or to establishment of influenza virus-specific transport and translational systems. Our results indicate that the second mechanism is operating, as the transport of influenza viral mRNAs from the nucleus and their translation is independent of the presence of adenovirus 5' ends. Furthermore, efficient translation of influenza viral mRNAs, but not of either adenovirus or host mRNAs, occurs in cells infected by the adenovirus deletion mutant dl331 , which does not synthesize VAI RNA ( Thimmappaya et al., 1982). Consequently, utilizing the translational machinery that had been inactivated by adenovirus, influenza virus establishes a system that selectively translates influenza viral mRNAs."
https://openalex.org/W2048745832,"We describe a highly polymorphic gene family from the protozoan parasite Babesia bovis that encodes a complex pattern of transcripts. Gene rearrangements at this locus (designated BabR ) have generated RNA species that differ in sequence. The naturally occurring virulent field isolate Kv expresses two different sized transcripts that are identical in sequence at their 5' ends but different at the 3' ends. An avirulent derivative of this isolate, Ka, expresses not only these two transcripts but a third, of intermediate size. Analysis of cloned genomic fragments from Ka identified genes encoding all three transcripts. Two fragments contained tandemly repeated copies of the BabR genes. The gene encoding the intermediate sized transcript has undergone a rearrangement, substituting a 5' region different to that shared by the other transcripts. These results suggest that sequence diversity may play an important role in the biological function of the BabR locus."
https://openalex.org/W2061689013,"Using gapped circular DNA and homologous duplex DNA cut with restriction nucleases, we show that E. coli RecA protein promotes strand exchanges past double-strand breaks. The products of strand exchange are heteroduplex DNA molecules that contain nicks, which can be sealed by DNA ligase, thereby effecting the repair of double-strand breaks in vitro. These results show that RecA protein can promote pairing interactions between homologous DNA molecules at regions where both are duplex. Moreover, pairing leads to strand exchanges and the formation of heteroduplex DNA. In contrast, strand exchanges are unable to pass a double-strand break in the gapped substrate. This apparent paradox is discussed in terms of a model for RecA-DNA interactions in which we propose that each RecA monomer contains two nonequivalent DNA-binding sites."
https://openalex.org/W2004178184,"Cyp cells are permissive murine cells carrying a thermosensitive polyoma virus genome that remains integrated at 39 degrees C, but is effectively excised and replicated after transfer to 33 degrees C. In rare subclones of the Cyp line, temperature shift-down yields predominantly homogeneous populations of chimeric molecules that appear to reflect the circularization of defined segments of DNA spanning one of the junctions between the integrated viral genome and the adjacent cellular DNA. Such accurate and frequent excision requires a specific recombination mechanism. We examined both the cellular and the viral sequences that cross-over to generate one of these chimeric molecules, Rm I. The homology at the cross-over site is one of 1 or 2 base pairs at most; patches of homology, amounting in total to 19 or 20 base pairs, are found in perfect register on both sides of this site; and the two stretches of DNA that are joined to form RM I contain similar 12-14 base pair sequences (5'- CTCCTTTACAGAGG -3' and 5'- CTCCTTTCAAGG -3') in opposite orientations."
https://openalex.org/W1661680566,"Analysis of DNA from the beta-globin gene cluster in an Albanian family identified a novel RsaI site approximately 550 base pairs 5‘ to the beta-globin gene. In this family, two chromosomes carrying otherwise identical beta-globin haplotypes were found to differ at the RsaI site. Population screening demonstrated the presence and absence of the site in DNA from individuals of northern European, Mediterranean, Middle Eastern, Southeast Asian, African, and Asian Indian descent, indicating that this site is a DNA polymorphism common in many ethnic groups. The polymorphism is also present in DNA from individuals carrying different beta-globin alleles. Additional nucleotide sequence changes identified in an RsaI (+) genomic clone in the region immediately 3‘ to the RsaI site suggest a mechanism for the randomization of the site with respect to haplotype."
https://openalex.org/W1596725514,"We have determined the nucleotide sequence of a 1075-base-pair HindIII fragment of the T4 phage genome. This fragment contains the structural gene (frd) for dihydrofolate reductase and part of the gene (td) encoding thymidylate synthase. The fragment contains a 579-base-pair open reading frame, encoding a 193-residue polypeptide with a calculated mass of 21,603 Da, in agreement with our reported subunit molecular mass of 23,000. The deduced amino acid sequence shows partial homology with other dihydrofolate reductases, with most of the identities lying in regions known to be involved in substrate binding and catalysis. The 3' end of the coding strand overlaps the coding region for thymidylate synthase; the sequence - ATGA -includes an opal terminator for the frd gene and an initiating triplet for the td gene. The deduced amino acid sequence from this initiating ATG is identical, for the first 20 residues, with the NH2-terminal 20 residues reported for the td protein (M. Belfort , A. Moelleken , G. F. Maley , and F. Maley (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 2045-2051). The sequenced HindIII fragment was transferred into a high expression plasmid vector for large scale production of homogeneous T4 dihydrofolate reductase. The experimentally determined sequence of 20 residues at the NH2-terminus of this protein is identical with that deduced from the nucleotide sequence for T4 dihydrofolate reductase."
https://openalex.org/W1490054248,"A 7- dimethylaminocoumarin -4-acetate fluorescent derivative of toxin II from the venom of the scorpion Centruroides suffusus suffusus (Css II) has been prepared to study the structural, conformational, and cellular properties of the beta-neurotoxin receptor site on the voltage-dependent sodium channel. The derivative retains high affinity for its receptor site on the synaptosomal sodium channel with a KD of 7 nM and site capacity of 1.5 pmol/mg of synaptosomal protein. The fluorescent toxin is very environmentally sensitive and the fluorescence emission upon binding indicates that the Css II receptor is largely hydrophobic. Binding of tetrodotoxin or batrachotoxin does not alter the spectroscopic properties of bound Css II, whereas toxin V from Leiurus quinquestriatus effects a 10-nm blue shift to a more hydrophobic environment. This is the first direct indication of conformational coupling between these separate neurotoxin receptor sites. The distance between the tetrodotoxin and Css II scorpion toxin receptors on the sodium channel was measured by fluorescence resonance energy transfer. Efficiencies were measured by both donor quenching and acceptor-sensitized emission. The distance between these two neurotoxin sites is about 34 A. The implications of these receptor locations together with other known molecular distances are discussed in terms of a molecular structure of the voltage-dependent sodium channel."
https://openalex.org/W1557394940,"A 453-base pair DNA duplex consisting of a gene coding for human interferon-gamma and initiation and termination signals plus appropriate restriction enzyme sites for plasmid insertion has been totally synthesized. The synthesis involved preparation of 66 oligodeoxynucleotides by a modified, solid phase phosphite procedure and enzymatic ligation of the oligonucleotides. The gene, when inserted into a previously constructed expression vector, was expressed in Escherichia coli, demonstrating functional activity for the synthetic gene. Several strategically located restriction cleavage sites have been introduced into the sequence. This provides a convenient system for site-specific mutagenesis for structure-function studies."
https://openalex.org/W2050958687,"The S region of the murine major histocompatibility complex contains two related genes (C4-X and C4-Y), one of which encodes the fourth component of complement (C4). We have introduced cloned C4-X and C4-Y genes into L cells. C4-X transfectants contained no detectable C4-related RNA, whereas C4-Y transfectants contained large amounts of C4-related RNA. Culture supernatants of C4-Y transfectants contained processed C4 which was indistinguishable from macrophage-derived C4. The L-cell-derived C4 restored hemolytic activity to C4-deficient serum, served as a substrate for C1s, and underwent autolytic cleavage suggesting the presence of an intramolecular thiolester bond. These experiments identify C4-Y as the functional C4 gene in H-2d mice and indicate that L cells can process pro-C4 correctly."
https://openalex.org/W1528787522,"The cellular actions of the thyroid hormones L-thyroxine and L-triiodothyronine are mediated by the association of hormone with a chromatin-associated receptor. In cultured GH1 cells, a hormone-responsive rat pituitary cell line, thyroid hormone decreases the concentration of its receptor at early incubation times by reducing the accumulation of newly synthesized receptor. In this study, we demonstrate that cholera toxin also reduces the amount of nuclear receptor in GH1 cells in a time- and dose-dependent fashion, without altering the affinity of the receptor for hormone. The reduction of receptor mediated by cholera toxin is not secondary to a generalized inhibition of cell protein synthesis or cell replication rates and this effect can be abolished by pretreatment of the cholera toxin with soluble ganglioside II3-alpha-N- acetylneuraminosylgangliotetraosylceramide . This effect requires an intact cholera toxin molecule and does not occur at similar concentrations of the membrane-binding B subunit of cholera toxin. In order to study the influence of cholera toxin on thyroid hormone receptor turnover, we have used a dense amino acid-labeling technique. The results indicate that cholera toxin does not change the half-life of receptor, but decreases the rate of appearance of newly synthesized receptor. This decreased rate completely accounts for the lowered steady state receptor levels. The extent of cAMP stimulation by cholera toxin does not correlate with the extent of receptor reduction and forskolin, which stimulates cAMP 25- to 500-fold, does not decrease thyroid hormone receptor abundance. These studies suggest that cholera toxin modulates receptor levels by a mechanism(s) that is not mediated by cAMP in GH1 cells."
https://openalex.org/W1617935550,"The refolding of urea-denatured horse heart ferricytochrome c in the presence of imidazole, 0.5 M, pH 7.0, has been examined using stopped-flow and equilibrium measurements at 407.5 nm. Thermodynamically, imidazole-cytochrome c folds and unfolds via a single transition with [urea]1/2 of 5.9 M. Kinetically, the refolding is a triphasic process: (i) a slow, urea-independent phase, time constant of 22 +/- 6 s, and an amplitude of 10-13%; (ii) an intermediate reaction, with a slightly positive urea-dependent rate constant, average time constant of 150 ms; and (iii) a fast phase with negative urea dependence of the rate constant from 4-6 M urea and positive dependence above the 6 M concentration, with the largest time constant, 25 +/- 6 ms, at 5.8 M urea, the midpoint of the transition. The amplitudes of the intermediate and the fast phases exhibit inverse dependence on the final urea concentrations, favoring the intermediate form at higher concentrations, while maintaining an almost constant sum of the two amplitudes throughout the range. The temperature dependence of the three apparent rate constants for the refolding from denatured base-line to midpoint of the transition, 9 to 6.03 M urea, yields linear Arrhenius plots with activation energies of 14, 19, and 23 +/- 3 kcal/mol for the slow, intermediate, and rapid reactions, respectively. These findings show that the slow reaction, time constant in decaseconds , does not require, directly or indirectly, the coordination of Met-80-S to heme iron. The formation of this linkage during the folding of the urea-denatured protein in the absence of extrinsic ligand, however, does alter the course of the refolding process. From a comparison of the proposed mechanisms and of the kinetic parameters for the folding of urea-denatured and of guanidine hydrochloride-denatured ferricytochrome c, it has been suggested that the two systems are distinct in detail, although both systems exhibit the slow, decasecond process."
https://openalex.org/W1514406915,"A fluorescent N- methylanthraniloyl derivative of the potent depolarizing agent batrachotoxin has been used to probe the structural and conformational properties of the neurotoxin receptor site on the voltage-dependent sodium channel. Batrachotoxin A 20-alpha-N- methylanthranilate (BTX-NMA) retains high affinity for its receptor site on the synaptosomal sodium channel with a Kd between 78 and 91 nM and an average site capacity of 2 pmol/mg of synaptosomal protein in the presence of Leiurus quinquestriatus quinquestriatus alpha-scorpion toxin. The fluorescence emission of BTX-NMA upon binding to synaptosomes indicates a hydrophobic environment. Toxin V from L. quinquestriatus, an allosteric activator, effects a 20-nm red shift in the spectrum of bound BTX-NMA and a 4-fold enhancement in the fluorescence quantum yield disclosing a conformational change into a hydrophilic environment. Fluorescence resonance energy transfer measurements show that the distance separating the receptor sites is 37 +/- 10 A. Thus, the binding of alpha-scorpion toxin must involve conformational changes that extend over large distances from the batrachotoxin-binding locus. This information together with the distance measurements between the tetrodotoxin and alpha-scorpion toxin receptors and the conformational transition associated with this distance upon batrachotoxin addition indicate a conformationally flexible channel with coupling of sites through the polyatomic framework of individual subunits or through extensive alterations in subunit/subunit interactions."
https://openalex.org/W1524439289,"To investigate the amino acid sequence of apocytochrome c recognized by yeast mitochondrial cytochrome c synthetase, a labeled apofragment containing residues 1 to 25 of horse cytochrome c, N alpha-[3H]acetyl-(1-25), and an analog containing glycine in place of cysteines 14 and 17, N alpha-[3H]acetyl-[14-Gly, 17-Gly] (1-25), have been synthesized using the Merrifield's improved solid phase method (Mitchell, A. R., Ericksen , B. W., Ryabtsev , M. N., Hodges , R. S., and Merrifield, R. B. (1976) J. Am. Chem. Soc. 98, 7357-7362) and then purified to homogeneity. Upon incubation with yeast mitochondria in the presence of hemin, a radioactive species, produced from N alpha-[3H]acetyl-(1-25) and not from N alpha-acetyl-[14-Gly, 17-Gly] (1-25), formed a complex with native apofragment (23-104). This semisynthetic complex was indistinguishable from the native complex in resistance to trypsin upon reduction with ascorbate and by ion-exchange chromatography. The radioactive species, dissociated from the complex was identical with native heme fragment N alpha-acetyl-(1-25)H by reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography. Treatment of this radioactive heme fragment with silver sulfate and then with dithiothreitol generated the original apofragment . Thus, if it is assumed that the mitochondrial enzyme catalyzing this covalent attachment of heme to synthetic apo-N alpha-[3H]acetyl-(1-25) is a cytochrome c synthetase, the results may be interpreted as indicating that the amino acid sequence of residues 1 to 25 of horse cytochrome c would contain the principal recognition site of the enzyme."
