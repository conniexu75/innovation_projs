https://openalex.org/W4225278475,"Despite the emergence of experimental methods for simultaneous measurement of multiple omics modalities in single cells, most single-cell datasets include only one modality. A major obstacle in integrating omics data from multiple modalities is that different omics layers typically have distinct feature spaces. Here, we propose a computational framework called GLUE (graph-linked unified embedding), which bridges the gap by modeling regulatory interactions across omics layers explicitly. Systematic benchmarking demonstrated that GLUE is more accurate, robust and scalable than state-of-the-art tools for heterogeneous single-cell multi-omics data. We applied GLUE to various challenging tasks, including triple-omics integration, integrative regulatory inference and multi-omics human cell atlas construction over millions of cells, where GLUE was able to correct previous annotations. GLUE features a modular design that can be flexibly extended and enhanced for new analysis tasks. The full package is available online at https://github.com/gao-lab/GLUE ."
https://openalex.org/W4225272983,"Many spatially resolved transcriptomic technologies do not have single-cell resolution but measure the average gene expression for each spot from a mixture of cells of potentially heterogeneous cell types. Here, we introduce a deconvolution method, conditional autoregressive-based deconvolution (CARD), that combines cell-type-specific expression information from single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) with correlation in cell-type composition across tissue locations. Modeling spatial correlation allows us to borrow the cell-type composition information across locations, improving accuracy of deconvolution even with a mismatched scRNA-seq reference. CARD can also impute cell-type compositions and gene expression levels at unmeasured tissue locations to enable the construction of a refined spatial tissue map with a resolution arbitrarily higher than that measured in the original study and can perform deconvolution without an scRNA-seq reference. Applications to four datasets, including a pancreatic cancer dataset, identified multiple cell types and molecular markers with distinct spatial localization that define the progression, heterogeneity and compartmentalization of pancreatic cancer."
https://openalex.org/W4225284570,"Improved understanding of genetic regulation of the proteome can facilitate identification of the causal mechanisms for complex traits. We analyzed data on 4,657 plasma proteins from 7,213 European American (EA) and 1,871 African American (AA) individuals from the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities study, and further replicated findings on 467 AA individuals from the African American Study of Kidney Disease and Hypertension study. Here, we identified 2,004 proteins in EA and 1,618 in AA, with most overlapping, which showed associations with common variants in cis-regions. Availability of AA samples led to smaller credible sets and notable number of population-specific cis-protein quantitative trait loci. Elastic Net produced powerful models for protein prediction in both populations. An application of proteome-wide association studies to serum urate and gout implicated several proteins, including IL1RN, revealing the promise of the drug anakinra to treat acute gout flares. Our study demonstrates the value of large and diverse ancestry study to investigate the genetic mechanisms of molecular phenotypes and their relationship with complex traits."

https://openalex.org/W4225270967,"Interactions between the immune and central nervous systems strongly influence brain health. Although the blood-brain barrier restricts this crosstalk, we now know that meningeal gateways through brain border tissues facilitate intersystem communication. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), which interfaces with the glymphatic system and thereby drains the brain's interstitial and perivascular spaces, facilitates outward signaling beyond the blood-brain barrier. In the present study, we report that CSF can exit into the skull bone marrow. Fluorescent tracers injected into the cisterna magna of mice migrate along perivascular spaces of dural blood vessels and then travel through hundreds of sub-millimeter skull channels into the calvarial marrow. During meningitis, bacteria hijack this route to invade the skull's hematopoietic niches and initiate cranial hematopoiesis ahead of remote tibial sites. As skull channels also directly provide leukocytes to meninges, the privileged sampling of brain-derived danger signals in CSF by regional marrow may have broad implications for inflammatory neurological disorders."
https://openalex.org/W4225276718,"Activity-dependent myelination can fine-tune neural network dynamics. Conversely, aberrant neuronal activity, as occurs in disorders of recurrent seizures (epilepsy), could promote maladaptive myelination, contributing to pathogenesis. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that activity-dependent myelination resulting from absence seizures, which manifest as frequent behavioral arrests with generalized electroencephalography (EEG) spike-wave discharges, promote thalamocortical network hypersynchrony and contribute to epilepsy progression. We found increased oligodendrogenesis and myelination specifically within the seizure network in two models of generalized epilepsy with absence seizures (Wag/Rij rats and Scn8a+/mut mice), evident only after epilepsy onset. Aberrant myelination was prevented by pharmacological seizure inhibition in Wag/Rij rats. Blocking activity-dependent myelination decreased seizure burden over time and reduced ictal synchrony as assessed by EEG coherence. These findings indicate that activity-dependent myelination driven by absence seizures contributes to epilepsy progression; maladaptive myelination may be pathogenic in some forms of epilepsy and other neurological diseases."
https://openalex.org/W4229376712,"The bioconvection flow of tiny fluid conveying the nanoparticles has been investigated between two concentric cylinders. The contribution of Lorenz force is also focused to inspect the bioconvection thermal transport of tiny particles. The tiny particles are assumed to flow between two concentric cylinders of different radii. The first cylinder remains at rest while flow is induced due to second cylinder which rotates with uniform velocity. Furthermore, the movement of tiny particles follows the principle of thermophoresis and Brownian motion as a part of thermal and mass gradient. Similarly, the gyro-tactic microorganisms swim in the nanofluid as a response to the density gradient and constitute bio-convection. The problem is modeled by using the certain laws. The numerical outcomes are computed by using RKF -45 method. The graphical simulations are performed for flow parameters with specific range like 1≤Re≤5, 1≤Ha≤5, 0.5≤Nt≤2.5, 1≤Nb≤3, 0.2≤Sc≤1.8, 0.2≤Pe≤1.0 and 0.2≤Ω≤1.0. It is observed that the flow velocity decreases with the increase in the Hartmann number that signifies the magnetic field. This outcome indicates that the flow velocity can be controlled externally through the magnetic field. Also, the increase in the Schmidt numbers increases the nanoparticle concentration and the motile density."
https://openalex.org/W4225287501,"Despite breakthroughs in cancer immunotherapy, most tumor-reactive T cells cannot persist in solid tumors due to an immunosuppressive environment. We developed Tres (tumor-resilient T cell), a computational model utilizing single-cell transcriptomic data to identify signatures of T cells that are resilient to immunosuppressive signals, such as transforming growth factor-β1, tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand and prostaglandin E2. Tres reliably predicts clinical responses to immunotherapy in melanoma, lung cancer, triple-negative breast cancer and B cell malignancies using bulk T cell transcriptomic data from pre-treatment tumors from patients who received immune-checkpoint inhibitors (n = 38), infusion products for chimeric antigen receptor T cell therapies (n = 34) and pre-manufacture samples for chimeric antigen receptor T cell or tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte therapies (n = 84). Further, Tres identified FIBP, whose functions are largely unknown, as the top negative marker of tumor-resilient T cells across many solid tumor types. FIBP knockouts in murine and human donor CD8+ T cells significantly enhanced T cell-mediated cancer killing in in vitro co-cultures. Further, Fibp knockout in murine T cells potentiated the in vivo efficacy of adoptive cell transfer in the B16 tumor model. Fibp knockout T cells exhibit reduced cholesterol metabolism, which inhibits effector T cell function. These results demonstrate the utility of Tres in identifying biomarkers of T cell effectiveness and potential therapeutic targets for immunotherapies in solid tumors."
https://openalex.org/W4225269248,"Midbrain dopamine (DA) and serotonin (5-HT) neurons regulate motivated behaviors, including feeding, but less is known about how these circuits may interact. In this study, we found that DA neurons in the mouse ventral tegmental area bidirectionally regulate the activity of 5-HT neurons in the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN), with weaker stimulation causing DRD2-dependent inhibition and overeating, while stronger stimulation causing DRD1-dependent activation and anorexia. Furthermore, in the activity-based anorexia (ABA) paradigm, which is a mouse model mimicking some clinical features of human anorexia nervosa (AN), we observed a DRD2 to DRD1 shift of DA neurotransmission on 5-HTDRN neurons, which causes constant activation of these neurons and contributes to AN-like behaviors. Finally, we found that systemic administration of a DRD1 antagonist can prevent anorexia and weight loss in ABA. Our results revealed regulation of feeding behavior by stimulation strength-dependent interactions between DA and 5-HT neurons, which may contribute to the pathophysiology of AN. The authors show that stimulus strength-dependent effects of DA on 5-HTDRN neurons bidirectionally regulate feeding in mice. DRD1-mediated activation of 5-HTDRN neurons contributes to activity-based anorexia, and this can be prevented by blocking DRD1."
https://openalex.org/W4225420758,"The COVID-19 pandemic declared by the WHO has affected many countries rendering everyday lives halted. In the Philippines, the lockdown quarantine protocols have shifted the traditional college classes to online. The abrupt transition to online classes may bring psychological effects to college students due to continuous isolation and lack of interaction with fellow students and teachers. Our study aims to assess Filipino college students' mental health status and to estimate the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic, the shift to online learning, and social media use on mental health. In addition, facilitators or stressors that modified the mental health status of the college students during the COVID-19 pandemic, quarantine, and subsequent shift to online learning will be investigated.Mixed-method study design will be used, which will involve: (1) an online survey to 2,100 college students across the Philippines; and (2) randomly selected 20-40 key informant interviews (KIIs). Online self-administered questionnaire (SAQ) including Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS-21) and Brief-COPE will be used. Moreover, socio-demographic factors, social media usage, shift to online learning factors, family history of mental health and COVID-19, and other factors that could affect mental health will also be included in the SAQ. KIIs will explore factors affecting the student's mental health, behaviors, coping mechanism, current stressors, and other emotional reactions to these stressors. Associations between mental health outcomes and possible risk factors will be estimated using generalized linear models, while a thematic approach will be made for the findings from the KIIs. Results of the study will then be triangulated and summarized.Our study has been approved by the University of the Philippines Manila Research Ethics Board (UPMREB 2021-099-01). The results will be actively disseminated through conference presentations, peer-reviewed journals, social media, print and broadcast media, and various stakeholder activities."
https://openalex.org/W4225133301,"Type-2 cannabinoid receptors (CB2, encoded by the Cnr2 gene) are mainly expressed in immune cells, and CB2 agonists normally have no analgesic effect. However, nerve injury upregulates CB2 in the dorsal root ganglion (DRG), following which CB2 stimulation reduces neuropathic pain. It is unclear how nerve injury increases CB2 expression or how CB2 activity is transformed in neuropathic pain. In this study, immunoblotting showed that spinal nerve ligation (SNL) induced a delayed and sustained increase in CB2 expression in the DRG and dorsal spinal cord synaptosomes. RNAscope in situ hybridization also showed that SNL substantially increased CB2 mRNA levels, mostly in medium and large DRG neurons. Furthermore, we found that the specific CB2 agonist JWH-133 significantly inhibits the amplitude of dorsal root-evoked glutamatergic excitatory postsynaptic currents in spinal dorsal horn neurons in SNL rats, but not in sham control rats; intrathecal injection of JWH-133 reversed pain hypersensitivity in SNL rats, but had no effect in sham control rats. In addition, chromatin immunoprecipitation-qPCR analysis showed that SNL increased enrichment of two activating histone marks (H3K4me3 and H3K9ac) and diminished occupancy of two repressive histone marks (H3K9me2 and H3K27me3) at the Cnr2 promoter in the DRG. In contrast, SNL had no effect on DNA methylation levels around the Cnr2 promoter. Our findings suggest that peripheral nerve injury promotes CB2 expression in primary sensory neurons via epigenetic bivalent histone modifications and that CB2 activation reduces neuropathic pain by attenuating nociceptive transmission from primary afferent nerves to the spinal cord."
https://openalex.org/W4225150594,"Oxidized high-density lipoprotein (oxHDL) reduces the ability of cells to mediate reverse cholesterol transport and also shows atherogenic properties. Palmitoylation of cluster of differentiation 36 (CD36), an important receptor mediating lipoprotein uptake, is required for fatty acid endocytosis. However, the relationship between oxHDL and CD36 has not been described in mechanistic detail. Here, we demonstrate using acyl-biotin exchange analysis that oxHDL activates CD36 by increasing CD36 palmitoylation, which promotes efficient uptake in macrophages. This modification increased CD36 incorporation into plasma lipid rafts and activated downstream signaling mediators, such as Lyn, Fyn, and c-Jun N-terminal kinase, which elicited enhanced oxHDL uptake and foam cell formation. Furthermore, blocking CD36 palmitoylation with the pharmacological inhibitor 2-bromopalmitate decreased cell surface translocation and lowered oxHDL uptake in oxHDL-treated macrophages. We verified these results by transfecting oxHDL-induced macrophages with vectors expressing wildtype or mutant CD36 (mCD36) in which the cytoplasmic palmitoylated cysteine residues were replaced. We show that cells containing mCD36 exhibited less palmitoylated CD36, disrupted plasma membrane trafficking, and reduced protein stability. Moreover, in ApoE-/-CD36-/- mice, lipid accumulation at the aortic root in mice receiving the mCD36 vector was decreased, suggesting that CD36 palmitoylation is responsible for lipid uptake in vivo. Finally, our data indicated that palmitoylation of CD36 was dependent on DHHC6 (Asp-His-His-Cys) acyltransferase and its cofactor selenoprotein K, which increased the CD36/caveolin-1 interaction and membrane targeting in cells exposed to oxHDL. Altogether, our study uncovers a causal link between oxHDL and CD36 palmitoylation and provides insight into foam cell formation and atherogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W4225381868,"The evolving pandemic of non-communicable diseases like hypertension, diabetes mellitus are globally on the rise, and the trend is also escalating in Bangladesh. We aimed to assess the prevalence trend and associated factors of hypertension (HTN), diabetes mellitus (DM), and hypertension- diabetes mellitus combined (HDC) among Bangladeshi adults from 2011 to 2018. Two nationally representative cross-sectional data from Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey (BDHS): 2011 and 2017–18 were utilized. According to baseline characteristics, the average annual rate of change (AARC) was applied to quantify the annual rate of increase/decrease in HTN, DM, and HDC from 2011 to 2018. The prevalence ratios of HTN, DM, and HDC were assessed through modified Poisson regression with robust error variance (PR, 95% Confidence Interval (CI)). The data were prepared in SPSS version 23 and exported to Stata version 13 for further analysis. Among 11,686 participants, the overall mean age of the study participants was 52.79 years, Standard Deviation (SD)±12.99, and 42.28% were female. From 2011–2018, HTN, DM, and HDC prevalence in Bangladesh has increased by 13, 3.2, and 3.1 percentage points, respectively. The average annual rate of increase was observed in the HTN and HDC prevalence by all socio-economic and demographic categories during 2011–2018. The prevalence of HDC among Chittagong residents was approximately double in 2018: 3.95% (2011) versus 6.59% (2018). Increased age, inactive workers, overweight adults, and adults in wealthy families were common risk factors associated with HTN, DM, and HDC in Bangladesh. The prevalence of developing HTN and HDC was significantly higher among adults aged ≥ 70 years (PR: 2.70, 95% CI: 2.42–3.00; PR: 2.97, 95% CI: 2.08–4.24, respectively). A comprehensive approach of different stakeholders is required to develop appropriate strategies, including appropriate weight management, adequate physical activity, and healthier food habits. Health agencies should take initiatives to spread awareness among people at an early age, but special attention is needed for older people and those at risk for NCDs."
https://openalex.org/W4225277224,"Despite recent advances, there remains a significant unmet need for the development of new targeted therapies for triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). Although the heat shock protein HSP90 is a promising target, previous inhibitors have had issues during development including undesirable induction of the heat shock response (HSR) and off-target effects leading to toxicity. SL-145 is a novel, rationally-designed C-terminal HSP90 inhibitor that induces apoptosis in TNBC cells via the suppression of oncogenic AKT, MEK/ERK, and JAK2/STAT3 signaling and does not trigger the HSR, in contrast to other inhibitors. In an orthotopic allograft model incorporating breast cancer stem cell-enriched TNBC tumors, SL-145 potently suppressed tumor growth, angiogenesis, and metastases concomitant with dysregulation of the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway. Our findings highlight the potential of SL-145 in suppressing metastatic TNBC independent of the HSR."
https://openalex.org/W4229367358,"Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) is the most prevalent microorganism associated with mastitis in cattle, which harbours several virulence factors and antibiotic resistance genes. The present study aimed to characterize S. aureus isolated from mastitic milk of the cattle for antibiotic resistance (blaZ and mecA), haemolysins (hla and hlb) and enterotoxins (sea, seb, sec, and sed) genes. A total of 69 staphylococci were isolated and phenotypically characterized for haemolytic properties on 5% sheep blood agar medium. Out of 69 isolates, 55 (79.71%) were identified as S. aureus by polymerase chain reaction assay. Among S. aureus, the majority of the isolates harboured the gene blaZ (92.73%), followed by coa (89.09%), hlb (60%) and hla (49.09%). Gene mecA responsible for methicillin resistance was detected in 23.64% of S. aureus isolates. Enterotoxin genes seb (9.09%), sec (1.82%) and sed (7.27%) responsible for food poisoning were detected at a comparatively lower rate and none of the S. aureus strain was found positive for sea. Additionally, antimicrobial susceptibility study of S. aureus against 18 antimicrobial discs showed maximum resistance to oxytetracycline, penicillin, and fluoroquinolone groups, contrarily, we observed maximum sensitivity to methicillin and cefuroxime antimicrobials. The high occurrence rate of S. aureus harbouring genes for virulence factors and antimicrobial resistance needs appropriate strategies to control the pathogen spread to the human population."
https://openalex.org/W4225144682,"The mouse intestinal helminth Heligmosomoides polygyrus modulates host immune responses by secreting a transforming growth factor (TGF)-β mimic (TGM), to expand the population of Foxp3+ Tregs. TGM comprises five complement control protein (CCP)-like domains, designated D1-D5. Though lacking homology to TGF-β, TGM binds directly to the TGF-β receptors TβRI and TβRII and stimulates the differentiation of naïve T-cells into Tregs. However, the molecular determinants of binding are unclear. Here, we used surface plasmon resonance, isothermal calorimetry, NMR spectroscopy, and mutagenesis to investigate how TGM binds the TGF-β receptors. We demonstrate that binding is modular, with D1-D2 binding to TβRI and D3 binding to TβRII. D1-D2 and D3 were further shown to compete with TGF-β(TβRII)2 and TGF-β for binding to TβRI and TβRII, respectively. The solution structure of TGM-D3 revealed that TGM adopts a CCP-like fold but is also modified to allow the C-terminal strand to diverge, leading to an expansion of the domain and opening potential interaction surfaces. TGM-D3 also incorporates a long structurally ordered hypervariable loop, adding further potential interaction sites. Through NMR shift perturbations and binding studies of TGM-D3 and TβRII variants, TGM-D3 was shown to occupy the same site of TβRII as bound by TGF-β using both a novel interaction surface and the hypervariable loop. These results, together with the identification of other secreted CCP-like proteins with immunomodulatory activity in H. polygyrus, suggest that TGM is part of a larger family of evolutionarily plastic parasite effector molecules that mediate novel interactions with their host.

TGM, in contrast to the single-domain structure of TGF-β, is composed of five modular domains, designated D1 – D5, all with distant sequence homology to proteins of the complement control protein (CCP) family (15Johnston C.J.C.

Commun. 2017; 8: 1741Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). CCP domains are approximately 60 to 65 amino acids in length with multiple short β-strands tethered together by two highly conserved disulfide bonds in a CysI-CysIII and CysII-CysIV topology (34Kirkitadze M.D. Barlow P.N. Structure and flexibility of the multiple domain proteins that regulate complement activation.Immunol. Rev. 2001; 180: 146-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar).

Here, we characterized the individual domains of TGM and investigated the nature of the TGM:TβRI and TGM:TβRII binding interactions, using surface plasmon resonance (SPR), isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), and NMR. Binding of TGM to the TGF-β receptors was found to be modular in nature, with D1-D2 and D3 binding TβRI and TβRII, respectively. TGM was additionally shown to bind to similar structural motifs on TβRI and TβRII as TGF-β, indicating that TGM truly mimics TGF-β, despite its lack of structural similarity. The solution structure of TGM-D3 was determined and showed that TGM-D3 assumes the overall fold of a CCP domain with two key differences: (1) a loop and a short helix replace two β-strands and (2) a long (23-amino acid) structurally ordered insertion within the hypervariable loop (HVL). These modifications lead to a significant lateral expansion of the domain and create potential interaction surfaces on opposite faces of the protein. Through NMR binding studies, as well as binding studies of TGM-D3 and TβRII variants, TGM-D3 is shown to engage TβRII through one of its two potential interaction surfaces, as well as through the HVL. These new structural data illuminate how H. polygyrus has adapted its own CCP domain–containing proteins for the purpose of protein mimicry and host immunomodulation. Previous in vitro TGF-β bioassays demonstrated that only TGM domains 1 to 3 were required for induction of CD4+ CD25+ Foxp3+ Tregs from naïve murine T cells or activation of a TGF-β reporter in a mouse embryonic fibroblast cell line (35Smyth D.J. Harcus Y. White M.P.J. Gregory W.F. Nahler J. Stephens I. et al.TGF-beta mimic proteins form an extended gene family in the murine parasite Heligmosomoides polygyrus.Int. J. Parasitol. 2018; 48: 379-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Proteins lacking domains 4 and 5 (TGM-D123) retained ability to induce TGF-β signaling, albeit with reduced potency in T-cell assays, while removal of any or all of domains 1 to 3 completely abolished activity. TGM was furthermore shown to require both TβRI and TβRII to elicit TGF-β signaling (15Johnston C.J.C. Smyth D.J. Kodali R.B. White M.P.J. Harcus Y. Filbey K.J. et al.A structurally distinct TGF-beta mimic from an intestinal helminth parasite potently induces regulatory T cells.Nat.

Previous SPR measurements demonstrated that TGM binds TβRII with micromolar affinity, similar but weaker than TGF-β1 and -β3, but unlike TGF-β1 and TGF-β3, which only bind TβRI with low nanomolar affinity once bound to TβRII, TGM binds TβRI with low nanomolar affinity in the absence of TβRII (14Grainger J.R. Smith K.A. Hewitson J.P. McSorley H.J. Harcus Y. Filbey K.J. et al.Helminth secretions induce de novo T cell Foxp3 expression and regulatory function through the TGF-beta pathway.J. Exp. Med. 2010; 207: 2331-2341Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). It is unknown which domains of TGM bind to TβRI and TβRII or if TβRI and TβRII directly contact one another, as in the TGF-β receptor complex. To investigate this, the individual domains TGM-D1, TGM-D2, and TGM-D3, along with full-length TGM (TGM-FL), were expressed and purified for SPR binding studies with the TGF-β receptors. The injection of these domains over biotinylated avi-tagged TβRI captured on a streptavidin-coated sensor chip yielded robust concentration-dependent responses when TGM-D2 or TGM-FL was injected, but not when TGM-D1 or TGM-D3 was injected (Fig. 1, A–D). The KD values derived by globally fitting the TGM-D2 and TGM-FL sensorgrams to a (1:1) kinetic model were 310 nM and 13 nM, respectively (Table 1). Thus, TGM-D2 is evidently the main binding partner for TβRI, but nonetheless lacks the full binding capacity of TGM. The same series of injections, performed over biotinylated avi-tagged TβRII captured on a streptavidin-coated sensor chip, yielded robust responses when TGM-D3 or TGM-FL was injected, but not when TGM-D1 or TGM-D2 was injected (Fig. 1,F–I). The KD values derived from the TGM-FL and TGM-D3 sensorgrams were 610 nM and 910 nM, respectively (Table 1). Thus, TGM-D3 accounts for most of the binding affinity of TGM-FL for TβRII.Table 1TGM:TβRI and TGM:TβRII binding as assessed by SPRSurfaceAnalyteFitted parametersaFitted parameters were derived from kinetic analysis of a single injection series.kon (M−1 s−1)koff (s−1)KD (nM)Rmax (RU)TβRITGM-D1NDbNot determined due to weak signal.NDbNot determined due to weak signal.NDbNot determined due to weak signal.NDaFitted parameters were derived from kinetic analysis of a single injection series.TβRITGM-D2(3.0 ± 0.1) × 105(9.1 ± 0.1) × 10−2310 ± 1089.6 ± 0.7TβRITGM-D3NDbNot determined due to weak signal.NDbNot determined due to weak signal.NDbNot determined due to weak signal.NDaFitted parameters were derived from kinetic analysis of a single injection series.TβRITGM-D12(6.7 ± 0.1) × 104(1.6 ± 0.1) × 10−324 ± 1429 ± 1TβRIcMeasured on a lower density chip compared to that used for TβRI:TGM-D2 and TβRI:TGM-D12.TGM-FL(5.9 ± 0.1) × 104(7.8 ± 0.2) × 10−413 ± 1193 ± 1TβRIITGM D1NDbNot determined due to weak signal.NDbNot determined due to weak signal.NDbNot determined due to weak signal.NDaFitted parameters were derived from kinetic analysis of a single injection series.TβRIITGM D2NDbNot determined due to weak signal.NDbNot determined due to weak signal.NDbNot determined due to weak signal.NDaFitted parameters were derived from kinetic analysis of a single injection series.TβRIITGM D1D2NDbNot determined due to weak signal.NDbNot determined due to weak signal.NDbNot determined due to weak signal.NDaFitted parameters were derived from kinetic analysis of a single injection series.TβRIITGM D3(6 ± 1) × 1050.6 ± 0.1910 ± 2033.0 ± 0.4TβRIITGM FL(2 ± 6) × 107(1 ± 4) × 10−1610 ± 10215 ± 2a Fitted parameters were derived from kinetic analysis of a single injection series.b Not determined due to weak signal.c Measured on a lower density chip compared to that used for TβRI:TGM-D2 and TβRI:TGM-D12. Open table in a new tab TGM-D3’s full and TGM-D2’s partial recapitulation of TGM binding affinity for TβRII and TβRI, respectively, suggested that TGM-D1 might contribute to binding of TβRI. Thus, we assessed binding of a construct containing both TGM-D1 and TGM-D2, designated TGM-D12, to TβRI and TβRII using SPR. This didomain construct bound robustly to TβRI, but did not bind at all to TβRII (Fig. 1, E and J). The KD derived from kinetic analysis of the TGM-D12:TβRI sensorgrams was 24 nM, which is within a factor of two of that of TGM-FL (Table 1). Thus, TGM-D1 also contributes to the binding to TβRI. ITC experiments, which in contrast to SPR are carried out entirely in solution and do not require any tagging, were also performed to assess binding of the individual domains of TGM to TβRI and TβRII. In accord with the SPR results, titration of TGM-D2, TGM-D12, and TGM-FL into TβRI and TGM-D3 and TGM-FL into TβRII yielded readily measurable binding isotherms with large negative enthalpies (Figs. 2, A–E and S1, A–E). In contrast, titration of TGM-D1 and TGM-D3 over a similar range of concentrations into TβRI and TGM-D1 and TGM-D2 into TβRII did not (Fig. S1, F–M). In further accord with the SPR results, the fitted KD values for binding of TGM-D12 to TβRI and TGM-D3 to TβRII were comparable to those of TGM-FL and were generally consistent with those measured by SPR (Table S2). In contrast, and as expected based on the SPR results, the KD for binding of TGM-D2 to TβRI was significantly increased (ca. 50-fold) relative to TGM-FL (Table S2). ITC, in addition to providing KD values, also provides values for the stoichiometry, and as shown, TGM-FL binds both TβRI and TβRII with near 1:1 stoichiometry (Table S2). The near 1:1 stoichiometry is also observed for the TGM subdomains shown to bind TβRI and TβRII, TGM-D12 and TGM-D3, respectively, but for TGM-D2 binding to TβRI, the stoichiometry was closer to 0.5. The differing stoichiometry for binding of TGM-D2 and TGM-D12 to TβRI is likely due the weaker affinity of the former interaction, which makes accurate data fitting difficult. Thus, as discussed in a following section, an alternative method was used and this established 1:1 stoichiometry for the TGM-D2 to TβRI interaction. To assess potential shared binding sites on TβRI and TβRII, ITC competition experiments were performed in which KDs and enthalpies for TβRI and TβRII binding to their partners were measured under noncompetitive and competitive conditions. In the case of TβRI, titration of the TGF-β3(TβRII)2 complex into TβRI yielded a fitted KD of 61 nM (Fig. 2F and Table S3), which is similar to the KD of 25 nM when TGM-D12 was titrated into TβRI (Fig. 2B and Table S2). However, unlike TGM-D12:TβRI binding which had a large negative enthalpy, −19 kcal mol−1 (Table S2), binding of TGF-β3(TβRII)2 to TβRI had a much smaller negative enthalpy, −4.2 kcal mol−1, even at an increased temperature (Table S3). In light of similar KDs, but significantly different enthalpies, the competition experiment with TβRI was performed by titrating TGM-D12 into the cell loaded with the TGF-β3(TβRII)2(TβRI)2 ternary complex (Fig. 2G). This yielded no heat, indicating that TGM-D12 and TGF-β3(TβRII)2 compete for binding to TβRI. TGF-β3, and TGF-β homodimers in general, is well known to be practically insoluble in the unbound form, except under either very acidic (pH 4.0) or basic (pH 11.0) conditions (42Pellaud J. Schote U.

https://openalex.org/W4225372427,"It has been reported that 222-nm ultraviolet C (UVC) exerts a germicidal effect on bacteria and viruses as well as UV radiation emitted from a conventional germicidal lamp but is less toxic to the mammalian cells than that from a germicidal lamp. An excimer lamp filled with krypton chloride (KrCl) gas principally emits 222-nm UVC. However, the lamp also emits a wide band of wavelengths other than 222 nm, especially UVC at a longer wavelength than 222 nm and ultraviolet B, which cause DNA damage. There are some reports on the critical role of bandpass filters in reducing the harmful effect of UVC emitted from a KrCl excimer lamp in a human skin model and human subjects. However, the effectiveness of a bandpass filter has not been demonstrated in animal experiments. In the present study, mice were irradiated with UVC emitted from a KrCl excimer lamp with or without a bandpass filter. UVC emitted from an unfiltered KrCl lamp at doses of 50, 150 and 300 mJ/cm 2 induced cyclobutyl pyrimidine dimer (CPD)-positive cells, whereas UVC emitted from a filtered lamp did not significantly increase CPD-positive cells in the epidermis. The present study suggested that the bandpass filter serves a critical role in reducing the harmful effect of emission outside of 222 nm to mouse keratinocytes."
https://openalex.org/W4225427497,"Despite significant investment to increase recycling facilities and kerbside collection of waste materials, plastic packaging is frequently discarded as litter, resulting in significant environmental harm. This research uses qualitative methods to explore the contextual and psychological factors that influence plastic waste disposal behaviour from the perspectives of consumers. This research also reports key results from a brief online survey exploring consumer perspectives toward plastics and plastic recycling. A total of N = 18 adults living in Northern Ireland (NI) participated in a semi-structured interview and N = 756 adults living in NI took part in an online survey. Interview data was analysed via a semi-directed content analysis approach, using the COM-B behaviour change model as a guiding framework. Survey data underwent descriptive and frequency analysis. Collectively, the findings suggest that environmental concern exists among consumers generally, but there is a degree of ambivalence toward recycling that reflects a gap between intentions to recycle and actual recycling behaviour. Plastic recycling behaviour is hindered by three common barriers: 1. confusion and uncertainty about which plastic materials can be recycled (exacerbated by the abundance of plastic products available) 2. perceiving plastic recycling to be less of a personal priority in daily life 3. perceiving that local government and manufacturers have a responsibility to make plastic recycling easier. As recycling is simply not a priority for many individuals, efforts should instead be placed on providing greater scaffolding to make the process of recycling less tedious, confusing, and more habitual. Visual cues on product packing and recycling resources can address ambiguity about which plastic materials can/cannot be recycled and increasing opportunities to recycle (via consistent availability of recycling bins) can reduce the physical burden of accessing recycling resources. Such interventions, based on environmental restructuring and enablement, may increase motivations to recycle by reducing the cognitive and physical burden of recycling, supporting healthier recycling habits."
https://openalex.org/W4225410704,"Corticotropin releasing factor (CRF) systems in limbic structures are posited to mediate stress-induced relapse in addiction, traditionally by generating distress states that spur drug consumption as attempts at hedonic self-medication. Yet evidence suggests that activating CRF-expressing neurons in the central amygdala (CeA) or nucleus accumbens (NAc) can magnify incentive motivation in absence of distress, at least for sucrose rewards. However, traditional CRF hypotheses in addiction neuroscience are primarily directed toward drug rewards. The question remains open whether CRF systems can similarly act via incentive motivation mechanisms to promote pursuit of drug rewards, such as cocaine. Here we tested whether optogenetic excitation of CRF-containing neurons in either NAc medial shell, lateral CeA, or dorsolateral BNST of transgenic Crh -Cre+ rats would spur preference and pursuit of a particular laser-paired cocaine reward over an alternative cocaine reward, and whether excitation served as a positively-valenced incentive itself, through laser self-stimulation tests. We report that excitation of CRF-containing neurons in either NAc or CeA recruited mesocorticolimbic circuitry to amplify incentive motivation to pursue the laser-paired cocaine: focusing preference on the laser-paired cocaine reward in a two-choice task, and spurred pursuit as doubled breakpoint in a progressive ratio task. Crucially indicating positive-valence, excitation of CRF neurons in NAc and CeA also was actively sought after by most rats in self-stimulation tasks. Conversely, CRF neuronal activation in BNST was never self-stimulated, but failed to enhance cocaine consumption. Collectively, we find that NAc and CeA CRF-containing neurons can amplify pursuit and consumption of cocaine by positively-valenced incentive mechanisms, without any aversive distress."
https://openalex.org/W4225163473,"Bacterial Rho is a RNA-dependent ATPase that functions in the termination of transcription. The in vivo nature of the bacterial Rho-dependent terminators, as well as the mechanism of the Rho-dependent termination process, are not fully understood. Here, we measured the in vivo termination efficiencies of 72 Rho-dependent terminators in Escherichia coli by systematically performing qRT-PCR analyses of cDNA prepared from mid-log phase bacterial cultures. We found that these terminators exhibited a wide range of efficiencies, and many behaved differently in vivo compared to the predicted or experimentally determined efficiencies in vitro. Rho-utilization sites (rut sites) present in the RNA terminator sequences are characterized by the presence of C-rich/G-poor sequences or C > G bubbles. We found that weaker terminators exhibited a robust correlation with the properties (size, length, density, etc.) of these C > G bubbles of their respective rut sites, while stronger terminators lack this correlation, suggesting a limited role of rut sequences in controlling in vivo termination efficiencies. We also found that in vivo termination efficiencies are dependent on the rates of ATP hydrolysis as well as Rho-translocation on the nascent RNA. We demonstrate that weaker terminators, in addition to having rut sites with diminished C > G bubble sizes, are dependent on the Rho-auxiliary factor, NusG, in vivo. From these results, we concluded that in vivo Rho-dependent termination follows a nascent RNA-dependent pathway, where Rho-translocation along the RNA is essential and rut sequences may recruit Rho in vivo, but Rho-rut binding strengths do not regulate termination efficiencies."

https://openalex.org/W4225369348,"Numerous studies have reported the pathogenic roles of C-reactive protein (CRP) and complement activation in diabetic kidney disease (DKD) individually. However, considering the potent regulatory effect of CRP on complement activation, it remains unclear whether CRP participates in DKD pathogenesis by regulating complement activation. Moreover, this work focuses on complement activation in rats, which aims at settling the dispute that whether rat CRP can activate the complement system. To address this question, the complement effectors C3a, C5a, and C5b-9 were examined in human patients with diabetic nephropathy (DN) and wt, Crp-/- , and huCRPtg rats with STZ-diabetic DKD. The Crp-/- rats showed more C3a accumulation in blood and glomeruli than wt and huCRPtg rats. The balance between autophagy and apoptosis was evaluated in DKD rats, and Crp-/- rats showed increased podocyte autophagy compared with wt and huCRPtg rats. Meanwhile, stable CRP-overexpression and CRP-knockout cell lines were established and used to demonstrate that CRP suppresses C3a-induced podocyte autophagy under high-glucose conditions. We further verified that the inhibition of C3a-induced podocyte autophagy by CRP was dependent on C3aR expression and that this effect could be reversed with a C3aR antagonist and agonist. Therefore, our findings provide evidence that CRP suppresses podocyte autophagy to accelerate the development of DKD by inhibiting C3a/C3aR axis signaling, which may help in the development of a new therapeutic strategy for the management of podocyte autophagy and DKD. In addition, rat CRP has been shown to be identical to human CRP in the activation of autologous complement and interspecific complement."

HER3-DXd was translocated to the lysosome, where time- and concentration-dependent signals were observed in the HER3 mutant and HER3 WT cells. HER3-DXd inhibited the growth of HER3 WT and HER3 mutant cells. HER3-DXd activity was observed in the presence and absence of HER2 overexpression. These data suggest that HER3-DXd may have activity against tumors expressing wild type HER3 or clinically observed HER3 mutations, supporting further clinical evaluation."
https://openalex.org/W4225387501,"Balance can be a main factor contributing to success in many disciplines, and biathlon is a representative example. A more stable posture may be a key factor for shooting scores. The center of foot pressure (COP) is commonly recorded when evaluating postural control. As COP measurements are highly irregular and non-stationary, non-linear deterministic methods, such as entropy, are more appropriate for the analysis of COP displacement. The aim of our study was to investigate whether the longitudinal effects of biathlon training can elicit specific changes in postural control. Eight national-level biathletes, 15 non-athletes who prior to the experiment took part in 3 months of shooting training, and 15 non-athletes with no prior rifle shooting experience took part in our study. The data was collected with the use of a force plate. Participants performed three balance tasks in quiet standing, the shooting position (internal focus–participants concentrated on maintaining the correct body position and rifle), and aiming at the target (external focus–participants concentrated on keeping the laser beam centered on the targets). Biathletes obtained significantly lower values of sample entropy compared to the other groups during the shooting and aiming at the target trials (p&lt;0.05). External and internal focuses influenced the process of postural control among participants who had prior rifle shooting experience and the control group; they obtained significantly higher values of sample entropy while shooting and aiming at the target compared to the quiet standing trial (p&lt;0.05). The biathletes obtained significantly lower values of sample entropy in the aiming at the target position compared to the quiet standing trial. Specific balance training is associated with the ability to deal with a more challenging, non-specific task. The biathletes seemed to employ a different motor control strategy than the beginners and control group, creating repeating patterns (more regular signal for COP) to keep one’s balance during the shooting and aiming at the target positions."
https://openalex.org/W4225411424,"The branches of the porcine subclavian artery are frequently used in endovascular stroke training and research. This study aimed to determine a porcine weight group, in which the arterial diameters most closely match human cerebral artery diameters, and thus optimize the porcine in-vivo model for neuroendovascular purposes. A group of 42 German Landrace swine (45-74 kg) was divided into four subgroups according to their weight. Angiographic images of the swine were used to determine the arterial diameter of the main branches of the subclavian artery: axillary artery, brachial artery, external thoracic artery, subscapular artery (at two different segments), suprascapular artery, caudal circumflex humeral artery, thoracodorsal artery, and circumflex scapular artery. The porcine arterial diameters were correlated with animal weight and compared to luminal diameters of human arteries which are commonly involved in stroke: internal carotid artery, basilar artery, vertebral artery, middle cerebral artery and M2 branches of the middle cerebral artery. Swine weight was positively correlated with porcine arterial diameter. The most conformity with human arterial diameters was found within the two heavier porcine groups (55-74 kg). We suggest the use of swine with a weight between 55-59.7 kg, as lighter animals show less similarity with human arterial diameters and heavier animals could cause more problems with manipulation and handling."

Escherichia coli ( E . coli ) was chosen as model substance for this purpose as it is readily available in most laboratories and can be quickly and easily prepared with a high turnaround rate. Four different sample preparation methods were initially evaluated with respect to percent recovery, limit of detection, and limit of quantification, and the most promising one was developed further. The final process involving microwave assisted digestion of the sample with nitric acid and hydrogen peroxide showed high recovery, repeatability, and specificity. The process was first applied to lead and then extended for the determination of cadmium in the same E . coli substrates. Finally, to validate the process, a certified references material was analyzed, and the results obtained were evaluated with respect to accuracy by comparing them to the reported ones."

However, an efficacy comparison across various dietary supplements and their co-supplements are unavailable for these outcomes. Therefore, a systematic review protocol is proposed here to make a network meta-analysis (NMA)-based juxtaposition across the following dietary supplements- vitamins, Myo-inositol, choline, minerals, probiotics, prebiotics, synbiotics, and omega-3 fatty acids. Materials and methods A database search will ensue in the PubMed, Embase, and Scopus databases for RCTs testing the above, irrespective of their geographical origin. Data on population characteristics, compared interventions, and outcomes of interest will get abstracted from the studies included in the proposed review. Each of the reviewed studies will get appraised using the revised Cochrane tool. For each outcome, the comparative efficacy across interventions will be estimated in weighted or standardized mean difference using the frequentist method NMA and presented with their 95% confidence interval using league tables. By constructing network maps and comparison-adjusted funnel plots, a visual assessment of the inter-interventional relation and publication bias in each NMA model will happen, respectively. The best-ranked intervention prediction for respective outcomes will transpire using the surface under the cumulative ranking curve values.

https://openalex.org/W4229370502,"Multiple myeloma (MM) is a hematological cancer causing from accumulated abnormal plasma cells. STAT3 overexpression in MM appears to be mediated by a variety of factors, and it may be associated with an adverse prognosis and play a role in microenvironment-dependent treatment resistance. Unfortunately, MM remains an incurable disease, as relapse is very common. Therefore, there is urgent need to develop new treatment options for MM. Radotinib is a novel anti-cancer drug, currently approved in South Korea for the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia patients. It is an oral, multitargeted inhibitor of receptor tyrosine kinases, including BCR-ABL, c-KIT, PDGFR, and Src family kinases. However, little is known about the effects of radotinib on multiple myeloma cells. However, little is known about the effects of radotinib on multiple myeloma cells. But even tinip almost not known about the impact of multiple myeloma cells. Moreover, nothing is known about how it affects STAT3 and JAK2. In this study, we analyzed the effect of radotinib on multiple myeloma cells. Herein, Moreover, nothing is known about how it. Moreover, not all is known about how the affects STAT3 and JAK2. We investigated the effect of radotinib on the STAT3 signaling pathway in MM cells, including several MM cell lines and mouse models. So we investigated the effect of radotinib on MM cells, including several MM cell lines and mouse models. Interestingly, radotinib induced apoptosis, and inhibited cell proliferation in MM cells including RPMI-8226, MM.1S, U266B1, and IM-9 cells. Moreover, radotinib treatment significantly increased the number Annexin V-positive cells and G0/G1-phase cells. In addition, radotinib treatment in various MM cells strongly suppressed the activity and expression of STAT3 and JAK2 proteins. We also observed that diverse proteins related to the STAT3 signaling pathway, including c-Myc, Bcl-xL, Mcl-1, cyclin D1 and cyclin D3, were powerfully inhibited by radotinib treatment in MM cells. Furthermore, radotinib significantly suppressed MM cell growth in a xenograft animal model using IM-9 cells. In conclusion, radotinib may play an important role as a candidate agent for MM treatment."
https://openalex.org/W4225161556,"Staphylococcus aureus is a major cause of deadly nosocomial infections, a severe problem fueled by the steady increase of resistant bacteria. The iron surface determinant (Isd) system is a family of proteins that acquire nutritional iron from the host organism, helping the bacterium to proliferate during infection, and therefore represents a promising antibacterial target. In particular, the surface protein IsdH captures hemoglobin (Hb) and acquires the heme moiety containing the iron atom. Structurally, IsdH comprises three distinctive NEAr-iron Transporter (NEAT) domains connected by linker domains. The objective of this study was to characterize the linker region between NEAT2 and NEAT3 from various biophysical viewpoints and thereby advance our understanding of its role in the molecular mechanism of heme extraction. We demonstrate the linker region contributes to the stability of the bound protein, likely influencing the flexibility and orientation of the NEAT3 domain in its interaction with Hb, but only exerts a modest contribution to the affinity of IsdH for heme. Based on these data, we suggest that the flexible nature of the linker facilitates the precise positioning of NEAT3 to acquire heme. In addition, we also found that residues His45 and His89 of Hb located in the heme transfer route toward IsdH do not play a critical role in the transfer rate-determining step. In conclusion, this study clarifies key elements of the mechanism of heme extraction of human Hb by IsdH, providing key insights into the Isd system and other protein systems containing NEAT domains."
https://openalex.org/W4225399782,"Anxiety symptoms (AS) are exacerbated in healthcare workers (HCWs) during the COVID-19 pandemic. Spirituality is known to protect against AS in the general population and it is a construct that differs from religion. It can be assessed using structured questionnaires. A validated questionnaire disclosed three spirituality dimensions: peace, meaning, and faith. In HCWs we investigated the predictors of chronic anxiety (pre-COVID-19 and during the pandemic) and acute anxiety (only during the pandemic), including spirituality in the model. Then, we verified which spirituality dimensions predicted chronic and acute anxiety. Lastly, we studied group differences between the mean scores of these spirituality dimensions.The study was carried out in a Brazilian Hospital. HCWs (n = 118) were assessed for spirituality at a single time-point. They were also asked about AS that had started pre-COVID-19 and persisted during the pandemic (chronic anxiety), and AS that had started only during the pandemic (acute anxiety). The subjects without chronic anxiety were subdivided into two other groups: acute anxiety and without chronic and acute anxiety. Forward stepwise logistic regressions were used to find the significant AS predictors. First, the model considered sex, age, religious affiliation, and spirituality. Then, the analysis were performed considering only the three spirituality dimensions. Group means differences in the spirituality dimensions were compared using univariate ANCOVAS followed by T-tests.Spirituality was the most realible predictor of chronic (OR = 0.818; 95%CI:0.752-0.890; p<0.001) and acute anxiety (OR = 0.727; 95%CI:0.601-0.881; p = 0.001). Peace alone predicted chronic anxiety (OR = 0.619; 95%CI:0.516-0.744; p<0.001) while for acute anxiety both peace (OR:0.517; 95%CI:0.340-0.787; p = 0.002), and faith (OR:0.674; 95%CI:0.509-0.892; p = 0.006) significantly contributed to the model. Faith was significantly higher in subjects without AS.Higher spirituality protected against chronic and acute anxiety. Faith and peace spirituality dimensions conferred protection against acute anxiety during the pandemic."
https://openalex.org/W4225427512,"Wildlife-vehicle collisions can have a substantial influence on the mortality rates of many wildlife populations. Crossing structures are designed to mitigate the impact of road mortality by allowing safe passage of wildlife above or below roads, and connect to suitable areas on both sides of the road. Ocelots (Leopardus pardalis) are a federally endangered felid in the United States, with remnant populations of <80 individuals remaining in the Lower Rio Grande Valley of South Texas. Vehicle collisions are the greatest known source of mortality for ocelots in Texas. Crossing structures designed for ocelot use have been implemented throughout South Texas since the 1990s, however, ocelots rarely use them. We compared landscape characteristics between ocelot crossing structures and ocelot-vehicle collision sites. We quantified the spatial distribution of woody and herbaceous cover types surrounding ocelot crossing structures (n = 56) and ocelot-vehicle collision sites (n = 26) at multiple spatial extents and compared landscape metrics between these location types. The landscape surrounding ocelot crossing structures had 17-22% more open herbaceous cover >1,050 m from the road, and 1.2-5.8 ha larger herbaceous patches >450 m from the road compared to ocelot-vehicle collision sites. Additionally, many crossing structures installed during the 1990's are situated >100 km away from an extant ocelot population. Results from this study can guide conservation planners to place future road crossing structures in areas more likely to be used by ocelots. Our results also emphasize that reliable scientific data must be used for effective mitigation efforts. In the absence of data, post-installation assessments can improve the placement of future structures."
https://openalex.org/W4229368693,"Background Group antenatal care (G-ANC) is a promising model for improving quality of maternal care and outcomes in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) but little has been published examining the mechanisms by which it may contribute to those improvements. Substantial interplay can be expected between pregnant women and providers’ respective experiences of care, but most studies report findings separately. This study explores the experience and effects of G-ANC on both women and providers to inform an integrated theory of change for G-ANC in LMICs. Methods This paper reports on multiple secondary outcomes from a pragmatic cluster randomized controlled trial of group antenatal care in Kenya and Nigeria conducted from October 2016—November 2018 including 20 clusters per country. We collected qualitative data from providers and women providing or receiving group antenatal care via focus group discussions (19 with women; 4 with providers) and semi-structured interviews (42 with women; 4 with providers). Quantitative data were collected via surveys administered to 1) providers in the intervention arm at enrollment and after facilitating 4 cohorts and 2) women in both study arms at enrollment; 3–6 weeks postpartum; and 1 year postpartum. Through an iterative approach with framework analysis, we explored the interactions of voiced experience and perceived effects of care and placed them relationally within a theory of change. Selected variables from baseline and final surveys were analyzed to examine applicability of the theory to all study participants. Results Findings support seven inter-related themes. Three themes relate to the shared experience of care of women and providers: forming supportive relationships and open communication; becoming empowered partners in learning and care; and providing and receiving meaningful clinical services and information. Four themes relate to effects of that experience, which are not universally shared: self-reinforcing cycles of more and better care; linked improvements in health knowledge, confidence, and healthy behaviors; improved communication, support, and care beyond G-ANC meetings; and motivation to continue providing G-ANC. Together these themes map to a theory of change which centers the shared experience of care for women and providers among multiple pathways to improved outcomes. Discussion The reported experience and effects of G-ANC on women and providers are consistent with other studies in LMICs. This study is novel because it uses the themes to present a theory of change for G-ANC in low-resource settings. It is useful for G-ANC implementation to inform model development, test adaptations, and continue exploring mechanisms of action in future research."
https://openalex.org/W4229372705,"The biggest challenge for the reproduction of flood-irrigated rice is to identify superior genotypes that present development of high-yielding varieties with specific grain qualities, resistance to abiotic and biotic stresses in addition to superior adaptation to the target environment. Thus, the objectives of this study were to propose a multi-trait and multi-environment Bayesian model to estimate genetic parameters for the flood-irrigated rice crop. To this end, twenty-five rice genotypes belonging to the flood-irrigated rice breeding program were evaluated. Grain yield and flowering were evaluated in the agricultural year 2017/2018. The experimental design used in all experiments was a randomized block design with three replications. The Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm was used to estimate genetic parameters and genetic values. The flowering is highly heritable by the Bayesian credibility interval: h2 = 0.039-0.80, and 0.02-0.91, environment 1 and 2, respectively. The genetic correlation between traits was significantly different from zero in the two environments (environment 1: -0.80 to 0.74; environment 2: -0.82 to 0.86. The relationship of CVe and CVg higher for flowering in the reduced model (CVg/CVe = 5.83 and 13.98, environments 1 and 2, respectively). For the complete model, this trait presented an estimate of the relative variation index of: CVe = 4.28 and 4.21, environments 1 and 2, respectively. In summary, the multi-trait and multi-environment Bayesian model allowed a reliable estimate of the genetic parameter of flood-irrigated rice. Bayesian analyzes provide robust inference of genetic parameters. Therefore, we recommend this model for genetic evaluation of flood-irrigated rice genotypes, and their generalization, in other crops. Precise estimates of genetic parameters bring new perspectives on the application of Bayesian methods to solve modeling problems in the genetic improvement of flood-irrigated rice."
https://openalex.org/W4225269860,"For human prostate cancer, the chromosome 8p21 locus, which contains NKX3.1 and the microRNA (miR)-3622 family (miR-3622a/b), is a frequently deleted region. Thus, miR-3622 is proposed as a suppressor for prostate cancer, but its role remains debatable. In the present study, we found that expression of miR-3622a was lower, whereas expression of miR-3622b-3p was higher in human prostate cancer tissues than in normal prostate tissues. miR-3622a-3p inhibited cell migration and invasion of human prostate cancer cells, whereas miR-3622b-3p facilitated cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. To address the opposing roles of miR-3622 family members in various human prostate cancer cell lines, we knocked out (KO) endogenous miR-3622, including both miR-3622a/b. Our results showed that miR-3622 KO reduced cell proliferation, migration, and invasion in vitro and tumor growth and metastasis in vivo. Functional analyses revealed that miR-3622 regulated the p53-downstream gene network, including AIFM2, c-MYC, and p21, to control apoptosis and the cell cycle. Furthermore, using CRISPR interference, miRNA/mRNA immunoprecipitation assays, and dual-luciferase assays, we established that AIFM2, a direct target of miR-3622b-3p, is responsible for miR-3622 KO-induced apoptosis. We identified an miR-3622-AIFM2 axis that contributes to oncogenic function during tumor progression. In addition, miR-3622 KO inhibited the epithelial–mesenchymal transition involved in prostate cancer metastasis via upregulation of vimentin. The results show that miR-3622b-3p is upregulated in human prostate cancers and has an oncogenic function in tumor progression and metastasis via repression of p53 signaling, especially through an miR-3622-AIFM2 axis. In contrast, for human prostate cancer, deletion of the miR-3622 locus at 8p21 reduced the oncogenic effects on tumor progression and metastasis."
https://openalex.org/W4225373629,"Metallothionein 3 (MT-3) is a small, cysteine-rich protein that binds to essential metals required for homeostasis, as well as to heavy metals that have the potential to exert toxic effects on cells. MT-3 is expressed by epithelial cells of the human kidney, including the cells of the proximal tubule. Our laboratory has previously shown that mortal cultures of human proximal tubular (HPT) cells express MT-3 and form domes in the cell monolayer, a morphological feature indicative of vectorial active transport, an essential function of the proximal tubule. However, an immortalized proximal tubular cell line HK-2 lacks the expression of MT-3 and fails to form domes in the monolayer. Transfection of HK-2 cells with the MT-3 gene restores dome formation in these cells suggesting that MT-3 is required for vectorial active transport. In order to determine how MT-3 imparts this essential feature to the proximal tubule, we sought to identify proteins that interact either directly or indirectly with MT-3. Using a combination of pulldowns, co-immunoprecipitations, and mass spectrometry analysis, putative protein interactants were identified and subsequently confirmed by Western analysis and confocal microscopy, following which proteins with direct physical interactions were investigated through molecular docking. Our data shows that MT-3 interacts with myosin-9, aldolase A, enolase 1, β-actin, and tropomyosin 3 and that these interactions are maximized at the periphery of the apical membrane of doming proximal tubule cells. Together these observations reveal that MT-3 interacts with proteins involved in cytoskeletal organization and energy metabolism, and these interactions at the apical membrane support vectorial active transport and cell differentiation in proximal tubule cultures."

Heterogeneity exists between pulmonary endothelial cells derived from different vascular segments, yet the activity and isoform expression of NHEs between these vascular segments has not been fully examined. Utilizing the ammonium-prepulse and recovery from acidification technique in a buffer lacking bicarbonate, pulmonary microvascular and pulmonary artery endothelial cells exhibited unique recovery rates from the acid load dependent upon the concentration of the sodium transport inhibitor, amiloride; further, pulmonary artery endothelial cells required a higher dose of amiloride to inhibit sodium-dependent acid recovery compared to pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells, suggesting a unique complement of NHEs between the different endothelial cell types. While NHE1 has been described in pulmonary endothelial cells, all NHE isoforms have not been accounted for. To address NHE expression in endothelial cells, qPCR was performed. Using a two-gene normalization approach, Sdha and Ywhag were identified for qPCR normalization and analysis of NHE isoforms between pulmonary microvascular and pulmonary artery endothelial cells. NHE1 and NHE8 mRNA were equally expressed between the two cell types, but NHE5 expression was significantly higher in pulmonary microvascular versus pulmonary artery endothelial cells, which was confirmed at the protein level. Thus, pulmonary microvascular and pulmonary artery endothelial cells exhibit unique NHE isoform expression and have a unique response to acid load revealed through recovery from cellular acidification."
https://openalex.org/W4225386898,"The built environment plays a key role in promoting active mobility for healthy aging. Encouraging active mobility among older adults, however, can be especially challenging in more rural areas where distances tend to be longer and infrastructure is favoring car traffic. The association of older adults' perception of attributes of the built environment with cycling and e-biking for transport was investigated. The potential moderating effects of age, sex, and mobility impairments were explored. A cross-sectional survey was conducted in towns and communities of <100,000 inhabitants, including 2,144 participants (mean age: 74; 53% men). Three different cycling outcomes (any cycling/e-biking, frequency (≥3 days/week) and amount (minutes/week)) were analyzed among all cyclists and e-bike users separately, resulting in six dependent variables. The impact of ten environmental attributes on these outcomes was analyzed in separate models. Overall, street connectivity, and the proximity and number of destinations were most important. Only street connectivity and traffic safety were related to minutes cycling or e-biking per week. Cycling amount was higher overall for e-biking but fewer environmental attributes showed an association compared to any cycling, regardless of bicycle type. Traffic safety was not associated with four out of the six cycling outcomes and was inversely associated with minutes cycling or e-biking. Density was not related to any of the variables investigated. Several interaction effects of sex, age, and mobility impairments were found. Further research is needed on environmental attributes influencing e-bike use, the most important types of destinations, and a more differentiated assessment of perceived traffic safety in older adults."
https://openalex.org/W4225406366,"Sequence learning in serial reaction time tasks (SRTT) is an established, lab-based experimental paradigm to study acquisition and transfer of skill based on the detection of predictable stimulus and motor response sequences. Sequence learning has been mainly studied in key presses using visual target stimuli and is demonstrated by better performance in predictable sequences than in random sequences. In this study, we investigated sequence learning in the context of more complex locomotor responses. To this end, we developed a novel goal-directed stepping SRTT with auditory target stimuli in order to subsequently assess the effect of aging on sequence learning in this task, expecting that age-related performance reductions in postural control might disturb the acquisition of the sequence. We used pressure-sensitive floor mats to characterise performance across ten blocks of trials. In Experiment 1, 22 young adults demonstrated successful acquisition of the sequence in terms of the time to step on the target mat and percent error and thus validated our new paradigm. In Experiment 2, in order to contrast performance improvements in the stepping SRTT between 27 young and 22 old adults, motion capture of the feet was combined with the floor mat system to delineate individual movement phases during stepping onto a target mat. The latencies of several postural events as well as other movement parameters of a step were assessed. We observed significant learning effects in the latency of step initiation, the time to step on the target mat, and motion parameters such as stepping amplitude and peak stepping velocity, as well as in percent error. The data showed general age-related slowing but no significant performance differences in procedural locomotor sequence learning between young and old adults. The older adults also had comparable conscious representations of the sequence of stimuli as the young adults. We conclude that sequence learning occurred in this locomotor learning task that is much more complex than typical finger-tapping sequence learning tasks, and that healthy older adults showed similar learning effects compared to young adults, suggesting intact locomotor sequence learning capabilities despite general slowing and normal age-related decline in sensorimotor function."
https://openalex.org/W4225417701,"Even early in the COVID-19 pandemic, adherence to physical distancing measures was variable, exposing some communities to elevated risk. While cognitive factors from the Health Belief Model (HBM) and resilience correlate with compliance with physical distancing, external conditions may preclude full compliance with physical distancing guidelines. Our objective was to identify HBM and resilience constructs that could be used to improve adherence to physical distancing even when full compliance is not possible. We examined adherence as expressed through 7-day non-work, non-household contact rates in two cohorts: 1) adults in households with children from Minnesota and Iowa; and 2) adults ≥50 years-old from Minnesota, one-third of whom had Parkinson's disease. We identified multiple cognitive factors associated with physical distancing adherence, specifically perceived severity, benefits, self-efficacy, and barriers. However, the magnitude, and occasionally the direction, of these associations was population-dependent. In Cohort 1, perceived self-efficacy for remaining 6-feet from others was associated with a 29% lower contact rate (RR 0.71; 95% CI 0.65, 0.77). This finding was consistent across all race/ethnicity and income groups we examined. The barriers to adherence of having a child in childcare and having financial concerns had the largest effects among individuals from marginalized racial and ethnic groups and high-income households. In Cohort 2, self-efficacy to quarantine/isolate was associated with a 23% decrease in contacts (RR 0.77; 95% CI 0.66, 0.89), but upon stratification by education level, the association was only present for those with at least a Bachelor's degree. Education also modified the effect of the barrier to adherence leaving home for work, increasing contacts among those with a Bachelor's degree and reducing contacts among those without. Our findings suggest that public health messaging tailored to the identified cognitive factors has the potential to improve physical distancing adherence, but population-specific needs must be considered to maximize effectiveness."

It is cultivated and traded internationally due to its high-quality nuts thus, has significant development prospects and scientific research value. However, information on the genetic resources of Macadamia spp. remains scanty.The mitochondria (mt) genomes of three economically important Macadamia species, Macadamia integrifolia, M. ternifolia and M. tetraphylla, were assembled through the Illumina sequencing platform. The results showed that each species has 71 genes, including 42 protein-coding genes, 26 tRNAs, and 3 rRNAs. Repeated sequence analysis, RNA editing site prediction, and analysis of genes migrating from chloroplast (cp) to mt were performed in the mt genomes of the three Macadamia species. Phylogenetic analysis based on the mt genome of the three Macadamia species and 35 other species was conducted to reveal the evolution and taxonomic status of Macadamia. Furthermore, the characteristics of the plant mt genome, including genome size and GC content, were studied through comparison with 36 other plant species. The final non-synonymous (Ka) and synonymous (Ks) substitution analysis showed that most of the protein-coding genes in the mt genome underwent negative selections, indicating their importance in the mt genome.The findings of this study provide a better understanding of the Macadamia genome and will inform future research on the genus."

Clinical rotation studies failed to change unit-wide prevalence of antibiotic resistant bacteria (ARB) carriage, including an international cluster-randomized crossover study. Unit-wide effects may differ from individual effects due to ""ecological fallacy"". This post-hoc analysis of a cluster-randomized crossover study assesses differences between cycling and mixing rotation strategies in acquisition of carriage with Gram-negative ARB in individual patients.This was a controlled cluster-randomized crossover study in 7 ICUs in 5 European countries. Clinical cultures taken as routine care were used for endpoint assessment. Patients with a first negative culture and at least one culture collected in total were included. Community acquisitions (2 days of admission or less) were excluded. Primary outcome was ICU-acquisition of Enterobacterales species with reduced susceptibility to: third- or fourth generation cephalosporins or piperacillin-tazobactam, and Acinetobacter species and Pseudomonas aeruginosa with reduced susceptibility for piperacillin-tazobactam or carbapenems. Cycling (altering first-line empiric therapy for Gram-negative bacteria, every other 6-weeks), to mixing (changing antibiotic type every empiric antibiotic course). Rotated antibiotics were third- or fourth generation cephalosporins, piperacillin-tazobactam and carbapenems.For this analysis 1,613 admissions were eligible (855 and 758 during cycling and mixing, respectively), with 16,437 microbiological cultures obtained. Incidences of acquisition with ARB during ICU-stay were 7.3% (n = 62) and 5.1% (n = 39) during cycling and mixing, respectively (p-value 0.13), after a mean of 17.7 (median 15) and 20.8 (median 13) days. Adjusted odds ratio for acquisition of ARB carriage during mixing was 0.62 (95% CI 0.38 to 1.00). Acquired carriage with ARB were Enterobacterales species (n = 61), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 38) and Acinetobacter species (n = 20), with no statistically significant differences between interventions.There was no statistically significant difference in individual patients' risk of acquiring carriage with Gram-negative ARB during cycling and mixing. These findings substantiate the absence of difference between cycling and mixing on the epidemiology of Gram-negative ARB in ICU.This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, registered 10 January 2011, NCT01293071."
https://openalex.org/W4225147583,"The T7 primase-helicase plays a pivotal role in the replication of T7 DNA. Using affinity isolation of peptide-nucleic acid crosslinks and mass spectrometry, we identify protein regions in the primase-helicase and T7 DNA polymerase that form contacts with the RNA primer and DNA template. The contacts between nucleic acids and the primase domain of the primase-helicase are centered in the RNA polymerase subdomain of the primase domain, in a cleft between the N-terminal subdomain and the topoisomerase-primase fold. We demonstrate that residues along a beta sheet in the N-terminal subdomain that contacts the RNA primer are essential for phage growth and primase activity in vitro. Surprisingly, we found mutations in the primase domain that had a dramatic effect on the helicase. Substitution of a residue conserved in other DnaG-like enzymes, R84A, abrogates both primase and helicase enzymatic activities of the T7 primase-helicase. Alterations in this residue also decrease binding of the primase-helicase to ssDNA. However, mass photometry measurements show that these mutations do not interfere with the ability of the protein to form the active hexamer."

https://openalex.org/W4225404401,"Background Low uptake of family planning services by adolescent girls remains a public health concern. An estimated 120 out of every 1,000 girls aged 15 to 19 years are having unplanned pregnancies in the sub-Saharan region. Between January and June 2020, the Phalombe District of Malawi reported 3,030 adolescent pregnancies. At this stage, most Malawian schools were closed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The high rate of adolescent pregnancies prompted the Ministry of Health to provide emergency contraceptives to reduce the number of unplanned pregnancies among adolescents. The provision of emergency contraceptives would be effective if girls were willing and able to access these family planning services. We thus explored the views of school-going adolescent girls regarding their preferences for modern family planning methods including emergency contraceptives in Phalombe, Malawi. Methods This was a cross-sectional, descriptive study, where quantitative data were collected using a structured questionnaire. Participants included randomly sampled school-going adolescent girls from eight purposively selected secondary schools and eight randomly selected primary schools. All the schools were sampled from three purposively selected Traditional Authorities namely Nkhulambe, Jenala and Nkhumba which had reported high numbers of adolescent pregnancies. We analyzed the GeoPoints for schools and health facilities using ArcGIS, while adolescent girls’ views were analyzed using STATA. Results Participants included 388 adolescent girls, ranging in age from 10 to 19 years (median age = 15.5 years, SD = 1.9 years). Participants were hesitant to use contraceptives because they were afraid of being stigmatized and embarrassed, had to travel long distances to reach the service center, knew little about modern family planning and were afraid of medical complications. Conclusion The uptake of family planning services by adolescent girls can be improved by bringing healthcare services closer to schools and homes. Family planning services should employ health workers who are non-judgmental and who are able to remove the stigma associated with family planning. Health workers should at any given opportunity, address the misconceptions and beliefs that adolescents have towards contraceptives. Community sensitization and health talks should be done to improve adolescent girls’ understanding of family planning services."

Methods We conducted a nested case-control study using cryopreserved samples from persons who did and did not acquire HIV during the multinational Step clinical trial of the MRKAd5 HIV-1 vaccine. PBMCs from the last HIV-negative sample from incident HIV cases and controls were stimulated with Mtb -specific antigens (ESAT-6/CFP-10) and analyzed by flow cytometry with intracellular cytokine staining and scored with COMPASS. We measured inflammatory profiles with five Correlates of TB Risk (CoR) transcriptomic signatures. Our primary analysis examined the association of latent Mtb infection (LTBI; IFNγ+CD4+ T cell frequency) or RISK6 CoR signature with HIV acquisition. Conditional logistic regression analyses, adjusted for known predictors of HIV acquisition, were employed to assess whether TB-associated immune markers were associated with HIV acquisition. Results Among 465 participants, LTBI prevalence (21.5% controls vs 19.1% cases, p = 0.51) and the RISK6 signature were not higher in those who acquired HIV. In exploratory analyses, Mtb antigen-specific polyfunctional CD4+ T cell COMPASS scores (aOR 0.96, 95% CI 0.77, 1.20) were not higher in those who acquired HIV. Two CoR signatures, Sweeney3 (aOR 1.38 (1.07, 1.78) per SD change) and RESPONSE5 (0.78 (0.61, 0.98)), were associated with HIV acquisition. The transcriptomic pattern used to differentiate active vs latent TB (Sweeney3) was most strongly associated with acquiring HIV. Conclusions LTBI, Mtb polyfunctional antigen-specific CD4+ T cell activation, and RISK6 were not identified as risks for HIV acquisition. In exploratory transcriptomic analyses, two CoR signatures were associated with HIV risk after adjustment for known behavioral and clinical risk factors. We identified host gene expression signatures associated with HIV acquisition, but the observed effects are likely not mediated through Mtb infection."
https://openalex.org/W4225156108,"Inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1) is an evolutionarily conserved sensor of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and mediates a key branch of the unfolded protein response in eukaryotic cells. It is an ER-resident transmembrane protein that possesses Ser/Thr protein kinase and endoribonuclease (RNase) activities in its cytoplasmic region. IRE1 is activated through dimerization/oligomerization and autophosphorylation at multiple sites, acting through its RNase activity to restore the functional capacity of the ER. However, it remains poorly defined in vivo how the autophosphorylation events of endogenous IRE1 govern its dynamic activation and functional output. Here, we generated a mouse model harboring a S724A knock-in mutation (Ern1S724A/S724A) and investigated the importance of phosphorylation at Ser724 within the kinase activation loop of murine IRE1α. We found that in mouse embryonic fibroblast cells and in primary hepatocytes, S724A mutation resulted in markedly reduced IRE1α autophosphorylation in parallel with blunted activation of its RNase activity to catalyze X-box binding protein 1 (Xbp1) mRNA splicing. Furthermore, ablation of IRE1α phosphorylation at Ser724 exacerbated ER stress-induced hepatic steatosis in tunicamycin-treated Ern1S724A/S724A mice. This was accompanied by significantly decreased hepatic production of spliced XBP1 protein but increased CCAAT-enhancer-binding protein homologous protein (CHOP) level, along with suppressed expression of key metabolic regulators of fatty acid β-oxidation and lipid secretion. These results demonstrate a critical role of phosphorylation at Ser724 of IRE1α in dynamically controlling its kinase activity, and thus its autophosphorylation state, which is coupled to activation of its RNase activity in counteracting hepatic steatosis under ER stress conditions."

https://openalex.org/W4225376865,"Exercise is a valuable intervention modality for patients post-myocardial infarction (MI). Aerobic and resistance training are both commonly used separately in cardiac rehabilitation. However, the effect of aerobic interval exercise combined with alternating sets of resistance training (super-circuit training, SCT) on cardiac electrophysiologic and anthropometric measures had not been thoroughly investigated.The primary objective of this study was to compare the effectiveness of moderate-intensity continuous-aerobic training (CAT) vs. SCT on cardiac electrical measures (resting electrocardiographic, ECG; a nd heart rate variability, HRV) in patients' post-MI presenting reduced left ventricular function. Second, to examine its effect on anthropometric measures.Twenty-nine men post-MI with reduced left ventricular function were assigned randomly to either 12 weeks of CAT (n = 15) or SCT (n = 14). CAT group performed moderate-intensity activity. SCT group performed high-intensity exercise, alternating between resistance and aerobic training. Differences between CAT and SCT groups were done using independent t-tests, paired t-tests and effect size (ES).Participants in both groups improved their HRV measures (increase in HFnu; p < 0.05; ES > 0.51) and ECG (reduction in QT-dispersion; p < 0.05; ES > 0.51). Only the SCT group had significant improvements in waist circumference (p < 0.05).Exercise improves cardiac electrical measures post-MI. However, in comparison to CAT, SCT may yield greater anthropometric changes. In order to have improvements in cardiac electrical stability, clinicians working with post-MI patients may use both CAT and SCT. However, SCT might result in greater improvements."
https://openalex.org/W4225393559,"To improve the prediction accuracy of temperature and humidity in typical Chinese solar greenhouses, this paper proposed a new longwave/shortwave radiation modeling method using bond graph. This model takes into account sun position, useful incoming solar radiation model, sky longwave radiation model, inside longwave, and shortwave radiation model. The approach solves the problems caused by underestimating the effects of longwave radiation on night temperature and relative humidity. The study found that after a period of t = 7.5 h, with the increase of sun altitude angle, the internal temperature was significantly affected by the temperature rise of outside environment on sunny day. The sun altitude angle gradually falls over a period of t = 12.5 h (beginning at 12.30 p.m.). The decline in night temperature steadily slowed after a period of t = 20.5 h. On the other hand, the temperature variation has a multi-peak distribution and the warming rate of the CSG slows down on cloudy days. Furthermore, a good agreement between the experimental and simulation data were obtained, with a maximum temperature deviation of 2°C and maximum humidity deviation of 5%. The developed model is a universal and valuable approach that can be used for greenhouse climate simulation. Furthermore, it can be used as a support system during decision-making processes to help manage Chinese solar greenhouses more efficiently, which provides several control perspectives on the low-energy greenhouse in the future. This work has also provided several control perspectives on the low energy greenhouse in the future."
