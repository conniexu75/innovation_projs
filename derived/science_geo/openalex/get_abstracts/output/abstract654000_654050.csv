https://openalex.org/W3032971139,"Following the detection of the new coronavirus1 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and its spread outside of China, Europe has experienced large epidemics of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). In response, many European countries have implemented non-pharmaceutical interventions, such as the closure of schools and national lockdowns. Here we study the effect of major interventions across 11 European countries for the period from the start of the COVID-19 epidemics in February 2020 until 4 May 2020, when lockdowns started to be lifted. Our model calculates backwards from observed deaths to estimate transmission that occurred several weeks previously, allowing for the time lag between infection and death. We use partial pooling of information between countries, with both individual and shared effects on the time-varying reproduction number (Rt). Pooling allows for more information to be used, helps to overcome idiosyncrasies in the data and enables more-timely estimates. Our model relies on fixed estimates of some epidemiological parameters (such as the infection fatality rate), does not include importation or subnational variation and assumes that changes in Rt are an immediate response to interventions rather than gradual changes in behaviour. Amidst the ongoing pandemic, we rely on death data that are incomplete, show systematic biases in reporting and are subject to future consolidation. We estimate that-for all of the countries we consider here-current interventions have been sufficient to drive Rt below 1 (probability Rt < 1.0 is greater than 99%) and achieve control of the epidemic. We estimate that across all 11 countries combined, between 12 and 15 million individuals were infected with SARS-CoV-2 up to 4 May 2020, representing between 3.2% and 4.0% of the population. Our results show that major non-pharmaceutical interventions-and lockdowns in particular-have had a large effect on reducing transmission. Continued intervention should be considered to keep transmission of SARS-CoV-2 under control."
https://openalex.org/W3033094519,"Governments around the world are responding to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic1, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), with unprecedented policies designed to slow the growth rate of infections. Many policies, such as closing schools and restricting populations to their homes, impose large and visible costs on society; however, their benefits cannot be directly observed and are currently understood only through process-based simulations2–4. Here we compile data on 1,700 local, regional and national non-pharmaceutical interventions that were deployed in the ongoing pandemic across localities in China, South Korea, Italy, Iran, France and the United States. We then apply reduced-form econometric methods, commonly used to measure the effect of policies on economic growth5,6, to empirically evaluate the effect that these anti-contagion policies have had on the growth rate of infections. In the absence of policy actions, we estimate that early infections of COVID-19 exhibit exponential growth rates of approximately 38% per day. We find that anti-contagion policies have significantly and substantially slowed this growth. Some policies have different effects on different populations, but we obtain consistent evidence that the policy packages that were deployed to reduce the rate of transmission achieved large, beneficial and measurable health outcomes. We estimate that across these 6 countries, interventions prevented or delayed on the order of 61 million confirmed cases, corresponding to averting approximately 495 million total infections. These findings may help to inform decisions regarding whether or when these policies should be deployed, intensified or lifted, and they can support policy-making in the more than 180 other countries in which COVID-19 has been reported7. Analyses of COVID-19 infection rates show that non-pharmaceutical interventions achieved large, beneficial and measurable health outcomes in China, South Korea, Italy, Iran, France and the United States; these results may inform decisions on whether or when these interventions should be deployed, intensified or lifted."
https://openalex.org/W3033304694,"The overwhelming majority of participants in current genetic studies are of European ancestry. To elucidate disease biology in the East Asian population, we conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) with 212,453 Japanese individuals across 42 diseases. We detected 320 independent signals in 276 loci for 27 diseases, with 25 novel loci (P < 9.58 × 10-9). East Asian-specific missense variants were identified as candidate causal variants for three novel loci, and we successfully replicated two of them by analyzing independent Japanese cohorts; p.R220W of ATG16L2 (associated with coronary artery disease) and p.V326A of POT1 (associated with lung cancer). We further investigated enrichment of heritability within 2,868 annotations of genome-wide transcription factor occupancy, and identified 378 significant enrichments across nine diseases (false discovery rate < 0.05) (for example, NKX3-1 for prostate cancer). This large-scale GWAS in a Japanese population provides insights into the etiology of complex diseases and highlights the importance of performing GWAS in non-European populations."

https://openalex.org/W3033463761,"Enzymes are increasingly explored for use in asymmetric synthesis1-3, but their applications are generally limited by the reactions available to naturally occurring enzymes. Recently, interest in photocatalysis4 has spurred the discovery of novel reactivity from known enzymes5. However, so far photoinduced enzymatic catalysis6 has not been used for the cross-coupling of two molecules. For example, the intermolecular coupling of alkenes with α-halo carbonyl compounds through a visible-light-induced radical hydroalkylation, which could provide access to important γ-chiral carbonyl compounds, has not yet been achieved by enzymes. The major challenges are the inherent poor photoreactivity of enzymes and the difficulty in achieving stereochemical control of the remote prochiral radical intermediate7. Here we report a visible-light-induced intermolecular radical hydroalkylation of terminal alkenes that does not occur naturally, catalysed by an 'ene' reductase using readily available α-halo carbonyl compounds as reactants. This method provides an efficient approach to the synthesis of various carbonyl compounds bearing a γ-stereocentre with excellent yields and enantioselectivities (up to 99 per cent yield with 99 per cent enantiomeric excess), which otherwise are difficult to access using chemocatalysis. Mechanistic studies suggest that the formation of the complex of the substrates (α-halo carbonyl compounds) and the 'ene' reductase triggers the enantioselective photoinduced radical reaction. Our work further expands the reactivity repertoire of biocatalytic, synthetically useful asymmetric transformations by the merger of photocatalysis and enzyme catalysis."
https://openalex.org/W3033840227,"Senescent cells affect many physiological and pathophysiological processes. While select genetic and epigenetic elements for senescence induction have been identified, the dynamics, epigenetic mechanisms and regulatory networks defining senescence competence, induction and maintenance remain poorly understood, precluding the deliberate therapeutic targeting of senescence for health benefits. Here, we examined the possibility that the epigenetic state of enhancers determines senescent cell fate. We explored this by generating time-resolved transcriptomes and epigenome profiles during oncogenic RAS-induced senescence and validating central findings in different cell biology and disease models of senescence. Through integrative analysis and functional validation, we reveal links between enhancer chromatin, transcription factor recruitment and senescence competence. We demonstrate that activator protein 1 (AP-1) ‘pioneers’ the senescence enhancer landscape and defines the organizational principles of the transcription factor network that drives the transcriptional programme of senescent cells. Together, our findings enabled us to manipulate the senescence phenotype with potential therapeutic implications. Bischof and colleagues report that AP-1 bookmarks prospective senescence enhancers for future activation to achieve a timely execution of the senescence programme."
https://openalex.org/W3033596656,"Mammalian cells stably maintain high levels of DNA methylation despite expressing both positive (DNMT3A/B) and negative (TET1-3) regulators. Here, we analyzed the independent and combined effects of these regulators on the DNA methylation landscape using a panel of knockout human embryonic stem cell (ESC) lines. The greatest impact on global methylation levels was observed in DNMT3-deficient cells, including reproducible focal demethylation at thousands of normally methylated loci. Demethylation depends on TET expression and occurs only when both DNMT3s are absent. Dynamic loci are enriched for hydroxymethylcytosine and overlap with subsets of putative somatic enhancers that are methylated in ESCs and can be activated upon differentiation. We observe similar dynamics in mouse ESCs that were less frequent in epiblast stem cells (EpiSCs) and scarce in somatic tissues, suggesting a conserved pluripotency-linked mechanism. Taken together, our data reveal tightly regulated competition between DNMT3s and TETs at thousands of somatic regulatory sequences within pluripotent cells. Whole-genome bisulfite sequencing analysis of human embryonic stem cells shows that DNMT3 deficiency leads to global and local demethylation, which depends on TET activity. Dynamic loci overlap with putative somatic enhancers that are highly methylated in ESCs."
https://openalex.org/W3033680651,"Background Completion along continuum of care for maternal and newborn health (MNH) services like antenatal care, skilled birth attendance and postnatal care services is advantageous over each segment of services. It is one of the currently recommended strategies to reduce both maternal and neonatal mortality and achieve the global target of ending preventable maternal and under-five children’s mortality. Although studies on factors affecting each segment of MNH services have been well documented in Ethiopia, there is a dearth of evidence about the level of continuum of care and factors associated with it. This study was intended to fill this gap in evidence in the study area so that interventions could be taken to improve maternal and newborn health. Methods A community-basedcross-sectional study was conducted among 432 postnatal women who gave birth in the previous year in Arba Minch Health and Demographic Surveillance System (HDSS) site. Women were selected by computer generated random numbers from a list of women who stayed at least 6 weeks after birth. A pre-tested, structured, and interviewer-administered questionnaire was used for data collection. Data were entered and coded in Epi-data and analyzed using SPSS software version 23. Binary logistic regression model was fitted to identify factors associated with the dependent variable. Bivariate and multivariable analyses were fitted in steps to select candidate variables for multivariable analysis and to control for potential confounding effect respectively. Results The overall completion along the continuum of care was 42(9.7%). The factors significantly associated with completion of care along the continuumwere timely initiation of antenatalcare (before16weeks) [AOR: 10.7, CI (5.1, 22.7], birth preparedness and complication readiness [AOR: 2.9, CI (1.4, 6.1), pre-pregnancy contraception utilization [AOR: 3.9, CI: 1.4, 11.0], being employed [AOR: 2.6 CI:(1.3, 5.4)], and having a planned pregnancy [AOR:3.5 CI: (1.1, 11.4)]. Conclusion and recommendation Completion along the continuum of care for MNH services was low in the study area. Thus, efforts to improve the completion of care should focus on interventions that enhance early initiation of antenatal care, planned pregnancy, and birth preparedness and complication readiness."

https://openalex.org/W3033954082,"Retinoid X receptor (RXR) plays a pivotal role as a transcriptional regulator and serves as an obligatory heterodimerization partner for at least 20 other nuclear receptors (NRs). Given a potentially limiting/sequestered pool of RXR and simultaneous expression of several RXR partners, we hypothesized that NRs compete for binding to RXR and that this competition is directed by specific agonist treatment. Here, we tested this hypothesis on three NRs: peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ), vitamin D receptor (VDR), and retinoic acid receptor alpha (RARα). The evaluation of competition relied on a nuclear translocation assay applied in a three-color imaging model system by detecting changes in heterodimerization between RXRα and one of its partners (NR1) in the presence of another competing partner (NR2). Our results indicated dynamic competition between the NRs governed by two mechanisms. First, in the absence of agonist treatment, there is a hierarchy of affinities between RXRα and its partners in the following order: RARα > PPARγ > VDR. Second, upon agonist treatment, RXRα favors the liganded partner. We conclude that recruiting RXRα by the liganded NR not only facilitates a stimulus-specific cellular response but also might impede other NR pathways involving RXRα.

Nuclear receptors share a common structure composed of several functional domains: a ligand-independent N-terminal transcription activation function domain (AF-1), a DNA-binding domain (DBD), a flexible hinge region, and a ligand-binding domain (LBD), also functioning as a ligand-dependent transcription activation function domain (AF-2) at the C terminus (6Pawlak M.

The main function of the DBD is to bind to a specific DNA sequence called a response element (RE) (8Rastinejad F. Wagner T. Zhao Q. Khorasanizadeh S.

Moreover, the DBD also contributes to receptor heterodimerization and harbors between its two zinc finger motifs a nuclear localization signal, termed NLS1, mediating the nuclear localization of the receptors (11Vivat-Hannah V. Bourguet W. Gottardis M. Gronemeyer H. Separation of retinoid X receptor homo- and heterodimerization functions.Mol. Cell.

The LBD accommodates the core of NR actions, because it contains the ligand-binding pocket and regions that mediate dimer formation, coregulator binding, and ligand-dependent transactivation (12Huang P. Chandra V. Rastinejad F. Structural overview of the nuclear receptor superfamily: insights into physiology and therapeutics.Annu. Rev.

The mechanism of activation, called the molecular switch, is also a common characteristic of these receptors (13Dong D. Noy N. Heterodimer formation by retinoid X receptor: regulation by ligands and by the receptor’s self-association properties.Biochemistry. 1998; 37 (9692959): 10691-1070010.1021/bi980561rCrossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In the absence of the cognate ligand, the heterodimeric complex of RXR and its partner binds to DNA in its apo form and recruits corepressors, leading to a transcriptionally repressed state. The liganded receptors change their conformation to their holo form, which reduces their affinity for corepressors and leads to coactivator binding and transcription initiation (14Nagy L. Schwabe J.W. Mechanism of the nuclear receptor molecular switch.Trends Biochem.

This similarity in structure, mechanism of activation, and sharing of coregulators suggest cross-talk between the members of this NR family and a competition for the common binding partners, i.e. for RXR, coactivator, or DNA binding sites (15Chan L.S.

We hypothesized that there is a competition between RXR partners for binding to RXR and that binding of a specific agonist increases the affinity of a given receptor to RXR and favors their heterodimerization. RXRα and three NR partners were included in this study: PPARγ, VDR, and RARα. The present work was undertaken to better understand RXRα partitioning between its different heterodimeric partners in the absence and presence of their cognate agonists. This may have pharmacological implications by improving the current usage of the present drugs in triggering specific signaling pathways and may explain how targeting one NR pathway can interfere with a seemingly distinct NR pathway. We hypothesized that competition for heterodimerization with RXR is dictated, at least in part, by the availability of the partner-specific agonist. To test this hypothesis, we developed a robust system relying on a nuclear translocation assay applied in a three-color imaging model system by detecting changes in heterodimerization between RXRα and one of its partners (NR1) in the presence of another competing partner (NR2). To this end, NR1 was present in a form showing homogeneous distribution when expressed alone and translocating into the nucleus when interacting with RXRα (for details, see Fig. 1 and Experimental procedures). In this system, fluorescent proteins attached N-terminally to the NRs: TagBFP, EGFP, and mCherry (indicated as prefixes B-, G-, and C-, respectively, to the NRs throughout the text). To minimize the influence of endogenously expressed NRs on the observed results, we used wt HEK293 cells, which express the NRs involved in our study at low/medium levels. Using publicly available RNA-seq data from WT HEK-293T cells (30Philippe L. van den Elzen A.M.G. Watson M.J. Thoreen C.C. Global analysis of LARP1 translation targets reveals tunable and dynamic features of 5’ TOP motifs.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

We also generated a stable cell line, HEKB-RXRα, overexpressing B-RXRα. According to our immunofluorescence and Western blot analyses, the endogenous RXR expression level in WT HEK293 is ca. one-fourth the level in HEKB-RXRα (Fig. S1A–D). First, we expressed NRs tagged with EGFP and studied their changes of localization in response to the addition of ligands and coexpression of RXRα using the WT HEK293 and HEK293B-RXRα cell lines. G-PPARγ and G-RARα were localized mainly in the nucleus (Fig. 2A), even in the absence of exogenously added RXRα or agonist. To impede the nuclear transport of these NRs in the absence of RXRα, we induced a mutation in the nuclear localization signal, NLS1 (denoted /nlsm). We then observed the subcellular distribution of these NLS mutant receptors (G-PPARγ/nlsm and G-RARα/nlsm) in WT HEK293 cells and studied the effect of specific agonist treatment (rosiglitazone [RSG] and AM580, respectively) on their localization. As shown in Fig. 2C, the nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratio (NCR) for G-PPARγ/nlsm and G-RARα/nlsm was around 1 irrespective of ligand treatment, i.e. these homogeneously distributed mutant receptors did not show considerable enrichment in the nucleus. We next transfected the NLS mutant receptors into HEK293B-RXRα cells to see the effect of dimerization with RXRα on their localization (Fig. 2B and C). We detected a 6-fold enrichment in the nucleus for G-PPARγ/nlsm and 5-fold for G-RARα/nlsm. Specific agonist treatment caused a further increase in the nuclear accumulation of these receptors. Contrary to both G-PPARγ and G-RARα, G-VDR (expressed alone in WT HEK293 cells in the absence of agonist) was distributed in the cell with an NCR of ∼2 (Fig. 2C). Treatment with a specific agonist, calcitriol (cal), or coexpression of RXRα (using HEK293B-RXRα cells) enhanced the translocation of G-VDR to the nucleus, resulting in an NCR value of ∼3. Expressing G-VDR in HEK293B-RXRα combined with calcitriol treatment led to an even higher NCR value of ∼6 (Fig. 2B and C). Because WT VDR showed an increased localization in the nucleus in the presence of RXRα, it could be used in its WT form to detect heterodimerization with RXRα. The next question was whether DNA binding of RXRα plays a role in the RXRα-dependent nuclear enrichment of NR1 or depends merely on heterodimerization. Therefore, a similar experiment was carried out in which RXRα was expressed either as a zinc finger mutant, RXRα/znm, or as an NLS mutant, RXRα/nlsm. RXRα/znm had a nuclear localization similar to that of WT RXRα despite lacking a direct DNA binding capability (which is mediated through the two zinc finger motifs in the DBD), whereas the mutation in the NLS1 of RXRα resulted in a homogeneous distribution of RXRα/nlsm (Fig. 2D and E). Interestingly, RXRα/znm boosted translocation of NR1 into the nucleus just as effectively as WT RXRα did, whereas RXRα/nlsm failed to do so (Fig. 2C). Thus, nuclear enrichment of NR1 in the presence of RXRα is because of heterodimerization rather than binding to DNA. As we have learned before from Fig. 2B and C, calcitriol treatment alone could cause nuclear enrichment of its cognate receptor, VDR, and, intriguingly, when VDR was coexpressed with RXRα/nlsm, both of these homogeneously distributed receptors were enriched in the nucleus upon calcitriol treatment (Fig. 2F). In summary, the mutation in NLS1 abolished the spontaneous nuclear accumulation of RARα and PPARγ but conserved their ability to heterodimerize with RXRα and to bind their ligands efficiently. Because G-PPARγ/nlsm, G-RARα/nlsm, and WT G-VDR had homogeneous distribution when expressed alone and moved to the nucleus when heterodimerizing with RXRα, irrespective of the presence or absence of ligand, they could serve as a suitable model system in our study (we refer to them later as NR1). Via a piggy-back mechanism (31Tyagi R.K. Amazit L. Lescop P. Milgrom E. Guiochon-Mantel A. Mechanisms of progesterone receptor export from nuclei: role of nuclear localization signal, nuclear export signal, and ran guanosine triphosphate.Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12 (9817595): 1684-169510.1210/mend.12.11.0197Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), the NR1-RXRα heterodimeric complex translocated into the nucleus depending on the NLS of RXRα. In all competition experiments, the combined expression level of NR1 and NR2 was higher than that of RXRα, (NR1 + NR2) > RXRα, resulting in a limiting pool of RXRα. This was assessed by comparing the relative fluorescence intensities of the fluorescent protein labels of the NRs to those of EGFP-mCherry and EGFP-TagBFP fusion proteins expressing the fluorescent proteins at a 1:1 ratio (see Experimental procedures). Competition between PPARγ and RARα for binding to RXRα was assessed by tracing the distribution changes of G-PPARγ/nlsm (NR1) in HEK293B-RXRα in the presence of C-RARα (NR2) and cognate agonists. Nuclear accumulation of G-PPARγ/nlsm in HEK293B-RXRα was strikingly reduced when cells were additionally cotransfected with C-RARα; G-PPARγ/nlsm became homogeneously distributed with an NCR value of ∼1, similar to the case when expressed alone in WT HEK293. Treatment with RSG caused a 4-fold nuclear enrichment of G-PPARγ/nlsm, whereas AM580 or LG268 (RXR agonist) treatment kept G-PPARγ/nlsm homogeneously distributed (Fig. 3A and B). The challenge was to prove that dominance of RARα over PPARγ in competing for RXRα was not because of expressing mutant PPARγ and intact RARα; therefore, a complementary experiment was also carried out. Here, the changes in the distribution of G-RARα/nlsm (NR1) were traced in HEK293B-RXRα in the presence of C-PPARγ (NR2) and agonists. The results were consistent with our previous observation; C-PPARγ failed to inhibit binding of G-RARα/nlsm to B-RXRα. G-RARα/nlsm was still dominantly located in the nucleus with an NCR of ∼5.5, and this was further enhanced by AM580 treatment. On the other hand, RSG treatment facilitated the recovery of C-PPARγ binding to RXRα and led to a homogeneous redistribution of G-RARα/nlsm (Fig. 3C and D). We were interested in how the affinities of liganded RARα and liganded PPARγ toward RXRα compare. To answer this question, we first treated our samples with saturating doses of RSG and AM580 simultaneously. G-RARα/nlsm and G-PPARγ/nlsm responded to the double treatment similarly to AM580 treatment alone, i.e. G-RARα/nlsm became nucleus localized, whereas G-PPARγ/nlsm remained homogeneous (Fig. 3). This implies that liganded RARα has a higher affinity toward RXRα than liganded PPARγ. We then cotreated the cells with RSG, the agonist of the weak partner, at its saturating dose (1 μm) and titrated AM580, the ligand of the dominant partner, from 0 to saturation, 100 nm. RSG-dependent nuclear enrichment of G-PPARγ/nlsm in HEK293B-RXRα cotransfected with C-RARα was abolished gradually with increasing doses of AM580 (Fig. 3E). In summary, these data show that in the absence of an agonist, RARα has a higher binding affinity to RXRα than PPARγ, whereas treatment with a specific PPARγ agonist, RSG, tips the scale in favor of PPARγ. We next investigated the competition between VDR and RARα in a similar way. The enrichment of G-RARα/nlsm in the nucleus of HEK293B-RXRα was reduced in the presence of C-VDR; the NCR decreased from 5.5 to 3.8, as shown in Fig. 4B. Treatment with agonists had a considerable effect on the redistribution of their cognate receptors. Whereas the nuclear accumulation of G-RARα/nlsm was augmented by AM580 treatment, it was abolished by calcitriol treatment, after which G-RARα/nlsm was distributed more homogeneously in HEK293B-RXRα, just as in WT HEK293. Simultaneous treatment with AM580 and calcitriol increased the NCR value to ∼6, even more than that of AM580 alone. LG268 treatment had no impact on this competition (Fig. 4A and B). Associated changes in the localization of C-VDR are shown in Fig. 4C; treatment with AM580 kept C-VDR in the cytoplasm, whereas calcitriol induced its nuclear translocation with an NCR of ∼5. Interestingly, double treatment with AM580 and calcitriol increased the NCR value to ∼6.6. The complementary experiment was also carried out as in the previous case: changes of G-VDR localization in HEK293B-RXRα were monitored in the presence of the competing partner, C-RARα. G-VDR failed to maintain its nuclear accumulation in HEK293B-RXRα when cells were cotransfected with C-RARα and redistributed homogeneously with NCR values similar to those in WT HEK293. Calcitriol treatment abolished the dominance of C-RARα over G-VDR in competing for RXRα and boosted the nuclear accumulation of VDR, resulting in an NCR value of ∼5, whereas calcitriol treatment in combination with AM580 resulted in an NCR of ∼4 (Fig. 4E). In summary, RXRα is more likely to heterodimerize with RARα than with VDR, unless VDR gets liganded with its specific agonist, calcitriol. To investigate the competition between PPARγ and VDR, we first assessed changes of the NCR of G-PPARγ/nlsm in HEK293B-RXRα ensuing in the presence of C-VDR and specific agonists. As shown in Fig. 5A and B, without ligand, the nuclear accumulation of G-PPARγ/nlsm was diminished in cells coexpressing C-VDR (from an NCR of 6 to 3.7), although to a lesser extent than that because of C-RARα (Fig. 3B). Agonist treatment shifted competition between the NRs in favor of the liganded partner. RSG treatment induced G-PPARγ/nlsm enrichment in the nucleus of triply transfected cells, whereas calcitriol redistributed G-PPARγ/nlsm within HEK293B-RXRα cells with an NCR value equaling that measured in WT cells. Double treatment with RSG and calcitriol increased the NCR value of G-PPARγ/nlsm to ∼4.4, favoring again the binding of RXRα to G-PPARγ/nlsm and abolishing the effect of calcitriol. LG268 did not affect the competition: G-PPARγ/nlsm remained nucleus localized. Changes in the localization of C-VDR are shown in Fig. 5C. In these triply transfected cells, C-VDR was homogeneously distributed in the absence of ligand and upon RSG or LG268 treatment, whereas its NCR value increased to ∼4 after treatment with calcitriol alone and to ∼4.5 in combination with RSG. Second, in the complementary experiment, we traced localization changes of G-VDR in HEK293B-RXRα cells cotransfected with C-PPARγ and treated with the above-mentioned agonists (Fig. 5D and E). Without agonist treatment, the NCR of G-VDR was ∼2, similar to its value in WT HEK293. RSG or LG268 treatment kept the NCR of VDR low, impeding the interaction between VDR and RXRα, whereas calcitriol boosted the NCR of G-VDR to ∼4.8 when applied alone and to ∼4 when in combination with RSG. To exclude the effect of endogenously produced PPARγ ligands on our results, we also used a PPARγ antagonist (GW9662) to displace endogenous ligands. This antagonist enhances corepressor binding and stabilizes PPARγ in its apo (nonliganded) conformation (32Daniel B. Nagy G. Czimmerer Z. Horvath A. Hammers D.W. Cuaranta-Monroy I. Poliska S. Tzerpos P. Kolostyak Z. Hays T.T. Patsalos A. Houtman R. Sauer S. Francois-Deleuze J. Rastinejad F. et al.The nuclear receptor PPARgamma controls progressive macrophage polarization as a ligand-insensitive epigenomic ratchet of transcriptional memory.Immunity. 2018; 49 (30332629): 615-62610.1016/j.immuni.2018.09.005Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The dominance of PPARγ over VDR was retained even when GW9662 was present (Fig. 5F), suggesting that this dominance was not because of binding endogenous agonists. In summary, RSG treatment favors RXRα heterodimerization with PPARγ and calcitriol augments VDR binding to RXRα, whereas without agonists RXRα binds to PPARγ with a higher affinity. In contrast to NLS mutants of PPARγ and RARα, G-VDR/nlsm showed a cytoplasmic distribution in WT HEK293 cells (NCR of ∼0.6) and remained so even in HEK293B-RXRα cells (Fig. 6A and B). Intriguingly, even RXRα followed G-VDR/nlsm to the cytoplasm, indicating that G-VDR/nlsm was competent to heterodimerize with RXRα but the heterodimeric complex failed to translocate to the nucleus. Therefore, we also traced changes in the localization of B-RXRα to detect the presence or absence of heterodimerization with G-VDR/nlsm (Fig. 6C). Specific agonist treatment had an interesting effect. In WT HEK293, the NCR of G-VDR/nlsm was doubled upon treatment with calcitriol, reaching a value of ∼1.3 (Fig. 6B). Moreover, both G-VDR/nlsm and RXRα became enriched in the nucleus of HEK293B-RXRα cells upon calcitriol treatment; the NCR of G-VDR/nlsm increased to ∼3.3 (Fig. 6B), and that of B-RXRα was restored to ∼5, close to its normal value (Fig. 6C). In competition experiments between G-VDR/nlsm and C-RARα in HEK293B-RXRα cells, RXRα was enriched in the nucleus together with PPARγ rather than being sequestered in the cytoplasm with VDR/nlsm, suggesting the preference of RXRα for RARα over VDR (Fig. 6D). Similarly, when G-VDR/nlsm and C-PPARγ were cotransfected in HEK293B-RXRα cells, RXR was trapped in the nucleus where PPARγ resided rather than colocalizing with VDR/nlsm in the cytoplasm. This also indicated the dominance of PPARγ over VDR (Fig. 6E). In both experiments, G-VDR/nlsm became slightly enriched in the nucleus of HEK293B-RXRα after treatment with calcitriol (Fig. 6D and E). In summary, results on VDR/nlsm without ligand treatment are in accordance with those gained with WT VDR, indicating the dominance of both RARα and PPARγ over VDR. The role of calcitriol in the competition is less obvious in the case of VDR/nlsm. We have shown that NRs compete for RXRα and revealed differences in the binding affinities between RXRα and its partners. Competition was observed in a situation where the combined expression levels of NR1 and NR2 were larger than that of RXRα alone; therefore, RXRα was lim"
https://openalex.org/W3033344456,"Camera trapping is the standard field method of monitoring cryptic, low-density mammal populations. Typically, researchers run camera surveys for 60 to 90 days and estimate density using closed population spatially explicit capture-recapture (SCR) models. The SCR models estimate density, capture probability (g0), and a scale parameter (σ) that reflects ranging behaviour. We used a year of camera data from 20 camera stations to estimate the density of male jaguars (Panthera onca) in the Cockscomb Basin Wildlife Sanctuary in Belize, using closed population SCR models. We subsampled the dataset into 276 90-day sessions and 186 180-day sessions. Estimated density fluctuated from 0.51 to 5.30 male jaguars / 100 km2 between the 90-day sessions, with comparatively robust and precise estimates for the 180-day sessions (0.73 to 3.75 male jaguars / 100 km2). We explain the variation in density estimates from the 90-day sessions in terms of temporal variation in social behaviour, specifically male competition and mating events during the three-month wet season. Density estimates from the 90-day sessions varied with σ, but not with the number of individuals detected, suggesting that variation in density was almost fully attributable to changes in estimated ranging behaviour. We found that the models overestimated σ when compared to the mean ranging distance derived from GPS tracking data from two collared individuals in the camera grid. Overestimation of σ when compared to GPS collar data was more pronounced for the 180-day sessions than the 90-day sessions. We conclude that one-off ('snap-shot') short-term, small-scale camera trap surveys do not sufficiently sample wide-ranging large carnivores. When using SCR models to estimate the density from these data, we caution against the use of poor sampling designs and/or misinterpretation of scope of inference. Although the density estimates from one-off, short-term, small-scale camera trap surveys may be statistically accurate within each short-term sampling period, the variation between density estimates from multiple sessions throughout the year illustrate that the estimates obtained should be carefully interpreted and extrapolated, because different factors, such as temporal stochasticity in behaviour of a few individuals, may have strong repercussions on density estimates. Because of temporal variation in behaviour, reliable density estimates will require larger samples of individuals and spatial recaptures than those presented in this study (mean +/- SD = 14.2 +/- 1.2 individuals, 37.7 +/- 4.7 spatial recaptures, N = 276 sessions), which are representative of, or higher than published sample sizes. To satisfy the need for larger samples, camera surveys will need to be more expansive with a higher density of stations. In the absence of this, we advocate longer sampling periods and subsampling through time as a means of understanding and describing stability or variation between density estimates."
https://openalex.org/W3034043614,"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory and demyelinating disease of the central nervous system (CNS) that results in variable severities of neurodegeneration. The understanding of MS has been limited by the inaccessibility of the affected cells and the lengthy timeframe of disease development. However, recent advances in stem cell technology have facilitated the bypassing of some of these challenges. Towards gaining a greater understanding of the innate potential of stem cells from people with varying degrees of disability, we generated induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from peripheral blood mononuclear cells derived from stable and progressive MS patients, and then further differentiated them into oligodendrocyte (OL) lineage cells. We analyzed differentiation under both homeostatic and inflammatory conditions via sustained exposure to low-dose interferon gamma (IFNγ), a prominent cytokine in MS. We found that all iPSC lines differentiated into mature myelinating OLs, but chronic exposure to IFNγ dramatically inhibited differentiation in both MS groups, particularly if exposure was initiated during the pre-progenitor stage. Low-dose IFNγ was not toxic but led to an early upregulation of interferon response genes in OPCs followed by an apparent redirection in lineage commitment from OL to a neuron-like phenotype in a significant portion of the treated cells. Our results reveal that a chronic low-grade inflammatory environment may have profound effects on the efficacy of regenerative therapies."

We previously analyzed miRNA expression profiles in Laoshan dairy goat mammary glands at the early (20 d postpartum), peak (90 d postpartum) and late lactation (210 d postpartum) stages. To further enrich and clarify the miRNA expression profiles during the lactation physiological cycle, we sequenced miRNAs in the mammary gland tissues of Laoshan dairy goats at three newly selected stages: the late lactation (240 d postpartum), dry period (300 d postpartum) and late gestation (140 d after mating) stages. We obtained 4038 miRNAs and 385 important miRNA families, including mir-10, let-7 and mir-9. We also identified 754 differentially expressed miRNAs in the mammary gland tissue at the 3 different stages and 6 groups of miRNA clusters that had unique expression patterns. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analyses showed that GO terms such as mammary gland development (GO:0030879) and mammary gland morphogenesis (GO:0060443) and important signaling pathways, including the insulin signaling pathway (chx04910), hippo signaling pathway (chx04390) and estrogen signaling pathway (chx04915), were enriched. We screened miRNAs and potential target genes that may be involved in the regulation of lactation, mammary gland growth and differentiation, cell apoptosis, and substance transport and synthesis and detected the expression patterns of important genes at the three stages. These miRNAs and critical target genes may be important factors for mammary gland development and lactation regulation and potentially valuable molecular markers, which may provide a theoretical reference for further investigation of mammary gland physiology."

https://openalex.org/W3033104124,"The cuprizone induced animal model of demyelination is characterized by demyelination in many regions of the brain with high levels of demyelination in the corpus callosum as well as changes in neuronal function by 4-6 weeks of exposure. The model is used as a tool to study demyelination and subsequent degeneration as well as therapeutic interventions on these effects. Historically, the cuprizone model has been shown to contain no alterations to blood-brain barrier integrity, a key feature in many diseases that affect the central nervous system. Cuprizone is generally administered for 4-6 weeks to obtain maximal demyelination and degeneration. However, emerging evidence has shown that the effects of cuprizone on the brain may occur earlier than measurable gross demyelination. This study sought to investigate changes to blood-brain barrier permeability early in cuprizone administration. Results showed an increase in blood-brain barrier permeability and changes in tight junction protein expression as early as 3 days after beginning cuprizone treatment. These changes preceded glial morphological activation and demyelination known to occur during cuprizone administration. Increases in mast cell presence and activity were measured alongside the increased permeability implicating mast cells as a potential source for the blood-brain barrier disruption. These results provide further evidence of blood-brain barrier alterations in the cuprizone model and a target of therapeutic intervention in the prevention of cuprizone-induced pathology. Understanding how mast cells become activated under cuprizone and if they contribute to blood-brain barrier alterations may give further insight into how and when the blood-brain barrier is affected in CNS diseases. In summary, cuprizone administration causes an increase in blood-brain barrier permeability and this permeability coincides with mast cell activation."

Next-generation sequencing (NGS) of genomic DNA was used to obtain 16 new mitogenomes of Darevskia. These, along with 35 sequences downloaded from GenBank: genera Darevskia, Zootoca, Podarcis, Phoenicolacerta, Takydromus, Lacerta, and Eremias-were used in the analysis. All four analytical methods (Bayesian Inference, BI; Maximum Likelihood, ML; Maximum Parsimony, MP; and Neighbor-Joining, NJ) showed almost congruent intra-generic topologies for Darevskia and other lizard genera. However, ML and NJ methods on one side, and BI and MP methods on the other harvested conflicting phylogenies. The ML/NJ topology supports earlier published separation of Darevskia into three mitochondrial clades (Murphy, Fu, Macculloch, Darevsky, and Kupinova, 2000), but BI and MP topologies support that the basal branching occurred between D. parvula from the western Lesser Caucasus and the rest of Darevskia. All topologies altered the phylogenetic position of some individual species, including D. daghestanica, D. derjugini, and D. chlorogaster. Reanalysis after excluding four saturated genes from the data set, and excluding genus Eremias gives fully convergent topologies. The most basal branching for true lizards was between Far Eastern Takydromus and the Western Eurasian genera (BI). Comparing phylogenetic performance of individual genes relative to whole mitogenome data, concatenated 16S RNA (the least saturated gene in our analyses) and Cytochrome b genes generate a robust phylogeny that is fully congruent with that based on the complete mitogenome."

Cordyceps sinensis polysaccharide (CSP) is a soluble dietary fiber known to have protective effects against obesity and related diseases, but whether these effects induce any side effects remains unknown. The function and safety of CSP were tested in high-fat diet (HFD)-feding C57BL/6J mice. The results revealed that even though CSP supplementation could prevent an increase in body weight, it aggravated liver fibrosis and steatosis as evidenced by increased inflammation, lipid metabolism markers, insulin resistance (IR) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) in HFD-induced obesity. 16S rDNA gene sequencing was used to analyze the gut microbiota composition, and the relative abundance of the Actinobacteria phylum, including the Olsenella genus, was significantly higher in CSP-treated mice than in HFD-fed mice. CSP supplementation may increase the proportion of Actinobacteria, which can degrade CSP. The high level of Actinobacteria aggravated the disorder of the intestinal flora and contributed to the progression from obesity to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and related diseases."

https://openalex.org/W3033356291,"Dental enamel thickness, topography, growth and development vary among hominins. In Homo, the thickness of dental enamel in most Pleistocene hominins display variations from thick to hyper-thick, while Neanderthals exhibit proportionally thinner enamel. The origin of the thin trait remains unclear. In this context, the Middle Pleistocene human dental assemblage from Atapuerca-Sima de los Huesos (SH) provides a unique opportunity to trace the evolution of enamel thickness in European hominins. In this study, we aim to test the hypothesis if the SH molar sample approximates the Neanderthal condition for enamel thickness and/or distribution. This study includes 626 molars, both original and comparative data. We analysed the molar inner structural organization of the original collections (n = 124), belonging to SH(n = 72) and modern humans from Spanish origin (n = 52). We compared the SH estimates to those of extinct and extant populations of the genus Homo from African, Asian and European origin (estimates extracted from literature n = 502). The comparative sample included maxillary and mandibular molars belonging to H. erectus, East and North African Homo, European Middle Pleistocene Homo, Neanderthals, and fossil and extant H. sapiens. We used high-resolution images to investigate the endostructural configuration of SH molars (tissue proportions, enamel thickness and distribution). The SH molars exhibit on average thick absolute and relative enamel in 2D and 3D estimates, both in the complete crown and the lateral enamel. This primitive condition is shared with the majority of extinct and extant hominin sample, except for Neanderthals and some isolated specimens. On the contrary, the SH molar enamel distribution maps reveal a distribution pattern similar to the Neanderthal signal (with thicker enamel on the lingual cusps and more peripherally distributed), compared to H. antecessor and modern humans. Due to the phylogenetic position of the SH population, the thick condition in molars could represent the persistence of the plesiomorphic condition in this group. Still, more data is needed on other Early and Middle Pleistocene populations to fully understand the evolutionary meaning of this trait."
https://openalex.org/W3033006668,"The causative factors underlying conformational conversion of cellular prion protein (PrPC) into its infectious counterpart (PrPSc) during prion infection remain undetermined, in part because of a lack of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that can distinguish these conformational isoforms. Here we show that the anti-PrP mAb PRC7 recognizes an epitope that is shielded from detection when glycans are attached to Asn-196. We observed that whereas PrPC is predisposed to full glycosylation and is therefore refractory to PRC7 detection, prion infection leads to diminished PrPSc glycosylation at Asn-196, resulting in an unshielded PRC7 epitope that is amenable to mAb recognition upon renaturation. Detection of PRC7-reactive PrPSc in experimental and natural infections with various mouse-adapted scrapie strains and with prions causing deer and elk chronic wasting disease and transmissible mink encephalopathy uncovered that incomplete PrPSc glycosylation is a consistent feature of prion pathogenesis. We also show that interrogating the conformational properties of the PRC7 epitope affords a direct means of distinguishing different prion strains. Because the specificity of our approach for prion detection and strain discrimination relies on the extent to which N-linked glycosylation shields or unshields PrP epitopes from antibody recognition, it dispenses with the requirement for additional standard manipulations to distinguish PrPSc from PrPC, including evaluation of protease resistance. Our findings not only highlight an innovative and facile strategy for prion detection and strain differentiation, but are also consistent with a mechanism of prion replication in which structural instability of incompletely glycosylated PrP contributes to the conformational conversion of PrPC to PrPSc."

This study, therefore, assessed the prevalence of the trio, and mapped their spatial distribution in the 20 administrative regions of Ogun State, Nigeria. Methods Parasitological surveys were carried out in 1,499 households across 33 spatially selected communities. Fresh stool samples were collected from 1,027 consenting participants and processed using ether concentration method. The locations of the communities were georeferenced using a GPS device while demographic data were obtained using a standardized form. Data were analysed using SPSS software and visualizations and plotting maps were made in ArcGIS software. Results Findings showed that 19 of the 20 regions were endemic for one or more kind of the three infections, with an aggregated prevalence of 17.2%. Ascariasis was the most frequently observed parasitic infection in 28 communities with a prevalence of 13.6%, followed by hookworm infections with a prevalence of 4.6% while Trichuriasis was the least encountered with a prevalence of 1.7%. The spatial distribution of infections ranges between 5.3–49.2% across the regions. The highest and lowest distribution of overall helminth infections was recorded in Egbado South and Egbado North respectively. Nine regions had infection status between 20.0%-49.2%, while 10 regions had infection status between 5.3%-15.8%. Conclusion This study provides epidemiological data on the prevalence and spatial distribution of ascariasis, trichuriasis and hookworm infections which will add to the baseline data and guide the public health officers in providing appropriate control strategies in the endemic communities."

However, in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, a few proteins devoid of a signal peptide are still translocated into the ER and then N-glycosyl-ated. Using signal peptide-truncated reporter proteins, here we report the detection of significant translocation of N-terminal signal peptide-truncated proteins in a yeast mutant strain (ste24Δ) that lacks the endopeptidase Ste24 at the ER membrane. Furthermore, several ER/cytosolic proteins, including Sec61, Sec66, and Sec72, were identified as being involved in the translocation process. On the basis of screening for 20 soluble proteins that may be N-glycosylated in the ER in the ste24Δ strain, we identified the transcription factor Rme1 as a protein that is partially N-glycosylated despite the lack of a signal peptide. These results clearly indicate that some proteins lacking a signal peptide can be translocated into the ER and that Ste24 typically suppresses this process. Soluble proteins destined for the secretory pathway contain an N-terminal signal peptide that induces their translocation into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The importance of N-terminal signal peptides for ER translocation has been extensively examined over the past few decades. However, in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, a few proteins devoid of a signal peptide are still translocated into the ER and then N-glycosyl-ated. Using signal peptide-truncated reporter proteins, here we report the detection of significant translocation of N-terminal signal peptide-truncated proteins in a yeast mutant strain (ste24Δ) that lacks the endopeptidase Ste24 at the ER membrane. Furthermore, several ER/cytosolic proteins, including Sec61, Sec66, and Sec72, were identified as being involved in the translocation process. On the basis of screening for 20 soluble proteins that may be N-glycosylated in the ER in the ste24Δ strain, we identified the transcription factor Rme1 as a protein that is partially N-glycosylated despite the lack of a signal peptide. These results clearly indicate that some proteins lacking a signal peptide can be translocated into the ER and that Ste24 typically suppresses this process. The necessity of a signal peptide for protein transport into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) was originally demonstrated by Blobel and Dobberstein (1Blobel G. Dobberstein B. Transfer of proteins across membranes. I. Presence of proteolytically processed and unprocessed nascent immunoglobulin light chains on membrane-bound ribosomes of murine myeloma.J. Cell Biol. 1975; 67 (811671): 835-85110.1083/jcb.67.3.835Crossref PubMed Scopus (1760) Google Scholar). Various signal peptides are now known to be required for protein transport into each organelle, such as the ER, mitochondria, or peroxisomes, and serve as important targeting signals (2Kunze M. Berger J. The similarity between N-terminal targeting signals for protein import into different organelles and its evolutionary relevance.Front. Physiol. 2015; 6 (26441678): 25910.3389/fphys.2015.00259Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The N-terminal signal peptide targeting the ER is typically 20∼30 amino acids long and consists of three regions (3Heijine V.G. The signal peptide.J. Membr. Biol. 1990; 115: 195-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (804) Google Scholar). The N, middle, and C regions contain positively charged amino acids, hydrophobic residues, and alanine units, respectively, with the most important region being the middle one, which has a hydrophobic nature (4Nilsson I. Lara P. Hessa T. Johnson A.E. Heijne G.V. Karamyshev A.L. The code for directing proteins for translocation across ER membrane: SRP cotranslationally recognizes specific features of a signal sequence.J. Mol. Biol. 2015; 427 (24979680): 1191-120110.1016/j.jmb.2014.06.014Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The term “N-terminal” is omitted from use here to avoid its frequent usage, except when it is defined. A signal peptide with hydrophobic characteristics is recognized by a signal recognition particle (SRP), and this SRP-mediated protein targeting the ER is referred to as the SRP-dependent pathway (5Zimmermann R. Eyrisch S. Ahmad M. Helms V. Protein translocation across the ER membrane.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2011; 1808 (20599535): 912-92410.1016/j.bbamem.2010.06.015Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). In contrast, a signal peptide that has weak hydrophobic characteristics is not recognized efficiently by the SRP, and proteins with these signal peptides are targeted to the ER through the SRP-independent pathway (6Ng D.T.W. Brown J.D. Walter P. Signal sequences specify the targeting route to the endoplasmic reticulum membrane.J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134 (8707814): 269-27810.1083/jcb.134.2.269Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar, 7Johnson N. Powis K. High S. Post-translational translocation into the endoplasmic reticulum.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2013; 1833: 2403-240910.1016/j.bbamcr.2012.12.008Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The SRP-dependent pathway is a cotranslational system mediated by SRP and SRP receptor (SR) (5Zimmermann R. Eyrisch S. Ahmad M. Helms V. Protein translocation across the ER membrane.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2011; 1808 (20599535): 912-92410.1016/j.bbamem.2010.06.015Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). In the case of the SRP-dependent pathway, a highly hydrophobic signal peptide of newly synthesized proteins on ribosomes is recognized by SRP, which results in protein synthesis being inhibited. The interaction between SRP and SR on the ER membrane facilitates interactions between ribosomes and the translocon Sec61, and protein synthesis is then restarted as proteins are transported into the ER lumen. On the other hand, the SRP-independent pathway is a posttranslational system and is mediated by cytosolic heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) family proteins, an ER luminal chaperone called BiP, and the Sec62-Sec63 complex (5Zimmermann R. Eyrisch S. Ahmad M. Helms V. Protein translocation across the ER membrane.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2011; 1808 (20599535): 912-92410.1016/j.bbamem.2010.06.015Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Regardless of SRP dependence, proteins that are destined to be processed through the secretory pathway pass through the translocon Sec61 (8Deshaies R.J. Schekman R. A yeast mutant defective at an early stage in import of secretory protein precursors into the endoplasmic reticulum.J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105 (3305520): 633-64510.1083/jcb.105.2.633Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Schekman and coworkers reported that not only Sec61 but also many other proteins, including Sec62 and Sec63, are involved in the translocation of proteins into the ER (8Deshaies R.J. Schekman R. A yeast mutant defective at an early stage in import of secretory protein precursors into the endoplasmic reticulum.J.

The Sec61 complex and signal peptide-related components are conserved from bacteria to humans (12Dudek J. Pfeffer S. Lee P. Jung M. Cavalié A. Helms V. Förster F. Zimmermann R. Protein transport into the human endoplasmic reticulum.J. Mol. Biol. 2015; 427 (24968227): 1159-117510.1016/j.jmb.2014.06.011Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Moreover, recent structural analyses indicated that the Sec61 channel is opened by a signal peptide (13Voorhees R.M. Hegde R.S. Structure of the Sec61 channel opened by a signal sequence.Science. 2016; 351 (26721998): 88-9110.1126/science.aad4992Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Thus, a growing body of evidence suggests that signal peptides and Sec proteins are essential components for the translocation of soluble proteins into the ER. The N-terminal signal peptide-independent transport of carboxypeptidase Y (CPY) into the lumen of the ER was previously reported in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae (14Blachly-Dyson E. Stevens T.H. Yeast carboxypeptidase Y can be translocated and glycosylated without its amino-terminal signal sequence.J. Cell Biol. 1987; 104 (3032983): 1183-119110.1083/jcb.104.5.1183Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In that study, a deletion mutation causing the removal of the entire CPY signal peptide still resulted in the N-glycosylation of CPY at low efficiency, indicating that there is a signal peptide-independent translocation mechanism for this protein. Furthermore, an N-terminal signal peptide-truncated version of Mid1 (Mid1ΔN23), a subunit of a Ca2+ channel, was still N-glycosylated and functional as a component of the channel (15Iida K. Teng J. Cho T. Yoshikawa-Kimura S. Iida H. Posttranslational processing and membrane translocation of the yeast regulatory Mid1 subunit of the Cch1/VGCC/NALCN cation channel family.J. Biol. Chem. 2017; 292 (29042437): 20570-2058210.1074/jbc.M117.810283Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). This finding indicates that Mid1 is also translocated into the ER in an N-terminal signal peptide-independent manner and suggests that the N-terminal signal peptide-independent translocation of proteins occasionally occurs in budding yeast. To elucidate the N-terminal signal peptide-independent translocation mechanism, we investigated the factors required using signal peptide-truncated reporter proteins expressed in mutants in which ER function is affected. We found that the N-glycosylation of the signal peptide-removed proteins, CPY*ΔN28 and Pep4ΔN23, was markedly enhanced in the deletion mutant of the STE24 gene encoding a metalloendoprotease located in the ER membrane. In further analyses using mutants known to genetically interact with the STE24 gene and/or those involved in the unfolded protein response (UPR), we identified several ER proteins that affect the efficiency of the detection of signal peptide-independent translocation into the ER lumen. We also found that a portion of transcription factor Rme1 protein carrying no signal peptide per se was translocated into the ER to undergo N-glycosylation in the ste24Δ mutant, which is suggestive of the existence of intrinsic mechanisms controlling the translocation of signal peptideless proteins into the ER. Here, we discuss the importance of a checking system that avoids accidental protein translocation into the ER. Mid1, a protein that is localized in the ER and plasma membranes and has no transmembrane region, was recently reported to be N-glycosylated and become functional even though its N-terminal signal peptide was removed (15Iida K. Teng J. Cho T. Yoshikawa-Kimura S. Iida H. Posttranslational processing and membrane translocation of the yeast regulatory Mid1 subunit of the Cch1/VGCC/NALCN cation channel family.J. Biol.

To identify the components of the N-terminal signal peptide-independent protein translocation pathway, we focused on eight nonessential ER membrane proteins (Hrd1, Hrd3, Ssm4, Der1, Ste24, Emp65, Slp1, and Frt1) involved in several events, including protein recognition and degradation, on the ER membrane (16Ast T.

We constructed gene deletion mutants lacking each of the eight genes with the genetic background of strain H207 (15Iida K. Teng J. Cho T. Yoshikawa-Kimura S. Iida H. Posttranslational processing and membrane translocation of the yeast regulatory Mid1 subunit of the Cch1/VGCC/NALCN cation channel family.J. Biol.

The results obtained indicated that the amount of nonglycosylated Mid1ΔN23 was markedly reduced in the ste24Δ mutant (Fig. 1A), implying that signal peptide-independent translocation is enhanced in ste24Δ cells. In the course of the present study, we noted that although the ratio of N-glycosylated versus nonglycosylated Mid1ΔN23 differed depending on yeast strains with different genetic backgrounds, the effects of the ste24Δ mutation were clearly observed in both strain backgrounds that were tested (Fig. S1). To examine whether Mid1ΔN23 is functional in ste24Δ cells, its functionality was assessed using a Ca2+ accumulation assay. As shown in Fig. 1B, when Mid1ΔN23 was expressed in mid1Δ cells, Ca2+ accumulation was recovered to approximately half that of WT Mid1, but not fully. On the other hand, Ca2+ accumulation was fully recovered in mid1Δ ste24Δ cells, suggesting that Mid1ΔN23 more efficiently localizes to the plasma membrane and becomes functional in mid1Δ ste24Δ cells. To examine whether an N-terminal region outside the signal peptide is required for signal peptide-independent translocation, two additional N-terminal truncation mutants of Mid1, i.e. Mid1ΔN112 and Mid1ΔN171, were examined for N-glycosylation in WT and ste24Δ cells. Figure 1C shows that the two truncation mutants were also more efficiently N-glycosylated in ste24Δ cells, indicating that at least the N-terminal region spanning from 1 to 171 amino acid residues was not required for the N-terminal signal peptide-independent translocation of Mid1 in the ste24Δ background. The above result showing that the Mid1 protein deprived of the N-terminal signal peptide may be more efficiently translocated into the ER in ste24Δ cells prompted us to examine whether other signal peptide-deprived proteins are translocated in the same manner. We initially selected a variant of CPY, CPY* (23Finger A. Knop M. Wolf D.H. Analysis of two mutated vacuolar proteins reveals a degradation pathway in the endoplasmic reticulum or a related compartment of yeast.Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 218 (8269947): 565-57410.1111/j.1432-1033.1993.tb18410.xCrossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). The rationale behind using CPY* is that this protein, unlike the WT CPY that undergoes multiple proteolytic processes, hardly reached the vacuole; therefore, the N-glycosylated form can be easily distinguished, without proteolytic processing, from the nonglycosylated form by SDS-PAGE. When CPY* containing no signal peptide (CPY*ΔN28) was tested, only 38% of the molecules were N-glycosylated in WT cells (Fig. 1D), suggesting that the CPY*ΔN28 mutant was still translocated into the ER to some extent, as was the case with CPY (14Blachly-Dyson E. Stevens T.H. Yeast carboxypeptidase Y can be translocated and glycosylated without its amino-terminal signal sequence.J. Cell Biol. 1987; 104 (3032983): 1183-119110.1083/jcb.104.5.1183Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In contrast, a markedly larger fraction (96%) of N-glycosylated CPY*ΔN28 was detected in ste24Δ cells (Fig. 1D), suggesting that signal peptide-independent translocation looks generally enhanced in ste24Δ cells. To estimate which N-terminal region is necessary for the signal peptide-independent translocation of CPY*, we deleted the N-terminal region up to 40 and 80 amino acid residues to produce CPY*ΔN40 and CPY*ΔN80, respectively, and examined their N-glycosylation in WT and ste24Δ cells. As shown in Fig. 1E, CPY*ΔN40 was undetectable and CPY*ΔN80 was detectable but inefficiently N-glycosylated in WT cells, whereas both proteins were efficiently N-glycosylated in ste24Δ cells. This result suggests that the N-terminal region (up to 80 amino acid residues) of CPY* is unnecessary for signal peptide-independent translocation. In addition to CPY*ΔN28, CPYΔN20 (non-ER-associated degradation [ERAD] substrate), which was expressed in the prc1Δ mutant deficient in vacuolar CPY, was also examined by Western blotting. Strikingly, the intensity of a band corresponding to the vacuolar form of CPY was reduced in prc1Δ cells but significantly recovered in prc1Δ ste24Δ cells (Fig. 1F). This result suggests that once signal peptide-less CPY are translocated into the ER, they can efficiently reach the vacuole. We also tested the signal peptide-deprived Pep4 (Pep4ΔN23), another well-studied vacuolar protease (24Ammerer G. Hunter C.P. Rothman J.H. Saari G.C. Valls L.A. Stevens T.H. PEP4 gene of Saccharomyces cerevisiae encodes proteinase A, a vacuolar enzyme required for processing of vacuolar precursors.Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6 (3023936): 2490-249910.1128/mcb.6.7.2490Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). The results obtained showed that 23% of Pep4ΔN23 molecules were N-glycosylated in WT cells, whereas they were almost completely N-glycosylated in ste24Δ cells (Fig. 1G), further supporting the hypothesis that signal peptide-independent translocation into the ER is generally enhanced in ste24Δ cells. To test the specificity of signal peptide-independent translocation, we examined Suc2ΔN20, an N-terminal signal peptide-deprived derivative of Suc2 (extracellular invertase) and Png1 (cytosolic protein) containing no intrinsic signal peptide (25Williams R.S. Trumbly R.J. MacColl R. Trimble R.B. Maley F. Comparative properties of amplified external and internal invertase from the yeast SUC2 gene.J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260 (3902817): 13334-13341Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Suzuki T. Park H. Hollingsworth N.M. Sternglanz R. Lennarz W.J. PNG1, a yeast gene encoding a highly conserved peptide:N-glycanase.J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149 (10831608): 1039-105210.1083/jcb.149.5.1039Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Both proteins have potential N-glycosylation sites. Figure 1H and I shows that N-glycosylation was not observed in either protein in WT or ste24Δ cells. This result suggests that whereas the detection of signal peptide-independent translocation of proteins into the ER is enhanced in ste24Δ cells, strict specificity exists for substrates to be translocated into the ER in ste24Δ cells. The metalloendoprotease activity of Ste24 is required for the maturation of a-factor and the processing of clogged proteins in the translocon (16Ast T. Michaelis S. Schuldiner M. Article the protease Ste24 clears clogged translocons.Cell. 2016; 164 (26771486): 103-11410.1016/j.cell.2015.11.053Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 27Michaelis S. Barrowman J. Biogenesis of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae Pheromone a-Factor, from Yeast Mating to Human Disease.Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2012; 76 (22933563): 626-65110.1128/MMBR.00010-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined whether the protease activity of Ste24 is required to suppress the translocation of signal peptide-deprived proteins into the ER by using the Ste24 mutant without protease activity, Ste24(H297A). As shown in Fig. 1J, nonglycosylated CPY*ΔN28 was increased in cells expressing myc-tagged WT Ste24 but not in those expressing myc-tagged, protease-deficient Ste24(H297A), suggesting that the protease activity of Ste24 is required to suppress the signal peptide-independent protein translocation into the ER. Because Ste24 was found to be involved in the suppression of the signal peptide-independent translocation of various substrates, we investigated the translocation mechanism contributing to this pathway. To confirm whether Sec61, a well-conserved protein translocation channel on the ER membrane, is required for this process, the N-glycosylation status of CPY*ΔN28 and Mid1ΔN23 was examined in the cold-sensitive sec61 mutant sec61-41. All experiments were performed at a permissive temperature of 30 °C. Figure 2A and C shows that the N-glycosylation of CPY*ΔN28 and Mid1ΔN23 was suppressed in sec61-41 cells, suggesting that these two proteins are translocated into the ER through the Sec61 translocon. To confirm that the glycosylation deficiency for these proteins was not because of a general N-glycosylation defect, the N-glycosylation status of signal peptide-bearing CPY* and WT Mid1 were examined in the same sec61-41 mutant at the permissive temperature. Figure 2B and D shows that CPY* and Mid1 were both efficiently N-glycosylated in ste24Δ sec61-41 cells, implying that N-glycosylation activity was normal in cells used in the present study. Therefore, we concluded that the marked decreases observed in glycosylated CPY*ΔN28 and Mid1ΔN23 proteins in sec61-41 cells were not because of a general N-glycosylation defect. Comparisons between Fig. 2A and B and between Fig. 2C and D indicated that the N-glycosylation efficiencies of CPY*ΔN28 and Mid1ΔN23 were markedly lower than those of CPY* and Mid1 in sec61-41 cells, even at the permissive temperature, which is suggestive of the importance of the N-terminal signal peptide in the sec61-41 mutant. In addition to Sec61, the Sec62-Sec63 complex (composed of Sec62, Sec63, Sec66, and Sec72) is essential for posttranslational protein translocation into the ER (6Ng D.T.W. Brown J.D. Walter P. Signal sequences specify the targeting route to the endoplasmic reticulum membrane.J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134 (8707814): 269-27810.1083/jcb.134.2.269Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined the role of the Sec66 and Sec72 subunits (nonessential components of the Sec62-Sec63 complex) in this pathway. To examine whether Sec66 and Sec72 are required for this pathway, the N-glycosylation statuses of CPY*ΔN28 and Mid1ΔN23 were examined in the sec66Δ and sec72Δ backgrounds. As shown in Fig. 2E and G, the relative amounts of N-glycosylated CPYΔN28 and Mid1ΔN23 were markedly lower in ste24Δ sec66Δ and ste24Δ sec72Δ cells than in ste24Δ cells. This result suggests that the Sec66 and Sec72 subunits are essential for the translocation of signal peptide-deprived substrates. An analysis of signal peptide-bearing CPY* and Mid1 in these mutants showed normal N-glycosylation, suggesting that the decreases observed in glycosylated CPY*ΔN28 and Mid1ΔN23 proteins were not because of general underglycosylation (Fig. 2F and H). These results indicate that the Sec66 and Sec72 subunits are required for signal peptide-independent protein translocation into the ER and that the pathway occurs in a posttranslational event. The GET (guided entry of tail-anchor) pathway is a protein transport mechanism for tail-anchored proteins (28Schuldiner M. Metz J. Schmid V. Denic V. Rakwalska M. Schmitt H.D. Schwappach B. Weissman J.S. The GET complex mediates insertion of tail-anchored proteins into the ER membrane.Cell. 2008; 134 (18724936): 634-64510.1016/j.cell.2008.06.025Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). C-terminally anchored proteins, such as the Sbh1, Sbh2, and SNARE proteins, are targeted to the ER membrane by the GET pathway. In addition to the GET pathway, a novel backup protein targeting system to the ER that may compensate for a defect in the GET pathway was recently reported (29Aviram N. Ast T. Costa E.A. Arakel E.C. Chuartzman S.G. Jan C.H. Haßdenteufel S. Dudek J. Jung M. Schorr S. Zimmermann R. Schwappach B. Weissman J.S. Schuldiner M. The SND proteins constitute an alternative targeting route to the endoplasmic reticulum.Nature. 2016; 540 (27905431): 134-13810.1038/nature20169Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). In that study, Snd (SRP-independent targeting) proteins were identified through genome-wide screening; Snd1 is a cytosolic protein that interacts with ribosomal proteins, whereas Snd2 (Env10) and Snd3 (Pho88) are localized in the ER membrane (30Fleischer T.C. Weaver C.M. Mcafee K.J. Jennings J.L. Link A.J. Systematic identification and functional screens of uncharacterized proteins associated with eukaryotic ribosomal complexes.Genes Dev. 2006; 20 (16702403): 1294-130710.1101/gad.1422006Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Thus, Snd components are localized in the cytosol and ER. To elucidate the relationship between the signal peptide-independent and GET/SND pathways, Western blot analyses of CPY*ΔN28 were performed using get and snd mutant cells. The results obtained indicated that the N-glycosylation of CPY*ΔN28 was slightly suppressed in the get1Δ get2Δ mutant only but not in the other mutants shown in Fig. 2I, suggesting that the signal peptide-independent protein translocation pathway is partially dependent on the GET pathway and independent of the SND pathway. To obtain deeper insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying N-terminal signal peptide-independent protein translocation into the ER, we focused on genes that genetically interact with STE24, as reported in TheCellMap database (profile similarities, 21 genes; negative interactions, 283 genes) (RRID:SCR_018728) (31Usaj M.

In consideration of the upregulation of the UPR (unfolded protein response) in ste24Δ cells (32Jonikas M.C. Collins S.R. Denic V. Oh E. Quan E.M. Schmid V. Weibezahn J. Schwappach B. Walter P.

All of these genes, except for UBC6, were shown to elicit the UPR when they were deleted (32Jonikas M.C. Collins S.R. Denic V. Oh E. Quan E.M. Schmid V. Weibezahn J. Schwappach B. Walter P.

Finger A. Schweiger M. Wolf D.H.

We examined the N-glycosylation status of CPY*ΔN28 in the mutants lacking each one of these genes and found that N-glycosylated CPY*ΔN28 levels were markedly higher in spc2Δ cells (93%) than in WT cells (45%) (Fig. 3A). The N-glycosylation of Pep4ΔN23 was also significantly increased in spc2Δ cells (Fig. 3B). These results indicate that not only Ste24 but also Spc2 are somehow required for the efficient suppression of signal peptide-independent protein translocation into the ER. In addition to spc2Δ cells, the levels of N-glycosylated CPY*ΔN28 were increased in scj1Δ, ubc6Δ, ubc7Δ, and cue1Δ cells (Fig. 3A). These mutant cells exhibit a defect in ERAD, and CPY* is an ERAD substrate (33Hiller M.M. Finger A. Schweiger M. Wolf D.H.

https://openalex.org/W3033034114,"Introduction Resource constraints in Low and Middle-Income Countries (LMICs) limit tuberculosis (TB) contact investigation despite evidence its benefits could outweigh costs, with increased efficiency when compared with intensified case finding (ICF). However, there is limited data on yield and cost per TB case identified. We compared yield and cost per TB case identified for ICF and Tuberculosis-Contact Investigation (TB-CI) in Uganda. Methods A retrospective cohort study based on data from 12 Ugandan hospitals was done between April and September 2017. Two methods of TB case finding (i.e. ICF and TB-CI) were compared. Regarding ICF, patients either self-reported their signs and symptoms or were prompted by health care workers, while TB-CI was done by home-visiting and screening contacts of TB patients. Patients who were presumed to have tuberculosis were requested to produce a sample for examination. TB yield was defined as a ratio of diagnoses to tests, and this was computed per method of diagnosis. The cost per TB case identified (medical, personnel, transportation and training) for each diagnosis method were computed using the activity-based approach, from the health care perspective. Cost data were analyzed using Windows Excel. Results 454 index TB cases and 2,707 of their household contacts were investigated. Thirty-one per cent of contacts (840/2707) were found to be presumptive TB cases. A total of 7,685 tests were done, 6,967 for ICF and 718 for TB-CI. The yields were 18.62% (1297/6967) and 5.29% (38/718) for ICF and TB-CI, respectively. It cost US$ 120.60 to diagnose a case of TB using ICF compared to US$ 877.57 for TB-CI. Conclusion The yield of TB-CI was found to be four-times lower and seven-times costlier compared to ICF. These findings suggest that ICF can improve TB case detection at a low cost, particularly in high TB prevalent settings."

However, scant studies examined the trends and changes of corporate social responsibility (CSR) practices through CSR reporting on the economic, environmental and social dimensions in the aviation industry. To fill the gap, the current study examines the economic, environmental and social themes of Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards on CSR communication of the global airlines. Quantitative content analysis is adopted for analyzing and comparing the CSR themes in 105 CSR reports of 21 airlines in major leagues from 2013 to 2017. Our findings indicated a salient growing trend in CSR reporting in the economic dimension while GRI 201-Economic Performance was the most significantly reported sub-topic. Our study has also compared the CSR reporting practices between the APEC based airlines and EU based airlines. The results indicated that focus of CSR reporting was different in the two regions. This study provided a comprehensive understanding of how global airlines communicate their CSR practices and respond to stakeholders’ expectations via CSR reporting. This study informs both academics and practitioners about the changing trends of CSR development and reporting in the airline industry worldwide."

This study was designed to investigate the role of autophagy in the osteogenic differentiation in ligamentum fibroblasts. Rat ligamentum fibroblasts were isolated from the posterior longitudinal ligament and cultured in osteogenic induction medium. Ultrastructural analysis, immunofluorescence assay, western blot, flow cytometry, and lysosomal activity assessment were performed to determine the presence and activity of autophagy in the cells. The mineralization deposit and osteogenic gene expressions were evaluated to classify the association between autophagy activity and the bone formation ability of the spinal ligament cells. The influence of leptin and endothelin-1 on the autophagy activity was also evaluated. Our study demonstrated that autophagy was present and increased in the ligament cells under osteogenic induction. Inhibition of autophagy with either pharmacologic inhibitors (Bafilomycin A and 3-methyladenine) or Belcin1 (BECN1) knocking down weakened the mineralization capacity, decreased the gene expressions of COL1A1, osteocalcin (Ocn), and runt-related transcription factor 2 (Runx2) in the ligamentum fibroblasts and increased cell apoptosis. The Adenosine 5'-monophosphate (AMP)-activated protein kinase (AMPK)-BECN1 autophagic pathway was activated in the osteogenic differentiating ligamentum fibroblasts. Leptin significantly increased the autophagy activity in the ligament cells under osteogenic induction. These discoveries might improve our understanding for the mechanism of ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL) and provide new approaches on the prevention and treatment of this not uncommon disease."

This study is aimed to evaluate the damage caused by a deficiency of macronutrients in physiological variables that cause decreased growth and the appearance of visual symptoms in snap bean. Thus, we design a hydroponic system of snap bean cultivation in order to test the effect of macronutrient deficiencies in a controlled environment. The treatments consisted in evaluate the effects of lack of one macronutrient in time. To perform this, we used Hoagland and Arnon solution in its complete formulation (control) or without N, P; K; Mg, Ca or S in each treatment. Physiological, nutritional, and growth analyses were performed when visual deficiency symptoms of each omitted nutrient appeared. Thus, the omissions of N and P in the nutrient solution led to lower accumulations of all macronutrients in the shoot. And the K, Ca, Mg, and S omissions decreased the amounts of K, Ca, Mg, P, and S in the shoot of the snap bean plants when compared with the plants grown in the complete nutrient solution. With the lowest accumulation of macronutrients, the content of photosynthetic pigments and the photosynthetic rate were reduced, with harmful effects on plant growth. Thus, from the losses in dry matter production of the shoot, the order of limiting of macronutrients in bean plants was N < P < Ca < S < Mg < K, with a decrease of up to 86.2%, 80.1%, 51.2%, 46.5%, 25.6%, and 19.3%, respectively. The nitrogen deficiency is more evident, proven by symptoms such as chlorosis in the lower and upper third leaves and necrosis of the lower third leaves."

We aimed to identify the best measure of cough severity and characterize changes during initial tuberculosis therapy. We conducted a prospective cohort of recently diagnosed ambulatory adult patients with pulmonary tuberculosis in two tertiary hospitals in Lima, Peru. Pre-treatment and five times during the first two months of treatment, a vibrometer was used to capture 4-hour recordings of involuntary cough. A total of 358 recordings from 69 participants were analyzed using a computer algorithm. Total time spent coughing (seconds per hour) was a better predictor of microbiologic indicators of disease severity and treatment response than the frequency of cough episodes or cough power. Patients with prior tuberculosis tended to cough more than patients without prior tuberculosis, and patients with tuberculosis and diabetes coughed more than patients without diabetes co-morbidity. Cough characteristics were similar regardless of HIV co-infection and for drug-susceptible versus drug-resistant tuberculosis. Tuberculosis treatment response may be meaningfully assessed by objectively monitoring the time spent coughing. This measure demonstrated that cough was increased in patients with TB recurrence or co-morbid diabetes, but not because of drug resistance or HIV co-infection."

RecA binds to ssDNA, forming filaments that stimulate proteolytic cleavage of the LexA transcriptional repressor, allowing expression of > 40 gene products involved in DNA repair and cell cycle regulation. Here, using a DNA replication system reconstituted in vitro in tandem with a LexA cleavage assay, we studied LexA cleavage during DNA replication of both undamaged and base-damaged templates. Only a ssDNA–RecA filament supported LexA cleavage. Surprisingly, replication of an undamaged template supported levels of LexA cleavage like that induced by a template carrying two site-specific cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers. We found that two processes generate ssDNA that could support LexA cleavage. 1) During unperturbed replication, single-stranded regions formed because of stochastic uncoupling of the leading-strand DNA polymerase from the replication fork DNA helicase, and 2) on the damaged template, nascent leading-strand gaps were generated by replisome lesion skipping. The two pathways differed in that RecF stimulated LexA cleavage during replication of the damaged template, but not normal replication.

The integrity of genomic DNA of all organisms is threatened both by environmental and endogenous damaging agents. Bacteria, including Escherichia coli, evolved an inducible system capable of dealing with DNA damage in a coordinated manner known as the SOS response (most recently reviewed in (1Maslowska K.H.

E. coli replication initiates at a single origin and proceeds bidirectionally (see review by McHenry (7McHenry C.S. DNA replicases from a bacterial perspective.Annu. Rev.

The DnaB helicase unwinds the parental DNA duplex in the 5′ → 3′ direction, traveling on the lagging-strand template. The single-stranded (ss) DNA is immediately sequestered by SSB (ssDNA-binding protein). The primase, DnaG, synthesizes short RNA primers for the initiation of Okazaki fragments on the nascent lagging strand. The DnaX complex, a component of the DNA Polymerase III Holoenzyme (Pol III HE) loads the processivity clamp, β, and the polymerase III core onto the primers. Multiple contacts between replisome components assure optimal DNA synthesis rate and processivity. Recent studies show that the replication process is dynamic. The leading- and lagging-strand polymerases do not act in a coordinated fashion, but instead pause stochastically and display a wide distribution of polymerization rates (8Graham J.E. Marians K.J.

The decrease in unwinding speed ensures that the transient gaps forming on the DNA template are promptly filled in by the Pol III HE. However, in vivo, replication forks often stall because of encounters with template damage, transcribing RNA polymerases, proteins covalently bound to DNA, or increased template supercoiling. Multiple mechanisms ensure lesion bypass and reactivation of stalled forks (10Marians K.J. Lesion Bypass and the Reactivation of Stalled Replication Forks.Annu. Rev.

Differences in the time of expression of SOS genes depend on the LexA binding equilibria to the operators and appear only at high levels of DNA damage, becoming more exacerbated with increasing doses of clastogens (6Culyba M.J.

Following DNA damage repair and disappearance of the SOS-inducing signal, intact LexA accumulates and the system resets. We used a reconstituted DNA replication system in tandem with a LexA cleavage assay to show that the SOS-inducing signal, ssDNA, is generated by two related processes: 1) The slow unwinding of the template without concurrent DNA synthesis, resulting from the stochastic pausing of the leading-strand polymerase even in the absence of template DNA damage, and 2) the generation of ss gaps on templates carrying base damage that occurs because of replisome skipping over the DNA lesion. The former process is not stimulated by RecF, whereas the latter process is. ssDNA is the signal for the initiation of SOS response (2Sassanfar M. Roberts J.W. Nature of the SOS-inducing signal in Escherichia coli. The involvement of DNA replication.J. Mol.

Because we wanted to assess LexA cleavage during DNA replication when both ds and ss DNA would be present in the reaction, we sought to clarify the DNA effector requirements for LexA cleavage. We therefore compared the activity of ssDNA- and dsDNA-RecA filaments in supporting LexA cleavage using a 122 nt-long oligonucleotide (oligo), CG306, in both ss and ds form. In case any unannealed ssDNA remained after annealing the oligos, the dsDNA was treated with E. coli exonuclease VII (Exo VII) (53Chase J.W. Richardson C.C. Exonuclease VII of Escherichia coli. Mechanism of action.J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249 (4602030): 4553-4561Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To measure LexA cleavage, we used a modified LexA protein, ΔN-His-PKA-LexA, where the first 64 amino acids have been substituted with a 6xHis tag followed by a protein kinase A (PKA) tag (19Giese K.C. Michalowski C.B. Little J.W. RecA-dependent cleavage of LexA dimers.J. Mol. Biol. 2008; 377 (18234215): 148-16110.1016/j.jmb.2007.12.025Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar).

However, the performance of satellite imagery in assessing woody plant species diversity in dry seasons has been understudied. This study aimed to assess the performance of multiple Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrices (GLCM) derived from individual bands of WorldView-2 satellite imagery to quantify woody plant species diversity in a savanna environment during the dry season. Woody plant species were counted in 220 plots (20 m radius) and subsequently converted to a continuous scale of the Shannon species diversity index. The index regressed against the GLCMs using the all-possible-subsets regression approach that builds competing models to choose from. Entropy GLCM yielded the best overall accuracy (adjusted R2: 0.41−0.46; Root Mean Square Error (RMSE): 0.60−0.58) in estimating species diversity. The effect of the number of predicting bands on species diversity estimation was also explored. Accuracy generally increased when three–five bands were used in models but stabilised or gradually decreased as more than five bands were used. Despite the peak accuracies achieved with three–five bands, performances still fared well for models that used fewer bands, showing the relevance of few bands for species diversity estimation. We also assessed the effect of GLCM window size (3×3, 5×5 and 7×7) on species diversity estimation and generally found inconsistent conclusions. These findings demonstrate the capability of GLCMs combined with high spatial resolution imagery in estimating woody plants species diversity in a savanna environment during the dry period. It is important to test the performance of species diversity estimation of similar environmental set-ups using widely available moderate-resolution imagery."
https://openalex.org/W3033142738,"Preterm birth (PTB) is the leading cause of neonatal morbidity and mortality and spontaneous PTB is a major contributor. The preceding inflammation/infection contributes not only to spontaneous PTB but is associated with neonatal morbidities including impaired brain development. Therefore, control of exaggerated immune response during pregnancy is an attractive strategy. A potential candidate is synthetic PreImplantation Factor (sPIF) as sPIF prevents inflammatory induced fetal loss and has neuroprotective properties. Here, we tested maternal sPIF prophylaxis in pregnant mice subjected to a lipopolysaccharides (LPS) insult, which results in PTB. Additionally, we evaluated sPIF effects in placental and microglial cell lines. Maternal sPIF application reduced the LPS induced PTB rate significantly. Consequently, sPIF reduced microglial activation (Iba-1 positive cells) and preserved neuronal migration (Cux-2 positive cells) in fetal brains. In fetal brain lysates sPIF decreased IL-6 and INFγ concentrations. In-vitro, sPIF reduced Iba1 and TNFα expression in microglial cells and reduced the expression of pro-apoptotic (Bad and Bax) and inflammatory (IL-6 and NLRP4) genes in placental cell lines. Together, maternal sPIF prophylaxis prevents PTB in part by controlling exaggerated immune response. Given the sPIF`FDA Fast Track approval in non-pregnant subjects, we envision sPIF therapy in pregnancy."
https://openalex.org/W3033454488,"Background Sexual identity is a significant risk factor for triggering symptoms of depression, as well as for suicide attempts in lesbian, gay and bisexual (LGB) population compared to the heterosexual population. To the best of our knowledge, data on the mental health of LGB persons in Serbia are lacking, and this is the first study to address this problem. The aim of the study was to examine the association between selected determinants and depression, and selected determinants and suicide attempts in LGB and heterosexual populations in the Republic of Serbia, as well as, their differences. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional study in 2015 of 264 heterosexual and LGB respondents using the ""snowball sampling"" method. We used linear regression analyses to investigate the relationship between socio-demographic variables and different sexual identity categories with PHQ-9 scores. We assessed associations between suicide attempts, and socio-demographic characteristics, sexual identity, depression, and suicidal thoughts using logistic regression. Results Depression symptoms were higher in female relative to male participants, in participants who were single, divorced or widowed in comparison to currently married, among people with a middle level of education compared to highly educated, and in respondents identified as bisexual or homosexual in comparison to heterosexual. Homosexual and bisexual participants reported suicidal attempts 27 [Odds Ratio (OR) = 27.31] and six times (OR = 6.40) more often than did heterosexual respondents, respectively. Suicide attempts were less frequently reported by single, divorced or widowed participants in comparison to married (OR = 0.25) and those with middle education (OR = 0.38) compared to highly educated. Conclusions The present study showed that LGB persons in Serbia have significantly more symptoms of depression and suicide attempts compared to heterosexuals. Public health interventions should focus on the early detection of depression and on overcoming prejudicial and discriminatory attitudes. Also, intervention should emphasize that homosexuality and bisexuality are normal, equal and morally acceptable expressions of human sexuality."
https://openalex.org/W3033563815,"Participatory modelling is an emerging approach in the decision-making process through which stakeholders contribute to the representation of the perceived causal linkages of a complex system. The use of fuzzy cognitive maps (FCMs) for participatory modelling helps policy-makers develop dynamic quantitative models for strategising development interventions. The aggregation of knowledge from multiple stakeholders provides consolidated and more reliable results. Average aggregation is the most common aggregation method used in FCMs-based modelling for weighted interconnections between concepts. This paper proposes a new aggregation method using learning OWA (ordered weighted averaging) operators for aggregating FCM weights assigned by various stakeholders. Besides, we report a comparative analysis of ‘OWA learning aggregation’ with the conventional average aggregation method, while evaluating the theory of change for the world’s most extensive poverty alleviation programme in India. The results of the FCMWizard web-based tool show that the proposed method provides an opportunity to policy-makers for evaluating outcomes of proposed policies while addressing social resilience and economic mobility."

The AIL family has not yet been comprehensively studied in rapeseed (Brassica napus), an allotetraploid and model organism for the study of polyploid evolution. In the present study, 99 AIL family genes were identified and characterized from B. rapa, B. oleracea, B. napus, B. juncea, and B. nigra using a comprehensive genome-wide study, including analyses of phylogeny, gene structure, chromosomal localization, and expression pattern. Using a phylogenetic analysis, the AIL genes were divided into eight groups, which were closely related to the eight AtAIL genes, and which shared highly conserved structural features within the same subfamily. The non-synonymous/synonymous substitution ratios of the paralogs and orthologs were less than 1, suggesting that the AIL genes mainly experienced purifying selection during evolution. In addition, the RNA sequencing data and qRT-PCR analysis revealed that the B. napus AIL genes exhibited organ- and developmental stage-specific expression patterns. Certain genes were highly expressed in the developing seeds (BnaAIL1, BnaAIL2, BnaAIL5, and BnaAIL6), the roots (BnaANT, BnaAIL5, and BnaAIL6), and the stem (BnaAIL7B). Our results provide valuable information for further functional analysis of the AIL family in B. napus and related Brassica species."
https://openalex.org/W3033023761,"Eating alone while living with family members is a risk factor for mental health decline in old age. However, little is known as to why older adults choose to eat alone, even with family present. This study therefore aimed to explore reasons for older adults eating alone despite living with family members, using a qualitative approach. Fifteen people aged 65 years and older (11 men and 4 women) who were eating alone while living with family members were included in the study. These individuals were selected from the participants of the Kashiwa cohort study conducted in 2016. Individual interviews were conducted using an open-ended format. All interviews were recorded and transcribed. The data were further thematically analyzed using a qualitative software package, NVivo 11. We extracted six themes as reasons for eating alone and hypothesized interactions among these themes. The extracted themes were: “age-related changes,” “solo-friendly environment,” “family structure changes,” “time lag for eating,” “bad relationships with family members” and “routinization.” To assess interactions, the themes were categorized as “background factors,” “triggers,” and “stabilizers.” The aforementioned themes could lead to the development and sustained behavior of eating alone among older adults living with family members. As most themes describe conditions that are likely to remain static, it may not be realistic to encourage such individuals to begin eating with family members. The promotion of meals with neighbors or friends could be effective in alleviating the negative consequences of eating alone."

Late-season surveys were conducted in cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) fields in Texas in 2016 and 2017 to identify common weed species present as escapes and estimate seed rain potential of Palmer amaranth (Amaranthus palmeri S. Watson) and waterhemp [A. tuberculatus (Moq.) J.D. Sauer], two troublesome species with high fecundity. A total of 400 cotton fields across four major cotton-producing regions in Texas [High Plains (HP), Gulf Coast (GC), Central Texas, and Blacklands] were surveyed. Amaranthus palmeri, Texas millet [Urochloa texana (Buckley) R. Webster], A. tuberculatus, ragweed parthenium (Parthenium hysterophorus L.), and barnyardgrass [Echinochloa crus-galli (L.) P. Beauv.] were reported as the top five weed escapes in cotton fields. Amaranthus palmeri was the most prevalent weed in the HP and Lower GC regions, whereas A. tuberculatus escapes were predominantly observed in the Upper GC and Blacklands regions. On average, 9.4% of an individual field was infested with A. palmeri escapes in the Lower GC region; however, 5.1 to 8.1% of a field was infested in the HP region. Average A. palmeri density ranged from 405 (Central Texas) to 3,543 plants ha–1 (Lower GC). The greatest seed rain potential by A. palmeri escapes was observed in the upper HP region (13.9 million seeds ha–1), whereas the seed rain potential of A. tuberculatus escapes was the greatest in the Blacklands (12.9 million seeds ha–1) and the upper GC regions (9.8 million seeds ha–1). Seed rain from late-season A. palmeri and A. tuberculatus escapes is significant in Texas cotton, and effective management of these escapes is imperative for minimizing seedbank inputs and impacting weed species persistence."
https://openalex.org/W3033656996,"Low individual socioeconomic status (SES) is known to be associated with a higher risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), but the extent to which the local context in which people live may influence T2DM rates remains unclear. This study examines whether living in a low property value neighbourhood is associated with higher rates of T2DM independently of individual SES.Using cross-sectional data from the Maastricht Study (2010-2013) and geographical data from Statistics Netherlands, multilevel logistic regression was used to assess the association between neighbourhood property value and T2DM. Individual SES was based on education, occupation and income. Of the 2,056 participants (aged 40-75 years), 494 (24%) were diagnosed with T2DM.Individual SES was strongly associated with T2DM, but a significant proportion of the variance in T2DM was found at the neighbourhood level (VPC = 9.2%; 95% CI = 5.0%-16%). Participants living in the poorest neighbourhoods had a 2.38 times higher odds ratio of T2DM compared to those living in the richest areas (95% CI = 1.58-3.58), independently of individual SES.Neighbourhood property value showed a significant association with T2DM, suggesting the usefulness of area-based programmes aimed at improving neighbourhood characteristics in order to tackle inequalities in T2DM."
https://openalex.org/W3033945839,"Excess presence of the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) as well as of the focal adhesion protein complexes are associated with increased proliferation, migratory, and invasive behavior of cancer cells. A cross-regulation between HER2 and integrin signaling pathways has been found, but the exact mechanism remains elusive. Here, we investigated whether HER2 colocalizes with focal adhesion complexes on breast cancer cells overexpressing HER2. For this purpose, vinculin or talin green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion proteins, both key constituents of focal adhesions, were expressed in breast cancer cells. HER2 was either extracellularly or intracellularly labeled with fluorescent quantum dots nanoparticles (QDs). The cell-substrate interface was analyzed at the location of the focal adhesions by means of total internal reflection fluorescent microscopy or correlative fluorescence- and scanning transmission electron microscopy. Expression of HER2 at the cell-substrate interface was only observed upon intracellular labeling, and was heterogeneous with both HER2-enriched and -low regions. In contrast to an expected enrichment of HER2 at focal adhesions, an anti-correlated expression pattern was observed for talin and HER2. Our findings suggest a spatial anti-correlation between HER2 and focal adhesion complexes for adherent cells."
https://openalex.org/W3032985162,"CRISPR-Cas is an adaptive immune system that protects prokaryotes against foreign nucleic acids. Prokaryotes gain immunity by acquiring short pieces of the invading nucleic acid termed prespacers and inserting them into their CRISPR array. In type II-A systems, Cas1 and Cas2 proteins insert prespacers always at the leader-repeat junction of the CRISPR array. Among type II-A CRISPR systems, three distinct groups (G1, G2, and G3) exist according to the extent of DNA sequence conservation at the 3' end of the leader. However, the mechanisms by which these conserved motifs interact with their cognate Cas1 and Cas2 proteins remain unclear. Here, we performed in vitro integration assays, finding that for G1 and G2, the insertion site is recognized through defined mechanisms, at least in members examined to date, whereas G3 exhibits no sequence-specific insertion. G1 first recognized a 12-bp sequence at the leader-repeat junction and performed leader-side insertion before proceeding to spacer-side insertion. G2 recognized the full repeat sequence and could perform independent leader-side or spacer-side insertions, although the leader-side insertion was faster than spacer-side. The prespacer morphology requirements for Cas1-Cas2 varied, with G1 stringently requiring a 5-nucleotide 3' overhang and G2 being able to insert many forms of prespacers with variable efficiencies. These results highlight the intricacy of protein-DNA sequence interactions within the seemingly similar type II-A integration complexes and provide mechanistic insights into prespacer insertion. These interactions can be fine-tuned to expand the Cas1-Cas2 toolset for inserting small DNAs into diverse DNA targets."
https://openalex.org/W3033616744,"Urinary incontinence (UI) is a common condition that causes significant harm to the well-being and quality of life of pregnant women. This cross-sectional population-based study aimed to estimate the prevalence and identify factors associated with the occurrence of UI during pregnancy in women living in the municipality of Rio Grande (RS), Southern Brazil, between January 1 and December 31 of 2016, and included all puerperae living in this municipality that had a child in one of the two local maternity hospitals. The previously trained interviewers used a single standardized questionnaire, within 48 hours after delivery to retrieve information on maternal demographic, behavioral and reproductive/obstetric history, as well as socioeconomic status of the household and care received during pregnancy and childbirth. The multivariate analysis followed a previously defined hierarchical model using Poisson regression with robust variance adjustment and prevalence ratio (PR) as a measure of effect. As a result, 2,716 puerperae were identified, of which 2,694 (99.2%) participated in this study. The prevalence of urinary incontinence in the gestational period was 14.7% (95%CI: 13.4%-16.1%). After adjusted analysis, the likelihood of UI occurring varied significantly as per women's characteristics. For example, the PR for the occurrence of UI among women over 30 years of age was 2.05 (95% CI: 1.39-3.01) compared to adolescents. In two other groups of women who had their first pregnancy before the age of 20 or after the age of 30, the PR for UI was 1.36 (95% CI: 1.04-1.76) and 1.59 (95% CI: 1.01-2.51), respectively, when compared to those who became pregnant for the first time between 20 and 29 years of age. Finally, in two other groups of women, namely, those who reached 90 kg and over at the end of pregnancy and those who performed regular physical exercise and reported frequent urinary urgency, the PR was 2.49 (95% CI: 1.74-3.57), and 2.90 (95% CI: 2.10-4.00) compared to those who did not exercise and did not report urinary urgency, respectively. The authors concluded that UI showed a high prevalence in the study population. The identified risk factors can be well administered at primary health care level. The recommendation of regular physical exercise in pregnancy must be reviewed and better investigated with more robust designs because of possible facilitators for the occurrence of UI in this period."
https://openalex.org/W3033175290,"A multi-cell tube enhances the energy absorption considerably compared to the absorption of a single tube under the same conditions. A novel tube configuration, namely, a multi-cell hexagonal tube, was proposed in this paper. The multi-cell tubes consist of three basic elements: a 2-panel element and two 3-panel elements (I and II). Simplified super folding element theory was utilized to estimate the energy dissipation of the basic elements. Based on this estimation, a theoretical expression for the mean crushing force was developed for the proposed tubes. The relative errors between a simulation, an experiment and theoretical results were no more than 5%. The effects of the hexagonal tube size and wall thickness on the crashworthiness of the multi-cell tubes were investigated. To a certain extent, the energy absorption and peak crushing force increased as the tube size and thickness increased. The response surface method (RSM) and the multi-objective non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) were used to improve the crashworthiness of the tube, and Pareto fronts were achieved. Finally, it was concluded that the optimal solution is C = 45 mm, t1 = 3.0 mm, and t2 = 2.35 mm, and the corresponding SEA and PCF were 16.52 kJ/kg and 411.36 kN, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W3033962395,"Background Although many governments are promoting workforce participation (WP) by older people, evidence of WP’s effects on active aging is inadequate. We examined whether there is a gender-specific beneficial effect of lifetime WP from adulthood though old age against self-reported cognitive decline (CD) among community-dwelling older adults. Methods We used data from a community-based prospective study of 2,422 men and 2,852 women aged ≥65 with neither poor cognition nor disability in basic activities of daily living at baseline. Self-reported CD was measured using the Cognitive Performance Scale. Lifetime WP evaluated the presence or absence of WP at baseline, the longest-held occupation, and lifetime working years (total working years throughout lifetime). Generalized estimating equations of the multivariable Poisson regression model were applied to evaluate a cumulative incidence ratio (CIR) for self-reported CD and a 95% confidence interval (CI), controlled for age, education, self-perceived economic status, chronic medical conditions, smoking history, physical activity, depression, and instrumental activities of daily living. To examine any gender-specific association, stratified analyses by gender were performed. Results The 33-month cumulative incidence of self-reported CD was 15.7% in men and 14.4% in women. After covariate adjustments and mutual adjustment for three items of lifetime WP, men who had their longest held job in a white-collar occupation reported significantly decreased self-reported CD compared to men engaged in blue-collar jobs (CIR 0.72; 95% CI, 0.57–0.91), and women had a significant dose–response relationship between longer lifetime working years and less decline in subjective cognitive functioning (P for trend <0.029). Among both genders, WP at baseline was not associated with self-reported CD. Conclusions Our results suggest that lifetime WP, especially lifetime principal occupation in men and lifetime working years in women, may play a more prominent role in preventing self-reported CD than later-life WP."
https://openalex.org/W3034033134,"It has been suggested that lower urinary tract symptoms-benign prostatic hyperplasia (LUTS-BPH) may be a risk factor for inguinal hernia (IH). The aim of this study was to examine the emergence of a subsequent IH diagnosis in men with and without LUTS-BPH.From a database derived from the National Health Insurance Program covering 99% of the population in Taiwan, 22,310 men with LUTS-BPH and 22,310 matched men without LUTS-BPH were identified and followed for IH from 1997 to 2013. Both IH and LUTS-BPH were defined by the ninth revision of the International Classification of Diseases code (ICD9). Subjects younger than 20 years of age and with IH diagnosed before the index date were excluded. We used Cox proportional hazards regression models to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) for subsequent IH, controlling for potential confounders.Men with and without LUTS-BPH had similar age and comorbidity distributions. During the 10 years of follow-up, 1,303 (5.84%) men with LUTS-BPH and 735 (2.53%) men without LUTS-BPH developed IH. The mean time to IH was 4.02 years and 4.44 years, respectively. After adjusting for age and comorbidities, LUTS-BPH was associated with a two-fold increased risk of IH (HR:2.25, 95% CI = 2.04-2.49).This nation-wide population-based cohort study showed that LUTS-BPH increased the risk of subsequent IH in a Taiwanese Population."
https://openalex.org/W3033490961,"High heeled shoes have long been worn in society and they are known to cause biomechanical imbalances to not only the foot, but the whole musculoskeletal system. This study aims to show the detailed changes that happen to the shape of the transverse arch of the foot in high heels, using two different inclination degrees.68 women participated in this study. Two custom-made high heels were made with inclinations of 15 degrees and 30 degrees (cm). A weight-bearing ultrasound was used to assess the coronal view of the transverse arch in standing. ANOVA and Tuckey tests were used to compare the results between 0 degrees, 15 degrees and 30 degrees inclinations.The transverse arch height was slightly increased as the heel height increased (0DI-15DI: p = 0.5852 / 15DI-30DI: p = 0.395 / 0DI-30DI: p = 0.0593). The transverse arch length (0DI-15DI: p = 0.0486 / 15DI-30DI: p = 0.0004 / 0DI-30DI: p = 0.1105) and the area under the metatarsal heads (0DI-15DI: p = 0.0422 / 15DI-30DI: p = 0.0180 / 0DI-30DI: p = 0.9463) significantly decreased as the heel height increased.The main changes were viewed in the 30 degrees inclinations compared to 0 degrees inclination. When the toes are dorsiflexed in high heels, it stimulates the Windlass mechanism which in turn stiffens the plantar fascia and adducts the metatarsal heads, while the soft tissues shrink in response to loads.High heels affected the shape of the transverse arch even in short term standing, and these effects increased as the height of the heel increased."
https://openalex.org/W3033984665,"Background and objectives Sarcomas are commonly managed by surgical resection combined with radiotherapy. Sarcoma treatment is frequently complicated by chronic wounds and late radiation tissue injury (LRTI). This study aims to gain insight in the use and results of hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) for radiation-induced complications following sarcoma treatment. Methods All sarcoma patients treated between 2006 and 2017 in one of the five centers of the Institute for Hyperbaric Oxygen in the Netherlands were included for retrospective analysis. Results Thirty patients were included, 18 (60.0%) patients were treated for chronic wounds and 12 (40.0%) for LRTI. Two patients with chronic wounds were excluded from analysis as HBOT was discontinued within five sessions. In 11 of 16 (68.8%) patients treated for chronic wounds, improved wound healing was seen. Nine of 12 (75.0%) patients treated for LRTI reported a decline in pain. Reduction of fibrosis was seen in five of eight patients (62.5%) treated for LRTI. Conclusions HBOT is safe and beneficial for treating chronic wounds and LRTI in the sarcoma population. Awaiting further prospective results, we recommend referring to HBOT centers more actively in patients experiencing impaired wound healing or symptoms of delayed radiation-induced tissue injury following multimodality sarcoma treatment."
https://openalex.org/W3034045962,"Testisin (encoded by PRSS21) is a membrane anchored serine protease, which is tethered to the cell surface via a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchor. While testisin is found in abundance in spermatozoa, it is also expressed in microvascular endothelial cells where its function is unknown. Here we identify testisin as a novel regulator of physiological hormone-induced angiogenesis and microvascular endothelial permeability. Using a murine model of rapid physiological angiogenesis during corpus luteal development in the ovary, we found that mice genetically deficient in testisin (Prss21-/-) show a substantially increased incidence of hemorrhages which are significantly more severe than in littermate control Prss21+/+ mice. This phenotype was associated with increased vascular leakiness, demonstrated by a greater accumulation of extravasated Evans blue dye in Prss21-/- ovaries. Live cell imaging of in vitro cultured microvascular endothelial cells depleted of testisin by siRNA knockdown revealed that loss of testisin markedly impaired reorganization and tubule-like formation on Matrigel basement membranes. Moreover testisin siRNA knockdown increased the paracellular permeability to FITC-albumin across endothelial cell monolayers, which was associated with decreased expression of the adherens junction protein VE-cadherin and increased levels of phospho(Tyr658)-VE-cadherin, without affecting the levels of the tight junction proteins occludin and claudin-5, or ZO-1. Decreased expression of VE-cadherin in the neovasculature of Prss21-/- ovaries was also observed without marked differences in endothelial cell content, vascular claudin-5 expression or pericyte recruitment. Together, these data identify testisin as a novel regulator of VE-cadherin adhesions during angiogenesis and indicate a potential new target for regulating neovascular integrity and associated pathologies."
https://openalex.org/W3034084858,"Background Chlamydia pneumoniae is an obligate intracellular bacterium that causes respiratory infection. There may exist an association between C. pneumoniae, asthma, and production of immunoglobulin (Ig) E responses in vitro. Interleukin (IL-4) is required for IgE production. Objective We previously demonstrated that doxycycline suppresses C. pneumoniae-induced production of IgE and IL-4 responses in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from asthmatic subjects. Whereas macrolides have anti-chlamydial activity, their effect on in vitro anti-inflammatory (IgE) and IL-4 responses to C. pneumoniae have not been studied. Methods PBMC from IgE- adult atopic subjects (N = 5) were infected +/- C. pneumoniae BAL69, +/- azithromycin (0.1, 1.0 ug/mL) for 10 days. IL-4 and IgE levels were determined in supernatants by ELISA. IL-4 and IgE were detected in supernatants of PBMC (day 10). Results When azithromycin (0.1, 1.0 ug/ml) was added, IL-4 levels decreased. At low dose, IgE levels increased and at high dose, IgE levels decreased. When PBMC were infected with C. pneumoniae, both IL-4 and IgE levels decreased. Addition of azithromycin (0.1, 1.0 ug/mL) decreased IL-4 levels and had no effect on IgE levels. Conclusions These findings indicate that azithromycin decreases IL-4 responses but has a bimodal effect on IgE responses in PBMC from atopic patients in vitro."
https://openalex.org/W3034100568,"Gene flow and genetic variation were examined within and among populations of five of the most common spider species in shrublands of the mountainous Golden Gate Highlands National Park (GGHNP), South Africa. These species included three active hunters, Dendryphantes purcelli Peckham & Peckham, 1903 (Salticidae), Pherecydes tuberculatus O.P.-Cambridge, 1883 (Thomisidae) and Philodromus browningi Lawrence, 1952 (Philodromidae), and two web-builders, Neoscona subfusca (C.L. Koch, 1837) (Araneidae) and a Theridion Walckenaer, 1802 species (Theridiidae). A total of 249 spiders (57 D. purcelli, 69 N. subfusca, 34 P. browningi, 56 P. tuberculatus and 33 Theridion sp.) were collected and analysed from six shrubland localities in the park. Analyses of sequence variation of the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase c subunit I (COI) gene for each species revealed relatively low nucleotide diversity (π < 0.0420) but high genetic diversity (Hd > 0.6500) within populations for all species, except P. tuberculatus. Genetic differentiation was also noted to differ between species, with only P. tuberculatus indicating very large divergence (Fst > 0.2500). These results were reflected by gene flow, with D. purcelli, N. subfusca and the Theridion sp. estimated as experiencing more than one disperser per generation. Overall, highest gene flow was found in the two web-building species, indicating possible high dispersal ability of these spiders in the GGHNP. Additionally, constructed phylogenies indicated possible cryptic speciation occurring in the majority of the investigated species. Our current results indicate that the five investigated spider species were able to maintain gene flow between shrubland populations within the GGHNP to some degree, despite the mountainous landscape. However, further analyses incorporating additional molecular markers are needed to properly determine the extent of genetic diversity and gene flow of these species within the GGHNP."
https://openalex.org/W3033236526,"The autophagy-endolysosomal pathway is an evolutionally conserved degradation system that is tightly linked to a wide variety of physiological processes. Dysfunction of this system is associated with many pathological conditions such as cancer, inflammation and neurodegenerative diseases. Therefore, monitoring the cellular autophagy-endolysosomal activity is crucial for studies on the pathogenesis as well as therapeutics of such disorders. To this end, we here sought to create a novel means exploiting Keima, an acid-stable fluorescent protein possessing pH-dependent fluorescence excitation spectra, for precisely monitoring the autophagy-endolysosomal system. First, we generated three lines of transgenic (tg) mouse expressing monomeric Keima-fused MAP1LC3B (mKeima-LC3B). Then, these tg mice were subjected to starvation by food-restriction, and also challenged to neurodegeneration by genetically crossing with a mouse model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; i.e., SOD1H46R transgenic mouse. Unexpectedly, despite that a lipidated-form of endogenous LC3 (LC3-II) was significantly increased, those of mKeima-LC3B (mKeima-LC3B-II) were not changed under both stressed conditions. It was also noted that mKeima-LC3B-positive aggregates were progressively accumulated in the spinal cord of SOD1H46R;mKeima-LC3B double-tg mice, suggestive of acid-resistance and aggregate-prone natures of long-term overexpressed mKeima-LC3B in vivo. Next, we characterized mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) derived from mKeima-LC3B-tg mice. In contrast with in vivo, levels of mKeima-LC3B-I were decreased under starved conditions. Furthermore, when starved MEFs were treated with chloroquine (CQ), the abundance of mKeima-LC3B-II was significantly increased. Remarkably, when cultured medium was repeatedly changed between DMEM (nutrient-rich) and EBSS (starvation), acidic/neutral signal ratios of mKeima-LC3B-positive compartments were rapidly and reversibly shifted, which were suppressed by the CQ treatment, indicating that intraluminal pH of mKeima-LC3B-positive vesicles was changeable upon nutritional conditions of culture media. Taken together, although mKeima-LC3B-tg mice may not be an appropriate tool to monitor the autophagy-endolysosomal system in vivo, mKeima-LC3B must be one of the most sensitive reporter molecules for monitoring this system under in vitro cultured conditions."
https://openalex.org/W3033205164,"In adults, words are more effective than sounds at activating conceptual representations. We aimed to replicate these findings and extend them to infants. In a series of experiments using an eye tracker object recognition task, suitable for both adults and infants, participants heard either a word (e.g. cow) or an associated sound (e.g. mooing) followed by an image illustrating a target (e.g. cow) and a distracter (e.g. telephone). The results showed that adults reacted faster when the visual object matched the auditory stimulus and even faster in the word relative to the associated sound condition. Infants, however, did not show a similar pattern of eye-movements: only eighteen-month-olds, but not 9- or 12-month-olds, were equally fast at recognizing the target object in both conditions. Looking times, however, were longer for associated sounds, suggesting that processing sounds elicits greater allocation of attention. Our findings suggest that the advantage of words over associated sounds in activating conceptual representations emerges at a later stage during language development."
