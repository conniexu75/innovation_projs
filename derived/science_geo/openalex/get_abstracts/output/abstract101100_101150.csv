https://openalex.org/W2067376187,"Gene targeting was used to create a null allele at the epidermal growth factor receptor locus (Egfr). The phenotype was dependent on genetic background. EGFR deficiency on a CF-1 background resulted in peri-implantation death due to degeneration of the inner cell mass. On a 129/Sv background, homozygous mutants died at mid-gestation due to placental defects; on a CD-1 background, the mutants lived for up to 3 weeks and showed abnormalities in skin, kidney, brain, liver, and gastrointestinal tract. The multiple abnormalities associated with EGFR deficiency indicate that the receptor is involved in a wide range of cellular activities."
https://openalex.org/W2002273560,"Mice and cells lacking the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) were generated to examine its physiological role in vivo. Mutant fetuses are retarded in growth and die at mid-gestation in a 129/Sv genetic background, whereas in a 129/Sv x C57BL/6 cross some survive until birth and even to postnatal day 20 in a 129/Sv x C57BL/6 x MF1 background. Death in utero probably results from a defect in the spongiotrophoblast layer of the placenta. Newborn mutant mice have open eyes, rudimentary whiskers, immature lungs, and defects in the epidermis, correlating with the expression pattern of the EGFR as monitored by beta-galactosidase activity. These defects are probably cell-autonomous because chimeric mice generated with EGFR-/- embryonic stem cells contribute small amounts of mutant cells to some organs. These results indicate that the EGFR regulates epithelial proliferation and differentiation and that the genetic background influences the resulting phenotype."
https://openalex.org/W2060528711,"The hydrogen exchange behavior of native cytochrome c in low concentrations of denaturant reveals a sequence of metastable, partially unfolded forms that occupy free energy levels reaching up to the fully unfolded state. The step from one form to another is accomplished by the unfolding of one or more cooperative units of structure. The cooperative units are entire omega loops or mutually stabilizing pairs of whole helices and loops. The partially unfolded forms detected by hydrogen exchange appear to represent the major intermediates in the reversible, dynamic unfolding reactions that occur even at native conditions and thus may define the major pathway for cytochrome c folding."
https://openalex.org/W1987467454,"Previous work has shown that a fusion protein bearing a “nonremovable” N-terminal ubiquitin (Ub) moiety is short-lived in vivo, the fusion's Ub functioning as a degradation signal. The proteolytic system involved, termed the UFD pathway (Ub fusion degradation), was dissected in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae by analyzing mutations that perturb the pathway. Two of the five genes thus identified, UFD1 and UFD5, function at post-ubiquitination steps in the UFD pathway. UFD3 plays a role in controlling the concentration of Ub in a cell: ufd3 mutants have greatly reduced levels of free Ub, and the degradation of Ub fusions in these mutants can be restored by overexpressing Ub. UFD2 and UFD4 appear to influence the formation and topology of a multi-Ub chain linked to the fusion's Ub moiety. UFD1, UFD2, and UFD4 encode previously undescribed proteins of 40, 110, and 170 kDa, respectively. The sequence of the last ∼280 residues of Ufd4p is similar to that of E6AP, a human protein that binds to both the E6 protein of oncogenic papilloma viruses and the tumor suppressor protein p53, whose Ub-dependent degradation involves E6AP. UFD5 is identical to the previously identified SON1, isolated as an extragenic suppressor of sec63 alleles that impair the transport of proteins into the nucleus. UFD5 is essential for activity of both the UFD and N-end rule pathways (the latter system degrades proteins that bear certain N-terminal residues). We also show that a Lys → Arg conversion at either position 29 or position 48 in the fusion's Ub moiety greatly reduces ubiquitination and degradation of Ub fusions to β-galactosidase. By contrast, the ubiquitination and degradation of Ub fusions to dihydrofolate reductase are inhibited by the UbR29 but not by the UbR48 moiety. ufd4 mutants are unable to ubiquitinate the fusion's Ub moiety at Lys29, whereas ufd2 mutants are impaired in the ubiquitination at Lys48. These and related findings suggest that Ub-Ub isopeptide bonds in substrate-linked multi-Ub chains involve not only the previously identified Lys48 but also Lys29 of Ub, and that structurally different multi-Ub chains have distinct functions in Ub-dependent protein degradation.

In eukaryotes, a large fraction of intracellular proteolysis is mediated by pathways whose common feature is the covalent conjugation of ubiquitin (Ub)1 1The abbreviations used are: UbubiquitinORFopen reading framewtwild-typekbkilobase pairsβgalE. coli β-galactosidaseDHFRhamouse dihydrofolate reductase bearing a 14-residue C-terminal extension containing the “hemagglutinin” epitope (see “Experimental Procedures”)NLSnuclear localization signalPCRpolymerase chain reactionUFDUb fusion degradationbpbase pair(s)kbkilobase pair(s)X-gal5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl β-D-galactoside5-FOA5-fluoroorotic acidTricineN-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycineE6APE6-associated protein. to short-lived proteins prior to their degradation by the proteasome, a multisubunit, multicatalytic protease. The coupling of Ub to proteins is catalyzed by a family of Ub-conjugating (E2) enzymes. At least some of these enzymes function in complexes with proteins of a distinct class, termed recognins, E3s, or ubiquitin ligases (reviewed by Pickart, 1988Pickart C.M. Rechsteiner M. Ubiquitin.

The substrate-conjugated Ub acts as an accessory (or “secondary”) degradation signal (degron), in that its post-translational coupling to the substrate protein is mediated by sequence and conformational features of the substrate that act as an initial (or “primary”) degradation signal. ubiquitin open reading frame wild-type kilobase pairs E. coli β-galactosidase mouse dihydrofolate reductase bearing a 14-residue C-terminal extension containing the “hemagglutinin” epitope (see “Experimental Procedures”) nuclear localization signal polymerase chain reaction Ub fusion degradation base pair(s) kilobase pair(s) 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl β-D-galactoside 5-fluoroorotic acid N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine E6-associated protein. A Ub-protein conjugate contains an isopeptide bond between the C-terminal Gly76 of Ub and the ∊-amino group of a lysine in the substrate protein. Ubiquitination of a substrate often yields a substrate-linked multi-Ub chain, in which the C-terminal glycine of one Ub moiety is conjugated to an internal lysine of the adjacent Ub moiety, resulting in a chain of Ub-Ub conjugates. In the initially characterized multi-Ub chains, only Lys48 of a Ub moiety was found to be linked to another Ub moiety within a chain (Chau et al., 1989Chau V. Tobias J.W. Bachmair A. Marriott D.

The Molecular Biology of the Yeast Saccharomyces. Vol. 2. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1992: 539-581Google Scholar). More recently, Ub-Ub linkages mediated by other (Lys29 and Lys63) lysines of Ub have been described as well (Spence et al., 1995Spence J. Sadis S. Haas A.L. Finley D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1265-1273Crossref PubMed Google Scholar; Arnason and Ellison, 1994Arnason T.A. Ellison M.J. Mol. Cell.

Unlike branched Ub-protein conjugates, which are formed post-translationally, linear Ub adducts are formed as the translational products of natural or engineered Ub gene fusions (Bachmair et al., 1986Bachmair A. Finley D. Varshavsky A. Science. 1986; 234: 179-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (1383) Google Scholar; Finley et al., 1987Finley D. zkaynak E. Varshavsky A.

Nature. 1989; 338: 394-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar). In eukaryotes, such fusion proteins, for example, Ub-X-β-galactosidase (Ub-X-βgal), are rapidly cleaved at the Ub-protein junction by Ub-specific processing proteases, unless the junctional residue X is proline (P), in which case the rate of deubiquitination is greatly reduced (Bachmair et al., 1986Bachmair A. Finley D. Varshavsky A. Science. 1986; 234: 179-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (1383) Google Scholar). The X-βgal proteins produced in vivo by deubiquitination of the other 19 Ub-X-βgals are either long-lived or metabolically unstable, depending on the identity of their N-terminal residue X (Bachmair et al., 1986Bachmair A. Finley D. Varshavsky A. Science. 1986; 234: 179-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (1383) Google Scholar; Gonda et al., 1989Gonda D.K. Bachmair A. Wünning I. Tobias J.W. Lane W.S. Varshavsky A. J. Biol.

Science. 1991; 254: 1374-1377Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). The relation between the in vivo half-life of a protein and the identity of its N-terminal residue is referred to as the N-end rule (reviewed by Johnson et al., 1992Johnson E.S. Bartel B. Seufert W. Varshavsky A. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 497-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). The N-end rule-based degradation signal, termed the N-degron, comprises a destabilizing N-terminal residue and an internal lysine (or lysines) of a substrate (Bachmair and Varshavsky, 1989Bachmair A. Varshavsky A. Cell. 1989; 56: 1019-1032Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar; Johnson et al., 1990Johnson E.S. Gonda D.K. Varshavsky A.

This Lys residue is the site of formation of a multi-Ub chain (Chau et al., 1989Chau V. Tobias J.W. Bachmair A. Marriott D. Ecker D.J. Gonda D.K. Varshavsky A. Science. 1989; 243: 1576-1583Crossref PubMed Scopus (1118) Google Scholar). Deubiquitination of a Ub fusion is completely inhibited if the C-terminal Gly76 of its Ub moiety is converted into another residue, for example, Ala or Val (Butt et al., 1988Butt T.R. Khan M.I. Marsh J. Ecker D.J. Crooke S.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 16364-16371Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar; Johnson et al., 1992Johnson E.S. Bartel B. Seufert W. Varshavsky A. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 497-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, a Ub fusion such as Ub-P-βgal or UbV76-V-βgal (Fig. 1) is rapidly degraded (t1/2 of ∼4 min at 30°C) by a Ub-dependent system termed the UFD pathway (Ub fusion degradation). The targeting of a Ub fusion by the UFD pathway results in multiubiquitination of the fusion's “nonremovable” Ub moiety, a step required for the fusion's subsequent degradation by the proteasome (Johnson et al., 1992Johnson E.S. Bartel B. Seufert W. Varshavsky A. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 497-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). At least the initial steps of the UFD pathway are distinct from those of the N-end rule pathway: mutational elimination of N-recognin, the recognition component of the latter pathway, abolishes the degradation of N-end rule substrates but does not impair the degradation of Ub fusions such as UbV76-V-βgal (Bartel et al., 1990Bartel B. Wünning I. Varshavsky A. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3179-3189Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar; Johnson et al., 1992Johnson E.S. Bartel B. Seufert W. Varshavsky A. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 497-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Physiological substrates of the UFD pathway are unknown. It is also unknown whether these substrates are largely proteins that bear Ub-like domains, or whether the targeting of a Ub moiety by the UFD pathway is an epiphenomenon, the consequence of a step in a Ub-dependent pathway that involves recognition of Ub moieties within a post-translationally added multi-Ub chain. If so, physiological substrates of the UFD pathway may lack Ub-like domains. We began dissection of the S. cerevisiae UFD pathway by analyzing mutations that perturb the pathway, and by cloning the corresponding genes. Among the UFD genes characterized thus far (UFD1, UFD2, UFD4 and UFD5), all but one were unknown previously. We also probed the structure and substrate attachment points of multi-Ub chains produced by the UFD pathway. S. cerevisiae strains are listed in Table 1. Escherichia coli strain JM101 (propagated in Luria broth, LB) was used as a host for plasmids and phage M13 derivatives. Synthetic yeast media (Sherman et al., 1986Sherman F. Fink G.R. Hicks J.B. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1986Google Scholar) contained 0.67% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids (Difco) and either 2% glucose (SD medium), 2% galactose (SG medium), or 2% galactose and 2% raffinose (SGR medium) as a carbon source. X-gal plates contained synthetic media supplemented with 0.1 M KH2PO4-K2HPO4 (pH 7.0) and 40 εg/ml 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl β-D-galactoside (X-gal) (Rose et al., 1981Rose M. Casadaban M.J. Botstein D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 2460-2464Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Synthetic media lacking appropriate nutrient(s) were used to select for (and maintain) specific plasmids. Yeast mating, sporulation, and tetrad analysis were performed as described (Sherman et al., 1986Sherman F. Fink G.R. Hicks J.B. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1986Google Scholar). Transformation of S. cerevisiae was carried out according to Baker(1991). Strains were cured of URA3-expressing plasmids using 5-fluoroorotic acid (5-FOA) (Boeke et al., 1984Boeke J.D. LaCroute F. Fink G.R. Mol. & Gen. Genet. 1984; 197: 345-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (1705) Google Scholar). Enzymatic activity of βgal in extracts from mid-exponential cultures growing in synthetic media was measured using o-nitrophenyl-β-D-galactoside (Ausubel et al. 1989) or chlorophenol red-β-D-galactopyranoside (Eustice et al., 1991Eustice D.C. Feldman P.A. Colberg-Poley A.M. Buckery R.M. Neubauer R.H. BioTechniques. 1991; 11: 739-743PubMed Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined using the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad).Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab Growth at 37°C was assayed by streaking wt and mutant cells pregrown on YPD plates (Sherman et al., 1986Sherman F. Fink G.R. Hicks J.B. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1986Google Scholar) at 23°C onto YPD plates and incubating at 37°C. Canavanine sensitivity was estimated by streaking cells pregrown on YPD plates at 23°C onto SD plates lacking arginine and containing 1.5 εg/ml canavanine. Sensitivity to UV light was estimated by exposing a few hundred cells on a YPD plate to a UV source for increasing amounts of time, followed by incubation in the dark at 30°C. Standard procedures were used (Ausubel et al., 1989Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Smith J.A. Seidman J.G. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Wiley-Interscience, New York1989Google Scholar). The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed using the GeneAmp kit (Perkin Elmer). Oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis was carried out using the Mutagene kit (Bio-Rad). DNA was sequenced by subcloning restriction fragments into M13- mp18 or M13mp19 (Yanisch-Perron et al., 1985Yanisch-Perron C. Vieira J. Messing J. Gene (Amst.). 1985; 33: 103-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (11465) Google Scholar), by generating sets of deletions using the method of Dale et al. (1985), and by utilizing oligonucleotide primers hybridizing to regions of the DNA that had already been sequenced. Single-stranded M13 DNA was sequenced using the Sequenase kit (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). Supercoiled plasmids were prepared for sequencing as described by Hattori and Sakaki(1986). For Southern analysis, DNA was isolated from S. cerevisiae as described by Hoffman and Winston(1987), and processed for hybridization as described by Bartel et al.(1990). DNA probes were labeled using [α-32P]dCTP and the method of Feinberg and Vogelstein (1986). A Southern blot of yeast chromosomes fractionated by pulse-field gel electrophoresis (Chromoblot) was purchased from Clontech. PrimeClone filters (Olson et al., 1986Olson M.V. Dutchik J.E. Graham M.Y. Brodeur G.M. Helms C. Frank M. MacCollin M. Scheinman R. Frank T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci U. S. A. 1986; 83: 7826-7830Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar) were a gift from L. Riles and M. Olson and were probed according to their directions. Computer-assisted sequence analysis was performed using the Genetics Computer Group (GCG) Sequence Analysis Software Package (Devereux et al., 1984Devereux J. Haeberli P. Smithies O. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 387-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (11536) Google Scholar). DNA and predicted amino acid sequences were compared to data bases (GenBank, EMBL, PIR, SWISS-PROT) using either the FastA or Blast algorithms (Altschul et al., 1990Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (70762) Google Scholar). The URA3-marked, 2ε-based plasmids pUb-P-eK-βgal, pUb-R-eK-βgal, and pUbV76-V-eΔK-βgal, which expressed, respectively, Ub-P-eK-βgal, Ub-R-eK-βgal, and UbV76-V-eΔK-βgal (Fig. 1) from the PGAL10 promoter in S. cerevisiae, have been described elsewhere (Bachmair et al., 1986Bachmair A. Finley D. Varshavsky A. Science. 1986; 234: 179-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (1383) Google Scholar; Johnson et al., 1992Johnson E.S. Bartel B. Seufert W. Varshavsky A. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 497-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Other plasmids utilized the same vector background and were constructed as follows. pUbR48,V76-V-eΔK-βgal, which expressed UbR48,V76-V-eΔK-βgal (Fig. 1), was produced using oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis of a HindIII-BamHI fragment of pUbV76-V-eΔK-βgal to convert Lys48 of UbV76 into Arg48. The mutagenized XhoI-BamHI fragment was ligated into the vector-containing XhoI-BamHI fragment of pUbV76-V-eΔK-βgal. The plasmid pUbR29,V76-V-eΔK-βgal, which expressed UbR29,V76-V-eΔK-βgal (Fig. 1), was produced using PCR. The template pUbV76-V-eΔK-βgal was initially amplified in two sets of reactions. One PCR utilized primer A (5’-GAAAGTTCCAAAGAGAAGG-3’), which annealed 5’ to the XhoI site in these plasmids, and primer B (5’-TGAATTCTCGACTTAACG-3’), whose sequence encoded Arg29 instead of Lys29. The second PCR utilized primer C (5’-AAGTCGAGAATTCAAGAC-3’), whose sequence also encoded Arg29, and primer D (5’-CAAGCTCCGGATCCGTG-3’), which annealed to the lacI-derived DNA 3’ to the BamHI site. The products of these reactions were isolated and used together as a template in another round of amplification, using primers A and D. The XhoI/BamHI-cut PCR product was ligated to the vector-containing XhoI-BamHI fragment of pUbV76-V-eΔK-βgal, yielding pUbR29,V76-V-eΔK-βgal. The plasmid pUbR29,48,V76-V-eΔK-βgal, which expressed UbR29,48,V76-V-eΔK-βgal (Fig. 1), was constructed similarly to pUbR29,V76-V-eΔK-βgal, except that pUbR48,V76-V-eΔK-βgal was used as the initial template. pUbV76-V-eΔK-DHFRha encoded UbV76-V-eΔK-DHFRha (Fig. 1), a fusion of UbV76-V-eΔK to mouse dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) bearing a 14-residue C-terminal extension (GTYPYDVPDYAAFL) derived in part from hemagglutinin of influenza virus. The construction of this plasmid is partially described in Johnson, 1992Johnson E.S. Substrate Selection in Ubiquitin-dependent Proteolysis. 1992; (Ph. D. Thesis, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA)Google Scholar; other details are available on request. pUbR29,V76-V-eΔK-DHFRha, pUbR48,V76-V-eΔK-DHFRha, and pUbR29,48,V76-V-eΔK-DHFRha, which expressed, respectively, UbR29,V76-V-eΔK-DHFRha, UbR48,V76-V-eΔK-DHFRha, and UbR29,48,V76-V-eΔK-DHFRha (Fig. 1), were constructed by ligating the small XhoI-BamHI fragments of the corresponding Ub-βgal-encoding plasmids to the vector-containing XhoI-BamHI fragment of pUbV76-V-eΔK-DHFRha. All final constructs were verified by sequencing. “eK” denotes a 45-residue E. coli Lac repressor-derived sequence; eΔK indicates an eK-derived sequence in which Lys15 and Lys17 have been replaced with Arg residues (Fig. 1). In eΔK-βgal fusions (constructs II-V in Fig. 1), eΔK contained Gly-Ser at positions 39 and 40, instead of Leu-Ala in the otherwise identical eK regions of eK-βgal fusions (Johnson et al., 1992Johnson E.S. Bartel B. Seufert W. Varshavsky A. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 497-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). The eΔK sequence in eΔK-DHFRha fusions (constructs VI-IX in Fig. 1) contained the sequence Arg-Ser-Gly-Ile-Met in place of residues 39-45 of eK. The eK region is required for the degradation of βgal- or DHFR-based N-end rule substrates (Bachmair and Varshavsky, 1989Bachmair A. Varshavsky A. Cell. 1989; 56: 1019-1032Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar; Johnson et al., 1990Johnson E.S. Gonda D.K. Varshavsky A.

Bartel B. Seufert W. Varshavsky A. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 497-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). The plasmid pUbV76-V-eK-Ura3ha::TRP1, which expressed UbV76-V-eK-Ura3ha, bearing the hemagglutinin tag between the eK and Ura3p moieties (Fig. 1), was constructed from pBA2 (provided by B. Andrews, K. Madura, and J. Dohmen), a pRS314-derived (Sikorski and Hieter, 1989Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) TRP1-marked CEN plasmid expressing Ub-M-eK-Ura3ha from the PCUP1 promoter. A ∼200-bp BstXI-BamHI fragment (derived from pUbV76-V-eΔK-βgal (Johnson et al., 1992Johnson E.S. Bartel B. Seufert W. Varshavsky A. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 497-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar)) encoding the C terminus of UbV76 and the junction, was used to replace a homologous BstXI-BamHI fragment in pBA2. pCUP1-Ub::LEU2, which expressed Ub from the PCUP1 promoter, was produced from pRB238 (provided by R. Baker), a YEplac195-based plasmid containing a BamHI-ClaI fragment of YEp96 (Hochstrasser et al., 1991Hochstrasser M. Ellison M.J. Chau V. Varshavsky A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4606-4610Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). The small BamHI-PstI fragment of pRB238 was ligated to BamHI/PstI-cut YEplac181 (Gietz and Sugino, 1988Gietz R.D. Sugino A. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 74: 527-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (2522) Google Scholar). The strain BWG1-7a (Table 1), carrying pUb-P-eK-βgal and growing in SG medium, was mutagenized with ethyl methanesulfonate (Sherman et al., 1986Sherman F. Fink G.R. Hicks J.B. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1986Google Scholar) to ∼18% survival and plated on SG plates lacking uracil. After 4 days at 23°C, plates containing a total of ∼ 2.5 × 104 colonies were replica-plated onto SG/X-gal plates and incubated at 23 or 37°C. About 400 blue colonies were observed; 63 of them, which remained blue upon replating on SG/X-gal plates, were tested for βgal activity using the o-nitrophenyl-β-D-galactoside assay (Ausubel et al., 1989Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Smith J.A. Seidman J.G. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Wiley-Interscience, New York1989Google Scholar). The 22 mutants that passed this test were cured of pUb-P-eK-βgal using 5-FOA (Boeke et al., 1984Boeke J.D. LaCroute F. Fink G.R. Mol. & Gen. Genet. 1984; 197: 345-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (1705) Google Scholar), retransformed with plasmids expressing Ub-M-βgal, Ub-R-βgal, or Ub-P-βgal (Bachmair et al., 1986Bachmair A. Finley D. Varshavsky A. Science. 1986; 234: 179-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (1383) Google Scholar), and tested by carrying out pulse-chase analyses and additional βgal activity assays. The mating type of several mutants was switched by a transient expression of HO endonuclease (Sherman et al., 1986Sherman F. Fink G.R. Hicks J.B. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1986Google Scholar) (using HO expressed from the PGAL10 promoter; plasmid provided by J. Brill), and the mutants were assigned to complementation groups by crossing the mutants to each other and by testing the resulting diploids (expressing Ub-P-βgal) on SG/X-gal plates. Eleven of the thus characterized mutations were assigned to five complementation groups, termed ufd1-ufd5 (Ub fusion degradation). The ufd1-ufd5 strains listed in Table 1 were chosen for further analysis. S. cerevisiae JD52 (Table 1) expressing UbV76-V-eK-Ura3ha was transformed with NotI-digested DNA from a yeast genomic DNA library bearing quasi-random insertions of the mTn3 (LEU2 lac) minitransposon (Burns et al., 1994Burns N. Grimwade B. Ross-Macdonald P.B. Choi E-Y. Finberg K. Roeder G.S. Snyder M. Genes & Dev. 1994; 8: 1087-1105Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar) (a gift from M. Snyder, Yale University), and plated on SD plates lacking tryptophan and leucine. After 2 days of growth at 23°C, the colonies were replica-plated onto SD plates lacking uracil and tryptophan, to select for mTn3 insertion-bearing cells with elevated steady-state levels of UbV76-V-eK-Ura3ha (see “Results”). About 100 Trp+ Leu+ Ura+ colonies (out of the ∼4 × 104 colonies screened) were picked and retested for growth on medium lacking uracil. 24 of these putative mutants were cured of pUbV76-V-eK-Ura3ha::TRP1 (expressing UbV76-V-eK-Ura3ha) by selection with 5-FOA, and thereafter retransformed with plasmids expressing Ub-R-eK-βgal or UbV76-V-eΔK-βgal. These isolates were then screened for blue colonies on SG/X-gal plates, or examined by pulse-chase analysis. Based on these and other tests, the insertion ufd mutants (impaired in the degradation of UbV76-V-eΔK-βgal) were sorted into five classes. In the mutants of one class, UbV76-V-eΔK-βgal was metabolically stabilized while the degradation of R-βgal was unaffected; in addition, the pattern of ubiquitinated UbV76-V-βgal derivatives was similar to that seen with the ufd4-1 mutant (Fig. 2, lanes 13-15). These mutants were confirmed to contain insertions in the UFD4 gene (see below). The other classes of insertion ufd mutants remain to be assigned to specific UFD genes. The strain PM373 (ufd1; Table 1), carrying a derivative of pUb-P-eK-βgal in which the URA3 marker had been replaced with LEU2 (Bartel et al., 1990Bartel B. Wünning I. Varshavsky A. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3179-3189Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar), was transformed with a S. cerevisiae genomic DNA library carried in the URA3, CEN4-based vector YCp50 (Rose et al., 1987Rose M.D. Novick P. Thomas J.H. Botstein D. Fink G.R. Gene (Amst.). 1987; 60: 237-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar), and plated on SD plates lacking uracil and leucine. After 3 days at 30°C, these plates, containing ∼8 × 103 colonies, were replica-plated on SG/X-gal plates lacking leucine and uracil to screen for white colonies (low levels of βgal). Cells from 25 white colonies thus obtained were cured of their library-derived plasmids by selection on 5-FOA plates lacking leucine, and retested on X-gal plates, where 5 isolates formed blue colonies. Plasmid DNA (Hoffman and Winston, 1987Hoffman C.S. Winston F. Gene (Amst.). 1987; 57: 267-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (2043) Google Scholar) from these isolates was used to transform E. coli to ampicillin (amp) resistance. The YCp50 library-derived plasmids were distinguished from the plasmid expressing Ub-P-βgal by picking white E. coli transformants on LB/amp plates containing X-gal.

Isolated working rat hearts perfused with 1.2 mM palmitate were subjected to 30 min of global ischemia, followed by 60 min of aerobic reperfusion. Fatty acid oxidation rates during reperfusion were 136% higher than rates seen in aerobically perfused control hearts, despite the fact that cardiac work recovered to only 16% of pre-ischemic values. Neither the activity of carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1, or the IC50 value of malonyl-CoA for carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 were altered in mitochondria isolated from aerobic, ischemic, or reperfused ischemic hearts. Levels of malonyl-CoA were extremely low at the end of reperfusion compared to levels seen in aerobic controls, as was the activity of acetyl-CoA carboxylase, the enzyme which produces malonyl-CoA. The activity of 5’-AMP-activated protein kinase, which has been shown to phosphorylate and inactivate acetyl-CoA carboxylase in other tissues, was significantly increased at the end of ischemia, and remained elevated throughout reperfusion. These results suggest that accumulation of 5’-AMP during ischemia results in an activation of AMP-activated protein kinase, which phosphorylates and inactivates ACC during reperfusion. The subsequent decrease in malonyl-CoA levels will result in accelerated fatty acid oxidation rates during reperfusion of ischemic hearts.

The subsequent decrease in malonyl-CoA levels will result in accelerated fatty acid oxidation rates during reperfusion of ischemic hearts. Fatty acids are a major fuel of the heart, with fatty acid oxidation normally providing 60-70% of the hearts energy requirements (1Bing R.J. Physiol.

In the presence of high circulating levels of fatty acids, fatty acid oxidation increases and accounts for almost all the hearts ATP production(1Bing R.J. Physiol.

Reperfusion of ischemic hearts with high levels of fatty acids results in a rapid recovery of fatty acid oxidation(10Liedtke A.J. DeMaison L. Eggleston A.M. Cohen L.M. Nellis S.H. Circ. Res. 1988; 62: 535-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 11Lopaschuk G.D. Spafford M.A. Davies N.J. Wall S.R. Circ.

This over-reliance on fatty acid oxidation has a detrimental effect on functional recovery of hearts following severe ischemia(13Lopaschuk G.D. Wall S.R. Olley P.M. Davies N.J. Circ. Res. 1988; 63: 1036-1043Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 14Lopaschuk G.D. Saddik M. Barr R. Huang L. Barker C. Muzyka R.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 263: E1046-E1053PubMed Google Scholar), with several lines of evidence suggesting that fatty acid inhibition of glucose oxidation contributes to this functional depression(11Lopaschuk G.D.

In addition to the level of circulating fatty acid concentration, workload is another important determinant of myocardial fatty acid oxidation rates. Normally, a close correlation exists between cardiac work and fatty acid oxidation, with fatty acid oxidation increasing and decreasing in parallel with increases and decreases in cardiac work (18Neely J.R. Whitmer K.M. Mochizuki S. Circ. Res. 1976; 38: I-22-I-30Google Scholar). However, following severe ischemia in rat hearts, fatty acid oxidation rates are high, even though mechanical function is markedly depressed(10Liedtke A.J. DeMaison L. Eggleston A.M. Cohen L.M. Nellis S.H. Circ. Res. 1988; 62: 535-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 11Lopaschuk G.D. Spafford M.A. Davies N.J. Wall S.R. Circ.

This suggests that normal control of fatty acid oxidation is altered in the post-ischemic heart. Since fatty acid oxidation accounts for the majority of oxygen consumption following ischemia(19Renstrom B. Nellis S.H. Liedtke A.J. Circ. Res. 1989; 65: 1094-1101Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), this uncoupling of fatty acid oxidation from cardiac work probably contributes to the poor cardiac efficiency seen during reperfusion (i.e. an increase in oxygen consumed/unit of cardiac work)(10Liedtke A.J. DeMaison L. Eggleston A.M. Cohen L.M. Nellis S.H. Circ. Res. 1988; 62: 535-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 20Benzi R.H. Lerch R. Circ. Res. 1992; 71: 567-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The mechanism responsible for the deregulation of fatty acid oxidation during reperfusion is not clear. Recent studies have shown malonyl-CoA to be an important regulator of fatty acid oxidation in the heart(21Saddik M. Gamble J. Witters L.A. Lopaschuk G.D. J. Biol.

We recently demonstrated a close relationship between cardiac malonyl-CoA levels and fatty acid oxidation rates in aerobically perfused working rat hearts(21Saddik M. Gamble J. Witters L.A. Lopaschuk G.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25836-25845Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This raises the possibility that either a decrease in malonyl-CoA levels, an increase in CPT 1 activity, or a decrease in the sensitivity of CPT 1 to malonyl-CoA inhibition may contribute to the high fatty acid oxidation rates seen during reperfusion of ischemic hearts. carnitine palmitoyltransferase coenzyme A acetyl-CoA carboxylase the 265-kDa isoform of ACC the 280-kDa isoform of ACC 5’AMP-activated protein kinase heart rate peak systolic pressure developed pressure the synthetic peptide substrate with the amino acid sequence HMRSAMSGLHLVKRR used to assay AMPK poly(ethylene) glycol. carnitine palmitoyltransferase coenzyme A acetyl-CoA carboxylase the 265-kDa isoform of ACC the 280-kDa isoform of ACC 5’AMP-activated protein kinase heart rate peak systolic pressure developed pressure the synthetic peptide substrate with the amino acid sequence HMRSAMSGLHLVKRR used to assay AMPK poly(ethylene) glycol. Malonyl-CoA is produced from acetyl-CoA carboxylase, which catalyzes the carboxylation of acetyl-CoA to form malonyl-CoA(24Hardie D.G. Prog.

Both a 280-kDa isoform (ACC 280) and a 265-kDa isoform (ACC 265) are present in the heart, with ACC 280 predominating(21Saddik M. Gamble J. Witters L.A. Lopaschuk G.D. J. Biol.

It is now apparent that a major kinase responsible for short-term inactivation of ACC is a novel 5’-AMP-dependent protein kinase (AMPK)(29Hardie D.G. Biochim. Biophys.

To date, AMPK activity has not been extensively characterized in the heart, although mRNA levels for the catalytic subunit of AMPK is abundant in heart tissue(34Aquan K. Scott J. See C.G. Sarkar N.H. Gene (Amst.). 1994; 149: 345-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). It is also not clear to what degree cardiac ACC is controlled by phosphorylation. In this study, we determined whether a decrease in malonyl-CoA levels and/or an increase in CPT 1 activity was responsible for the high rates of fatty acid oxidation in the reperfused ischemic heart. We also determined the effects of ischemia and reperfusion on the activity of both ACC and AMPK. Male Wistar rats (250-300 g) were anesthetized with an injection of sodium pentobarbital (60 mg/kg intraperitoneally). Hearts were subsequently excised from unconscious animals, the aorta cannulated, and a retrograde perfusion with Krebs-Henseleit buffer (pH 7.4, gassed with 95% O2 and 5% CO2, 37°C) initiated. During this initial perfusion, the hearts were trimmed of excess tissue, and both the pulmonary artery and the opening of the left atrium cannulated. Following a 10-min Langendorff washout period, hearts were switched to the working mode. Perfusate was delivered from the oxygenator into the left atrium at an 11.5 mm Hg preload, and was ejected from spontaneously beating hearts against an 80 mm Hg hydrostatic afterload(11Lopaschuk G.D. Spafford M.A. Davies N.J. Wall S.R. Circ. Res. 1990; 66: 546-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Perfusate consisted of 100 ml of re-circulated Krebs-Henseleit buffer (pH 7.4, gassed with 95% O2 and 5% CO2, 37°C) containing 1.2 mM [1-14C]palmitate, 3% bovine serum albumin, 11 mM glucose, 2.5 mM free Ca2+, and 100 microunits/ml insulin (bovine, regular Connaught-Nova, Willowdale, Ontario, Canada). The perfusion protocol involved: (a) a 60-min aerobic perfusion, (b) a 30-min aerobic perfusion followed by a 30-min period of global no-flow ischemia, or (c) a 30-min aerobic perfusion followed by a 30-min period of global no-flow ischemia and a subsequent 60-min period of aerobic reperfusion. Heart rate (HR), peak systolic pressure (PSP), developed pressure (ΔP), cardiac output, aortic flow, coronary flow, and O2 consumption were measured as described previously(13Lopaschuk G.D. Wall S.R. Olley P.M. Davies N.J. Circ. Res. 1988; 63: 1036-1043Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 17Lopaschuk G.D. Wambolt R.B. Barr R.L. J. Pharmacol. Exp.

Steady state rates of palmitate oxidation were measured in aerobic or reperfused ischemic hearts by quantitatively collecting 14CO2 produced from hearts perfused with 1.2 mM [1-14C]palmitate (approximately 50,000 dpm/ml buffer). Collection of 14CO2 released as a gas in the oxygenation chamber and the 14CO2 trapped in the NaHCO3 in the perfusate was performed as described previously(11Lopaschuk G.D. Spafford M.A. Davies N.J.

Res. 1988; 63: 1036-1043Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Sampling was performed at 10-min intervals throughout the 60-min aerobic perfusion, or at 10-min intervals during reperfusion of previously ischemic hearts(11Lopaschuk G.D. Spafford M.A. Davies N.J. Wall S.R. Circ. Res. 1990; 66: 546-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). At the end of the perfusions, the hearts were freeze-clamped with Wollenberger tongs cooled to the temperature of liquid nitrogen. Frozen ventricular tissue was weighed and powdered in a mortar and pestle cooled to the temperature of liquid nitrogen. A portion of the powdered tissue was used to determine the dry-to-wet ratio. CoA esters were extracted from the powdered tissue using 6% perchloric acid, as described previously(21Saddik M. Gamble J. Witters L.A. Lopaschuk G.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25836-25845Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The CoA esters were separated and quantified using a previously described high performance liquid chromatography procedure(35King M.T. Reiss P.D. Cornell N.W. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 166: 70-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). 5’-AMP levels from the perchloric acid extract were determined using previously described methodology(17Lopaschuk G.D. Wambolt R.B. Barr R.L. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Therap. 1993; 264: 135-144PubMed Google Scholar). Approximately 200 mg of frozen tissue was homogenized, using a Tekmar homogenizer, for 30 s at 4°C in 0.4 ml of buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.25 M mannitol, 1 mM EGTA, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 50 mM sodium fluoride, 5 mM sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mM benzamidine, and 4 εg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor. The homogenate was then centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 20 min at 4°C, and the resultant supernatant made up to 2.5% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 8000 (PEG 8000) using a stock 25% (w/v) PEG 8000 solution. The solution was stirred for 10 min, the precipitate removed by centrifugation (10,000 × g for 10 min), and the supernatant made up to 6% PEG 8000. After stirring and centrifugation as before, the pellet was washed with a 6% PEG 8000/homogenizing buffer and resuspended in 100 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 50 mM sodium fluoride, 5 mM sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 0.02% sodium azide, 1 mM benzamidine, 4 εg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, and 10% glycerol. Protein content was measured using the BCA method(36Smith P.K. Fujimoto E.K. Goeke N.M. Olson B.J. Klenk D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (18512) Google Scholar). Acetyl-CoA carboxylase activity in the 6% PEG 8000 fraction was determined using the [14C]bicarbonate fixation assay (37Witters L.A. Kemp B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2864-2867Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The assay mixture contained 60.6 mM Tris acetate (pH 7.5), 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1.3 εM 2-mercaptoethanol, 2.1 mM ATP, 1.1 mM acetyl-CoA, 5 mM magnesium acetate, 18.2 mM NaH14CO3 (approximately 1000 dpm/nmol), and 25 εg of the 6% PEG 8000 pellet. Following a 2-min incubation at 37°C, in the absence or presence of 10 mM citrate, the reaction was stopped by adding 25 εl of 10% perchloric acid, then centrifuged at 2000 × g for 20 min. Radioactivity of supernatant was determined using standard liquid scintillation counting procedures. AMPK was assayed in the 6% PEG 8000 fraction by following the incorporation of 32P into a synthetic peptide (termed SAMS peptide) with the amino acid sequence HMRSAMSGLHLVKRR(29Hardie D.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1123: 231-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 37Witters L.A. Kemp B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2864-2867Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The assay was performed in a 25-εl total volume containing 40 mM HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.0), 80 mM NaCl, 8% glycerol, 0.8 mM EDTA, 200 εM SAMS peptide, 0.8 mM dithiothreitol, 5 mM MgCl2, 200 εM [γ-32P]ATP (400-600 dpm/pmol), and 6-8 εg of the 6% PEG 8000 pellet. The assay was performed in the absence or presence of 200 εM 5’-AMP at 30°C for 5 min. The reaction was initiated by the addition of [32P]ATP/Mg. At the end of the incubation, 15-εl aliquots were removed and spotted on 1 × 1-cm square of phosphocellulose paper (P81, Whatman), which were subsequently placed into 500 ml of 150 mM H3PO4. These papers were washed 4 times for 30 min with 150 mM H3PO4, and then washed 20 min with acetone. The papers were then dried and placed in vials containing 4 ml of scintillant. Radioactivity was determined using standard liquid scintillation procedures. A series of hearts were perfused under conditions identical to those described above except that radiolabeled [14C]palmitate was not included in the perfusate. At the end of the aerobic perfusion, the ischemic perfusion, or the reperfusion period, hearts were rapidly cut down and mitochondria isolated as described previously(21Saddik M. Gamble J. Witters L.A. Lopaschuk G.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25836-25845Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). CPT 1 activity was determined by the method of Bremer(38Bremer J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1981; 665: 628-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). The mitochondrial preparations (35-40 εg) were preincubated with various concentrations of malonyl-CoA (0-1 εM) in an incubation mixture containing 75 mM KCl, 50 mM mannitol, 25 mM HEPES (pH 7.3), 2 mM NaCN, 0.2 mM EGTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol, and 1% bovine serum albumin (essentially fatty acid free) at 30°C for 3 min. Following this period, 0.1 εCi of L-[methyl-3H]carnitine was added to a final L-carnitine concentration of 200 εM, and the incubation was continued for a further 6 min. The reaction was stopped by adding 100 εl of 10 N HCl. The [3H]palmitoyl carnitine was extracted with butanol and counted using standard liquid scintillation procedures. Malonyl-CoA decarboxylase was assayed by the method of Svoronos and Kumar(39Svoronos S. Kumar S. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1988; 90: 179-185Google Scholar), coupled to the method of Constantin-Teodosiu et al.(40Constantin-Teodosiu D. Cederblad G. Hultman E. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 198: 347-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The mitochondrial preparations (25-50 εg) were incubated in 210 εl of reaction mixture containing 0.1 M Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.5 mM dithiothreitol, and 1 mM malonyl-CoA at 37°C for 10 min. The reaction was stopped by adding 40 εl of 0.5 M perchloric acid. The solution was then neutralized with 2.2 M KHCO3 and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 3 min. The acetyl-CoA formed by malonyl-CoA decarboxylase was determined by following the conversion of acetyl-CoA to [14C]citrate in the presence of [14C]oxaloacetate and citrate synthase. [14C]Oxaloacetate was initially formed by a transamination reaction utilizing aspartate aminotransferase and [14C]aspartate, as described by Constantin-Teodosiu et al.(40Constantin-Teodosiu D. Cederblad G. Hultman E. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 198: 347-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Following the reaction, sodium glutamate and aspartate aminotransferase were used to remove excess [14C]oxaloacetate after the citrate synthase reaction by transaminating unreacted [14C]oxaloacetate back to [14C]aspartate. Dowex (50W-8X, 100-200 mesh) was then used to separate [14C]aspartate from [14C]citrate. Acetyl-CoA content of supernatant samples was quantified by comparison to acetyl-CoA standard curves. The unpaired t test was used for the determination of statistical difference of group means. Analysis of variance followed by the Neuman-Keuls test was used in the determination of statistical difference in groups containing three sample populations. A value of p < 0.05 was considered as significant. All data are presented as mean ± S.E. Functional recovery of hearts reperfused after the 30-min period of global ischemia is shown in Fig. 1. In the hearts reperfused with the buffer containing 11 mM glucose and 1.2 mM palmitate, cardiac work recovered to a maximum of 30% of preischemic values over the 60-min reperfusion period. Mechanical function in aerobic hearts and reperfused ischemic hearts is summarized in Table 1. Impaired cardiac work was reflected by decreases in both cardiac output and peak systolic pressure. In addition, heart rate, ΔP, and rate pressure product were all depressed during reperfusion. Although cardiac work was only 16% of aerobic values at 60 min of reperfusion, oxygen consumption recovered to 48% of initial aerobic values. As a result, a significant decrease in cardiac efficiency (cardiac work/O2 consumed) was seen during reperfusion.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab Palmitate oxidation rates in aerobic and reperfused ischemic hearts are shown in Table 2. As previously observed(4Saddik M. Lopaschuk G.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8162-8170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Lopaschuk G.D. Spafford M.A. Davies N.J. Wall S.R. Circ. Res. 1990; 66: 546-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar), cumulative rates of palmitate oxidation were linear in both the aerobic hearts and during the 60-min period of aerobic reperfusion (data not shown). Despite the observation that cardiac work was markedly impaired during reperfusion, palmitate oxidation rates were significantly higher during reperfusion than rates seen in aerobically perfused nonischemic hearts. Previous studies by Neely's group have shown that fatty acid oxidation in aerobically perfused hearts is closely correlated to the work performed by the hearts(18Neely J.R. Whitmer K.M. Mochizuki S. Circ. Res. 1976; 38: I-22-I-30Google Scholar). We therefore also normalized palmitate oxidation rates for both cardiac work and oxygen consumption (Table 2). During reperfusion, a dramatic increase in palmitate oxidized per unit of work and per O2 consumed was observed, suggesting that the normal relationship between fatty acid oxidation and both cardiac work and oxygen uptake are dramatically altered in the reperfused ischemic heart.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab To determine if an alteration in CPT 1 activity could explain the high rates of fatty acid oxidation during reperfusion of ischemic hearts, we isolated mitochondria from fresh hearts cut down at the end of the aerobic period, at the end of the ischemic period, or at the end of the reperfusion period. The effects of malonyl-CoA on CPT 1 activity is shown in Fig. 2. In the absence of malonyl-CoA, CPT 1 activity was not dramatically different between any of the experimental groups. As a result, it is unlikely that an increase in CPT 1 activity accounts for the high fatty acid oxidation rates during reperfusion of ischemic hearts. The sensitivity of CPT 1 to malonyl-CoA inhibition also did not differ between the experimental groups. The IC50 values of malonyl-CoA for CPT 1 were calculated as 33.2 ± 3.7, 30.9 ± 0.4, and 27.4 ± 2.3 nM in aerobic, ischemic, and reperfused ischemic hearts, respectively. These data demonstrate that it is unlikely that alterations in either CPT 1 activity or alterations in the sensitivity of CPT 1 to inhibition by malonyl-CoA are responsible for the high fatty acid oxidation rates seen in reperfused ischemic hearts. Since the regulation of CPT 1 by malonyl-CoA did not change in reperfused ischemic hearts, we addressed the possibility that a decrease in myocardial levels of malonyl-CoA may be responsible for the high fatty acid oxidation rates seen during reperfusion. Levels of malonyl-CoA and acetyl-CoA in the hearts are shown in Table 3. We determined the levels of these CoA ester in ventricular tissue frozen at the end of aerobic, ischemic, and reperfusion periods. At the end of ischemia, malonyl-CoA levels had dropped to 38.5% of the levels observed in aerobic hearts. By the end of reperfusion, a further dramatic drop in malonyl-CoA levels occurred, such that levels were only 1.1% of levels observed in aerobic hearts. As a result, inhibition of CPT 1 by malonyl-CoA was likely to be decreased during reperfusion in the intact heart.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab In a previous study we observed that acetyl-CoA levels were positively correlated with malonyl-CoA levels in the aerobic heart(21Saddik M. Gamble J. Witters L.A. Lopaschuk G.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25836-25845Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Table 3, a significant decrease in acetyl-CoA levels was seen in hearts frozen at the end of ischemia, which may have accounted for the decrease in malonyl-CoA levels seen in these hearts. However, no further decrease in acetyl-CoA levels was observed at the end of reperfusion, even though a further dramatic decrease in malonyl-CoA occurred. To explore the potential explanations for the dramatic decrease in malonyl-CoA levels in reperfused ischemic hearts, the activity and relative content of ACC were determined in extracts obtained from frozen ventricular tissue obtained from these hearts.

https://openalex.org/W2030793757,"CD22 is a membrane immunoglobulin (mIg)-associated protein of B cells. CD22 is tyrosine-phosphorylated when mIg is ligated. Tyrosine-phosphorylated CD22 binds and activates SHP, a protein tyrosine phosphatase known to negatively regulate signaling through mIg. Ligation of CD22 to prevent its coaggregation with mIg lowers the threshold at which mIg activates the B cell by a factor of 100. In secondary lymphoid organs, CD22 may be sequestered away from mIg through interactions with counterreceptors on T cells. Thus, CD22 is a molecular switch for SHP that may bias mIg signaling to anatomic sites rich in T cells."

https://openalex.org/W2021289405,The Rac guanosine 5'-triphosphate (GTP)-binding proteins regulate oxidant production by phagocytic leukocytes. Two Ste20-related p21-activated kinases (PAKs) were identified as targets of Rac in human neutrophils. Activity of the approximately 65- and approximately 68-kilodalton PAKs was rapidly stimulated by chemoattractants acting through pertussis toxin-sensitive heterotrimeric GTP-binding proteins (G proteins). Native and recombinant PAKs phosphorylated the p47phox reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase component in a Rac-GTP-dependent manner. The action of PAKs during phagocyte activation by G protein-coupled pathways may contribute to regulation of NADPH oxidase activity.

After cooling the samples on ice, proteins were precipitated with chloroform/methanol(15Wessel D. Flügge U.I. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 138: 141-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (3185) Google Scholar). The pellets were dissolved in sample preparation buffer (0.125 M Tris, pH 6.8, 1% SDS, 5% glycerol, 10% 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.01% bromphenol blue) for SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) or in lysis buffer (9.5 M urea, 2% Nonidet P-40, 2% ampholytes, pH 3-10, 10% 2-mercaptoethanol) for two-dimensional gels (16O'Farrell P.H.

Alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibody (Amersham Corp.) was used, and blots were developed after a quick rinse in high pH buffer (100 mM Tris, pH 9.5, 100 mM NaCl, 50 mM MgCl2), first with Lumiphos substrate (Boehringer Mannheim, Indianapolis, IN) and then in 0.165 mg/ml of 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolylphosphate p-toluidine salt and 0.33 mg/ml of nitro blue tetrazolium chloride (Life Technologies, Inc.) diluted in the pH 9.5 buffer. Hyperfilm ECL (Amersham Corp.) exposures of the Lumiphos images and the stained blots were scanned using a Microscan 2000 image analysis system (Technology Resources, Inc., Knoxville, TN). Internal standards of chick brain ADF were included on all one-dimensional immunoblots. Chick skin fibroblasts, prepared by trypsin dissociation of skin from the dorsal side of 8-day embryos, were grown in 10-cm culture dishes in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma) containing 10% fetal bovine serum. When 70% confluent, cells were transferred to a low phosphate medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without phosphate) (Sigma) containing 10% fetal bovine serum that had been exhaustively dialyzed against 0.15 M NaCl. [32P]Orthophosphate (5 Ci/mmol; 100 εCi/ml culture medium) was added for 12 h. The cells were washed with 3 × 10 ml of 4°C phosphate-buffered saline, and then harvested in extraction buffer as described above. The cell lysate was added to a homogenate prepared from 6 g of 10-11-day chick embryo brain in 10 ml of the same buffer, and the mixture was further homogenized with five to six more strokes of a Teflon-glass homogenizer. The 32P-labeled pool of pADF was then purified as described under “Results.” For endopeptidase digestion, approximately 60 εg of precipitated ADF or pADF were solubilized in 20 εl of 8 M urea, 20 mM Tris-Cl buffer, pH 9.0. The volume was adjusted to 100 εl with 20 mM Tris-Cl, pH 9.0. Endopeptidase Lys-C (Wako Bioproducts, Richmond, VA) was added at an enzyme/substrate molar ratio of 1:50, and the mixture was incubated at 30°C for 8 h. Aliquots were removed periodically to evaluate the progress of digestion by SDS-PAGE. The digested samples were either immediately fractionated or frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80°C for later use. For endopeptidase Asp-N digestion of the N-terminal fragment from Lys-C digestion, the appropriate fractions were lyophilized and resolubilized in 10 εl of 8 M urea, 50 mM sodium phosphate, pH 8.0. The volume was adjusted to 60 εl with 50 mM sodium phosphate, pH 8.0. Endopeptidase Asp-N (Boehringer Mannheim) was added at an enzyme/substrate weight ratio of 1:20. The mixture was incubated for 8 h at 36°C and then lyophilized. Peptides from Lys-C digests of ADF or [32P]pADF were fractionated by HPLC on a column of Microsorb-MV C18, 5 εm, 300-Å pore (5.6 mm × 25 cm) (Rainin Inst., Woburn, MA) eluted with a linear step gradient (2.0-37.5% B, 60 min; 37.5-75% B, 30 min; 75-90% B, 15 min; solvent A, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid; solvent B 80% acetonitrile, 0.1% TFA) (Millipore, Waters Chromatography, Milford, MA). The flow rate was 0.5 ml/min, and the column effluent was monitored at 220 nm. Fractions (0.25 ml) were collected every 30 s, and Cerenkov radiation was measured. HPLC electrospray mass spectrometry and tandem mass spectrometry were performed at the Beckman Institute, City of Hope, Duarte, CA on a TSQ-700 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (Finnigan-MAT, San Jose, California), equipped with an electrospray ion source operating at atmospheric pressure. Mass spectra were recorded in the positive ion mode. The solvent delivery system, fused silica capillary columns, and UV detection system have been described in detail(20Swiderik K.M. Lee T.D. Shively J.E. Methods Enzymol. 1995; (in press)Google Scholar). A 656-base pair EcoRI/AvrII fragment containing the full ADF cDNA was excised from pUC 19 (21Adams M.E. Minamide L.S. Duester G. Bamburg J.R. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 7414-7420Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) and cloned into the EcoRI-XbaI sites of M13mp18. Oligonucleotide-directed point mutagenesis (22Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4560) Google Scholar) was used to mutate the Ser24 and Thr25 codons to Ala using the mutagenic primers 5’-CCTCAGGCGCTGCGCATTTCCG-3’, 5’-CCTCAGGCGTTGCGCCATTT-3’, 5’-CCTCAGGCGCAGAGCATTTCCG-3’ giving the ADF(A24,25), ADF(A24), and ADF(A25) mutant cDNAs, respectively. NcoI/HindIII fragments encoding ADF(A24,25), ADF(A24), or ADF(A25) were subcloned into the modified pBR 322 bacterial expression vector (pET) as described previously(21Adams M.E. Minamide L.S. Duester G. Bamburg J.R. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 7414-7420Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 23Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (6005) Google Scholar). BamHI/AvrII fragments (560 base pairs) from pET containing the full ADF or ADF(A24,25) cDNAs were cloned into the multi-cloning site of the eukaryotic expression vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA), giving the vectors pcDNA3ADF and pcDNA3ADF(A24,25). Site-directed mutagenesis was performed on pcDNA3ADF using the Transformer Mutagenesis Kit (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA)(24Deng W.P. Nickoloff J.A. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 200: 81-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar). Three mutagenic primers were used, encoding mutations in the Ser3 codon of the ADF cDNA (Ser → Ala, 5’-CTTGTACTCCAGCTGCCATGGATC-3’; Ser → Glu, 5’-CGGCAACTTGTACTCCTTCTGCCATGGATCCGAGC-3’; Ser deletion, 5’-CGGCAACTTGTACTCCTGCCATGGATCCGAGC-3’). A selection primer, eliminating a unique pcDNA3 HindIII restriction site, was also synthesized (5’-GGTACCAAGCAAGGGTCTCCC-3’). All mutant cDNAs were confirmed by DNA sequencing (Sequenase Version 2.0 DNA Sequencing Kit, U. S. Biochemical Corp., Cleveland, OH). All oligonucleotides were synthesized by Macromolecular Resources, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, CO. Bacterial expression of the ADF(A24,25) and ADF(E3) mutants was performed as described previously for the expression of ADF (21Adams M.E. Minamide L.S. Duester G. Bamburg J.R. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 7414-7420Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The postinduction bacterial pellets were resuspended in 50 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 2.0 mM EGTA, 2.4 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 εl/ml protease inhibition mixture(11Morgan T.E. Lockerbie R.O. Minamide L.S. Browning M.D. Bamburg J.R. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 623-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), and then lysed in 2.0 mg/ml lysozyme on ice for 15 min, followed by addition of 15 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM MnCl2, and 8 εg/ml DNase I. After incubation at room temperature for 10 min, 20 mM DTT and 10 εl/ml protease inhibition mixture were added. After centrifugation at 60,000 × gav for 30 min at 4°C, the supernatant was passed through a column of DEAE-cellulose (DE-52; Whatman), and the flow-through was applied to a column of Green A-agarose (Amicon Corp., Danvers, MA). The ADF was eluted with 175 mM NaCl in 10 mM Tris, pH 7.6, 5 mM DTT, concentrated on a Centricon-10 (Amicon Corp.), frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80°C. HeLa cells were cultured in minimal essential medium (Sigma) containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 εg/ml streptomycin. Cells at 30-50% confluency on 10-cm dishes were transfected by the calcium phosphate method (25Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 16.33-16.36Google Scholar) with 10 εg of pcDNA3 vector containing ADF cDNA or one of the site-directed mutants of ADF cDNA. The precipitate was removed after 12 h by washing 3 times with phosphate-buffered saline, and extracts of cells were prepared for SDS-PAGE 48 h after transfection as described above. We previously demonstrated that the phosphorylated form of ADF, partially purified from chick embryo brain, had no actin depolymerizing activity(11Morgan T.E. Lockerbie R.O. Minamide L.S. Browning M.D. Bamburg J.R. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 623-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Partially purified preparations of pADF contain proteases that degrade ADF when incubated at 37°C(11Morgan T.E. Lockerbie R.O. Minamide L.S. Browning M.D. Bamburg J.R. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 623-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). While the SDS-denatured pADF could be dephosphorylated by alkaline phosphatase, we did not demonstrate reactivation. We found that brain ADF, denatured by boiling in 1% SDS, could be completely reactivated after removal of SDS and renaturation. We used these conditions to renature ADF produced from denatured pADF following alkaline phosphatase treatment. Complete ADF activity was regained after dephosphorylation, whereas no ADF activity was found in the pADF control (Fig. 1). Electrophoresis of both samples confirmed that dephosphorylation occurred in the alkaline phosphatase-treated sample, as previously reported(11Morgan T.E. Lockerbie R.O. Minamide L.S. Browning M.D. Bamburg J.R. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 623-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The combined homogenate from the 32P-labeled chick skin fibroblasts and chick embryo brain was centrifuged at 100,000 × g. pADF was partially purified from the supernatant by chromatography on DEAE-cellulose, Green A-agarose, and hydroxylapatite (HAP). SDS-PAGE of HAP fractions (Fig. 2A) and the corresponding autoradiograph (Fig. 2B) demonstrate that [32P]pADF eluted in the position expected for pADF, as previously identified by immunoblotting(11Morgan T.E. Lockerbie R.O. Minamide L.S. Browning M.D. Bamburg J.R. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 623-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The pADF-containing fractions were boiled in 0.1% SDS, combined, and concentrated to less than 100 εl in a Centricon-10 microconcentrator. The volume was adjusted to 1 ml with 0.1 M Tris-Cl, pH 7.6, and the protein was reduced, and alkylated with 4-vinylpyridine(26Ozols J. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 182: 587-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Proteins were precipitated (15Wessel D. Flügge U.I. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 138: 141-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (3185) Google Scholar) and redissolved in sample preparation buffer for separation on a preparative SDS-PAGE mini-slab gel (0.5 mm). After electrophoresis, proteins were visualized by KCl precipitation(27Nelles L.P. Bamburg J.R. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 73: 522-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), and the pADF band was excised from the gel. pADF was electroeluted into a Centricon-10 chamber in 0.5 × SDS-PAGE running buffer (18Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207478) Google Scholar) and concentrated to about 0.1 ml by centrifugation. An aliquot of this material was rerun on SDS-PAGE to check for homogeneity (Fig. 2C). Electroeluted ADF and pADF were precipitated(15Wessel D. Flügge U.I. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 138: 141-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (3185) Google Scholar), dissolved in buffer, and digested with endopeptidase Lys-C. The resulting peptides were separated by HPLC and Cerenkov radioactivity in each fraction determined (Fig. 3). A single phosphopeptide, unique to the pADF digest, was identified (Fig. 3, arrow). This single peptide contained about 60% of the total radioactivity loaded onto the column, the remainder being accounted for in the unbound fraction and a few small peaks visible in Fig. 3. No sequence could be obtained by direct sequence analysis of the single phosphopeptide, whereas neighboring peptides from the same digest were readily sequenced. This suggested that the labeled peptide contained a blocked N terminus and might arise from the N terminus of ADF, a peptide containing only a single Ser residue. The N-terminal Lys-C peptide from pADF contains only a single Ser and has the sequence Ac-ABGVQVADEVJRIFYDMK, where B is phosphoserine, and J is pyridylethylcysteine. This sequence suggests that the N-terminal Met is removed and that the penultimate Ala is acetylated. This sequence was confirmed by mass spectrometric analysis as follows. The isolated Lys-C phosphopeptide (containing some of the contaminating trailing peak) was digested with Asp-N and rerun on HPLC. The undigested contaminating peptide and two major peptide fragments of the phosphopeptide were obtained (Fig. 4). The parent ion masses of the two major Asp-N peptides are 753.6 and 1150.3, as determined by electrospray mass spectrometric analysis. These correspond to the masses expected for peptides derived from the sequence shown above: A, Ac-ABGVQVA (mass 753); B, DEVJRIFY (mass 1150). In addition, the C-terminal peptide (C) DMK was identified by its mass of 393. Analysis of the N-terminal peptide by tandem mass spectrometry produced the spectrum in Fig. 5A. The parent ion (P) at m/z 753 matches the value predicted for that of the N-terminal peptide. The predicted fragment ions, type b and y are shown in Fig. 5C, and those ions observed are labeled in Fig. 5A. Fragment ions b3 through b6 yield the C-terminal sequence -VQVA, confirming the origin of the peptide. The b3 ion m/z corresponds to the N-terminal fragment Ac-ABG-. Also apparent in the spectrum are ion species representing the loss of phosphate as phosphoric acid (98 mass units) due to collision. The N-terminal peptide (A) in Fig. 4 was isolated by HPLC and treated with alkaline phosphatase. Analysis of the resulting peptide by tandem mass spectrometry yielded the spectrum in Fig. 5B. The parent ion at m/z 673 is that of the dephosphorylated peptide (−80 mass units). Fragment ions b3 through b6 yield an identical C-terminal sequence but are decreased by 80 mass units due to the loss of phosphate. Additionally, there are no peaks representing the loss of phosphoric acid due to collision. The b3 fragment (AcASG-) contains only one phosphorylatable residue, Ser, and therefore, the phosphorylation site on pADF is Ser2 (Ser3 in the encoded protein).Figure 5:Identification of the phosphorylation site by tandem mass spectrometry. A, N-terminal Asp-N peptide from pADF. B, same peptide after alkaline phosphatase treatment. C, peptide fragments expected from the N-terminal end (b) and C-terminal end (y) of the peptide. Those that are readily identified in the mass spectra are labeled in A and B. p, parent ion. Amino acid B is phosphoserine (serine in the dephosphorylated peptide).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Extracts from HeLa cells, transiently transfected with pcDNA3 carrying wild-type ADF, ADF(A24,25), ADF(A3), ADF(E3), or ADF(Δ3) expressed the transfected forms of ADF as shown on two-dimensional immunoblots (Fig. 6). Endogenous HeLa cell ADF only weakly cross-reacts with the chick ADF antiserum (Fig. 6, 1a), eliminating the need to epitope tag the exogenously expressed protein. Two-dimensional immunoblots of extracts from cells expressing wild-type ADF (Fig. 6, 2a) or the ADF(A24,25) mutant (Fig. 6, 1b) typically show two species, the more acidic one arising from the in vivo phosphorylation of ADF. Extracts of cells transfected with ADF(A3) (Fig. 6, 2b), ADF(E3) (Fig. 6, 3a), or ADF(Δ3) (Fig. 6, 3b) do not contain the phosphorylated forms of these proteins, confirming that Ser3 of the encoded protein is the regulatory site for phosphorylation in vivo. Bacterially expressed forms of wild-type ADF, ADF(A24), ADF(A25), and ADF(E3) were purified from supernatants of bacterial lysates. Proteins were homogeneous on SDS-PAGE (not shown). Wild-type ADF, ADF(A24) and ADF(A25) were identical to brain ADF in depolymerizing F-actin. The ADF(E3) mutant, a structural homolog of the phosphorylated ADF, had F-actin depolymerizing activity that was about 10% of the wild-type (Fig. 7). Regulation of proteins by phosphorylation is a well established mechanism for controlling biological activity (for review, see (28Walsh D.A. Newsholme P. Cawley K.C. van Patten S.M. Angelos K.L. Physiol. Rev. 1991; 71: 285-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar)), nuclear translocation (for review, see (29Silver P.A. Cell. 1991; 64: 489-497Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar)), and protein degradation(30Nishizawa M. Okazaki K. Furuno N. Watanabe N. Sagata N. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2433-2446Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Since ADF and cofilin contain identical nuclear translocation signal sequences(31Abe H. Endo T. Yamamoto K. Obinata T. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 7420-7425Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 32Abe H. Nagaoka R. Obinata T. Exp. Cell Res. 1993; 206: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), and both can be transported to the nucleus of cells under stress(33Nishida E. Iida K. Yonezawa N. Koyasu S. Yahara I. Sakai H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 5262-5266Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 34Ono S. Abe H. Nagaoka R. Obinata T. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1993; 14: 195-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), their phosphorylation in cells may be involved in regulating one or more of the above events. In order to demonstrate that the reversible phosphorylation of ADF controls its cellular activity, we needed to show that it can be reactivated by removal of the phosphate. Partially purified preparations of pADF contain proteases, which degrade ADF when incubated at 37°C(11Morgan T.E. Lockerbie R.O. Minamide L.S. Browning M.D. Bamburg J.R. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 623-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). However, by boiling the proteins with SDS, these proteases are permanently inactivated. ADF can be reactivated after denaturation and dephosphorylation. Regulation by phosphorylation/dephosphorylation may control the activity of ADF in cells. ADF is normally down-regulated in developing chick skeletal muscle in vivo but not in primary myocyte cultures of equivalent age in vitro. Interestingly, myotubes developing in vitro compensate for their inability to down-regulate ADF expression by converting the abundant ADF to the inactive form, pADF, which accumulates during the process of in vitro myogenesis(11Morgan T.E. Lockerbie R.O. Minamide L.S. Browning M.D. Bamburg J.R. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 623-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). ADF colocalizes with actin in the membrane ruffles of motile cells and, in developing neuronal growth cones, areas containing highly dynamic actin filaments(35Bamburg J.R. Bray D. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 2817-2825Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Rapid cycling of actin assembly/disassembly could be regulated by ADF phosphorylation. Recent studies show phosphorylation of both ADF and cofilin are altered by various signal transduction pathways that are activated by growth factors and pharmacological agents. Treatment of cultured rat primary astrocytes with dibutyryl-cAMP or the myosin light chain kinase inhibitor, ML-9, causes dramatic shape changes and reorganization of the actin filament network and increased dephosphorylation of both the regulatory light chain of myosin and ADF(36Baorto D.M. Mellado W. Shelanski M.L. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 357-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Additionally, treatment of primary cultures of dog thyroid cells with thyrotropin causes distinct morphological changes and a redistribution of the actin stress fiber network, as well as rapid dephosphorylation of both ADF and cofilin(37Saito T. Lamy F. Roger P.P. Lecocq R. Dumont J. Exp. Cell Res. 1994; 212: 49-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Since the thyrotropin effects could be mimicked by forskolin, it seems likely that the dephosphorylation of ADF is regulated in both astrocytes and thyroid cells by a cAMP-dependent process. Additionally, cofilin dephosphorylation in human platelets could be stimulated by GTPγS or by free calcium but not by activation of protein kinase C(38Davidson M.M.L. Haslam R.J. Biochem. J. 1994; 301: 41-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Again, the GTPγS effects could very well be mediated through increases in cAMP via the protein Gs. Together, this evidence suggests that ADF is a major regulator of actin filament dynamics in vivo and that the regulation of ADF by phosphorylation may provide a rapid, localized, and reversible control mechanism for regulating actin filament dynamics in areas of high filament turnover. Dephosphorylation of ADF (37Saito T. Lamy F. Roger P.P. Lecocq R. Dumont J. Exp. Cell Res. 1994; 212: 49-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) and cofilin (9Ohta Y. Nishida E. Sakai H. Miyamoto E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 16143-16148Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 37Saito T. Lamy F. Roger P.P. Lecocq R. Dumont J. Exp. Cell Res. 1994; 212: 49-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) accompanies nuclear transport in many cells placed under stress. In addition, the costimulatory signals for human T-cell activation induce the dephosphorylation of cofilin and its translocation to the nucleus of human T-cells(39Samstag Y. Eckerskorn C. Wesselborg S. Henning S. Wallich R. Meuer S.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4494-4498Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Cofilin dephosphorylation correlates with the induction of interleukin-6 responsiveness and interleukin-2 secretion. Interestingly, cofilin dephosphorylation and translocation to the nucleus occur spontaneously in autonomously proliferating T-lymphoma cells. However, dephosphorylation of ADF and cofilin, which occurs in thyroid cells in response to thyrotropin(37Saito T. Lamy F. Roger P.P. Lecocq R. Dumont J. Exp. Cell Res. 1994; 212: 49-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), is not accompanied by nuclear translocation, suggesting that dephosphorylation is not sufficient for nuclear uptake. Ser24 in both ADF and cofilin exists within a conserved CaM kinase II consensus sequence. This seemed a likely site for phosphorylation as it is situated next to a nuclear translocation sequence, conserved between ADF and cofilin, both of which have been shown to translocate to the nucleus. It was suggested that the dephosphorylation of cofilin at this site may be involved in its nuclear translocation(9Ohta Y. Nishida E. Sakai H. Miyamoto E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 16143-16148Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, ADF was not phosphorylated in vitro to any significant extent with several common kinases including CaM kinase II, protein kinase C, protein kinase A, and myosin light chain kinase(11Morgan T.E. Lockerbie R.O. Minamide L.S. Browning M.D. Bamburg J.R. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 623-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The studies reported here in which the ADF(A24,25) mutant is expressed and phosphorylated in HeLa cells demonstrates convincingly that Ser24 is not the regulatory site. We have identified the single regulatory phosphorylation site within the chick brain ADF primary sequence as Ser3 of the encoded protein. This is a conserved residue within the ADF/cofilin family, present in mammals, birds, amphibians, and insects (Fig. 8). Echinoderms (40Takagi T. Konishi K. Mabuchi I. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 3097-3102Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and yeast (6Moon A.L. Janmey P. Louie K.A. Drubin D. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 421-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar) have an extra amino acid between this Ser and the initiating Met, while plants (41Kim S.-R. Kim Y. An G. Plant Mol. Biol. 1993; 21: 39-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) have four extra amino acids, two of which are Ser. In the amoeba protein, actophorin(42Quirk S. Maciver S.K. Ampe C. Doberstein S.K. Kaiser D.A. VanDamme J. Vandekerckhove J.S. Pollard T.D. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 8525-8533Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), this Ser is adjacent to the initiating Met. In mammals, birds, and amphibians, the only classes so far in which phosphorylation of ADF/cofilin proteins have been demonstrated, a consensus sequence for the phosphorylation site appears to be N-ASGVXVXD. Such a phosphorylation consensus sequence has not been reported(43Pearson R.B. Kemp B.E. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 200: 62-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (873) Google Scholar, 44Kennelly P.J. Krebs E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15555-15558Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although autophosphorylation of the N-terminal penultimate Ser residue in c-mos has been characterized, this Ser is surrounded by two Pro residues, which are likely to be involved in determining the phosphorylation specificity of this meiotic cell cycle regulatory protein(30Nishizawa M. Okazaki K. Furuno N. Watanabe N. Sagata N. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2433-2446Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The small GTP-binding protein Rac1 is a key regulator of the rapid actin reorganization accompanying membrane ruffling during the early phases of growth factor-induced signal transduction (for review, see (45Hall A. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 31-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (768) Google Scholar)). ADF is co-localized with actin in regions where Rac1 induces dramatic alterations in actin dynamics. Overexpression of a constitutively active mutant of Rac1 in Drosophila neurons inhibits nerve growth and increases the rhodamine-phalloidin staining of growth cones(46Luo L. Liao Y.J. Jan L.Y. Jan Y.N. Genes & Dev. 1994; 8: 1787-1802Crossref PubMed Scopus (819) Google Scholar). This finding suggests that growth inhibition may arise from a decrease in F-actin turnover. Conversely, overexpression of a dominant negative form of Rac1 also led to inhibition of nerve growth, but in this case growth cones did not stain with rhodamine phalloidin, suggesting that they contained little or no F-actin(46Luo L. Liao Y.J. Jan L.Y. Jan Y.N. Genes & Dev. 1994; 8: 1787-1802Crossref PubMed Scopus (819) Google Scholar). One downstream effector of Rac1 is the serine/threonine kinase, p65PAK(47Manser E. Leung T. Salihuddin H. Zhao Z. Lim L. Nature. 1994; 367: 40-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (1305) Google Scholar), which we believe could be the kinase that is directly or indirectly responsible for the phosphorylation of ADF. Interestingly, Drosophila ADF has the phosphorylation consensus sequence found in ADF/cofilin from mammals, birds, and amphibians (Fig. 8). These results are at least consistent with a model in which ADF plays a prominent role in growth cone actin dynamics. Although the major actin binding regions of proteins in the ADF/cofilin family have been identified as domains in the C-terminal half of the protein(48Yonezawa N. Nishida E. Ohba M. Seki M. Kumagai H. Sakai H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 183: 235-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 49Yonezawa N. Homma Y. Yahara I. Sakai H. Nishida E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17218-17221Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), recent evidence suggests that amino acids near the N terminus also play a role.2 2T. Obinata, personal communication. Presented as abstract (Kusano, K., Abe, H., and Obinata, T. (1993) Cell Struct. Funct.18, 639). Introduction of a phosphate group nearby an actin binding domain could directly affect the interactions, but until the structure of the entire molecule is resolved, we can only speculate on how the phosphorylation of the penultimate serine brings about the changes in the actin binding properties of ADF. It is interesting to note, however, that extensions to the N terminus (three amino acids in recombinant ADF (21Adams M.E. Minamide L.S. Duester G. Bamburg J.R. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 7414-7420Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) or the addition of a 26-kDa glutathione S-transferase fusion protein)3 3H. Abe, T. Obinata, L. S. Minamide, and J. R. Bamburg, manuscript in preparation. do not inhibit the actin depolymerizing or pH-sensitive F-actin binding of ADF. The identification of the regulatory phosphorylation site on ADF and the development of site-directed mutants will enable further investigation into the cellular role of this regulation. We are currently isolating stable, clonal populations of various cell lines, which have been transfected with vectors expressing the ADF(A3) and ADF(E3) mutants and will examine the effects of these mutations on actin-based functions including cell motility, neurite outgrowth, and nuclear rod formation.

https://openalex.org/W1969689864,"The concomitant tyrosine phosphorylation of the focal adhesion protein, paxillin, and the tyrosine kinase, focal adhesion kinase (FAK), in response to multiple stimuli including integrin-mediated cell adhesion suggests that paxillin phosphorylation is closely coupled to FAK activity. In the present study, we have identified a specific tyrosine residue within paxillin, tyrosine 118 (Tyr-118), that represents the principle site of phosphorylation by FAK in vitro. The identification of this site as a target for FAK phosphorylation was accomplished by immunoprecipitating FAK and performing in vitro kinase assays, using as substrate either glutathione S-transferase (GST)-paxillin fusion proteins containing truncations in paxillin sequence or fusion proteins with phenylalanine substitutions for tyrosine residues. GST-paxillin containing a phenylalanine substitution at Tyr-118 (Y118F) was not phosphorylated by FAK immunoprecipitates; however, this mutant was shown to bind FAK equally as well as the wild type fusion protein. As a first step toward assessing the function of paxillin phosphorylation on Tyr-118, a Y118F paxillin cDNA construct was transiently transfected into NIH 3T3 cells. Similar to wild type paxillin, mutated paxillin localized to focal adhesions, indicating that the phosphorylation of paxillin on Tyr-118 is not essential for the recruitment of paxillin to sites of cell adhesion. The concomitant tyrosine phosphorylation of the focal adhesion protein, paxillin, and the tyrosine kinase, focal adhesion kinase (FAK), in response to multiple stimuli including integrin-mediated cell adhesion suggests that paxillin phosphorylation is closely coupled to FAK activity. In the present study, we have identified a specific tyrosine residue within paxillin, tyrosine 118 (Tyr-118), that represents the principle site of phosphorylation by FAK in vitro. The identification of this site as a target for FAK phosphorylation was accomplished by immunoprecipitating FAK and performing in vitro kinase assays, using as substrate either glutathione S-transferase (GST)-paxillin fusion proteins containing truncations in paxillin sequence or fusion proteins with phenylalanine substitutions for tyrosine residues. GST-paxillin containing a phenylalanine substitution at Tyr-118 (Y118F) was not phosphorylated by FAK immunoprecipitates; however, this mutant was shown to bind FAK equally as well as the wild type fusion protein. As a first step toward assessing the function of paxillin phosphorylation on Tyr-118, a Y118F paxillin cDNA construct was transiently transfected into NIH 3T3 cells. Similar to wild type paxillin, mutated paxillin localized to focal adhesions, indicating that the phosphorylation of paxillin on Tyr-118 is not essential for the recruitment of paxillin to sites of cell adhesion. Cell adhesion to an extracellular matrix plays a fundamental role in regulating cellular behaviors such as migration, proliferation, and differentiation(1Hynes R.O. Lander A.D. Cell. 1992; 68: 303-322Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (762) Google Scholar, 2Damsky C.H. Werb Z. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1992; 4: 772-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). The organization of cell adhesion sites is directed by a family of transmembrane receptors known as integrins(3Hynes R.O. Cell. 1992; 69: 11-25Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9014) Google Scholar). The binding of integrins to extracellular matrix ligands catalyzes the recruitment of multiple cytoskeletal associated proteins to the cytoplasmic face of cell attachment sites (focal adhesions) and thereby organizes the actin cytoskeleton(4Burridge K. Fath K. Kelly T. Nuckolls G. Turner C. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1988; 4: 487-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (1701) Google Scholar, 5Turner C.E. Burridge K. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1991; 3: 849-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). The molecular mechanisms by which cell adhesion triggers various cellular events have not yet been defined. However, evidence is emerging that implicates the tyrosine phosphorylation of certain focal adhesion proteins in at least one aspect of integrin-meditated signaling, that of cytoskeleton reorganization. In particular, the binding of integrins to extracellular matrix ligands results in an increase in tyrosine-phosphorylated forms of several focal adhesion proteins(6Schaller M.D. Parsons J.T.

The tyrosine phosphorylation of these two proteins has been suggested to be involved in both the formation of focal adhesions and the assembly of actin stress fibers(8Burridge K. Turner C.E.

The coordinate phosphorylation of paxillin and FAK on tyrosine residues has also been observed in other systems. Cells transformed by Rous sarcoma virus (14Glenney J.R. Zokas L. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 2401-2408Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar) and tissues undergoing embryogenesis (15Turner C.E. J.

Additionally, tyrosine-phosphorylated paxillin and FAK have been detected in cultured cells that have been treated with a variety of stimuli, including lysophosphatidic acid (17Seufferlein T.

Chem. 1993; 268: 22060-22065Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The multiple observations of concomitant phosphorylation of FAK and paxillin suggest that tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin may be a direct consequence of FAK activity. Additional support for this hypothesis is provided by the finding that purified paxillin can be phosphorylated in vitro by a FAK immunoprecipitate(16Turner C.E. Schaller M.D. Parsons J.T. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 105: 637-645Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The paxillin cDNA has been recently cloned(23Salgia R. Li J-L. Lo S.H. Brunkhorst B. Kansas G.S. Sobhany E.S. Sun Y. Pisick E. Hallek M.

Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 1583-1591Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and a region of the paxillin molecule has been identified that supports the binding of both vinculin and FAK(24Turner C.E. Miller J.T. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 1583-1591Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). An analysis of the paxillin amino acid sequence reveals the presence of additional domains, which are thought to function in protein-protein interactions. Among these domains are a proline-rich, putative SH3 binding motif(25Musacchio A. Wilmanns M. Saraste M. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1994; 61: 283-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 26Pawson T. Gish G.D. Cell. 1992; 71: 359-362Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar, 27Koch C.A. Anderson D. Moran M.F. Ellis C. Pawson T. Science. 1991; 252: 668-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (1438) Google Scholar), four LIM domains (28Schmeichel K.L. Beckerle M.C. Cell. 1994; 79: 211-219Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar), and multiple tyrosine residues, which are likely to represent sites of phosphorylation, given that these residues lie within good consensus sequences for binding to proteins that contain SH2 domains (29Songyang Z. Shoelson S.E. Chaudhuri M. Gish G. Pawson T. Haser W.G. King F. Roberts T. Ratnofsky S. Lechleider R.J. Neel B.G. Birge R.B. Fajardo J.E. Chou M.M. Hanafusa H. Schaffhausen B. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1993; 72: 767-778Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2384) Google Scholar). In the present study, we have determined that one of the tyrosine residues that potentially comprises part of an SH2 binding domain for the adapter protein, Crk, is a primary site of paxillin phosphorylation by FAK in vitro. Selected regions of paxillin cDNA were amplified from paxillin clone 10 (24Turner C.E. Miller J.T. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 1583-1591Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using oligonucleotides containing 5’-BamHI or 3’-EcoRI restriction sites. The PCR products were subcloned into BamHI/EcoRI-digested pGEX-2T (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). Verification that paxillin was subcloned into pGEX-2T in the correct reading frame was provided by dideoxy chain termination sequencing (Sequenase 2, U. S. Biochemical Corp.). The GST-paxillin fusion proteins were expressed and purified using glutathione (GSH)-Sepharose as described elsewhere(30Smith D.B. Johnson K.S. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 67: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (5047) Google Scholar). For use in kinase assays, fusion proteins were eluted from GSH-Sepharose beads with 20 mM GSH in 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0), then dialyzed overnight into kinase buffer (10 mM HEPES, 3 mM MnCl2, pH 7.3). 14-16-day-old embryonic chicken gizzards (a source of smooth muscle focal adhesion proteins) were homogenized in 10 volumes of buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.1% deoxycholate, 10 εg/ml leupeptin, and 50 εM sodium orthovanadate (lysis buffer). Lysates were centrifuged at 100,000 × g to remove insoluble material. FAK was immunoprecipitated by incubating the lysates for 90 min at 4°C with anti-FAK monoclonal antibody 2A7 (gift from Dr. J. T. Parsons, University of Virginia), followed by the addition of rabbit, anti-mouse IgG complexed to protein A-Sepharose. The immune complexes were pelleted, washed extensively with lysis buffer, washed once with 10 mM HEPES, 3 mM MnCl2, pH 7.3 (kinase buffer), then resuspended into 20 εl of kinase buffer. Approximately 5-20 εg of GST-paxillin fusion protein (previously dialyzed into kinase buffer) were added to the FAK immunoprecipitate with 10 εCi of [γ-32P]ATP. In some kinase assays, 100 εM tyrphostin (Life Technologies, Inc.) was also added. Following a 20-min incubation at room temperature, kinase reactions were terminated by boiling the samples in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Samples were resolved on 10% acrylamide gels by SDS-PAGE (31Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207231) Google Scholar) and then visualized by autoradiography. Protein amounts were determined by using a Bio-Rad protein assay kit, as well as by Coomassie staining of SDS-PAGE gels. To perform kinase assays with native paxillin, anti-paxillin monoclonal antibody 165 (32Turner C.E. Glenney J.R. Burridge K. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 1059-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar) and anti-FAK monoclonal antibody 2A7 were added simultaneously to gizzard lysates. Following a 90-min incubation at 4°C, paxillin and FAK were coprecipitated by the addition of rabbit anti-mouse saturated protein A-Sepharose. The precipitates were washed and then resuspended in kinase buffer containing 10 εCi of [γ-32P]ATP. As described above, kinase reactions proceeded for 20 min at room temperature, and the phosphorylated samples were resolved by electrophoresis. Phenylalanine substitutions for tyrosine residues were introduced into the paxillin sequence using a PCR method described by Landt et al.(33Landt D. Grunert H. Hahn U. Gene (Amst.). 1990; 96: 125-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar). Mutated paxillin cDNA was subcloned into pGEX-2T as described above. The correct sequence of the mutated GST-paxillin fusion protein was verified by sequencing. GST, GST-paxillin 54-313, and GST-paxillin 54-313/Y118F, each coupled to GSH-Sepharose beads(30Smith D.B. Johnson K.S. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 67: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (5047) Google Scholar), were incubated with embryonic chicken gizzard lysates for 90 min at 4°C. Samples were pelleted and washed extensively with lysis buffer. Samples were resolved by electrophoresis on 10% acrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose using standard procedures(34Towbin H. Staehlin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44924) Google Scholar). FAK and FRNK, an alternately spliced FAK isoform(6Schaller M.D. Parsons J.T. Trends Cell Biol. 1993; 3: 258-262Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), were detected by incubating nitrocellulose blots with anti-FAK polyclonal antibody, BC3 (gift from Dr. Tom Parsons, University of Virginia), followed by incubation with 125I-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG. 32P-Labeled fusion proteins were eluted from dried SDS-PAGE gels, trypsinized, and subjected to two-dimensional phosphopeptide mapping according to standard methods(35van der Geer P. Luo K. Sefton B.M. Hunter T. Hardie D.G. Protein Phosphorylation: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, New York1993: 31-59Google Scholar). Phosphopeptides were separated in the first dimension by thin layer electrophoresis in pH 1.9 buffer (35van der Geer P. Luo K. Sefton B.M. Hunter T. Hardie D.G. Protein Phosphorylation: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, New York1993: 31-59Google Scholar) and then resolved by thin layer chromatography in isobutyric acid buffer(35van der Geer P. Luo K. Sefton B.M. Hunter T. Hardie D.G. Protein Phosphorylation: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, New York1993: 31-59Google Scholar). Performic acid oxidation of phosphopeptides was not performed prior to the two-dimensional analysis. Chicken paxillin cDNA encoding amino acid residues 54-559 was amplified by PCR using paxillin clone 10 (24Turner C.E. Miller J.T. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 1583-1591Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as a template. PCR primers contained 5’-BamHI and 3’-EcoRI restriction sites to permit force cloning into the BamHI/EcoRI restriction sites of the eukaryotic expression vector, pcDNA3 (Invitrogen), a plasmid which contains a cytomegalovirus promoter. In addition, residue 58 of the paxillin sequence was mutated to methionine since transcription from the pcDNA3 vector is initiated at the first methionine residue within the insert. Mutation of tyrosine 118 to phenylalanine was as described above. Transient transfections of NIH 3T3 cells, plated on coverslips, were performed using the Ca2PO4 precipitation method of Solowska et al.(36Solowska J. Guan J-L. Marcantonio E.E. Trevithick J.E. Buck C.A. Hynes R.O. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 853-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). 24 h post-transfection, the cells were fixed and processed for immunofluorescence microscopy as previously described(32Turner C.E. Glenney J.R. Burridge K. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 1059-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). Expression and localization of transfected paxillin were detected using a chicken-specific polyclonal antisera, Pax 2(24Turner C.E. Miller J.T. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 1583-1591Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were double-labeled with rhodamine-phalloidin to visualize actin-containing stress fibers. Following our initial report of the cloning of paxillin and the identification of FAK binding to a partial paxillin GST-fusion protein(24Turner C.E. Miller J.T. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 1583-1591Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we have identified, using 5’-rapid amplification of cDNA ends, an additional chicken cDNA sequence encoding 5 amino acids (MDDLD) at the amino terminus. Thus, all nomenclature used in this report is based on a full-length protein of 559 amino acids. The additional cDNA sequence (including 5’-untranslated sequence) has been deposited in GenBank. An identical 5-amino acid sequence was reported for human paxillin (23Salgia R. Li J-L. Lo S.H. Brunkhorst B. Kansas G.S. Sobhany E.S. Sun Y. Pisick E. Hallek M. Ernst T. Tantravahi R. Chen L.B. Griffin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5039-5047Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar) following submission of this manuscript. Previously, a GST-paxillin fusion protein containing paxillin sequence from amino acids 54 through 313 was shown to support the binding of FAK (24Turner C.E. Miller J.T. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 1583-1591Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (see “Materials and Methods” regarding a change in nomenclature). This same fusion protein, GST-paxillin 54-313 (Fig. 1), was used in in vitro kinase assays with FAK immunoprecipitates. Phosphorylation of the GST-paxillin fusion protein (Fig. 2A, lane3), but not GST alone (Fig. 2A, lane2), was observed, confirming that the phosphorylation of the fusion protein was specific to the paxillin domain. Phosphorylation of immunoprecipitated FAK (i.e. no fusion protein added) was also observed (Fig. 2A, lanes4 and 5). The phosphorylation of FAK most likely represents an autophosphorylation event(37Schaller M.D. Hildebrand J.D. Shannon J.D. Fox J.W. Vines R.R. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1680-1688Crossref PubMed Scopus (1117) Google Scholar). Excision of phosphorylated GST-paxillin 54-313 from SDS-PAGE gels and subsequent phosphoamino acid analyses revealed that the phosphorylation of the fusion protein was restricted to tyrosine residues (data not shown). Additionally, the phosphorylation of both paxillin and FAK was eliminated by the inclusion of a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, tyrphostin(38Gazit A. Yaish P. Gilon C. Levitzki A. J. Med. Chem. 1989; 32: 2344-2353Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar), in the assay buffer (data not shown). Tyrphostin has been previously shown to inhibit FAK activity in vitro and in vivo(39Romer L.H. McLean N. Turner C.E. Burridge K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 349-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar).Figure 2:A, phosphorylation of GST-paxillin 54-313 and truncated variants of GST-paxillin 54-313. FAK was immunoprecipitated from embryonic chicken gizzard lysates with monoclonal antibody 2A7. After washing the immunoprecipitates, fusion proteins (previously dialyzed into kinase buffer) were added along with 10 εCi of [γ-32P]ATP. Kinase reactions proceeded for 20 min at room temperature and were terminated by boiling in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Proteins were resolved by electrophoresis on 10% acrylamide gels. The following protein samples were added to the FAK immunoprecipitates: GST (lane2), GST-paxillin 54-313 (lane3), no fusion protein added (lanes4 and 5), and truncated variants of GST-paxillin 54-313 (lane1 and lanes6-12). B, summary of results from kinase assays with truncated GST-paxillin. Kinase assays performed with truncated variants of GST-paxillin 54-313 indicated that the primary site of phosphorylation lies within amino acids 114-133.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To map the site(s) of paxillin phosphorylation by FAK, a series of truncated GST-paxillin fusion proteins was synthesized and used in in vitro kinase assays with FAK immunoprecipitates (Fig. 2, A and B). The original fusion protein, GST-paxillin 54-313, contained four tyrosine residues, Tyr-76, Tyr-88, Tyr-118, and Tyr-182. In vitro kinase assays using truncated variants of this original fusion protein indicated that phosphorylation of the fusion protein by the FAK immunoprecipitate occurred within a region of the paxillin molecule spanning amino acids 114-133. This finding implicated Tyr-118 as the most likely site of phosphorylation by the FAK immunoprecipitate. To confirm that tyrosine 118 was the primary site of phosphorylation by the FAK immunoprecipitate, site-directed mutagenesis was used to alter individual tyrosine residues within the fusion protein to phenylalanine. Mutated fusion proteins were then used in in vitro kinase assays with one additional modification. All of the mutated fusion proteins contained paxillin sequence from amino acids 54-191 instead of the 54-313 fusion protein used in Fig. 1. The truncation of paxillin sequence from amino acid 313 to 191 was instituted because fusion protein 54-313 migrated to the same position as IgG heavy chain on SDS-PAGE gels. This factor made it difficult to quantify the fusion protein by Coomassie staining and thereby ensure that equivalent amounts of mutated fusion proteins were added to each kinase assay. GST-paxillin 54-191 contained all of the tyrosine residues that were present in 54-313 and, furthermore, no diminution of phosphorylation of 54-191 was observed with respect to 54-313 (Fig. 2A, lanes6 and 3, respectively). In vitro kinase assays performed with mutated fusion proteins revealed that the phosphorylation of paxillin by the FAK immunoprecipitate was eliminated by introducing a phenylalanine substitution at tyrosine 118 (Fig. 3). In contrast, no diminution in the level of phosphorylation was observed in any of the other mutated proteins, indicating that the phosphorylation of GST-paxillin by FAK occurred on a single tyrosine residue, Tyr-118. It is unlikely that the inhibition in phosphorylation of the Y118F mutant was due to a mutation-induced perturbation in the folding of the paxillin molecule because the Y118F mutant was shown by Western blot analysis to bind both FAK and FRNK, a truncated variant of FAK(6Schaller M.D. Parsons J.T. Trends Cell Biol. 1993; 3: 258-262Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), equally as well as the wild type fusion protein (Fig. 4).Figure 4:Western blot of FAK precipitated by GST-paxillin fusion proteins. GST (lane2), GST-paxillin 54-313 (lane3), and GST-paxillin 54-313 containing a phenylalanine substitution at tyrosine 118 (lane4) were incubated with embryonic chicken gizzard lysates for 90 min at 4°C. GST and GST-fusion proteins were precipitated with GSH-Sepharose, washed, and resolved by SDS-PAGE. A sample of the embryonic chicken gizzard lysate was also electrophoresed (lane1). Following electrophoresis, proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose, and both FAK and FRNK, a truncated variant of FAK(6Schaller M.D. Parsons J.T. Trends Cell Biol. 1993; 3: 258-262Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), were detected by Western blotting using anti-FAK polyclonal antisera (BC3). The position of molecular weight standards are indicated on the left.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The segment of paxillin used in the previous experiments represents approximately 50% of the paxillin sequence (the expression of full-length paxillin as a GST-fusion protein resulted in an insoluble product). Because a significant portion of the paxillin sequence was excluded from the fusion proteins used in our assays, it was important to determine if the phosphorylation of the fusion protein by the FAK immunoprecipitate reflected the in vitro phosphorylation of native paxillin by FAK. To address this question, both GST-paxillin 54-313 and native paxillin were phosphorylated in vitro by the FAK immunoprecipitate. The phosphorylated proteins were excised from SDS-PAGE gels, trypsinized, and subjected to two-dimensional phosphopeptide analysis. As shown in Fig. 5, multiple radiolabeled spots were observed in the maps of both native paxillin and GST-paxillin fusion protein. Given that previous data (Fig. 2 and 3) suggested that phosphorylation occurred at a single site (Tyr-118), it is likely that multiple spots, at least in the case of the fusion protein, resulted from incomplete tryptic digests and/or differences in the oxidation state of a single phosphopeptide. A comparison of the two phosphopeptide maps revealed that the patterns of spots were superimposable, confirming that the phosphorylation of native paxillin occurred at essentially the same site(s) as the fusion protein. Variation in the relative intensities of individual phosphopeptides are likely due to the differential accessibility of trypsin sites in the native paxillin versus the GST-paxillin fusion protein. Alternatively, these differences may reflect the phosphorylation of paxillin at a second site, which was labeled more efficiently in the native molecule. The phosphopeptide analysis yielded two important findings. First, phosphopeptide 2 represented one of the most intensely labeled phosphopeptides in both maps, implicating the same tyrosine residue, Tyr-118, as a principle site of phosphorylation in both native paxillin and the GST-paxillin fusion protein. Second, no novel phosphopeptides were noted in the map of native paxillin as compared with the fusion protein, suggesting that all of the primary sites of paxillin phosphorylation by the FAK immunoprecipitate were present within fusion protein 54-313. To further consider the possibility that tyrosine residues not included in GST-paxillin 54-313 might be substrates for phosphorylation by FAK, we performed in vitro kinase assays with several additional fusion proteins: GST-paxillin 11-79 (proline-rich region), GST-paxillin 323-383 (LIM 1), GST-paxillin 382-445 (LIM 2), GST-paxillin 439-496 (LIM 3), and GST-paxillin 501-559 (LIM 4). No significant phosphorylation of any of these fusion proteins by FAK immunoprecipitates was observed (data not shown), supporting our hypothesis that Tyr-118 is the primary site of phosphorylation by FAK invitro. While this manuscript was under review, the identification of Tyr-118 as a substrate for phosphorylation by FAK was corroborated by a report indicating that Tyr-118 of paxillin is phosphorylated in cultured cells that overexpress FAK(40Schaller M.D. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2635-2645Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). In this same report, however, Tyr-31 was also implicated as a potential phosphorylation site. In contrast with this finding, we have not detected any phosphorylation of paxillin on Tyr-31 under the conditions used in our in vitro kinase assays. In view of the previous observation that focal adhesion formation is correlated with the tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin and FAK(8Burridge K. Turner C.E. Romer L.H. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 893-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (1182) Google Scholar), we were interested in determining if the phosphorylation of paxillin on tyrosine 118 was necessary for the localization of paxillin to focal adhesions. Consequently, paxillin cDNA and paxillin cDNA containing a phenylalanine substitution at tyrosine 118 were transfected into NIH 3T3 cells (Fig. 6). These cDNA constructs contained chicken paxillin sequence coding for amino acids 54-559. Similar to nonmutated paxillin (panelA), the Y118F mutant paxillin was detected in focal adhesions by the chicken-specific antibody (panelC), indicating that phosphorylation at tyrosine 118 was not required for the recruitment of paxillin to adhesion sites. It is also noteworthy that the proline-rich, putative SH3 binding domain of paxillin (amino acids 46-55) does not appear to be necessary for localization, since the amino acids coding for this domain were not contained within the transfected cDNA constructs. This is of interest because previous studies have shown an interaction between paxillin and the SH3 domain of Src(41Weng Z. Taylor J.A. Turner C.E. Brugge J.S. Seidel-Dugan C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14956-14963Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a tyrosine kinase that has been identified in focal adhesions(42Rohrschneider L.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 3514-3518Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Paxillin is a multi-domain protein containing binding sites for several focal adhesion proteins. It is therefore likely that the transfected paxillin constructs are recruited to focal adhesions through associations with vinculin and/or FAK or via interactions involving the paxillin LIM domains. Clearly, the phosphorylation of paxillin on Tyr-118 is not essential for the localization of paxillin to pre-existing focal adhesion sites; however, the possible requirement for phosphorylation of Tyr-118 in the initial assembly of focal adhesions remains to be determined, given that endogenous paxillin is present in NIH 3T3 cells. Another potential function of paxillin phosphorylation on Tyr-118 may involve the recruitment of other signaling molecules to focal adhesion sites. Phosphotyrosine residues typically serve to provide docking sites for proteins containing SH2 domains and thereby facilitate the formation of signaling complexes. It has been established that the three amino acids immediately following a phosphotyrosine residue confer a specificity for binding to particular SH2 domains(29Songyang Z. Shoelson S.E. Chaudhuri M. Gish G. Pawson T. Haser W.G. King F. Roberts T. Ratnofsky S. Lechleider R.J. Neel B.G. Birge R.B. Fajardo J.E. Chou M.M. Hanafusa H. Schaffhausen B. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1993; 72: 767-778Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2384) Google Scholar). An examination of the amino acid sequence following tyrosine 118 of paxillin (Y118SFP) suggests that phosphorylation at this site is likely to be responsible for mediating the known association between paxillin and the SH2 domain of the oncogenic protein, v-Crk(43Birge R.B.

This hypothesis is supported by a recent report demonstrating an interaction between paxillin phosphorylated on Tyr-118 and the SH2 domain of Crk (40Schaller M.D. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2635-2645Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). In summary, we have identified a specific tyrosine residue within paxillin that is a primary target for phosphorylation by FAK and have further demonstrated that the phosphorylation of this residue is not essential for the localization of paxillin to focal adhesion sites. Additional experiments will be required to elucidate signaling events that may lie downstream of paxillin phosphorylation by FAK. We are indebted to Dr. J. Tom Parsons (University of Virginia) for the generous gift of antibodies against FAK. We also thank Dr. Michael Brown for critical reading of this manuscript."

The IFN-gamma-inducible signal transducing factor (STF-IFN gamma) was activated in murine TH2 but not in TH1 cell clones, because in the latter the second chain of the IFN-gamma receptor (accessory factor 1 or IFN-gamma R beta) was absent. Thus, TH1 cells use receptor modification to prevent the activation of STF-IFN gamma and achieve an IFN-gamma-resistant state."

A 2.8-kilobase (kb) clone, KS43, contained a 1776-base pair open reading frame.

Further, a photoaffinity probe with high specificity for the reduced folate carrier labeled 94-kDa proteins in K562 cells and the transfectant containing the full-length KS43, and a 85-kDa protein in the transfectant containing the 3’-truncated KS32.

In order to better understand the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms associated with defective membrane transport, a number of studies have focused on the identification and molecular cloning of putative Mtx/reduced folate transport proteins. Matherly et al.(14Matherly L.H. Czajkowski C.A. Angeles S.M. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 3420-3426PubMed Google Scholar) used radioaffinity labeling with N-hydroxysuccinimide-[3H]Mtx (NHS-[3H]Mtx) to identify a 92-kDa glycoprotein carrier (on a 7.5% gel) from Mtx transport up-regulated K562 cells (designated K562.4CF). More recently, a highly glycosylated protein (GP-Mtx), presumably representing the carrier, was isolated from NHS[3H]Mtx-labeled membrane proteins from K562.4CF cells on columns of Ricinus communis agglutinin I-agarose(15Matherly L.H. Angeles S.M. Czajkowski C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23253-23260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A similar 80-85-kDa putative carrier was identified in transport up-regulated CCRF-CEM cells (CEM-7A) by affinity labeling with Nα-(4amino-4-deoxy-10-methylpteroyl)-N∊-(4-azido-5-[125I]iodosalicylyl)-L-lysine (APA-[125I]ASA-Lys)(16Freisheim J.H.

Identical labeling methods were used in murine L1210 cells to identify presumptive transport proteins with molecular masses of 42-48 kDa or 38 kDa (17Price E.M. Freisheim J.H.

Most recently, homologous cDNAs from L1210 cells (20Dixon K.H. Lanpher B.C. Chiu J. Kelley K. Cowan K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17-20Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells (21Williams F.M.R. Murray R.C. Underhill T.M. Flintoff W.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5810-5816Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were isolated and characterized. Both cDNAs encoded 58-kDa proteins and, when expressed in transport-impaired cells, restored Mtx sensitivities and Mtx transport activities. The apparent discrepancies in the molecular masses of the cDNA-encoded products and the membrane proteins identified in intact cells by radioaffinity labeling have raised considerable interest in the potential relationships among these proteins and their respective roles in the overall scheme of carrier-mediated folate transport. The present study describes the isolation and expression of human cDNAs which encode a function involved in the membrane transport of Mtx and reduced folates. The cDNAs were isolated from a cDNA library prepared from Mtx transport up-regulated K562.4CF cells, based on homology to the mouse cDNA. Mtx transport-defective CHO cells transfected with the human cDNAs regain their Mtx sensitivities and transport activities. The transport characteristics of the transfected cells resemble both the wild type human and hamster classical RFCs, suggesting the expression of a hybrid transport system. In addition, the cDNA encoded proteins can be radiolabeled with APA-[125I]ASA-Lys, a known photoaffinity inhibitor of the RFC. Taken together, the results strongly suggest that these cDNAs encode the human RFC (hRFC). [3’,5’,7-3H]Mtx (20 Ci/mmol) was purchased from Moravek Biochemicals (Brea, CA). Unlabeled MTX and (6R,S)-5-formyltetrahydrofolate (leucovorin) were provided from the Drug Development Branch, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD.

Flintoff (University of Western Ontario), were grown in α-minimal essential medium with 10% iron-supplemented bovine calf serum, penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 εg/ml). CHO cells were grown as monolayers for transfection experiments and cytotoxicity assays; for transport experiments, cells were grown in suspension in spinner flasks. Transfected CHO clones were selected and maintained in the presence of 1.5 mg/ml G418 (see below). For cytotoxicity determinations, cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with dialyzed fetal bovine serum and antibiotics, as described above, in 24-well dishes at 20,000 (K562) or 10,000 (CHO) cells/well. After 96 h of continuous exposure to various concentrations of Mtx and 1843U89, cell viabilities were determined by direct microscopic counting with a hemacytometer, either directly (K562) or following trypsinization (CHO). IC50 values were calculated as the concentrations of inhibitors required to inhibit growth by 50% compared to control cells grown under identical conditions, except that growth inhibitors were omitted. A 5’ fragment of the murine putative RFC cDNA(20Dixon K.H. Lanpher B.C. Chiu J. Kelley K. Cowan K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17-20Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), flanking positions 173 and 823 of the coding sequence, was prepared by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) from mouse L1210 cell total RNA. The oligonucleotides used were 5’-tccaggaattcgCCAAGGAGCAGGTGACTAACGAA-3’ and 5’-cggtatcgatCCCACCAGAGGCACCAGAGAGACGC-3’. The EcoRI and ClaI restriction sites (lower case bases) were added to the up and down-stream primers, respectively, for subcloning the PCR product into the pBluescript SK(-) vector (Stratagene). RT-PCR was performed using a Perkin-Elmer RT-PCR kit and an Ericomp thermal cycler. The partial cDNA fragment, designated M-D6, was partially sequenced to confirm its identity. A λgt11 K562.4CF cDNA library was prepared by Clontech (Palo Alto, CA). This library was plated at a density of 10,000 plaque-forming units/100-mm Petri dish and phage DNA was lifted onto nylon filters (Magna Lift Nylon, MSI). The filters were prehybridized in 50% formamide, 6 × SSPE (1 × SSPE contained 0.15 M NaCl, 10 mM NaH2PO4, 1 mM EDTA, pH 7.4), 0.5% SDS, 50 εg/ml denatured sheared salmon sperm DNA, and 5 × Denhardt's solution for 2 h at 42°C. Hybridization was carried out at 42°C overnight with the M-D6 probe radiolabeled with [α-32P]dCTP by random priming. Filters were washed (in 2 × SSC (1 × SSC contained 0.15 M NaCl, 15 mM Na3citrate, pH 7.0), 0.1% SDS for 20 min; twice at room temperature and twice at 42°C), and positive phage were identified by overnight autoradiography. From confirmed positives, phage DNA was prepared using LambdaSorb phage adsorbent (Promega) with the plate lysate method as described by the supplier. Restriction mapping of phage DNA was performed, and cDNA inserts (KS6, KS32, and KS43) were subcloned into the pBluescript SK(-) vector for sequencing. Unidirectional nested deletion sets were prepared from both sense and antisense KS32 cDNA/pBluescript plasmid constructs using the Erase-a-Base system from Promega. Single-stranded DNA templates were prepared from deletion set subclones by infecting plasmid-containing XL-1 Blue cells with the helper phage VCSM13 (Stratagene). Utilizing the universal T3 primer, both the sense and antisense strands were sequenced completely using the dideoxynucleotide chain termination method (24Sanger F. Niklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52771) Google Scholar) with a Sequenase Version 2 kit. Routinely, dGTP and dITP reactions were run in parallel to avoid problems associated with compression caused by G/C-rich sequences. Nucleotide sequence of the KS43 insert was obtained primarily with primers designed from the KS32 sequence and single-stranded template from the SalI-digested KS43 insert in pBluescript. In addition, EcoRI fragments of KS43 and KS6 in pBluescript were sequenced at both the 5’- and 3’-ends using T3 and T7 universal primers. Sequence data was analyzed using the University of Wisconsin Genetic Computer Group (GCG) package. Homology searches in nucleotide and protein sequence data bases were performed using the BLAST network service at the National Center for Biotechnology Information. Expression of KS32 and KS43 cDNA Inserts in CHO Mtx RII OuaR 2-4 Cells-The KS32 and KS43 cDNA inserts in pBluescript were directionally ligated into the expression vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) utilizing the XbaI and KpnI multi-cloning sites. The resulting plasmid constructs, designated pC32 and pC43, respectively, were used to transfect Mtx-resistant Mtx RII OuaR 2-4 cells; a mock transfection using the pcDNA3 vector was also performed. Transfection was carried out by the polybrene procedure (25Maniatis T. Fritsh E. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) using 2-4 εg of plasmid/3 × 105 cells in 60-mm Petri dishes. Seventy-two h post transfection, cells were trypsinized, washed with Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (DPBS; 26), and replated at densities ranging from 0.1 to 1 × 104 cells in 4 ml of fresh α-media containing 1.5 mg/ml G418. G418-resistant CHO clones that exhibited increased Mtx sensitivities over Mtx RII OuaR 2-4 cells were selected for further analysis. Logarithmically growing cells were washed with DPBS and resuspended into Hank's balanced salts solution. Transport experiments with [3H]Mtx were performed exactly as described previously (14Matherly L.H. Czajkowski C.A. Angeles S.M. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 3420-3426PubMed Google Scholar) using cell densities of 1-2 × 107 cells/ml. The levels of intracellular radioactivity were expressed as picomoles/milligram protein or pmol/107 cells, calculated from direct measurements of radioactivity and protein contents of the cell homogenates. Protein assays were by the method of Lowry et al.(27Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Intracellular accumulations were corrected for surface adsorption as described by Sirotnak(2Sirotnak F.M. Pharmacol. Ther. 1980; 8: 71-103Crossref Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Kinetic constants (i.e.Kt, Vmax, and Ki values) for assorted folate and antifolate substrates were calculated from Lineweaver-Burk and Dixon plots, respectively. Total RNA was isolated from log phase cells using the single step method of Chomczynski and Nicoletta(28Chomczynski P. Nicoletta S. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 151-159Crossref Scopus (63232) Google Scholar). Total RNA from each cell line (20 εg) was electrophoresed on 0.9% agarose gels containing 2.2 M formaldehyde and 1 × MOPS buffer. The gel was equilibrated in 10 × SSC and capillary transferred to GeneScreen Plus membrane (DuPont) in 10 × SSC; the membrane was baked at 80°C under vacuum for 1.5 h. Membranes were prehybridized in QuickHyb solution (Stratagene) for 15 min then hybridized for 1 h with the addition of [32P]dCTP-labeled KS43 cDNA insert (labeled by random priming). Nonspecific hybridization was removed by washing membranes in 2 × SSC, 0.1% SDS at 42°C and, finally, in 0.1 × SSC, O.1% SDS at 60°C. After autoradiography, the filters were stripped and rehybridized with a [32P]dCTP-labeled β-actin cDNA probe (Clontech). Densitometry of the autoradiograms was performed on a Molecular Dynamics Computing Densitometer and analyzed using the ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). A photoaffinity analogue of Mtx, APA-[125I]ASA-Lys, was synthesized from the unlabeled compound under subdued light using the procedure of Price and Freisheim(17Price E.M. Freisheim J.H. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 4757-4763Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The radiospecific activity of the APA-[125I]ASA-Lys was 2.9 mCi/εmol. Cells (K562, wild type CHO, L1210, and the transfected CHO lines) were incubated at a density of 1 × 108 cells/ml in ice-cold 20 mM HEPES, and 225 mM sucrose (pH adjusted to 7.4 with MgO). Cells were irradiated with a long wave-length UV lamp for 3 min, washed with DPBS (two times), and the radiolabeled proteins extracted with 500 εl of 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 1% Triton X-100 in the presence of a proteolytic inhibitor mixture(14Matherly L.H. Czajkowski C.A. Angeles S.M. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 3420-3426PubMed Google Scholar). Aliquots were electrophoresed on a 7.5% denaturing gel(14Matherly L.H. Czajkowski C.A. Angeles S.M. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 3420-3426PubMed Google Scholar). The gel was dried and exposed to film. Specificity of labeling was established by performing identical incubations in the presence of 100 εM aminopterin (AMT). Plasma membranes from K562 wild type, CHO cells, and transfected clones were prepared as described previously(15Matherly L.H. Angeles S.M. Czajkowski C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23253-23260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Membrane proteins (50-100 εg) were electrophoresed on a 4-10% linear gradient gel in the presence of SDS and electroblotted onto Immobilon P (Millipore). Immunoblot analysis was performed as described previously using rabbit antiserum to GP-Mtx, a putative glycoprotein component of the hRFC(15Matherly L.H. Angeles S.M. Czajkowski C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23253-23260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A partial cDNA to the putative RFC from murine cells (M-D6) was synthesized by RT-PCR and hybridized to a single 2.5-kilobase (kb) transcript in L1210 total RNA(20Dixon K.H. Lanpher B.C. Chiu J. Kelley K. Cowan K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17-20Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Based on the increased expression of a cross-hybridizing 3.1-kb transcript in K562.4CF over wild type K562 cells in low stringency washes (2 × SSC, 0.1% SDS at 42°C; not shown), a human K562.4CF cDNA library constructed in λgtll was screened with M-D6 under similar conditions. Approximately 500,000 phage were screened, and eight clones were selected from 40 positives. Phage DNAs were prepared from these eight clones and restriction digest analysis revealed that all inserts contained two identical SacI restriction fragments (300 and 800 base pairs (bp), gel not shown). The cDNA inserts for two clones, KS6 and KS32 (1.4 and 2.5 kb, respectively), were subcloned into the EcoRI multicloning site of the pBluescript SK(-) vector. Four other phage inserts contained an internal EcoRI restriction site. The longest, KS43 (2.8 kb), was subcloned into pBluescript as two separate EcoRI fragments (1.1 and 1.7 kb) and also in its entirety as a SalI restriction fragment (a SalI restriction site was present in the adaptors used in cDNA library construction). The resulting plasmids were sequenced. The physical map and sequencing strategies for clones KS6, KS32, and KS43 are shown in Fig. 1A. The nucleotide sequence and the deduced amino acid sequence for the KS43 cDNA insert is shown in Fig. 1B. The sequence contains a 98-bp 5’-untranslated region, an open reading frame (ORF) of 1776 bp preceded by a Kozak consensus sequence(29Kozak M. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 229-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (2810) Google Scholar), and a 3’-untranslated region of 864 bp which is followed by a poly(A) sequence. The predicted molecular mass of the translated protein is 65 kDa. One consensus N-glycosylation site was identified (at asparagine 58). For all three clones (KS6, KS32, and KS43), the upstream 5’-noncoding regions were highly heterogeneous starting at position −53 (Fig. 2). The nucleotide sequence of KS32 is identical to KS43 commencing with position −52, with the exception of a 626 base pair deletion starting at position 1568 (underlined sequence in Fig. 1B) and an additional four bases (TGTG) in the 3’-untranslated region immediately upstream from the poly(A) tail at position 2718 (not shown in Fig. 1B). As a result of the deletion in the 3’-ORF of KS32, the in-frame translational stop codon (position 1774) is lost. The KS32 coding sequence continues into the 3’-non-coding region with the utilization of a new stop codon at position 2205 (Fig. 1B). The result is that the KS32 ORF contains 14 bp (including the stop codon; bold face in Fig. 1B) not used in KS43, encoding 4 new carboxyl-terminal amino acids (LRCS). Clone KS6 appeared to be a partial cDNA. Only the 5’- and 3’-ends of the KS6 insert were sequenced (Fig. 1A). As expected, GenBank data base homology searches identified the mouse (20; GenBank accession no. L23755) and hamster (21; GenBank accession no. U03031) RFC sequences as highly homologous to KS43. No other homologous sequence was identified at the time this article was submitted. Amino acid sequence alignment analysis (Fig. 3), comparing the KS43 amino acid sequence with the homologous mouse (20Dixon K.H. Lanpher B.C. Chiu J. Kelley K. Cowan K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17-20Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and hamster (21Williams F.M.R. Murray R.C. Underhill T.M. Flintoff W.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5810-5816Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) sequences, revealed homologies of 79 and 80%, respectively; although the human RFC contained 73-79 more amino acids. All 9 of the tryptophans contained in the human sequence are conserved in the homologous hamster and mouse RFCs. Likewise, 4 of 6 cysteines are conserved. Interestingly, the single N-glycosylation site in the hRFC (at asparagine 58) was only conserved in the hamster RFC, even though two potential N-glycosylation sites were present in both the mouse and hamster sequences(20Dixon K.H. Lanpher B.C. Chiu J. Kelley K. Cowan K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17-20Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Williams F.M.R. Murray R.C. Underhill T.M. Flintoff W.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5810-5816Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Computer analysis of the deduced amino acid sequences, according to the criteria described by Kyte and Doolittle (30; not shown), predicted multiple hydrophobic domains similar to the homologous mouse and hamster cDNAs(20Dixon K.H. Lanpher B.C. Chiu J. Kelley K. Cowan K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17-20Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Williams F.M.R. Murray R.C. Underhill T.M. Flintoff W.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5810-5816Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). KS43 was used as a probe for Northern blots of total RNA from parental K562 cells, transport up-regulated K562.4CF cells, and a variant line (K500E) with 70-fold Mtx resistance associated with 82% impaired Mtx uptake(15Matherly L.H. Angeles S.M. Czajkowski C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23253-23260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A major 3.1-kb transcript was detected in all three lines with an intensity, in part, paralleling relative transport. Compared to wild type K562 cells, the 3.1-kb transcript was 3.3-fold increased in K562.4CF and 2.2-fold decreased in K500E cells (Fig. 4). A faint 4.2-kb transcript was also detected in the K562.4CF cells. To characterize the potential role of the human cDNA-encoded RFCs in Mtx membrane transport, the KS43 and KS32 pBluescript plasmid constructs were digested with XbaI and KpnI and the inserts directionally ligated into the XbaI and KpnI multicloning sites of the expression vector, pcDNA3. These pcDNA3 constructs, containing the KS43 and KS32 inserts and designated pC43 and pC32, respectively, were transfected into Mtx-resistant Mtx RII OuaR 2-4 CHO cells. Stable transfectants were selected with G418 (1.5 mg/ml) and screened for Mtx sensitivities over a range of 10-200 nM. Based on prior reports of an enhanced membrane transport and increased cytotoxicity of the benzoquinazoline antifolate, 1843U89, for human over murine cells(3Duch D.S. Banks S. Dev I.K.

The latter step is catalyzed by the viral envelope glycoprotein, which, in the low pH environment of the endosome, undergoes a conformational transition to a fusion-competent state. To investigate whether fusion competence involves the low pH exposure of a hydrophobic fusion region(s), we have applied hydrophobic photolabeling using the recently developed phospholipid analogue 1-O-hexadecanoyl-2-O-[9-[[[2-[125I]iodo-4-(trifluoromethyl-3H-diazirin-3-yl)benzyl]oxy]carbonyl] nonanoyl]-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine ([125I]TID-PC/16) (Weber, T., and Brunner, J.(1995) J. Am. Chem. Soc. 117, 3084-3095). Rosettes of rabies virus glycoprotein, whole rabies virus, or vesicular stomatitis virus were incubated with large unilamellar vesicles containing [125I]TID-PC/16. Following reagent activation, the labeled glycoprotein was isolated and analyzed. In all cases, labeling of the glycoprotein strongly increased as the pH was lowered from 7.0 to 6.0, suggesting the exposure at acidic pH of a domain capable of interacting with membranes. To identify the labeled region(s), CNBr fragments were generated and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide followed by autoradiography. In rabies glycoprotein, the labeled segment was found to be contained within fragment RCr5 (residues 103-179). Glycoprotein from vesicular stomatitis virus was labeled within fragment VCr1 (residues 59-221). These results demonstrate that rhabdovirus glycoprotein contains a domain that at low pH is capable of interacting with a target membrane in a hydrophobic manner.

Membrane fusion, a key step in the entry of enveloped animal viruses into their host cells, is catalyzed by virus envelope glycoproteins (for reviews, see (1Ohnishi S.-I. Curr. Top. Membr.

It forms a homotrimer, each subunit of which is composed of two polypeptide chains, HA1 and HA2, linked together through a single disulfide bond(6Wilson I.A. Skehel J.J. Wiley D.C. Nature. 1981; 289: 366-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (1993) Google Scholar). HA has a dual function. Initially, it mediates viral attachment to sialic acid-containing glycolipids or proteins on the surface of the host cell, whereupon the bound virus is internalized. In the mildly acidic environment of the endosome, HA undergoes a major structural transition to a fusion-competent state, which then promotes the fusion of the viral membrane with the membrane of the endosome. Although the mechanism of the fusion reaction is far from understood, it is clear that a conserved hydrophobic sequence of ∼23 amino acids at the N terminus of the HA2 subunit, called the fusion peptide, plays an essential role(7Gething M.-J. Doms R.W. York D. White J. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 11-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Site-specific mutations within this conserved segment slow down or abolish fusion. In the native fusion-inactive form of HA, this segment is largely buried within the hydrophobic interface of the trimer(6Wilson I.A. Skehel J.J. Wiley D.C. Nature. 1981; 289: 366-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (1993) Google Scholar). At the pH of fusion, the fusion peptide becomes exposed and, prior to the actual fusion step, inserts into the target membrane(8Skehel J.J. Bayley P.M. Brown E.B. Martin S.R.

Fusion peptides structurally related to that of HA are found in many other viral fusion proteins, including the F protein of Sendai virus (a parainfluenza virus), the E-protein complex of Semliki Forest virus (a togavirus), and gp41 of human immunodeficiency virus (a retrovirus). A putative fusion peptide is also present in PH-30, a protein involved in sperm-egg fusion(12Blobel C.P. Wolfsberg T.G. Turck C.W. Myles D.G. Primakoff P. White J.M.

VSV and rabies virus are members of the rhabdovirus family, which also enter cells through the endocytic pathway(13Matlin K.S. Reggio H. Helenius A. Simons K. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 156: 609-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar, 14Superti F. Derer M. Tsiang H. J. Gen. Virol. 1984; 65: 781-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Their fusion factor, the major envelope glycoprotein, contains neither a typical fusion peptide nor any other obvious hydrophobic sequence other than the (cleaved) signal sequence and the carboxyl-terminal membrane-anchoring domain. This raises the question of whether a hydrophobic tertiary structure element, a fusion “patch,” provides the equivalent function of the fusion peptide. Alternatively, one could also imagine a different mechanism of fusion. Various regions within the glycoprotein have been suggested to be essential for the fusogenic activity. Thus, peptides of 26 amino acid residues corresponding to the amino-terminal segment of VSV glycoprotein can cause hemolysis at low pH, with a pH dependence similar to that of the whole virus(15Schlegel R. Wade M. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 4691-4694Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Schlegel R. Wade M. J. Virol. 1985; 53: 319-323Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Rose and co-workers (17Whitt M.A. Zagouras P. Crise B. Rose J.K. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 4907-4913Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) reported the loss of fusion activity for a mutant glycoprotein with an additional N-linked oligosaccharide at amino acid 117.2 2Amino acid numbering corresponds to the protein before signal sequence cleavage. Unless stated otherwise, plain numbers (without Footnote 2) correspond to amino acid residues of the mature protein (after signal sequence cleavage). That this residue may be close to or within a fusogenic domain is also consistent with more recent work showing that mutations within a segment of uncharged amino acids, comprising residues 117-136,2 resulted in a significant decrease or loss of fusion activity(18Zhang L. Ghosh H.P. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 2186-2193Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Fredericksen B.L. Whitt M.A. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 1435-1443Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although this segment is highly conserved within glycoproteins of several strains of vesiculoviruses, the degree of homology is low when compared with glycoproteins from various strains of rabies virus (see “Discussion”). For this latter virus, a segment (FNGIILG) comprising residues 360-366 shows strong homology to the fusion peptide of paramyxoviruses and has also been proposed to play a role in the fusion process(20Morimoto K. Ni Y.-J. Kawai A. Virology. 1992; 189: 203-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). There is evidence that mildly acid conditions induce a conformational transition in VSV and rabies virus glycoproteins to an activated state that is more hydrophobic than the native state(21Crimmins D.L. Mehard W.B. Schlesinger S. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 5790-5796Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 22Puri A. Winick J. Lowy R.J. Covell D. Eidelman O. Walter A. Blumenthal R. J. Biol.

Here, using the newly developed photoactivable lipid [125I]TID-PC/16 ((24Weber T. Brunner J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 3084-3095Crossref Scopus (96) Google Scholar); for a review of the labeling technique, see (25Brunner J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 483-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar)), we show that during this transition, a segment within the glycoprotein ectodomain acquires the ability to interact with membranes. Cyanogen bromide fragmentation of the labeled protein has been applied to identify this membrane-active segment. [125I]TID-PC/16 (>2000 Ci/mmol) was synthesized according to the procedures described previously(24Weber T. Brunner J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 3084-3095Crossref Scopus (96) Google Scholar). In a similar way, [125I]TID-BE was prepared by radioiododestannylation of 4’-(3-trifluoromethyl-3H-diazirin-3-yl)-2’-tributylstannylbenzyl benzoate.3 3The synthesis and characterization of this labeling reagent will be described elsewhere. The radioiodinated compounds were stored as solutions in ethanol/toluene (1:1, v/v). Egg lecithin (grade I) was from Lipid Products (South Nutfield, United Kingdom); phosphatidylethanolamine from Avanti Polar Lipids, Inc. (Birmingham, AL). The Indiana laboratory strain (Orsay) of VSV and the PV strain of rabies virus were grown in BSR cells (a clone of BHK-21) and purified as described(26Barge A. Gaudin Y. Coulon P. Ruigrok R.W.H. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 7246-7253Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Gaudin Y. Ruigrok R.W.H. Tuffereau C. Knossow M. Flamand A. Virology. 1992; 187: 627-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). The virions were resuspended in TD buffer (137 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 0.7 mM Na2HPO4, 25 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5)) and stored at −80°C. Glycoprotein from rabies virus was solubilized and purified as described previously(27Gaudin Y. Ruigrok R.W.H. Tuffereau C. Knossow M. Flamand A. Virology. 1992; 187: 627-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). The protein was extensively dialyzed against 150 mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing Bio-Beads SM-2 (Bio-Rad) to eliminate the detergent. To the protein micelles (1-1.5 mg of protein/ml) were added NaN3 (final concentration of 0.02%) and a mixture of protease inhibitors (leupeptin (2 εg/ml), antipain (2 εg/ml), pepstatin (2 εg/ml), chymostatin (2 εg/ml), and aprotinin (16 εg/ml)). The glycoprotein rosettes were stored at 4°C and used within 1 week. As judged by electron microscopy, the morphology of the spikes was the same as on intact virions; at pH 6.4 and 0°C, rosettes aggregated without changes in morphology. At pH 6.0 and 37°C, changes occurred as in intact virus. In all, glycoprotein rosettes behaved as viral glycoprotein. This protein was isolated following the procedure of Kamp and Wirtz(28Kamp H.H. Wirtz K.W.A. Methods Enzymol. 1974; 22: 140-146Crossref Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The last step in the purification was omitted. Prior to use, the protein (stored in 50% glycerol at −20°C) was dialyzed against the appropriate buffer containing 10 mM β-mercaptoethanol and then concentrated using a Centricon microconcentrator (Amicon, Inc.). LUVs were prepared from phosphatidylcholine/phosphatidylethanolamine (4:1 molar ratio) containing [125I]TID-PC/16 (up to 100 εCi/εmol of total lipid) according to the protocol of Weber et al.(29Weber T. Paesold G. Galli C. Mischler R. Semenza G. Brunner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18353-18358Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Either citrate/phosphate buffer (prepared by mixing 0.1 M citric acid and 0.2 M Na2HPO4 to a final pH of 7.0) or 137 mM NaCl, 25 mM Tris (pH 7.5) was used. For labeling of rabies glycoprotein rosettes, 1 volume each of LUVs (in citrate/phosphate buffer) and glycoprotein (in TD buffer) were mixed. After 1 min, 0.1 M citric acid was added for adjustment to the desired pH. For labeling of viruses, LUVs and viruses, both in TD buffer (pH 7.4), were mixed. The pH was then adjusted by the addition of 2 volumes of 0.1 M citrate, 0.2 M phosphate buffer of the desired pH. For labeling of glycoprotein rosettes and VSV, incubation mixtures (in Eppendorf tubes) were irradiated for 30 s in a Pyrex vessel mounted ∼10 cm from a SUSS LH 1000 lamphouse equipped with a 350-watt high pressure mercury lamp. For photolabeling of intact rabies virus, a 100-watt high pressure mercury lamp was used; irradiation times were 2 min. To the photolabeled glycoprotein rosettes or viruses were added 3 volumes of chloroform/methanol (1:2, v/v). After 1 h at room temperature, the precipitated protein was sedimented in an Eppendorf centrifuge (10 min, 14,000 rpm). Following removal of the supernatant, the protein pellet was dried under reduced pressure, dissolved in sample buffer (3 min in boiling water), and subjected to 12% SDS-PAGE(30Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207522) Google Scholar). After brief staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250, the glycoprotein-containing band was excised, and the protein was electroeluted using a homemade apparatus. The protein (typically in 1-2 ml of 180 mM glycine, 25 mM Tris, 0.1% SDS) was concentrated in a Centricon 30 microconcentrator (Amicon, Inc.) to a final volume of 30-40 εl. To remove (most of) the salt, the sample was diluted with 2 ml of water and concentrated again. SDS was first removed by ion-pair extraction(31Konigsberg W.H. Henderson L. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 91: 254-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). To 100 εg of glycoprotein were added 0.8 mg of CNBr dissolved in 70% formic acid. The solution was flushed with nitrogen and kept in the dark for 20 h. Excess CNBr and formic acid were removed by evaporation on a Speed-Vac. The residue was dissolved in 20 εl of formic acid. Water (0.2 ml) was added, and the sample were subjected to lyophilization. The CNBr peptides were then dissolved in sample buffer and separated by SDS-PAGE using a 14.5% polyacrylamide gel containing 6 M urea(32Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10503) Google Scholar). The gel was stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 and subjected to autoradiography. CNBr peptides separated by SDS-PAGE were transferred electrophoretically onto a PVDF membrane using the semidry blot technique (Sartoblot II-S apparatus) and the buffer system of Laurière(33Laurière M. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 212: 206-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). After transfer, the PVDF membrane was rinsed with water, and the peptides were visualized by brief staining (5 min) with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. Following destaining, the membrane was washed with water, and the peptide-containing bands were excised and subjected to Edman sequence analyses. The latter analyses were performed in the Eidgenössische Technische Hochschule protein chemical laboratory (directed by Dr. Peter James). Since the glycoprotein cannot easily be obtained in a water-soluble form, lacking the hydrophobic membrane anchor, initial experiments were performed with intact detergent-solubilized protein. In the absence of detergent, the protein forms rosette-like aggregates, which, upon acidification, undergo a structural rearrangement similar to that seen with virus-bound glycoprotein. When glycoprotein rosettes and LUVs doped with [125I]TID-PC/16 were incubated at different pH values and then exposed to UV light, the protein became labeled in a pH-dependent manner (Table 1). Labeling consistently increased as the pH of the incubation mixture was lowered from 7.0 to 6.4 and 6.0. Not surprisingly, some labeling was also seen at pH 7.0, presumably due to exchange of glycoprotein between rosettes and liposomes. In any case, at pH 7.0, labeling could be expected to be restricted to the C-terminal membrane anchor. In contrast, labeling at low pH may partly be due to conformation-specific interactions of the glycoprotein ectodomain with the membrane.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab To identify the region(s) in the glycoprotein labeled at low pH, it was first necessary to establish procedures for the generation and separation of suitable fragments. On the basis of the amino acid sequence of the glycoprotein of the PV strain and previous CNBr fragmentation studies with the structurally related ERA strain(34Dietzschold B. Wiktor T.J. Macfarlan R. Varrichio A. J. Virol. 1982; 44: 595-602Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we decided to examine CNBr fragmentation. PV strain glycoprotein contains 14 methionine and 15 cysteine residues. Of the latter, 14 are located within the ectodomain portion and form disulfide bridges, two of which are thought to connect CNBr fragments (Fig. 1A and 2A). Most of the fragments, accounting for >95% of the protein mass, are of reasonable size for separation by SDS-PAGE. Fig. 1B shows the pattern of CNBr fragments separated on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel under reducing conditions together with the results from N-terminal sequence analyses. The pattern of bands is very similar to that reported previously(34Dietzschold B. Wiktor T.J. Macfarlan R. Varrichio A. J. Virol. 1982; 44: 595-602Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), except that RCr5 (corresponding to Cr4 in (33Laurière M. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 212: 206-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar)) appears here as a doublet of bands (RCr5α and RCr5β). The sequencing results not only confirmed the assignments made on the basis of electrophoretic mobilities, but also provided an explanation for the apparent splitting of RCr5 into two bands: while the upper band (RCr5α) shows the expected sequence AGDPRY, RCr5β lacks the first three amino acid residues and therefore is likely to be derived from RCr5α by acid cleavage of the susceptible Asp-3-Pro-4 bond. Sequence analyses of the diffuse band corresponding to 7-8 kDa suggest the presence of at least four different peptides (RCr1b, RCr6, RCr7, and RCr8), possibly contaminated by RCr3c. In view of the results presented below, it is important to note that both RCr5α and RCr5β gave clean sequencing results and therefore represent unique peptides. Separation of the CNBr fragments under nonreducing conditions and Edman sequencing of the individual peptides gave the results summarized in Fig. 2B, which are also in agreement with the data reported by Dietzschold et al.(34Dietzschold B. Wiktor T.J. Macfarlan R. Varrichio A. J. Virol. 1982; 44: 595-602Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). RCa1a and RCa1b showed the same N-terminal sequences, a result pointing to the presence of an uncleaved methionine in one of the peptides contained in RCa1a. Re-electrophoresis of RCa1b under reducing conditions yielded two dominant bands with electrophoretic mobilities corresponding to RCr2 and RCr7 and a weakly stained band at the position of RCr1a (data not shown). In addition to the fact that not all CNBr fragments could be cleanly separated, further complications were expected to arise from the likely labeling of multiple segments comprising both the membrane anchor and fusion domain. To cope with this problem, we first determined the radioactivity pattern resulting from fragmentation of glycoprotein labeled within the C-terminal anchor segment. This material was prepared by UV irradiation of a mixed micellar solution containing glycoprotein, [125I]TID-PC/16, and the nonionic detergent C12E8 in pH 7.5 buffer. This radioactivity pattern was then compared with those obtained upon fragmentation of glycoprotein labeled in the presence of LUVs at either pH 7.0 or 6.0 (Fig. 3, A and B). CNBr fragments derived from anchor-labeled glycoprotein gave rise to two rather diffuse radioactive bands, which show the same mobilities on the reducing and nonreducing gels (lanes1 and 4). While the lower band presumably corresponds to labeled RCr3c (this fragment is also generated under nonreducing conditions, but could not be identified by sequence analysis), the upper band is likely to be due to labeled RCr3a/RCr3b (lane1) and RCa3 (lane4).4 4As indicated in Figs. 1 and 2, RCr3a/RCr3b and RCa3 may represent peptides of incomplete cleavage with identical N termini. Alternatively, they could represent products of dimerization of RCr3c. As expected, the same pattern was also obtained upon labeling of glycoprotein rosettes in the presence of LUVs at pH 7.0 (lanes2 and 5). When, however, labeling was carried out at pH 6.0, a clearly different radioactivity distribution pattern was obtained. Under both reducing (lane3) and nonreducing (lane6) conditions, a major proportion of the radioactivity now appeared at ∼11 kDa, corresponding to RCr5α/RCr5β (lane3) and RCa4 (lane6), two identical peptides. A minor amount of radioactivity also appeared to be associated with the membrane anchor. Next, we investigated the interaction of rabies virus with LUVs at different pH values (7.0, 6.4, and 6.0) and temperatures (0 and 23°C) and after different periods of incubation (10 s, 1 min, and 10 min). Following photolabeling, the virus proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, glycoprotein-containing bands were excised, and the protein was electroeluted. As shown in Table 2, the extent of labeling of the glycoprotein was strongly dependent upon the incubation conditions. Only very faint labeling was found after incubation at pH 7.0, and by far the strongest labeling was seen following fusion (pH 6.0 and 23°C). Interestingly, at pH 6.4, labeling at 0°C was four to six times stronger than at 23°C.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab To identify the regions in the glycoprotein labeled under the various conditions, CNBr fragments were generated and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography (Fig. 4, A and B). Only very faint and diffuse radioactivity can be seen in samples corresponding to incubations at 23°C and pH 7.0 (lane1) or pH 6.4 (lane2). Samples from incubations at 0°C and pH 6.4 show two radioactive bands, the more prominent of which correlates with RCr5α and RCr5β and the other with a peptide in the region of RCr2/RCr3a/RCr3b (lanes4 and 5). To facilitate interpretation of these data, we also analyzed a sample of glycoprotein labeled in intact virus (pH 7.3) with [125I]TID-BE (an improved version of [125I]TID(35Brunner J. Semenza G. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 7174-7182Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 36Brunner J. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 172: 628-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar); for chemical formula, see Fig. 5), a reagent expected to label the C-terminal anchoring domain (peptides RCr3a, RCr3b, and RCr3c). As shown in lane6, the resulting pattern is different from those in lanes4 and 5 and closely resembles that in lane1 of Fig. 3, also reflecting membrane anchor labeling. When labeling was performed following fusion of viruses with LUVs (lane3), radioactivity was found in fragments representing the membrane anchor (same as in lane6) as well as in RCr5α/RCr5β (as in lanes4 and 5). The weakly labeled upper band in the RCr2/RCr3a region of lanes4 and 5 (and lane3, but not lane6) has not been characterized further. It may be due to an incompletely cleaved fragment containing the RCr5 region or labeled RCr2. In summary, whereas under prefusion conditions (0°C and pH 6.4), the main sites of labeling are within RCr5, postfusion labeling results in incorporation of radioactivity into both RCr5 and peptides containing the membrane anchor.Figure 5:Chemical structure of [125I]TID-BE.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) This study was extended to include also experiments with VSV. The design of the experiments was similar to that described above for rabies virus. The glycoproteins of both viruses share only limited sequence homology (37Rose J.K. Doolittle R.F. Anilionis A. Curtis P.J. Wunner W.H. J. Virol. 1982; 43: 361-364Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as apparent also from the rather different distribution of methionine residues (Fig. 6A). When incubation mixtures of VSV and LUVs containing [125I]TID-PC/16 were subjected to photolysis, the extent of labeling of the glycoprotein was also found to depend on the incubation conditions (Table 3). The pattern is similar to that obtained with rabies glycoprotein: no or negligible labeling was seen at pH 7.0, and comparably strong labeling occurred upon fusion of the virus with the label-containing LUVs (23°C and pH 5.8). Likewise, labeling upon a short incubation at pH 6.4 and 0°C was substantially stronger than that measured at pH 6.4 and 23°C.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab VSV glycoprotein isolated from SDS-polyacrylamide gel was subjected to CNBr cleavage. The resulting peptides were separated on a reducing SDS-polyacrylamide gel (Fig. 6B), and the most prominent bands were subjected to N-terminal amino acid sequence analysis. The results of these analyses together with the assignments made are also summarized in Fig. 6B. With the exception of five small predicted fragments (residues 46-58, 222-239, 344-346, 347-386, and 387-391), all major peptides, accounting for 85% of the protein mass, could be identified. The above CNBr fragmentation scheme was used to determine the region(s) within the glycoprotein labeled in VSV in the presence of [125I]TID-PC/16-containing LUVs (Fig. 7, A and B). Although the separation of the peptides was not completely satisfactory, it is again clear that upon incubation under mildly acidic conditions (pH 6.4 and 0°C), the segment first labeled (lane7) does not correspond to the membrane anchor (VCr2), but rather to VCr1. Selective labeling of the membrane anchor (VCr2) was accomplished following phospholipid exchange protein-catalyzed transfer of [125I]TID-PC/16 into the viral membrane (lane11) and resulted in several radioactive bands, most likely reflecting the tendency of VCr2 to aggregate (particularly apparent from the radioactivity that did not enter the gel). Although VCr2 has been identified within a region corresponding to ∼20 kDa, this is likely to correspond to a dimer (or trimer). VCr2 monomers, as predicted, may correspond to the band at 11 kDa seen only on the autoradiograph (lanes5, 6, and 11). Again, we noted that under conditions expected to result in increased fusion, there is also an increase in labeling of VCr2 (compare lanes5 and 6 and lanes 7-9). It is difficult to judge whether the extent of labeling of VCr1 increases during fusion or remains at a level comparable with that in lane7. The structural transitions of rabies virus glycoprotein have been described previously(23Gaudin Y. Ruigrok R.W.H. Knossow M. Flamand A. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 1365-1372Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).5 5Y. Gaudin, C. Tuffereau, P. Durrer, A. Flamand, and R. W. H. Ruigrok, submitted for publication. Immediately after acidification below pH 6.7, the virions appear to be more hydrophobic and are able to interact with the target membrane in a manner different from that at neutral pH. It has been proposed that this hydrophobic interaction with the target membrane, mediated by glycoproteins in an activated state, may represent a first step in the fusion process. However, further protonation at a pH below 6.3 is necessary for fusion. In the absence of a target membrane, the activation state induces the formation of viral aggregates that are stabilized at low pH and low temperature(23Gaudin Y. Ruigrok R.W.H. Knossow M. Flamand A. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 1365-1372Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Prolonged incubation at low pH leads to a subsequent conformational change of the glycoprotein to its inactive state, which is highly sensitive to proteases(38Gaudin Y. Tuffereau C. Segretain D. Knossow M. Flamand A. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 4853-4859Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), antigenically distinct from and of longer shape than the native structure. In the case of VSV, the same three states have been postulated from kinetic studies(39Clague M.J. Schoch C. Zech L. Blumenthal R. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 1303-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). For this virus, the trimeric structure of the protein is stabilized in the inactive state(40Doms R.W. Keller D.S. Helenius A. Balch W.E. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 1957-1969Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar), which is associated with fusion inactivation (39Clague M.J. Schoch C. Zech L. Blumenthal R. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 1303-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar).6 6Y. Gaudin and R. W. H. Ruigrok, unpublished results. In this report, we show that immediately after acidification, segments within the ectodomain of the glycoprotein are capable of interacting with model target membranes. Since labeling with the carbene-generating [125I]TID-PC/16 can be assumed to be confined to the apolar phase of the membrane, the interaction of the glycoprotein with the membrane involves hydrophobic effects. It is tempting therefore to speculate that the corresponding region plays a functional role similar to that of the fusion peptide of other viral fusion proteins. All the results obtained from photolabeling are consistent with previous results of fusion assays monitoring lipid mixing(23Gaudin Y. Ruigrok R.W.H. Knossow M. Flamand A. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 1365-1372Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In particular, both techniques showed the same pH dependence for fusion. Analyses of the labeled glycoprotein revealed that upon fusion conditions (pH 6 for rabies virus; pH 5.8 for VSV), the main sites of labeling are contained within the transmembrane region and within a distinct segment of the ectodomain identified as RCr5 (residues 103-179) and VCr1 (residues 59-221) for rabies virus and VSV, respectively. Prefusion conditions (pH 6.4 and 0°C) led to preferential or exclusive labeling of RCr5 and VCr1. Therefore, as for influenza virus(10Stegmann T. Delfino J.M. Richards F.M. Helenius A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18404-18410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Tsurudome M. Glück R. Graf R. Falchetto R. Schaller U. Brunner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20225-20232Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a domain of rhabdovirus glycoprotein, prior to fusion, interacts with the target membrane. Thus, our results confirm results of previous studies (23Gaudin Y. Ruigrok R.W.H. Knossow M. Flamand A. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 1365-1372Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) suggesting that it is the activated state that is able to interact with the target membrane. Consistent with this view is the finding that incubation at pH 6.4 and 0°C of the virus with the probe-containing target membrane results in a markedly stronger labeling of the glycoprotein than incubation at pH 6.4 and 23°C, where inactivation occurs faster. The approach taken here provides qualitatively different information than site-directed mutagenesis(17Whitt M.A. Zagouras P. Crise B. Rose J.K. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 4907-4913Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Zhang L. Ghosh H.P. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 2186-2193Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Fredericksen B.L. Whitt M.A. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 1435-1443Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). While our approach is designed to identify segments interacting directly with membranes, the role of the functional critical region (VSV glycoprotein residues 102-120 (118-1362) identified by mutagenesis has not been defined further. Rather than representing a fusogenic region per se, it could be critical for the low pH exposure of a nearby element with fusogenic properties. In this context, it is important to note that mutations in other regions also affected the fusion properties of VSV (41Li Y. Drone C. Sat E. Ghosh H.P. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 4070-4077Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although the segment identified by Zhang and Ghosh (18Zhang L. Ghosh H.P. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 2186-2193Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) is highly conserved in vesiculoviruses, there is less homology to the corresponding region in rabies glycoprotein (Fig. 8) (37Rose J.K. Doolittle R.F. Anilionis A. Curtis P.J. Wunner W.H. J. Virol. 1982; 43: 361-364Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Sequence comparison between RCr5 and the homologous region of glycoproteins of other rhabdoviruses reveals that the highest degree of homology is found within a region from Val-144 to Trp-197 (PV numbering). In the putative fusion domain of VSV (residues 102-120 (118-136)2), only Gly-102 (118),2 Pro-110 (126),2 and Val-119 (135)2 appear to be conserved in both vesiculo- and lyssaviruses (Fig. 8). Finally, inspection of the RCr5 sequence does not reveal any extended hydrophobic segment. This could suggest that the membrane-interacting region adopts either the conformation of a sided α-helix, as proposed originally for the HA fusion peptide(42Harter C. James P. Bächi T. Semenza G. Brunner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 6459-6464Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), or that of a β-structure, as suggested for the putative fusion peptide of PH-30(43Muga A. Neugebauer W. Hirama T. Surewicz W.K. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 4444-4448Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Although there are obvious parallels in the behavior of rhabdovirus glycoprotein and influenza virus HA, it is also important to refer to striking differences that may be relevant in defining viral fusion mechanisms. First, in the case of rhabdoviruses, the conformational changes from the native toward the active and inactive conformations at low pH are completely reversible after readjusting the pH to above 7.0 (23Gaudin Y. Ruigrok R.W.H. Knossow M. Flamand A. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 1365-1372Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 38Gaudin Y. Tuffereau C. Segretain D. Knossow M. Flamand A. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 4853-4859Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 39Clague M.J. Schoch C. Zech L. Blumenthal R. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 1303-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 40Doms R.W. Keller D.S. Helenius A. Balch W.E. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 1957-1969Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Moreover, fusion and fusion inactivation are kinetically distinct processes.5 In the case of influenza virus, the conformational transition leading to the exposure of the fusion peptide is irreversible, and fusion and fusion inactivation are kinetically related processes(44Ramalho-Santos J. Nir S. Düzgünes N. de Carvalho A.P. Lima M.C.P. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 2771-2779Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Second, despite the fact that the basic designs of this study and previous experiments with influenza virus were similar, there are major differences between the quantitative aspects of labeling influenza virus HA and rabies virus glycoprotein. It appears that labeling of the glycoprotein at pH 6.4 and 0°C is 1-2 orders of magnitude more efficient than labeling of HA under prefusion conditions. Although different intrinsic reactivities of the glycoprotein and HA fusion domains could, in principle, account for such differences in labeling, they could also reflect some more fundamental differences in behavior. This is especially apparent when labeling in the pre- and postfusion states of the two viruses is compared. In the case of rabies virus, the extent of labeling of the glycoprotein increases by a factor of ∼5 (see Table 2) when going from the activated prefusion state (pH 6.4 and 0°C) to postfusion conditions (pH 6.0, 10 min). Analysis of the label distribution patterns (Fig. 4) indicates that this increase resulted mainly, or exclusively, from incorporation of label into the membrane-anchoring domain (a consequence of membrane fusion). In contrast, for influenza virus (strain PR8/34), the transition from the pre- to the postfusion state is accompanied by an increase in labeling of HA by at least a factor of 200(11Tsurudome M. Glück R. Graf R. Falchetto R. Schaller U. Brunner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20225-20232Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, after fusion, the HA2 N-terminal fusion peptide is labeled at least 50 times more strongly than in the prefusion state, a result that can be ascribed to the ability of the HA fusion peptide to penetrate the viral/fused membrane, independent of whether the fusion peptide initially interacted with the target membrane. The absence of any significant increase in labeling of the glycoprotein ectodomain during fusion of rabies virus could imply that membrane insertion of the fusogenic domain of the glycoprotein occurs only during prefusion complex formation and that, unlike influenza virus HA, no fusion-independent pathway for membrane insertion exists. This issue is of considerable interest since fusion of influenza virus has been suggested to be linked mechanistically with the ability of the HA fusion peptide to penetrate the viral/fused membrane(29Weber T. Paesold G. Galli C. Mischler R. Semenza G. Brunner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18353-18358Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).

This process occurs through the activation of transcription factors, STAT proteins, (signal transducers and activators of transcription) and the tyk2/Jak family of protein tyrosine kinases(1Darnell Jr., J.E.

Whereas the STAT proteins possess SH2 and SH3 domains(3Fu X.-Y. Cell. 1992; 70: 323-335Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar), the Tyk/Jak kinases have two putative catalytic domains (of which only the carboxyl one is active) but lack SH2 or SH3 domains(4Wilks A.F.

These kinases have been shown to be associated with several cytokine receptors that require dimerization by the ligand to initiate signal transduction. One such ligand is interferon γ (IFNγ), a homodimeric molecule, that bivalently binds to its receptor and activates the Jak/STAT pathway by clustering its receptor. The IFNγ receptor consists of a high affinity ligand binding chain (α) (Ka = 1010M-1) that alone is incapable of transducing a signal across the membrane (5Aguet M. Dembic Z. Merlin G.

Tyrosine phosphorylation of the α chain occurs concomitantly with tyrosine phosphorylation of both Jak1 and Jak2(12Igarashi K. Garotta G. Ozmen L. Ziemiecki A. Wilks A.F. Harpur A.G. Larner A.C.

Schlessinger J. Levy D.E. Nature. 1993; 366: 583-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Both kinases form a multimolecular complex with the IFNγ receptor immediately after ligand binding(12Igarashi K. Garotta G. Ozmen L. Ziemiecki A. Wilks A.F. Harpur A.G. Larner A.C. Finbloom D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14333-14336Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). STAT1α has been shown to bind to a peptide of the IFNγ receptor containing the phosphorylated tyrosine 440(11Greenlund A.C. Farrar M.A. Viviano B.L. Schreiber R.D. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1591-1600Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). The contribution of each chain of the IFNγ receptor (IFNγR) to the formation of this complex and the relationship of kinase activity to ligand binding still needs to be defined. We have carried out a series of experiments designed to assess the relationship between the α and β chains of the receptor and the Jak kinases in both cell lines, primary monocytes, and in somatic cell hybrids that express either the human α chain or both the human α and β chains of the receptor. HeLa cells were maintained in stationary flasks or adapted for growth in spinner flasks as described previously(12Igarashi K. Garotta G. Ozmen L. Ziemiecki A. Wilks A.F. Harpur A.G. Larner A.C. Finbloom D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14333-14336Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Human peripheral blood monocytes were obtained from volunteers by leukapheresis. The monocytes were purified from the mononuclear cells by Ficoll-Hypaque (LSM, Organon Teknika, Durham, NC) sedimentation followed by countercurrent centrifugal elutriation, were >95% pure, and used without further culturing. The T41 cell line is a mouse L929 fibroblast cell line stably transfected with the human IFNγ receptor α chain. The 3-1-12 cell line is a mouse-man somatic cell hybrid (WavR4d-F9-4a) retaining only chromosome 21 (17Tan Y.H. Tischfield J. Ruddle F.H. J. Exp. Med. 1973; 137: 317-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar) and has been similarly transfected with the human IFNγ receptor α chain. Chromosome 21 also encodes for the IFNα receptor, and the responsiveness of the 3-1-12 cell line to IFNα can be used to assess the ability of the cells to retain chromosome 21(18Slate D. Shulman L. Lawrence J. Revel M. Ruddle F. J. Virol. 1978; 25: 319-325Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The ability of the T41 and 3-1-12 cell lines to respond to IFNα or IFNγ was monitored by the enhancement of major histocompatibility class I antigen expression. Cells were treated with IFN for 24 h and then incubated with antibodies specific for major histocompatibility class I antigens followed by incubation with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibody. The cells were then analyzed by flow cytometric analysis on a FACScan. Recombinant human IFNγ (Genentech, Inc., S. San Francisco, CA) was radiolabeled using Bolton-Hunter reagent (Amersham Corp.) to high specific activity as described(19Finbloom D.S. Hoover D.L. Wahl L.M. J. Immunol. 1985; 135: 300-305PubMed Google Scholar). Increasing concentrations of 125I-rIFNγ were incubated at 4°C for 2 h with cells, and a 200-fold excess of unlabeled IFNγ was used in parallel tubes to correct for nonspecific binding. Free IFNγ was separated from bound IFNγ by centrifugation over a phthalate oil cushion as described (19Finbloom D.S. Hoover D.L. Wahl L.M. J. Immunol. 1985; 135: 300-305PubMed Google Scholar). Molecules bound per cell were calculated from the specific activity of the radiolabeled IFNγ. After treatment with IFNγ, cells were washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline and solubilized with cold whole cell extraction buffer (1 mM MgCl2, 20 mM Hepes (pH 7.0), 10 mM KCl, 300 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM dithiothreitol, 0.1% Triton X-100, 200 εM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mM vanadate, and 20% glycerol). DNA-binding proteins were determined by electrophoretic mobility shift assay as described previously(20Wilson K.C. Finbloom D.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11964-11968Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Briefly, 10 εg of protein were incubated with the 32P-labeled oligonucleotide probe consisting of double-stranded GRR (5’ AGCATGTTTCAAGGATTTGAGATGTATTTCCCAGAAAAG 3’) of the promoter of the Fcgr1 gene in binding buffer(21Pearse R.N. Feinman R. Ravetch J.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 11305-11309Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The sample was then applied to a 6% nondissociating polyacrylamide gel in order to separate free probe from probe bound to protein. Monocytes were resuspended into medium deficient for methionine, cysteine, and glutamine for 30 min at 37°C. This medium was replaced with fresh media deficient for the same amino acids containing 400 εCi of Translabel ([35S[methionine and 35S-cysteine) (ICN, Costa Mesa, CA), and the cells continued in incubation for 3 h. The cells were then washed, lysed, and the extracts subjected to immunoprecipitation as described below. Following treatment with IFNγ, cells (2 × 108) were solubilized in 1% Triton X-100 (Pierce) in a buffer consisting of 0.15 M NaCl, 50 mM Tris (pH 8.0), 50 mM NaF, 5 mM sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mM orthovanadate. The post-nuclear lysate was then precleared with a suspension of protein G-agarose (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) for 1 h at 4°C. After separation of the protein G-agarose from the lysate by centrifugation, the lysate was incubated with either normal rabbit serum, rabbit anti-IFNγR, rabbit anti-Jak1 (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Saranac Lake, NY), rabbit anti-Jak2 (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.), or rabbit anti-STAT1α (22Igarashi K. David M. Larner A.C. Finbloom D.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3984-3989Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) for 2-18 h at 4°C. Two different anti-IFNγR antibodies were used. One is a polyclonal antibody (anti-IFNγR) raised against purified α chain of the receptor(23Garotta G. Ozman L. Fountoulakis M. Dembic Z. van Loon A.P. Stuber D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6908-6915Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the other is a polyclonal antibody (anti-AF-1) raised against a 30-amino acid peptide of the cytoplasmic domain of the accessory factor/β chain (amino acids 307-337). This antibody was affinity purified on an antigen-conjugated agarose column. Protein G-agarose was then added for 1 h at 4°C to isolate the immune complexes. The protein G conjugates were then washed in lysis buffer and boiled in SDS sample buffer. For immunoprecipitations specifically designed to assess protein-protein interactions, cells were lysed in the same buffer as above except that digitonin was substituted for Triton X-100, and the immune complexes were washed in 0.1% digitonin containing buffer. The samples were then analyzed using 8% SDS-PAGE followed by electrophoretic transfer to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Immobilon-P, Millipore, Bedford, MA) as described(12Igarashi K. Garotta G. Ozmen L. Ziemiecki A. Wilks A.F. Harpur A.G. Larner A.C. Finbloom D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14333-14336Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells, untreated or treated with IFNγ, were washed, solubilized, and the extracts subjected to immunoprecipitation as described above. The immunoprecipitates were then resuspended in kinase assay buffer (100 mM NaCl, 50 mM Hepes (pH 7.3), 0.1% Triton X-100, 6.25 mM MnCl2, 0.5 mM dithiothreitol). To this buffer was added either 25 εM ATP and 5 εCi of [γ-32P]ATP when autoradiography was performed or 2.5 mM ATP when anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblotting was performed. The reaction mixture was incubated for 15 min at 30°C and the immunoprecipitates washed several times with lysis buffer prior to the addition of SDS sample buffer. The samples were then subjected to SDS-PAGE analysis followed by either autoradiography or immunoblotting with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies (PY20) and enhanced chemiluminescent imaging. The ability of the somatic cell hybrid 3-1-12 cell line to retain chromosome 21 was assessed using IFNα. For the T41 cells there was no change in human IFNα-induced major histocompatibility class I expression as measured by peak channel fluorescence (134 in untreated cells versus 132 for IFNα treatment). This finding was consistent with the fact that the L929 cells are murine in origin and do not respond to human IFNα (these cells do respond to murine IFNγ). In contrast, the 3-1-12 cell line responded to human IFNα by enhanced peak channel fluorescence from 124 to 141. These data confirmed that chromosome 21 was present within this cell line. In order to ensure that the transfected IFNγRα chain was adequately expressed, both the T41 and the 3-1-12 cell line were examined for the surface expression of IFNγR by measuring the binding of 125I-rIFNγ (Fig. 1). The α chain alone is sufficient to impart an high affinity binding state. Both cell lines expressed approximately similar numbers of binding sites: the T41 cells bound about 6000 molecules/cell, whereas the 3-1-12 cells bound about 5000 molecules/cell. The concentration at half-maximal binding for both cell lines was about 10-10M, which was consistent with a high affinity binding site. The affinity and number of molecules per cell for these cell lines was similar to previously reported values for other cells(19Finbloom D.S. Hoover D.L. Wahl L.M. J. Immunol. 1985; 135: 300-305PubMed Google Scholar). The ability of the two cell lines to signal was examined next by measuring the formation of the IFNγ-activated GRR binding complex, FcRFγ (Fig. 2). In T41 cells only murine IFNγ stimulated the formation of FcRFγ (Fig. 2, lane 5). In contrast both murine (Fig. 2, lane 2) and human IFNγ (Fig. 2, lane 3) resulted in assembly of the FcRFγ complex in 3-1-12 cells. That the intensity of the signal was considerably less for human IFNγ compared with murine IFNγ in the 3-1-12 cell line was probably the result of limited expression and/or association of the β component with the α component of the IFNγR. Since both the Jak1 and Jak2 tyrosine kinases have been shown to be involved in the signal transduction pathway for IFNγ, we next examined whether the α component alone was sufficient for the ligand-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of these tyrosine kinases. Incubation of the 3-1-12 cell line with IFNγ resulted in the tyrosine phosphorylation of both Jak1 (Fig. 3A, lane 2) and Jak2 (Fig. 3B, lane 2). In contrast, in those cells expressing only the α component of the receptor, no tyrosine phosphorylation of Jak1 (Fig. 3A, lane 4) or Jak2 (Fig. 3B, lane 4) was observed. This implied that the α chain alone in spite of being capable of binding ligand with high affinity could not facilitate ligand induced tyrosine phosphorylation of the Jak kinases. When these same cells were examined for the tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT1α in response to IFNγ, the results were similar to that observed for the Jak kinases (Fig. 3C). Only in 3-1-12 cells where a functional α/β receptor unit existed was there human IFNγ-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of the STAT1α (Fig. 3C, lane 3 versus 6). T41 cells that were treated with murine IFNγ exhibited ligand-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Jak1 and Jak2 (data not shown) and STAT1α (Fig. 3C, lane 5). There was no STAT1α tyrosine phosphorylation in response to human IFNγ in the T41 cell line (Fig. 3C, lane 6). Equal amounts of immunoprecipitated protein (Jak1, Jak2, and STAT1α) were loaded onto each lane (Fig. 3, A-C, lower panel).Figure 3:Activation of Jak kinases and STAT1α in response to IFNγ in 3-1-12 and T41 cells.

Garotta G. Ozmen L. Ziemiecki A. Wilks A.F. Harpur A.G. Larner A.C. Finbloom D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14333-14336Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We examined whether the α chain or the β chain was required for this association. Both the T41 and 3-1-12 cell lines were solubilized and subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-IFNγRα chain antibodies. The immunoprecipitates were probed with anti-Jak1 antibodies (Fig. 4). Both the T41 (Fig. 4, lane 3, upper panel) and the 3-1-12 cells (Fig. 4, lane 4, upper panel) had Jak1 constitutively associated with the IFNγRα. The IFNγRα protein was immunoprecipitated equally in both lanes (Fig. 4, lanes 3 and 4, lower panel). Since in T41 cells only the α chain is present, these data suggested that Jak1 preferentially associated with the α component. When a similar experiment was attempted and probed with Jak2, no association was seen in the T41 or the 3-1-12 cells even when these cells were treated with IFNγ (data not shown). Presumably, if Jak2 preferentially associates with the β chain, the poor expression of this gene may account for our inability to detect the association in the 3-1-12 cell line. The lack of association in the T41 cells suggests that Jak2 does not associate with the α chain. Since Jak1 associated with the IFNγ receptor in a untreated cells, we assessed whether this kinase demonstrated catalytic activity as measured by an in vitro kinase assay. Immunoprecipitates prepared with anti-Jak1 and anti-Jak2 antisera were assayed for kinase activity using either [γ-32P]ATP (Fig. 5) or unlabeled ATP followed by phosphotyrosine detection by immunoblotting (Fig. 6). In cells untreated with IFNγ there was a substantial amount of Jak1 kinase activity as judged by autophosphorylation of Jak1 (Fig. 5, lane 3, upper panel). There was no increased activity after treatment with IFNγ (Fig. 5, lane 4, upper panel). In contrast there was no observed Jak2 kinase activity in cells untreated with IFNγ. Only with IFNγ treatment was Jak2 kinase activity observed (Fig. 5, lane 6, upper panel). When the kinased immunoprecipitated Jak1 was subjected to phosphoamino acid analysis, essentially all of the incorporated radioactivity was on tyrosine moieties (data not shown). Equal amounts of the immunoprecipitated Jak kinases were loaded in each lane (Fig. 5, lanes 3-6, lower panel). When the experiment was performed using unlabeled ATP in conjugation with phosphotyrosine analysis by immunoblot, similar results were obtained (Fig. 6). Jak1 demonstrated constitutive tyrosine kinase activity (autophosphorylation) (Fig. 6A, lane 3) with no further increased kinase activity after IFNγ treatment (Fig. 6A, lane 4). On the other hand, Jak2 (Fig. 6A, lane 5 and 6) demonstrated tyrosine kinase activity only after cells had been stimulated with IFNγ. With no ATP present in the assay buffer only the endogenous tyrosine phosphorylation is observed in response to IFNγ (Fig. 6B, lanes 4 and 6).Figure 6:In vitro kinase assay of Jak1 and Jak2 in IFNγ-treated HeLa cells using anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblotting.

Cells were treated with or without IFNγ and then solubilized in digitonin to maintain any protein-protein interactions. The extracts were then immunoprecipitated with antibodies directed against the IFNγRα chain. The immunoprecipitate was then analyzed by an in vitro kinase reaction. In untreated cells (Fig. 7A, lanes 1 and 2) there was tyrosine phosphorylation of the IFNγRα chain (arrow) in the presence of ATP (lane 2). For comparison, the endogenous tyrosine phosphorylation of the IFNγR (arrow) and Jak kinases (asterisk) was measured in response to IFNγ (Fig. 7A, lane 3). When the immunoprecipitates from untreated cells were washed under more stringent conditions with 1% Triton X-100 prior to performing the in vitro kinase assay, the ability to tyrosine-phosphorylate the IFNγR was lost (Fig. 7A, lane 8 versus 6). This suggested that the tyrosine kinase that was responsible for tyrosine phosphorylation of the IFNγRα chain was pre-associated with the IFNγR in a receptor-kinase complex. Since Jak1 was shown to pre-associate with the α chain and be active in untreated cells by an in vitro kinase assay, Jak1 was a likely candidate responsible for the tyrosine phosphorylation of the α chain of receptor. When the anti-IFNγRα chain immunoprecipitates were probed for the presence of Jak1, there was a loss of Jak1 in those cells washed with 1% Triton X-100 (Fig. 7B, lanes 5 and 6 versus 7 and 8) even though total IFNγRα protein was the same (Fig. 7C, lanes 5-8). In order to fully assess the role of the IFNγRβ chain, we raised polyclonal antibodies against a peptide of the β chain consisting of amino acids 307-337 of the intracytoplasmic domain. The reactivity of this affinity-purified antibody was assessed on biosynthetically labeled human peripheral blood monocytes. The IFNγRα chain and other associated chains have been extensively studied in these cells by both radiolabeling and biosynthetic labeling followed by immunoprecipitation (24Finbloom D.S. Wahl L.M. Winestock K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22545-22548Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When monocytes were biosynthetically labeled and the digitonin lysates subjected to immunoprecipitation with the anti-IFNγRβ chain (anti-AF-1), there was a prominent band at about 38 kDa (Fig. 8A, lane 2, arrow) that was not observed with control antibodies (Fig. 8A, lane 1) or antibodies directed against the IFNγRα chain (Fig. 8A, lane 3). A similar band was noted in cells solubilized in 1% Triton X-100 (data not shown). The migration of the immunoprecipitated IFNγRβ chain as a 38-kDa protein is consistent with the predicted amino acid sequence of 310 amino acids with some degree of post-translational modification such as glycosylation. Under the conditions utilized the antibodies against the β chain co-immunoprecipitate the α chain, but antibodies against the α chain only precipitate the α chain and associated Jak kinases (Fig. 8A, lane 3 and Fig. 9, lane 6). The ability of the anti-IFNγRβ antisera to co-immunoprecipitate the α chain of the receptor was directly measured by incubating extracts prepared with digitonin with anti-IFNγRβ and probing the membrane with anti-IFNγRα (Fig. 8B). Under these condition the IFNγRα chain co-immunoprecipitates with the β chain in cells untreated (Fig. 8B, lane 3) or treated (Fig. 8B, lane 4) with IFNγ.Figure 9:The IFNγRβ chain is not tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to IFNγ. HeLa cells were either exposed to IFNγ (lanes 2, 4, and 6) or untreated (lanes 1, 3, and 5) and solubilized in 1% digitonin buffer. The extracts were then incubated with either normal rabbit IgG (nIgG) (lanes 1 and 2), anti-IFNγRβ chain (anti-AF-1) (lanes 3 and 4), or anti-IFNγRα chain (anti-IFNγR) (lanes 5 and 6). The immunoprecipitates were then analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies (PY20). NS, represents nonspecific bands.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In order to examine whether or not the IFNγRβ chain like the α chain undergoes tyrosine phosphorylation in response to the binding of IFNγ to the cells, we treated cells with IFNγ and then solubilized them in digitonin (Fig. 9). Using anti-IFNγRα chain antibody it was evident that the α chain of the receptor was clearly tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to IFNγ (Fig. 9, lane 5 versus 6). In addition, a band migrating slightly slower than the IFNγRα chain at about 130 kDa represented the tyrosine phosphorylated Jak1/2 kinases. This has been confirmed by reprobing the blots with anti-Jak kinase antibodies (data not shown). In contrast, when the anti-IFNγRβ chain antibodies (anti-AF-1) were utilized, there was no observable tyrosine phosphorylation of the β chain (Fig. 9, lane 3 versus 4). However, it was evident that the antibody was indeed immunoprecipitating the receptor complex since the tyrosine-phosphorylated α chain at 90 kDa and the Jak kinases at 130 kDa were present in the immunoprecipitate. In order to ascertain whether Jak2 preferentially associated with the IFNγRβ chain, HeLa cells were either untreated or treated with IFNγ and then solubilized in digitonin. Immunoprecipitates with anti-IFNγRβ were resolved by SDS-PAGE and then immunoblotted with anti-Jak2 (Fig. 10). Jak2 associated with the β chain in a constitutive fashion (Fig. 10, lane 3). However, upon IFNγ signaling there was a consistent increase in the amount of Jak2 that could be co-immunoprecipitated with the β chain, suggesting that recruitment of Jak2 occurred during signal transduction or that the affinity of Jak2 increased for the clustered IFNγR (Fig. 10, lane 4). When antibodies against Jak1 were utilized to probe anti-IFNγRβ immunoprecipitates, no co-immunoprecipitation of Jak1 was detectable (data not shown), suggesting either that there was no direct interaction between Jak1 and the IFNγRβ chain or that the anti-IFNγRβ antibody itself disrupted any weak interaction that may have occurred. Upon activation by IFNγ there is rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT1α. In order to determine if STAT1α could be directly detected within the receptor-Jak complex, we exposed cells to IFNγ at 4°C and then solubilized them in digitonin. The extracts were incubated with anti-STAT1α antibodies and the membranes probed with anti-phosphotyrosine. In cells treated with IFNγ (Fig. 11, lane 4) there were two additional co-immunoprecipitating tyrosine-phosphorylated bands that correspond to the IFNγRα chain and the Jak1/2 kinases both of which can also be shown to be immunoprecipitated with the anti-IFNγR (lane 6). Interferon γ activation of STAT1α requires both Jak1 and Jak2 as well as tyrosine phosphorylation of the α chain of the IFNγ receptor. Although it has been known that another component of the receptor is necessary for signal transduction to occur, only recently has the gene for this accessory factor (β chain) been cloned and shown to encode for a transmembrane protein of 310 amino acids with a 66-amino acid intracytoplasmic domain(9Soh J. Donnelly R.J. Kotenko S. Mariano T.M. Cook J.R. Wang N. Emanuel S. Schwartz B. Miki T. Pestka S. Cell. 1994; 76: 793-802Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 10Hemmi S. Bohni R. Stark G. Di Marco F. Aguet M. Cell. 1994; 76: 803-810Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Nothing is known regarding the role of this protein in the formation of the ligand induced multi-molecular complex. In this report we show that both the α and β components are required to activate STAT proteins. In cells expressing only the α chain, we show that Jak1 constitutively associates with this component but does not become tyrosine-phosphorylated after treatment with IFNγ in spite of high affinity binding of the ligand to the α chain. Only in cells expressing both the α and β component are Jak1 and Jak2 tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to IFNγ treatment. Jak1 pre-associates with the α component and shows no increased association with the receptor after IFNγ treatment. In contrast, Jak2 is pre-associated with the β component, but also is either recruited to the receptor after ligand binding or its affinity for the β chain increases after ligand binding. The data derived from the somatic cell hybrid cells suggest that the association of Jak2 with the receptor β chain is an absolute requirement for subsequent activation of STAT1α by tyrosine phosphorylation. Although the α chain is tyrosine-phosphorylated in IFNγ-treated cells, we have been unable to observe any ligand-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of the β chain. Therefore, it is likely that this component may not directly interact with the STAT proteins as has been proposed to occur for the α chain of the IFNγ receptor (11Greenlund A.C. Farrar M.A. Viviano B.L. Schreiber R.D. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1591-1600Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar) and the ligand binding component of the IL-4 receptor(25Hou J. Schindler U. Henzel W.J. Ho T.C. Brasseur M. McKnight S.L. Science. 1994; 265: 1701-1706Crossref PubMed Scopus (726) Google Scholar). We have also shown that in digitonin-solubilized extracts the α and β components can be co-immunoprecipitated in untreated cells, and therefore, it is likely that dimerization of at least two α•β complexes initiates signal transduction. In untreated cells Jak1 is pre-associated with the α chain and, by in vitro kinase assay, is enzymatically active as measured by autophosphorylation. When the IFNγRα chain is immunoprecipitated and subjected to in vitro kinase assay, the α chain along with the co-immunoprecipitating Jak kinases are tyrosine-phosphorylated in cells unexposed to IFNγ. This suggests that the kinase responsible for the tyrosine phosphorylation of the α chain in vivo is pre-associated with the receptor and may be Jak1. Washing of the anti-IFNγRα immunoprecipitate in 1% Triton X-100 results in loss of the activity and loss of co-immunoprecipitating Jak1. We have shown previously that under similar conditions in untreated cells no detectable Jak2 is immunoprecipitated with the anti-IFNγRα chain (12Igarashi K. Garotta G. Ozmen L. Ziemiecki A. Wilks A.F. Harpur A.G. Larner A.C. Finbloom D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14333-14336Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This finding is similar to that observed with the leukemia inhibitory factor receptor β chain or gp130 of the IL-6 receptor. Both Jak1 and Jak2 are pre-associated with the β components of the IL-6 and leukemia inhibitory factor receptor, and upon immunoprecipitation of the receptors in Brij96 (a detergent with properties similar to digitonin), in vitro tyrosine phosphorylation of the β component is lost after a Nonidet P-40 wash (26Stahl N.

The degree of activation of the Jak kinase itself in cells unexposed to ligand varies depending upon the cells utilized. In the IL-6/leukemia inhibitory factor studies there was slight but perceptible in vitro kinase activity for Jak1 but not Jak2 in untreated cells (26Stahl N. Boulton T.G. Farrugella T. Ip N.Y. Davis S. Witthuhn B.A. Quelle F.W. Silvennoinen O. Barbieri G. Pelligrini S. Ihle J.N. Yancopoulos G.D. Science. 1994; 263: 92-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar). In PHA-activated T cells and factor-starved FWT-2 cells, there was kinase activity of Jak1 in untreated cells that was enhanced after IL-2 treatment(28Miyazaki T. Kawahara A. Fujii H. Nakagawa Y. Mirami Y. Liu Z.-J. Oishi I. Silvennoinen O. Witthuhn B.A. Ihle J.N. Taniguchi T. Science. 1994; 266: 1045-1047Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar, 29Russell S.M. Johnston J.A. Noguichi M. Kawamura M. Bawn C.M. Friedmann M. Berg M. McVicar D.W. Witthuhn B.A. Silvennoinen O. Goldman A.S. Schmalstieg F.C. Ihle J.N. O'Shea J.J. Leonard W.J. Science. 1994; 266: 1042-1045Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar). In untreated MOLTβ cells, there was in vitro tyrosine autophosphorylation of Jak1 that did not increase after IL-2 exposure(29Russell S.M. Johnston J.A. Noguichi M. Kawamura M. Bawn C.M. Friedmann M. Berg M. McVicar D.W. Witthuhn B.A. Silvennoinen O. Goldman A.S. Schmalstieg F.C. Ihle J.N. O'Shea J.J. Leonard W.J. Science. 1994; 266: 1042-1045Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar). Therefore, varying degrees of in vitro kinase activity for Jak1 exist in untreated cells that may or may not be enhanced after ligand stimulation. For receptors utilizing Jak1 and Jak2 or Jak3, it appears that Jak1 rather than Jak2/3 tends to demonstrate more in vitro kinase activity in cells untreated with ligand. These data are consistent with the concept that the initial reaction after clustering of receptors by ligand may allow Jak1 access to substrate. Jak2 activation quickly follows and in addition is recruited to the receptor or binds more tightly to the clustered complex(12Igarashi K. Garotta G. Ozmen L. Ziemiecki A. Wilks A.F. Harpur A.G. Larner A.C. Finbloom D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14333-14336Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is at this point that STAT1α can be shown to become part of the receptor-Jak complex. Most of the Jak/Tyk kinases have been shown to interact with membrane proximal domains (Box1/Box 2 regions) of the cytoplasmic portion of receptors that are present in many cytokine receptors(30Fukunaga R. Ishizaka-Ikeda E. Pan C. Seto Y. Nagata S. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2855-2865Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 31Murakami M. Narazaki M. HIbi M. Yawata H. Yasukawa K. Hamaguchi M. Taga T. Kishimoto T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 11349-11353Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar). However, it is clear that there is differential binding of Jak/Tyk kinases to these regions. Jak1 primarily associates with the α chain and Jak2 with the β chain of the IFNγ receptor. For the IL-2 receptor, Jak1 associates with the serine-rich membrane proximal region of the IL-2Rβ, whereas Jak3 associated with the COOH-terminal region of the γ component, a region mutated in X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency patients who have altered T cell function(28Miyazaki T. Kawahara A. Fujii H. Nakagawa Y. Mirami Y. Liu Z.-J. Oishi I. Silvennoinen O. Witthuhn B.A. Ihle J.N. Taniguchi T. Science. 1994; 266: 1045-1047Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar, 29Russell S.M. Johnston J.A. Noguichi M. Kawamura M. Bawn C.M. Friedmann M. Berg M. McVicar D.W.

In cell lines expressing all three Jak kinases, Jak2 did not associate with the IL-2 receptor. The kinase-specific association to distinct receptor components may be a mechanism for specificity of signal transduction through the Jak/Tyk pathway. The interaction of Jak2 with the β chain of the IFNγR appears to be a requirement for IFNγ signaling. This was also seen for the IL-2Rγc/Jak3 association(28Miyazaki T. Kawahara A. Fujii H. Nakagawa Y. Mirami Y. Liu Z.-J. Oishi I. Silvennoinen O. Witthuhn B.A. Ihle J.N. Taniguchi T. Science. 1994; 266: 1045-1047Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar, 29Russell S.M. Johnston J.A.

Science. 1994; 266: 1042-1045Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar). From our previous studies and the data in this report, it appears that Jak2 is required for the tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT1α, whereas Jak1 is more closely affiliated with the tyrosine phosphorylation of the IFNγRα chain. Therefore, in receptor systems that utilize paired Tyk/Jak kinases, one of the kinases pre-associated with the receptor may facilitate the tyrosine phosphorylation of one or more chains of the receptor, whereas the other kinase may be more responsible for the activation of STAT proteins."

A critical issue in the study of CaM kinase regulation is the molecular mechanism by which these kinases are activated in response to elevations in Ca2+ concentrations. The currently accepted paradigm is a conformational change induced by the stoichiometric binding of Ca2+-CaM, which in turn results in decreased interaction of an autoinhibitory domain with the active site, thereby permitting substrate accessibility. This mechanism is ideally suited to the decoding of rapid Ca2+ transients provoked by extracellular signals and is well understood at the molecular level primarily through studies with myosin light chain kinase and CaM kinase II(22Edelman A.M.

Evidence has now accumulated, based on studies with CaM kinase I and CaM kinase IV, for an important mechanism of CaM kinase activation in addition to Ca2+-CaM-induced relief from autoinhibition. It was reported that Ca2+-CaM-dependent autophosphorylation of purified rat brain CaM kinase I (a-isoform) is accompanied by a dramatic (>10-fold) potentiation of activity and that an activator exists that is separable from CaM kinase Ia during the final steps of the latter's purification(5DeRemer M.F.

Chem. 1992; 267: 13466-13471Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These observations were confirmed for CaM kinase V(29Mochizuki H. Sugita R. Ito T. Hidaka H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 197: 1595-1600Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), a CaM kinase I isoform(9Ito T. Yokokura H. Nairn A.C. Nimura Y. Hidaka H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 201: 1561-1566Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The successful purification of CaM kinase Ia activator from pig brain was recently reported(30Lee J.C. Edelman A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2158-2164Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the presence of the purified activator, CaM kinase Ia is phosphorylated and is activated up to 50-fold. Autophosphorylation-autoactivation, if it occurs at all, does so at an extremely slow rate relative to phosphorylation and activation by the activator(30Lee J.C. Edelman A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2158-2164Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), an observation consistent with the lack of significant autoactivation by bacterially expressed CaM kinase I(8Picciotto M.R. Czernik A.J. Nairn A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26512-26521Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since CaM kinase Ia activator is able to phosphorylate and activate brain CaM kinase Ia inactivated by an irreversible ATP affinity analogue or a kinase-negative mutant of recombinant CaM kinase I, it may be concluded that the activator is itself a protein kinase, that is, a CaM kinase I kinase(31Lee J.C. Edelman A.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 210: 631-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). 2,3 2Haribabu, B., Hook, S. S., Selbert, M. A., Goldstein, E. G., Tomhave, E.

In similar fashion to CaM kinase I, purified rat brain CaM kinase IV was reported to be subject to Ca2+-CaM-dependent autophosphorylation resulting in activation(32Frangakis M.V. Ohmstede C.A.

Compared with the brain enzyme, recombinant CaM kinase IV expressed in bacterial or insect cells has high Km values for substrates, slowly autophosphorylates, and demonstrates minimal activation(19Cruzalegui F.H.

However, phosphorylation and activation of recombinant CaM kinase IV was found to be markedly stimulated by the addition of rat brain extract (35Okuno S. Fujisawa H. J.

Thus, CaM kinases I and IV appear to be regulated by either common or highly related kinase kinases. We also report that replacement of Thr-196 of CaM kinase IV with Ala by site-directed mutagenesis prevents both phosphorylation and activation, indicating that Thr-196 phosphorylation is essential for activation. Syntide-2 was purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. GS10 was generously provided by Dr. Bruce Kemp (St. Vincent's Institute for Medical Research, Melbourne, Australia). Porcine and chicken calmodulin were obtained from Boehringer Mannheim or produced by bacterial expression(38Putkey J.A. Slaughter G.R. Means A.R. J. Biol.

The cDNA encoding rat brain CaM kinase IV was subcloned as a pGCaMKIV (15Means A.R. Cruzalegui F.H. LeMagueresse B. Needleman D.S. Slaughter G.R. Ono T. Mol. Cell.

Recombinant protein was then expressed from pGEXCaMKIV in E. coli strain BL21 (DE3) as a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein and purified using glutathione-Sepharose. T196A mutant cDNA was constructed as follows. A 659-base pair cDNA fragment was prepared from a 30-cycle polymerase chain reaction using pGCaMKIV as template, an oligonucleotide primer (sense) overlapping a SacI site (5’ CAC TAT AGG GCG AAT TCG AGC TCG GAC CCG GCG AAG ATG 3’), and, an oligonucleotide primer (antisense) overlapping a SmaI site that introduces the point mutation indicated by boldface type (5’ AAT CTC AGG TGC ACA GTA CCC CGG GGT TCC ACA CAC CGC CTT CAT GAG 3’). The 659-base pair polymerase chain reaction product was subcloned as a SacI/SmaI fragment into the SacI/SmaI sites of pGCaMKIV to generate pGCaMKIVT196A. After confirming the presence of the mutated base and the correct ligation junctions by nucleotide sequence analysis using U.S. Biochemical Corp. Sequenase version 2.0 DNA sequencing kit and custom-designed oligonucleotides, the mutant cDNA was subcloned into pGEX-3XMCS and expressed and purified as described above. CaM kinase Ia kinase was purified from pig brain by a procedure previously described in detail(30Lee J.C. Edelman A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2158-2164Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), modified by reversal of the order of the CaM-Sepharose and phenyl-Sepharose chromatographic steps and by omission of the hydroxylapatite chromatographic step. Rat brain was homogenized with a Potter-Elvehjem homogenizer in 3 volumes of a buffer containing 5 mM Tris, pH 7.5 (at 4°C), 0.1 mM DTT, 10 εg/ml antipain, 10 εg/ml leupeptin, 10 εg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 εg/ml trypsin inhibitor. After centrifugation of the homogenate at 100,000 × g at 4°C, the supernatant was desalted over Sephadex G-25 and stored in small aliquots at −70°C. The activity of CaM kinase IV was assayed at 30°C using either Syntide-2 or GS10 as substrate as indicated in the figure legends. Syntide-2 kinase activity was measured by incubation in a mixture containing 50 mM Tris, pH 7.6, 1 mM CaCl2, 1 εM CaM, 0.5 mM DTT, 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 10 mM MgCl2, 200 εM [γ-32P]ATP (∼0.2 × 103 cpm/pmol), and 50 or 100 εM Syntide-2. GS10 kinase activity was measured by incubation in a mixture containing 50 mM Hepes, pH 7.5, 1 mM CaCl2, 1 εM CaM, 30 εM PKI-tide, 10 mM MgCl2, 50 or 200 εM [γ-32P]ATP (0.1-1.2 × 103 cpm/pmol), and 40-50 εM GS10. Quantitation of 32P incorporation into peptides was determined by their binding to P81 phosphocellulose paper as described previously(5DeRemer M.F. Saeli R.J. Edelman A.M. J. Biol.

The membrane was then rinsed in deionized water, dried, and autoradiographed. Using the autoradiogram as template, the polyvinylidene difluoride strip containing 32P-labeled CaM kinase IV was excised from the blot, rinsed successively in methanol and water, and hydrolyzed in 6 N HCl (110°C, 1 h) under vacuum. The 32P-labeled phosphoamino acids were dried, resuspended in deionized water containing phosphoamino acid standards, and subjected to two-dimensional separation by ascending chromatography in 2-propanol:HCl:H2O (7:1.5:1.5) followed by high voltage electrophoresis (500 V, 140 min) in 7.5% acetic acid, 2.85% formic acid, pH 1.9. The standards and 32P-labeled phosphoamino acids were identified by ninhydrin staining and autoradiography, respectively. For relative quantitation of 32P incorporation, the cellulose corresponding to each phosphoamino acid was scraped from the plate using the autoradiogram as a template and counted in Ready-solve CP (Beckman) after extraction in methanol. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed as described previously(19Cruzalegui F.H. Means A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26171-26178Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Lee J.C.

Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216033) Google Scholar). CaM kinase Ia kinase concentration was determined by a colloidal gold staining method(30Lee J.C. Edelman A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2158-2164Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). CaM was quantified by spectrophotometry (EM,277nm = 3300). The activity of recombinant CaM kinase IV is enhanced 24-fold to a specific activity of 1.7 εmol min-1 mg-1 by the presence of purified pig brain CaM kinase Ia kinase (Fig. 1). Unlike CaM kinase Ia, which remains fully Ca2+-CaM-dependent in the activated state(6DeRemer M.F. Saeli R.J. Brautigan D.L. Edelman A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13466-13471Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Lee J.C. Edelman A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2158-2164Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), CaM kinase IV activation is accompanied by the development of significant (38%) Ca2+-CaM-independent activity. The time course and requirements for the activation of CaM kinase IV are illustrated in Fig. 2. As shown, the combined presence of CaM kinase Ia kinase, Ca2+-CaM, and MgATP is necessary for full activation to occur. The mechanism underlying the Ca2+-CaM-requirement for activator responsiveness, a phenomenon also observed for CaM kinase Ia(6DeRemer M.F. Saeli R.J. Brautigan D.L. Edelman A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13466-13471Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Lee J.C. Edelman A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2158-2164Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), is under active investigation in our laboratories.Figure 2:Time course and requirements for CaM kinase IV activation. Recombinant CaM kinase IV, expressed in Sf9 cells and purified as described under “Experimental Procedures” (0.8 εg/ml), was preincubated in the presence (closedsymbols) or absence (opensymbols) of CaM kinase Ia kinase (0.1 εg/ml) for the indicated time periods of preincubation, at 30°C, with the following additions (as final concentrations; CaCl2 and MgCl2 are given as concentrations in excess of EGTA and EDTA concentrations, respectively): 10 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM ATP (squares); 1 mM CaCl2, 1 εM CaM (triangles); or 10 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM ATP, 1 mM CaCl2, 1 εM CaM (circles). Peptide kinase activity was then measured using Syntide-2 as substrate in the presence of Ca2+ (1 mM in excess of EGTA) and CaM (1 εM) as described under “Experimental Procedures” for 1-2 min. For background subtractions under each condition, activity in the absence of preincubation (zero time of preincubation) has been subtracted to control for activation occurring during the assay itself, and where appropriate, the activity of CaM kinase Ia kinase alone has also been subtracted. Each point represents the mean of duplicate determinations.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Based on the MgATP requirement for activation, we investigated whether CaM kinase IV is phosphorylated in the presence of CaM kinase Ia kinase. As shown in Fig. 3, CaM kinase IV is phosphorylated in a reaction requiring (in addition to MgATP), CaM kinase Ia kinase and Ca2+-CaM. The identical requirements for both activation and phosphorylation suggest that activation of CaM kinase IV is caused by its Ca2+-CaM-dependent phosphorylation by CaM kinase Ia kinase. Consistent with this mechanism is a linear relationship between the extent of phosphorylation and state of activation of CaM kinase IV (Fig. 4). The maximal extent of 32P incorporation achieved (6.5 ± 1.7 mol of 32P/mol of CaM kinase IV) demonstrated some variability between experiments but indicates multiple sites of phosphorylation. Phosphoserine is the predominant phosphoamino acid detected with a ratio of serine to threonine phosphorylation of 2.7 (± 0.6):1 (Fig. 5).Figure 4:Relationship between the phosphorylation and activation states of CaM kinase IV. Recombinant CaM kinase IV, expressed in Sf9 cells and purified as described under “Experimental Procedures” (2.8 or 4.9 εg/ml), and CaM kinase Ia kinase (0.5 εg/ml) were preincubated in a total volume of 76 εl at 30°C, in a mixture containing 50 mM Tris, pH 7.6, 1 mM CaCl2, 1 εM CaM, 0.5 mM DTT, 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 10 mM MgCl2, and 20 εM [γ-32P]ATP (∼7 × 103 cpm/pmol). At five time points over a period of 2 h, replicate aliquots of the reaction mixture were separately and simultaneously analyzed for the states of activation and phosphorylation of CaM kinase IV. CaM kinase IV activation state was assessed by Syntide-2 kinase activity in the presence of Ca2+-CaM, utilizing background subtractions as described in the legend to Fig. 2. The phosphorylation of CaM kinase IV was determined by applying 8-εl aliquots of the preincubation reaction mixture to 2 × 2 cm squares of 3MM filter paper (Whatman). Squares were then washed once for 30 min at 0°C in 10% trichloroacetic acid containing 2% sodium pyrophosphate followed by two washes for 15 min each in 5% trichloroacetic acid at 22°C and dried with 95% ethanol. 32P-incorporation was quantified by liquid scintillation counting with subtraction of a CaM kinase Ia kinase alone condition as background. Results are expressed as the linear regression of activation versus phosphorylation after normalization to the maximal extent of both achieved. Each point represents the mean of duplicate determinations. Linear regression was performed using Sigmaplot version 1.02 (Jandel Scientific).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 5:Phosphoamino acid analysis of phosphorylated CaM kinase IV. Recombinant CaM kinase IV, expressed in Sf9 cells and purified as described under “Experimental Procedures” (21 εg/ml), was incubated with CaM kinase Ia kinase (1 εg/ml) for 15 min., at 30°C, in a mixture containing 25 mM Tris, pH 7.6, 1 mM CaCl2, 1 εM CaM, 0.5 mM DTT, 10 mM MgCl2, and 20 εM [γ-32P]ATP (13 × 104 cpm/pmol). The reaction was terminated by boiling in SDS-β-mercaptoethanol dissociation solution and electrophoresed in a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. 32P-labeled CaM kinase IV was then subjected to phosphoamino acid analysis by two-dimensional, ascending chromatography/high voltage electrophoresis as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The positions of phosphotyrosine (PY), phosphoserine (PS), and phosphothreonine (PT) are indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Parallel studies in our laboratories have established that the phosphorylation of Thr-177 of recombinant CaM kinase I by CaM kinase Ia kinase is essential for CaM kinase I activation.2 In addition, Sugita et al.(42Sugita R. Mochizuki H. Ito T. Yokokura H. Kobayashi R. Hidaka H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 203: 694-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) reported that Thr-177 of CaM kinase V is a phosphorylation site for a CaM kinase kinase preparation. With this information as rationale, we addressed the critical question of the phosphorylation site(s) responsible for CaM kinase IV activation through site-directed mutagenesis of the equivalent amino acid residue in CaM kinase IV, Thr-196. As shown in Fig. 6 and 7, replacement of Thr-196 with a nonphosphorylatable alanine abolishes both the phosphorylation and activation of CaM kinase IV by CaM kinase Ia kinase. Thr-196 phosphorylation is thus absolutely required for CaM kinase IV activation to occur. Finally, despite the maximal extent of activation achievable (>20-fold, Fig. 1), there remained a possibility that additional components necessary for full activation are lost during CaM kinase Ia kinase purification. As shown in Fig. 8, although rat brain extract is capable of activating recombinant CaM kinase IV, this effect is no longer observed after activation by CaM kinase Ia kinase. These results indicate that purified CaM kinase Ia kinase is sufficient for full activation of CaM kinase IV. In a number of respects, the responses of CaM kinases Ia and IV to CaM kinase Ia kinase are virtually identical. Both kinases are maximally activated >20-fold in reactions requiring CaM kinase Ia kinase, Ca2+-CaM, and MgATP, and both are phosphorylated with these same requirements. Nonetheless, we have observed several prominent differences between the two CaM kinases. The first is that while the activity of CaM kinase Ia is completely Ca2+-CaM-dependent after activation(6DeRemer M.F. Saeli R.J. Brautigan D.L. Edelman A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13466-13471Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Lee J.C. Edelman A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2158-2164Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), CaM kinase IV develops significant (∼38%) Ca2+-CaM-independent activity as a result of activation. Second, while incubation of CaM kinase Ia with CaM kinase Ia kinase in the presence of Ca2+-CaM and MgATP results in phosphorylation almost exclusively on threonine(5DeRemer M.F. Saeli R.J. Edelman A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13460-13465Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Lee J.C. Edelman A.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 210: 631-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), incubation of CaM kinase IV under the same conditions leads to the phosphorylation of multiple serine and threonine residues with a Ser-P/Thr-P ratio of ∼3:1 (Fig. 5). These observations are similar to those of McDonald et al.(43McDonald O.B. Merrill B.M. Bland M.M. Taylor L.C.E. Sahyoun N. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10054-10059Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) who reported multiple CaM kinase IV autophosphorylation sites with serine the predominant phosphoamino acid detected. Since there is no significant phosphorylation of the T196A mutant enzyme (Fig. 6), most of the observed 32P-incorporatio"

Aspartic and glutamic acid residues were neutralized in clusters of 2 to 4 amino acids throughout the τ1 domain. The activity of the mutant proteins was determined using transactivation assays in yeast and mammalian cells. Some acidic residues in the core region of τ1 appear to play a minor role in τ1 activity, but, generally, individual acidic residues are not critical for activity. Mutagenesis of five serine residues that are phosphorylated in the mouse glucocorticoid receptor and which are conserved in the human receptor did not affect the transactivation activity of the τ1 domain in yeast. As in mouse cells, these serine residues are the predominant sites of phosphorylation for ectopically expressed receptor in yeast, since the mutant protein lacking all five sites had a severely reduced phosphorylation level. Mutant proteins in which larger numbers of acidic residues are neutralized show a progressive decrease in activity indicating that acidity in general is important for τ1 function. However, our results are not consistent with the “acid blob” theory of transactivator function that has been suggested for some other activator proteins.

Binding of glucocorticoid steroid hormones transforms the receptor to an active form that is able to bind to specific glucocorticoid response elements within target genes and subsequently to activate or repress gene activity(1Evans R.M.

FASEB J. 1991; 5: 2243-2249Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). The GR has a modular structure such that different functions are often performed by independent domains within the protein. Thus, protein domains that are competent for steroid binding, DNA binding, and transactivation can be separated on independent protein segments. Two regions of the human glucocorticoid receptor that are important for transcriptional activation by DNA-bound receptor have been identified. These transactivation domains were named τ1 (residues 77-262) and τ2 (residues 526-556)(6Hollenberg S.M. Evans R.M.

Transactivation domains have been classified into different classes depending on their amino acid composition. Thus, transactivation domains rich in glutamine, proline, and acidic amino acids have been identified(10Mitchell P.J. Tjian R. Science. 1989; 245: 371-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (2210) Google Scholar). The τ1 domain of the GR contains a high proportion of aspartic and glutamic acid residues suggesting that it belongs to the acidic class of activators. Indeed, some degree of correlation between acidity and activity of different GR derivatives has been reported(8Danielsen M. Northrop J.P. Jonklaas J. Ringold G.M. Mol Endocrinol. 1987; 1: 816-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Furthermore, squelching studies suggest a functional similarity between the τ1 domain and the classical acidic activator VP16, from herpes simplex virus(11Tasset D. Tora L. Fromental C. Scheer E. Chambon P. Cell. 1990; 62: 1177-1187Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Identification of phosphorylated amino acids in the mouse GR (12Bodwell J.E. Orti E. Coull J.M. Pappin D.J.C. Smith L.I. Swift F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7549-7555Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) suggests that the acidity of the τ1 domain is increased further by phosphorylation. A role for acidity in transactivation by the τ1 domain is also suggested by the high density of acidic and phosphorylated residues found in the recently identified functional core of the τ1 domain(13Dahlman-Wright K. Almlöf T. McEwan I.J. Gustafsson J.-Å. Wright A.P.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1619-1623Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The lack of precise transactivation domain end points in deletion studies of the GAL4 (14Ma J. Ptashne M. Cell. 1987; 48: 847-853Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar) and GCN4 (15Hope I.A. Mahadevan S. Struhl K. Nature. 1988; 333: 635-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar) yeast activators led to the “acid blob” concept(16Sigler P.B. Nature. 1988; 333: 210-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar), according to which acidic transactivation domains do not adopt a defined structure but rather function by general ionic interactions with target proteins. More recent studies question this model. First, mutagenesis studies on the VP16 activator showed that while acidic residues were important for function, key hydrophobic amino acids were also crucial for activity(17Cress W.D. Triezenberg S.J. Science. 1991; 251: 87-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar, 18Regier J.L. Shen F. Triezenberg S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 883-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar), suggesting that general ionic interactions are not sufficient for transactivation activity. Second, mutagenesis studies of the adenovirus E1A activator also showed that acidity is not the most important determinant of activity(19Martin J.K. Lillie J.W. Green M.R. Nature. 1990; 346: 147-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Third, similar conclusions have been drawn from genetic studies of the yeast GAL4 transcriptional activator protein(20Leuther K.K. Salmeron J.M. Johnston S.A. Cell. 1993; 72: 575-585Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Finally, structural studies have recently shown that the GCN4(21Van Hoy M. Leuther K.K. Kodadek T. Johnston S.A.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the role of acidic and phosphorylated amino acids in the transactivation activity of the τ1 domain of the GR. A SacI fragment encoding residues 77-262 of the human GR was removed from plasmid pKV-GRDBD (25Zilliacus J. Dahlman-Wright K. Wright A. Gustafsson J.-Å. Carlstedt-Duke J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3101-3106Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and cloned into the SacI site of M13mp18. Single-stranded DNA was prepared as a substrate for in vitro mutagenesis. Point mutations were created by oligonucleotide-directed in vitro mutagenesis using the methods of Eckstein (26; Amersham, plc) or Kunkel(27Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4560) Google Scholar, 28Geisselsoder M.C. Clary J.A. Witney F. BioTechniques. 1989; 7: 282-289PubMed Google Scholar). Mutants were identified and checked by sequencing the entire τ1 insert. The τ1 insert was cloned into SacI-digested pKVXE(29Wright A.P.H. McEwan I.J. Dahlman-Wright K. Gustafsson J.-Å. Mol. Endocrinol. 1991; 5: 1366-1372Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The resulting plasmids express mutant τ1 domains (residues 77-262) coupled to the GR DBD (residues 370-500). Expression plasmids were transformed into Saccharomyces cerevisiae, strain W303-IA(30Wright A.P.H. Carlstedt-Duke J. Gustafsson J.-Å. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14763-14769Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), according to Beggs(31Beggs J. Nature. 1978; 275: 104-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar). Transformants were mated with yeast strain K396-11B (30Wright A.P.H. Carlstedt-Duke J. Gustafsson J.-Å. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14763-14769Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) containing the reporter plasmid pLGZ-TAT(30Wright A.P.H. Carlstedt-Duke J. Gustafsson J.-Å. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14763-14769Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Diploid strains were grown to stationary phase at 30°C in minimal medium containing 3% glycerol and 1% ethanol as carbon sources, lacking uracil and leucine. Cells were diluted with the same medium containing 2% galactose to a density of about A600 = 0.3 to induce expression of τ1-DBD proteins. Cells were harvested after 5 h. Protein extracts were prepared and assayed for β-galactosidase activity and protein concentration(30Wright A.P.H. Carlstedt-Duke J. Gustafsson J.-Å. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14763-14769Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). β-Galactosidase activity was measured as nanomoles of o-nitrophenyl-β-O-galactoside substrate converted per min per mg of protein and expressed relative to the wild type level. Equivalent amounts of each protein extract were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose filters (32Burnette W.N. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 112: 195-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (5927) Google Scholar). Filters were blocked with 5% milk powder and incubated with monoclonal antibodies against the GR (1 εg/ml) in PBS + 0.5% Tween 80 and 1% milk powder for 60 min at room temperature. After washing (PBS + 0.5% Tween 80), the filters were incubated with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-mouse rabbit IgG (0.22 εg/ml); DaKopatts A/S, Glostrup, Denmark) in PBS + 0.5% Tween 80 for 30 min. After washing, the blot was developed using a colorimetric substrate (Promega Corp.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Mutant τ1 domains were amplified by polymerase chain reaction using Vent DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs) from pKV-τ1GRDBD as BglII fragments and cloned into a derivative of CMVhGRα from which a BglII fragment encoding τ1 had been deleted. The pCMVhGRα (gift from Katrin Hecht, Dept. of Medical Nutrition, Karolinska Institute) is a derivative of CMV4 (33Andersson S. Davis D.L. Dahlbäck H. Jörnvall H. Russell D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 264: 8222-8229Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar) in which the intact hGR protein is expressed from the CMV promoter. COS7 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and antibiotics. Nonsaturating amounts of expression plasmids (0.3 εg) were cotransfected together with 5 εg of the reporter plasmid, p19LUC-TK, into COS7 cells at 80% confluency using the transfection reagent DOTAP (Boehringer Mannheim) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Transfections were performed in triplicate. p19LUC-TK (gift from Paul T. van der Saag, Hubrecht Laboratory, Netherlands Institute for Developmental Biology) is a modified version of pG29LtkCAT (34Schule R.

Science. 1988; 242: 1418-1420Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar) containing 2 glucocorticoid response element binding sites upstream of a truncated thymidine kinase promoter linked to the luciferase gene. 1 εM dexamethasone (Sigma) was added 24 h after transfection, and the cells were then incubated for an additional 24 h prior to measurement of luciferase activity(35Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Extracts containing wild type and mutant τ1-DBD proteins, extracted in buffer (40 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 10% glycerol, 10 mM dithiothreitol, 50 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mM leupeptin, 10 mM trypsin inhibitor), were incubated in the presence or absence of 2 to 4 units of alkaline phosphatase (Boehringer Mannheim) and with or without phosphatase inhibitors (5 mM EDTA and 5 mM Na2HPO4) at 37°C for 60 min. Extracts were resolved by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted as described above. Cells from an overnight culture, grown in minimal medium with 2% glucose as carbon source and lacking leucine and uracil, were diluted in the same medium, except that 3% glycerol and 1% ethanol were used as the carbon sources. The cultures were incubated for 24 h at 30°C to give a final cell density of about A600 = 0.5. The cells were washed in 20 ml of phosphate-free YP medium (1% yeast extract, 1% Bacto-peptone) and resuspended in 10 ml of the same medium, containing 3% glycerol, 1% ethanol, and 2% galactose, to a cell density of A600 = 0.3. Phosphate-free medium was produced by the addition of 130 mM NH4OH and 10 mM MgSO4. After stirring for 30 min, the resulting precipitate was removed by filtration and the pH of the medium was adjusted to 6.25 with HCl prior to autoclaving. The cultures were shaken at 30°C for 1.5 h. 100 εCi of [32P]orthophosphate (Amersham) was then added to the medium and incubation continued for an additional 3.5 h. The cells were harvested, washed three times with water, and resuspended in 0.15 ml of buffer (120 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, 10 mM KCl, 1 mM MgSO4, 2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 εg/ml leupeptin, 100 εg/ml DNase I, 100 εg/ml RNase A). Cell-free protein extracts were prepared by shaking vigorously with an equal volume of glass beads (0.5 mm diameter) for 20 min, mixing with 100 εl of fresh buffer, and centrifugation in a Microfuge for 10 min. 50-100 εg of extract was mixed with an equal volume of a slurry, containing Sepharose beads coupled to receptor-specific or control monoclonal antibodies and incubated on ice for 1 h with occasional mixing. Beads were pelleted by centrifugation at 2000 rpm in a Microfuge for 5 s and washed three times with 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing increasing NaCl concentrations (50 mM, 300 mM, and 1000 mM, respectively). Proteins were eluted from the beads by addition of 50-100 εl of 1 × SDS-PAGE loading buffer followed by incubation at 100°C for 10 min. The eluates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography using XAR film (Kodak). Quantification was performed using a BAS 2000 phosphoimager (Fuji). To test the importance of acidic residues for the activity of the τ1 transactivation domain of the GR, we have used in vitro mutagenesis to change glutamate and aspartate residues to glutamine and asparagine, respectively. The acidic residues were mutated in clusters that could be spanned by individual mutagenic primers giving rise to a series of τ1 derivatives (TA1 to TA8) in which between two and four adjacent acidic residues have been neutralized (Fig. 1). The mutated τ1 domains were expressed as fusion proteins with the GR DBD and tested for their ability to activate a GR responsive lacZ reporter gene in yeast(29Wright A.P.H. McEwan I.J. Dahlman-Wright K. Gustafsson J.-Å. Mol. Endocrinol. 1991; 5: 1366-1372Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Fig. 2A shows that the TA1 to TA8 mutations cause a relatively small, if any, loss of transactivation activity. Furthermore, Fig. 2B shows that none of the mutants are substantially overexpressed compared to the wild type protein which might otherwise have led to an overestimation of their transactivation activity. The TA4 mutation causes the most pronounced defect, showing only 40% of the wild type level. Interestingly, the residues mutated in TA4 (Asp-187, Asp-192, Asp-196, and Glu-198) lie within the functional core of the τ1 domain(13Dahlman-Wright K. Almlöf T. McEwan I.J. Gustafsson J.-Å. Wright A.P.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1619-1623Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The activity of the remaining mutants ranges between 55% (TA7) and 125% (TA3) of the wild type level. From this analysis we conclude that individual acidic amino acids are not critical for the transactivation activity of the τ1 domain although some acidic residues appear to play a minor role. It remained a possibility that acidity in general is an important component of τ1 activity, but, due to the redundancy of acidic amino acids, this requirement was not exposed using relatively limited mutations such as those in TA1 to TA8. To address this question, we made more extreme mutant derivatives of τ1 containing different combinations of the mutant residues that were mutated in TA1 to TA8. These mutants have a much more severe effect on activity (Fig. 3A). Transactivation activity is lost progressively as the number of acidic residues that are neutralized increases. This downward trend tails off at about 10% of wild type activity in mutants in which 60% or more of the acidic residues in τ1 have been neutralized. Thus, we conclude that overall acidity is important for the transactivation activity of τ1. Possible interpretations of this result are given under “Discussion.” To confirm that results obtained for the isolated τ1 domain in yeast cells are relevant for the intact receptor in mammalian cells, we wanted to test the effect of acidic residue mutations in the τ1 domain in the context of the full length GR. Wild type GR protein and a set of GR proteins with mutated τ1 domains were analyzed in COS7 cells for their ability to transactivate a cotransfected luciferase reporter gene controlled by two glucocorticoid response element binding sites. Fig. 3B shows that the mutant GR proteins exhibit essentially the same rank order of transactivation activity in mammalian cells as was observed for the isolated τ1 domain in yeast. However, the mutations reduce transactivation activity to a lesser extent in the intact receptor, presumably due to the activity of other transactivation domains in the intact GR that are not affected by mutations in τ1. The close correspondence of the results from yeast and mammalian cells supports the notion that similar transactivation mechanisms are employed by the GR in both systems. Five of the seven phosphorylation sites that have been identified in the mouse GR are conserved in mammals and are located within the τ1 domain(12Bodwell J.E. Orti E. Coull J.M. Pappin D.J.C. Smith L.I. Swift F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7549-7555Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since phosphorylation of these serines would contribute considerably to the acidity of τ1, we wished to determine the extent to which phosphorylation is important for transactivation activity. We first determined whether τ1 was phosphorylated in yeast. This was done by pulse labeling strains expressing either τ1 (Fig. 4A, lanes 1 and 2) or τ1-DBD (lanes 3 and 4) with [32P]orthophosphate. The expressed proteins were immunoprecipitated with the GR specific monoclonal antibody mAb 250 (lanes 1 and 3) or a nonspecific antibody (lanes 2 and 4) and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The autoradiograph shows that both τ1-DBD and τ1 are phosphorylated in yeast cells, and, thus, phosphorylation could contribute to the transactivation activity as measured in yeast. To determine whether phosphorylation of the five conserved serine residues within τ1 are important for the activity of τ1, we constructed a mutant in which each of the five serines is mutated to alanine (TP1-5, Fig. 1). We also constructed three mutants, TP3, TP4, and TP5, in which individual serine residues were replaced by alanine. The only mutant that shows a significantly reduced transactivation activity is TP3 (Fig. 4B). However, this is probably due to the low level of expressed τ1-DBD protein seen in this strain (Fig. 4C, lane 2). Consistent with this, the TP1-5 mutant, which contains the TP3 mutation, is expressed well and is not defective in activity. We conclude that phosphorylation of the five conserved serines plays little, if any, role in the transactivation activity measured. A role for phosphorylation remained a possibility since the identity of the τ1 residues phosphorylated in yeast had not been determined and in general it cannot be excluded that phosphorylation of other residues occurs if the preferred phosphorylation sites are mutated. However, Fig. 4C shows that the migration of the TP1-5 mutant protein is faster than the wild type protein during SDS-PAGE. This would be consistent with underphosphorylation of the mutant protein. To investigate this further, yeast extracts containing wild type and TP1-5 mutant τ1-DBD proteins were incubated with increasing concentrations of alkaline phosphatase in the presence or absence of phosphatase inhibitors (Fig. 5A). Alkaline phosphatase treatment of τ1-DBD converts it to a faster migrating species in a dose-dependent fashion (Fig. 5A, lanes 1-3). This is not observed in the presence of phosphatase inhibitors (Fig. 5A, lanes 4-6), strongly suggesting that the migration changes result from dephosphorylation of the τ1-DBD protein. The migration of the TP1-5 mutant protein did not change upon alkaline phosphatase treatment (lanes 7-12), suggesting that it was largely devoid of phosphate residues that could serve as substrates for phosphatase action. To measure the phosphorylation level of the TP1-5 mutant protein directly, cells expressing either the wild type protein or the mutant TP1-5 protein were labeled with [32P]orthophosphate, and the expressed proteins were immunoprecipitated using the GR specific monoclonal mAb 250. The autoradiograph in Fig. 5B shows a much lower level of 32P incorporation for the TP1-5 mutant protein compared to the wild type protein. The relatively high background in Fig. 5B makes it difficult to quantify the level of the mutant protein but even according to our most conservative estimate, it contains only about 30% of the wild type phosphate level. Fig. 5C shows that the amount of protein precipitated was very similar for the wild type and TP1-5 mutant proteins. In summary, our data show that mutations of the five serines that are phosphorylated in the region of the mouse GR corresponding to the τ1 domain severely reduces phosphorylation of the τ1-DBD protein in yeast. However, the reduced phosphorylation does not result in reduced transactivation activity, and, thus, phosphorylation is not crucial for maximal transactivation by the τ1 domain in yeast. The first important conclusion from this study is that neutralization of 2 to 4 adjacent acidic amino acid residues throughout the τ1 domain have minimal if any effects on its transactivation activity. The greatest effect was caused by the TA4 mutant that maps to the recently identified core region of the τ1 domain(13Dahlman-Wright K. Almlöf T. McEwan I.J. Gustafsson J.-Å. Wright A.P.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1619-1623Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). A similar effect of the TA4 mutant is also seen in COS7 cells indicating that the core region is also important in mammalian cells. Thus, one or more of the acidic residues at position Asp-187, Asp-192, Asp-196, and Glu-198 might play a role in the activity of the τ1 core domain, which has been shown to include interaction with the general transcriptional machinery(36McEwan I.J. Wright A.P.H. Dahlman-Wright K. Carlstedt-Duke J. Gustafsson J.-Å. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 399-407Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These data are analogous to previous findings for the viral and yeast activator proteins, VP16 (17Cress W.D. Triezenberg S.J. Science. 1991; 251: 87-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar) and GAL4(20Leuther K.K. Salmeron J.M. Johnston S.A. Cell. 1993; 72: 575-585Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), respectively. In each case, individual acidic residues could also be mutated without causing major effects on activity. In VP16, mutations of specific hydrophobic residues caused much greater effects(17Cress W.D. Triezenberg S.J. Science. 1991; 251: 87-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar, 18Regier J.L. Shen F. Triezenberg S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 883-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation also contributes to acidity. The τ1 domain contains the 5 conserved serine residues that are phosphorylated in mouse GR. Our mutants, in which serines have been mutated to alanine, suggest that phosphorylation of these serine residues contributes little, if anything, to the transactivation activity of the isolated τ1 domain in yeast. This is consistent with a recent report in which equivalent mutations did not affect the activity of the intact mouse GR in mammalian cells(37Mason S.A. Housley P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21501-21504Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, as shown in recent studies of the 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 receptor (38Hilliard IV, G.M. Cook R.G. Weigel N.L. Pike J.W. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 4300-4311Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), one cannot exclude that phosphorylation occurs on alternative residues when the primary sites have been mutated. Furthermore, although we showed that τ1 is phosphorylated in yeast, we had no initial expectation that phosphorylation of the same serine residues would occur in yeast as in mouse. Two lines of evidence suggest that the phosphorylation pattern in yeast is similar to that reported for mouse. First, the migration of τ1-DBD protein during electrophoresis is increased in the TP1-5 mutant in which all 5 serine residues are mutated to alanine. A similar migration change for the wild type protein can be specifically induced by phosphatase treatment. Second, 32P incorporation experiments show directly that the phosphate content of the TP1-5 mutant protein is severely reduced in comparison to wild type. Thus, the majority of phosphorylation occurs on the same residues in both yeast and mammalian cells. A similar observation has recently been reported for the chicken progesterone receptor where the phosphorylation pattern for ectopically expressed receptor in yeast closely mimicked that seen in chick oviduct(39Poletti A. Conneely O.M. Mc Donnell D.P. Schrader W.T. O'Malley B.W. Weigel N.L. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9563-9569Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Our data showing that phosphorylation levels of τ1 do not correlate with its transactivation activity suggest a role for phosphorylation in some other aspect of τ1 structure or function. A role of phosphorylation in nuclear cytoplasmic shuttling of the GR has been suggested(40Orti E. Mendel D.B. Smith L.I. Bodwell J.E. Munck A. J. Steroid Biochem. 1989; 34: 85-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Our data would suggest that evolutionarily conserved protein kinases might be involved, and, interestingly, some of the phosphorylation sites are potential substrates for p34cdc2 protein kinase which is critical in cell cycle regulation and is functionally conserved between yeasts and humans (41Lee M.G. Nurse P. Nature. 1987; 327: 31-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (765) Google Scholar). The conclusion that the acidity of individual amino acid residues, resulting from either the acidity of their side chains or from phosphorylation, is not critical for the molecular interactions underlying transactivation does not exclude the acid blob mechanism of acidic activator action. According to this model, acidic activators do not have a defined structure and interact with target factors via general ionic interactions(16Sigler P.B. Nature. 1988; 333: 210-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). Alternatively, acidic activation domains may form defined structures and the acidity might then play a role in their structural/functional integrity. The data in Fig. 3A showing a progressive loss of τ1 activity as more acidic residues are neutralized are consistent with both models. In an attempt to discriminate between these two models, we have compared the activity of the mutants from Fig. 3A with that of a series of fragments derived from τ12 2K. Dahlman-Wright, unpublished observations. (13) in relation to their acidity (Fig. 6). The neutralization mutants from Fig. 3A show an approximately linear decrease in activity as the number of acidic residues decreases (Fig. 6A). According to the acid blob theory, a similar pattern would be expected for the τ1 fragments, which also vary in acidity. However, the activity of these fragments correlates much less well with their acidity (Fig. 6B), and, thus, the acid blob model is at best an incomplete explanation for the mechanism of τ1 action. A number of other observations support this conclusion. (i) Although unstructured in aqueous buffer, the functional core of τ1 does form α-helices under hydrophobic conditions in vitro(24Dahlman-Wright K. Baumann H. McEwan I.J. Almlöf T. Wright A.P.H. Gustafsson J.-Å. Härd T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1699-1703Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Analogous observations have been reported for the acidic activation domains of VP16(22Donaldson L. Capone J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1411-1414Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), GAL4(21Van Hoy M. Leuther K.K. Kodadek T. Johnston S.A.

Chem. 1994; 269: 25613-25620Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). (ii) That τ1 might be structured in vivo is suggested by the pattern of τ1 degradation in cell-free extracts which produces defined degradation products that are inconsistent with indiscriminate proteolysis expected for an unfolded peptide.2 (iii) Deletion analysis defined relatively clear-cut borders for the functional core of τ1(13Dahlman-Wright K.

A. 1994; 91: 1619-1623Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) rather than the gradual loss of activity with progressive deletion that has been associated with the acid blob hypothesis(14Ma J. Ptashne M. Cell. 1987; 48: 847-853Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar, 15Hope I.A. Mahadevan S. Struhl K.

In conclusion, we favor a model in which the high density of charged residues in τ1, particularly in the functional core region, is important in the context of a structured transactivation domain. One possibility is that the charged residues are important to ensure location of the transactivation region on the solvent-exposed surface of the receptor protein. Consistent with this, the mutants studied here have a pronounced effect on the intact GR as well as the isolated τ1 domain. Also, τ1 appears to be an important feature on the GR surface since most monoclonal antibodies raised against intact GR recognize epitopes within τ1(42McEwan I.J. Almlöf T. Wikström A.-C.

As farnesylation is critical for RAS's membrane localization and function, the isoprenylation pathways have received attention as potential targets of anti-RAS pharmacologic maneuvers. We have expanded on these prior studies and demonstrate that one of limonene's metabolic derivatives, perillyl alcohol, decreases the levels of antigenic RAS in the human-derived myeloid THP-1 and lymphoid RPMI-8402 cell lines. Both limonene and perillyl alcohol decrease levels of [35S]methionine-labeled RAS proteins in cells that have been pulsed with radiolabeled methionine for 4 h. In contrast, lovastatin, which inhibits hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase and thus depletes cells of farnesyl pyrophosphate, does not diminish levels of total antigenic RAS but rather results in a shift in the RAS protein; levels of farnesylated RAS decrease whereas levels of unmodified/unfarnesylated RAS increase. As limonene and perillyl alcohol do not induce such a shift, we conclude that these monoterpenes decrease farnesylated RAS protein levels by a mechanism that is clearly distinct from that of either depleting cells of farnesyl pyrophosphate or inhibiting the enzyme farnesyl protein transferase that catalyzes the post-translational farnesylation of RAS. Perillyl alcohol decreases antigenic RAS levels but does not decrease levels of another membrane-tethered protein, the α subunit of the heterotrimeric G protein. Furthermore, perillyl alcohol decreases the levels of radiolabeled methionine incorporated into immunoprecipitable RAS to a greater extent than it decreases radiolabeled methionine incorporated into total cellular protein. Thus there is some degree of specificity for the activity of perillyl alcohol to depress RAS levels.

Post-translational RAS farnesylation is necessary for RAS to be localized to the cytoplasmic membrane; such membrane localization is critical for RAS's growth promoting and transforming activities(8Schafer W.R.

Pharmacological strategies to block RAS farnesylation are shown in Fig. 1 and minimally include: 1) depletion of farnesyl pyrophosphate necessary for RAS farnesylation and 2) inhibition of the farnesyl protein transferase that catalyzes RAS modification.

Investigations revealing the effects of limonene and its structural analogs on RAS isoprenylation are generally based upon experiments that have followed the incorporation of radiolabeled mevalonic acid into protein fractions and immunoprecipitable RAS in HMG-CoA reductase-inhibited cells(8Schafer W.R.

This experimental design is based on the studies that originally demonstrated that mevalonic acid, or one or more of its metabolic derivatives, was incorporated into the protein fraction of eukaryotic cells(20Schmidt R.A. Schneider C.J. Glomset J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 10175-10180Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Expanding on prior investigations with limonene we utilized an alternate experimental system to study the effects of limonene and one of its more potent metabolic derivatives, perillyl alcohol, on RAS expression in two human-derived leukemia cell lines. Specifically, we have compared and contrasted the effects of limonene and perillyl alcohol to those of lovastatin on RAS processing. THP-1 cells (American Type Culture Collection) and RPMI-8402 cells (M. Diaz, Loyola University) were grown in RPMI-1640 media supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum. Cells were maintained in TI-75 culture flasks at 37°C in humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere. Trypan blue exclusion was measured by incubating cells for 5 min with a 1:1 0.4 mg/dl trypan blue solution and counting clear viable and blue nonviable cells with a hemocytometer. All studies with limonene contained a final media concentration of 0.1% ethanol which does not alter the parameters measured in these studies (data not shown). Cells (1 × 107 cells at 1 × 106 cells/ml) in logarithmic phase growth were incubated in RPMI-1640 media with 10% fetal calf serum supplemented with (R)-limonene, (R)-perillyl alcohol, or lovastatin for 24-72 h. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 800 × g for 10 min and washed twice with cold PBS (140 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, 8.0 mM Na2HPO4, and 1.5 mM KH2PO4). Cells were resuspended in 0.1 ml of lysing buffer (20 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 0.1 M NaCl, 1.0% Nonidet P-40, 0.05 g/dl sodium deoxycholate) and vortexed intermittently for 30 min. The cell pellets were dounced 10 times and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 30 min. Protein content of the supernatant was assayed according to the method of Lowry et al.(21Lowry O.H. Rosenbrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cell lysate containing 100 εg of protein was subjected to electrophoretic fractionation on denaturing 15% polyacrylamide gels (SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis). H-ras standard was loaded to one lane on each gel. The gel slab was transblotted to Immobilon-Polyvinylidene difluoride (Millipore, Bedford, MA) prior to blocking for 2 h with blocking buffer (5 mg/dl skim milk, 1 mg/dl bovine serum albumin (BSA), 0.01% antifoam A in PBS). The membrane was then sequentially incubated with NCC-004 anti-RAS antibody (22Kanai T. Hirohashi S. Noguchi M. Shimoyama Y. Shimosato Y. Noguchi S. Nishimura S. Abe O. Jpn. J. Cancer Res. (Gann). 1987; 78: 1314-1318PubMed Google Scholar) in hybridoma supernatant for 2 h, biotinylated rabbit anti-mouse IgG for 2 h, and avidin-linked horseradish peroxidase (Vectastain ABC, Vector Laboratories) for 30 min. The membrane was washed five times with 0.1% Tween 20 in PBS between each incubation. The RAS bands were visualized by incubation of the membrane with 0.7 mM 3,3-diaminobenzidine and 0.006% H2O2 in 10 mM Tris, pH 7.5. Cells were washed and incubated at 3 × 106 cells/ml in methione-free RPMI-1640 media for 1.5 h with or without limonene, perillyl alcohol, or lovastatin. [35S]Methionine/cysteine (1180 Ci/mM) was added to a final media concentration of 0.045 mCi/ml. After incubation for 4 h, the cells were harvested and lysed as described above in the Measurement of RAS section with the exception that 1 g/dl BSA was added to the lysing buffer. Radiolabeled cell lysate containing 200 εg of protein was precleared by incubation with Protein A-Sepharose CL4B complexed with rabbit-anti-rat IgG. After centrifugal separation of the lysate from the preclearing sepharose, the RAS was immunoprecipitated from the lysate by the addition of 150 εl of a 10 g/dl mixture of a complex of Protein A-Sepharose CL4B, rabbit-anti-rat IgG, and Y13-259 rat-anti-RAS IgG. The Sepharose was washed five times with 1 g/dl BSA in RIPA (0.15 M NaCl, 1 g/dl sodium deoxycholate, 0.1 g/dl SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mM phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, and 0.05 M Tris, pH 7.4) buffer and five times with 1 g/dl BSA in PBS prior to boiling for 5 min in 40 εl of 0.05 M Tris, pH 6.8, 30% glycerol, 10% 2-mercaptoethanol, 2 g/dl SDS, 0.025 g/dl bromphenol blue, and 0.001 g/dl methyl green. The supernatant was loaded to 5% glycerol, 15% polyacrylamide gels and subjected to electrophoretic fractionation. The gels were fixed in 7% acetic acid and 5% methanol for 1 h, washed with H2O, and enhanced with a 1 M sodium salicylate solution for 30 min. Gels were then dried and exposed to Kodak XAR5 (X-OMAT) film for 48 h. With development, the density of the bands corresponded to the amount of radiolabeled protein. The amount of radiolabel incorporated into the protein fraction of the cell lysate was measured as tricarboxylic acid-precipitated protein. After incubation with [35S]methionine/cysteine and cell lysis, 100 εl of 1 g/dl BSA in 40 mM methionine was added to 5 εl of cell lysate. The volume was increased to 180 εl by adding H2O prior to the addition of 20 εl of 100 g/dl tricarboxylic acid. After precipitation of the protein fraction, the supernatant was discarded and the precipitated protein washed twice with 0.4 ml of 10 g/dl tricarboxylic acid. The precipitant was resuspended in TS-2 tissue solubilizer (RPI, Mount Prospect, IL) and, after complete dissolution, the radiolabel was quantified by scintillation spectroscopy using Neutralizer (RPI) scintillation mixture. Cells were incubated and lysed, cell lysate was subjected to electrophoretic fractionation, the gel slab was transblotted, and the Immobilon polyvinylidene difluoride membrane blocked with blocking buffer as described under Measurement of RAS section. The membrane was then sequentially incubated with 1:1000 dilution of anti-G protein, α-Subunit Internal in blocking buffer for 2 h and then biotinylated goat anti-rabbit IgG for 2 h. The membrane was then processed beginning with incubation to aviden-linked horseradish peroxidase as described under Measurement of RAS. The densities of the α subunit bands were quantified by analyzing the image acquired with a Hewlett Packard ScanJet IIcx (Palo Alto, CA) with Mocha Image Analysis software from Jandel Scientific (San Rafael, CA). (R)-Limonene (>99% pure) was obtained from Aldrich, and stock solutions were freshly prepared before each experiment by diluting limonene in 10% ethanol-tissue culture media solution. (R)-Perillyl alcohol was obtained from Fluka (Ronkonkoma, NY), and stock solutions were prepared before each experiment by mixing perillyl alcohol with tissue culture media. RPMI-1640 media and fetal calf serum were obtained from the Hybridoma Facility at the University of Iowa. Methionine and cysteine-free media and Tran35S-label (methionine/cysteine) were from ICN Biochemicals (Costa Mesa, CA). Lovastatin was kindly provided by Alfred Alberts of Merck, Sharpe & Dohme and was converted to the open acid prior to use. Protein A-Sepharose CL4B was from Sigma. NCC-004 anti-RAS IgG was kindly provided by Dr. Setsuo Hirohashi (National Cancer Center, Tokyo), H-ras standard was kindly provided by Dr. Robert Deschenes (University of Iowa), Y13-259 anti-RAS IgG was from Oncogene Science (Uniondale, NY), rabbit anti-mouse IgG, goat anti-rabbit IgG, and Vectastain ABC kits were from Vector Laboratories (Burlingame, CA), anti-apolipoprotein B antibody was from Biodesign International (Kennebunkport, MA), rabbit-anti-rat IgG was from Cappel Laboratories (Durham, NC), and rabbit anti-G-Protein α-Subunit Internal (40-54) and G-protein, Bovine Brain were from Calbiochem. To determine the effects of lovastatin on total antigenic RAS protein levels, THP-1 cells were incubated with 0, 10, 25, and 50 εM lovastatin for 24 h prior to harvesting and lysing. Mevalonic acid to a final concentration of 10 mM was added to control cultures that contained 0 and 50 εM lovastatin. Fig. 2 is a Western blot of cell lysate that demonstrates that in control cells without lovastatin there is only one dominant RAS band that corresponds to farnesylated RAS protein. The density seen streaking below the RAS band is a consequence of some degradation of the RAS protein into smaller molecular weight fragments. Increasing concentrations of lovastatin from 10 to 50 εM results in the accumulation of increasing amounts of unmodified RAS protein that migrates with an apparent higher molecular weight than does the farnesylated RAS protein. Mevalonic acid has no effect on the levels of antigenic RAS protein and completely reverses the effects of lovastatin in that only the farnesylated RAS protein is seen. The same experiment using RPMI-8402 cells yielded the same results; selected conditions from this experiment are displayed in Fig. 2. To contrast the effects of (R)-limonene with lovastatin on total antigenic RAS protein levels, THP-1 and RPMI-8402 cells were incubated with 0.1 mM lovastatin and 0 to 5 mM limonene for 24 h prior to harvesting and lysing. Fig. 3 demonstrates that limonene, unlike lovastatin, does not result in accumulation of unmodified RAS protein. There is a suggestion that total RAS levels decrease slightly at the highest concentrations (5 mM) of limonene employed although at 5 mM limonene cell viability was reduced to 78% in THP-1 cells and 60% in RPMI-8402 cells. Perillyl alcohol is an in vivo oxidative metabolite of limonene that has been demonstrated to be more potent than limonene at depressing RAS levels(18Crowell P.L. Ren Z. Lin S. Vedejs E. Gould M.J. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1994; 47: 1405-1415Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). THP-1 and RPMI-8402 cells were incubated with 0.1 mM lovastatin or 0-5 mM perillyl alcohol for 24 h prior to harvesting and lysing. Fig. 4 demonstrates that perillyl alcohol, unlike lovastatin, does not result in accumulation of unmodified RAS protein. It is apparent that perillyl alcohol depresses levels of RAS in a more potent manner than does limonene (Fig. 4 compared to Fig. 3) although perillyl alcohol proved more toxic to cells than did limonene. At 5 mM perillyl alcohol cell viability was severely reduced to <25%, thus allowing the conclusion that even at toxic levels of perillyl alcohol there is still no accumulation of unmodified RAS protein. To verify the integrity of the immunoprecipitation methods, THP-1 cell lysate was treated and immunoprecipitated with Protein A-Sepharose complexed with or without primary Y13-259 anti-RAS antibody. Fig. 5 demonstrates that the RAS band does not precipitate unless the Y13-259 antibody is included in the reaction mixture. To further assess this specificity, cells were pulsed with radiolabeled methionine and lysed. Immunoprecipitation of cell lysate with the Y13-259 antibody resulted in two electrophoretically separable radiolabeled RAS bands as shown in the control lanes for both RPMI-8402 and THP-1 cells in Fig. 6. The addition of excess amounts of H-ras standard competes with radiolabeled RAS for binding to the Y13-259-Sepharose complex and markedly diminishes the intensity of the radiolabeled RAS bands (data not shown).Figure 6:Comparative effects lovastatin, limonene, and perillyl alcohol on the farnesylation of newly synthesized RAS. RPMI-8402 and THP-1 cells were radiolabeled and 200 εg of protein from cell lysate immunoprecipitated as described under “Experimental Procedures.” For this autoradiogram, each lane is labeled according to cell type and whether there was exposure to lovastatin, limonene, or perillyl alcohol. The lane labeled as control + Apo B MAB refers to immunoprecipitant obtained when anti-apolipoprotein B antibody is used in place of Y13-259 anti-RAS antibody. As expected, no radiolabeled bands that migrate with the anticipated molecular weight of the RAS proteins are visualized in this lane.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To assess whether limonene and perillyl alcohol would diminish the synthesis of new radiolabeled RAS protein, RPMI-8402 and THP-1 cells were pulsed with radiolabeled methionine after incubation without added agents or with lovastatin, limonene, or perillyl alcohol. Fig. 6 is the autoradiogram from this experiment. Control cells demonstrate that radiolabel is incorporated into bands that migrate as would farnesylated and unmodified/unfarnesylated RAS protein. Lovastatin at 0.05 mM concentrations completely blocks incorporation of radiolabel into farnesylated RAS protein as evidenced by the lack of a faster moving protein in these treated cells. In contrast, limonene and perillyl alcohol do not result in a selective decrease of radiolabel into farnesylated RAS protein but rather decrease overall levels of radiolabeled RAS proteins. For the RPMI-8402 cells there are sufficient concentrations of limonene and perillyl alcohol to demonstrate a concentration dependence of this phenomenon. As in the Western blots displayed in Figure 3:, Figure 4:, this effect is more evident in the cells treated with perillyl alcohol as compared to those treated with limonene. The treatment of cells with limonene or perillyl alcohol did not alter the ratio of radiolabeled farnesylated to radiolabeled unmodified RAS protein. For control purposes it is important to note that the RPMI-8402 and THP-1 cells maintained viability, as assessed by trypan blue exclusion, to greater than 75% with this short exposure to these concentrations of limonene or perillyl alcohol. To clarify the specificity for perillyl alcohol to depress levels of antigenic RAS, THP-1 and RPMI-8402 cells were incubated with perillyl alcohol ranging from 0 to 1.0 mM for 16 h prior to harvesting and lysing. Fig. 7 displays a Western blot of an acrylamide gel that contains 50 εg of THP-1 cell lysate in each lane; RPMI-8402 cells yielded similar results (not shown). The blot was developed using the anti-G protein (α-subunit) as primary antibody. Lovastatin does not alter the migration of the Gα protein consistent with understanding that the α-subunit of the heterotrimeric G protein is not isoprenylated(23Buss J.E. Mumby S.M. Casey P.J. Gilman A.G. Sefton B.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 7493-7497Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 24Jones T.L.Z. Spiegel A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19389-19392Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Visualization of the intensity of the bands reveals that the cellular levels of the Gα protein are relatively constant when cells are incubated with incrementally increasing concentrations of perillyl alcohol. This is verified by the densitometric analysis of the Gα bands which is shown in the tabular portion of Fig. 7. Also shown in this figure is that RAS levels are decreased in a concentration-dependent fashion in perillyl alcohol-treated cells. Cell viability is maintained to greater than 80% with these concentrations of perillyl alcohol. Thus, perillyl alcohol decreases antigenic levels of RAS without decreasing G protein (α-subunit) levels and cell viabilities. To determine whether the decreased incorporation of radiolabeled methionine to immunoprecipitable RAS by perillyl alcohol is specific to RAS or is a consequence of a general decrease of protein synthesis, THP-1 and RPMI-8402 cells were incubated with [35S]methionine for the last 4 h of a 16-h incubation with 0-1.0 mM perillyl alcohol. Cells were lysed and RAS protein was immunoprecipitated from 200 εg of cellular protein as described earlier. As is shown in the tabular portion of Fig. 7, the amounts of radiolabel incorporated into RAS are decreased in a concentration-dependent fashion in perillyl alcohol-treated THP-1 cells; the radiolabeled methionine incorporated into RAS in cells treated with 1.0 mM perillyl alcohol is decreased to 32% that of control cells. In contrast, the amount of radiolabeled methionine incorporated into 200 εg of cellular protein, assessed as tricarboxylic acid precipitable counts in 200 εg of protein and expressed as the percent tricarboxylic acid precipitable counts in 200 εg of protein in treated as compared to control cells was only minimally decreased. Cells treated with 1.0 mM perillyl alcohol had a reduction of radiolabeled methionine incorporated into RAS to 87% that of control cells. Thus, perillyl alcohol decreased radiolabeled methionine into immunoprecipitable RAS in a more selective fashion than by simply decreasing total protein synthesis. Studies with RPMI-8402 cells demonstrated this same selectivity of perillyl alcohol to decrease RAS synthesis (not shown). These experiments demonstrate that limonene and perillyl alcohol act differently than lovastatin with respect to their activity to suppress levels of farnesylated RAS protein. In these two different human-derived cell lines, limonene and, more potently, perillyl alcohol decrease farnesylated RAS without increasing unmodified/unfarnesylated RAS levels. This result contrasts with that observed with lovastatin which decreases farnesylated RAS and increases unmodified/unfarnesylated RAS levels. Lovastatin's activity is entirely consistent with HMG-CoA reductase inhibition and farnesyl pyrophosphate depletion (Fig. 1)(9Hancock J.F. Magee A.M. Childs J.E. Marshall C.J. Cell. 1989; 57: 1167-1187Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1465) Google Scholar, 25Leonard S. Beck L. Sinensky M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5157-5160Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast the data displayed in Figure 3:, Figure 4: suggest that the monoterpenes either decrease RAS transcription/translation or increase RAS degradation. The high concentrations of monoterpenes used in the experiments shown in Figure 3:, Figure 4: markedly diminish cell viability and thus reinforce the finding that even excessively toxic levels of monoterpenes do not result in the accumulation of unmodified/unfarnesylated RAS in these cell lines. Furthermore, the activity of lovastatin to shift RAS from a predominantly farnesylated to an unmodified/unfarnesylated form is also associated with the newly developed farnesyl protein transferase inhibitors (Fig. 1)(13Gibbs J.

Kowalczyk J.J. Lewis M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18415-18418Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because this shift in RAS species is not observed with the monoterpenes then we can conclude that it is highly unlikely, in contrast to previous suggestions, that limonene and perillyl alcohol significantly block RAS processing at the level of farnesyl protein transferase(7Crowell P.L. Chang R.R. Ren Z. Elson C.E. Gould M.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17679-17685Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Crowell P.L. Ren Z. Lin S. Vedejs E. Gould M.J. Biochem.

Cancer. 1994; 69: 1015-1020Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The differences in the conclusions derived from our experiments and those reported by others (7Crowell P.L. Chang R.R. Ren Z. Elson C.E. Gould M.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17679-17685Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Crowell P.L. Ren Z. Lin S. Vedejs E. Gould M.J. Biochem.

Cancer. 1994; 69: 1015-1020Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) lie in the techniques used to measure RAS levels. These previous reports used radiolabeled mevalonic acid to label the RAS proteins and therefore could not distinguish between agents that decrease levels of the farnesylated RAS proteins by direct inhibition of the enzyme farnesyl protein transferase, by depletion of farnesyl pyrophosphate, by decrease of RAS synthesis at the transcriptional or translational level, or by increase in degradation rates of farnesylated RAS. Additionally, to achieve sufficiently high mevalonic acid specific activity to radiolabel the isoprenylated proteins to the degree needed to detect the proteins by autoradiogram analysis these studies co-incubated cells with radiolabeled mevalonic acid, lovastatin, and the monoterpene to be tested; lovastatin diminishes endogenous mevalonic acid synthesis and thus maintains the high specific activity of radiolabeled mevalonic acid(20Schmidt R.A. Schneider C.J. Glomset J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 10175-10180Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, these investigations could not conclusively distinguish the effects of lovastatin from that of the monoterpenes on RAS processing. The studies reported herein allowed us to assess the effects of treating cells with the monoterpenes alone. That perillyl alcohol was effective at decreasing antigenic RAS levels to a markedly greater degree than limonene is consistent with the known in vivo oxidation of limonene to perillyl alcohol(18Crowell P.L. Ren Z. Lin S. Vedejs E. Gould M.J. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1994; 47: 1405-1415Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Our in vitro studies support the hypothesis that the chemopreventive and chemotherapeutic activity of limonene may likely be a consequence of metabolism to the more active perillyl alcohol. The THP-1 and RPMI-8402 cells used in our studies are incapable of metabolically activating sufficiently large quantities of limonene to generate enough perillyl alcohol to decrease RAS levels. We observed the presence of only a single farnesylated RAS band in the Western blot analysis of cell lysate from unlabeled control cells (Fig. 2-4) and the presence of both the farnesylated and a slower migrating band in immunoprecipitated RAS from radiolabeled cells (Fig. 6). This finding is likely due to the relatively short duration of the pulse of [35S]methionine as compared to the longer half-life of the RAS protein in these cells. Although there are no data available that describes the RAS half-life in the human-derived leukocyte cells used in these present studies, there are reports that the half-life of the H-RAS protein in NIH 3T3 cells that have been transfected with normal human H-RAS cDNA is approximately 20 h(26Ulsh L.S. Shih T.Y. Mol. Cell Biol. 1984; 4: 1647-1652Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Were the half-life of the RAS proteins studied in these present experiments to be similarly long then it is not unexpected that the intensity of the radiolabel in the unmodified/unfarnesylated RAS bands would approximate the intensity of the radiolabel in the farnesylated bands (Fig. 6), especially given the high ratio of farnesylated to unfarnesylated RAS proteins in untreated cells (Figs. 2-4). A concern with these studies is that the high concentrations of perillyl alcohol used for the experiment in Fig. 4 may have decreased RAS levels because of nonspecific cytotoxicity. The experiment shown in Fig. 4 is important because it unambiguously shows that even at toxic levels of perillyl alcohol there is no accumulation of unmodified RAS protein. The concentrations of perillyl alcohol used in the study shown in Fig. 7 still decreased RAS protein levels but had only minimal effects on cell viability. Furthermore, we have shown in Fig. 7 that the levels of another membrane-tethered protein, the α subunit of a heterotrimeric G protein (23Buss J.E. Mumby S.M. Casey P.J. Gilman A.G. Sefton B.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 7493-7497Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 24Jones T.L.Z. Spiegel A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19389-19392Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that is expressed in the leukemia cell lines in this study, remain relatively constant while the RAS levels in these cells are decreased. Thus, it seems unlikely that perillyl alcohol's effects are exclusively the result of nonspecific toxicity. To further assess the specificity issue, we have compared the amount of radiolabeled methionine incorporation into immunoprecipitable RAS to the amount of radiolabeled methionine incorporated into total protein fractions. Fig. 7 shows that the radiolabeled methionine incorporated into RAS is diminished more than that incorporated into total cell protein. This suggests that the mechanism that underlies perillyl alcohol's effect to decrease antigenic RAS may be a consequence of decreased RAS synthesis, particularly at and below 0.5 mM perillyl alcohol. At 0.75 and 1.0 mM perillyl alcohol, there is continued low new RAS synthesis but even lower RAS levels suggesting that enhanced RAS degradation may partially explain the effect of these higher concentrations of perillyl alcohol to depress RAS levels. Further studies will be necessary to clarify these findings; such studies will also improve understanding of the regulation of RAS synthesis and degradation. The finding that the monoterpenes decrease farnesylated RAS levels by a different mechanism than does either lovastatin or the newly developed farnesyl protein transferase inhibitors is important because it supports the possibility that combinations of monoterpenes, lovastatin, and the farnesyl protein transferase inhibitors might be more effective at decreasing farnesylated RAS levels than each agent alone. In fact, there is a recent report that the combination of limonene and pravastatin, another competitive inhibitor of HMG CoA reductase, is more effective at decreasing the levels of isoprenylated RAS in human-derived Hep G2 cells than either compound alone(19Kawata S. Nagase T. Yamasaki E. Ishiguro H. Matsuzawa Y. Br. J. Cancer. 1994; 69: 1015-1020Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Finally, further dissection of mechanisms that underlie the activity of the isoprene compounds to decrease RAS levels will likely include detailed analysis of the effects of these compounds on the rates of synthesis and degradation of the RAS proteins. Such studies will improve understanding of the mechanisms that regulate RAS expression and may suggest new approaches that can be used to pharmacologically manipulate RAS levels in eukaryotic cells."

We report here the identification of a structurally unique, kidney-specific member of the cadherin multigene family (Ksp-cadherin). cDNA cloning and molecular analysis of the 130-kDa protein confirmed that it was novel and indicated that it most closely resembled members of the LI-cadherin/HPT-1 cadherin subgroup. The predicted protein possesses the definitive cadherin-specific sequence motifs LDRE, DXND, and DXD in well conserved sequential arrangement, and the characteristic cysteine residues found in the last ectodomains of almost all known cadherins. Like LI-cadherin and HPT-1, Ksp-cadherin lacks the prosequence and HAV adhesion recognition sequence typical of most classical cadherins, and possesses a truncated cytoplasmic domain (18-22 amino acids). When expressed in a transient Vaccinia/T7 expression system, Ksp-cadherin displayed the classic calcium sensitivity to trypsin proteolysis that is observed in all cadherins. Immunolocalization studies and Northern analysis indicated that expression of Ksp-cadherin was kidney-specific and limited to the basolateral membranes of renal tubular epithelial cells.

Vertebrate cadherins can be subdivided into several distinct groups on the basis of amino acid sequence homology, cellular localization, and proposed function (e.g. the classical cadherins, T-cadherin, LI-cadherin and HPT-1, the desmosomal cadherins, the ret proto-oncogene, and the proto-cadherins). All of the vertebrate cadherins identified to date (with the exception of T-cadherin; (13Vestal D.J. Ranscht B. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 451-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar)) possess a large N-terminal ectoplasmic domain, a single hydrophobic membrane-spanning region, and a subgroup-specific C-terminal cytoplasmic domain. The cadherin ectodomains are typically organized in a tandem series of repeats (usually four; approximately 110 amino acids each) followed by a less conserved ectodomain proximal to the plasma membrane. The distal ectodomains contain the hallmark cadherin-specific sequence motifs LDRE, DXND, and DXD in a highly conserved sequential arrangement. The final ectodomain usually contains four cysteine residues whose locations relative to the plasma membrane are extraordinarily well conserved among most cadherins. Individual cadherins tend to be associated with characteristic tissue types (e.g. N-cadherin with neural tissue or E-cadherin with epithelial tissue), but many cadherins also have distinct secondary distributions(4Geiger B. Ayalon O. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 307-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). These distributions often overlap that of other cadherins, and it has been suggested that cadherin-meditated cell recognition may be facilitated by recognition of specific combinations of cadherins, rather than by recognition of single, tissue-specific, signature molecules(3Takeichi M. Science. 1991; 251: 1451-1455Crossref PubMed Scopus (2990) Google Scholar). Moreover, it appears that cadherins can mediate a variety of context-specific functions, the exact nature of which depends on the site of expression and the stage of tissue development(5Grunwald G.B. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 797-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). In the present study, we report the identification of a novel kidney-specific member of the cadherin multigene family (which we propose be designated Ksp-cadherin). 1The abbreviations used are: Ksp-cadherinkidney-specific cadherinDNDS4,4’-dinitrostilbene-2,2’-disulfonic acidNADS4-amino-4’-nitrostilbene-2,2’-disulfonic acidPMSFphenylmethanesulfonyl fluorideDTTdithiothreitolPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisPCRpolymerase chain reactionkbkilobase pair(s)bpbase pair(s)UTRuntranslated regionFITCfluorescein isothiocyanate. 1 cDNA cloning and molecular analysis of Ksp-cadherin indicate that it is a structurally unique member of the cadherin superfamily and that it most closely resembles members of the LI-cadherin/HPT-1 subgroup. Unlike most cadherins, Ksp-cadherin has a distinct organ-specific tissue distribution. Immunolocalization studies and Northern analysis indicate that expression of Ksp-cadherin is kidney-specific and confined to the basolateral membranes of the proximal tubule, the thick and thin limbs of the loop of Henle, the distal convoluted tubule, and a distinct subpopulation of cells in both the connecting tubule and the collecting duct in the adult rabbit kidney. kidney-specific cadherin 4,4’-dinitrostilbene-2,2’-disulfonic acid 4-amino-4’-nitrostilbene-2,2’-disulfonic acid phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride dithiothreitol polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis polymerase chain reaction kilobase pair(s) base pair(s) untranslated region fluorescein isothiocyanate. Basolateral membrane vesicles and cortical microsomes were isolated from renal cortices of male New Zealand White rabbits as described previously(14Grassl S.M. Aronson P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 8778-8783Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Membrane fractions were isolated and stored in 250 mM sucrose, 10 mM HEPES, 1 mM EDTA, 1 εM pepstatin, 1 εM leupeptin, 230 εM phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), pH 7.5 at −70°C for 4-6 weeks. DNDS affinity columns were prepared by nonspecific immobilization of DNDS in acrylamide beads in a manner similar to that described by Uchida and Filburn (15; see also (16Soleimani M. Desir G. Aronson P.S. Kidney Int. 1989; 35: 464Google Scholar)). NADS affinity columns were prepared by covalent coupling of NADS to Affi-Gel 10 (Bio-Rad). Membrane fractions were solubilized in membrane solubilization buffer (0.67% Triton X-100, 40 mM HEPES, 1 mM dithiothreitol (DTT), 230 εM PMSF, pH 8.1) at a protein concentration of 10 mg/ml for 1 h. The Triton X-100-soluble component was then incubated with either the DNDS or NADS affinity matrix for 60 or 30 min, respectively. The unbound material was removed and the affinity matrices were washed four times with five column volumes of wash buffer (0.1% Triton X-100, 40 mM HEPES, 1 mM DTT, 230 εM PMSF, pH 8.1). Bound proteins were eluted by incubating the DNDS or NADS affinity matrices with three column volumes of elution buffer (10 mM DNDS, 0.1% Triton X-100, 40 mM HEPES, 1 mM DTT, 230 εM PMSF, pH 8.1) for 45 or 30 min, respectively. All steps were performed at 4°C. Protein binding to the affinity matrices was monitored by SDS-PAGE. The 71-kDa antigen was gel-purified from NADS affinity column eluates by SDS-PAGE. BALB/c mice were immunized intraperitoneally with 10-15 εg of antigen adsorbed onto potassium alum as described by Kashgarian et al.(17Kashgarian M. Biemesderfer D. Caplan M. Forbush Jr., B. Kidney Int. 1985; 28: 899-913Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Hybridomas were screened by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (18Voller A. Bidwell D.E. Bartlett A. A Guide With Abstracts to Microplate Applications. Flowline, Guernsey, United Kingdom1979: 1-25Google Scholar) against rabbit renal cortical basolateral membrane vesicles, by immunoblot (19Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44939) Google Scholar) against stilbene affinity column eluates, and by immunofluorescent localization (20Biemesderfer D. Reilly R.F. Exner M. Igarashi P. Aronson P.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 263: F833-F840PubMed Google Scholar) in rabbit kidney. Nine of the resulting hybridomas produced antibodies that specifically recognized the 71-kDa protein. These hybridomas were subcloned by limiting dilution and screened once more (with the same criteria) to assure continued antibody production. All immunochemical analyses performed in this study were conducted with monoclonal antibodies isolated from the hybridoma clone C575-5I. This specific clone was selected for routine use because of its extremely high antibody titers. Proteins of interest were gel-purified by SDS-PAGE, electroeluted from excised gel slices into a 10 mM NH4HCO3, 0.02% SDS buffer(21Hunkapiller M.W. Lujan E. Ostrander F. Hood L.E. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 91: 227-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar), concentrated to 50-60 εg of protein/ml, and stored at −70°C. Peptide fragment maps were generated by partial digestion of the purified proteins with endoproteinase Glu-C (V8; Boehringer Mannheim) as described by Cleveland(22Cleveland D.W. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 96: 222-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). An immunoaffinity chromatography matrix was prepared by coupling C575-5I to Protein A-Sepharose CL-4B (Pharmacia) through a rabbit anti-mouse IgG bridge as described by Schneider et al.(23Schneider C. Newman R.A. Sutherland D.R. Asser U. Greaves M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 10766-10769Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Triton X-100-solubilized membrane fractions (solubilized at 10 mg of protein/ml in 0.67% Triton X-100, 1 mM EDTA, 1 εM pepstatin, 1 εM leupeptin, and 230 εM PMSF in phosphate-buffered saline) were incubated with the immunoaffinity matrix for 16 h at 4°C. The supernatant was removed and the matrix was washed twice with salt wash buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM Na2EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, pH 7.4, 20°C), four times with RIPA buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, 1% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 150 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM Na2EDTA, pH 7.4, 20°C), and finally twice more with salt wash buffer. Bound antigen was eluted by incubating the matrix with immunoaffinity elution buffer (50 mM glycine-HCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, pH 2.7) for 2 min at 20°C. The eluate was immediately neutralized with 1 M Tris base. This was repeated four times, and the eluates were pooled and then concentrated to approximately 60 εl. Column yield was assessed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with C575-5I. The 71-kDa protein was isolated by gel purification and electroelution as described above. 16 εg of the purified 71-kDa protein were partially digested with 0.1 εg of V8 protease in a 10-20% SDS-polyacrylamide gradient gel. The resulting peptide fragments were then electroblotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride filter. To guard against the possibility of sequencing a contaminant, a duplicate lane was probed with C575-5I to positively identify the fragment(s) derived from the protein of interest. The remainder of the blot was briefly stained with Coomassie Blue, and the appropriate band (Frag-38) was cut from the blot for N-terminal amino acid sequencing at the W. M. Keck Foundation Biotechnology Resource Laboratory at Yale University as described previously(24Igarashi P. Karniski L.P. Biochem. J. 1991; 280: 71-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The design of the gene-specific oligonucleotide PCR primer (GSP1; 5’-GAGGC(C/I)GA(C/T)AT(H)CC(N)GT(N)AA-3’) was based on the N-terminal seven amino acids of Frag-38 (sequenced above) and preferred codon usage in the rabbit(25Aota S. Gojobori T. Ishibashi F. Maruyama T. Idemura T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 315-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides were synthesized by the Yale University Department of Pathology DNA Synthesizing Service. Each PCR (26Saiki R.K. Gelfard D.H. Stuffel S. Scharf S.J. Higuchi R. Horn G.T. Mullis K.B.

Reaction mixtures were heated for 5 min at 97°C and then cooled to 75°C. AmpliTaq DNA polymerase was added, and the mixture was overlaid with mineral oil. Reaction mixtures were subjected to 40 cycles of PCR (1 min at 94°C, 1 min at 65°C, and 3 min at 72°C) in a Perkin-Elmer thermal cycler. After the final cycle, the reaction mixtures were incubated at 72°C for 15 min. PCR products were size-fractionated on a 1.5% agarose gel and transferred to nylon filters (GeneScreen Plus; DuPont). PCR products that hybridized to the 32P-end-labeled internal, gene-specific oligonucleotide probes GSP2 and GSP3 (GSP2: 5’-GC(C/I)CC(C/I)GC(C/I)GG(N)TC(N)TT(Y)-3’; GSP3: 5’-GC(C/I)CC(C/I)GC(C/I)GG(N)AG(Y)TT(Y)-3’) were identified and subcloned into the PCR™ II vector using the TA Cloning&#174; system (Invitrogen Corp.). The λ ZAP II rabbit kidney cortex cDNA library was screened by the plaque-lift method (27Benton W.D. Davis T.W. Science. 1977; 196: 180-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (2924) Google Scholar) with a 32P-labeled 1-kb PCR product (PCR-1). Duplicate nylon filters (Hybond-N; Amersham Corp.) were prehybridized in Church-Gilbert solution containing 20% formamide and 100 εg of denatured salmon sperm DNA/ml for 6 h at 50°C. The filters were hybridized in the same solution containing 106 cpm/ml 32P-labeled PCR-1 for 48 h at 50°C. Filters were washed in 2 × SSC for 30 min at room temperature and then 0.1 × SSC containing 0.5% SDS for 30 min at 68°C. cDNA clones were recovered from positive λ ZAP II plaques by in vivo excision using R408 helper phage. The rescued phagemids were recovered as double-stranded DNA (in pBluescript II SK−) by infection of Escherichia coli (XL1-Blue strain). Total RNA was isolated from 0.5-1 g of rabbit tissues by a modification (28Puissant C. Houdebine L.M. BioTechniques. 1990; 8: 148-149Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) of the acid guanidinium thiocyanate extraction method described by Chomczynski and Sacchi(29Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar). Poly(A)+ RNA was selected by oligo(dT)-cellulose chromatography(30Hartmann K.K.P. Papa V. Brown E.J. Doerries U. Rosenthal S.M. Goldfine I.D. Endocrinology. 1990; 127: 2038-2040Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). 25 εg of the poly(A)+ RNA extracted from each tissue was electrophoresed through 1% agarose, 0.66 M formaldehyde gels and transferred to nylon filters (GeneScreen Plus; DuPont) by capillary action in 10 × SSC. Northern blots were prehybridized in Church-Gilbert solution containing 50% formamide and 100 εg of denatured salmon sperm DNA/ml for 4 h at 42°C. Blots were hybridized in the same solution containing 106 cpm/ml 32P-labeled PCR-1 for 24 h at 42°C. Filters were washed in 2 × SSC for 30 min at room temperature and then 0.1 × SSC containing 0.5% SDS for 30 min at 68°C. Plasmids containing cDNA inserts were directly sequenced by the dideoxynucleotide chain termination method (31Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 560-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (52769) Google Scholar) using modified T7 DNA polymerase (Sequenase; U. S. Biochemical Corp.) and [35S]dATP (DuPont NEN). Single-stranded cDNA template was prepared from library clones by inducing transformed E. coli (XL1-Blue) to secrete pBluescript II as single-stranded DNA by infection with VCSM13 helper phage. Overlapping sequence of both strands was obtained with sequence-specific oligonucleotide primers. A T7/Vaccinia hybrid expression system (32Moss B. Elroy-Stein O. Mizukami T. Alexander W.A. Fuerst T.R. Nature. 1990; 348: 91-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar) was used to transiently express positively identified Ksp-cadherin library clones in transfected LAP1 cells (a mouse L-cell line generously provided by Dr. J. Pouyssegur; (33Sardet C. Franchi A. Pouyssegur J. Cell. 1989; 56: 271-280Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar)). LAP1 cells were grown in α-MEM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 50 units of penicillin/ml, and 50 mg of streptomycin/ml and maintained in 5% CO2/95% air at 37°C. Cells were plated on glass coverslips or 35-mm tissue culture dishes 36-48 h prior to infection with the recombinant Vaccinia virus, vTF7-3. Cells used for infection were typically 80-90% confluent. LAP1 cells were infected with 40 plaque-forming units/cell of virus inoculum for 30 min at 37°C. The viral inoculum was removed, and the infected cells were incubated with 5 εg of plasmid and 1.67 εg of Lipofectin (Life Technologies, Inc.) for 16-20 h at 37°C. LAP1 cells were grown to confluence on 35-mm tissue culture dishes, infected with Vaccinia, and then transfected with the Ksp-cadherin cDNA clone λRT53 as described above. Dishes were washed with 2 ml of phosphate-buffered saline and then either 1 ml of HBS (HEPES-buffered saline: 138 mM NaCl, 4.4 mM KCl, 0.34 mM K2HPO4, 5.6 mM glucose, 10 mM HEPES, 0.1% trypsin, pH 7.4) containing 10 mM Ca2+ or 1 ml of HBS containing 10 mM EDTA. Cells typically detached from the dishes in 25-20 min. 30 min after the addition of HBS, the cells were removed from the dishes, pelleted at 15,000 × g for 5 min, solubilized in SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and then subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western analysis. Sequence analysis and data base searches (Entrez Release 15.0, National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), Bethesda, MD) were performed using MacVector 4.1 software (Kodak International, Rochester, NY). Multiple sequence alignments were generated using Clustal Version 5(34Higgins D.G. Bleasby A.J. Fuchs R. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1992; 8: 189-191PubMed Google Scholar). In preliminary studies, Soleimani et al.(16Soleimani M. Desir G. Aronson P.S. Kidney Int. 1989; 35: 464Google Scholar) used disulfonic stilbene affinity chromatography to identify a 71-kDa protein as a potential candidate for a structural component of the renal basolateral Na+/HCO3− cotransporter or an associated protein. The objective of the present study was to isolate and characterize the 71-kDa protein and its cDNA clone. Our initial step toward this objective was to develop a monoclonal antibody that recognized the 71-kDa protein both by Western analysis and immunohistochemistry. Although the 71-kDa protein was originally isolated by DNDS affinity chromatography, we found that we were unable to isolate the quantities of antigen required for monoclonal antibody production until we developed the more efficient NADS/Affi-Gel affinity matrix (see “Materials and Methods”). The monoclonal antibody, C575-5I, was prepared by immunization of BALB/c mice with the gel-purified 71-kDa protein isolated by NADS affinity chromatography from rabbit renal cortical microsomes. Western analysis of rabbit crude cortical microsomes, NADS column eluates, and DNDS column eluates initially suggested that C575-5I reacted with several proteins in addition to the 71-kDa protein of interest (see Fig. 1). The observation of similar labeling patterns with eight other monoclonal antibodies also selected for reactivity to the 71-kDa protein (data not shown) implied that the 71-kDa protein and all the minor proteins recognized by the antibodies were, in fact, proteolytic fragments of a 130-kDa parent. This hypothesis was confirmed by the demonstration of identical Western labeling patterns in overlapping regions of V8 protease peptide fragment maps of the isolated 71-kDa and 130-kDa proteins (Fig. 2).Figure 2:Western analysis of V8 protease peptide fragment maps of the 71-kDa and 130-kDa proteins. Peptide fragment maps were generated by in situ digestion of 36 εg of the gel-purified 71-kDa protein (isolated from NADS column eluates; lane1) or the gel-purified 130-kDa protein (isolated from a C575-5I immunoaffinity column; lane2) with 240 ng of endoproteinase Glu-C (V8 protease). In lane3, V8 protease was added to the sample well in the absence of exogenous substrate. The digest was transferred to a PVDF membrane and then probed with C575-5I. The arrow indicates the position of the 38-kDa peptide fragment that was subjected to N-terminal amino acid sequencing (Frag-38; lanes1 and 2).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The 38-kDa peptide fragment (Frag-38) generated by the V8 protease digest of the 71-kDa protein (see Fig. 2) was excised and subjected to N-terminal amino acid sequencing as described above. The resulting partial amino acid sequence (EADIPVNAPAGSFLLTI) had no matches in the NCBI protein data bases. We utilized a two-stage process to obtain a cDNA clone containing the entire coding region for the 130-kDa protein. In the first stage, anchored PCR was used to generate partial length cDNA clones from a rabbit renal cortex cDNA library. The goal was to amplify the region between the gene-specific oligonucleotide primer, GSP1 (based on Frag-38 partial amino acid sequence), and PCR primers anchored in the polylinker region of λ ZAP II. Since the cloning direction in λ ZAP II could not be predicted, we utilized both T3- and T7-based oligonucleotides as our anchored primers (in separate PCR reactions). We isolated two partial length cDNA clones using this approach (1 kb and 350 bp, respectively). Their identity was confirmed by Southern blot with internal, gene-specific oligonucleotide probes (GSP2 and GSP3) and dideoxynucleotide sequencing. Northern analysis of rabbit kidney cortex poly(A+) RNA with the 1-kb PCR product (PCR-1) identified a single 3-kb transcript. In the second stage, the 1-kb PCR product was radiolabeled and used to rescreen the kidney cortex cDNA library at high stringency. We isolated 17 partial length cDNA clones, ranging in size from 400 bp to 2.9 kb. Since our principal objective was to isolate a cDNA clone containing the entire coding region for the 130-kDa protein, we opted to screen potential clones (all those >2 kb in length) by transient expression and Western blot analysis rather than by the more tedious approach of dideoxynucleotide sequencing. One of the eight clones screened by this method (λRT53; 2817 bp in length) encoded a 130-kDa protein that was recognized by Western blot analysis with C575-5I (Fig. 3). λRT53 contains a 5’-untranslated region (5’-UTR) of 13 nucleotides, a single long open reading frame of 2487 nucleotides, a 3’-untranslated region (3’-UTR) of 192 nucleotides, and terminates in a poly(A) tail. The poly(A) tail is preceded by a putative polyadenylation signal(35Proudfoot N.J. Brownlee G.G. Nature. 1976; 263: 211-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (1911) Google Scholar). The proximity of the putative initiation codon to the 5’-end of λRT53 prompted us to screen other library clones (by dideoxynucleotide sequencing) for more 5’-UTR sequence. Composite nucleotide sequence of λRT53 and λRT52 (≈2.4 kb in length) extended the 5’-UTR to 164 nucleotides (Fig. 4; the length of the composite sequence is 2933 nucleotides). The putative initiation codon identified above resides within a consensus sequence for initiation of translation (36Kozak M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 8125-8132Crossref PubMed Scopus (4172) Google Scholar) and is preceded by an upstream in-frame stop codon. The long open reading frame predicts a protein of 829 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 88.8 kDa. This open reading frame also encodes the 17 amino acids identified in Frag-38 (see above). Hydropathy analysis (Kyte and Doolittle(37Kyte J. Doolittle R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 105-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (17296) Google Scholar); window size: 20 residues) identified a 27-amino acid N-terminal hydrophobic domain, a 759-amino acid predominantly hydrophilic domain, a single putative membrane-spanning segment (21 amino acids), and a relatively short, hydrophilic C-terminal domain (22 amino acids). Signal peptide analysis using von Heijne's (38von Heijne G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 4683-4690Crossref PubMed Scopus (3693) Google Scholar) weighted-matrix algorithm suggested that the N-terminal hydrophobic region contained a post-translationally cleaved transient leader sequence (putative cleavage at Val-18). Four potential N-linked glycosylation sites were identified in the region immediately preceding the putative membrane-spanning segment (residues 517, 602, 709, and 722; see Fig. 4). Data base searches with the translated amino acid sequence confirmed that the protein was novel and indicated that it was a member of the cadherin gene family. The actual sequence homology of the 130-kDa protein with representative cadherins was relatively low (e.g. 20-24% identity with the exoplasmic domains of representative classical cadherins E-, B-, and M-cadherin, and 29% identity with the exoplasmic domains of LI-cadherin and HPT-1), but the overall structural organization was very similar (particularly with LI-cadherin and HPT-1). Like all previously described cadherins, the putative exoplasmic region of the 130-kDa protein is composed of a series of well defined domains (see Fig. 5). Ectodomains A, C, and D (94-113 amino acids each) contain the diagnostic cadherin-specific sequence motifs LDRE, DXND, and DXD (or modifications thereof) in well conserved sequential arrangement and ectodomain G (the premembrane ectodomain) contains the four appropriately located cysteine residues common to the last ectodomains of almost all known cadherins. A characteristic feature of the cadherin gene family is a calcium-modulated sensitivity to trypsin proteolysis(5Grunwald G.B. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 797-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar, 13Vestal D.J. Ranscht B. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 451-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 39Hyafil F. Babinet C.

To determine if our putative cadherin also possessed this property, we used the T7/Vaccinia system (described above) to drive the transient expression of the 130-kDa protein in LAP1 cells and then exposed the cells to 0.1% trypsin in either the presence or absence of 10 mM calcium. The cells were subjected to SDS-PAGE and then analyzed by Western blot with mAb C575-5I. T"

https://openalex.org/W2093760702,"We have previously reported that the promoter region of the mouse interleukin-5 (IL-5) gene, extending from a nucleotide position about −1,200 to +33 relative to the transcription initiation site, can mediate transcriptional stimulation by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and dibutyryl cAMP (Bt2cAMP) in mouse thymoma EL-4 cells. Here, we describe identification of four cis-regulatory elements necessary for full activity of the IL-5 promoter, using deletion and mutation analyses. We designated these elements as IL-5A (−948 ∼−933), IL-5P (−117 ∼−92), IL-5C (−74 ∼−56), and IL-5CLE0 (−55 ∼−38). We found that IL-5P bears homology to the binding site for the nuclear factor of activated T cells (NF-AT) and interacted with protein factors in nuclear extracts prepared from EL-4 cells stimulated with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and Bt2cAMP (designated NFIL-5P). NFIL-5P complex was inhibited in the presence of an excess NF-AT and AP1 oligonucleotides and supershifted by antisera raised against NF-ATp, c-Fos, and c-Jun. It thus seems likely that an NF-AT-related factor is involved in the regulation of IL-5 gene transcription.

We found that IL-5P bears homology to the binding site for the nuclear factor of activated T cells (NF-AT) and interacted with protein factors in nuclear extracts prepared from EL-4 cells stimulated with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and Bt2cAMP (designated NFIL-5P). NFIL-5P complex was inhibited in the presence of an excess NF-AT and AP1 oligonucleotides and supershifted by antisera raised against NF-ATp, c-Fos, and c-Jun. It thus seems likely that an NF-AT-related factor is involved in the regulation of IL-5 gene transcription.

The IL-5 gene is located on mouse chromosome 11 and human chromosome 5, within a cluster of the IL-3, granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), IL-4, and IL-13 genes (4Lee J.S.

Mouse Th cells have been classified into two subsets on the basis of their distinct lymphokine production patterns(7Mosmann T.R. Cherwinski H. Bond M.W. Giedlin M.A. Coffman R.L. J. Immunol. 1986; 136: 2348-2357Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Th1 cells produce IL-2, interferon γ, and lymphotoxin and promote cell-mediated immunity, whereas Th2 cells produce IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, and IL-10 and promote humoral immunity(8Mosmann T.R. Immunol. Res. 1991; 10: 183-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Polarized Th1 and Th2 responses have been shown to be a feature of a number of disease states in both mice and humans, and a proper balance between the two subsets is crucial for the effective responses(9Scott P. Kaufmann S.H. Immunol. Today. 1991; 12: 346-348Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar, 10Sher A. Coffman R.L. Annu. Rev.

Despite their physiological significance, molecular mechanisms which account for the difference in lymphokine gene expression in Th1 and Th2 cells are not well understood. One mechanism may entail differences in transcription factors interacting with cis-acting elements in lymphokine genes. Another mechanism may involve differences in signal transduction pathways between Th1 and Th2 cells(12Arai N. Naito Y. Watanabe M. Masuda E.S. Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Tsuboi A. Heike T. Matsuda I. Yokota K. Koyano-Nakagawa N. Lee H.J. Muramatsu M. Yokota T. Arai K. Pharmacol. Ther. 1992; 55: 303-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). There are reports suggesting that Th1 and Th2 cells use different signal transduction pathways; several groups have demonstrated that compounds which elevate intracellular cAMP levels have differential effects on lymphokine production in Th1 and Th2 cells(13Li T.K. Fox B.S. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 1680-1690PubMed Google Scholar, 14Munoz E. Zubiaga A.M. Merrow M. Sauter N.P. Huber B.T. J. Exp. Med. 1990; 172: 95-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 15Betz M. Fox B.S. J. Immunol. 1991; 146: 108-113PubMed Google Scholar). We have previously reported that cAMP has differential effects on the production of Th1- and Th2-type lymphokines in EL-4 cells, a cell line which produces both types of lymphokines when stimulated with PMA(16Lee H.J. Koyano-Nakagawa N. Naito Y. Nishida J. Arai N. Arai K. Yokota T. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 6135-6142PubMed Google Scholar). Effects of cAMP on PMA-induced expression of IL-2 and IL-5 genes were opposite; i.e. cAMP activated the IL-5 gene synergistically with PMA, while it suppressed PMA-induced expression of the IL-2 gene, by modulating respective promoter activities. Mechanisms for differential regulation of the IL-2 and IL-5 genes by cAMP in EL-4 cells may be related to those in Th1/Th2 cells and should provide some insight at the molecular level. Transcriptional control of the IL-2 gene has been extensively studied, and the major regulatory elements have been shown to reside within a region of approximately 300 bp upstream of the transcription initiation site(17Serfling E. Barthelmas R. Pfeuffer I. Schenk B. Zarius S. Swoboda R. Mercurio F. Karin M. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 465-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 18Ullman K.S. Northrop J.P. Verweij C.L. Crabtree G.R. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1990; 8: 421-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). Of several transcription factors involved in regulation of the IL-2 gene, NF-AT is essential for transcription of the IL-2 gene upon T cell activation and plays a major role in various aspects of regulation of the IL-2 gene, including T cell-specific expression(19Shaw J.P. Utz P.J. Durand D.B. Toole J.J. Emmel E.A. Crabtree G.R. Science. 1988; 241: 202-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). NF-AT has also been implicated in the transcriptional regulation of other lymphokine genes, such as GM-CSF, IL-3, IL-4, and tumor necrosis factor-α, hence, a role in the coordinated expression of these genes was suggested(20Masuda E.S. Naito Y. Arai N. Arai N. Immunologist. 1993; 1: 198-203Google Scholar, 21Rao A. Immunol. Today. 1994; 15: 274-281Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). We also have data that NF-AT is a major target of the inhibitory action of cAMP on the IL-2 promoter(22Tsuruta L. Lee H.J. Masuda E.M. Koyano-Nakagawa N. Arai K. Arai N. Yokota T. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 5255-5264PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, details on the transcriptional control of the IL-5 gene have not been explored at the molecular level. Within the 5’-flanking region, the IL-5 gene is associated with the conserved lymphokine elements (CLE)0, CLE1, and CLE2 which are also found in the promoters of IL-3, GM-CSF, and IL-4 genes, and may have a role in the regulation of coordinated lymphokine expression (23Arai K. Lee F. Miyajima A. Miyatake S. Arai N. Yokota T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1990; 59: 783-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (1176) Google Scholar, 24Miyatake S. Shlomai J. Arai K. Arai N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 5894-5901Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). In this study, we identified four cis-regulatory elements which are necessary for full activity of the IL-5 promoter in response to PMA and Bt2cAMP stimulation in the mouse thymoma line EL-4. We showed that one element, the IL-5P element, shares homology with the binding site of NF-AT of the IL-2 gene and interacts with the inducible nuclear factor NFIL-5P which is closely related to the transcription factor NF-AT. The mouse thymoma cell line EL-4 TB6 was maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 2 mM glutamine, 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 εg/ml streptomycin, 50 εM 2-mercaptoethanol, and 5% fetal bovine serum under 5% CO2. Jurkat, Ba/F3, and COS-7 cells were cultured in the same medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Recombinant mIL-3 (1 ng/ml) was additionally supplemented for maintenance of Ba/F3 cells. NIH3T3 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and the antibiotics described above. Anti-mouse NF-ATp (αNF-ATp), a rabbit polyclonal antiserum raised against recombinant NF-ATp, was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology Incorporated. The Fos antibody (αFos), a rabbit polyclonal IgG reactive with c-Fos, Fos B, Fra-1, and Fra-2 and Jun antibody (αJun), a rabbit polyclonal IgG reactive with c-Jun, Jun B, and Jun D and their cognate peptides purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. The DNA sequence of both strands of the region extending from position −1174 to −545 was determined using an Applied Biosystems 373A DNA sequencer. Plasmids pUC00Luc and pmIL5Luc(1.2) were described previously(16Lee H.J. Koyano-Nakagawa N. Naito Y. Nishida J. Arai N. Arai K. Yokota T. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 6135-6142PubMed Google Scholar). pmIL5Luc(1.2) was linearized by SalI digestion and a series of nested 5’ deletions was generated by BAL-31 exonuclease treatment. Then, 7-bp SalI linkers were attached and the SalI-HindIII fragments were inserted into pUC00Luc. The 5’ border of each deletion mutant was determined by DNA sequencing and was named according to its 5’-end point. To generate pmIL5Luc(1.8), the 5’-EcoRI site of the pmIL5EHE (16Lee H.J. Koyano-Nakagawa N. Naito Y. Nishida J. Arai N. Arai K. Yokota T. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 6135-6142PubMed Google Scholar) was replaced by the SalI site and the 1.8-kb SalI-HindIII fragment was inserted into pUC00Luc. The linker-scanning mutants were generated by replacing nucleotide sequences in various positions in the 1.2-kb IL-5 promoter with a 7-bp SalI or 6-bp XhoI linker sequences, using polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The resulting linker-scanning mutants contained 3-7-bp substitutions out of 6 or 7 bp at various positions in the context of the 1.2-kb IL-5 promoter (Fig. 3). These mutants were named according to the positions at which substitution linkers were introduced. To make the linker-scanning mutants LS971/965, PCR was performed with pmIL5Luc(1.2) as the template, M13 universal primer ((M13(−47)), and 1SA, an antisense strand oligonucleotide primer containing a SalI recognition site at nucleotide position −972 (Table 1). The resulting PCR product was digested with SacI (at the polylinker region) and SalI and was inserted into the SacI-SalI site of p964, a deletion mutant with a 5’-end point of −964 (Fig. 2). LS946/940, LS939/933, LS110/104, LS103/97, LS91/85, LS69/63, and LS57/51 were generated by essentially the same procedure. For the latter five mutants, p161, a deletion mutant whose 5’-end point is −161, was used as the template to minimize PCR-derived sequence and a sequence further upstream was attached using the SacI-NsiI (at nucleotide position −141) fragment of pmIL5Luc(1.2). To obtain LS954/949 and LS932/927, a pair of PCR amplifications was performed for each construct, as described(25Ausubel F.M. Brent R.E. Kingston D.M. Moor J.G. Seidman J.A. Sttruhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley and Sons, New York1991Google Scholar). Fragments upstream of the introduced mutations were generated using pmIL5Luc(1.2) as the template and M13(−47), and primers containing the XhoI recognition sites at the 5’-ends of the antisense strand oligonucleotides (Table 1). To generate downstream fragments, we used sense-strand oligonucleotide primers containing the XhoI linker sequence at the 5’-ends to overlap with the XhoI site of the upstream fragment, and antisense-strand oligonucleotide primer C1A (Table 1). The resulting upstream and downstream fragments were digested with SacI and XhoI, XhoI and BclI (at nucleotide position −800), respectively, and ligated between the SacI and BclI sites of pmIL5Luc(1.2). LS123/118, LS117/112, LS80/74, LS62/57, LS37/32 were generated essentially by the same procedure used for LS955/949 and LS933/927. For these constructions, we used p161 as the template and GLprimer2, a primer corresponding to the antisense strand of the luciferase structural gene (Promega Corp., Madison, WI) instead of C1A to generate downstream fragments. The resulting PCR fragments were cloned into the NsiI and HindIII (at nucleotide position +33) sites of pmIL5Luc(1.2). To generate pM1 to pM4 containing mutations in the IL-5P site, two steps of PCR were performed as described(25Ausubel F.M. Brent R.E. Kingston D.M. Moor J.G. Seidman J.A. Sttruhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley and Sons, New York1991Google Scholar). First, fragments upstream and downstream of point mutations were generated, using the same procedure as for LS124/118, except for use of sense and antisense oligonucleotides (Table 2, PM1 to PM4) used in the electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) instead of primers containing the XhoI linker sequence. Second step PCR amplifications were done using one-tenth of the fragments generated by first step PCR and M13(−47) and GLprimer2. The resulting fragments were inserted into the NsiI and HindIII sites of pmIL5Luc(1.2). To increase fidelity, PCR amplifications were performed for 15 cycles (four cycles with annealing at 45°C and 11 cycles at 65°C) with a large amount (100 ng) of template. The PCR-derived sequences of each construct were confirmed by DNA sequencing. The expression plasmids of NF-ATc and NF-ATx were constructed by inserting corresponding cDNAs downstream of the SRα promoter in pME18S(26Masuda E.S. Naito Y. Tokumitsu H. Campbell D. Saito F.

EL-4 cells were transfected with the serial deletion mutants shown schematically in the left panel. The cells were stimulated 24 h after transfection with either PMA (solid bars) or PMA and Bt2cAMP (cross-hatched bars), cell lysates were prepared 16 h later, and tested for luciferase activity, as described under “Materials and Methods.” Results represent the mean value of duplicate transfections.

Koyano-Nakagawa N. Naito Y. Nishida J. Arai N. Arai K. Yokota T. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 6135-6142PubMed Google Scholar). At 24 h after transfection, cells were stimulated with 1 mM Bt2cAMP (Sigma) and 10 ng/ml PMA (Calbiochem). After another 16 h, the cells were harvested for luciferase assays. Luciferase activity was determined using the luciferase assay substrate (Promega) with a luminometer (Berthold, Postfach, Germany). Protein concentration in an aliquot of each sample was measured using BCA reagents (Pierce), and the results were calculated as (relative light unit-background)/εg protein. Cells were stimulated for 3 h with various drugs, as described in figure legends, and nuclear extracts were prepared either by the method of Dignam et al.(27Dignam J.D. Levovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9164) Google Scholar) or as described(28Masuda E.S. Tokumitsu H. Tsuboi A. Shlomai J. Hung P. Arai K. Arai N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7399-7407Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). EMSAs were done using the double-stranded oligonucleotides given in Table 2. Each single-stranded oligonucleotide was purified on denaturing polyacrylamide gels before annealing. The annealed oligonucleotides were 32P-labeled with Klenow fragment and purified on a 12% polyacrylamide gels. The DNA-binding reactions were performed at room temperature for 30 min with 3-5 εg of nuclear extracts, 0.5 εg of poly(dI-dC), 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.9, 10% glycerol, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 100 mM KCl, and 50,000 counts/min of probe (∼0.5 ng) in a total volume of 10 εl. The samples were resolved on a 4% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel at 120 V in 1 × Tris-glycine-EDTA buffer, and the results were visualized by autoradiography. Extracts from transfected COS-7 cells were prepared as described(26Masuda E.S. Naito Y. Tokumitsu H. Campbell D. Saito F. Hannum C. Arai K. Arai N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2697-2706Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). We have previously reported that the 5’-flanking region of the IL-5 promoter extending from the SphI site at a nucleotide position about −1,200 to +33 relative to the transcription initiation site mediated induction by PMA and Bt2cAMP in EL-4 cells(16Lee H.J. Koyano-Nakagawa N. Naito Y. Nishida J. Arai N. Arai K. Yokota T. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 6135-6142PubMed Google Scholar). Since only a partial nucleotide sequence has been reported, we first determined the complete nucleotide sequence of this region and found a number of potential regulatory elements (Fig. 1). Next, to identify the region responsible for inducible expression of the IL-5 promoter in response to PMA and Bt2cAMP, the luciferase reporter plasmids carrying sequential 5’-deletions of the mouse IL-5 promoter were transiently transfected into EL-4 cells. The plasmid pUC00Luc, which has no upstream sequence derived from the IL-5 gene(16Lee H.J. Koyano-Nakagawa N. Naito Y. Nishida J. Arai N. Arai K. Yokota T. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 6135-6142PubMed Google Scholar), showed an almost negligible response to PMA or a combination of PMA and Bt2cAMP (Fig. 2). Removal of the 5’ sequence up to position 964 did not affect the promoter activity responding to PMA and Bt2cAMP, but deletions beyond this position through −932 did reduce the response by 50%. Further deletions up to position −140 led to no further reduction. Remarkably, the subsequent removal of nucleotides −140 through −80 diminished the promoter activity by 90%. Thus, the response to a combination of PMA and Bt2cAMP appears to decline in two stages, at the −964 to −933 (region I) and at the −140 to −80 (region II) (Fig. 2). On the other hand, the IL-5 promoter responded weakly to PMA alone, and removal of the 5’ sequences up to position −140 did not affect promoter activity responding to PMA, while deletions beyond this position almost completely abolished the response. Thus, the sequences between −140 to −80 (region II) of the IL-5 promoter are required for a response, albeit a weak one, to the PMA signal. To further delineate regulatory elements in the IL-5 promoter, we dissected regions shown to be important for promoter activity. Using the linker-scanning method, we replaced the sequence in various positions between −972 and −932, and between −124 and −31 in the 1.2-kb IL-5 promoter with a 7-bp SalI or 6-bp XhoI linker sequence (see “Materials and Methods”). We did not introduce mutations around −140, because we found that in further deletion analysis, the proximal regulatory region is located between −127 and −103 (data not shown). Consistent with results of the 5’-deletion analysis, mutations introduced between −948 and −933 (designated IL-5A) reduced promoter activity by 60% in response to PMA and Bt2cAMP but not to PMA alone (Fig. 3). Mutations introduced in the region extending from −117 to −92 (designated as IL-5P) reduced promoter activity by about 80%, in response to a combination of PMA and Bt2cAMP as well as to PMA alone. Mutation analyses allowed for definition of third and fourth elements, extending from −74 to −56 (designated IL-5C) and from −55 to −38 (designated IL-5CLE0), respectively. The IL-5C and IL-5CLE0 elements are located in close proximity, and mutation analysis has heretofore shown no clear boundary between them. However, we defined IL-5CLE0 in analogy with CLE0 of the GM-CSF gene, and the remaining sequence as IL-5C. These two elements are the most crucial for promoter activity, because mutations in these regions almost completely abolished promoter activity in response to PMA as well as to PMA and Bt2cAMP. Deletion and mutation analyses revealed that downstream sequences of −124 are critical for IL-5 promoter activity. Comparison of the mouse and human IL-5 promoters showed a high degree of homology within this region (Fig. 4A). Interestingly, closer inspection revealed that IL-5P is homologous to the binding site for NF-AT (Fig. 4B). NF-AT has also been implicated in transcriptional regulation of other lymphokine genes(20Masuda E.S. Naito Y. Arai N. Arai N. Immunologist. 1993; 1: 198-203Google Scholar, 21Rao A. Immunol. Today. 1994; 15: 274-281Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). We recently noted that the NF-AT site is a major target of the inhibitory action of cAMP on the IL-2 promoter(22Tsuruta L. Lee H.J. Masuda E.M. Koyano-Nakagawa N. Arai K. Arai N. Yokota T. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 5255-5264PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, we speculate that IL-5P may be involved in coordinated and differential regulation of the IL-5 gene and focused on further characterization of IL-5P. To identify nuclear factors that can mediate inducibility through IL-5P, EMSAs were done using a probe corresponding to the region extending from −119 to; 89 of the IL-5 promoter (Table 2). Nuclear extracts prepared from EL-4 cells stimulated with a combination of PMA and Bt2cAMP formed several complexes with the IL-5P probe (Fig. 5A). The major complex (designated NFIL-5P) appeared only when we used extracts prepared from stimulated cells (compare lanes 1 and 2), and this complex formation was specifically inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by excess unlabeled IL-5P oligonucleotide (lanes 2-5) but not by the Sp1 oligonucleotide (lanes 6-8). Other minor complexes with different mobilities could be detected, but appearance was variable, depending on different nuclear extract preparations, and they did not seem to be specific for IL-5P because binding was also inhibited by the Sp1 oligonucleotide (lanes 6-8). When EMSAs were done with nuclear extracts from EL-4 cells stimulated with different combinations of PMA and Bt2cAMP, the NFIL-5P complex was induced by either PMA or Bt2cAMP. The combination of both agents intensified the band (Fig. 5B, lanes 2-4). Interestingly, the NFIL-5P complex migrated with a different mobility, depending on the stimulation given. The control Sp1 binding was not altered by any of these stimuli (lanes 5-8). To identify specific bases critical for NFIL-5P complex formation, segments of IL-5P sequence were mutated and tested for effects on complex formation (Fig. 6A). The PM1 mutant oligonucleotide with a mutation in the GGA sequence did not form the NFIL-5P complex, but did retain the ability to form other minor complexes (Fig. 6B, lane 4). NFIL-5P binding was gradually restored as mutations were introduced into the segments closer to the 3’ portion of the IL-5P sequence (compare lanes 6, 9, 12, and 15). Competition analyses gave consistent results (data not shown). To search for a possible correlation between the in vitro formation of the NFIL-5P complex and in vivo activity of the IL-5 promoter, we introduced site-specific mutations corresponding to mutations introduced into the IL-5P probe for the EMSAs described above, in the context of the 1.2-kb IL-5 promoter. Constructs were transiently transfected into EL-4 cells and analyzed for luciferase activity (Fig. 6C). The results are shown along with the intensity of the NFIL-5P band elicited by each probe (Fig. 6B), as determined by PhosphorImage analyzer (Molecular Dynamics). Introduction of PM1, PM2, PM3, and PM5 mutations decreased IL-5 promoter activity by about 80%, in response to PMA and Bt2cAMP, whereas the PM4 mutation caused only a 50% decrease in promoter activity. Therefore, the in vivo activity of the IL-5 promoter correlated with the binding activity of NFIL-5P to the IL-5P site, i.e. the bases which were required for formation of the NFIL-5P complex in vitro were the same as those required for promoter activity. These results strongly suggest that NFIL-5P is the factor which regulates the IL-5 promoter through the IL-5P sequence. The IL-5 gene is expressed mainly in activated T cells. To determine the cell-type specificity of the NFIL-5P complex, EMSAs were done using nuclear extracts from a variety of cell types either unstimulated or stimulated with PMA, A23187, and Bt2cAMP (Fig. 7). The NFIL-5P complex appeared only in the stimulated EL-4, Jurkat T cell line, and pro-B cell line Ba/F3 cells (left panel, lanes 2, 4, and 6, respectively), while the AP1 complex was detected in all cell types tested (right panel). We next asked whether NFIL-5P and NF-AT were related. NF-AT is composed of a pre-existing cytoplasmic component, referred to as NF-ATp (29McCaffrey P.G. Perrino B.A. Soderling T.R. Rao A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3747-3752Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or NF-ATc(30Flanagan W.M. Corthesy B. Bram R.J. Crabtree G.R. Nature. 1991; 352: 803-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (954) Google Scholar), which is translocated into the nucleus in response to a calcium signal, and a newly synthesized nuclear component, which belongs to the AP1 family (30Flanagan W.M. Corthesy B. Bram R.J. Crabtree G.R. Nature. 1991; 352: 803-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (954) Google Scholar, 31Jain J. McCaffrey P.G. Valge A.V. Rao A. Nature. 1992; 356: 801-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). In EMSAs using nuclear extracts from EL-4 cells stimulated with PMA and Bt2cAMP, NFIL-5P and NF-AT complexes migrated with a similar mobility (Fig. 8A, lanes 1 and 7). NFIL-5P complex formation was completely inhibited by excess unlabeled NF-AT as well as by IL-5P oligonucleotides (lanes 2 and 5) but not by those mutated in GGA sequences (lanes 3 and 6). As expected, AP1 oligonucleotide also inhibited NFIL-5P complex formation (lane 4). Conversely, NF-AT binding was inhibited specifically by both excess unlabeled NF-AT and IL-5P oligonucleotides, indicating that NFIL-5P is an NF-AT-related complex (lanes 7-11). NF-AT binding is known to be inhibited by either cyclosporin A (CsA) (30Flanagan W.M. Corthesy B. Bram R.J. Crabtree G.R. Nature. 1991; 352: 803-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (954) Google Scholar) or the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide (CHX)(19Shaw J.P. Utz P.J. Durand D.B. Toole J.J. Emmel E.A. Crabtree G.R.

We then tested sensitivity of the NFIL-5P complex to CsA and CHX; treatment of CsA inhibited the induction of NFIL-5P complex in cells stimulated with PMA and Bt2cAMP, in a dose-dependent manner similar to that seen for NF-AT binding (Fig. 8B, top and central panels, lanes 2 and 3). Induction of both the NFIL-5P and NF-AT complexes was almost completely inhibited by treatment with 10 εg of CHX (lanes 4 and 5). This inhibition was not caused by nonspecific effects of these reagents on nuclear proteins, since there was no change in Sp1 binding, under the same conditions (bottom panel). To determine whether an NF-AT component is involved in the NFIL-5P complex, supershift EMSAs were done (Fig. 8C). Both NFIL-5P and NF-AT complexes (la"

Damaged pyrimidine and purine bases were recognized and cleaved by the Nth and Fpg proteins from Escherichia coli, respectively. Strand breaks and modified bases were induced in vitro by copper ion-mediated reduction of hydrogen peroxide in the presence of ascorbate; reactant concentrations were adjusted to induce lesions at a frequency of 1 per 2-3 kilobases in purified genomic DNA. Glyoxal gel analysis demonstrated that the ratio of induced strand breaks to induced base damage was 0.8/2.7 in DNA dialyzed extensively to remove adventitious transition metal ions. Ligation-mediated polymerase chain reaction analysis of the damage frequency in the promoter region of the transcriptionally active phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK 1) gene revealed that Cu(II)/ascorbate/H2O2 caused DNA base damage by a sequence-dependent mechanism, with the 5’ bases of d(pGn) and d(pCn) being damage hot spots, as were the most internal guanines of d(pGGGCCC) and d(pCCCGGG). Since base damage occurs after formation of a DNA-Cu(I)-H2O2 complex, these data suggest that the local DNA sequence affects formation of DNA-Cu(I)-H2O2 complexes and/or the efficiency of base oxidation during resolution of this complex.

The ligation-mediated polymerase chain reaction (LMPCR) is an extremely sensitive technique for mapping the frequency of rare DNA breaks along genes at nucleotide resolution(35Pfeifer G.P. Drouin R.

We have used LMPCR in conjunction with Nth protein (also designated endonuclease III) and Fpg protein (also designated formamidopyrimidine glycosylase), enzymes which recognize and cleave DNA at oxidized bases, to map in vitro copper/H2O2-induced DNA damage along the PGK 1 gene of male human fibroblast DNA. Our results demonstrate that copper/H2O2-induced base damage in genomic DNA is nonrandom, exhibiting marked local sequence dependence. Human male skin fibroblasts were grown in 150-mm2 dishes to confluent monolayers in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were harvested, and DNA was isolated as described previously (40Pfeifer G.P. Steigerwald S.D. Mueller P.R. Wold B. Riggs A.D. Science. 1989; 246: 810-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar).2 2R. Drouin, H. Rodriguez, S.-W. Gao, Z. Gebreyes, T. R. O'Connor, G. P. Holmquist, and S. A. Akman, submitted for publication. After phenol/chloroform extraction, the DNA was precipitated in ethanol, redissolved in 10 mM HEPES, 1 mM EDTA, pH 7.4, at 70 εg/ml, then dialyzed against distilled water overnight at 4°C.2 This treatment has been described in detail elsewhere.2 Briefly, 10 εg of dialyzed DNA incubated at room temperature for 30 min with 50 εM CuCl2. Following this, Chelex™-treated potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, ascorbate, and H2O2 were added to final concentrations of 1 mM, 100 εM, and 5 mM, respectively. The final volume was 268 εl. The reaction proceeded for 30 min at room temperature with gentle rocking. The reaction was quenched by addition of EDTA to 2 mM, followed by precipitation of DNA with 0.3 M sodium acetate, pH 7.0, and 70% ethanol. The DNA pellets were air-dried. The “no treatment” samples went through the same steps except that stock solutions of CuCl2, ascorbate, and H2O2 were replaced by H2O. Treated DNA was analyzed for lesion types and frequency by glyoxal gel electrophoresis as described elsewhere (Footnote 2, as modified from (41Ogden R.C. Adams D.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 152: 61-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar)). For all enzyme digestions, 10-εg aliquots of DNA were digested in a volume of 100 εl, and all incubations with the enzymes were done at 37°C for 60 min. The “no enzyme” samples were incubated at 37°C in the Nth protein buffer. DNA aliquots were digested in 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 100 mM KCl, 1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0, 0.1 mM dithiothreitol, and 100 εg/ml bovine serum albumin.2 Enzyme was added in 5 εl of dilution buffer (10% glycerol, 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 100 mM KCl, 1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0, 0.1 mM dithiothreitol, and 500 εg/ml bovine serum albumin). DNA aliquots were digested in 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.6, 100 mM KCl, 1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0, 1 mM dithiothreitol, and 50 εg/ml bovine serum albumin. Two εl of the stock enzyme solution (about 1.7 mg/ml in 50% glycerol and 10 mM HEPES) were added and incubated for 30 min. One additional εl of the enzyme was added for the last 30 min of the incubation period. DNA aliquots were digested in 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 50 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0, 1 mM dithiothreitol, and 100 εg/ml bovine serum albumin(42Pfeifer G.P. Drouin R. Riggs A.D. Holmquist G.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 12: 1798-1804Crossref Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Four εl of the stock enzyme solution (about 150 εg/ml in 25 mM NaH2PO4, pH 6.8, 100 mM NaCl, and 1 mM EDTA) were added and incubated for 30 min. Another three εl of the enzyme were added for the last 30 min of the incubation period. For all enzymes, digestions were stopped by adding 250 εl of H2O and 50 εl of 0.8% SDS and mixing well. Phenol/phenol-chloroform/chloroform extractions were carried out to remove the proteins. DNA was precipitated by a 10-min incubation on dry ice after addition of 18 εl of 5 M NaCl and 1000 εl of cold 100% ethanol. The air-dried pellet was dissolved either with the mix for glyoxal gel (extraction not necessary when for gel only) or Sequenase buffer (40 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.7, and 50 mM NaCl) at a concentration of 0.16 εg/εl in preparation for LMPCR. The 5’ control region and first exon (positions −436 to +371) for human phosphoglycerate kinase 1 (PGK 1) (43Singer-Sam J. Keith D.H. Tani K. Simmer R.L. Shively L. Lindsay S. Yoshida A. Riggs A.D. Gene (Amst.). 1984; 32: 409-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) was subcloned in Bluescript SK+ (Stratagene). After digestion with XbaI, XhoI, and SacI, the fragments were labeled at the 3’ end of the upper strand with Escherichia coli DNA polymerase (Klenow fragment) and [32P]dCTP. For T + C and G + A samples, the labeled fragments were mixed with 14 εg of herring sperm carrier DNA and were subjected to base-specific chemical DNA sequencing(38Pfeifer G.P. Riggs A.D. Methods Mol. Biol. 1993; 23: 169-181PubMed Google Scholar). For KMnO4 and methylene blue treatment, the labeled fragments were mixed with 10 εg of genomic human DNA. (a) The labeled fragments and genomic DNA were treated with 1 mM KMnO4 in 0.3 M ammonium chloride, pH 8.6, and allowed to react at room temperature for 15 min(8Akman S.A. Forrest G.P. Doroshow J.H. Dizdaroglu M. Mutat. Res. 1991; 261: 123-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The treated DNA was cleaved with different amounts of Nth protein. (b) The labeled fragments and genomic DNA were dissolved in a 200-εl solution containing 10 mM potassium phosphate, pH 7.6, buffer and 2 mM methylene blue and exposed to white light (100-watt tungstram 7 Sylvania bulb) in a microtiter plate at a distance of 17 cm from the light bulb(44Schneider J.E. Price S. Maidt L. Gutteridge J.M. Floyd R.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 631-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). The treated DNA was cleaved with different amounts of Fpg protein. The enzyme-treated samples were phenol/chloroform-extracted and ethanol-precipitated. All samples were separated by electrophoresis through 8% polyacrylamide-7 M urea gels, followed by autoradiography. The LMPCR protocols used for this work were modified from Pfeifer et al.(40Pfeifer G.P. Steigerwald S.D. Mueller P.R. Wold B. Riggs A.D. Science. 1989; 246: 810-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). The procedure can be divided into six steps: 1) primer extension of an annealed gene-specific oligonucleotide (primer 1) to generate blunt ends, 2) ligation of a universal asymmetric double-strand linker, 3) PCR amplification using a second gene-specific oligonucleotide (primer 2), 4) separation of the DNA fragments on a sequencing polyacrylamide gel, 5) transfer of the DNA to a nylon membrane by electroblotting, 6) hybridization of a radiolabeled probe prepared by repeated primer extension using a third gene-specific oligonucleotide (primer 3). About 500 base pairs, on both strands, of the human PGK 1 gene, including the promoter region and the first exon, were studied using the primer sets described in Table 1. DNA purified from HeLa cells was treated with base-specific chemical cleaving agents (38Pfeifer G.P. Riggs A.D. Methods Mol. Biol. 1993; 23: 169-181PubMed Google Scholar). Chemically cleaved G, G + A, T + C, and C samples were run along with the other samples through LMPCR and were included on the sequencing gels to provide base position markers.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab Primer 1 was extended in siliconized 0.625-ml tubes; a thermocycler (MJ Research Inc.) was used for all incubations. DNA (1.28 εg) was diluted in a volume of 15-18 εl of a solution containing 40 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.7, 50 mM NaCl, and 1 pmol of primer 1. DNA was denatured at 98°C for 3 min and the primer annealed at 48-50°C for 15-20 min. After cooling on ice, 9.0 εl of the following mix were added: 7.5 εl of MgCl2-dNTP mix (20 mM MgCl2, 20 mM dithiothreitol, and 0.25 mM of each dNTP), 1.1 εl H2O, and 0.4 εl of Sequenase 2.0 (13 units/εl, U. S. Biochemical Corp.). The samples were incubated at 48-49°C for 5 min, 50°C for 1 min, 51°C for 1 min, 52°C for 1 min, 54°C for 1 min, 56°C for 1 min, 58°C for 1 min, and 60°C for 1 min. The samples were cooled on ice and 6 εl of ice-cold 310 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.7, was added. The samples were incubated at 67°C for 15 min to inactivate Sequenase, then cooled on ice. The primer-extended molecules that have a 5’ phosphate were ligated to an unphosphorylated synthetic asymmetric double-stranded linker(45Mueller P.R. Wold B. Science. 1989; 246: 780-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (787) Google Scholar). To each microtube, 45 εl of the following mix was added: 13.33 mM MgCl2, 30 mM dithiothreitol, 1 mM ATP, 83.3 εg/ml bovine serum albumin, 100 pmol of linker, and 6.25 units of T4 DNA ligase (5 units/εl, Boehringer Mannheim). The samples were incubated overnight at 18°C. Then, while kept on ice, 25 εl of 10 M ammonium acetate, 1 εl of 0.5 M EDTA, pH 8.0, 1 εl of 20 εg/εl glycogen, and 260 εl of ice-cold 100% ethanol were added to stop the reaction and precipitate the DNA. DNA pellets were redissolved in 50 εl of water. 50 εl of the Taq polymerase mix (0.02% gelatin, 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.9, 4 mM MgCl2, 80 mM KCl, 0.25 mM of each dNTP, 10 pmol of primer 2, 10 pmol of linker primer (LP25), and 3.0 units of Taq DNA polymerase (5 units/εl, Boehringer Mannheim) were added to each sample, and the reaction was overlaid with mineral oil. Reactions underwent 22 PCR cycles of 95°C for 1 min, 61-73°C (1-2°C below Tm of primer 2) for 2 min, and 74°C for 3 min. The following stop mix was added under the mineral oil layer: 13 εl of 3 M sodium acetate, pH 5.2, 3 εl of 0.5 M EDTA, pH 8.0, and 9 εl of H2O. The samples were extracted with 250 εl of premixed phenol:chloroform (92 εl:158 εl), then ethanol-precipitated. Air-dried DNA pellets were dissolved in 7.0 εl of premixed formamide dye (1 part water, 2 parts 94% formamide, 2 mM EDTA, pH 7.7, 0.05% xylene cyanole, 0.05% bromphenol blue) (38Pfeifer G.P. Riggs A.D. Methods Mol. Biol. 1993; 23: 169-181PubMed Google Scholar) in preparation for sequencing gel electrophoresis. Half (3.5 εl) of each DNA sample was electrophoresed through 60-cm 8% polyacrylamide-7 M urea gels at 70 watts constant power. The DNA was transferred to a charged nylon membrane (Qiabrane, Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA) by electroblotting using an HEP3 electroblotting apparatus (Owl Scientific Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Blotted DNA was UV-cross-linked (1200 joules/m2) to the membranes. The [32P]dCTP-labeled single-stranded probe was prepared by repeated linear primer extension, between 30 and 35 cycles, by Taq polymerase with primer 3 (see Table 1) on a double-stranded template of the PGK 1 gene cloned in Bluescript(43Singer-Sam J. Keith D.H. Tani K. Simmer R.L. Shively L. Lindsay S. Yoshida A. Riggs A.D. Gene (Amst.). 1984; 32: 409-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Primer 3 is downstream from primer 2 to increase specificity. To avoid long probes, PGK plasmid was cut with different restriction enzymes: ApaI for A3, C3, J3, and O3; AluI for E3; EcoRI for D3; BssHII for G3 and F3; DdeI for H3; and HaeIII for N3. The 150-εl mix consists of: 0.01% gelatin, 2 mM MgCl2, 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.9, 40 mM KCl, 250 εM of dATP, dGTP, and dTTP, 40 ng of template, 75 pmol of primer 3, 2.5 units of Taq polymerase, and 10 εl of [32P]dCTP (3000 Ci/mmol). The probe was precipitated with 37.5 εl of 10 M ammonium acetate, 20 εg of glycogen, and 420 εl of ice-cold 100% ethanol, resuspended in TE buffer (TE, 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA), then added to the hybridization tube containing the prehybridized membrane in 5-6 ml of hybridization solution. After overnight hybridization at 62-68°C (2°C below the calculated Tm of the probe), the membrane was washed as described(38Pfeifer G.P. Riggs A.D. Methods Mol. Biol. 1993; 23: 169-181PubMed Google Scholar). Air-dried membranes were exposed to Kodak XAR-5 x-ray films for 0.5-8 h with intensifying screens at −70°C. On the final autoradiogram, each band represents a nucleotide position where a break was induced, and the signal intensity of the band reflects the number of DNA molecules with ligatable ends terminating at that position. The intensity of the bands was evaluated visually and confirmed by PhosphorImager scans. The intensity of each band was plotted on a scale from “0” (no band), to “5” (the most intense band) after normalization to the corresponding Maxam-Gilbert sequence lane, in order to allow for nonlinearity of the primer extension and linker ligation steps. The prerequisite to LMPCR, cleavage which leaves terminal 5’-phosphoryl groups at the sites of oxidative base damage, can be accomplished chemically, e.g. by treating damaged DNA with hot piperidine(31Yamamoto K. Kawanishi S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15435-15440Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Sagripanti J.-L. Kraemer K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 1729-1734Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, chemical cleavage produces a high background of nonspecifically cleaved nucleotide positions and limits sensitivity to extremely high mutagen doses(37Pfeifer G.P. Drouin R. Holmquist G.P. Mutat. Res. 1993; 288: 39-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Two enzymes responsible for the excision of a variety of modified DNA bases induced by ROS are the Nth and Fpg proteins of E. coli. The Nth protein cleaves the N-glycosidic bond of most oxidatively damaged pyrimidine bases(46Dizdaroglu M. Laval J. Boiteux S. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 12105-12111Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 47Hatahet Z. Kow Y.W. Purmal A.A. Cunningham R.P. Wallace S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18814-18820Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas Fpg protein similarly cleaves the N-glycosidic bond of most oxidatively damaged purine bases(48Tchou J. Kasai H. Shibutani S. Chung M.-H. Laval J. Grollman A.P. Nishimura S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4690-4694Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar, 49Boiteux S. Gajewski E. Laval J. Dizdaroglu M. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 106-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar). Both of these enzymes possess a lyase activity that subsequently cleaves at all abasic sites, leaving terminal 5’-phosphoryl groups, the substrate for DNA ligase whose frequency distribution is mapped by LMPCR. The rate of endonuclease-dependent cleavage of damaged base positions may depend on the local sequence. If true, this would produce misleading LMPCR lesion frequency patterns that would vary with the degree of endonuclease digestion. Consequently, we developed terminal endonuclease digestion conditions so that incision occurred at all cleavable adducts independent of sequence-related rate differences. To determine conditions in which digestion is terminal and sequence-independent, a plasmid bearing the PGK 1 promoter region and first exon, 32P-labeled at its 3’ end, was treated with KMnO4 or methylene blue-white light. KMnO4 treatment induces pyrimidine damage, primarily thymine glycol(8Akman S.A. Forrest G.P. Doroshow J.H. Dizdaroglu M. Mutat. Res. 1991; 261: 123-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), which is cleaved by Nth protein. White light-activated methylene blue induces modified purines, primarily 8-oxoguanine(44Schneider J.E. Price S. Maidt L. Gutteridge J.M. Floyd R.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 631-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), which are cleaved by Fpg protein. The treated plasmids were linearized, diluted to single copy level with human genomic DNA, and then 10 εg of DNA was cleaved by either the Nth or Fpg proteins followed by sequencing gel autoradiography. Bands along the PGK 1 promoter region, as generated by cleavage with either endonuclease, increased in intensity with increasing enzyme added over a range of 0-500 ng for Nth protein (Fig. 2A) or 0-250 ng for Fpg protein (Fig. 2B); no pattern change, and no further cleavage at any position was achieved by addition of >500 ng of either protein. These data suggest that detection and cleavage of ROS-modified bases by these two enzymes at high enzyme concentrations, terminal digestion conditions, is independent of DNA sequence and represents 100% cleavage of every potentially cleavable position. To further show that these two endonucleases as used in subsequent LMPCR studies resulted in terminal digestion, human genomic DNA was treated with either KMnO4 or white light-activated methylene blue and cleaved with various concentrations of Nth and Fpg protein before glyoxal gel analysis. The size distributions of single-stranded DNA fragments displayed on the glyoxal gels (Fig. 3) show that reactions containing 250 ng or more of each enzyme terminally cleaved 10 εg of damaged genomic DNA. After establishing enzyme conditions to terminally digest DNA at sites of oxidatively damaged bases, we determined the frequency of lesions induced by copper ion-mediated reduction of H2O2. We used glyoxal gel electrophoresis (Fig. 4) instead of alkaline electrophoresis to visualize the single stranded Mr distribution while avoiding cleavage of alkali-sensitive sites. In such a gel mobility analysis, Mw, the weight average molecular weight, approximately coincides with the peak density of mass distribution (50Willis C.K. Willis D.G. Holmquist G.P. Appl. Theor. Electrophoresis. 1988; 1: 11-18PubMed Google Scholar), and Mn, the number average Mr, is equal to Mw/2. The density of DNA breaks is 1/Mn(37Pfeifer G.P. Drouin R. Holmquist G.P. Mutat. Res. 1993; 288: 39-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 50Willis C.K. Willis D.G. Holmquist G.P. Appl. Theor. Electrophoresis. 1988; 1: 11-18PubMed Google Scholar). The dependence of induction of breaks and base modification density on Cu(II) and H2O2 concentration was determined previously.2 Treatment of DNA with 50 εM Cu(II), 100 εM ascorbate, and 5 mM H2O2 for 30 min at room temperature induced 2.7 glycosylase-sensitive sites/10 kb (Table 2). This is a sufficient lesion frequency for LMPCR mapping(37Pfeifer G.P. Drouin R. Holmquist G.P. Mutat. Res. 1993; 288: 39-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), and these conditions were used in all subsequent LMPCR analyses.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab To determine the frequency of various classes of DNA lesions induced by this treatment, treated and untreated (incubated in b"

To gain insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying PKR's growth regulatory properties, we examined the biological and biochemical properties of PKR variants containing either a mutation in catalytic domain II (PKR-M1) or a deletion of RNA binding domain I (PKR-M7) in both reticulocyte translation extracts and in vitro kinase assays with purified reagents and compared these results with those using the same mutants stably expressed in vivo. While wild-type PKR (PKR-WT) efficiently inhibited mRNA translation in a reticulocyte extract, the inactive PKR-M1 had no effect. The PKR-M7 mutant was modestly inhibitory in this assay. The PKR-M1 variant was able to reverse the translational inhibitory effects and increased eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF)-2α phosphorylation levels caused by addition of double-stranded RNA to reticulocyte extract, whereas PKR-M7 could not. Both PKR-M1 and PKR-M7 functioned as transdominant inhibitors of PKR-WT in our in vitro kinase assays. While the inhibition by PKR-M1 required a vast excess of mutant to shut down PKR function, PKR-M7 inhibited PKR-WT at approximately stoichiometric levels. To complement these experiments, we compared growth rates and α phosphorylation levels in transformed cell lines overexpressing either PKR-M1 or PKR-M7. Levels of endogenous eIF-2α phosphorylation were significantly more diminished in PKR-M7 overexpressing cells compared with PKR-M1. These paradoxical data will be discussed in terms of the potential molecular mechanisms underlying malignant transformation caused by the PKR variants.

The interferon-induced, ds1RNA-dependent protein kinase, 1The abbreviations used are: dsdouble-strandedPKRdsRNA-dependent protein kinaseeIFeukaryotic initiation factor. PKR, is the most studied member of the eIF-2α-specific kinase subfamily(1Meurs E. Chong K.L. Galabru J. Thomas N. Kerr I. Williams B.R.G. Hovanessian A.G.

Other members of this family include the reticulocyte lysate heme-sensitive eIF-2α kinase, commonly referred to as HCR or HRI (3Chen J. Pal J. Throop M.S. Gehrke L. Kuo I. Pal J.K. Brodsky M.

Cigan A.M. Donahue T.F. Hinnebusch A.G. Cell. 1992; 68: 585-596Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar). PKR is a cAMP-independent, serine-threonine kinase, characterized by two distinct kinase activities: first an autophosphorylation, which represents the activation reaction; and second, phosphorylation of eIF-2α(5Galabru J.

This second phosphorylation event can lead to limitations in functional eIF-2 and a resultant inhibition in protein synthesis inhibition(7Hershey J.W.B. Annu. Rev.

Chem. 1993; 268: 3017-3020Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to its translational regulatory role, recent evidence now suggests that PKR may play a role in signal transduction and transcriptional control, possibly through the I-κB/NF-κB pathway(10Kumar A.

PKR was initially identified as an interferon-inducible enzyme that may become activated during virus infection and thus play an important role in the regulation of protein synthesis in infected cells(12Samuel C.E.

More recently PKR, which is constitutively expressed in mammalian cells, has been implicated as playing a role in the control of cell growth and proliferation(16Koromilas A.E. Roy S. Barber G.N. Katze M.G. Sonneberg N. Science. 1992; 257: 1685-1689Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar, 17Lengyel P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The expression of wild-type human PKR cDNA in yeast caused increased phosphorylation of eIF-2α, a reduction in protein synthetic rates, and a decreased proliferation rate(19Chong K.L. Schappert K.

Conversely, the transfection of cDNAs encoding nonfunctional PKR variants into murine cells resulted in malignant transformation, as measured by their ability to produce tumors in nude mice, suggesting a possible tumor suppressor role for PKR(16Koromilas A.E. Roy S. Barber G.N. Katze M.G. Sonneberg N. Science. 1992; 257: 1685-1689Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar, 18Meurs E. Galabru J. Barber G.N. Katze M.G. Hovanessian A.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 232-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). The nonfunctional variants of PKR have included a mutant in catalytic domain II, in which the essential lysine at position 296 has been changed to an arginine (18Meurs E. Galabru J. Barber G.N. Katze M.G. Hovanessian A.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 232-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar), the DII or PKR-M1 variant, as well as a mutant in which a crucial 6-amino acid segment (Δ6) has been deleted(16Koromilas A.E. Roy S. Barber G.N. Katze M.G. Sonneberg N. Science. 1992; 257: 1685-1689Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). More recently we have determined that introduction of PKR regulatory domain variants, which completely lack the first RNA binding domain (referred to as PKR-M7), into NIH 3T3 cells also induced their malignant transformation (21Barber G.N. Wambach M. Thompson S. Jagus R. Katze M.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3138-3146Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The current study was undertaken to begin to define the molecular mechanisms underlying the transforming action of two separate PKR variants, the catalytically dead PKR-M1 (18Meurs E. Galabru J.

Wambach M. Thompson S. Jagus R. Katze M.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3138-3146Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Utilizing purified recombinant PKR variants, we present evidence that PKR-M1 and PKR-M7 have different effects on protein synthetic activity in reticulocyte lysate, although both can function in vitro as dominant negative inhibitors of the wild-type PKR (PKR-WT). However, our in vitro data, taken together with the eIF-2α phosphorylation results acquired from the PKR-M1 and PKR-M7 overexpressing cell lines, suggests that the transdominant transforming action of PKR-M7 is through a translational regulatory pathway, whereas PKR-M1 may trigger transformation through an eIF-2α-independent pathway. Expression of recombinant wild-type PKR was carried out in Escherichia coli as described by Barber et al.(23Barber G.N. Tomita J. Hovanessian A.G. Meurs E. Katze M.G. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 10356-10361Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The PKR-M1 catalytically inactive domain II mutant (Lys → Arg296) was constructed and expressed in insect cells using the baculovirus expression system as described previously(24Barber G.N. Tomita J. Garfinkel M.S. Hovanessian A.G. Meurs E. Katze M.G. Virology. 1992; 191: 670-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The PKR-M7 regulatory domain variant (24Barber G.N. Tomita J. Garfinkel M.S. Hovanessian A.G. Meurs E. Katze M.G. Virology. 1992; 191: 670-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) was expressed as a histidine-tagged fusion protein. This vector was constructed by introducing a NdeI site at the second ATG methionine at amino acid position 98 with the resultant fragment cloned into the pET15b vector (Novagen)(25Lee T.G. Tang N.

Tang N. Thompson S. Miller J. Katze M.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2331-2342Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined by comparing the purified PKR proteins with bovine serum albumin standards after SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Coomassie Blue staining. PKR autophosphorylation and substrate phosphorylation assays were conducted as described by Katze et al.(22Katze M.G. Wambach M. Wong M.-L. Garfinkel M.S. Meurs E. Chong K.L. Williams B.R.G. Hovanessian A.G. Barber G.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 5497-5505Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Briefly purified recombinant PKR was incubated in low salt buffer containing 100 mM KCl, 25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 10% glycerol, 2 mM MgCl2, 2 mM MnCl2, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 3 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 5 εM [γ-32P]ATP, 1000 Ci/mmol). Activator poly(I): poly(C) was added to the mix together with purified rabbit eIF-2 as described(22Katze M.G. Wambach M. Wong M.-L. Garfinkel M.S. Meurs E. Chong K.L. Williams B.R.G. Hovanessian A.G.

Methods Enzymol. 1987; 152: 267-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). For analysis in PKR overexpressing cell lines, cells at similar densities were rinsed twice in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.2, 2 mM EDTA, 100 mM KCl, .05% SDS, 0.5% Elugent, 10% glycerol, 20 εg/ml chymostatin, 50 nM microcystin, 1 mM dithiothreitol. The 10,000 × g supernatant was clarified with BPA-1000 (Toso-Haas, Philadelphia). Supernatant (100 εg of protein) was first subjected to immunoprecipitation using eIF-2α-specific monoclonal antibody. Immunoprecipitates were then resuspended in the VSIEF sample buffer and fractionated by vertical slab gel electrophoresis (27Carroll K. Elroy-Stein O. Moss R. Jagus R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12837-12842Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to separate phosphorylated from nonphosphorylated forms of eIF-2α. For reticulocyte analysis, aliquots of the lysate were taken and similarly treated. Proteins were transferred to Immobilon P and subjected to immunoblotting using monoclonal antibody to eIF-2α(27Carroll K. Elroy-Stein O. Moss R. Jagus R. J. Biol.

To determine growth rates, cells were plated at 5 × 104/60-mm dish and cell density determined at absorbance at 600 nm and recorded every 24 h. Prior to trypsinization, cell monolayers were extensively washed to remove dead cells. Cell medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 200 εg/ml G418, plus 10% fetal calf serum) was replaced daily. We previously reported that cell lines overexpressing the PKR-M1 and PKR-M7 variants were malignantly transformed and tumorigenic in nude mice(18Meurs E. Galabru J. Barber G.N. Katze M.G.

To accomplish this goal, highly purified PKR proteins were prepared and their activities analyzed both in reticulocyte lysate and in vitro kinase assays. The recombinant PKR-WT and PKR-M1 kinases were prepared from E. coli(23Barber G.N. Tomita J. Hovanessian A.G. Meurs E. Katze M.G.

Virology. 1992; 191: 670-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), respectively, and immunopurified using PKR-specific monoclonal antibody bound to CnBr-activated Sepharose(26Laurent A.G. Krust B. Galabru J. Svab J. Hovanessian A.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 4341-4345Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Since this monoclonal antibody fails to react with PKR variants lacking RNA binding domain I(22Katze M.G. Wambach M. Wong M.-L. Garfinkel M.S. Meurs E. Chong K.L. Williams B.R.G. Hovanessian A.G. Barber G.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 5497-5505Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), we expressed PKR-M7 as a histidine fusion protein which can be readily purified by passage over a nickel column. The recombinant wild-type and mutant proteins were first analyzed for their effects on protein synthesis regulation in reticulocyte extracts (Fig. 1A). While PKR-WT dramatically reduced protein synthetic rates, the catalytically inactive PKR-M1 had no effect on mRNA translation in the reticulocyte extracts. The decrease caused by PKR-WT occurred in the absence of added dsRNA, thus suggesting that activation is caused by either endogenous RNAs or other polyanions present in the lysate. Moreover the protein kinase is already partially active when purified from E. coli(23Barber G.N. Tomita J. Hovanessian A.G. Meurs E. Katze M.G. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 10356-10361Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In contrast to PKR-M1, the RNA binding domain variant, PKR-M7, did reduce translation rates in these extracts at high concentrations, although minimally compared with PKR-WT. We then correlated the variants' effects on translation with an analysis of endogenous eIF-2α phosphorylation in these extracts (Fig. 1B). Several conclusions can be made concerning these experiments. (i) In the absence of added PKR, levels of α phosphorylation in the lysates are minimal (Fig. 1B, lane 3). (ii) Addition of 10 εg/ml PKR-WT caused essentially a 100% conversion to phosphorylated eIF-2α in the reticulocyte extracts (lane 8). (iii) Addition of PKR-M1 had little effect on endogenous α phosphorylation levels and even appeared to reduce levels at the lower concentrations tested. (iv) Due to its minimal functional activity, PKR-M7 did increase α phosphorylation, although modestly compared with PKR-WT. It should be emphasized that we measure the steady state levels of α phosphorylation and not the rate of phosphorylation by PKR in these in vitro assays. We proceeded to utilize the reticulocyte system to further examine the differing biological properties of PKR-M1 and PKR-M7. It is well established that addition of dsRNA to reticulocyte lysates severely compromises mRNA translation rates presumably due to activation of the endogenous rabbit PKR(31Farrell P.J. Balkow K. Hunt T. Jackson R.J. Trachsel H. Cell. 1977; 11: 187-200Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). We took advantage of this system to test whether PKR-M1 or PKR-M7 could interfere with activation of the endogenous kinase by the addition of dsRNA. In the presence of 150 ng/ml poly(I): poly(C), protein synthesis became inhibited after a lag period, reducing the incorporation of [14C]valine by 35-40% after a 30-min incubation (Fig. 2A). The addition of increasing levels of PKR-M1 restored protein synthesis nearly to control levels. Approximately 7.5 εg/ml of the PKR-M1 variant, equivalent to to more than 10 pmol of PKR-M1/100 εl, was needed to completely restore protein synthetic activity, a level considerably higher than the estimated endogenous level of PKR of less than 0.1 pmol/100 εl of reticulocyte lysate.2 2M. Gray and R. Jagus, unpublished observations. Since further addition of dsRNA could reverse this restoration (data not shown), it is likely that PKR-M1 is functioning to inhibit the endogenous PKR by sequestering the activator. In contrast to the recovery of mRNA translation caused by PKR-M1, the regulatory domain variant PKR-M7 failed to reverse the inhibitory effects of dsRNA (Fig. 3A). Consistent with its inability to bind to and therefore sequester dsRNA, the highest concentrations of PKR-M7 had modest effects on protein synthetic rates. Examination of endogenous eIF-2α phosphorylation levels confirmed the protein synthesis data. Whereas the catalytically inactive PKR-M1 variant quantitatively reduced α phosphorylation levels in the presence of dsRNA (Fig. 2B), PKR-M7 had no effects on these phosphorylation levels (Fig. 3B).Figure 3:Effects of PKR-M7 on translational inhibition by dsRNA addition and hemin deprivation in the reticulocyte translation system. A, cell-free extracts of rabbit reticulocytes were incubated as indicated in the absence or presence of 150 ng/ml dsRNA poly(I): poly(C) and in the presence of 1 εM hemin. Separate incubations were carried out in the absence of hemin (-h). Indicated amounts of pure PKR-M7 were added to reactions and protein synthetic activity measured as described above. B, eIF-2α phosphorylation levels were measured separately in the presence of dsRNA (+dsRNA) and the absence of hemin (-h) after incubation with increasing amounts of PKR-M7 as described in the legend to Fig. 1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The reticulocyte translation system also contains a heme-sensitive eIF-2α kinase that can be activated by incubation in the absence of added hemin(3Chen J. Pal J. Throop M.S. Gehrke L. Kuo I. Pal J.K. Brodsky M. London I.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7729-7733Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). This can be used to test whether the different PKR variants can act as dominant negative inhibitors by binding to eIF-2α and preventing its phosphorylation. If this occurred one would expect an enhancement of protein synthesis rates and resultant decrease in α phosphorylation levels in hemin-deprived lysates. However, neither PKR-M1 (Fig. 2A) nor PKR-M7 (Fig. 3A) were able to prevent the severe decreases in protein synthetic rates caused by the omission of hemin. Similarly neither variant prevented the increases in eIF-2α phosphorylation levels caused by the absence of hemin (Fig. 2B and 3B). These data strongly suggest that any transdominant effects of the PKR-M1 or PKR-M7 variants observed in vivo or in vitro is unlikely due to sequestration of the PKR substrate. Thus far we have examined the biological properties of the variants in reticulocyte extracts but have not yet directly demonstrated that PKR-M7 or PKR-M1 can act as transdominant inhibitors in vitro. To accomplish this and examine the stoichiometry of such a reaction, we analyzed the enzymatic activity of PKR-WT which was incubated with either the catalytic or regulatory domain variants. In the absence of any variant, the PKR-WT efficiently phosphorylated exogenously added eIF-2α in the presence of poly(I): poly(C) (Fig. 4A, lane 1). The addition of increasing amounts of PKR-M1 variant reduced the phosphorylation of eIF-2α (Fig. 4A, lanes 2-6). However, levels of PKR-M1 up to 10 times higher than the levels of wild type were required to significantly reduce α phosphorylation. We could not observe a decrease in PKR-WT autophosphorylation due to the concomitant increased phosphorylation of the 68-kDa polypeptide which likely results from trans-phosphorylation of PKR-M1 by PKR-WT (since both PKR proteins comigrate) as also observed by others(32Thomis D.C. Samuel C.E. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 7695-7700Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PKR-M1 alone is catalytically dead and unable to autophosphorylate itself(22Katze M.G. Wambach M. Wong M.-L. Garfinkel M.S. Meurs E. Chong K.L. Williams B.R.G. Hovanessian A.G. Barber G.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 5497-5505Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Importantly, the ability of PKR-M1 to prevent phosphorylation of eIF-2α by PKR-WT could be reversed (α phosphorylation increasing 3-5-fold) by increasing the concentration of dsRNA again, suggesting that the variant functions by sequestering activator (Fig. 4B, lanes 2-4). We next examined the activity of recombinant PKR-M7 in a similar assay. When assayed alone, the PKR-M7 variant possessed minimal activity compared with PKR-WT (Fig. 5A). Although autophosphorylation of the histidine fusion PKR protein is detectable at the highest dsRNA concentrations, this mutant cannot appreciably phosphorylate the eIF-2α substrate (Fig. 5A, lanes 7 and 8). PKR-M7 is, however, an effective inhibitor of wild-type kinase function (Fig. 5B). Moreover, roughly equal amounts of PKR-M7 compared with PKR-WT can significantly reduce both the autophosphorylation and eIF-2α phosphorylating ability of the wild-type kinase. Furthermore, excess dsRNA was not able to reverse this inhibition (data not shown). This is in marked contrast to the previous experiments in which vast excesses of PKR-M1 were required for a similar effect that was reversed by increasing activator concentration. It is relevant to note that PKR-WT and PKR-M7 coincidentally comigrate due to the presence of the histidine tag despite the latter's smaller size. In contrast to the PKR-M1 variant, however, little trans-phosphorylation of PKR-M7 by PKR-WT was observed for unknown reasons. The data presented thus far demonstrated that both PKR-M1 and PKR-M7 can function as transdominant inhibitors of the wild-type kinase in vitro, resulting in reduced α phosphorylation. An important question that needed to be answered is whether these variants functioned in a similar way in vivo, inside a mammalian cell. We therefore analyzed both the growth rates and endogenous eIF-2α phosphorylation levels in PKR-M1 expressing NIH 3T3 cells and compared these cells with those expressing the PKR-M7 regulatory domain variant. A detailed description of the PKR-M1 and PKR-M7 cell lines, including analyses of PKR variant levels, can be found elsewhere(18Meurs E. Galabru J. Barber G.N. Katze M.G. Hovanessian A.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 232-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar, 21Barber G.N. Wambach M. Thompson S. Jagus R. Katze M.G. Mol. Cell.

Virol. 1992; 66: 5805-5814Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although we previously tested the tumorigenicity of these PKR-M1 cell lines(18Meurs E. Galabru J. Barber G.N. Katze M.G. Hovanessian A.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 232-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar), we never compared PKR-M1 and PKR-M7 growth rates nor did we examine α phosphorylation levels in the absence of virus infection or interferon treatment(30Meurs E. Watanabe Y. Barber G.N. Katze M.G. Chong K.L. Williams B.R.G. Hovanessian A.G. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 5805-5814Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our present analysis revealed that the growth rate of the PKR-M1 overexpressing cells did not differ from the control cells expressing the neomycin-resistant gene alone as revealed by the slope of the curve (Fig. 6A). The PKR-M1 cells did, however, grow to somewhat higher densities which quickly leveled off after approximately a week in culture. In contrast, the PKR-M7 cell lines grew both at a faster rate and to higher densities with growth rates not levelling off. We then compared endogenous eIF-2α phosphorylation levels in the three different cell lines at both day 5 and day 7 after plating (Fig. 6B). At both days, phosphorylation levels were more drastically reduced in the PKR-M7 cell line compared with the PKR-M1 cell lines. Indeed phosphorylated eIF-2α was barely detectable only at day 7 in the PKR-M7 cell extracts. Laser densitometry quantitation at day 7 revealed that eIF-2α phosphorylation levels in PKR-M1 cells were approximately 2.5-fold lower than in control cells expressing the neomycin-resistant gene alone, whereas levels in PKR-M7 cells were reduced approximately 50-fold. We have presented evidence that two PKR variants possess distinct biological activities in reticulocyte extract, although both can act in vitro as dominant negative inhibitors of PKR. These data lead us to speculate that the inhibition may be occurring through different mechanisms. First, it is unlikely that either mutant is working by sequestration of the eIF-2 substrate, since neither prevented phosphorylation of eIF-2α by the heme regulated kinase. The catalytically inactive PKR-M1 mutant is likely inhibiting PKR-WT by sequestering the dsRNA activator, since (i) PKR-M1, at large excesses, can reverse the damaging effects of translation in reticulocyte extract caused by dsRNA addition; (ii) large amounts of PKR-M1 are required for transdominant inhibition of PKR-WT in our in vitro kinase assays; and (iii) this inhibition of the wild-type kinase can be reversed by further addition of excess dsRNA. In contrast, the regulatory domain mutant, PKR-M7, can inhibit PKR-WT at approximately equal concentrations, cannot reverse dsRNA effects in reticulocyte lysate, nor can its action in vitro be reversed by addition of more activator. We conclude, therefore, that PKR-M7 is probably inhibiting kinase activity through a direct interaction, forming inactive heterodimers with the wild-type protein kinase, although we concede we have no concrete data at this time to support this model. Others have presented evidence that PKR may need to dimerize to become fully functional(33Langland J.O. Pettiford S. Jiang B. Jacobs B.L. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 3821-3829Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34Romano P.R. Green S.R. Barber G.N. Mathews M.B. Hinnebusch A.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 365-378Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It was important to address the biological relevance of these in vitro observations. As earlier mentioned, overexpression of either PKR-M1 or PKR-M7 in NIH 3T3 cells induced their malignant transformation and allowed these cells to cause tumors in nude mice (18Meurs E. Galabru J. Barber G.N. Katze M.G. Hovanessian A.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 232-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar, 21Barber G.N. Wambach M. Thompson S. Jagus R. Katze M.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3138-3146Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). However, important differences do exist between the PKR-M1 and PKR-M7 cell lines, and this may relate to the variants' differing modes of action in vitro. Somewhat unexpectedly we found that the PKR-M7 cell lines grew faster and to higher densities than the PKR-M1 overexpressing cell lines. More importantly, levels of eIF-2α phosphorylation were more dramatically reduced in the NIH 3T3 cell lines overexpressing the regulatory domain variant, PKR-M7, compared with PKR-M1 expressing cell lines. This raises the possibility that the two variants may be triggering transformation through different pathways. The in vivo and in vitro data describing PKR-M7 activity are consistent and strongly suggest that PKR-M7 functions through the inactivation of PKR activity by mechanisms that do not involve the sequestration of activator. This then results in reduced eIF-2α phosphorylation levels and accelerated growth rates in cell lines expressing the variant. This situation is very similar to cell lines overexpressing the Δ6 PKR mutant (16Koromilas A.E. Roy S. Barber G.N. Katze M.G. Sonneberg N. Science. 1992; 257: 1685-1689Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar) and the PKR cellular inhibitor P58(35Barber G.N. Thompson S. Lee T.-G. Strom T. Jagus R. Darveau A. Katze M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4278-4282Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). In both these cases, decreases in endogenous PKR function lead to dramatic reductions in eIF-2α phosphorylation levels, accelerated growth rates, and subsequent ability of these cells to cause tumors in nude mice. The scenario appears to be different for PKR-M1. Despite the variant's in vitro properties, PKR-M1 does not cause a dramatic reduction of eIF-2 phosphorylation in overexpressing cell lines nor does it appreciably up-regulate growth rates of these cells in culture (Fig. 6). Furthermore, our earlier study showed that the presence of PKR-M1 failed to prevent excessive phosphorylation of eIF-2α in interferon-treated cells infected by encephalomyocarditis virus(30Meurs E. Watanabe Y. Barber G.N. Katze M.G. Chong K.L. Williams B.R.G. Hovanessian A.G. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 5805-5814Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Taken together, these results suggest one of two possibilities regarding the variant's ability to induce malignant transformation: (i) PKR-M1 may still work by down-regulating PKR function by sequestering dsRNA activator. However, since eIF-2α phosphorylation levels are not dramatically diminished in vivo, PKR-M1 also may be inhibiting other, nontranslational activities of PKR, e.g. those functions involved with signal transduction and transcription(10Kumar A. Haque J. Lacoste J. Hiscott J. Williams B.R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6288-6292Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar, 11Maran A. Maitra R.K. Kumar A. Dong B. Xiao W. Li G. Williams B.R.G. Torrence P.F. Silverman R.H. Science. 1994; 265: 789-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Consistent with this hypothesis is the recent report demonstrating that a nearly identical catalytically inactive PKR molecule can alter the activation state of NF-κB(10Kumar A. Haque J. Lacoste J. Hiscott J. Williams B.R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6288-6292Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar). (ii) An alternative explanation is that PKR-M1 transforms cells via mechanisms completely independent of any known PKR regulatory pathway. It may be that PKR-M1 overexpression is disrupting a PKR-independent pathway by binding to and/or sequestering unknown proteins which would then result in malignant transformation. This would then suggest that the variant does not function as a bona fide transdominant inhibitor of PKR in overexpressing cells and would be in agreement with a recent report showing that the domain II mutant cannot function as a dominant negative inhibitor in yeast(34Romano P.R. Green S.R. Barber G.N. Mathews M.B. Hinnebusch A.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 365-378Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However it would be in contradiction to our earlier findings suggesting PKR-M1 can function dominant negatively in vivo using transient transfection assays(36Barber G.N. Wambach M. Wong M.-L. Dever T.E. Hinnebusch A.G. Katze M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4621-4625Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). In any case, it seems unlikely that the in vitro inhibition of PKR and eIF-2α phosphorylation (this report) and effects on protein synthetic rates in reticulocyte extracts caused by PKR-M1 (this report and (37Sharp T.V. Xiao Q. Jeffrey I. Gewert D.R. Clemens M.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 214: 945-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar)) accurately reflect the only biological properties of the PKR-M1 variant.

Regulation of the conversion of proIGF-I to mature IGF-I is a potential mechanism by which the biological activity of this growth factor might be modulated. Endoproteolysis of the IGF-I prohormone occurs at the unique pentabasic motif Lys-X-X-Lys-X-X-Arg71-X-X-Arg-X-X-Arg.

The physiological importance of IGF-I for normal development and growth is underscored by the severity of the phenotype of mice lacking a functional IGF-I gene.

SPC1 and SPC4 are widely distributed and cleave proprotein precursors at tri- and tetrabasic sites(13Halban P.A. Irminger J.-C. Biochem. J. 1994; 299: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). The preferred cleavage site for SPC1 appears to be Arg-X-Lys/Arg-Arg(14Hosaka M. Nagahama M. Kim W.-S. Watanabe T. Hatsuzawa K. Ikemizu J. Murakami K. Nakayama K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12127-12130Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the Arg-X-X-Arg sequence may serve as a minimal processing site(15Molloy S.S. Bresnahan P.A. Leppla S.H. Klimpel K.R. Thomas G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16396-16402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). SPC4 has been reported to have a more strict requirement for a basic residue in the P2 position than does SPC1(16Rehemtulla A. Barr P.J. Rhodes C.J. Kaufman R.J. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 11586-11590Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 17Creemers J.W.M. Kormelink P.J.G. Roebroek A.J.M. Nakayama K. Van de Ven W.J.M. FEBS Lett. 1993; 336: 65-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The paradigm established for processing of proinsulin suggests that proIGF-I would be converted to mature IGF-I by cleavage at the carboxyl terminus of Arg71, followed by removal of the basic residue by a carboxypeptidase. SPC1 is a candidate proIGF-I convertase since, like IGF-I, it is expressed ubiquitously and it does not have a strict requirement for a basic residue in the P2 position. We have used site-directed mutagenesis to determine the importance of each of the basic residues in the proIGF-I cleavage site for recognition by the processing enzyme. We have also examined the role of SPC1 in proIGF-I processing through the use of cell lines deficient in SPC1 activity. PreproIGF-IA was amplified by PCR from cDNA obtained from the human fibroblast cell line GM 03652C (ATCC). Primers specific for the Met−25 region of the signal peptide (hIGF1-5) and the translation termination codon region of the E-domain (hIGF1-6) were used: 5’-GGGAATTCTTGAAGGTGAAGATGCACAC and 5’-GGGGATCCCCTACATCCTGTAGTTCTTGT. The PCR product was cloned into the EcoRI and BamHI sites of the pCMV6c expression vector, which contains the CMV promotor and the SV40 poly(A) tail, to generate pCMVigf1. pCMVigf1 was then used as a template for recombinant PCR (18Higuchi R. Innis M.A. Gelfand D.H. Sninsky J.J. White T.J. PCR Protocols: A Guide to Methods and Applications. Academic Press, New York1990Google Scholar) to generate pCMVigf1-FLAG. The signal peptide of IGF-I was amplified using primers hIGF1-5 and Flg-2 (5’-CTTGTTCATCGTCGTCCTTGTAGTCAGCCGTGGCAGAGCTGGT). Flg-2 codes for Thr−6 to Ala−1 of the signal peptide and contains the 24-nucleotide antisense FLAG sequence on the 5’ end. The coding region of proIGF-I was amplified using primers hIGF1-6 and Flg-1 (5’-GACTACAAGGACGACGATGACAAGGGACCGGAGACGCTCTGC). Flg-1 codes for Gly1 to Cys6 of the B-domain and contains the 24-nucleotide sense FLAG sequence on the 5’ end. The PCR products were purified by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and 50 ng of each was mixed, annealed, and extended under PCR conditions and amplified by 12 cycles of PCR with hIGF1-5 and hIGF1-6. The recombinant PCR product was cloned into the EcoRI and BamHI sites of pCMV6c to generate pCMVigf1-FLAG. The fidelity of PCR amplification was verified by DNA sequencing. Site-directed mutants were generated using the Altered Sites II in vitro Mutagenesis System (Promega) and double-stranded proIGF-I-FLAG plasmid DNA as template. Oligonucleotide primer sequences and corresponding templates are shown in Table 1. Mutants were subcloned from pAlter to pCMV6c and verified by DNA sequencing.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab Human embryonic kidney 293 cells were grown in DMEM (Life Technologies, Inc) with 10% fetal calf serum and 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 εg/ml streptomycin. 293 cells were transfected by the calcium phosphate method(19Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, New York1989Google Scholar). CHO-K1 and RPE.40 cells (provided by Dr. Thomas Moehring, University of Vermont) were grown in Ham's F-12 medium with 5% fetal calf serum and 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 εg/ml streptomycin. CHO-K1 and RPE.40 cells were transfected using LipofectAMINE™ following the manufacturer's protocol (Life Technologies, Inc). 24 h after transfection cells were washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline and incubated for 2 h in cysteine-free (or histidine-free) Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 εg/ml streptomycin. The medium was then replaced with cysteine-free (or histidine-free) Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 100 εCi/ml [35S]cysteine (Amersham, 1000 Ci/mmol) or [14C]histidine (DuPont NEN, 385 Ci/mmol), 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 εg/ml streptomycin. After labeling for 24 h, conditioned medium was collected and centrifuged to remove cellular debris. Conditioned medium was stored at −20°C. Cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and removed from the plate in immunoprecipitation (IP) buffer (25 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 300 mM NaCl, 1 mM CaCl2, 10 εg/ml leupeptin, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1% Triton X-100), sonicated, and stored at −20°C. Conditioned medium (1 to 5 ml) was acidified with trifluoroacetic acid (0.1% final concentration) and loaded onto a Sep-Pak C-18 cartridge (Millipore) that had previously been equilibrated with 20% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. After washing the column in 20% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, peptides were eluted in 80% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, lyophilized, and reconstituted in 500 εl of IP buffer. Immunoprecipitation was performed with 3 εg of M1 or M2 anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody (Kodak/IBI) or 5 εl of UB3-189 anti-human somatomedin-C polyclonal antisera (National Hormone Pituitary Program, NIDDK) overnight at 4°C. M1 and M2 immune complexes were precipitated with protein G-Sepharose (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.), and UB3-189 immune complexes were precipitated with protein A-Sepharose. The immunoprecipitates were washed twice in buffer containing 25 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 300 mM NaCl, 1 mM CaCl2, and then once in buffer consisting of 25 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 140 mM NaCl, 1 mM CaCl2. Cell lysates were thawed and centrifuged to remove cell debris. 500 εl of supernatant was preabsorbed with protein G-Sepharose and immunoprecipitated with M1 antibody as described above. Immunoprecipitates were solubilized in SDS-sample buffer containing 2-mercaptoethanol and denatured by heating at 95°C for 5 min. Samples were electrophoresed on Tricine-buffered gels with a 4% stack and a resolving gel of 10%, 16.5%, or 20% polyacrylamide(20Schagger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10501) Google Scholar). Gels were fixed in 10% acetic acid, 25% isopropyl alcohol for 30 min, and then soaked in a fluorographic solution (Amplify, Amersham) for 15 min. Dried gels were exposed to x-ray film (Kodak) with an intensifying screen. 7 ml of conditioned medium from [35S]cysteine-labeled cells was concentrated on a Sep-Pak and lyophilized as described above. The lyophilized proteins were solubilized in 0.1% SDS, denatured by heating at 95°C for 10 min, and placed on ice. 77 εl of 10× deglycosylation buffer (200 mM NaH2PO4, pH 7.2, 5% Nonidet P-40) was added, and 100-εl aliquots were incubated with 2 milliunits of neuraminidase (sialidase), 2.5 milliunits of O-glycosidase, 0.4 unit of N-glycosidase F (Boehringer Mannheim), or combinations of these enzymes for 24 h at 37°C. After incubation, 400 εl of IP buffer was added, and epitope-tagged peptides were immunoprecipitated with M1 antibody and run on 10% polyacrylamide gels as described above. Our initial attempts to study the processing of proIGF-I were hampered by difficulties in immunoprecipitating proIGF-I from conditioned medium. Commercially available antisera to IGF-I have been generated using mature IGF-I as antigen, and the E-domain of proIGF-I may interfere with epitope recognition. To circumvent this problem we designed a preproIGF-I expression vector that contained an epitope tag, the 8-amino-acid FLAG peptide, between Ala−1 of the signal peptide and Gly+1 of the B-domain (Fig. 2). Two monoclonal antibodies to the FLAG peptide have been generated. The M1 antibody requires calcium for binding and will only recognize a FLAG peptide with an exposed amino terminus. The M1 antibody can therefore be used to determine whether the signal peptide has been removed from proIGF-I-FLAG. The M2 antibody will recognize the FLAG peptide in any location and should therefore immunoprecipitate all epitope-tagged peptides. To obtain an accurate molecular weight marker for IGF-I-FLAG, we mutated Arg71 of proIGF-I-FLAG to a stop codon. This R71X mutant directs synthesis of the 70-amino-acid mature IGF-I molecule with the FLAG peptide at the amino terminus (Fig. 2 and Table 1). Before proceeding with biosynthetic studies, it was necessary to determine if the presence of the FLAG peptide would alter processing of the IGF-I prohormone. 293 cells were transfected with IGF-I, R71X, and IGF-I-FLAG expression vectors, and [35S]cysteine-labeled proteins were immunoprecipitated from conditioned medium using UB3-189 anti-human IGF-I antisera (Fig. 3). Two proteins of 7-8 kDa were immunoprecipitated from conditioned media of cells transfected with CMVigf1. Two proteins were also immunoprecipitated from conditioned media of cells transfected with CMVigf1-FLAG. These peptides have a molecular mass of 9-10 kDa and represent the epitope-tagged homologues of the IGF-I peptides synthesized from the CMVigf1 vector. The 9-kDa band generated from the IGF-I-FLAG transfection migrates at the same position as the R71X mutant, which has a predicted molecular mass of 8640 daltons, indicating that proIGF-I-FLAG is processed at Arg71. The larger molecular mass bands of the IGF-I and IGF-I-FLAG doublets may represent carboxyl-extended forms of mature IGF-I. When conditioned medium from R71X-transfected 293 cells was immunoprecipitated with M1, M2, and UB3-189 antisera, a predominant band was seen at 9 kDa (Fig. 4). The slightly larger band recognized by the M1 antibody may be an oxidized form of IGF-I. When conditioned medium from IGF-I-FLAG-transfected 293 cells was immunoprecipitated with these antisera, several peptides were visualized. The 9-kDa band generated from the R71X transfections was also present in IGF-I-FLAG-transfected media and was recognized by anti-FLAG and anti-human IGF-I antisera, indicating that this band represents mature IGF-I-FLAG. The 10-kDa band from the IGF-I-FLAG-transfected media was also recognized by all three antisera and may represent a carboxyl-extended form of mature IGF-I-FLAG. In addition to the 9-10-kDa doublet, the M1 and M2 antibodies immunoprecipitated peptides of 14 kDa and 16 kDa, as well as a broad band from 19-21 kDa. Since these peptides were recognized by both M1 and M2, they do not represent forms of IGF-I containing a signal peptide and thus the FLAG peptide does not interfere with signal peptidase activity. The higher molecular weight bands, which were not immunoprecipitated with the UB3-189 antisera, may be forms of proIGF-I. Selective amino acid labeling was employed in order to determine whether the high molecular weight proteins immunoprecipitated from IGF-I-FLAG-transfected conditioned media by anti-FLAG antibodies were unprocessed or partially processed proIGF-I molecules. Human proIGF-IA contains two histidine residues, both of which are located in the E-domain. Therefore, histidine labeling should be specific for proIGF-I as opposed to oligomers or aberrantly processed mature IGF-I. Fig. 5 shows the results of [35S]cysteine and [14C]histidine labeling of cells transfected with the IGF-I-FLAG expression vector. The 9-10-kDa doublet migrated as a single band on this 10% polyacrylamide gel and was clearly visible when cells were labeled with [35S]cysteine but was not present when labeled with [14C]histidine. In contrast, 14-kDa and 19-21-kDa proteins were visible from both [35S]cysteine and [14C]histidine labeling, and the [14C]histidine-labeled 16-kDa band could be seen after overexposure (data not shown). The predicted molecular mass of proIGF-I-FLAG is 12.7 kDa, in close agreement with the 14-kDa band seen in [14C]histidine labeling. The proIGF-IA E-domain contains one potential N-glycosylation site at Asn92 and several serine and threonine residues which could be used for O-glycosylation. To determine if the 16-kDa and 19-21-kDa peptides were glycosylated forms of proIGF-I, peptides from conditioned medium of proIGF-I-FLAG-transfected 293 cells were subjected to treatment with various glycosidases. As shown in Fig. 6, neuraminidase and O-glycosidase had no effect on the electrophoretic mobility of proIGF-I peptides. However, the 19-21-kDa band completely disappeared after digestion with N-glycosidase while the intensity of the 14-kDa and 16-kDa peptides increased dramatically. It is therefore likely that the 19-21-kDa peptide is N-glycosylated proIGF-I-FLAG, the 14-kDa peptide is proIGF-I-FLAG, and the 16-kDa peptide may be partially glycosylated proIGF-I-FLAG. Since there are examples of growth factors that can be proteolytically activated intra- or extracellularly, it was of interest to determine the location of conversion of proIGF-I to mature IGF-I. Cell lysates from R71X or IGF-I-FLAG-transfected 293 cells were immunoprecipitated with the M1 antibody, and peptides were resolved on 16.5% polyacrylamide gels. The 9-10-kDa processed IGF-I-FLAG doublet, as well as proIGF-I-FLAG and glycosylated proIGF-I-FLAG, were clearly visible in cell lysates, indicating that conversion can occur intracellularly (Fig. 7). We have also demonstrated that proIGF-I-FLAG peptides are not processed to mature IGF-I-FLAG when incubated with conditioned media from 293 cells or 50% fetal calf, rat, or mouse serum for up to 24 h at 37°C. However, degradation of proIGF-I-FLAG occurs when incubated with trypsin (data not shown). To determine the importance of each of the basic residues in the pentabasic proIGF-I processing motif for prohormone conversion activity, we systematically mutated each basic residue to an uncharged residue (Table 1). Single, double, and triple mutants were generated. Since our initial experiments with the R71X and IGF-I-FLAG expression vectors indicated that proIGF-I was being cleaved at Arg71 and a downstream site, we also made two additional stop codon mutants for use as molecular weight markers. Arg74 and Arg77 were mutated to stop codons, generating R74X and R77X, respectively. In several cases, substitution of a basic residue with an uncharged amino acid changed the electrophoretic mobility of the protein. In some of these instances it was necessary to make additional stop codon mutants in order to correctly identify the processing site. Fig. 8A shows the results of expression of the single substitution mutants in 293 cells. On Tricine-buffered 20% polyacrylamide gels, the R71X mutant migrates as a single band. The R74X mutant migrates as a poorly resolved doublet, and the R77X mutant migrates as a clearly defined doublet. This gel electrophoresis system is therefore capable of resolving IGF-I-FLAG peptides of 78, 81, and 84 amino acids in length. It is also interesting to note that both the R74X and R77X peptides are processed at Arg71, indicating that as few as two residues on the carboxyl terminus of Arg71 are sufficient for processing activity. As shown previously (Figure 3:, Figure 4:), wild-type IGF-I-FLAG is processed at two sites yielding a peptide that migrates with the R71X standard at 9 kDa as well as a 10-kDa peptide. Comparison of these peptides with the pattern produced by expression of R74X and R77X indicates that the 10-kDa IGF-I-FLAG peptide is generated by cleavage at Arg77 (Fig. 8A). In several different transfection experiments, we have observed that approximately 50% of proIGF-I-FLAG is cleaved at Arg71 and 50% at Arg77. We have not observed evidence for cleavage at Arg74 (Table 2).Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab Mutation of Arg71 to alanine (R71A) abolishes processing at this site, indicating that the basic residue is required at the P1 site. Processing at Arg77 is not qualitatively affected (Fig. 8A). Mutations at either Arg74 (R74A) or Arg77 (R77A) eliminate processing at Arg77 without qualitatively affecting cleavage at Arg71 (Fig. 8A). The K68G mutant processing pattern is qualitatively similar to that of wild-type proIGF-I processing except that all bands migrate slightly faster on Tricine-buffered gels (Fig. 8A). This band shift may be attributed to size and/or charge differences of the lysine and glycine side chains. When K68G and K68G/R71X peptides are run together on Tricine-buffered 20% gels, it is clear that processing does not occur at Arg71. The K68G peptide migrates more slowly than the K68G/R71X stop codon mutant (data not shown) and is thus processed at a downstream site such as Arg77. The P4 lysine residue is therefore required for processing at Arg71. When Lys65 is mutated to Ala (K65A), the peptide is processed at two sites (Fig. 8B). The smaller band migrates with the K65A/R71X mutant, indicating that it is generated by cleavage at Arg71. Since the larger band of the doublet is well resolved, it is likely that it represents processing at Arg77. Three K65A double mutants were generated. The K65A/R74A and K65A/R77A mutants migrate as a single band with the same molecular weight as the K65A/R71X mutant (Fig. 8B). These mutants are therefore cleaved at Arg71 but not Arg77. The processed K65A/K68G mutant has a higher molecular weight than the corresponding K65A/K68G/R71X mutant, indicating that the two upstream lysine residues are required for cleavage at Arg71 (Fig. 8C). It is likely that cleavage of K65A/K68G occurs at Arg77 since the K65A/K68G and K65A/K68G/R71X bands are clearly resolved. While it was not possible to definitively assign cleavage locations for the K68G double mutants, it is clear that these mutants are processed very poorly, if at all, at Arg71. Only 10% of the K68G/R74A mutants and 16% of the K68G/R77A mutants were processed (Fig. 8D and Table 2). 79% of the K68G/R71A mutant was processed, and it is likely that cleavage occurred at Arg77 since this site is preferred to Arg74 in proIGF-I-FLAG. When Arg74 is isolated by substitution of alanine for Arg71 and Arg77 (R71A/R77A), only 8% of the precursor is cleaved. When Arg74 and Arg77 are changed to alanine residues (R74A/R77A), approximately 50% of the precursor is cleaved at Arg71 (Fig. 8D and Table 2). The data on processing of proIGF-I mutants indicated that processing at Arg77 was prevented in all mutants having a substitution at either Arg74 or Arg77 (Fig. 8 and Table 2), suggesting that this sequence might be a cleavage site for SPC1, which has minimally been defined as RXXR(15Molloy S.S. Bresnahan P.A. Leppla S.H. Klimpel K.R. Thomas G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16396-16402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These data also demonstrate that processing at Arg71 requires both Lys68 (P4) and Arg71 (P1). It is not yet clear if SPC1 will process precursors containing a Lys for Arg substitution in the P4 position. In order to determine if SPC1 is involved in proIGF-I processing, we expressed IGF-I-FLAG in CHO-K1 and RPE.40 cells. RPE.40 cells were derived from CHO.K1 cells exposed to Pseudomonas exotoxin A (PEA) and selected for resistance (21Moehring J.M. Moehring T.J. Infect. Immun. 1983; 41: 998-1009Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). RPE.40 cells fail to process precursor membrane glycoproteins of several viruses, as well as the insulin proreceptor. This processing deficiency can be corrected by transfection with SPC1 cDNA(22Moehring J.M. Inocencio N.M. Robertson B.J. Moehring T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2590-2594Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Robertson B.J. Moehring J.M. Moehring T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24274-24277Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When CHO-K1 cells were transfected with the R71X and R77X stop codon mutants, peptides corresponding to cleavage products at Arg71 and Arg77 were immunoprecipitated from conditioned media (Fig. 9). Transfection with IGF-I-FLAG produced the Arg71 and Arg77 doublet, as well as proIGF-I and glycosylated proIGF-I. Expression of R71X and R77X in RPE.40 cells resulted in the same pattern of immunoprecipitable peptides as was seen in transfected CHO-K1 cells. However, when IGF-I-FLAG was expressed in RPE.40 cells, a single band of mature IGF-I, corresponding to IGF-I-FLAG processed at Arg71, was observed. This indicates that RPE.40 cells process proIGF-I at Arg71 but not Arg77. We have also observed a single band corresponding to Arg71 cleavage when IGF-I-FLAG was transfected into LoVo cells (data not shown). LoVo cells do not process the MET protooncogene or the insulin proreceptor(24Mondino A. Giordano S. Comoglio P.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 6084-6092Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), and this processing deficiency has been attributed to a defective SPC1 gene (25Takahashi S. Kasai K. Hatsuzawa K. Kitamura N. Misumi Y. Ikehara Y. Murakami K. Nakayama K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 195: 1019-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). We have used the pCMVigf1-FLAG expression vector and human embryonic kidney 293 cells to study proteolytic processing of human proIGF-I. Using the UB3-189 anti-human IGF-I antisera, we have shown that the pCMVigf1 and pCMVigf1-FLAG expression vectors direct synthesis and secretion of processed IGF-I and IGF-I-FLAG, respectively (Fig. 3). Using the M1 and M2 monoclonal antibodies, we have demonstrated that the FLAG epitope does not interfere with removal of the signal peptide (Fig. 4). PreproIGF-I-FLAG is therefore faithfully processed to mature IGF-I-FLAG and can be used to study post-translation processing of proIGF-I. When expressed in 293 cells, pCMVigf1-FLAG directs synthesis of multiple forms of high molecular weight proIGF-I-FLAG peptides which are converted to proIGF-I-FLAG by incubation with N-glycosidase (Figure 5:, Figure 6:). Although glycosylated forms of human proIGF-I have not been described previously, Simmons et al.(26Simmons J.G. Van Wyk J.J. Hoyt E.C. Lund P.K. Growth Factors. 1993; 9: 205-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) have shown that rat proIGF-I can be N-glycosylated in an in vitro translation system. Interestingly, peptides generated from initiation of translation at Met-22 or Met-32, but not Met-48, were substrates for N-glycosylation. The pCMVigf1-FLAG expression vector contains translation initiation codons at Met-22 and Met−25, but Met-48 has been eliminated. N-Glycosylated proIGF-I has not been identified in vivo, and the significance of this post-translational modification is unknown. However, it has been demonstrated that glycosylation can affect proteolytic processing of some precursor proteins. For instance, N-glycosylation of the human influenza virus hemagglutinin precursor at Asn22 can inhibit processing at Arg329(27Ohuchi R. Ohuchi M. Garten W. Klenk H.-D. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 3530-3537Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Proprotein precursors can be converted to mature forms intracellularly, at the cell surface membrane, or extracellularly. Pulse-chase experiments have shown that the E-domain of proIGF-II is cleaved at several sites during transport through the cell. Most of these cleavages, including the final cleavage to produce the 7-kDa mature IGF-II, appear to occur very late in the secretory pathway and may also occur extracellularly(28Yang Y.W.-H. Romanus J.A. Liu T.-Y. Nissley S.P. Rechler M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 2570-2577Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We detect mature IGF-I-FLAG in 293 cell lysates, indicating that conversion can occur intracellularly (Fig. 7). We have not seen evidence for processing of proIGF-I-FLAG to mature IGF-I-FLAG when proIGF-I-FLAG peptides were incubated with conditioned media from 293 cells or serum from mouse, rat, or fetal calves (data not shown). Expression of wild-type and mutant proIGF-I-FLAG constructs in 293 cells indicates that the IGF-I prohormone can be cleaved at two sites, Arg71 and Arg77. The Arg77 cleavage site conforms to the minimal SPC1 cleavage site defined by Molloy et al.(15Molloy S.S. Bresnahan P.A. Leppla S.H. Klimpel K.R. Thomas G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16396-16402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with Arg74 as the P4 residue and Arg77 as the P1 residue. All mutants containing alanine in place of Arg74 or Arg77 eliminate processing at Arg77 (R74A, R77A, K65A/R74A, K65A/R77A, K68G/R77A, R71A/R77A, R74A/R77A). In all mutants containing substitutions of nonbasic residues for Lys65, Lys68, or Arg71, the percentage of precursor processing at Arg77 is increased (K65A, K68G, R71A, K65A/K68G, K68G/R71A) (Table 2). One explanation for the increased processing at Arg77 in these mutants is that the secondary structure of the peptide may have been modified in a way that allows for more favorable enzyme-substrate interactions. However, each of the Lys65, Lys68, and Arg71 mutants also decreases or eliminates processing at Arg71. It is therefore likely that the increased processing at Arg77 is a result of the creation of a less efficient Arg71 cleavage site. In addition to mutational analysis, data obtained from the expression of wild-type proIGF-I-FLAG in SPC1-deficient cell lines also implicate SPC1 as the Arg77 cleavage enzyme. When wild-type proIGF-I-FLAG is expressed in CHO-K1 cells, cleavage occurs at Arg71 and Arg77. However, when expressed in RPE.40 cells, a CHO-K1 derivative lacking SPC1 activity, cleavage of proIGF-I-FLAG occurs at Arg71 but not Arg77 (Fig. 9). Processing at Arg71, but not Arg77, was also observed when proIGF-I-FLAG was expressed in the SPC1-deficient LoVo cell line (data not shown). It therefore appears that SPC1 is required for cleavage of proIGF-I-FLAG at Arg77 but not Arg71. Since IGF-I isolated from human serum is 70 amino acids long, it is likely that final maturation occurs by cleavage of the precursor at Arg71. The presence of a second cleavage site at Arg77, which affects processing efficiency at Arg71, makes it difficult to determine the minimal processing motif necessary for final maturation. Mutational analysis has revealed that Lys68 and Arg71 are both essential for processing at Arg71. Substitution of glycine for Lys68 (K68G) or alanine for Arg71 (R71A) eliminates processing at Arg71 (Fig. 8A, Table 2). The P7 lysine residue may also be important for efficient processing since 28% of the K65A mutant is cleaved at Arg71, as opposed to 55% for wild-type proIGF-I. It thus seems paradoxical that the K65A/R74A and K65A/R77A double mutants are processed more efficiently at Arg71 than the K65A single mutant (68% and 92%, respectively) (Table 2). A likely explanation, however, is that the double mutants eliminate the P4 and P1 residues, respectively, of the SPC1 cleavage site, therefore making more substrate available for the Arg71 cleaving enzyme. Arg71 alone is not sufficient for processing since the K68G/R74A mutant is cleaved very poorly (Fig. 8D, Table 2). The optimal SPC1 cleavage site has been defined as RXK/RR (29Hatsuzawa K. Nagahama M. Takahashi S. Takada K. Murakami K. Nakayama K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16094-16099Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). SPC1 will also cleave some precursors with an RXXR motif with reduced efficiency (15Molloy S.S. Bresnahan P.A. Leppla S.H. Klimpel K.R. Thomas G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16396-16402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Rehemtulla A. Barr P.J. Rhodes C.J. Kaufman R.J.

Chem. 1992; 267: 16094-16099Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) while other precursors with this motif are not cleaved(30Gotoh B. Ohnishi Y. Inocencio N.M. Esaki E. Nakayama K. Barr P.J. Thomas G. Nagai Y. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 6391-6397Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is unclear whether SPC1 will cleave substrates containing a lysine residue in the P4 position. The fusion glycoprotein precursor (F0) of the Ulster strain of Newcastle disease virus contains the KQGR cleavage motif. The F0 glycoprotein of Newcastle disease virus strain Ulster was not cleaved when coexpressed or incubated in vitro with SPC1(30Gotoh B. Ohnishi Y. Inocencio N.M. Esaki E. Nakayama K. Barr P.J. Thomas G. Nagai Y. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 6391-6397Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A virulent avian influenza virus hemagglutinin containing the RKKR cleavage motif was processed efficiently by SPC1 in both coexpression and in vitro incubation experiments. When the P4 arginine of this motif was mutated to lysine to create KKKR, 75% of the hemagglutinin was cleaved when coexpressed with SPC1, and the hemagglutinin was not cleaved when incubated with SPC1 in vitro(31Walker J.A. Molloy S.S. Thomas G. Sakaguchi T. Yoshida T. Chambers T.M. Kawaoka Y. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 1213-1218Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our data on expression of proIGF-I-FLAG in RPE.40 and LoVo cells indicate that SPC1 is not necessary for final maturation of IGF-I. The identity of the proIGF-I converting enzyme is unknown. SPC4 is a candidate because it is expressed in many tissue types. However, this enzyme apparently has a more strict requirement for a basic residue in the P2 position than does SPC1(16Rehemtulla A. Barr P.J. Rhodes C.J. Kaufman R.J. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 11586-11590Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 17Creemers J.W.M. Kormelink P.J.G. Roebroek A.J.M. Nakayama K. Van de Ven W.J.M. FEBS Lett. 1993; 336: 65-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). For many proprotein precursors that are processed at basic residues, the scissile bond is on the carboxyl terminus of the P1 residue. After cleavage of the scissile bond by a specific endoprotease, the basic residues are removed by carboxypeptidases. Recently, a metalloendopeptidase which cleaves peptide bonds on the amino terminus of arginine residues was cloned from a rat testis cDNA library(32Pierotti A.R. Prat A. Chesneau V. Gaudoux F. Leseney A.-M. Foulon T. Cohen P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6078-6082Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Although the proIGF-I cleavage site is similar to the motif recognized by enzymes of the SPC family, it is possible that a different class of enzyme may convert proIGF-I to mature IGF-I. It is interesting that the R74X and R77X stop codon mutants are cleaved at Arg71. This indicates that as few as two amino acids on the carboxyl terminus of the P1 residue are sufficient for precursor processing by the enzyme. Processing of these mutants, as well as mutants containing alanine substitutions at Arg74 or Arg77, also demonstrates that cleavage at Arg77 need not precede cleavage at Arg71. Pulse-chase experiments have shown that proIGF-II is cleaved at multiple sites in the E-domain(28Yang Y.W.-H. Romanus J.A. Liu T.-Y. Nissley S.P. Rechler M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 2570-2577Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similar experiments will be necessary to determine if proIGF-I is cleaved at Arg77 before final maturation. At this time there is no evidence for the existence of IGF-I-(1-77) in vivo and the SPC1-mediated cleavage observed at Arg77 in our experiments may be a consequence of overexpression. Nonetheless, this observation is interesting in terms of SPC site selection specificity, and proIGF-I may be a useful model for studying this aspect of prohormone processing. Three repetitive motifs of basic-X-X-basic residues are contained within only 10 amino acids. SPC1 recognizes the motif R74XXR77. The motif K68XXR71 may also be recognized by SPC1, but it is likely to be cleaved by another converting enzyme as well. The R71XXR74 motif does not appear to be recognized by SPC1 or the proIGF-I converting enzyme. In fact, this site appears to be highly refractory to cleavage. Attempts to force cleavage at Arg74 by isolating the R71XXR74 (K68G/R77A) or the single Arg74 (R71A/R77A) were unsuccessful (Fig. 8D, Table 2). Knowledge of the role of nonbasic residues in proIGF-I processing, or the secondary structure of the pentabasic motif, could provide useful insights into processing specificity of prohormone convertases.

https://openalex.org/W2032395724,"Leishmania parasites are exposed to pronounced changes in their environment during their life cycle as they migrate from the sandfly midgut to the insect proboscis and then into the phagolysosomes of the vertebrate macrophages. The developmental transformations that produce each life cycle stage of the parasite may be signaled in part by binding of environmental ligands to receptors which mediate transduction of extracellular signals. We have identified a family of five clustered genes in Leishmania donovani which may encode signal transduction receptors. The coding regions of two of these genes, designated rac-A and rac-B, have been sequenced and shown to code for proteins with an NH2-terminal hydrophilic domain, an intervening putative transmembrane segment, and a COOH-terminal domain that has high sequence identity to the catalytic domain from adenylate cyclases in other eukaryotes. We have expressed the receptor-adenylate cyclase protein (RAC)-A protein in Xenopus oocytes and demonstrated that it functions as an adenylate cyclase. Although RAC-B exhibits no catalytic activity when expressed in oocytes, co-expression of RAC-A and RAC-B negatively regulates the adenylate cyclase activity of RAC-A, suggesting that these two proteins interact in the membrane. Furthermore, a truncated version of RAC-A functions as a dominant negative mutant that inhibits the catalytic activity of the wild type receptor. The rac-A and rac-B genes encode developmentally regulated mRNAs which are expressed in the insect stage but not in the mammalian host stage of the parasite life cycle.

The rac-A and rac-B genes encode developmentally regulated mRNAs which are expressed in the insect stage but not in the mammalian host stage of the parasite life cycle. Parasitic protozoa of the genus Leishmania experience markedly different environments as they transit through their life cycle. Promastigotes live in the midgut of the sandfly vector, infectious metacyclic parasites reside in the mouthparts of the insect, and amastigotes live within the acidic phagolysosomal vesicles of the vertebrate host macrophages(1Chang K.-P. Tyler D.J. Modern Parasite Biology. W. H. Freeman and Co., New York1990: 79-90Google Scholar). As the parasite migrates from the midgut to the mouthparts of the sandfly and subsequently into the phagolysosomes of the macrophage, it must be able to sense its changing extracellular milieu and respond by initiating a developmental transformation that culminates with the establishment of each successive life cycle stage. Although the factors that induce these developmental transformations are not fully understood, it seems likely that some environmental signals will act via binding of ligands to specific receptors in the parasite membrane which transduce the extracellular signal to the interior of the cell. However, to date no such ligands or their receptors have been identified in Leishmania parasites.Nonetheless, a body of evidence suggests that the second messenger cAMP is probably involved in signal transduction events and in life cycle transformations in Leishmania and in other related kinetoplastid protozoa. Thus, various life cycle stages contain significantly different intracellular concentrations of cAMP in the related parasites Trypanosoma brucei(2Mancini P.E. Patton C.L. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1981; 3: 19-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) and in Trypanosoma cruzi(3Rangel-Aldao R. Allende O. Triana F. Piras R. Henriquez D. Piras M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1987; 22: 39-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Furthermore, cAMP analogs and inhibitors of cAMP phosphodiesterase promote the in vitro differentiation of non-infectious insect stage epimastigotes of T. cruzi into infectious metacyclic trypomastigotes(4Gonzales-Perdomo M. Romero P. Goldenberg S. Exp. Parasitol. 1988; 66: 205-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), whereas such reagents inhibit the transformation of amastigotes of Leishmania donovani into promastigotes (5Walter R.D. Slutzky G.M. The Biochemistry of Parasites. Pergamon Press, New York1981: 152-167Google Scholar, 6Walter R.D. Opperdoes F.R. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1982; 6: 287-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) or of long slender bloodstream forms of T. brucei into short stumpy forms that are infectious to the insect(7Reed S.L. Fierer A.S. Goddard D.R. Colmerauer M.E.M. Davis C.E. Infect. Immun. 1985; 49: 844-847Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Perhaps the strongest case for the involvement of cAMP in the differentiation of kinetoplastid parasites is the observation that peptides which are digestion products of vertebrate α-globin, and which are found in the gut of the triatomid insect vector following a blood meal, will activate a membrane-bound adenylate cyclase in non-infectious epimastigotes of T. cruzi and promote the differentiation of these epimastigotes into infectious metacyclic trypomastigotes in vitro(8Fraidenraich D. Pena C. Isola E.L. Lammel E.M. Coso O. Anel A.D. Pongor S. Baralle F. Torres H.N. Flawia M.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10140-10144Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). These results underscore the importance for parasite development of environmental ligands which probably bind to receptors and activate adenylate cyclase.Although the cognate ligands and receptors involved in such signaling processes have not been identified for any of these kinetoplastid protozoa, a family of genes encoding adenylate cyclases have been cloned in T. brucei(9Alexandre S. Paindavoine P. Tebabi P. Pays A. Halleux S. Steinert M. Pays E. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1990; 43: 279-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) and in the related parasite T. equiperdum(10Ross D.T. Raibaud A. Florent I.C. Sather S. Gross M.K. Storn D.R. Eisen H. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2047-2053Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The proteins encoded by these genes possess a large extracellular hydrophilic NH2-terminal domain which is separated by a putative transmembrane segment from a COOH-terminal domain that bears high sequence homology to the catalytic domains of adenylate cyclases from other eukaryotes. These trypanosome genes have been expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae where they complement a temperature-sensitive defect in the yeast adenylate cyclase(10Ross D.T. Raibaud A. Florent I.C. Sather S. Gross M.K. Storn D.R. Eisen H. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2047-2053Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 11Paindavoine P. Rolin S. Van Assel S. Geuskens M. Jauniaux J. Dinsart C. Huet G. Pays E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1218-1225Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The structural organization of these trypanosome proteins suggests that they may be receptors whose NH2-terminal domains bind specific extracellular ligands that activate the intracellular adenylate cyclase domain. This suggestion is reinforced by the structural similarity between these trypanosome proteins and several well-characterized receptors from higher eukaryotes(12Garbers D.L. Koesling D. Schultz G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Thus, mammalian atrial natriuretic peptide receptors bind their ligands via their NH2-terminal extracellular domains and activate the cytoplasmic guanylate cyclase domain(13Chinkers M. Garbers D.L. Chang M.-S. Lowe D.G. Chin H. Goeddel D.V. Schulz S. Nature. 1989; 338: 78-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (882) Google Scholar, 14Chang M.-S. Lowe D.G. Lewis M. Hellmiss R. Chen E. Goeddel D.V. Nature. 1989; 341: 68-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). However, ligands for these putative trypanosome receptors have not yet been identified, and their specific role in signal transduction is currently unknown.The probable role of cAMP in life cycle transformations in kinetoplastid protozoa has led us to investigate adenylate cyclases in L.donovani. In this paper, we demonstrate that L. donovani parasites contain a family of genes that encode putative receptor-adenylate cyclases (RACs)1 1The abbreviations used are: RACreceptor-adenylate cyclase proteinracreceptor-adenylate cyclase gene or mRNAPCRpolymerase chain reactionbpbase pairsCFTRcystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulatorkbkilobase(s). 1The abbreviations used are: RACreceptor-adenylate cyclase proteinracreceptor-adenylate cyclase gene or mRNAPCRpolymerase chain reactionbpbase pairsCFTRcystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulatorkbkilobase(s). that are structurally very similar to the predicted proteins described in T. brucei and T. equiperdum. Five of these genes are arranged in a cluster in the L. donovani genome and are expressed as mRNAs of different sizes. One of these genes have been expressed in Xenopus oocytes and shown to encode a protein that functions as an adenylate cyclase. These results open the way to investigating the role of the Leishmania RAC proteins in signal transduction and their possible involvement in the life cycle transformations of this parasite. Studies on the RAC proteins of the intracellular Leishmania parasites may provide interesting parallels and distinctions compared to the RAC proteins identified in the extracellular parasites T. brucei and T. equiperdum.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESGrowth of Parasites and Isolation of Nucleic AcidsPromastigotes of either the DI700 (15Iovannisci D.M. Ullman B. J. Parasitol. 1983; 69: 633-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) or the LV9 strain of L. donovani were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's-L medium (15Iovannisci D.M. Ullman B. J. Parasitol. 1983; 69: 633-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) containing 5% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.) and 5% bovine embryonic fluid (Sigma) at 27°C. For preparation of LV9 amastigotes, J774-G8 macrophage-like cells were cultured in plastic tissue culture flasks containing RPMI medium supplemented with 20 mM HEPES (Sigma), pH 7.3, and 20% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum at 37°C in the presence of 5% CO2 and were infected with promastigotes at a multiplicity of ∼10 parasites/cell. After 24 h the medium and remaining promastigotes were aspirated, the adherent cells were washed twice with sterile phosphate-buffered saline, fresh medium was added to the culture, and the infection was continued for a further 24 h. Cells were removed from the tissue culture flask by scraping with a rubber policeman and were lysed by passage through a 30-gauge needle 20 times to achieve ∼95% breakage of cells, as monitored by staining with Trypan Blue. The liberated amastigotes were purified on a Percoll gradient as described(16Chang K.-P. Science. 1980; 209: 1240-1242Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), and RNA was prepared immediately. Total parasite RNA was prepared by the guanidinium isothiocyanate-phenol method(17Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (62993) Google Scholar).Polymerase Chain ReactionDegenerate oligonucleotides were purchased from Oligos Etc. and utilized in the PCR to amplify regions of the adenylate cyclase conserved catalytic domain from genomic DNA of L. donovani. The conserved peptide sequences and the oligonucleotides (bases in parentheses represent degenerate positions) designed from them were: peptide 1, TLIFTDI; oligonucleotide 1, AC(T/G/C)CT(T/C/G)AT(T/C)TT(T/C)AC(T/G/C)GA(T/C)AT; peptide 2, EVKTVGD; oligonucleotide 2, GA(G/A)GT(T/G/C)AAGAC(T/G/C)GT(T/G/C)GG(T/G/C)GA; peptide 3, GDSFMIA; oligonucleotide 3 (reverse complement), GC(A/G)ATCAT(A/G)AA(G/A/C)(G/C)(T/A)(A/G)TC(G/C/A)CC; peptide 4, RVGIHTG; oligonucleotide 4 (reverse complement): CC(G/A/C)GT(A/G)TG(A/G)AT(G/A/C)CC(G/A/C)AC(G/A/C)C(G/T). The degeneracies in these oligonucleotides were selected on the basis of the codon biases of previously sequenced Leishmania genes (18Langford C.K. Ullman B. Landfear S.M. Exp. Parasitol. 1992; 74: 360-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The PCRs were performed in a total volume of 50 εl and contained 10 mM Tris, pH 8.3, 50 mM KCl, 3 mM MgCl2, 200 εM each dNTP, 2 εM each oligonucleotide, 2 εg of genomic DNA from the DI700 strain of L. donovani, and 1 unit of Taq Polymerase (Promega). Each PCR was performed on a Perkin Elmer DNA Thermal Cycler utilizing 30 cycles with a 95°C melting temperature for 1 min, a 30°C annealing temperature for 90 s, a 72°C extension temperature for 1 min, with a final incubation at 72°C for 5 min.Isolation of Adenylate Cyclase Cosmid ClonesA library generated from a Sau 3A partial digest of genomic DNA from L. donovani strain DI700 and cloned into the cosmid vector SuperCos1 (Stratagene) was obtained from Dr. Buddy Ullman (Oregon Health Sciences University, Portland, OR) and screened with the 175-bp PCR product obtained using oligonucleotides 1 and 3. The product of this PCR was purified by phenol-chloroform extraction, and ∼150 ng was radiolabeled with [α-32[P]dATP (New England Nuclear) using random oligonucleotide priming(19Feinberg A.P. Vogelstein B. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 132: 6-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (16567) Google Scholar). Four nylon filters (Schleicher and Schuell) containing approximately 2,000 colonies each were screened by filter hybridization (20Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) uitlizing the radiolabeled PCR fragment at a concentration of 2 × 105 counts/min ml−1, and eight positive clones were colony purified for further analysis. Two of these positive cosmid clones, AC6 and AC9, which contained between them the entire rac gene family, were selected for detailed analysis.DNA SequencingSegments of the AC6 and AC9 cosmids containing the coding regions of the rac-A and rac-B genes were subcloned into the plasmid vector Bluescript SK+ (Stratagene), and nested deletions were prepared by digestion with exonuclease III as described previously(21Cairns B.R. Collard M.W. Landfear S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 85: 2130-2134Google Scholar). Single-stranded DNA was prepared from these deletions (22Viera J. Messing J. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 153: 3-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (1999) Google Scholar) and sequenced by the dideoxy chain terminating method(23Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 74: 5463-5467Crossref Scopus (52363) Google Scholar), as described (21Cairns B.R. Collard M.W. Landfear S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 85: 2130-2134Google Scholar). In addition, some regions were sequenced utilizing synthetic oligonucleotides complementary to known regions of sequence. All sequences were obtained from both strands of the DNA. The partial sequences of RAC-C and RAC-D were obtained from double-stranded plasmid DNA using an A.L.F. automated DNA Sequencer (Pharmacia), and RAC-E partial sequence was obtained from double-stranded DNA by manual sequencing.Adenylate Cyclase ProbesThe AC-B probe was a 1.9-kb PstI restriction fragment from rac-B encoding amino acids 545-1174 (Fig. 1). This probe contains part of the conserved adenylate cyclase catalytic domain and part of the extracellular domain of RAC-B. The 1.4-kb AC-CD probe representing the conserved adenylate cyclase catalytic domain of RAC-A was prepared using the PCR and a forward primer (20-mer) initiating immediately downstream from the second putative transmembrane segment (II in Fig. 1) and a reverse primer initiating at the RAC-A stop codon and proceeding upstream for 20 nucleotides. The probes for the 3’-untranslated regions of rac-A and rac-B were a 1.0-kb EcoRI/SalI fragment and a 410-bp NheI/XhoI fragment, respectively, initiating ∼100 bp downstream from each stop codon. Hybridizations of Southern and Northern blots were performed in 50% formamide, 5 ×x SSC, 10 × Denhart's solution, 0.1% SDS, 5 mM EDTA at 42°C, and washes were performed in 0.1 × SSC, 0.1% SDS, 5 mM EDTA at 55°C.Expression of rac-A and rac-B mRNAs in Xenopus oocytesFor expression of rac mRNAs, the protein coding regions of rac-A and rac-B were subcloned into the oocyte expression vector pL2-5(24Arriza J.L. Kavanaugh M.P. Fairman W.A. Wu Y.-N. Murdoch G.H. North R.A. Amara S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15329-15332Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Capped transcripts were synthesized from these vectors utilizing T7 RNA polymerase as described previously(25Langford C.K. Little B.M. Kavanaugh M.P. Landfear S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17939-17943Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Approximately 0.5 ng of each transcript, as well as 2.5 ng of transcript from a similar plasmid containing the coding region of the CFTR chloride channel, were injected into defolliculated stage V-VI oocytes from X. laevis as detailed previously(25Langford C.K. Little B.M. Kavanaugh M.P. Landfear S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17939-17943Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After 4-5 days of incubation at 17°C in ND-96 buffer containing 96 mM NaCl, 2 mM KCl, 1.8 mM CaCl2, 1 mM MgCl2, 5 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, membrane currents were measured from each oocyte using the two-microelectrode voltage clamp technique(26Kavanaugh M.P. Arriza J.L. North R.A. Amara S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22007-22009Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Construction of a Dominant Negative Deletion Mutant of rac-AFor expression of a dominant negative version of the RAC-A protein, RAC-AΔ, the plasmid containing the rac-A insert within the pL2-5 plasmid was digested with XhoI, religated, and transformed into bacteria. Plasmids prepared from individual colonies were tested by restriction digestion to identify those which were missing the terminal 0.7-kb XhoI fragment and hence were missing the sequence encoding the 218 COOH-terminal amino acids of RAC-A. This plasmid was transcribed with T7 RNA polymerase, and the RNA was microinjected into oocytes as described above.cAMP AssaysQuantitation of cAMP was performed using the radioimmunoassay kit from Biomedical Technologies Inc. and the manufacturer's instructions. Oocytes were injected with 5 ng of either RAC-A or RAC-B cRNA and incubated in ND-96 for 3 days. Lysates were prepared from 15 oocytes containing each RNA and from 15 uninjected oocytes as follows. Each batch of oocytes was homogenized in 270 εl 10% trichloroacetic acid using a pestle and a microcentrifuge tube. This homogenate was clarified by centrifugation for 5 min in an Eppendorf microcentrifuge (Brinkmann Instruments, Inc.) for 5 min at 14,000 revolutions/min. The supernatant was extracted three times with 5 volumes of water-saturated ether, residual ether was removed by heating to 50°C for 30 min, and the samples were stored at −20°C. Aliquots of each lysate were diluted and assayed in duplicate by radioimmunoassay.RESULTSCloning and Sequencing of Adenylate Cyclase Genes from Leishmania donovaniA PCR-based strategy was used to clone receptor-adenylate cyclase genes from L. donovani based on the assumption that they would contain sequences related to those found in the highly conserved catalytic domains of the trypanosome proteins (9Alexandre S. Paindavoine P. Tebabi P. Pays A. Halleux S. Steinert M. Pays E. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1990; 43: 279-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 10Ross D.T. Raibaud A. Florent I.C. Sather S. Gross M.K. Storn D.R. Eisen H. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2047-2053Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). We chose four highly conserved peptides (see “Experimental Procedures”) present in the trypanosome cyclases in order to design degenerate oligonucleotide primers (oligonucleotides 1-4). When these oligonucleotides were used in the PCR (27Saiki R.K. Gelfand D.H. Stoffel S. Scharf S.J. Higuchi R. Horn G.T. Mullis K.B. Erlich H.A. Science. 1988; 239: 487-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (13401) Google Scholar) in conjunction with genomic DNA from L. donovani, L. mexicana, or L. enriettii, they amplified DNA fragments of sizes 175 bp (oligonucleotides 1 and 3), 275 bp (oligonucleotides 2 and 4), and 400 bp (oligonucleotides 1 and 4) (data not shown). These are the sizes of fragments that would be predicted for PCR amplification from DNA sequences closely related to the catalytic adenylate cyclase domains of the trypanosome genes, and these results suggested that L. donovani does contain genes related to the trypanosome adenylate cyclases.To determine the detailed structure of the Leishmania genes, we radiolabeled the 175-bp PCR fragment and used this reagent as a probe to screen a cosmid library of L. donovani genomic DNA. Two hybridizing cosmid clones, designated AC6 and AC9, were chosen for detailed structural analysis. The results of this analysis (see below and Fig. 3B) reveal that these two overlapping clones contain five clustered adenylate cyclase genes. Two of these genes, designated rac-A and rac-B, were then chosen for complete sequence analysis. The DNA sequence for each of these genes has been entered into the GenBank data base (rac-A and rac-B), and deduced protein sequences of rac-A and rac-B and their alignments with the T. brucei receptor-adenylate cyclase GRESAG4.3 (9Alexandre S. Paindavoine P. Tebabi P. Pays A. Halleux S. Steinert M. Pays E. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1990; 43: 279-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) are shown in Fig. 1. The sequences of the RAC-A (1380 amino acids) and RAC-B (1331 amino acids) proteins clearly reveal that they are members of the receptor-adenylate cyclase family and are closely related in sequence and structure to the trypanosome proteins that are members of this family. RAC-A and RAC-B both contain: (i) a putative transmembrane segment near the NH2 terminus (underlined sequences marked I in Fig. 1), (ii) a large (approximately 830 amino acid) hydrophilic domain that follows this first transmembrane segment, (iii) a second putative transmembrane segment (underlined sequence marked II in Fig. 1), and (iv) a COOH-terminal hydrophilic domain with a high degree of identity to the conserved catalytic domain of eukaryotic adenylate cyclases. In addition to these structural similarities, there is a high degree of sequence identity between the trypanosome proteins and the RAC-A and RAC-B proteins. Direct comparison between each of the three proteins indicates that RAC-A is 30.6% identical to the T. brucei GRESAG4.3 receptor-adenylate cyclase, RAC-B is 31.2% identical to this trypanosome protein, and RAC-A is 55.5% identical to RAC-B. The highest degree of identity occurs over the conserved catalytic domains which are 52.7% identical between RAC-A and GRESAG4.3, 52.4% identical between RAC-B and GRESAG4.3, and 88.0% identical between RAC-A and RAC-B. Within the putative extracellular domains, the identities between the RAC-A, RAC-B, and GRESAG4.3 are clustered in islands of high identity separated by stretches of low identity.Figure 3:Genomic arrangement of rac genes in L. donovani. A, Southern blot showing PstI digested DNA from L. donovani strain DI700 genomic DNA (genomic) or from cosmid clones AC9 and AC6. The blot was probed with the 1.9-kb PstI fragment of rac-B encoding part of the conserved adenylate cyclase catalytic domain (AC-B probe, “Experimental Procedures”). Numbers (kilobase pairs) at the left indicate the mobility of DNA molecular weight markers. Letters A-E indicate the five hybridizing PstI fragments present in both genomic DNA and in the cosmid inserts. B, restriction map of the rac gene cluster indicating the exact (rac-A and rac-B) or approximate (rac-C, rac-D and rac-E) locations of the rac gene coding regions. The restriction map was generated from single and multiple digestions with different restriction enzymes (A, AseI; B, BglII; D, DraI; E, EcoRI; N, NotI; P, PstI; S, SpeI). Sites with asterisks denote a partial restriction map for this enzyme, indicating that other sites exist within the insert which have not been mapped. Hatched bars at the top of the figure indicate the positions of the inserts for the AC6 and AC9 cosmid clones. The open letters A-E underneath the restriction map define the location of the rac-A through rac-E genes. The positions of the coding regions of rac-A and rac-B (open boxes) are known precisely from the restriction maps and the DNA sequence of these coding regions. The arrows underneath these boxes indicate the direction of transcription for these genes. The position of the 2.7-kb PstI fragment containing the adenylate cyclase conserved catalytic domain of rac-E (black box) is known because a PstI restriction fragment of this size that hybridizes to an adenylate cyclase catalytic domain probe (AC-CD probe, “Experimental Procedures”) is present at this location in the restriction map. Hence, this box defines the approximate position of the adenylate cyclase domain of rac-E. The 1.6-kb PstI fragment from rac-C is located between the EcoRI site and the right hand terminus of AC6; this region is shown as a cross-hatched box. The 1.2-kb PstI restriction fragment from rac-D that hybridizes to the adenylate cyclase probe is contained within the EcoRI/BglII restriction fragment of AC9, but is not present in AC6; hence, its approximate location is also shown as a cross-hatched box.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)There are several other structural features that are worthy of comment. First, it is not clear whether the first putative transmembrane segment is retained in the mature proteins and tethers the NH2 terminus to the membrane or whether it is cleaved during maturation of the polypeptide, as is the case in the structurally related atrial natriuretic peptide receptor(14Chang M.-S. Lowe D.G. Lewis M. Hellmiss R. Chen E. Goeddel D.V. Nature. 1989; 341: 68-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). However, analysis of these sequences using von Heijne's algorithm (28von Heijne G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 4683-4690Crossref PubMed Scopus (3686) Google Scholar) reveals a high similarity to known signal sequence cleavage sites at residue 53 of RAC-A and 59 of RAC-B, suggesting that these NH2-terminal hydrophobic sequences may be removed during processing. Second, RAC-A and RAC-B both contain multiple consensus sequences for asparagine-linked glycosylation (29Bause E. Biochem. J. 1983; 209: 331-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar) (not shown), both in the putative extracellular domains and within the RAC-A conserved catalytic domain. However, the extent to which the RAC-A and RAC-B proteins are modified by glycosylation is currently unknown. Finally while the adenylate cyclase catalytic domains are highly conserved, the extreme COOH terminus of RAC-A (amino acids 1307-1380) and RAC-B (amino acids 1315-1331) bears no similarity to each other, suggesting that antibodies directed against these sequences should be able to specifically recognize each distinct isoform and may be useful for studies on subcellular localization of each protein.Functional Expression of RAC-A and RAC-B Proteins in Xenopus oocytesAlthough the rac-A and rac-B genes encode proteins with pronounced sequence similarity to known adenylate cyclases, it is nonetheless important to demonstrate experimentally that these Leishmania proteins possess adenylate cyclase activity. A strategy that was employed successfully with the adenylate cyclase genes from T. brucei and T. equiperdum was to complement a temperature sensitive adenylate cyclase mutant of S. cerevisiae by transformation with the trypanosome gene and demonstrate the ability of the recombinant yeast to grow at the non-permissive temperature. However, in similar experiments, we were unable to complement either temperature-sensitive or missense mutants of the yeast cyr1 adenylate cyclase gene; hence, we attempted expression of rac-A and rac-B in Xenopus oocytes. This novel approach involves co-expression of the rac gene with the human CFTR gene, which encodes a chloride channel that is stimulated by phosphorylation of its regulatory domain via the cAMP-activated protein kinase A(30Tilly B.C. Winter M.C. Ostedgaard L.S. O'Riordan C. Smith A.E. Welsh M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9470-9473Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Hence, if the rac genes encode functional adenylate cyclases, their co-expression in oocytes with CFTR will increase the intracellular cAMP, activate protein kinase A, stimulate the chloride c"

However, their synthesis is complicated by the large number of different linking sites between each saccharide unit, the need for stereochemical control, the chemical sensitivity of the glycopeptide bonds, and the need to harmonize diverse protecting groups. Here, an efficient solid-phase synthesis of three N-linked glycopeptides based on glycal assembly is presented. The peptide domain can be extended while the ensemble remains bound to the polymer. The glycopeptides synthesized here are among the largest N-linked glycopeptides ever accessed by either solution- or solid-phase synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W2029739885,"Dematin is an actin-bundling protein of the erythroid membrane skeleton and is abundantly expressed in human brain, heart, skeletal muscle, kidney, and lung. The 48-kDa subunit of dematin contains a headpiece domain which was originally identified in villin, an actin-binding protein of the brush-border cytoskeleton. The headpiece domain of villin is essential for its morphogenic function in vivo. Here we report the primary structure of 52-kDa subunit of dematin which differs from the 48-kDa subunit by a 22-amino-acid insertion within its headpiece domain. A unique feature of the insertion sequence of the 52-kDa subunit is its homology to erythrocyte protein 4.2. The insertion sequence also includes a cysteine residue which may explain the formation of sulfhydryl-linked trimers of dematin. Actin binding measurements using recombinant fusion proteins revealed that each monomer of dematin contains two F-actin binding sites: one in the headpiece domain and the other in the undefined N-terminal domain. Although the actin bundling activity of intact dematin was abolished by phosphorylation, no effect of phosphorylation was observed on the actin binding activity of fusion proteins. Using somatic cell hybrid panels and fluorescence in situ hybridization, the dematin gene was localized on the short arm of chromosome 8. The dematin locus, 8p21.1, is distal to the known locus of human erythroid ankyrin (8p11.2) and may contribute to the etiology of hemolytic anemia in a subset of patients with severe hereditary spherocytosis.

Dematin is an actin-bundling protein that was originally identified as a component of the human erythroid membrane skeleton (1Siegel D.L. Branton D. J.

Faquin W. Wu C.-C. Branton D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8985-8991Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Purified dematin consists of two polypeptides of apparent molecular mass of 48 and 52 kDa, respectively(1Siegel D.L. Branton D. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 100: 775-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 2Chishti A.H. Levin A. Branton D. Nature. 1988; 334: 718-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 3Chishti A.H. Faquin W. Wu C.-C. Branton D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8985-8991Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recently we reported the primary structure of the 48 kDa subunit of dematin that contains a headpiece domain which was first defined in villin, an actin-binding and -bundling protein(4Rana A.P. Ruff P. Maalouf G.J. Speicher D.W. Chishti A.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6651-6655Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The headpiece domain of villin is essential for its actin bundling activity and is required for villin's actin modulating function in the microvillar cytoskeleton (5Friederich E. Vancompernolle K. Huet C. Goethals M. Finidori J. Vandekerckhove J. Louvard D. Cell. 1992; 70: 81-92Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Dematin differs from villin in two important respects. 1) In contrast to villin's restricted expression in absorptive epithelia, dematin is expressed widely in many tissues of distinct origin. 2) Unlike villin, the actin bundling activity of dematin is regulated by phosphorylation of dematin by cAMP-dependent protein kinase (2Chishti A.H. Levin A. Branton D. Nature. 1988; 334: 718-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Based on these distinctive features, it was suggested that dematin may substitute for villin in villin-negative tissues to modulate the organization of filamentous actin in a phosphorylation-dependent manner(4Rana A.P. Ruff P. Maalouf G.J. Speicher D.W. Chishti A.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6651-6655Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In solution, dematin exists as a trimer, and electron microscopy has shown that purified dematin exhibits a trilobed structure(1Siegel D.L. Branton D. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 100: 775-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 2Chishti A.H. Levin A. Branton D. Nature. 1988; 334: 718-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 3Chishti A.H. Faquin W. Wu C.-C. Branton D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8985-8991Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Each trimer of dematin appears to contain two polypeptides of 48 kDa and one polypeptide of 52 kDa, as estimated by the elution of Coomassie Blue dye from bands after gel electrophoresis(3Chishti A.H. Faquin W. Wu C.-C. Branton D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8985-8991Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although the two subunits appear to be structurally related, the origin of the 52-kDa subunit remained unknown(3Chishti A.H. Faquin W. Wu C.-C. Branton D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8985-8991Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Rana A.P. Ruff P. Maalouf G.J. Speicher D.W. Chishti A.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6651-6655Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The recent cloning of the 48-kDa subunit showed that there is only a single cysteine residue in its amino acid sequence(4Rana A.P. Ruff P. Maalouf G.J. Speicher D.W. Chishti A.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6651-6655Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). This observation implied that there must be an additional cysteine residue in the 52-kDa subunit to account for the formation of sulfhydryl-linked trimers containing two subunits of 48 kDa and one subunit of 52 kDa. To resolve these issues, we have determined the primary structure of the 52-kDa subunit of dematin. Here we report the amino acid sequence of the 52-kDa subunit which was deduced from the cDNA clones of dematin transcripts present in human reticulocytes. We also show that each subunit of dematin contains two actin binding sites: one in the headpiece domain and the other in an N-terminal undefined domain. Phosphorylation assays demonstrate that the actin binding activity of these domains is not regulated by phosphorylation. Finally, the fluorescence in situ hybridization data show that the dematin gene is located distal to the ankyrin locus on the short arm of chromosome 8. Glutathione-Sepharose, TA Cloning™ vector, and cAMP-dependent protein kinase were purchased from Pharmacia, Invitrogen, and Sigma, respectively. Constructs representing defined domains of dematin and villin were amplified from the corresponding cDNA templates using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR).1 1The abbreviations used are: PCRpolymerase chain reactionGSTglutathione S-transferaseDAPI4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindolePESTproline-glutamic acid-serine-threonine-rich regions. The PCR amplified products were subcloned into pGEX-2T plasmid, and fusion proteins were expressed in the Escherichia coli strains of DH5α and HB101. Fusion proteins containing glutathione S-transferase (GST) were purified by affinity chromatography as described(6Frangioni J.V. Neel B.G. Anal.

The following primers were used to produce the cDNA constructs. 1) Villin headpiece, Ala-753 to Phe-826, sense: 5′GCTAACAGCAACCTC; antisense: 5′TCAAAATAGTCC. 2) Dematin headpiece domain with and without the insert sequence, Ser-309 to Phe-383, sense: 5′TCAGGGAGTGAGACTGGAAGCCCA; antisense: 5′GAAGAGAGAGGCCTTCTTCTTGA. 3) The truncated headpiece domain of dematin, Pro-362 to Phe-383, sense: 5′CCTGAAGAGTTTGGC; antisense, 5′GAAGAGAGAGGCCTT. 4) N-terminal undefined domain of dematin, Met-1 to Pro-308, sense: 5′ATGGAACGGCTGCAG; antisense: 5′TGGGCTGAACTCCGT. 5) The truncated N-terminal domain, Ser-103 to Pro-308, sense: 5′AGCCGGTCGCCTGGA; antisense: 5′TGGGCTGAACTCCGT. Thirty five cycles of PCR amplification were carried out 55°C annealing for 1.0 min, 72°C elongation for 1.0 min, and 94°C denaturation for 1.0 min. Actin was isolated from rabbit skeletal muscle as described (7Spudich J.A. Watt S. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 4866-4871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and further purified by gel filtration on a Sephacryl 300 column. The actin binding assay mixture contained 240 μg/ml actin and an appropriate amount of the GST fusion protein in the following binding buffer: 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1.0 mM EDTA, 1.0 mM dithiothreitol, 10 mM KCl, 75.0 mM NaCl. After incubation for 2.0 h at room temperature, actin was sedimented by centrifugation at 35,000 rpm in a Type 42.2 Ti rotor at 4°C. The supernatant was carefully separated from the pellet, and both fractions were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The amount of proteins bound to actin filaments was quantified by either densitometry or the elution of Coomassie Blue by pyridine(8Fenner C. Traut R.R. Mason D.T. Wikman-Coffelt J. Anal. Biochem. 1975; 63: 595-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). A control peptide was synthesized containing the following sequence: biotin-T-S-P-P-P-S-P-E-V-W. Peptide, biotin-N-E-L-K-K-K-A-S-L-F, corresponds to the C terminus of the dematin headpiece domain. The sequence includes serine 381 which is a consensus site for phosphorylation by cAMP-dependent protein kinase. The two-dimensional peptide mapping was carried out as described(9Kidd G.H. Hunt R.E. Boeshore M.L. Pratt L.H. Nature. 1978; 276: 733-735Crossref Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Dematin was purified after treating intact red cells with a membrane-permeable protease inhibitor (MDL28170) as well as a protease inhibitor set (Boehringer Mannheim) which was included during subsequent steps of purification. These modifications in the original purification protocol (1Siegel D.L. Branton D. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 100: 775-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 2Chishti A.H. Levin A. Branton D. Nature. 1988; 334: 718-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) improved the stoichiometry of dematin to 69.9% (48-kDa subunit) and 30.1% (52-kDa subunit). Phosphorylation of GST fusion proteins by the catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase was carried out as described(2Chishti A.H. Levin A. Branton D. Nature. 1988; 334: 718-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 3Chishti A.H. Faquin W. Wu C.-C. Branton D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8985-8991Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of biotinylated peptides was measured after coupling these peptides to streptavidin-agarose beads. To determine the effect of phosphorylation on the actin binding activity of fusion proteins, purified proteins were phosphorylated by the catalytic subunit of cAMP kinase, and kinase was inactivated at 68°C as described before(2Chishti A.H. Levin A. Branton D. Nature. 1988; 334: 718-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Two panels of somatic cell hybrids were used to localize dematin gene on human chromosome. The first panel (A) contains nine human hamster hybrid cell lines containing varying complements of human chromosomes as described previously(10Bruns G. Stroh H. Veldman G.M. Latt S.A. Floros J. Hum. Genet. 1987; 76: 58-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The second panel is NIGMS monochromosomal somatic cell hybrid panel 2 (11Dubois B.L. Naylor S.L. Genomics. 1993; 16: 315-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) which was screened as described(12Beck J.S. Powers L.S. Sheffield V.C. Murray J.C. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1993; 53 (suppl.): A974Google Scholar). Selected individual hybrid DNAs were amplified by polymerase chain reaction to confirm assignments based on the pooled DNAs. Twenty-eight to thirty cycles of PCR amplification were carried out in an MJ Research PTC-100 thermal cycler set for 60°C annealing for 45 s; 72°C elongation for 30 s; and 94°C denaturation for 30 s. PCR products were visualized on 1% agarose gels stained with ethidium bromide. The following primers were used to amplify segments of the dematin gene from human genomic DNA. 1) Sense: OL1, 5′ACAGGAGGAAGAAAGGGAGAG; antisense: OL13, 5′AAACGAGGCAAGTCATCCA. This pair of primers amplified a 120-bp fragment from the 5′-untranslated region of dematin cDNA. 2) Sense: OL4, 5′ATGTCCCCTGAAGAGTTTGGC; antisense: OL6, AACTCTGTGTGCCAGAGCCCA. This pair of primers amplified a 332-bp fragment from the 3′-untranslated region of dematin cDNA. Using a PCR-based screen, the primer pair 4/6 was used to isolate three P1 clones from the DuPont Merck human foreskin fibroblast P1 library (DMPC-HFF1) by Genome Systems, Inc., St. Louis, MO. Human metaphase chromosomes were prepared from phytohemagglutinin-stimulated lymphocytes of a normal male by standard techniques. Purified DNA from the P1 clone 1977 was labeled with biotin-16-dUTP by nick translation. Hybridization and detection were performed with 150 ng of labeled probe as described previously(13Knoll J.H.M. Lichter P. Current Protocols in Human Genetics. Vol. 1. Green-Wiley, New York1994Google Scholar). Hybridization signals were detected with fluorescein-labeled avidin (Vector Laboratories, 7.0 μg/ml). Chromosomes were counterstained with propidium iodide and DAPI. Fluorescein and propidium iodide were visualized through a fluorescein isothiocyanate/Texas red dual band pass filter set (Omega Optical), and DAPI banding was viewed through a single band pass filter set (Zeiss). Photomicrographs were taken with Ektar 1000 color film (Kodak) or ektachrome 400 color slide film (Kodak). Despite many similarities between the 48-kDa and 52-kDa subunits of dematin(3Chishti A.H. Faquin W. Wu C.-C. Branton D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8985-8991Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the 52-kDa subunit appears to have subtle structural differences from the 48-kDa subunit based on the following observations. First, the electrophoretic mobility of the 52-kDa subunit changes depending upon the presence and absence of reducing agents, whereas no such mobility shift is observed with the 48-kDa subunit of dematin(3Chishti A.H. Faquin W. Wu C.-C. Branton D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8985-8991Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Secondly, the two-dimensional peptide mapping analysis revealed that although the two subunits of dematin shared many peptides, spots unique to both subunits were also detected (Fig. 1). The respective positions of these unique spots did not change even after an extensive in vitro dephosphorylation of purified dematin (not shown). These results indicated that the primary structure of the 52-kDa subunit may be similar to but not identical with that of the 48-kDa subunit of dematin. Based on this assumption, a PCR strategy was designed to amplify short segments of the 48-kDa subunit from total RNA isolated from human reticulocytes. Primers flanking the headpiece domain of the 48-kDa subunit produced a cDNA product that appeared as a doublet on agarose gels (not shown). Subsequent subcloning and sequencing of the cDNA doublet revealed that two distinct cDNA fragments were present in the band. One cDNA encoded the regular headpiece domain of the 48-kDa subunit(4Rana A.P. Ruff P. Maalouf G.J. Speicher D.W. Chishti A.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6651-6655Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), whereas the second cDNA fragment contained a novel headpiece domain with an additional 66-base pair sequence (Fig. 2). This insert sequence encodes an extra 22 amino acids in-frame, including a cysteine residue, in the headpiece sequence of the 48-kDa subunit (Fig. 2).Figure 2:Cloning and sequence alignment of the 52-kDa subunit. A, domain organization of the 52-kDa subunit of dematin. The primary structure of the 52-kDa subunit is identical with that of the 48-kDa subunit except for the insert sequence within the headpiece domain. B, the primary structure of the insert sequence encodes 22 amino acids. C, a comparison of the insert sequence with protein 4.2. Note that the first three amino acids (GLQ) are contributed from the headpiece domain which is common between the 48-kDa and 52-kDa subunits. The remaining eight amino acids are derived from the insert sequence of the 52-kDa subunit.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We have previously reported that the molecular mass of the 48- and 52-kDa subunits, as measured by the laser desorption mass spectrometry, corresponds to 43,265 Da and 46,175 Da, respectively(4Rana A.P. Ruff P. Maalouf G.J. Speicher D.W. Chishti A.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6651-6655Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). This difference of 2.91 kDa is in agreement with the 2.2-kDa difference calculated from the insert sequence of the 52-kDa subunit (Fig. 2). Using insert-specific primers, cDNA clones encoding the full-length 52-kDa subunit were isolated from human reticulocyte mRNA. The primary structure of the 52-kDa subunit is identical with that of the 48-kDa subunit except for the presence of a 22-amino-acid sequence inserted in the headpiece domain of the 52-kDa subunit (Fig. 2). The 52-kDa subunit cDNA clones contained three additional nucleotide changes. The codon for threonine 304 was changed from ACG to ACA without changing the amino acid. The codon for valine 325 (GTG) was changed to methionine (ATG) and serine 358 (TCT) to phenylalanine (TTT). The functional significance of these amino acid substitutions is not currently known. Alternatively, these changes may reflect polymorphisms in the 52-kDa subunit. The observed changes were confirmed by four independent PCR amplifications, and the original codons of the 48-kDa subunit, as reported previously(4Rana A.P. Ruff P. Maalouf G.J. Speicher D.W. Chishti A.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6651-6655Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), were confirmed. Alignment of the 22 amino acids of insert sequence with the available data bank showed that the N-terminal eight amino acids were identical with a motif found in human erythrocyte protein 4.2 (Fig. 2). Additional alignment analysis of the 52-kDa subunit containing the insert sequence revealed homology with protein 4.2 that extended further and included three additional amino acids derived from the headpiece domain just preceding the insert sequence (Fig. 2). Therefore, 11 amino acids of the 52-Da subunit of dematin are identical with a motif present in protein 4.2 (Fig. 2). This 11-amino-acid motif is also conserved in murine protein 4.2 except that a histidine residue has replaced an arginine of the human protein 4.2 as shown in Fig. 2. The functional significance of this shared motif in dematin and protein 4.2 is not yet known. In order to determine the number and location of actin binding sites in dematin, segments of dematin cDNA were expressed in bacteria as glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins (Fig. 3). As shown in Fig. 4 and Table 1, the headpiece domain of both 48-kDa and 52-kDa subunits sedimented with actin filaments. The presence of a 22-amino-acid insert sequence did not affect the actin binding activity of the headpiece domain (Fig. 4). To further map the actin binding site within the headpiece domain, a GST fusion protein was made containing the C-terminal 22 amino acids of the headpiece domain (Fig. 4). This fusion protein containing a truncated headpiece domain also sedimented with actin filaments showing that the actin binding site is located within the C-terminal 22 amino acids of the headpiece domain. To further narrow the actin binding site, a synthetic peptide containing the last 10 amino acids of the headpiece domain was produced. This biotin-conjugated peptide, N-L-E-L-K-K-K-A-S-L-F, did not sediment with actin filaments (not shown) indicating that although the consensus sequence for the actin binding site is located within the last 10 amino acids of the headpiece domain (see “Discussion”), the in vitro actin binding activity of the headpiece domain requires participation of at least 22 amino acids (Fig. 3).Figure 4:Actin binding activity of recombinant fusion proteins. Specified domains of dematin and villin were expressed in bacteria as glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins. The location of respective constructs is described in Fig. 3. Actin binding activity of purified fusion proteins was measured by a sedimentation assay (see “Experimental Procedures”). Bovine serum albumin (BSA) was added to reduce nonspecific binding.

Ruff P. Maalouf G.J. Speicher D.W. Chishti A.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6651-6655Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In this respect, dematin differs from villin which has an actin-binding N-terminal domain that is homologous to gelsolin, severin, and fragmin(14Arpin M. Pringault E. Finidori J. Garcia A. Jeltsch J.M. Vandekerckhove J. Louvard D. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 1759-1766Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 15Bazari W.L. Matsudaira P. Wallek M. Smeal T. Jakes R. Ahmed Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 4986-4990Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The N-terminal undefined domain of dematin contains a PEST sequence and a highly negatively charged motif of 10 glutamic and aspartic acid residues(4Rana A.P. Ruff P. Maalouf G.J. Speicher D.W. Chishti A.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6651-6655Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In order to determine whether this N-terminal domain of dematin contains a second actin binding site, the respective fusion proteins were assayed for actin binding activity. Because of the presence of the PEST sequence, the GST fusion protein containing a full length N-terminal undefined domain was proteolyzed during purification from bacterial lysates (not shown). Nevertheless, this proteolyzed fusion protein containing 25-kDa fragments sedimented with actin filaments (Table 1). To further confirm this binding, a GST fusion protein was made which lacked the N-terminal PEST sequence (Fig. 3). This fusion protein encoding a truncated undefined domain did not undergo proteolysis and also sedimented with actin filaments (Table 1). The fusion protein containing only the PEST sequence was extensively proteolyzed and therefore could not be tested for its actin binding activity (not shown). In summary, the results of actin binding measurements show that each subunit of dematin contains at least two actin binding sites: one in the headpiece domain and the other in the N-terminal undefined domain. The headpiece domain of dematin contains a consensus phosphorylation site for protein kinase A at serine 381(4Rana A.P. Ruff P. Maalouf G.J. Speicher D.W. Chishti A.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6651-6655Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In contrast, the villin headpiece domain contains an alanine residue at the corresponding position(13Knoll J.H.M. Lichter P. Current Protocols in Human Genetics. Vol. 1. Green-Wiley, New York1994Google Scholar, 14Arpin M. Pringault E. Finidori J. Garcia A. Jeltsch J.M. Vandekerckhove J. Louvard D. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 1759-1766Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Because the actin bundling activity of dematin, but not of villin, is regulated by phosphorylation (2Chishti A.H. Levin A. Branton D. Nature. 1988; 334: 718-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 3Chishti A.H. Faquin W. Wu C.-C. Branton D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8985-8991Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it was suspected that the phosphorylation of serine 381 may regulate this effect. To test this hypothesis, we first examined whether the headpiece domain of dematin was phosphorylated by protein kinase A in vitro. The glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins containing headpiece domains of the 48-kDa and 52-kDa subunits were excellent substrates of protein kinase A, whereas no phosphorylation was observed with the headpiece domain of villin (Table 1). To further confirm that the site of phosphorylation in the headpiece domain was in fact serine 381, a synthetic peptide was produced that contained the C-terminal 10 amino acids of the headpiece domain of dematin. This synthetic peptide was an excellent substrate of cAMP-dependent protein kinase confirming that serine 381 is indeed the site of phosphorylation (not shown). We then examined whether the actin binding activity of the dematin headpiece domain was regulated by phosphorylation. Actin binding by fusion proteins containing headpiece domains of dematin remained unchanged upon their phosphorylation by protein kinase A (Fig. 5, Table 1). We also examined the possibility that the inhibitory effect of phosphorylation on dematin's actin bundling activity may be mediated via the phosphorylation of an N-terminal undefined domain (Fig. 2). The fusion protein containing the truncated undefined domain of dematin was also phosphorylated in vitro by protein kinase A, but again no effect of phosphorylation was observed on its actin binding activity (Fig. 5, Table 1). The above results show that although the actin bundling activity of dematin is completely abolished by phosphorylation (2Chishti A.H. Levin A. Branton D. Nature. 1988; 334: 718-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 3Chishti A.H. Faquin W. Wu C.-C. Branton D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8985-8991Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the actin binding activities of respective domains are not altered by phosphorylation. This result is consistent with our previous observation that the phosphorylated dematin remains associated with actin filaments even though it cannot hold filaments in a bundled conformation(2Chishti A.H. Levin A. Branton D. Nature. 1988; 334: 718-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 3Chishti A.H. Faquin W. Wu C.-C. Branton D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8985-8991Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The chromosomal location of the dematin gene was determined using somatic cell hybrid panels and dematin specific primers. The primer pairs OL1/OL13 and OL4/OL6 were combined and used to detect the dematin gene sequences in two somatic cell hybrid panels segregating human chromosomes in a rodent background. These pooled primers did not amplify the dematin gene in control rodent DNAs but segregated with human chromosome 8 in hybrids and were discordant with the segregation of all other human chromosomes (Table 2). This assignment was confirmed by positive amplification of the dematin gene in the monochromosomal hybrid GM/NA10156B containing only human chromosome 8 (not shown). These results indicate that the dematin gene is located on human chromosome 8.TABLE II Open table in a new tab Regional localization of the dematin gene on chromosome 8 was performed by fluorescence in situ hybridization with a genomic P1 clone of dematin. The primer pair OL4/OL6 was used to isolate three P1 genomic clones specific for human dematin from the DuPont Merck P1 library (see “Experimental Procedures”). The identity of these clones was established by Southern blot analysis (not shown). The DNA from one of the three P1 clones, designated P1-1977, was biotinylated and hybridized to human chromosomes. Fifteen metaphases with single or double chromatid hybridizations were examined using the P1-1977 genomic probe. All revealed hybridization on the short arm of chromosome 8."

The enzyme was purified to apparent homogeneity by a four-step procedure: chloroform shock, ammonium sulfate precipitation, and chromotography on DEAE-Sephacel and Cibacron Blue 3GA-agarose. The active enzyme consists of a single polypeptide with a mass of 34 kDa. At 25°C, it has a pH optimum of 8.25, a Km for cAMP of 73 εm, and a Vmax of 3700 εmol of cAMP hydrolyzed/min/mg protein (turnover number of 1.24 × 105/min). The specific activity of the V. fischeri enzyme is approximately 20-fold greater than that of any previously characterized CNP when comparisons of activity are made at the same assay temperature. Activity increases with temperature up to 60°C. The CNP contains 2 atoms of zinc/monomer, and zinc, copper, magnesium, and calcium can restore activity of the apoenzyme to varying degrees.

The enzyme typically is located in the cytoplasm of cells. In eukaryotic organisms, several isozymes function in a variety of signal-mediated processes by modulating cytoplasmic levels of cAMP and cGMP(1Beavo J. Beavo J. Houslay M.D. Cyclic Nucleotide Phophodiesterases: Structure, Regulation and Drug Action. John Wiley and Sons, Chichester1990: 3-15Google Scholar). Many prokaryotes also produce a cytoplasmic CNP. In bacteria, cAMP regulates gene transcription via interaction with a cAMP receptor protein. However, rather than CNP-mediated hydrolysis of cAMP or excretion from the cytoplasm, regulation of the synthesis of cAMP is thought to control cellular levels in bacteria(2Botsford J.L. Harman G. Microbiol. Rev. 1992; 56: 100-122Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Ullman A. Danchin A. Adv. Cyclic Nucleotide Res. 1983; 15: 1-52Google Scholar). A CNP with atypical locations in the cell has been described from the cellular slime mold Dictyostelium discoideum. That enzyme is unique in occurring as both extracellular and cell membrane-associated forms, which catalyze the hydrolysis of extracellular cAMP involved in morphogenetic and aggregational signaling during plasmodium formation(4Kessin R.H.

We recently described a second extra-cytoplasmic CNP. The enzyme occurs in the marine bacterium Vibrio fischeri, which establishes a luminescent mutualism with certain marine animals. Its periplasmic location and high activity confer on V. fischeri the novel ability to utilize extracellular 3’:5’-cyclic nucleotides as sources of carbon and energy, nitrogen, and phosphorus for growth(6Dunlap P.V. Mueller U. Lisa T.A. Lundberg K.S. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1992; 138: 115-123Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The gene, cpdP, for this enzyme is the only bacterial CNP gene that has been cloned. The deduced amino acid sequence exhibits 34% identity with the extracellular CNP of D. discoideum and 30% identity with the low affinity CNP (PDE1) of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae(7Dunlap P.V. Callahan S.M. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 4615-4624Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The V. fischeri enzyme is specific for 3’:5’-cyclic nucleotides (6Dunlap P.V. Mueller U. Lisa T.A. Lundberg K.S. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1992; 138: 115-123Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar) and, therefore, differs from previously described bacterial periplasmic phosphatases such as 2’:3’-cyclic phosphodiesterase:3’-nucleotidase (EC 3.1.4.16) and 5’-nucleotidase (EC 3.1.3.5). The V. fischeri enzyme has been proposed to play a central role in the luminescent (light organ) symbiosis of V. fischeri with sepiolid squids and monocentrid fish(6Dunlap P.V. Mueller U. Lisa T.A. Lundberg K.S. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1992; 138: 115-123Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Since periplasmic CNP activity is rare in bacteria(6Dunlap P.V. Mueller U. Lisa T.A. Lundberg K.S. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1992; 138: 115-123Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar), the enzyme may contribute to the specificity of the symbiosis by permitting V. fischeri cells to utilize putative host-released cAMP as a nutrient. Alternatively, the enzyme may function to degrade 3’:5’-cyclic nucleotides released from organisms into the marine environment(6Dunlap P.V. Mueller U. Lisa T.A. Lundberg K.S. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1992; 138: 115-123Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 7Dunlap P.V. Callahan S.M. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 4615-4624Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this report, we describe the purification and biochemical properties of the V. fischeri periplasmic CNP. A detailed understanding of the enzyme may lead to insights into the physiological and ecological roles of bacterial CNPs and the possibility of cAMP-mediated symbiotic interactions between V. fischeri and its hosts. Myokinase (360 units/mg), pyruvate kinase (200 units/mg), lactate dehydrogenase (550 units/mg), and crystalline bovine serum albumin were purchased from Boehringer Mannheim. 5’-Nucleotidase (Crotalus adamanteus venom), 5’-ATP (disodium salt), NADH (disodium salt), 3’:5’-cyclic nucleotides, Trizma grade tris, phosphenolpyruvate (tri-cyclohexylammonium salt), Cibacron Blue-agarose 3GA, DEAE-Sephacel, and Sephacryl HR200 were obtained from Sigma, and Coomassie R-250 was from Fisher Chemical Co. (Pittsburgh, PA). V. fischeri strain MJ-1, from the light organ of the monocentrid fish Monocentris japonicus(8Ruby E.G. Nealson K.H. Biol. Bull. 1976; 151: 574-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), was maintained on LBS agar (6Dunlap P.V. Mueller U. Lisa T.A. Lundberg K.S. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1992; 138: 115-123Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar) at room temperature. Liquid cultures were grown at 26°C with aeration (150 revolutions/min) in minimal medium containing 300 mM NaCl, 10 mM KCl, 50 mM MgSO4, 10 mM CaCl2, 15 mM NH4Cl, 0.3 mM α-glycerophosphate, 20 mg/liter ferric ammonium citrate, 10 mM glucose, and 100 mM HEPES, pH 7.5. Cultures for enzyme purification were initiated with a 1% inoculum that had been grown to mid-exponential phase in minimal medium. Cells were harvested by centrifugation approximately 3 h after cultures attained stationary phase, at which point they produced a high level of luminescence. Cells were separated into outer membrane, inner membrane, and cytoplasmic/periplasmic (i.e. soluble) fractions as described for Vibrio cholerae(9Miller V.A. Mekalanos J.J. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 2575-2583Crossref PubMed Scopus (1715) Google Scholar). Three assays were used for measurement of CNP activity. In assay 1, the standard method used in this study, rates of hydrolysis of cAMP to AMP were measured by a modification of a coupled assay with adenylate kinase, pyruvate kinase, and lactate dehydrogenase(10Chassin M. Harris D.N. Chassin M. Harris D.N. Methods in Cyclic Nucleotide Research. Marcel Dekker, New York1972: 169-198Google Scholar). Specifically, identical reference and reaction mixtures consisted of 2 mM cAMP (except where otherwise indicated), 0.6 mM ATP, 0.17 mM NADH, 0.5 mM phosphoenolpyruvate, 4 units of adenylate kinase, 4 units of pyruvate kinase, 10 units of lactate dehydrogenase, 20 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, and 100 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.25, in a volume of 2 ml. The reaction was initiated by addition of samples containing CNP, and the production of NAD+ from NADH was monitored spectrophotometrically as the change in absorbance at 340 nm. Consistent with the coupled nature of the assay, the reaction exhibits a lag that is inversely proportional to the amount of CNP added. Following the lag, the reaction rate is linear up to a ΔA340 of 0.8. CNP activity was calculated from the linear portion of the reaction using the extinction coefficient of 6.22/mM/cm (11Horecker B.L. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1948; 175: 385-390Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) taking into account that 2 mol of NAD+ are produced per mole of cAMP hydrolyzed. One unit of CNP activity is defined as the activity that catalyzes the hydrolysis of 1 εmol of cAMP in 1 min. Control experiments demonstrated that the reaction rates obtained with assay 1 were linearly dependent on the amount of CNP in the reaction mixture over a 4-fold range (0.04-0.164 εmol of NADH oxidized/min), indicating that the observed CNP activity was not limited by any of the rate indicator components. This finding was confirmed at each temperature used in the determinations of Km and Vmax. Furthermore, since adenosine was found to be a competitive inhibitor of CNP (see “Results”), control experiments were conducted and verified that ATP (included in the assay at 0.6 mM as an adenylate kinase substrate) does not inhibit CNP activity. Assay 2, a two-stage version of assay 1, was developed to examine the effects of pH, temperature, and metal ions on CNP activity without interference of these effects on the activities of the coupling enzymes. In the first stage, samples containing CNP were added to reaction mixtures containing 100 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.25, and 6 mM cAMP in a volume of 1.0 ml; the reactions were initiated by the addition of the CNP and were terminated at various times by the addition of 53 εl of 60% (w/v) perchloric acid, which irreversibly inactivated the CNP. This mixture was placed on ice, and 142 εl of 3 M KOH was then added to raise the pH to approximately 6 and to precipitate the perchlorate anion. In the second stage, 20 εl of the perchlorate/KOH-treated reaction mixture was added to a mixture containing the components of Assay 1 except for the CNP and cAMP. The total ΔA340 was used to calculate the amount of cAMP hydrolyzed to AMP during the first-stage reaction. Rates were linear with respect to the time of the first reaction. Rate measurements made with assay 2 agreed within 10% of those made with assay 1. Assay 3, used for substrates other than cAMP, was a modification of a previously described method (6Dunlap P.V. Mueller U. Lisa T.A. Lundberg K.S. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1992; 138: 115-123Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 12Butcher R.W. Sutherland E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1962; 237: 1244-1250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with the following additional changes: 100 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.25 at 25°C as the reaction buffer, without MnCl2 which was not required for V. fischeri CNP activity, and with a 5’-nucleotidase reaction time of 30 min. Unless otherwise indicated, assays 1-3 were conducted at 25°C. Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Bradford (13Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as the standard. Periplasmic proteins were released from intact V. fischeri cells by a chloroform shock method(14Ames G.F.-L. Prody C. Kustu S. J. Bacteriol. 1984; 160: 1181-1183Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells from two 1-liter cultures were collected by centrifugation (10,000 × g, 10 min) and resuspended in 100 ml of 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0 (buffer 1) at 4°C. 20 ml of chloroform was added to the cell suspension, which was inverted once to mix and then held at room temperature for 10 min. An additional 200 ml of buffer 1 was added, after which cells and chloroform were pelleted by centrifugation (16,000 × g, 20 min, 4°C). Buffer 1 was added to the supernatant (periplasmic extract) to adjust its protein concentration to 1 mg/ml. All subsequent steps of the purification were conducted at 4°C. The periplasmic extract was fractionated with ammonium sulfate, and the protein that precipitated between 40 and 70% of saturation was collected by centrifugation (16,000 × g, 10 min) and dissolved in 10 ml of 10 mM imidazole buffer, pH 7.5 (buffer 2). The protein solution was then dialyzed for 18 h against three 1-liter volumes of buffer 2, changed at 0, 6, and 12 h, to remove the residual ammonium sulfate. The dialyzed ammonium sulfate fraction was applied to 2 ml of packed DEAE-Sephacel equilibrated with buffer 2 in a 10-ml Poly-Prep column (Bio-Rad). 10 ml of 50 mM NaCl in buffer 2 was run through the column and discarded. CNP was then eluted from the column with 10 ml of 100 mM NaCl in buffer 2. The entire eluate was immediately applied to 1 ml of Cibacron Blue-agarose equilibrated with 100 mM MgSO4 in a second 10-ml Poly-Prep column. An initial wash with 10 ml of 1 M KCl, 50 mM Tris base (untitrated, pH 10.3; buffer 3) removed the majority of bound protein, and CNP was then eluted with 5 ml of buffer 3 containing 1 mM adenosine. At this point, aliquots were taken for SDS-PAGE analysis, activity assays, and protein determination. To preserve activity, crystalline bovine serum albumin was added to 5 mg/ml to the remaining sample. The adenosine was removed by 18 h of dialysis with three 1-liter changes of 1 M KCl and 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 9.0. Without the addition of bovine serum albumin, CNP activity declined during storage at −80°C. With bovine serum albumin, no loss of activity was detected after 12 months of storage at −80°C with repeated thawing and freezing. For SDS-PAGE, the method of Laemmli (15Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) was followed using 14% separating and 6% stacking gels. Proteins were stained with Coomassie Blue R-250 at 60°C. For gel-filtration chromatography, a 1.5 × 50-cm column containing Sephacryl HR200 was used with 1 M KCl buffered with 100 mM Tris-HCl, pH 9.0, at 4°C at a flow rate of 19 ml/h. Fractions were collected each minute and assayed for CNP activity by assay 1. A 300-εl aliquot of purified CNP solution containing 5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin was dialyzed for 140 h against three 100-ml volumes of 1 M KCl, 1 mM EDTA, and 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 9.0, at 4°C changed at 0, 48, and 96 h. After dialysis, 1% of the starting enzyme activity remained. The EDTA was then removed by size exclusion chromatography using a Bio-Spin 6 Column (Bio-Rad) prewashed with 1 mM EDTA and re-equilibrated with deionized water according the manufacturer's instructions. Nine divalent metal ions (Specpure Analytical Standard salts (Johnson Matthey, Ward Hill, MA)) were added to reaction mixtures for the first stage of assay 2 at concentrations of 1, 10, and 100 εM to test for their ability to reactivate the apoenzyme. Those metals found to reactivate the apoenzyme were examined further to determine their optimal concentrations for reactivation. Percent reactivation of the apoenzyme was calculated as: [(activity of apoenzyme with metal ion addition) minus (activity without metal ion addition)]/[activity of control without EDTA] × 100. ICPES analysis of the purified CNP was performed by the Chemical Analysis Laboratory, University of Georgia (Athens, GA) using the Thermo Jarrell Ash 965 Inductively Coupled Argon Plasma with simultaneous 31 element capability. The CNP was tested for the presence of 31 elements including calcium, cadmium, cobalt, copper, iron, magnesium, manganese, nickel, and zinc which are most frequently found as components of metalloproteins. The metal content of CNP samples was corrected for metal content in control samples containing buffer alone. Previously, we demonstrated the CNP activity of V. fischeri to be soluble in the periplasm(6Dunlap P.V. Mueller U. Lisa T.A. Lundberg K.S. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1992; 138: 115-123Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar). That study, however, did not address the possibility that the enzyme also occurs in a cytoplasmic membrane- or outer membrane-associated form or that it is released into the extracellular environment. To test these possibilities, we examined membrane and soluble fractions of V. fischeri cells and the cell-free growth medium for CNP activity. Cells were separated into outer-membrane, cytoplasmic membrane, and cytoplasm/periplasm (soluble) fractions. Total cellular CNP activity before fractionation was 291 units, and the fractions were found to contain 0.5, 6, and 224 units, respectively, demonstrating that the enzyme is not associated with either the outer membrane or the cytoplasmic membrane. No CNP activity was observed in the cell-free growth medium following growth of V. fischeri cells to high population density or in protein precipitated from the cell-free growth medium by the addition of ammonium sulfate to 80% of saturation. The enzyme, therefore, does not appear to be released into the extracellular environment. A four-step procedure was developed that resulted in purification of the enzyme by approximately 4000-fold (Table 1) and to apparent homogeneity (Fig. 1). The first step, chloroform shock, served to disrupt the outer membrane and release the periplasmic contents from the cells, giving an approximately 3-fold increase in specific activity relative to whole cells. No cell lysis was detected by phase contrast microscopy when cells were mixed gently with the chloroform. Vigorous mixing of cells with the chloroform eliminated most of the CNP activity, as did freezing of the sample at any step in the purification procedure before it was complete.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab The second step, fractionation of the periplasmic suspension with ammonium sulfate, gave a 2-fold increase in specific activity. It also served to concentrate the sample for the two subsequent chromatographic steps, in which most of the purification was achieved. In the third step, the resolubilized ammonium sulfate fraction was bound to and eluted from DEAE-Sephacel, resulting in a 25-fold purification. Earlier purification attempts using buffer 2 in this anion-exchange step at a pH of 6.0, which is close to the protein's calculated pI of 5.5(7Dunlap P.V. Callahan S.M. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 4615-4624Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), were successful but substantial losses of activity occurred. Therefore, the enzyme is apparently unstable at low pH. Adjusting buffer 2 to pH 7.5 (Table 1) eliminated the loss of activity. In the final step, in which the DEAE-Sephacel eluate was bound to and eluted from Cibacron Blue-agarose, a 26-fold purification was achieved. The simplicity of the purification procedure overall results from the high affinity of the protein for the blue-agarose dye matrix in this step. The high affinity permits the extreme conditions of high KCl concentration and high pH to be used to elute the majority of contaminating proteins. Adenosine, a competitive inhibitor of the V. fischeri CNP with a Ki of approximately 800 εM (data not shown), was used at a concentration of 1 mM in the wash buffer to elute CNP from the blue-agarose. SDS-PAGE analysis of the adenosine eluate revealed a single protein, even when the gel was heavily loaded (Fig. 1). The enzyme was estimated to account for approximately 0.025% of the total cellular protein and 0.07% of the periplasmic protein. Previously, the enzyme purified in this manner was subjected to microsequence analysis of the first 20 residues at the amino-terminal end, and the sequence for the mature protein matched that deduced from the cloned gene(7Dunlap P.V. Callahan S.M. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 4615-4624Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The purified protein exhibited a monomeric molecular mass of approximately 34,000 Da on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1), which is consistent with the mass of the protein calculated from the deduced amino acid sequence of the cloned cpdP gene (33,636 for the protein without its leader sequence; 7). To determine if the enzyme was active as a monomer, we used a calibrated Sephacryl gel filtration column to conduct size exclusion chromatography of the purified protein under non-denaturing conditions. The CNP activity in each of three trials eluted as a single molecular species, with an estimated molecular mass of 32,000 ± 800 Da (mean ± S.D.). A representative experiment is shown in Fig. 2. The similarity of the estimated masses under denaturing and non-denaturing conditions indicates that the native enzyme is active as a monomer and may be present in the periplasm as such. Activity of the purified periplasmic protein was maximal at pH 8.25, with half-maximal activities at pH values of approximately 7.0 and 9.0 (Fig. 3). The enzyme obeys typical Michaelis-Menten kinetics and has a Kmfor cAMP of 73 εM at pH 8.25 and 25°C (Fig. 4A), as derived from a Hofstee plot(16Hofstee B.H.J. Science. 1952; 116: 329-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). Vmax at 25°C, calculated from the Hofstee plot (Fig. 4A), was 3700 units/mg protein, and the measured rate at 2 mM cAMP was approximately 3400 units/mg. The corresponding turnover number using the calculated molecular mass of 33,636 is 1.24 × 105/min.Figure 4:Effect of temperature on hydrolysis of cAMP by V. fischeri periplasmic CNP. The assay mixture was adjusted to pH 8.25 at each temperature. Data presented are the averages of duplicate assays. A, Hofstee (16Hofstee B.H.J. Science. 1952; 116: 329-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar) plots were used to calculate values of K and Vmax for cAMP hydrolysis at various temperatures: 5°C, K = 53 εM and Vmax = 588 units/mg (■); 15°C, K = 59 εM and Vmax = 2077 units/mg (○); 25°C, K = 73 εM and Vmax = 3730 units/mg (×); 35°C, K = 132 εM and Vmax = 8764 units/mg (♦). For each data point, the measured values differed by <3% from the average. B, plot of measured specific activities at different temperatures. For each data point, the measured values differed by <5% from the average.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) It was of interest to determine if the CNP exhibited maximum activity at a temperature that the bacterium experiences in seawater. Enzymatic reactions in V. fischeri, as in many marine plants and poikilothermic animals, generally occur at temperatures of approximately 27°C or lower. Remarkably, the rate of the CNP-catalyzed reaction increases with temperature up to 60°C (Fig. 4B) at which temperature the measured specific activity was about 27,000 units/mg, indicating that the CNP is active at temperatures much higher than it is expected to experience in nature. Km and Vmax were determined at 10°C intervals between 5 and 35°C (Fig. 4A). The Km for cAMP increased from 53 εM at 5°C to 132 εM at 35°C, and Vmax increased by 15-fold over the same range, giving a coefficient of 2.47/10°C rise in temperature. Previously, we demonstrated that the V. fischeri periplasmic CNP is specific for 3’:5’-cyclic nucleotides(6Dunlap P.V. Mueller U. Lisa T.A. Lundberg K.S. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1992; 138: 115-123Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Consistent with that study, cGMP was utilized at approximately half the rate of cAMP (Table 2). The rates observed with cCMP, cIMP, and cUMP were similar to or somewhat higher than that with cAMP, whereas those with the 2’-deoxy-cyclic nucleotides, 2’-deoxy-cAMP and cTMP, were 3-fold lower.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab Our earlier observation that EDTA inhibits activity (6Dunlap P.V. Mueller U. Lisa T.A. Lundberg K.S. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1992; 138: 115-123Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar) suggested that the CNP might be a metalloenzyme or might require a divalent metal ion cofactor for full activity. Furthermore, sequence similarity of the V. fischeri enzyme to a known zinc enzyme, the low affinity CNP (PDE1) of S. cerevisiae, including the conservation of 4 histidine residues in the two sequences (7Dunlap P.V. Callahan S.M. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 4615-4624Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggested that the V. fischeri enzyme contains zinc. Therefore, we tested three chelators of zinc for their effects on CNP activity: EDTA, dithiothreitol, and 1,10-orthophenanthroline. The chelators, present in the reaction mixture at 1 mM, inhibited CNP activity 23, 64, and 98%, respectively. With regard to inhibition by dithiothreitol, a strong chelator of zinc(17Cornell N.W. Crivaro K.E. Anal. Biochem. 1972; 47: 203-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), it should be noted that the mature CNP protein has no cysteine residues(7Dunlap P.V. Callahan S.M. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 4615-4624Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); thus, the inhibition by dithiothreitol cannot be due to effects on sulfhydryl groups or disulfide bonds. Subsequent analysis by ICPES detected 2.2 mol zinc/mol CNP, while none of the other 30 elements tested was detected in significant quantities. We conclude that the native V. fischeri CNP is a zinc-containing enzyme, with two atoms of zinc/peptide. Reactivation of zinc-free apoenzyme with various metal ions supported this conclusion. The apoenzyme was prepared by dialysis of the purified protein against EDTA, followed by size exclusion chromatography to separate EDTA♦metal complexes from the apoenzyme. 140 h of dialysis was required to reduce CNP activity to 1% that of a control sample dialyzed against buffer alone, which retained 94% of its original activity (Fig. 5A). After removal of EDTA from the sample, nine divalent metal ions, Ca2+, Cd2+, Co2+, Cu2+, Fe2+, Mg2+, Mn2+, Ni2+, and Zn2+, were added to the apoenzyme to test their ability to restore activity. Four metal ions reactivated the apoenzyme to varying degrees (Fig. 5B). Zinc was the most effective; 1 εM restored 94% of the activity of the control sample. Concentrations above 1 εM were less effective or inhibitory. Copper (1 εM), magnesium (10 mM), and calcium (50 εM) restored 33, 47, and 67% of the activity, respectively. Magnesium was still increasing enzyme activity at 10 mM, the highest concentration tested. To test for the involvement of a loosely bound metal ion in CNP activity, metal ions were added to the reaction mixture with holoenzyme that had not been exposed to EDTA. Of the nine metal ions tested with the apoenzyme, none enhanced activity of the holoenzyme at a concentration of 100 εM, whereas Zn2+ and Cu2+ inhibited holoenzyme activity about 25% and Cd2+ inhibited 77%. No inhibition was observed with calcium or magnesium. Purification of the the periplasmic CNP of V. fischeri to apparent homogeneity permitted the characterization of some of its properties. Several of these, including its narrow substrate specificity, stability, abundance in the cell, specific activity, and the ability of certain metal ions to reactivate apoenzyme are unusual and provide insight into the role of the enzyme in the biology of V. fischeri and the ecology of cyclic nucleotides in seawater. The narrow substrate specificity of the V. fischeri CNP is atypical for a periplasmic nucleotidase. Other nucleotide degrading periplasmic phosphatases, such as alkaline phosphatase, acid phosphatases, 2’:3’-cyclic phosphodiesterase:3’-nucleotidase, and UDP-glucose hydrolase:5’-nucleotidase, are each capable of hydrolyzing multiple types of phosphorylated compounds, but the CNP of V. fischeri is specific for 3’:5’-cyclic nucleotides; it shows no activity with 2’:3’-cAMP, ADP, ATP, or non-nucleotide phosphate esters (6Dunlap P.V. Mueller U. Lisa T.A. Lundberg K.S. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1992; 138: 115-123Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Activity measurements with various 3’:5’-cyclic nucleotides suggest that the 2’-oxygen of the ribose moiety is necessary for full activity of the enzyme, and that the enzyme does not discriminate between purines and pyrimidines (Table 2)."
https://openalex.org/W1999498185,"A nuclear-encoded polypeptide of 6.1 kDa was identified in isolated photosystem II (PSII) reaction center from Spinacia oleracea. The hydrophobic membrane protein easily escapes staining procedures such as Coomassie R-250 or silver staining, but it is clearly detected by immunodecoration with peptide-directed IgG. This additional subunit was found to be present in PSII reaction centers previously known to contain only the D1/D2/cytb559 proteins and the psbI gene product. Furthermore, cross-linking experiments using 1-(3-dimethylaminopropyl-)3-ethylcarbodiimide showed that the nearest neighbors were the D1 and D2 proteins and the cytb559. The 6.1-kDa protein was purified by immune affinity chromatography. N-terminal sequence analysis of the isolated protein confirmed the identity of the 6.1-kDa protein and enabled finding of strong similarities with a randomly obtained cDNA from Arabidopsis thaliana. Using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in combination with thylakoid membrane preparations of different orientation, the N terminus of the protein, predicted to span the membrane once, is suggested to be exposed at the lumen side of the membrane. Consequently the 6.1-kDa protein seems to be the only subunit in the PSII reaction center that is nuclear encoded and has its N terminus on the lumen side of the membrane.

These findings open for new interesting suggestions concerning the properties of photosystem II reaction center with respect to the photosynthetic activity, regulation and assembly in higher plants. Light-induced photosynthetic water oxidation and plastoquinone reduction takes place in the thylakoids of cyanobacteria, algae, and plants. These redox mediated reactions are catalyzed by a multisubunit membrane complex designated as photosystem II(1Debus R. Biochim. Biophys.

This membrane protein complex has been shown to consist of more than 25 different polypeptides with relative molecular masses ranging from 47 down to 3 kDa.

However, based on sequence homology between the L and M subunits of the reaction center complex of purple bacteria and the D1 and D2 protein, the concept of a D1/D2 reaction center heterodimer was proposed also for higher plants(5Rochaix J.-D. Dron M. Rahire M. Malnoe P. Plant Mol. Biol. 1984; 3: 363-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 6Michel H. Deisenhofer J. Staehelin L.A. Arntzen C.J. Encyclopedia of Plant Physiol.Vol. 19.

Indeed, such a PSII reaction center complex consisting of the D1, D2 proteins, cytochrome b559 has been isolated from higher plants (8Nanba O. Satoh K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 109-112Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Barber J. Chapman D.J. Telfer A. FEBS Lett. 1987; 220: 67-73Crossref Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 10Seibert M. Picorel R. Rubin A. Connolly J.S. Plant Physiol. 1988; 87: 303-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). This so-called D1/D2 reaction center heterodimer has now been shown to bind all of the redox components needed for the primary photochemistry of PSII(11Andersson B. Styring S. Lee C.P. Current Topics in Bioenergetics. Vol. 16. Academic press, San Diego1991: 1-81Crossref Google Scholar). Notably all the protein subunits in this complex have been found to be chloroplast encoded. Previously several low molecular mass polypeptides of 10-3 kDa have been identified in various types of photosystem II preparations (12Ljungberg U. Henrysson T. Rochester C.P.H.-E. Andersson B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 849: 112-120Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 13Schröder W.P. Henrysson T. and H.-E. FEBS Lett. 1988; 235: 289-292Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 14Ikeuchi M. Koike H. Inoue Y. FEBS Lett. 1989; 242: 263-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) using polyacrylamide gels of high resolution. Most of them have one hydrophobic stretch predicted to be a transmembrane α-helix. They have been found to be encoded in the chloroplast genome and referred to as psbH-psbN gene products (for a summary see (2Andersson B. Franzen L.-G. Ernster L. Molecular Mechanisms in Bioenergetics. Elsevier Publishers, Amsterdam1992: 121-143Google Scholar)). One, the psbI gene product, has been found to be present in the D1/D2 heterodimer of higher plants(15Ikeuchi M. Inoue Y. FEBS Lett. 1988; 242: 99-104Crossref Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 16Webber A.N. Packman L. Chapman D.J. Barber J. Gray J.C. FEBS Lett. 1989; 242: 259-262Crossref Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The function of these small subunits, as well as the organization within the PSII complex are, however, hitherto unknown. Using mutants from Synechocystis PCC 6803 where the psbH, psbK, or psbJ genes have been deleted, it was recently shown that these subunits were not essential for water oxidation and/or electron transport. Therefore, it was suggested that they could fulfill a regulatory or structural function within PSII (17Ikeuchi M. Eggers B. Shen G. Webber A. Yu J. Hirano A. Inoue Y. Vermaas W.F.J. J. Biol.

The psbL gene product (with an approximately molecular mass of 5 kDa) has been suggested to be involved in stabilizing the QA binding niche(20Nagatsuka T. Fukuhara S. Akabori K. Toyoshima Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1057: 223-231Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Besides these, at least three further nuclear-encoded low molecular mass polypeptides have been suggested to be present or associated with various types of PSII preparations(12Ljungberg U. Henrysson T. Rochester C.P.H.-E. Andersson B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 849: 112-120Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 13Schröder W.P. Henrysson T. and H.-E.

In this paper we report on the identification and isolation of a nuclear-encoded 6.1-kDa polypeptide. It is shown that the 6.1-kDa protein is an additional, previously undetected subunit of the PSII reaction center of higher plants. The molecular mass of the polypeptide was calculated on the basis of the number of amino acids of the homologous protein deduced from the Arabidopsis thaliana gene ((37Höfte H. Desprez T. Amselem J.

Although the purified spinach polypeptide has a molecular mass of 4.6 kDa as estimated from SDS-urea polyacrylamide gels, we prefer to designate it 6.1-kDa polypeptide throughout the manuscript.2 2The calculated molecular mass of the mature protein from spinach deduced from its gene is 5.6 kDa. The polypeptide will be designated psbW gene product (Lorkovic, Z. J., Schröder, W. P., Pakrasi, H. B., Irrgang, K.-D., Herrmann, R. G., and Oelmüller, R. (1995) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A., in press. Thylakoid membranes and PSII membrane fragments were isolated from spinach chloroplasts(21Berthold A.D. Babcock G.T. Yocum C.F. FEBS Lett. 1981; 134: 231-234Crossref Scopus (1651) Google Scholar). PSII membrane fragments contained 220 Chl/reaction center with a Chl a/b (w/w) ratio of 2.0. Oxygen evolving PSII core complexes were either purified after β-N-octyl glucoside solubilization using the procedure described by Ghanotakis and Yocum (22Ghanotakis D. Yocum C.F. FEBS Lett. 1986; 197: 244-248Crossref Scopus (81) Google Scholar) or β-dodecylmaltoside as reported by Haag et al.(23Haag E. Irrgang K.-D. Boekema E.J. Renger G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 189: 47-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). PSII reaction center complexes have been purified from PSII membrane fragments using three different types of protocols: 1) following the method originally described by Nanba et al.(8Nanba O. Satoh K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 109-112Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), 2) a modified procedure reported by Seibert et al.(10Seibert M. Picorel R. Rubin A. Connolly J.S. Plant Physiol. 1988; 87: 303-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), and 3) finally following a technique recently developed by Bóza et al. (24). Light-harvesting complexes of PSII were purified following the method described by Burke et al. (25Burke J.J. Ditto C.L. Arntzen C.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1978; 187: 252-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Inside-out and right-side-out thylakoid membranes were isolated using the aqueous polymer two-phase system (Dextran T-500/polyethylene glycol, Carbowax 3350) as described previously(26Andersson H.-E.B. Albertsson P.-Å. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1976; 449: 525-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 27Andersson B.H.-E. Albertsson P.-Å. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1976; 423: 122-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). To remove excess detergent, the PSII membrane fragments were washed with medium: A, 10 mM MES-NaOH, pH 6.5, 5 mM MgCl2, 15 mM NaCl, 2 mM sucrose. To release extrinsic polypeptides or partly integrated proteins from the thylakoids the following media were used: 1 M NaCl, 10 mM MES-NaOH, pH 6.5; 1 M CaCl2, 10 mM MES-NaOH, pH 6.5; 0.8 M Tris, pH 8.4. The samples were centrifuged and finally resuspended in storage medium (medium A containing 400 mM sucrose). The Chl contents as well as the Chl a/b ratios were determined using the method described by Porra et al.(28Porra R.J. Thompson W.A. Kriedemann P.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 975: 384-394Crossref Scopus (4693) Google Scholar). Polypeptide analyses were either carried out by SDS-urea-PAGE using the buffer system described by Laemmli (29Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207192) Google Scholar) using a resolving gel of 17.5% acrylamide containing 0.1% (w/v) SDS and 4 M urea or using the system developed by Schägger and von Jagow(30Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10478) Google Scholar). Polyacrylamide gels were stained with silver according to Oakley et al.(31Oakley B.R. Kirsch D.R. Morris N.R. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 105: 361-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (2448) Google Scholar). The relative molecular mass of the polypeptide was determined by plotting the log of relative molecular masses as a function of the relative mobilities. Molecular markers were purchased from Pharmacia (low range marker, 16.9-2.5 kDa) or Amersham (Rainbow marker ™). Protein concentrations were measured by Markwell et al.(32Markwell M.A. Haas S.M. Bieber L.L. Tolbert N.E. Anal. Biochem. 1978; 87: 206-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (5331) Google Scholar). N-terminal sequencing of the 6.1-kDa polypeptide was either directly performed from the PVDF membranes using essentially the method described by Matsudeira(33Matsudeira P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10035-10038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The sequence was obtained by Edman degradation and pulse liquid phase sequencing using an Applied Biosystems sequenator (ABS 477A). A polyclonal antiserum was raised in a rabbit against the N-terminal 15 meric oligopeptide (LVDERMSTEGTGLPF) derived from a partial sequence obtained for the mature polypeptide(13Schröder W.P. Henrysson T. and H.-E. FEBS Lett. 1988; 235: 289-292Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 14Ikeuchi M. Koike H. Inoue Y. FEBS Lett. 1989; 242: 263-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The purity of the oligopeptide was tested by reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography using an isocratic gradient of acetonitrile and 0.1% trichloroacetic acid and ion spray mass spectrometry (calculated and measured Mr = 1754). The oligopeptide was coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin by chemical cross-linking using m-maleimidobenzoic acid N-hydroxysuccinimide ester. The immunization was carried out following standard procedures. IgG was purified from the antiserum using protein A-Sepharose chromatography according to standard techniques. Immunoblotting was performed onto PVDF membranes (0.2 εm) according to Towbin et al.(34Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44918) Google Scholar) using a semidry blotting system (Millipore). Immunodecorations were visualized either using the ECL (enhanced chemoluminescence) technique (Amersham) or the alkaline phosphatase system (Bio-Rad). Purified IgG was used in dilutions from 1/500 up to 1/106. ELISA multititer plates were first coated with a variety of different PSII samples (usually 0.5-1 εg Chl for PSII membrane fragments, salt-washed PSII membrane fragments, and O2-evolving PSII core complexes). After that the plates were washed three times with PBS containing 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20 (PBS+). The cavities were blocked with 5% (w/v) skimmed milk in PBS+ for 1 h at 37°C and washed again as described above. The first antibodies were then added and incubated at 4°C overnight. The cavities have been washed as described, horseradish peroxidase coupled to goat-anti-rabbit IgG was added in 5% (w/v) skimmed milk in PBS+ (dilution 1/20,000), and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. The immunodecorations were detected in situ using the ECL method. Approximately 1 mg ml-1 purified IgG has been coupled onto CNBr-activated Sepharose using standard techniques. When using PSII membrane fragments (2 mg/ml Chl) as starting material, they were solubilized in 1% (w/v) β-dodecylmaltoside and 1% (v/v) Triton X-100 for 30 min. Unsolubilized material was sedimented by low speed centrifugation and an aliquot of the supernatant (approximately 1-2 mg protein) loaded onto the immunoaffinity column that was equilibrated in a buffer containing 20 mM MES-NaOH, pH 6.5, 4 mM sucrose, 10 mM NaCl, 10 mM CaCl2, 0.1% (w/v) β-dodecylmaltoside. Subsequently PSII polypeptides have been isocratically eluted by 0.25 M NaCl, 0.5 M NaCl, 0.5 M NaCl, and 0.5% Triton X-100 in the same buffer. The bound 6.1-kDa polypeptide was finally detached from the affinity column by 0.2 M glycine-HCl, pH 2.5, 0.1% (w/v) β-dodecylmaltoside. After elution the fractions were immediately titrated to pH 7.5 with an aliquot of 2 M Tris, pH 9.8. Additionally, O2-evolving PSII core complexes were used as starting material. In this case the PSII core complexes were applied directly on to the column without any presolubilization. The 6.1-kDa protein was separated from the other subunits and detached from the column following the same procedure as described above for PSII membrane fragments. The protein was concentrated by vacuum centrifugation, usually followed by precipitation in precooled acetone at −20°C to remove surplus detergent and salt. The absorption spectrum of the purified polypeptide was recorded at room temperature using a Shimadzu UV 3000 spectrophotometer from 200 to 800 nm (slit width, 1 nm). Cytb559 was determined by difference spectroscopy from the reduced (hydroquinone-reduced for the high potential and Na2S2O4-reduced for total cytb559) minus K3[Fe(CN)6]-oxidized form using an extinction coefficient of 17,500 M-1 cm-1(35Cramer W.A. Whitmarsh J. Ann. Rev. Plant Physiol. 1977; 28: 133-172Crossref Google Scholar). The absorption spectra of the PSII reaction center complexes (solubilized in 25 mM MES-NaOH, pH 6.5, 10 mM CaCl2, 0.025% (w/v) β-dodecylmaltoside) were recorded at room temperature with a Chl concentration of 5 εM using a Beckman DU 64 spectrophotometer. The optical path length was 1 cm and the scan speed 500 nm/min. PSII membrane fragments were cross-linked at constant Chl concentrations of 250 εg/ml in assay medium (50 mM MES-NaOH, pH 6.5, 15 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 400 mM sucrose) on ice for 30 min in the dark using EDC/Chl ratios (w/w) from 1:1 up to 20:1. The samples were centrifuged (12,000 × g, 10 min, 4°C), the supernatants saved for control, and the pellets resuspended in 1 ml of assay medium. The washing procedure was repeated twice under the same conditions, and the pellets were finally resuspended in 250 εl of assay medium. O2-evolving PSII core complexes were cross-linked at a constant Chl concentration of 25 εg/ml using the same EDC/Chl ratios as described above. Cross-linking was performed on ice for 30 min in the dark. The polypeptides were precipitated in precooled acetone at −20°C for 30 min (total volume 1.25 ml). The polypeptides were sedimented for 20 min (12,000 × g), the supernatants discarded, and the pellets prepared for electrophoretic analysis. The 6.1-kDa protein was immunodecorated with known amounts of peptide specific IgG and the immuneresponse was quantified using a densitometer (Molecular Dynamics Densitometer and Image Quant software). The amount of 6.1-kDa protein was calculated at the saturation level of the immuno decoration. The protein was then referred to the number of chlorophyll molecules/PSII reaction center. The following mean values were measured and used for the various PSII preparations; PSII membrane fragments 220 Chl and PSII core complexes 50 Chl. For comparison the same procedure was applied for cytb559. In the case of cytb559, the calculations based on immunotitration experiments were confirmed by difference spectroscopic determination A N-terminal site-specific IgG was used to produce an immunoaffinity column. To purify the protein, PSII core complexes were loaded onto the affinity column. The PSII core complexes were found to bind tightly to the column, indicating that the epitope was surface-exposed in these preparations. The low molecular mass polypeptide was purified by first stepwise isocratically detaching other PSII polypeptides from the column by increasing the NaCl concentration from 10 to 500 mM and adding Triton X-100 to a final concentration of 0.5% (v/v). Finally, the low molecular mass protein was eluted in glycine-containing buffer at low pH. The purification method was highly efficient since almost no protein was lost while detaching other PSII polypeptides from the affinity column. The low molecular mass component was exclusively detected in the glycine-eluted fraction (Fig. 1, lanes 1 and 2). Fractions obtained after each step were routinely probed by SDS-urea-PAGE followed by immunoblotting. Notably, the low molecular mass polypeptide did not stain with Coomassie R-250 and only very weakly with silver stain after prolonged development (Fig. 1, lane 2). In addition, the isolated protein tends to bind high concentrations of lipids and/or detergent that leads to a distorted band after electrophoresis. A focused band, however, was obtained after acetone precipitation of the polypeptide and resolubilizing it in SDS-containing buffer (Fig. 1, lane 2). At room temperature the absorption spectrum of the purified low molecular mass protein had a maximum at λ = 276 ± 1 nm with a shoulder at 280 ± 1 nm (not shown) indicating that no chromophores were associated with the isolated form of the protein. Using immunotitration, the number of 6.1-kDa proteins/PSII reaction center was estimated to be 1-2. N-terminal amino acid sequencing of the isolated protein was performed after SDS-PAGE followed by electroblotting onto PVDF membranes. Nineteen amino acids could be determined (Table 1) supporting and extending preliminary data(13Schröder W.P. Henrysson T. and H.-E. FEBS Lett. 1988; 235: 289-292Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 14Ikeuchi M. Koike H. Inoue Y. FEBS Lett. 1989; 242: 263-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), but also confirming that the site-directed antibody indeed identified the 6.1-kDa protein. A comparison of the obtained N-terminal sequence with those from Triticum aestivum(14Ikeuchi M. Koike H. Inoue Y. FEBS Lett. 1989; 242: 263-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), Chlamydomonas reinhardtii(36de Vitry C. Diner B. Popot J.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16614-16621Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and that deduced from randomly obtained cDNA from A. thaliana(37Höfte H. Desprez T. Amselem J. Chiapello H. Coboche M. Moisan A. Jourjon M.-F. Charpenteau L. Berthomieu P. Guerrier D. Giraudat J. Quigley F. Thomas F. Yu D.-Y. Mache R. Raynal M. Cooke R. Grellet F. Delseny M. Parmentier Y. Marcillac G. Gigot C.

Plant J. 1993; 4: 1051-1061Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar) revealed that the first 10 amino acids were almost identical. With respect to C. reinhardtii(36de Vitry C. Diner B. Popot J.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16614-16621Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) only three deviations were found in: position 7 (S/N), 8 (T/G) and 9 (E/D). The comparison with A. thaliana revealed only one deviation in position 18 (M/S). Interestingly, in position 6 of the purified 6.1-kDa protein a double, equally sized, signal was obtained, suggesting 50% of methionine and glutamine in this position. The significance and reason for this are not clear at the moment.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab In an attempt to localize the low molecular mass protein of 6.1 kDa within PSII, and to gain information on its nearest neighbors, different thylakoid membrane preparations and PSII complexes were investigated by means of immunoscreening. Under denaturing conditions, i.e. after SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting, the 6.1-kDa polypeptide was unambiguously identified in all types of PSII complexes, but not in LHCII preparations. Of particular interest is that the 6.1-kDa protein was found in stoicheiometric amounts in PSII reaction center complexes (see Fig. 2A, lanes 1-7 and Table 2). The purity of the used PSII preparations is shown by a silver-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gel in Fig. 2B and additionally for the PSII reaction center complex by its absorption spectrum (Fig. 2C). The presence of the 6.1-kDa protein in the PSII reaction center complex was also further established by analyzing three different types of preparations (see “Materials and Methods”). All three gave a strong positive immunoreaction with the 6.1-kDa site-directed IgG (only one of these is shown in Fig. 2). The 6.1-kDa protein could neither be removed from the PSII membrane fragments by Tris washing at high pH nor by high salt concentrations indicating that the 6.1-kDa protein is an integral membrane protein component.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab The Western blot analysis clearly shows that the 6.1-kDa protein is present in all PSII samples; however, to obtain information on the topology of the protein it is necessary to preserve it from denaturation. Therefore, we used a more appropriated ELISA technique (Table 2). Again the strongest immunodecoration was observed in PSII reaction center and in the PSII core complexes, meaning that the N-terminal tail of the 6.1-kDa protein was highly surface-exposed in these two preparations (see Table 2). Interestingly, the PSII membrane fragments revealed a rather weak antibody reaction in ELISA. After washing the PSII membrane fragments with NaCl to remove the two extrinsic 23- and 16-kDa proteins, the immunoresponse was also very weak. However, in PSII membrane fragments completely deprived of all three extrinsic proteins (33, 23, and 16 kDa) either by Tris or CaCl2 washing, the epitope was clearly accessible and a strong and distinct immunoresponse was detected. Obviously a removal of the extrinsic 23- and 16-kDa proteins did not expose the N terminus of the 6.1-kDa protein, while an elimination of the extrinsic 33 kDa (psbO) polypeptide did. This indicates that the N terminus of the 6.1-kDa protein would be located somewhere in the vicinity of the 33-kDa protein. However, the O2-evolving PSII core complexes contained the psbO gene product(23Haag E. Irrgang K.-D. Boekema E.J. Renger G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 189: 47-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), and the N terminus of the 6.1-kDa protein was still recognized by the peptide-directed IgG. This could be due to an induced conformational change in the 33-kDa protein binding region or that the 33-kDa protein is partly lost during the preparation or the ELISA procedure. Intact normal thylakoids and right-side-out thylakoids reacted only very weakly with the 6.1-kDa directed antibodies, while inside-out thylakoids showed a very strong reaction (roughly 10 times stronger compared to thylakoids). The much stronger IgG immune response with the inside-out thylakoids suggests that the N terminus of the 6.1-kDa protein is on the lumen side of the membrane. This finding leads us to further investigate the gene recently obtained from A. thaliana(37Höfte H. Desprez T. Amselem J. Chiapello H. Coboche M. Moisan A. Jourjon M.-F. Charpenteau L. Berthomieu P. Guerrier D. Giraudat J. Quigley F. Thomas F. Yu D.-Y. Mache R. Raynal M. Cooke R. Grellet F. Delseny M. Parmentier Y. Marcillac G. Gigot C. Fleck J. Philipps G. Axelos M. Bardet C. Tremousaygue D. Lescure B. Plant J. 1993; 4: 1051-1061Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar), corresponding to the isolated 6.1-kDa protein. An analysis of the presequences of the precursor of the 6.1-kDa protein deduced from A. thaliana turned out to have a predicted length of 79 amino acids. This should be compared to the mature protein that is predicted to consist of only 54 amino acids. The presequence reveals some typical features common with other transit sequences found for lumen polypeptides such as the extrinsic 10-, 16-, 23-, and 33-kDa subunits of photosystem II. Some of the typical features are: it starts with the dipeptide composed of methionine- alanine and has a central part enriched in the hydroxylated amino acids serine and threonine as well as in positively charged amino acids arginine and lysine(38von Hejne G. Steppuhn J. Herrmann R.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 180: 535-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (909) Google Scholar, 39de Boer D. Weisbeek P. Sundqvist C. Ryberg M.

It ends with the consensus sequence tripeptide alanine-X-alanine, where X represents a variable amino acid residue. The mature 6.1-kDa protein deduced from A. thaliana gene (37Höfte H. Desprez T.

https://openalex.org/W2071700773,"Human cytosolic aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 (ALDH1) plays a role in the biosynthesis of retinoic acid that is a modulator for gene expression and cell differentiation. Northern blot analysis showed that liver tissue, pancreas tissue, hepatoma cells, and genital skin fibroblast cells expressed high levels of ALDH1. Sequence analysis showed that the 5’-flanking region contains a number of putative regulatory elements, such as NF-IL6, HNF-5, GATA binding sites, and putative response elements for interleukin-6, phenobarbital and androgen, in addition to a noncanonical TATA box (ATAAA) and a CCAAT box. Functional characterization of the 5’-regulatory region of the human ALDH1 gene was carried out by a fusion to the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene. A construct containing 2.6 kilobase pairs of the 5’-flanking region was efficiently expressed in hepatoma Hep3B cells, but not in erythroleukemic K562 cells or in fibroblast LTK− cells, which do not express ALDH1. Within this region, we define a minimal promoter (−91 to +53) that contains positive regulatory elements. The study using site-directed mutagenesis demonstrated that the CCAAT box region is the major cis-acting element involved in basal ALDH1 promoter activity in Hep3B cells. Gel mobility shift assays showed that NF-Y and other octamer factors bound CCAAT box and an octamer motif sequence, but not GATA site existing in the minimal promoter region. Two additional DNA binding activities associated with the minimal promoter were found in the nuclear extract from Hep3B cells, but not from K562 cells.

Aldehyde dehydrogenases (aldehyde:NAD+ oxidoreductase, EC 1.2.1.3, ALDH) 1The abbreviations used are: ALDHaldehyde dehydrogenasePCRpolymerase chain reactionCATchloramphenicol acetyltransferasebpbase pair(s). 1 play a role in the detoxification of alcohol-derived acetaldehyde and the metabolism of corticosteroids, biogenic amines, and lipid peroxidation (reviewed in (1Yoshida A. Hsu L.C. Yasunami M. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1991; 40: 255-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar)). Many human ALDH isozymes are distinguishable on the basis of separation by physicochemical methods, tissue and subcellular distributions, and enzymatic properties(1Yoshida A. Hsu L.C. Yasunami M. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1991; 40: 255-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Cytosolic ALDH1 is active for retinalaldehyde oxidation and is considered to play a major role in the synthesis of retinoic acid(2Yoshida A. Hsu L.C. Davé V. Enzyme (Basel). 1992; 46: 239-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), which is a potent modulator for gene expression and cell differentiation (reviewed in (3DeLuca L.M. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 2924-2933Crossref PubMed Scopus (816) Google Scholar)). The characterization of human ALDH1 cDNA and gene has shown that this gene spans 53 kilobase pairs, and contains 13 exons, which encode 501 amino acid residues including the chain initiation Met(4Hsu L.C.

Human ALDH1 isozyme is expressed at different levels in various tissues examined, with the highest level in the liver and the lowest or undetectable level in the heart(8Harada S. Agarwal D.P. Goedde H.W. Life Sci. 1980; 26: 1773-1780Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), suggesting that the expression of ALDH1 is tissue-specific. During embryonic development, ALDH1 is detectable at an early stage(9Yoshida A. Shibuya A. Davé V. Nakayama M. Hayashi A. Experientia (Basel). 1990; 46: 747-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). The position- and developmental stage-specific expression of ALDH1 were observed in the mouse and chick retina, suggesting that the level of ALDH1 is correlated with the biosynthesis of retinoic acid(10Godbout R. Exp. Eye Res. 1992; 54: 297-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 11McCaffery P. Posch K.C. Napoli J.L. Gudas L. Drager U.C. Dev. Biol. 1993; 158: 390-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). However, little is known regarding the molecular mechanism of the tissue and developmental stage-specific expression of the ALDH1 gene. Recent studies indicated that human ALDH1 was produced in the normal genital skin fibroblast cells but not in the cells obtained from X-linked androgen receptor-negative testicular feminization patients(12Pereira F. Rosenmann E. Nylen E. Kaufman M. Pinsky L. Wrogemann K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 175: 831-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 13Yoshida A. Hsu L.C. Yanagawa Y. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1993; 328: 37-44Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These findings suggest that ALDH1 is induced by androgen receptor-androgen complex in genital cells, and retinoic acid produced by ALDH1 plays an important role in testicular differentiation(13Yoshida A. Hsu L.C. Yanagawa Y. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1993; 328: 37-44Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). ALDH1 expression is modulated by phenobarbital and cyclophosphamide. Phenobarbital induces ALDH1 activity in cultured human hepatoma cells (14Marselos M. Strom S.C. Michalopoulus G. Chem. Biol. Int. 1987; 62: 75-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) and in the liver of some rat strains(15Dunn T.J. Koleske A.J. Lindahl R. Pitot H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13057-13065Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Transcriptional activation of ALDH1 was observed in cyclophosphamide-resistant human carcinoma cells (16Yoshida A. Davé V. Han H. Scalon K.J. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1993; 328: 63-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and mouse leukemic cell line L121O(17Radin A.I. Zhoa X.-L. Woo T.H. Colvin O.M. Hilton J. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1991; 42: 1933-1939Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). To elucidate the regulatory mechanisms of ALDH1 expression and to define the promoter regions that are essential for its tissue-specific and inducible expression, we have characterized the 5’-flanking region of the human ALDH1 gene. Total cellular RNAs were prepared from various cultured cell lines by the established method(18Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar). Twenty micrograms of total RNAs were electrophoresed, transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane, and hybridized with a human ALDH1 cDNA probe (4Hsu L.C. Tani K. Fujiyoshi T. Kurachi K. Yoshida A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 3771-3775Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) and with a human β-actin cDNA probe, which served as an internal reference. A low background promoterless CAT expression vector, PUMSVOCAT, with an unique SmaI cloning site(19Salier J.P. Hirosawa S. Kurachi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7062-7068Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the genomic clone (λDASH-19) of human ALDH1 gene containing the extended 5’-region (5Hsu L.C. Chang W.-C. Yoshida A. Genomics. 1989; 5: 857-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) were used for preparation of the expression constructs. Using an EcoRI/EcoRI fragment −673/+350 of the clone as a template, a fragment −673/+53 with artificial HindIII site at the 5’ end and XbaI site at the 3’ end was created by PCR, and subcloned into pBluescript II KS+. The ligation of the HindIII/EcoRI fragment −2536/-673 with the −673/+53 fragment yielded the 5’ region of ALDH1 gene covering −2536/+53. A fragment from −1736 (PvuII site) to −673 (EcoRI site) generated from the clone −2536/+53 was ligated to a fragment −673/+53 described above. Two fragments, i.e. −266/+53 and −149/+53, were obtained from the −673/+53 clone by PvuII and DraI digestion respectively. The truncated fragments from −120, −91 and −50 to +53 were obtained by PCR using the −673/+53 fragment as a template. The nucleotide sequences of these truncated clones were confirmed by sequencing. pUMSVOCAT vector was digested by SmaI, tailed with dideoxythymidine triphosphate and ligated with a PCR product (−673/+53) which has a HindIII site at the 5’ and XbaI site at the 3’ end. Digestion of this product by HindIII and XbaI yielded CAT-assay constructs with a series of deleted ALDH1 promoter region. The fragments −2536/+53, −1726/+53, −673/+53, −266/+53, −149/+53, −120/+53, −91/+53 and −50/+53 were subcloned into the HindIII/XbaI site of pUMSVOCAT vector. These products are designated as pCAT-2536, pCAT-1726, pCAT-673, pCAT-266, pCAT-149, pCAT-120, pCAT-91, and pCAT-50, respectively. The SV40 promoter region prepared from pCAT-promoter vector (Promega) ligated with pUMSVOCAT, and the resultant pCAT-SV40 vector was used as an internal reference for CAT-assay. The deleted vectors, i.e. pCAT-120ΔC and pCAT120ΔA containing the deletion of CCAAT box (−74/-70) and the deletion of ATAAA box (−32/-28), respectively, were generated by a two-step PCR directed mutagenesis by the following procedures. First, a fragment −673/-60 was prepared using −673/-655 as 5’ primer and 5’-CTCGGATACGATGAACAAACTCAG-3’ as 3’ primer, and a fragment −84/+53 was prepared using 5’-GTTTGTTCATCGTATCCGAGTATG-3’ as 5’ primer and +53/+36 as 3’ primer. Subsequently these two fragments were mixed and used for another round of PCR in the presence of −120/-103 as 5’ primer and +53/+36 as 3’ primer. The final PCR product was subcloned into pBluescript vector, and the internal deletion was confirmed by sequencing. pCAT-120ΔA was constructed by the same procedure except for using −673/-655 and 5’-TTGTTCCTTTCTGCACGGGCTAAA-3’ as primers for amplification of −673/-12, and 5’-GCCCGTGCAGAAAGGAACAAATAAAG-3’ and +53/+36 as primers for amplification of −43/+53. All cell lines were obtained from American Type Culture Collection. Human non-genital fibroblast cells (GM8447) were cultured in minimal essential medium under 5% CO2. Human genital skin fibroblast cells(9024), human hepatoma cells (HepG2 and Hep3B), human breast cancer cells (MCF-7), and mouse fibroblast cells (LTK−) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium under 5% CO2. Human prostate cancer cells (LNCaP), human erythroleukemic cells (K562), and human promyelocytic leukemia cells (HL60) were grown in RPMI 1640 under 5% CO2. All media were supplemented with penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 εg/ml), and 10% fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.). Human hepatoma Hep3B cells and mouse fibroblast cells LTK− were transfected by the use of Lipofectin (Life Technologies, Inc.), and human erythroleukemic cells (K562) were transfected by the use of Transfectam (Promega). The cells were cotransfected with 10 εg of the test plasmid and 2 εg of pCMVβgal control plasmid. After 48 h, the treated cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and harvested from the plate by scraping. The cells were then pelleted by centrifugation, resuspended in 0.25 M Tris chloride (pH 8.O), and disintegrated by freezing/thawing four times. Aliquots of the centrifuge supernatant of the lysate were used for assay of β-galactosidase activity(20Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Gene Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The remainder of the supernatant was heated to 60°C for 10 min to inactivate deacetylase and stored at −70°C prior to determination of CAT activity. CAT assays were performed by the phase-extraction method (21Seed B. Sheen J.-Y. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 67: 271-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar) using [14C]chloramphenicol as substrate. The CAT activity was normalized to β-galactosidase activity and expressed as -fold increase in activity over that of the simian virus 40 (SV40) early promoter. Nuclear extracts prepared by the method of Shapiro et al.(22Shapiro D.J. Sharp P.A. Wahli W.W. Keller M.J. DNA. 1988; 7: 47-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar) were preincubated in a 20-εl reaction mixture containing 20 mM HEPES (pH 7.9), 0.5 mM dithiothreitol, 0.5 mM EDTA, 7% glycerol, 1 εg of poly(dI-dC), 25 mM KCl, and 25 mM NaCl at 25°C. After 10 min, approximately 2 × 104 cpm of a 32P-end-labeled nucleotide probe was added and the incubation continued for 20 min. The mixtures, together with 2 εl of loading buffer (50% glycerol, 1 mM EDTA, 0.25% xylene cyanole, and 0.25% bromphenol blue), were electrophoresed in a 4% polyacrylamide gel in 0.5 × TBE buffer (45 mM Tris borate, pH 8.4, 0.1 mM EDTA). In competition assays, a large excess of unlabeled double-strand oligonucleotide competitor was incubated together with the nuclear extract prior to adding the 32P-labeled probe. For supershift assay, anti-NF-YB antibody (23Mantovani R. Pessara U. Tronche F. Li X.-Y. Knapp A.-M. Pasquali J.-L. Benoist C. Mathis D.

Northern blot analysis demonstrated that ALDH1 mRNA is abundant in human genital skin fibroblast cells(9024) and in hepatoma cells (HepG2 and Hep3B). ALDH1 mRNA is undetectable in non-genital skin fibroblast cells (GM8447 and LTK−) and in other cancer cell lines examined (MCF-7, LNCaP, K562, and HL60) (Fig. 1). The β-actin gene is expressed at comparable levels in all cell types. In a variety of human tissues examined, ALDH1 gene is expressed highly in liver and pancreas, moderately in skeletal muscle and kidney, at low levels in brain, heart, and lung, and is undetectable in placenta (data not shown). Two overlapping clones for the 5’-region of the gene were obtained by screening human genomic libraries. The nucleotide sequence of the region (starting −2536 counting from the transcription start site numbered +1) is shown in Fig. 2. In comparison with the reported sequence from −676 to exon 1(5Hsu L.C. Chang W.-C. Yoshida A. Genomics. 1989; 5: 857-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), the present sequence displays a T/G transversion at −396 and a C/T transition at −100. The sequence of the entire 5’-flanking region was scanned on both strands for the search of potential protein binding motifs. Based on the published libraries of such motifs(28Faisst S. Meyer S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 2-26Crossref Scopus (938) Google Scholar), a noncanonical TATA box exists at −32, and a potential CCAAT box exists at −74. A series of potential NF-IL6-responsive elements are scattered through the entire sequence. Several other potential liver-specific sequences also exist in the region (Fig. 2). In an attempt to delineate the DNA elements that are important for the activity of the ALDH1 promoter, the 5’-sequences of the human, marmoset (sequenced in this laboratory), mouse(29Rongnoparut P. Weaver S. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 101: 261-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), and rat (15Dunn T.J. Koleske A.J. Lindahl R. Pitot H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13057-13065Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) ALDH1 genes are compared (Fig. 3). The sequence of the human ALDH1 proximal promoter region is very similar to that of marmoset, rat, and mouse. Within the upstream 100-bp region from the transcription start site, a 10-bp deletion (−14/-5) exists in the mouse and rat genes, and a 13-bp deletion (−53/-41) exists in the rat gene. However, CCAAT and ATAAA boxes are well conserved in all species. An octamer binding site is also conserved in the promoter regions of human, marmoset, and mouse genes, suggesting the functional importance of these elements for the transcriptional regulation of the ALDH1 gene. The role of the 5’ promoter region in cell type-dependent expression of the ALDH1 gene was examined by expressing CAT constructs containing progressive deletions of the 2536-bp fragments (Fig. 4). In hepatoma (Hep3B) cells, which constitutively expressed ALDH1, the CAT activity with the vector carrying −2536/+53 (pCAT-2536) was 32-fold higher than that of the cells transfected with the promoter less pUMSVOCAT vector (Fig. 5). By contrast, the expression of pCAT-2536 was similar to that of pUMSVOCAT in fibroblast LTK− cells and erythroleukemic K-562 cells, which did not express ALDH1. The cell type-specific activity of the ALDH1 promoter was further evidenced by comparison of the CAT activity yielded by the ALDH1 promoter and that by the SV40 early promoter in different cell lines. The relative activity of the ALDH1 promoter (measured using pCAT-SV40 as reference) was found to be 61.2 in Hep3B, 2.9 in LTK−, and 7.7 in K562 cells, implying that pCAT-2536 stimulates transcription 21 and 8 times more efficiently in Hep3B than LTK− and K562 cells, respectively (Fig. 5). These results indicate that the 5’-flanking region can direct the cell type-specific expression. The progressive removal of the 5’-sequences from −2536 to −673 resulted in augmented promoter activities, suggesting that the 5’-flanking region (−2536/-673) of the ALDH1 gene may contain mild negative elements. Further stepwise deletions of the sequences from −673 to −91 did not significantly affect the reporter gene expression. However, a drastic decrease of CAT activity occurred by deletion from −91 to −50. The CAT activity of the deletion construct pCAT-50 was about 8-fold higher than that of the promoterless plasmid pUMSVOCAT. These results suggest that at least two positive cis-acting regulatory elements exist in the region between −91 to +53. In Hep3B cells, the region from −93/+53, containing ATAAA and CCAAT boxes, functions as a promoter with activity similar to or even greater than the SV40 promoter (Fig. 5). The 5’-flanking region also stimulated the CAT expression in other cell lines. However, in comparison with that in Hep3B cells, the degree of stimulation is very low in these cells, which do not express the ALDH1 (Fig. 5). The construct containing the proximal promoter (pCAT-91) exhibited the CAT activity 65-fold of that of the promoterless pUMSVOCAT in Hep3B cells, but only 6-fold in LTK−, and 7-fold in K562 cells (Fig. 5). These results indicate that the promoter element (−91/+53) directs the cell type-specific expression of the ALDH1 gene. In order to identify the positive regulatory elements within the proximal promoter region (−120/+53), the basal promoter activity of the internal deletion mutants was examined. Deletion from −74 to −70 of the CCAAT box (pCAT-120ΔC) resulted in a 12.5-fold decrease of the CAT activity compared to that expressed by the undeleted pCAT-120, indicating that the binding of a nuclear factor(s) to the CCAAT box is essential for the basal promoter activity in Hep3B cells (Fig. 6). On the other hand, deletion from −32 to −28 of the ATAAA box (pCAT-120ΔA) did not significantly affect the CAT activity, suggesting that the ATAAA box is not a primary regulatory element in Hep3B cells. Gel retardation analysis showed that unlabeled NF-Y, a well characterized human albumin promoter(24Urano Y. Watanabe K. Sasaki M. Tamaoki T. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 3244-3251Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but not CTF/NFI and Sp1 sequences, competed with labeled Oligo I (Fig. 7A, lanes 3-14). Similarly, unlabeled Oligo I but not CTF/NFI and Sp1 oligonucleotides, prevented the binding of the labeled NF-Y to the Hep3B nuclear protein (data not shown). Furthermore, the antibody specific to NF-YB protein, a member of NF-Y transcription factors(23Mantovani R. Pessara U. Tronche F. Li X.-Y. Knapp A.-M. Pasquali J.-L. Benoist C. Mathis D. EMBO J. 1993; 11: 3315-3322Crossref Scopus (165) Google Scholar), disturbed the formation of Oligo I-nuclear factor complex (Fig. 8A, bandNB). These results indicate that the nuclear factor interacting with the CCAAT box region is identical to the nuclear factor NF-Y.Figure 8:Antibody recognition of NF-Y and octamer-binding proteins.

The supershift band is indicated by S.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The consensus octamer sequence, ATGCAAT, exists adjacent to the CCAAT box in the ALDH1 promoter (Fig. 2). When Oligo II (−68/-41) was incubated with the nuclear extracts from a slow moving complex, OB1 was observed in the presence of the Hep3B extract, whereas two complexes, OB1 and OB2, were detected in the presence of the K562 extract (Fig. 7B, lanes2 and 9). The unlabeled Oligo II and Oct oligonucleotides abolished the formation of the labeled OB1 and OB2 complexes (Fig. 7B, lanes 3-6 and 11-13). The Sp1 oligonucleotide did not affect the formation of OB1 and OB2 complexes (Fig. 7B, lanes 7, 8, 14, and 15). Similarly, Oligo II and Oct oligonucleotides, but not Sp1, prevented the binding of the labeled Oct oligonucleotide to the nuclear extracts from Hep3B or K562 (data not shown). The formation of OB1 complex was inhibited by the anti-Oct-1 antibody, and a supershift band was produced in the gel retardation analysis (Fig. 8B, lanes2 and 6). The formation of OB2 complex was not disturbed by the anti-Oct-1 antibody and anti-Oct-2 antibody (Fig. 8B, lanes 6-8). From these results, one can conclude that the nuclear protein producing the slow moving OB1 is Oct-1, ubiquitously expressed in various cells (30Scholer H.R. Trends Genet. 1991; 7: 323-329Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar) and that the second complex, OB2, is produced by another octamer factor, tentatively designated as Oct-X, existing in K562 cells but not in Hep 3B cells. Cooperative binding of these factors to the ALDH1 promoter was examined by the mobility shift analysis using several nucleotide fragments shown in Fig. 9. Four complexes (A, B, C, and D) were produced by incubating Frag I (−91/-1) with the Hep3B nuclear extract (Fig. 10). Competitive binding assay using Oligos I, II, III, and IV revealed that complex B is related to both Oligo I (i.e. NF-Y binding site) and Oligo II (i.e. octamer binding site) (Fig. 10, lanes4 and 5). Oligo I strongly interfered with the formation of complex D, but not complex C, whereas Oligo II disturbed the formation of complex C, but not complex D (Fig. 10, lanes3 and 4). Oligos III and IV and Sp1 did not compete with Frag I in the formation of complexes A, B, C, and D. The results suggest that complex C results from the binding of the octamer factor to the probe, while complex D is a product of NF-Y and the probe. Complex B consists of the probe to which both NF-Y and octamer factors have bound.Figure 10:Binding of nuclear factors at the minimal promoter element (−91 to −1) with Hep3B nuclear extract. A Frag I (region −91 to −1) was labeled and used in a gel mobility shift assay. Lane 1, control without Hep3B nuclear extract; lanes 2-8, with Hep3B nuclear extract. The following lanes were obtained in the presence of unlabeled competitive oligonucleotides; lane3, 50-fold excess of Frag I; lane4, 500-fold excess of Oligo I; lane5, 500-fold excess of Oligo II; lane6, 500-fold excess of Oligo III; lane7, 500-fold excess of Oligo IV; lane8, 500-fold excess of Sp1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The formation of complex A was abolished by self-competitor, Frag I, and an excess of a truncated oligonucleotide Frag II, but not other oligonucleotides. Complex A was not detectable using K565 nuclear extracts (data not shown). These results indicate that the protein involved in the formation of complex A is cell type-specific and reacts to the region −50 to −1 of the ALDH1 promoter. In order to further elucidate the hepatocyte-specific transcription factor(s), the labeled nucleotide region −50/+53 was incubated with the nuclear extracts from Hep3B or K562 cells and subjected to the mobility shift analysis. Complex L1 was produced by the Hep3B extract but not by the K562 extract (Fig. 11A). The unlabeled Frag I, Frag II, and Frag III abolished the formation of complex L1 (Fig. 10A, lanes 3-5), suggesting that the region −50/-1 bind to the hepatocyte-specific transcription factor(s). However, Oligo III, Oligo IV, and Sp1 did not strongly interfere with the formation of L1 complex (Fig. 10A, lanes6, 7, and 9). To find out a possible involvement of GATA site in the formation of L1, Frag II with altered GATA site (−34/-29, AGATAA → ACCGAA) was used for the gel shift assay. The mutated Frag II abolished the formation of L1 complex (data not shown), suggesting that GATA binding site may not be important for the formation. Interestingly, the unlabeled Oligo V (−14/+20), reduced the formation of complex L1 (Fig. 11A, lane8), suggesting the presence of two binding factors, one for the sequence from −51 to −1, and the other for the sequence from −14 to +20. To confirm this possibility, labeled Oligo V (−14/+20) was used for the mobility shift analysis. When Oligo V was incubated with the Hep3B nuclear extract, a unique complex, L2, was produced (Fig. 11B). Complex L2 was not produced by the K562 nuclear extract. The hepatocyte-specific nuclear factors involved in formation of complexes L1 and L2 are designated as L1F and L2F, respectively. Northern blot analysis indicated that the level of ALDH1 in various types of cells is regulated at the transcriptional level (Fig. 1). Sequence analysis revealed that the extended 5’-region (−2539 to transcription start site) contains various putative regulatory elements (Fig. 2). The putative binding sites for transcription factors such as liver-specific HNF-5 and NF-IL6, muscle-specific MCBF, and hematopoietic cell-specific GATA and Est-1 may be involved in tissue- and cell type-specific expression of ALDH1. Although human ALDH1 is constitutively expressed at a high level in the liver, it is also inducible by phenobarbital in human hepatic cells and the liver of some rat strains(14Marselos M. Strom S.C. Michalopoulus G. Chem. Biol. Int. 1987; 62: 75-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 15Dunn T.J. Koleske A.J. Lindahl R. Pitot H.C. J. Biol.

DNA Cell Biol. 1990; 9: 37-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). A similar sequence (77% homology) exists in human AHLD1 (Fig. 2). Human ALDH1 is expressed in genital skin fibroblast cells from normal subjects, but not in the cells obtained from androgen receptor-negative testicular feminization patients(12Pereira F. Rosenmann E. Nylen E. Kaufman M. Pinsky L. Wrogemann K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 175: 831-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 13Yoshida A. Hsu L.C. Yanagawa Y. Adv. Exp. Med.

Two putative androgen-responsive elements exist at positions −688/-674 and −322/-306, suggesting the possibility of androgen-dependent regulation of the ALDH1 expression in genital skin cells. It has been suggested that NF-IL6 element and HAPE-1 element are cooperatively involved in the expression of several acute phase genes (36Majello B. Arcone R. Toniatti C. Ciliberto G. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 457-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). These two elements are closely located in the 5’-region from −2200 to −2182 of ALDH1. It is of interest to examine whether or not the two elements are involved in modulation of ALDH1 expression by interleukin-6 cytokine. The present functional studies of the promoter region revealed several regulatory elements and nuclear proteins involved in the cell type-specific expression of ALDH1. The deletion analysis demonstrated that two elements, one between −91 and −51, and the other between −50 and +53, drive the CAT expression in Hep3B cells. Deletion of CCAAT sequence (−74/-70), but not deletion of ATAAA sequence (−32/-28), decreased the promoter activity (Fig. 6). Therefore, CCAAT box-binding protein is critical for promoter activity in Hep3B cells. Previous studies showed that mutations of CCAAT sequence in the albumin and major histocompatibility class II promoters could result in decrease of promoter activity(37Herbowel P. Rollier A. Tronche F. Ott M.-O. Yaniv M. Weiss M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 4750-4758Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 38Sherman P.A. Basta P.V. Moore T.L. Brown A.M. Ting J.P.-Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 50-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In contrast with other mammalian species, ALDH1 is hardly expressed in the liver without an inducer in various rat strains, including Long-Evans(15Dunn T.J. Koleske A.J. Lindahl R. Pitot H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13057-13065Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A part of the octamer motif and adjacent sequences (13 bp) are deleted in rat Long-Evans strain (Fig. 3) and in other common rat strains, 2Y. Yanagawa, J. C. Chen, L. C. Hsu, and A. Yoshida, unpublished observation. 2 indicating the importance of this region for constitutive expression of ALDH1 in the liver. Although multiple factors existing in Hep3B cells, such as C/EBP, CTF/NF1, and NF-Y, could interact with CCAAT motif(39McKnight S. Tjian R. Cell. 1986; 46: 795-805Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar, 40Landschultz W. Johnson P.F. Adashi F.Y. Graves B.J. McKnight S.

EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3119-3127Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar), the mobility shift assay strongly supports NF-Y as the primary factor interacting with the CCAAT region (Figure 8:, Figure 9:, Figure 10:). Moreover, the octamer region adjacent to the CCAAT box binds to nuclear proteins. Interestingly, only an ubiquitous transcription factor, Oct-1, was found in Hep3B nuclear extracts, while another octamer binding factor, termed Oct-X, was detected in K562 nuclear extracts in addition to Oct-1. It was reported that neuronal Oct-2 does not activate reporter constructs containing an octamer motif, but it could interfere with the activation of such constructs by Oct-1(43Dent C.L. Lillycrop K.A. Estridge J.K. Thomas N.S.B. Latchman D.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3925-3930Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). It is conceivable that Oct-X, like Oct-2, is an inhibiting factor, competing with Oct-1 at the octamer binding site of ALDH1 in K562 cells. Both NF-Y and octamer factor(s) appeared to bind with the promoter region (−91/-1, Frag I), producing a complex B (Fig. 10). Synergy between NF-Y motif and an adjacent C/EBP site was observed in the expression of albumin gene(44Milos P.M. Zaret K.S. Genes & Dev. 1992; 6: 991-1004Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), between Oct-1 and glucocorticoid receptor in activation of the mouse mammary tumor virus promoter (45Bruggemeier U. Kalff M. Franke S. Scheidereit C. Beato M. Cell. 1991; 64: 565-572Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) and between Oct-1 and SP-1 in activation of U2 small nuclear RNA gene (46Janson L. Pettersson U. Pro. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4732-4736Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). A similar synergism may exist between NF-1 and Oct-1 motifs in ALDH1 expression. CAT assay indicates that the ALDH1 promoter region −91/-50 is functionally active not only in Hep3B cells but also in LTK− and in K562 cells (Fig. 5). However, judging from the fact that the stimulation is much higher (2 orders of magnitude) in Hep3B cells compared with LTK− and K562 cells, the promoter region −91/-50 is essential but is not sufficient to direct the hepatocyte-specific expression of ALDH1. The mobility shift analysis demonstrated the existence of two unique nuclear proteins (L1F and L2F) producing L1 and L2 complexes, in Hep3B cells but not in K562 cells (Fig. 11). Competitive mobility shift studies indicated that L1F binding was only partially suppressed by Oligo V, which completely abolished L2F binding. The two nuclear proteins, L1F and L2F, might belong to the same family of transcription factors and play a major role in the high level expression of ALDH1 in Hep3B cells. Alternatively, the cell type-specific expression could be due to the presence of different NF-Y related proteins or octamer factors in different cell types(47Tafuri S. Wolffe A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9028-9032Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). It is also conceivable that the concentration and ratio of ubiquitous transcription factors in particular cell types affect the gene expression(48Diamond M.I. Miner J.N. Yoshinaga S.K. Yamamoto E.R. Science. 1990; 249: 1266-1272Crossref PubMed Scopus (1070) Google Scholar, 49Liu Y.H. Yang N.Y. Teng C.T. Mol. Cell.

Biol. 1992; 12: 1708-1718Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Based on the present structural and functional analysis, the following possible molecular mechanism can be proposed for the cell type-specific expression of ALDH1 gene. In ALDH1-positive Hep3B cells, the factors involved in the ALDH1 expression are NF-Y and Oct-1 binding to the promoter region −91/-50, and L1F and L2F acting on the promoter region −50/+20. In ALDH1-negative K562 cells, NF-Y, Oct-1, and Oct-X act on the promoter region −91/-50, but L1F and L2F factors are missing and thus ALDH1 cannot be strongly expressed in the cells. Oct-X might interfere with the binding of Oct −1 to the octamer sequence and suppress the promoter activity in K562 cells. The molecular mechanism of the androgen-receptor mediated expression of ALDH1 remains to be elucidated. We thank Dr. K. Kurachi for providing us with the CAT vector and Dr. D. Mathis for the anti-NF-Y antibody. We are also grateful to Vibha Davé for assistance and to Dr. S. Tamura for encouragement."
https://openalex.org/W1994401050,"cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) participates in both constitutive and cAMP-induced transcription of cAMP-responsive genes. CREB-mediated constitutive transcription requires only CREB-binding sites and a minimal promoter region (containing the TATA through start sequences), indicating that CREB interacts directly with components of the general transcription machinery. In this study, a coimmunoprecipitation assay was used to test for interaction of CREB with the general transcription factors (TF) TFIIB and TFIID and the core component of TFIID, TATA-binding protein (TBP). Human TFIIB and TBP, tagged with distinct epitopes (eTFIIB and eTBP), were expressed in and purified from <i>Escherichia coli</i>, and holo-eTFIID, containing eTBP, was obtained from the HeLa cell line LTRα3. <sup>35</sup>S-Labeled CREB, synthesized <i>in vitro</i> and incubated with eTFIIB, was coimmunoprecipitated with antibody recognizing eTFIIB, indicating that CREB specifically binds to TFIIB. <sup>35</sup>S-CREB was coimmunoprecipitated with antibody against eTBP, but only when incubated with the holo-eTFIID complex, not with eTBP alone. TFIIB interacted with TBP, but CREB was not coprecipitated with the eTBP antibody when incubated with eTBP plus TFIIB, so CREB did not form a stable ternary complex with TFIIB and TBP. Conversely, depletion of TFIIB from the holo-TFIID preparation did not diminish the level of interaction between CREB and TFIID. Thus, CREB interacts independently with TFIIB and TFIID, but not directly with TBP. A protein kinase A phosphorylation site mutant of CREB and wild-type CREB exhibited equivalent interaction with TFIIB, indicating that this phosphorylation is not required. Consistent with the role of CREB in promoting constitutive or basal transcription, the constitutive activation domain of CREB was sufficient for interaction with both TFIIB and TFIID."
https://openalex.org/W2055138438,"Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) immunoreactivity is consistently present in the senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles of Alzheimer's disease (AD) brain. In vitro, apoE, and in particular its apoE4 isoform, can bind to and promote fibrillogenesis of the amyloid Aβ peptide, the main constituent of senile plaques. These findings, together with the strong genetic association between late onset AD and the E4 allele of apoE, have strengthened the hypothesis that apoE may have a central role in the pathogenesis of AD by modulating Aβ cerebral accumulation. However, apoE immunoreactivity is present in all cerebral and systemic amyloidoses tested, and tryptic apoE fragments have been identified in association with amyloid A (AA). In order to further elucidate the interaction between apoE and amyloids, we purified AA and amyloid L (AL) fibrils from patients with familial Mediterranean fever and primary amyloidosis, respectively, and studied the association of apoE with AA and AL proteins. In each case, apoE fragments, detected by Western blot, co-purified with the amyloid fibrils. Microsequencing analysis identified COOH-terminal fragments of apoE, similar to the 10-kDa fragment produced by thrombin digestion that contains the purported binding region to Aβ. In vitro co-incubation of AA with purified human apoE resulted in the formation of an SDS-resistant AA♦apoE complex and a higher degree of polymerization of the AA peptide. These findings and similar results obtained from AD senile plaques suggest that 1) the carboxyl-terminal fragment of apoE is complexed to amyloid fibrils and resists proteolysis in vivo and 2) apoE may promote amyloidogenesis through a conformation-dependent interaction regardless of the primary structure of the amyloid precursors. Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) immunoreactivity is consistently present in the senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles of Alzheimer's disease (AD) brain. In vitro, apoE, and in particular its apoE4 isoform, can bind to and promote fibrillogenesis of the amyloid Aβ peptide, the main constituent of senile plaques. These findings, together with the strong genetic association between late onset AD and the E4 allele of apoE, have strengthened the hypothesis that apoE may have a central role in the pathogenesis of AD by modulating Aβ cerebral accumulation. However, apoE immunoreactivity is present in all cerebral and systemic amyloidoses tested, and tryptic apoE fragments have been identified in association with amyloid A (AA). In order to further elucidate the interaction between apoE and amyloids, we purified AA and amyloid L (AL) fibrils from patients with familial Mediterranean fever and primary amyloidosis, respectively, and studied the association of apoE with AA and AL proteins. In each case, apoE fragments, detected by Western blot, co-purified with the amyloid fibrils. Microsequencing analysis identified COOH-terminal fragments of apoE, similar to the 10-kDa fragment produced by thrombin digestion that contains the purported binding region to Aβ. In vitro co-incubation of AA with purified human apoE resulted in the formation of an SDS-resistant AA♦apoE complex and a higher degree of polymerization of the AA peptide. These findings and similar results obtained from AD senile plaques suggest that 1) the carboxyl-terminal fragment of apoE is complexed to amyloid fibrils and resists proteolysis in vivo and 2) apoE may promote amyloidogenesis through a conformation-dependent interaction regardless of the primary structure of the amyloid precursors. Amyloidosis is a disorder of protein conformation in which low molecular weight proteins that are soluble under physiological conditions become deposited and accumulate either intact or partially digested in diverse tissues and organs as insoluble amyloid fibrils. In spite of their biochemical diversity, amyloid proteins adopt a common secondary structure, the β-pleated sheet, and form fibrils of similar morphology. These fibrils are characteristically long straight filaments 5-12 nm wide that share the tinctorial properties of green birefringence after Congo red staining and specific affinity for fluorescent dyes such as Thioflavine S or T. In addition to these features shared by most types of amyloids, there are several factors consistently associated with this pathological condition that can be viewed as part of the biochemical setting in which amyloid deposition arises and develops. These include elevated concentration of amyloid precursors in fluids and tissues and the invariable presence of certain amyloid-associated proteins of which amyloid P-component (AP)1 1The abbreviations used are: APamyloid P-componentHPLChigh performance liquid chromatographyALamyloid LSAAserum amyloid A precursorAAamyloid AADAlzheimer's diseaseCAPS3-(cyclohexylamino)propanesulfonic acidBSAbovine serum albuminPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.

Moreover, in vitro binding experiments using human apoE isolated from plasma or recombinant human apoE with synthetic peptides homologous to Aβ have shown that these two proteins can form an SDS-resistant complex with Aβ and promote Aβ fibril formation in vitro(21Strittmatter W.J.

These lines of evidence, together with the immunohistochemical colocalization of apoE and Aβ in the senile plaques and its presence in the intraneuronal amyloid of neurofibrillary tangles(6Namba Y. Tomonaga M. Kawasaki H. Otomo E. Ikeda K. Brain Res. 1991; 541: 163-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (1013) Google Scholar), suggest that apoE may play an active role in the pathogenesis of AD by promoting fibrillogenesis. However, immunohistochemical studies have shown that apoE is tightly associated with other types of cerebral amyloidosis, including Down syndrome related to Aβ, hereditary cerebral amyloid angiopathy of Icelandic type, related to a cystatin C variant, and spongiform encephalopathies such as Creutzfeldt-Jakob, kuru, and Gerstmann-Sträussler-Scheinker disease that are associated with the prion amyloid(6Namba Y. Tomonaga M. Kawasaki H. Otomo E. Ikeda K. Brain Res. 1991; 541: 163-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (1013) Google Scholar, 7Wisniewski T. Frangione B. Neurosci.

Aging. 1994; 15: S156-S157Crossref Google Scholar). Furthermore, apoE has been immunohistochemically identified within amyloid deposits in systemic forms of the disease such as secondary amyloidosis and familial Mediterranean fever related to amyloid A, immunoglobulin-related primary amyloidosis (AL), and familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy due to deposition of transthyretin genetic variants(7Wisniewski T. Frangione B. Neurosci. Lett. 1992; 135: 235-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar). Noteworthy, apoE is rarely detected in the nonfibrillar monoclonal deposits of light chain deposition disease and light and heavy chain deposition disease, which may be considered preamyloid forms of AL disease(26Gallo G. Wisniewski T. Choi-Miura N-H. Ghiso J. Frangione B. Am. J. Pathol. 1994; 145: 526-530PubMed Google Scholar). This widespread association of apoE with biochemically and clinically diverse types of amyloidoses suggests that apoE may participate in a general manner in the process of amyloid formation. In order to gain insight into the biochemistry of the association between apoE and amyloid proteins, we have characterized by Western blot and amino-terminal sequence analysis apoE fragments that co-purified with amyloid subunits from cases of systemic amyloidosis AA and AL. We also studied the in vitro binding of human apoE isolated from plasma to these amyloid proteins. Amyloid A and AL fibrils were isolated by the method of Pras et al.(27Pras M. Schubert M. Zucker-Franklin D. Rimon A. Franklin E.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1968; 47: 924-933Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) from spleen tissue of patients with familial Mediterranean fever (COH) and primary amyloidosis (RAM). Briefly, 20 g of spleen tissue were homogenized in 0.15 M sodium chloride and centrifuged at 8,000 × g for 30 min at 4°C, and the supernatant was discarded. This procedure was repeated until the supernatant had an absorbance of less than 0.075 at 280 nm. Then the insoluble residue was homogenized in distilled water and centrifuged at 8,000 × g at 4°C for 1 h. The amyloid fibrils that appear as a mucoid mass in the upper layer were dialyzed against water and lyophilized. After lyophilization, AA protein was purified on high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) (see below). AL fibrils were solubilized in 3 ml of 6 M guanidine hydrochloride, 0.1 M Tris, 0.17 M dithiothreitol, pH 10.2 and stirred for 48 h at room temperature. Then 1 ml of 2 M guanidine hydrochloride, 4 M acetic acid was added, and the solution was applied to a column (2.5 × 180 cm) consisting of 1:1 (wt) Sephadex G-75 and Sephadex G-100 (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.), equilibrated with 5 M guanidine hydrochloride, 1 M acetic acid. AL amyloid fragments isolated by size exclusion chromatography and AA fibrils were subjected to reverse phase chromatography on a Deltapak C18 column (0.78 × 30 cm, Waters) with a gradient of 30-80% acetonitrile in 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid, pH 2.5. The column eluents were monitored at 214 nm, and protein peaks were pooled and lyophilized. Crude amyloid fibrils and fractions obtained by gel filtration and HPLC were subjected to 12.5% Tricine-sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE)(28Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10505) Google Scholar), and the proteins were electrophoretically transferred (1 h, 400 mA, 4°C) to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Immobilon, Millipore) using 10 mM CAPS buffer, pH 11, containing 10% methanol. The membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in 10 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM sodium chloride, 0.1% Tween 20, pH 7.6, for 2 h at room temperature and then incubated overnight at 4°C with the following antibodies: rabbit polyclonal antibodies to amyloid A(29Prelli F. Pras M. Shtrasburg S. Frangione B. Scand. J. Immunol. 1991; 33: 783-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), λ light chain (Dako Corp.), goat anti-human apolipoprotein E (Fitzgerald), and monoclonal antibodies ID7 and 6C5 raised against residues 142-158, and 1-15 of apoE, respectively (a generous gift of Dr Y. Marcel). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated sheep anti-mouse (Amersham Corp.), goat anti-rabbit, and rabbit anti-goat IgG (Biosource International) were used as the second antibody at a dilution of 1:5000. Immunoblots were visualized with an ECL chemiluminescence kit (Amersham Corp.), according to the manufacturer's specifications. Anti-apoE antiserum was adsorbed by incubating 15 εg of purified human apoE with anti-apoE diluted 1:100 in 0.3% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in Tris-buffered saline, pH 7.4, for 3 h at room temperature. Automated Edman degradation sequence analysis was carried out on a 477A Protein/Peptide Sequenator, and the resulting phenylthiohydantoin amino acid derivatives were identified using the on-line 120A PTH Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Human ApoE was purchased from Cortex Biochem, and bovine ubiquitin and BSA were purchased from Sigma. The purity (> 95%) of these proteins was assessed by SDS-PAGE and NH2-terminal sequence analysis. Since human pooled apoE was used, it seems likely that its major isoform is apoE3 according to the statistical distribution in the normal population. Stock solutions of amyloid peptides were prepared in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, 50% acetonitrile and quantitated by amino acid analysis using a Pico-Tag analyzer (Waters) or by using a microbicinchoninic acid assay kit (Pierce). ApoE stock solution was made at 0.7 mg/ml in 0.1 M Tris, pH 7.4, and aliquots were stored at −20°C. Aliquots from these stock solutions were lyophilized and used for the co-incubation experiments as described(21Strittmatter W.J. Weisgraber K.H. Huang D.Y. Dong L.M. Salvesen G.S. Pericak-Vance M. Schmechel D. Saunders A.M. Goldgaber D. Roses A.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8098-8102Crossref PubMed Scopus (1244) Google Scholar). In brief, 0.5 εg of apoE were incubated with 10 εg of AA or 15 εg of AL in 12 εl of 0.1 M Tris, pH 7.4, for the indicated time at room temperature. After incubation, 15 εl of 4% SDS-sample buffer were added, and the mixture was run on 12.5% SDS-Tricine gels or on nondenaturing 7.5% polyacrylamide gels without SDS. Proteins were transferred to Immobilon P and detected using polyclonal anti-apoE or anti-AA and anti-AL antibodies as described above. As a control for the co-incubation experiments, ubiquitin (molecular mass, 8 kDa) and BSA were used instead of amyloid peptides and apoE, respectively. Sections of spleen tissue from cases of amyloid A (COH) and AL (RAM) were deparaffinized in xylene and rehydrated in ethanol and Tris-buffered saline. After rehydration, endogenous peroxidase was quenched by incubation with 0.3% hydrogen peroxide in methanol for 30 min. After blocking with 3% BSA in Tris-buffered saline, sections were incubated with goat anti-human apoE (Fitzgerald) at a 1:100 dilution overnight at 4°C and rabbit anti-goat labeled with horseradish peroxidase (Biosource International) at 1:1000 for 1 h. The reaction was detected using 0.03% 3,3’-diaminobenzidine tetrachloride and 0.01% hydrogen peroxide, 50 mM Tris, pH 7.4. Anti-apoE antiserum was adsorbed with purified human apoE as described above. Immunohistochemistry of spleen sections from patients COH and RAM showed that polyclonal anti-human apoE labeled amyloid deposits as described previously(7Wisniewski T. Frangione B. Neurosci. Lett. 1992; 135: 235-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar). This immunoreactivity was completely abolished after adsorption with purified human apoE, indicating its specificity (Fig. 1). Amyloid L from patient RAM was purified by the procedure of saline-water extraction and gel chromatography on Sephadex G-100 equilibrated with 5 M guanidine. SDS-PAGE of the fractions revealed that the main amyloid subunit had a molecular mass of 12-13 kDa, and amino-terminal sequence analysis showed its homology to a λIII or IV Ig light chain (Fig. 3). HPLC separation of RAM AL yielded a broad peak between 45 and 73% solvent B. This peak was divided into four fractions, A, B, C, and D, which were rechromatographed (Fig. 2a).Figure 2:Purification of RAM Amyloid L. a, reverse phase HPLC of RAM amyloid L on a Deltapak C18 column (0.78 × 30 cm) using a 30-80% linear gradient of acetonitrile in 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid. RAM amyloid L eluted as a broad peak between 45 and 73% of solvent B. b, Coomassie Blue stain of 12.5% Tricine-SDS-PAGE of RAM AL fibrils (F) and of HPLC fractions A, B, C, and D. RAM amyloid L subunit has a mass of 12-13 kDa (K) and is present in all the fractions together with a minor dimeric component of 26 kDa. The 8-9-kDa band present in fraction C is a carboxyl-terminal truncated fragment of AL. c, Western blot analysis of HPLC fractions A, B, C, and D using an antibody to human apoE and developed with chemoluminescence showed a major 8-9-kDa band and a minor 18-kDa band in fraction D. The approximate yield of the apoE fragment obtained from RAM amyloid was estimated as follows. The ratio of amyloid to apoE in fraction D was determined by densitometry of the Coomassie Blue-stained 12-13-kDa and 26-kDa AL bands and the 8-9 kDa apoE band in a PDI optical densitometer. This ratio was applied to the area of fraction D in the HPLC profile. Then the proportional area of fraction D to the total area of the HPLC profile was determined.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) SDS-PAGE analysis of these fractions revealed that in addition to the major AL subunit of 12-13 kDa, a 26-kDa component was seen in all the fractions. The latter probably corresponded to a dimer of AL subunit since it was recognized by anti-λ chain antibody (not shown). In addition, minor bands of approximately 8-9 kDa were present in fractions C and D (Fig. 2b). Western blot analysis of the same fractions using anti-apoE antibody and visualized by chemiluminescence detection revealed a major band at 8-9 kDa and a minor 24-kDa component in fraction D (Fig. 2c). The failure to detect apoE by direct amino-terminal sequence analysis of RAM fraction D, despite the positive apoE immunoreactivity of this fraction, indicated that it was present in a very low concentration. Therefore, the HPLC fractions A, B, C, and D were run on SDS-Tricine gels and transferred to Immobilon membrane, and the bands were excised and subjected to amino-terminal sequence analysis. Amino-terminal sequence of the 8-9-kDa component of fraction C revealed that it was a fragment of AL starting at position 1 (not shown). The 8-9-kDa band of HPLC fraction D yielded two major fragments of apoE starting at positions 225 and 227 and a minor one starting at position 216 in addition to the amyloid protein (Fig. 3). The estimated relative yield of apoE carboxyl-fragment extracted from these amyloid deposits was approximately a 1:50 molar ratio, apoE:amyloid. Purification of amyloid A subunits from COH was performed by saline-water extraction followed by separation on HPLC (Fig. 4a). This procedure yielded broad ill defined peaks that eluted at 60-78% solvent B, which were pooled into four fractions, A, B, C, and D, that were rechromatographed and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. A major protein band of 6-8 kDa was present in all the fractions, and a minor 16-kDa component, which may be a polymer of the 6-8-kDa peptide, was detected in fractions B and C (Fig. 4b). Amino-terminal sequence analysis of the HPLC fractions revealed only one residue per cycle. The sequence was identical to serum amyloid A protein (Fig. 3). No additional sequences were identified. When the same fractions were subjected to Western blot using anti-apoE antibody, the fluorogram revealed a broad band at 8-9 kDa in fraction D (Fig. 4c). Immunoreactivity of this band was completely suppressed after adsorption of the antiserum with purified human apoE, reflecting the specificity of the reaction. There was no band corresponding to intact apoE (34 kDa), suggesting that only small fragments of apoE were associated with the amyloid A subunit. The failure to detect apoE by direct amino-terminal sequence analysis of COH fraction D, despite the positive apoE immunoreactivity, indicated that it was present in a very low concentration. Therefore, a similar approach as for RAM AL was used, and proteins were separated on SDS-Tricine gels and transferred to Immobilon membrane. The upper portion of the 6-8-kDa band of HPLC fraction D yielded two sequences corresponding to the N terminus of amyloid A and to an apoE fragment starting at position 199, respectively (Fig. 3). In order to investigate whether intact apoE was present in the crude A and L amyloid fibril fraction before HPLC separation, we performed Western blots using monoclonal antibodies ID7 and 6C5, specific for the amino-terminal domain of apoE. A band corresponding to the 34-kDa intact apoE was observed only in association with COH fibrils. When 0.5 micrograms of purified human apoE were incubated with 10 εg of purified COH amyloid A for 6 h at room temperature in 0.1 M Tris, pH 7.4, a novel component of approximately 44 kDa was detected by Western immunoblot analysis using anti-apoE (Fig. 5a) and anti-AA antibodies (not shown), indicating that an apoE-amyloid complex partially resistant to SDS was formed. Under nondenaturing conditions in 7.5% polyacrylamide gels, this complex resulted in a shift of the electrophoretic mobility of apoE (Fig. 5b). No complex formation was detected when apoE was incubated with 20 εg of ubiquitin. The influence of apoE upon AA polymerization was evaluated by detection of the apoE-AA incubation mixture with an anti-AA antibody on Western blots. AA alone incubated for 6 h at room temperature in 0.1 M Tris, pH 7.4, showed mainly monomeric forms and minor polymeric components after SDS-PAGE. In contrast, AA co-incubated with apoE at a 1:85 molar ratio (apoE:amyloid) under the same conditions as above resulted in the appearance on the gel of a higher amount of AA dimers, trimers, tetramers, and higher molecular weight components (Fig. 5c). AA co-incubated with BSA showed no increment in polymerization when compared with AA alone (not shown). When the same experiment was done using RAM AL, no additional bands were present. However, most of the amyloid-apoE incubation mixture remained on top of the stacking and running gels as very high molecular weight components (not shown). This result is consistent with a higher degree of aggregation of amyloid AL subunits in the presence of apoE that resisted denaturation by SDS treatment. Apo E is a two-domain protein, modeled by its two major fragments after thrombin digestion. The 22-kDa amino-terminal domain (residues 1-191) is a stable globular structure containing the sequence that mediates low density lipoprotein-receptor binding(9Mahley R.W. Science. 1988; 240: 622-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (3395) Google Scholar, 30Wilson C. Wardell M.R. Weisgraber K.H. Mahley R.W. Agard D.A. Science. 1991; 252: 1817-1822Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar). In contrast, the 10-kDa carboxyl-terminal fragment is less stable, binds to lipoproteins, and mediates lipid-free apoE tetramerization in aqueous solutions(31Wetterau J.R. Aggerbeck L.P. Rall Jr., S.C. Weisgraber K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6240-6248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Previously, we published the finding of a tryptic fragment of apolipoprotein E corresponding to residues 270-278 in association with two amyloid A proteins(29Prelli F. Pras M. Shtrasburg S. Frangione B. Scand. J. Immunol. 1991; 33: 783-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Our present data extend that observation. Three fragments of apoE, located within the thrombolytic carboxyl-fragment of apoE, co-purified with RAM amyloid L. A slightly larger fragment of apoE starting in the region connecting the thrombolytic amino-terminal and carboxyl-terminal domains of apoE co-purified with COH amyloid A (Fig. 6). Similar apoE fragments have been recently obtained from AD senile plaques (32Wisniewski T. Lalowski M. Golabek A. Vogel T. Frangione B. Lancet. 1995; 345: 956-958Abstract PubMed Google Scholar We propose that the apoE fragments that co-purify with AA and AL are bound to these amyloid proteins in vivo. The remainder of the apoE molecule is cleaved by thrombin and/or other serine proteases in situ either before or after the amyloid-apoE complex is formed. Alternatively, we cannot rule out that apoE was partially degraded during purification. Intact apoE and apoE fragments, as determined by Western blot analysis, are present in the crude AA and AL fibril fractions before HPLC. However, after purification only the carboxyl-terminal apoE fragment co-purifies with the AA and AL amyloids. The question of whether the apoE-amyloid association precedes tissue deposition remains to be addressed. It is likely that the initial formation of stable apoE-amyloid complexes requires the interaction of the amino and carboxyl-terminal domains of apoE. Binding to the low density lipoprotein receptor through the amino-terminal domain of apoE requires lipid association, largely mediated by the carboxyl end of the molecule(31Wetterau J.R. Aggerbeck L.P. Rall Jr., S.C. Weisgraber K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6240-6248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The interdependence of the domains of apoE is further reflected by the effect that amino acid substitutions within the amino-terminal region have on the association of apoE with diverse lipoprotein classes. Such association is known to be mediated by the carboxyl terminus of apoE (9Mahley R.W. Science. 1988; 240: 622-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (3395) Google Scholar). The apoE3 isoform with a Cys at position 112 preferentially binds high density lipoproteins, whereas the presence of Arg at the same position favors binding to very low density and intermediate density lipoproteins(33Gregg R.E. Zech L.A. Schaefer E.J. Stark D. Wilson D. Brewer Jr., H.B. J. Clin. Invest. 1986; 78: 815-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 34Steinmetz A. Jakobs C. Motzny S. Kaffarnik H. Arteriosclerosis. 1989; 9: 405-411Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A cooperation between domains unique to each apoE isoform has been postulated to explain this selective lipoprotein distribution(35Weisgraber K.H. J. Lipid Res. 1990; 31: 1503-1511Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Whether a similar mechanism can account for the higher avidity of the apoE4 isoform for Aβ of AD remains to be tested. ApoE is capable of binding to synthetic Aβ through a strong interaction resistant to SDS(21Strittmatter W.J. Weisgraber K.H. Huang D.Y. Dong L.M. Salvesen G.S. Pericak-Vance M. Schmechel D.

A similar interaction between apoE and Aβ of the Dutch variant of cerebral amyloid angiopathy, a rare form of familial AD, has also been documented (36Castao E.M. Prelli F. Wisniewski T. Golabek A. Kumar R.A. Soto C. Frangione B. Biochem. J. 1995; 306: 599-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar) (details of apoE-Aβ binding will be published elsewhere). By using a set of truncated recombinants, the purported binding region to Aβ has been located within the carboxyl-end of apoE between amino acids 244 and 272 (21Strittmatter W.J. Weisgraber K.H. Huang D.Y. Dong L.M. Salvesen G.S. Pericak-Vance M. Schmechel D. Saunders A.M. Goldgaber D. Roses A.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8098-8102Crossref PubMed Scopus (1244) Google Scholar). Our findings suggest that the binding of this region to Aβ is not specific for this peptide but rather reflects a hydrophobic interaction between apoE carboxyl end and a common conformation shared by different amyloids. Secondary structure predictions indicate that a putative amphipathic helix with high affinity for lipids (37Segrest J.P. Jones M.K. De Loof H. Brouillette C.G. Venkatachalapathi Y.V. Anantharamaiah G.M. J. Lipid. Res. 1992; 33: 141-166Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) is located within the region that co-purifies with amyloid peptides. Possibly, other exchangeable apolipoproteins sharing similar amphipathic helices can also have amyloid-apolipoprotein interactions. It is noteworthy that genetic variants of apoAI can form amyloid in certain hereditary forms of human amyloidosis (38Nichols W.C. Dwulet F.E. Liepnieks J. Benson M.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 156: 762-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 39Soutar A.K. Hawkins P.N. Vigushin D.M. Tennent G.A. Booth S.E. Hutton T. Nguyen O. Totty N.F. Feest T.G. Hsuan J.J. Pepys M.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7389-7393Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) and that SAA, the precursor of AA, is itself an apolipoprotein associated to high density lipoprotein(40Benditt E.P. Erikssen N. Hanson R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4092-4096Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). We recently found that apoAI can bind to Aβ and promote Aβ fibrillogenesis in vitro.2 2E. M. Castao, unpublished observations. Presumably, in the same way that there is a large number of amyloidogenic precursor proteins that can end as insoluble amyloid fibrils, there is also a group of amyloidogenic apolipoproteins and acute phase reactants that can actively participate in this process either as constituents of fibrils or as modulators of fibrillogenesis. Our finding of a higher degree of polymerization of AA and AL native peptides upon incubation with apoE together with previous work using synthetic Aβ (22Ma J. Yee A. Brewer B. Das S. Potter H. Nature. 1995; 372: 92-94Crossref Scopus (862) Google Scholar, 23Wisniewski T. Castao E.M. Golabek A. Vogel T. Frangione B. Am. J. Pathol. 1994; 145: 1030-1035PubMed Google Scholar, 24Sanan D.A.

J. 1995; 306: 599-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar) points to a general role of apoE in amyloidogenesis. The molar ratios of apoE and AA used in our in vitro experiments are opposite of those found in plasma in normal conditions for apoE and SAA. However, SAA is an acute phase reactant, and its concentration in plasma is capable of rising 1000-fold during tissue injury or inflammation(41McAdam K.P.W.J. Sipe J.D. J. Exp. Med. 1976; 144: 1121-1127Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). AL, in turn, is derived from monoclonal light chains, which are known to have very high levels in the circulation in most of the cases. Therefore, we believe that the concentrations that we used in vitro can resemble more closely the pathological conditions in which amyloidosis develops than the physiological levels of apoE and amyloid precursors. ApoE may act as one of a group of pathological chaperones that promote the aggregation of amyloidogenic precursors of diverse primary structure into the β-pleated sheet conformation of amyloid fibrils. The absence of apoE and AP in the nonfibrillar, Congo red negative monoclonal deposits of light chain deposition disease and light and heavy chain deposition disease, which are considered preamyloid forms of AL disease(26Gallo G. Wisniewski T. Choi-Miura N-H. Ghiso J. Frangione B. Am. J. Pathol. 1994; 145: 526-530PubMed Google Scholar), suggests that apoE and AP may be essential catalysts for the modulation of the amyloid generation process. The interaction between apoE and amyloids may also be influenced by other local acute phase reactants such as proteoglycans to which both amyloid precursors and apoE are known to bind(42Stenstad T. Magnus J.H. Syse K. Husby G. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 1993; 94: 189-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 43Weisgraber K.H. Rall Jr., S.C. Mahley R.W. Milne R.W. Marcel Y.L Sparrow J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 2068-2076Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In spite of this putative widespread role of apoE in amyloid formation, it seems likely that a certain specificity exists between some of the amyloid precursors and apoE genetic isoforms. Thus far, no preferential associations between systemic amyloidoses and apoE isoforms have been reported; however, the genetic association of AD with apoE4 and the in vitro higher avidity of this isoform for Aβ may reflect such specificity(19Corder E.H. Saunders A.M. Strittmatter W.J. Schmechel D.E. Gaskell P.C. Small G.W. Roses A.D. Haines J.L. Pericak-Vance M.A. Science. 1993; 261: 921-923Crossref PubMed Scopus (7342) Google Scholar, 21Strittmatter W.J. Weisgraber K.H. Huang D.Y. Dong L.M. Salvesen G.S. Pericak-Vance M. Schmechel D. Saunders A.M. Goldgaber D. Roses A.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8098-8102Crossref PubMed Scopus (1244) Google Scholar). Alternatively, the apoE4 isoform may participate in the pathogenesis of AD through a different pathway unrelated to Aβ formation or deposition. Recently it has been reported that apoE can inhibit Aβ aggregation in vitro at concentrations similar to those found normally in biological fluids(44Evans K.C. Berger E. Cho C.G. Weisgraber K.H. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 763-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). This apparent discrepancy with previous studies could be due to different experimental conditions(22Ma J. Yee A. Brewer B. Das S. Potter H. Nature. 1995; 372: 92-94Crossref Scopus (862) Google Scholar, 23Wisniewski T. Castao E.M. Golabek A. Vogel T. Frangione B. Am. J. Pathol. 1994; 145: 1030-1035PubMed Google Scholar, 24Sanan D.A.

J. 1995; 306: 599-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). However, it raises the intriguing possibility that apoE may have a dual effect upon fibrillogenesis in vivo depending on the local concentrations of both apoE and amyloid precursors in sites of amyloid formation. Within physiological levels, apoE may have a protective role on amyloid formation by sequestering soluble amyloid precursors, as has been postulated for Aβ(44Evans K.C. Berger E. Cho C.G. Weisgraber K.H. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 763-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). However, Aβ appears to be associated to other apolipoproteins (i.e. apolipoprotein J) in biological fluids in vivo(45Ghiso J. Matsubara E. Koudinov A. Choi-Miura N-H. Tomita M. Wisniewski T. Frangione B. Biochem. J. 1993; 293: 27-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Yet, in tissues in which local membrane repair and lipid turnover are increased, such as after cell injury, apoE is overexpressed and can reach higher concentrations than those found normally in the circulation(10Boyles J.K. Zoellner C.D. Anderson L.J. Kosik L.M. Pitas R.E. Weisgraber K.H. Hui D.Y. Mahley R.W. Gebicke-Haerter P.J. Ignatius M.J. Shooter E.M. J. Clin.

A. 1986; 83: 1130-1134Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Under these circumstances, apoE may have a substantially different effect upon its association with amyloid precursors. In this pathological setting, several other factors may affect apoE behavior, such as its state of oxidation, lipid association, the presence of other amyloid/apoE binding proteins, and the stage of the amyloid process(47LaDu M.J. Falduto M.T. Manelli A.M. Reardon C.A. Getz G.S. Frail D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23403-23406Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The abnormal amyloid response in each individual will be determined finally by a complex process involving critical concentrations of amyloid precursors and a set of amyloid-associated proteins such as apoE, other apolipoproteins, AP, α1-antichymotrypsin (22Ma J. Yee A. Brewer B. Das S. Potter H. Nature. 1995; 372: 92-94Crossref Scopus (862) Google Scholar), and proteoglycans. These may act in conjunction with yet undefined tissue-specific factors to modulate the conformational transition of a soluble protein into an insoluble fibril. A better understanding of these complex interactions between amyloids and the factors that modulate their formation may open novel strategies for the treatment of the systemic and cerebral amyloid-related diseases."

Calcium ionophores ionomycin and A23187 reduced the levels of pericellular gelatinolytic activity in both untreated and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) or tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα)-stimulated cells as determined by degradation of radiolabeled gelatin. Gelatin zymography and immunoblotting revealed a dose-dependent decrease in the levels of secreted 92-kDa gelatinase, which was paralleled by a decrease of its mRNA. Treatment of cells with thapsigargin caused similar decreases of 92-kDa gelatinase mRNA and protein. The decrease of 92-kDa gelatinase expression was due to lower transcription rate as determined by transfection assays with 92-kDa gelatinase/luciferase construct. The expression of 72-kDa gelatinase was only slightly decreased by ionophores. Treatment of HT-1080 cells with PMA, TNFα, or concanavalin A resulted in the conversion of 72-kDa gelatinase proenzyme to its presumed 64- and 62-kDa active forms as determined by gelatin zymography and immunoblotting.

The expression of membrane-type matrix metalloproteinase, a potential activator of 72-kDa gelatinase, was not affected by ionophores.

In fact, MT-MMP seems to be a functional cell surface receptor for 72-kDa gelatinase, and TIMP-2 is needed for this interaction(35Strongin A.Y. Collier I. Bannikov G. Marmer B.L. Grant G.A.

Numerous signal transduction pathways utilize ionized calcium as a second messenger.

Treatment of HT-1080 fibrosarcoma cells with carboxy amido-triazole, an inhibitor of receptor-mediated calcium influx, reduces the levels of both latent and activated forms of 72-kDa gelatinase, although an initial increase in the level of 62-kDa activated form is seen(42Kohn E.C.

In the present study we have analyzed the effects of calcium ionophores and thapsigargin, an inhibitor of endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase, on the expression and proteolytic processing of the 92-kDa (MMP-9) and 72-kDa gelatinases (MMP-2) in human fibrosarcoma cells (HT-1080). We found that calcium ionophores reduced the basal and PMA-inducible pericellular gelatinolytic activities by inhibiting 92-kDa gelatinase expression and 72-kDa gelatinase activation. The present work describes a novel role for intracellular calcium signaling as a regulator of pericellular gelatinolytic activity. PMA, calcium ionophore A23187, ionomycin, cycloheximide, actinomycin D, concanavalin A, and thapsigargin were purchased from Sigma. Human recombinant TNFα was obtained from Boehringer Mannheim GmbH (Mannheim, Germany). Human fibrosarcoma HT-1080 cells (CCL-121, American Type Culture Collection, Rockville, MD) were cultivated in Eagle's minimal essential medium (MEM) containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.), 100 IU/ml penicillin, and 50 εg/ml streptomycin. The cultures were incubated at 37°C in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere until confluence. Before experiments, cultures were washed twice with serum-free medium and then incubated under serum-free conditions for 6 h. All experiments were carried out under serum-free conditions. To assay the toxicity of treatments, general protein synthesis was measured by metabolic labeling followed by trichloroacetic acid precipitation. Confluent cultures of HT-1080 cells were incubated under serum-free conditions for 6 h followed by incubation with PMA (4 nM) and ionomycin (50-500 nM) for 12 h. L-[4,5-3H]Leucine (2 εCi/ml) (Amersham, Buckinghamshire, United Kingdom) was then added and incubation was continued for 12 h. Conditioned medium was then collected and clarified by centrifugation, and secreted proteins were precipitated by adding bovine serum albumin (3 mg/ml final) and trichloroacetic acid (10% final concentration) followed by incubation on ice for 30 min and centrifugation. Protein pellet was solubilized in 0.3 N NaOH, and radioactivity was measured by liquid scintillation counter. To assay the pericellular gelatinolytic activity of cultured cells, tissue culture wells were coated with radiolabeled gelatin. Briefly, 1 εl (60 nCi) of N-[propionate-2,3-3H]propionylated rat type I collagen (0.19 mCi/mg; DuPont NEN) was diluted with 60 εl of 1 mg/ml unlabeled type I gelatin and heated at 80°C for 30 min. Gelatin was then diluted with MEM, applied onto culture dishes, and allowed to attach for 2 h. Unbound radioactivity was removed by extensive washing with MEM, and HT-1080 cells were seeded on the dish. One day later the cultures were washed with serum-free MEM for 6 h, after which fresh serum-free MEM was changed, supplemented with PMA (4 nM), ionomycin (500 nM), TNFα (10 ng/ml), and concanavalin A (50 εg/ml), and incubation was continued for 30 h. Subsequently, 500-εl aliquots of the conditioned medium were analyzed by liquid scintillation counter to measure the release of 3H-labeled peptides. To analyze the approximate molecular weights of the gelatinolytic proteins, conditioned medium from HT-1080 cells was assayed by gelatin zymography essentially as described(16Hibbs M.S. Hasty K.A. Seyer J.M. Kang A.H. Mainardi C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 2493-2500Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 43Lohi J. Harvima I. Keski-Oja J. J. Cell. Biochem. 1992; 50: 337-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Samples (15 εl) of conditioned medium were dissolved in nonreducing Laemmli sample buffer and separated by electrophoresis using discontinuous 3.5:7% polyacrylamide gels containing 1 mg/ml gelatin(44Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). After electrophoresis the gels were washed twice with 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.6, containing 5 mM CaCl2, 1 εM ZnCl2, 2.5% Triton X-100 (v/v) for 15 min to remove SDS, followed by a brief rinsing in washing buffer without Triton X-100. The gels were then incubated at 37°C for 1-2 days in 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer containing 5 mM CaCl2, 1 εM ZnCl2, 1% Triton X-100, 0.02% NaN3, pH 7.6. The digestion was terminated by 10% acetic acid followed by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 and destaining with 10% acetic acid, 10% methanol. Zones of enzymatic activity were seen as negatively stained bands. For the immunoblotting analysis, confluent cultures of HT-1080 cells were treated with PMA (4 nM) and ionomycin (500 nM) under serum free conditions. After 24-h incubation the conditioned medium was harvested, clarified by centrifugation, and an aliquot (15 εl) was dissolved in Laemmli sample buffer and subjected to 4-15% gradient SDS-PAGE under nonreducing conditions. Proteins were electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose (Schleicher & Schuell, Dassel, Germany) using a semi-dry blotting apparatus at 0.8 mA/cm2 for 1 h. Membranes were saturated with 5% milk in TBST (10 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, containing 150 mM NaCl, and 0.05% Tween 20) and incubated with monoclonal antibodies against human 72- and 92-kDa gelatinases (clones 42-5D11 and 7-11C, respectively, Oncogene Science, Inc., Cambridge, MA) (1 and 2 εg/ml in TBST, respectively). After several washes with the same buffer, the bound antibodies were detected using biotinylated anti-mouse IgG antibodies and peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin (Dakopatts, Copenhagen, Denmark) and enhanced chemiluminescence Western blotting detection system (Amersham International PIC, Amersham, UK) as described(45Taipale J. Koli K. Keski-Oja J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25378-25384Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Confluent cultures were washed twice with serum-free medium and then incubated under serum-free conditions for 6 h. Subsequently, PMA (4 nM), TNFα (10 ng/ml), concanavalin A (50 εg/ml), calcium ionophores A23187 (10-2000 nM) or ionomycin (10-2000 nM), or thapsigargin (10-2000 nM) were added into the medium as indicated, and incubation was continued for 24 h or as indicated. The cultures were then washed with phosphate-buffered saline (170 mM NaCl, 10 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4) and lysed for RNA extraction. RNA was purified by pelleting a guanidinium thiocyanate-N-laurylsarcosyl cell lysate through a CsCl cushion(46Chirgwin J.M. Przybyla A.E. MacDonald R.J. Rutter W.J. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5294-5299Crossref PubMed Scopus (16652) Google Scholar). Total RNA (15 εg) was electrophoresed on a 0.8% formaldehyde-agarose gel and transferred to a Zeta-Probe filter (Bio-Rad) in 20 × SSC (1 × SSC is 150 mM NaCl, 15 mM sodium citrate buffer, pH 7.0) and immobilized by UV cross-linking. The filters were hybridized to probes labeled with [α-32P]dCTP (Amersham) by the random priming method (Pharmacia LKB, Uppsala, Sweden). Hybridization was performed in 50% deionized formamide, 7% SDS, 250 mM NaCl, 250 mM NaH2PO4, 1 mM EDTA at 42°C for 24 h. Subsequent washing was carried out in 0.2 × SSC containing 0.1% SDS at 63°C. Stripping, when needed, was performed in 0.1 × SSC, 0.5% SDS at 100°C for 10 min. The following human cDNA probes were used: collagenase(47Goldberg G.I. Wilhelm S.M. Kronberger A. Bauer E.A. Grant G.A. Eisen A.Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 6600-6605Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), 72-kDa gelatinase(21Collier I.E. Wilhelm S.M. Eisen A.Z. Marmer B.L. Grant G.A. Selzer J.L.

For detection of human MT-MMP mRNA, a 699-base pair cDNA probe corresponding to bases 884-1582 of the published MT-MMP sequence (31Sato H. Takino T. Okada Y. Cao J. Shinagawa A. Yamamoto E. Seiki M. Nature. 1994; 370: 61-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (2379) Google Scholar) was generated by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction from HT-1080 cDNA.2 2J. Lohi, J. Westermarck, V.-M. Kähäri, and J. Keski-Oja, submitted for publication. To study the transcription of the 92-kDa gelatinase gene by transient transfection, we constructed a reporter plasmid containing a 2.2-kb fragment of the 5’-flanking region of 92-kDa gelatinase gene (−2161 to +20) linked to luciferase gene in pGL2-Basic vector (Promega Corp., Madison, WI). Promoter activity was then monitored by determining the luciferase activity of transiently transfected HT-1080 cells using a Luciferase Assay System kit according to manufacturer's instructions (Promega). Transfection efficiency was controlled by cotransfecting the promoter/luciferase construct with pCMVβ control plasmid containing cytomegalovirus promoter linked to the β-galactosidase gene (Clontech Laboratories Inc., Palo Alto, CA) and correcting the luciferase activities for β-galactosidase activity, which was measured as described(49Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T.E. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 16.66-16.67Google Scholar). Transfection was performed using lipofectamine according to manufacturer's instructions (Life Technologies, Inc.). Subconfluent 60-mm cultures of HT-1080 cells were washed twice with serum-free MEM. For each transfection, 6 εg of DNA and 18 εl of lipofectamine were mixed and incubated for 30 min at room temperature. DNA/liposome mixture was then transferred onto cells and incubated for 6 h. Subsequently, the cells were washed with MEM containing 0.2% bovine serum albumin for 30 min, re-washed with MEM, and incubated in MEM overnight. Next day PMA (4 nM) and ionomycin (500 nM) were added, and the incubation was continued for 30 h. At the end of this incubation the cells were lysed in reporter lysis buffer (Promega) and analyzed for luciferase and β-galactosidase activities. For stable transfections, a cDNA containing a 2.1-kb fragment of the 5’-flanking region of 92-kDa gelatinase gene (−2112 to +20) linked to luciferase gene was cloned to pcDNA3 expression vector (Invitrogen Corp.) containing the neomycin resistance gene to substitute the cytomegalovirus promoter of the vector. HT-1080 cells were transfected as described above and selected for 2 weeks in MEM containing 0.7 mg/ml neomycin analogue G418. Maintenance culture of cells was performed using MEM containing 0.25 mg/ml G418. For experiments, confluent cultures of transfected cells were washed with serum-free MEM without G418 extensively for 6 h and treated with PMA or ionomycin for 12 h. Subsequently, the cells were lysed and assayed for luciferase activity as described above. Cultured human fibrosarcoma cells (HT-1080) were used as a model to study the effects of elevated intracellular calcium levels on the pericellular gelatinolytic activity. HT-1080 cells were seeded on culture plates coated with denatured 3H-labeled rat type I collagen (gelatin). After overnight attachment and 6-h incubation in serum-free medium, the cultures were treated with the calcium ionophore ionomycin together with PMA for 30 h, and the radioactivity released in the conditioned medium was measured by a scintillation counter (Fig. 1A). Basal level of released radioactivity (including both enzymatic and non-enzymatic release) was increased about 3-fold by 4 nM PMA. Simultaneous treatment of cells with 50 nM ionomycin led to a notable decrease in the released radioactivity, and 500 nM ionomycin completely blocked the gelatinolysis-inducing activity of PMA. To study the molecular forms of gelatinolytic enzymes responsible for the increased gelatinolytic activity of PMA-treated cells, and the effect of calcium ionophores on their secretion, conditioned medium of HT-1080 cells was analyzed by gelatin zymography. Untreated cells secreted mainly 72-kDa (pro)gelatinase, whereas only very low levels of 92-kDa gelatinase were observed (Fig. 1B). Treatment of the cells with PMA resulted in enhancement of 92-kDa gelatinase secretion and partial conversion/proteolytic processing of 72-kDa gelatinase proenzyme to the presumably activated 64- and 62-kDa forms of 72-kDa gelatinase(33Brown P.D. Levy A.T. Marguiles I.M.K. Liotta L.A. Stetler-Stevenson W.G. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 6184-6191PubMed Google Scholar). Cotreatment with ionomycin or another calcium ionophore A23187 resulted in the disappearance of 92-, 64-, and 62-kDa gelatinolytic protein bands, suggesting that calcium ionophores inhibit both the PMA-induced secretion of 92-kDa gelatinase and activation of 72-kDa gelatinase. The changes in the gelatinolytic activities were paralleled by a decrease in the level of 92-kDa gelatinase and by inhibition of the PMA-induced processing of 72-kDa gelatinase secreted into the conditioned medium as determined by immunoblotting (Fig. 1C). Treatment of cells with ionomycin alone caused also a moderate decrease in the level of secreted 72-kDa gelatinase. Thapsigargin, an inhibitor of endomembrane Ca2+-ATPase, is another chemical capable of increasing intracellular calcium levels. Accordingly, treatment of HT-1080 cells with thapsigargin and PMA caused a dose-dependent decrease of 92-kDa gelatinase expression and inhibition of proteolytic processing/activation of 72-kDa gelatinase (Fig. 1B). Metabolic labeling of PMA- and ionomycin-treated cells with [3H]leucine followed by trichloroacetic acid precipitation of secreted macromolecules indicated a slight decrease (20%) in general protein synthesis at maximal doses tested (data not shown), but the decrease was much lower than the decrease of gelatinolytic activity. We analyzed next whether ionomycin could also block the effects of other known inducers of 72-kDa gelatinase activation and 92-kDa gelatinase expression. HT-1080 cells were cultivated on [3H]gelatin-coated dishes as described above, followed by treatment with PMA, TNF-α, or concanavalin A in the presence of ionomycin for 30 h as indicated (Fig. 2A). Scintillation counting of the supernatant fluids showed 2-3-fold increases in the levels of released radioactivity in cultures treated with PMA, TNF-α, or concanavalin A, indicating an increase in the pericellular gelatinolytic activity (Fig. 2A). Addition of ionomycin completely prevented this increase. To characterize the regulation of different gelatinases and their activation by the above-mentioned factors, aliquots of conditioned medium of a similar experiment were assayed by gelatin zymography. Accordingly, treatment of the cells with PMA or TNF-α resulted in an increase in 92-kDa gelatinase secretion and partial conversion of 72-kDa gelatinase proenzyme to 64- and 62-kDa forms. Treatment of cells with concanavalin A caused almost complete conversion of 72-kDa gelatinase to 64- and 62-kDa forms, but did not affect the secretion of 92-kDa gelatinase. Treatment with ionomycin resulted both in the inhibition of the induction of 92-kDa gelatinase secretion and reduced activation of 72-kDa gelatinase (Fig. 2B). To study the effect of elevated intracellular calcium on the expression of 92- and"

CK2 from most sources has been purified as a heterotetramer composed of three dissimilar subunits, i.e. α and α′ subunits of 35-44 kDa and a β subunit of 24-29 kDa, which associate to form native α2β2, αα′β2, α′2β2 structures(3Boldyreff B.

Considerable interest in CK2 has arisen recently because its activity was found transiently stimulated following treatment with several growth factors (19Sommercorn J. Mulligan J.A. Lozenman F.J.

CK2 is markedly activated in vitro by polycationic structures including polyamines, spermine being the most potent(24Cochet C. Chambaz E.M. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1983; 30: 247-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). A special interest is raised by polyamines since they are ubiquitous cellular components that are required for normal cell growth (25Scalabrino G. Lorenzini E.C. Ferioli M.E. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1991; 77: 1-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and that have been shown to modulate a number of biological activities involved in the process of cellular signaling. The thyrotropin-stimulated adenylate cyclase from beef thyroid plasma membrane (26Wolff J. Cook G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 6897-6903Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and a phosphatidylinositol kinase located in the plasma membranes from A431 cells (27Vogel S. Hoppe J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1986; 154: 253-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) are stimulated by polyamines. It has also been reported that the catalytic activity of an erythrocyte multifunctional proteinase (28Mellgren R.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1040: 28-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) and protein phosphatases 1 and 2A (29Tung H.Y.L. Pelech S. Fischer M.J. Pogson C.I. Cohen P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1985; 149: 305-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) are stimulated by polyamines. Polyamines have been shown likewise to activate DNA polymerases, DNA gyrase, DNA methylases, and the eucaryotic type I (30Srivenugopal K.S. Morris D.R. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 4766-4771Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) and type II topoisomerases(31Pommier Y. Kerrigan D. Kohn K. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 995-1002Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). We have previously suggested that intracellular polyamines may express part of their biological action through an effect upon CK2. Although an effect through the protein substrate conformation may contribute to the activation of the phosphotransferase activity of the kinase by polyamines(32Moreno F.J. Lechuga C.G. Collado M. Benitez M.J. Jiménez J.S. Biochem. J. 1993; 289: 631-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), we have demonstrated a direct interaction between these polycations and the enzyme(33Filhol O. Cochet C. Delagoutte T. Chambaz E.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 180: 945-952Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). CK2 binds spermine with high affinity, and the β subunit plays an essential role in this interaction. Moreover, the interaction of the protein p53 with CK2 is driven by the β subunit, and this interaction is strongly inhibited in the presence of spermine(18Filhol O. Baudier J. Delphin C. Loue-Mackenbach P. Chambaz E.M. Cochet C. J. Biol.

Although hydrogen bonds as well as ionic and Van Der Waals' forces have been reported as the driving forces by which polyamines interact with nucleic acids, proteins, and phospholipids(34Heby O.

As a prerequisite, the identification of the kinase domain(s) involved and the nature of this interaction should help understanding of the regulation of this protein kinase. The present study was undertaken with the aim of identifying accurately the spermine binding site at the primary structure level of CK2. Photoaffinity labeling with aryldiazonium salts has previously been used to label several proteins (for review, see (40Kotzyba-Hibert F. Kapfer I. Goeldner M. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 1995; (in press)Google Scholar)) as well as nucleic acid binding sites(41Garcia A. Giegé R. Behr J.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 89-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 42Schmid N. Behr J.P. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 4357-4361Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The present study made use of such a tritiated photoactivable analog of spermine to map the polyamine binding domain of the recombinant Drosophila CK2. Subsequent analysis revealed a preferential labeling of the β subunit. Controlled proteolysis and microsequencing analysis of the isolated labeled peptide resulted in the identification of threonine 72 as the main residue covalently bound to the photoaffinity probe. As a working hypothesis, we propose a structural model for the major polyamine binding site of CK2 where both glutamic acid residues 73 and 77 could be crucial determinants for the interaction. The nonradioactive sperminediazonium salt was prepared as described previously(43Behr J.P. J. Chem. Soc. Chem. Comm. 1989; : 101-103Crossref Google Scholar). The photoaffinity labeling probe [3H]sperminediazonium (Fig. SI) was synthesized as follows. p-Amino-m-diiodoaniline was obtained by reduction of m-diiodo-p-nitroaniline with NaBH2S3 (Lancette's reagent) in Tetrahydro Furan under reflux for 16 h. The residue was chromatographed on a Silica gel column 4% MeOH-containing CH2CL2.

Soc. Chem. Comm. 1989; : 101-103Crossref Google Scholar) was activated with N-hydroxysuccinimide (1.1 eq) in the presence of dicyclohexilcarbodiimide (1 eq) in CH2Cl2. After filtration, the resulting activated ester solution was reacted with p-amino-m-diiodoaniline (2.2 eq) under reflux for 12 h. Silica gel chromatography (1% MeOH in CH2Cl2) yielded 78% of tetra-N-t-butoxycarbonyl-o,o′-diiodoanilinospermine. RF (CH2Cl2, 5% MeOH, 1% AcOH) = 0.55. MS (fast atomic bombardment): 988 (M+).

[3H]anilinospermine was synthesized at the Commissariat l'Energie Atomique (Saclay, France) by catalytic dehalogenation of the o,o′-diiodo derivative in the presence of tritium gas.2 2M. Goeldner and C. Hirth, unpublished results. Small aliquots of [3H]sperminediazonium were obtained after diazotation with isopentylnitrite and removal of the t-butoxycarbonyl protecting groups in CF3CO2H, essentially as described previously(43Behr J.P. J. Chem. Soc. Chem. Comm. 1989; : 101-103Crossref Google Scholar). The concentration (∊323 = 2.25 × 104 dm3•mol−1•cm−1) and specific radioactivity of the probe were determined to be 350 μM and 15 Ci/mmol, respectively. N-Propyl alcohol required for HPLC was purchased from Carlo Erba. Trifluoroacetic acid and trifluoroethanol were respectively from Carlo Erba and Aldrich. Insect cells (Sf9 cells, 106/ml) were coinfected with EV 55 Dm α and EV 55 Dm β viruses at a multiplicity of infection of 5-10 as described previously by Filhol et al.(7Filhol O. Cochet C. Wedegaertner P. Gill G.N. Chambaz E.M. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 11133-11140Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The cell lysate was sonicated for 3 min and centrifuged at 200,000 × g for 30 min. The soluble extract was diluted to give a final concentration of 0.2 M NaCl applied onto a phosphocellulose column previously equilibrated with 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 1% glycerol, 0.1% Triton X-100 (buffer A) and recycled 3 times through the column. A 0.2-1.5 M linear NaCl gradient in buffer A was applied. Aliquots of collected fractions were used for CK2 activity. The fractions containing CK2 activity were pooled and concentrated in a filtration cell (Amicon) through a XM 50 membrane to give a final volume of 90 ml. The concentrated solution was diluted 5 times and loaded onto a heparin-Sepharose column previously equilibrated in 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 1% glycerol (buffer B). A 0.4-1.2 M NaCl linear gradient in buffer B was developed. The protein concentration of the collected fractions was assayed by Coomassie Blue staining according to Bradford(44Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (214321) Google Scholar). Aliquots of fractions containing CK2 were checked by electrophoresis on a SDS 12% polyacrylamide gel, and the corresponding fractions were pooled and concentrated in a filtration cell (Amicon) through a PM 30 membrane. The concentrated solution was diluted 10 times and loaded onto a DEAE cellulose column previously equilibrated in buffer B. A 0-1 M linear NaCl gradient in buffer B was applied. Aliquots of the eluted fractions were analyzed by Coomassie Blue staining according to Bradford (44Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (214321) Google Scholar) and electrophoresis on a SDS 12% polyacrylamide gel. The fractions containing CK2 were pooled and stored in 1 M NaCl until used. Characterization of the photoaffinity reaction was performed by incubation of 1-2 μg of purified recombinant CK2 (7.1-14.2 pmols) with a 20-fold molar excess of [3H]sperminediazonium (9 μM) in 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, for 2 min in the dark at 4°C. UV irradiation (330 nm) was carried out with a Hanao 4-watt lamp at a distance of 2 cm from the top of the opened microtube containing the sample. The CK2 catalytic activity was assayed as described previously(7Filhol O. Cochet C. Wedegaertner P. Gill G.N. Chambaz E.M. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 11133-11140Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Determination of the polyamine binding site were performed similarly. A CK2 amount of 300 μg (2.14 nmol) was incubated with a 10-fold molar excess of [3H]sperminediazonium (21.4 nmol) prior to chemical proteolysis. The photolabeling mixture was loaded on a 0.1%-SDS 12% polyacrylamide gel, and electrophoresis was performed during 1.5 h at 150 V according to Laemmli(45Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206597) Google Scholar). The separated subunits were electrophoretically transferred onto an Immobilon P transfer membrane (Millipore, Saint Quentin, Yvelines, France), which was then dried for 2 h at 37°C and subjected to autoradiography for 12 h, using Hyperfilm-3H (Amersham Corp.). The membrane slices corresponding to the α and the β subunits were analyzed for radioactivity by scintillation counting. For the determination of the spermine binding site, both the α and the β subunits were detected by Coomassie Blue staining (0.2% Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250, 50% methanol, 10% acetic acid) and 50% methanol, 10% acetic acid destaining. The gel pieces corresponding respectively to the α and the β subunits were washed twice in 1 ml of Milli Q water (Millipore) and once in 200 μl of 70% formic acid (BDH Aristar). The gel slices were then immersed in 200-300 μl of 100 mg/ml CNBr, 70% formic acid for 15 h in the dark under an argon atmosphere. The CNBr solution was diluted 5-fold with ultrapure water, and the resulting peptides were concentrated using a Speed Vac (Savant Instruments, Inc, Hicksville, NY) to a final volume of 60 μl. The peptides were loaded onto a Merck LiChrospher RP column (4.5 mm × 13 cm) previously equilibrated in sonicated ultrapure water containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, 4% trifluoroethanol. The column was developed with a linear 0-60% gradient of propyl alcohol at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min, and 0.5-ml fractions were collected. The HPLC system used was a Beckman programmable solvent module 126 connected to a Beckman diode array detector module 168. Peptide-containing fractions were spotted onto a glass fiber disk coated with Polybrene, and amino acid sequence was performed. Modelling of the spermine binding site was performed on Evans and Sutherland computers. The α helix containing the photolabeled site in the β subunit was built with the program O(46Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13006) Google Scholar). The [3H]sperminediazonium molecule was built with the program MAD (package Oxford Molecular, 1993). Both α helix and [3H]sperminediazonium structures were refined by the program Xplor(47Brünger A.J. X-PLOR. Yale University, New Haven, CT1992Google Scholar). The [3H]sperminediazonium molecule bears two different chemical groups, i.e. the reactive diazonium on one hand and the spermine on the other hand. It was thus required to check whether this spermine analog exhibited the same characteristics as spermine toward CK2. A rapid gel filtration technique was used in the dark to estimate the binding affinity of recombinant Drosophila CK2 for [3H]sperminediazonium. Plotting the data, according to Scatchard(48Scatchard G. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1949; 51: 660-672Crossref Scopus (17785) Google Scholar), disclosed an apparent dissociation constant of 6 μM for the spermine analog, a value very close to that previously determined for spermine itself (Table 1). When the same experiment was performed under daylight conditions, it was found that nonradioactive sperminediazonium was 10 times more efficient than spermine in displacing [3H]spermine bound to CK2. In fact, under light irradiation, the two ligand molecules are not equivalent because, unlike spermine, the interaction of a sperminediazonium molecule with CK2 results in covalent and irreversible binding, therefore preventing the noncovalent binding of spermine at the same site. To compare the potency of the affinity probe to that of spermine as an activator of CK2, increasing sperminediazonium concentrations were introduced in the dark in the usual CK2 activity assay with casein as the protein substrate. Half-maximal activation of the enzyme was obtained with 150 μM of sperminediazonium as compared with 120 μM for spermine (Table 1).TABLE I Open table in a new tab It thus appeared that, before light activation, spermine diazonium exhibits the major properties of spermine toward CK2, with regard to binding as well as stimulating activities. These observations validate the use of the photoactivable analog as a probe to characterize the spermine binding domain in the kinase molecule. Recombinant CK2 was incubated with [3H]sperminediazonium (50 μM), and the mixture was subjected to irradiation for various periods of times. Covalent labeling of CK2 was found to rapidly increase with irradiation time to reach a plateau within 2 min (not shown). When the kinase was submitted to irradiation in the absence of the photoaffinity probe, no significant change in its catalytic activity was observed following 0.5-15 min irradiation (Table 1). It was therefore assumed that this treatment did not drastically alter the structural organization of the enzyme, and a 2 min irradiation time was used in all further affinity labeling experiments. CK2 was then incubated with increasing concentrations of [3H]sperminediazonium; the mixture was submitted to a 2-min irradiation, and the subunits of the enzyme were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Autoradiography of the corresponding gels showed that the radioactivity was found associated with both the α and the β subunit of the protein kinase (Fig. 1). Quantitation of the radioactivity associated with the two subunits showed a typical saturation curve exhibiting a maximal covalent labeling for a [3H]sperminediazonium concentration of 50 μM and a half-maximum effective concentration of about 10 μM. This value is in good agreement with the CK2 binding constant of 11 μM previously determined for spermine(33Filhol O. Cochet C. Delagoutte T. Chambaz E.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 180: 945-952Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). As a control experiment, covalent labeling of each kinase subunit was examined by irradiation of the enzyme for 2 min in the presence of [3H]sperminediazonium that has been previously photolyzed by UV irradiation for various periods of time. Under these conditions, a large decrease in the reactivity of the preirradiated probe was observed, indicating the requirement of a photoactivated reaction for the diazonium group in the covalent labeling process (Fig. 2).Figure 2:Photolabeling of CK2 with prephotolyzed [3H]sperminediazonium. [3H]Sperminediazonium (10 μM) was photolyzed for different times before being incubated with CK2 for 2 min in the dark at 4°C followed by 2 min of irradiation at 330 nm as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Following electrophoresis on a 12% polyacrylamide gel, both α (□) and β (▪) subunits were transferred on a Western blotting membrane (Immobilon P), and the associated radioactivity was analyzed by liquid scintillation counting.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) When the photoaffinity labeling was carried out in the presence of increasing concentrations of unlabeled sperminediazonium, a decrease in the radioactivity associated with the β subunit and to a lesser extent with the α subunit was observed (Fig. 3A). Similarly, the presence of increasing concentrations of spermine during the photolabeling reaction led to a progressive decrease of the radioactivity covalently associated with the α and β subunits of the kinase (Fig. 3B). Under these experimental conditions, it may appear that sperminediazonium exhibits a higher binding affinity. However, it should be emphasized that after light irradiation, the two ligand molecules are not equivalent with respect to their interaction with CK2. The light-induced covalent binding of sperminediazonium is responsible for a “trapping effect” as it was described previously for example with the photoaffinity labeling of the regulatory subunit of protein kinase A(49Pomerantz A.H. Rudolph S.A. Haley B.E. Greengard P. Biochemistry. 1975; 14: 3858-3862Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Spermine binds to the enzyme by the way of low energy forces leading to an equilibrium state in which the spermine site number remains constant. Sperminediazonium behavior is similar to that of spermine during incubation in the dark. However the situation becomes different under irradiation conditions (Fig. 3) since a spermine binding site disappears on CK2 for each CK2-diazonium covalent bond created. Therefore the spermine concentrations required to block the binding of [3H]sperminediazonium were much higher than those necessary when the incubations were carried out in the dark (Fig. 3B). From the experiment described in Fig. 3, it may thus be concluded that the α and β subunits are both target sites of covalent labeling with [3H]sperminediazonium. However, previous observations (33Filhol O. Cochet C. Delagoutte T. Chambaz E.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 180: 945-952Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) have clearly shown that only oligomeric CK2 is stimulated by spermine and that the kinase activity of the isolated α subunit is unaffected by the presence of polyamine. Furthermore, a specific binding of [3H]spermine could be detected with the oligomeric CK2, and no detectable binding was observed with the isolated catalytic α subunit(33Filhol O. Cochet C. Delagoutte T. Chambaz E.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 180: 945-952Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Scatchard analysis disclosed the existence of two binding sites for [3H]spermine (33Filhol O. Cochet C. Delagoutte T. Chambaz E.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 180: 945-952Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) with binding parameters similar to those determined for [3H]sperminediazonium, therefore suggesting that the affinity labeling obtained with [3H]sperminediazonium corresponds to the spermine binding site of CK2. Following the photoaffinity labeling of the tetrameric form of CK2, it was determined that the labeling of the α subunit represents 60-70% of the β subunit labeling. However this proportion decreased to 18% when the photoaffinity labeling was performed on a mixture of equimolar quantities of nonassociated α and β subunits. This strongly suggests that in the native tetrameric enzyme, the α labeling site corresponds to a region of the α subunit that is in close proximity with the spermine binding site of the β subunit (data not shown). We therefore decided to investigate first the domain of the β subunit, which is involved in the polyamine binding and covalently labeled with the reactive spermine probe. We thought it may be of interest to secondly delineate the α subunit-labeled sequence to get more structural information concerning the α-β subunit interaction in the tetrameric form of the kinase. CK2 was photoaffinity labeled in the presence of a 10-fold molar excess of [3H]sperminediazonium probe. After electrophoresis, the separated affinity labeled subunits were subjected to a chemical proteolysis by cyanogen bromide. The resulting peptides were extracted from the gel and separated by a C8 reverse phase HPLC, and the peptide-associated radioactivity was measured in the collected fractions. The peptide mixture generated from the β subunit yielded three major radioactive peaks (peak A (retention time, 4 min), peak B (retention time, 6 min), and peak C (retention time, 22-23 min)), which coeluted with three absorbency peaks at 250 nm (Fig. 4A). Following polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis, the two radiolabeled peptides corresponding to peaks B and C were chosen to be sequenced as described under “Experimental Procedures” because of their smaller apparent size, comparatively to the peak A peptide. The identification of the resultant PTH derivatives revealed the sequence X-Glu-Gln-Ala-Ala-Glu-X (Fig. 4B) for peptide B. Cycles 1 and 7 did not yield any identifiable PTH derivatives, but these missing residues were identified respectively as Thr72 and Met78 in the derived sequence of the β subunit of the Drosophila CK2. The absence of any identifiable PTH derivative in the first position together with the observation that most of the radioactivity was released at cycle 1 was consistent with Thr72 being modified and provided corroborative evidence that this threonyl residue was the target site of the photoaffinity labeling. Methionine chemically modified by the cyanogen bromide treatment was not detectable by microsequencing. The absence of any PTH derivatives in further cycles was in good agreement with a size of seven amino acid residues for the identified peptide. Microsequencing of peptide C revealed the sequence X1-Glu-X2-X3-Gln-Thr-Gly-Asp-Phe-Gly-X4-X5-Pro-X6-Val-Tyr (Fig. 4C). The missing residues X1, X2, X3, X4, X5, and X6 were identified, respectively, as Ile98, Lys100, Tyr101, His108, Cys109, and Arg111 in the derived sequence of the β subunit of the Drosophila CK2. The absence of any detectable PTH derivative at cycle 11 together with the presence of a major peak of radioactivity released at this position provided evidence that the histidyl residue 108 was a photoaffinity-labeled site in the β subunit. The same strategy was applied to identify the photoaffinity labeled site on the α subunit (Fig. 5A). Microsequencing analysis of the major radiolabeled peptide (retention time, 5 min) revealed the sequence X1-Ala-Ser-X2(Fig. 5B). Cycle 4 failed to yield any detectable PTH derivative, but the corresponding residue was identified as Met223 in the derived sequence of the CK2 α subunit. Radioactivity was mainly released at cycle 1, suggesting Leu220 as the amino acid residue covalently bound to the probe. A three-dimensional representation of an hypothetical α helix lying between the amino acid residues Met71 and Met78 corresponding to the major labeled site on the β subunit was built to investigate how this domain would allow electrostatic interactions with the sperminediazonium molecule. Because of the lack of crystallographic data concerning [3H]sperminediazonium, the package Oxford Molecular was used to build and refine the L conformation of the probe molecule. A covalent bond was drawn between the carbon atom at the para position of the probe phenyl group and the oxygen atom of the threonine 72 side chain. Two of the four nitrogen atoms of the [3H]sperminediazonium molecule were located spatially in order to generate electrostatic interactions with the carboxylic groups of the glutamic residues 73 and 77. The distances between the atoms involved in these interactions were settled to 2.6 Å. The final step of energy minimization was performed on the hypothetic model using the Xplor program and yielded a large negative value corresponding to one of the most stabilized conformation. The resulting proposed molecular model is illustrated in Fig. 6. Interestingly, the electrostatic interactions between the positive nitrogen atoms of the spermine moiety and the negative carboxylic groups of the glutamic residues 73 and 77 are remarkably conserved. The aim of this work was to identify the polyamine binding site along the primary structure of the Drosophila CK2. Determination of the amino acid residues involved in the binding of spermine was carried out by a photoaffinity labeling method using a tritiated spermine analog, i.e. [3H]sperminediazonium. This reagent has been previously used to identify spermine binding sites on DNA(41Garcia A. Giegé R. Behr J.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 89-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 42Schmid N. Behr J.P. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 4357-4361Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). This labeled probe was first shown to mimic spermine in exhibiting similar binding and activating properties toward CK2. These observations indicated that the probe behaved as a spermine analog and met the criteria to be used for the determination of a polyamine binding site. We have determined that an irradiation time of 2 min was sufficient to reach the highest photoaffinity labeling of CK2. Proteolysis of the photolabeled kinase led to the identification of two radiolabeled peptides on the regulatory β subunit. The first one was the seven-amino acid sequence Thr72-Glu-Gln-Ala-Ala-Glu-Met78 in which the amino acid residue covalently bound to [3H]sperminediazonium was identified as threonine 72. Based on the photoaffinity labeling of this amino acid residue and on the predicted secondary structure of the surrounding sequence, we propose as a working hypothesis a structural model that may account for a spermine binding domain. This three-dimensional representation exhibits a stable conformation of the photolabeled peptide in which both glutamic acid 73 and 77 are able to generate electrostatic interactions with two of the four positives charges of the [3H]sperminediazonium molecule. According to this model, both glutamic acid residues 73 and 77 would be two amino acid residues involved in the binding of spermine to the CK2 β subunit. It may be noticed that the two remaining free positive charges of spermine should probably interact with two other acidic amino acid residues of the acidic stretch comprising residues Asp51-Asp64 of the β subunit. Analysis of the β subunit sequence lying between residues 55 and 80 by the Chou and Fasman method yielded a predicted secondary structure exhibiting an α helix-loop-α helix motif with a large amphipatic behavior for the second α helix. This would suggest that both α helices could contribute to the formation of the spermine binding domain. This hypothesis would be in line with the recent report of an acidic peptide bearing an α helix conformation when associated with spermine and exhibiting the sequence: α, EQAAEα 2(50Tabet M. Labroo V. Sheppard P. Sasaki T. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1993; 115: 3866-3868Crossref Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The affinity labeling experiment described in Fig. 1 disclosed that both the α and the β subunit of the kinase were labeled by [3H]sperminediazonium. The labeling of the α subunit could be interpreted as reflecting a second spermine binding site present on this subunit. However, previous observations have demonstrated that the [3H]spermine binding activity of oligomeric CK2 required the presence of the β subunit of the enzyme. No binding activity could be detected with the isolated α subunit (33Filhol O. Cochet C. Delagoutte T. Chambaz E.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 180: 945-952Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Furthermore, spermine activation of the oligomeric protein kinase activity required the presence of the β subunit of the kinase, the catalytic activity of the isolated α subunit being completely insensitive to the polyamine(7Filhol O. Cochet C. Wedegaertner P. Gill G.N. Chambaz E.M. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 11133-11140Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In addition, a weak labeling of the α subunit was observed in the presence of equimolar nonassociated β subunit comparatively with that obtained when the α subunit is inserted in the tetrameric form of the enzyme. In the absence of knowledge concerning the CK2 three-dimensional structure, it is tentatively concluded that the labeling of the α subunit observed in the present study may possibly be explained by the close vicinity of the catalytic subunit sequence Leu220-Ala-Ser-Met223 with the spermine binding domain of the β subunit. This proximity would allow the diazonium reactive moiety of the spermine analog to react with the residue Leu220 of the α subunit. The major aim of this study was to gain information concerning the major spermine binding domain on the β subunit of CK2. A spermine binding site was identified at the primary structure level in the acidic stretch located between amino acid residues 55 and 80. Our results are in agreement with observations by others showing that an acidic N-terminal cluster of 50 residues is responsible for an intrinsic negative regulation of CK2 basal activity and for an efficient autophosphorylation of the β subunit and is possibly implicated in the response to polybasic effectors like polyamines(51Meggio F. Boldyreff B. Marin O. Pinna L.A. Issinger O.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 204: 293-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Recently we have generated a mutant form of human CK2 in which the glutamic acid residues 60, 61, and 63 of the β subunit have been replaced by three alanine residues. These mutations led to an active enzyme exhibiting a basal specific activity 3 times that of wild-type CK2, in agreement with the observations of Boldyreff et al.(52Boldyreff B. Meggio F. Pinna L.A. Issinger O.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4827-4831Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, the stimulation of this CK2 mutant by spermine was found to be impaired.3 3D. Leroy and J. K. Hériché unpublished results. This is consistent with our hypothesis that in addition to the glutamic acid residues 73 and 77, one or two of the glutamic residues 60, 61, and 63 may participate to the electrostatic interactions with two of the four positive charges of spermine. The data presented here provide chemical evidence for the localization of a major spermine binding domain of CK2 on its β subunit. Detailed mapping of the residues involved in the interaction will require site-directed point mutagenesis in this domain. This study is in progress in our laboratory, it is hoped that it will shed new light on the possible role of the polyamine interaction in the regulation of CK2 activity in the intact cell.

This inhibitor enhances photoinduced ET quenching of the triplet excited state of a zinc-substituted protein (ZnCcP or ZnCc) by its iron(III) partner (Fe3+Cc or Fe3+CcP). These results show that CcP and Cc form a ternary complex in which one Cc molecule binds tightly at a surface domain of CcP having low ET reactivity, whereas the second Cc molecule binds weakly to the 1:1 complex at a second domain with markedly greater (approximately 10(3)) reactivity. These results also rule out the possibility that Cc bound at the second domain cooperatively enhances ET to Cc at the first domain. The multiphasic kinetics observed for the photoproduced ET intermediate do not reflect electron self-exchange between two Cc molecules within the ternary complex."
https://openalex.org/W2025255927,"Results are presented on a peptide fragment (1013-1056) from human DNA topoisomerase II α. This was selected using the procedure of Lupas et al. (Lupas, A., Van Dyke, M., and Stock, J.(1991) Science 252, 1162-1164) for its potential to adopt a stable coiled-coil structure. The same theoretical treatment rejected the segment 994-1021 proposed by Zwelling and Perry (Zwelling, L. A., and Perry, W. M.(1989) Mol. Endocrinol. 3, 603-604) as a possible core for leucine-zipper formation. Our experimental studies combine cross-linking and CD analysis. Cross-linking establishes that the 1013-1056 fragment forms a stable homodimer in solution. Effects of increasing peptide concentration on CD spectra confirm that only the 1013-1056 fragment can undergo a coiled-coil stabilization from an isolated α-helix. Unfolding experiments further show that the coiled-coil is more stable in guanidium chloride than in urea. Values of −6.8 and −7.4 kcal/mol for the dimerization free energy are determined by thermal and urea unfolding, respectively. These are strikingly similar to the value recently found for the dissociation/reassociation of the entire yeast topoisomerase II from sedimentation equilibrium experiments (Lamhasni, S., Larsen, A. K., Barray, M., Monnot, M., Delain, E., and Fermandjian, S.(1995) Biochemistry 34, 3632-3639), although their significance relatively to topoisomerase II undoubtedly requires further analysis.

DNA topoisomerases II perform topological changes of DNA, such as catenation/decatenation, knotting/unknotting, and modification of the surpercoiling, by passing an intact double helix of DNA through a transient double-stranded break made in a second helix of DNA(1Wang J.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 665-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (1635) Google Scholar, 2Osheroff N. Pharmacol. Ther. 1989; 41: 223-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). These enzymes are implicated in DNA replication, recombination, and DNA transcription and are essential in mitosis and meiosis by intervening in condensation/decondensation and segregation of chromosomes. They further exhibit structural roles by probable associations to chromatin as they are a major component of the nuclear matrix. Topoisomerases II also present a crucial interest in the treatment of human cancers since they have been identified as the preferential cellular target for number of clinically important antitumoral drugs(3Corbett A.H. Osheroff N. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1993; 6: 585-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar).The active form of topoisomerase II has been proposed to be dimeric (4Goto T. Wang J.C.

Endocrinol. 1989; 3: 603-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) have suggested on the basis of sequence examination that a leucine-zipper (994-1021 segment) could be at the origin of dimerization of human topoisomerase II α, as also suggested by Caron and Wang(8Caron P.R. Wang J.C. Molecular Biology of DNA Topoisomerases. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1993: 1-18Google Scholar). This structure belongs to the widespread coiled-coil motif initially characterized by Crick in 1953 (9Crick F.H.C. Acta Crystallogr. 1953; 6: 689-697Crossref Google Scholar) and consisting of several amphipathic α-helices wrapped around each other in a slightly left-handed supercoil(10Cohen C. Parry D.A.D.

An extensively analyzed leucine-zipper is given by the yeast transcriptional factor GCN4 (11O'Shea E.K. Klemm J.D. Kim P.S. Alber T.

Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 2891-2894Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar).The coiling of α-helices optimizes the interchain packing of apolar residues and also allows specific interchain ionic interactions in proteins as varied as fibrous, globular, or membrane-spanning molecules. The most striking feature of coiled-coil helices is the 4-3 or 3-4 hydrophobic repeat. This repeat, firstly identified by Hodges et al.(19Hodges R.S. Sodek J. Smillie L.B. Jurasek L. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1972; 37: 299-310Crossref Google Scholar), consists of a repeating heptad sequence designated by the letters a-g, in which the positions a and d usually present hydrophobic residues. The a and d residues fall on the same side of the helix and pack in a regular “knobs-into-holes” pattern along the dimerization interface(9Crick F.H.C. Acta Crystallogr. 1953; 6: 689-697Crossref Google Scholar, 11O'Shea E.K. Klemm J.D. Kim P.S. Alber T. Science. 1991; 254: 539-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (1273) Google Scholar). This creates a hydrophobic core, which is critical for the dimerization process. Some charged residues in e and g positions of adjacent heptads could stabilize the dimer and contribute to the specificity of dimerization through electrostatic interactions(20O'Shea E.K. Lumb K.J. Kim P.S. Curr. Biol. 1993; 3: 658-667Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar, 21Vinson C.R. Hai T. Boyd M.S. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 1047-1058Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar).Here, we tested the reality of a coiled-coil motif in human topoisomerase II α allowing its dimerization. Secondary structure predictions by the Garnier Osguthorpe Robson (GOR) method (22Garnier J. Osguthorpe D.J. Robson B. J. Mol. Biol. 1978; 120: 97-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (3401) Google Scholar, 23Biou V. Gibrat J.-F. Levin J. Robson B. Garnier J. Protein Eng. 1988; 2: 185-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar) as well as circular dichroism experiments led us to discard the sequence 994-1021 proposed by Zwelling and Perry (7Zwelling L.A. Perry W.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1989; 3: 603-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) and permitted instead the identification of a 44-amino acid segment(1013-1056) characterized by both a high α-helix potential and five 4-3 hydrophobic repeats typical of coiled-coil motives. Glutaraldehyde cross-linking, detailed circular dichroism analysis, and derived thermodynamic results confirmed the dimeric coiled-coil structure of the 1013-1056 fragment in solution.MATERIALS AND METHODSPeptide Synthesis and PurificationThe 1013-1056 sequence peptide from human topoisomerase II α (NH2-T1013VLDILRDLFELRLKYYGLRKEWLLGMLGAESAKLNNQARFILE1056-COOH) was prepared together with the 994-1021 fragment (NH2-V987FKLQTSLTCNSMVLFDHVGCLKKYDTVLDILRDLF1022-COOH) according to solid phase synthesis on an Applied Biosystems model 431A peptide synthesizer using Fmoc (9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl) chemistry with 4-hydroxymethyl-phenoxymethyl-copolystyrene, 1% divinylbenzene resin and 2-(1H-benzotriazol-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate activation. The peptides were cleaved from the resin by a trifluoroacetic acid/1,2-ethanedithiol/thioanisole treatment for 2 h at room temperature. The crude peptide was purified by high performance liquid chromatography on a Beckman System Gold apparatus using two different columns successively: a reverse-phase (RP) 1The abbreviations used are: RPreverse-phaseTFEtrifluoroethanolPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisGdnHClguanidine hydrochloride. 1 C8 Aquapore (22 × 1 cm; 20-εm particles; 330-Å porosity) with a linear gradient of 0-80% acetonitrile/water (with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid); followed by a RP C18 Spherisorb (25 × 1 cm; 2-εm particles; 300-Å porosity) with a linear gradient of 0-100% acetonitrile/water (with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid). In both cases, the flow rate was 4 ml/min. Peptide purity was estimated higher than 90% by amino acid analysis (6 N HCl; 1 h at 150°C) on a Beckman model 6300 amino acid analyzer, by analytical high performance liquid chromatography using a RP C18 Nucleosyl column (25 × 0.46 cm; 5-εm particles; 300-Å porosity) with a linear gradient of 0-100% acetonitrile/water (with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid) with a flow rate of 1 ml/min and by Edman degradation on an Applied Biosystems model 477A sequencing apparatus.Glutaraldehyde Cross-linkingThe glutaraldehyde cross-linking reaction was carried out at 20°C. The reaction mixture contained 50 εM (260 εg/ml) of 1013-1056 peptide and 0.001% (v/v) glutaraldehyde. A control was achieved with 260 εg/ml lysozyme. This protein both behaves as a monomeric molecule at any concentration and presents an appropriate molecular weight (14,300) to follow the association intermediates of our fragment. Aliquots of the reaction mixture (10 εl) were taken at different times (0, 30, 60, 120, and 180 min) and were mixed with 2 εl of 1.5 M sodium borohydride. The reaction was stopped, each time, by boiling after addition of 38 εl of sample buffer (0.125 M Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 4% SDS, 20% glycerol, 100 mM DTT (dithiothreitol), and 0.01% bromphenol blue). 16 εl of cross-linking products were run on a sodium dodecyl sulfate-16.5% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) according to the protocol of Schägger and von Jagow (24Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10439) Google Scholar). The gel resolution was increased by adding a 10% spacing gel between stacking and separating gels. Finally, the separated products were revealed by silver staining(25Blum H. Beier H. Gross H.J. Electrophoresis. 1987; 8: 93-99Crossref Scopus (3729) Google Scholar).Circular DichroismCircular dichroism spectra were recorded on a Jobin-Yvon Mark IV high sensitivity dichrograph linked to a PC microprocessor. Optical cells with path lengths of 10, 1, and 0.1 mm were placed in a thermostable cell holder. All spectra were recorded with a 1-nm step and were base-line corrected. Circular dichroism measurements are reported as mean residue molar ellipticity [θ] (deg•cm2•dmol−1). The relative content in α-helix was deduced according to Zhong and Johnson(26Zhong L. Johnson W.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4462-4465Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar) : %α-helix = Δ∊222nm×(−10), where Δ∊222nm is the circular dichroism per residue at 222 nm and is related to [θ]222 by: Δ∊222nm = [θ]222/3300. The concentration of the stock solution of 1013-1056 peptide was determined at pH > 12, 20°C, from UV absorption in the aromatic region. Such a high basic medium was necessary in order to complete the ionization of the two tyrosine residues present in the peptide; however, all the dilutions were made at pH 10, that was enough to achieve dissolution. Obviously, neutral pH would be preferred to conduct association/reassociation experiments. However, inspection of our dimer model does not suggest any significant change within the side-chain groups participating in the coiled-coil stabilization between pH 7 and pH 10. The peptide ellipticities were measured 1 h after dilution at the chosen concentrations, these lying from 0.1 to 1200 εM, and 10 min after changes of temperature. These laps of time allow to reach the new equilibrium. The stock solutions of guanidine hydrochloride (GdnHCl) and urea used for the unfolding experiments were 7.3 M and 8.8 M, respectively. These concentrations were determined with refractive index measurements(27Pace C.N. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 131: 266-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (2409) Google Scholar). For GdnHCl and urea unfolding experiments, the samples were allowed to equilibrate in the presence of different concentrations of denaturant for a minimum of 4 h at room temperature before measuring the ellipticity.Calculation of Thermodynamic Parameters from Thermal UnfoldingSupposing a transition between two states (folded dimer ⇒ unfolded monomer), the molar fraction of dimer was calculated from thermal unfolding curves as: α = ([θ] − [θ]M)/([θ]D− [θ]M) where [θ]M and [θ]D are the ellipticity at 220 nm associated to monomer and dimer, respectively, and [θ] is the ellipticity at 220 nm at the considered temperature. The values of [θ]M and [θ]D in the transition region were obtained by extrapolating the pre- and post-transition regions. The equilibrium constant, K, is expressed as: K = α/2C(1 −α)2 and, at Tm, KTm = 1/C [1], where C and Tm are the peptide concentration and the temperature at the half-transition, respectively(28Marky L.A. Breslauer K.J. Biopolymers. 1987; 26: 1601-1620Crossref PubMed Scopus (1097) Google Scholar). For any process at equilibrium, −RT lnK = ΔH0− TΔS0. Equation 1 provides an expression for K at Tm in terms of C. Plugging the equality given above, yields upon rearrangement: 1/Tm = R lnC/ΔH0+ΔS0/ΔH0. This equation corresponds to a straight line when the reciprocal of the melting temperature (1/Tm) is plotted against the natural logarithm of the peptide concentration (lnC). The slope and the intercept yield ΔH0 and ΔS0, respectively.Calculation of Thermodynamic Parameters from GdnHCl and Urea UnfoldingsThe denaturation curves were analyzed by assuming that the transition between folding dimer/unfolding monomer is a two-state event (F2⇒ 2U). An equilibrium constant, Ku, can be thus obtained at each individual GdnHCl and urea concentrations by: Ku = 2 C (1 − fN)2/fN, where C is the peptide concentration and fN is the folded fraction as determined from the ellipticity at 220 nm, namely: fN = ([θ] − [θ]θ)/([θ]N− [θ]θ) (27Pace C.N. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 131: 266-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (2409) Google Scholar). [θ]θ and [θ]N are the ellipticities of the unfolded and native states, respectively, and [θ] is the observed ellipticity at any particular denaturant (GdnHCl or urea) concentration. The free energy of unfolding in the absence of denaturant (ΔGu H2O) was estimated by a linear extrapolation of the unfolding free energy at each individual denaturant concentration to zero denaturant concentration, according to: ΔGu = ΔGu H2O − m[denaturant], where m is the slope of the straight line, dΔGu/d[denaturant].RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONIdentification of a Coiled-coil Motif in Human Topoisomerase II αOriginally, the purpose of this work was to experimentally verify the reality of the leucine-zipper structure proposed on sequence examination grounds by Zwelling and Perry (7Zwelling L.A. Perry W.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1989; 3: 603-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) for the 994-1021 segment of the human topoisomerase II α. In this aim, we estimated the capacity of this sequence to adopt an α-helical structure using the procedure of Biou et al.(23Biou V. Gibrat J.-F. Levin J. Robson B. Garnier J. Protein Eng. 1988; 2: 185-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar) based on the combination of two prediction methods: one by homology and the other by GOR III(22Garnier J. Osguthorpe D.J. Robson B. J. Mol. Biol. 1978; 120: 97-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (3401) Google Scholar). The results indicated that the 994-1021 segment was unfavorable to helical structurization. Instead, we found that the 1013-1056 segment located in the minimal region necessary to the activity of topoisomerase II (29Caron P.R. Watt P. Wang J.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3197-3207Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) and which partially overlaps the 994-1021 segment exhibited a high probability to be structured in an α-helix.The method of Lupas et al.(30Lupas A. Van Dyke M. Stock J. Science. 1991; 252: 1162-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (3452) Google Scholar) was then applied to the 1013-1056 sequence as well as to the other α-helical predicted segments of human topoisomerase II α in order to evaluate their propensity for the coiled-coil structure. This method is based on the relative frequency of occurrence of amino acids at each position of the coiled-coil heptad repeat. The 1013-1056 segment presents the potentiality of having two possible 4-3 hydrophobic heptad repeats (noted as casesI and II in Fig. 1A). Almost all the residues found in positions a and d are of hydrophobic nature. Thus, they may form a hydrophobic interface that stabilizes the coiled-coil. In comparison, even if in the 994-1021 segment proposed as a possible leucine-zipper structure by Zwelling and Perry the leucine residues are found in the desirable d position, more than half of the residues in a position appear unfavorable to dimerization.It has been established that the ratio of charged to apolar residues is indicative of the shape of protein containing a coiled-coil(31Cohen D.R. Parry D.A.D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1986; 11: 245-248Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (301) Google Scholar). In the 1013-1056 segment, the positions b, c, e, f, and g are not really hydrophilic and the ratio of charged to apolar residues is found equal to 0.6. This could account for a coiled-coil integrated in a globular protein, which appears to be the case of topoisomerase II(32Lamhasni S. Larsen A.K. Barray M. Monnot M. Delain E. Fermandjian S. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 3632-3639Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), as it has been shown that the apolar groups can be more easily accommodated in the core of a globular unit than in a cylindrical one. Finally, case II, shown under the wheel representation in Fig. 1B, appears more appealing than case I as it displays a conservation of residues at a and d positions in DNA topoisomerases II of several species as diverse as the human and the yeast ones (Fig. 1A).Glutaraldehyde Cross-linkingFast fixation of protein association intermediates has been applied with success because of the accuracy and sensitivity of the method (reviewed in (33Jaenicke R. Rudolph R. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 131: 218-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar)). We used the 1013-1056 peptide at 50 εM concentration, at which the peptide was shown to adopt a coiled-coil structure by circular dichroism (see below). The existence of cross-linked species was determined by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2). Formation of a significant amount of dimer was detected immediately after mixing the peptide with glutaraldehyde, and the dimer remained the major oligomeric species from 0 to 3 h. After 3 h, we also detected small amounts of trimer, tetramer, and pentamer.Figure 2:A polyacrylamide-SDS gel of the 1013-1056 human topoisomerase II α peptide submitted to glutaraldehyde cross-linking (see “Materials and Methods”). The products were revealed by silver staining analysis. The positions of molecular size standards (kilodaltons) are shown on the left, and those of the predicted oligomers formed by the 1013-1056 peptide are indicated on the right. T and MW, respectively, correspond to a control without cross-linker and to the molecular size standards.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The present cross-linking results can be considered as significant for the following reasons. First, low concentrations of cross-linker and peptide prevented nonspecific reactions. Second, no complex larger than the pentamer was detected even after 3 h, with a relative amount remaining insignificant compared to cross-linking of the dimer. This accounts for the fact that the dimer is the most stable complex and that formation of higher order oligomers is barely due to interactions of the dimer with peptide molecules in its surrounding. Third, no cross-linking of the monomeric molecule lysozyme used as control was detected under similar conditions. Thus, the glutaraldehyde cross-linking and subsequent SDS-PAGE experiments confirmed the autoassociative properties of the 1013-1056 peptide and pointed out the predominance of dimer over the largest oligomeric species.Circular Dichroism SpectroscopyThe ability of the 1013-1056 peptide to form a two-stranded α-helical coiled-coil was monitored by circular dichroism. Two criteria were used in the analysis: the helical content and the degree of coiling. The first was calculated from the intensity of the molar ellipticity at 220 nm, while the second was estimated from the ratio between the intensities of the bands at 220 and 208 nm. The ratio [θ]220/[θ]208 is about 0.8 for a single-stranded α-helix and about 1.0 for a two-stranded α-helical coiled-coil(34Lau S.Y.M. Taneja A.K. Hodges R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 13253-13261Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Changes of this ratio have been explained as follows. The amide nπ* transition (220-nm CD band) is essentially responsive to the α-helical content(26Zhong L. Johnson W.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4462-4465Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the amide ππ* excitation band at 208 nm polarizes parallel to the helix axis and is sensitive to whether the α-helix is single-stranded or an interacting helix as in the case of the two-stranded coiled-coil. The decrease in the parallel band intensity, together, in fact, with a red shift of its maximum(35Cooper T.M. Woody R.W. Biopolymers. 1990; 30: 657-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar), must reflect the conversion of a rigid single-stranded α-helix to an α-helical coiled-coil structure. Furthermore, clear-cut thermodynamic data reflecting the dissociation/reassociation may be obtained from CD experiments using as variables polypeptide concentration, temperature, or chemical denaturants.Peptide Concentration EffectsThe 1013-1056 peptide CD spectra show two minima at 208-210 and 222 nm indicative of a significant proportion of the peptide residues in the α-helical conformation(36Woody R.W. Peptides (Elmsford). 1985; 7: 15-114Google Scholar). The molar ellipticity value at 220 nm, [θ]220, became more negative with increasing peptide concentration (Fig. 3A). The concentration value at the half-transition increased with the temperature (5, 9, and 24 εM peptide at 6, 20, and 40°C, respectively). An isolated α-helix appears marginally stable in aqueous solution, and its stabilization requires interactions provided by tertiary and quaternary structures. Thus, the [θ]220 concentration dependence shown by the peptide results from the stabilization of the α-helix through its oligomerization. As the concentration of peptide is increased, the monomer-oligomer equilibrium is shifted toward the formation of oligomer which increases the α-helical content. At 200 εM peptide concentration, CD spectral analysis with the method of Zhong et al.(28Marky L.A. Breslauer K.J. Biopolymers. 1987; 26: 1601-1620Crossref PubMed Scopus (1097) Google Scholar) provides ∼50% of α-helix content. However, above 200 εM, the ellipticity at 220 nm becomes concentration-independent, suggesting the complete association of the fragment. We may note that, in the same conditions, the CD spectra of the 994-1021 fragment reflected an α-helix content of approximately 15%, which does not vary with the peptide concentration between 166 εM and 5.2 mM. This confirms the weak potential for the corresponding segment in topoisomerase II to adopt a stable coiled-coil structure.Figure 3:A, dependence curves of the mean residue molar ellipticity at 220 nm versus the 1013-1056 peptide concentration (logarithmic scale) in water, pH 10 at: 5°C (■), 20°C (□), and 40°C (○).

Moreover, the peptide concentration corresponding to the half-transition was found to be the same (6 εM), whether the transition was monitored from the ellipticity at 220 nm or the ratio [θ]220/[θ]208. We also observed the expected red shift in the maximum of the parallel band (208 to 210 nm), which, when added to the other effects, accounts for the stabilization of a coiled-coil structure from an isolated α-helix.Thermal UnfoldingOccurrence of an isodichroic point at 203 nm during the thermal denaturation of the 1013-1056 peptide (Fig. 4A) provides support for the existence of a predominant two-state structural transition, which according to the above results is presumed to correspond to the conversion of an α-helical coiled-coil into an unfolded monomer. [θ]220 decreased with increasing temperature, but the phenomenon was found quantitatively reversible with the decrease of temperature. The thermal curves at different peptide concentrations showed discernible cooperative transitions. A clear dependence of the melting temperature, Tm, on peptide concentration could be detected (Fig. 4B) with Tm values of 33, 53, 67, and 77°C for peptide concentrations of 16, 50, 100, and 160 εM, respectively. This concentration dependence of Tmalso characterizes an oligomeric structure. The thermodynamic parameters were determined from the thermal unfolding curves according to the procedure described under “Materials and Methods” (Fig. 4B, inset). The relative magnitude of ΔH0 (−11.3 kcal/mol) and TΔS0 (−4.5 kcal/mol) indicate that the coiled-coil formation is enthalpically driven. The free energy ΔG0 was found equal to −6.8 kcal/mol. This free energy is similar to those values determined for α-helical coiled-coil models (37Krylov D. Mikhailenko I. Vinson C.

The other pathway involves activation of a phosphatidylcholine-specific phospholipase C, which regulates stimulation of protein kinase C and an acidic sphingomyelinase, which in turn mediates induction of the transcription factor NF-κB(15Wiegmann K.

Most cell surface receptors studied, e.g. tyrosine kinase receptors like the PDGF receptor, are activated by ligand-induced dimerization of the receptor subunits (for reviews, see Refs. 21 and 22). Unlike these receptors, TR55 (and probably most other members of the TNF receptor superfamily) can form a trimeric structure induced by binding of a trimeric ligand(23Banner D.W. D'Arcy A. Janes W.

However, the trimeric structure of TR55 observed in x-ray diffraction studies may represent only one of several possible conformations in intact cells(26Smith C.A. Farrah T. Goodwin R.G. Cell. 1994; 76: 959-962Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1836) Google Scholar). To determine whether trimer formation of the p55 TNF receptor is absolutely required for signaling functions, the extracellular and transmembrane domain of the TR55 was replaced by domains of an unrelated molecule that is not activated by a trimeric ligand. The PDGFR β was chosen because it represents one of the best characterized receptor tyrosine kinases(22Williams L.T. Science. 1989; 243: 1564-1570Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar, 27Heldin C.-H. Westermark B. Trends Genet. 1989; 5: 108-111Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). In addition, it has clearly been demonstrated that the homo-dimeric structure of the receptor ligand (in this case PDGF-BB) activates the receptor by dimerizing two subunits(28Heldin C.-H. Ernlund A. Rorsman C. Ronnstrand L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8905-8912Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Bishayee S. Majumdar S. Khire J. Das M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11699-11705Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Here, we demonstrate that PDGF binds to the PDGFR-TR55 chimeric receptor stably expressed in NMuMG cells and induces a cytotoxic response in these transfectants as well as nuclear translocation of NF-κB. These results support the concept that dimerization of TR55 is sufficient to mediate TNF-specific responses. The expression vectors pADB-TR55, containing the full-length human p55 TNF receptor cDNA, pAD-CMV1, and pSVRCD4 have been described(6Himmler A. Maurer-Fogy I. Krönke M. Scheurich P. Pfizenmaier K.

Adolf (Boehringer Ingelheim, Vienna), and human recombinant BB-chain PDGF was obtained from Drs. B. Ratzkin and L. Souza (Amgen, Thousand Oaks). Antibody SM14 was kindly provided by Dr. J. B. Bolen (Bristol-Myers Squibb, Princeton). Anti-PDGF β receptor monoclonal antibodies were purchased from Affinity Research Products (Nottingham). The extracellular domain and parts of the cytoplasmic domain of TR55 were removed from the expression vector pADB-TR55 by digestion with SalI/HindIII. The extracellular and transmembrane domain of the murine PDGF receptor was recovered from the expression vector pSVRCD4 as an EcoRI-HindIII DNA fragment and ligated into the SalI-HindIII site of pADB-TR55 after treatment with Klenow polymerase to restore the reading frame. The resulting plasmid, pADB-PTR55, was sequenced to ensure that the fusion had occurred in frame (see Fig. 1). In vitro transcription-translation revealed that the chimeric gene was translated into a protein of the appropriate size.2 2D. Adam, U. Keβler, and M. Krönke, unpublished observation. NMuMG cells (32Owens R.B. Smith H.S. Hackett A.J. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1974; 53: 261-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) were obtained from ATCC. NMuMG cells stably transfected with the full-length murine PDGF receptor cDNA (cell line RI) were a generous gift from Dr. J. Escobedo (University of California, San Francisco). Cells were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% bovine calf serum, 50 εg/ml penicillin, and 50 εg/ml streptomycin (Life Technologies, Inc.). Stably transfected NMuMG cells expressing the PDGFR-TR55 chimeric receptor were obtained by cotransfection of pADB-PTR55 with BMGNeo (33Karasuyama H. Melchers F. Eur. J. Immunol. 1988; 18: 97-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (1080) Google Scholar) using electroporation at 960 microfarads/280 volts and subsequent selection with 1000 εg/ml Geneticin (Life Technologies, Inc.). Transfectants expressing vector alone without insert were generated by cotransfecting pAD-CMV1 with BMGNeo. Cells were detached by incubation in PBS, 2 mM EDTA at 37°C for 15 min, washed, and resuspended in cold PBS with 0.2% FCS and 0.02% sodium azide. Assays were set up in triplicate as follows: 1 ng of 125I-radiolabeled human recombinant BB-chain PDGF (DuPont NEN; specific activity 1480 kBq/εg) or human recombinant TNF-α (DuPont NEN; specific activity 1630 kBq/εg) was added to 3 × 105 cells in a total volume of 300 εl of PBS/FCS/azide with or without a 1000-fold excess of unlabeled ligand. Cells were incubated at 0°C for 2 h and washed twice in cold PBS/FCS/azide, and total as well as nonspecific binding was analyzed in a γ-counter (Canberra Packard). For Scatchard analyses, cells were incubated with serial dilutions of labeled ligand (0.125-5 ng/well) in a total volume of 300 εl of PBS/FCS/azide with or without unlabeled ligand. Cells were washed twice in cold PBS/FCS/azide and analyzed in a γ-counter (Canberra Packard). Cells were lysed in TNE buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 1% Nonidet P-40, 2 mM EDTA) containing 10 εg/ml aprotinin/leupeptin. The cell lysates were denatured in sample buffer and boiled, and 25 εg of cell protein per lane were resolved by electrophoresis on 7% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. After electrophoretic transfer to nitrocellulose, reactive proteins were detected using anti-PDGF β receptor monoclonal antibodies (Affinity Research Products) and the ECL detection kit (Amersham Corp.). 2 × 104 cells/well were seeded in 24-well plates and kept in DMEM with 5% FCS for 3 days. After further incubation in quiescing medium (DMEM with 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 5 εg/ml transferrin) for 1 day, cells were stimulated by adding 2 nM human recombinant BB-chain PDGF or 0.6 nM murine recombinant TNF-α for 16 h, pulsed with 18.5 kBq [methyl-3H]thymidine (DuPont NEN) for 1 h, washed in PBS three times, lysed in 0.1% SDS, and counted in a scintillation counter (Canberra Packard). 104 cells were seeded in flat-bottom 96-well plates and incubated overnight in 100 εl of DMEM, 10% FCS to allow cells to adhere. The cells were then preincubated in medium with 100 ng/ml actinomycin D for 2 h before serial dilutions of murine recombinant TNF-α or human recombinant BB-chain PDGF were added. After 18 h, 20 εl of MTT (Sigma, 2.5 mg/ml in PBS) were added, and incubation was continued for an additional 2 h to allow metabolization of MTT to 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenylformazan, which was solubilized with isopropanol-HCl (24:1) and colorimetrically determined at 570 nm in a microplate reader (MWG-Biotech). 3 × 106 cells/10-cm dish were stimulated by adding human recombinant BB-chain PDGF or murine recombinant TNF-α to a final concentration of 10 nM (PDGF) or 0.6 nM (TNF). The cells were incubated at 37°C for 20 min or for the indicated time, washed twice in ice-cold PBS, and harvested with a cell scraper. Nuclear extracts were prepared as described(34Kruppa G. Thoma B. Machleidt T. Wiegmann K. Krönke M. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 3152-3157PubMed Google Scholar). Electrophoretic mobility shift assays were performed by incubating 3 εg of nuclear extract with 4 εg of poly(dI-dC) (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) in binding buffer (5 mM HEPES, pH 7.8, 5 mM MgCl2, 50 mM KCl, 0.5 mM dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol in a total volume of 20 εl for 20 min at room temperature. Then, end-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotide probe (NF-κB-specific oligonucleotide containing two tandemly arranged NF-κB binding sites of the HIV-1 long terminal repeat enhancer (5’-ATCAGGGACTTTCCGCTGGGGACTTTCCG-3’), 1 × 104 to 5 × 104 cpm) was added, and the reaction mixture was incubated for 7 min. The samples were separated on native 6% polyacrylamide gels in low ionic strength buffer (0.25 × Tris borate-EDTA). For competition experiments, unlabeled or a mutated oligonucleotide containing altered κB sites (5’-GATCACTCACTTTCCGCTTGCTCACTTTCCAG-3’) was added before the initial 20-min incubation. The PDGFR-TR55 receptor was generated by fusing the extracellular and transmembrane domain of the murine PDGF receptor to amino acids 243-426 of the human p55 TNF receptor cytoplasmic domain (see Fig. 1). The chimeric receptor was cloned into the expression vector pAD-CMV1 under the transcriptional control of the cytomegalovirus promoter and 5’ to the simian virus 40 polyadenylation site. The resulting plasmid was designated pADB-PTR55 (see “Materials and Methods”). A transient expression system was initially utilized to monitor induction of NF-κB in NMuMG cells transfected with pADB-PTR55 and a 4 × immunoglobulin/HIV-κB chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter plasmid(35Perkins N.D. Schmid R.M. Duckett C.S. Leung K. Rice N.R. Nabel G.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 89: 1529-1533Crossref Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Due to low transfection efficiencies, however, this system was not suitable to conduct detailed studies of the potential signal transduction through the PDGFR-TR55 chimera (data not shown). Therefore, parental NMuMG cells, which neither express detectable PDGF receptor mRNA nor PDGF receptors at the cell surface, were stably transfected with plasmid pADB-PTR55, and Geneticin-resistant colonies were cloned. A total of 32 clones was analyzed for cell surface expression of the PDGFR-TR55 chimeric receptor in binding assays for 125I-PDGF. Three positive clones (designated PT55-1 to PT55-3) were characterized further. As a control, transfectants were selected that contain the expression vector pAD-CMV1 without insert. Of those, clone PAD-1, together with parental NMuMG cells, served as a negative control in the subsequent experiments. Parental NMuMG cells, clones PAD-1, PT55-1 to PT55-3, and the NMuMG transfectant line RI expressing the full-length PDGF receptor were analyzed for expression of endogenous murine p55 TNF receptors using human 125I-TNF. All cell lines examined specifically bound 125I-TNF, confirming endogenous TR55 expression (Fig. 2A). When analyzed for the binding of 125I-PDGF, both NMuMG and PAD-1 cells proved negative, while RI cells demonstrated significant binding. Clones PT55-1 to PT55-3 did also prove positive for binding of 125I-PDGF, though at a lower level than that seen with the full-length PDGF receptor in RI cells (Fig. 2B). Scatchard analyses of clones PT55-1, PT55-2, and PT55-3 demonstrated high affinity binding of radiolabeled PDGF-BB to the PDGFR-TR55 receptor (Fig. 2C), comparable to the affinity described for PDGF binding to the wild type PDGF receptor on murine 3T3 cells(36Williams L.T. Tremble P.M. Lavin M.F. Sunday M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 5287-5294Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, Scatchard analyses of RI cells demonstrated an almost identical binding affinity for the transfected wild type PDGF receptor (Fig. 2C), indicating that the reduced levels of 125I-PDGF binding observed with PT55 cells result from reduced numbers of the PDGFR-TR55 molecule rather than from an impaired binding capability of the receptor chimera. Reduced expression of PDGFR-TR55 is probably due to toxic effects of a highly expressed TR55 cytoplasmic domain(37Boldin M.P. Mett I.L. Varfolomeev E.E. Chumakov I. Shemer-Avni Y. Camonis J.H. Wallach D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 270: 387-391Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (351) Google Scholar). The expression of the PDGFR-TR55 chimeric receptor by clones PT55-1 to PT55-3 was additionally confirmed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis using antibody SM14 directed against the extracellular domain of the PDGF receptor (data not shown). Western blots using a monoclonal PDGF receptor antibody demonstrated the presence of a reactive band of 78 kDa, the predicted size for the PDGFR-TR55 chimera (Fig. 2D). As expected, this 78-kDa protein was not detected in NMuMG, RI, or PAD-1 cells. The full-length PDGF receptor in RI cells was masked by the presence of a cross-reactive band comigrating with the PDGF receptor. This band was observed in parental NMuMG cells as well as in 70Z/3 pre-B-cells, which both are negative for PDGF receptor expression (data not shown). PDGF is a potent mitogen for many cell types, while TNF exerts both proliferative and cytotoxic effects depending on the target cell. To determine the type of response the PDGFR-TR55 chimeric receptor would convey, we analyzed proliferative and cytotoxic effects of PDGF and TNF on parental NMuMG cells, PAD-1, RI, and PT55 transfectants. First, cells were assayed for PDGF- or TNF-mediated induction of DNA synthesis by [3H]thymidine incorporation assays (Fig. 3). Engagement of the endogenous TR55 by TNF did not induce any significant proliferation of either cell line. PDGF induced DNA synthesis in RI cells expressing the full-length PDGF receptor. In contrast, PDGF did not stimulate the proliferation of parental NMuMG cells, PAD-1 cells, or of clones PT55-1 to PT55-3 expressing the PDGFR-TR55 chimera. These results indicate that neither endogenous TR55 nor the PDGFR-TR55 receptor are able to mediate a proliferative response in these cells. TNF treatment of parental and transfected NMuMG cells resulted in cytotoxic effects (Fig. 4A), which is likely mediated through endogenous TR55. When PT55 clones expressing the PDGFR-TR55 chimera were treated with PDGF, a pronounced cytotoxic effect was elicited. In contrast, parental NMuMG, PAD-1, or RI cells did not show a cytotoxic response to PDGF (Fig. 4B). We finally examined whether the PDGFR-TR55 chimera was capable to mediate the activation of the transcription factor NF-κB, an important mediator of TNF responses. As shown in Fig. 5(lanes1-6), nuclear NF-κB activity in parental NMuMG and PAD-1 cells was markedly increased after stimulation of cells with TNF but not after PDGF treatment. In PT55 cells, NF-κB activation could be induced by both TNF and PDGF (Fig. 5, lanes7-24), and the kinetics of NF-κB activation were similar in any instance (data not shown). Competition experiments using oligonucleotides containing wild type or mutated NF-κB sites confirmed NF-κB binding activity induced by PDGF (Fig. 5, lanes17 and 18). The results of our study indicate that two key responses of TNF signaling pathways, cytotoxicity and induction of NF-κB, can be mediated solely by the TR55 cytoplasmic domain without requirement for extracellular or transmembrane sequences. Furthermore, dimerization of the TR55 cytoplasmic domain by a bivalent ligand, PDGF, is sufficient to activate the intrinsic functions of the receptor. This mode of activation ranges TR55 among the group of other receptors that are dimerized prior to activation, e.g. the epidermal growth factor receptor, the PDGFR, and many more(21Ullrich A. Schlessinger J. Cell. 1990; 61: 203-212Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4604) Google Scholar). Controversial data exist on the conformation of biologically active TR55. Earlier studies reported that TNF acts as a trimer (38Smith R.A. Baglioni C. J. Biol.

It is widely acknowledged from x-ray diffraction studies (23Banner D.W. D'Arcy A. Janes W. Gentz R. Schoenfeld H. Broger C. Loetscher H. Lesslauer W.

However, these studies have been performed on TR55 crystals and do not rule out the possibility that TR55 adopts other conformations (e.g. dimers) at the cell surface when bound to ligand. Active signaling of TR55 dimers might be deduced from cross-linking experiments with agonistic antibodies(39Engelmann H. Holtmann H. Brakebusch C. Avni Y.S. Sarov I. Nophar Y. Hadas E. Leitner O. Wallach D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14497-14504Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 40Espevik T. Brockhaus M. Loetscher H. Nonstad U. Shalaby R. J. Exp. Med. 1990; 171: 415-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). However, antibody cross-linking does not exclude the formation of trimeric or multimeric complexes. Obviously, antibody-mediated receptor clustering does not always correctly reflect results obtained by using physiologic ligands, which is illustrated by experiments in which the cytoplasmic domains of TR55 or Fas were fused to the extracellular domain of CD40. Cross-linking with agonistic CD40 antibodies did not activate the CD40-TR55 fusion proteins(30Clement M. Stamenkovic I. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 557-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Indeed, not any physiologic ligand can activate the TR55 cytoplasmic domain. A hybrid receptor consisting of the TR55 cytoplasmic domain fused to extracellular sequences of the CD44 hyaluronate receptor was incapable of inducing cell death after ligand-mediated cross-linking, supporting the conclusion that TR55 requires a specific type of oligomerization different from that of CD44(30Clement M. Stamenkovic I. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 557-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). While oligomerization through CD44 is apparently unable to activate TR55, PDGF-mediated cross-linking appears perfectly sufficient to activate the TR55 cytoplasmic domain. PDGF represents a classical dimeric ligand, that is, the plethora of data indicates that PDGF activates its receptor by dimerizing two receptor molecules(28Heldin C.-H. Ernlund A. Rorsman C. Ronnstrand L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8905-8912Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Bishayee S. Majumdar S. Khire J. Das M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11699-11705Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The same holds apparently true for the PDGFR-TR55 chimeric receptor. Since TR55 dimerization is obviously sufficient to elicit cytotoxicity and induction of NF-κB, one might speculate that signaling through a dimeric p55 TNF receptor employs the same pathways as signaling through the TR55 trimer. More knowledge is needed about the signaling events that take place following TR55 dimerization, e.g. which proteins associate with TR55, and if those proteins represent the same set that binds to an activated TR55 trimer or if different sets of associated proteins exist for different states of TR55 clustering. The identification and cloning of those proteins will provide essential information about the p55 TNF receptor signal transduction pathways. We thank H. Wagner for continuous support."

These processes correlate with expression of the retinoic acid receptor (RAR)β gene, which is induced through a retinoic acid response element (βRARE). We wished to determine which endogenous retinoid receptors (RARs and retinoid X receptors, RXRs) mediate induction of the RARβ gene. We show that RXRα and RXRβ are constitutively expressed. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays with nuclear extracts show specific binding to the βRARE (Complex I) in untreated cells, which can be supershifted by antibodies against RXRs but not by anti-RAR antibodies. After 48 h of treatment with retinoic acid, Complex I is replaced by a faster migrating Complex II, which can be supershifted by anti-RARβ and anti-RXRα antibodies. This suggests that induction of the RARβ gene is largely mediated by RXRs only. Accordingly, we also find that 9-cis RA, which activates both RAR and RXR, is a more potent inducer of the RARβ gene than RA, which only activates RAR. After 48 h, all RXRs appear to be titrated by the newly synthesized RARβ into an RARβ•RXR heterodimer complex. Thus, it appears that the βRARE is sequentially occupied by RXR dimers and RAR•RXR heterodimers. S91 melanoma cells are growth arrested and differentiate when treated with retinoids.

RARs and RXRs bind specific DNA elements in the promoter region of target genes called RA response elements (RAREs). The majority of RAREs appears to consist of two direct repeats (DR), or half-sites, of the sequence AGGTCA spaced by five nucleotides (DR5)(15Naar A.M. Boutin J.-M. Lipkin S.M. Yu V.C. Holloway J.F.

Numerous in vitro experiments have shown that RARs and RXRs bind with low affinity as homodimers to DR5, but, when mixed, RAR•RXR heterodimers can form that bind with much higher affinity than either homodimer. These data, together with transfection experiments in mammalian cells and yeast, suggest that the heterodimer is the transcriptionally active species when both partners are present (17Yu V.C.

However, it was recently found that an element with a spacing of one nucleotide (DR1) is also bound by RAR•RXR heterodimers but in a transcriptionally inactive conformation. In contrast, in the presence of 9-cis-RA, RXR homodimers specifically can bind and activate transcription from promoters with this element(27Mangelsdorf D.J. Umesono K. Kliewer S.A. Borgmeyer U.

An interesting aspect of retinoids is their effect on differentiation of neoplastic cells, both in vivo and in vitro (1, 3 and references therein). For instance, there are over 200 retinoid-sensitive tumor cell lines that could provide a useful model system to gain insight into how retinoids affect malignant growth(29Amos B. Lotan R. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 189: 100-109Google Scholar). In this report, we have focused on the murine melanoma cell line S91. Upon treatment with RA, these cells become growth arrested and display an enhanced differentiated phenotype, exemplified by the formation of more and longer dendritic extensions and an increase in melanin synthesis(30Lotan R. Giotta G. Nork E. Nicolson G.L. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1978; 60: 1035-1041Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 31Lotan R. Lotan D. J. Cell. Physiol. 1981; 106: 179-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 32Clifford J.L. Petkovich M. Chambon P. Lotan R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1990; 4: 1546-1555Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The occurrence of malignant melanoma has been steadily on the rise(33Goldstein A.M. Tucker M.A. Curr. Opin. Oncol. 1993; 5: 358-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), and prognosis is still poor when discovered in advanced state. Unfortunately, little is known about the molecular events of malignant change in melanocytes, and S91 cells may be very useful for these studies. Previous reports have shown that RARα and RARγ are constitutively expressed in S91 cells but that RARβ is rapidly induced by treatment with retinoids. RARβ expression is maximal after 24 h and is independent of de novo protein synthesis(32Clifford J.L. Petkovich M. Chambon P. Lotan R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1990; 4: 1546-1555Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 34Redfern C.P.F. Daly A.K. Latham J.A.E. Todd C. FEBS Lett. 1990; 273: 19-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Interestingly, retinoids that fail to induce RARβ do not cause growth arrest(32Clifford J.L. Petkovich M. Chambon P. Lotan R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1990; 4: 1546-1555Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), and differentiation becomes phenotypically apparent only after RARβ mRNA levels have reached their highest levels(30Lotan R. Giotta G. Nork E. Nicolson G.L. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1978; 60: 1035-1041Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). One interpretation is that a certain threshold level of RARβ is required to facilitate differentiation of S91 cells. It is, therefore, important to know which proteins regulate RARβ expression. Retinoid-dependent induction of the RARβ2 gene (the major RARβ isoform) is mediated through an RARE in the RARβ2 promoter (βRARE, a DR5-like element), which has been well characterized in in vitro studies(35Hoffmann B.

In this report, we investigated which endogenous, intracellular RAR•RXR isoforms mediate the retinoid-dependent induction of the RARβ gene in S91 cells. Our data provide evidence that, surprisingly, a complex containing RXRs, but not RAR•RXR heterodimers, largely regulates RARβ gene expression. Poly(A)+ RNA was extracted from cells grown at about 60% confluency in 5-8 flasks (162 cm2) for each time point, using a poly(A)+ RNA isolation kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Total RNA was isolated from 2 flasks for each time point according to (38Chirgwin J.M. Przybyla A.E. MacDonald R.J. Rutter W.J. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5294-5299Crossref PubMed Scopus (16654) Google Scholar). 1 εg of poly(A)+ RNA or 15 εg of total RNA was subjected to electrophoresis through a denaturing formaldehyde-agarose gel (1%), transferred to a nylon membrane (Duralon-UV, Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) according to (39Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar), and cross-linked in a Stratagene Stratalinker. Northern blots were hybridized with the following DNA restriction fragments, which had been gel-purified and random-primed in the presence of [α-32P]dCTP: RARβ, EcoRI-EagI fragment from pSG5RARβ; RXRα, AvaI fragment from pBSRXRα; RXRβ, EcoRI-NheI fragment from pBSRXRβ and a cyclophilin BamHI fragment. Blots were washed in 0.1 × SSC, 0.1% SDS at 55°C and autoradiographed. Quantitation of Northern blots was performed on a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager (Sunnyvale, CA) using ImageQuant software (version 3.3). Procedures for obtaining nuclear extracts from cells (grown in 1-2 flasks (162 cm2) at about 60% confluency for each time point) and EMSA conditions were essentially performed as described previously(40Yen P.M. Darling D.S. Carter R.L. Forgione M. Umeda P.K. Chin W.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3565-3568Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); typically, 1.5-3 εg of nuclear extract was used. Incubation with gel-purified 32P-end-labeled oligonucleotides was performed in the presence of 1 εg of salmon sperm DNA. The reaction mix minus probe was incubated for 15 min at room temperature; probe (50,000 cpm, ∼5 fmol) was added and incubated for another 30 min, and then put on ice for 10 min before electrophoresis on 4% polyacrylamide gel. For antibody supershifts, 1 εl of antiserum was added at this point and incubated at 4°C for another 2 h before electrophoresis. The specificity and characterization of the RXR antibodies will be described elsewhere(54Sugawara A. Yen P.M. Qi Y. Lechan R.M. Chin W.W. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 1766-1774Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The RARβ antibody does not cross-react with RARα or RARγ. The RARc antibody reacts about equally well with RARα and RARβ, less well with RARγ in immunoprecipitations, and about equally well with all three RAR-isoforms in EMSA (data not shown).2 2B.

A 1:1000 dilution of primary antibody was used, followed by a 1:2000 dilution of a peroxidase-coupled goat-anti-rabbit secondary antibody. Visualization of bands was done by using an ECL detection kit (Amersham Corp.) Exposure time was about 30 s on x-ray film. S91 cells (ATTC CCL 53.1) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum at 37°C in 5% CO2 in humidified air. Solutions of RA and 9-cis-RA were made fresh every 24 h in ethanol. Plates that did not receive ligand received ethanol instead. Working concentrations were 10−6 or 10−5M, and plates were kept in the dark as much as possible. The oligonucleotide with the βRARE was cloned in the HindIII site of pBluescript and confirmed by dideoxy sequencing. The coding strand was labeled by cutting the plasmid with XhoI followed by Klenow-fill-in in the presence of [α-32P]dCTP, dTTP, and dGTP. The plasmid was then cut with SpeI. Similarly, the noncoding strand was labeled by digesting the plasmid with SpeI and Klenow-fill-in in the presence of [α-32P]dCTP and dTTP followed by digestion with XhoI. Both probes were gel-purified and chemically modified by dimethyl sulfate or KMnO4, essentially as described previously(41Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Short Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, New York, NY1992Google Scholar, 55Ikeda M. Rhee M. Chin W.W. Endocrinology. 1995; 135: 1628-1638Crossref Scopus (45) Google Scholar). EMSA was performed in 6% polyacrylamide gel with 6 εg and 3 εg of the nuclear extracts at the 0 (Complex I) and 48 (Complex II) h time points, respectively. Free and bound probe was eluted, digested as described(41Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Short Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, New York, NY1992Google Scholar, 55Ikeda M. Rhee M. Chin W.W. Endocrinology. 1995; 135: 1628-1638Crossref Scopus (45) Google Scholar), and run on a 8% DNA sequence gel. Quantitation of individual bands was performed by PhosphorImager scanning analysis, and normalized for loading differences. As a first step in the analysis of the βRARE, we decided to complete the retinoid receptor inventory in S91 cells by analyzing the nature of the expressed RXR species. Poly(A)+ RNA was isolated from cells that were untreated (0 h) or treated with 1 εM RA for the indicated time period (Fig. 1) and analyzed by Northern blotting. As a positive control, we probed the blot with RARβ cDNA. In agreement with published reports(32Clifford J.L. Petkovich M. Chambon P. Lotan R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1990; 4: 1546-1555Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 34Redfern C.P.F. Daly A.K. Latham J.A.E. Todd C. FEBS Lett. 1990; 273: 19-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), levels of RARβ mRNA increase from barely detectable in untreated cells, to readily observable after only 2 h of treatment. Levels continue to increase largely over the first 24 h, after which maximum levels appear to have been reached (10-12-fold over untreated cells). The band in Fig. 1 denoted as RARβ represents the product of the RARβ2 gene, because a polymerase chain reaction-generated probe containing the RARβ2-specific N-terminal sequence hybridizes with the same band (not shown). Interestingly, the RXRα probe detects three transcripts in treated and untreated cells that are weakly up-regulated (about 2-fold) by RA. Of these, only the smallest transcript (∼5 kb) appears to have the size reported by Mangelsdorf et al.(14Mangelsdorf D.J. Borgmeyer U. Heyman R.A. Zhou J.Y. Ong E.S. Oro A.E. Kakizuka A. Evans R.M. Genes & Dev. 1992; 6: 329-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (1067) Google Scholar) for RXRα. The larger transcripts may be due to deregulated expression and/or chromosomal rearrangements in these cells. RXRβ expression is also observed in untreated cells and likewise is only slightly up-regulated by RA. The size of the (single) transcript is as expected (14Mangelsdorf D.J. Borgmeyer U. Heyman R.A. Zhou J.Y. Ong E.S. Oro A.E. Kakizuka A. Evans R.M. Genes & Dev. 1992; 6: 329-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (1067) Google Scholar). In contrast, RXRγ could not be detected (data not shown). Thus, in the absence of high doses of RA, S91 cells contain mRNAs for RARα, RARγ(32Clifford J.L. Petkovich M. Chambon P. Lotan R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1990; 4: 1546-1555Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 34Redfern C.P.F. Daly A.K. Latham J.A.E. Todd C. FEBS Lett. 1990; 273: 19-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), RXRα, RXRβ, and very low levels of RARβ. As shown in Fig. 1, all receptors are constitutively expressed except for RARβ, which is induced by RA. Next, we wished to determine the nature of the nuclear proteins that mediate RA-regulation of RARβ gene transcription. For this purpose, we examined the binding of proteins, present in nuclear extracts obtained from cells undergoing the same treatment as described above, to a labeled DNA probe containing the minimal βRARE (see Fig. 5B) in EMSA. The results are shown in Fig. 2. In untreated cells, a single retarded complex is observed (Complex I), which essentially remains unchanged over the first 24 h of RA treatment, although there appears to be more binding at the 8 h time point. However, after 48 h of RA-treatment, Complex I has completely disappeared. Interestingly, a new complex (Complex II) with a higher mobility becomes apparent at the 24 h time point, and after 48 h it has greatly increased in intensity and is the only remaining complex. Binding of both these complexes is specific, as illustrated by the DNA competition studies with the 24 h time point sample (both Complexes I and II are present in this extract). Fig. 2 shows that both complexes can be effectively competed by a 50-fold excess of cold βRARE but not by two unrelated oligonucleotides representing the CCAAT-box transcription factor binding site and the minimal promoter region of the Herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase gene. Interestingly, DR1, which can bind RAR•RXR and RXR•RXR dimers, also competes. These results indicate that the βRARE could be occupied by a different set of retinoid receptors in untreated cells (Complex I) than in RA-treated cells (Complex II). In agreement with this, we find that addition of 9-cis-RA and RA slightly enhances the mobility of Complex I and II, respectively, without significantly affecting the binding efficiency (not shown). These possibilities are explored in the next section.Figure 2:Two different protein complexes bind specifically, but with different kinetics, to the βRARE. Nuclear extracts were prepared from cells treated with 10−5M RA for the time points indicated above the gel and analyzed by EMSA, using the βRARE as probe. Cold competitor DNA, as indicated below the gel, was added in 50-fold excess (see text). Arrows indicate the presence of Complexes I and II.

When used in the EMSA with in vitro translated receptors, these antibodies can “supershift” retarded complexes if the epitope is accessible and specifically change their mobility in the gel to a position with lower mobility (data not shown). For simplicity, we focused our attention on the 0 and 48 h time points, inasmuch as they each contain just one complex (either I or II, respectively). For a fair comparison of the proteins in Complexes I and II in this experiment, we used 3 εg of the 0 h time point and 1.5 εg of the 48 h time point nuclear extract, respectively, because these amounts give equal levels of shifted probe in both complexes. First, we used two different RAR antibodies: RARc, which cross-reacts with the three major RAR isoforms, and a RARβ-specific antibody (RARβ). The results are shown in Fig. 3A. Contrary to our expectations, none of the RAR antibodies affected the mobility of Complex I in the untreated extract, indicating that they either do not contain RARs or that the epitope is inaccessible. In contrast, both RAR antibodies completely supershifted Complex II at the 48 h timepoint, whereas preimmune serum and a nonrelevant antibody had no effect. This shows that Complex II contains at least RARβ. Next, we used a battery of RXR antibodies, consisting of two different RXRα antibodies (designated H and N, that recognize epitopes in the hinge region, or in the N terminus, respectively), as well as RXRβ and RXRγ antibodies (all raised against N-terminal epitopes). Fig. 3B shows the following results. Complex I can be partially supershifted by both RXRα antibodies and slightly less well by the RXRβ antibody. Addition of more antibodies did not increase the amount of shifted probe (data not shown). However, the combination of both RXRα (type H) and RXRβ antibodies quantitatively supershifts the entire complex, whereas no shift is observed with two different preimmune sera or the RXRγ antibody. (Note that all our non-IgG-purified antisera give rise to a nonspecific, serum-dependent shifted band that migrates with a lower mobility than the antibody-specific supershifted complex. It is nonspecific because nonrelated antisera give the same result, they cannot be competed with the immunizing peptide, and there is no concomitant reduction in the intensity of the complexes of interest.) This suggests that Complex I consists of, at least, RXRα and RXRβ. Fig. 3C shows that Complex II, on the other hand, can only be partially supershifted with the hinge region-epitope RXRα antibody (RXRα H) but not at all by the RXRα antibody raised against the N-terminal epitope (RXRα N). Neither one of the other RXR antibodies, or preimmune sera, affected the mobility of the complex. This not only suggests that Complex II contains RXRα, but also that the N-terminal epitope of RXRα is now inaccessible, unlike the epitope in Complex I. Again, addition of more antisera did not change the amount of retarded probe, suggesting that these effects are not due to limiting amounts of antibodies (not shown), but may be due to different intra-dimer protein-protein interactions between the RXR dimers and the RXR•RAR heterodimers. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that there are also other unknown nuclear protein(s) present in both complexes, although antibodies against thyroid hormone receptors α and β, chick ovalbumin upstream activator transcription factor, estrogen receptor, glucocorticoid receptor, and even a monoclonal antibody against RARα did not affect the mobility of either complex (data not shown). However, there is no support in the literature for higher order RXR•RAR complexes on the βRARE. It is also possible that the receptors could undergo posttranslational modification(s) upon treatment with RA, which could cause epitope masking, or as yet uncharacterized isoforms could be induced, but again, we unaware of any studies giving credence to these hypotheses. Together, these data indicate that, with respect to retinoid receptors, Complex I consists mainly, if not completely, of RXRα and RXRβ, whereas Complex II at least contains RXRα•RARβ heterodimers. Our data may also explain the disappearance of Complex I because the RXRs in that complex may be recruited into a heterodimer complex with the induced RARβ in Complex II, which should bind with higher affinity. At the 48 h time point, there may be enough RARβ protein produced that all RXRs are titrated, such that Complex II completely replaces Complex I. This interpretation is further strengthened by the results of the Western blot shown in Fig. 4. Proteins from 10 εg of nuclear extract of cells treated with RA for a period for up to 48 h were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, blotted onto nitrocellulose membrane, and probed with a RARβ antiserum. A specific band, migrating at about the expected mobility for RARβ, is induced between 8 and 24 h of treatment. The kinetics of appearance of the RARβ protein, therefore, match the observed DNA-binding activity by RARβ in Complex II in the EMSA. Interestingly, as shown before, the mRNA for RARβ can already be detected within 2 h of treatment. Thus, according to our detection methods, translation of RARβ mRNA lags at least 6 h behind transcription of the gene. The βRARE is an element with dyad symmetry, and RARs•RXRs are known to bind as (homo/hetero)dimers. Our results suggest that RXRα•RXRα and RXRβ•RXRβ homodimers, perhaps in combination with RXRα•RXRβ heterodimers, are the receptors that occupy the βRARE in untreated cells. This is surprising, since this element is only very weakly bound by RXRs in vitro(21Leid M. Kastner P. Lyons R. Nakshatri H. Saunders M. Zacharewski T. Chen J.-Y. Staub A. Garnier J.-M. Mader S.
