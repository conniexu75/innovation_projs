https://openalex.org/W1967933487,"Recent determinations of high production rates (up to 30 percent of primary production in surface waters) implicate free-living marine bacterioplankton as a link in a ""microbial loop"" that supplements phytoplankton as food for herbivores. An enclosed water column of 300 cubic meters was used to test the microbial loop hypothesis by following the fate of carbon-14-labeled bacterioplankton for over 50 days. Only 2 percent of the label initially fixed from carbon-14-labeled glucose by bacteria was present in larger organisms after 13 days, at which time about 20 percent of the total label added remained in the particulate fraction. Most of the label appeared to pass directly from particles smaller than 1 micrometer (heterotrophic bacterioplankton and some bacteriovores) to respired labeled carbon dioxide or to regenerated dissolved organic carbon-14. Secondary (and, by implication, primary) production by organisms smaller than 1 micrometer may not be an important food source in marine food chains. Bacterioplankton can be a sink for carbon in planktonic food webs and may serve principally as agents of nutrient regeneration rather than as food."
https://openalex.org/W2057528650,"Whereas higher vertebrates are able to construct a mental ""map"" of their home area and so use their knowledge of the spatial relations between landmarks to navigate along novel routes, invertebrates have been thought able to use landmarks in their navigation only as a familiar, route-specific series. Experiments with honey bees show that these insects have and use landmark maps thus invalidating this presumed invertebrate-vertebrate dichotomy."
https://openalex.org/W1990685134,"Darwin hypothesized that flower constancy in insects that feed on nectar results from the need to learn how to extract nectar from a flower of a given species. In laboratory tests, Pieris rapae, the cabbage butterfly, showed flower constancy by continuing to visit flower species with which it had experience. The time required by individuals to find the source of nectar in flowers decreased with successive attempts, the performance following a learning curve. Learning to extract nectar from a second species interfered with the ability to extract nectar from the first. Insects that switch species thus experience a cost in time to learn. These results support recent suggestions on the importance of learning in animal foraging."
https://openalex.org/W2062682639,"The study of magnetic phase transitions in insulating molecular solids provides new insights into mechanisms of magnetic coupling in the solid state and into critical phenomena associated with these transitions. Only a few such materials are known to display cooperative magnetic properties. The use of high-spin molecular components would enhance intermolecular spin-spin interactions and thus a series of charge-transfer (CT) salts have been synthesized that utilize the spin S = 1 molecular cation, [Mn(C5(CH3)5)2]+ (decamethylmanganocenium). The structure and cooperative magnetic behavior of [Mn(C5(CH3)5)2]+[TCNQ]- (decamethylmanganocenium 7,7,8,8-tetracyano-p-quinodimethanide) are reported. This salt is a bulk molecular ferromagnet with the highest critical (Curie) temperature (Tc = 6.2 K) and coercive field (3.6 Ã— 103 gauss), yet reported for such a material."
https://openalex.org/W2092236542,"A detailed alkalinity budget was constructed for Lake 239 in the Experimental Lakes Area of northwestern Ontario and for three small watersheds in its terrestrial basin. Alkalinity generation in the lake averaged 118 milliequivalents per square meter per year, 4.5 times as high as the areal rate in the terrestrial basin. Although acid deposition in the area is low, only one of the three terrestrial watersheds was a significant source of alkalinity. A second terrestrial watershed yielded very little alkalinity. The third watershed, which contains a wetland, was a sink for, rather than a source of, alkalinity. An analysis of ion budgets for the lake revealed that more than half of the in situ alkalinity production was by biological rather than geochemical processes. The major processes that generated alkalinity were: biological reduction of SO(4)(2-)(53%), exchange of H(+) for Ca(2+) in sediments (39%), and biological reduction of NO(3)(-) (26%). Comparison with experimentally acidified Lake 223 revealed that alkalinity production by sulfate reduction increased in response to increased inputs of sulfuric acid."
https://openalex.org/W2083568506,"The Particle Beam Fusion Accelerator II (PBFA II) is presently under construction and is the only existing facility with the potential of igniting thermonuclear fuel in the laboratory. The accelerator will generate up to 5 megamperes of lithium ions at 30 million electron volts and will focus them onto an inertial confinement fusion (ICF) target after beam production and focusing have been optimized. Since its inception, the light ion approach to ICF has been considered the one that combines low cost, high risk, and high payoff. The beams are of such high density that their self-generated electric and magnetic fields were thought to prohibit high focal intensities. Recent advances in beam production and focusing demonstrate that these self-forces can be controlled to the degree required for ignition, break-even, and high gain experiments. ICF has been pursued primarily for its potential military applications. However, the high efficiency and cost-effectiveness of the light ion approach enhance its potential for commercial energy application as well."
https://openalex.org/W2022730070,"Flexible polymerized membranes in a good solvent are expected to exhibit a remarkable low-temperature flat phase, characterized by a diverging bending rigidity, vanishing elastic constants, and large fluctuations both parallel and perpendicular to the surface. A theory of the equilibrium structure factor provides a good fit to extensive molecular dynamics simulations of simplified ""tethered surface"" models of these materials. These results show how information about the size, thickness, and internal structure of polymerized membranes can be extracted from diffraction experiments."
https://openalex.org/W2080632216,"Through a multidisciplinary project (AMERIEZ), with an unusual complement of components, previously unknown temporal and spatial dimensions to the structure of Antarctic epipelagic and mesopelagic communities were revealed. In late spring, an abundance of crustacean species thought to occur only below 300 meters was detected in ice-covered surface waters. Evident in ice-free waters were the expected occurrence patterns of these normally nonmigratory mesopelagic organisms. Where the pack was consolidated and little light penetrated to depth, primary and secondary production was confined to ice floes, and the physical environment immediately beneath the ice was reminiscent of a mesopelagic one. This suite of characteristics possibly explains why the crustaceans resided at the surface."
https://openalex.org/W1979653071,"The late Quaternary marine terraces near Santa Cruz, California, reflect uplift associated with the nearby restraining bend on the San Andreas fault. Excellent correspondence of the coseismic vertical displacement field caused by the 17 October 1989 magnitude 7.1 Loma Prieta earthquake and the present elevations of these terraces allows calculation of maximum long-term uplift rates 1 to 2 kilometers west of the San Andreas fault of 0.8 millimeters per year. Over several million years, this uplift, in concert with the right lateral translation of the resulting topography, and with continual attack by geomorphic processes, can account for the general topography of the northern Santa Cruz Mountains."
https://openalex.org/W1972706973,"Three-dimensionally preserved unisexual angiosperm flowers and inflorescences have been recovered from the Lower Cretaceous Patapsco Formation (Potomac Group) of eastern North America, in sediments palynologically dated as late Albian, approximately 100 million years old. In situ tricolpate pollen shows that the flowers were produced by some of the earliest higher (nonmagnoliid) dicotyledons, and the morphology of pollen, flowers, and inflorescences indicates a close relation to extant Platanaceae. Combined with architectural and cuticular features of associated leaves these floral remains suggest that Platanus-like plants with unisexual, probably insect-pollinated flowers were an important element in the mid-Cretaceous diversification of dicotyledonous flowering plants."
https://openalex.org/W2059204153,"The vibrational Raman spectrum of solid hydrogen has been measured from 77 to 295 K in the vicinity of the recently observed insulator-metal transition and low-temperature phase transition at 150 gigapascals (1.5 megabars). The measurements provide evidence for a critical point in the pressure-temperature phase boundary of the low-temperature transition. The result suggests that below the critical temperature the insulator-metal transition changes from continuous to discontinuous, consistent with the general criteria originally proposed by Mott for metallization by band-gap closure. The effect of temperature on hydrogen metallization closely resembles that of the lower pressure insulator-metal transitions in doped V(2)O(3) alloys."
