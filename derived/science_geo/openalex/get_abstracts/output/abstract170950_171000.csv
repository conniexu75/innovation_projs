https://openalex.org/W2036521316,"p21Cip1/WAF1 (p21), a p53-inducible protein, is a critical regulator of cell cycle and cell survival. p21 binds to and inhibits both the DNA synthesis regulator proliferating cell nuclear antigen and cyclin A/E-CDK2 complexes. Recently, p21 has also been shown to be a positive regulator of cell cycle progression as p21 is necessary for the assembly and activation of cyclin D1-CDK4/6 complexes. Furthermore, elevated p21 protein levels have been observed in various aggressive tumors as well as linked to chemoresistance. Here we demonstrate that p21 is directly phosphorylated by AKT/PKB, a survival kinase that is hyperactivated in many late stage tumors. Two sites (Thr145 and Ser146) in the carboxyl terminus of p21 are phosphorylated by AKT/PKB in vitro and in vivo. Phosphorylation of Thr145 inhibits PCNA binding, whereas phosphorylation of Ser146 significantly increases p21 protein stability. Glioblastoma cell lines with activated AKT/PKB show enhanced p21 stability, and they are more resistant to taxol-mediated toxicity. Finally, AKT/PKB controls the assembly of cyclin D1-CDK4 complexes through modulation of p21 and cyclin D1 levels. These data imply that enhanced levels of p21 in tumors are due, in part, to phosphorylation by activated AKT/PKB. Furthermore, they suggest that one mechanism of AKT/PKB regulation of tumor cell survival and/or proliferation is to stabilize p21 protein. p21Cip1/WAF1 (p21), a p53-inducible protein, is a critical regulator of cell cycle and cell survival. p21 binds to and inhibits both the DNA synthesis regulator proliferating cell nuclear antigen and cyclin A/E-CDK2 complexes.

Tumors utilize a diversity of genetic mechanisms to allow for survival under the onslaught of the immune system or radiation and chemotherapy. The most notable modifications are found in the deletion of various tumor suppressor genes that are involved with a diversity of cellular functions ranging from control of cell cycle progression to regulation of apoptotic cell death. For example, the loss of p53 is a common genetic lesion in tumor cells, and this deletion results in changes in the cell's response to DNA damage such that the transformed cells become less prone to apoptosis when their genomes are toxically modified (1.Vousden K.H. Cell. 2000; 103: 691-694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar). Because p53 is a transcription factor, its loss results in changes in the expression of downstream target genes. One such target gene is p21Cip1/WAF1 (p21), which encodes a protein that regulates cell cycle and DNA synthesis (see below) (2.Xiong Y. Zhang H. Beach D. Nature. 1993; 366: 701-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (3179) Google Scholar). The cell cycle of tumor cells can also be modulated by the deletion of the retinoblastoma protein, a substrate molecule of cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK), 1The abbreviations used are: CDKcyclin-dependent kinasePI3phosphatidylinositol 3PCNAproliferating cell nuclear antigenGSTglutathione S-transferaseKDkinase deadPTENphosphatase with tensin homologyMMACmutated in multiple advanced cancersPKBprotein kinase B which negatively modulates the mitosis-inducing E2F transcription factors (3.Phillips A.C. Vousden K.H. Apoptosis. 2001; 6: 173-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Recently, the homozygous loss of the PTEN/MMAC tumor suppressor, which appears to positively modulate tumor cell survival, has been identified in a diversity of late stage cancers including glioblastoma and prostate tumors (4.Li J. Yen C. Liaw D. Podsypanina K. Bose S. Wang S.I. Puc J. Miliaresis C. Rodgers L. McCombie R. Bigner S.H. Giovanella B.C. Ittmann M. Tycko B. Hibshoosh H. Wigler M.H. Parsons R.

Hu R. Swedlund B. Teng D.H. Tavtigian S.V. Nat. Genet. 1997; 15: 356-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (2526) Google Scholar). PTEN/MMAC is a lipid phosphatase that regulates the levels of two phospholipid products of the pro-survival PI3 kinase pathway, phosphatidylinositol phosphate-3,4 and -3,4,5, by dephosphorylation at position 3 (6.Maehama T. Dixon J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13375-13378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2614) Google Scholar). These phospholipids are required for activation of AKT/PKB, a kinase that down-regulates apoptosis by phosphorylating various substrates including BAD, caspase 9, and most importantly, forkhead family transcription factors. The phosphorylation of the forkhead family proteins by AKT/PKB results in their cytoplasmic localization (7.Wu X. Senechal K. Neshat M.S. Whang Y.E. Sawyers C.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15587-15591Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar, 8.Haas-Kogan D. Shalev N. Wong M. Mills G. Yount G. Stokoe D. Curr.

Because these transcription factors mediate the expression of pro-apoptotic genes, their phosphorylation and then cytoplasmic sequestration result in the inhibition of cell death (10.Brunet A. Bonni A. Zigmond M.J. Lin M.Z. Juo P. Hu L.S. Anderson M.J. Arden K.C. Blenis J. Greenberg M.E. Cell. 1999; 96: 857-868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5454) Google Scholar). Thus, the loss of PTEN/MMAC results in enhanced AKT/PKB kinase activity along with decreased forkhead transcription activity and enhanced cell survival. Finally, although it is likely that the AKT/PKB pathway is involved with the regulation of cell cycle, very little has been observed along these lines, although an increase in the p27kip1cyclin inhibitor protein is found as a result of forkhead-induced transcription (11.Medema R. Kops G. Bos J. Burgering B. Nature. 1999; 404: 782-787Crossref Scopus (1231) Google Scholar). cyclin-dependent kinase phosphatidylinositol 3 proliferating cell nuclear antigen glutathione S-transferase kinase dead phosphatase with tensin homology mutated in multiple advanced cancers protein kinase B p21 was initially isolated as a p53-inducible protein. Because p53 was known to function in cell cycle regulation, p21 was proposed to be a regulator of cell cycle progression (2.Xiong Y. Zhang H. Beach D. Nature. 1993; 366: 701-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (3179) Google Scholar). Subsequent studies revealed that p21 played a dual role in cell cycle progression by regulating both DNA synthesis and CDK activity. p21 bound to various cyclin-CDK complexes via an amino-terminal binding site, and this interaction acted to inhibit the activity of these complexes, thus resulting in a block in cell cycle progression (12.Sherr C. Roberts J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1501-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (5159) Google Scholar). The versatility of p21 was revealed by studies demonstrating that the protein also bound to PCNA, a co-activator of DNA polymerase δ and ε activities (13.Kelman Z. O'Donnell M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 3613-3620Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), by a carboxyl-terminal interaction (14.Gulbis J. Kelman Z. Hurwitz J. O'Donnell M. Kuriyan J. Cell. 1996; 87: 297-306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar). This interaction resulted in an inhibition of the ability of PCNA to assist DNA polymerases, which led to inhibition of DNA synthesis (15.Waga S. Hannon G. Beach D. Stillman B. Nature. 1994; 369: 574-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (1591) Google Scholar). Although these data are consistent with the suggestion that p21 acts as an inhibitor of cell cycle progression, several recent studies have revealed the p21 could also function as a positive regulator of cell cycle. Studies from Sherr et al. (17.Cheng M. Olivier P. Diehl J. Fero M. Roussel M. Roberts J. Sherr C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1571-1583Crossref PubMed Scopus (974) Google Scholar) and others (16.LaBaer J.

Chem. 2000; 275: 10285-10290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that despite its inhibition of cyclin E-CDK2 complexes, p21 mediates the assembly and activation of cyclin D1-CDK4/6 complexes, which function as sensors of growth factors at G1-S phase complexes. In addition to the functions in the cell cycle, p21 has also been suggested to play a role in enhancing cell survival. For example, terminally differentiated cells, such as muscle cells (19.Lawlor M. Rotwein P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8983-8995Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), hematopoietic stem cells (20.Cheng T. Rodrigues N. Shen H.M. Yang Y.G. Dombkowski D. Sykes M. Scadden D.T. Science. 2000; 287: 1804-1808Crossref PubMed Scopus (1085) Google Scholar) and macrophages (21.Asada M. Yamada T. Ichijo H. Delia D. Miyazano K. Fukumuro K. Mizutani S. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1223-1234Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar), were found to contain elevated levels of p21, and the inhibition of the up-regulation of this protein resulted in apoptotic cell death. p21 may act as a coordinator of DNA synthesis and cell cycle arrest, as cells lacking p21 undergo DNA damage-mediated DNA replication, resulting in endoreduplication and subsequent apoptosis (22.Stewart Z. Leach S. Pietenpol J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 205-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 23.Waldman, T., Lengauer, C., Kinzler, K., and Vogelstein, B. (1996) 381, 713–716Google Scholar). Furthermore, p21 can protect various types of cells from death following anticancer treatments. p21 overexpressed by inducible expression systems or adenovirus gene transfer increases cell survival against prostaglandin A2 or p53 overproduction (24.Gorospe, M., Wang, X., Guyton, K., and Holbrook, N. (1996) 16, 6654–6660Google Scholar, 25.Gorospe M. Cirielli C. Wang X. Seth P. Capogrossi M. Holbrook N. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 929-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). The reduction or absence of p21 expression, however, sensitizes cells to adriamycin, camptothecin, etoposide, γ-irradiation, or prostaglandin A2 (23.Waldman, T., Lengauer, C., Kinzler, K., and Vogelstein, B. (1996) 381, 713–716Google Scholar, 26.Polyak K. Waldman T. He T. Kinzler K. Vogelstein B. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1945-1952Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar, 27.Waldman T. Zhang Y. Dillehay L.

In summary, p21 has both negative and positive functions in cell cycle, and it can also act as a positive mediator of cell survival upon terminal differentiation or genotoxic damage. Because the p21 protein level is elevated in a diversity of tumors, particularly in the late stage, aggressive tumors such as glioblastoma multiforme, the complex functions of p21 suggest that advanced tumors appear to take advantage of the positive effects of p21 on cell cycle progression and cell survival (18.Weiss R. Joo A. Randour C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10285-10290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 29.Jung J. Bruner J. Ruan S. Langford L. Kyritsis A. Kobayashi T. Levin V.

Bartek J. Bosch F. Int. J. Cancer. 1997; 74: 383-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Three recent papers have suggested that p21 is modulated by the AKT/PKB survival pathway (33.Scott M. Morrice N. Ball K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11529-11537Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 34.Zhou B. Liao Y. Xia W. Spohn B. Lee M. Hung M. Nat.

Biol. 2001; 21: 5644-5657Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Mammalian p21 isolated from baculovirus-infected insect cells was found to be phosphorylated on two residues, Thr145 and Ser146 (33.Scott M. Morrice N. Ball K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11529-11537Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Interestingly, these phosphorylation sites were found in the PCNA binding site, and it was shown that phosphorylation at these sites disrupted PCNA binding to p21 in vitro. Although these residues could be weakly phosphorylated in vitro by protein kinases A and C, these investigators proposed another, unknown kinase as the actual mediator of phosphorylation. Examination of these residues suggested that they were consensus phosphorylation sites for AKT/PKB kinases, and it was subsequently shown that one of the residues, Thr145, could be phosphorylated by AKT/PKB in vitro as well as in cells overexpressing the HER-2 oncogene or moderately activated AKT/PKB (34.Zhou B. Liao Y. Xia W. Spohn B. Lee M. Hung M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 245-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (924) Google Scholar, 35.Rossig L. Jadidi A. Urbich C. Badorff C. Zeiher A. Dimmler S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 5644-5657Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). An examination of the effects of this phosphorylation event suggested that it mediated a change in the subcellular localization of p21, such that the phosphorylated form was found in the cytoplasm (34.Zhou B. Liao Y. Xia W. Spohn B. Lee M. Hung M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 245-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (924) Google Scholar). However, another group demonstrated that this phosphorylation event was not involved with subcellular localization but was instead involved with regulation of PCNA binding and cyclin-CDK assembly (35.Rossig L. Jadidi A. Urbich C. Badorff C. Zeiher A. Dimmler S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 5644-5657Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Here we demonstrate that both Thr145 and Ser146 sites are targets for AKT/PKB phosphorylation in vivo. We also demonstrate that phosphorylation at Ser146 results in a significant increase in p21 protein stability and protection of cells from taxol-induced apoptosis. We confirm and extend the data suggesting that the phosphorylation at Thr145 results in an inhibition of p21-PCNA binding in vivo. Finally, we demonstrate that p21 induced by AKT/PKB activation does not inhibit cyclin E-CDK2 but binds with and activates cyclin D1-CDK4 complex. Together, these data suggest that a novel mechanism for AKT/PKB-mediated regulation of cell survival and/or cell proliferation is by phosphorylation and up-regulation of p21. Anti-Flag (M2) and anti-Myc (9E10) antibodies were from Sigma and Roche Molecular Biochemicals, respectively. The anti-AKT/PKB and anti-phospho AKT/PKB (T308) were purchased from Cell Signaling. Antibodies recognizing p21 (C-19 and 187), CDK2, cyclin D1, and CDK4 were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. The polyclonal antibody against p21(Ab5) used for immunoprecipitation was from Oncogene. The anti-β-tubulin and anti-PCNA antibodies were from BD PharMingen and Transduction Laboratories, respectively. Kinase substrates Histone H1 and GST-Rb were from Roche Molecular Biochemicals and Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., respectively. DNA plasmids encoding Myc-tagged Mys-Akt and Akt-KD were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., and taxol was from Sigma. Using standard PCR protocols, Flag-tagged p21 was cloned into the pcDNA3.1 vector (Invitrogen). The putative Akt phosphorylation site (Thr145 or Ser146) was mutated to Ala by site-directed mutagenesis using the QuickChange™ kit from Stratagene. The presence of the introduced mutations was confirmed by sequence analysis. To generate constructs for expression of GST-tagged p21 in Escherichia coli, wild type or mutants of p21 cDNA fragments were subcloned into vector pGEX4T-3 (Amersham Biosciences Inc.). The GST fusion proteins were expressed in E. coli strain BL21 and purified by glutathione-Sepharose chromatography based on manufacturer's instruction (Amersham Biosciences Inc.). The glioblastoma cell lines U-87 MG, U-118 MG, A172, DBTRG-05MG, and T98G and the human epithelial cell line 293E were obtained from ATCC and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen) and antibiotics (50 units/ml penicillin and 50 μg/ml streptomycin). The MCF7 human breast carcinoma cell line was from ATCC and grown in RPMI (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (Invitrogen) and antibiotics. Stable MCF7 cells overexpressing Myc-tagged Mys-AKT/PKB and AKT/PKB-KD were generated by transfecting the cells with plasmids and selecting in the RPMI medium containing 500 μg/ml G418. DNA plasmids were transfected using FuGENE™ 6 reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Phosphorothioate oligodeoxynucleotides (250 nm) were transfected with Oligofectamine™ reagent (Invitrogen) following manufacture's instruction (Invitrogen). The p21Cip1/WAF1 antisense oligo and control oligo were purchased from Molecular Research Laboratories, LLC. The antisense oligo, 5′-CCAACTCATCCCGGCCTCGC-3′, is complementary to the coding region of p21. The control oligo, 5′-AACCCCTTCCGGCCCCTCAG-3′, is a scrambled sequence. 2 μg of GST-tagged wild type or mutant p21 protein was incubated with 0.5 μg of active Akt (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) in the presence of 10 μCi [γ-32P]ATP and 50 μm cold ATP in the kinase buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, 25 mmsodium β-glycerophosphate, 5 mm EGTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, and 10 mm MgCl2) for 30 min at 30 °C. The reaction was terminated by 10 mm EDTA and SDS sample buffer. The reaction products were separated on 4–20% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose filters. 32P-incorporated proteins were detected by autoradiography. 293E cells were cotransfected with Myc-tagged Mys-Akt and Flag-tagged p21 (wild type or mutants). 16 h after transfection, the cells were serum-starved for 12 h and then grown in phosphate-free medium for 1.5 h. 1.5 mCi/ml [32P]orthophosphate was then added to the medium. At 4 h after the labeling, p21 was immunoprecipitated with anti-Flag antibody and resolved by SDS-PAGE. The32P-labeled p21 was then detected by autoradiography and quantified by phosphorimaging. Cells were washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 10 mm sodium β-glycerophosphate, 50 mm NaF, 5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 μm Microcystin-LR, 0.27 m sucrose, and protease inhibitors). After lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C, 50 μg proteins were electrophoresed by 4–20% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nictrocellulose filters. The membrane was blocked in 5% nonfat milk and probed with different antibodies. Expression of β-tubulin was used as an equal loading control. For assessment of CDK2 and CDK4 kinase activities, endogenous CDK2 or CDK4 was immunoprecipitated from 1 mg of cell lysate proteins. The immunoprecipitated CDK2 and CDK4 were incubated with 2 μg of histone H1 and 2 μg of GST-Rb, respectively, in the presence of 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP and 20 μm cold ATP in the kinase buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, 25 mmsodium α-glycerophosphate, 5 mm EGTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, and 10 mm MgCl2). 48 h after taxol challenge, floating cells were transferred to a tube. The adherent cells were treated with trypsin and then mixed with the floating cells. The cells were collected by centrifugation at 1500 rpm for 5 min. After being stained with 0.4% trypan blue (Sigma) for 5 min at room temperature, the numbers of trypan blue-positive dead cells and trypan blue-negative alive cells were counted on a hemocytometer under a microscope. Examination of the p21 sequence revealed two overlapping sites in the carboxyl terminus for phosphorylation by the AKT/PKB kinase. Fig. 1A shows that one site at Thr145 is preceded by the known consensus sequence R XR XX, while a second adjacent site at Ser146 is preceded by a highly conserved site, K XR XX. In addition, the second site at Ser146 is followed by a hydrophobic residue (Met147), a type of residue commonly found in AKT/PKB phosphorylation sites. To examine whether AKT/PKB physically interacted with p21, coprecipitation studies (an important, although not necessary, component of AKT/PKB-mediated phosphorylation) were performed. Fig. 1B shows that p21 could be effectively coprecipitated with AKT/PKB, and mutation of the consensus phosphorylation sites to alanine did not appear to affect this molecular interaction. Examination of endogenous proteins also revealed that AKT/PKB and p21 interacted in vivo (Fig. 1C). During the preparation of this manuscript, three groups reported that p21 is a phosphoprotein (33.Scott M. Morrice N. Ball K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11529-11537Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 34.Zhou B. Liao Y. Xia W. Spohn B. Lee M. Hung M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 245-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (924) Google Scholar, 35.Rossig L. Jadidi A. Urbich C. Badorff C. Zeiher A. Dimmler S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 5644-5657Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). In one study, it was shown that p21 isolated from actively growing baculovirus-infected insect cells was phosphorylated at Thr145 and Ser146, although the in vivo kinase responsible for this event was not identified (33.Scott M. Morrice N. Ball K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11529-11537Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Two other groups demonstrated that the AKT/PKB kinase phosphorylated the Thr145 residue (34.Zhou B. Liao Y. Xia W. Spohn B. Lee M. Hung M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 245-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (924) Google Scholar, 35.Rossig L. Jadidi A. Urbich C. Badorff C. Zeiher A. Dimmler S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 5644-5657Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). In one case, it was shown that activation of the HER-2 receptor tyrosine kinase signaling pathway was involved with AKT/PKB-mediated p21 phosphorylation, while in the other case, p21 was a substrate for AKT/PKB phosphorylation in transfected cells. Interestingly, the second group demonstrated residual AKT/PKB-dependent phosphorylation on p21 that was mutated to alanine at the Thr145 position, suggesting at least one other AKT/PKB phosphorylation site in p21 (35.Rossig L. Jadidi A. Urbich C. Badorff C. Zeiher A. Dimmler S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 5644-5657Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). To examine whether the residual phosphorylation was at position Ser146, transfection experiments were performed using p21 mutated at either or both of the potential AKT/PKB phosphorylation sites. Fig. 1Ddemonstrates that p21 is indeed phosphorylated in cells transfected with either the highly oncogenic myristoylated form of AKT/PKB (Mys-AKT) or with an epitope-tagged form of the cellular protein (V5-AKT). Fig. 1E shows that in vitrophosphorylation of bacterially produced p21 by purified AKT occurs on both the Thr145 and the Ser146 positions, with the Thr145 position showing a moderately higher efficiency of phosphorylation. These in vitro data were recapitulated in the transfection studies, where it was again demonstrated that both Thr145 and Ser146 served as substrates for AKT/PKB phosphorylation (Fig. 1F). These results suggest that the residual phosphorylation that was previously observed in the Thr145 mutant is likely to be due to AKT/PKB-mediated phosphorylation at the Ser146 residue. While examining the potential effects of AKT/PKB on p21, we observed that elevated levels of p21 were found in cells co-transfected with a plasmid expressing the activated, but not kinase dead (KD) forms of AKT/PKB (Fig. 2A). We further tested whether endogenous AKT/PKB activity can increase the p21 protein level in vivo. As shown in Fig. 2B (left panel), the level of endogenous p21 protein in MCF7 cells was significantly higher in the presence of 10% serum when AKT/PKB was fully active. The addition of LY 294002, a specific PI3 kinase inhibitor, reduced p21 protein level comparable with that under serum free conditions. In contrast, overexpressing active AKT/PKB in the serum-starved MCF7 cells was able to restore the level of p21 protein (Fig. 2B, right panel). The protein levels of p21 are known to be regulated by post-translational degradation as well as by transcriptional activation, although the exact mechanism of protein degradation is controversial (36.Sheaff R. Singer J. Swanger J. Smitherman M. Roberts J. Clurman B. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 403-410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). Interestingly, two previous studies demonstrated that the steady state levels of p21 appeared to be modulated by the PI3 kinase pathway (37.Fukuchi K. Watanabe H. Tmoyasu S. Ichimura S. Tatsumi K. Gomi K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1496: 207-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 38.Mitsuuchi Y. Johnson S. Selvakumaran M. Williams S. Hamilton T. Testa J. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 5390-5394PubMed Google Scholar). To examine whether the elevated levels of p21 in AKT/PKB transfected cells was due to protein stabilization, protein degradation studies were performed. Fig. 2C shows that p21 is rapidly degraded after the addition of cycloheximide in either nontransfected or AKT-KD transfected cells. In contrast to these results, p21 appears to be stabilized in cells expressing the oncogenic form of AKT/PKB (Mys-AKT). These results suggested that phosphorylation of p21 by AKT/PKB might affect the stability of the protein. To examine this question, we transfected either wild type or forms of p21 that were mutated at Thr145, Ser146, or both sites into cells together with AKT/PKB and examined the stability of each protein. Fig. 2D shows that whereas the T145A mutant showed stability kinetics that were similar to wild type p21 (Fig. 2C), mutation at Ser146 resulted in a protein half-life that was indistinguishable from that observed in AKT/PKB nontransfected cells or in cells transfected with KD AKT/PKB. These results demonstrated that phosphorylation of p21 at Ser146by AKT/PKB was involved with protein stability. Finally, analysis of endogenous p21 protein stability in MCF7 cells demonstrated that expression of oncogenic AKT/PKB resulted in an increase in protein stability (Fig. 2E). Together, these data suggested that one of the functions of AKT/PKB is to phosphorylate p21 at position Ser146 and increase protein stability and the resultant steady state p21 levels. Advanced stage tumors such as glioblastoma multiformes have been found to express elevated levels of p21 (29.Jung J. Bruner J. Ruan S. Langford L. Kyritsis A. Kobayashi T. Levin V. Zhang W. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 201-208Google Scholar). These same tumor types have been shown to contain hyperactivated AKT/PKB, the result of the loss of the PTEN tumor suppressor phosphatase, a protein that down-regulates AKT/PKB activity (7.Wu X. Senechal K. Neshat M.S. Whang Y.E. Sawyers C.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15587-15591Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar, 8.Haas-Kogan D. Shalev N. Wong M. Mills G. Yount G. Stokoe D. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1195-1198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To examine whether the levels of activated AKT/PKB correlated with p21 stability, five different glioblastoma cell lines were examined. Fig. 3A shows that two of these lines, U-87 MG and U-118 MG, showed high levels of AKT/PKB activation, whereas the three other lines showed little if any activation of the kinase. Examination of the stability of endogenous p21 revealed an exact correlation between p21 stability and AKT/PKB activation. As shown in Fig. 3, B and C, p21 was much more stable in cell lines with higher levels of activated AKT/PKB than in those lines with lower AKT/PKB activation levels. Although this suggests that stability may play a major role in p21 levels, the results are made more complex by the fact that p21 levels are also transcriptionally modulated by p53 (26.Polyak K. Waldman T. He T. Kinzler K. Vogelstein B. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1945-1952Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). Thus, the overall steady state levels of p21 in tumor cells (Fig. 3A) are achieved by a combination of both transcriptional regulation by p5"

One mechanism to explain these synergistic effects is the ability of integrins to induce phosphorylation of growth factor receptors, for instance the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor. Here we define some aspects of the molecular mechanisms regulating integrin-dependent EGF receptor phosphorylation. We show that in the early phases of cell adhesion integrins associate with EGF receptors on the cell membrane in a macromolecular complex including the adaptor protein p130Cas and the c-Src kinase, the latter being required for adhesion-dependent assembly of the macromolecular complex. We also show that the integrin cytoplasmic tail, c-Src kinase, and the p130Cas adaptor protein are required for phosphorylation of EGF receptor in response to integrin-mediated adhesion. We show that integrins induce phosphorylation of EGF receptor on tyrosine residues 845, 1068, 1086, and 1173, but not on residue 1148, a major site of phosphorylation in response to EGF. In addition we find that integrin-mediated adhesion increases the amount of EGF receptor expressed on the cell surface. Therefore these data indicate that integrin-mediated adhesion induces assembly of a macromolecular complex containing c-Src and p130Cas and leads to phosphorylation of specific EGF receptor tyrosine residues.

Integrin-mediated adhesion stimulates multiple signaling pathways that modulate actin cytoskeleton organization, cell motility, cell growth, and the ability of cells to escape from apoptosis. Integrin-dependent signaling includes Ca2+influx, cytoplasmic alkalinization, potassium channel activation, tyrosine phosphorylation of cytoplasmic proteins, and activation of the mitogen-activated protein (MAP)1 kinases ERK-1 and ERK-2 (for review, see Refs. 1Clark E.A. Brugge J.S. Science. 1995; 268: 233-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (2802) Google Scholar, 2Assoian R.K. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar, 3Defilippi P. Gismondi A.

Although many integrin-dependent signaling pathways have been described extensively, the molecular mechanisms by which integrins are able to trigger these events are still poorly defined. Integrins have been shown to interact with transducing molecules to promote intracellular signaling. Potential candidates as transducing elements are tyrosine kinases of the Fak and Src family. The amino-terminal domain of p125Fak (6Hanks S.K. Calalb M.B. Harper M.C. Patel S.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 8487-8489Crossref PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar, 7Schaller M.D. Borgman C.A. Cobb B.S. Vines R.R. Reynolds A.B. Parsons J.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Parsons J.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1287: 73-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). After activation by most integrins, p125Fak is phosphorylated on tyrosine 397, which becomes a high affinity binding site for the SH2 domain of c-Src (9Schaller M.D. Hildebrand J.D. Shannon J.D. Fox J.W. Vines R.R. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1680-1688Crossref PubMed Scopus (1113) Google Scholar). The Src kinase then phosphorylates focal adhesion components, such as the cytoskeletal proteins talin, paxillin, the adaptor p130Cas, and the p125Fak itself on the tyrosine 925, leading to signaling functions. It has been shown that phosphorylated p125Fak interacts with the adaptor molecule Grb-2, leading to MAP kinase activation (10Schlaepfer D.D. Broome M.A. Hunter T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1702-1713Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar) through a B-Raf-dependent pathway (11Barberis L. Wary K.K. Fiucci G. Liu F. Hirsch E. Brancaccio M. Altruda F. Tarone G. Giancotti F.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36532-36540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). In addition to p125Fak, some β1 and αvintegrins activate the Src family member Fyn and the adaptor Shc. The assembly of this transduction complex involves caveolin, a transmembrane protein that cooperates with integrins to activate signaling pathways. After cell-matrix adhesion, integrin-caveolin-Fyn complexes associate with tyrosine-phosphorylated Shc, which, in turn, interacts with the Grb2·Sos complex leading to activation of the Ras-MAP kinase cascade (12Wary K.K. Mariotti A. Zurzolo C. Giancotti F.G. Cell. 1998; 94: 625-634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar). Integrins can also associate with proteins belonging to the Tetraspan family (CD9, CD63, and CD81) to modulate intracellular signaling (13Berditchevski F. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 4143-4151Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Integrin-dependent activation of the small GTPase Rac (for review, see Refs. 14Defilippi P. Olivo C. Venturino M. Dolce L. Silengo L. Tarone G. Microsc. Res. Tech. 1999; 47: 67-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar and 15Schwartz M.A. Shattil S.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 388-391Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar) has also been proposed recently as an additional mechanism to regulate adhesion-dependent events, such as integrin activation of Jun NH2-terminal kinase (16Dolfi F.

Integrin regulation of Rac activation can occur through the adaptor molecules p130Cas and Crk (16Dolfi F. Garcia-Guzman M. Ojaniemi M. Nakamura H. Matsuda M. Vuori K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15394-15399Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 17Klemke R.L. Leng J. Molander R. Brooks P.C. Vuori K. Cheresh D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 961-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar), likely through the involvement of a Rac-specific guanine nucleotide exchange factor, such as Vav (18Crespo P. Schuebel K.E. Ostrom A.A. Gutkind J.S. Bustelo X.R. Nature. 1997; 385: 169-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar). In addition to these molecules, growth factor receptors are candidates to cooperate with integrins in assembling a transduction machinery. Integrins have been shown to potentiate signaling pathways in response to insulin, platelet-derived growth factor, epidermal growth factor (EGF), fibroblast growth factor, and vascular endothelial growth factor (19Vuori K.

In particular, αvβ3 integrin has been shown to synergize with different growth factor receptors. αvβ3 integrin occupancy by its matrix ligand is required for full tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin and platelet-derived growth factor β receptors and their binding to several signaling molecules such as insulin receptor substrate 1, phospholipase Cγ, Ras GAP, the p85 subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and the tyrosine phosphatase SHP2 (19Vuori K. Ruoslahti E. Science. 1994; 266: 576-1578Crossref Scopus (338) Google Scholar, 22Schneller M. Vuori K. Ruoslahti E. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5600-5607Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). In endothelial cells, moreover, αvβ3 integrin potentiates the activation of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor and of p85 phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase by its ligand (28Soldi R. Mitola S. Strasly M. Defilippi P. Tarone G. Bussolino F. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 882-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar). Direct phosphorylation of growth factor receptors by integrin-mediated adhesion represents a potential mechanism by which integrins can enhance signaling pathways emanating from growth factor receptors (30Rusciano D.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6622-6632Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar). We have shown recently that in cells expressing more than 104 EGF receptors/cell, integrins induce EGF receptor tyrosine phosphorylation in the absence of EGF receptor ligands, leading to Shc phosphorylation and MAP kinase activation (33Moro L. Venturino M. Bozzo C. Silengo L. Altruda F. Beguinot L. Tarone G. Defilippi P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6622-6632Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar). In this work we show that integrins, c-Src, p130Cas, and EGF receptor associate in a macromolecular complex on the cell membrane and that integrin-dependent adhesion induces phosphorylation of specific tyrosine residues of EGF receptor, distinct from those obtained by soluble ligand EGF. The following antibodies to integrin subunits were used: monoclonal antibody (mAb) TS2/16 to the human β1 integrin subunit (purchased from ATCC), mAb L230 to the αv integrin subunit (from ATCC), mAb B212 to the β3 subunit, and the polyclonal antibody to the β1 integrin cytoplasmic domain described previously (34Defilippi P. van Hinsbergh V. Bertolotto A. Rossino P. Silengo L. Tarone G. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 855-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). All the monoclonal antibodies were affinity purified on protein A-Sepharose as described (35Ey P.L. Prowse S.J. Jenkin C.R. Immunochemistry. 1978; 15: 429-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (1981) Google Scholar), and the purity of the antibodies was higher than 95%. Antibodies to the EGF receptor were: mAb HB-8509 and HB-8508 (purchased from ATCC), mAb to the activated form of EGF receptor (purchased from Transduction Laboratories), and polyclonal Ab EGFR1 produced as described by Moro et al. (33Moro L. Venturino M. Bozzo C. Silengo L. Altruda F. Beguinot L. Tarone G. Defilippi P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6622-6632Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar). Polyclonal antibodies to phosphorylated tyrosine 1068, 1086, 1148, and 1173 of the EGF receptor were prepared from BIOSOURCE International. The specificity of each antibody has been tested on extracts of EGF-treated NIH3T3 cells expressing EGF receptor mutated on each specific tyrosine (data not shown). Polyclonal antibody to p125Fak Fak4 has been described previously (33Moro L. Venturino M. Bozzo C. Silengo L. Altruda F. Beguinot L. Tarone G. Defilippi P.

Nakamoto. Cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. ECV304 cells grown to 80% confluence in 100-mm tissue culture dishes were transiently transfected with the pSGT Src K− plasmid encoding a c-Src point mutant kinase negative (gift from Dr. S. Courtneidge) by the LipofectAMINE reagent as described by the manufacturer. 20 h after transfection the medium was changed to Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.5% fetal calf serum, and cells were incubated for 24 h before the adhesion assay. Cells grown to confluence were serum deprived in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 24 h, detached with 10 mm EDTA in phosphate-buffered saline, washed, and kept in suspension or plated for 30 min on 10 μg/ml fibronectin or 10 μg/ml αv integrin antibody-coated dishes. In some experiments dishes were coated with poly-l-lysine (PL), a nonspecific adhesive substrate, and postcoated with antibodies to the αv integrin subunit, a double coating that maximizes the rate of cell adhesion (33Moro L. Venturino M. Bozzo C. Silengo L. Altruda F. Beguinot L. Tarone G. Defilippi P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6622-6632Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar, 40Defilippi P. Bozzo C. Volpe G. Romano G. Venturino M. Silengo L. Tarone G. Cell Adhesion Commun. 1994; 2: 75-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). When indicated, human recombinant EGF, PP1, or AG1478 was added at the indicated dose. Cells were then washed with phosphate-buffered saline containing 5 mm EDTA, 10 mm NaF, 10 mm Na4P2O7, 1 mm Na3VO4, and detergent extracted in lysis buffer as described below. In the coimmunoprecipitation experiments, at the end of adhesion cells were incubated for 30 min at 4 °C in the presence of 30 μg/ml monoclonal antibodies to integrin subunits or to EGF receptor specifically to bind and immunoprecipitate cell surface molecules, washed three times, and detergent extracted. Cells were extracted with 1% Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 5 mm EDTA, 10 mm NaF, 10 mmNa4P2O7, 0.4 mmNa3VO4, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 4 μg/ml pepstatin, and 0.1 unit/ml aprotinin). Cell lysates were centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 10 min, and the supernatants were collected and assayed for protein concentration using the Bio-Rad protein assay method. Proteins were run on SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions. For immunoprecipitation experiments, proteins were immunoprecipitated with the appropriate antibody for 1 h at 4 °C as described previously (33Moro L. Venturino M. Bozzo C. Silengo L. Altruda F. Beguinot L. Tarone G. Defilippi P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6622-6632Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar) in the presence of 50 μl of protein A-Sepharose beads. In the coimmunoprecipitation experiments, integrins or EGF receptor were immunoprecipitated from the cell surface. At the end of adhesion, intact cells were incubated with anti-β3, anti-αv, or anti-EGF receptor mAbs to bind, respectively, αvβ3 integrin or EGF receptor exposed on the cell surface and detergent extracted. Protein A-Sepharose beads were then added to 3 mg of protein cell extract to collect immunoprecipitates. After SDS-PAGE, proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose, reacted with specific antibodies, and then detected with peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and chemoluminescent ECL reagent. When appropriate, the nitrocellulose membranes were stripped according to manufacturer's recommendations and reprobed. Densitometric analysis was performed using the GS 250 molecular imager (Bio-Rad). EGF receptor-containing bands were cut from the gel and destained overnight with a solution of 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate, 40% ethanol. The protein was digested in gel with trypsin (Promega) according to Hellman et al. (41Hellman U. Wernstedt C. Gonez J. Heldin C.H. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 224: 451-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar) except that the bands had been washed three times with acetonitrile before drying them in a speed vacuum concentrator. For matrix-assisted laser desorption-ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry, aliquots of 0.5 μl of the peptide mixtures were applied to a target disc and allowed to air dry. Subsequently, 0.5 μl of matrix solution (1% w/v α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid in 50% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid) was applied to the dried sample and again allowed to dry. Spectra were obtained using a Bruker Biflex III MALDI-TOF spectrometer (Bremen, Germany). For interpretation of the protein fragments the MASCOT program available at the Matrixscience web site (www.matrixscience.com) and the PeptideMass program available at Expasy web site (www.expasy.ch/tools/peptide-mass.html) were used. For immunoelectron microscopy, 10% gelatin-embedded, 2.3 m sucrose-infused blocks of aldehyde-fixed ECV304 cells were frozen in liquid nitrogen. Ultrathin cryosections were obtained with a Reichert-Jung Ultracut E with FC4E cryoattachment and collected on copper-formvar-carbon-coated grids. Single immunogold localization on ultrathin cryosections was performed as described previously (42Slot J.W. Geuze H.J. Polak J.M. Varndell I.M. Immunolabeling for Electron Microscopy.

Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 905-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). In particular, sections were immunostained with anti-human EGF receptor mAb AB-5 (Oncogene Science) followed by a rabbit anti-mouse bridging antibody (DAKO) and 15-nm protein A-gold. Control sections have been incubated without first antibodies. In all control sections no labeling was detected (not shown). Sections were examined with a Zeiss EM 902 electron microscope. We have shown recently that adhesion of human primary skin fibroblasts and ECV304 human cells to immobilized matrix proteins or to antibodies to integrin subunits stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation of the EGF receptor and association with β1 integrin (33Moro L. Venturino M. Bozzo C. Silengo L. Altruda F. Beguinot L. Tarone G. Defilippi P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6622-6632Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar). To investigate the molecular nature of the complex between integrins and the EGF receptor, we immunoprecipitated αvβ3 integrins from ECV304 cells adherent to αv ligand and performed Western blotting experiments. Fig. 1 A(top left panel) is an example of an integrin-EGF receptor complex identified in ECV304 cells. Western blotting with specific antibodies show that, in addition to the EGF receptor, the adaptor molecules p130Cas, Crk, and c-Src kinase, but not p125Fak, coimmunoprecipitate with αvβ3 integrin upon integrin-mediated adhesion (Fig. 1 A, left panel). Similar results were obtained by immunoprecipitating β1integrin in cells plated on fibronectin (Fig. 1 B and data not shown). Coimmunoprecipitation of the c-Src·Cas·Crk complex with integrins is strictly dependent on the presence of the EGF receptor because these molecules organize in a macromolecular complex only in ECV304 and EGF receptor-transfected NIH3T3 cells, expressing appreciably level of EGF receptor (20-40,000 molecules/cell), but not in wild type NIH3T3 that express barely detectable level of EGF receptor (Fig. 1 B). To investigate the kinetics of macromolecular complex formation, ECV304 cells were plated on dishes coated with αv ligand, and assembly of the macromolecular complex was analyzed at 5 and 15 min of adhesion. Integrins were immunoprecipitated from the cell surface, and immunoprecipitates were probed with antibodies to the EGF receptor, p130Cas, and c-Src kinase. Western blotting experiments indicate that these distinct components associate only when integrin is engaged and not when cells are attached on PL (Fig. 2 A) or kept in suspension (not shown). The macromolecular complex is clearly visible within 5 min of adhesion and becomes undetectable at 15 min, indicating that the association between these molecules is an early and transient event. The same kinetics is also obtained by immunoprecipitating the EGF receptor and blotting with antibodies for each component (data not shown). Previous results show that tyrosine phosphorylation of the EGF receptor is maximal within 30 min after plating on matrix proteins and then decreases, reaching basal levels within 4 h (33Moro L. Venturino M. Bozzo C. Silengo L. Altruda F. Beguinot L. Tarone G. Defilippi P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6622-6632Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar). In the experiments reported here, when cells were plated on integrin ligands, the EGF receptor was already phosphorylated at 5 min (Fig.2 B), showing that complex formation occurs concomitantly to EGF receptor phosphorylation. At 30 min of adhesion, when the complex is disassembled, tyrosine phosphorylation of EGF receptors remains high, indicating that at later times the kinetics of the two events are distinct. Therefore these results indicate that in the early phases of cells adhesion, integrin occupation leads to their association with EGF receptors in a transient macromolecular complex leading to sustained EGF receptor phosphorylation. We analyzed the activation state of the c-Src kinase present in the integrin-EGF receptor macromolecular complex using an antibody that recognizes phosphorylation of the critical tyrosine residue 416 in the Src kinase domain. c-Src is phosphorylated on tyrosine 416 when ECV304 cells are plated on integrin ligands, indicating that integrin-mediated adhesion induces c-Src kinase autophosphorylation (Fig.3 A). In ECV304 cells plated on αv ligand for 5 min, c-Src phosphorylated on tyrosine 416 is detectable in integrin immunoprecipitates from adherent cells but is absent in cells plated on PL (Fig. 3 B, bottom panel), indicating that c-Src is activated after adhesion and that activated c-Src complexes with integrins and EGF receptors. To test whether c-Src kinase activity is required for assembly of the integrin-EGF receptor complex, coimmunoprecipitation experiments were performed in cells exposed to PP1, a specific Src kinase inhibitor (Fig. 3 A). After PP1 treatment, EGF receptors, p130Cas, and c-Src were not detectable in the immunoprecipitates of αvβ3 integrin (Fig. 3 B), suggesting that inhibition of c-Src kinase activity prevents macromolecular complex assembly. These results were confirmed by expression of a kinase negative form of c-Src. In ECV304 cells expressing the mutant Src kinase form the amount of EGF receptor in the integrin immunoprecipitate is strongly reduced, as well as that of p130Cas and c-Src (Fig. 3 C). Similar results were obtained in c-Src−/− fibroblasts (not shown). Therefore these data indicate that c-Src is needed for the assembly of the integrin-EGF receptor complex. We also evaluated the role of EGF receptor kinase in modulating EGF receptor association with integrins by using tyrphostin AG1478, a specific inhibitor of EGF receptor kinase, in the coimmunoprecipitation experiments. As shown in Fig. 3 D, in the presence of tyrphostin AG1478, EGF receptors and p130Cas are not detectable in the integrin immunoprecipitate, whereas c-Src is still present, even if reduced, indicating that EGF receptor kinase activity is necessary for its ability to associate with integrins but is not required for association between integrins and c-Src. The data shown above indicate that c-Src kinase is required to trigger integrin/EGF receptor association. We then tested whether c-Src kinase is also necessary for integrin-dependent EGF receptor phosphorylation. When cells are exposed to the Src kinase inhibitor PP1, tyrosine phosphorylation of EGF receptors induced by integrin-mediated adhesion is strongly reduced (Fig. 4 A). Similarly, expression of a kinase negative form of c-Src strongly affects integrin-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of EGF receptor but only slightly modifies tyrosine phosphorylation in response to EGF (Fig. 4, B and C). Similar results were obtained using 10 or 50 ng/ml EGF (data not shown). This result indicates that c-Src kinase has a primary role in integrin-dependent EGF receptor tyrosine phosphorylation. It is well established that p125Fak is regulated by integrin-mediated adhesion and is a good substrate for Src kinase (for review, see Refs.3Defilippi P. Gismondi A. Santoni A. Tarone G.

Acta. 1996; 1287: 73-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The involvement of p125Fak kinase in integrin-dependent EGF receptor activation has been tested by comparing p125Fak−/− MEFs with wild type cells (38Ilic D. Furuta Y. Kanazawa S. Takeda N. Sobue K. Nakatsuji N. Nomura S. Fujimoto J. Okada M. Yamamoto T. Aizawa S. Nature. 1995; 377: 539-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (1576) Google Scholar). p125Fak−/− cells plated on fibronectin show the same extent of EGF receptor phosphorylation as the wild type MEFs (Fig. 4 D), indicating that p125Fak is not involved in EGF receptor phosphorylation. In addition, expression of a kinase-defective (CD2FakK454R) and of a tyrosine autophosphorylation mutant (CD2FakY397F) of p125Fak in ECV304 cells does not affect EGF receptor tyrosine phosphorylation after adhesion (data not shown), further supporting the conclusion that p125Fak is not required for integrin-mediated signaling leading to EGF receptor phosphorylation. The experiments reported above underline that EGF receptors transiently associate with integrins in combination with other molecules known to be involved in integrin-dependent signal transduction, such as the adaptor protein p130Cas (44Nojima Y. Mimura T. Morino N. Hamasaki K. Furuya H. Sakai R. Nakamoto T. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. Hum. Cell. 1996; 9: 169-174PubMed Google Scholar).

Generally, HTH proteins bind as dimers, 2-fold symmetric DNA sequences in which each monomer recognizes a half-site. This group is now considered as a reference for understanding the general rules that govern protein-DNA interactions (9.Pabo C.O. Sauer R.T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1984; 53: 293-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (1022) Google Scholar, 10.Wintjens R. Rooman M. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 262: 294-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar) and has also become a favorite target for evolutionary studies (8.Nguyen C.C. Saier Jr., M.H.

Among HTH transcriptional regulators, families have been identified throughout sequence comparisons and phylogenetic, structural, and functional analyses focused on DNA-binding domains and almost exclusively on the HTH structure, which is the only active motif that shows strong similarities among all members of the group (1.Haydon D.J. Guest J.R. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1991; 63: 291-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 4.Henikoff S. Haughn G.W. Calvo J.M. Wallace J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

These comparative studies have led to the determination of a specific HTH consensus pattern or signature for each family, providing the basis for a simple method of classification and detection of new members (12.Karmirantzou M. Hamodrakas S.J. Protein Eng. 2001; 14: 465-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The lack of significant similarity among regions involved in effector binding or oligomerization systematically excludes these domains during families signature establishment, although they have important roles in the regulating process. In fact, it is often the oligomerization between regulatory subunits and/or the conformational changes due to the binding or the removal of the inducing/repressing molecule that allows correct HTH motif disposition and the subsequent DNA binding ability of the whole regulatory protein. The link between the two regions is therefore more intimate than it first appears from a unique amino acids comparison and may also be reflected in the DNA operator sequences, the third structural element involved in gene regulation. To argue for the existence of a link between regions involved in the regulating process, we analyzed the HTH GntR family of bacterial regulators. As determined thus far, the family comprises about 270 members distributed among the most diverse bacterial groups and regulating the most various biological processes. This family was first described by Haydon and Guest in 1991 (1.Haydon D.J. Guest J.R. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1991; 63: 291-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar) and was named after GntR, the repressor of the gluconate operon in Bacillus subtilis (13.Fujita Y. Fujita T. Miwa Y. Nihashi J.-I. Aratani Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 13744-13753Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,14.Reizer A. Deutscher J. Saier Jr., M.H. Reizer J. Mol. Microbiol. 1991; 5: 1081-1089Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Our interest in the properties of these bacterial regulators arises from the identification by our laboratory of the xlnRgene (15.Giannotta F. Eléments cis et Trans dans la Régulation de la Xylanase C de Streptomyces sp. EC3.Ph.D. thesis. Université de Liège, Belgium1998Google Scholar) in which chromosomal disruption in Streptomyces lividans relieves various extracellular enzymatic systems from glucose repression. The first purpose of this report is to present, 10 years after the first comparative study, an update of the GntR family description. Moreover, we decided to analyze the full-length sequence of the proteins through amino acid comparisons, secondary structure predictions, phylogenetic tree construction, and functional analysis in order to find hidden specific characteristics among the regions that are generally not considered. Analyses that extended to the regions outside of the DNA-binding domain could lead to a more precise family signature and should define the subfamilies. Members of the GntR family were identified from the SWISS-PROT/TrEMBL/GenBankTMsequence data bases (last update, June 2001) by a keywords search on the ExPASy molecular Biology server and NCBI server. 2Found on the Web at www.expasy.ch and www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov, respectively. All sequences proposed by the data bases as belonging to the GntR family were used as query sequences for a BLAST search to verify their N-terminal DNA-binding domain homology to other GntR-like regulators. Incorrectly GntR-like classified proteins by sequence data bases, i.e. the Irr protein from Bradyrhizobium japonicum (16.Hamza I. Chauhan S. Hassett R. O'Brian M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21669-21674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), were rejected from our comparative study. Fragment of sequences were rejected too. We finally collected and analyzed about 270 members. For ease and usefulness of presentation, the best studied regulators (13.Fujita Y. Fujita T. Miwa Y. Nihashi J.-I. Aratani Y. J. Biol.

The 56 proteins discussed and presented in this paper are listed in Table I.Table IList of the HTH GntR-like regulators presented in our comparative study Open table in a new tab To identify homologous C-terminal sequences within the HTH GntR family, we started our comparative study from the level of the secondary structures, in which conservation is known to be less eroded during evolution. Secondary structure predictions result from the compilation of PSI-pred, Predict Protein, Sspro, and Jpred automated prediction programs on the PredictProtein server. 3Found on the Web at dodo.cpmc.columbia.edu. To improve the validity of our consensus prediction approach, we compared the theoretical model that we obtained for FadR (fatty acid-responsive regulator in Escherichia coli) to its experimentally resolved tertiary structure (52.van Aalten D.M.F. DiRusso C.C. Knudsen J. Wierenga R.K. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5167-5177Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 53.van Aalten D.M.F. DiRusso C.C. Knudsen J. EMBO J. 2001; 80: 2041-2050Crossref Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The method was revealed to have an accuracy of >90% for FadR with most of the inaccuracies occurring at the boundaries of the secondary structure elements. Multiple alignments were developed with the MULTIALIN (54.Corpet F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 10881-10890Crossref PubMed Scopus (4347) Google Scholar) and CLUSTALW (55.Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (56002) Google Scholar) 4Found on the Web at protein.toulouse.inra.fr/multialin and npsa-pbil.ib.cp.fr, respectively. programs, included in the ExPASy multiple alignment tool, followed by manual improvement by eye according to the predicted secondary structures. The advantage of these alignments resides in the integration of the structural reality of the proteins. Distances between aligned proteins were computed with the PRODIST program using maximum likelihood estimates on the Dayhoff PAM matrix (56.Young C.L. Barker W.C. Tomaselli C.M. Dayhoff M.O. Dayhoff M.O. Atlas of Protein Sequence and Structure. 5, Suppl. 3. National Biochemical Foundation, Silver Spring, MD1979: 73-93Google Scholar). The FITCH program estimated phylogenies from distances in the matrix data using the Fitch-Margoliash algorithm (57.Fitch W.M. Margoliash E. Science. 1967; 155: 279-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (2421) Google Scholar), and phylogenetic trees were drawn using the TREEVIEW program (58.Page R.D.M. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1996; 12: 357-358PubMed Google Scholar). PRODIST and FITCH programs are included in the PHYLIP package developed by Feldenstein (59.Felsenstein J. Cladistics. 1989; 5: 164-166Google Scholar). As mentioned by Haydon and Guest (1.Haydon D.J. Guest J.R. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1991; 63: 291-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar), members of the GntR family of bacterial regulators share similar N-terminal DNA-binding domains, but high heterogeneity has been observed among the various C-terminal effector-binding and oligomerization domains. In order to elucidate the C-terminal dissimilarity, the characterization of the N- and C-terminal domains was done separately. The construction of a phylogenetic tree deduced from the full-length multiple alignment of GntR-like members revealed that the C-terminal heterogeneity was limited to four E-b/O types. In fact, we can see in Fig. 1 four major and distinct clusters of branches. By the same way, two-dimensional structural predictions revealed four major types of E-b/O structural domain topologies (Fig. 2,a–d) with discrete variants in each subfamily and very few proteins (7%) escaping from this subdivision. The presence of four major types of C-terminal topologies suggests at least four different E-b/O domain donor-ancestors for the fusion to a common type of DNA-binding domain. Once the fusion occurred between the two domains, the high similarity level (55%) calculated suggests that proteins within a subfamily arose by duplication events.Figure 2Structure-based sequence alignment of the C-terminal domains of proteins of the GntR family.

In this subfamily, the proteins consist of an all-helical C-terminal domain (Fig. 2a) with seven or six α-helices for the FadR and VanR subgroups, respectively. VanR-like regulators certainly derive from FadR-like proteins, as they only diverge by the loss of the first α-helix (α4). The average C-terminal length of the FadR and VanR subgroups is, respectively, about 170 and 150 amino acids. The crystal structure of the C-terminal domain of FadR (Protein Data Bank code 1EX2) has been determined (52.van Aalten D.M.F. DiRusso C.C. Knudsen J. Wierenga R.K. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5167-5177Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 53.van Aalten D.M.F. DiRusso C.C. Knudsen J. EMBO J. 2001; 80: 2041-2050Crossref Scopus (132) Google Scholar) and, according to our comparative study, its relative three-dimensional data could be used as a scaffold to orient studies to the entire subfamily. Most of the FadR-like proteins are involved in the regulation of oxidized substrates related to amino acids metabolism or at the crossroads of various metabolic pathways such as aspartate (AnsR), pyruvate (PdhR), glycolate (GlcC), galactonate (DgoR), lactate (LldR), malonate (MatR), or gluconate (GntR). In the second proposed subfamily, the C-terminal domain contains both α-helical and β-sheet structures arranged as shown in Fig. 2b. The subfamily is named HutC and comprises 31% of GntR-like regulators among which the cluster of proteins involved in conjugative plasmid transfer in various Streptomyces species (i.e. KorSA, KorA, and TraR proteins). The average length of the C-terminal domain is about 170 amino acids and, so far, no three-dimensional structural data on it are available. In this subfamily, the conservation of the structural elements has been altered at several positions (see for instance, β3,α7, and β6 in Fig. 2b). The observed altered E-b/O topology could be the result of structural accommodation in response to the most diverse biological processes regulated by HutC-like members. In the third subfamily, called MocR, the E-b/O domain is immediately distinguishable from others because of its exceptional average length of about 350 amino acids and its homology to the class I of aminotransferase proteins (61.Sung M.H. Tanizawa K. Tanaka H. Kuramitsu S. Kagamiyama H. Hirotsu K. Okamoto A. Higuchi T. Soda K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2567-2572Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (see Fig. 2d). These proteins catalyze the reversible transfer of an amino group from the amino acid substrate to an acceptor α-keto acid. They require pyridoxal 5′-phosphate (PLP) as a cofactor to catalyze this reaction. Transamination reactions are of central importance in amino acid metabolism and in links to carbohydrate and fat metabolism. This class of aminotransferases acts as dimers in a head-to-tail configuration (62.Ko T.-P. Wu S.-P. Yang W.-Z. Tsai H. Yuan H.S. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 1474-1477Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Each subunit binds one molecule of PLP through an aldimide linkage with the ε-amino group of the conserved lysine residue in the PLP attachment site. The observed modular association to an aminotransferase-like C-terminal domain suggests that similar dimerization should occur in MocR-like proteins and that PLP is required as a cofactor for their regulating activity. The most relevant evidence comes from PdxR in Streptomyces venezuelae, which is involved directly in the regulation of pyridoxal phosphate synthesis (47.Magarvey N. He J. Aidoo K.A. Vining L.C. Microbiology. 2001; 147: 2103-2112Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The fourth subfamily possesses a reduced C-terminal domain with only two α-helices (Fig. 2c). The subfamily, that we called YtrA, is the less represented with only 6% of GntR-like regulators, most of these forming part of operons involved in ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transport systems. As it emerges from the alignment of YtrA-like proteins (Fig. 2c), the weaker identity observed between members suggest that the C-terminal domain has undergone some molecular recombinations or that the origins of the E-b/O domain could be multiple. The average length of the putative E-b/O domain is about 50 amino acids, and according to Yoshida et al. (49.Yoshida K.-I. Fujita Y. Ehrlich S.D. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 5454-5461Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), this length should be too small to accommodate effector binding. Dimerization should remain possible, as numerous GntR-like palindromic operator sequences have been observed in the corresponding upstream regions (see “Operator Site Analysis” below). The presence of many positively or negatively charged as well as hydrophobic and aromatic residues at the end of the domain suggests that dimer formation should occur through classical salt bridges and side-chain-side-chain hydrophobic interactions. As shown in Fig. 3, structural predictions revealed that the DNA-binding (D-b) domain topology of the whole GntR family is rather well conserved and all of the secondary structure elements are in similar relative positions. It consists of three α-helices and two (sometimes three) β-sheets disposed as follow: α1α2α3β1β2. According to FadR structural data, we can consider that the N-terminal DNA-binding domain of all GntR-like members contains a small β-sheet core and three α-helices, the HTH motif being formed by helices α2 and α3. The average amino acids identity obtained for the DNA-binding domain of the entire GntR-family is about 25%. The level obtained is relatively low compared, for instance, with the LacI/GalR HTH family (45%). Thus, evidences of a common DNA-binding domain ancestor for the whole GntR family are highlighted by the conserved structural topology rather than by amino acids conservation. When subfamilies are analyzed separately, the levels of identity and similarity rise to 40 and 60%, respectively. Therefore, the C-terminal structural subdivision is reflected on the DNA-binding domain and on the HTH motif itself. In fact, significantly different HTH consensus sequences have been obtained for each subfamily (Fig. 3) except between MocR and YtrA, where the differences are very weak. The fusion between the D-b domain and the E-b/O domain should have occurred separately for the FadR, HutC, and MocR/YtrA subfamilies, and none of the four subfamilies has emerged from one of the three others by internal molecular rearrangements. The high level of similarity observed between the D-b domains of the MocR and YtrA subfamilies also appears in the phylogenetic tree obtained from full-length multiple alignment (Fig. 1). In fact, the two clusters arise from a common branch, highlighting a conserved amino acids composition in their N-terminal region. One of these two subfamilies could have emerged from the other through C-terminal domain replacement. Only a few “anomalies” have been found in the two-dimensional N-terminal structural consensus (α1α2α3β1β2). The most frequent anomalies were the lack of the first α-helix (α1) (NtaR from Chelatobacter heintzii and EmoR from the EDTA-degrading bacterium, BNC1) or the presence of an additional helix upstream of α1 (i.e. WhiH from Streptomyces aureofaciens or PdxR from S. venezuelae). We have also noticed that among YtrA regulators, a third, additional β-sheet is frequently predicted before α1. Although there is no precise “recognition code” involving a one-to-one correspondence between amino acid side chains and the base pairs in the DNA (9.Pabo C.O. Sauer R.T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1984; 53: 293-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (1022) Google Scholar), it is logical to suppose that highly conserved DNA-binding motifs may bind similar operator sequences. The known or putative inverted repeat operator sites recognized by some GntR-like proteins are compiled in Table II according to our previous C-terminal classification. Looking at the entire family, we observed that almost all bound sites are organized around a constant palindromic 5′-(N)yGT(N)xAC(N)y-3′ sequence. The most important divergence among the various operator sites resides in the number (y) and the nature (N) of the nucleotides that surround the above consensus sequence. Therefore, as observed by Weickert and Adhya (6.Weickert M.J. Adhya S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15869-15874Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) for the LacI/GalR family, the center of the palindrome seems to be highly conserved, whereas the peripheral regions diverge. The similar structural environment that resides at the center of the operator is generally considered the molecule-attracting region for these regulators, whereas the peripheral zones perform the operator discrimination role.Table IIComparison of known and predicted palindromic operator sites of GntR-like bacterialFor function, bacterial strain, and accession numbers related to the protein abbreviations, see Table I. p, k, and cPutative, known, and consensus sequences, respectively. 1GlcC from Pseudomonas aeruginosa; 2Half-site of a directed repeat.

Mismatched bases are not highlighted and are shown in lowercase letters. TreR01 means operator number one of the TreR protein. The other relevant divergence between operators resides between the 5′-GT and 3′-AC conserved base pairs. In fact, although there are almost exclusively A and T residues, their number (x) and disposition seems to differ from a subfamily to another. In the FadR and HutC subfamilies we deduced as the consensus 5′-t.GTa.tAC.a-3′ and 5′-GT.ta.AC-3′, respectively. Moreover, the distance between the half-sites is known to be of maximal importance for a correct operator site presentation on the DNA surface according to the flexibility of the linker between the DNA-binding and the E-b/O domains (72.Dunn T.M. Hahn S. Odgen S. Schleif R.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 5017-5020Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar, 73.Oertel-Buchheit P. Schmidt-Dörr T. Granger-Scharr M. Schnarr M. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 229: 1-7Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 74.Carra J.H. Schleif R.F. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 35-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 75.Harmer T. Wu M. Schleif R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 427-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). This distance varies weakly among the FadR and HutC subfamilies, although it fluctuates widely among the YtrA-like regulators. In this last subfamily, the conserved 5′-GT and 3′-AC residues are found sometimes far from the center of the palindrome. This larger variation among YtrA operators could be attributed to the low complexity of their C-terminal domains, which, added to weaker amino acid conservation, results in a mode of dimer formation specific for each member of the subfamily. So far, no cis-acting elements have been determined experimentally for the actual studied regulators of the MocR subfamily (PtsJ, PdxR, and MocR), preventing us from determining homologous putative sequences in their promoter regions. This subfamily presents another problem; most of these proteins are of unknown function, and therefore most of the regions upstream of the regulated genes are not available. A comparative study of the upstream regions of MocR-like genes did not revealed any palindromic sequence common to the whole subfamily, and very few MocR-like proteins presented weakly similar putative GntR-like operator. These results suggest either that there is another type of cis-acting element specific to the MocR-like regulators or that autoregulation is not widespread among them. To have an idea of the topology of cis-acting elements typical of the MocR subfamily, interesting data should come from crystallographic studies of the class I aminotransferases. In fact, as highlighted for the tyrosine aminotransferase (TyrB; Swiss-Prot accession no. P04693, Protein Data Bank code 3TAT) from E. coli (61.Sung M.H. Tanizawa K. Tanaka H. Kuramitsu S. Kagamiyama H. Hirotsu K. Okamoto A. Higuchi T. Soda K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2567-2572Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), these proteins present a head-to-tail type of dimerization. As shown in Fig. 4, the head-to-tail configuration is not adapted to inverted repeats but is more appropriate to binding directed repeats that are sufficiently spaced to form DNA looping. Therefore, the lack of typical GntR-like operator sequences in the promoter regions of MocR-like regulators could be attributed to how these proteins should form dimers. The deduced consensus operator sequences presented in Table IIcan be used as rapid operator site predicting tools. We tried to detect some of these on Streptomyces coelicolor genome to highlight genes in which expression could be regulated by a member of the HTH GntR-family. We chose the S. coelicolor genome for our investigation because of the exceptional large quantity of GntR-like members sequenced in this strain. A rapid and non-exhaustive search using the DNA motif program 5Found on the Web at sanger.ac.uk/Projects/Scoelicolor/. revealed about 20 promoter regions that possess a putative GntR-like palindromic sequence. According to the observed reflected C-terminal heterogeneity on operator sequences, the number of putative candidates in binding a specific GntR-like operator site is now reduced, as an investigation of the members of a subfamily would be preferred. However, we must also mention that few GntR-like regulators recognize operator sites that do not fit into the consensus sequences presented in Table II. It is the case for TraR (44.Servı́n-González L. Sampieri III, A. Cabello J. Galván L. Juárez V. Castro C. Microbiol. 1995; 141: 2499-2510Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 76.Kataoka M. Kosono S. Seki T. Yoshida T. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 7291-7298Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), AphS and BphS (18.Arai H. Akahira S. Ohishi T. Kudo T. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 33: 1132-1140Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 19.Watanabe T. Inoue R. Kimura N. Furukawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31016-31023Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), and FucR (51.Hooper L.V. Xu J. Falk P.G. Midtvedt T. Gordon J.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9833-9838Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar), which bind boxes with no clearly defined symmetrical properties. Thus, although the consensus sequences presented in Table II should be regarded as interesting tools, for instance, in making sequencing projects maximally useful, they certainly should not be considered as unerring references, and some GntR regulators should not fit with the general properties highlighted in this study. The structural, phylogenetic, and functional analysis of about 270 members of the bacterial HTH GntR-family led us to limit the C-terminal E-b/O domain heterogeneity to four major subfamilies that we called FadR, HutC, MocR, and YtrA. The presence of a few proteins escaping from this subdivision suggests that other subfamilies may be identified soon. Among members presenting a C-terminal domain that diverges from the four subfamilies defined above, the most interesting case comes from AraR in B. subtilis. The protein presents a GntR-like DNA-binding domain and a C-terminal domain that is GntR-like and a C-terminal domain typical of the HTH LacI/GalR family. AraR is a hybrid protein that is able to bind operator sites (AaACTTGT/A/T/ACAAGTaT) (50.Mota L.J. Tavares P. Sá-Nogueira I. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 33: 476-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) that presents the typical GntR signature, and its C-terminal domain binds to a carbohydrate effector molecule (l-arabinose) as do most of the members of the LacI/GalR family. Recently, some proteins presenting this mosaic modular association have been sequenced (i.e. RliB from Lactococcus lactis, ssp. lactis, Swiss-Prot accession no. Q9CFH6; SPY1602 from Streptococcus pyogenes, Swiss-Prot accession no. Q99YP7; CAC1340 from Clostridium acetobutylicum, Swiss-Prot accession no. Q97JE6), confirming in a short time the emergence of new subfamilies. The fact that C-terminal E-b/O heterogeneity seems to be reflected in the DNA-binding domain and in operator sequences suggests the existence of a tight link between the three regions involved in the regulatory process. This is not really surprising as in vivo, in the evolutionary process, once a gene and its upstream region present a successful functional combination between the three regions involved in gene regulation, it seems legitimate that descendants emerging through gene duplication would present a relative conservation throughout the duplicated sequence. Conservation between the three regions could also be explained from a structural and functional point of view. Dimerization certainly imposes steric constraints on the D-b domain, reducing its mobility with respect to the rest of the protein. According to the studies realized on AraC (72.Dunn T.M. Hahn S. Odgen S. Schleif R.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 5017-5020Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar, 74.Carra J.H. Schleif R.F.

A. 2001; 98: 427-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) (XylS/AraC HTH family) and LexA (73.Oertel-Buchheit P. Schmidt-Dörr T. Granger-Scharr M. Schnarr M. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 229: 1-7Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar), both from E. coli, such a restricted mobility is thought to be due to interactions between the D-b and E-b/O domains and/or to interactions of part of the linker region with one of the two structural domains. These interactions might explain why a regulatory protein is limited, for instance, in its ability to accommodate a wide variation in distances between half-sites of palindromic operator sequences or to form DNA looping when cis-acting elements are separated by a nonintegral number of helix turn. Works on LexA show that the DNA binding ability of a specific domain can be enhanced or diminished by fusing the D-b domain with some alternative dimerization domains (73.Oertel-Buchheit P. Schmidt-Dörr T. Granger-Scharr M. Schnarr M. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 229: 1-7Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar). These results obtained in vitro could explain why in vivo, among a family that presents a conserved DNA-binding domain, we observed different operator consensus sequences according to the E-b/O heterogeneity. Finally, we have also delimited how far the information relative to a unique protein can constitute the theoretical and experimental framework of the other members of the family. According to our comparative study, the structural data relative to the FadR protein (52.van Aalten D.M.F. DiRusso C.C. Knudsen J. Wierenga R.K. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5167-5177Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 53.van Aalten D.M.F. DiRusso C.C. Knudsen J. EMBO J. 2001; 80: 2041-2050Crossref Scopus (132) Google Scholar) should be regarded as a reference for the whole GntR-family concerning the DNA-binding domain but must be limited to the FadR subfamily concerning the E-b/O domain. Moreover, because of the daily increasing amount of genome sequences listed, it seems essential to update and extend the early comparative studies realized on other families to make sequencing projects maximally useful.

Based on reports that ENaC may be regulated by extracellular serine protease activity in Xenopus and mouse renal epithelia, we sought to identify proteases that serve similar functions in human airway epithelia.

Functional studies in theXenopus oocyte expression system demonstrated that prostasin increased ENaC currents 60–80%, whereas TMPRSS2 markedly decreased ENaC currents and protein levels. Studies of primary nasal epithelial cultures in Ussing chambers revealed that inhibition of endogenous serine protease activity with aprotinin markedly decreased ENaC-mediated currents and sensitized the epithelia to subsequent channel activation by exogenous trypsin.

Nature. 1994; 367: 463-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (1739) Google Scholar) constitutes the rate-limiting step of sodium transport across many epithelia, including the kidney, colon, and lung (2Garty H. Palmer L.G. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 359-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (1025) Google Scholar). In the kidney, the regulation of ENaC activity is necessary for the proper maintenance of total body extracellular volume and blood pressure and is responsive to systemic hormonal signals, such as aldosterone and vasopressin. In the lung, regulated ENaC activity is essential for the maintenance of airway surface liquid (ASL) volume/depth. The physiologic importance of the relationship between ENaC activity in airways and ASL volume is highlighted by two disease states, cystic fibrosis (CF) and pseudohypoaldosteronism type 1. In CF, the loss of functional cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein results in excessive ENaC activity (3Stutts M.J. Canessa C.M. Olsen J.C. Hamrick M. Cohn J.A.

Science. 1983; 221: 1067-1070Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar), and ASL volume depletion (6Jiang C. Finkbeiner W.E. Widdicombe J.H. McCray Jr., P.B. Miller S.S. Science. 1993; 262: 424-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). The depletion of ASL volume, in turn, causes the overlying mucus gel to collapse onto cilia and the cell surface, thus disrupting mucociliary clearance (7Matsui H. Grubb B. Tarran R. Randell S. Gatzy J. Davis C. Boucher R. Cell. 1998; 95: 1005-1015Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (918) Google Scholar). In contrast to CF, pseudohypoaldosteronism type 1 patients have mutations in genes encoding ENaC subunits, which result in diminished sodium absorption, increased ASL volume, and markedly accelerated rates of mucociliary clearance (8Kerem E. Bistritzer T. Hanukoglu A. Hofmann T. Zhou Z. Bennett W. MacLaughlin E. Barker P. Nash M. Quittell L. Boucher R. Knowles M.R. N. Engl. J. Med. 1999; 341: 156-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). CF and pseudohypoaldosteronism type 1, therefore, provide striking evidence that regulated ENaC activity is a prime determinant of ASL volume and mucociliary function. The regulation of ENaC has proven to be tissue-specific, and many previously characterized mechanisms pertinent to ENaC activity in the kidney may not be relevant in airway epithelia. For example, dietary salt intake and circulating mineralocorticoid levels modulate ENaC activity in the kidney but do not affect ENaC function in airways (9Knowles M.R. Gatzy J.T. Boucher R.C. Pediatr. Res. 1985; 19: 676-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Similarly, while signals that raise intracellular cAMP in the kidney (e.g. vasopressin) increase ENaC currents by stimulating channel insertion into the plasma membrane (10Frindt G. Palmer L.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: F1086-F1092PubMed Google Scholar, 11Frindt G. Silver R.B. Windhager E.E. Palmer L.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: F480-F489Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), this second messenger pathway has little effect on amiloride-sensitive currents in normal airways (4Stutts M.J. Rossier B.C. Boucher R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14037-14040Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Finally, while patients with Liddle's syndrome manifest renal sodium hyperabsorption due to ENaC mutations (12Abriel H. Loffing J. Rebhun J.F. Pratt J.H. Schild L. Horisberger J.D. Rotin D. Staub O.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2371-2380Crossref PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar), they do not appear to have sodium hyperabsorption across airway epithelia (15Stutts M.J. Homolya V. Robinson J. Zhou J. Boucher R.C. Knowles M.R. Pediatr. Pulmonol. Suppl. 1998; 15 (abstr.): A77Google Scholar). Based upon these differences, we speculate that 1) ENaC regulation is tissue-specific and 2) local regulators responding to stimuli in the immediate channel vicinity, rather than systemic signals, are likely to play a dominant role in the lung. Vallet et al. (16Vallet V. Chraibi A. Gaeggeller H.P. Horisberger J.D. Rossier B.C. Nature. 1997; 389: 607-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar) identified one such candidate for the local regulation of ENaC in 1997. These investigators cloned a trypsin family serine protease, xCAP1 (channel-activating protease), from a Xenopus kidney epithelial cell line (A6) using a functional complementation assay designed to detect activators of ENaC in the Xenopus oocyte expression system. In this assay, a 2–3-fold activation of ENaC was observed when xCAP1 was coexpressed with rat or Xenopus ENaC in oocytes. This effect appeared to rely on extracellular xCAP1 protease activity, since incubation in media containing a serine protease inhibitor (aprotinin) prevented ENaC activation. Northern analyses identified message for xCAP1 inXenopus tissues where ENaC was also expressed, including the kidney, gut, lung, and skin. They further showed that endogenous serine protease activity regulated basal ENaC currents in theXenopus A6 renal epithelial cell line. As in studies of xCAP1 in oocytes, inhibition of extracellular serine protease activity with aprotinin significantly diminished ENaC currents, whereas the subsequent addition of exogenous trypsin rapidly increased amiloride-sensitive sodium transport. The first mammalian homologue of xCAP1 was identified in a mouse kidney cell line (mpkCCDc14) by RT-PCR with degenerate primers (17Vuagniaux G. Vallet V. Jaeger N.F. Pfister C. Bens M. Farman N. Courtois-Coutry N. Vandewalle A. Rossier B.C. Hummler E. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2000; 11: 828-834Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The mouse homologue, mCAP1, increased amiloride-sensitive currents approximately 6-fold when coexpressed in Xenopus oocytes. Aprotinin treatment of the mpkCCDc14 cell line to inhibit endogenous serine protease activity again reduced amiloride-sensitive currents. The current study was designed to identify human serine proteases expressed in the airway epithelia that may be important regulators of ENaC activity. We used RT-PCR and cDNA library screening techniques to search for sequences with homology to xCAP1 that are expressed by human tracheobronchial airway epithelial cells. Two separate clones were obtained by these methods, which were identical to previously cloned serine proteases, prostasin and TMPRSS2. The expression pattern in the lung and functional effects on ENaC in Xenopusoocytes were also tested. Finally, the importance of serine protease activity for ENaC regulation in airway tissues was examined using primary cultures of nasal airway epithelial cells. Based on these data, we propose that prostasin is the human homologue of xCAP1 and is involved in regulation of ENaC activity in the lung. Human nasal tissues were obtained from patients (mean age 42.8 years; range 19–58 years) undergoing rhinologic procedures (e.g. turbinectomy). Upper and lower airway sections were obtained from excess donor lung tissue during lung transplantation procedures. All human tissue protocols were reviewed and approved by the University of North Carolina Committee for the Protection of the Rights of Human Subjects. For RNA isolation and cDNA library preparation, trachea and third to sixth generation airways were dissected and incised longitudinally. Guanidine thiocyanate was applied directly to the surface epithelium for 1–2 min, and the epithelial digest was removed by scraping the surface with a glass slide. RNA was isolated by CsCl centrifugation, and the integrity was confirmed by gel electrophoresis. Microscopic examination of the tissue sections established that the superficial epithelium was effectively removed from the underlying structure. A portion of the isolated RNA was reverse transcribed, and a cDNA library was constructed using the ZAP-cDNA Synthesis Kit (Stratagene) as per the manufacturer's instructions. Four degenerate primers were designed, based on the amino acid sequence of xCAP1 (outer 5′, primer A (5′-GACTATGGCGCGCCGGNAA(A/G)TT(T/C)CCNTGGCA(A/G)GT-3′); outer 3′, primer B (5′-GACTATTTAATTAATANACNCCNGGNC(G/T)(A/G)TTNGG-3′); nested 5′, primer C (5′-GACTATGGCGCGCCACNGCNGCNCA(T/C)TG (T/C)TT(T/C)CC-3′); nested 3′, primer D (5′-GACTATTTAATTAACCN (G/C)(A/T)(A/G)TCNCC(T/C)TG(A/G)CANGC-3′)). After 40 cycles of RT-PCR on human tracheobronchial RNA with primer combinations A-B, A-D, C-B, and C-D, the PCR products were reamplified with the appropriate nested primer(s) for another 40 cycles of PCR, separated on a 1.2% agarose gel, excised, purified, and ligated into the pCR2.1 vector with the TA cloning kit (Invitrogen). Transformants were screened for inserts following EcoRI digestion, and positive clones were sequenced by chain termination automated sequencing. A search for other relevant serine proteases was performed by screening a human cDNA tracheobronchial epithelial library under low stringency conditions with the 654-bp PCR product amplified using the A-B primers. Library filters were incubated in prehybridization solution (50% formamide; 1 h) and then exposed to [α32P]dCTP-labeled probe (Random Primed labeling kit; Roche Molecular Biochemicals) in hybridization solution (30% formamide; 37 °C) overnight. Filters were then sequentially washed with 2× SSC, 0.1% SDS (2 × 15 min) and with 0.5× SSC, 0.1% SDS (2 × 15 min) at 37 °C before exposing to radiographic film overnight at −80 °C. Positive clones were released by in vivo phage excision and identified by chain termination automated sequencing. Further library screening with full-length probes encoding xCAP1, prostasin, and TMPRSS2 was also performed under the identical conditions described above. For in situ hybridization studies, tissues were rapidly dissected from several regions (nasal, tracheal, and distal lung) and snap frozen in OCT embedding compound, typically within 30 min of tissue resection. Distal lung sections were frozen on dry ice following inflation with a 1:1 solution of OCT embedding compound and phosphate-buffered saline. Thin sections (8 μm) were cut by a cryothome and mounted on glass slides. Tissue sections were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 60 min, dehydrated through a graded alcohol series, and stored desiccated at −20 °C until analyzed. In situ hybridization was performed as previously described (18Rochelle L.G. Li D.C. Ye H. Lee E. Talbot C.R. Boucher R.C. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: L14-L24Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Fragments of the prostasin (bp 584–1039) and TMPRSS2 (bp 801–1205) coding regions were subcloned into the pBluescript KS+ vector, and 35S-UTP-labeled sense and antisense riboprobes were synthesized by in vitro transcription with the appropriate RNA polymerase (Promega). Cryosections were air-dried, digested with proteinase K (10 μg/ml; 30 min at 30 °C), and hybridized with the appropriate 35S-UTP-labeled riboprobe (∼5 × 106 cpm in 50 μl). After washing and RNase treatment, tissue sections were coated with photographic emulsion (Kodak NTB-2) and exposed for 5–14 days. Sections were then developed, counterstained with hematoxylin and eosin, and examined with a Nikon microphot SA microscope connected to a 3CC-Chilled Camera (Sony). cRNAs encoding xCAP1, xENaC, and rENaCFLAG subunits; β2-adrenergic receptor (cDNAs kindly provided by B. C. Rossier; Lausanne, Switzerland), CFTR, prostasin, and TMPRSS2 were synthesized using SP6 or T7 RNA polymerase, analyzed for integrity with gel electrophoresis, and quantitated by spectrophotometry. Healthy stage V-VI oocytes were harvested fromXenopus laevis (Xenopus-1; Dexter, Michigan), defolliculated in collagenase type IA (1 mg/ml; Sigma) in calcium-free modified Barth's solution, and maintained at 18 °C in modified Barth's solution (85 mm NaCl, 1 mm KCl, 2.4 mm NaHCO3, 0.8 mmMgSO4, 0.4 mm CaCl2, 10 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.2), 10 mg/liter penicillin, and 5 mg/liter streptomycin). Twenty-four hours after collagenase treatment, oocytes were injected with 100 nl of the designated cRNA solution. To test the effects of prostasin and TMRPSS2 on ENaC, a solution containing equal amounts of αβγ ENaC subunits (0.1–0.3 ng/subunit/oocyte) and 0.75–2 ng/oocyte of the designated serine protease cRNA was injected. To test the effect of TMPRSS2 on CFTR, oocytes were injected with 10 ng of CFTR cRNA, 1 ng of β2-adrenergic receptor cRNA, and 2 ng of TMPRSS2 cRNA. Two-electrode voltage clamp experiments were performed 18–24 h after the injection of cRNAs. Injected oocytes were perfused in frog Ringer solution (containing 120 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm KCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.2), and currents were measured at a holding potential of −100 mV. The difference in current measured in the presence and absence of amiloride (10 μm) defined ENaC currents. Substitution of NaCl with 120 mm LiCl or KCl allowed the determination of ion selectivity through ENaC in oocytes expressing ENaC with or without prostasin. The effect of aprotinin (100 μg/ml) or protease inihibitor mixture (containing 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride (100 μm), pepstatin A (1.5 μm),trans-epoxysuccinyl-l-leucylamido(4-guanidino)butane (1.4 μm), bestatin (4 μm), leupeptin (2.2 μm), and aprotinin (80 nm)) on protease-mediated ENaC regulation were tested by adding these reagents either immediately after cRNA injection or 5 h before voltage clamping oocytes. CFTR currents were measured in response to the addition of isoproterenol (1 μm) to oocytes expressing both CFTR and the β2-adrenergic receptor. Western blot analysis was used to examine prostasin protein expression in primary cultured airway epithelia and to test for the expression of cRNAs injected in oocytes. Epithelial cell proteins were harvested from 12-mm T-col inserts into 400 μl of radioimmune precipitation buffer (containing 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-Cl, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.5% Triton X-100, 1% SDS, 20 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml pepstatin A) using a cell scraper and transferred to Eppendorf tubes. After briefly vortexing, cells were incubated on ice for 30 min and then centrifuged for 5 min at 14,000 ×g to removed insoluble material. Soluble cell supernatant was collected and electrophoresed as described below. Protein extracted from oocytes was isolated by serial passage through 22- and 27-gauge needles in homogenization buffer (containing 77 mm NaCl, 10 mm Hepes, 1 mmMgCl2, pH 7.9, 20 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml pepstatin A) on ice. Centrifugation at 1000 × g (4 °C) for 5 min separated yolk and pigment granules from the remainder of the cell lysate. Further centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 20 min (4 °C) pelleted a microsomal fraction. Protein concentrations were measured using the Bradford method (Bio-Rad), and 25–50 μg of cell lysate or microsomal fraction was dissolved in sample buffer and heated to 70 °C for 10 min prior to loading onto a 4–15% gradient acrylamide gel. After SDS-PAGE, proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk, and incubated with primary antibody (either m2-FLAG (1:1000; Sigma), a polyclonal antibody raised against the amino terminus of α-rENaC (αN, 1:300; kindly provided by D. Rotin), or a polyclonal antibody raised against prostasin) for 1 h at room temperature. Exposure to secondary antibody (anti-mouse or -rabbit conjugated to horseradish peroxidase, 1:5000–10,000; Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) for 1 h at room temperature followed by detection with ECL reagents (Amersham Biosciences) was used to reveal immunoreactive proteins. Human nasal epithelial cells harvested from surgical tissue specimens were seeded at a density of 0.25 × 106/cm2 on porous Snapwell™-permeable supports (1.13-cm2 surface area; Costar) coated with human placental collagen (50 μg/cm2; Sigma type VI) as previously described (19Matsui H. Randell S.H. Peretti S.W. Davis C.W. Boucher R.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 102: 1125-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Cell monolayers were grown at an air-liquid interface in F-12/Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (1:1) with 2% Ultraser-G. Cells were maintained in a humidified, 5% CO2, 37 °C incubator, and the culture medium was changed every other day. Transepithelial resistance (R t) and potential difference were monitored daily, and cultures were used after ≥7 days of air-liquid interface culture conditions. Primary nasal epithelial air-liquid interface cultures exhibitingR t > 150 Ω·cm2 were mounted in modified Ussing chambers (Physiologic Instruments). The epithelium was bathed on both sides with warmed (37 °C) Krebs-bicarbonate Ringer solution (containing 140 mm Na+, 120 mm Cl−, 5.2 mm K+, 1.2 mm Ca2+, 1.2 mm Mg2+, 2.4 mm HPO42+, 0.4 mm H2PO4−, 25 mm HCO3−, and 5 mm glucose), circulated by gas lift with 95% O2, 5% CO2. The epithelial culture was voltage-clamped (Physiological Instruments), and the short circuit current (I sc) was measured and continuously recorded (Acquire version 1.0; Dataq Instruments). After establishing a stable I sc, aprotinin (20 μg/ml, ∼5 trypsin inhibitory units/mg; Sigma) was added to the apical bath. After a 75-min incubation, a brief exposure to amiloride (100 μm; Sigma) was used to measure the ENaC-mediated current. A 3-fold excess of trypsin (200 μg/ml, ∼10,000N-benzoyl-l-arginine ethyl ester units/mg; Sigma) on the basis of activity (1 trypsin unit = 9000N-benzoyl-l-arginine ethyl ester units) was then added, followed by a second exposure to amiloride. Results are expressed as the means ± S.E. Amiloride-sensitive currents in oocytes coexpressing ENaC with serine proteases were normalized to currents measured in ENaC-expressing oocytes studied from the same animal on the same day. Significance was determined using an unpaired Student's t test or analysis of variance for the comparison of multiple sample groups. Expressed genes with sequence homology to xCAP1 were identified by RT-PCR of airway epithelial RNA and by screening an airway cDNA expression library. Using degenerate primers based upon the xCAP1 amino acid sequence, RT-PCR generated a ∼600-bp product that was sequenced and found to be identical to a portion of the human prostasin gene open reading frame. This PCR product and the full-length prostasin and xCAP1 cDNA sequences were then used to screen an airway epithelial expression library under low stringency conditions in an attempt to identify other sequences with significant homology. Using this approach, only one other homologous clone was identified. This clone was sequenced and found to be identical to another previously cloned serine protease, TMPRSS2. Full-length prostasin and TMPRSS2 clones were then generated by PCR using the TA cloning kit (Invitrogen), and sequences were verified by chain termination automated sequencing. Search of the GenBankTM data bases revealed that prostasin is the nearest human homologue to xCAP1 and mCAP1 (41 and 76% amino acid identity, respectively). TMPRSS2, on the other hand, is significantly less homologous to the mouse and Xenopus CAP1 sequences, having only about ∼16% identity (Fig. 1). To evaluate the pattern of prostasin and TMPRSS2 expression in the lung, we performed in situ hybridization on tissue specimens obtained from the nose, upper airway, and distal lung (Figs.2 and 3). In these studies, we found strong expression of both prostasin and TMPRSS2 in superficial epithelial cells lining the nose, trachea, and distal airways. Although difficult to assess because of the fine structural architecture, both prostasin and TMPRSS2 appeared to be expressed at the alveolar level, most notably at alveolar junctions in a “cornering pattern” characteristic of type II pneumocytes. In addition to robust surface epithelial expression, message encoding prostasin and TMPRSS2 was also pronounced in submucosal glands associated with nasal, tracheal, and bronchial tissues. Importantly, neither serine protease was observed in nonepithelial tissues.Figure 3In situ hybridization of TMPRSS2 in nasal, tracheal, and distal lung tissues. The bright field image (H&E) of each frozen section (left) and dark-field images of sections exposed to antisense (center) and sense (right) mRNA probes are shown.

Current measured via two-electrode voltage clamping 24 h after cRNA injection in the presence and absence of amiloride defined ENaC-mediated currents. Importantly, amiloride-sensitive currents were not observed in control oocytes injected only with water, prostasin, or TMPRSS2 (data not shown). Coexpression of prostasin cRNA with either Xenopus or rat ENaC cRNA, however, led to an ∼80% increase in rENaC-mediated currents (p < 0.005; n ≥ 73 oocytes/group from 10 frogs) and a ∼60% increase in xENaC-mediated currents (p = 0.02; n ≥ 28 oocytes/group from three frogs) (Fig.4 A). We also measured the ability of xCAP1 to activate ENaC in parallel groups of oocytes and observed a similar magnitude of channel activation in xENaC-expressing oocytes (p = NS; n = 24 oocytes from three frogs) (Fig. 4 A). Interestingly, xCAP1 caused a significantly greater activation of amiloride-sensitive currents in rENaC-expressing oocytes than did prostasin (p < 0.01;n = 46 oocytes from seven frogs) (Fig. 4 A). We confirmed that the activation of ENaC by prostasin required extracellular serine protease activity by incubating oocytes in aprotinin (100 μg/ml) for 5 h prior to measurement of amiloride-sensitive currents. This maneuver completely prevented ENaC activation by prostasin (p < 0.001; n≥ 7 oocytes/group) (Fig. 4 B). Aprotinin treatment also reduced ENaC currents in oocytes expressing ENaC alone (p < 0.005; n ≥ 7 oocytes/group)(Fig.4 B), suggesting that an endogenous protease with the ability to activate ENaC may also be expressed in oocytes. The addition of trypsin (200 μg/ml) after aprotinin treatment increased ENaC currents ∼5-fold within 3 min in both groups (p < 0.001;n ≥ 7 oocytes/group) (Fig. 4 B), demonstrating that ENaC channels remained sensitive to protease activation after aprotinin treatment. We tested whether coexpression of prostasin with rENaC changed the electrophysical properties of the channel by determining the amiloride-sensitive current carried by Na+, Li+, or K+ in the presence and absence of prostasin. No significant amiloride-sensitive current was measured at −100 mV when K+ was the only monovalent cation in the extracellular bath either in the presence or absence of prostasin. In agreement with data from native tissues, Li+ was conducted to a greater extent than Na+ in both groups of oocytes. However, we observed a trend toward a lower Li+/Na+ conductivity ratio in oocytes coexpressing prostasin with ENaC (1.39 ± 0.02 versus1.60 ± 0.10; p = 0.13, n = 5 per group). In contrast to prostasin, coexpression of TMPRSS2 with ENaC led to a marked reduction in amiloride-sensitive currents (Fig.5 A). The effect was directly proportional to the amount of TMPRSS2 cRNA that was injected in each oocyte, and obliteration of ENaC currents was achieved with relatively small amounts of injected TMPRSS2 cRNA (>2 ng/oocyte) (Fig.5 B). To test whether this affect was due to a generalized inhibition of protein translation, TMPRSS2 was coexpressed with CFTR and the β2-adrenergic receptor (Fig. 5 C). In these experiments, CFTR currents stimulated by isoproterenol were not significantly reduced compared with CFTR currents measured in the absence of TMPRSS2. Reduced ENaC currents may also be the result of a specific effect on ENaC protein levels. We prepared yolk-depleted lysates and microsomal fractions from oocytes expressing rENaC with or without TMPRSS2 and measured ENaC protein expression by Western blot analysis. In these experiments, expression of TMPRSS2 resulted in a virtually complete loss of ENaC protein (Fig. 5 D). In contrast to the observations with prostasin, the inhibition of ENaC currents by TMPRSS2 was not prevented by the addition of aprotinin (200 μg/ml) or a mixture of protease inhibitors added to the oocyte bathing media immediately after cRNA injection (data not shown), suggesting that channel inactivation/degradation did not occur after ENaC and TMPRSS2 had reached the plasma membrane. Well differentiated primary nasal airway epithelial cultures were mounted in modified Ussing chambers to examine ENaC regulation by endogenous serine proteases (Fig. 6, Aand B). The addition of aprotinin (10 μm) to the apical bath resulted in a marked inhibition of theI sc over 75 min, compared with vehicle controls (p = 0.01). The subsequent addition of trypsin led to a rapid increase in I sc in tissues that had been pretreated with aprotinin (p < 0.001). Importantly, nearly the entire I sc was amiloride-sensitive. These data suggest that endogenous serine proteases had an activating influence on ENaC in primary cultured cells. We therefore determined whether prostasin and TMPRSS2 mRNAs were expressed in this cell culture system using RT-PCR (Fig. 6 C). As shown, both serine proteases were expressed in identical tissues to those used for Ussing chamber experiments. Prostasin protein was also readily detected in primary culture airway epithelia (Fig. 6 D), although antibodies raised against TMPRSS2 proved not to be useful due to poor specificity. The regulation of ENaC activity is tightly linked to ASL volume and mucociliary clearance and therefore is a key determinant of lung health. ENaC regulation appears to be tissue-specific, and in the lung it may rely upon regulators of ENaC that are responsive to local stimuli. The discovery of an extracellular serine protease that is expressed on the lumen of Xenopus (16Vallet V. Chraibi A. Gaeggeller H.P. Horisberger J.D. Rossier B.C. Nature. 1997; 389: 607-6"
https://openalex.org/W2119931165,"We have recently described a large (20 S) protein arginine methyltransferase complex, termed the methylosome, that contains the methyltransferase JBP1 (PRMT5) and the pICln protein. The methylosome functions to modify specific arginines to dimethylarginines in the arginine- and glycine-rich domains of several spliceosomal Sm proteins, and this modification targets these proteins to the survival of motor neurons (SMN) complex for assembly into small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) core particles. Here, we describe a novel component of the methylosome, a 50-kilodalton WD repeat protein termedmethylosome protein 50 (MEP50). We show that MEP50 is important for methylosome activity and binds to JBP1 and to a subset of Sm proteins. Because WD repeat proteins provide a platform for multiple protein interactions, MEP50 may function to mediate the interaction of multiple substrates with the methylosome. Interestingly, all of the known components of the methylosome bind Sm proteins, suggesting that in addition to producing properly methylated substrates for the SMN complex, the methylosome may be involved in Sm protein rearrangements or pre-assembly required for snRNP biogenesis.

We have recently shown that JBP1 is present in and functions in the context of the methylosome, a large 20 S complex that also contains the pICln protein (14Friesen W.J. Paushkin S. Wyce A.

PICln was initially thought to be an ion channel regulator (38Santoro B. Liu D.T. Yao H. Bartsch D. Kandel E.R. Siegelbaum S.A. Tibbs G.R.

A fraction of the cytoplasmic RG domain-containing Sm proteins are bound to the methylosome in vivo. JBP1 binds Sm protein RG domains, whereas pICln binds the Sm domain (14Friesen W.J. Paushkin S.

PICln is a phosphoprotein (40Sanchez-Olea R. Emma F. Coghlan M. Strange K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1381: 49-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) and is found also in smaller complexes (4–6 S), at least some of which also contain Sm proteins, suggesting that pICln may regulate Sm protein association with the methylosome (14Friesen W.J.

After sDMA modification by the methylosome, Sm proteins become high affinity substrates for the SMN complex, which likely completes their assembly into snRNPs cores (13Friesen W.J. Massenet S.

Here, we describe a novel 50-kilodalton protein component of the methylosome termed MEP50. We show that MEP50, a novel WD repeat protein, binds to JBP1 and Sm proteins and is required for methylosome activity. WD repeat proteins provide a large surface area for multiple protein interactions, suggesting that MEP50 functions to mediate the interaction of protein substrates with the methylosome. An expressed sequence tag (GenBankTM accession numberAL533305) was obtained from Invitrogen (clone Id: CS0DN003YE12) and found to contain an open reading frame (with multiple in-frame stop codons upstream and downstream), which, upon conceptual translation, contained amino acid sequences that exactly matched all of the peptide sequences obtained by nanoelectrospray tandem mass spectrometry (nano-ES MS/MS) (41Wilm M. Shevchenko A. Houthaeve T. Breit S. Schweigerer L. Fotsis T. Mann M. Nature. 1996; 379: 466-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (1507) Google Scholar). This open reading frame was PCR amplified and cloned into pGV67 (14Friesen W.J. Paushkin S. Wyce A. Massenet S. Pesiridis G.S. Van Duyne G. Rappsilber J. Mann M. Dreyfuss G. Mol. Cell.

Similarly, constructs for the expression of the GST-MEP50 N terminus (amino acids 1–75) and GST-MEP50 WD domain (amino acids 76–342) were made by inserting the appropriate MEP50 cDNA fragments into pGEX6p2 (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). All Sm protein constructs used for in vitro protein production have been previously described (26Friesen W.J. Dreyfuss G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26370-26375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The pICln cDNA was PCR amplified and subcloned into pET28a(+) (Novagen) for in vitro protein production, and into pGEX5x (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) for GST-pICln fusion protein production. JBP1 cDNA (35Gilbreth M. Yang P. Bartholomeusz G. Pimental R.A. Kansra S. Gadiraju R. Marcus S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The recombinant proteins GST-D3 and His-SmB were produced as described previously (14Friesen W.J. Paushkin S. Wyce A. Massenet S. Pesiridis G.S. Van Duyne G. Rappsilber J. Mann M. Dreyfuss G. Mol.

Anti-JBP1 antibody 6G8 was prepared by immunizing Balb/C mice with a C-terminal domain of JBP1 (amino acid 284–637) purified from pGV67 on glutathione-Sepharose and cleaved off the beads with TEV (tobacco etch virus) protease (Invitrogen). Hybridoma production, screening, and ascites fluid production were performed as described previously (43Choi Y.D. Dreyfuss G. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 99: 1997-2004Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Polysera against MEP50 were obtained by immunizing Balb/C mice with MEP50 protein purified from pGV67MEP50 on glutathione-Sepharose and cleaved off the beads with TEV protease. In vitro translated [35S]methionine-labeled proteins (8 μl) were incubated with glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) immobilized GST fusion proteins (2–3 μg) in 1 ml of binding buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 2 mmdithiothreitol, and 1 tablet/50 ml of Complete EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals)) for 1–2 h at 4 °C. Following five washes with 1 ml of binding buffer, bound proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and detected by fluorography. GST fusion proteins were purified on glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's recommendation. HeLa cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Cytoplasmic extract was prepared as described previously (44Siomi M.C. Eder P.S. Kataoka N. Wan L. Liu Q. Dreyfuss G. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 1181-1192Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Sucrose gradient centrifugation, fraction collection, and immunoprecipitation were done as described previously (14Friesen W.J. Paushkin S. Wyce A. Massenet S. Pesiridis G.S. Van Duyne G. Rappsilber J. Mann M. Dreyfuss G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 8289-8300Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Antibodies used in these experiments were anti-pICln (Transduction Laboratories), anti-Myc (9E10), anti-JBP1 (6G8), and anti-MEP50 polysera. The methylosome was prepared and used to methylate recombinant Sm protein substrates as described previously (14Friesen W.J. Paushkin S. Wyce A. Massenet S. Pesiridis G.S. Van Duyne G. Rappsilber J. Mann M. Dreyfuss G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 8289-8300Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Approximately 100 ng of purified methylosome (4 μl) was incubated with 2 μl of adenosyl-l-[methyl-3H]methionine (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.), 3 μl (600 ng) of recombinant GST-SmD3 or His-tagged SmB (His-SmB), and 21 μl of phosphate-buffered saline at 30 °C for 45 min. Reactions were supplemented with 5 μl of anti-MEP50 serum, 5 μl of normal mouse serum (NMS), or 5 μl of anti-MEP50 serum that had been pre-incubated with 1.5 μg of immobilized GST-MEP50 or 5 μl of anti-MEP50 serum that had been pre-incubated with 1.5 μg of immobilized GST. After methylation, the mixtures were boiled in SDS sample buffer and resolved by SDS-PAGE. The gels were then treated with Amplify (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.), dried, and exposed to film. The MEP50 GenBankTM accession number is AF478464. We have recently shown that the methylosome, which contains the methyltransferase JBP1 and the pICln protein, functions in the cytoplasm to symmetrically dimethylate specific arginines in the RG domains of the Sm proteins. To further study this complex, we produced monoclonal antibodies against JBP1. Mice were immunized with a recombinant protein fragment of JBP1 (amino acid 284–637), and a hybridoma, 6G8, was selected for further analysis (43Choi Y.D. Dreyfuss G. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 99: 1997-2004Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). To characterize 6G8, in vitro produced and radiolabeled flag-tagged JBP1 (flag-JBP1) was incubated with immobilized 6G8 ascites fluid, nonimmune ascites fluid (SP2/0), and NMS. Immunoprecipitated JBP1 was resolved on SDS-PAGE and visualized by fluorography. The 6G8 monoclonal antibody specifically immunoprecipitated JBP1 (Fig.1 A). Western blot of HeLa extract revealed that 6G8, but not NMS, detected a protein of about 70 kilodaltons, the expected size of JBP1 (Fig. 1 B). Thus, 6G8 is a monoclonal antibody that specifically recognizes JBP1. To identify and isolate components of the methylosome, we performed preparative immunoprecipitations from HeLa cytoplasmic extract with anti-JBP1 (6G8) and anti-pICln antibodies (α-pICln). After extensive washing, the immunoprecipitates were resolved by SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie Blue (Fig. 2 A). Both anti-JBP1 and anti-pICln antibodies immunoprecipitated JBP1 and pICln as well as a protein of about 50 kilodaltons (MEP50). This 50-kilodalton band was excised from the gel, and five peptide sequences, which did not match any known proteins, were obtained by nano-ES MS/MS (41Wilm M. Shevchenko A. Houthaeve T. Breit S. Schweigerer L. Fotsis T. Mann M. Nature. 1996; 379: 466-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (1507) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2 B). An expressed sequence tag (GenBankTM accession number AL533305) was found to contain an open reading frame (with several stop codons upstream and downstream) that matched all of the peptide sequences (Fig.2 B). Although MEP50 encodes a polypeptide of about 36.7 kilodaltons, it migrated above the 45-kilodalton molecular mass marker by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2 A and see below). This is similar to pICln, a protein of about 26.2 kilodaltons that migrates near the 45-kilodalton molecular mass marker. This discrepancy may be due, at least in part, to the fact that pICln and MEP50 are both acidic proteins with a pI of 3.77 and 4.84, respectively. Sequence analysis on the Protein Sequence Analysis server (bmerc-www.bu.edu/psa/) revealed that MEP50 contains six WD repeats (Fig. 2 B) (45Smith T.F. Gaitatzes C. Saxena K. Neer E.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 181-185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1022) Google Scholar, 46Wall M.A. Coleman D.E. Lee E. Iniguez-Lluhi J.A. Posner B.A. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Cell. 1995; 83: 1047-1058Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1018) Google Scholar). To further investigate MEP50 as a potential methylosome component, mice were immunized with the MEP50 protein. Using sera from these mice we detected recombinant MEP50 (data not shown) and MEP50 from HeLa cell extract by Western blotting (Fig.3 A). To confirm the association of MEP50 with the methylosome, HeLa cell cytoplasmic extract was prepared and sedimented on a sucrose gradient. Fractions were collected and resolved by SDS-PAGE, and Western blotting was carried out to detect JBP1, pICln, and MEP50. MEP50 sedimented in the same fractions as the methylosome (fractions 12–15) (Fig.3 A). Fractions 12–15 containing the methylosome (20 S) were pooled and immunoprecipitated with anti-JBP1 (6G8) antibodies or with nonimmune SP2/0 antibodies. After extensive washing the immunoprecipitates were resolved by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted to detect JBP1, pICln, and MEP50 (Fig. 3 B). JBP1, pICln, and MEP50 were detected in anti-JBP1 antibody immunoprecipitate from the 20 S fractions, demonstrating that MEP50 is indeed a novel component of the methylosome. Transiently expressed Myc-tagged MEP50 also associates with the methylosome (data not shown) further confirming that MEP50 is a methylosome component. We further studied the interactions among the components of the methylosome. In vitro produced and radiolabeled JBP1, pICln, and MEP50 were each incubated with immobilized GST fused to JBP1 (GST-JBP1), pICln (GST-pICln), and MEP50 (GST-MEP50) or, as a control, with GST alone. After extensive washing, bound proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and visualized by fluorography (Fig.4). Under our binding conditions, pICln and MEP50 bound JBP1 but did not homo- or hetero-oligomerize. In contrast and as described previously (14Friesen W.J. Paushkin S. Wyce A. Massenet S. Pesiridis G.S. Van Duyne G. Rappsilber J. Mann M. Dreyfuss G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 8289-8300Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar, 47Rho J. Choi S. Seong Y.R. Cho W.K. Kim S.H. Im D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11393-11401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), JBP1 did homo-oligomerize. These results further confirm that MEP50 is abona fide component of the methylosome and suggest that oligomerization of JBP1 contributes to the large size of the methylosome. To test whether MEP50 binds to Sm proteins, the best characterized substrates of the methylosome, in vitro produced and radiolabeled SmB, SmD1, SmD2, SmD3, SmE, SmF, and SmG, were each incubated with GST-MEP50, GST-MEP50 WD repeat domain (GST fused to the WD repeat domain of MEP50-(76–342), or GST-MEP50 N terminus (GST fused to MEP50-(1–75)) or, as a control, with GST alone (data not shown). After extensive washing, bound proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and visualized by fluorography (Fig.5). GST-MEP50 and GST-MEP50 WD domain bound most avidly to SmB and SmD2 but also had detectable affinity for SmD3 and SmE. The GST-MEP50 N terminus bound significantly less of these Sm proteins. There was no detectable binding of any of the Sm proteins to GST alone under these binding conditions (data not shown and Refs. 26Friesen W.J. Dreyfuss G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26370-26375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar and 27Pellizzoni L. Charroux B. Dreyfuss G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11167-11172Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Although it is very unlikely, we cannot rule out the possibility that these interactions may be mediated by components of the reticulocyte lysate. These findings indicate that MEP50 binds to several of the Sm proteins and that these interactions are mediated by the WD repeat domain. We next wished to determine whether MEP50 plays a role in methylosome activity. To this end, methylosomes were purified from cells transiently expressing flag-JBP1 as described previously (14Friesen W.J. Paushkin S. Wyce A. Massenet S. Pesiridis G.S. Van Duyne G. Rappsilber J. Mann M. Dreyfuss G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 8289-8300Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar) and used to methylate the recombinant Sm protein substrates His-SmB and GST-SmD3 (Fig. 6). Anti-MEP50 antibodies were then used to verify whether they altered the activity of the methylosome, and NMS was used as a negative control. Anti-MEP50, but not NMS, significantly reduced methylosome activity toward the Sm protein substrates. Importantly, the removal of the anti-MEP50 antibodies from the serum by pre-binding it to immobilized GST-MEP50 abolished the inhibitory effect. In contrast, pre-binding of anti-MEP50 serum with immobilized GST did not significantly reduce the inhibitory effect of the anti-MEP50 antibodies. These results strongly suggest that MEP50 is important for the methyltransferase activity of the methylosome. The SMN complex mediates the assembly of spliceosomal snRNPs and other RNPs (10Fischer U.

Chem. 2001; 276: 38645-38651Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). To carry out these functions, the SMN complex needs to bring together the components of these RNPs and facilitate the proper rearrangements of the individual components. To this end, SMN binds specifically and avidly to RG domains in several of the key protein components of RNPs (26Friesen W.J. Dreyfuss G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26370-26375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 48Pellizzoni L. Charroux B. Rappsilber J. Mann M. Dreyfuss G. J.

Chem. 2001; 276: 38645-38651Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). We have recently shown that this interaction depends on a post-translational modification of specific arginines in the RG domains of its cognate proteins (13Friesen W.J. Massenet S. Paushkin S. Wyce A. Dreyfuss G. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 1111-1117Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). For the best characterized protein substrates of the SMN complex, the spliceosomal snRNP Sm proteins, this modification is carried out by a large macromolecular complex termed the methylosome (14Friesen W.J. Paushkin S. Wyce A. Massenet S. Pesiridis G.S. Van Duyne G. Rappsilber J. Mann M. Dreyfuss G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 8289-8300Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). The methylosome contains an arginine protein methyltransferase, JBP1, which converts specific arginines in the RG domains of SmD1 and SmD3 to sDMA, thereby targeting them to the SMN complex for assembly into snRNPs (13Friesen W.J. Massenet S. Paushkin S. Wyce A. Dreyfuss G. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 1111-1117Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar,14Friesen W.J. Paushkin S. Wyce A. Massenet S. Pesiridis G.S. Van Duyne G. Rappsilber J. Mann M. Dreyfuss G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 8289-8300Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). This finding suggested a key role for the methylosome in the process of snRNP assembly, and we therefore wished to characterize the composition and activity of the methylosome in further detail. Here, using co-immunoprecipitation with a monoclonal antibody (6G8) against JBP1, we have identified MEP50, a novel WD repeat protein, as an additional component of the methylosome. We further show that MEP50 binds Sm proteins and is important for methylosome activity. The current inventory of the components of the methylosome thus indicates that it is composed of JBP1, pICln, and MEP50. Because 6G8, the anti-JBP1 antibody, co-immunoprecipitated only three major proteins (JBP1, pICln, and MEP50) as detected by Coomassie Blue staining, it is likely that all of the major, stably associated methylosome components have thus been identified. It is interesting to note that although this complex is apparently composed of only three proteins it is nevertheless very large. JBP1, but not MEP50 or pICln, readily oligomerizes in vitro (Fig. 4), and therefore it is likely that JBP1 contributes significantly to the size of this complex. Indeed, JBP1 forms intermolecular disulfide linkages, suggesting an ordered and regulated oligomerization (47Rho J. Choi S. Seong Y.R. Cho W.K. Kim S.H. Im D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11393-11401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). JBP1 oligomerization may be required for its enzymatic activity. Oligomerization may also allow JBP1 to simultaneously methylate multiple substrates while maintaining them in a specific spatial arrangement and perhaps also to contribute to their arrangement into complexes. Importantly, all of the methylosome components interact with Sm proteins. This is reminiscent of the SMN complex in which SMN, Gemin3, and Gemin4 all bind several of the Sm proteins (9Liu Q. Fischer U. Wang F. Dreyfuss G. Cell. 1997; 90: 1013-1021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar, 15Charroux B. Pellizzoni L. Perkinson R.A. Shevchenko A. Mann M.

Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 1177-1186Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). It is possible that just as the SMN complex functions to facilitate the assembly of the Sm proteins into snRNP cores (10Fischer U. Liu Q. Dreyfuss G. Cell. 1997; 90: 1023-1029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar, 11Buhler D. Raker V. Luhrmann R. Fischer U. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1999; 8: 2351-2357Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 12Pellizzoni L. Kataoka N. Charroux B. Dreyfuss G. Cell. 1998; 95: 615-624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar), the methylosome as well as producing methylated Sm proteins may also spatially arrange Sm proteins for their efficient assembly into snRNP cores by the SMN complex. In this context, it is particularly interesting that MEP50 interacts with SmD2, a protein that is not a substrate of methylation by the methylosome (data not shown and in Ref. 51Brahms H. Raymackers J. Union A. de Keyser F. Meheus L. Luhrmann R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17122-17129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar); this suggests the possibility of a more general role for the methylosome in snRNP assembly. The interaction of all of the methylosome components with Sm proteins may also be important for the ordered and complete methylation of the many arginines that need to be modified in each RG domain of substrate proteins. In a larger perspective, it is interesting that the critical process of snRNP assembly appears to require the activities of at least two large multiprotein complexes that function sequentially, the methylosome and the SMN complex. We show that anti-MEP50 antibodies specifically inhibit methylosome activity toward Sm protein substrates. Thus, MEP50 appears to modulate methylosome activity. MEP50 may be important for binding Sm protein substrates and properly positioning them for methylation by JBP1. It is also possible that the presence of MEP50 bound to JBP1 is important for the activity of the enzyme itself. Whichever is the case, it is clear that MEP50 is important for the function of the methylosome to specifically produce Sm proteins with the correct sDMA modification. WD repeat-containing proteins are unique in that they are functionally diverse while having a common sequence motif, which very likely forms a common structure (45Smith T.F. Gaitatzes C. Saxena K. Neer E.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 181-185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1022) Google Scholar, 52Garcia-Higuera I. Fenoglio J. Li Y. Lewis C. Panchenko M.P. Reiner O.

The structure of a WD repeat protein (the Gβ subunit of heterotrimeric G-proteins) revealed that this class of proteins forms a β-propeller structure, which apparently creates a stable platform allowing simultaneous interaction with multiple proteins (46Wall M.A. Coleman D.E.

If MEP50 is also able to interact with multiple proteins, it can be expected that it is important for targeting the Sm proteins, as well as other yet unknown proteins, to the methylosome for symmetrical dimethylation. Only three proteins are known so far to contain sDMA, SmD1, SmD3 (51Brahms H. Raymackers J. Union A. de Keyser F. Meheus L. Luhrmann R. J. Biol.

The use of in vitro preparations revealed that detectable levels of A2-PE, the A2E precursor, are formed within photoreceptor outer segments following light-induced release of endogenous all-trans-retinal. Moreover, experiments in vivo demonstrated that the formation of A2-PE in photoreceptor outer segment membrane was augmented by exposing rats to bright light. Whereas the generation of A2E from A2-PE by acid hydrolysis was found to occur very slowly, the detection in outer segments of a phosphodiesterase activity that can convert A2-PE to A2E may indicate that some portion of the A2-PE that forms in the outer segment membrane may undergo hydrolytic cleavage before internalization by the retinal pigment epithelial cell.

This adduct undergoes a [1,6]-proton tautomerization generating a phosphatidylethanolamine-retinyl enamine, which reacts with a second molecule of all-trans-retinal. After aza-6π-electrocyclization and auto-oxidation, the fluorescent phosphatidyl-pyridinium bisretinoid A2-PE is formed. A2-PE was established as the precursor of A2E by HPLC detection of A2E after enzyme-mediated hydrolysis of A2-PE, whereas the structure of A2-PE was confirmed by collision-induced dissociation mass spectrometric analysis (FAB collision-induced dissociation mass spectrometry/MS). The A2-PE that forms in the outer segments leads to the deposition of A2E in RPE cells because of the latter cell's role in phagocytosing the outer segment membrane that is discarded daily by the photoreceptor cell. The tendency for A2E to undergo photoisomerization was illustrated by the identification of iso-A2E, a Z-isomer, at the C13-C14 double bond of one of the hydrophobic retinal chains. In the HPLC profile of human RPE extracted in the dark, iso-A2E is a pigment that is slightly less polar than A2E. Using synthetic samples,iso-A2E has been shown to exist in photoequilibrium with A2E at a ratio of ∼4:1, A2E:iso-A2E. It was clear from the early work of Katz et al. (16Katz M.L. Drea C.M. Robison W.G., Jr. Mech. Ageing Dev. 1986; 35: 291-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 17Katz M.L. Norberg M. Stientjes H.J. Invest. Ophthalmol. Visual Sci. 1992; 33: 2612-2618PubMed Google Scholar), which demonstrated that rats fed a diet lacking in retinoid precursors of 11-cis-retinal exhibited significantly reduced levels of RPE lipofuscin despite normal numbers of photoreceptor cells, that the constituents of RPE lipofuscin are predominantly vitamin A aldehyde-conjugate. Because the all-trans-retinal that is released from photoactivated rhodopsin and cone pigment is reduced to all-trans-retinol by an NADPH-dependent retinol dehydrogenase located in the photoreceptor outer segment, it is generally assumed that only all-trans-retinal that has avoided reduction is available to react with phosphatidylethanolamine. Correspondingly, conditions that allow the generation of all-trans-retinal to surpass its reduction by retinol dehydrogenase can lead to accelerated formation of A2-PE and an enhanced accumulation of A2E. In vivo, A2-PE has been identified as the orange-colored fluorophore that accumulates in the photoreceptor outer segment debris of Royal College of Surgeon rats (15Liu J. Itagaki Y. Ben-Shabat S. Nakanishi K. Sparrow J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29354-29360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Significant amounts of A2-PE were also detected in outer segments isolated from mice with a knockout mutation in the gene encoding for the photoreceptor-specific ATP-binding cassette RIM transporter (18Mata N.L. Weng J. Travis G.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7154-7159Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). The latter protein, a member of the superfamily of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) proteins, is causative for Stargardt's disease, recessive cone-rod dystrophy, recessive retinitis pigmentosa, and some cases of atrophic age-related macular degeneration (19Allikmets R.

It is postulated that the photoreceptor-specific ATP-binding cassette transporter makes all-trans-retinal available to all-trans-retinol dehydrogenase on the cytoplasmic side of the disc membrane (25Weng J.

As a consequence of the loss of photoreceptor-specific ATP-binding cassette transporter activity and the accumulation of A2-PE in outer segments, the levels of A2E in RPE cells of abcr−/− mice are reported to be 20 times greater than those in normal mice (25Weng J. Mata N.L. Azarian S.M. Tzekov R.T. Birch D.G. Travis G.H. Cell. 1999; 98: 13-23Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (729) Google Scholar). Determining the steps involved in the biosynthesis of A2E, together with the factors that influence its formation, is fundamental to our understanding of blinding retinal disorders associated with abnormal accumulations of A2E in RPE cells. In the present studies, we have examined several issues related to the biosynthesis of A2E including the mechanisms involved in the hydrolysis of A2-PE and the modulation of A2-PE accumulation by bright light exposure. We also report that previously unidentified components of hydrophobic extracts of human RPE are structurally related to A2E and iso-A2E. [14C2]Ethanolamine (5 mCi/mmol) was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Phospholipase D (type IV, Streptomyces chromofofuscus) and dipalmitoyl-l-α-phosphatidylethanolamine, α-tocopherol (vitamin E), calphostin C, and a protease inhibitor mixture (P-2714) were obtained from Sigma; Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, nonessential amino acids, and gentamycin sulfate were obtained from Invitrogen, and fetal bovine serum was acquired from Atlanta Biologicals (Norcross, GA); butylated hydroxytoluene was from Aldrich. All other chemicals were from Sigma. Glass-backed TLC plates (RP-C18) were purchased from Merck. A2E was synthesized by incubating ethanolamine (4.75 mg, 77.5 μmol) and all-trans-retinal (50 mg, 176 μmol) in ethanol (3 ml) at room temperature for 2 days in the dark (4Parish C.A. Hashimoto M. Nakanishi K. Dillon J. Sparrow J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14609-14613Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). A2-PE was prepared by reacting dipalmitoyl l-α-phosphatidylethanolamine (50 mg, 72 μmol) and all-trans-retinal (46 mg, 164 μmol) in chloroform (4 ml) at 37 °C for 3 days in the dark (15Liu J.

A2E and A2-PE were purified by silica gel chromatography, and purity was confirmed by TLC and HPLC. HPLC-purified A2E was exposed to room light for varying time periods to provide mixtures of A2E-related photoisomers. Whole retinas were excised from bovine eyes under dim red light and incubated for 14 h in media consisting of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum, 0.1 mm minimum Eagle's medium nonessential amino acids solution, and gentamycin sulfate (10 μg/ml) and containing [14C2]ethanolamine (1 μCi/ml, 5 mCi/mmol). After rinsing in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, the retinas were either incubated in media containing exogenous all-trans-retinal (50 μm; 4 h) or exposed to white light delivered from a 60-W lamp at a distance of 20 cm for 30 min to release endogenous retinal from bleached rhodopsin, followed by additional incubation in the dark for 3.5 h. Subsequently, ROS were isolated by shaking bovine retinas in 35% (w/v) sucrose in 10 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.0 (2 retinas/30 ml), for ∼1 min to detach the ROS (28Papermaster D.S. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 81: 48-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). After centrifugation at 3500 × gfor 15 min, the supernatant containing the isolated ROS was collected, and the lipids were extracted using chloroform:methanol (2:1, v/v) containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The organic phases were dried under argon, reconstituted in chloroform, and loaded onto glass-backed TLC plates (RP-C18) using the solvent system of methanol:chloroform (75:25) containing 2% trifluoroacetic acid. The samples were developed together with the synthetic compounds as a reference. The bands were scraped from the plate, and the radioactivity was measured by liquid scintillation counting and expressed relative to the quantity of protein measured before extraction. Alternatively, in some experiments, excised whole retinas were incubated in 50 μm all-trans-retinal without prior incorporation in [14C2]ethanolamine; ROS were isolated before bleaching under white light (60-W bulb, 30 min, 20-cm distance), and isolated ROS were exposed to light (300-W lamp, 2 min, 50-cm distance) delivered through a 500 nm band pass filter (29Yamashita T. Terakita A. Shichida Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34272-34279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). In addition, synthetic A2-PE was incubated with isolated ROS in buffer containing 10 mm Hepes, 50 μmol of diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid, 0.1 mmol of toluenensulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mmol of dithiothreitol (pH 6.6) for 3 h at 37 °C in the absence and presence of the putative PLD inhibitor calphostin C (5 μm) (30Sciorra V.A. Hammond S.M. Morris A.J. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 2640-2646Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) or a protease inhibitor mixture containing 6.7 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride, 3.3 mm EDTA, 433 μmbestatin, 47 μm E-64, 3.3 μm leupeptin, and 1 μm aprotinin. To determine the amount of A2E formed, the latter was quantified by reverse phase HPLC, as described below, and for each experiment, the amount of A2E in the starting sample of A2-PE (0.3–1.3%) was subtracted from the amount present after incubation with ROS. RPE-choroid were isolated from human donor eyes (National Disease Research Exchange, Philadelphia, PA; age, 60–70 years), extracted in chloroform:methanol (2:1, v/v) containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (4Parish C.A.

A. 1998; 95: 14609-14613Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar), and analyzed by normal and reverse phase HPLC, as described below. Sprague-Dawley rats (6–7 weeks of age) that had been maintained on a 12-h light/dark cycle were dark-adapted overnight. After pupillary dilation with cyclopentolate hydrochloride (0.5%; Alcon Laboratories, Fort Worth, TX) and tropicamide (1%; Alcon), 48 rats were exposed for 6 h to an illuminance of 350 foot-candles delivered from cool white fluorescent bulbs. A museum-grade plexiglass plate positioned between the light source and the animal cage eliminated UV light. The temperature in the transparent cages was 24 °C. After enucleation, the retinas were dissected into cold 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) containing 20% sucrose, and ROS were isolated, extracted in chloroform:methanol (2:1, v/v) containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, and analyzed by normal phase HPLC, as described below. ROS isolated from 48 age-matched Sprague-Dawley rats maintained under room lighting (<20 foot-candles) were also analyzed. The lipid fraction containing A2-PE was reconstituted in Me2SO and incubated in 40 mm 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid buffer, pH 6.5, containing 250 units/ml S. chromofuscus PLD and 15 mm CaCl2. Incubation was carried out for 2 h at 37 °C in a shaking water bath. Chloroform:methanol (2:1, v/v) terminated the reaction and extracted the products. A Waters 600E HPLC equipped with Waters 996 photodiode array detector was used with a reverse phase C18 column (250 × 4.6 mm; Cosmosil 5C18; Nacalai Tesque, Kyoto, Japan). A2E and the photoisomer iso-A2E were eluted with the following gradients of acetonitrile in water (containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid): 85–96% (10 min), 96% (5 min), 96–100% (2 min), and 100% (13 min) (flow rate, 1 ml/min), and they were monitored at 430 nm. Analysis of pigment mixtures containing minor A2E-related components utilized a gradient of methanol in water containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (linear gradient of 84–96% methanol over 10 min, followed by isocratic elution at 96% methanol for 5 min). Absorbance spectra of minor peaks with retention times similar to A2E in the HPLC profile were obtained by photodiode array detection at the appropriate retention times. Detection of A2-PE was carried out by normal phase HPLC (150 × 4.6 mm; YMC-Pack silica S-5 μm) with elution in a solvent system of hexane:isopropanol:ethanol:25 mmK2PO4 buffer:trifluoroacetic acid (123:95:25:6:0.07, v/v; pH 7.0). For A2E quantitation by reverse phase HPLC, the area of the A2E peak was normalized to the internal standard, A2-propylamine, which was synthesized from all-trans-retinal and propylamine. FAB-MS was performed on a JEOL JMS-HX110A/110A tandem MS (Akishima, Tokyo, Japan) Xe beam FAB gun (6 kV) fitted with an MS-1 ion source. FAB collision-induced dissociation spectra were measured with 10 kV acceleration voltage (MS-1 and MS-2) on an electrically floated collision cell (8 kV). Helium was used as the collision gas with an attenuation of precursor ion intensity to ∼30%. 3-Nitrobenzyl alcohol was used as matrix. HPLC-electrospray ionization-MS was performed on a mixture of A2E photoisomers and on human eye extracts. These samples were separated using a Waters Alliance HPLC Model 2690 with a Cosmosil C18 (250 × 4.6 mm) column (Nacalai Tesque) utilizing a linear gradient from 84–96% methanol in water with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (10 min), followed by isocratic elution at 96% methanol at a flow rate of 0.3 ml/min. The presence of A2E and its isomers was observed using a Q-TOF (Micromass, Manchester, United Kingdom) equipped with a Z-spray electrospray ionization source. Electrospray ionization capillary voltage was set at 3.0 kV, and the source block temperature and desolvation temperature were set at 120 °C and 350 °C, respectively. To determine whether measurable quantities of A2-PE form in photoreceptor outer segments upon light exposure, excised bovine retinas that had incorporated [14C2]ethanolamine were illuminated to induce photoisomerization and release of all-trans-retinal. Accordingly, the formation of [14C2]A2-PE was observed at levels that were significantly elevated as compared with background radioactivity measured from retinas maintained in the dark (Fig. 1). Indeed the levels of [14C2]A2-PE generated by release of endogenous retinal were similar to that measured after incubating [14C2]ethanolamine-labeled retinas with 50 μm exogenous all-trans-retinal. To confirm the identification of A2-PE in these samples, ROS were isolated from excised retina that had been incubated with exogenous all-trans-retinal, and after extraction, the crude TLC fraction that co-migrated with authentic A2-PE (R f 0.24; detection at 365 nm) was analyzed by FAB-MS. The relatively intense signals at m/z 1295 and 1323 corresponded to the molecular ions of C83H124NO8P and C85H128NO8P and thus were assigned to A2-PE (Fig. 2 A). The FAB collision-induced dissociation spectra of the m/z 1323 peak revealed an intense product ion at m/z 673 that corroborated the presence of the phosphoryl-A2E group in A2-PE (Fig. 2 A). The fluorescent band at R F 0.24 also proved to be the precursor of A2E because incubation of this fraction with bacterial PLD resulted in peaks in the HPLC profile that were identified as A2E and iso-A2E on the basis of UV absorbance (λmax 335 and 435) (Fig. 2 B).Figure 2FAB-MS identification of A2-PE in ROS isolated from excised bovine retina after incubation with exogenous all-trans-retinal.

Itagaki Y. Ben-Shabat S. Nakanishi K. Sparrow J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29354-29360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar), suggests that the level of detection afforded by HPLC (UV) is insufficient to monitor what must be a slow accretion of A2-PE in photoreceptor outer segments in vivo. Thus, to determine whether high levels of illumination can lead to the release of all-trans-retinal at levels sufficient to detect A2-PE in outer segment membrane, rats were dark-adapted overnight and then exposed to bright white light for 6 h. Subsequent HPLC analysis of extracts of ROS isolated from the illuminated rats revealed a peak that co-migrated with authentic A2-PE (Fig. 3). Conversely, this peak was not present in ROS isolated from control rats maintained under cyclic lighting conditions. We have demonstrated repeatedly that in the presence of phospholipase D, A2-PE undergoes hydrolytic cleavage to generate A2E (Fig. 2; also see Liu et al., Ref. 15Liu J. Itagaki Y. Ben-Shabat S. Nakanishi K. Sparrow J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29354-29360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, in addition to enzyme-mediated phosphate hydrolysis, it is conceivable that acid hydrolysis of A2-PE could occur. This prospect is especially significant because within RPE cells, A2-PE-containing outer segments could be expected to reside within the acidic environment of phagolysosomes. Thus, to investigate the possibility of acid-mediated hydrolysis of A2-PE, we incubated HPLC-purified A2-PE (0.1 mg) in 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid buffer, pH 5.5–6.0 (37 °C), conditions that mimic the lysosomal compartment. No A2E was detectable after a 24-h period of incubation (Fig.4 A). After 1 week, the amount of A2E generated (Fig. 4 B) was 7–8 ng, as measured by internal standard. This quantity of A2E, generated over the period of a week under acid conditions, represented ∼0.01% of the original sample of A2-PE. In [14C2]ethanolamine-labeled excised retinas that were either bleached or incubated with exogenous retinal, the formation of [14C2]A2E was also observed (Fig. 1). We considered two explanations for this unexpected finding. One possibility was that despite careful washing after [14C2]ethanolamine incubation, much of the observed A2E had formed from reactions between residual free [14C2]ethanolamine and retinal. The alternative prospect was that A2E was generated by A2-PE hydrolysis within the outer segment membrane. Thus, to investigate these scenarios, several approaches were taken. First, by bleaching excised whole retina without prior incubation with [14C2]ethanolamine, we eliminated the possibility of A2E forming through direct reactions between retinal and exogenous free ethanolamine. Even in the absence of [14C2]ethanolamine, however, A2E/iso-A2E peaks appeared in the reverse phase HPLC profile when the retinas were illuminated and then incubated in the dark for an additional 4 h (Fig. 5 A). A2E was similarly detected in extracts of ROS that were isolated and exposed to white light (data not shown) or irradiated through a 500 nm band pass filter, without prior incubation with [14C2]ethanolamine (Fig. 5 B). To further investigate whether a phosphodiesterase activity in photoreceptor outer segments can release A2E from A2-PE, we also incubated synthetic A2-PE with isolated ROS, and by quantitative HPLC analysis (Fig. 6), we observed that A2E was generated from A2-PE. The production of A2E under these conditions was reduced by ∼80% in the presence of a protease inhibitor mixture with PLD inhibitory activity (31Andrews B. Bond K. Lehman J.A. Horn J.M. Dugan A. Gomez-Cambronero G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 273: 302-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) and when calphostin C, an inhibitor of PLD1 and PLD2 (30Sciorra V.A. Hammond S.M.

Although we are able to detect A2E in as little as 5% of the extract obtained from a single human eye (4Parish C.A. Hashimoto M. Nakanishi K. Dillon J. Sparrow J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14609-14613Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar), in RPE-choroid pooled from four human eyes (ranging in age from 60–70 years), A2-PE was undetectable by normal phase HPLC and FAB-MS (data not shown). In all experiments in which we have detected A2E and iso-A2E by reverse phase HPLC, including those samples obtained by A2-PE hydrolysis and ROS-retinal reaction (Figs. 2, 4, and 5), additional smaller peaks were present in the chromatograms. To begin to identify these compounds and their relationship to A2E, a sample of HPLC-purified A2E (Fig.7 A) was exposed to room light for 35 min. Subsequent HPLC analysis disclosed the presence of at least seven products, including A2E and iso-A2E (Fig.7 B), with the profile of peaks in the A2E region of the chromatogram matching the distribution observed in other experiments (cf. Figs. 2, 4, and 5). Whereas A2E (area = 71% at 430 nm) and iso-A2E (14%) were the most prominent pigments identified, four additional peaks (I, 9.5%; II, 3%; IV, 1%; V, 1%) and a shoulder on the A2E peak (III) were also generated during photoisomerization. Absorbance spectra obtained for each of the observed peaks (Fig. 7, C and D) revealed maxima that were generally blue-shifted in comparison with A2E. Although the relative intensities of the absorbances at approximately 330 and 440 nm varied among these fractions, in all cases, the general shape of the spectra was similar to that of A2E and iso-A2E. To determine whether these compounds were structurally related to A2E, mass spectrometry analysis was performed. Accordingly, LC-MS analysis indicated that all of the peaks in question had molecular weights of 592, corresponding to that of A2E (Fig.8, A and B). Besides being present in light-exposed samples of synthetic A2E, these A2E isomers were also present in extracts of RPE-choroid harvested from human donor eyes (Fig. 8, C and D).Figure 8LC-MS analysis of photoequilibrated A2E pigment mixtures.

Several studies indicate that functional groups in the acyl chain of mycolic acids are important for pathogenesis and persistence.

Tuberculosis remains a leading cause of mortality worldwide, with ∼2 million people dying of the disease in 1997 (1.Dye C. Scheele S. Dolin P. Pathania V. Raviglione M.C. J. Am. Med. Assoc. 1999; 282: 677-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (2729) Google Scholar). It is estimated that one-third of the world population is infected with the causative pathogen Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The persistent phase of infection is one of the hallmarks of tuberculosis, when the bacteria are thought to be in a slow-growing or non-growing state (2.Parrish N.M. Dick J.D. Bishai W.R. Trends Microbiol. 1998; 6: 107-112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). There are many effective anti-tuberculosis drugs that target actively growing bacteria in cell processes such as cell wall biogenesis and chromosomal replication (3.Duncan K. Sacchettini J.C. Hatfull G.F. Jacobs J.W.R. Molecular Genetics of Mycobacteria. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.2000: 297-307Google Scholar). However, these drugs are not as effective against persistent bacteria, and this is typically why long multidrug therapies of 6–9 months are required to treat tuberculosis. Long term therapies have led to patient non-compliance and in turn contributed to the emergence of multi-drug resistant tuberculosis (4.McKinney J.D. Jacobs J.W.R. Bloom B.R. Emerging Infections. Academic Press, Inc., New York1998: 51-146Google Scholar). This points to an urgent need for new anti-mycobacterials, particularly therapies effective against persistent bacteria that could clear infection, rapidly reducing treatment times. Given this priority for the discovery of new anti-tuberculosis drugs, interest has been focused on a family of proteins that is involved in modifications of mycolic acids, very long chain lipids that are found either covalently attached to the cell wall or in the form of cord factor (trehalose dimycolate) and have been demonstrated to be important in the persistent phase of infection. Recently, Glickman et al. (5.Glickman M.S. Cox J.S. Jacobs Jr., W.R. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 717-727Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar) report results of a mutagenesis screen that selected for cording mutants and identified a mutation in umaA2 (Rv0470c-unknown in mycolicacid methyl transfer). Aside from its defect in cording, a phenotype often associated with pathogenicity, umaA2 was also shown to be required for long term mycobacterial persistence and virulence (5.Glickman M.S. Cox J.S. Jacobs Jr., W.R. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 717-727Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar). Characterization showed that the umaA2 mutant had alterations in a major class of mycolic acids of the cell wall. Indeed, umaA2 showed high homology to S-adenosyl-l-methionine (SAM) 1The abbreviations used are: SAMS-adenosyl-l-methionineAcpMacyl carrier protein (ACP)SAHS-adenosyl-l-homocysteineCTABcetyltrimethylammonium bromideDDDMABdidecyldimethylammonium bromidese-seleno-MES4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid -dependent methyltransferases called cyclopropane synthases. S-adenosyl-l-methionine acyl carrier protein (ACP) S-adenosyl-l-homocysteine cetyltrimethylammonium bromide didecyldimethylammonium bromide seleno- 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid Mycobacteria have an unusual cell wall in which mycolic acids play a critical role in its structure and function. Important characteristics conferred by this structure are resistance to chemical injury, low permeability to antibiotics, resistance to dehydration, and ability to thrive within the hostile environment of the macrophage phagolysosome (6.Barry 3rd, C.E. Lee R.E. Mdluli K. Sampson A.E. Schroeder B.G. Slayden R.A. Yuan Y. Prog. Lipid Res. 1998; 37: 143-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). Mycolic acids of mycobacteria are long chain α-alkyl, β-hydroxy fatty acids containing 70–90 carbons in total (6.Barry 3rd, C.E. Lee R.E. Mdluli K. Sampson A.E. Schroeder B.G. Slayden R.A. Yuan Y. Prog. Lipid Res. 1998; 37: 143-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar, 7.Brennan P.J. Nikaido H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 29-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (1572) Google Scholar, 8.Daffe M. Draper P. Adv. Microb. Physiol. 1998; 39: 131-203Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The α-branch is a saturated alkyl chain, typically 24 carbons long. The meromycolate chain contains 40–60 carbons with two positions of modification, the distal position (close to the ω-end) and the proximal position (close to the β-hydroxy end). There are three classes of mycolic acids synthesized by M. tuberculosiscalled α-, keto-, and methoxymycolates, that are classified according to their modifications at these two positions (Fig. 1a). The α-mycolates have a cis cyclopropane ring at both positions, whereas keto- and methoxymycolates have oxygenated groups at the distal position and a cyclopropane ring at the proximal position that can be in either a cis or transconformation. The first protein to be identified from M. tuberculosis involved in carrying out these modifications at either the distal or proximal position of mycolic acids was a cyclopropane mycolic acid synthase (cmaA1) (9.Yuan Y. Lee R.E. Besra G.S. Belisle J.T. Barry III, C.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6630-6634Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). It was identified based on its homology to the Escherichia colienzyme cyclopropane fatty acid synthase (10.Wang A.Y. Grogan D.W. Cronan Jr., J.E. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 11020-11028Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The enzyme from E. coli had previously been shown to be a SAM-dependent methyltransferase, which catalyzed the addition of a methyl group to a double bond of an acyl chain of the phospholipid bilayer, resulting in the formation of a cyclopropane ring (10.Wang A.Y. Grogan D.W. Cronan Jr., J.E. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 11020-11028Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). When CmaA1 was expressed in Mycobacterium smegmatis, it was shown that a cyclopropane ring was introduced at the distal position of the mycolic acids (9.Yuan Y. Lee R.E. Besra G.S. Belisle J.T. Barry III, C.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6630-6634Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Since then at least seven other homologous genes have been identified in the genome sequence of H37Rv (11.Cole S.T. Brosch R. Parkhill J. Garnier T. Churcher C. Harris D. Gordon S.V. Eiglmeier K. Gas S. Barry 3rd, C.E. Tekaia F. Badcock K. Basham D. Brown D. Chillingworth T. Connor R. Davies R. Devlin K. Feltwell T. Gentles S. Hamlin N. Holroyd S. Hornsby T. Jagels K. Krogh A. McLean J.

Nature. 1998; 393: 537-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (6557) Google Scholar). They are cmaA2 (cyclopropane mycolicacid synthase 2), mmaA1–4(methoxymycolic acid synthase), and umaA1-2 (unknown mycolicacid methyltransferase). These genes share between 50 and 75% identity with each other and are all thought to be SAM-utilizing methyltransferases. cmaA2 encodes a protein that cyclopropanates at the proximal position of mycolic acids when heterologously expressed in M. smegmatis (12.George K.M. Yuan Y. Sherman D.R. Barry III, C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27292-27298Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Further studies in M. tuberculosis have confirmed that CmaA2 modifies the proximal position, specifically catalyzing the formation of a trans cyclopropane ring of keto- and methoxymycolates (13.Glickman M.S. Cahill S.M. Jacobs Jr., W.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2228-2233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). UmaA2 was shown to be required for the synthesis of the proximal cyclopropane ring of the α-mycolates and was so renamed PcaA (proximal cyclopropanation ofalpha-mycolates) (5.Glickman M.S. Cox J.S. Jacobs Jr., W.R. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 717-727Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar). It is thought that MmaA2, which also synthesizes a proximal cis cyclopropane ring, acts on the methoxymycolates (14.Yuan Y. Barry III, C.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12828-12833Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 15.Dubnau E. Laneelle M.A. Soares S. Benichou A. Vaz T. Prome D. Prome J.C. Daffe M. Quemard A. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 23: 313-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). MmaA1 is believed to catalyze the conversion of a cis to trans double bond at the proximal position (16.Yuan Y. Crane D.C.

Chem. 1997; 272: 10041-10049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), whereas MmaA3 and MmaA4 are required for the formation of oxygen-containing mycolates at the distal position (14.Yuan Y.

Cyclopropanation of mycolic acids is a modification associated with pathogenic mycobacteria and is not common in the cell wall of saprophytic species such as M. smegmatis (19.Minnikin D.E. Ratledge C. Stanford J. The Biology of the Mycobacteria. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego1982: 95-184Google Scholar). In addition to the recent demonstration of the importance of a cyclopropane synthase, PcaA, in virulence and persistence of tuberculosis, other studies show that cyclopropane ring modifications have profound effects on the resistance of the mycobacteria to the oxidative stress (9.Yuan Y. Lee R.E. Besra G.S. Belisle J.T. Barry III, C.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6630-6634Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar) and the fluidity and permeability of the cell wall (12.George K.M. Yuan Y. Sherman D.R. Barry III, C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27292-27298Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 16.Yuan Y. Crane D.C. Musser J.M. Sreevatsan S. Barry III, C.E. J. Biol.

Microbiol. 2000; 36: 630-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). In E. coli and other bacteria that cyclopropanate their plasma membrane, this modification happens during the transition from active growth to stationary phase (20.Grogan D.W. Cronan Jr., J.E. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1997; 61: 429-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). Increased levels of cyclopropanation in E. coli have been shown to be a response to environmental conditions such as low pH, high incubation temperatures, and low aeration rates (20.Grogan D.W. Cronan Jr., J.E. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1997; 61: 429-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar, 21.Chang Y.Y. Cronan Jr., J.E. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 33: 249-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). Among Helicobacter isolates, those identified as gastric colonizers tend to make large amounts of cyclopropanated fatty acids, whereas those identified as intestinal colonizers generally do not (20.Grogan D.W. Cronan Jr., J.E. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1997; 61: 429-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). Mycobacteria make an extremely wide diversity of lipids and are unusual in that they possess both a multifunctional fatty acid synthase (type I), usually found in eukaryotes, and a multicomponent multifunctional fatty acid synthase (type II), usually found in prokaryotes (22.Kremer L. Baulard A.R. Besra D.S. Hatfull G.F. Jacobs J.W.R. Molecular Genetics of Mycobacteria. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.2000: 173-190Google Scholar). Type I multifunctional fatty acid synthase catalyzes de novosynthesis of short chain acyl-CoA esters up to 24–26 carbons long, then type II multifunctional fatty acid synthase, by steps of fatty acid chain elongation, desaturation, and cyclopropanation of the olefin, produces long chain fatty acids ranging from 24 to 56 carbons in length. Finally, it is thought that Claisen-type condensation leads to the biosynthesis of mycolic acids. It is believed that acyl carrier protein (AcpM) functions as the carrier of intermediates between the dissociated multifunctional fatty acid synthase type II enzymes (6.Barry 3rd, C.E. Lee R.E. Mdluli K. Sampson A.E. Schroeder B.G. Slayden R.A. Yuan Y. Prog. Lipid Res. 1998; 37: 143-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar,18.Yuan Y. Zhu Y. Crane D.D. Barry III, C.E. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 29: 1449-1458Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The details of the order of the steps in biosynthesis are not clear; however, at least two scenarios for the biosynthesis of the intact meromycolate chain exist. First, chain elongation produces 48–56 carbon meromycolates, and then this chain is functionalized by desaturases and cyclopropane synthases or, second, that desaturation and modifications of the acyl chain occur in a stepwise manner during elongation (6.Barry 3rd, C.E. Lee R.E. Mdluli K. Sampson A.E. Schroeder B.G. Slayden R.A. Yuan Y. Prog. Lipid Res. 1998; 37: 143-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). Intermediates shorter than full-length meromycolates, which are unsaturated or cyclopropanated, have been identified from cell-free extracts (23.Qureshi N. Takayama K. Schnoes H.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 182-189Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which may favor the suggestion that modifications are coupled to elongation, although it is unclear if this occurs in vivo. It does seem likely, however, that desaturation and cyclopropanation do occur before condensation with the α-branch (24.Qureshi N. Sathyamoorthy N. Takayama K. J. Bacteriol. 1984; 157: 46-52Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this work we report the structure of three members of the family of SAM-dependent cyclopropane synthases from M. tuberculosis, CmaA1, CmaA2, and PcaA. Comparison of the structure of CmaA1, which is believed to catalyze cyclopropanation at the distal position versus the structures of CmaA2 and PcaA, both of which catalyze this reaction at the proximal position of the meromycolate chain, suggest a possible basis for substrate specificity within this group of homologous enzymes. Furthermore, these high resolution structures, which are the first of an enzyme catalyzing synthesis of a cyclopropane ring to a lipid acceptor to be presented, are invaluable for rational-drug design against these new targets in mycolic acid biosynthesis. Plasmid pET-30b-cmaA1 was a generous gift from Dr. Vivek Sharma (Institute of Biosciences and Technology, Texas A&M University, Houston, TX). Plasmids pMSG134 and pMSG42 contained open reading frames for cmaA2 and pcaA from the M. tuberculosis strain Erdman. pcaA and cmaA2genes were amplified by PCR, including restriction sites for NdeI and BamHI, and cloned into pET-30b and pET-28b (Novagen), respectively. Plasmids were transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3) for expression of native protein and E. coli B834(DE3) cells for producing selenomethionine-incorporated proteins. For protein expression, cell cultures were grown in LB or terrific broth at 16–20 °C throughout. 0.5 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added for induction when cell density reached an A600 of ∼0.9. Cell cultures were incubated for another 24 h before harvest. Expression of se-PcaA and se-CmaA1 was achieved as above, except that minimal media with selenomethionine was used. Recombinant CmaA1 and PcaA proteins were purified by three chromatography columns; they were an anion-exchange chromatography column (Q-Sepharose), a cibachron Blue 3G affinity column (HiTrap Blue, Amersham Biosciences, Inc.), and a Superdex-75 gel filtration column. A fourth hydrophobic column (phenyl-Superose) was applied for further purifying CmaA1 protein. Recombinant CmaA2 protein was purified by a nickel affinity column by use of the engineered His6 tag at the N terminus. The His6 tag was then removed by thrombin, and CmaA2 protein without the His6 tag was purified by another nickel affinity chromatography and an anion-exchange column (SOURCE 15Q, Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). Tris-HCl or KH2PO4 buffers (pH 7.4–8.0) containing 1 mm dithiothreitol and 1 mm EDTA were used for purification. Purified recombinant proteins were concentrated to >5 mg ml−1, flash-frozen, and stored at −80 °C before crystallization. Crystals were obtained by either hanging drop vapor diffusion method (PcaA, CmaA2) or microbatch method (CmaA1) using paraffin oil. 7–10 mg ml−1 protein was mixed with an equal volume of precipitant solution, forming a 3–5-μl drop, and incubated at 19 °C. For protein crystals complexed with ligands, 0.5–2 mm S-adenosyl-l-homocysteine (SAH) and 100–200 μm cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB)/didecyldimethylammonium bromide (DDDMAB) (CmaA1 and CmaA2) were preincubated with proteins for 5–10 min at room temperature. The precipitant solution for crystals of se-CmaA1-SAH-CTAB and CmaA1-SAH-DDDMAB was 8% polyethylene glycol 4000, 0.1 mCH3CO2Na, pH 4.6, and 0.2 mCH3CO2NH4. ApoCmaA1 crystals were obtained by using 22% polyethylene glycol 4000, 0.2 mMES, pH 6.5, 0.3 mCH3CO2NH4, and 3% 1,6-hexanediol as the precipitant solution. For PcaA crystals, 14–16% polyethylene glycol 6000, 0.1 m CH3CO2Na, pH 4.8, and 2.5 mm n-octanoylsucrose was used as the precipitant solution. Se-PcaA was crystallized under the same conditions and was isomorphous. The precipitant solution for growing crystals of CmaA2-SAH-DDDMAB was 1.8 m(NH4)2SO4, 0.1 mTris-HCl, pH 8.5. The multiwavelength anomalous dispersion data of the se-CmaA1-SAH-CTAB and se-PcaA-SAH were collected at beamline 14-BM-D on an Area Detector Systems Corporation Q4 CCD area detector at the Advanced Photon Source, Argonne National Laboratory. CmaA1-SAH-DDDMAB and CmaA2-SAH-DDDMAB crystals were collected at 1.0 Å at beamline 14-BM-C at the Advanced Photon Source, Argonne National Laboratory. The crystals were flash-frozen in a liquid nitrogen stream at 100 K. Paratone-N (Hampton) was used as a cryoprotectant for CmaA1 and PcaA, and paraffin oil was used for CmaA2. The diffraction data of the apoCmaA1 crystal was collected on a NONIUS/MACSCIENCE/DIP2030 image plate detector using a Rigaku rotating anode x-ray source with CuKα radiation. The crystal was flash-frozen at 120 K. All data were processed and reduced using DENZO and SCALEPACK (25.Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38617) Google Scholar). Structures of se-CmaA1-SAH-CTAB and se-PcaA-SAH were solved using multiwavelength anomalous dispersion phasing (26.Hendrickson W.A. Science. 1991; 254: 51-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (1019) Google Scholar). Thirty-two heavy atom positions of se-CmaA1 and 15 sites of se-PcaA were determined automatically in SOLVE (27.Terwilliger T.C. Berendzen J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1999; 55: 849-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (3220) Google Scholar) with an overall figure-of-merit of 0.66 at 2.4 Å resolution for se-CmaA1 and 0.42 at 3.0 Å resolution for se-PcaA. The 16th selenomethionine site of se-PcaA was revealed from the residual electro-density map. The heavy atom parameters were then refined, and phase was calculated in SHARP (28.de La Fortelle E. Bricogne G. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 472-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (1797) Google Scholar). The phasing statistics are shown in Table I. The electron density map was further improved by density modification using density modification implemented in CCP4 software packages (29.Cowtan K.D. Main P. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1996; 52: 43-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Noncrystallographic symmetry averaging was used in DM for se-PcaA. All the model building was done in program O (30.Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13014) Google Scholar) and SPOCK (31.Christopher J.A. SPOCK. The Structural Properties Observation and Calculation Kit Program Manual. The Center for Macromolecular Design, Texas A&M University, College Station, TX1998Google Scholar). Refinements were carried out in crystallographic and NMR systems (32.Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. Delano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.-S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S.

Noncrystallographic symmetry restraints were applied in early rounds of refinement. After simulated annealing refinement of the initial model and several cycles of manual correction and minimization, residues 173–187 were visible in the Fo − Fcmap and were constructed. SAH, CTAB, and a bicarbonate ion were built, and water molecules were added using crystallographic and NMR systems and inspected by Fo− Fc maps. The assignment of the bicarbonate ion is based on the hydrogen bond patterns. Refinements of the structures were completed after a few more rounds of positional minimization and B-factor refinement. The final model of CmaA1 contains residues 3–5 to 287, and the final model of PcaA contains residues 16–287, 16–175, and 188–287. Both models have >86% of the residues in the most favorable region of the Ramachandran plot and none in the disallowed region inspected by PROCHECK (33.Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S.

To solve the structure of CmaA1-SAH-DDDMAB, four molecules of the model of se-CmaA1-SAH-CTAB, with all non-protein atoms excluded, were treated as individual rigid bodies in the rigid-body refinement. Simulated annealing (5000 K), several rounds of manual correction, positional minimization, and B-factor refinement were then carried out. SAH, DDDMAB, and a bicarbonate ion were built, and 737 water molecules were added using crystallographic and NMR systems and inspected by Fo − Fc maps. The final model contains residues 3–5 to 287 and has 91.7% in the most favorable region. Structures of apoCmaA1 and CmaA2-SAH-DDDMAB were solved by molecular replacement using AMoRe in CCP4 (34.Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1994; 50: 157-163Crossref Scopus (5030) Google Scholar). One molecule of se-CmaA1 with SAH and CTAB, with all non-protein atoms excluded, was used as the search model. After rigid-body refinement, correlation coefficients are 55.1 and 50.9, and R-factors are 45.5 and 43.1 for apoCmaA1 and CmaA2, respectively. The models were then further refined in crystallographic and NMR systems. Residues 135–150 and 170–206 of apoCmaA1 and residues 186–208 and 152–160 of CmaA2 were re-built manually by examining the Fo − Fc map. The first 18 residues of apoCmaA1 were not visible and removed. Simulated annealing from 5000 K, several rounds of manual correction, positional minimization, and B-factor refinement were carried out. Water molecules were then added by inspection of Fo −Fc map. The final model of apoCmaA1 contains residues 18–287 and an acetate ion with 88.4% of the residues in the most favorable region. The final model of CmaA2 complexed with SAH and DDDMAB contains residues 12–302, a SAH molecule, a DDDMAB molecule, and a bicarbonate ion with 89.5% of the residues in the most favorable region. A family of 8 homologous mycolic acid methyltransferases from M. tuberculosis have been identified that share 50–75% identity (Fig. 1c). Similar enzymes have also been observed in Mycobacterium leprae, Mycobacterium bovis BCG, and M. smegmatis (www.sanger.ac.uk; www.tigr.org). Cyclopropane synthases of M. tuberculosis show ∼30–35% identity with cyclopropane fatty acyl phospholipid synthases of bacteria such as E. coli, Helicobacter pylori, and Campylobacter jejuni.

Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) is an important modulator of extracellular signals, including those elicited by E-cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion, which plays an important role in maintenance of the structural and functional integrity of epithelia. In this study, we analyzed the involvement of PI3K in the differentiation of human intestinal epithelial cells. We showed that inhibition of PI3K signaling in Caco-2/15 cells repressed sucrase-isomaltase and villin protein expression. Morphological differentiation of enterocyte-like features in Caco-2/15 cells such as epithelial cell polarity and brush-border formation were strongly attenuated by PI3K inhibition. Immunofluorescence and immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that PI3K was recruited to and activated by E-cadherin-mediated cell-cell contacts in confluent Caco-2/15 cells, and this activation appears to be essential for the integrity of adherens junctions and association with the cytoskeleton. We provide evidence that the assembly of calcium-dependent adherens junctions led to a rapid and remarkable increase in the state of activation of Akt and p38 MAPK pathways and that this increase was blocked in the presence of anti-E-cadherin antibodies and PI3K inhibitor. Therefore, our results indicate that PI3K promotes assembly of adherens junctions, which, in turn, control p38 MAPK activation and enterocyte differentiation.

This process involves cell generation and migration from the stem cell population located at the bottom of the crypt to the extrusion of terminally differentiated cells at the tip of the villus (1Babyatsky M.W. Podolsky D.K. Yamada T. Growth and Development of the Gastrointestinal Tract. 3rd Ed. J. B. Lippincott Co., Philadelphia1999: 547-584Google Scholar). Thus, the crypt is mainly composed of proliferative and poorly differentiated cells, whereas the villus is lined with functional absorptive, goblet, and endocrine cells (1Babyatsky M.W. Podolsky D.K. Yamada T. Growth and Development of the Gastrointestinal Tract. 3rd Ed. J. B. Lippincott Co., Philadelphia1999: 547-584Google Scholar). The molecular and cellular mechanisms responsible for the fine coordination between proliferation, migration, and differentiation along the crypt-villus axis are still largely unknown. E-cadherin-mediated cell-cell attachment plays an important role in the differentiation, polarization, and homeostasis of many epithelia (2Takeichi M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 619-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (1262) Google Scholar, 3Larue L. Antos C. Butz S. Huber O. Delmas V. Dominis M. Kemler R.

Cadherins are responsible for cell-cell adhesion through a calcium-dependent interaction of their extracellular domains. Their cytoplasmic tails are linked to the cytoskeleton through a complex of proteins that includes α-, β-, and γ-catenins. This link is involved in the strengthening of cell-cell adhesion and in the cohesion of epithelial tissues (5Jou T.S. Stewart D.B. Stappert J. Nelson W.J. Mars J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5067-5071Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). The importance of cadherins in the renewal of the intestinal epithelium has been demonstrated in vivo in two mouse models. Overexpression of E-cadherin in the crypts of the small intestine reduces cell proliferation and migration (6Hermiston M.L. Gordon J.I. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 489-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). Conversely, expression of a dominant-negative N-cadherin leads to over-proliferation, uncoordinated differentiation, and a Crohn's disease phenotype (7Hermiston M.L. Gordon J.I. Science. 1995; 270: 1203-1207Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar). The intracellular signaling pathways that transmit extracellular cues for epithelial differentiation along the crypt-villus axis of the intestine remain poorly defined. We recently reported that p38 MAPK1 plays a crucial role in intestinal epithelial cell differentiation by enhancing the transactivation capacity of CDX2 (8Houde M. Laprise P. Jean D. Blais M. Asselin C. Rivard N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21885-21894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), an intestine-specific homeobox gene product well known for its broad effect on enterocyte differentiation (9Traber P.G. Silberg D.G. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1996; 58: 275-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). However, the upstream signaling pathways activating p38 MAPK in committed intestinal cells induced to differentiate remain to be defined. Interestingly, in vitroexperiments have shown that the establishment of cell-cell contacts in intestinal cell cultures could be a critical step in initiating p38 MAPK action (8Houde M. Laprise P.

An important role for p38 MAPK in various mammalian cell differentiation processes has recently been proposed (16Nebrada A.R. Porras A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 26: 257-260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (500) Google Scholar). For instance, differentiation of C2C12 and L8 myoblasts into myotubes has been found to be mediated by p38 activation (17Cuenda A. Cohen P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4341-4346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar, 18Zetser A. Gredinger E. Bengal E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5193-5200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). Although this skeletal muscle differentiation requires phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), it is not yet clear whether PI3K and p38 MAPK act in a common pathway (19Chun Y.K. Kim J. Kwon S.

Cell. Signal. 2000; 11–12: 751-757Crossref Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The PI3K family members are lipid kinases that phosphorylate phosphoinositides at position 3 of the inositol ring (21Rameh L.E. Cantley L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8347-8350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (852) Google Scholar), acting as membrane anchors that locate and activate pleckstrin homology domain-containing effectors such as the well characterized serine/threonine kinase Akt (22Datta S.R. Brunet A. Greenberg M.E. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2905-2927Crossref PubMed Scopus (3729) Google Scholar). Class I PI3Ks are generally composed of a p85 regulatory subunit and a p110 catalytic subunit (21Rameh L.E. Cantley L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8347-8350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (852) Google Scholar). This class of PI3Ks can be activated by a wide variety of extracellular stimuli, including those elicited by E-cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion (23Pece S. Chiariello M. Murga C. Gutkind J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19347-19351Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). In this study, the role and regulation of PI3K in intestinal epithelial cells were investigated. Using several approaches, we demonstrated that PI3K is necessary for the functional and morphological differentiation of intestinal epithelial cells. We also found that PI3K is recruited to and activated by E-cadherin-mediated cell-cell contacts in confluent Caco-2/15 cultures and that this activation appears to be essential for the integrity of the adherens junctions and the association of their components with the cytoskeleton. Finally, we have provided evidence that the assembly of the adherens junctions stimulates Akt and p38 MAPK in a PI3K-dependent manner. [γ-32P]ATP and the enhanced chemiluminescence immunodetection system (ECL) were obtained from Amersham Biosciences, Inc. (Baie d'Urfé, Québec, Canada).

The Caco-2/15 cell line was obtained from Dr. A. Quaroni. This clone of the parent Caco-2 cell line (HTB37; American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) has been extensively characterized elsewhere (13Vachon P.H. Beaulieu J.-F.

This cell line was routinely cultured in plastic dishes in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen, Burlington, Ontario) containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 4 mm glutamine, 20 mm HEPES, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. Caco-2/15 cells were used between passages 53 and 78. Studies were performed on cultures at subconfluence (50%) and confluence and between days 2 and 15 post-confluence. Cells were lysed in SDS sample buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 2.3% SDS, 10% glycerol, 5% β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.005% bromphenol blue). Proteins (10–50 μg) from whole cell lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE on 7.5 or 10% gels. Proteins were detected immunologically following electrotransfer onto nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). Protein and molecular mass markers (Bio-Rad, Mississauga) were revealed by Ponceau red staining. Membranes were blocked in PBS containing 5% powdered milk and 0.05% Tween 20 for at least 1 h at 25 °C. Membranes were then incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary antibodies in blocking solution and then with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG (1:1000) for 1 h. The blots were visualized using the Amersham Biosciences ECL system. Protein concentrations were measured using a modified Lowry procedure with bovine serum albumin as the standard (27Peterson G.L. Anal. Biochem. 1977; 83: 346-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (7141) Google Scholar). The sucrase-isomaltase reporter construct (provided by Dr. P. G. Traber, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia) used for luciferase assays contained the human sucrase-isomaltase promoter from residues −183 to +54 cloned upstream of the luciferase gene of the pGL2 reporter construct as described previously (9Traber P.G. Silberg D.G. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1996; 58: 275-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The pRL-SV40 Renilla luciferase vector was from Promega. Expression vectors for a constitutively active form of PI3K (p110*) and a dominant-negative form of PI3K (Δp85) were obtained from Dr. Julian Downward (Imperial Cancer Research Fund, London, United Kingdom) and Dr. Masato Kasuga (Kobe University School of Medicine, Kobe, Japan). Green fluorescent protein (GFP) (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) was subcloned into the expression vector pLHCX (CLONTECH). Newly confluent Caco-2/15 cells grown on glass coverslips in six-well plates were cotransfected by lipofection (LipofectAMINE 2000, Invitrogen) with 0.5 μg of pLHCX-GFP and 0.5 μg of pcDNA3 containing or not the dominant-negative form of PI3K (Δp85). Two days following transfection, cells were fixed for GFP fluorescence and immunofluorescence with either anti-E-cadherin antibody or anti-total actin antibody. Confluent Caco-2/15 cells grown in 24-well plates were transfected by lipofection (LipofectAMINE 2000) as described previously (15Aliaga J.C. Deschênes C. Beaulieu J.-F. Calvo E.L. Rivard N. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: G631-G641PubMed Google Scholar) with 0.1 μg of sucrase-isomaltase/luciferase reporter. One day following transfection, cells were treated with 0, 1, 2, 5, 10, and 20 μm LY294002 for 24 h, and luciferase activity was measured. In other experiments, the sucrase-isomaltase reporter gene vector was cotransfected with 0.1 μg of pcDNA3 containing or not the dominant-negative (Δp85) or constitutively active (p110*) form of PI3K. Luciferase activity was measured 36 h after transfection. The pRL-SV40 Renilla luciferase vector was used as a control for transfection efficiency. Cell cultures were rinsed with PBS, prefixed for 15 min with a 1:1 mixture of culture medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium) and freshly prepared 2.8% glutaraldehyde in cacodylate buffer (0.1 m cacodylate and 7.5% sucrose), and then fixed for 30 min with 2.8% glutaraldehyde at room temperature. After two rinses, specimens were post-fixed for 60 min with 2% osmium tetroxide in cacodylate buffer. The cells were then dehydrated using increasing ethanol concentrations (40, 70, 90, 95, and 100%; three times each) and covered twice for 3 h with a thin layer of Araldite 502 resin (for ethanol substitution). Finally, the resin was allowed to polymerize at 60 °C for 48 h. The specimens were detached from the plastic vessels, inverted in embedding molds, covered with Araldite 502, and reincubated at 60 °C for 48 h. Thin sections were prepared using an ultramicrotome, contrasted with lead citrate and uranyl acetate, and observed in a blind fashion on a Jeol 100 CX transmission electron microscope. All reagents were purchased from Electron Microscopy Sciences (Cedarlane, Hornby, Ontario). First, the cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS, and then soluble proteins were extracted on ice with cold lysis/cytoskeleton stabilization buffer (0.5% Triton X-100, 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm PIPES (pH 6.8), 300 mm sucrose, and 3 mmMgCl2). The cytoskeleton-associated proteins (insoluble fraction) were harvested by centrifugation (13,000 rpm at 4 °C for 20 min) and solubilized in SDS buffer (15 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 5 mm EDTA, 2.5 mm EGTA, and 1% SDS) (28Somasiri A. Colleen W. Ellchuk T. Turley S. Rosekelley C.D. Differentiation. 2000; 66: 116-1125Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Finally, E-cadherin and β-catenin levels were determined by immunoblotting of the cytoskeleton and total fractions (equal amounts of the soluble and cytoskeleton fractions). Cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and lysed in chilled lysis buffer (150 mmNaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 40 mm Tris (pH 7.6), 1% Triton X-100, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.1 mm orthovanadate, and 40 mmβ-glycerophosphate). Cell lysates were then cleared of cellular debris by centrifugation. Primary antibodies were added to 600 μg of each cell lysate and incubated for 2 h at 4 °C under agitation. Forty μg of protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) were subsequently added for 1 h (4 °C under agitation). Immunocomplexes were then harvested by centrifugation and washed four times with ice-cold lysis buffer. Proteins were solubilized with Laemmli buffer and separated by SDS-PAGE. Caco-2/15 cells grown on sterile glass coverslips were washed twice with ice-cold PBS. Cultures were then fixed with 30% methanol and 70% acetone for 15 min at −20 °C, permeabilized with a solution of 0.1% of Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min, and blocked with PBS and 2% bovine serum albumin for 20 min at room temperature. Cells were finally immunostained for 1 h with the primary antibody and for 30 min with the secondary antibody. For F-actin staining, fixed cells were incubated with 1 μg/ml fluorescein isothiocyanate-phalloidin for 30 min. For total actin staining, fixed cells were incubated with antibody raised against total actin and then with rhodamine-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG. Negative controls (no primary antibody) were included in all experiments. Cells were lysed for 10 min on ice with 1 ml/dish lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 40 mm Tris (pH 7.60), and 1% Triton X-100) supplemented with protease inhibitors (0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin) and phosphatase inhibitors (0.1 mm orthovanadate and 40 mm β-glycerophosphate). p38 MAPK was immunoprecipitated from 400 μg of cell lysate. Immunocomplexes were then washed four times with ice-cold lysis buffer and three times with ice-cold kinase buffer (20 mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mmdithiothreitol, and 30 mm HEPES (pH 7.4)) prior to the kinase assay. The kinase reaction was initiated by incubating the immunocomplexes at 30 °C in the presence of myelin basic protein and [γ-32P]ATP at 2 μg and 2 μCi/assay, respectively. After 30 min, the reaction was stopped by adding Laemmli buffer. Radiolabeled substrates were separated from immunocomplexes by SDS-12.5% PAGE and autoradiographed. Incorporation of 32P by myelin basic protein was linear over the course of the kinase assay. Day 2 post-confluent Caco-2/15 cells were serum-starved for 16 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 20 mm HEPES, 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, and 4 mm glutamine. The adherens junctions were then disrupted by treatment with 4 mm EGTA for 30 min at 37 °C. Intercellular contacts were subsequently allowed to re-establish by restoration of the extracellular calcium concentration by replacing the EGTA-containing medium with fresh medium (1.8 mm CaCl2) (23Pece S.

Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 1832-1842Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). In some experiments, the fresh medium contained 100 μg/ml anti-E-cadherin antibody or mouse IgG purified from nonimmune serum. After selected time intervals of calcium restoration, cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and lysed to detect phospho-Akt and to assay p38 MAPK activity or were fixed for immunofluorescence. To investigate the role of PI3K in intestinal epithelial cell differentiation, we evaluated the impact of its inhibition on the spontaneous enterocytic differentiation of the human colon cancer cell line Caco-2/15. This cell line provides a unique and well characterized model for the study of intestinal epithelial differentiation because these cells undergo differentiation to a small bowel-like phenotype with microvilli, dome formation, and the expression of sucrase-isomaltase several days after reaching confluence (12Pinto M. Robine-Leon S. Appay M.D. Kedinger M. Triadou N. Bussaulx N. Lacroix B. Simon-Assman P. Haffen K. Fogh J. Zweibaum A. Biol. Cell. 1983; 47: 323-330Google Scholar, 13Vachon P.H. Beaulieu J.-F.

To block PI3K signaling, we used LY294002, a compound that acts as a competitive inhibitor of the adenosine triphosphate-binding site of PI3K and has been shown to cause specific inhibition with an IC50 of 1.4–5 μm in intact cells (30Vlahos C.J. Matter W.F. Hui K.Y. Brown R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5241-5248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Daily addition of 10 μm LY294002 beginning at confluence strongly attenuated the expression levels of two enterocytic differentiation markers, viz. sucrase-isomaltase and villin, compared with untreated cells at days 3, 6, and 12 post-confluence (Fig. 1 A). Loss of PI3K activity did not interfere with overall protein expression, as shown by similar actin levels in LY294002-treated and untreated cells (Fig.1 A). To ascertain that the loss of differentiation marker expression was not a consequence of increased apoptosis, we evaluated the expression of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, a well known caspase-3 substrate (31Casciola-Rosen L. Nicholson D.W. Chong T. Rowan K.R. Thornberry N.A. Miller D.K. Rosen A. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 1957-1964Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar), in cells treated with LY294002. As shown in Fig.1 A, chronic treatment of confluent Caco-2/15 cells with the PI3K inhibitor had no effect on poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage, suggesting that persistent inhibition of PI3K did not affect Caco-2/15 cell survival. The role of PI3K in sucrase-isomaltase expression was further investigated by transient transfection of newly confluent Caco-2/15 cells with a luciferase reporter gene under the control of the human sucrase-isomaltase promoter. As shown in Fig. 1 B, sucrase-isomaltase gene expression was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by the PI3K inhibitor LY294002, with a maximal effect observed at 20 μm (91% inhibition). Furthermore, overexpression of a dominant-negative form of the regulatory p85 subunit (Δp85) reduced sucrase-isomaltase gene expression by 50%. Conversely, overexpression of a constitutively active p110 subunit (p110*) slightly enhanced sucrase-isomaltase gene expression. Caco-2/15 cell cultures were characterized by transmission electron microscopy day 14 post-confluence. As shown in Fig.2 (panels 1, 3, and5), post-confluent Caco-2/15 cells exhibited ultrastructural characteristics similar to those found in the intact villus epithelium, including well organized brush borders, terminal webs at the luminal aspect of absorptive cells, and typical junctional complexes. Interestingly, treatment of confluent Caco-2/15 cells with the PI3K inhibitor remarkably affected cell polarization and brush-border formation. Indeed, LY294002-treated cells exhibited a less polarized and flat phenotype compared with untreated cells (Fig. 2, panels 1 and 2). The morphology of the brush border was altered markedly, as visualized by a reduction in the number of microvilli (Fig. 2, panels 3 and 4). Interestingly, poorly defined apical junctional complexes were observed in LY294002-treated cells (Fig. 2, panels 5 and6). Taken together, these results indicate that PI3K activity is necessary for functional and morphological differentiation of intestinal epithelial cells. Cell-cell adhesion plays a crucial role in the polarization and differentiation of epithelial cells (2Takeichi M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 619-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (1262) Google Scholar, 3Larue L. Antos C. Butz S. Huber O. Delmas V. Dominis M. Kemler R.

Our observation that LY294002-treated cells exhibited a less polarized and differentiated phenotype as well as poorly defined apical junctions prompted us to investigate whether PI3K might control the assembly of adherens and tight junctions in Caco-2/15 cells. We performed E-cadherin and ZO-1 staining in a two-step experiment in which tight and adherens junctions of day 2 post-confluent Caco-2/15 cells were disrupted by chelating extracellular calcium and subsequently allowed to re-establish by restoration of extracellular calcium (23Pece S.

Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 1832-1842Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) in the presence or absence of LY294002. The untreated cells showed typical honeycomb E-cadherin and ZO-1 staining (Fig.3 A, panels 1 and5). After a 30-min EGTA treatment, cells became rounded, whereas E-cadherin and ZO-1 staining formed a diffuse ring at the cell periphery (Fig. 3 A, panels 2 and 6). Following calcium restoration, E-cadherin and ZO-1 redistributed at the sites of cell-cell contact, and the cells reacquired their epithelial shape (Fig. 3 A, panels 3 and 7), suggesting that tight and adherens junctions were almost completely reformed. However, in LY294002-treated cells, most of the immunoreactive E-cadherin remained diffusely distributed (Fig.3 A, panel 4). Interestingly, similar results were also noted in Caco-2/15 cells transiently transfected with the dominant-negative mutant of p85 (Fig. 3 B), indicating that PI3K inhibition interfered with the assembly of adherens junctions. This phenomenon appears to be specific for adherens junctions because ZO-1 redistributed at the sites of cell-cell contact even in the presence of LY294002 (Fig. 3 A, panel 8). Previous studies have shown that the E-cadherin and β-catenin associated with functional adherens junctions are indirectly linked to the cytoskeleton (32Hülsken J. Birchmeier W. Behrens J. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 2061-2069Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar). Thus, they cannot be extracted with a solution of 0.5% of the nonionic detergent Triton X-100, but are found in the insoluble fraction. Inhibition of PI3K resulted in a significant reduction in the proportion of E-cadherin and β-catenin associated with the cytoskeleton after 16–72 h of treatment in newly confluent Caco-2/15 cells (Fig. 4 A,upper panels). Total amounts of E-cadherin or β-catenin proteins remained comparable. Interestingly, inhibition of PI3K activity by LY294002 or by ectopic expression of the dominant-negative mutant of p85 in newly confluent cells also led to a partial disruption of F-actin at the periphery of the cytoplasmic membrane (Fig.4 B, rig"

Here we report the effect of double-stranded DNA oligonucleotides containing a single 8-oxo-G on the DNA binding affinity, ATPase, and ADP → ATP exchange activities of hMSH2-hMSH6 and hMSH2-hMSH3. We found that hMSH2-hMSH6 binds the oligonucleotide DNA substrates with the following affinities: 8-oxo-G/T > 8-oxo-G/G > 8-oxo-G/A > 8-oxo-G/C ≈ G/C. A similar trend was observed for DNA-stimulated ATPase and ADP → ATP exchange activities of hMSH2-hMSH6. In contrast, hMSH2-hMSH3 did not appear to bind any of the 8-oxo-G containing DNA substrates nor was there enhanced ATPase or ADP → ATP exchange activities. These results suggest that only hMSH2-hMSH6 is activated by recognition of 8-oxo-G lesions.

Such damage results from a variety of interactions between reactive oxygen species with DNA (for review, see Ref. 3Friedberg E.C. Walker G.C. Siede W. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1995Google Scholar). Sources of these reactive oxygen species have been well documented and include chronic inflammation, by-products of cellular metabolism, by-products of peroxisome activity, and a considerable number of environmental factors (4Beckman K.B.

Med. 1996; 74: 297-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (845) Google Scholar). Although there are many forms of oxidative modifications to DNA, 8-oxo-guanine (8-oxo-G)1 represents one of the most abundant and widely studied lesions (6Fraga C.G. Shigenaga M.K. Park J.W. Degan P.

Nature. 1991; 349: 431-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (2047) Google Scholar). Following a subsequent round of DNA replication, the erroneous adenine on the template strand will be paired with thymine, resulting in a signature G to T transversion. In addition, 8-oxo-G that is available from nucleotide pools may be incorporated into DNA during replication (9Maki H. Sekiguchi M. Nature. 1992; 355: 273-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (792) Google Scholar). Bacteria, yeast, and human cells contain overlapping and redundant 8-oxo-G recognition systems (for review, see Ref. 3Friedberg E.C. Walker G.C. Siede W. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1995Google Scholar). For example,Escherichia coli has at least four 8-oxo-G processing glycosylases: 1) the MutM/fpg glycosylase removes global genomic 8-oxo-G lesions except those that occur in the context of an 8-oxo-G/A mismatch; 2) the MutY glycosylase presumably removes the A opposite 8-oxo-G in the nascent DNA strand following replication; 3) the Nei(EndoVIII) glycosylase presumably removes 8-oxo-G opposite A in the nascent DNA strand following replication; and 4) MutT acts as an 8-oxo-GTPase that effectively removes oxidative damage from the nucleotide pools. Examination of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae genome sequence as well as biochemical studies have suggested MutM/fpg (designated OGG1 in yeast), and Nei(EndoVIII) (designated OGG-2/Ntg1 in yeast) are functionally conserved (10Nash H.M.

DNA mismatches and insertion/deletion loops (IDL) which arise from errors during DNA replication represent another challenge to genomic integrity. Mismatch repair (MMR) is the predominant pathway for the repair of these misincorporation errors. The humanMutShomologs hMSH2, hMSH3, and hMSH6 play a fundamental role in the recognition and signaling of MMR (for review, see Refs. 18Fishel R. Wilson T. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1997; 7: 105-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 19Fishel R. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2096-2101Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 20Fishel R. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 7369-7374PubMed Google Scholar). The hMSH2-hMSH6 heterodimer primarily recognizes DNA base/base mismatches and single nucleotide IDL mismatches (21Acharya S. Wilson T. Gradia S.

The hMSH2-hMSH3 heterodimer also recognizes single nucleotide IDLs as well as larger IDLs (21Acharya S. Wilson T. Gradia S. Kane M.F. Guerrette S. Marsischky G.T. Kolodner R. Fishel R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13629-13634Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). The eukaryotic MutS homologs have been extensively studied for their role in the recognition and repair of DNA mismatches and IDLs, but they also appear to recognize other abnormalities in DNA. For example, hMSH2-hMSH6 has been shown to bind DNA oligonucleotides containing cisplatin and O 6-methylguanine lesions (22Duckett D.R. Drummond J.T. Murchie A.I. Reardon J.T. Sancar A. Lilley D.M.

Chem. 2000; 275: 27851-27857Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Genetic and biochemical evidence also suggests a role for MSH2 and hMSH6 in the repair of 8-oxo-G lesions (25Earley M.C. Crouse G.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15487-15491Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Compared with wild type cells, Msh2-deficient mouse embryonic stem cells appeared resistant to prolonged low level ionizing radiation and accumulated a significantly greater number of 8-oxo-G in their genomic DNA (1DeWeese T.L. Shipman J.M. Larrier N.A. Buckley N.M. Kidd L.R. Groopman J.D. Cutler R.G. te Riele H. Nelson W.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11915-11920Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). In addition, cell lines deficient for hMSH2 have been found to be deficient for transcription-coupled DNA repair (TCR) of oxidative lesions (26Leadon S.A. Avrutskaya A.V. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 3784-3791PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, the combination of S. cerevisiae msh2 or msh6 (but not msh3) mutations with a mutation of ogg-1 resulted in a synergistic increase in G to T transversions (2Ni T.T. Marsischky G.T. Kolodner R.D. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 439-444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Consistent with these genetic results, purified scMsh2-scMsh6 was shown to bind DNA oligonucleotides containing a single 8-oxo-G lesion by gel-shift analysis and to be released from these substrates in the presence of ATP but not ADP (2Ni T.T. Marsischky G.T. Kolodner R.D. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 439-444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Taken together, these latter results suggest that MSH2 and MSH6 (presumably as a heterodimer) recognize and are activated by 8-oxo-G lesions. The mechanism by which the mismatch repair heterodimers perform their role in the repair of DNA mismatches, as well as other abnormalities in DNA structure, continues to be an area of debate. A model that is consistent with the available biochemical and structural data suggests that both hMSH2-hMSH6 and hMSH2-hMSH3 heterodimers behave as molecular switches that are regulated by binding ADP or ATP (19Fishel R.

In the ADP-bound form, rapid high affinity DNA binding is observed between the heterodimers and oligonucleotides containing a mismatch or an IDL. Recognition of the mismatch results in ADP release by a mechanism that appears similar to GDP release by guanine nucleotide exchange factors. 2M. Berardini, C. Heinen, T. Wilson, and R. Fishel, unpublished results. In the presence of physiological levels of ATP, these MutS homologs undergo rapid ADP → ATP nucleotide exchange (24Berardini M. Mazurek A. Fishel R. J. Biol.

As with G proteins undergoing GDP → GTP exchange, ADP → ATP exchange by MutS homologs is accompanied by a large conformational transition. In the case of MutS homologs this conformational transition results in the formation of a hydrolysis-independent sliding clamp associated with the duplex DNA adjacent to the mismatch (28Gradia S. Subramanian D. Wilson T. Acharya S. Makhov A. Griffith J. Fishel R. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 255-261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar, 31Gradia S. Acharya S. Fishel R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3922-3930Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Diffusion of the MutS homologs away from the mismatch allows the loading of multiple redundant sliding clamps that propagate a mismatch-recognition signal to downstream protein machinery such as the MutL homologs (MLH); ultimately culminating in a mismatch repair event. One of the fundamental predictions of this model is that bona fidemismatch and/or lesion recognition is determined by whether the abnormality elicits ADP → ATP nucleotide exchange. In addition, the ability of a mismatch and/or lesion to elicit nucleotide exchange is likely to be specific for the MSH heterodimers. For example, oligonucleotides containing an O 6-methylguanine adduct were found to activate nucleotide exchange by hMSH2-hMSH6 but not hMSH2-hMSH3 (24Berardini M. Mazurek A. Fishel R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27851-27857Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). These biochemical observations were confirmed by the observation that hMSH2- or hMSH6-deficient cells were resistant to the O 6-guanine alkylating agent MNNG, but hMSH3-deficient cells remained sensitive to MNNG (32de Wind N.

In addition to MNNG, MMR-deficient cell lines have been found to be resistant to cisplatin, 5-fluorouracil, and temozolomide (33Toft N.J. Winton D.J. Kelly J. Howard L.A. Dekker M. te Riele H.

These and other results have suggested that the MMR proteins may also function as sensors connecting DNA damage to apoptosis (20Fishel R.

In this study, we examined recognition of oligonucleotides containing a single 8-oxo-G lesion by hMSH2-hMSH6 and/or hMSH2-hMSH3. Three criteria were established for bona fide recognition and activation of MSHs by 8-oxo-G: 1) affinity for a DNA oligonucleotide substrate containing a well defined 8-oxo-G; 2) the ability to enhance ATPase activity; and 3) the ability to enhance ADP → ATP nucleotide exchange activity. We found that only the hMSH2-hMSH6 heterodimer was capable of being activated by oligonucleotides containing 8-oxo-G and only when they were mismatched with non-complementary nucleotides. Our results are consistent with the notion of overlapping and redundant repair systems for oxidative damage. The overexpression and purification of hMSH2-hMSH6 was performed as previously described (27Gradia S. Acharya S. Fishel R. Cell. 1997; 91: 995-1005Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar), with the exception that PBE chromatography was followed by Mono Q chromatography. Buffers used for this additional step were identical to those used for PBE purification, and hMSH2-hMSH6 eluted from the Mono Q resin at ∼675 mm NaCl. Overexpression and purification of hMSH2-hMSH3 was also performed as previously described (29Wilson T. Guerrette S. Fishel R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21659-21664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) except for the following modifications. The hMSH2-hMSH3 heterodimer was overexpressed in Hi5 insect cells (Invitrogen) and purified as previously described with the exception that an additional Mono Q chromatography step was performed following PBE/heparin-Sepharose (29Wilson T. Guerrette S. Fishel R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21659-21664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). hMSH2-hMSH3 eluted at ∼550 mm NaCl from Mono Q. All single-stranded 41-bp oligonucleotides were synthesized and purified by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography (Midland, TX). Double stranded (ds) DNA substrates used for ATPase and ADP → ATP exchange assays were prepared as follows. Oligonucleotide substrates were annealed in equimolar concentrations in TNE (10 mm Tris, pH 8.1, 1 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl). Residual single-stranded (ss) DNA was purified away from dsDNA using benzoylated naphthoylated DEAE-cellulose (Sigma). DsDNA was then concentrated using a YM-10 microcon centrifugal filter (Amicon Bioseparations). Purified dsDNA substrates were stored at −20 °C in TNE. DsDNA substrates used for IAsys total internal reflectance (TIR) studies were prepared by annealing 20 μg of 3′-biotinylated 41-bp ssDNA oligonucleotides to 60 μg of their respective complimentary non-biotinylated 41-bp ssDNA oligonucleotides. The resultant ds/ss DNA mixture was stored at −20 °C in TNE. TIR using the IAsys Auto Plus system (Affinity Sensors) was done to measure the binding of hMSH2-hMSH6 to DNA substrates. The IASYS Auto Plus microcuvettes (Affinity Sensors) contained reaction cells coated with biotin and were subsequently bound with excess streptavidin (Prozyme). Unbound streptavidin was removed from the cuvette with PBST buffer. 2 μg of the appropriate ds/ss-annealed DNA substrate containing a single 3′-biotin, was added to the streptavidin-coated reaction cells, and excess unbound ssDNA removed with phosphate-buffered saline + 0.05% Tween 20 (PBST). Reaction cells were equilibrated with 50 μl of B-buffer (25 mm Hepes pH 8.1, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol) plus 2% glycerol. Purified recombinant hMSH2-hMSH6 was added to the equilibrated cells to final concentrations of 12.5, 25, 50, 75, 100, 125, 150, or 175 nm. Binding was allowed to continue until the proteins reached equilibrium (saturation) binding with the DNA. Following each experiment, the protein was removed from the chips and the DNA bound to the surface regenerated by washing with 3m NaCl for 2 min. Grafit 4 software (Affinity Sensors) was used to calculate kinetic constants (k association,k dissociation, and K D). ATPase experiments were performed as previously described (24Berardini M. Mazurek A. Fishel R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27851-27857Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The assays were carried out in 20-μl reactions containing B-buffer plus 15% glycerol and 240 nm of the respective 41-bp dsDNA substrate. Unlabeled ATP was added into each reaction for final concentrations of 10, 15, 20, 30, 40, 80, 160, and 250 μm for hMSH2-hMSH6 studies and 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 24, and 32 μm for hMSH2-hMSH3 studies. The final concentration of [γ-32P]ATP for each reaction was fixed at 17 nm. The concentrations of purified recombinant heterodimers were varied (10–50 nm hMSH2-hMSH6 and 10–40 nm hMSH2-hMSH3) in the experiments such that no more than 20% of the total [γ-32P]ATP was hydrolyzed. Assays were carried out for 30 min at 37 °C, stopped with 0.4 ml of 10% (w/v) charcoal, 1 mm EDTA and placed on ice for 30 min. The samples were centrifuged in a table top microcentrifuge at 14,000 × g for 10 min. 100 μl of the supernatant was collected and counted in a RackBeta 1209 liquid scintillation counter (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). The data was then fitted to the Michaelis-Menton equation to generate values for K mand V max (k cat). ADP exchange experiments were performed in 20-μl reactions containing B-buffer plus 15% glycerol, 2.3 μm [3H]ADP, 60 nm of the respective 41-mer dsDNA substrate, and 60 nm of either hMSH2-hMSH3 or hMSH2-hMSH6. Purified recombinant heterodimers were preincubated with [3H]ADP for 15 min at 25 °C. The respective DNA substrate was added and the mixture incubated 5 min at 25 °C. These reactions were then placed on ice. To begin the ADP → ATP exchange, reactions were taken off ice and ATP was added for a final concentration of 25 μm. Each exchange reaction was allowed to proceed at 25 °C until the noted time points. Reactions were stopped by dilution to 4 ml with ice-cold B-buffer minus dithiothreitol and plus 15% glycerol and then immediate vacuum filtered through a prewet nitrocellulose filter (Millipore HAWP02500, 25 mm, 0.45 μm). The filters were washed with 4 ml of ice-cold B-buffer minus dithiothreitol and plus 15% glycerol. Each filter was allowed to dry at room temperature. 3 ml of scintillation fluid (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) was added before counting. ATP was not added to samples used to determine 100% [3H]ADP bound to the heterodimers. Surface mass measurements were performed by examining TIR using IAsys (Affinity Sensors, Franklin, MA). The binding affinities of the hMSH2-hMSH6 heterodimer with dsDNA oligonucleotide substrates were determined for well defined dsDNA sequences (Fig. 1). Unlike surface mass measurements by surface plasmon resonance using Biacore (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.), TIR maintains continuous equilibrium in a closed cuvette that is then displayed as real-time binding isotherms. A closed system reduces the possibility of flow-driven non-equilibrium binding plates that may artificially induce a binding mass. IAsys binding studies with hMSH2-hMSH3 suggested that the affinity of this heterodimer for 8-oxo-G containing DNA was not significantly elevated when compared with homoduplex DNA (data not shown). We observed no significant difference in the equilibrium binding of hMSH2-hMSH3 or hMSH2-hMSH6 to consensus mispair recognition substrates in the absence of adenosine nucleotide or in the presence of ADP (data not shown). In addition, no significant increase in equilibrium binding was observed in the presence of ATP when compared with the homoduplex DNA substrate (data not shown). These results stand in contrast to those of Blackwell et al. (38Blackwell L.J. Bjornson K.P. Allen D.J. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34339-34347Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) and may reflect the equilibrium distinctions between the different detection systems (IAsys/TIR versus Biacore/surface plasmon resonance). Once appropriate dsDNA substrates were bound to the surface of an IAsys cuvette, the binding isotherms at a variety of hMSH2-hMSH6 concentrations were determined (representative isotherms shown in Fig.2). Analysis of this binding isotherm data using Grafit 4 software (Affinity Sensors, Franklin, MA) results in calculated k association,k dissociation, and K D values (Table I). We found the binding of hMSH2-hMSH6 to the 8-oxo-G/A substrate (K D ≈ 78.0 × 10−9m) was roughly 2-fold better than that observed with homoduplex DNA (K D ≈ 146.6 × 10−9m). The binding of hMSH2-hMSH6 to a G/A mismatch (K D ≈ 58.7 × 10−9m) was nearly 2-fold better than to an 8-oxo-G/A mismatch (K D ≈ 78.0 × 10−9m). There was no difference in the binding of homoduplex DNA (G/C) (K D ≈ 146.6 × 10−9m) versus homoduplex DNA containing 8-oxo-G (8-oxo-G/C) (K D ≈ 143.3 × 10−9m). The binding of hMSH2-hMSH6 to DNA substrates containing either a G/T (K D ≈ 5.5 × 10−9m) or G/G (K D ≈ 9.2 × 10−9m) mismatch was significantly greater (∼8-fold) than the binding to the G/A mismatch (K D ≈ 58.7 × 10−9m). This observation supports previous reports suggesting G/T and G/G mismatches are more efficiently repaired than the G/A mismatch by hMSH2-hMSH6 (39Parsons R. Li G.M. Longley M.J. Fang W.H.

There is considerable controversy surrounding the role of the conserved ATPase associated with MutS homologs. Accumulating evidence suggests that the efficiency for repair of an individual mismatch is linked to the mismatch-dependent ATPase activity (31Gradia S. Acharya S. Fishel R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3922-3930Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). We examined the ATPase activity of hMSH2-hMSH3 and hMSH2-hMSH6 in the presence of the DNA substrates containing 8-oxo-G by the Norit method (Fig.3; TableII). No significant stimulation of the hMSH2- hMSH3 ATPase was observed for substrates containing 8-oxo-G (k cat ≈ 1.0–1.3 min−1;K m ≈ 1.1–1.9 × 10−6m; Fig. 3 A; Table II). These observations should be compared with the stimulation of the hMSH2-hMSH3 ATPase by a consensus mispair DNA substrate +(CA) (k cat = 2.7 min−1; K m = 7.6 × 10−6m).Table IIStimulation of hMSH2-hMSH6 and hMSH2-hMSH3 ATPase activity by various DNA substratesDNA Substratek catK mk cat/K mmin−1m × 10−6m−1 min−1 (× 10−4)ahMSH2-hMSH3+(CA)2.7 ± 0.57.6 ± 2.835.0Homoduplex (G/C)1.1 ± 0.11.3 ± 0.384.08-oxo-G/C1.3 ± 0.11.9 ± 0.367.08-oxo-G/A1.0 ± 0.11.1 ± 0.388.08-oxo-G/G1.1 ± 0.11.4 ± 0.580.08-oxo-G/T1.1 ± 0.11.4 ± 0.178.0hMSH2-hMSH6G/T mismatch20.3 ± 2.450.4 ± 13.040.38-Oxo-G/T19.2 ± 1.153.3 ± 7.036.0G/G mismatch17.8 ± 1.451.4 ± 6.134.68-Oxo-G/G17.3 ± 1.948.2 ± 8.835.9G/A mismatch13.8 ± 0.652.2 ± 11.426.48-Oxo-G/A10.2 ± 0.836.2 ± 5.328.2Homoduplex (G/C)6.4 ± 1.229.1 ± 7.122.08-Oxo-G/C4.4 ± 0.418.8 ± 3.323.4Each value represents the mean derived from three independent experiments.2-a The parentheses represent (k cat/Km ) × 10−4.

When an exponentially growing culture of Escherichia coli is shifted from 30 to 15 °C, the cells exhibit a cold-shock response (1Jones P.G. VanBogelen R.A. Neidhardt F.C. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 2092-2095Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). This response is characterized by a transient arrest of cell growth during which a number of genes are induced, in contrast to a severe inhibition of general protein synthesis. Among the cold-shock proteins, the most prominent is CspA. 1Cspcold-shock proteinLBLuria-Bertani brothIPTGisopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranosideCDcircular dichroismEC20elongation complex stalled at position +20SELEXsystematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichmentREreadthrough efficiency 1Cspcold-shock proteinLBLuria-Bertani brothIPTGisopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranosideCDcircular dichroismEC20elongation complex stalled at position +20SELEXsystematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichmentREreadthrough efficiency Other cold-inducible proteins include transcription factor NusA (2Friedman D.I.

Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 3291-3302Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar).In E. coli, there are nine Csp proteins, from CspA through CspI, of which CspA, CspB, CspG, and CspI are cold-shock-inducible. CspC and CspE are constitutively produced at 37 °C, whereas CspD is induced upon nutritional deprivation. The induction patterns of CspF and CspH are not known (for review see Refs. 10Phadtare S. Alsina J. Inouye M. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 1999; 2: 175-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar and 11Phadtare S. Yamanaka K Inouye M. Stoyz G. Hengge-Aronis R. The Cold Shock Response in the Bacterial Stress Responses. ASM Press, Washington D.C.2000: 33-45Google Scholar). CspA homologues are widely distributed in prokaryotes, and CspA is homologous to the cold-shock domain in human Y-box protein YB-1 and the Y-box proteins from other eukaryotes (for review see Refs. 12Wolffe A.P. Bioessays. 1994; 16: 245-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar and13Graumann P.L. Marahiel M.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 286-290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar).None of the CspA homologues appear to be singularly responsible for cold-shock adaptation, because deletions in any one of thecsp genes do not result in cold sensitivity. The double and triple deletion mutations in E. coli csps (ΔcspAΔcspB, ΔcspAΔcspG, ΔcspBΔcspG, ΔcspAΔcspI, or ΔcspAΔcspBΔcspG) did not result in cold sensitivity (14Xia B., Ke, H. Inouye M. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 40: 179-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). In a triple deletion strain of ΔcspAΔcspBΔcspG, CspE accumulated at low temperatures, suggesting that members of the CspA family may functionally substitute for each other during cold acclimation of cells (14Xia B., Ke, H. Inouye M. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 40: 179-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar).In addition to their apparent, but poorly understood role during cold-shock response, many cellular processes appear to respond to changes in Csp protein concentrations even at higher temperature. InE. coli, the presence of camphor leads to chromosome decondensation. Overproduction of CspE led to camphor resistance and chromosome condensation (15Hu K.H. Liu E. Dean K. Gingras M. DeGraff W. Trun N.J. Genetics. 1996; 143: 1521-1532Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). CspC and CspE were also shown to be involved in the regulation of the expression of rpoS, a gene encoding a global stress response regulator, and uspA, a gene encoding a protein that is induced by numerous stresses (16Phadtare S. Inouye M. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 1205-1214Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar).In vitro, CspA binds to RNA with a low sequence specificity and a low binding affinity (17Jiang W. Hou Y. Inouye M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 196-202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). CspB, CspC, and CspE are able to more selectively bind RNA and single-strand DNA (18Phadtare S. Inouye M. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 33: 1004-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Binding of CspA to RNA destabilizes RNA secondary structures and, hence, it presumably facilitates translation at low temperatures (17Jiang W. Hou Y. Inouye M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 196-202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). Hanna and Liu (19Hanna M.M. Liu K. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 282: 227-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) demonstrated the interaction between CspE with the nascent RNA in transcription elongation complexes, suggesting that this protein is involved in transcription regulation. They also found that purified CspE interfered with Q-mediated transcription antitermination. It has also been shown that CspA, CspE, and CspC decreased transcription termination at several intrinsic terminators and also affected transcription pausing (20Bae W. Xia B. Inouye M. Severinov K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7784-7789Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). Recently, it was found that purified CspE impedes poly(A)-mediated 3′- to 5′-exonucleolytic decay by polynucleotide phosphorylase by interfering with its digestion through the poly(A) tail and inhibits both internal cleavage and poly(A) tail removal by RNase E (21Feng Y. Huang H. Liao J. Cohen S.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31651-31656Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar).The relevance, if any, of all of these biochemical functions of CspA homologues to their physiological function is not known. In the present paper, we explored the physiological relevance of transcription antitermination activity of CspE by mutational analysis of a clonedcspE gene. We show that a mutation of an evolutionarily conserved histidine residue, His32, which resides within RNP2, a putative RNA-binding site of CspE, abolishes transcription antitermination in vivo and in vitro. The mutation leaves the RNA-binding activity of CspE unaffected but abolishes the nucleic acid-melting activity of CspE. The mutant CspE overexpression does not complement the cold sensitivity of the ΔcspAΔcspBΔcspGΔcspEquadruple deletion but is able to up-regulate rpoSexpression in the stationary phase. Thus, our results provide further evidence that (i) CspE, like other known transcription antitermination factors, targets the secondary structure elements in the nascent RNA, and (ii) transcription antitermination activity of CspE is correlated with its prototypical in vivo function during cold-shock acclimation.DISCUSSIONDespite the extensive research on CspA and its homologues, it is not known exactly how these proteins help the cold acclimation of cells. At low temperatures, the secondary structures of RNA stabilize, which should slow down transcription elongation and ribosomal movement on RNA. Csps, acting like “RNA chaperones” could destabilize the secondary structures in RNA and thus facilitate transcription and translation (17Jiang W. Hou Y. Inouye M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 196-202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). In this paper we show that a CspE mutant selected for its inability to antiterminate transcription at high temperature is unable to complement cold sensitivity of quadruple cspdeletion. In vitro, the mutant CspE protein binds RNA normally but is defective in destabilizing nucleic acid secondary structures. Thus, the RNA-chaperoning activity of CspE is essential for transcription antitermination function of the protein. Previously, we had shown that, in addition to reducing the efficiency of transcription termination on ρ-independent terminators, Csps reduce hairpin-induced transcription pausing. Taken together, the data demonstrate that CspE affects transcription termination by preventing the formation of the nascent RNA secondary structures, most likely the formation of the stem-loop structure at the terminator. Thus, the mechanism of Csp-induced antitermination appears to be similar to the recently deduced mechanism of transcription antitermination by λ N protein (29Gusarov I. Nudler E. Cell. 2001; 107: 437-449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar).Previously we showed that (i) Csp proteins can act as transcription antiterminators in vivo and in vitro; (ii) at cold-shock, expression of promoter distal genes of themetY-rpsO operon, nusA,infB, rbfA, and pnp, is increased; and (iii) Csp overproduction causes similar increase in promoter distalmetY-rpsO operon gene expression even at high temperature (20Bae W. Xia B. Inouye M. Severinov K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7784-7789Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). This result provided the first evidence that transcription antitermination function of cold-shock-induced Csps is relevant, because the products of nusA, infB,rbfA, and pnp, which are NusA, IF2, RbfA, and PNP, respectively, are known to be induced at cold-shock and presumably enable the cells to adapt to low temperature. Our current results demonstrate that RNA-melting function of Csps is necessary for cellular adaptation to cold and are consistent with the idea that transcription antitermination function of Csps is linked to their cold-shock function. On the other hand, another function of CspE, its ability to up-regulate the rpoS gene expression, is unaffected by termination-altering mutations and is probably dependent only on its RNA-binding activity.The three-dimensional structure of CspA from E. coli has been resolved by x-ray crystallography and NMR analysis (30Feng W. Tejero R. Zimmerman D.E. Inouye M. Montelione G.T. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10881-10896Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 31Newkirk K. Feng W. Jiang W. Tejero R. Emerson S.D. Inouye M.

A. 1994; 91: 5119-5123Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). The structure consists of five antiparallel β-strands, β1 through β5, forming a β-barrel structure with two β-sheets. The two evolutionarily conserved RNA-binding motifs of CspA, RNP1 and RNP2, are located on the β2 and β3 strands. RNP1 Phe18 and Phe20 and RNP2 Phe31 and His33 form a compact surface-exposed site on the CspA three-dimensional structure. These residues are presumably involved in intercalation between the bases of a nucleic acid target. Mutational analysis of E. coli CspA showed that single substitutions of Phe residues at positions 18, 20, and 31 by either Leu or Ser residues decreased DNA binding (33Hillier B.J. Rodriguez H.M. Gregoret L.M. Fold Des. 1998; 3: 87-93Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, in the case of CspB from Bacillus subtilis, which is a homologue of E. coli CspA, substitution of Phe residues at positions 15, 17, and 27 by Ala and substitution of His at position 29 by Gln also abolished nucleic acid binding (34Schroder K. Graumann P. Schnuchel A. Holak T.A. Marahiel M.A. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 16: 699-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Here, we show that substitution of E. coliCspE His32, which corresponds to E. coli CspA His33 and B. subtilis CspB His29, for Arg does not affect the RNA-binding activity, probably because Arg is capable of favorable electrostatic interaction with nucleic acids (34Schroder K. Graumann P. Schnuchel A. Holak T.A. Marahiel M.A. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 16: 699-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The loss of the RNA-melting activity in H32R CspE mutant may be due to the difference in the side chains of His and Arg, because the imidazole ring of His is capable of intercalation between nucleic acid bases, whereas the guanidine group of Arg is not. According to this view then, in the wild-type CspE, His32 could participate in the initiation of nucleic acid secondary structure melting, which is further propagated by subsequent intercalation of Phe18, Phe20, and Phe31. Our ongoing site-specific mutational analysis of cspE and integrated biophysical, biochemical, and physiological analyses of CspE mutants should clarify this issue. When an exponentially growing culture of Escherichia coli is shifted from 30 to 15 °C, the cells exhibit a cold-shock response (1Jones P.G. VanBogelen R.A. Neidhardt F.C. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 2092-2095Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). This response is characterized by a transient arrest of cell growth during which a number of genes are induced, in contrast to a severe inhibition of general protein synthesis. Among the cold-shock proteins, the most prominent is CspA. 1Cspcold-shock proteinLBLuria-Bertani brothIPTGisopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranosideCDcircular dichroismEC20elongation complex stalled at position +20SELEXsystematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichmentREreadthrough efficiency 1Cspcold-shock proteinLBLuria-Bertani brothIPTGisopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranosideCDcircular dichroismEC20elongation complex stalled at position +20SELEXsystematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichmentREreadthrough efficiency Other cold-inducible proteins include transcription factor NusA (2Friedman D.I.

CspC and CspE are constitutively produced at 37 °C, whereas CspD is induced upon nutritional deprivation. The induction patterns of CspF and CspH are not known (for review see Refs. 10Phadtare S. Alsina J. Inouye M. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 1999; 2: 175-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar and 11Phadtare S. Yamanaka K Inouye M. Stoyz G. Hengge-Aronis R. The Cold Shock Response in the Bacterial Stress Responses. ASM Press, Washington D.C.2000: 33-45Google Scholar). CspA homologues are widely distributed in prokaryotes, and CspA is homologous to the cold-shock domain in human Y-box protein YB-1 and the Y-box proteins from other eukaryotes (for review see Refs. 12Wolffe A.P. Bioessays. 1994; 16: 245-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar and13Graumann P.L. Marahiel M.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 286-290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). None of the CspA homologues appear to be singularly responsible for cold-shock adaptation, because deletions in any one of thecsp genes do not result in cold sensitivity. The double and triple deletion mutations in E. coli csps (ΔcspAΔcspB, ΔcspAΔcspG, ΔcspBΔcspG, ΔcspAΔcspI, or ΔcspAΔcspBΔcspG) did not result in cold sensitivity (14Xia B., Ke, H. Inouye M. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 40: 179-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). In a triple deletion strain of ΔcspAΔcspBΔcspG, CspE accumulated at low temperatures, suggesting that members of the CspA family may functionally substitute for each other during cold acclimation of cells (14Xia B., Ke, H. Inouye M. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 40: 179-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). In addition to their apparent, but poorly understood role during cold-shock response, many cellular processes appear to respond to changes in Csp protein concentrations even at higher temperature. InE. coli, the presence of camphor leads to chromosome decondensation. Overproduction of CspE led to camphor resistance and chromosome condensation (15Hu K.H. Liu E. Dean K. Gingras M. DeGraff W. Trun N.J. Genetics. 1996; 143: 1521-1532Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).

A mutation in Cacna2d2, the gene encoding the α2δ-2 voltage-dependent calcium channel accessory subunit, has been found to underlie the ducky phenotype. The α2δ-2 mRNA is strongly expressed in cerebellar Purkinje cells. We show that du/du mice have abnormalities in their Purkinje cell dendritic tree. The mutation in α2δ-2 results in the introduction of a premature stop codon and predicts the expression of a truncated protein encoded by the first three exons of Cacna2d2, followed by 8 novel amino acids. We show that both mRNA and protein corresponding to this predicted transcript are expressed indu/du cerebellum and present in Purkinje cells. Whereas the α2δ-2 subunit increased the peak current density of the CaV2.1/β4 channel combination when co-expressed in vitro, co-expression with the truncated mutant α2δ-2 protein reduced current density, indicating that it may contribute to the du phenotype.

Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 521-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (1952) Google Scholar). Each CaV channel is composed of a pore-forming α1 subunit, associated at least in the case of the CaV1 and -2 subfamilies with an intracellular β subunit responsible for trafficking (2Walker D. De Waard M. Trends Neurosci. 1998; 21: 148-154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar) and a membrane-anchored, but predominantly extracellular, α2δ subunit, whose function is less well defined (2Walker D. De Waard M. Trends Neurosci. 1998; 21: 148-154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). CaV1.1 (α1S) is also associated with a γ subunit (γ1), and this may be true for other CaV channels (3Letts V.A. Felix R. Biddlecome G.H. Arikkath J. Mahaffey C.L. Valenzuela A. Bartlett F.S. Mori Y. Campbell K.P. Frankel W.N. Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 340-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar), although the neuronal γ subunits may also subserve other functions (4Chen L. Chetkovich D.M.

The α1subunit determines the main biophysical properties of the channel and is modulated by the other subunits (2Walker D. De Waard M.

Mammalian genes encoding 10 α1, 4 β, 8 γ, and 3 α2δ subunits have been identified (1Catterall W.A. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev.

A number of spontaneous autosomal recessive mutant mouse strains have now been identified, involving mutations in each of the four different subunits that together compose a voltage-dependent calcium channel. They all have a similar phenotype that includes cerebellar ataxia and spike-wave seizures. Tottering (Cacna1a tg) has a point mutation in CaV2.1 (α1A) (7Fletcher C.F. Lutz C.M. O'Sullivan T.N.

Cell. 1996; 87: 607-617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar), and a number of alleles of this mutant have now been identified, as summarized recently (8Zwingman T.A. Neumann P.E. Noebels J.L. Herrup K. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 1169-1178Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Lethargic (Cacnb4 lh) represents a truncation mutation of the β4 subunit (9Burgess D.L. Jones J.M. Meisler M.H. Noebels J.L. Cell. 1997; 88: 385-392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). Stargazer (Cacng2 stg) has a truncation mutation in the γ2 subunit (3Letts V.A.

Finally, the two ducky alleles (Cacna2d2 du andCacna2d2 du2j) both predict truncation mutations in the α2δ-2 subunit (12Barclay J. Balaguero N. Mione M. Ackerman S.L. Letts V.A. Brodbeck J. Canti C. Meir A. Page K.M. Kusumi K. PerezReyes E. Lander E.S. Frankel W.N. Gardiner R.M. Dolphin A.C. Rees M. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 6095-6104Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Homozygotes for the ducky (du) allele are characterized by ataxia and paroxysmal dyskinesia (13Snell G.D. J. Hered. 1955; 46: 27-29Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The cerebellum is reduced in size (14Meier H. Acta Neuropathol. (Berl.). 1968; 11: 15-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), but we have previously found no loss of Purkinje cell (PC) bodies at postnatal day (P) 21 (12). In this study we observed a reduction in calcium channel current in P21 PCs isolated fromdu/du compared with +/+ cerebella (12Barclay J. Balaguero N. Mione M. Ackerman S.L. Letts V.A. Brodbeck J. Canti C. Meir A. Page K.M. Kusumi K. PerezReyes E. Lander E.S. Frankel W.N. Gardiner R.M. Dolphin A.C. Rees M. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 6095-6104Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The present study provides evidence that the du mutation results in the persistence of PCs with an immature and grossly abnormal morphology, including multiple primary dendrites and a reduction in the size of the PC dendritic tree. This is associated with loss of full-length α2δ-2 protein and expression of a truncated mutant α2δ-2 protein with aberrant function. The dumutant 1 construct (du-mut1 α2) was assembled by PCR (Platinum Pfx polymerase; Invitrogen) ofdu/du total brain cDNA using primers corresponding to the cDNA sequence (GenBankTMAF247140) containing engineered SmaI or SpeI restriction sites. The primer sequences are as follows: F, 5′- TTG(CCCGGG)GAACATGGCGGTGCCCGGCT-3′, and R, 5′- TCT(CAGGTC)AGAGTAACCAGAGACCAA-3′, with the recognition sites indicated in parentheses. The PCR product was digested with SmaI andSpeI and ligated into the corresponding sites of a modified pMT2 vector (Genetics Institute, Cambridge, MA). Insert sequence fidelity was determined by automated sequencing (PE Biosystems, Warrington, UK). Mice were obtained from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME), and a colony was established, as described previously (12Barclay J. Balaguero N. Mione M. Ackerman S.L. Letts V.A. Brodbeck J. Canti C. Meir A. Page K.M. Kusumi K. PerezReyes E. Lander E.S. Frankel W.N. Gardiner R.M. Dolphin A.C. Rees M. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 6095-6104Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). RNA was extracted from samples of mouse brain tissue using RNeasy Mini Kit and QIAshredder (Qiagen Ltd., Crawley, West Sussex, UK). RNA was reverse-transcribed using Moloney murine leukemia virus-reverse transcriptase (Promega, Southampton, UK) with 0.6 units·ml−1 RNasin Ribonuclease Inhibitor (Promega) and 25 ng·μl−1 Random Hexamers (Promega). PCRs were carried out with primers 49F, 5′-ACGCCCGCTCTTGCTCTTGCT-3′, and 11R, 5′-CCTCCAAAAATCCGCATCAC-3′, which produce a 156-bp product from both the wild-type and du alleles of the Cacna2d2transcript. Primers 49F and 50R, 5′-TCAGCCTTGGCATCGTAGTA-3′, produce a 387-bp product from the wild-type allele only. Primers 20F, 5′-GCCGCATCTTGAATGGAAAC-3′, and 86R, 5′-CAGAGACCAATGAGACTGGA-3′, produce a 456-bp product from the du allele only. DNA was extracted by incubating 2 mm of tail-snip tissue in 75 μl of 25 mm NaOH, 0.2 mm Na2EDTA at 95 °C for 30 min followed by cooling to 4 °C and addition of 75 μl of 40 mm Tris-HCl. 5 μl of the resultant solution was amplified in the PCRs. Primers 98F, 5′-ACCTATCAGGCAAAAGGACG-3′, and 120R, 5′-AGGGATGGTGATTGGTTGGA-3′, produce a fragment of 541 bp from a region that is duplicated in the du allele. Digestion withBspHI results in two fragments of 286 and 273 bp from thedu allele, whereas the wild-type allele remains uncut. Wild-type mice can be identified by the presence of a single band upon agarose gel electrophoresis. Heterozygous and du/du mice each show two bands and can by distinguished on the basis of their relative intensities. P21-P26 mice were asphyxiated with CO2, and the cerebella were sliced parasagitally at 400 μm in artificial cerebrospinal fluid (in mm: 125 NaCl, 25 NaHCO3, 25 glucose, 2.5 KCl, 1.25 NaH2PO4, 2 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, saturated with 95% O2/5% CO2 at 4 °C) using a vibratome (Campden Instruments, London, UK). Dendrites and somata of PCs were visualized by infrared differential interference contrast video microscopy (15Stuart G.J. Dodt H.U. Sakmann B. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1993; 423: 511-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar). Glass microelectrodes (outer tip diameter 0.3 μm) were filled with an aqueous solution of 10% lucifer yellow lithium salt (Sigma) and 10% neurobiotin (Vector Laboratories Inc., Burlingame, CA), and backfilled with 1 m LiCl. Dye was injected iontophoretically into PC somata, by alternating the current repeatedly from −40 to +40 nA over 5 min. The tissue slices were then fixed for 1 h in 4% paraformaldehyde, stained for neurobiotin with Texas Red-coupled streptavidin (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR, 25 μg·ml−1for 1 h), and viewed by confocal microcopy. Four cells of two genotypes (+/+ and du/du) were scanned using identical parameters. Selected fields were optically sectioned using 1-μm steps. The entire z series was projected as a single composite image by superimposition. The final image was thresholded to form a binary image for analysis by NIH Image J software version 1.62. Following formation of the skeleton, the dendritic tree was contained in a minimal rectangle, and the number of dendrites were counted crossing a horizontal and diagonal line. Branch points were determined from the soma to the end of the three longest dendrites for each cell. P24 mice were asphyxiated with CO2, and their brains were removed from the cranium, immediately immersed in 20 ml of fixative (34 mmK2Cr2O7, 37 mmHgCl2, and 23 mmK2CrO4), and left undisturbed for 12 weeks in the dark at 4 °C. Vibratome sections (100 μm) were developed for 20 min in a 5% Na2SO3 solution, before being mounted on microscope slides and coverslipped with Vectashield (Vector Laboratories). Slides were viewed on a Leica microscope using 64× magnification. Image sections were grabbed through an attached CCD camera, using Vision Explorer software (Alliance Vision, Mirmande, France), enabling the deconvolution and projection of different optical planes. Mice (aged P21 to P24) were anesthetized by CO2 inhalation or pentobarbitone injection (200 mg·kg−1, intraperitoneal) and perfused intracardially with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The brain was placed in 4% paraformaldehyde at 4 °C for 3 h and then transferred into 30% sucrose overnight, before embedding in Cry-M-Bed (Bright Instrument Ltd., Huntingdon, UK) and sectioning. Alternatively, the brain was removed without fixation and frozen in liquid nitrogen. 10–25-μm cryostat sections were cut and air-dried onto positively charged slides (Merck). A cDNA fragment corresponding to Cacna2d2 5′ (nucleotides 206–620, using the numbering system from GenBankTM accession number AF247139) was subcloned into pBluescript SK+ (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Sense and antisense RNA probes were prepared using T3 or T7 polymerase and digoxigenin RNA labeling mix and purified using Quickspin columns (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). In situ hybridization was carried out as described (16Eisenstat D.D. Liu J.K. Mione M. Zhong W.M. Yu G.Y. Anderson S.A. Ghattas I. Puelles L. Rubenstein J.L.R. J. Comp. Neurol. 1999; 414: 217-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Two polyclonal antipeptide antibodies were raised in rabbits to amino acids 16–29 and 102–117 of α2δ-2. Neither of the peptides used as antigens showed any homology with other protein sequences in the data base. They were purified by affinity chromatography using the immobilized synthetic peptide and stored at 0.5 mg·ml−1in PBS, pH 7.2, at −20 °C. For immunohistochemistry of α2δ-2, 25-μm sections were incubated overnight with primary antibody at 4 °C (1.25 μg·ml−1). This was followed by a biotinylated anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody (Sigma, 7.2 μg·ml−1) and a Texas Red-streptavidin conjugate (2 μg·ml−1). Some tissue sections or cells were also incubated for 1 min with the nuclear dye 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI, 300 nm, Molecular Probes). They were examined by laser scanning confocal microscopy, using 1-μm optical sections. For peptide controls the appropriately diluted antibody was incubated for 1 h at 37 °C with a 10× higher concentration (w/v) of the immunizing peptide, before applying it to sections. Transfection was performed with GenePORTER transfection reagent (Gene Therapy Systems, San Diego, CA). Cells were plated onto coverslips or dishes, 2–3 h prior to transfection. The DNA and GenePORTER reagent (6 μg and 30 μl, respectively) were each diluted in 500 μl of serum-free medium, mixed, and applied to the cells. After 3.5 h, 1 ml of medium containing 20% serum was added to the cells, which were then incubated at 37 °C for 3–4 days. For electrophysiological recordings, cells were re-plated 1–6 h prior to use. The method used is essentially as described previously (17Brice N.L. Berrow N.S. Campbell V. Page K.M. Brickley K. Tedder I. Dolphin A.C. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1997; 9: 749-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 min at room temperature. For permeabilization, cells were incubated twice for 7 min in a 0.02% solution of Triton X-100 in Tris-buffered saline; otherwise, cells were washed twice with Tris-buffered saline for the same period. The primary antibodies were used at 1.25 μg·ml−1. The biotinylated anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody (7.2 μg·ml−1) was then incubated for 2 h at 4 °C, followed by streptavidin-Texas Red (2 μg·ml−1). Cells were then incubated for 1 min with DAPI (300 nm). COS-7 cells were transfected with either α2δ-2 or du-mut1 α2 as described above. On day 4 post-transfection, the cells were resuspended in detergent-free Buffer A. Samples (2 mg of total protein) were then solubilized in Buffer A containing 1% CHAPS for immunoaffinity purification of α2δ-2 as described below. Cerebella, stored at −80 °C, were thawed in ice-cold Buffer A (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mmEDTA, and protease inhibitors (Complete EDTA-free, Roche Molecular Biochemicals, 1 tablet/50 ml buffer)), plus 150 mm sucrose. The tissue was homogenized, and the homogenate was centrifuged at 5000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The resultant supernatant was diluted 4 times with Buffer A, prior to detergent treatment. The protein concentration of samples was determined using either the bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay (Perbio, Tattenhall, UK) in the presence of 0.5% SDS, or where the samples were in SDS-PAGE buffer, by a modified filter paper dye-binding assay (18Macart M. Gerbaut L. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1982; 122: 93-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Affinity-purified Ab(16–29) or Ab(102–117) (2 mg) was covalently coupled to a 1-ml column of Sepharose-NHS (Amersham Biosciences) according to manufacturer's instructions. The efficiency of coupling was assessed by SDS-PAGE. The columns were pre-washed with 200 mm glycine HCl, pH 2.4, and neutralized before first use to ensure complete removal of any residual unbound IgG. Control columns contained 2 mg of protein A-Sepharose-isolated IgG from the corresponding pre-immune rabbit sera. COS-7 cells transfected with either α2δ-2 or du-mut1 α2 (2 mg of total protein) or cerebellar homogenate (+/+ ordu/du, 6–20 mg of total protein) were solubilized in Buffer A (see above) containing 1% (w/v) CHAPS and placed on ice for 30 min following sonication 3 times for 10 s. The detergent extracts were cleared by centrifugation (48,000 ×g, 20 min, 4 °C) and then applied to the relevant antibody or control IgG columns that had been pre-equilibrated with Buffer A containing 0.5% CHAPS. The lysates were recirculated through the columns using two opposing syringes for 60 min at 4 °C. Unbound material was washed from the columns in Buffer A containing 0.5% CHAPS and then Buffer A + 0.1% CHAPS. Bound proteins were eluted with 200 mm glycine HCl, pH 2.4, and then concentrated for SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis by precipitation with 10% trichloroacetic acid followed by centrifugation (30,000 × g, 30 min, 4 °C). Samples of the precipitated proteins were separated on either 10 or 4–20% gradient gels under reducing conditions and then electrophoretically transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes for immunodetection. The polyvinylidene difluoride membranes were blocked with 3% BSA for 3 h at 55 °C and incubated overnight with a 1:1000 dilution of either Ab(16–29) or Ab(102–117) followed by a 1:1000 dilution of goat anti-rabbit IgG-horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Bio-Rad) for 1 h at 20 °C and detected using ECL (Amersham Biosciences). The antibody and control IgG columns were neutralized and washed with 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1m NaCl, and 0.02% sodium azide and stored in PBS, pH 7.2, with 0.02% sodium azide at 4 °C. GenBankTM accession numbers of cDNAs are given in parentheses. Calcium channel expression in COS-7 cells was investigated by whole cell patch clamp recording, essentially as described previously (19Berrow N.S. Brice N.L. Tedder I. Page K. Dolphin A.C. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1997; 9: 739-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), by transfection of rat CaV 2.1 (M64373) E1686R (20Hans M. Urrutia A. Deal C. Brust P.F. Stauderman K. Ellis S.B. Harpold M.M.

Genome. 2000; 11: 1142-1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), in conjunction with rat β4 (LO2315) and mouse α2δ-2 (AF247139, common brain splice variant, lacking exon 23 and 6 bp of exon 38 (21)) or du-mut1 α2 (AF247140) cDNAs cloned into the pMT2 vector. The cDNA for green fluorescent protein (mut3 GFP) (22Cormack B.P. Valdivia R.H. Falkow S. Gene (Amst.). 1996; 173: 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (2517) Google Scholar) was included in the transfection to identify transfected cells from which recordings were made. Transfection was performed as described above, using the ratios for α1, β, α2δ, and GFP of 3:1:1:0.1. In the single channel experiments cDNA for β-adrenergic receptor kinase 1 (β-ARK1), Gβγ binding domain was included in the transfections, at the same concentration as the β subunit cDNA (23Meir A. Bell D.C. Stephens G.J. Page K.M. Dolphin A.C. Biophys. J. 2000; 79: 731-746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). For expression inXenopus oocytes, cDNAs encoding rabbit CaV2.1 (X57689), rat β4 and mouse α2δ-2 ordu-mut1 α2 cDNAs were injected intranuclearly as described previously (24Canti C. Page K.M. Stephens G.J. Dolphin A.C. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 6855-6864Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), except that 4 nl of the 1:1:1 ratio cDNA mixture was injected at 1 μg·μl−1. In control experiments where α2δ-2 was omitted, the ratio was made up with buffer. Recordings were made using two-electrode voltage clamp as described previously (24Canti C. Page K.M. Stephens G.J. Dolphin A.C. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 6855-6864Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), using 10 mm Ba2+ as charge carrier. Individual I–V relationships were fitted with a modified Boltzmann Equation 1, I=Gmax(V−Vrev)/(1+exp(−(V−V50)/k))Equation 1 where G max is the maximum conductance;V rev is the reversal potential; k is the slope factor; and V 50 is the voltage for 50% current activation. All recordings were taken from cell-attached patches on GFP-positive cells at room temperature (20–22 °C). Recording pipettes were pulled from borosilicate tubes (World Precision Instruments, Inc., Sarasota, FL), coated with Sylgard (Sylgard 184, Corning Glass), and fire-polished to form high resistance pipettes (∼10 megohms with 100 mmBaCl2). The bath solution, designed to zero the resting membrane potential (25Meir A. Dolphin A.C. Neuron. 1998; 20: 341-351Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), was composed of (in mm) 135 potassium aspartate, 1 MgCl2, 5 EGTA, and 10 HEPES (titrated with KOH, pH 7.3), and patch pipettes were filled with a solution of the following composition (in mm): 100 BaCl2, 10 tetraethylammonium-Cl, 10 HEPES, 200 nm tetrodotoxin, titrated with tetraethylammonium-OH to pH 7.4. Both solutions were adjusted to an osmolarity of 320 mosmol with sucrose. Data were sampled (Axopatch 200B and Digidata 1200 interface, Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA) at 20 kHz and filtered on-line at 1–2 kHz. Voltages were not corrected for liquid junction potential (26Neher E. Sakmann B. Neher E. Single-channel Recording. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1995: 147-153Crossref Google Scholar), measured to be −15 mV in these solutions, in order to be able to compare the results to other published material. Leak subtraction was performed by averaging segments of traces with no activity from the same voltage protocol in the same experiment and subtracting this average from each episode using pClamp6 (Axon Instruments). Statistical analysis was performed using paired or unpaired Student's ttest. For the single channel analysis, patches were only used in which three or fewer overlapping openings were detected. With an open probability of about 0.5 at +40 mV and at least 20 consecutive stimulations, the number of detectable multiple openings was considered to represent the number of channels active in these patches. Event detection was carried out using the half-amplitude threshold method. Single channel amplitude was determined by a Gaussian fit to the binned amplitude distributions. Mean open and closed times were determined as a single or double exponential fitted to open time distributions. Open time distributions were only collected in episodes or parts of episodes with no overlapping openings. For closed time distributions, we used either single channel patches or segments toward the end of episodes in which only one channel remains active and no further overlaps occur. Data are expressed as mean ± S.E. For steady-state inactivation, all the available patches were considered, and each was normalized to its peak current response during the prepulse to +40 mV. Latency to first opening was measured in 2-ms bins. First latency (FL) histograms from each experiment were divided by the number of episodes collected, and the plots were then accumulated and divided by the number of stimulations, to express the data as the FL probability (23Meir A. Bell D.C. Stephens G.J. Page K.M. Dolphin A.C. Biophys. J. 2000; 79: 731-746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 27Imredy J.P. Yue D.T. Neuron. 1994; 12: 1301-1318Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Two- and three-channel patches were also corrected for the apparent number of channels in the patch, according to Equation 2, FL1=1−(1−FLN) (1/N)Equation 2 FL1 and FLN are the single channel and multichannel cumulative first latency functions, respectively, andN is the apparent number of channels. The du/du cerebellum exhibits normal foliation and laminar structure. There are no gaps in the PC layer, and their perikarya form a single row. The thickness of each layer is reduced in du/du compared with wild-type littermates as described previously (12Barclay J. Balaguero N. Mione M. Ackerman S.L. Letts V.A. Brodbeck J. Canti C. Meir A.

Two techniques were used to compare the morphology of cerebellar PCs between the different genotypes in more detail as follows: first, classical Golgi impregnation, and second, microinjection of PC somata with Lucifer Yellow and neurobiotin. Both methods revealed a changed PC cytoarchitecture in homozygous du/ducerebella at P21–26, which was the latest period in which morphology could be studied, given that the du/du mice die by P35. In the Golgi-impregnated cerebella, PCs were examined in detail in multiple cerebellar sections from one +/+ and sixdu/du mice. Atypical initial lateral extensions of the primary dendrite were seen indu/du but not in +/+ PCs (compare +/+ in Fig. 1 A todu/du in Fig. 1, B,C, and F). The primary dendrites may then bend apically in a delayed targeting of the pial surface, which they frequently fail to reach (e.g. Fig. 1, B and C). Thickened tertiary branchlets were found to bend downwards in somedu/du PCs, giving a “weeping willow” appearance (Fig. 1 B,closed arrowhead). Additionally, PC somata are frequently multipolar, exhibiting up to three primary dendrites (Fig. 1, D–F), which, in the cells shown in Fig. 1, E and F, extend laterally rather than targeting the pial surface. Similar results were obtained with the cell-filling technique, for which 4 +/+ and 4 du/du PCs were examined in detail. The du/du PCs displayed a dendritic arbor that was significantly less complex, reduced in size, and frequently did not reach the border of the molecular layer (compare the typical +/+ PC in Fig. 2 A with three du/du PCs shown in Fig.2 B). Additionally, the shafts of the main and secondary dendritic branches of du/du PCs were often thickened (Fig. 2 B). In one du/duPC, the dendrites drooped down toward the granule cell layer giving a weeping willow appearance (Fig. 2 B,top right panel), similar to that seen in some of the Golgi-impregnateddu/du PCs (Fig. 1 B). Following formation of the skeleton of the dendritic trees (Fig.2 C), the numbers of dendrites were found to be reduced indu/du PCs (Fig. 2 D,left panel), and the total length of the dendritic tree was also reduced (Fig. 2 D,center panel). However, the number of branch points on the longest dendrites was unchanged (Fig. 2 D,right panel). We have shown previously, byin situ hybridization using a 3′ antisense probe, that no full-length transcript for Cacna2d2 is present indu/du cerebellum, whereas a strong signal was obtained in +/+ cerebellar PCs (12Barclay J. Balaguero N. Mione M. Ackerman S.L. Letts V.A. Brodbeck J. Canti C. Meir A. Page K.M. Kusumi K. PerezReyes E. Lander E.S. Frankel W.N. Gardiner R.M. Dolphin A.C. Rees M. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 6095-6104Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study we performed in situ hybridization with a 5′Cacna2d2 antisense RNA probe to examine whether a truncated message was present in du/du PCs. This confirmed the presence of full-length transcript forCacna2d2 in +/+ PCs (Fig.3 A). The data would also not be inconsistent with the additional presence of transcript in small Bergmann glial cell bodies (Fig. 3 A, arrows, see also Fig.8). The results also demonstrate a low level of message hybridizing to the 5′ probe in du/du PCs (Fig.3 B, compared with Fig. 3 A). This, together with the absence of full-length transcript indu/du PCs shown in our previous study (12Barclay J. Balaguero N. Mione M. Ackerman S.L. Letts V.A. Brodbeck J. Canti C. Meir A. Page K.M.

Using embryonic day 17 fetal rat cortical neurons and p75NTR-expressing NIH-3T3 cells, we now show that p75NTR exists as a trimer as well as a monomer. Furthermore, we have reported and others have confirmed that amyloid β binds p75NTR, and that this binding leads to apoptotic cell death. We now report that amyloid β binds to trimers of p75NTR as well as to p75NTR monomers but not to the p140trkA, the nerve growth factor co-receptor that mediates neuronal survival. Furthermore, amyloid β activates p75NTR, strongly inducing the transcription of c-Jun mRNA and stimulating the stress-activated c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase, as measured by phosphorylation of its substrate (glutathione S-transferase-c-Jun-(1–79)). Our data suggest that p75NTR may be present as a preformed trimer that binds amyloid β to induce receptor activation, and support the hypothesis that p75NTR activation by amyloid β is causally related to Alzheimer's disease. p75NTR, a nerve growth factor co-receptor that has been implicated in apoptosis of neurons, is structurally related to Fas and the receptors for tumor necrosis factor-α that display ligand independent assembly into trimers.

Science. 1996; 272: 506-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). p75NTR is one of the two transmembrane receptors for nerve growth factor (NGF) and other neurotrophins (2Kaplan D.R. Miller F.D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 213-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar). In addition to p75NTR, NGF binds a receptor of the trk family (p140trkA) and p75NTR can interact with p140trkA, forming a complex (reviewed in Refs. 3Weisman C. de Vos A.M. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2001; 58: 748-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar and 4Yano H. Chao M.V. Pharm. Acta Helv. 2000; 74: 253-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) to modulate NGF actions, many of which involve signaling through p140trkA (2Kaplan D.R. Miller F.D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 213-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar). However, when p75NTR is expressed in the absence of trk receptors or in the presence of low trk receptor levels, neurotrophin binding to p75NTR alone can induce homodimer formation (5Neiderhauser O. Mangold M. Schubenel R. Kusznir E.A. Schmidt D. Hertel C. J. Neurosci. Res. 2000; 61: 263-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) and signal cellular apoptosis (2Kaplan D.R. Miller F.D. Curr.

Nature. 1996; 383: 716-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar). It thus appears that activation of p75NTR alone, like activation of other members of this superfamily, may induce cellular apoptosis. We have reported (8Yaar M. Zhai S. Pilch P.F. Doyle S.M. Eisenhauer P.B. Fine R.E. Gilchrest B.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 2333-2340Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar) and others have confirmed (9Kuner P. Schubenel R. Hertel C. J. Neurosci. Res. 1998; 54: 798-804Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that amyloid-β (Aβ), a molecule implicated in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) (10Martin J.B. N. Engl. J. Med. 1999; 25: 1970-1980Crossref Scopus (335) Google Scholar), specifically binds p75NTRwith an affinity close to that for neurotrophins and induces apoptosis of neurons and 3T3 cells engineered to constitutively express p75NTR, but not the same cell line transfected with the plasmid vector alone. These data suggest that p75NTR/Aβ interaction may mediate neuronal death in AD. Indeed, much circumstantial evidence implicates p75NTR in the pathogenesis of AD. AD initially affects the basal forebrain cholinergic neurons (11Selkoe D.J. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1994; 17: 489-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (828) Google Scholar, 12Selkoe D.J. Neuron. 1991; 6: 487-498Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2188) Google Scholar, 13Adams R.D. Victor M. Ropper A.H. Principles of Neurology. 6th Ed. McGraw-Hill, New York1998Google Scholar) that in the adult human brain express the highest levels of p75NTR (14Rabizadeh S. Bitler C.M. Butcher L.L. Bredesen D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10703-10706Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Furthermore, cortical neurons of AD patients express p75NTR, but this receptor is only infrequently expressed in cortical neurons of nonaffected aged-matched controls (15Mufson E.J. Kordower J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 89: 569-573Crossref Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Finally, the level of p140trkA, the receptor that in coordination with p75NTR appears to mediate the beneficial effects of NGF (2Kaplan D.R. Miller F.D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 213-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar), is decreased in the human brain of AD patients (16Mufson E.J. Lavine N. Jaffar S. Kordower J.H. Quirion R. Saragovi H.U. Exp.

Acta Anat. 1993; 147: 216-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), suggesting that AD may result in part from a relative overexpression of p75NTR that renders neurons more susceptible to Aβ-induced apoptosis (22Yaar M. Gilchrest B.A. Arch. Dermatol. 1997; 10: 1287-1291Crossref Google Scholar). The signaling pathways leading from p75NTR ligand binding to apoptosis have been partially elucidated in various model systems. NGF binding to p75NTR on the surface of cells lacking p140trkA or expressing only low levels of p140trkA may lead to ceramide generation through sphingomyelin hydrolysis (7Casaccia-Bonnefil P. Carter B.D. Dobrowsky R.T. Chao M.V. Nature. 1996; 383: 716-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar). Ceramide generation is accompanied by activation of the Jun amino-terminal kinase (JNK) (7Casaccia-Bonnefil P. Carter B.D. Dobrowsky R.T. Chao M.V. Nature. 1996; 383: 716-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar), allowing this family of kinases to phosphorylate and activate c-Jun and other transcription factors (23Yang D.D. Kuan C.Y. Whitmarsh A.J. Rincon M. Zheng T.S. Davis R.J. Rakic P. Flavell R.A. Nature. 1997; 389: 865-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (1115) Google Scholar). The JNK pathway, and in particular strong JNK activation, are critical to apoptosis, as mice with knockout JNK genes show decreased neuronal apoptosis in response to the apoptotic inducing agent glutamate, as well as decreased apoptosis during development (23Yang D.D. Kuan C.Y. Whitmarsh A.J. Rincon M. Zheng T.S. Davis R.J. Rakic P. Flavell R.A. Nature. 1997; 389: 865-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (1115) Google Scholar, 24Kuan C.Y. Yang D.D. Samanta Roy D.R. David R.J. Rakic P. Flavell R.A. Neuron. 1999; 22: 667-676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (768) Google Scholar). It is still not clear whether up-regulation of NFκB through p75NTR (25Kaplan D.R. Miller F.D. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2000; 10: 381-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (1655) Google Scholar) occurs independently of the apoptotic pathway and suppresses cell death signals, as is the case with the TNF-α receptor (26Beg A.A. Baltimore D. Science. 1996; 274: 782-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (2933) Google Scholar), or whether NFκB and JNK activation are part of the same signaling pathway leading to apoptosis, as suggested by Kuner et al. (9Kuner P. Schubenel R. Hertel C. J. Neurosci. Res. 1998; 54: 798-804Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Other receptors of this superfamily, in particular TNF-α receptors and Fas, were recently found to be present both as preformed transmembrane trimeric complexes and as individual monomeric receptors (27Siegel R.M. Frederiksen J.K. Zacharias D.A. Chan F.K.M. Johnson M. Lynxh D. Tsien R.Y. Lenardo M.J. Science. 2000; 288: 2354-2357Crossref PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar, 28Chan F.K.M. Chun H.J. Zheng L. Siegel R.M. Bui K.L. Lenardo M.J. Science. 2000; 288: 2351-2354Crossref PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar), with apoptotic signaling initiated only when a ligand binds the trimeric form of the receptor (27Siegel R.M.

In this report we demonstrate that, similar to other members of this superfamily of receptors, p75NTR exists on the cell surface as a trimer as well as a monomer. We show that Aβ binds both the trimeric as well as the monomeric form of p75NTR, but not p140trkA; and that Aβ binding to p75NTR leads to c-Jun mRNA up-regulation and JNK activation. We propose that binding of Aβ to p75NTR trimers is a key pathomechanism of AD. Anti-human and anti-rat p75NTRantibodies were purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Aβ-(1–40) was purchased from Bachem (Torrance, CA), and NGF was purchased from ICN Pharmaceuticals. 125I Aβ-(1–40) was purchased from Peninsula, and 125I-NGF was purchased from NEN. JNK assay kit was purchased from Stratagene. c-Jun and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase cDNAs were purchased from ATCC (catalog nos. 63026 and 57090, respectively). Lyophilized high performance liquid chromatograph-purified Aβ, containing the first 40 amino acids of the amyloid-β peptide (1–40), or an identically handled peptide containing the first 40 amino acids synthesized in reverse order (40-1) as a negative control (Bachem), were dissolved in double-distilled H2O at a concentration of 5 mg/ml, aliquoted, and frozen at −20 °C. Before use, preparations were thawed once, diluted in DMEM, and were either added directly to medium (monomeric, soluble), or incubated at 37 °C for ≥24 h before addition to medium (aggregated). p75NTR-, pCMV-, and p140trkA-NIH 3T3 cells (kindly provided by Dr. M. V. Chao, New York University Medical Center, New York, NY) and E17 fetal rat cortical neurons were generated and maintained as described (5Neiderhauser O. Mangold M. Schubenel R. Kusznir E.A. Schmidt D. Hertel C. J. Neurosci. Res. 2000; 61: 263-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Briefly, NIH 3T3 cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum in the presence of penicillin (45 ng/ml), streptomycin (68 ng/ml), and hygromycin B (17.5 ng/ml). For definitive experiments cells were provided with serum-free DMEM containing transferrin (5 μg/ml) and insulin (5 μg/ml). Neuronal cultures were established from the cerebral cortex of E17 fetal rats (long Evans; Charles River Laboratories, Portage, MI) as described (29Gray C.W. Patel A.J. Brain Res. 1995; 691: 169-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), with minor modifications. In brief, the cerebral cortices were removed, resuspended in 0.025% trypsin in Hanks' buffered saline solution buffered with 10 mm Hepes, and incubated at 37 °C. After 10 min, serum-containing medium supplemented with 0.05% DNase was added, and the content was centrifuged and suspended in serum-containing medium supplemented with 0.02% DNase. Cells were then dissociated by gentle trituration, filtered through 73.7- and 35-μm screens, and the dissociated cells were resuspended in serum-free neurobasal medium (Invitrogen). Cells were plated in T75 tissue culture flasks precoated overnight with 2 μg/cm2poly-d-lysine in PBS (30,000–70,000, pH 7.5, Sigma). Cultures were used 2 days after plating. Cells in suspension were preincubated at 37 °C for 30 min with 125I-Aβ (25 nm), followed by 3,3-dithiobis(sulfosuccinimidylpropionate) (DTSSP) (2 mm) (Pierce) for 30 min at 4 °C. Equal amount of proteins were immunoprecipitated with anti-human p75NTR(NIH 3T3 cells) or anti-rat p75NTR (neurons) antibodies as described (8Yaar M. Zhai S. Pilch P.F. Doyle S.M. Eisenhauer P.B. Fine R.E. Gilchrest B.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 2333-2340Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitates were separated by 8% PAGE and exposed to autoradiography. p75NTR- and p140trkA-NIH 3T3 cells were incubated in binding medium (DMEM, 10 mm Hepes, 0.1 mg/ml cytochrome c, 0.01% Tween 80, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) with 0.5 nm125I-NGF and increasing concentrations of cold aggregated Aβ or with 10 pm125I-NGF and increasing concentrations of cold NGF for 4 h at 15 °C as described (8Yaar M. Zhai S. Pilch P.F. Doyle S.M. Eisenhauer P.B. Fine R.E. Gilchrest B.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 2333-2340Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). At the end of the incubation period, cells were rinsed in PBS and lysed in 1 n NaOH, and lysates were subjected to γ counting. p75NTR-NIH 3T3 cells were lifted with EDTA and incubated at room temperature for 30 min with DTSSP (2 mm). Proteins were extracted in radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer, and then half of the preparation was resuspended in Laemmli buffer containing 2-mercaptoethanol and the other half in buffer containing no reducing agents. Samples were processed for Western blotting and reacted with anti-human p75NTR antibodies as described (30Yaar M. Eller M.S. DiBenedetto P. Reenstra W.R. Zhai S. McQuaid T. Archambault M. Gilchrest B.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 1550-1562Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The same number of cells were incubated in suspension at 37 °C with Aβ (20 μm) or diluent for 30 min followed by DTSSP (2 mm) for 30 min at 4 °C. Cells were lysed and processed for Western blotting and reacted with anti-human p75NTR(3T3 cells) or anti-rat p75NTR (neurons) antibodies as described (30Yaar M. Eller M.S. DiBenedetto P. Reenstra W.R. Zhai S. McQuaid T. Archambault M. Gilchrest B.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 1550-1562Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). p75NTR- and pCMV-NIH 3T3 cells were supplemented with Aβ (20 μm) or diluent for 30 min at 37 °C. Cells were then lysed in 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.7, 300 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol, 20 mm glycerophosphate, 0.1 mmNa3VO4, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, and 100 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. 50 μg of lysate was used to determine JNK activation using the JNK assay kit and following the instructions of the manufacturer. Autoradiograms were scanned (Microtek Scan Maker II) into a computer (Massachusetts Engineering). Band intensity was determined after background subtraction using the densitometric program Sigma Gel (Jandel Scientific, Corte Madera, CA). JNK activation was analyzed by Univariate ANOVA and LSD post hocanalysis. c-Jun mRNA induction was analyzed by SPSS General Linear Model in repeated measure design. Both analyses used the SPSS Inc. statistical package version 9.0. p75NTR is structurally related to Fas and TNF-α receptors that self-assemble as trimers in the absence of ligand. To determine whether p75NTR also exists in these two forms, rat cortical neurons (Fig.1 A) and p75NTR-NIH 3T3 cells (Fig. 1 B) were provided a reducible chemical cross linker and processed for Western blotting. Anti-p75NTRspecific antibodies revealed a 75-kDa band as well as a band at ∼220–230 kDa. The same parental NIH 3T3 cell line transfected with the pCMV plasmid vector alone (pCMV-NIH 3T3 cells) was negative for p75NTR immunoreactivity (Fig. 1 C), confirming the specificity of the identified bands. As determined by densitometric analysis, the ratio between the 75-kDa band and the 220–230-kDa band (75 kDa/220–230 kDa) was 1.4 in the nonreduced samples (Fig.1 D). However, when samples were incubated with a reducing agent the ratio between the bands increased to 9.9, consistent with the presence of p75NTR trimers as well as monomers in the cell membrane in the absence of ligand. Still, our experiments do not completely exclude the possibility that the 220–230-kDa band may represent p75NTR trimerized by an autocrine/paracrine neurotrophic ligand, and/or that the high molecular mass band represents a complex containing another protein not detected by anti-p75NTR antibodies. When Aβ is incubated in aqueous solution for 5 days, as in the present experiments, the Aβ that is present in a soluble state migrates at an electrophoretic mobility of ∼4.5 kDa, whereas aggregated Aβ is either retained at the top of the gel or migrates at a lower electrophoretic mobility of ∼14 kDa (8Yaar M. Zhai S. Pilch P.F. Doyle S.M. Eisenhauer P.B. Fine R.E. Gilchrest B.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 2333-2340Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar, 41Roland K. Behrens M. Choi D. Manias K. Perlmutter D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18032-18044Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). To determine whether Aβ binds p75NTR trimers, cells were stimulated with aggregated 125I-Aβ, a preparation that contains a mixture of soluble and aggregated Aβ, in the presence of a chemical cross-linker and immunoprecipitation was performed with antibodies specific for p75NTR. Autoradiography initially revealed a band of 230–240 kDa (Fig.2 A), consistent with a complex containing three 75-kDa receptors and an Aβ aggregate, but not excluding a complex containing three 75-kDa receptors and one or more soluble nonaggregated Aβ peptides. Longer exposure (24 h) revealed in addition a band of ∼80 kDa (Fig. 2 B), consistent with a complex containing one 75-kDa receptor and one 4.5-kDa Aβ peptide, but not strictly excluding a complex containing one 75-kDa receptor and an Aβ aggregate (∼14 kDa). These data are consistent with Aβ binding to both forms of the receptor. Because Aβ, particularly the aggregated form, is known to be “sticky,” to rule out the possibility that the above results represent nonspecific binding, p75NTR-NIH 3T3 cells were incubated with 0.5 nm125I-NGF and increasing concentrations of unlabeled aggregated Aβ. Aβ competitively displaced125I-NGF binding in p75NTR-NIH 3T3 cells (Fig.3 A). Regression analysis showed significant dose-dependent inhibition of binding with increasing Aβ concentrations (r 2 = 0.94,p < 0.006; Jandel Scientific). Because neurons express two NGF receptors, to rule out the possibility that Aβ also binds the nerve growth factor co-receptor p140trkA, p140trkA-NIH 3T3 cells were incubated with125I-NGF and Aβ as above. Aβ did not affect125I-NGF binding to p140trkA-NIH 3T3 (Fig.3 B), whereas nonlabeled NGF competitively displaced125I-NGF binding in the cells (Fig. 3 C), further supporting the specificity of Aβ binding to p75NTR. To determine whether Aβ signals through p75NTR, p75NTR-NIH 3T3 cells, pCMV-NIH 3T3 cells, and rat cortical neurons were stimulated with aggregated Aβ and the induction of c-Jun mRNA was determined. Northern blot analysis showed rapid c-Jun mRNA up-regulation in p75NTR-NIH 3T3 cells (Fig.4 A) and in neurons (Fig.4 C) but not in control cells transfected with the plasmid vector alone (Fig. 4 A). In a total of four independent experiments, c-Jun mRNA was significantly induced by Aβ (p < 0.05) in both p75NTR-expressing cell types but not in pCMV-NIH 3T3 cells that do not express the receptor. This result is consistent with c-Jun-mediated signal transduction by Aβ through p75NTR. p75NTR-NIH 3T3 cells and pCMV-NIH 3T3 were stimulated with aggregated Aβ, and JNK activation was measured by phosphorylation of its substrate GST-c-Jun-(1–79). Strong JNK activation was detected in p75NTR-NIH 3T3 cells, but JNK was only minimally activated in control pCMV-NIH 3T3 cells that were handled identically (Fig. 5, Aand B). In a total of four independent analyses, JNK activation was significantly induced by Aβ only in cells that express p75NTR (p < 0.02). There was no statistically significant difference between Aβ-stimulated pCMV-NIH 3T3 cells that do not express p75NTR versus the same cells stimulated with diluent, or between p75NTR-NIH 3T3 cells stimulated with diluent versus pCMV-NIH 3T3 cells. This result is consistent with previous reports that apoptosis induced by NGF in oligodendrocytes that express only p75NTR is mediated by JNK activation (7Casaccia-Bonnefil P. Carter B.D. Dobrowsky R.T. Chao M.V. Nature. 1996; 383: 716-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar). p75NTR belongs to the family of cell surface “death receptors” that include Fas and the TNF-α receptors. It was initially thought that these receptors trimerize only upon ligand binding (31Tartaglia L.A. Goeddel D.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4304-4307Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, it was recently shown that both TNF-α receptors and Fas can be found in a complex containing three monomeric receptors in the absence of exogenously added ligand, with further analysis confirming that an extracellular domain on the receptor and not an external ligand is responsible for the trimerization (confirming that at least a portion of these receptors are present as preformed trimers) (27Siegel R.M.

Siegel R.M. Bui K.L. Lenardo M.J. Science. 2000; 288: 2351-2354Crossref PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar). Using p75NTR NIH-3T3 cells and rat cortical neurons, we employed a chemical that cross-links only molecules that are less than 12Å apart. We identified two forms of p75NTR, a monomeric form of 75 kDa and a form of ∼220–230 kDa, consistent with a p75NTR trimer, suggesting that a subset of p75NTR are present as trimers on the cell surface. However, we cannot completely exclude the possibility that the higher molecular mass band is a complex that contains one or more other proteins, in addition to p75NTR, that happen to be within a 12-Å distance of p75NTR and whose aggregate molecular mass is 75 or 150 kDa, resulting in the observed band of ∼220–230 kDa. Still, this seems unlikely because the band was present in two unrelated cell types, primary cortical neurons and p75NTR NIH-3T3 cells, and no other specific bands of different molecular mass were recognized by the antibodies. Furthermore, disruption of the cross-linking led to increased intensity of the 75-kDa band and decreased intensity of the 220–230-kDa band, with a redistribution of p75NTR immunoreactivity quantitatively most consistent with disaggregation of trimers into monomers. Neither can we completely exclude the possibility that the higher molecular mass band represents receptor trimerization as a result of autocrine neurotrophic factors produced by the 3T3 cells (30Yaar M. Eller M.S. DiBenedetto P. Reenstra W.R. Zhai S. McQuaid T. Archambault M. Gilchrest B.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 1550-1562Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar,32Murase K. Hattori A. Kohno M. Hayashi K. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int. 1993; 30: 615-621PubMed Google Scholar) or paracrine neurotrophic factors produced by contaminating cells, other than neurons, in the fetal rat brain cultures (reviewed in Refs.33Otten U. Marz P. Heese K. Hock C. Kunz D. Rose-John S. Prog. Brain Res. 2001; 132: 545-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar and 34Metsis M. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2001; 58: 1014-1020Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Although TNF-α receptors are present as preformed trimers, these receptor complexes do not signal in the absence of ligand binding (28Chan F.K.M. Chun H.J. Zheng L. Siegel R.M. Bui K.L. Lenardo M.J. Science. 2000; 288: 2351-2354Crossref PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar). Interestingly, preventing TNF-α receptor ligand-independent self-association eliminated TNF-α binding, suggesting that homotrimeric TNF-α can only bind the pre-assembled trimeric receptor (28Chan F.K.M. Chun H.J. Zheng L. Siegel R.M. Bui K.L. Lenardo M.J. Science. 2000; 288: 2351-2354Crossref PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar). To determine whether Aβ binds p75NTR trimers as the first step in the previously reported induction of apoptosis (8Yaar M. Zhai S. Pilch P.F. Doyle S.M. Eisenhauer P.B. Fine R.E. Gilchrest B.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 2333-2340Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar, 9Kuner P. Schubenel R. Hertel C. J. Neurosci. Res. 1998; 54: 798-804Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), aggregated 125I-Aβ, a mixture of both aggregated and soluble peptides, was added to neurons and to p75NTR-NIH 3T3 cells. Immunoprecipitation experiments showed that Aβ bound both the monomeric and the trimeric forms of the receptor. We speculate that because only aggregated Aβ induces cellular apoptosis (11Selkoe D.J. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1994; 17: 489-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (828) Google Scholar), only the aggregated form of Aβ activates pre-assembled p75NTR; and that this induces neuronal apoptosis. However, the result of this experiment does not allow us to rule out the possibility that it is the soluble form of Aβ that binds p75NTR trimer. We also documented that addition of cold Aβ inhibited125I NGF binding to p75NTR in cells expressing the receptor but not in the same cells engineered to express p140trkA, the other recognized receptor for NGF. This result and the previously reported high affinity of Aβ for p75NTR (8Yaar M. Zhai S. Pilch P.F. Doyle S.M. Eisenhauer P.B. Fine R.E. Gilchrest B.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 2333-2340Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar) strongly support our conclusion that Aβ binding to p75NTR is specific and is not the result of the aggregated molecule being nonspecifically sticky. Our studies also demonstrate that Aβ binding to p75NTRinduces receptor signaling events. In both p75NTR NIH 3T3 cells and cortical neurons, there was a rapid and transient induction of c-Jun transcripts following stimulation with Aβ. In addition, there was strong activation of JNK. This result strongly suggests that c-Jun induction is a specific signaling event that follows Aβ binding to p75NTR. It cannot be explained by Aβ activation of another receptor or by Aβ activating a non-receptor signaling pathway because these events were not observed in the control cell line engineered to express the plasmid vector alone, identical to the responsive cells but for the expression of p75NTR. Indeed, c-Jun is one of the immediate early genes that are induced in response to a variety of stimuli including apoptotic stimuli (35Sawai H. Okazaki T. Yamamoto H. Okano H. Takeda Y. Tashima M.

Furthermore, other data suggest that c-Jun/AP-1 is essential for the regulation of apoptosis (35Sawai H. Okazaki T. Yamamoto H. Okano H. Takeda Y. Tashima M. Sawada H. Okuma M. Ishikura H. Umehara H. Domae N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27326-27331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar), making induction of the c-Jun/AP-1 complex in the present experiments consistent with Aβ exposure mediating apoptosis of cells expressing p75NTR (8Yaar M. Zhai S. Pilch P.F. Doyle S.M. Eisenhauer P.B. Fine R.E. Gilchrest B.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 2333-2340Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Some investigators have reported that apoptosis is associated with sustained increase in c-Jun mRNA levels (37Kondo T. Matsuda T. Kitano T. Takahashi A. Tashima M. Ishikura H. Umchara H. Domae N. Uchiyama T. Okazaki T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7668-7676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 38Anderson A.J. Pike C.J. Cotman C.W. J. Neurochem. 1995; 65: 1487-1498Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). However, sustained c-Jun induction has not been a consistent finding preceding cellular apoptosis, and several investigators (35Sawai H. Okazaki T. Yamamoto H. Okano H. Takeda Y. Tashima M. Sawada H. Okuma M. Ishikura H. Umehara H. Domae N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27326-27331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 36Sherman M.L. Datta R. Hallahan D.E.

Pharmacol. 1991; 39: 697-701PubMed Google Scholar) have shown that rapid and transient c-Jun induction, very similar to that observed by us, induces apoptosis. Thus, sustained c-Jun induction does not appear to be required for apoptosis and may instead reflect a cell-specific or stimulus-specific response. JNK comprises a family of enzymes that phosphorylate c-Jun and are strongly activated in cells exposed to apoptotic stimuli (40Rosette C. Karin M. Science. 1996; 274: 1194-1197Crossref PubMed Scopus (942) Google Scholar). We observed a strong activation of JNK within 30 min after Aβ supplementation in cells expressing p75NTR but not in cells lacking the receptor. In combination with our previous demonstration of apoptosis in these cells under the same conditions (8Yaar M. Zhai S. Pilch P.F. Doyle S.M. Eisenhauer P.B. Fine R.E. Gilchrest B.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 2333-2340Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar), this indicates that Aβ induced apoptosis is mediated through the AP-1 complex. The data in combination show that Aβ binds and activates p75NTR, inducing c-Jun mRNA and presumptively c-Jun protein with subsequent activation of JNK and c-Jun phosphorylation. The signaling pathway almost certainly then interacts with others to produce apoptosis, although our studies do not address this point. In summary, we have shown that p75NTR, like other death receptors, is present as trimers as well as monomers on the surface of neurons; and that Aβ binds to p75NTR trimers as well as to p75NTR monomers but not to p140trkA. We have further shown that Aβ binding induces receptor activation and propagates intracellular signaling that leads to apoptosis. The data strongly imply that Aβ/p75NTRinteraction is causally related to neuronal loss in AD. Therapeutic interventions that block Aβ/p75NTR interaction might thus slow or arrest the progression of AD."
https://openalex.org/W2080104036,"Epsin and AP180/CALM are important endocytic accessory proteins that are believed to be involved in the formation of clathrin coats. Both proteins associate with phosphorylated membrane inositol lipids through their epsin N-terminal homology domains and with other components of the endocytic machinery through short peptide motifs in their carboxyl-terminal segments. Using hydrodynamic and spectroscopic methods, we demonstrate that the parts of epsin 1 and AP180 that are involved in protein-protein interactions behave as poorly structured flexible polypeptide chains with little or no conventional secondary structure. The predominant cytosolic forms of both proteins are monomers. Furthermore, we show that recombinant epsin 1, like AP180, drives in vitro assembly of clathrin cages. We conclude that the epsin N-terminal homology domain-containing proteins AP180/CALM and epsin 1 have a very similar molecular architecture that is designed for the rapid and efficient recruitment of the principal coat components clathrin and AP-2 at the sites of coated pit assembly."

In this study, we describe the cloning, heterologous expression, purification, and functional characterization of one of these ATPases, CopA (NCB accession number AAB90763), encoded by AF0473. CopA is active at high temperatures (75 °C; E a = 103 kJ/mol) and inactive at 37 °C. It is activated by Ag+(ATPase V max = 14.82 μmol/mg/h) and to a lesser extent by Cu+ (ATPase V max = 3.66 μmol/mg/h). However, Cu+ interacts with the enzyme with higher apparent affinity (ATPase stimulation, Ag+ K 12 = 29.4 μm; Cu+ K 12 = 2.1 μm). This activation by Ag+ or Cu+ is dependent on the presence of millimolar amounts of cysteine. In the presence of ATP, these metals drive the formation of an acid-stable phosphoenzyme with apparent affinities similar to those observed in the ATPase activity determinations (Ag+, K 12 = 23.0 μm; Cu+, K 12 = 3.9 μm). However, comparable levels of phosphoenzyme are reached in the presence of both cations (Ag+, 1.40 nmol/mg; Cu+, 1.08 nmol/mg). The stimulation of phosphorylation by the cations suggests that CopA drives the outward movement of the metal. CopA presents additional functional characteristics similar to other P-type ATPases. ATP interacts with the enzyme with two apparent affinities (ATPase K m = 0.25 mm; phosphorylation K m = 4.81 μm), and the presence of vanadate leads to enzyme inactivation (IC50= 24 μm). This is the first Ag+/Cu+-ATPase expressed and purified in a functional form. Thus, it provides a model for structure-functional studies of these transporters.

P-type ATPases transport a variety of ions (H+, Na+, K+, Cu+, Ca2+, Mg2+, Cd2+, Zn2+, etc.) across cell membranes using the energy provided by ATP hydrolysis (1Axelsen K.B. Palmgren M.G. J. Mol.

The phosphorylation of the aspartyl group in the consensus sequence DKTGT is a fundamental characteristic within this mechanism. The participation of specific transmembrane segments (TMs) in cation binding and transport has also been established for the better characterized members of this family, the Na,K-ATPase and SR Ca-ATPase (5Clarke D.M.

This provided important information on the overall disposition of the TMs and confirmed the participation of three TMs (H4, H5, and H6) in ion binding. Despite these significant advances, important questions pertaining to the family of P-type ATPases remain to be answered. For instance, how is ion selectivity achieved? What are the particular molecular events that take place in the protein during ATP hydrolysis, energy transduction, and ion transport?More than 250 P-type ATPases have been identified in all life kingdoms (data available on the World Wide Web at biobase. dk/∼axe/Patbase.html). Comparison of primary sequences, proposed topological arrangements, and ion specificity has allowed the organization of the P-type ATPases into various subfamilies (1Axelsen K.B. Palmgren M.G. J. Mol. Evol. 1998; 46: 84-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar, 4Lutsenko S. Kaplan J.H. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 15607-15613Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar, 10Fagan M.J.

Evol. 1998; 46: 84-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar), in a detailed analysis of phylogenetic trees, described five groups with particular ion specificities (PI–PV). Among these, ATPases in the PIB subfamily transport transition metals (Cu+, Ag+, Zn2+, Cd2+, Pb2+, and Co2+). In light of their substrates, these enzymes appear as central elements in the processes of metal biotolerance and bioaccumulation (11Williams L.E. Pittman J.K. Hall J.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1465: 104-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar, 12Silver S. Gene (Amst.). 1996; 179: 9-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar, 13Bull P.C. Cox D.W.

Although a detailed enzymatic characterization of PIB-type ATPases has not been performed, the formation of the phosphorylated intermediate and transport properties have been explored for some members of this family (17Solioz M.

Based on hydrophobicity analysis, most PIB-type ATPases appear to have eight TMs (Fig. 1). This membrane topology has been experimentally confirmed only for CopA from H. pylori (23Melchers K. Weitzenegger T. Buhmann A. Steinhilber W. Sachs G. Schofer K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 446-457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). A unique feature of these proteins is the presence of a putative metal binding sequence (CPC, CPH, or SPC) in their transmembrane region, specifically in the TM immediately upstream from the phosphorylation site (Fig. 1). Because of this signature sequence, these enzymes are termed CPx-ATPases (24Solioz M. Vulpe C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 237-241Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). Concerning the functional role of these sequences, it has been shown that the second Cys (CPC) is required for enzyme function (25Yoshimizu T. Omote H. Wakabayashi T. Sambongi Y. Futai M. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 1998; 62: 1258-1260Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Thus, the mutated (CPC → CPA) gene is unable to confer Cu+ resistance to Δccc2 yeast (Cu-ATPase gene disrupted) (25Yoshimizu T. Omote H. Wakabayashi T. Sambongi Y. Futai M. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 1998; 62: 1258-1260Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). However, the relationship between ion specificity and CPx sequences remains to be established. Moreover, at the present, the ion transported and the direction of transport cannot be predicted. Another noticeable characteristic of CPx-ATPases is the presence of 1–6 metal binding domains in their N terminus (N-MBD). These cytoplasmic N-MBDs include either the consensus CXXC or a His-rich sequence. The capacity of domains containing the CXXC sequence to bind metals and to interact with soluble metal chaperones has been established (26Lutsenko S. Petrukhin K. Cooper M.J. Gilliam C.T. Kaplan J.H.

Recent studies have shown that the CXXC N-MBDs are not required for ion transport, and a regulatory role has been suggested for these domains (29Tsivkovskii R. MacArthurs B. Lutsenko S. J. Biol.

Liebl W. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. 2001; 36: 39-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar, 33Scandurra R. Consalvi V. Chiaraluce R. Politi L. Engel P.C. Front. Biosci. 2000; 5: D787-D795Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The study of thermotolerant, soluble proteins suggests that the intrinsic structure determined by the amino acid sequence is the determinant of their stability. Thus, thermostable enzymes are obtained after heterologous expression in mesophilic organisms. Although no particular stabilizing mechanism is obvious in these proteins, a general increment of small strengthening forces is apparent (hydrogen bonds, ion pairs, etc.). This structural stability appears to have been achieved at the expense of flexibility, since most of these enzymes are inactive under 40 °C and have high activation energies (32Sterner R. Liebl W. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. 2001; 36: 39-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar, 33Scandurra R. Consalvi V. Chiaraluce R. Politi L. Engel P.C. Front. Biosci. 2000; 5: D787-D795Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, thermophilic membrane proteins and solute transporters in particular have received little attention. Considering the particular lipid composition of archaea membranes (34van de Vossenberg J.L. Driessen A.J. Konings W.N. Extremophiles. 1998; 2: 163-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 35Albers S. van de Vossenberg J. Driessen A. Konings W. Front. Biosci. 2000; 5: D813-D820Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), it could be hypothesized that thermophilic membrane proteins should have particular functional and structural characteristics. However, although some A1A0-ATPases (the archaeal homologs of F1F0-ATPases), redox, and electron transport components from archaea have been studied (36Schafer G. Engelhard M. Muller V. Microbiol.

Thus, little information is available on the structure and function of thermophilic solute transport proteins.We have initiated the study of thermophilic CPx-ATPases with the goal of understanding the catalytic mechanism, structural features, and mechanisms of ion selectivity of PIB-type ATPases while gaining information on thermostable ion transport proteins. In this report, we present the cloning, heterologous expression, purification, and functional characterization of a CPx-ATPase present in the hyperthermophile Archaeoglobus fulgidus. This is the first description of a thermophilic P-type ATPase and biochemical characterization of a purified Ag+/Cu+-ATPase.RESULTSA. fulgidus is a hyperthermophylic sulfur-metabolizing organism. Its genome contains only two P-type ATPases encoding genes AF0473 and AF0152 (41Klenk H. Clayton R. Tomb J. White O. Nelson K. Ketchum K. Dodson R. Gwinn M. Hickey E. Peterson J. Richardson D.

Smith H. Woese C. Venter J. Nature. 1997; 390: 364-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (1198) Google Scholar). We will refer to these ATPases as CopA (NCB accession number AAB90763) (this has been previously referred as PacS) and CopB (NCB accession number AAB91079). These small ATPases, 804 and 690 amino acids, respectively, have the typical topological pattern of PIB-type ATPases (i.e. eight TMs and a large cytoplasmic loop containing the DKTGT sequence) (Fig. 1). Based on sequence homology analysis, they appear closely related to the Cu+/Ag+ transporting subgroup within the PIB-type ATPases (47Rensing C. Ghosh M. Rosen B.P. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 5891-5897Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). CopA has a single GMTCAMC N-MBD and a CPC metal binding sequence in its sixth TM. On the contrary, CopB has a His-rich N-MBD (1MHEHDSHGEAAHSNSEDMQMIHQHHEHHGHEEEHSAHHEKMKHSADHGDHHRM53) and a CPH metal binding sequence in the sixth TM. These structures appear similar to those of CopA and CopB fromEnterococcus hirae (48Odermatt A. Suter H. Krapf R. Solioz M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12775-12779Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (percentage identity, 41 and 40%, respectively). Moreover, the metal transport systems are probably complemented by a putative copper chaperone, similar to CopZ fromE. hirae (49Cobine P. Wickramasinghe W.A. Harrison M.D. Weber T. Solioz M. Dameron C.T. FEBS Lett. 1999; 445: 27-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) or Atx1 from yeast (50Lin S.J. Pufahl R.A. Dancis A., TV, O.H. Culotta V.C. J. Biol.

Fig.2 shows the presence of CopA in isolated membranes after induction of expression with arabinose (Fig. 2,lanes 5 and 6). To isolate the protein, this was solubilized with DDM under conditions where activity was retained. Treatment with other detergents (Triton X-100, C12E8, Tween 20) at similar concentrations led to enzyme inactivation. Enzyme ligands (Mg-ATP) had no stabilizing effect on this protein during its solubilization. The solubilized protein was subsequently purified by Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity column using standard protocols (Fig. 2, lanes 3 and 6). Densitometry of Coomassie Brilliant Blue-stained SDS-PAGE gels shows that this procedure routinely yielded a >90% pure protein (Fig. 2, lane 3).Figure 2Expression and purification of CopA fromA. fulgidus.

Acta. 1985; 815: 196-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), CopA required the inclusion of optimized amounts of lipids and detergent in the assay medium to be functional. It is significant that asolectine (phosphatidyl choline-enriched soybean lipids) was able to replace the isoprenoid dialkyl diglycerol cyclic tetraethers that predominantly constitute the monolayer membrane of hyperthermophile archaea (34van de Vossenberg J.L. Driessen A.J. Konings W.N. Extremophiles. 1998; 2: 163-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 35Albers S. van de Vossenberg J. Driessen A. Konings W. Front. Biosci. 2000; 5: D813-D820Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). A detailed analysis of the influence of lipid composition and membrane structure on the kinetics of this archaeal transporter was beyond the scope of these experiments. As expected based on its homology with putative monovalent metal transport CPx-ATPases and the living environment of A. fulgidus, the purified CopA showed Ag+- and Cu+-stimulated ATPase activity when assayed at 75 °C (Fig.3). However, maximum Cu-ATPase activity was only 25% of that measured in the presence of Ag+. On the other hand, 100 μm Cu2+, Hg2+, Zn2+, Cd2+, Fe2+, or Co2+ were unable to significantly activate the enzyme (Fig. 3). Considering the putative peculiarities of proteins from extremophile organisms, the dependence of silver-stimulated ATPase activity on ionic strength, pH, and temperature was analyzed (Fig.4). High salt concentration stimulated the ATPase, reaching a plateau at 400–500 mm salt (Fig.4 A). This effect appears independent of the cation, since NaCl or KCl yielded similar Ag-ATPase stimulation. Experiments usingN-methylglucamine to increase ionic strength in the medium could not confirm this point. Although the amine at low concentration (under 10 mm) stimulated the ATPase as NaCl or KCl, it led to a sharp inactivation at higher concentrations (IC50 = 25 mm) (not shown). CopA showed a typical, bell-shaped, dependence of activity on pH with a maximum activity at pH 6.1–6.5 (Fig. 4 B). Fig. 4 C shows the dependence of this ATPase on the temperature. Considering that under physiological conditions this enzyme works at 70–80 °C, it was not surprising that CopA reached maximum activity at 75 °C and was inactive at 37 °C. An Arrhenius plot showed an energy of activation of 103 kJ/mol for ATP hydrolysis by CopA under our experimental conditions (Fig. 4 C, inset). This value is similar to that observed with other thermophilic enzymes (33Scandurra R. Consalvi V. Chiaraluce R. Politi L. Engel P.C. Front. Biosci. 2000; 5: D787-D795Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,54Hinrichs M. Schafer G. Anemuller S. Biol. Chem. 1999; 380: 1063-1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar) and much higher that the 20–40 kJ/mol energy of activation determined for mesophilic enzymes (46Segel I.H. Enzyme Kinetics. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1993Google Scholar).Figure 3Activation of CopA ATPase by metals. The ATPase activity was determined as indicated under “Experimental Procedures.” Final concentration of each metal ion was 100 μm, which is a saturating concentration for Ag+ and Cu+ (see Fig. 8). 20 mmcysteine was included in all cases, and, in addition, 2.5 mm DTT was included in the Cu(I)-containing assay mixture. 100% activity was 13.5 μmol/mg/h.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Previous studies have indicated the dependence of CPx-ATPase activity on the presence of thiolates (20Sharma R. Rensing C. Rosen B.P. Mitra B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3873-3878Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 30Mitra B. Sharma R. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 7694-7699Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) and/or reducing agents (55Voskoboinik I. Brooks H. Smith S. Shen P. Camakaris J.

A. 2000; 97: 652-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). The CopA Ag-ATPase activity showed a strong dependence on cysteine concentration with maximum activity at 20 mm cysteine (Fig.5). The presence of ascorbate, citrate, DTT, or glutathione in the medium had no effect on Ag-ATPase activity (not shown). The dependence on cysteine was also evident when Cu+ stimulation was tested. In this case, 2.5 mm DTT was also necessary in the medium to maintain the metal in its Cu(I) redox state. Thus, in the absence of DTT and cysteine, no Cu-ATPase activity was detected. The enzyme was only partially activated by 100 μmCu2SO4, 2.5 mm DTT in the absence of cysteine (12% of the activity observed in the presence of 100 μm Cu2SO4, 20 mmcysteine, 2.5 mm DTT). Similarly, 100 μmCu2SO4, 20 mm cysteine (absence of DTT) stimulated the enzyme to just 33% of maximum activity. These initial experiments suggest that the role of thiolates and metal-thiolate complexes in the metal-protein interaction might be more complex than previously proposed (20Sharma R. Rensing C. Rosen B.P. Mitra B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3873-3878Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) (see “Discussion”).Figure 5Cysteine dependence of CopA Ag-ATPase activity. The Ag-ATPase activity was determined as indicated under “Experimental Procedures” with various cysteine concentrations. No curve fitting was attempted. 100% activity was 12–14.5 μmol/mg/h.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Toward establishing that CopA behaves as other P-type ATPases, the effects of different inhibitors on enzyme activity were tested. Inhibition of P-type ATPases by vanadate is accepted as a key feature of these enzymes (57Cantley L.C. Josephson L. Warner R. Yanagisawa M. Lechene C. Guidotti G. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 7421-7423Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 58Barrabin H. Garrahan P.J. Rega A.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1980; 600: 796-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). CopA was completely inhibited by vanadate with an IC50 of 24 μm (Fig.6), confirming its basic mechanistic similarities with all other P-type ATPases. Oligomycin, a known inhibitor of the Na,K-ATPase (59Arato-Oshima T. Matsui H. Wakizaka A. Homareda H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25604-25610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), partially inhibited CopA (approximately 50%) with a K 12 of 4.7 μm (Fig. 6). Interestingly, this K 12is similar to that observed for inhibition and stabilization of Na+ occlusion in the Na,K-ATPase. NaN3, NaNO3, or ouabain had no effect in enzyme activity.Interaction of CopA with ATPATP interacts with P-type ATPases with two apparent affinities (2Glynn I. Martonosi A. Enzymes of Biological Membranes. 3. Plenum Press, New York1985: 35-114Google Scholar, 3Inesi G. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1985; 47: 573-601Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mechanistically, ATP with a K m in the submillimolar range appears to accelerate the transition E2 → E1, thus increasing the enzyme turnover. In the case of CopA, ATPversus ATPase activity curves showed that the enzyme was stimulated by ATP with low affinity (K m = 0.25 mm) in a fashion similar to that observed in other P-type ATPases (Fig. 7). On the other hand, a high affinity interaction in the micromolar range is observed when phosphorylation by ATP is studied. This parameter has not been previously determined for a CPx-ATPase. Toward performing these determinations, phosphorylation conditions were established. At low temperatures (reduced turnover) and in the presence of ATP and the outwardly transported cation, P-type ATPases are phosphorylated; moreover, the enzyme is predominantly arrested in a phosphorylated conformation, and this acid-stable intermediary can be isolated. For CopA, low turnover conditions were achieved by performing the phosphorylation reaction at 37 °C (See Fig. 4 C). In addition, 20% Me2SO was included in the assay medium to stabilize the phosphorylated forms of the enzyme (60Barrabin H. Fontes C.F. Scofano H.M. Norby J.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1023: 266-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Under these conditions and in the presence of Ag+ and ATP, a maximum phosphoenzyme level of 1.4–1.6 nmol/mg was obtained (Fig.8). Different temperatures or Me2SO concentrations did not lead to higher phosphorylation; nevertheless, the observed phosphoenzyme level is close to those measured in membrane preparations of purified Na,K-ATPase (60Barrabin H. Fontes C.F. Scofano H.M. Norby J.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1023: 266-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) or SR-Ca-ATPase (61Barrabin H. Scofano H.M. Inesi G. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 1542-1548Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Considering the mechanistic implications, the observation that CopA is phosphorylated in the presence of Ag+ or Cu+ is highly relevant. Assuming that CopA behaves as all other P-type ATPases where the outwardly transported cation drives phosphorylation, then it is apparent that CopA would probably catalyze the efflux of these metals. Regarding the interaction of ATP with the enzyme, Fig. 8 shows the dependence of CopA phosphorylation on this nucleotide. The ATPK m = 4.8 μm for this partial reaction indicates that ATP interacts with CopA with high affinity.Figure 7ATP dependence of C"

However, it is also important to elucidate the effects of the various pathogenic mutations in theNF2 gene in terms of the protein structure, as well as to gain insights into the structural characterization of merlin. Here, we report the three-dimensional structure of merlin (residues 1–346), which contains the FERM domain (1–311) plus a part of the helical region, as revealed by x-ray crystallography.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESThe FERM domain (1–346 residues) of mouse merlin was expressed as a fusion protein with glutathione S-transferase (GST). The protein was purified using a GST affinity column with glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) and ion-exchange columns HiTrapQ and SP (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). The purified protein was verified with matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectroscopy (JMS Elite, PerSeptive Inc.) and N-terminal analysis (M492, Applied Biosystems). Crystals were obtained at 4 °C by the hanging drop vapor-diffusion method from solutions containing 13.6 mg/ml protein, 10 mm MES, pH 6.8, 7.5% polyethylene glycol 6000, 150 mm NaCl, 250 mmLiCl, and 0.5 mm dithiothreitol equilibrated against 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.0, 15% polyethylene glycol 6000 (PEG 6K), and 500 mm LiCl. All diffraction data were collected from crystals flash-frozen to 100 K after cryoprotection in a solution containing 18% PEG 6K, 25% PEG 400, and 500 mm LiCl. The crystals belong to space groupP43212, which was determined by the following structure analysis with unit cell parametersa = b = 67.4 Å, c = 179.1 Å. A 2.9-Å data set was collected using a charge-coupled area detector (Mar CCD) installed on the beam line BL41XU at the Spring-8 synchrotron facility, Harima, Japan. The wavelength was set to 0.9198 Å with a crystal-to-detector distance of 150 mm. The data were collected with angular ranges of 180° with step sizes of 1° for an exposure time of 4 s.

Neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2)1 is an autosomal dominant disease that causes a predisposition to the development of nervous system tumors, mainly vestibular schwannomas involving the eighth pair of cranial nerves and schwannomas of other locations, meningiomas and ependymomas. Mutations in the NF2 gene have been identified in individuals affected with NF2, suggesting that theNF2 gene might encode a tumor suppressor (1Evans D.G. Huson S.M. Donnai D. Neary W. Blair V.

Extensive studies of this gene for the presence of inactivating mutations in NF2 patients has revealed different mutation types including nonsense, frameshift, missense, insertion, deletion, and splice-site mutations. The NF2 protein, called merlin or schwannomin, has two predominant isoforms that lack residues corresponding to exon 16 (isoform I) or exon 17 (isoform II), leading to variant C-terminal ends of the proteins.

Biochemical and cell biological data indicate that merlin may share some molecular functions with ERM proteins (6Bretscher A. Chambers D Nguyen R. Reczek D. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev.

Interestingly, most mutations found in NF2 patients fall into the FERM domain (Fig.2), which has been known to directly bind plasma membranes and adhesion proteins. Recently, crystal structures of ERM proteins have been determined. These are the dormant complex of the moesin FERM domain with the C-terminal tail domain (10Pearson M.A. Reczek D. Bretscher A. Karplus P.A. Cell. 2000; 101: 259-270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar) and the activated form of radixin with and without inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) (11Hamada K. Shimizu T. Matsui T. Tsukita Sh. Tsukita Sa. Hakoshima T. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4449-4462Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). These structures provide the structural basis of masking/unmasking and membrane-targeting mechanisms of the ERM proteins. Moreover, the protein 4.1 has been shown to display the FERM domain structure similar to those of ERM proteins (12Han B. Nunomura W. Takakuwa Y. Mohandas N. Jap B.K. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 871-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). However, it is also important to elucidate the effects of the various pathogenic mutations in theNF2 gene in terms of the protein structure, as well as to gain insights into the structural characterization of merlin. Here, we report the three-dimensional structure of merlin (residues 1–346), which contains the FERM domain (1–311) plus a part of the helical region, as revealed by x-ray crystallography. EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESThe FERM domain (1–346 residues) of mouse merlin was expressed as a fusion protein with glutathione S-transferase (GST). The protein was purified using a GST affinity column with glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) and ion-exchange columns HiTrapQ and SP (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). The purified protein was verified with matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectroscopy (JMS Elite, PerSeptive Inc.) and N-terminal analysis (M492, Applied Biosystems). Crystals were obtained at 4 °C by the hanging drop vapor-diffusion method from solutions containing 13.6 mg/ml protein, 10 mm MES, pH 6.8, 7.5% polyethylene glycol 6000, 150 mm NaCl, 250 mmLiCl, and 0.5 mm dithiothreitol equilibrated against 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.0, 15% polyethylene glycol 6000 (PEG 6K), and 500 mm LiCl. All diffraction data were collected from crystals flash-frozen to 100 K after cryoprotection in a solution containing 18% PEG 6K, 25% PEG 400, and 500 mm LiCl. The crystals belong to space groupP43212, which was determined by the following structure analysis with unit cell parametersa = b = 67.4 Å, c = 179.1 Å. A 2.9-Å data set was collected using a charge-coupled area detector (Mar CCD) installed on the beam line BL41XU at the Spring-8 synchrotron facility, Harima, Japan. The wavelength was set to 0.9198 Å with a crystal-to-detector distance of 150 mm. The data were collected with angular ranges of 180° with step sizes of 1° for an exposure time of 4 s. Intensity data were processed using the programs DPS-Mosfilm (13Rossmann M.G. van Beek C.G. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1999; 55: 1631-1653Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar).The initial phases were calculated by molecular replacement using a search model based on the free state structure of the radixin FERM domain (11Hamada K.

https://openalex.org/W2080960170,"Subtilisin kexin isozyme-1 (SKI-1)/site 1 protease is a mammalian subtilase composed of distinct functional domains. Among the major substrates of SKI-1 are the sterol regulatory element-binding proteins, regulating cholesterol and fatty acid homeostasis. Other substrates include the stress response factor activating transcription factor-6, the brain-derived neurotrophic factor, and the surface glycoproteins of highly infectious viruses belonging to the family of Arenaviridae. Domain deletion and/or point mutants were used to gauge the role of the various domains of SKI-1. Biosynthesis, cellular trafficking, and sterol regulatory element-binding protein-2 cleavage activity were used as diagnostic tools. Results revealed that Arg130 and Arg134 are critical for the autocatalytic primary processing of the prosegment and for the subsequent efficient exit of SKI-1 from the endoplasmic reticulum. Functional mapping of the growth factor cytokine receptor motif suggested a folding role within the endoplasmic reticulum. Microsequencing of the remaining membrane-bound stub following ectodomain shedding of SKI-1 localized the shedding site to KHQKLL953↓. Site-directed mutagenesis, in vitro cleavage of a synthetic peptide containing the shedding site, and inhibitor studies favor an autocatalytic event occurring at a non-canonical SKI-1 recognition sequence, with P2 and P1 Leu being very critical. In conclusion, multiple domains ensuring optimal functional characteristics control SKI-1 activity and cellular trafficking. Subtilisin kexin isozyme-1 (SKI-1)/site 1 protease is a mammalian subtilase composed of distinct functional domains. Among the major substrates of SKI-1 are the sterol regulatory element-binding proteins, regulating cholesterol and fatty acid homeostasis. Other substrates include the stress response factor activating transcription factor-6, the brain-derived neurotrophic factor, and the surface glycoproteins of highly infectious viruses belonging to the family of Arenaviridae. Domain deletion and/or point mutants were used to gauge the role of the various domains of SKI-1. Biosynthesis, cellular trafficking, and sterol regulatory element-binding protein-2 cleavage activity were used as diagnostic tools. Results revealed that Arg130 and Arg134 are critical for the autocatalytic primary processing of the prosegment and for the subsequent efficient exit of SKI-1 from the endoplasmic reticulum. Functional mapping of the growth factor cytokine receptor motif suggested a folding role within the endoplasmic reticulum. Microsequencing of the remaining membrane-bound stub following ectodomain shedding of SKI-1 localized the shedding site to KHQKLL953↓. Site-directed mutagenesis, in vitro cleavage of a synthetic peptide containing the shedding site, and inhibitor studies favor an autocatalytic event occurring at a non-canonical SKI-1 recognition sequence, with P2 and P1 Leu being very critical. In conclusion, multiple domains ensuring optimal functional characteristics control SKI-1 activity and cellular trafficking. Limited proteolysis at single and pairs of basic residues has now been recognized to be a fundamental process in living organisms.

Mammalian PCs are implicated in the processing of numerous precursors, ranging from polypeptide hormones to growth factors, receptors, and enzymes as well as viral surface glycoproteins. Seven members of the PC family have so far been identified and shown to process these various precursors usually within the consensus sequence (R/K) Xn(R/K)↓, where Xn is the number of spacer amino acids (0, 2, 4, or 6) and X is any amino acid, but not Cys (1.Zhou A.

Finally, in a very recent work, SKI-1 was shown to process the surface glycoprotein (glycoprotein C) of Lassa virus, one of the hemorrhagic fever viruses belonging to the family of Arenaviridae (Table I) (11.Lenz O. ter Meulen J. Feldmann H. Klenk H.D. Garten W. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 11418-11421Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). This was the first case where SKI-1 was directly implicated in an infectious disease. From these results and mutagenesis studies (12.Duncan E.A. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Sakai J. J. Biol.

The emerging critical implication of SKI-1 activity in various cellular functions and in certain pathologies begs for a better understanding of its biosynthesis and activation as well as elucidation of the mechanism of its shedding and the functional contribution of specific domains within its structure. In this study, we aimed first to define the role of prosegment processing in the control of the cellular trafficking and activity of SKI-1. Our data clearly demonstrate the critical importance of Arg130 and Arg134 in the autocatalytic cleavage of pro-SKI-1 (see Fig. 1). We next investigated the shedding site of SKI-1 and showed that the cognate sheddase requires SKI-1 activity. Finally, we attempted to define the possible involvement of two critical residues, viz. Asp858 and Trp861, within the growth factor cytokine receptor (GFCR)-like motif (see Fig. 1) in the control of the rate of cellular trafficking of SKI-1. All oligonucleotides used in the various constructions are listed in Table II. Wild-type human SKI-1 cDNA (3.Seidah N.G. Mowla S.J. Hamelin J. Mamarbachi A.M. Touré B.B. Benjannet S. Basak A.

A V5 epitope (GKPIPNPLLGLDST) (Invitrogen) was fused at the extreme C terminus of SKI-1 by PCR using the sense (S) and antisense (AS) oligonucleotide pair S1/AS1 (Table II). Two-step PCRs were used to introduce point or deletion mutants, except when indicated. The mutated fragments were cloned using the pCRII-Topo TA cloning kit (Invitrogen) and verified by sequencing. For the W861A mutation of the GFCR motif, we first used S2/AS2 and S3/AS3. To obtain the final fragment, we mixed the two purified PCR products and amplified with S2/AS3. For the D848A/W861A mutation of the GFCR motif, we used S2/AS4 and S4/AS3. GFCR was deleted (ΔGly838–Trp861) using S2/AS5 and then S5/AS3. A deletion corresponding to SKI-1 exon XXI (ΔLeu862–Glu901) was constructed using S2/AS6 and S6/AS3. Point mutations in the shedding site of SKI-1 were introduced using S2/AS7 and S7/AS3 for L952V, S2/AS8 and S8/AS3 for L952I, S2/AS9 and S9/AS3 for L952A, S2/AS21 and S17/AS3 for Q950A, S2/AS22 and S18/AS3 for K951A, S2/AS23 and S19/AS3 for L953V, S2/AS24 and S20/AS3 for L953E, and S2/AS25 and S21/AS3 for Q950R. For the K948A mutant, S2/AS10 and S10/AS3 were used. The triple mutation K948A/L952A/L953A was made using the K948A construct as a template for PCR that was mutagenized to K948A/L952A/L953A using S2/AS11 and S10/AS3. A soluble form of SKI-1 ending at amino acid 997, justbefore the predicted transmembranedomain (BTMD), was made using S2/AS12 (the BamHI site at the 5′-end is underlined, and the stop codon is shown in boldface in Table II). For the KDEL construct (dashed sequence in Table II), S2/AS13 was used. The R134E mutant in the proregion was amplified using S11/AS14 and S12/AS15. The R130E mutant was amplified using S11/AS25 and S22/AS15 (the BstEII site at the 5′-end is underlined in Table II). To obtain the double mutant R130E/R134E, we used the R134E construct as a template. PCRs were performed using S11/AS16 and S13/AS15. The oxyanion mutant N338A was made using S14/AS17 (the PstI site at the 5′-end is underlined in Table II) and S15/AS18 (the BglII site at the 5′-end is underlined). The final fragment was amplified using S13/AS18. The active-site mutant H249A was constructed using S14/AS19 and S16/AS18. Deletion of the cytosolic tail (ΔCT, ΔLys1023–Val1052) was undertaken using S2/AS20. In the latter mutant, the V5 epitope was added using the antisense primerGGATCC TCA CGTAGAATCGAGACCGAGGAGAGGGTTAGGGATAGGCTTACCCTCCTGGGTAGCGGCCAG (the BamHI site at the 5′-end is underlined, the stop codon is in boldface, and the V5 nucleotide sequence is in italics). The V5 epitope-tagged versions of the above-mentioned mutants (except for ΔCT) were realized by digesting the 304-nucleotide pIRES2-WTSKI-1.V5-EGFP construct either with PvuI-BamHI and cloning it into untagged forms of mutant SKI-1 cDNAs inserted in pIRES2-EGFP or with NruI-BamHI (827 nucleotides) for the GFCR and exon XXI mutants.Table IISense and antisense oligonucleotides used in the construction of SKI-1 mutantsMutantSenseAntisenseSKI-1-V5ATTGACCTGGACAAGGTGGTGTGGATCC TCA CGTAGAATCGAGACCGAGGAGAGGGTTAGGGATAS1/AS15′-EcoNI and 3′-BamHI underlinedGGCTTACCCACCGAAGGGGTCTTTGGCGGGS2/AS2GTCCTCGGGGCCCCCTTCACGTGCAGAAGTGCAAAGCAGTCS3/AS3GACTGCTTTGCACTTCTGCGCACACCGGCCTTATTCCAAGS4/AS4CGACAGAAGGCATGCTTTGCACTTCTGGATATCCAGAAGTGCAAAGCATG CCTTCTGTCGS5/AS5GCTGAGGGTGGACTTCTGGATGCCCTCCTCCAGGGCATCCAGAAGTCCACCCTCAGCTGGAATCTGS6/AS6GCTGAGGGTGGAGGAAACCATCTTCATCGGTACTCCACCCTCAGCTGGAATCTGS7/AS7CATCAGAAGGTGCTCTCCATTGCAATGGAGAGCACCTTCTGATGS8/AS8ATCAGAAGATACTCTCCATTGCAATGGAGAGTATCTTCTGATGS9/AS9CATCAGAAGGCACTCTCCATTGCTTCTGATGTGCCCAAAGGS10/AS10AACCTTTGGGCACATCAGAAGCTTCTGATGTGCCCAAAGGS11/AS11GGGCGGTAGGCGTGTACGGTGGCAATGGAGGCTGCCTTCTGATGS12/AS12GTCTTCGAATCCCTCAAGGGATCC TCACTCCTGGTTGTAGCGGCCAGS13/AS13GCCCCAAGAAAAAGTCTTCGAATCGGATCC TCACAGCTCGTCCTTCTCCTGGTTGTAGCGGCCAGS14/AS14CAGACACTGCAGGCAGGAGGGATTCGAAGACS15/AS15GCTATTGGCGCCGACGGACCTCCCTCATGCTGGCTATCS16/AS16GTTGGGCGCTGGCACACGGATTCGAAGACTTTTTCTTGGGGCS17/AS17TGGAAACATGCGAAGCTACTCGTCCGTCGGCGCCAATAGCS18/AS18AAACATCAGGCGCTACTCTCCCAGTCAGATCTATGTAGCS19/AS19CAGAAGCTAGTCTCCAATGACCGAATGTGCCAGCGCCCAACS20/AS20CAGAAGCTAGAATCCATTGACGGATCC TCAGTTGATTTGTACCACAAAGAAGS21/AS21TGGAAACATAGGAAGCTACTCGAGTAGCTTCGCATGTTTCCAAS22GGAGAGTAGCGCCTGATGTTTAS23GTCAATGGAGACTAGCTTCTGAS24GTCAATGGATTCTAGCTTCTGS22/AS25CGGTCACCCCCCAAGAAAAAGTCTTCGAAAGACTTTTTCTTGGGGGGTGACCCG Open table in a new tab Transfections of human embryonic kidney cells (HEK293) were made as previously described (14.Benjannet S.

Total cell lysates were divided in two and immunoprecipitated using either anti-calnexin antiserum (against amino acids 50–68 of canine calnexin; 1:250 dilution) (Stressgen Biotech Corp.) or anti-V5 antibody. Immunoprecipitated material was detached by boiling from protein A/G Plus-agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), diluted in nondenaturing buffer, re-precipitated with anti-calnexin antiserum, and resolved by SDS-PAGE. To detect the secreted shed form of hSKI-1 (sSKI-1), HEK293 cells were transfected with wild-type or mutant hSKI-1 constructs. Twenty-four hours post-transfection, cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated for 7 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without serum. The media were concentrated 10-fold using a Microcon-10 (Millipore). Western blot analyses of concentrated media were carried out with Ab:N (1:1000), followed by chemiluminescence detection (ECL, Amersham Biosciences, Inc.).

To test the efficiency of in vitro peptide processing, a 140 μm concentration of each synthetic peptide was used.

V5 epitope-tagged wild-type SKI-1 and its mutants were transfected into HEK293 cells. Two days post-transfection, cells were biotinylated with sulfosuccinimidyl 6-(biotinamido)hexanoate (Pierce) as described (19.Lehmann M. Rigot V. Seidah N.G. Marvaldi J. Lissitzky J.V. Biochem. J. 1996; 317: 803-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Briefly, cell-surface biotinylated lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-V5 antibody, and Western blotting was performed following SDS-PAGE on 5% glycine gel using streptavidin/horseradish peroxidase-coupled IgGs (1:5000) (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). SRD-12B cells were plated on poly-l-lysine-coated microcover glasses (VWR Scientific), cultured for 24 h, and then transfected as described above with SKI-1 and its mutants. Two days post-transfection, cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde for 8 min at room temperature, and then washed twice again. Immunostaining of cells was done as described previously (20.Colley K.J. Lee E.U. Paulson J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7784-7793Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The primary mouse antibody used was either anti-V5 monoclonal antibody (1:500) or rabbit anti-calnexin polyclonal antiserum (1:300); the secondary antibody used was phycoerythrin-conjugated mouse IgGs (1:200) (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc.) to detect V5 epitope-tagged SKI-1 or Cy5-conjugated rabbit IgGs (1:1000) (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) to detect endogenous CHO calnexin. Samples were analyzed on a Zeiss Axiophot 100 confocal microscope. We previously reported three cleavage sites within the prosegment of hSKI-1 (Fig. 1A) at sequences B′ (RKVF133↓), B (RSLK137↓), and C (RRLL186↓) (4.Touré B.B. Munzer J.S. Basak A. Benjannet S.

To determine the importance of the B and B′ sites, we analyzed the processing of wild-type pro-SKI-1 and its P4 Arg mutants R134E and R130E/R134E. We selected these mutants because prosegment cleavage was reported to be autocatalytic, and Arg at P4 has been found to be critical for SKI-1-mediated cleavages (5.Sakai J. Rawson R.B.

To investigate the possibility that cellular processing of mutant prion protein may contribute to the formation of infectious particles, a mouse PrP model system has been established using the green fluorescent protein. Three novel PrP mutants were examined employing this model system and compared with wild type as well as known mutant PrPs. Two Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease-associated PrP mutants, PrP T188K and PrP T188R, revealed a secretory pathway to the cell membrane and PrPSc-like properties,i.e. enhanced proteinase K resistance and detergent insolubility similar to other mutant PrPs associated with familial prion diseases. Moreover, a recently described disease-related truncated PrP mutant, PrP Q160Stop, showed an almost exclusive localization in the nucleus and a catabolism along the proteasomal pathway. Therefore, various distinct pathological mechanisms may cause prion diseases, and aberrant cellular processing may be included in the pathogenesis of prion diseases.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13363-13383Crossref PubMed Scopus (5151) Google Scholar). All inherited prion diseases have been found to segregate with mutations in the coding region of the human prion protein gene (PRNP) on the short arm of chromosome 20. So far, more than 20 mutations have been detected, which are causative for prion diseases, including insertions and point and nonsense mutations. Classically, three heritable forms are distinguished according to their clinicopathological presentation, i.e. familial Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, Gerstmann-Sträussler-Scheinker syndrome, and fatal familial insomnia. These diseases are unique in that they can be inherited as well as transmitted to laboratory animals (via an infectious process), implying that infectious agents, called prions, are formed de novo in affected individuals. Prions consist, at least to a large extent, of a conformationally altered isoform (PrPSc)1of a host-encoded glycoprotein, PrPC. Biochemically, several differences have been described between PrPC and PrPSc, the most prominent being the enhanced proteinase K (PK) resistance of PrPSc and its insolubility in non-denaturing detergents. The cellular function of the prion protein is still not entirely understood, but its localization on the cell membrane makes PrP a possible candidate for a cell adhesion or receptor molecule. Recently, it has been suggested that PrPC may play a role in copper homeostasis and metabolism, since PrP binds copper via its N-terminal peptide repeat region (2Hornshaw M.P. McCermott J.R.

In addition, these data point to a function either in synaptic interaction or in the sensitivity of neurons to oxidative stress (5Brown D.R. Schulz-Schaeffer W.J. Schmidt B. Kretzschmar H.A. Exp.

It remains unclear whether the disease-associated mutants of PrP exert their effects by loss-of-function or gain-of-(dys)function of the protein and whether the resulting pathogenic mechanisms are identical to those in sporadic disease. It has, however, been demonstrated in several studies employing cell culture systems that PrPSc from genetic as well as sporadic cases is very similar with respect to its biochemical characteristics (7Lehmann S.

To examine the fate of PrP in living cells, the green fluorescent protein (GFP) was inserted as a marker into the N terminus of the mouse prion protein (9Prasher D.C Eckenrode V.K. Ward W.W. Pendergast F.G. Cormier M.J. Gene. 1992; 111: 229-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (1767) Google Scholar, 10Chalfie M. Tu Y. Euskirchen G. Ward W.W. Prasher D.C.

Cell. Neurosci. 2001; 17: 521-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). GFP chimeras with wt as well as mutant PrPs were expressed transiently under the control of a tetracycline-inducible promoter in murine neuroblastoma (N2a) cells (11Windl O. Lorenz H. Behrens C. Römer A. Kretzschmar H.A. J. Gen. Virol. 1999; 80: 15-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The mutant PrPs are mouse homologues of human pathogenic PrPs linked to different types of inherited prion diseases (Table I). The translocation and metabolism of the prion proteins were examined biochemically and by means of confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). Thus, aberrant biochemical as well as cellular characteristics could be revealed for newly described PrP mutants, e.g. an exceptional strong nuclear localization of a shortened PrP molecule, which is rapidly degraded through the proteasomal pathway.Table IGFP-PrP mutants and their human PrP homologues with the associated phenotypesGFP-PrP chimera with mouse PrP1-aMouse PrP contains methionine at position 128, which corresponds to codon 129 in human PrP, a polymorphic site encoding either methionine or valine.Human PrPPhenotypeP101LP102LGSSW144Stop1-bMouse and human PrP differ at their corresponding positions.Y145StopGSSQ159StopQ160StopEOD1-cEOD, familial early onset dementia.D177ND178NFFIT187KT188KCJDT187RT188RCJD1-dThe T188R/129V haplotype is linked to CJD.

The murine neuroblastoma cell line N2a (12Klebe R.J. Ruddle F.H. J. Cell Biol. 1969; 43: 69Google Scholar) was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). Generation of the stably transfected N2a cells (N2a-tTA, clones 26 and 29) expressing the tetracycline transactivator (tTA) has been described previously (11Windl O. Lorenz H. Behrens C. Römer A. Kretzschmar H.A. J. Gen. Virol. 1999; 80: 15-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). All cell lines were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum and penicillin/streptomycin in an atmosphere of 10% CO2, 90% air at 37 °C. Transient transfections of N2a and N2a-tTA cells were performed using the Effectene reagent (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. All DNA used for transfections possessed high quality standard (Qiagen) and matched concentrations. Cells were grown for Western blot analysis directly on multi well dishes and, for confocal microscopy studies, on glass coverslips. Construction of pBs-Prnp and phCMV*-Prnp has been described previously (11Windl O. Lorenz H. Behrens C. Römer A. Kretzschmar H.A. J. Gen. Virol. 1999; 80: 15-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The plasmid pBs-GFP-PrP was constructed by inserting the GFP-S65T DNA sequence of vector pS65T-C1 (CLONTECH) in-frame into the SmaI site of the Prnp open reading frame (13Westaway D. Cooper C. Turner S. Da Costa M. Carlson G.A. Prusiner S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6418-6422Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) in pBs-Prnp. The 3′-end of the GFP-S65T-DNA was supplemented by the addition of an 18-base pair oligonucleotide due to cloning constraints. ThePflMI-BamHI fragment of pBs-GFP-PrP was then cloned into the PflMI-BamHI sites of phCMV*-Prnp to yield pGFP-PrP. Details of plasmid constructions are available upon request. P101L (primers 1 and 2), W144Stop (primers 3 and 4), Q159Stop (primers 5 and 6), D177N (primers 7 and 8), T187K (primers 9 and 10), T187R (primers 11 and 12), and E199K (primers 13 and 14) mutations in the mouse prion protein open reading frame were obtained by a PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis method (14Fisher C.L. Pei G.K. BioTechniques. 1997; 23: 570-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar) with pBs-Prnp as template using the following primers: 5′-TCAGCAAACCAAAAACC-3′ (primer 1), 5′-GCTTGTTCCACTGATTA-3′ (primer 2), 5′-CCATTTTGGCAACGACTAGGAGGACCGCTACTACCG-3′ (primer 3), 5′-ATCATGGGCCTGCTCACGGCGCTCCCC-3′ (primer 4), 5′-GTACCGCTACCCTAACTAAGTGTACTACAGGCC-3′ (primer 5), 5′-ATGTTTTCACGGTAGTAGCGGTCCTCCCAGTCG-3′ (primer 6) 5′-AACTGCGTCAATATCACC-3′ (primer 7), 5′-GTGCACGAAGTTGTTCTG-3′ (primer 8), 5′-CCATCAAGCAGCACAAGGTCACCACCACCACC-3′ (primer 9), 5′-TGATATTGACGCAGTCGTGCACGAAG-3′ (primer 10), 5′-GGGTCACCACCACCACCAAG-3′ (primer 11), 5′-TGTGCTGCTTGATGGTGATATTG-3′ (primer 12), 5′-AAGACCGATGTGAAGATG-3′ (primer 13), 5′-GGTGAAGTTCTCCCCCT-3′ (primer 14). TheBsu36I-BamHI fragment of positively mutagenizedPrnp in pBs-Prnp replaced theBsu36I-BamHI-wt PrP fragment of pGFP-wtPrP. Additionally, for permanent expression of GFP-PrP under the control of the strong cytomegalovirus promoter, the plasmid pcGFP-wtPrP was constructed by cloning the EcoRI-HindIII fragment of pBs-GFP-PrP into the EcoRI-HindIII sites of pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen). Transfections of normal N2a cells with pcGFP-wtPrP yielded the same cellular phenotype of GFP-wtPrP as transfections of N2a-tTA cells with pGFP-wtPrP (data not shown). All cloning and mutagenesis events were confirmed by sequence analysis. Typically, cells were lysed 48–72 h post-transfection in 1× TNE buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and 0.2% (w/v) sarcosyl. Equal amounts of total protein were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore). The antiserum Kan72 (15Hölscher C. Delius H. Bürkle A. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 1153-1159Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and the monoclonal antibodies 6H4 (Prionics) and 3B5 (16Krasemann S. Groschup M.H. Harmeyer S. Hunsmann G. Bodemer W. Mol. Med. 1996; 2: 725-734Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were used against murine PrP, all at a dilution of 1:2000, and a monoclonal anti-GFP antibody (CLONTECH) against GFP was used at a dilution of 1:1000 for Western blot applications. Detection of specific signals was accomplished with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit (1:600, Dako) or goat anti-mouse (1:5000, Dianova) serum and visualized by incubation with nitro blue tetrazolium/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Equal amounts of whole cell extracts at equal volumes were PK-digested (5 μg/ml) for 30 min at 37 °C. All digestions were performed in 1×TNE buffer with 0.2% sarcosyl with no protease inhibitors included. Digestions were stopped by the addition of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (2 mm), and proteins were immediately boiled in 1× Laemmli buffer for 5 min and subjected to Western blot analysis. One day before transfection, equal amounts of cells (1 × 106) were passaged to sterile 6-well plates and cultured under normal cell culture conditions. 48 h post-transfection, the cells were washed twice with Hanks' basic salt solution and cultured for 45 min in phosphate-buffered saline containing 1.0 mmCa2+ and 0.5 mm Mg2+. The cell medium was centrifuged at 660 × g for 10 min at 4 °C to discard cell debris, and the proteins in the supernatant were methanol-precipitated with at least 6 volumes of ice-cold methanol for several hours at −20 °C. After centrifugation (20,000 ×g, 10 min, 4 °C), the protein pellets were dissolved in TNE buffer containing 0.2% sarcosyl and subjected to Western blot analysis. To determine the ratio between soluble and insoluble PrP, the cells were lysed 48 h post-transfection in ice-cold buffer containing 100 mmNaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 0.5% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, and 0.5% (w/v) sodium deoxycholate as detergents (17Capellari S. Parchi P. Russo C.M. Sanford J. Sy M.S. Gambeti P. Petersen R.B. Am. J. Pathol. 2000; 157: 613-622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Nine volumes of the same buffer (ice-cold) were added to the whole cell extracts before centrifugation (660 × g, 10 min, 4 °C) to remove nuclei and cell debris. The supernatants were centrifuged at 20,800 × g for 100 min at 4 °C to obtain detergent-soluble (supernatant) and detergent-insoluble (pellet) fractions. After methanol precipitation, both protein fractions were dissolved in lysis buffer and subjected to deglycosylation with peptideN-glycosidase F (New England Biolabs) for better PrP amount discrimination. The extracts were treated with 500 units of peptideN-glycosidase F for 4 h at 37 °C according to the manufacturer's instructions and assayed by Western blot analysis. Equal amounts of cells were passaged into 6-well plates and subjected to transfection with the DNA constructs. 48 h post-transfection, cells were incubated for 5 h in fresh medium in the presence or absence of the indicated inhibitors (30 μm MG-115, 30 μm lactacystin, 30 μm NH4Cl, and 100 μmchloroquine). The proteasome inhibitors MG-115 and lactacystin were from Calbiochem, and chloroquine was from Sigma. Afterward, cells were lysed in TNE buffer containing 0.2% sarcosyl, and cell extracts were subjected to Western blot analysis. Live cell confocal microscopy was performed on Leica TCS confocal systems (Leica TCS NT/SP2). All images were taken with 63 × 0.9NA Achroplan and 40 × 1.3NA Fluar objectives (Carl Zeiss). To study cellular processes, cells were imaged in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium that had been preequilibrated in a 10% CO2 incubator. The cells were maintained on the microscope stage without any gas exchange using a slide chamber fitted for 12-mm round coverslips together with a heating plate. For multi-channel imaging, each fluorescent dye was imaged sequentially in the frame-interlace mode to eliminate cross talk between the channels. GFP fluorescence was excited with a 488-nm argon-ion laser line and imaged using a RSP 500 main beam splitter and a 515-nm longpass filter. Alexa 594 and ceramide TR fluorescence was excited with a 543-nm HeNe laser line and imaged using a double dichroic filter and 590-nm longpass filter settings. All image processing was performed using the Leica TCS NT software; Adobe Photoshop was used to prepare final figures for publication. For co-localization studies, transfected cells were fixed in 3.7% paraformaldehyde, phosphate-buffered saline and permeabilized in 0.2% Triton X-100, phosphate-buffered saline (18Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, New York1988Google Scholar). The primary antibody anti-Golgi 58K protein (1:50, Sigma) was used for immunostaining of the Golgi apparatus, and concanavalin A, Alexa 594 (1 μg/ml, Molecular Probes), was used as ER marker. The protein chimera GFP-wtPrP was created by the insertion of the GFP-S65T DNA sequence between codons 39 and 40 of the wt mouse PrP open reading frame (Fig.1 A). To compare the biosynthesis of the GFP-wtPrP chimera with that of wt PrPC, the expression of both was first examined biochemically. Western blot analysis of transfected recombinant N2a cells (11Windl O. Lorenz H. Behrens C. Römer A. Kretzschmar H.A. J. Gen. Virol. 1999; 80: 15-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) confirmed the synthesis of glycosylated proteins with molecular masses of about 48–58 kDa for GFP-wtPrP and 27–37 kDa for native PrPC. Non-chimeric as well as chimeric PrP could be detected with antibodies against mouse PrP, but GFP-wtPrP could also be recognized by antibodies against GFP (Fig. 1 B). To investigate whether the cellular transport of GFP-wtPrP is comparable with that of the secretory and membrane-bound protein PrPC, the localization of GFP-wtPrP in N2a cells was observed from about 20 h post-transfection by CLSM and assayed by co-localization studies. Thereby, a co-localization of GFP-wtPrP could be detected with an ER marker (Fig. 1 C,upper panel) and most prominently with a Golgi marker (Fig.1 C, lower panel), but no co-localization was detectable with organelle markers for mitochondria, cytoskeleton components, or the nucleus (data not shown). Further observation of post-Golgi transport of GFP-wtPrP revealed the enrichment of fluorescent signals on the cell surface (Fig. 1 D), and prolonged observations (here shown for 48 h post-transfection, but also detectable in long term, stable N2a clones expressing GFP-wtPrP) 2H. Lorenz, unpublished result. confirmed a final GFP-wtPrP signal distribution in transfected N2a cells with prominent localizations in the Golgi apparatus and on the cell membrane (Fig.1 E). To exclude the possibility that even incomplete GFP-PrP chimeras show an identical cellular phenotype like GFP-wtPrP, control fusion proteins were designed carrying either the PrP sequence C-terminally (GFP-PrPΔN) or N-terminally (GFP-PrPΔC) in addition to GFP (Fig. 1 A). Both fusion proteins could be detected in Western blot analysis as truncated and unglycosylated proteins (data not shown) and could furthermore be observed in confocal microscopy studies as homogeneously distributed signals throughout the cytoplasm and the nucleus, similar to the signal distribution of GFP alone (Fig.1 F). To investigate the processing and transport of PrP mutants in N2a cells by this model system, seven GFP-PrP chimeras were constructed that correspond to several distinct mutations in inherited human prion disease (TableI). Among these PrP mutants, there were three, GFP-PrP Q159Stop, GFP-PrP T187K, and GFP-PrP T187R (corresponding to human PrP Q160Stop, T188K, T188R), that have so far never been cellularly examined and which were assayed in this study most intensively. In addition, four cellularly well defined PrP mutants (GFP-PrP P101L, GFP-PrP W144Stop, GFP-PrP D177N, and GFP-PrP E199K as the mouse homologues for human PrP P102L, Y145Stop, D178N, E200K) were used as controls to evaluate the GFP-PrP model system and to extend the existing knowledge about these mutants (7Lehmann S.

After expression in N2a cells, the chimeric PrP missense mutants, i.e. GFP-PrP P101L, GFP-PrP D177N, GFP-PrP T187K, GFP-PrP T187R, and GFP-PrP E199K, were fully glycosylated and synthesized to molecular masses of about 48–58 kDa like the chimera with wt PrP (Fig.2 A). All these glycosylated chimeras were sensitive to deglycosylation by digestion with peptideN-glycosidase F (data not shown), as is the case with native PrP. The glycosylation of the GFP-PrP chimeras is therefore neither blocked by the insertion of GFP nor by the disease-linked point mutations in mouse PrP. In contrast to the missense mutants, the chimeric PrP nonsense mutants GFP-PrP W144Stop and GFP-PrP Q159Stop appeared in Western blot analysis as truncated and double-banded proteins of about 40–42 and 41–43 kDa, respectively (Fig. 2 A). To test full-length chimeric PrP mutants with respect to their resistance against proteolysis, total cell extracts of transfected N2a cells were digested under mild conditions with PK (5 μg/ml, 37 °C, 30 min). Under similar conditions, enhanced PK resistance has been detected for the non-chimeric counterparts of the PrP mutants with amino acid exchanges P101L, D177N, and E199K (7Lehmann S. Harris D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1633-1637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 19Petersen R.B. Parchi P. Richardson S.L. Urig C.B. Gambetti P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12661-12668Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Transfections were carried out under identical conditions, and 72 h post-transfection lysates were prepared and assayed with matched concentrations of total protein in equal volumes (Fig. 2 B). All full-length chimeras with pathogenic mutations were tested and showed an enhanced resistance against PK leading to truncated molecules. All these resistant protein signals were clearly and reproducibly visible in Western blot analysis, indicating that the chimeric PrP mutants also underwent biochemical changes that led to increased PK resistance. To investigate the cellular localization of the PrP mutants, the expression of the chimeras was observed by CLSM. The microscopic examination revealed that the chimeric mutant proteins GFP-PrP P101L, GFP-PrP D177N, GFP-PrP T187K, GFP-PrP T187R, and GFP-PrP E199K showed no difference in localization from GFP-wtPrP (Fig. 2 C). For all of these, fluorescent signals were detectable in the Golgi apparatus and on the cell membrane of N2a cells. These chimeras were trafficked along a secretory pathway like native PrP, and no differences in cellular transport and localization or the level of expression were detected. In contrast to the other chimeras, no fluorescent signals in the Golgi apparatus and on the cell membrane were detectable for the truncated chimeras GFP-PrP W144Stopand GFP-PrP Q159Stop (Fig. 2 C). Expression of the GFP-PrP W144Stop chimera led to a distribution throughout the cytoplasm and the nucleus, whereas the GFP-PrP Q159Stop mutant showed an almost exclusive localization in the nucleus that was clearly distinguishable from GFP-wtPrP but also from GFP-PrP W144Stop. All cellular phenotypes presented here could be confirmed for the chimeric and the corresponding non-chimeric PrPs by immunofluorescence analysis with anti-PrP antibodies (data not shown). The three chimeric PrP mutants GFP-PrP T187K, GFP-PrP T187R, and GFP-PrP Q159Stop were further analyzed with respect to their cellular transport. To investigate the intracellular translocation between ER and Golgi apparatus, the transfected cells were incubated with the fungal metabolite brefeldin A (BFA). BFA reversibly initiates the retrograde transport of Golgi vesicles into the ER, which can be stopped by a washout of the drug that leads to a subsequent reorganization of the Golgi apparatus (21Lippincott-Schwartz J. Yuan L.C. Bonifacino S. Klausner R.D. Cell. 1989; 56: 801-813Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1312) Google Scholar). By using BFA as a cellular tool, secretory proteins could be cycled from the Golgi into the ER and back, which allows the determination and the microscopic observation of the cellular pathway(s) of the GFP-PrP chimeras. Time-lapse observations of the GFP-wtPrP signal distribution in BFA-treated N2a cells revealed the complete disappearance of discrete Golgi signals within 60 min and the appearance of an “ER-typical” signal distribution (Fig. 3 A). This BFA-induced phenotype was also detected in N2a cells expressing GFP-PrP T187K and GFP-PrP T187R (Fig. 3 B) but was never observed for GFP-PrP Q159Stop-expressing cells (Fig. 3 A). Transfected cells showed the redistribution of GFP-PrP T187K and GFP-PrP T187R into the ER in the presence of BFA and a reorganization of discrete fluorescent signals or Golgi signals, respectively, in the absence of BFA, which clearly indicates a secretory pathway along the ER/Golgi complex for these two chimeric PrP mutants (Fig.3 B). In contrast, the chimeric PrP nonsense mutant GFP-PrP Q159Stop showed no effect on BFA incubation of the cells. The signal distribution remained restricted to the nucleus, and no changes in the signal localization occurred even after BFA incubation for up to 20 h (data not shown), indicating that GFP-PrP Q159Stop never entered the Golgi apparatus along its cellular pathway. To investigate the localization of the chimeric PrPs on the cell surface, the transfected cells were incubated with phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (PIPLC), which cleaves GPI-anchored proteins like native PrPC from the cell membrane. During PIPLC treatment for up to 40 min, the GFP-wtPrP-, GFP-PrP T187K- and GFP-PrP T187R-expressing cells showed an ongoing disappearance of the fluorescent signals on the cell surface, whereas no loss of fluorescence was observed for cells expressing GFP-PrP Q159Stop (Fig. 4). To exclude that hypothetically existing membrane-bound GFP-PrP Q159Stop was for some reason not accessible to PIPLC, we applied the protease trypsin into the culture medium and assayed the trypsin digest by Western blot analysis of whole cell extracts. However, whereas high reductions of the protein content were detected for N2a cells expressing the secretory chimeric PrPs, no effect on the protein amount was measurable for GFP-PrP Q159Stop (data not shown). This result supported the confocal recordings that GFP-PrP Q159Stop seemed to be exclusively localized in intracellular compartments without any trafficking along the ER/Golgi complex to the outer-membrane like wt and several mutant PrPs (Fig.2 C). Further examinations of PrP trafficking were carried out with the non-chimeric mouse wt and mutant PrPs. Corresponding to the analysis of the chimeric PrPs, the synthesis of the native PrPs was first examined biochemically. Western blotting revealed that the expression in N2a cells yielded glycosylated wt PrP, PrP T187K, and PrP T187R with molecular masses of ∼27–37 kDa (Fig.5 A). Similar to the chimeric counterparts, double-banded signals could also be detected for the truncated PrP mutants, with molecular masses of ∼14 and16 kDa for PrP W144Stop and 15 and17 kDa for PrP Q159Stop(Fig. 5 A). Therefore, the expression pattern of the native PrPs clearly resembled that of their chimeric homologues and revealed the expected molecular weights of the prion proteins without the GFP portion. To evaluate the amount of secreted PrP of the PrP mutants, transfected cells were cultured in fresh salt solution (physiological) for 45 min, and the proteins in the culture medium were methanol-precipitated and subjected to Western blot analysis. Under these conditions, secretion into the medium could easily be detected for wt PrP, PrP T187K, and PrP T187R but not for PrP W144Stop and PrP Q159Stop(Fig. 5 B), supporting our data that the PrP nonsense mutants were strictly restricted to intracellular regions and, in contrast to the other examined PrPs, not trafficked along a secretory pathway. Identical results were also obtained for the corresponding chimeric PrPs (data not shown). To investigate whether PrP T187K and PrP T187R also exhibit an enhanced PK resistance like many other disease-associated full-length PrP mutants (7Lehmann S. Harris D.A. J. Biol.

However, little is known about the molecular mechanism in detail. We show here that TPO supports the survival of TPO-dependent leukemia cell line UT-7/TPO and normal megakaryocytic progenitors via the induction of Bcl-xL, an anti-apoptotic member of the Bcl-2 family. We further analyzed the signal transduction pathways required for TPO-induced Bcl-xL gene expression. A reporter assay with various lengths of Bcl-x gene promoter revealed that both Stat- and nuclear factor κB-binding sites are prerequisites for TPO-induced promoter activity. Consistent with these results, TPO induced the binding of Stat5 and subunits of nuclear factor κB, p50, and c-Rel to the Bcl-x gene promoter. AG490, a specific inhibitor for Jak2, and LY294002, a specific inhibitor for phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase, reduced the protein level of Bcl-xL in UT-7/TPO cells, accompanied by an increase in the ratio of apoptotic cells. Interestingly, LY294002 enhanced the TPO-induced DNA binding activity of Stat5 without affecting the Jak2 activation and tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat5. Concomitantly, confocal microscopy revealed that LY294002 clearly inhibited the nuclear export of Stat5, suggesting that PI 3-kinase regulates the subcellular localization of Stat5. Taken together, our results suggest that both Jak-Stat and PI 3-kinase activation pathways regulate the TPO-induced survival of megakaryocytic cells via Bcl-xL gene expression. In addition, our data suggest possible cross-talk between these two signaling pathways.

Broudy V.C. Lin N. Jorgensen M.J. McCarty J. Fox N. Zucker-Franklin D. Lofton-Day C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3234-3238Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar, 2Kaushansky K. Blood. 1995; 87: 3065-3067Google Scholar). One of the most important functions of TPO is to support the survival of megakaryocytic lineage cells. Withdrawal of TPO causes the apoptosis of both TPO-responsive cell lines (3Ritchie A. Vadhan-Raj S. Broxmeyer H. Stem Cells. 1996; 14: 330-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) and in immature megakaryocytic progenitor cells (4Osada M. Komeno T. Todokoro K. Takizawa M. Kojima H. Suzukawa K. Ninomiya H. Abe T. Nagasawa T. Exp Hematol. 1999; 27: 131-138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). An animal model study demonstrated that disruption of the TPO gene or its receptor c-mpl gene causes severe thrombocytopenia (5Gurney A. Carver-Moore K. de Sauvage F.J. Moore M.W.

Med. 1996; 183: 651-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). Furthermore, point mutations of c-mpl gene were found in some patients with congenital amegakaryocytic progenitor cells (5Gurney A. Carver-Moore K. de Sauvage F.J. Moore M.W. Science. 1994; 265: 1445-1447Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar, 6de Sauvage F. Carver-Moore K. Luoh S.M. Ryan A. Dowd M. Eaton D.L. Moore M.W. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 651-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). Although it is well recognized that TPO is essential for the survival of megakaryocytic lineage cells, the precise molecular mechanism of how TPO prevents megakaryocytic progenitor cells from apoptosis is still open to question. Bcl-2 family proteins play key roles in the control of programmed cell death by hematopoietic cytokines (7Gross A. McDonnell J.M. Korsmeyer S.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1899-1911Crossref PubMed Scopus (3254) Google Scholar). First, hematopoietic cytokines induce the expression of anti-apoptotic members of these proteins, such as Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL. These anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins protect apoptosis through the inhibition of cytochrome c release from the mitochondria (7Gross A. McDonnell J.M. Korsmeyer S.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1899-1911Crossref PubMed Scopus (3254) Google Scholar). Second, hematopoietic cytokines inhibit apoptosis through phosphorylation of BAD, a pro-apoptotic member of the Bcl-2 family. Phosphorylation of BAD causes altered intracellular distribution and leads to loss of pro-apoptotic function of this protein (8del Peso L. Gonzalez-Garcia M. Page C. Herrera R. Nunez G. Science. 1997; 278: 687-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (1987) Google Scholar). Suppression of pro-apoptotic members of this family, known as BH3-only proteins, is another important function of cytokines to protect hematopoietic cells from apoptosis (9Sanz C. Benito A. Inohara N. Ekhterae D. Nunez G. Fernandez-Luna J.L. Blood. 2000; 95: 2742-2747Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Shinjyo T. Kuribara R. Inukai T. Hosoi H. Kinoshita T. Miyajima A. Houghton P.J. Look A.T. Ozawa K. Inaba T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 854-864Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Thus, although all of these mechanisms are important for cytokine-mediated anti-apoptotic effects, it appears that Bcl-xL plays central roles as a downstream molecule of hematopoietic cytokine signaling. Several lines of evidence support this notion. Bcl-xL is expressed in both CD34+/CD38− multipotent hematopoietic stem cells (11Park J. Bernstein I. Hockenbery D. Blood. 1995; 86: 868-876Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Peters R. Leyvraz S. Perey L. Blood. 1998; 92: 2041-2052Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and committed progenitors having erythroid (13Silva M. Grillot D. Benito A. Richard C. Nunez G. Fernandez-Luna J. Blood. 1996; 88: 1576-1582Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Gregoli P. Bondurant M. Blood. 1997; 90: 630-640Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or monocytic lineage properties (15Sanz C. Benito A. Silva M. Albella B. Richard C. Segovia J.C. Insunza A. Bueren J.A. Fernandez L.J. Blood. 1997; 89: 3199-3204Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Genetic elimination of Bcl-xL genes causes severe deficiency of hematopoietic cells resulting from the increased ratio of apoptotic cells (16Motoyama N. Wang F. Roth K.A. Sawa H. Nakayama K. Nakayama K. Negishi I. Senju S. Zhang Q. Fujii S. Loh D.Y. Science. 1995; 267: 1506-1510Crossref PubMed Scopus (1023) Google Scholar). Bcl-xL expression is mainly regulated by hematopoietic cytokines through the activation of intracellular signal transduction pathways (17Grad J.M. Zeng X.R. Boise L.H. Curr. Opin. Oncol. 2000; 12: 543-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Although a variety of signal transduction molecules are activated by hematopoietic cytokines, recent studies have revealed that Jak-Stat and PI 3-kinase activation pathways mainly regulate Bcl-xL gene expression. In the erythropoietin (EPO)-dependent cell line HCD-57, EPO induced the binding of Stat5 to the consensus Stat-binding sites on the Bcl-x gene promoter (18Silva M. Benito A. Sanz C. Prosper F. Ekhterae D. Nunez G. Fernandez-Luna J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22165-22169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Stat5 is also required for IL-3-dependent survival of Baf-3 cells (19Dumon S. Santos S.C. Debierre-Grockiego F. Gouilleux-Gruart V. Cocault L. Boucheron C. Mollat P. Gisselbrecht S. Gouilleux F. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 4191-4199Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). In contrast, IL-15 induced the binding of Stat6 to the Bcl-xgene promoter in mast cells (20Masuda A. Matsuguchi T. Yamaki K. Hayakawa T. Yoshikai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26107-26113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In addition to these in vitro studies, Stat5a and Stat5b knockout mice also demonstrated that Stat5 is required for Bcl-xL expression in erythroid lineage cells (21Socolovsky M. Fallon A. Wang S. Brugnara C. Lodish H. Cell. 1999; 98: 181-191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar). Another important molecule for Bcl-xL regulation is PI 3-kinase. PI 3-kinase is a key molecule for controlling apoptosis in a variety of cell type. PI 3-kinase prevents cells from apoptosis through a variety of mechanisms. Recently, some reports have shown that PI 3-kinase is involved in the regulation of Bcl-xL expression. Leverrier et al. (22Leverrier Y. Thomas J. Mathieu A.L. Low W. Blanquier B. Marvel J. Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 290-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) reported that PI 3-kinase is required for IL-3- and insulin-like growth factor-1-induced Bcl-xL expression in Baf3 cells. Like these cytokines, TPO activates both Jak-Stat and PI 3-kinase pathways in TPO-dependent cell lines and primary megakaryocytic cells (23Drachman J.G. Sabath D.F. Fox N.E. Kaushansky K. Blood. 1997; 89: 483-492Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Miyakawa Y. Rojnuckarin P. Habib T. Kaushansky K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2494-2502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a recent study has indicated that megakaryocytic progenitor cells express Bcl-xL (25Sanz C. Benet I. Richard C. Badia B. Andreu E.J. Prosper F. Fernandez-Luna J.L. Exp. Hematol. 2001; 29: 728-735Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Taken together, we hypothesized that TPO supports the survival of megakaryocytic progenitor cells through Jak-Stat- and/or PI 3-kinase-dependent Bcl-xL expression. In this study, we examined the role of Bcl-xL in TPO-dependent cell survival. Furthermore, we tried to clarify the role of both Jak-Stat and PI 3-kinase activation pathways in the regulation of Bcl-xL expression and subsequent apoptosis. We show here that Bcl-xL expression is dependent on TPO in TPO-dependent human leukemic cell line UT-7/TPO and megakaryocytic cells. We also show that TPO regulates Bcl-xLgene expression through Jak2-dependent activation of Stat5 and PI 3-kinase-dependent activation of NF-κB. Finally, we show that subcellular localization of Stat5 is in part regulated by PI 3-kinase activity. UT-7/TPO cells were maintained in liquid culture with Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal calf serum (FCS; HyClone Laboratories, Logan, UT) and 10 ng/ml TPO (26Komatsu N. Kunitama M. Yamada M. Hagiwara T. Kato T. Miyazaki H. Eguchi M. Yamamoto M. Miura Y. Blood. 1996; 87: 4552-4560Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recombinant human TPO was provided by the Kirin Brewery Co. (Gumma, Japan). Neomycin (G418) was purchased from Invitrogen. AG490 and LY294002 were purchased from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA). Antisera for p50, p65, and c-Rel of NF-κB subunits were purchased from Rockland (Gilbertsville, PA). Antiserum against Stat1a for the supershift analysis was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). Antisera against Stat3 and Stat5 for the supershift assay were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-phosphotyrosyl Jak2 and anti-phosphotyrosyl Stat5 antibodies were purchased from BIOSOURCE (Camarillo, CA) and Cell Signaling(Beverly, MA), respectively. Antisera against β-actin were purchased from Sigma. Cell lysates were prepared from UT-7/TPO or normal megakaryocytic cells according to the methods previously described (26Komatsu N. Kunitama M. Yamada M. Hagiwara T. Kato T. Miyazaki H. Eguchi M. Yamamoto M. Miura Y. Blood. 1996; 87: 4552-4560Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The cell lysates were resolved by SDS-PAGE and then electroblotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The blots were incubated with an appropriate concentration of primary antibodies including anti-β-actin antibody for internal control and visualized using an enhanced chemiluminescence detection kit (ECL Western blotting analysis system; Amersham Biosciences, Inc., Buckinghamshire, United Kingdom). After stimulation, the cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 2 mm Na3VO4, resuspended in a hypotonic buffer (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 10 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 15 mg/ml aprotinin, 3 mg/ml leupeptin, 3 mg/ml pepstatin, and 2 mm Na3VO4with 0.2% Nonidet P-40), and then homogenized. After centrifugation at 1,000 × g for 5 min, the supernatant was separated from the nuclear pellet and centrifuged at 14,000 × gfor 20 min at 4 °C. The debris was removed, and the supernatants were collected as cytoplasmic extracts. The nuclear pellets were resuspended in hypotonic buffer with 300 mm NaCl, debris was removed by centrifugation (14,000 × g for 20 min), and the supernatants were collected as nuclear extracts. Nuclear or cytoplasmic extracts (5 mg of protein) were incubated for 15 min at 4 °C in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 75 mmKCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1.5 mg of poly(dIC-dAT), 1 mm EDTA, 4% Ficoll type 400 with 2 ng of a32P-labeled oligonucleotide. The samples were loaded on a 5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel, run for 1.5 h at 150 V, vacuum-dried, and exposed to x-ray film. For the supershift study, the nuclear extracts were incubated with antibodies at room temperature for 10 min before the above reaction. The probes were double-stranded oligonucleotides corresponding to the Stat-binding motif on theBcl-xL gene promoter (5′-GACTTTCCGAGGAAGGCATTTCGGAGAAGAC-3′) (21Socolovsky M. Fallon A. Wang S.

For a competition study, the extracts were incubated with a 150-molar excess of the unlabeled probe. Luciferase reporter plasmid containing the mouse Bcl-x gene promoter region, named pGL2–3.2Bcl-x (28Grillot D.A. Gonzalez G.M. Ekhterae D. Duan L. Inohara N. Ohta S. Seldin M.F. Nunez G. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 4750-4757PubMed Google Scholar), was a gift from Dr. Mano (Jichi Medical School, Tochigi, Japan). pGL2–3.2Bcl-x was digested with KpnI to generate pGL2–0.2. pGL2–3.2Bcl-x was also digested with HindIII to generate two fragments. The larger fragment containing pGL2 vector was religated on itself to generate pGL2-Δ0.6. The smaller fragment was subcloned into pGL2basic vector to generate pGL2–0.6. The dominant negative form of Stat3F containing the expression plasmid was a gift from Dr. Nakajima (Osaka City University Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka, Japan) and sheep Stat5F-containing vector was a gift from Dr. Wako (Helix Research Institute, Chiba, Japan). The reporter plasmids were introduced into UT-7/TPO cells by lipofection with the internal control plasmid pRL-TKLUC (Promega, Madison, WI). The UT-7/TPO cells were cytokine-starved for 12 h and then transfected with reporter DNAs. After transfection, the cells were cultured for 12 h without cytokines and stimulated with TPO (100 ng/ml) for 24 h, and the cells were harvested for dual luciferase assay according to the manual (Promega). In some experiments, the expression vectors, pcDNA3.1, pcDNA3.1-Stat3F, or pcDNA3.1-Stat5F were cotransfected. Apoptotic cells were detected according to the manufacturer's instructions. In brief, the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and resuspended in binding buffer. After 15 min of incubation with annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate and propidium iodide, the cell samples were measured by flow cytometry (FACScan, Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ) using a single laser emitting excitation light at 488 nm. Peripheral blood-derived CD34 cells were collected and expanded according to the methods previously described (29Tanaka M. Kirito K. Kashii Y. Uchida M. Watanabe T. Endo H. Endoh T. Sawada K. Ozawa K. Komatsu N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15082-15089Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The purified CD34+ cells were cultured with TPO for 10 days. Then, the cells were cultured with or without TPO for 24 h and harvested for annexin V expression analysis and Western blotting. Cytospin preparations were fixed and permeabilized in PBS containing 4.0% paraformaldehyde and 0.4% Triton X-100 for 20 min at room temperature. After a wash with PBS, the cells were incubated with anti-Stat5 antibody diluted 1:200 in PBS containing 2% FCS and 0.05% Tween 20 at 4 °C overnight. After a second wash with PBS, the cells were incubated for 60 min with Alexa Fluor™ 488 goat anti-rabbit IgG (H+L) conjugate (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) diluted 1:1000. After incubation with RNase (100 μg/ml, Sigma) for 20 min at 37 °C, the cells were stained with propidium iodide (500 nm, Sigma) and mounted in Perma Fluor Aqueous Mountant (Shandon/Lipshaw/Immunon, Pittsburgh, PA). Laser confocal scanning images were obtained using a TCS 4D confocal system (Leica Instruments, Wetzlar, Germany). To clarify the functional role of Bcl-xL and Bcl-2, belonging to the Bcl-2 family, in TPO-dependent cellular survival, we first analyzed the changes in expression level of these proteins after TPO deprivation in UT-7/TPO, which is dependent on TPO for growth and survival. As shown in Fig. 1 A, the UT-7/TPO cells underwent apoptosis after 24-h deprivation of TPO. The amount of Bcl-xL proteins was reduced after 24-h starvation and completely disappeared after 48 h (Fig. 1 B). In contrast, the Bcl-2 protein levels were unchanged even after 48-h starvation. Next, we analyzed whether TPO treatment actually induces the Bcl-xL expression in UT-7/TPO cells. After 24-h starvation, UT-7/TPO cells were cultured with TPO for the indicated periods and then the Bcl-xL expression was analyzed. The amount of Bcl-xL proteins was increased after 12-h TPO stimulation (Fig. 1 C). In contrast, TPO did not affect the expression level of Bcl-2 proteins. These results indicated that TPO-induced cell survival is correlated with Bcl-xL but not Bcl-2 expression in UT-7/TPO cells. To extend the above notion to normal megakaryopoiesis, we examined the effect of TPO deprivation on the expression of Bcl-xL and Bcl-2 using normal human megakaryocytic cells. To obtain a large number of megakaryocytes for Western blotting analysis, we cultured human CD34-positive cells in the presence of TPO for 10 days. More than 90% of the isolated human megakaryocytic cells expressed the specific megakaryocytic markers CD41 and CD61, and 45% of the cells were CD41/CD42b double-positive. Using these highly purified megakaryocytes, we performed Western blotting analysis with anti-Bcl-2 or anti-Bcl-xL antibody. As shown in Fig. 2 A, the megakaryocytic cells expressed both Bcl-xL and Bcl-2 proteins. TPO deprivation reduced the Bcl-xL expression level, accompanied by an increased ratio of annexin V-positive cells (Fig. 2, A andB). In contrast, the Bcl-2 protein level was not affected for 24 h after TPO starvation (Fig. 2 A). These results indicated that Bcl-xL but not Bcl-2 is involved in TPO-dependent survival of normal megakaryocytic cells. Next, we examined whether or not TPO regulates the Bcl-xL expression at the transcriptional level. For this purpose, we used mouse Bcl-xgene promoter constructs fused to a luciferase reporter gene. This construct contains a 3.2-kb genomic fragment upstream of the translation initiation codon of the mouse Bcl-x gene. We introduced this construct into UT-7/TPO cells and assayed the luciferase activity with or without TPO stimulation. As illustrated in Fig. 3, treatment with TPO enhanced the activity of the Bcl-x gene promoter 2.7-fold compared with the FCS treatment. The magnitude was almost the same as other cytokines (18Silva M. Benito A. Sanz C. Prosper F. Ekhterae D. Nunez G. Fernandez-Luna J.L. J. Biol.

Cell. 1999; 98: 181-191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar). Our results indicated that TPO regulates the Bcl-xgene expression through transcriptional control of the Bcl-xgene promoter. To investigate the precise regulatory region required for the TPO-induced Bcl-x gene promoter activity, we prepared a series of mutant reporter plasmids containing a variety of lengths of the Bcl-x gene promoter as illustrated in Fig. 3. We also introduced these mutant reporter plasmids into UT-7/TPO cells and performed a luciferase assay. A proximal 0.6-kb part of theBcl-x gene promoter region was critical for TPO-induced reporter activation. Because this region contains consensus NF-κB- and Stat-binding sites, we hypothesized that NF-κB and/or Stat proteins may work as critical regulators for the Bcl-x gene promoter activity in response to TPO. Based on these observations, we analyzed the role of the Jak-Stat pathway in the regulation of Bcl-xL gene expression. We performed EMSA to investigate whether Stat proteins can bind to the Bcl-xL gene promoter after TPO stimulation, using oligonucleotides corresponding to the Stat-binding motif on the human Bcl-xL gene promoter as probes (21Socolovsky M. Fallon A. Wang S. Brugnara C. Lodish H. Cell. 1999; 98: 181-191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.4 A, TPO clearly induced the formation of DNA-binding complexes in UT-7/TPO cells. Preincubation of the nuclear extracts with a 150-fold molar excess of unlabeled probe inhibited the formation of these DNA binding complexes. To confirm that the DNA binding complex contains Stat proteins, we performed a supershift study with antibodies against Stat1, Stat3, or Stat5. After addition of anti-Stat5 antibody to the nuclear extracts, the DNA binding complex was supershifted (Fig. 4 B). In contrast, neither anti-Stat1 nor anti-Stat3 antibodies had any effects on gel shift retardation. These results indicated that Stat5 specifically binds to the Bcl-xL gene promoter after TPO stimulation. For further investigation, we used AG490, known as a Jak2 inhibitor (30Meydan N. Grunberger T. Dadi H. Shahar M. Arpaia E. Lapidot Z. Leeder J.S. Freedman M. Cohen A. Gazit A. Levitzki A. Roifman C.M. Nature. 1996; 379: 645-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (848) Google Scholar). Treatment with 50 μm AG490 reduced both the Stat5 activation and Bcl-xL expression (Fig. 5,A and B). In addition, AG490 clearly caused apoptosis in approximately half of the AG490-treated UT-7/TPO cells at 50 μm (Fig. 5 C). To confirm that Stat5 is actually involved in the activation of the Bcl-xL gene promoter, we used a dominant negative form of Stat5 in which the tyrosine residue required for dimer formation was mutated to phenylalanine. As shown in Fig. 6, a dominant negative form of Stat5 clearly inhibited the TPO-inducedBcl-xL gene promoter activity. On the other hand, a dominant negative form of Stat3 or vector alone did not affect the promoter activity. These results indicated that Stat5 is required for the TPO-induced Bcl-xL gene promoter activation.Figure 6A dominant negative Stat5 suppresses Bcl-x gene promoter activity. UT-7/TPO cells were starved for 12 h and then transfected with pGL2 3.2bcl-xL vector and pcDNA3.1, pcDNA3.1-Stat3F or pcDNA3.1Stat5F expression vector. PRL-TK vector was used as an internal control. After an additional 12-h incubation, the cells were treated with TPO (black column) or FCS (hatched column). Finally, 24 h later, the cells were harvested for dual luciferase assay. The results are expressed as -fold induction of the luciferase activity from FCS treatment. The values represent the mean ± S.D. from triplicate experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In addition to the Stat-binding motif, the TPO-responsive region on theBcl-x gene promoter also contains the putative NF-κB binding sites (17Grad J.M.

Immunol. 1997; 158: 4750-4757PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 3). Furthermore, several studies have demonstrated that this motif is important for Bcl-xL expression induced by CD40 stimulation in lymphocytes (27Lee H.H. Dadgostar H. Cheng Q. Shu J. Cheng G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9136-9141Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar, 31Andjelic S. Hsia C. Suzuki H. Kadowaki T. Koyasu S. Liou H.C. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 3860-3867Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Thus, we analyzed whether NF-κB also contributes to Bcl-xL expression in TPO signaling by EMSA. The oligonucleotides containing this motif were used as probes (27Lee H.H. Dadgostar H. Cheng Q. Shu J. Cheng G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9136-9141Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). TPO treatment significantly enhanced the binding of a complex to this probe (Fig. 7 A). A supershift study revealed that antibodies against p50 and c-Rel reduced the density of the complex, indicating that the complex contained p50 and c-Rel subunits of NF-κB (Fig. 7 B). We also confirmed that p50 and c-Rel subunits of NF-κB are actually expressed in normal megakaryocytic cells, as in UT-7/TPO cells (Fig. 7 C). Because several cytokines activate NF-κB via PI 3-kinase (32Ozes O.N. Mayo L.D. Gustin J.A. Pfeffer S.R. Pfeffer L.M. Donner D.B. Nature. 1999; 401: 82-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (1898) Google Scholar, 33Romashkova J.A. Makarov S.S. Nature. 1999; 401: 86-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (1667) Google Scholar), we investigated whether TPO-induced NF-κB activation was also mediated by PI 3-kinase. For this purpose, we used a specific PI 3-kinase inhibitor, LY294002, and performed EMSA to detect NF-κB activity. As shown in Fig.8 A, LY294002 effectively inhibited the TPO-induced NF-κB activation at 20 μm. Concomitantly, LY294002 reduced Bcl-xL expression and induced apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner in UT-7/TPO cells (Fig. 8,B and C). However, it required a higher concentration of LY294002 to reduce the Bcl-xL expression level, compared with that required for inhibition of NF-κB (20 μm versus 100 μm). The Bcl-2 expression level was not altered after LY294002 treatment. As described above, PI 3-kinase inhibitor LY294002 reduced the TPO-induced NF-κB activation and protein level of Bcl-xL. Subsequently, LY294002 induced apoptosis in UT-7/TPO cells, although it required a higher concentration compared with that required for the suppression of NF-κB activation. These results prompted us to analyze the effects of LY294002 on Stat5 activation, another important transcription factor to regulate Bcl-xL gene expression as described above. As shown in Fig.9 A, LY294002 clearly enhanced the DNA binding activity of Stat5 in a dose-dependent manner. This enhancement was also observed 3 h after TPO stimulation. However, LY294002 did not affect the TPO-induced Jak2 activation or tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat5 (Fig. 9 B). Based on the evidence that LY294002 enhanced the DNA binding activity of Stat5 without affecting Jak2 activation and Stat5 phosphorylation, we hypothesized that LY294002 may alter the subcellular distribution of Stat5. To confirm this notion, we prepared nuclear extracts for Western blotting analysis with anti-Stat5 antibody. As shown in Fig.9 C, the LY294002 treatment resulted in Stat5 accumulation in the nuclear fraction in a dose-dependent fashion. Furthermore, we analyzed the subcellular distribution of Stat5 using confocal microscopy (Fig.10, A and B). After 24-h depriv"

Whereas small molecule inhibitors PD098095 and U0126 have been used to study MAPK/ERK kinase (MEK), their target selectivity has been questioned recently. The cross-reactivity of ATP-directed inhibitors with other protein kinases prompted us to develop structure-based selective peptide inhibitors of ERK activation. Based on a MEK1-derived peptide, we developed inhibitors of ERK activation in vitroand in vivo.

In addition, cell-permeable peptides inhibited ERK-mediated activation of the transcriptional activity of ELK1.

Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs)1 play a pivotal role in these processes, particularly in stimulus-mediated cellular responses (1Cobb M.H. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1999; 71: 479-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar, 2Kolch W. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 298-305Crossref Google Scholar, 3Wilkinson M.G. Millar J.B. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 2147-2157Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). The activation of these enzymes requires a cascade-like mechanism in which each MAPK is phosphorylated on two amino acid residues (Thr/Tyr) by an upstream protein kinase, MAPKK (MEK), and the latter in turn is phosphorylated on two amino acid residues (Ser/Thr) by a third protein kinase, MAPKK kinase (MEKK). There are at least three such protein kinase modules in mammalian cells as follows: extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs), c-Jun amino-terminal kinases (JNKs), and the p38 MAP kinases (p38). The dual phosphorylation of MAPKs by MEKs is necessary for their activation (4Prowse C.N. Hagopian J.C. Cobb M.H. Ahn N.G. Lew J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 6258-6266Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) and is considered an essential step in the signaling pathways in response to growth factors and mitogenic stimuli, stress-causing agents, and cytokines.For phosphorylation-dependent activation of MAPKs to occur, MAPK must first associate with its cognate upstream kinase, MEK. Thus, disrupting this interaction using a peptide derived from an association domain of either enzyme (5Xu B.E. Wilsbacher J.L. Collisson T. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34029-34035Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 6Tanoue T. Maeda R. Adachi M. Nishida E. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 466-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar) would be predicted to block the activation of the downstream protein kinase. To test this hypothesis, we evaluated the ability of a peptide corresponding to the amino-terminal 13 amino acids of MEK1, which are intimately involved in the association of ERK with MEK (7Bardwell L. Thorner J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 373-374Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 8Tanoue T. Adachi M. Moriguchi T. Nishida E. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 110-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar), to inhibit selectively our target enzyme, ERK, and inhibit ERK activation in cultured mammalian cells.For a peptide to inhibit ERK activation within cultured mammalian cells, the peptide must have access to ERK within the cells. To allow for efficient entry of peptide into cells in culture, we modified the peptide with membrane-translocating moieties. The first modification was the alkylation (myristoylation or stearation) of the inhibitor peptide in order to increase its hydrophobicity and hence its cellular uptake (9Vijayaraghavan S. Goueli S.A. Davey M.P. Carr D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4747-4752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). The second modification was to link a membrane-translocating peptide (MTP) to facilitate the cellular delivery of the peptide. Several MTPs, capable of transporting peptides or even large proteins, have been described recently (10Schwarze S.R. Hruska K.A. Dowdy S.F. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 290-295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar). These include peptides derived from the Drosophila melanogasterantennapedia (Antp) homeotic transcription factor (11Derossi D. Joliot A.H. Chassaing G. Prochiantz A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10444-10450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the human immunodeficiency virus-TAT (TAT) protein (12Fawell S. Seery J. Daikh Y. Moore C. Chen L.L. Pepinsky B. Barsoum J.

Gene Ther. 2000; 7: 750-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar).Here we report that although the free peptide inhibited ERK activation by active MEK in vitro, it did not inhibit ERK activationin vivo presumably because of its inability to cross cellular membranes. Alkylation of the peptide inhibitor facilitated its ability to inhibit ERK activation in vivo with NGF or PMA as activating ligands. Furthermore, linking the peptide inhibitor to a membrane-translocating peptide was also effective in facilitating cellular uptake of the peptide inhibitor and inhibiting ERK activationin vivo.DISCUSSIONBecause MAPKs play a pivotal role in cell signaling and are implicated in a variety of cellular functions, a need for selective and specific inhibitors is warranted to dissect the complex nature of the MAPKs components in the cell. Because most of the available protein kinase inhibitors are directed toward the ATP-binding site, the selectivity of many of such inhibitors has been questioned. The recent advances made in understanding protein-protein interactions and the discovery of protein motifs that are selective in their binding to their targets have spurred interest in the cell signaling field. The use of such specific recognition motifs may be useful in developing specific inhibitors for protein kinases. Furthermore, if such inhibitors can be delivered to their cellular targets in a controllable and direct manner, it will facilitate their use in cell signaling research. We have shown that a peptide derived from the amino terminus of MEK1 (peptide 1) inhibits the in vitroactivation of ERK2 by MEK1 with an IC50 value of 30 μm (Table I). Equilibrium-binding assay using fluorescence anisotropy and a fluorescein-labeled peptide demonstrated direct binding of the peptide to ERK2 with high affinity (77 nm). Because the buffer conditions of this binding assay were dissimilar from buffer conditions used for the inhibition of ERK activation by MEK in vitro and in vivo, there was a much tighter binding affinity determined biophysically (K d) than IC50 value determined from kinetic inhibition assays. Because determination of the value ofK d is dependent on anisotropy values measured at saturating protein concentrations, which we could not achieve in our protocol for the enzyme, this value of K d should be regarded as an estimation of the in vitro binding affinity. To demonstrate further the interaction of ERK2 with these peptides, we show that these peptides were able to coimmunoprecipitate ERK2 with fluorescein-labeled peptide using an anti-fluorescein antibody.Although peptide 1 inhibited ERK2 activation by MEK1, this peptide was not capable of inhibiting ERK activation in cultured mammalian cells (Table I), presumably because of its inability to cross the cellular membrane. Fluorescein-labeled peptide 1 was not detected (by either microscopy or flow cytometry) in cells treated with 100 μm labeled peptide 1 (Table I). To investigate further the effect of this peptide on ERK activationin vivo, it was necessary to modify the peptide to facilitate its cellular uptake.Alkylated PeptidesConjugation of the peptide to stearic acid did not adversely affect the inhibitory potency of the peptide in vitro (Fig. 2 A). The stearated peptide 2inhibited ERK2 phosphorylation in a concentration-dependent manner with an IC50 value of 2.5 μm (Table Iand Fig. 2 B), which is equally effective or more effective than the MEK1 inhibitors PD098059 or U0126. Similar results were obtained when the peptide was myristoylated (data not shown). The alkylated forms of the peptide were also selective, as no inhibition of p38 and JNK was observed, even at 100 μm of peptide2 (Fig. 2 C).Alkylated MEK-derived peptides 2 and 3 entered cells and potently inhibited the activation of ERK1 and ERK2 with IC50 value of 13 μm; the non-alkylated peptide 1 had no effect on the activation of ERK1 and ERK2 in NGF-stimulated PC12 cells (Table I). When the alkylated peptides were incubated for periods of 15 and 30 min before the addition of NGF, both the stearated peptide 2 and myristoylated peptide3 inhibited the activation of ERK1 and ERK2; however, the stearated peptide was more effective than the myristoylated peptide at shorter duration (15 min) (data not shown). It is noteworthy that stearation of unrelated peptide such as a cAMP-dependent protein kinase anchoring protein-derived peptide (9Vijayaraghavan S. Goueli S.A. Davey M.P. Carr D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4747-4752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar) did not inhibit ERK activation in vivo.MTP-linked PeptidesBecause MTPs have been successfully used as carrier of other cargo peptides (10Schwarze S.R. Hruska K.A. Dowdy S.F. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 290-295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar, 11Derossi D. Joliot A.H. Chassaing G. Prochiantz A. J. Biol.

Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 474-477PubMed Google Scholar), it was of interest to compare the effectiveness of alkylation as a mean to deliver peptide inhibitors to cellular targets with the effectiveness of ligation to MTPs. Toward this goal, we synthesized peptides containing four different MTPs combined with the sequence of peptide 1, and we tested these peptides for their ability to enter cells as well as for their inhibitory potency in vitro and in vivo. All MTP-linked peptides were inhibitory in vitrowith IC50 values between 0.21 and 30 μm, except peptide 8 (Table I), indicating that the fusion of the carrier peptides did not adversely affect its potency to inhibit ERK activation by MEK. The latter peptide (peptide 8) consists of the HBV-derived MTP peptide linked to the carboxyl terminus of the inhibitory peptide and had an IC50 value of over 100 μm. Interestingly, when this HBV-derived MTP is linked to the amino terminus of the inhibitory peptide, the resulting peptide7 is a 4-fold more effective inhibitor (7 μm) than the free peptide 1, suggesting that the orientation of the HBV-derived carrier peptide in relation to the peptide inhibitor can alter its potency. Peptide 7 is a potent inhibitor of ERK activation in vitro but does not inhibit JNK or p38 activation (Fig. 2 D), indicating its specificity for ERK.Subcellular Localization of MTP-linked Inhibitory PeptideWhen peptides derived from Antp or TAT were used as carriers of the inhibitory peptide, the resulting fusion peptides (4 and 5, respectively) were effective at penetrating intact cells and acting as inhibitors of ERK activation. Cellular uptake of the peptides was first assessed by epifluorescence and confocal microscopy (see Supplemental Material Fig. S1A). Both the PC12 and NIH 3T3 cells took up the fluorescein-labeled peptides 4 and 5 from the media and remained fluorescent for up to 30 min after washing away excess peptide with the culture medium (data not shown).For the inhibitory peptide to act in vivo, the peptide must colocalize with ERK in the cytosol. Thus, we compared the cellular distribution of ERK to that of peptides 4 and 5using confocal microscopy. Peptide 4 was internalized by the cell and was present in the cytosolic compartment and was not confined to the surface of the plasma membrane (see Supplemental Material Fig. S1A). We also showed that fluorescein fluorescence of labeled peptide was in the same focal plane as fluorescence associated with antibodies reactive with total ERK, and the distribution of ERK within the cells was similar to that of peptides. However, the activated ERK localizes to the nucleus more than does peptide4 (see Supplemental Material Fig. S1B). Thus, the similar localization patterns of ERK and peptide 4 indicate internalization of peptide 4 and suggest a greater association with the inactive form of ERK. Similar results were obtained with peptide 5 (not shown).To confirm the relative abilities of peptides to enter cells, we analyzed peptide-treated cells with fluorescence-activated flow cytometry (see Supplemental Material Fig. S1C and S1D). Fluorescently labeled peptides 4 or5 were effectively taken up by NIH 3T3 cells, and cells become highly fluorescent (100-fold more fluorescent than untreated cells) when incubated with peptides 4 and 5. Because the cells were permeabilized after fixation prior to observation, this increase in fluorescence could not be due to free fluorescein trapped within the cells. Peptides 4 and5 were retained within the cells during the wash steps to remove excess peptide from the cellular media (∼20 min). The other MTP-conjugated peptides 6–8 were not taken up by cells as judged by flow cytometry. Thus, even though peptides 6 and7 were effective in inhibiting ERK2 activation by MEK1in vitro, they were not useful inhibitors in intact cells due to their inability to enter cells (Table I). We also show that the ability of peptides 4 and 5 to penetrate cells was not dependent on the cell cycle because all cells, regardless of DNA content, were able to take up peptides 4 and5.Two lines of evidence indicate that cellular uptake of peptides is saturable. First, the uptake of the Antp-conjugated peptide4 by PC12 cells saturates at an extracellular concentration of 100 μm, and at saturating concentrations, peptide4 entered cells to about 4 pmol per 1 μg of cellular protein. This value corresponds to a 400 μm internal concentration assuming 110 pg of protein per cell and a volume of 1.4 pl per cell. The 4-fold enhancement over the external peptide concentration of 100 μm is similar to the level of peptide enrichment (∼5-fold) reported earlier for other cell-permeable peptides (17Fischer P.M. Zhelev N.Z. Wang S. Melville J.E. Fahraeus R. Lane D.P. J. Pept. Res. 2000; 55: 163-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 18Ho A. Schwarze S.R. Mermelstein S.J. Waksman G. Dowdy S.F. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 474-477PubMed Google Scholar). Second, when NIH 3T3 cells were pretreated with unlabeled peptide 5, followed by the addition of the fluorescein-labeled peptide 5, the labeled peptide was taken up significantly less by cells. Because the labeled peptide was shown to enter the cells at this concentration (1.0 μm), it is apparent that the peptide entered the cells in a selective and saturable manner. Dowdy and co-workers (18Ho A. Schwarze S.R. Mermelstein S.J. Waksman G. Dowdy S.F. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 474-477PubMed Google Scholar) have observed a free diffusion of human immunodeficiency virus-TAT peptide into and out of cells without apparent saturation. We suspect that the observed saturation phenomenon and retention within cells of our peptide is a result of peptide binding to ERK within cells. Because ERK concentration is less than that of the peptide retained within cells, it is possible that the peptide may bind to other cellular proteins.Inhibition of ERK Activation by MTP-linked Peptides in VivoTo demonstrate that peptides 2, 4, and5 inhibit ERK activation in both NIH 3T3 and PC12 cell lines, cells were treated with a range of peptide concentrations prior to stimulation. Peptide 2 inhibited the activation of ERK in NGF-stimulated PC12 cells in a concentration-dependent manner with an IC50 value of 13 μm, with no effect on the total amount of ERK. Similarly, peptides 4 and5 inhibited ERK activation in cells with IC50values of 45 and 29 μm, respectively; however, other peptide conjugates 6 and 7 that did not permeate cells (see above) were not able to inhibit MAPK activation (Table I). Thus, the effectiveness of these peptides in inhibiting ERK activationin vivo correlates well with their ability to enter the cells.Similar to the alkylated peptides 2 and 3, inhibition of ERK activation by the MTP-linked peptide 4 or5 shows a time dependence. Inhibition of ERK activation is more significant with longer preincubation times. PC12 cells were incubated with peptide 4 for varying times prior to a 5-min stimulation with NGF. Inhibition by peptide 4 or5 gradually increases with time reaching a maximum after 40 min, with a half-inhibition time of ∼15 min. However, the increase in fluorescence in cells treated with peptides 4 or5 occurred under 5 min. This lag period before inhibition of ERK activation may be required for the diffusion of the peptide to ERK and/or the disruption of pre-existing MEK·ERK complexes.MTS-linked Peptide Effect on the Activation of Transcription Factor ELK1 in VivoFinally, we have shown that the MTP not only inhibited ERK activation in vivo, but it also inhibited ERK-mediated effects such as the phosphorylation of the transcription factor ELK1. The doubly transfected cells contain GAL4 DNA binding domain fused to ELK1 transactivation domain, and firefly luciferase as reporter that is controlled by a promoter that responds to GAL4/ELK1 fusion protein. These cells respond to extracellular stimuli such as PMA, EGF, and serum that affects the ERK activation by increasing the phosphorylation of ELK1 and luciferase activity. Elegant studies using this approach demonstrated a strong correlation between phosphorylation of ELK1 by ERK and ELK1 transcriptional activity (15Yang S.-H. Yates P.R. Whitmarsh A.J. Davis R.J. Sharrocks A.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 710-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). The addition of peptide 5 to cells before stimulation with a combination of PMA, EGF, and FBS abrogated the effect of these stimuli to activate ERK and luciferase expression (Fig. 4). In fact, peptide 5 was as effective as the commonly used inhibitor U0126. It was proposed that MEK functions not only as a direct activator of ERK but also as a cytoplasmic anchoring protein for ERK (19Fukuda M. Gotoh Y. Nishida E. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1901-1908Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar, 20Adachi M. Fukuda M. Nishida E. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 849-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). The phosphorylation of ERK by MEK leads to the weakening of ERK/MEK interaction and dissociation of the two enzymes followed by translocation of ERK to the nucleus (19Fukuda M. Gotoh Y. Nishida E. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1901-1908Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar, 20Adachi M. Fukuda M. Nishida E. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 849-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Based on our data (Supplemental Material Fig. S1A and S1B and Fig. 4), it is likely that the MEK-derived peptide binds to ERK preventing its association with MEK and thus inhibiting ERK phosphorylation. Our results also show that phosphorylation of ERK, which is a prerequisite for its activity is necessary for phosphorylation of ELK1 and ELK1 transcriptional activity. It appears that the peptide not only inhibited ERK phosphorylation in vitro and in vivo but it also inhibited its translocation to the nucleus to activate ELK1 transcriptional activity. Thus, the peptide is not only specific for inhibition of ERK activation by MEK (as shown by lack of inhibition of JNK and p38), but it also inhibits downstream effectors that are dependent on activated ERK.Because commercially available organic inhibitors are directed toward the ATP-binding site of protein kinases, the specificity of these inhibitors has been questioned recently (21Davies S.P. Reddy H. Caivano M. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 95-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (3916) Google Scholar). Peptide 5, however, was designed to inhibit specifically the interaction between ERK and MEK, and thus it can be used to study selectively the effect of downstream effects of ERK activation. We are currently pursuing similar studies where ERK activation is required. These peptide inhibitors can be used as a reliable diagnostic tool to study cellular signaling pathways where ERK activation is involved.Conclusionswe have demonstrated that peptide 1, derived from the amino terminus of MEK1 in the ERK-interacting domain, served as a basis for the design of selective inhibitors of ERK activation in vivo. Peptide inhibitors have the added benefit of providing information about biologically relevant interactions. Our approach of designing inhibitors of ERK activation using cell-permeable, domain-specific interacting peptides offers several advantages over existing approaches. The selectivity of small molecule inhibitors has been questionable, and some are found not to be useful when tested rigorously (21Davies S.P. Reddy H. Caivano M. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 95-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (3916) Google Scholar, 22Mody N. Leitch J. Armstrong C. Dixon J. Cohen P. FEBS Lett. 2001; 502: 21-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). The use of in vivoexpression of transfected genes as a tool to interfere with signaling pathways has been severely limited by inability to quantitatively deliver the exact amount of inhibitor. Furthermore, the cell-permeable peptide inhibitor approach makes it feasible for applications in large scale studies when compared with microinjection of peptide inhibitors into cells individually.The cell-permeable peptide inhibitors we have developed can be used to dissect cellular responses that involve ERK activation in response to extracellular stimuli. It is noteworthy that other protein kinase inhibitors that are directed to the ATP-binding site do not have the desired specificity (21Davies S.P. Reddy H. Caivano M. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 95-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (3916) Google Scholar, 22Mody N. Leitch J. Armstrong C. Dixon J. Cohen P. FEBS Lett. 2001; 502: 21-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Our approach can be used to develop similar cell-permeable inhibitors of other MAPK pathways such as JNK and p38. In fact, during the preparation of this work for publication, others (23Bonny C. Oberson A. Negri S. Sauser C. Schorderet D.F. Diabetes. 2001; 50: 77-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar) used a similar approach to develop an inhibitor of JNK activation composed of a TAT-linked peptide derived from JNK-interacting protein. Several anchoring proteins that have specific recognition motifs to protein kinases in the MAPK-signaling pathways have been reported (24Pawson T. Scott J.D. Science. 1997; 278: 2075-2080Crossref PubMed Scopus (1887) Google Scholar, 25Yasuda J. Whitmarsh A.J. Cavanagh J. Sharma M. Davis R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7245-7254Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). Such motifs can be used to design and develop selective and specific inhibitors for individual MAPK pathways. We are currently undertaking efforts to screen peptide libraries for a more potent inhibitor based on this inhibitor prototype. Protein phosphorylation plays a critical role in cellular signaling in response to a variety of hormones, growth factors, neurotransmitters, and a wide range of stimuli. Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs)1 play a pivotal role in these processes, particularly in stimulus-mediated cellular responses (1Cobb M.H. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1999; 71: 479-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar, 2Kolch W. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 298-305Crossref Google Scholar, 3Wilkinson M.G. Millar J.B. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 2147-2157Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). The activation of these enzymes requires a cascade-like mechanism in which each MAPK is phosphorylated on two amino acid residues (Thr/Tyr) by an upstream protein kinase, MAPKK (MEK), and the latter in turn is phosphorylated on two amino acid residues (Ser/Thr) by a third protein kinase, MAPKK kinase (MEKK). There are at least three such protein kinase modules in mammalian cells as follows: extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs), c-Jun amino-terminal kinases (JNKs), and the p38 MAP kinases (p38). The dual phosphorylation of MAPKs by MEKs is necessary for their activation (4Prowse C.N. Hagopian J.C. Cobb M.H. Ahn N.G. Lew J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 6258-6266Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) and is considered an essential step in the signaling pathways in response to growth factors and mitogenic stimuli, stress-causing agents, and cytokines. For phosphorylation-dependent activation of MAPKs to occur, MAPK must first associate with its cognate upstream kinase, MEK. Thus, disrupting this interaction using a peptide derived from an association domain of either enzyme (5Xu B.E. Wilsbacher J.L. Collisson T. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34029-34035Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 6Tanoue T. Maeda R. Adachi M. Nishida E. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 466-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar) would be predicted to block the activation of the downstream protein kinase. To test this hypothesis, we evaluated the ability of a peptide corresponding to the amino-terminal 13 amino acids of MEK1, which are intimately involved in the association of ERK with MEK (7Bardwell L. Thorner J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 373-374Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 8Tanoue T. Adachi M. Moriguchi T. Nishida E. Nat.

Based on sequence homology to murine SPP1, we cloned the human homolog. Transfection of human embryonic kidney 293 and Chinese hamster ovary cells with murine or human SPP1 resulted in marked increases in SPP1 activity in membrane fractions that were used to examine its enzymological properties. Unlike other known type 2 lipid phosphate phosphohydrolases (LPPs), but similar to the yeast orthologs, mammalian SPP1s are highly specific toward long chain sphingoid base phosphates and degrade S1P, dihydro-S1P, and phyto-S1P. SPP1 exhibited apparent Michaelis-Menten kinetics with S1P as substrate with an apparent Km of 38.5 μmand optimum activity at pH 7.5. Similar to other LPPs, SPP1 activity was also independent of any cation requirements, including Mg2+, and was not inhibited by EDTA but was markedly inhibited by NaF and Zn2+. However, SPP1 has some significantly different enzymological properties than the LPPs: the aliphatic cation propanolol, which is an effective inhibitor of type 1 phosphatidate phosphohydrolase activities and is only modestly effective as an inhibitor of LPPs, is a potent inhibitor of SPP1; the activity was partially sensitive to N-ethylmaleimide but not to the thioreactive compound iodoacetamide; and importantly, low concentrations of Triton X-100 and other non-ionic detergents were strongly inhibitory. Thus, in agreement with Cluster analysis which shows that outside of the consensus motif there is very little homology between SPP1s and the other type 2 lipid phosphohydrolases, SPP1s are significantly different and divergent from the mammalian LPPs.

Prostaglandins. 2001; 64: 135-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Interest in S1P has increased recently with the discovery that it is the ligand for specific G protein-coupled receptors, known as the EDG-1 or S1PR family (1Pyne S. Pyne N.J. Biochem. J. 2000; 349: 385-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar, 2Spiegel S. Milstien S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1484: 107-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 3Goetzl E.J.

To date, there are five members, EDG-1 (S1P1), EDG-3 (S1P3), EDG-5 (S1P2), EDG-6 (S1P4), and EDG-8 (S1P5). These receptors are expressed ubiquitously and couple to diverse G proteins and thus regulate different biological processes depending on the pattern of expression of the receptors themselves and the various G proteins (1Pyne S. Pyne N.J. Biochem. J. 2000; 349: 385-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar, 2Spiegel S. Milstien S. Biochim. Biophys.

There is also abundant evidence that S1P can function as a second messenger important for regulation of calcium homeostasis (5Mattie M. Brooker G. Spiegel S. J. Biol.

However, the intracellular targets of S1P have not yet been identified. Moreover, it has recently been shown that S1P generated intracellularly by platelet-derived growth factor stimulation of sphingosine kinase can activate EDG-1 and that this event is critical for directional migration toward platelet-derived growth factor (13Hobson J.P. Rosenfeldt H.M. Barak L.S. Olivera A. Poulton S. Caron M.G. Milstien S. Spiegel S. Science. 2001; 291: 1800-1803Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). Cellular levels of S1P are low and regulated by the balance between synthesis by sphingosine kinase-catalyzed phosphorylation of sphingosine and degradation by an endoplasmic S1P lyase and also by ill defined phosphohydrolase activities. Several mammalian lipid phosphate phosphohydrolases have been characterized previously (14Brindley D.N. Waggoner D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24281-24284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 15Stukey J. Carman G.M. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 469-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Type 1 phosphatidate phosphohydrolase (PAP) is sensitive to inhibition by sulfhydryl reagents (most notably N-ethylmaleimide (NEM)) and displays a requirement for Mg2+. In contrast, the type 2 lipid phosphate phosphohydrolases (LPPs) are magnesium-independent, membrane-associated phosphatases that share sequence conservation and NEM insensitivity (14Brindley D.N. Waggoner D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24281-24284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). In mammals, there are three isoforms of type 2 LPPs, known as LPP1/PAP2a, LPP3/PAP2b, and LPP2/PAP2c (14Brindley D.N. Waggoner D.W. J. Biol.

Although specific biological roles for these LPPs have not yet been established, wunen, the Drosophila gene that encodes a homolog of PAP2c and PAP2a, negatively regulates primordial germ cell migration (18Zhang N. Zhang J. Purcell K.J. Cheng Y. Howard K. Nature. 1997; 385: 64-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). However, PAP2c homozygous null mice were viable, fertile, had no obvious phenotypic defects and thus were not informative (19Zhang N. Sundberg J.P. Gridley T. Genesis. 2000; 27: 137-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The mammalian LPPs do not appear to be specific phosphatases and are active with various related phosphorylated lipids including phosphatidic acid, lysophosphatidic acid, ceramide 1-phosphate, and diacyglycerol pyrophosphate, as well as with S1P (14Brindley D.N. Waggoner D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24281-24284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Recently, two genes were identified in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, LBP1/YSR2/LCB3 and LBP2/YSR3, which encode specific sphingoid base phosphate phosphatases that regulate the levels of phosphorylated sphingoid bases and ceramide (20Mandala S.M.

In this study, we have cloned the human homolog of mSPP1. Extensive characterization of the enzymological properties of mammalian SPP1s revealed that although like LPPs, they are magnesium-independent, mammalian SPP1s and LPPs have significant differences, suggesting that they are evolutionarily divergent.

The cell lysate was then centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h to obtain cytosol and total membrane fractions. The total membrane fraction was resuspended in 200 μl of buffer A and protein concentration determined with the Bradford reagent. 32P-Labeled S1P, dihydro-S1P, and phyto-S1P were prepared by incubating sphingosine, dihydrosphingosine, and phytosphingosine, respectively, with [32P]ATP and recombinant sphingosine kinase 1 as described previously (26Van Brocklyn J.R. Spiegel S. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 312: 401-416Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, phosphorylation reactions were carried out using 1 ml of sphingosine kinase buffer (0.1 m Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1 mm2-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mmMgCl2, 1 mm NaVO3, 15 mm NaF, 10 μg/ml leupeptin/aprotinin, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mm 4-deoxypyridoxine, 40 mm β-glycerophosphate, and 20% glycerol) containing 50 μm sphingoid base, 100 μg of protein from recombinant kinase extracts (26Van Brocklyn J.R. Spiegel S. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 312: 401-416Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and 300 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (3,000 Ci/mmol). After 1 h at 37 °C, the reaction was stopped by the addition of 20 μl of 1 n HCl.32P-Labeled long chain sphingoid base was then extracted into the organic phase by the addition of 1.6 ml of CHCl3/MeOH/concentrated HCl (100/200/1), 1 ml of 2m KCl, and 1 ml of CHCl3, then isolated by basic extraction into the aqueous phase by the addition of 2 ml of MeOH, 1 ml of CHCl3, 2 ml of 2 m KCl, and 100 μl of NH4OH. The aqueous phase was transferred to a new tube, and 3 ml of CHCl3 and 200 μl of concentrated HCl were added to extract 32P-labeled products back to the organic phase. 3H-Labeled S1P and dihydro-S1P were prepared by incubating [3H]sphingosine or [3H]dihydrosphingosine with ATP and yeast sphingosine kinase as described previously (27Im D.S. Heise C.E. Ancellin N. O'Dowd B.F. Shei G.J. Heavens R.P. Rigby M.R. Hla T. Mandala S. McAllister G. George S.R. Lynch K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14281-14286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). SPP1 activity using [32P]S1P as substrate was determined as described previously with minor modifications (23Mandala S.M. Thornton R. Galve-Roperh I. Poulton S. Peterson C. Olivera A. Bergstrom J. Kurtz M.B. Spiegel S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7859-7864Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Briefly, SPP1 activity was determined at 37 °C by adding 32P-labeled S1P (10 μm, 100,000 cpm, 0.3% BSA complex) to membrane fractions (4 μg) in 200 μl of buffer A incubated at 37 °C. Reactions were stopped after 30 min by the addition of 2.5 volumes of water-saturated butan-1-ol and 1.5 volumes of 1.5 m KCl. The upper phases were then extracted three times with 2.5 volumes of 1.5 m KCl. The remaining labeled S1P was measured by liquid scintillation counting of the radioactivity in the upper phases. Analysis of the reaction products by TLC on Silica Gel G60 with methanol/chloroform/acetone/acetic acid/water (10:4:3:2:1, v/v) as solvent confirmed the specificity of the reactions. SPP1 activity is expressed as nmol of S1P degraded/min/mg of protein. In some experiments, SPP1 activity using [3H]S1P or [3H]dihydro-S1P as substrate was determined as described previously (20Mandala S.M. Thornton R. Tu Z. Kurtz M.B. Nickels J. Broach J. Menzeleev R. Spiegel S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 150-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). In brief, phosphatase activity was measured in 200 μl containing 50 mm KPO4 (pH 7.2), 0.02% tergitol Nonidet P-40, 2 μm [3H]S1P or [3H]dihydro-S1P (40,000 cpm), 2 mmsemicarbazide, and 1.5 μg of membrane protein. After a 60-min incubation at 37 °C, the assay was terminated with 200 μl of 7m NH4OH. One ml of chloroform:methanol (3:2) was added, and 50 μl of the chloroform layer was counted by liquid scintillation. Similar results were obtained by measurement of disappearance of labeled S1P or by formation of labeled sphingosine. S1P in methanol was transferred to a test tube and dried under a stream of nitrogen. Triton X-100/S1P-mixed micelles were prepared by adding Triton X-100 to the tubes and vortexing. The S1P concentration in Triton X-100/phospholipid-mixed micelles did not exceed 15 mol% to ensure that the structure of the micelles was similar to that of pure Triton X-100 (28Furneisen J.M. Carman G.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1484: 71-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). For investigations of the dependence of enzyme activity on the surface concentration of S1P, the substrate concentration was held constant at 50 μm, and the detergent concentration was varied. Equal amounts of protein were separated on 10% SDS-PAGE and electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membranes for 1 h at 100 V and 4 °C. Blots were blocked in 5% nonfat dry milk in TBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 (TBST) for 2 h at room temperature and probed with anti c-Myc monoclonal antibody or with anti-mSPP1 polyclonal antibody (1763), in the same buffer. After washing three times with TBST, blots were incubated with secondary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature. Protein bands were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence using Super Signal (Pierce). Previously, it has been found that endogenous LPP and SPP1 activity of HEK 293 cells was very low (17Alderton F. Darroch P. Sambi B. McKie A. Ahmed I.S. Pyne N. Pyne S. J. Biol.

HEK 293 cells stably transfected with mSPP1 showed a marked increase in SPP1 activity compared with vector-transfected cells. In agreement with previous results (23Mandala S.M. Thornton R. Galve-Roperh I. Poulton S. Peterson C. Olivera A. Bergstrom J. Kurtz M.B. Spiegel S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7859-7864Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), SPP1 activity was exclusively in the membrane fraction, and vector-transfected HEK 293 cells had low levels of activity (Fig. 1 A). Additional evidence demonstrating the expression of c-Myc-SPP1 in membrane fractions was obtained by Western blot analysis with an antibody that recognizes an internal peptide (CTKDIIRWPRPASPP). As shown in Fig.2, a band with an apparent molecular mass of 47 kDa was specifically immunostained in mSPP1-transfected cell lysates and was absent in vector-transfected cells. Immunocomplex formation was blocked by the internal peptide (Fig. 2), demonstrating the specificity of this antibody. The molecular mass of 47 kDa is in agreement with the value calculated from the predicted amino acid composition containing the c-Myc tag (23Mandala S.M. Thornton R. Galve-Roperh I. Poulton S. Peterson C. Olivera A. Bergstrom J. Kurtz M.B. Spiegel S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7859-7864Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). As expected, this band was also detected with anti-c-Myc monoclonal antibody. It should be noted that the presence of the c-Myc epitope tag had no significant effect on activity or membrane distribution of the recombinant protein (data not shown).Figure 2Immunoblot analysis of mSPP1 expression.Membrane and cytosolic fractions (40 μg of proteins) from HEK 293 cells transfected with vector (lanes 1, 3,5, 7, 9, and 11) or c-Myc-mSPP1 (lanes 2, 4, 6,8, 10, 12) were resolved by SDS-PAGE and then immunoblotted with a monoclonal c-Myc antibody (Ab) or a polyclonal antibody 1763 directed against a specific internal peptide. Where indicated, the peptide CTKDIIRWPRPASPP was preincubated with the antibody prior to immunoblot analysis.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In agreement with our previous study using mSPP1 from transiently transfected cells (23Mandala S.M.

In contrast, LPP1, LPP2, and LPP3 are broad specificity lipid phosphate phosphatases that readily catalyze the dephosphorylation of all of these structurally different lipid phosphates (14Brindley D.N. Waggoner D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24281-24284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 16Roberts R. Sciorra V.A. Morris A.J. J. Biol.

Chem. 2001; 276: 13452-13460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). SPP1 activity in membrane fractions determined with a concentration of 50 μm S1P was 5-fold greater (26.85 ± 3.1 nmol/min/mg) than in untransfected cells (5.05 ± 0.6 nmol/min/mg) and thus provides an enriched source of this enzyme for further characterization. S1P degradation increased linearly with the incubation time for the first 30 min of the reaction, then gradually decreased (Fig. 1 A). mSPP1 activity was linear with increasing protein concentration (Fig. 1 B), and a concentration of 4 μg was used for further characterization. Typical Michaelis-Menten kinetics were observed with recombinant mSPP1 (Fig.3 A). The apparentKm and V max values for S1P were calculated from a Lineweaver-Burk plot to be 38.5 μm and 36.4 nmol/min/mg, respectively. The S1P phosphatase activity exhibited a broad pH optimum with maximum activity between pH 6 and 7.5 (Fig. 3 B), and the activity decreased markedly at lower or higher pH. Thus, the activity was routinely measured at pH 7.5. To identify human homologs of mSPP1, we searched the hEST data base and found several ESTs (gb:AA375349, gb:AA376229, gb:AA133909, and gsc:00005190) with high sequence homology to mSPP1. The full-length cDNA encoding hSPP1 was constructed from rapid amplification of cDNA ends products and fragments isolated from these EST clones. The open reading frame encodes a protein with 441 amino acids and 76% identity and 81% similarity to mSPP1 at the amino acid level (Fig. 4). HEK 293 and Chinese hamster ovary cells were transfected with expression vectors containing hSPP1 to confirm whether it encodes abona fide SPP1. 48 h after transfection with hSPP1, S1P phosphatase activity increased 2–3-fold in HEK 293 cells and 10–20-fold in Chinese hamster ovary cells relative to vector-transfected controls (Fig.5 A). Because, in addition to S1P, eukaryotic cells also contain dihydro-S1P and phyto-S1P (29Spiegel S. Merrill Jr., A.H. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 1388-1397Crossref PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar), it was of interest to examine whether these phosphorylated sphingolipids were also substrates for mSPP1. Dihydro-S1P, which has a structure identical to that of S1P except for the lack of thetrans-4,5 double bond, is hydrolyzed by mSPP1 and hSPP1 (Fig. 5, A and B). Phyto-S1P, which has the same structure as dihydro-S1P but contains an additional hydroxyl group at the 4 position, was dephosphorylated by mSPP1 to the same extent as dihydro-S1P. Although membranes from vector-transfected cells have some phosphohydrolase activity with these phosphorylated sphingoid bases, it was much lower than membranes from cells overexpressing mSPP1, and the rates of dephosphorylation were the same for these three substrates (Fig. 5, A and B). Because both mSPP1 and hSPP1 have the conserved residues within the catalytic domains present in all type 2 LPPs (30Carman G.M. Deems R.A. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18711-18714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar), which are characterized as Mg2+-independent and NEM-insensitive (14Brindley D.N. Waggoner D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24281-24284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 16Roberts R. Sciorra V.A. Morris A.J. J. Biol.

Chem. 2001; 276: 13452-13460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), it was of interest to compare the properties of SPP1 with those of the known LPPs. To examine the dependence on metal ions, recombinant mSPP1 activity was first measured in the presence of the metal chelator EDTA. Rather than inhibiting, low concentrations of EDTA slightly stimulated SPP1 activity, and increasing the concentration up to 10 mmhad no further effects on the activity (Fig.6 A), suggesting that divalent cations are not required for activity of this phosphatase. Moreover, similar to LPPs, SPP1 activity was completely independent of added divalent cations, including magnesium and calcium (Fig. 6 B) but was slightly inhibited by Mn2+ (Fig. 6 C). Thus, like other type 2 lipid phosphohydrolases, SPP1 activity is also independent of any cation requirements. Zn2+ was used previously as an effective inhibitor of all three type 2 LPPs. SPP1 appears to be sensitive to Zn2+ (Fig. 6 D). Of note, membrane fractions from vector-transfected HEK 293 cells contain a phosphatase activity that is markedly stimulated by Zn2+. The effect of various inhibitors of other type 2 lipid phosphatases on SPP1 activity was then examined using 10 μm S1P, a concentration below the apparent Km, to observe more readily the inhibitory or stimulatory effects on enzyme activity. SPP1 activity was inhibited markedly by NaF, a general phosphatase inhibitor, in a dose-dependent manner, with 75% inhibition at a concentration of 5 mm (Fig.7 A). The pentacoordinate vanadate cofactor resembles the transition state structure of phosphate and has been used extensively as a phosphotyrosine phosphatase inhibitor. Sodium orthovanadate also strongly inhibited SPP1 (Fig.7 A). Although the aliphatic cation propanolol, a β-adrenergic receptor antagonist, is an effective inhibitor of type 1 PAP activities and only modestly inhibits LPPs (16Roberts R. Sciorra V.A. Morris A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22059-22067Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 28Furneisen J.M. Carman G.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1484: 71-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 31Jamal Z. Martin A. Munoz A.G. Brindley D.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2988-2996Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it is a fairly potent inhibitor of SPP1 (Fig. 7 B). In contrast, ATP, pyrophosphate, phosphate monoesters such as β−glycerol phosphate, or tartrate, an inhibitor of lysosomal acid phosphatase (32Brightwell R. Tappel A.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1968; 124: 333-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), had no significant effects on S1P phosphatase activity (Fig. 7, Cand D). NEM is an alkylating reagent that also reacts with sulfhydryl groups and has been used to differentiate the Mg2+-dependent and Mg2+-independent lipid phosphatases from yeast and mammalian cells (14Brindley D.N. Waggoner D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24281-24284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, unlike the yeast homolog, which is NEM-insensitive (20Mandala S.M. Thornton R. Tu Z. Kurtz M.B. Nickels J. Broach J. Menzeleev R. Spiegel S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 150-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar), we found that NEM inhibited mSPP1 in a dose-dependent manner. A maximum inhibition of 40% was achieved at a concentration of 0.5–1 mm (Fig. 8 A). The inhibitory effect of NEM was prevented by coincubation with dithiothreitol (Fig. 8 A). Thus, unlike other Mg2+-independent lipid phosphatase enzymes from yeast and mammalian cells, the mammalian SPP1 should be considered to be sensitive to NEM, suggesting that this enzyme may differ in structure and/or reaction mechanism. However, the thioreactive compound iodoacetamide, even when preincubated with the enzyme at a concentration of 10 mm, had no significant effect on enzyme activity (Fig. 8 B), indicating that NEM may inhibit mSPP1 by alkylation of non-sulfhydryl residues. Interestingly, NEM also potently inhibited the phosphatidate phosphatase, diacylglycerol pyrophosphate phosphatase, and lysophosphatidic acid phosphatase activities of the LPP1-encoded lipid phosphatase from S. cerevisiae (28Furneisen J.M. Carman G.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1484: 71-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Hence, as suggested by Furneisen and Carman (28Furneisen J.M. Carman G.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1484: 71-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), the criteria of NEM sensitivity used to classify the Mg2+-independent phosphatidate phosphatase enzymes should be modified (28Furneisen J.M. Carman G.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1484: 71-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The LPPs have little or no activity with lipid phosphates as substrates in the absence of detergents (14Brindley D.N. Waggoner D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24281-24284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 16Roberts R. Sciorra V.A. Morris A.J. J. Biol.

Biochem. J. 1999; 340: 677-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). In contrast, mSPP1 has significant activity toward S1P and dihydro-S1P in the absence of any detergent, when either of these lipid phosphates is presented to the enzyme even without any carrier or as BSA complexes. Studies of substrate specificities and kinetic analyses of the other lipid phosphate phosphohydrolases have usually been carried out in the presence of a non-ionic detergent such as Triton X-100 (28Furneisen J.M. Carman G.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1484: 71-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 33Jasinska R. Zhang Q.X. Pilquil C. Singh I. Xu J. Dewald J. Dillon D.A. Berthiaume L.G. Carman G.M. Waggoner D.W. Brindley D.N. Biochem. J. 1999; 340: 677-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, when mSPP1-catalyzed hydrolysis of S1P was measured in the presence of increasing amounts of Triton X-100, the ability of mSPP1 to degrade S1P was strongly inhibited by concentrations of Triton X-100 above 0.2 mm (Fig.9 A), which is the critical micelle concentration of this detergent (aggregation no. 100–155), a result indicative of surface dilution effects (30Carman G.M. Deems R.A. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18711-18714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). We then attempted to determine whether this was a specific effect of Triton X-100 or whether other detergents were similarly inhibitory. The non-ionic detergent β-octyl glucoside (CMC 20–25 mm, aggregation no. 84), inhibited mSPP1, albeit with slightly less potency than Triton X-100, whereas the zwitterionic detergent CHAPS (CMC 6–10 mm, aggregation no. 4–14) inhibited the activity to a lesser extent. The potencies of these detergents to inhibit SPP1 activity correlated with their critical micelle concentrations and aggregation numbers, again indicative of surface dilution effects. However, phosphohydrolase activity with membranes from vector-transfected HEK 293 cells was 1–2 nmol/min/mg and was not influenced by these detergents. Previously, a surface dilution kinetic model has been employed usefully to examine kinetic properties of substrates presented as Triton X-100 micelles for kinetic analysis of yeast and mammalian LPPs (30Carman G.M. Deems R.A. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18711-18714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Substrates are presented to the enzymes in micellar form with detergents with high aggregation numbers, and thus the surface concentration of substrate can be varied without compromising the physical state of the micelles. In this type of analysis, the enzyme activity depends on both bulk and surface concentrations of substrate because enzyme binding to the micelle interface precedes substrate binding and catalysis. It has been suggested that in this mixed micellar condition, the enzyme is in an environment similar to the physiological surface of membranes (30Carman G.M. Deems R.A. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18711-18714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). We thus attempted to examine the surface dilution effect on the activity of mSPP1 when S1P was presented in Triton X-100 micelles. SPP1 activity was measured at a fixed concentration of S1P (50 μm), and the mol% was varied by increasing the concentration of Triton X-100. Higher S1P concentrations are needed in this case to form uniform micelles of the substrate. As expected from the surface dilution model, at Triton X-100 concentrations below 1 mm, there was a severe reduction in SPP1 activity. However, it was not possible to derive kinetic constants from this analysis because Triton X-100 dramatically stimulated endogenous SPP1 activity in this micellar assay in parallel with its effect on the overexpressed SPP1 activity (Fig. 9 C). These results further substantiate the notion that SPP1 is affected differently by detergents than the type 2 LPPs. It is important for many types of immunoprecipitation experiments to be able to measure SPP1 activity in the presence of a stabilizing detergent. Because SPP1 is strongly inhibited by detergents with high aggregation numbers, we also examined the effect of Tween 20, a weak detergent that only forms very small micelles. SPP1 activity was even slightly stimulated by low concentrations of Tween 20, which makes it a suitable detergent for SPP1 assays (Fig. 9 D). In summary, in this paper we report the cloning of hSPP1, the human homolog of mSPP1. Based on EST sequences, hSPP1 has been localized on chromosome 14q22.1-q22 (UniGene Cluster Hs.24678, URL: www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/UniGene/clust.cgi?ORG=Hs&CID = 24678). In Blast searches, the most closely related proteins to mammalian SPP1 were sphingoid base phosphatases from S. cerevisiae (yLBP1 and yLBP2) and two uncharacterized genes fromSchizosaccharomyces pombe and Arabidopsis thaliana, followed by bacterial phosphatases. Cluster analysis of the protein sequences places mSPP1 and hSPP1 off the same branch point with the yeast S1Pases, and divergent from the LPP subfamily, which includes mammalian LPPs, Drosophila Wunen proteins, and yeast DPP1 and LPP1 (Fig. 10). Thus, mammalian SPP1s belong to a conserved family of genes which is distinct from other known type 2 LPPs, both in sequence and in biochemical properties."

This substrate specificity for oxidized purine nucleoside triphosphates was investigated by mutation analyses based on the sequence comparison with the Escherichia coli homolog, MutT, which hydrolyzes only 8-oxo-dGTP and 8-oxo-rGTP but not oxidized forms of dATP or ATP. Neither a replacement of the phosphohydrolase module of MTH1 with that of MutT nor deletions of the C-terminal region of MTH1, which is unique for MTH1, altered the substrate specificity of MTH1. In contrast, the substitution of residues at position Trp-117 and Asp-119 of MTH1, which showed apparent chemical shift perturbations with 8-oxo-dGDP in NMR analyses but are not conserved in MutT, affected the substrate specificity. Trp-117 is essential for MTH1 to recognize both 8-oxo-dGTP and 2-hydroxy-dATP, whereas Asp-119 is only essential for recognizing 2-hydroxy-dATP, thus suggesting that origins of the substrate-binding pockets for MTH1 and MutT are different.

Endogenous oxidation of nucleic acids, such as DNA, RNA, and their precursors by reactive oxygen species generated under normal metabolic conditions, appear to induce spontaneous mutagenesis and cell death, which have been implicated in aging and various diseases including cancer and neuronal degeneration (1Ames B.N.

It has been established that 8-oxoguanine (8-oxoG), an oxidized form of guanine, is highly mutagenic and one of the main endogenous sources for spontaneous mutagenesis. During DNA replication, 8-oxo-deoxyguanosine triphosphate (8-oxo-dGTP) can be inserted into the nascent strand opposite adenine and cytosine in the template, with almost equal efficiency, thus resulting in an A:T to C:G transversion mutation (2Cheng K.C. Cahill D.S. Kasai H. Nishimura S. Loeb L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 166-172Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Shibutani S. Takeshita M. Grollman A.P. Nature. 1991; 349: 431-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (2015) Google Scholar). Accumulation of 8-oxoG in double-stranded DNA is caused by direct oxidization of guanine in DNA or incorporation of precursor nucleotide, 8-oxo-dGTP, which is generated in nucleotide pools with oxidation of dGTP (4Tajiri T. Maki H. Sekiguchi M. Mutat. Res. 1995; 336: 257-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). A misincorporation of oxidized nucleotides also occurs during transcription, thus leading to an accumulation of abnormal proteins (5Hayakawa H. Hofer A. Thelander L. Kitajima S. Cai Y. Oshiro S.

Radman M. Science. 1997; 278: 128-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). To eliminate such deleterious oxidized nucleotides, organisms come equipped with elaborate mechanisms. In Escherichia coli the MutT protein hydrolyzes 8-oxo-dGTP and 8-oxo-guanosine triphosphate (8-oxo-rGTP) to the monophosphate form, thus avoiding the misincorporation of mutagenic nucleotides into DNA and mRNA during replication and transcription (7Akiyama M. Horiuchi T. Sekiguchi M. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1987; 206: 9-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 8Maki H. Sekiguchi M. Nature. 1992; 355: 273-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (781) Google Scholar). The absence of themutT gene increases the spontaneous occurrence of A:T to C:G transversion a thousandfold over the wild type level (7Akiyama M. Horiuchi T. Sekiguchi M. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1987; 206: 9-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 9Cox E.C. Genetics. 1973; 73: 67-80PubMed Google Scholar), and further increases the occurrence of transcriptional errors (6Taddei F. Hayakawa H. Bouton M. Cirinesi A. Matic I. Sekiguchi M. Radman M. Science. 1997; 278: 128-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Enzymatic activities similar to that of MutT had been identified in both human and other mammalian cells (10Cai J.P. Kakuma T. Tsuzuki T. Sekiguchi M. Carcinogenesis. 1995; 16: 2343-2350Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 11Kakuma T. Nishida J. Tsuzuki T. Sekiguchi M. J. Biol.

Based on the similarity in their amino acid sequences to that of MutT and their catalytic activities hydrolyzing 8-oxo-dGTP, the proteins were named MTH1 (MutT homolog-1) (14Sekiguchi M. Genes Cells. 1996; 1: 139-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Because the expression of the mammalian enzymes inmutT− E. coli cells suppresses the elevated level of spontaneous mutagenesis to an almost normal level, MTH1 appears to have the same antimutagenic capacity as E. coli MutT (10Cai J.P. Kakuma T. Tsuzuki T. Sekiguchi M. Carcinogenesis. 1995; 16: 2343-2350Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 11Kakuma T. Nishida J. Tsuzuki T. Sekiguchi M. J. Biol.

Genomics. 1994; 24: 485-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). In addition to the error avoiding mechanism against 8-oxo-dGTP, the base excision repair enzymes for 8-oxoG in DNA, such as OGG1/MutM and MYH/MutY, are conserved among various organisms from E. coli to mammals (16Boiteux S. Radicella J.P. Biochimie (Paris). 1999; 81: 59-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 17Nakabeppu Y. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol.

Cell. 1999; 10: 1637-1652Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar), thus indicating that the mutagenic potential of 8-oxoG is universal throughout living organisms. Mice lacking the mth1 gene exhibit an increased occurrence of spontaneous carcinogenesis in lung, liver, and stomach (19Tsuzuki T. Egashira A. Igarashi H. Iwakuma T. Nakatsuru Y. Tominaga Y. Kawate H. Nakao K. Nakamura K. Ide F. Kura S. Nakabeppu Y. Katsuki M. Ishikawa T. Sekiguchi M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 11456-11461Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar), thus suggesting that the accumulation of 8-oxo-dGTP, namely a substrate for MTH1, triggers such malignant transformation in vivo. Furthermore, we previously reported that human MTH1 (hMTH1) appears to play a role in protecting neurons from oxidative stress (20Furuta A. Iida T. Nakabeppu Y. Iwaki T. Neuroreport. 2001; 12: 2895-2899Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 21Shimura-Miura H. Hattori N. Kang D. Miyako K. Nakabeppu Y. Mizuno Y. Ann. Neurol. 1999; 46: 920-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). We also showed that hMTH1, but not E. coli MutT protein, has the ability to hydrolyze oxidized dATP and ATP, such as 2-hydroxy (OH)-dATP, 2-OH-rATP, or 8-oxo-dATP and 8-oxo-rATP, as well as 8-oxo-dGTP and 8-oxo-rGTP. However, oxidized pyrimidine nucleotides, such as 5-hydroxy-deoxycytidine triphosphate and 5-formyl-deoxyuridine triphosphate are not hydrolyzed by hMTH1 (22Fujikawa K. Kamiya H. Yakushiji H. Fujii Y. Nakabeppu Y. Kasai H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18201-18205Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 23Fujikawa K. Kamiya H. Yakushiji H. Nakabeppu Y. Kasai H. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 449-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Based on the substrate specificity of hMTH1, we designated MTH1 to be an oxidized purine nucleoside triphosphatase (24Nakabeppu Y. Mutat. Res. 2001; 477: 59-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The broad spectrum of substrate specificity of MTH1 suggests that not only 8-oxo-dGTP but also oxidized forms of dATP contribute to the increased incidence of spontaneous carcinogenesis in mth1 knockout mice. To understand the biological significance of oxidized purine nucleoside triphosphates in mammals, it is essential to unveil the molecular basis for substrate recognition by MTH1 and the mechanism by which each oxidized nucleotide causes cellular dysfunction, such as that observed in cancer and neuronal degeneration. In this study, we focused on three functional domains in hMTH1 protein and performed biochemical and physicochemical analyses of various mutant proteins to elucidate the relationships between their structures and functions. We have identified amino acid residues in hMTH1 that are involved in the recognition of 2-OH-dATP and 8-oxo-dGTP, and also describe the molecular basis for its recognition of the two substrates. Vectors harboring mutant hMTH1 cDNA were prepared by recombinant PCR (25Higuchi R. Innis M.A. Gelfand D.H. Sninsky J.J. White T.J. PCR Protocols: A Guide to Methods and Applications. Academic Press, San Diego1999: 177-183Google Scholar). Expression vector for hMTH1 (F27A) was constructed, for example, with the following strategies. The first PCR was performed with a template DNA of pET8c:hMTH1, which was previously reported as pHYVal83-MTH1 (26Yakushiji H. Maraboeuf F. Takahashi M. Deng Z.S. Kawabata S. Nakabeppu Y. Sekiguchi M. Mutat. Res. 1997; 384: 181-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), with two sets of oligonucleotide primers, −10T7 promoter and F27Ar and F27Af andSacIr. Equal amounts of the two sets of PCR products were mixed, and one cycle of denaturing, annealing, and extension were performed. The third PCR was carried out with the second PCR products using −10T7 promoter and SacIr primers.NcoI-SacI region of pET8c:hMTH1 was replaced with the corresponding fragment derived from the final PCR products by digestion with NcoI and SacI, to obtain a mutant plasmid pET8c:hMTH1 (F27A). All primers used in the present study are listed in Table I. For the construction of mutants with a deletion or one amino acid substitution in C-terminal region of hMTH1, the following primers were used: a common primerSacIf, and mutagenesis primers ΔC3R, ΔC4R, ΔC5R, ΔC6R, ΔC12R, ΔC16R, ΔC25R, V156Ar, T155Ar, D154Ar, V153Ar, E152Ar, R151Ar, and L150Ar.

The expression of hMTH1 and MutT inE. coli strain BL21T, preparation of crude extracts, and purification of recombinant proteins were performed as previously described (26Yakushiji H. Maraboeuf F. Takahashi M. Deng Z.S. Kawabata S. Nakabeppu Y. Sekiguchi M. Mutat. Res. 1997; 384: 181-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Appropriate amounts of crude extracts were subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting, with purified hMTH1 as a standard, according to the previously described method (29Tsuchimoto D. Sakai Y. Sakumi K. Nishioka K. Sasaki M. Fujiwara T. Nakabeppu Y. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 2349-2360Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Rabbit polyclonal antibodies, pAb78B3B (30Kang D. Nishida J. Iyama A. Nakabeppu Y. Furuichi M. Fujiwara T. Sekiguchi M. Takeshige K. J. Biol.

The concentrations of purified hMTH1 proteins were determined using the molar extinction coefficient (ε280 = 33,100 (m−1)) of wild type hMTH1 (26Yakushiji H. Maraboeuf F. Takahashi M. Deng Z.S. Kawabata S. Nakabeppu Y. Sekiguchi M. Mutat. Res. 1997; 384: 181-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). A corrected molar extinction coefficient, ε280 = 26,430 (m−1), for a tryptophan residue was applied to W117A. 8-oxo-dGTP was purchased from Trilink BioTechnologies. 2-OH-dATP was chemically synthesized according to the method previously reported (31Jurczyk S.C. Kodra J.T. Park J.-H. Benner S.A. Battersby T.R. Helv. Chim. Acta. 1999; 82: 1005-1015Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Nucleotides used for determination of kinetic parameters were greater than 99.95% pure. 8-Oxo-dGTPase and 2-OH-dATPase activities were measured as previously described (22Fujikawa K. Kamiya H. Yakushiji H. Fujii Y. Nakabeppu Y. Kasai H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18201-18205Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 28Fujii Y. Shimokawa H. Sekiguchi M. Nakabeppu Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 38251-38259Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Briefly, each reaction was carried out in reaction mixtures (10–100 μl), which contained 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 4 mmMgCl2, 40 mm NaCl, 80 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 8 mm dithiothreitol, and 10% glycerol, and up to 20 μm substrates (8-oxo-dGTP or 2-OH-dATP) with or without competitive inhibitors (up to 500 μm). After incubation at 30 °C for 2 min, crude extracts (2–1,000 ng of total protein) or 1 nm purified hMTH1 were added and the reaction at 30 °C for 2 to 6 min was terminated by an ice-cold EDTA solution. During the interval established, the reaction rate was constant, and thus the velocity of each reaction represents the initial reaction rate. The entire reaction mixture was injected into a TSK-Gel DEAE-2SW column (Tosoh, Tokyo, Japan) equilibrated with 75 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, and 20% acetonitrile, and the amounts of nucleoside triphosphates and monophosphates were then quantified as previously reported (23Fujikawa K. Kamiya H. Yakushiji H. Nakabeppu Y. Kasai H. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 449-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Lineweaver-Burk plots were drawn from the initial velocity of nucleoside triphosphatase for each mutant hMTH1 protein. The K m and V max values were derived from intercepts of regression lines using least square fittings to the plots. K d values were determined by Scatchard plots deduced from the change in protein fluorescence of hMTH1 upon stepwise addition of nucleotides. Protein fluorescence (tryptophanyl) was measured at 345 nm (bandwidth: 5 nm) upon selective excitation of tryptophan residues at 295 nm (bandwidth: 5 nm). The experiments were carried out at 25 °C in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 40 mm NaCl, and 1 mmCdCl2. We previously reported that a chimeric protein hMTH1-Ec, in which its phosphohydrolase module was replaced with that of MutT, has the ability to hydrolyze 8-oxo-dGTP, and thus concluded that phosphohydrolase modules of MutT and hMTH1 proteins are equivalent in structure and function. Furthermore, the saturation mutagenesis of the module in hMTH1 revealed that 14 of the 23 residues constituting the module are essential for its catalytic function (28Fujii Y. Shimokawa H. Sekiguchi M. Nakabeppu Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 38251-38259Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 32Cai J.P. Kawate H. Ihara K. Yakushiji H. Nakabeppu Y. Tsuzuki T. Sekiguchi M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 1170-1176Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Among the 14 essential residues, 9 residues are conserved in MutT, whereas the others are not (Fig. 1, A and B). Considering the fact that the phosphohydrolase module in MutT is involved in substrate binding together with Mg2+ ion (33Harris T.K. Wu G. Massiah M.A. Mildvan A.S. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1655-1674Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), it is likely that the unique 5 residues for hMTH1 may determine its broad spectrum of substrate specificity. To address this question, we prepared crude extracts from BL21T (mutT− ) cells expressing MutT, hMTH1, or hMTH1-Ec, and measured the activities hydrolyzing 2-OH-dATP and 8-oxo-dGTP in each extract (Fig. 1 C). 8-Oxo-dGTP was efficiently hydrolyzed to 8-oxo-dGMP in the presence of MutT, whereas 2-OH-dATP was never hydrolyzed in the same reaction condition. In the presence of hMTH1-Ec as well as hMTH1, on the other hand, 2-OH-dATP was more efficiently hydrolyzed to the monophosphate than was 8-oxo-dGTP. Neither 2-OH-dATP nor 8-oxo-dGTP was hydrolyzed to the monophosphates in the presence of extracts prepared from BL21T cells harboring the pET8c vector itself, even when 1 μg of total protein was added to the reaction mixture (data not shown). These results indicate that the substrate specificity of hMTH1 but not MutT was retained in hMTH1-Ec chimeric protein regardless of the presence of MutT phosphohydrolase module. We thus concluded that a region(s) outside the phosphohydrolase module plays a major role for recognizing 2-OH-dATP. Furthermore, our results indicate that the substrate binding pocket of hMTH1 is not structurally altered by replacing its phosphohydrolase module with that of MutT, thus confirming that phosphohydrolase modules of MutT homologs are both structurally and functionally independent (28Fujii Y. Shimokawa H. Sekiguchi M. Nakabeppu Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 38251-38259Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). A major difference in the primary structures between mammalian MTH1 and prokaryotic MutT homologs is an additional sequence in C termini of mammalian MTH1 (Fig.1 A). Because 8 of 27 amino acid residues of the unique C-terminal region of hMTH1 are identical to those in C-terminal region of human MYH (hMYH) protein, a DNA glycosylase that excises 2-OH-A in DNA as well as adenine opposite 8-oxoG in DNA, it has been suggested that the C-terminal region of hMTH1 is involved in the recognition of 2-OH-dATP (34Ohtsubo T. Nishioka K. Imaiso Y. Iwai S. Shimokawa H. Oda H. Fujiwara T. Nakabeppu Y. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 1355-1364Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). To explore its functional significance, we manipulated hMTH1 cDNA to introduce various deletions into the C-terminal region (Fig. 2 A). Western blotting analyses of crude extracts prepared from BL21T cells expressing these mutant hMTH1 revealed that relative amounts of mutant proteins recovered in the insoluble fraction significantly increased as the number of residues deleted increased (Fig. 2 B). Based on a quantitative Western analysis of the mutant hMTH1 remaining in the soluble fraction (Fig. 2 C), we determined the specific activities of 2-OH-dATPase and 8-oxo-dGTPase for each mutant protein (Table II). The specific activities of wild type hMTH1 determined in crude extracts, 302.2 × 102 units of 2-OH-dATPase/μg of protein and 308.6 × 102 units of 8-oxo-dGTPase/μg of protein, were very close to the values determined with purified hMTH1, 336.2 × 102 units/μg and 296.6 × 102units/μg, respectively. Neither 2-OH-dATPase nor 8-oxo-dGTPase activity was detected in the extracts containing ΔC12, ΔC16, or ΔC25-hMTH1. In comparison with wild type hMTH1, ΔC3-hMTH1 retained either comparable or higher levels of the specific activities with both substrates, whereas ΔC4-hMTH1 retained 63 and 68% the levels of those for wild type with 2-OH-dATP and 8-oxo-dGTP, respectively, and those for ΔC5 or ΔC6-hMTH were further decreased to 11 and 18%, or 1.1 and 1.2%, respectively. The ratio of the specific activity of 2-OH-dATPase to that of 8-oxo-dGTPase in ΔC5-hMTH1 was 0.59, and is smaller than that of wild type (0.98), whereas the ratios in the other mutants are comparable with that of wild type (0.84–0.98).Table IISpecific activities of mutant hMTH1 proteinsCloneSpecific activity2-aValues are shown as (× 10−2 units/μg of MTH1). 1 unit of enzyme activity equals the capability to produce 1 pmol of 8-oxo-dGMP or 2-OH-dAMP per min.

Open table in a new tab To identify the critical residue(s) for the function of hMTH1, especially in the C-terminal region, we generated seven different mutants in which each amino acid residue from Leu-150 to Val-156 was replaced by alanine. The specific activities of 2-OH-dATPase and 8-oxo-dGTPase for each mutant were measured, and the results are summarized in Table II. Among the seven mutants, D154A was found to have the highest specific activities with both substrates, which exceeded those for the wild type, whereas L150A exhibited the lowest activities, which are 56 and 48% of the activities for wild type with 2-OH-dATP and 8-oxo-dGTP, respectively. In all mutants, their ratios of the two specific activities were almost the same as that of the wild type. We thus concluded that the unique C-terminal region of hMTH1 is not involved in the recognition of the two substrates, namely 2-OH-dATP and 8-oxo-dGTP. To uncover the essential function of the C-terminal region in hMTH1, we further examined the thermostabilities of the mutants described above. Crude extracts containing wild type, ΔC3, ΔC4, or ΔC5-hMTH1 were incubated at 55 or 65 °C for 10 min, and remaining activities of 2-OH-dATPase in each extracts were determined at 30 °C. As shown in Fig. 2 D, wild type hMTH1 retained 94 and 49% of the activity in the untreated extracts after treatment at 55 and 65 °C, respectively. ΔC3-hMTH1 retained the wild type level of residual activity (89%) after treatment at 55 °C, whereas the level decreased to 20% of the control after treatment at 65 °C. The 2-OH-dATPase activities in the extracts containing ΔC4 and ΔC5-hMTH1 decreased to 34 and 21% of the controls by treatment at 55 °C, and to 8.7 and 7.9% by treatment at 65 °C, respectively. The seven mutants with alanine substitution also exhibited a similarly increased thermolability, and among them L150A was the most labile against the heat treatment; its residual activity was 26 or 14% after treatment at 55 or 65 °C, respectively. We next compared the residual activities of both 2-OH-dATPase and 8-oxo-dGTPase in extracts containing wild type, V156A, and L150A, after treatment at various temperatures from 30 to 80 °C. As shown in Fig. 2 E, it is apparent that the two activities in all extracts examined were similarly affected by the heat treatment, thus confirming that each residue was not involved in the selective recognition of 2-OH-dATP and 8-oxo-dGTP. Tm, the midpoint of temperature resulting in 50% loss of their activities was calculated as 65 °C for wild type, 61 °C for V156A, and 50 °C for L150A. By measuring the two activities in crude extracts and purified preparation of wild type MTH1 with heat treatment, we obtained identical inactivation curves for the 2-OH-dATPase and 8-oxo-dGTPase (data not shown), thus indicating that the thermostability of hMTH1 protein was not altered by other E. coli proteins present in crude extracts. Hence, it is concluded that the increased thermolability observed in each mutant hMTH1 protein lacking the C-terminal region or with an alanine substitution in the region reflects the alterations in the stability of the mutant protein itself but not a lack of interaction with other protein(s) in extracts. These results indicate that the unique C-terminal region of hMTH1 plays an important role in preserving the enzyme conformation. The C-terminal β-strand G of hMTH1 is rich in hydrophobic amino acids as seen in Fig. 1 A, thus suggesting that the C-terminal region preserves the higher order structures of hMTH1, including substrate binding pocket or catalytic center through its interaction with other hydrophobic β strands (βA, βC, and βD). A structural model of hMTH1 that also supports our conclusion has been proposed based on NMR analyses. 1M. Mishima, Y. Sakai, N. Ito, H. Kamiya, M. Furuichi, M. Takahashi, S. Iwai, Y.

Multiple forms of hMTH1 proteins, each of which has an extended C terminus, are translated from these seven types of mRNA, and each protein efficiently hydrolyzes both 2-OH-dATP and 8-oxo-dGTP. 2Y. Sakai, M. Furuichi, H. Kamiya, and Y. Nakabeppu, unpublished results. It was therefore rather difficult to identify the amino acid residues in hMTH1, which were involved in substrate recognition, from its primary or secondary structures. We next focused on three amino acid residues, Phe-27, Trp-117, and Asp-119, which gave rise to apparent chemical shift perturbations in the presence of 8-oxo-dGDP, a competitive inhibitor for hMTH1(22), during NMR analyses of hMTH1 (see Fig.4A).1 To clarify the functional significance of the three residues, we generated mutant hMTH1 with a single amino acid substitution for Phe-27, Trp-117, or Asp-119 with alanine or others (F27A, W117A, W117Y, D119A, and D119N)"

Recent work indicates that the expression of αA-crystallin enhances lens epithelial cell growth and resistance to stress conditions. Mutation of the arginine 116 residue to cysteine (R116C) in αA-crystallin has been associated with congenital cataracts in humans. However, the physiological consequences of this mutation have not been analyzed in lens epithelial cells. In the present study, we expressed wild type or R116C αA-crystallin in the human lens epithelial cell line HLE B-3. Immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy indicated that both wild type and R116C αA-crystallin were distributed mainly in the cytoplasm of lens epithelial cells. Size-exclusion chromatography indicated that the size of the αA-crystallin aggregate in lens epithelial cells increased from 500 to 600 kDa for the wild type protein to >2 MDa in the R116C mutant. When cells were exposed to physiological levels of UVA radiation, wild type αA-crystallin protected cells from apoptotic death as shown by annexin labeling and flow cytometric analysis, whereas the R116C mutant had a 4- to 10-fold lower protective ability. UVA-irradiated cells expressing the wild type protein had very low TUNEL (terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling) staining, whereas cells expressing R116C mutant had a high level of TUNEL staining. F-actin was protected in UVA-treated cells expressing the wild type αA-crystallin but was either clumped around the apoptotic cells or was absent in apoptotic cells in cultures expressing the R116C mutant. Structural changes caused by the R116C mutation could be responsible for the reduced ability of the mutant to protect cells from stress. Our study shows that comparing the stress-induced apoptotic cell death is an effective way to compare the protective abilities of wild type and mutant αA-crystallin. We propose that the diminished protective ability of the R116C mutant in lens epithelial cells may contribute to the pathogenesis of cataract. αA-crystallin is a small heat-shock protein expressed preferentially in the lens and is detected during the early stages of lens development.

It is a polymeric complex of two ∼20-kDa subunits, αA and αB, that share a significant sequence identity, and can be isolated from lens fiber cells as a heteroaggregate of αA and αB-polypeptides in a 3:1 ratio with an average oligomeric mass of 600–800 kDa. The protein has a dynamic polymeric structure with a hollow interior and undergoes inter-aggregate subunit exchange (1Horwitz J. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 11: 53-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). The expression of α-crystallin in a variety of tissues outside the lens and its ability to prevent thermal aggregation of proteins in a manner similar to molecular chaperones suggest that it has general cellular functions over and above its role in light refraction (1Horwitz J. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 11: 53-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 2Bhat S.P. Nagineni C.N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 158: 319-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). To understand the physiological functions of αA- and αB-crystallin, knockout mice have been generated (3Brady J.P. Garland D. Douglas-Tabor Y. Robison Jr., W.G. Groome A. Wawrousek E.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 884-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar, 4Brady J.P. Garland D. Green D.E. Tamm E.R.

Examination of lenses from these mice suggests that αA- and αB-crystallin may have dissimilar and highly specific cellular functions. Disruption of the αA-crystallin gene causes early-onset cataract in mice, whereas disruption of the αB-crystallin gene does not result in altered lens morphology or transparency. Lens epithelial cells derived from mice lacking αA-crystallin have a 50% slower growth rate in vitro, whereas lens epithelial cells derived from αB-crystallin knockout mice demonstrate hyperproliferation and genomic instability (5Andley U.P.

These findings have led to the suggestion that αA- and αB-crystallin may have distinct functions in regulating cellular growth. Other studies indicate that the expression of αA- or αB-crystallin enhances the resistance of cells to a variety of stress conditions. αA- and αB-crystallin have the ability to protect cells from apoptosis induced by cytokines, protein kinase C inhibitor staurosporine, and UVA1radiation (7Mehlen P.

The ability of α-crystallin to prevent apoptosis may be linked to an inhibition of caspase activity (11Kamradt M.C. Chen F. Cryns V.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16059-16063Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). Additional studies have shown that intermediate filaments are the physiological targets of small heat-shock proteins (12Perng M.D. Cairns L. van den Ijssel P. Prescott A. Huthceson A.M. Quinlan R.A. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 2099-2112Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). αB-crystallin and HSP27 associate with intermediate filaments thereby preventing their undesired aggregation (13Nicholl I.D. Quinlan R.A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 945-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). In lens fiber cells exposed to thermal stress, αB-crystallin was shown to associate with lens-specific intermediate filament proteins phakinin and filensin (14Muchowski P.J. Valdez M.M. Clark J.I. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1999; 40: 951-958PubMed Google Scholar). αB-crystallin has been shown to associate with actin in ischemic cardiac cells where it may prevent aggregation of filaments (15Chiesi M. Longoni S. Limbruno U. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1990; 97: 129-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Molecular chaperones prevent undesired protein aggregation by binding to non-native intermediates that may arise in response to cellular stress or during protein translation in vivo. It has been shown that proteins subjected to heat treatment in vitro in the presence of α-crystallin retain a high level of native secondary structure (16Das K.P. Choo-Smith L.-P. Petrash J.M. Surewicz W.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33209-33212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Although the mechanism of chaperone action is not completely understood, it involves the formation of a complex between α-crystallin and substrate proteins (17Rao P.V. Horwitz J. Zigler Jr., J.S. J.

Recent work suggests that the protein structure of αB-crystallin is stabilized by complex formation with αA-crystallin (22Sun T.X. Liang J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 286-290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Small heat-shock protein sequences contain a highly conserved amino acid sequence called the α-crystallin domain, and the importance of particular residues within that domain has been demonstrated recently by evidence that mutations in αA-crystallin and αB-crystallin are responsible for two genetic disorders. In αA-crystallin, substitution of arginine 116 by cysteine was found to be the cause of one form of autosomal dominant cataract (23Litt M. Kramer R. LaMorticella D.M. Murphey W. Louvrien E.W. Weleber R.G. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1998; 7: 471-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). In αB-crystallin, substitution of arginine 120 by glycine was found to be the cause of another autosomal dominant disease, desmin-related myopathy, as well as cataracts (24Vicart P. Caron A. Guicheney P. Li Z. Prevost M.-C. Faure A. Chateau D. Chapon F. Tome F. Dupret J.-M. Paulin D. Fardeau M. Nat. Gen. 1998; 20: 92-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (975) Google Scholar). The recombinant mutant proteins have been purified from bacterial expression systems and are characterized by higher oligomeric mass than the wild type proteins, as well as altered secondary and tertiary structures and significantly reduced chaperone-like activity (25Kumar L.V.S. Ramakrishnan T. Rao C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24137-24141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 26Bova M.P. Yaron O. Huang Q. Ding L. Haley D.A. Stewart P.L.

Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1420-1426Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Lens epithelial cells in the germinative zone near the equator divide and elongate throughout life and are crucial for maintaining proper growth, transparency, and refractive properties of the lens. As new cells elongate to form lens fibers, they wrap around the lens periphery and meet at the sutures (28Kuszak J. Clark J.I. Cooper K.E. Rae J.L. Albert D.M. Jakobiec F.A. Principles and Practice of Ophthalmology. 2nd Ed. 2. W. B. Saunders, Philadelphia, PA2000: 1355-1408Google Scholar). αA- and αB-crystallin transcripts have been detected at early stages of lens development, and a marked increase in expression of the proteins accompanies differentiation (29Robinson M.L. Overbeek P.A. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1996; 37: 2276-2284PubMed Google Scholar,30Vermorken A.J.M. Hildernik van de Ven W.J.M. Bloemendal H. J. Cell Biol. 1978; 76: 175-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), but the specific roles of αA- and αB-crystallin in lens epithelial cells have not been identified. Recent work in our laboratory demonstrates that UVA radiation, which is known to cause cell death by production of reactive oxygen species and induces cataract in animals, induces lens epithelial cell death and that the expression of αA-crystallin prevents cell death (5Andley U.P.

Because the R116C mutation in αA-crystallin results in a form of congenital human cataract, it is important to investigate the function of the mutant protein in lens epithelial cells. Furthermore, to understand the physiological function of αA-crystallin, it is essential to identify proteins that αA-crystallin associates with in lens epithelial cells. In the present study, we expressed wild type and R116C αA-crystallin in human lens epithelial cell line HLE B-3 to examine the effect of expression of the mutant protein on UVA radiation-induced apoptotic cell death. We show that expression of R116CαA had a 4- to 10-fold lower ability to protect cells than the wild type protein. Our work also shows that comparing the in vitro stress-induced apoptotic cell death is an effective way to measure the protective abilities of the wild type and mutant αA-crystallin. Sequences encoding human wild type αA-crystallin were cloned into pCIneo mammalian expression vector (Promega) and transfected into human lens epithelial cells (HLE B-3) as described previously (5Andley U.P.

Bassnett S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36823-36831Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Mutagenesis of wild type αA to R116C was performed using the QuikChange mutagenesis kit according to the manufacturer's recommendations (Stratagene). Each construct was confirmed by sequencing on an ABI 310 genetic analyzer using dRhodamine dideoxy termination (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Human lens epithelial cells with extended life span (HLE B-3) were cultured in 20% fetal bovine serum containing Eagle's minimum essential medium and gentamicin (50 μg/ml) as described previously (31Andley U.P. Rhim J.S. Chylack Jr., L.T. Fleming T.P. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1994; 35: 3094-3102PubMed Google Scholar). These cells were passaged through at least 11 passages, after which they cease to produce αA-crystallin, as determined by immunoblot analysis (32Fleming T.P. Song Z. Andley U.P. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1998; 39: 1387-1398PubMed Google Scholar). Wild type or R116C αA-crystallin cDNA can thus be reintroduced into these cells by cDNA transfection, and stable cell lines expressing different levels of αA-crystallin can be generated. Transfection was carried out using the Promega ProFection kit according to the manufacturer's recommendations, and cells were treated with a Me2SO shock treatment after 16 h of transfection to increase transfection efficiency (10Andley U.P. Song Z. Wawrousek E.F. Fleming T.P. Bassnett S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36823-36831Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). After 48 h, cells were trypsinized and subcultured 1:3, and Geneticin was added at a concentration of 0.5 mg/ml for colony selection. Geneticin-resistant colonies were isolated, and individual colonies were expanded into mass cultures. Each colony, presumably derived from a single cell, was examined by quantitative immunoblot analysis and compared with cells transfected with vector only. Clonal cell lines were used for up to four passages for various assays. The expression of αA-crystallin was unchanged over four passages as determined by immunoblot analysis. Cell lines expressing wild type αA-crystallin or the R116C mutant from 0.1 to 2.5 ng/μg cellular protein were used. To demonstrate the expression of wild type or R116C αA-crystallin in individual cells of a culture, cells were labeled and immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy were used as described previously (5Andley U.P.

Briefly, cells were plated on coverslips, fixed with 4% p-formaldehyde for 1 h, and permeabilized in 0.1% Triton X-100, and nonspecific binding was blocked by incubation in 10% normal goat serum for 30 min. To visualize the distribution of αA-crystallin, cells were incubated overnight with a 1:50 dilution of a monoclonal antibody to bovine αA-crystallin (a gift from Dr. Paul Fitzgerald). A lissamine-rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG was used as a secondary antibody. To visualize the distribution of actin, cells were incubated in a 1:50 dilution in PBS of a fluorescein phalloidin (Molecular Probes) methanolic stock solution (100 units/ml ethanol). Cells were stained with fluorescein phalloidin for 20 min, washed three times for 5 min with PBS, and viewed. Lens epithelial cells were viewed using a Zeiss LSM 410 confocal microscope equipped with an argon-krypton laser. The distribution of αB-crystallin was also examined in cultures expressing wild type αA-crystallin or the R116C mutant. To visualize the distribution of αB-crystallin, cells were incubated overnight in a 1:100 dilution of an antibody to bovine αB-crystallin (Nova Castra). An Alexa 488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG was used as the secondary antibody. Western blotting was used to examine the expression of αA- and αB-crystallin in transfected HLE B-3 lens epithelial cultures (5Andley U.P. Song Z. Wawrousek E.F. Bassnett S. J. Biol.

HLE B-3 cell extracts were prepared in gel filtration buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 100 mm NaCl) by homogenization of 106 cells/ml. The extract was centrifuged at 10,000 ×g at 4 °C. The sample solution was filtered through a 0.45-μm filter before application to the column. The column was eluted at 0.3 ml/min. Aliquots of the collected fractions were placed in a 96-well plate for detection of αA-crystallin by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). A polyclonal antibody specific to αA-crystallin (1:1000) and a fluorescence-labeled secondary antibody (Alexa 488 goat anti-rabbit IgG, Molecular Probes, Inc.) were used, and the immune complexes were analyzed on an HTS 7000 PerkinElmer Life Sciences fluorescence plate reader. Cells were exposed to UVA radiation comparable to in vivo levels as described previously (5Andley U.P. Song Z. Wawrousek E.F. Bassnett S. J. Biol.

Cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and a layer of PBS was added to controls and cells to be irradiated. UVA radiation at 365 nm was obtained from a mercury-xenon arc lamp using a monochromator, focusing lens, and beam turner to give a fluence rate of 0.007 watts/cm2 and a total fluence of 37.8 J/cm2. Cells were processed 4 h after UVA irradiation in normal tissue culture medium. Cells were labeled with Annexin V-FITC (PharMingen) and propidium iodide according to the manufacturer's recommendations, and flow cytometry was performed to assess apoptotic cell death as described previously (5Andley U.P.

Briefly, cells were washed with PBS and exposed to UVA irradiation as described above and incubated in normal medium for 4 h. To distinguish apoptotic cells from necrotic cells, attached cells were trypsinized, combined with cells floating in the medium, washed with PBS, and resuspended in 0.5 ml of annexin-binding buffer. 5 μl of Annexin V-FITC and 10 μl of a 50 μg/ml propidium iodide solution were added, and samples were analyzed in a Becton Dickinson FACScan as described previously (10Andley U.P.

The flow cytometer had a laser excitation beam at 488 nm. Band pass filters at 530 nm and 685 nm were used to collect the fluorescence emission, and data collected in each window were designated FL1-H and FL2-H, respectively. Unlabeled cells, cells labeled with annexin only, and cells labeled with PI only were used as controls to adjust the compensation between the flow cytometer and the detectors and to set the quadrants. Data analyses were done with Cell Quest software. Percent protection by different levels of αA-crystallin expression was determined as the ratio of live cells in treated culture of cells with no αA-crystallin and with different levels of αA-crystallin expression. TUNEL labeling was also used to examine cell death in cultures exposed to UVA stress conditions. Cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, pH 7.4, for 30 min and permeabilized for 30 min in 0.1% Triton X-100/PBS at room temperature, and apoptotic nuclei were detected using a TUNEL-labeling reaction according to the manufacturer's instructions (Roche Biochemicals), as described previously (5Andley U.P. Song Z. Wawrousek E.F. Bassnett S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31252-31261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). To examine the actin cytoskeleton, cells were co-labeled with Texas-red phalloidin. Images were recorded on a confocal microscope. In other experiments, TUNEL-labeled cells were co-labeled with propidium iodide to count the total number of nuclei. Percent apoptosis was determined as the ratio of TUNEL-labeled cells to total number of cells multiplied by 100. A co-immunoprecipitation assay was used to investigate proteins associating with αA-crystallin in lens epithelial cells and to investigate the effect of stress on the interaction of αA-crystallin with cellular proteins. Cells were lysed for 30 min on ice with immune precipitation buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate, and protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma Chemical Co.) and centrifuged for 10 min at 10,000 × g (32Fleming T.P. Song Z. Andley U.P. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1998; 39: 1387-1398PubMed Google Scholar). Supernatants were treated with a primary antibody to αA-crystallin and immunoprecipitated with Protein A/G-agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies). A monoclonal antibody to αA-crystallin (1:20) or a rabbit polyclonal antibody to αA-crystallin (1:200) was used. Immunoprecipitates were washed three times with a lysis buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, 1% Triton X-100, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaCl, and protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma), resuspended in SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and analyzed on 15% acrylamide gels as described previously (5Andley U.P.

Stained bands were excised from the polyacrylamide gel and were digested with Promega (Madison, WI) modified porcine trypsin overnight at 37 °C in ammonium bicarbonate buffer, using a protocol developed in the Washington University Protein Chemistry Laboratory. The recovered tryptic peptides were dried and dissolved in 5 μl of 50% acetonitrile made 0.1% in trifluoroacetic acid. 0.5 μl of this solution was co-crystallized on the MALDI target plate with 0.5 μl of a saturated solution of α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (33Shevchenko A. Jensen O.N. Podtelejnikov A.V. Sagliocco F. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mortensen P. Shevchenko A. Boucherie H. Mann M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The MALDI spectrum was acquired on a PerSeptive Biosystems (Framingham, MA) Voyager DE-PRO MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer running Voyager version 5.1 software. The peptide masses from the resultant mass spectrum were submitted to Protein Prospector MS-Fit peptide mass fingerprinting analysis and searched against the NCBI non-redundant protein data base. To compare their relative ability to protect lens epithelial cells from UVA radiation-induced stress, wild type or R116CαA-crystallin were expressed in the human lens epithelial cell line HLE B-3. Sequences encoding human wild type αA-crystallin were cloned into the mammalian expression vector pCIneo and transfected into the HLE B-3 cell line at passages higher than 11. (Cells at passage 11 or higher have no detectable level of αA-crystallin by immunoblot analysis (32Fleming T.P. Song Z. Andley U.P. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1998; 39: 1387-1398PubMed Google Scholar), allowing the effect of αA-crystallin expression to be studied against a null background.) Mutagenesis of wild type αA-crystallin to R116C was carried out using the QuikChange mutagenesis kit from Stratagene. Each construct was confirmed by sequencing. Cell lines were expanded from Geneticin-resistant clones and cell lysates were analyzed by immunoblot analysis using an antibody to αA-crystallin. Fig. 1 shows representative immunoblot analysis of individual cell lines expressing different levels of wild type αA-crystallin or the R116C mutant. Cell lines expressing wild type αA-crystallin or the R116C mutant ranging between 0.1 and 2.5 ng/μg cellular protein were used to study the effect of UVA radiation. The intracellular distribution of αA-crystallin in transfected HLE B-3 cells was examined by immunofluorescence. Wild type αA-crystallin was distributed in the cytoplasm of these cells, with lower levels around the periphery (Fig.2 A). The actin cytoskeleton was also labeled uniformly in these cells. In a majority of the cells, there was little or no αA-crystallin detected in the nucle"

Theodosis C.N. Schneider R.J. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 215-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), the molecular mechanisms by which pX effects these processes, for the most part, remain to be deciphered. Likewise, the significance of these pX-mediated processes in HCC development is poorly understood. In our studies, we employ a cellular model system linked to pX-mediated hepatocyte transformation (32Tarn C. Bilodeau M.L. Hullinger R.L. Andrisani O.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2327-2336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) and suitable to molecular analyses. It is composed of two tetracycline-regulated, pX-expressing cell lines, a differentiated hepatocyte 3pX-1 cell line, and a dedifferentiated hepatocyte 4pX-1 cell line. Conditional pX expression selectively transforms the 3pX-1 cell line. We recently demonstrated (36Tarn C. Lee S. Hu Y. Ashendel C. Andrisani O.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34671-34680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) that an early pX-mediated event in 3pX-1 cells is sustained activation of the Ras-Raf-MAPK pathway, an activation that is causally linked to pX-mediated transformation. In the pX-nontransforming 4pX-1 cell line, pX expression results in sustained activation of the JNK pathway and only transient activation of the Ras-Raf-MAPK pathway. Since pX expression mediates distinct growth characteristics between the 3pX-1 and 4pX-1 cell lines (i.e. transformation in the differentiated 3pX-1 cells versus absence of transformation in the less differentiated 4pX-1 cells and differential activation of the Ras-Raf-MAPK and JNK pathways), we examined how pX expression affects progression of these two cell lines into the cell cycle. The rationale for comparative studies between the differentiated (3pX-1) and less- differentiated (4pX-1) cell line is that we will gain further insights regarding mechanism(s) of pX-mediated cellular transformation. Since the hepatic progenitor (oval cell) is the likely precursor leading to HCC (4Braun L. Goyette M. Yaswen P. Thompson N.L. Fausto N.

Pathol. 2001; 25: 1388-1396Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), our comparative studies will define the effect of pX on the less-differentiated 4pX-1 hepatocyte cell line. In this study, we examined the expression pattern of endogenous cell cycle regulators following pX expression in the 3pX-1 and 4pX-1 cell lines. We report 1) a differential pX-dependent cell cycle entry between the two cell lines; 2) a mechanistic link of cell cycle progression to the pX-reprogrammed mitogenic status of each cell line; and 3) the novel observation that pX expression effects a pronounced S phase pause or growth retardation in the dedifferentiated 4pX-1 cell line. Despite initiating this S phase pause, pX expression in the interval analyzed does not sensitize 4pX-1 cells to apoptosis, suggesting that pX deregulates the G2/M checkpoint. Cell lines 3pX-1 and 4pX-1, derived from AML12 cells (38Wu J.C. Merlino G. Fausto N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cellular extract (500 μg) was immunoprecipitated with Cdk4 antibody (H-22; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), Cdc2 antibody (H-297; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or Cdc2 and cyclin B1 (H-433; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) antibodies for 2 h at 4 °C, followed by the addition of 25 μl of a 50% slurry of protein A-agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 1 h at 4 °C. The protein A-agarose-antibody complex was washed three times with 500 μl of radioimmune precipitation buffer lacking detergents and resuspended in 20 μl of kinase buffer containing 40 mm Hepes, pH 7.0, 10 mm EDTA, 20 mmMgCl2, 20 μm ATP, 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, and 1 μg of GST-Rb (SantaCruz Biotechnology) substrate for Cdk4 or Cdc2 kinase assays or 5 μg of histone H1 (Sigma) substrate for Cdc2 kinase assays.

Cdc2 phosphorylation at Tyr15 was examined by Western blots with Tyr(P) antibody (PY99; Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Whole cell extracts (500 μg), isolated from cells grown in 10% FCS with or without 5 μg/ml tetracycline for the indicated time course, were immunoprecipitated with Cdc2 antibody. Immunoprecipitates were analyzed by 12% SDS-PAGE, immunoblotted with Tyr(P) antibody, and visualized using the ECL reagent (Amersham Biotechnology, Inc.). 3pX-1 and 4pX-1 cells, 70–90% confluent, were grown in 10% FCS with or without 5 μg/ml tetracycline for the indicated time course. Cells were resuspended in PBS at a density of 2 × 106 cells/ml. An equal volume of Vindelov's propidium iodide solution, containing 10 mmTris, pH 8.0, 10 mm NaCl, 10 μg/ml RNase A, 50 μg/ml propidium iodide, and 0.001% Nonidet P-40, was added to the cell suspension, and cells were incubated on ice for 30 min. An XL-MCL flow cytometer was used to analyze DNA content; emitted light was measured at 675 nm. Our studies to date, employing the two conditional pX-expressing 3pX-1 and 4pX-1 cell lines, have identified distinct and different pX-dependent properties. First, pX expression causes cellular transformation only in the differentiated hepatocyte 3pX-1 cell line and not in the dedifferentiated hepatocyte 4pX-1 cell line (32Tarn C. Bilodeau M.L. Hullinger R.L. Andrisani O.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2327-2336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Second, pX activates in a sustained manner the Ras-Raf-MAPK pathway in 3pX-1 cells and the JNK pathway in 4pX-1 cells (36Tarn C. Lee S. Hu Y. Ashendel C. Andrisani O.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34671-34680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Given these differences, we examined the pX-dependent cell cycle progression of these two cell lines and the implications of this cell cycle progression for their distinctive cell growth characteristics. Entry of cells into the G1 phase of the cell cycle is characterized by transcriptional induction and synthesis of cyclin D1 protein (41Huang T.S. Duyster J. Wang J.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4793-4797Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 42Albanese C. Johnson J. Wantanabe G. Eklund N. Vu D. Arnold A. Pestell R.G. J. Biol.

A. 1996; 93: 12861-12866Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar), which complexes and activates G1-specific Cdk4/6 kinases, required for progression through the early G1 phase (44Sherr C.J. Cell. 1993; 73: 1059-1065Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1996) Google Scholar, 45Sherr C.J. Cell. 1994; 79: 551-555Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2601) Google Scholar). Accordingly, we performed kinetic analyses of the expression pattern of cyclin D1 mRNA in the two cell lines, as a function of pX synthesis by tetracycline removal. Total RNA was isolated at 6, 12, 18, and 24 h after pX expression, from 3pX-1 and 4pX-1 cells grown in 2% FBS after serum starvation (32Tarn C. Bilodeau M.L. Hullinger R.L. Andrisani O.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2327-2336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 36Tarn C. Lee S. Hu Y. Ashendel C. Andrisani O.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34671-34680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The pX-dependent expression of cyclin D1 mRNA was quantified by real time PCR, using the PerkinElmer 5700 GeneAmp sequence detection system and GAPDH as the internal control (Fig.1 A). The GAPDH standard curve employed for quantitation of our real time PCR assays is shown (Fig.1 A) and is described under “Materials and Methods.” We observe (Fig. 1) that expression of cyclin D1 mRNA displays a differential rate of pX-dependent (−Tet/+Tet) transcriptional induction in the two cell lines. In 4pX-1 cells (Fig.1 B), within 6 h of pX synthesis, expression of cyclin D1 mRNA increased by nearly 2-fold, in contrast to the +Tet control. Interestingly, this increased pX-dependent expression of cyclin D1 mRNA is maintained at nearly the same level by 12 h of pX synthesis and is slightly decreased to ∼1.5-fold by 18 and 24 h following pX synthesis. To confirm these observations by another assay, we measured in vitro the activity of cyclin D1-activated Cdk4 kinase (39Sewing A. Wiseman B. Lloyd A.C. Land H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5588-5597Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar), employing cellular extracts isolated from 4pX-1 cells in a time course (6–24 h), following pX synthesis by tetracycline removal (Fig.1 B). In vitro Cdk4 kinase assays (Fig.1 B) demonstrate that in 4pX-1 cells, the Cdk4 kinase is activated within 6 h of pX synthesis, with maximal activation occurring within 12 h of pX expression. This pattern of Cdk4 kinase activation in 4pX-1 cells (Fig. 1 B) agrees with the pX-dependent expression profile of cyclin D1(Fig. 1 B). In 3pX-1 cells (Fig. 1 C), pX-dependent transcriptional induction of cyclin D1 displays a progressive increase from 1.5-fold to nearly 2-fold, starting at 6 h and reaching maximal expression by 12 h after pX synthesis. In contrast to 4pX-1 cells (Fig. 1 B) in 3pX-1 cells, pX-dependent cyclin D1 expression decreases to 10% by 18 h and ceases by 24 h of pX synthesis. The in vitro Cdk4 assays employing cellular extracts from 3pX-1 cells demonstrate a delayed pX-dependent activation, occurring on or before the 12-h time point of pX synthesis. Maximal Cdk4 kinase activation is observed at 18 h of pX expression (i.e.after the maximal pX-dependent cyclin D1induction, which occurs at 12 h of pX expression) (Fig.1 C). We conclude that in 3pX-1 cells, the maximal pX-dependent cyclin D1 expression agrees with the delayed Cdk4 kinase activation (Fig. 1 C). In summary, both 3pX-1 and 4pX-1 cells display pX-dependent cyclin D1 expression and Cdk4 kinase activation, indicating that both cell lines undergo pX-dependent cell cycle entry, in agreement with similar observations by others (28Benn J. Schneider R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11215-11219Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). These comparative analyses demonstrate that the pX-nontransforming 4pX-1 cells display an earlier cell cycle entry, in contrast to the delayed cell cycle progression of the pX-transforming 3pX-1 cells. Expression of the cyclin A gene occurs during late G1 and S phase (46Henglein B. Chenivesse X. Wang J. Eick D. Bréchot C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5490-5494Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Studies have demonstrated that the presence of cyclin A protein coincides with incorporation of bromodeoxyuridine into DNA (47Girard F. Strausfeld U. Fernandez A. Lamb N.J.C. Cell. 1991; 67: 1169-1179Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (744) Google Scholar). Thus, the cyclin A protein serves as a marker for progression of cells into S phase. Additional S phase-specific genes include dihydrofolate reductase and DNA polymerase α, among others (48Slansky J.E. Li T. Kaelin W.G. Farnham P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1610-1618Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Accordingly, we have employed the real time quantitative PCR to assess expression of cyclin A and DHFR mRNAs as indicators for pX-dependent entry of 3pX-1 and 4pX-1 cells into S phase (Fig. 2). 4pX-1 cells display a 1.6-fold pX-dependent increase in expression of cyclin A mRNA within 6 h after pX synthesis, reaching a maximal 2.6-fold increase by 12 h after pX synthesis (Fig. 2 A). Importantly, the pX-dependent expression pattern of cyclin A mRNA parallels the pX-dependent induction of DHFR mRNA (Fig.2 A). Considering that maximal cyclin D1 (Fig.1 B) and cyclin A and DHFR (Fig. 2 A) expression in 4pX-1 cells occur at 6 and 12 h, respectively, following pX expression, we conclude that these cells display a short, pX-dependent progression through G1 phase. By contrast, pX-dependent cyclin A and DHFR mRNA expression in 3pX-1 cells progressively increase from 1.3-fold, starting at 6 h, reaching a maximum 2.2-fold induction 18 h after pX synthesis (Fig. 2 B). Thus, in 3pX-1 cells, maximal pX-dependent transcriptional induction of cyclin D1 (Fig. 1 C) and cyclin A (Fig. 2 B) occur at 12 and 18 h, respectively, after pX synthesis, indicating that, in comparison with 4pX-1 cells, 3pX-1 cells display delayed, pX-dependent progression to S phase. Activation of mitotic Cdk-cyclin complexes promotes progression through the G2/M transition (49Nurse P. Nature. 1990; 334: 503-508Crossref Scopus (2233) Google Scholar, 50van den Huevel S. Harlow E. Science. 1993; 262: 2050-2054Crossref PubMed Scopus (979) Google Scholar). The mitotic Cdc2 kinase is a cell cycle-regulated gene (51Dalton S. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1797-1804Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar) whose expression is undetectable in quiescent cells but increases starting at the G1/S transition, reaching maximal levels at G2 phase (52Hwang A. Maity A. McKenna W.G. Muschel R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28419-28424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Activation of Cdc2 kinase required for G2/M progression, is mediated by association with cyclin B1 (53Gautier J. Minshull J. Lohka M. Glotzer M. Hunt T. Maller J.L. Cell. 1990; 60: 487-494Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). We employed real time quantitative PCR to assess pX-dependent induction of cdc2 and cyclin B1 mRNAs in 3pX-1 and 4pX-1 cells (Fig.3, A and B). We observe a progressive pX-dependent expression ofcdc2 mRNA in 3pX-1 cells, starting at 6 h and reaching a pronounced maximal 5-fold induction at 18 h after initiation of pX synthesis (Fig. 3 A). Maximal 2.2-fold pX-dependent increase in cyclin B1 mRNA is observed at 12 h following pX synthesis (Fig. 3 A). Surprisingly, pX-dependent cdc2 mRNA induction in 4pX-1 cells is small, ranging from 1.4-fold at 6 h to a maximal 2.5-fold induction by 12 h of pX synthesis. pX-dependent induction of cdc2 mRNA is not observed at 18 and 24 h after pX synthesis in 4pX-1 cells (Fig.3 B). Likewise, in 4pX-1 cells, the maximal pX-dependent cyclin B1 induction is only 1.5-fold, occurring by 12 h of pX synthesis. To co"
https://openalex.org/W2059990422,"Sodium and potassium-exchanging adenosine triphosphatase (Na,K-ATPase) in the kidney is associated with the γ subunit (γ, FXYD2), a single-span membrane protein that modulates ATPase properties. Rat and human γ occur in two splice variants, γa and γb, with different N termini. Here we investigated their structural heterogeneity and functional effects on Na,K-ATPase properties. Both forms were post-translationally modified duringin vitro translation with microsomes, indicating that there are four possible forms of γ. Site-directed mutagenesis revealed Thr2 and Ser5 as potential sites for post-translational modification. Similar modification can occur in cells, with consequences for Na,K-ATPase properties. We showed previously that stable transfection of γa into NRK-52E cells resulted in reduction of apparent affinities for Na+ and K+. Individual clones differed in γ post-translational modification, however, and the effect on Na+ affinity was absent in clones with full modification. Here, transfection of γb also resulted in clones with or without post-translational modification. Both groups showed a reduction in Na+ affinity, but modification was required for the effect on K+ affinity. There were minor increases in ATP affinity. The physiological importance of the reduction in Na+ affinity was shown by the slower growth of γa, γb, and γb′ transfectants in culture. The differential influence of the four structural variants of γ on affinities of the Na,K-ATPase for Na+ and K+, together with our previous finding of different distributions of γa and γb along the rat nephron, suggests a highly specific mode of regulation of sodium pump properties in kidney.

K-ATPase, sodium and potassium-exchanging adenosine triphosphatase human embryonic kidney N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine gene nomenclature based on a conserved motif, Phe-X-Tyr-Asp, pronounced like “fix-it.” The Na,K-ATPase,1 or sodium pump, is the principal enzyme in animal cells that maintains ionic gradients of Na+ and K+ at the expense of ATP hydrolysis. In kidney, the Na+ gradient provides the driving force not only for the reabsorption of sodium, but also for secondary transepithelial transport of various essential solutes and water. Controlling sodium pump activity is thus an essential element of renal regulation.The Na,K-ATPase has two obligatory subunits, the catalytic α subunit and a glycoprotein, β, which are encoded by multigene families (1Lingrel J.B. Orlowski J. Shull M.M. Price E.M. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1990; 38: 37-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). Expression of α and β isoforms is developmentally regulated, and appears to be species- and tissue-specific (2Sweadner K.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 988: 185-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (864) Google Scholar, 3Blanco G. Mercer R.W. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: F633-F650PubMed Google Scholar). In several experimental expression systems, the exchange of either α or β subunit isoforms affected enzymatic properties of the complex, most notably affinities for K+ and Na+ (3Blanco G. Mercer R.W. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: F633-F650PubMed Google Scholar). Functional differences in intrinsic properties of Na,K-ATPase have been reported in the kidney; the affinity for Na+ varies significantly along the rat and rabbit nephron (4Feraille E. Carranza M.L. Rousselot M. Favre H. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: F55-F62Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Feraille E. Carranza M.L. Buffin-Meyer B. Rousselot M. Doucet A. Favre H. Am. J.

This led to an effort in many laboratories to determine whether α and β isoforms could account for the differences, but no segment-specific localization of isoforms other than α1 and β1 was found for either mRNA or protein (8Farman N.

Kaplan J.H. Hoffman J.F. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 3667-3676Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 14Mercer R.W. Biemesderfer D. Bliss Jr., D.P. Collins J.H. Forbush III., B. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 579-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), and CHIF (“channel-inducing factor”) (15Attali B. Latter H. Rachamim N. Garty H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Based on sequence homology, both proteins belong to the FXYD gene family, which unites small (5–15 kDa) single-span membrane proteins including phospholemman (17Palmer C.J. Scott D. Jones L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11126-11130Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), MAT-8 (“mammary tumor antigen-8”) (18Morrison B.W. Moorman J.R. Kowdley G.C. Kobayashi Y.M. Jones L.R. Leder P. J.

Genomics. 2000; 68: 41-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). Although Na,K-ATPase is widely distributed in kidney, expression of γ and CHIF is segment-specific. γ co-localizes with Na,K-ATPase in proximal tubules, distal convoluted tubules, and medullary thick ascending limb (21Pu H.X.

Physiol. 2001; 280: F505-F512Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).The functional significance of γ (FXYD2) for the Na,K-ATPase complex was a mystery for a long time. The key properties of the Na,K-ATPase (ouabain binding, enzymatic activity, and cation transport) can be obtained without it (24Freytag J.W. FEBS Lett. 1983; 159: 280-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 25DeTomaso A.W. Xie Z.J. Liu G. Mercer R.W. J. Biol.

It is also not required for αβ assembly and transport of functional units to the plasma membrane (27Geering K. Beggah A. Good P. Girardet S. Roy S. Schaer D. Jaunin P. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 1193-1204Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). However, incorporation of a photoaffinity-labeled derivative of ouabain into γ as well as α suggested that it may comprise part of the ouabain-binding site (13Forbush III, B. Kaplan J.H. Hoffman J.F. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 3667-3676Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar).The first clear effect of γ on Na,K-ATPase transport properties was detected by electrophysiological measurements in Xenopusoocytes. It influenced the apparent affinity of the Na,K-ATPase pump current for extracellular K+ (28Beguin P. Wang X. Firsov D. Puoti A. Claeys D. Horisberger J.D. Geering K. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4250-4260Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). An antibody against γ inhibited Na,K-ATPase in vitro and decreased affinity for ATP (29Therien A.G. Goldshleger R. Karlish S.J.D. Blostein R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32628-32634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The functional role of γ was further assessed with γ-transfected mammalian cells. In HEK cells, γ increased affinity for ATP (30Therien A.G. Karlish S.J.D. Blostein R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12252-12256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). NRK-52E cells express the same α1β1 combination as kidney but no γ, and apparent affinities for Na+ and K+ were higher than for α1β1γ from renal medulla (31Arystarkhova E. Wetzel R.K. Asinovski N.K. Sweadner K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33183-33185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Stable transfection of γa (the only known splice variant at the time) resulted in a reduction of affinities for Na+ and K+. This was observed with partially purified enzyme, indicating a stable functional alteration of enzyme properties. Interestingly, the modulation of Na+ affinity was abolished by a post-translational modification of γ that occurred in cell culture and that shifted its gel mobility (31Arystarkhova E. Wetzel R.K. Asinovski N.K. Sweadner K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33183-33185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). A comparable decrease in apparent Na+ affinity has recently been ascribed to an increase in K+ antagonism of cytoplasmic Na+activation in γ-transfected HeLa cells (21Pu H.X. Cluzeaud F.

Similarly, γ was shown to influence Na,K-ATPase pump current by lowering the apparent affinity for intracellular Na+ (32Beguin P. Crambert G. Guennoun S. Garty H. Horisberger J.-D. Geering K. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3993-4002Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The injection of CHIF cRNA intoXenopus oocytes, in contrast, resulted in an increase in apparent affinity for Na+ (32Beguin P. Crambert G. Guennoun S. Garty H. Horisberger J.-D. Geering K. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3993-4002Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Taken together with the almost complementary distributions of γ and CHIF along the rat nephron (16Shi H. Levy-Holzman R. Cluzeaud F. Farman N. Garty H. Am. J.

Physiol. 2001; 281: F531-F545Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the functional data correlate very well with the differences in Na+ affinities in successive segments of the nephron (4Feraille E.

Genomics. 2000; 68: 41-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar, 34Sweadner K.J. Rael E. Wetzel R.K. Arystarkhova E. Taniguchi K. Kaya S. Na/K-ATPase and Related ATPases.

The splice forms colocalized in the inner stripe of the outer medulla in the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle (21Pu H.X. Cluzeaud F. Goldshleger R. Karlish S.J.D. Farman N. Blostein R. J.

Wetzel R.K. Sweadner K.J. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: F393-F407Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Our observations indicate that their distribution in renal cortex and outer stripe of the outer medulla, however, is strongly biased to different segments. γa predominated in proximal tubules, whereas γb was detected only in distal and connecting tubules and the thick ascending limb in the outer stripe (23Arystarkhova E. Wetzel R.K. Sweadner K.J. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: F393-F407Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Very recently, a third splice variant of γ has been described in mouse (36Jones D.H. Golding M.C. Barr K.J. Fong G.-H. Kidder G.M. Physiol. Genom. 2001; 6: 129-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), although not in human (37Sweadner K.J. Wetzel R.K. Arystarkhova E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 279: 196-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). All of the splice variants in these characterized genes have different promoters, which provides a basis for differential regulation of gene expression.Here we have investigated the functional properties of γ subunit splice variants. Others have reported that γa and γb have similar effects on intrinsic properties of the pump. Both splice variants decreased apparent affinity for Na+ without significant alteration of K+ affinity in HeLa transfected cells (21Pu H.X. Cluzeaud F. Goldshleger R. Karlish S.J.D. Farman N. Blostein R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20370-20378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) and in Xenopus oocytes (32Beguin P. Crambert G. Guennoun S. Garty H. Horisberger J.-D. Geering K. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3993-4002Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), and increasedK m for ATP in HeLa transfectants (21Pu H.X. Cluzeaud F. Goldshleger R. Karlish S.J.D. Farman N. Blostein R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20370-20378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). We find, however, that post-translational modifications that occur in some but not all NRK-52E clones stably expressing γa or γb affect the final enzyme properties; consequently, γa can have modulating effects on Na,K-ATPase activity different from that of γb. Taken together with the differential distribution of γa and γb in kidney, the regulatory effects of γ on intrinsic properties of the Na,K-ATPase appear to be subject to multiple layers of control. Preliminary reports have been presented (38Arystarkhova E. Wetzel R.K. Rael E. Asinovski N.K. Sweadner K. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 279AGoogle Scholar, 39Arystarkhova E. Asinovski N.K. Sweadner K.J. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2000; 11: 24AGoogle Scholar).DISCUSSIONRegulation of Na,K-ATPase activity in kidney is under several layers of control (48Feraille E. Doucet A. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 345-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). Although long term alterations involve changes in the number of pump units at the level of gene expression, short term regulators cause rapid modulation of enzyme activity either through recruitment of a latent pool of Na,K-ATPase or through fine-tuning of already existing complexes. The discovery that small single-span membrane proteins (the γ subunit and CHIF) regulate the intrinsic properties of the pump through association with αβ provides an additional framework for understanding renal control of Na+and K+ balance. A fundamental issue is why different splice variants of γ are expressed in kidney and whether they serve distinct functions. The major outcome is the observation that the splice variants may in fact differentially influence the affinities for the major ligands, Na+ and K+.Structural Forms of γThe appearance of γ on SDS gels was a mystery for a long time. The doublet was first interpreted as post-translational modification of the protein based on in vitro biosynthesis studies (14Mercer R.W. Biemesderfer D. Bliss Jr., D.P. Collins J.H. Forbush III., B. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 579-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). In papers from 1999 and earlier, interpretations of doublets as modified forms of a single γ subunit, as well as interpretations of the significance of their susceptibility to tryptic digestion, were confounded by not knowing about γb (29Therien A.G.

Genomics. 2000; 68: 41-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar, 36Jones D.H. Golding M.C. Barr K.J. Fong G.-H. Kidder G.M. Physiol.

Commun. 2000; 279: 196-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), mass spectroscopy (35Küster B. Shainskaya A. Pu H.X. Goldshleger R. Blostein R. Karlish S.J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18441-18446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), and immunostaining with specific antibodies (23Arystarkhova E. Wetzel R.K. Sweadner K.J. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: F393-F407Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 35Küster B. Shainskaya A. Pu H.X. Goldshleger R. Blostein R. Karlish S.J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18441-18446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) showed splice variants to form the γ doublet. We have confirmed these conclusions with in vitro translation; despite the very close molecular masses of γa and γb, the proteins migrated differently on SDS gels. The electrophoretic separation was even more pronounced when canine microsomes were added. Evidence was obtained that both splice variants can be post-translationally modified, yielding four structural forms of γ. Our findings are in line with the recent report that demonstrated that both splice variants of γ were susceptible to post-translational modification in vitro, as was CHIF (32Beguin P. Crambert G. Guennoun S. Garty H. Horisberger J.-D. Geering K. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3993-4002Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Interestingly, our data showed that, despite the extensive identity between γa and γb, their susceptibility to modification in vitro appeared to be different. The electrophoretic mobility of γb was changed to a lesser extent than that of γa, implying involvement of the variable N-terminal segment. This was supported by site-directed mutagenesis in the N-terminal segment of γa. When either Thr2 or Ser5 was replaced by Ala, the change in mobility upon addition of pancreatic microsomes was almost completely blocked. On the other hand, some shift in mobility was retained when Ser11was replaced. The results suggest that the observed changes in migration were not caused simply by substitution of hydrophobic for oxygen-containing amino acids, and that modification of more than one site may be involved in γa, perhaps including Ser11 in the shared sequence. Others have reported that mutations outside of the N terminus (the common FXYD motif and C-terminal domain) had no effect on formation of doublets (32Beguin P. Crambert G. Guennoun S. Garty H. Horisberger J.-D. Geering K. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3993-4002Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar).The factors that determine the anomalous mobility of γ splice variants are not clear, but something similar occurs with the catalytic subunit of the Na,K-ATPase, where α3, the smallest among the four known isoforms, migrates slowest. The N terminus of γb has more bulky hydrophobic residues (tryptophan, tyrosine) and less net negative charge than that of γa.Mass spectroscopy of γ from rat kidney did not reveal any sign of modified structure other than removal of the N-terminal methionine from γa and acetylation of the N-terminal methionine in γb (35Küster B. Shainskaya A. Pu H.X. Goldshleger R. Blostein R. Karlish S.J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18441-18446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Although the size of the acetyl group is rather small to be detected on SDS gels (42 Da), it could have changed the binding of SDS through an effect on charge. Because we found functional differences between γb and γb′, the challenge would be to test whether deacetylation of γb could in fact lead to modulation of apparent affinity for K+. Interestingly, there is a precedent from the literature that acetylation of the N-terminal methionine in phospholamban, a single-span regulatory protein from a different gene family, significantly changed its inhibition of the sarcoplasmic, endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (49Starling A.P. Sharma R.P. East J.M. Lee A.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 226: 352-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar).The findings suggesting no other post-translational modification of γ in kidney (35Küster B. Shainskaya A. Pu H.X. Goldshleger R. Blostein R. Karlish S.J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18441-18446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) must be considered carefully. First, the post-translational modification(s) could be chemically unstable in the conditions used for peptide purification. Both γ bands had blocked N termini, precluding direct sequencing (29Therien A.G. Goldshleger R. Karlish S.J.D. Blostein R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32628-32634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), but this would not be expected for γa if it has no initiation methionine and no other added mass. Second, the Na,K-ATPase used for mass spectroscopy was apparently purified from rat kidney outer medulla (based on its high specific activity). We, however, have identified proximal tubules as a potential source for modified γa, which migrated slower on SDS gels compared with samples from outer medulla (23Arystarkhova E. Wetzel R.K. Sweadner K.J. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: F393-F407Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Finally, post-translational modification of the protein could be dependent on the physiological status of the animal, and turned on and off in response to need. The mass spectroscopy studies were performed with hypertensive rats (35Küster B. Shainskaya A. Pu H.X. Goldshleger R. Blostein R. Karlish S.J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18441-18446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Regulation of Na,K-ATPase is known to be implicated in hypertension (50Aperia A. Curr. Hypertens. Rep. 2001; 3: 165-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar).Three lines of evidence demonstrate that γ undergoes post-translational modification when expressed in NRK-52E cells. First, shifts in electrophoretic mobility in transfected cells were always toward higher molecular weight species. Second, with specific antibodies, we showed that both N and C termini of γb were preserved. (Unfortunately, the available antibodies against the N terminus of γa do not recognize the SDS-denatured protein with enough sensitivity to do this experiment.) Third, the changes in the migration rate of γa and γb from transfectants were similar to that observed duringin vitro translation with and without pancreatic microsomes.Additional bands seen on Western blots of transfected HeLa and HEK cells (21Pu H.X.

Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18441-18446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) have led to some confusion, however. In both cell types, γa in transfectants appeared to migrate faster than the upper band of the kidney-derived doublet (35Küster B. Shainskaya A. Pu H.X. Goldshleger R. Blostein R. Karlish S.J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18441-18446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Because the blot was stained for the C terminus, this could be indicative of either proteolysis at the N terminus of γa in transfectants or a post-translational modification of γa in renal membranes. The lower band seen in HEK-γa could conceivably represent a product of proteolysis or, alternatively, an adduct with a qualitatively different effect on mobility. The position of the upper band in HeLa-γb (21Pu H.X. Cluzeaud F. Goldshleger R. Karlish S.J.D. Farman N. Blostein R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20370-20378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) was much higher than would be expected for modified γb based onin vitro translation studies (this work or Ref. 32Beguin P.

Further identification of cell-specific modifications of γ and elucidation of its possible role in the Na,K-ATPase are required.Functional Effects of γ: Apparent Affinities for Ions and ATPGeneral agreement has finally been reached that a major effect of γ is related to Na+ affinity (21Pu H.X.

The consequences of post-translational modification and effects of γ on ATP affinity are not well understood, and there are differences in technical details, and in interpretations of results, that should be reconciled.The observation that Na+ and K+ affinities could be modified independently of each other through modification of γa and γb (Table IV) implies that the structural differences are functionally important.

Advances in Biochemical Engineering/Bio/Technology: Biopolyesters. Springer-Verlag, Heidelberg2001: 1-49Google Scholar). Conidia of highly virulent pathogens, which can directly penetrate through the cuticle, have low levels of cutinase that release small amounts of cutin monomers when the conidia contact the host surface (3Köller W. Allan C.R. Kolattukudy P.E. Physiol. Plant Pathol. 1982; 20: 47-60Crossref Scopus (56) Google Scholar). These monomers transcriptionally activate the expression of an inducible cutinase gene that is responsible for the production of high levels of cutinase that assist the infection peg to gain entry into the host through the cuticle (4Woloshuk C.P. Kolattukudy P.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 1704-1708Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A cis element essential for the inducible expression of cutinase gene was found to be located at −159 bp in the promoter of this gene (5Kämper J.T. Kämper U. Rogers L.M. Kolattukudy P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9195-9204Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in Fusarium solani f.pisi (Nectria haematococca). In this region, two overlapping palindromes were found. Palindrome 2 was found to be necessary for the inducible cutinase gene expression (5Kämper J.T. Kämper U. Rogers L.M. Kolattukudy P.E. J. Biol.

CTF1α, a 101-kDa protein, contains a Cys6Zn2binuclear cluster motif, sharing homology to the Cys6Zn2 binuclear cluster DNA-binding domains of transcription factors from yeast and filamentous fungi. Whether the constitutively expressed cutinase and the inducible cutinase are encoded by the same or different genes is not known, and the nature of the transcription factors that are involved in the constitutive expression of cutinase is unknown. Two different but very similar cutinases had been isolated from F. solani pisi (8Purdy R.E. Kolattukudy P.E. Biochemistry. 1975; 14: 2824-2831Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 9Purdy R.E. Kolattukudy P.E. Biochemistry. 1975; 14: 2832-2840Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), and the gene previously cloned matched the amino acid sequence of one of these proteins (10Soliday C.L. Flurkey W.H. Okita T.W. Kolattukudy P.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 3939-3943Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that another gene encodes the other. Such a gene had not been previously cloned, although Southern analysis had indicated the presence of multiple cutinase genes in the F. solani pisi genome (11Woloshuk C.P. Cutinase of Fusarium solani f. sp. Pisi. Washington State University, Pullman, WA1986Google Scholar). In this paper, we describe cloning of two highly homologous genes in addition to the one that encodes the inducible cutinase. The newly cloned gene sequences contain a segment that matches the amino acid sequence of a peptide from cutinase 2, isolated from the fungus. The palindrome 1 of the additional cutinase genes contains two nucleotide differences from that of the previously cloned inducible cutinase gene (cut1). We show that PBP is unable to bind the palindrome 1 of the newly cloned genes. We report cloning of a second cutinase transcription factor (CTF1β), also containing a Cys6Zn2 binuclear cluster motif, that binds palindrome 2. We demonstrate that in yeast CTF1β transactivates the promoter of cut2 but is not effective in transactivating cut1 promoter, except when its palindrome 1 is mutated and thus incapable of binding PBP and/or other repressor. Thus, CTF1β activates the constitutive expression of cut2, and the cutin monomers generated by this enzyme together with CTF1α transcriptionally activate the cut1 gene to cause highly induced expression of cutinase.DISCUSSIONThe first purification of fungal cutinase from the extracellular fluid of cutin-grown F. solani pisi yielded two enzymes of similar size (8Purdy R.E.

Amino acid sequence of some peptides obtained from one of these enzymes (cutinase 1) matched with that predicted from the cDNA of the induced cutinase transcript (10Soliday C.L. Flurkey W.H.

The present results reveal the occurrence of other cutinase genes that could encode enzymes that are similar but not identical to cutinase 1. Comparison of the amino acid sequences that would be encoded by the three cloned genes indicates that the two newly identified genes would encode proteins that are nearly identical, differing only in three amino acid residues. Among them only one, Ala14 → Asp, would affect the ionic status of the protein if this segment is retained in the mature protein. Thus, products of cut2 and cut3 probably would be inseparable by the protein fractionation methods used, and therefore the purified cutinase 2 might have contained products of both cut2 and cut3. If cut3 is not expressed at significant levels either constitutively or under the induction conditions used, the isolated cutinases 1 and 2 might be products of cut1 and cut2, respectively.cut1, although similar, does not share the same degree of identity, suggesting that cut2 and cut3 probably originated from a more recent gene duplication when compared with the earlier divergence between the constitutive (cut2/3) and inducible (cut1) cutinase genes. This conclusion is consistent with our finding that cut2 and cut3 have exactly the same two nucleotide substitutions in the palindrome 1 in the promoter and with the finding that the size and sequence ofcut2 and cut3 intron are identical but distinctly different from those of cut1 intron.CTF1β shows characteristics of a transcription factor. The presence of putative nuclear localization signals suggested that CTF1β may be a nuclear protein. Binding to the palindromic DNA element in the cutinase promoter by the expressed segment of CTF1β is demonstrated. The N-terminal Cys6Zn(II)2 binuclear cluster motif found in CTF1β is probably involved in the binding to the palindrome. Such DNA-binding motifs are characteristic of other regulatory proteins such as GAL4 (29Laughon A.S. Gesteland R.F. Mol. Cell.

Payne G.A. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1994; 60: 2408-2414Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, CTF1β does not share homology to any other regions of those factors. Functionally, GAL4 is a positive activator that regulates the transcription of the galactose-inducible genesgal1,gal2,gal7,gal10, and mel1 (29Laughon A.S. Gesteland R.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1984; 4: 260-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). PPR1 positively regulates transcription of the genes ura1, ura3, andura4 involved in controlling pyrimidine levels (31Kammerer B. Guyonvarch A. Hubert J.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1984; 180: 239-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Some of these protein factors recognize a DNA sequence with two inverted repeats of CGG elements separated by a spacing characteristic of the specific protein factor (44Marmorstein R. Harrison S.C. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2504-2512Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). For example, PPR1 recognizes 5′-CGG(n 6)CCG with a spacer of 6 nucleotides, whereas the spacing for GAL4, PUT3, PPR1, and LEU3 is 11, 10, 6, and 4 nucleotides, respectively (45Zhang L. Guarente L. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2110-2119Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). HAP1, on the other hand, binds a direct repeat of CGG triplet with a spacer of 6 nucleotides (44Marmorstein R. Harrison S.C. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2504-2512Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Interestingly, CTF1α and CTF1β bind to a palindrome with an oppositely oriented 5′-GCC(n 2)GGC (5Kämper J.T. Kämper U. Rogers L.M. Kolattukudy P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9195-9204Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).The transcription factor CTF1α binds palindrome 2 of cut1 promoter that is known to be essential for cutinase induction by cutin monomers. In vivo CTF1α, in fact, transactivatescut1 promoter in yeast. However, another transcription factor, CTF1β that has now been cloned as described here, does not transactivate cut1 promoter but it transactivatescut2 promoter. The chief difference between the promoters ofcut1 gene and cut2/3 genes in the palindromic promoter region is that there are two nucleotide substitutions in palindrome 1. Here we show that PBP binds palindrome 1 ofcut1, whereas it does not bind palindrome 1 ofcut2/3. If palindrome 1 of cut1 is occupied by PBP, then CTF1α may not be able to bind palindrome 2 of the promoter because of steric hindrance and thus would not induce the transcription of cut1 gene. On the other hand, CTF1β may bind palindrome 2 of cut2/3 because palindrome 1 of this gene cannot bind PBP because of the nucleotide substitutions in this palindrome. The hypothesis that PBP may function as a repressor of cut1 is consistent with our previous finding that mutations in palindrome 1 ofcut1 promoter fused to cat reporter gene increased the inductibility of this promoter 2-fold when assayed inF. solani pisi transformants generated with this promoter fusion construct (5Kämper J.T. Kämper U. Rogers L.M. Kolattukudy P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9195-9204Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The transactivation of cat gene expressed under the control of cutinase gene promoters by CTF1β in yeast is consistent with this hypothesis.The results presented here and previously published results suggest the following mechanism by which a Cys6Zn2transcription factor causes constitutive expression of one cutinase gene whose product generates an inducer from cutin in the environment, and this inducer uses a different Cys6Zn2transcription factor to cause induction of high levels of cutinase (Fig. 9). (The speculative part of the hypothesis is indicated by dotted lines and lowercase letters.) Cutinase gene promoter contains two overlapping palindromic elements. Proteins that bind the two palindromes regulate the transcription of cutinase genes. CTF1α and CTF1β both bind palindrome 2. In the absence of PBP binding to palindrome 1 ofcut2, CTF1β can bind palindrome 2 and activatecut2 gene transcription, albeit at low levels, explaining the constitutive production of low levels of cutinase. Palindrome 1 ofcut1 binds PBP, and the bound PBP interferes with CTF1α binding to palindrome 2. We postulate that the presence of high levels of CTF1α may allow it to overcome the interference from PBP and thus bind palindrome 2 of cut1 and transcriptionally activate it and thus cause production of high levels of cutinase. From the amino acid sequence it is clear that the major induced protein is in fact encoded by cut1. CTF1α promoter does contain an element that binds a transcription factor that has been cloned. 3D. Li and P. E. Kolattukudy, unpublished observations. We postulate that cutin monomer-dependent phosphorylation that has been detected previously (1Kolattukudy P.E. Rogers L.M. Li D. Hwang C.H. Flaishman M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4080-4087Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 16Bajar A. Podila G.K. Kolattukudy P.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 8208-8212Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) is involved in the transcriptional activation of ctf1α gene, possibly by direct phosphorylation of the transcription factor that bindsctf1α promoter, although we do not have direct evidence for this hypothesis (indicated by the dotted lines andlowercase letters in Fig. 9). It is also possible that the repressor (PBP) binding may be diminished by cutin monomer-dependent phosphorylation of PBP. However, the identity of the phosphorylated protein remains uncertain.Functions of zinc finger proteins in the regulation of processes relevant to fungal pathogenesis are not well understood. The presence of multiple zinc finger proteins and possible roles in regulating multiple processes complicate the picture. In the present case, two zinc finger proteins with a relatively low degree of overall identity (17%) regulate the expression of two different genes with a high degree of selectivity. CTF1α disruption eliminated phytopathogenicity of F. solani pisi without any detectable change in growth rate in cultures, although the decreased level of cutinase resulting from the CTF1α disruption was not adequate to explain the loss of virulence, as supplementation with cutinase did not restore pathogenicity.3 Thus, CTF1α may participate also in the regulation of other genes essential for pathogenesis. Obviously, CTF1β cannot substitute for CTF1α in this function, further illustrating the differential functions of these zinc finger proteins.In the field, the constitutively expressed low levels of cutinase from fungi would release cutin monomers from cutin found in their immediate environment, and these monomers would in turn induce the synthesis of high levels of the enzyme. Such a mechanism could allow saprophytic growth or growth into the host during infection, as in both cases the fungal conidia with their low level of cutinase contact cutin, presenting basically the same situation as far as induction is concerned. This molecular strategy is probably used widely by microbes to utilize insoluble polymers they find in their environment. The low levels of polymer-degrading enzymes secreted upon depletion of readily utilizable soluble nutrients generates soluble products (monomers or oligomers) that in turn induce high levels of the degrading enzymes that generate soluble nutrients from the insoluble polymer in the medium for growth of the microbe. We present evidence that constitutively expressed and induced cutinase genes use their own unique transcription factors. Whether the mechanism similar to that described here for cutinase is used for the constitutive and induced expression of the other polymer-degrading enzymes in general is not known. Fungal infection of plants can be assisted by extracellular cutinases that help the pathogen penetrate through the outermost cuticular barrier of the host (1Kolattukudy P.E. Rogers L.M. Li D. Hwang C.H. Flaishman M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4080-4087Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 2Kolattukudy P.E. Babel W. Steinbüchel A. Advances in Biochemical Engineering/Bio/Technology: Biopolyesters. Springer-Verlag, Heidelberg2001: 1-49Google Scholar). Conidia of highly virulent pathogens, which can directly penetrate through the cuticle, have low levels of cutinase that release small amounts of cutin monomers when the conidia contact the host surface (3Köller W. Allan C.R. Kolattukudy P.E. Physiol. Plant Pathol. 1982; 20: 47-60Crossref Scopus (56) Google Scholar). These monomers transcriptionally activate the expression of an inducible cutinase gene that is responsible for the production of high levels of cutinase that assist the infection peg to gain entry into the host through the cuticle (4Woloshuk C.P. Kolattukudy P.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 1704-1708Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A cis element essential for the inducible expression of cutinase gene was found to be located at −159 bp in the promoter of this gene (5Kämper J.T. Kämper U. Rogers L.M. Kolattukudy P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9195-9204Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in Fusarium solani f.pisi (Nectria haematococca). In this region, two overlapping palindromes were found. Palindrome 2 was found to be necessary for the inducible cutinase gene expression (5Kämper J.T. Kämper U. Rogers L.M. Kolattukudy P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9195-9204Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A protein that binds the palindromic region, called palindrome binding protein (PBP),1 (6Li D. Kolattukudy P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11753-11756Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) and a cutinase transcription factor 1α (CTF1α), which selectively binds palindrome 2 and transactivates the cutinase promoter (7Li D. Kolattukudy P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12462-12467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), have been cloned. CTF1α, a 101-kDa protein, contains a Cys6Zn2binuclear cluster motif, sharing homology to the Cys6Zn2 binuclear cluster DNA-binding domains of transcription factors from yeast and filamentous fungi. Whether the constitutively expressed cutinase and the inducible cutinase are encoded by the same or different genes is not known, and the nature of the transcription factors that are involved in the constitutive expression of cutinase is unknown. Two different but very similar cutinases had been isolated from F. solani pisi (8Purdy R.E. Kolattukudy P.E. Biochemistry. 1975; 14: 2824-2831Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 9Purdy R.E. Kolattukudy P.E. Biochemistry. 1975; 14: 2832-2840Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), and the gene previously cloned matched the amino acid sequence of one of these proteins (10Soliday C.L. Flurkey W.H. Okita T.W. Kolattukudy P.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 3939-3943Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that another gene encodes the other. Such a gene had not been previously cloned, although Southern analysis had indicated the presence of multiple cutinase genes in the F. solani pisi genome (11Woloshuk C.P. Cutinase of Fusarium solani f. sp. Pisi. Washington State University, Pullman, WA1986Google Scholar). In this paper, we describe cloning of two highly homologous genes in addition to the one that encodes the inducible cutinase. The newly cloned gene sequences contain a segment that matches the amino acid sequence of a peptide from cutinase 2, isolated from the fungus. The palindrome 1 of the additional cutinase genes contains two nucleotide differences from that of the previously cloned inducible cutinase gene (cut1). We show that PBP is unable to bind the palindrome 1 of the newly cloned genes. We report cloning of a second cutinase transcription factor (CTF1β), also containing a Cys6Zn2 binuclear cluster motif, that binds palindrome 2. We demonstrate that in yeast CTF1β transactivates the promoter of cut2 but is not effective in transactivating cut1 promoter, except when its palindrome 1 is mutated and thus incapable of binding PBP and/or other repressor. Thus, CTF1β activates the constitutive expression of cut2, and the cutin monomers generated by this enzyme together with CTF1α transcriptionally activate the cut1 gene to cause highly induced expression of cutinase. DISCUSSIONThe first purification of fungal cutinase from the extracellular fluid of cutin-grown F. solani pisi yielded two enzymes of similar size (8Purdy R.E. Kolattukudy P.E. Biochemistry. 1975; 14: 2824-2831Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Amino acid sequence of some peptides obtained from one of these enzymes (cutinase 1) matched with that predicted from the cDNA of the induced cutinase transcript (10Soliday C.L. Flurkey W.H. Okita T.W. Kolattukudy P.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 3939-3943Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The present results reveal the occurrence of other cutinase genes that could encode enzymes that are similar but not identical to cutinase 1.

This conclusion is consistent with our finding that cut2 and cut3 have exactly the same two nucleotide substitutions in the palindrome 1 in the promoter and with the finding that the size and sequence ofcut2 and cut3 intron are identical but distinctly different from those of cut1 intron.CTF1β shows characteristics of a transcription factor. The presence of putative nuclear localization signals suggested that CTF1β may be a nuclear protein. Binding to the palindromic DNA element in the cutinase promoter by the expressed segment of CTF1β is demonstrated. The N-terminal Cys6Zn(II)2 binuclear cluster motif found in CTF1β is probably involved in the binding to the palindrome. Such DNA-binding motifs are characteristic of other regulatory proteins such as GAL4 (29Laughon A.S. Gesteland R.F. Mol. Cell.

Whether the mechanism similar to that described here for cutinase is used for the constitutive and induced expression of the other polymer-degrading enzymes in general is not known. The first purification of fungal cutinase from the extracellular fluid of cutin-grown F. solani pisi yielded two enzymes of similar size (8Purdy R.E. Kolattukudy P.E. Biochemistry. 1975; 14: 2824-2831Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Amino acid sequence of some peptides obtained from one of these enzymes (cutinase 1) matched with that predicted from the cDNA of the induced cutinase transcript (10Soliday C.L. Flurkey W.H. Okita T.W. Kolattukudy P.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 3939-3943Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The present results reveal the occurrence of other cutinase genes that could encode enzymes that are similar but not identical to cutinase 1. Comparison of the amino acid sequences that would be encoded by the three cloned genes indicates that the two newly identified genes would encode proteins that are nearly identical, differing only in three amino acid residues. Among them only one, Ala14 → Asp, would affect the ionic status of the protein if this segment is retained in the mature protein. Thus, products of cut2 and cut3 probably would be inseparable by the protein fractionation methods used, and therefore the purified cutinase 2 might have contained products of both cut2 and cut3. If cut3 is not expressed at significant levels either constitutively or under the induction conditions used, the isolated cutinases 1 and 2 might be products of cut1 and cut2, respectively.cut1, although similar, does not share the same degree of identity, suggesting that cut2 and cut3 probably originated from a more recent gene duplication when compared with the earlier divergence between the constitutive (cut2/3) and inducible (cut1) cutinase genes. This conclusion is consistent with our finding that cut2 and cut3 have exactly the same two nucleotide substitutions in the palindrome 1 in the promoter and with the finding that the size and sequence ofcut2 and cut3 intron are identical but distinctly different from those of cut1 intron. CTF1β shows characteristics of a transcription factor. The presence of putative nuclear localization signals suggested that CTF1β may be a nuclear protein. Binding to the palindromic DNA element in the cutinase promoter by the expressed segment of CTF1β is demonstrated. The N-terminal Cys6Zn(II)2 binuclear cluster motif found in CTF1β is probably involved in the binding to the palindrome. Such DNA-binding motifs are characteristic of other regulatory proteins such as GAL4 (29Laughon A.S. Gesteland R.F. Mol. Cell.

Payne G.A. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1994; 60: 2408-2414Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, CTF1β does not share homology to any other regions of those factors. Functionally, GAL4 is a positive activator that regulates the transcription of the galactose-inducible genesgal1,gal2,gal7,gal10, and mel1 (29Laughon A.S. Gesteland R.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1984; 4: 260-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). PPR1 positively regulates transcription of the genes ura1, ura3, andura4 involved in controlling pyrimidine levels (31Kammerer B. Guyonvarch A. Hubert J.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1984; 180: 239-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Some of these protein factors recognize a DNA sequence with two inverted repeats of CGG elements separated by a spacing characteristic of the specific protein factor (44Marmorstein R. Harrison S.C. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2504-2512Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). For example, PPR1 recognizes 5′-CGG(n 6)CCG with a spacer of 6 nucleotides, whereas the spacing for GAL4, PUT3, PPR1, and LEU3 is 11, 10, 6, and 4 nucleotides, respectively (45Zhang L. Guarente L. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2110-2119Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). HAP1, on the other hand, binds a direct repeat of CGG triplet with a spacer of 6 nucleotides (44Marmorstein R. Harrison S.C. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2504-2512Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Interestingly, CTF1α and CTF1β bind to a palindrome with an oppositely oriented 5′-GCC(n 2)GGC (5Kämper J.T. Kämper U. Rogers L.M. Kolattukudy P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9195-9204Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The transcription factor CTF1α binds palindrome 2 of cut1 promoter that is known to be essential for cutinase induction by cutin monomers. In vivo CTF1α, in fact, transactivatescut1 promoter in yeast. However, another transcription factor, CTF1β that has now been cloned as described here, does not transactivate cut1 promoter but it transactivatescut2 promoter. The chief difference between the promoters ofcut1 gene and cut2/3 genes in the palindromic promoter region is that there are two nucleotide substitutions in palindrome 1. Here we show that PBP binds palindrome 1 ofcut1, whereas it does not bind palindrome 1 ofcut2/3. If palindrome 1 of cut1 is occupied by PBP, then CTF1α may not be able to bind palindrome 2 of the promoter because of steric hindrance and thus would not induce the transcription of cut1 gene. On the other hand, CTF1β may bind palindrome 2 of cut2/3 because palindrome 1 of this gene cannot bind PBP because of the nucleotide substitutions in this palindrome. The hypothesis that PBP may function as a repressor of cut1 is consistent with our previous finding that mutations in palindrome 1 ofcut1 promoter fused to cat reporter gene increased the inductibility of this promoter 2-fold when assayed inF. solani pisi transformants generated with this promoter fusion construct (5Kämper J.T. Kämper U. Rogers L.M. Kolattukudy P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9195-9204Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The transactivation of cat gene expressed under the control of cutinase gene promoters by CTF1β in yeast is consistent with this hypothesis. The results presented here and previously published results suggest the following mechanism by which a Cys6Zn2transcription factor causes constitutive expression of one cutinase gene whose product generates an inducer from cutin in the environment, and this inducer uses a different Cys6Zn2transcription factor to cause induction of high levels of cutinase (Fig. 9). (The speculative part of the hypothesis is indicated by dotted lines and lowercase letters.) Cutinase gene promoter contains two overlapping palindromic elements. Proteins that bind the two palindromes regulate the transcription of cutinase genes. CTF1α and CTF1β both bind palindrome 2. In the absence of PBP binding to palindrome 1 ofcut2, CTF1β can bind palindrome 2 and activatecut2 gene transcription, albeit at low levels, explaining the constitutive production of low levels of cutinase. Palindrome 1 ofcut1 binds PBP, and the bound PBP interferes with CTF1α binding to palindrome 2. We postulate that the presence of high levels of CTF1α may allow it to overcome the interference from PBP and thus bind palindrome 2 of cut1 and transcriptionally activate it and thus cause production of high levels of cutinase. From the amino acid sequence it is clear that the major induced protein is in fact encoded by cut1. CTF1α promoter does contain an element that binds a transcription factor that has been cloned. 3D. Li and P. E. Kolattukudy, unpublished observations. We postulate that cutin monomer-dependent phosphorylation that has been detected previously (1Kolattukudy P.E. Rogers L.M. Li D. Hwang C.H. Flaishman M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4080-4087Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 16Bajar A. Podila G.K. Kolattukudy P.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 8208-8212Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) is involved in the transcriptional activation of ctf1α gene, possibly by direct phosphorylation of the transcription factor that bindsctf1α promoter, although we do not have direct evidence for this hypothesis (indicated by the dotted lines andlowercase letters in Fig. 9). It is also possible that the repressor (PBP) binding may be diminished by cutin monomer-dependent phosphorylation of PBP. However, the identity of the phosphorylated protein remains uncertain. Functions of zinc finger proteins in the regulation of processes relevant to fungal pathogenesis are not well understood. The presence of multiple zinc finger proteins and possible roles in regulating multiple processes complicate the picture. In the present case, two zinc finger proteins with a relatively low degree of overall identity (17%) regulate the expression of two different genes with a high degree of selectivity. CTF1α disruption eliminated phytopathogenicity of F. solani pisi without any detectable change in growth rate in cultures, although the decreased level of cutinase resulting from the CTF1α disruption was not adequate to explain the loss of virulence, as supplementation with cutinase did not restore pathogenicity.3 Thus, CTF1α may participate also in the regulation of other genes essential for pathogenesis. Obviously, CTF1β cannot substitute for CTF1α in this function, further illustrating the differential functions of these zinc finger proteins. In the field, the constitutively expressed low levels of cutinase from fungi would release cutin monomers from cutin found in their immediate environment, and these monomers would in turn induce the synthesis of high levels of the enzyme. Such a mechanism could allow saprophytic growth or growth into the host during infection, as in both cases the fungal conidia with their low level of cutinase contact cutin, presenting basically the same situation as far as induction is concerned. This molecular strategy is probably used widely by microbes to utilize insoluble polymers they find in their environment. The low levels of polymer-degrading enzymes secreted upon depletion of readily utilizable soluble nutrients generates soluble products (monomers or oligomers) that in turn induce high levels of the degrading enzymes that generate soluble nutrients from the insoluble polymer in the medium for growth of the microbe. We present evidence that constitutively expressed and induced cutinase genes use their own unique transcription factors. Whether the mechanism similar to that described here for cutinase is used for the constitutive and induced expression of the other polymer-degrading enzymes in general is not known.

This distortion provides the polymerase access to the nascent base pair to interrogate proper Watson-Crick geometry. Upon binding a correct deoxynucleoside triphosphate, α-helix N of DNA polymerase β is observed to form one face of the binding pocket for the new base pair. Asp-276 and Lys-280 stack with the bases of the incoming nucleotide and template, respectively. To determine the role of Lys-280, site-directed mutants were constructed at this position, and the proteins were expressed and purified, and their catalytic efficiency and fidelity were assessed. The catalytic efficiency for single-nucleotide gap filling with the glycine mutant (K280G) was strongly diminished relative to wild type for templating purines (>15-fold) due to a decreased binding affinity for the incoming nucleotide. In contrast, catalytic efficiency was hardly affected by glycine substitution for templating pyrimidines (<4-fold). The fidelity of the glycine mutant was identical to the wild type enzyme for misinsertion opposite a template thymidine, whereas the fidelity of misinsertion opposite a template guanine was modestly altered. The nature of the Lys-280 side-chain substitution for thymidine triphosphate insertion (templating adenine) indicates that Lys-280 “stabilizes” templating purines through van der Waals interactions.

Its small size (39-kDa) and lack of accessory proteins facilitates its biochemical, kinetic and structural characterization. DNA polymerase β is also the only eukaryotic polymerase for which there is a high-resolution crystal structure. It is structurally and kinetically suited to function on short DNA gaps during DNA repair or replication (1Beard W.A. Wilson S.H. Mutat. Res. 2000; 460: 231-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Although pol β (pol X family) appears to have evolved separately from other families of polymerases of known structure (2Holm L. Sander C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 345-347Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar), it shares many general structural and mechanistic features with these polymerases. The polymerase domain is composed of three functionally distinguishable subdomains. The polymerase catalytic subdomain binds two divalent metal cations that assist the nucleotidyl transferase reaction. Two additional subdomains that have primary roles in duplex DNA binding and nucleoside 5′-triphosphate (dNTP) selection surround the catalytic subdomain. These subdomains will be referred to as C (catalytic), D (duplex DNA binding), and N (dNTP selection) subdomains to discern their intrinsic function. These would correspond to the palm, thumb, and fingers subdomains, respectively, according to the nomenclature that utilizes the architectural analogy to a right-hand (3Ollis D.L. Brick P. Hamlin R. Xuong N.G. Steitz T.A. Nature. 1985; 313: 762-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (739) Google Scholar). 2The subdomain nomenclature as originally proposed for pol β (40Davies J.F. Almassy R.J. Hostomska Z. Ferre R.A. Hostomsky Z. Cell. 1994; 76: 1123-1133Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 41Sawaya M.R. Pelletier H. Kumar A. Wilson S.H. Kraut J. Science. 1994; 264: 1930-1935Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar) utilized the right-hand analogy; however, it is functionally opposite to that employed for other DNA polymerases. To eliminate potential confusion, a functionally based nomenclature is employed as outlined in the text. DNA polymerase β also utilizes a kinetic mechanism similar to other polymerases. Steady-state and pre-steady-state kinetics analyses indicate that DNA polymerases follow an ordered binding of substrates, with DNA binding first (4Beard W.A. Wilson S.H. Chem. Biol. (Lond.). 1998; 5: 7-13Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Comparison of structures of pol β bound to substrate and product DNA (binary complexes), with the structure of pol β bound to substrate DNA and a complementary incoming nucleotide (ternary complex), indicates that numerous structural transitions occur upon binding a correct nucleotide (5Sawaya M.R. Prasad P. Wilson S.H. Kraut J. Pelletier H. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11205-11215Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar). The significance or contribution of these transitions toward fidelity (i.e. substrate specificity) remains to be determined. The polymerase subdomains are structurally distinct among the different polymerase families. Comparison of DNA polymerase structures bound to DNA with those that include an incoming complementary dNTP reveals that the N-subdomain repositions itself to “close” upon the nascent base pair (5Sawaya M.R. Prasad P. Wilson S.H. Kraut J. Pelletier H. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11205-11215Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar, 6Pelletier H. Sawaya M.R. Kumar A. Wilson S.H. Kraut J.

Cell. 2001; 105: 657-667Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar). These structures also reveal that the template strand is radically bent as it exits the polymerase active site. This bend in the template strand serves at least two functions. First, it provides the polymerase N-subdomain access to one face of the nascent base pair and the DNA minor groove. This access gives the polymerase the opportunity to check whether geometrical constraints imposed by correct Watson-Crick hydrogen bonding occur. Secondly, it displaces the next templating base away from the polymerase active site, discouraging incorrect template base reading (deletion mutagenesis) (11Osheroff W.P. Beard W.A. Yin S. Wilson S.H. Kunkel T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28033-28038Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). For pol β, the nascent base pair is sandwiched between α-helix N (residues 275–288) and duplex DNA (Fig. 1 A). Loss of minor groove hydrogen bonding and/or van der Waals interactions with the templating nucleotide of the nascent base pair through alanine substitution for Arg-283 results in dramatically reduced catalytic efficiency (12Beard W.A.

Here we kinetically characterize a series of mutant enzymes with substitutions for Lys-280 to probe whether this side chain plays a critical role in template positioning and/or fidelity. Poly(dA), p(dT)10, p(dT)20, ultrapure deoxynucleoside triphosphates, [γ-32P]ATP, and MicroSpin G-25 columns were from Amersham Biosciences, Inc.. [α-32P]dTTP was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences and DE81 filters were from Whatman. Oligonucleotide site-directed mutagenesis was performed using a procedure described previously (17Sobol R.W. Prasad R. Evenski A. Baker A. Yang X.P. Horton J.K. Wilson S.H. Nature. 2000; 405: 807-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). The full-length wild-type pol β gene was sub-cloned into pBluescript II SK (Stratagene). Amino acid changes were generated by PCR with primers containing the desired mutation. The following mutations were introduced into the Lys-280 codon (AAG, 5′ to 3′): GCC (K280A), GGA (K280G), ATT (K280I), CTG (K280L), ATG (K280M), CAG (K280Q), CGA (K280R). To ensure that the resulting pol β gene contained the desired change, the entire coding sequence of each mutant was confirmed by DNA sequence analysis. Each mutant was cloned into pWL-11 (18Patterson T.A. Little W. Cheng X. Widen S.G. Kumar A. Beard W.A. Wilson S.H. Protein Expression Purif. 2000; 18: 100-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), a bacterial expression plasmid containing the λ PL promoter and overexpressed in Escherichia coli TAP56 cells. Wild-type and mutant proteins were purified as described previously (19Beard W.A. Wilson S.H. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 262: 98-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Enzyme concentrations were determined by Coomassie dye binding using purified pol β as the standard (20Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217547) Google Scholar). The concentration of purified pol β was determined by total amino acid analysis. A 34-mer oligonucleotide DNA substrate containing a single-nucleotide gap was prepared by annealing three gel-purified oligonucleotides (Oligos Etc., Wilsonville, OR) to create a single-nucleotide gap at position 16. Each oligonucleotide was resuspended in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and 1 mmEDTA, and the concentration was determined from their UV absorbance at 260 nm. The annealing reactions were carried out by incubating a solution of 10 μm primer with 12 μm each of downstream and template oligonucleotides at 90–100 °C for 3 min followed by 30 min at 65 °C and then slow cooling to room temperature. The sequence of the gapped DNA substrate was primer, 5′-CTGCAGCTGATGCGC-3′, downstream oligonucleotide, 5′-GTACGGATCCCCGGGTAC-3′, and template, 3′-GACGTCGACTACGCGXCATGCCTAGGGGCCCATG-5′, where theX represents A, C, G, or T. The primer was 5′-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England BioLabs), and unincorporated radioactive ATP was removed with a MicroSpin G-25 column. The downstream primer was synthesized with a 5′-phosphate. Poly(dA) and p(dT)10 or p(dT)20 were annealed at a template to primer nucleotide ratio of 5 (i.e. 5-fold more template than primer nucleotides) or 10. These homopolymeric oligonucleotides were annealed by heating to ∼100 °C for 1 min and slowly cooling to room temperature. This procedure has been shown to eliminate primer stacking on the template (21Mesner L.D. Hockensmith J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2521-2525Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The concentration of annealed template-primers is expressed as the concentration of primer 3′-termini. Steady-state kinetic parameters for polymerization on poly(dA)-oligo(dT) were determined as described previously (12Beard W.A. Osheroff W.P. Prasad R. Sawaya M.R. Jaju M. Wood T.G. Kraut J. Kunkel T.A. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12141-12144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Enzyme activities were determined using a standard reaction mixture (50 μl) containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4 (22 °C), 100 mm KCl, 5 mmMnCl2, and the appropriate substrate concentrations. Additional reaction conditions and details are described in the figure and table legends. Reactions were initiated by addition enzyme and stopped after an appropriate time interval with 20 μl of 0.5m EDTA. Quenched reaction mixtures were spotted onto Whatman DE-81 filter disks and dried. Unincorporated [α-32P]dTTP was removed, and filters were counted as described (22Beard W.A. Wilson S.H. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9745-9753Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Steady-state kinetic parameters for single-nucleotide gap filling were determined by initial velocity measurements where the heteropolymeric DNA concentration was held constant at 200 nm and the dNTP concentration varied. In general, the conditions were similar to those described above for pol(dA)-oligo(dT) except that MgCl2replaced MnCl2. In some instances requiring high dNTPs concentrations (e.g. misincorporation assays), the MgCl2 concentration was increased to 10 mm so that there was at least 5 mm free Mg2+. Enzyme concentrations and reaction time intervals were chosen so that substrate depletion or product inhibition did not influence initial velocity measurements. The quenched samples were mixed with an equal volume of formamide dye, and the products were separated on 12% denaturing polyacrylamide gels. The dried gels were analyzed using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics) to quantify product formation. To directly measure the rate of the first insertion (k pol) and the equilibrium nucleotide dissociation constant (K d), single-turnover kinetic assays (enzyme/DNA = 5) were performed as outlined previously (15Vande Berg B.J. Beard W.A. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3408-3416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) employing a KinTek Model RQF-3 chemical quench-flow apparatus (KinTek Corp., State College, PA). Briefly, a solution of pol β (1 μm) was preincubated with single-nucleotide gapped DNA (200 nm) with a templating adenine in the gap. This solution was rapidly mixed (2-fold dilution) with various concentrations of dTTP/Mg2+. Specific conditions (pH, temperature) and final salt concentrations were as described for the steady-state assay. After various time periods, the reactions were stopped with 0.25 m EDTA, and the quenched samples were mixed with an equal volume of formamide dye. Products were separated and quantified as described above. Under these conditions, the first-order rate constant of the exponential time courses was dependent on the concentration of dTTP. A secondary plot of the concentration dependence of k obs was hyperbolic and fitted to Equation 1, where k pol is the intrinsic rate constant for the step limiting the first insertion.kobs=kpol[dNTP]/(Kd+[dNTP])Equation 1 To probe the functional significance of the template base interactions with Lys-280 (Fig. 1), seven alternate side chains were individually introduced at this position. The alternate side chains differ in their size, hydrophobicity, and hydrogen-bonding potential. The mutant proteins were expressed in E. coli and purified. After purification, SDS-polyacrylamide gel analysis indicated that the mutant pol β polypeptides were greater than 99% homogeneous (data not shown). The catalytic efficiency and fidelity of the purified mutant proteins were determined. To survey the influence of altering the chemical nature of the side chain at residue 280, we analyzed the steady-state kinetics of thymidine triphosphate incorporation on a simple template-primer system, poly(dA)-oligo(dT) (TableI). This template-primer system has proven useful in characterizing other pol β mutant enzymes (12Beard W.A. Osheroff W.P. Prasad R. Sawaya M.R. Jaju M. Wood T.G. Kraut J. Kunkel T.A. Wilson S.H. J.

The catalytic activity (k cat) and Michaelis constant for the template-primer (K m,DNA) of all the mutant enzymes were similar to that of wild-type enzyme. In contrast,K m,dTTP andk cat/K m,dTTP for some of the mutant enzymes were modestly elevated. In general, the effect correlated with the size of the mutant side chain. Whereas glycine, alanine, and glutamine substitutions for Lys-280 resulted in a small reduction in catalytic efficiency relative to wild-type enzyme, the other mutant enzymes (i.e. leucine, isoleucine, methionine, and arginine) had little or no effect.

Because the K280G mutant enzyme exhibited a significant decrease in catalytic efficiency on a homopolymeric template-primer, we extended our kinetic analysis employing a more natural substrate, a heteropolymeric DNA template-primer that has a single-nucleotide gap. This substrate has served as a model substrate for base excision repair assays examining pol β-dependent repair synthesis (26Srivastava D.K. Vande Berg B.J. Prasad R. Molina J.T. Beard W.A.

In particular, the repair of the promutagenic G-U base pair is commonly examined in cell extracts or reconstituted systems (26Srivastava D.K. Vande Berg B.J. Prasad R. Molina J.T. Beard W.A.

In contrast to the small but significant decrease in catalytic efficiency observed on homopolymeric DNA with this mutant, glycine substitution for Lys-280 resulted in a much larger decrease in catalytic efficiency for insertion of dCTP opposite a templating deoxyguanine (Table II and Fig.2). Surprisingly, the magnitude of the loss of catalytic efficiency for correct nucleotide insertion was strongly dependent on the identity of the templating base. Deoxypyrimidine triphosphate insertion was effected to the greatest extent (templating dA and dG), whereas insertion of a deoxypurine triphosphate (templating dC and dT) was hardly affected (less than 4-fold). The altered catalytic efficiency was due entirely to changes inK m, since k cat was not altered by the glycine substitution (Table II). In comparison,k cat and K m for formation of all four Watson-Crick base pairs is not affected by the conservative arginine substitution (K280R; Table II).Table IISteady-state kinetic summary for correct insertion on single-nucleotide gapped DNA substratesEnzymeTemplate-dNTPk catK m,dNTPs−1μmWild typedA-dTTP0.45 (0.03)1.5 (<0.1)dC-dGTP0.40 (0.03)0.3 (0.1)dG-dCTP0.30 (0.03)0.4 (<0.1)dT-dATP0.69 (<0.01)0.9 (0.2)K280RdA-dTTP0.49 (0.01)1.5 (<0.1)dC-dGTP0.39 (0.05)0.3 (<0.1)dG-dCTP0.31 (0.04)0.3 (<0.1)dT-dATP0.57 (0.06)0.5 (0.3)K280GdA-dTTP0.48 (0.06)80 (24)dC-dGTP0.47 (0.02)1.5 (0.1)dG-dCTP0.45 (0.01)10.8 (1.3)dT-dATP0.47 (0.05)1.5 (0.3)Assays were performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The DNA substrates (200 nm) were identical except for the identity of the templating base (dA, dC, dG, or dT) in the single-nucleotide gap.

The results represent the mean (S.E.) of at least two independent determinations. Open table in a new tab Assays were performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The DNA substrates (200 nm) were identical except for the identity of the templating base (dA, dC, dG, or dT) in the single-nucleotide gap. The concentration of the complementary dNTP was varied from at least 0.3 to 3 K m. Initial velocities were fitted to the Michaelis equation by nonlinear least squares methods. The results represent the mean (S.E.) of at least two independent determinations. The elevated K m for correct insertion opposite a templating deoxypurine with the glycine mutant of Lys-280 could be due to a lower binding affinity for the incoming nucleotide (i.e. elevated K d), a diminished rate of nucleotide insertion during the first enzymatic turnover (i.e. decreased k pol), and/or a loss of DNA binding affinity (i.e. increased DNA dissociation rate constant, k off). As we have outlined previously (28Beard W.A. Wilson S.H. Karn J. A Practical Approach: HIV Volume 2. IRL Press, New York1995: 15-36Google Scholar), the K m for the incoming nucleotide in rapid equilibrium with the subsequent step is equivalent toK d[k off/(k pol+k off)]. 3The full expression fork cat is (k pol k off)/(k pol +k off). Thus,k cat/K m should theoretically be equivalent tok pol/K d and is independent of the relative magnitudes of k pol andk off (28Beard W.A. Wilson S.H. Karn J. A Practical Approach: HIV Volume 2. IRL Press, New York1995: 15-36Google Scholar).To dissect the contribution of k pol andK d in the elevatedK m,dTTP observed with the K280G mutant, single-turnover time courses were determined. This approach (polymerase/DNA = 5) eliminates interference from enzyme cycling since under this condition nearly all of the substrate DNA is bound to enzyme so that, upon the addition of dTTP/Mg2+, dNTP binding and insertion limit catalysis. Under these single-turnover conditions, the observed rate constant (k obs) of the exponential time courses was dependent on the concentration of dTTP (Fig. 3). The data fit well to Equation 1, with k pol of 3.2 s−1 andK d of 16.6 μm for wild-type enzyme, yielding a specificity constant (k pol/K d) of 0.19 s−1-μm−1. For the K280G mutant,k pol and K d were determined to be 2.7 s−1 and 289 μm, respectively, so that k pol/K d = 0.009 s−1-μm−1. These specificity constants are similar to those determined from a steady-state analysis (i.e. k cat/K m; see legend to Fig. 2 and Table II). The greatly diminished catalytic efficiency for thymidine insertion observed with the K280G mutant provided us with a wide range of catalytic efficiencies to determine the influence of the chemical nature of the residue 280 side chain. Although the magnitude of the effect is larger, the results are very similar to those observed with the homopolymeric template-primer system (Table I). Fig.4 illustrates the relative (wild-type/mutant) catalytic efficiency for thymidine insertion into a one-nucleotide gap. The data are presented in order of decreasing size of the residue 280 side chain (large to small, left to right). As with the homopolymeric template-primer system, the altered catalytic efficiencies are primarily due to changes in K m,dTTP(data not shown). As noted above, the influence of the glycine substitution had a much more pronounced effect on thymidine insertion employing a template-primer with a one-nucleotide gap (Fig. 4) than a homopolymeric DNA substrate (Table I). Although the rate-limiting step(s) may be different in these two kinetic assays, catalytic efficiency (k cat/K m) is expected to be the same (28Beard W.A. Wilson S.H. Karn J. A Practical Approach: HIV Volume 2. IRL Press, New York1995: 15-36Google Scholar). An important distinction between these two assays is the divalent ion utilized during catalysis. The poly(dA)-oligo(dT) template-primer system strictly requires Mn2+. In contrast, the heteropolymeric template-primer system can utilize either Mn2+ or Mg2+. Because the above assays examining single-nucleotide gap filling utilized Mg2+, the effect of glycine substitution on thymidine insertion into a single-nucleotide gap was repeated with a reaction mixture where MnCl2 replaced MgCl2. Consistent with the assays described above, the identity of the divalent metal cofactor influenced the magnitude of the effect of the glycine substitution. In the presence of 5 mm MnCl2, the wild-type enzyme exhibited a catalytic efficiency of 1.8 ± 0.2 s−1-μm−1 for insertion of dTTP opposite a templating dA in a one-nucleotide gap. In contrast to the nearly 50-fold reduction observed utilizing Mg2+ (Fig. 2), the catalytic efficiency for the K280G mutant was diminished less than 25%, i.e. 1.4 ± 0.2 s−1-μm−1. The base excision repair of a deaminated cytosine (i.e. uracil) involves an intermediate where dG serves as the templating base for pol β single-nucleotide insertion. Because the catalytic efficiency for insertion of deoxypyrimidine triphosphates (i.e. templating purines) is significantly reduced with the glyci"

To investigate the cross-linking process, we have examined the D225E, E375D, and D225E/E375D mutants of bovine lactoperoxidase. The heme in the E375D mutant is only partially covalently bound, but exposure to H2O2results in complete covalent binding and a fully active protein. Digestion of this mutant shows that the heme is primarily bound through its 5-methyl group. Excess H2O2 increases the proportion of the doubly linked species without augmenting enzyme activity. The D225E mutant has little covalently bound heme and a much lower activity, neither of which are significantly increased by the addition of heme and H2O2. The heme is linked to this protein through a single bond to the 1-methyl group. The D225E/E375D mutant has no covalently bound heme and no activity. A small amount of iron 1-hydroxymethylprotoporphyrin IX is obtained from the wild-type enzyme along with the predominant dihydroxylated derivative.

The absence of a third cross-link analogous to that in MPO between the vinyl group and a methionine agrees with the fact that the spectrum of LPO, unlike that of MPO, is not shifted due to conjugation of the sulfonium-substituted vinyl group with the porphyrin (2Fiedler T.J.

Furthermore, we demonstrate that incubation of the recombinant protein with low amounts of H2O2increased both the extent of covalent heme binding and the catalytic activity (6DePillis G.D. Ozaki S.

These results provide strong evidence that the heme-protein bonds are formed through a self-processing mechanism. Subsequent studies with EPO showed that the light and heavy chains were not cross-linked in the majority of the isolated protein (10Oxvig C. Thomsen A.R. Overgaard M.T. Sørensen E.S. Højrup P. Bjerrum M.J. Gleigh G.J. Sottrup-Jensen L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16953-16958Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In EPO the heme is linked to Asp-93 and Glu-241, one of which is in the heavy, and the other, in the light chain of the mature enzyme (10Oxvig C. Thomsen A.R. Overgaard M.T. Sørensen E.S. Højrup P.

Treatment of the protein with H2O2 increased cross-linking of the chains, in accord with the hypothesis that the heme had only formed a link to one of the two non-cross-linked chains rather than the usual link to both. The formation of the interchain cross-link thus provided evidence that in EPO the heme cross-linking reaction was also an autocatalytic process. Finally, although cross-linking of the heme in thyroid peroxidase has not been unambiguously demonstrated, it has been shown that exposure to H2O2 is important for the formation of mature, active protein (12Fayadat L. Niccoli-Sire P. Lanet J. Franc J.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10533-10538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). This provides indirect evidence that autocatalytic formation of the heme-protein cross-links probably also occurs in thyroid peroxidase. In the present paper, we address three questions. (a) How stringent are the conformational requirements for proper formation of the ester cross-links? (b) Is the double covalent link important for catalytic activity? (c) Is formation of the two cross-links a sequential or random process? The results shed light on the processing of LPO that is relevant to formation of the mature forms of all the mammalian peroxidases. Sf9 cells (Invitrogen) were grown in Excell 420™ (JRH Biosciences), and Hi5 cells were grown in Express Five™ (Invitrogen) supplemented with glutamine according to the manufacturer's instructions. Both cell lines were kept in suspension at 28 °C and maintained at densities between 0.5 × 106 and 2 × 106 cells/ml. All reactants were purchased from Sigma unless otherwise noted, and all experiments were performed at room temperature unless otherwise stated. Iron(III) 8-hydroxyprotoporphyrin IX was isolated from phenylhydrazine-treated horseradish peroxidase as reported (13Ator M.A. David S.K. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol.

UV-visible spectra and ABTS-oxidizing activities were recorded on a Hewlett Packard 8452A diode array spectrophotometer, and HPLC analyses were performed on a Hewlett Packard 1090 instrument. The HPLC was equipped with a UV-visible diode array detector, and the reactions were monitored at 215, 280, and 400 nm. Glass reaction vessels were siliconized when needed using Sigmacote™. After allowing the vessels to stand for 2–3 min with the manufacturer's solution, the vessels were rinsed twice with hexane and once with acetone and, finally, air-dried. The bovine LPO gene (2.1 kilobases) including the secretion signal sequence was cloned in theEcoRI cloning site of the baculovirus pACGP67B expression vector (Pharmingen, San Diego, CA) through introduction of this restriction site at positions 120 and 2262 of the bovine LPO gene. The D225E and E375D mutants were obtained by overlap extension PCR, the first by substituting a C for a G at position 797 and the second by substituting a G for a C at position 1247. The double mutant was obtained by two successive overlap extension PCR steps. The resulting constructs were amplified in the DH5α Escherichia colistrain, and the nucleotide sequence was verified by complete sequencing of the insert. Co-transfection was performed using the BaculoGold™ (Pharmingen) transfection kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. Viral stocks were generated and amplified from single virus populations according to established procedures (14O'Reilly D.R. Miller L.K. Luckow V.A. Baculovirus Expression Vectors. W. H.

At the time of infection, a freshly prepared hemin solution was added (final concentration 6 μm) along with penicillin (final concentration 100 units/ml) and streptomycin sulfate (final concentration 100 μg/ml). Cell suspensions were harvested 2.5 days post-infection and centrifuged at 4 °C for 1 h at 10,000 rpm. The supernatant was diluted with an equal volume of double-distilled water, after which protease inhibitors were added at the following final concentrations: phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 200 mg/liter;N-α-p-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone (TLCK), 75 mg/liter; benzamidine, 380 mg/liter; antipain and leupeptin, 5 mg/liter. After stirring for 10 min, batch purification was carried out as follows. Amberlite CG50 cation exchange resin pre-equilibrated in 50 mm Tris.HCl (pH 7.4) was added in three portions over 2 h (∼20 ml of settled resin/liter of supernatant). After decantation, the slurry was transferred to a column, and the settled beads were washed first with ∼5 volumes of 50 mm Tris.HCl and then with ∼3 volumes of 150 mm Tris.HCl. The pH of both buffers was 7.4 and did or did not contain 0.5 mm CaCl2. The CaCl2was only employed in one purification of the D225E mutant, used to show that it eliminates the cytochrome c-like contaminant. The protein was finally eluted with 500 mm Tris.HCl at the same pH. The fractions containing material absorbing at 412 nm were pooled and diluted 10-fold with double-distilled water containing or not, as indicated in the text, 0.5 mm CaCl2. The resulting solution, which was sometimes turbid, was chromatographed over a CL-6B cation exchange column (2–3 ml of resin/liter of culture). At the end of the loading, the column was washed with ∼50 volumes of 50 mm Tris.HCl then ∼50 volumes of 100 mm Tris.HCl, both at pH 7.8, containing or not 0.5 mm CaCl2 as indicated in the text. Elution was achieved with a linear gradient of KCl (0–0.3m, ∼8 column volumes). Fractions were checked for activity and absorbance at both 280 and 412 nm. Even in the case of the double mutant, residual activities were high enough to allow unequivocal identification of the LPO-containing fractions. Selected fractions were then pooled and concentrated to at least 2 mg/ml by ultrafiltration over Amicon™ YM30 membranes. Activities were followed at 414 nm in 50 mm acetate buffer (pH 4.5) in the presence of 250 μm ABTS and 125 μmH2O2, both from freshly prepared stock solutions. Specific activities were calculated using the values ε = 38,000 liters/mol/cm (oxidation product of ABTS) and ε = 113,000 liters/mol/cm at 412 and 280 nm (LPO),M r = 78 kDa for nLPO and 73 kDa for all rLPOs, independently of the number of ester bonds between the apo-enzyme and the cofactor. Activities were expressed in μmol of ABTS/min/nmol of enzyme. In the case of highly active samples (wild type and E375D mutant), the enzymes were diluted to the necessary concentration in 5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin to limit enzyme losses through nonspecific adsorption. UV-visible spectra of whole samples were recorded in 0.1m bis-Tris propane buffer (pH 8.2) at a concentration where absorbances were 1 absorbance units or lower. RZ values were calculated as A 412/A 280 in bis-Tris propane 0.1 m, pH 8, as well as in the assay buffer. The HPLC RZ values were calculated as the ratio of the absorbances at 400 and 280 nm. The appropriate enzyme was diluted to a final concentration of 1 mg/ml in 0.1m bis-Tris propane buffer (pH 8.2), and the required amount of freshly diluted H2O2 solution (10−4) was added in single equivalent portions every 3 min. The reaction media was further incubated for 10 min and was then analyzed. For the experiment described in Fig. 6, the H2O2 treatment was carried out in siliconized reaction glass microvessels. Protein samples, pretreated with H2O2 or not, at a 1 mg/ml concentration in 0.1m bis-Tris propane buffer (pH 8.2) were made 1 mm in CaCl2. A freshly prepared solution of trypsin (20 mg/ml, 1:5, w/w) was then added, and the mixture was incubated for ∼3 h at 37 °C. The CaCl2 concentration was then raised to 3 mm, a freshly prepared 20 mg/ml Pronase solution was added (1/5, w/w), and the incubation was prolonged for a further 20 h. Samples were then made 15% in acetonitrile and 0.5% in trifluoroacetic acid and were injected onto the HPLC. For the experiment described in Fig. 6, the whole digestion procedure was performed in siliconized glass microvessels. Protein and porphyrin separations were achieved on a 214TP5415 reversed phase C4 analytical column (Vydac, Hesperia, CA) using 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in double-distilled water and 0.085% trifluoroacetic acid in acetonitrile (Fisher) as mobile phase components at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. A linear gradient of 0.85%/min starting at t = 3 min and 25% (undigested samples) or 15% (Pronase-digested samples) was used. In the latter case, the compounds eluting from the column were repetitively collected in siliconized glass tubes and concentrated through gentle heating under a stream of N2. These solutions were never allowed to dry out. For separation of the 5- and 8-hydroxyhemes, the same column and mobile phase were used, except that a gradient of 0.2%/min starting at 30% was employed. Under these conditions, 5-hydroxyheme eluted at 10.4 min and 8-hydroxyheme at 10.7 min. Molecular masses were determined by liquid chromatography coupled with electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. Liquid chromatography was performed on an Applied Biosystems HPLC instrument (solvent delivery system 1408, programmable absorption detector 785A) equipped with a 214TP51 reversed phase C4 capillary column (Vydac™, Hesperia, CA) with 1% HCO2H in double-distilled water and 1% HCO2H in acetonitrile (Fisher) as the mobile phase components (flow rate 40 μl/min). A 2%/min linear gradient (20–60%) was used, and detection was performed at 215 nm. In-line mass measurements were undertaken on a Perseptive Biosystems Mariner Biospectrometry Work station in a positive ion polarity mode with the following settings: spray potential, 2600–2700 V; nozzle potential, 125 V; 20 scans/min; flow rate 5 μl/min; acquisition range 300–2000 mass units. Calibration was achieved using a gramicidin standard. Representations of the LPO molecular model are based on the coordinates of De Gioia et al. (8De Gioia L. Ghibaudi E.M. Laurenti E. Salmona M. Ferrari R.P. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 1996; 1: 476-485Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar) and were obtained with RasMol. The enzymes were produced with the baculovirus system previously developed for expression of the wild-type enzyme (6DePillis G.D. Ozaki S. Kuo J.M. Maltby D.A. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol.

The viral particle yield after three amplification stages was essentially independent of the mutation in the protein, and titrating the final suspensions by plaque assay repeatedly gave titers of ∼ 1 × 108 plaque-forming units/ml. However, although the E375D mutant was expressed as efficiently as wild-type rLPO, both the D225E and D225E/E375D mutants were consistently obtained in lower yields (TableI) and were more sensitive to spontaneous degradation during expression and purification. The addition of protease inhibitors during the entire purification procedure helped to improve both the yield and final purity of the proteins. The wild-type and recombinant enzymes could be stored at −20 °C for prolonged periods without serious loss of activity.Table IProperties of the recombinant LPO proteins and commercial nLPOLPO formYieldλRZ1-aRZ values are given at pH 4.5 but are identical at pH 8.2.Specific activityn/nnLPO412 ± 10.881-bThe RZ of commercial samples varies from batch to batch; the best value is given here.18.4 ± 1rLPO3.1 ± 0.5412 ± 10.85 ± 0.039.27 ± 0.35E375D4.0 ± 0.3412 ± 10.55 ± 0.023.28 ± 0.15D225E2.1 ± 0.8415 ± 10.35 ± 0.041-cWhen the purification was undertaken in the presence of CaCl2, a slightly higher RZ value of ∼0.4 was obtained.0.16 ± 0.07D225E/E375D2.4 ± 0.8411 ± 10.09 ± 0.020.07 ± 0.01Each value represents the average of data from at least three different samples.

The spectra and specific activities (in μmol/min/nmol) were determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the purified recombinant enzymes indicated that they all have a molecular mass of ∼73 ± 2 kDa (Fig. 1 A), a value considerably lower than the 78 kDa of nLPO (Fig. 1 A,lane 1). The difference in these values indicates that the recombinant proteins are glycosylated to a much lower extent than the native enzyme. A lower extent of glycosylation has also been reported for LPO expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells (15Watanabe S. Varsalona F. Yoo Y.-C. Guillaume J.-P. Bollen A. Shimazaki K. Moguilevsky N. FEBS Lett. 1998; 441: 476-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) and in a baculovirus-insect cell system (16Shin K. Hayasawa H. Lönnerdal B. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

A small impurity at ∼50 kDa in our recombinant proteins was difficult to remove but did not interfere with the subsequent studies. Further purification to remove the impurity was therefore not carried out on a routine basis. In the case of the D225E and D225E/E375D mutants, a low molecular weight (M r = 14.5 kDa) contaminant reproducibly co-purified with the protein (not seen in Fig. 1 A, indicated by the asterisk in Figs. 2 and3). This low molecular weight contaminant contained a covalently bound heme but did not derive from LPO and was probably a fragment of cytochrome c from the insect cells. When isolated, this fragment showed no detectable peroxidatic activity. The addition of 0.5 mm CaCl2 during the whole purification procedure eliminated this component but also significantly decreased the yield of the proteins.Figure 2HPLC analysis of nLPO and the four rLPO proteins. Traces at 400 nm (dotted line, left scale) and 280 nm (solid line, right scale) of the commercial and the purified recombinant enzymes are presented.

For the D225E mutant, the spectrum in the dotted line is for the species eluting at 30.0 min, and that in thesolid line is for the species eluting at 31.5 min.

The unperturbed absorption maxima indicate that the mutations had little effect on the heme coordination sphere and environment. In contrast, the RZ value, a measure of the iron porphyrin content of the proteins, was very sensitive to mutation of the residues to which the heme is attached. Wild-type rLPO gives an RZ value of 0.85 that is very similar to that of nLPO and, thus, compares favorably with that obtained with other LPO expression systems (14O'Reilly D.R. Miller L.K. Luckow V.A. Baculovirus Expression Vectors. W. H. Freeman and Co., New York1992: 128-130Google Scholar, 15Watanabe S. Varsalona F. Yoo Y.-C. Guillaume J.-P. Bollen A. Shimazaki K. Moguilevsky N. FEBS Lett. 1998; 441: 476-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), but the E375D mutant has an RZ value reduced by 35% and the D225E mutant by 44%. The severely depressed RZ = 0.09 value for the double mutant indicates that this protein has very little heme bound at all, in agreement with the fact that its Soret band is barely above the base line. As expected and as indicated by the sharpness of the Soret bands, the purification procedure, which includes two cation-exchange chromatographic steps and one ultrafiltration, removes nonspecifically bound heme from the proteins. The ABTS oxidation activities qualitatively follow the same pattern as the RZ values. The wild type has a specific activity somewhat lower than nLPO, the E375D mutant ∼65% that of the wild-type, and the D225E an activity some 60-fold lower than that of the wild type. The D225E/E375D mutant has almost no activity, in agreement with its very low heme content. The purified recombinant proteins and nLPO were injected onto a C4 HPLC column under conditions that separate non-covalently bound porphyrins from those covalently attached to the protein (Fig. 2). Under these conditions, free heme derivatives and heme-bound LPO peptides have an absorption maximum that is shifted to ∼400 nm, as reported (9Rae T.D. Goff H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27968-27977Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In the case of nLPO, the trace of the protein at 280 nm and of the porphyrin at 400 nm match very closely with a single peak at 29.5 min (HPLC RZ = 1.3). The heme cofactor in the native enzyme, as expected, is quantitatively bound in a covalent manner to the protein. In the case of wild-type rLPO, the major peak eluting at 29.7 min also absorbs at both wavelengths (HPLC RZ ∼ 0.9). In agreement with our previous observations (6DePillis G.D. Ozaki S. Kuo J.M. Maltby D.A. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8857-8860Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), a free peak attributable to unmodified heme was detected at 20.1 min. These results indicate that in the recombinant wild-type enzyme only a portion of the cofactor is covalently bound to the protein. The ratio of the areas at 400 nm of the peaks at 20.1 and 29.7 min indicates that approximately one-third of the heme is not covalently bound. The E375D mutant, in addition to the free heme peak at 20.1 min, gives a protein-bound heme peak with the slightly shifted retention time of 28.5 min. Approximately 65% of the heme was not covalently bound, and the HPLC RZ for the protein-bound peak was ∼0.5. The elution profile of the D225E mutant is somewhat more complex. Apart from a minor peak at ∼14 min due to the already-mentioned insect cytochrome c-like protein and a small free heme peak, the protein as measured at 280 nm reproducibly eluted as two partially resolved peaks at 30.0 and 31.5 min. The earliest peak, hence, had a retention time similar to those for nLPO and wild-type rLPO but had very little 400-nm absorbance associated with it, whereas the second peak had an HPLC RZ of ∼1.1, similar to that obtained with nLPO, but eluted 1.5 min later. The D225E mutant is thus present as two separable enzyme populations, one fully loaded with the cofactor and the other almost completely devoid of it. HPLC analysis of the double mutant indicates the presence of a weak free-heme peak and a single protein peak at 28.5 min with virtually no covalently attached heme, as expected from the low RZ value for the protein. The retention time of the double mutant protein is close to that of the E375D single mutant. In earlier work we demonstrated that treating wild-type rLPO with H2O2 increases its content of covalently bound heme, a finding that implicated an autocatalytic mechanism for covalent attachment of the prosthetic group (6DePillis G.D. Ozaki S. Kuo J.M. Maltby D.A. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8857-8860Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). We have therefore investigated the behavior of the recombinant proteins toward mild H2O2 treatment. Preliminary experiments showed that treating the wild type and E375D mutants with four eq of H2O2 effectively increased the extent of covalent heme binding (data not shown). The four recombinant enzymes and nLPO were therefore incubated with H2O2under these conditions, and the changes in the extent of covalen"

Approximately 25 genes encoding Ypt3/Rab11-related proteins exist inArabidopsis, but the reason for the presence of many genes in plants remains unclear. Pea Pra2 and Pra3, members of Ypt3/Rab11, are closely related proteins. Because possible orthologs are conserved among dicots, they can be studied to determine their possible localization. Biochemical analysis revealed that these proteins were localized on distinct membranes in pea. Furthermore, using green fluorescent protein-Pra2 and green fluorescent protein-Pra3 fusion proteins, we demonstrated that these proteins are distinctively localized on the trafficking pathway in tobacco Bright Yellow 2 cells. Pra2 was predominantly localized on Golgi stacks and endosomes, which did not support the localization of Pra2 on the endoplasmic reticulum (Kang, J. G., Yun, J., Kim, D. H., Chung, K. S., Fujioka, S., Kim, J. I., Dae, H. W., Yoshida, S., Takatsuto, S., Song, P. S., and Park, C. M. (2001)Cell 105, 625–636). In contrast, Pra3 was likely to be localized on the trans-Golgi network and/or the prevacuolar compartment. We concluded that Pra2 and Pra3 proteins are distinctively localized on the trafficking pathway. This finding suggests that functional diversification takes place in the plant Ypt3/Rab11 family.

Goud B. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 466-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). Rab regulates vesicle transport from the donor to the acceptor compartment by cooperating with interacting proteins. Different Rabs are localized on distinct vesicles and organelles, and the function of each Rab protein depends on its localization (1Chavrier P. Goud B. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 466-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). Genome sequences of several model organisms have shown that the Rab family has significantly expanded from yeast to human. The human genome contains 60 Rabs, whereas those of the fruit fly, nematode worm, and yeast have 26, 29, and 11 Rabs, respectively (2Bock J.B. Matern H.T. Peden A.A. Scheller R.H. Nature. 2001; 409: 839-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar).Arabidopsis, a model of higher plants, is one of the organisms whose entire genome has been sequenced (3The Arabidopsis Genome Initiative Nature. 2000; 408: 796-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (7006) Google Scholar). Interestingly, despite the small size of its genome, Arabidopsis has more than 50 Ypt/Rab GTPases. Ypt/Rab GTPases are subdivided into subgroups, one of which is Ypt3/Rab11. Yeast and human genomes have two (Ypt31 and Ypt32) and three (Rab11A, Rab11B, and Rab25) genes belonging to Ypt3/Rab11, respectively, whereas Arabidopsis has more than 25 related genes (Fig. 1). Usually, proteins of the Rab subgroup with a similar structure have been believed to have similar functions in yeast and human. However, it has been recently shown that proteins belonging to one subgroup do not always have similar functions (1Chavrier P. Goud B. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 466-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). The reason that plants have so many Ypt3/Rab11 proteins is still not known. Probably, each Ypt3/Rab11 protein in higher plants has a different localization and function, but evidence is lacking because there have been only a few reports of Ypt3/Rab11 localization in higher plants (4Ueda T. Anai T. Tsukaya H. Hirata A. Uchimiya H. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1996; 250: 533-539PubMed Google Scholar). Pea Pra2 and Pra3 proteins are members of the Ypt3/Rab11 family (5Nagano Y. Murai N. Matsuno R.

Both have some common features as follows. 1) The expression of these genes is negatively regulated by light mediated by photoreceptor phytochromes (7Yoshida K. Nagano Y. Murai N. Sasaki Y. Proc.

Asaka Y. Sasaki Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6314-6318Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). 3) Their primary structures are closely related, and the proteins are present on the adjacent branches of the phylogenetic tree (Fig. 1 and Ref. 5Nagano Y. Murai N. Matsuno R. Sasaki Y. Plant Cell Physiol. 1993; 34: 447-455PubMed Google Scholar). Sequence similarity searches revealed that the possible orthologs of Pra2 and Pra3 proteins were found in the Arabidopsisgenome (GenPept accession numbers AAF97325 and BAB11663, respectively) (Fig. 1) and in Lotus japonicas (11Borg S. Brandstrup B. Jensen T.J. Poulse C. Plant J. 1997; 11: 237-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) and that Pra2 and Pra3 proteins are probably conserved among dicots. It is interesting to examine whether these similar proteins, Pra2 and Pra3, are localized on distinct subcellular membranes engaging in different functions. The mechanism of light-regulated expression of thePRA2 gene has been extensively studied (9Inaba T. Nagano Y. Sakakibara T. Sasaki Y. Plant Physiol. (Bethesda). 1999; 120: 491-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 10Inaba T. Nagano Y. Reid J.B. Sasaki Y. J. Biol.

Chem. 2001; 276: 22238-22243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), but its precise function remains unclear. A recent report (13Kang J.G. Yun J. Kim D.H. Chung K.S. Fujioka S. Kim J.I. Dae H.W. Yoshida S. Takatsuto S. Song P.S. Park C.M. Cell. 2001; 105: 625-636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) postulated that the Pra2 protein is a mediator for the cross-talk between light and brassinosteroids in the etiolation process. In that report, Kang et al. (13Kang J.G. Yun J. Kim D.H. Chung K.S. Fujioka S. Kim J.I. Dae H.W. Yoshida S. Takatsuto S. Song P.S. Park C.M. Cell. 2001; 105: 625-636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) claims that Pra2 is localized on the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)1 and regulates the activity of the DDWF1 protein, which belongs to the P450 family and catalyzes the hydroxylation step of brassinosteroids by direct interaction on the ER. Transgenic analysis led them to conclude that Pra2 and its orthologs are regulators of brassinosteroid biosynthesis. However, Pra2 is a Rab GTPase, and experiments using yeast cells suggest that Pra2 has a function as a Rab GTPase and is likely to be involved in vesicle transport (6Matsuda N. Ueda T. Sasaki Y. Nakano A. Cell Struct. Funct. 2000; 25: 11-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). It is important to answer the question of whether the Pra2 protein is localized on the ER and regulates DDWF1 activity without participating in vesicle transport. In this report, we investigated the subcellular localization of the Pra2 and Pra3 proteins. Using biochemical and cytological methods, we have shown that the Pra2 protein is predominantly localized on Golgi and endosomes, whereas the Pra3 protein is likely to be localized on the trans-Golgi network and/or prevacuolar compartment. Our study yielded no evidence that Pra2 was localized on the ER. Our results indicate that Pra2 and Pra3 were distinctively localized on the trafficking pathway. Furthermore, they suggest that functional diversification takes place in the plant Ypt3/Rab11 family. Ypt3/Rab11 proteins ofArabidopsis were collected using either the TBLASTN program against the complete genome sequence of Arabidopsis or the SMART web tool (14Schultz J. Copley R.R. Doerks T. Ponting C.P. Bork P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 231-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (1018) Google Scholar). Arabidopsis proteins are distinguished by their GenPept accession numbers. If one protein has more than one accession number, only a representative one is shown. Related proteins from yeast, human, and other plant species are also included. First, multiple alignments were created using the program ClustalX version 1.8 (15Thompson J.D. Gibson T.J. Plewniak F. Jeannmougin F. Higgins D.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4876-4882Crossref PubMed Scopus (35075) Google Scholar) and refined by visual observation. Non-aligned regions were excluded from the alignments. Second, a tree was calculated by the neighbor-joining method using refined sequences. ScYpt1 was defined as an out-group in the tree. In the experiment described in Fig. 2, the growing zone of etiolated pea epicotyl (1-cm section from the top of the hook, 30 g) was collected and homogenized in a homogenization buffer consisting of 50 mm glycylglycine-NaOH, pH 7.5, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 0.25 m sucrose, 1.5% Polyclar AT, and a protease inhibitor mixture (CompleteTM, Roche Molecular Biochemicals). After cutting into pieces in a buffer, the sample was homogenized with a homogenizer (Hitachi). The homogenate was filtered through two layers of Miracloth and then centrifuged at 6,000 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was overlaid on a cushion buffer containing 50 mm glycylglycine-NaOH, pH 7.5, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm EDTA, and 50% (w/v) sucrose. The sample was then centrifuged at 100,000 ×g for 30 min. The interface layer (microsomes) between the upper and lower layers was collected, and the sucrose concentration of the sample was adjusted to 18% (w/w). This microsomal fraction was finally applied to the linear sucrose density gradient (14 ml) of 42–19% (w/w). The gradient was buffered in 50 mmglycylglycine-NaOH, pH 7.5, 1 mm DTT, and 1 mmEDTA. The sample was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 2 h and then separated into 0.3-ml fractions. Aliquots (180 μl) of fractions were mixed with a 4× SDS-PAGE loading buffer (60 μl), boiled for 3 min, and then stored at −20 °C. For the enzyme assay, the rest of the samples were stored at −80 °C until use. The experiments described in Fig. 3 were carried out as described above with the exception of some modifications to a buffer. Pea epicotyls were homogenated in a buffer containing 50 mm glycylglycine-NaOH, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 0.25m sucrose, 1.5% Polyclar AT, and a protease inhibitor mixture, CompleteTM. The 6,000 ×g supernatant was overlaid on a cushion buffer containing 50 mm glycylglycine-NaOH, pH 7.5, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm MgCl2, and 50% (w/v) sucrose. After 100,000 × g centrifugation, the interface layer was collected, and the sucrose density was adjusted to 10% (w/w). This microsomal fraction was finally applied to the linear sucrose density gradients (14 ml) of 38–15% (w/w). The gradient was buffered in 50 mm glycylglycine-NaOH, pH 7.5, and 1 mm DTT containing either 1 mm EDTA (Fig.3 A) or 1 mm MgCl2 (Fig.3 B). After centrifugation, samples were collected as described above. Green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion genes were constructed as follows. The desired cDNA was amplified by Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene) subcloned into the EcoRV site of a pZErO-2.1 vector (Invitrogen) and digested with restriction enzymes. Digested fragments were subcloned into theBglII-EcoRI sites of a pMAT-137 vector (a gift from Dr. K. Matsuoka) containing the GFP gene. The fusion gene was driven by the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter-nopaline synthase terminator system. As a result, the desired gene was fused to the C terminus of GFP. The resulting plasmid was transformed into tobacco Bright Yellow 2 (BY-2) cells using Agrobacterium tumefaciens (16Matsuoka K. Nakamura K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 834-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Red fluorescent protein (RFP) fusion genes were also constructed using a similar method. The desired fragment was subcloned into a pUC vector carrying the RFP gene (DsRed, CLONTECH). The fusion gene was driven by the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter-nopaline synthase terminator system. The particle bombardment device was the same as that described previously (9Inaba T. Nagano Y. Sakakibara T. Sasaki Y. Plant Physiol. (Bethesda). 1999; 120: 491-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). After bombardment, cells were incubated for 18 h and observed by a confocal laser-scanning microscope. Unless otherwise stated, living cells were directly observed using an MRC-1024 confocal laser-scanning microscope as described previously (17Kitaura Y. Matsumoto S. Satoh H. Hitomi K. Maki M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14053-14058Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Staining by FM4–64 was carried out as follows (18Yahara N. Ueda T. Sato K. Nakano A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 221-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 19Ueda T. Yamaguchi M. Uchimiya H. Nakano A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4730-4741Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). The cells were digested for 2 h with an enzyme solution that contained 1% cellulase Y-C and 0.1% pectolyase Y-23. After washing in a fresh medium containing 0.4 m mannitol, FM4–64 was added to a final concentration of 50 μm, and cells were incubated for 10 min. The cells were then harvested and resuspended in a fresh medium. After incubation for the indicated time, cells were observed using a confocal laser-scanning microscope. Enzyme activities, such as inosine diphosphatase and NADPH-cytochromec reductase, were assayed by the methods described previously (20Matsuoka K. Watanabe N. Nakamura K. Plant J. 1995; 8: 877-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 21Fujita M. Asahi T. Plant Cell Physiol. 1985; 26: 389-395Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar). For immunoblotting, samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE, blotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane, and then probed with specific antibodies. The antibodies used in this study have been used and cited in the following studies: Pra2 and Pra3 (8Nagano Y. Okada Y. Narita H. Asaka Y. Sasaki Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6314-6318Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), vacuolar-type ATPase (22Matsuura-Endo C. Maeshima M. Yoshida S. Plant Physiol. (Bethesda). 1992; 100: 718-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), and plasma membrane-type ATPase (23Nagao T. Sasakawa H. Sugiyama T. Plant Cell Physiol. 1987; 28: 1181-1186Google Scholar). Pra2 and Pra3 proteins were detected by an LAS-1000 plus luminoimage analyzer (Fuji, Japan) using a SuperSignal WestFemto detection kit (Pierce), whereas plasma membrane-type ATPase and vacuolar-type ATPase were detected using an immunostaining HRP-1000 kit (Konica, Japan). Because the function of Ypt/Rab GTPase depends on its localization, it is necessary to confirm the localization of Pra2 and Pra3 proteins on subcellular membranes. First, we performed biochemical analysis using the growing zone of the etiolated pea epicotyl where both Pra2 and Pra3 were the richest. A crude microsomal fraction was fractionated on a sucrose density gradient buffered in glycylglycine-NaOH (Fig. 2). The distributions of markers in Fig. 2were similar to those in the previous report (24Ali M.S. Nishimura M. Mitsui T. Akazawa T. Kojima K. Plant Cell Physiol. 1985; 26: 1119-1133Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Pra2 was strongly observed in fractions 39–45, whereas Pra3 was enriched in fractions 33–39 (Fig. 2), indicating that these proteins are localized on distinct subcellular membranes in pea. Because both the ER and Golgi were distributed over the light density area under this condition, we could not predict the precise localization of Pra2 and Pra3. It is important to identify the localization of Pra2, because a recent report claims that Pra2 is localized on the ER in onion epidermal cells (13Kang J.G. Yun J. Kim D.H. Chung K.S. Fujioka S. Kim J.I. Dae H.W. Yoshida S. Takatsuto S. Song P.S. Park C.M. Cell. 2001; 105: 625-636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). To demonstrate protein localization on the ER, “Mg2+-shift” experiments are usually performed. The distribution of the ER is disrupted and shifted to a heavier density area in the presence of Mg2+ but not in its absence. We examined the effects of 3 mm MgCl2 on pea epicotyl membranes (25Ahmed S.U. Bar-Peled M. Raikhel N.V. Plant Physiol. (Bethesda). 1997; 114: 325-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) and found that this method was not suitable for the analysis of pea epicotyl membranes, because the distribution of various membranes as well as that of the ER was altered. We employed a method developed by Lord et al. (26Lord J.M. Kagawa T. Moore S.T. Beevers H. J. Cell Biol. 1973; 57: 659-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar) with some modifications. A microsomal fraction homogenized in a buffer containing both 1 mm EDTA and 1 mm MgCl2 was analyzed by sucrose density gradient centrifugation in the presence of either 1 mm EDTA or 1 mm MgCl2. Under the presence of EDTA, four kinds of membranes, ER, Golgi, vacuolar, and plasma membranes, were differently distributed (Fig.3 A). Western blot analysis of Pra2 and Pra3 showed that their patterns were different from those of the membrane markers (Fig.3 A). In the presence of 1 mm MgCl2, the ER marker distributed over various fractions without remarkable disruption of Golgi (Fig. 3 B). Under such a condition, the patterns of Pra2 and Pra3 were similar to those shown in Fig.3 A, suggesting that the membranes on which Pra2 and Pra3 were localized are not the ER, which contradicts the result of the study on onion epidermal cells. However, this information was insufficient to conclude the localization of Pra2 and Pra3. To further examine the localization of Pra2 and Pra3 proteins, we next tried to conduct cytological analysis using tobacco BY-2 cells. We made stable transformants of tobacco BY-2 cells expressing GFP-Pra2 or GFP-Pra3 proteins and observed the fluorescence of GFP using a confocal laser-scanning microscope. Both GFP-Pra2 and GFP-Pra3 were localized around the perinuclear cytosol with bright-dot staining (Fig.4, A and B). The dot structure was a representative pattern of Golgi that has been observed in previous reports (27Nebenführ A. Gallagher L.A. Dunahay T.G. Frohlick J.A. Mazurkiewicz A.M. Meehl J.B. Staehelin L.A. Plant Physiol. (Bethesda). 1999; 121: 1127-1141Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar, 28Takeuchi M. Ueda T. Sato K. Abe H. Nagata T. Nakano A. Plant J. 2000; 23: 517-525Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To confirm whether the dot structure is actually Golgi, we examined the effect of brefeldin A (BFA). BFA treatment (10 μg/ml) caused the redistribution of GFP-Pra2 to the ER (Fig. 4 C, arrowheads). The results indicate that a part of GFP-Pra2 is localized on Golgi sensitive to BFA. BFA treatment could not cause the redistribution of GFP-Pra3 to the ER (Fig. 4 D), again confirming that Pra2 and Pra3 are localized on distinct intracellular membranes. Because BFA treatment cannot cause the redistribution of the protein localized in thetrans-Golgi network (TGN) to the ER (29Chege N.W. Pfeffer S.R. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 893-899Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), Pra3 might be localized on the TGN. To confirm the probable localization of Pra3 on the TGN, we introduced a plasmid carrying the AtVTI11-RFP fusion gene into BY-2 cells expressing GFP-Pra3 by particle bombardment. AtVTI11 is believed to be localized on the TGN and the prevacuolar compartment in plant cells (30Zheng H. von Mollard G.F. Kovaleva V. Stevens V. Raikhel N.V. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 2251-2264Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). In Arabidopsis cells, fluorescent AtVTI11 has been used as a marker of the pathway from the TGN to the prevacuolar compartment (31Kim D.H. Eu Y.J. Yoo C.M. Kim Y.W. Pih K.T. Jin J.B. Kim S.J. Stenmark H. Hwang I. Plant Cell. 2001; 13: 287-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Thus, we constructed an AtVTI11-RFP fusion gene and introduced it into tobacco cells expressing GFP-Pra3. As shown in Fig. 5, most of the red signals derived from AtVTI11-RFP overlapped with the green signals of GFP-Pra3 and turned yellow (Fig. 5, merged). The results of our BFA experiments and those shown in this figure suggest that Pra3 is likely to be localized on the TGN and/or the prevacuolar compartment. Although Pra2 and Pra3 are localized around Golgi, the appearance of an unspecified structure after BFA treatment (Fig. 4 C,arrows) suggested that Pra2 was localized on other intracellular membranes. Thus, we also examined the possible localization of Pra2 and Pra3 on the endocytic pathway using FM4–64, which develops a red color. FM4–64 has been used as an endocytic tracer that travels from the plasma membrane to the vacuolar membrane via the endosomes in yeast (18Yahara N. Ueda T. Sato K. Nakano A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 221-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), Arabidopsis (19Ueda T. Yamaguchi M. Uchimiya H. Nakano A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4730-4741Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar), and tobacco BY-2 cells (31Kim D.H. Eu Y.J. Yoo C.M. Kim Y.W. Pih K.T. Jin J.B. Kim S.J. Stenmark H. Hwang I. Plant Cell. 2001; 13: 287-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). After a 60-min chase-period, the red signals derived from the endosomes overlapped with the green signals of GFP-Pra2 and turned yellow (Fig.6 A, arrowheads), indicating that a part of Pra2 is localized on the endosomes as well as on Golgi. After 3 h, FM4–64 arrived at the vacuolar membranes and showed that this drug could be used as a tracer for endocytosis in BY-2 cells (Fig. 6, C and D). In the case of the GFP-Pra3 transformant (Fig. 6 B), only a small number of yellow signals was observed, suggesting that Pra3 is not predominantly localized on the endosomes. To finally confirm the distinct localization between Pra2 and Pra3, we introduced an RFP-PRA3 fusion gene into cells expressing the GFP-Pra2 protein by particle bombardment. As shown in Fig.7, GFP-Pra2 was apparently distinguishable from RFP-Pra3, again indicating the distinct localization of Pra2 and Pra3 in a cell. Although the artificial localization of fluorescent proteins cannot be completely excluded, reconfirmation of distinct Pra2 and Pra3 localization in BY-2 cells as well as in pea led us to conclude that fluorescent-tagged proteins are likely to be targeted to membranes precisely in BY-2 cells. Our results from biochemical analysis and those shown in this figure clearly indicate that closely related Pra2 and Pra3 proteins are distinctively localized on the trafficking pathway in both pea and a model system, that of the tobacco BY-2 cell. Pra2 is predominantly localized on Golgi and endosomes, whereas Pra3 is likely to be localized on the TGN and/or the prevacuolar compartment. Our results were not consistent with those of a previous report (13Kang J.G. Yun J. Kim D.H. Chung K.S. Fujioka S. Kim J.I. Dae H.W. Yoshida S. Takatsuto S. Song P.S. Park C.M. Cell. 2001; 105: 625-636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), according to which the Pra2 was localized on the ER. In this study, we examined the subcellular localization of two closely related plant Ypt3/Rab11 GTPases, Pra2 and Pra3. A biochemical analysis demonstrated that these proteins are localized on distinct membranes in pea (Fig. 2). Using GFP fusion proteins, Pra2 was shown to be predominantly localized on Golgi and endosomes, whereas Pra3 was likely to be localized on the trans-Golgi network and/or prevacuolar compartment (Figs. Figure 4, Figure 5, Figure 6). Although the Golgi localization of GFP-Pra2 seems to be inconsistent with the results of biochemical analysis, it is well known that the distribution of inosine diphosphatase, a general marker of Golgi, does not fit that of the Golgi protein such as glucuronyltransferase, which is localized on a specific compartment (32Hobbs M.C. Delarge M.H. Baydoun E.A. Brett C.T. Biochem. J. 1991; 277: 653-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The distinct localization of GFP-Pra2 and RFP-Pra3 (Fig. 7) supports the idea that both proteins are likely to be targeted to membranes precisely in BY-2 cells as observed in pea (Fig. 2), although the possibility of artificial GFP-Pra2 localization on Golgi cannot be completely excluded. We hypothesize that Pra2 is likely to be localized on the specific subcompartment of Golgi and that Pra2 and the Golgi marker were thus observed differently on a sucrose gradient. This study clearly shows for the first time that functional diversification of Ypt3/Rab11 takes place in plants. In yeast, it has been believed that two isoforms (Ypt31 and Ypt32) have almost identical functions (33Benli M. Döring F. Robinson D.G. Yang X. Gallwitz D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6460-6475Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 34Jedd G. Mulholland J. Segev N. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 563-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). In mammal, Rab11 and Rab25 are expressed in different cells, but their functions were shown to be similar using polarized cells (35Wang X. Kumar R. Navarre J. Casanova J.E. Goldenring J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29138-29146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). However, our results clearly showed that closely related Pra2 and Pra3 are distinctively localized on the trafficking pathway in the same cell, indicating that they have distinct functions. Such functional diversification of plant Ypt3/Rab11 is probably caused by the specific function of the plant Golgi apparatus. In plant cells, matrix polysaccharides such as hemicelluloses are synthesized in Golgi and transported to the cell wall via Golgi-derived vesicles (36Taiz L. Zeiger E. Plant Physiology.2nd Ed. Sinauer Associates, Inc., Sunderland, MA1998: 419Google Scholar); plant cells have to prepare the machinery for delivery of cell wall components and biosynthetic enzymes from Golgi to the plasma membrane. Judging from the fact that Ypt3/Rab11 diversification takes place only in plants, one reason for Ypt3/Rab11 diversification in higher plants might be the necessity of cell wall biogenesis, which is unique to plants. Recent reports also led us to hypothesize other possibilities (37Geldner N. Friml J. Stierhof Y.D. Jurgens G. Palme K. Nature. 2001; 413: 425-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (954) Google Scholar). For example, the inhibition of vesicle trafficking affects the polarized distribution of the efflux carrier of auxin, a plant hormone (37Geldner N. Friml J. Stierhof Y.D. Jurgens G. Palme K. Nature. 2001; 413: 425-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (954) Google Scholar). The implication of vesicle trafficking in such plant hormone transport suggests that Ypt3/Rab11 might be more involved in diverse phenomena in plants than we expected. Our results also support the proposition of the functional difference of the Ypt3/Rab11 family among different organisms. Ypt31/32 in yeast seemed to be localized on the intra-Golgi (33Benli M. Döring F. Robinson D.G. Yang X. Gallwitz D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6460-6475Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), whereas Rab11 in human was localized on the endosomes (38De Sönnichsen B. Renzis S. Nielsen E. Rietdorf J. Zerial M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 901-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (792) Google Scholar, 39Wilcke M. Johannes L. Galli T. Mayau V. Goud B. Salamero J. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 1207-1220Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar), providing grounds for proposing a functional difference between Ypt3 and Rab11 (1Chavrier P. Goud B. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 466-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). However, this is still controversial because no t-SNAREs, a partner of Ypt/Rab, were localized on intra-Golgi stacks in yeast (40Pelham H.R. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 45-49Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Our finding of Pra2 localization on both endosomes and Golgi suggests that Pra2 protein has a distinct function from both yeast Ypt3 and human Rab11. The result that Pra2 could not complement either temperature- or cold-sensitiveypt31 mutants (6Matsuda N. Ueda T. Sasaki Y. Nakano A. Cell Struct. Funct. 2000; 25: 11-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) is consistent with this idea. In addition to Ypt3/Rab11, unique diversification within the Rab5 family also takes place. Arabidopsis has Ara6 GTPase, which resembles Rab5 best but has a unique structure (19Ueda T. Yamaguchi M. Uchimiya H. Nakano A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4730-4741Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). Ueda et al. (19Ueda T. Yamaguchi M. Uchimiya H. Nakano A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4730-4741Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar) demonstrated that Ara6 and Ara7, a putative authentic ortholog of human Rab5, are differently regulated by the distribution, expression, and localization levels (19Ueda T. Yamaguchi M. Uchimiya H. Nakano A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4730-4741Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). Their findings and our results encourage us to investigate the functional difference of Ypt/Rab GTPase between plants and other organisms. A recent report (13Kang J.G. Yun J. Kim D.H. Chung K.S. Fujioka S. Kim J.I. Dae H.W. Yoshida S. Takatsuto S. Song P.S. Park C.M. Cell. 2001; 105: 625-636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) showed that Pra2 is localized on the ER and regulates an essential step of brassinosteroid biosynthesis by interacting with DDWF1, which belongs to the P450 family and catalyzes the hydroxylation step of brassinosteroid biosynthesis. Although our finding did not support the existence of Pra2 on the ER (Fig. 3), there is a possibility that Pra2 is a multifunctional protein. A minor fraction of Pra2 might be localized on the ER or be recruited to the ER by additional factors where Pra2 can interact with DDWF1. However, phylogenetic analysis of DDWF1 relatives showed that a gene orthologous to pea DDWF1 is not present in the current data base of theArabidopsis genome (data not shown). In addition, possible DDWF1 orthologs in tobacco were induced by the inoculation of a phytopathogen (41Czernic P. Huang H.C. Marco Y. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 31: 255-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) or the treatment of a fungal elicitor (42Ralston L. Kwon S.T. Schoenbeck M. Ralston J. Schenk D.J. Coates R. Chappell J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2001; 393: 222-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), suggesting that these genes might be involved in the resistance to phytopathogens. The report claimed that suppression ofNtRab11D, a proposed ortholog of Pra2 in tobacco, is responsible for reduced brassinosteroid biosynthesis (3The Arabidopsis Genome Initiative Nature. 2000; 408: 796-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (7006) Google Scholar). However, our phylogenetic analysis showed that NtRab11D is a Pra3 ortholog (Fig. 1). In view of these facts, further studies would be required to demonstrate that Pra2 is a multifunctional protein that regulates brassinosteroid biosynthesis by interacting with DDWF1. In summary, we demonstrated that closely related Pra2 and Pra3 proteins are distinctively localized on the trafficking pathway. Our results suggest that functional diversification takes place in the plant Ypt3/Rab11 family. We thank Drs. Ken Matsuoka and Takashi Ueda for advice throughout our work. We also thank Drs. K.

Klein P.S. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2001; 41: 789-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). Lithium exerts its cellular effects by targeting a variety of enzymes that require metal ions for catalysis or enzymes that transport metal ions between cellular compartments (1Phiel C.J. Klein P.S. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2001; 41: 789-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). Alteration of the activity of these enzymes by lithium results in changes in gene expression and/or secretory activity by cells, both in a cell type-specific manner. The modulatory effects of lithium on gene expression often involve actions on the activation of transcription factor systems as well as upstream regulatory factors such as protein kinases and phosphatases (1Phiel C.J. Klein P.S. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2001; 41: 789-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). There is an accumulating body of evidence demonstrating that lithium increases activation of the transcription factor activator protein-1 (2Yuan P. Chen G. Manji H.K. J. Neurochem. 1999; 73: 2299-2309Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 3Bullock B.P. McNeil G.P. Dobner P.R. Brain Res. Mol.

Neurochem. 1998; 70: 1768-1771Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), an effect that is preceded by accumulation of the phosphorylated, active form of c-Jun N-terminal kinase. Furthermore, recent studies have demonstrated that lithium can also interfere with the activation of NF-κB. For example, treatment of mouse embryonic fibroblasts with lithium decreases tumor necrosis factor-α-induced NF-κB transactivation (6Hoeflich K.P. Luo J. Rubie E.A. Tsao M.S. Jin O. Woodgett J.R. Nature. 2000; 406: 86-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (1200) Google Scholar). On the other hand, consistent with the notion that the effects of lithium are cell type-specific, lithium increases NF-κB activity in the rat pheochromocytoma cell line PC12 (7Bournat J.C. Brown A.M.

This increase in NF-κB activity in PC12 cells observed with lithium administration is associated with a decreased apoptosis in these cells, suggesting that lithium-induced activation of the antiapoptotic molecule NF-κB contributes to the protective effect of lithium against apoptosis. While NF-κB is important in regulating apoptotic events, this transcription factor is also a central mediator of inflammatory processes in a wide variety of cell types (8Baeuerle P.A. Baichwal V.R. Adv. Immunol. 1997; 65: 111-137Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Stimulation of the NF-κB transcription factor system is instrumental in the transcriptional activation of a variety of inflammatory genes including cytokines, chemokines, and the inducible nitric-oxide synthase (8Baeuerle P.A. Baichwal V.R. Adv. Immunol. 1997; 65: 111-137Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although lithium has been shown to potentiate the expression of cytokine and chemokine genes (9Beyaert R. Schulze-Osthoff K. Van Roy F. Fiers W. Cytokine. 1991; 3: 284-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 10Beyaert R. De Heyninck K. Valck D. Boeykens F. van Roy F. Fiers W. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 291-300PubMed Google Scholar, 11Maes M. Song C. Lin A.H. Pioli R. Kenis G. Kubera M. Bosmans E. Psychopharmacology. 1999; 143: 401-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) as well as inducible nitric-oxide synthase (12Feinstein D.L. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 883-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), it is unknown whether these proinflammatory effects are related to NF-κB activation. In the current paper, we investigated the effect of lithium on NF-κB activation and the inflammatory response in human intestinal epithelial cells (IECs).1These cells have recently been demonstrated to exhibit a substantial inflammatory response to various extracellular stimuli including cytokines and bacterial products, in which NF-κB activation plays a central role (13Jobin C. Sartor R.B. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: C451-C462Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our results demonstrate that similar to these classical inflammatory stimuli, lithium induces a strong inflammatory response in IECs as indicated by the activation of NF-κB and production of the chemokine IL-8. Furthermore, we provide evidence that upstream from or parallel to NF-κB, p38 and p42/44 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases as well as the membrane protein Na+/H+ exchangers (NHEs) play an important role in mediating the proinflammatory effects of lithium. The human colon cancer cell lines HT-29 and Caco-2 were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). HT-29 cells were grown in modified McCoy's 5A medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen). Caco-2 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with high glucose containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Amiloride HCl was obtained from Research Biochemicals Inc. (Natick, MA). LiCl, choline chloride, mannitol, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT), 5-(N-ethyl-N-isopropyl)-amiloride (EIPA), 5-(N-methyl-N-isobutyl)-amiloride (MIA), cimetidine, harmaline, and clonidine were purchased from Sigma. Human IL-1β was obtained from R&D Systems. The p38 inhibitor SB 203580 and p42/44 inhibitor PD 98059 were purchased from Calbiochem. SB 203580, PD 98059, amiloride, cimetidine, harmaline, and clonidine were dissolved in 0.5% Me2SO. After discarding the growth medium, confluent layers of HT-29 or Caco-2 cells in 96-well plates were treated with Selectamine medium (Invitrogen) containing 140 mm NaCl or with the same medium with all or part of the NaCl replaced isosmotically with LiCl, choline chloride, or mannitol. The cells were incubated with Selectamine medium for 18 h. To test the effect of NHE or MAP kinase inhibitors, these inhibitors or their vehicle were added to the cells immediately following treatment with Selectamine medium, followed by an incubation period of 4–18 h. Because harmaline was toxic to the cells when the incubation lasted for 18 h, the effect of this agent on LiCl-induced IL-8 production was tested 4 h after stimulation. Furthermore, the effect of both MIA and EIPA was tested 4 h after stimulation with LiCl. Human IL-8 levels were determined from the cell supernatants using commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits (BD Pharmingen, San Diego, CA) and according to the manufacturer's instructions. After discarding growth medium, HT-29 cells were treated with Selectamine medium containing NaCl (140 mm) or a combination of NaCl (60 mm) and LiCl (80 mm) for 4 h. At the end of the incubation, total RNA was isolated from cells using TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen). Reverse transcription of the RNA was performed using murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. 5 μg of RNA was transcribed in a 20-μl reaction containing 10.7 μl of RNA, 2 μl of 10× PCR buffer, 2 μl of 10 mm dNTP mix, 2 μl of 25 mm MgCl2, 2 μl of 100 mmdithiothreitol, 1 μl of 50 μm oligo(dT)16, and 0.3 μl of murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (50 units/μl). The reaction mix was incubated at 42 °C for 15 min for reverse transcription. Thereafter, the reverse transcriptase was inactivated at 99 °C for 5 min. RT-generated DNA (1–5 μl) was amplified using the Expand High Fidelity PCR System (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The PCR mix (25 μl) contained 2–3 μl of cDNA, water, 2.5 μl of PCR buffer, 1.5 μl of 25 mmMgCl2, 1 μl of 10 mm dNTP mix, 0.5 μl of 10 mm oligonucleotide primer (each), and 0.2 μl of enzyme. cDNA was amplified using the following primers and conditions: IL-8 (14Nilsen E.M. Johansen F.-E. Jahnsen F.L. Lundin K.E.A. Scholz T. Brandtzaeg P. Haraldsen G. Gut. 1998; 42: 635-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), 5′-ATGACTTCCAAGCTGGCCGTGGCT-3′ (sense) and 5′-TCTCAGCCCTCTTCAAAAACTTCTC-3′ (antisense); GAPDH, 5′-CGGAGTCAACGGATTTGGTCGTAT-3′ (sense) and 5′-AGCCTTCTCCATGGTGGTGAAGAC-3′ (antisense); an initial denaturation at 94 °C for 5 min, 27 and 23 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s for IL-8 and GAPDH, respectively; 58 °C for 45 s and 72 °C for 45 s; and a final dwell at 72 °C for 7 min. The expected PCR products were 289 bp (for IL-8) and 306 bp (for GAPDH). PCR products were resolved on a 1.5% agarose gel and stained with ethidium bromide. After discarding growth medium, HT-29 cells in six-well plates were treated with Selectamine medium containing NaCl (140 mm) or a combination of NaCl (60 mm) and LiCl (80 mm) for varying lengths of time, and nuclear protein extracts were prepared as described previously (15Haskó G. Szabó C. Németh Z.H. Kvetan V. Pastores S.M. Vizi E.S. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 4634-4640PubMed Google Scholar). To determine the effect of NHE blockade, cells were treated with amiloride (300 μm; Sigma) or its vehicle (0.5% Me2SO) concomitantly with the addition of Selectamine medium. All nuclear extraction procedures were performed on ice with ice-cold reagents. Cells were washed twice with PBS and harvested by scraping into 1 ml of PBS and pelleted at 2,000 × g for 15 min. The pellet was resuspended in three packed cell volumes of cytosolic lysis buffer (20% (v/v) glycerol, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 0.2% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol, and 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and incubated for 15 min on ice with occasional vortexing and then homogenized using a pellet pestle. After centrifugation at 3,000 × g for 15 min, supernatants (cytosolic extracts) were saved for Western blotting studies, while the pellet was further processed to obtain nuclear extracts. Two cell pellet volumes of nuclear extraction buffer (20% (v/v) glycerol, 20 mmHEPES, pH 7.9, 420 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 50 mm glycerol phosphate, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) was added to the nuclear pellet and incubated on ice for 20 min with occasional vortexing. Nuclear proteins were isolated by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 30 min. Protein concentrations were determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay. Nuclear extracts were aliquoted and stored at −70 °C until used for EMSA. The NF-κB consensus oligonucleotide probe used for the EMSA was purchased from Promega. Oligonucleotide probes were labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase (Invitrogen) and purified in MicroSpin G-50 columns (Amersham Biosciences). For the EMSA analysis, 12 μg of nuclear proteins were preincubated with EMSA binding buffer (10% glycerol (v/v), 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm dithiothreitol) as well as 120 ng/μl poly(dI)·poly(dC), 0.4 ng/μl single-stranded DNA, and 0.2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin at room temperature for 10 min before the addition of the radiolabeled oligonucleotide for an additional 25 min. The specificities of the binding reactions were tested by incubating samples with a 50-fold molar excess of the unlabeled oligonucleotide probe. Protein-nucleic acid complexes were resolved using a nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel consisting of 4% acrylamide (29:1 ratio of acrylamide/bisacrylamide) and run in 0.5× TBE buffer (45 mm Tris-HCl, 45 mm boric aid, 1 mmEDTA) for 2.5 h at constant current (25 mA). Gels were transferred to Whatman 3M paper, dried under vacuum at 80 °C for 40 min, and exposed to photographic film at −70 °C with an intensifying screen. For supershift studies, before the addition of the radiolabeled probe, samples were incubated for 30 min with isotype control, p65, or p50 antibody (Ab) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). After discarding growth medium, HT-29 cells were treated with Selectamine medium containing NaCl (140 mm) or a combination of NaCl (60 mm) and LiCl (80 mm) for varying lengths of time. 10 μg of cytosolic protein extracts were separated on 8–16% Tris/glycine gel (Novex, San Diego, CA) and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was probed with anti-phospho-p38 or anti-p42/44 MAP kinase Ab (Promega, Madison, WI) and subsequently incubated with a secondary horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit antibody (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Bands were detected using ECL Western blotting detection reagent (Invitrogen). For transient transfections, 2–4 × 105 HT-29 cells were seeded per well of a 24-well tissue culture dish 1 day prior to transient transfection. Cells were transfected with serum-free RPMI 1640 medium containing 25 μl/ml of LipofectAMINE 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) and 10 μg/ml plasmid DNA including an NF-κB luciferase promoter construct or the empty vector (CLONTECH, San Diego, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. This NF-κB luciferase vector contains four tandem copies of the NF-κB consensus sequence fused to a TATA-like promoter region from the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase promoter. After 5 h of incubation, medium was replaced with McCoy's 5A medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were allowed to recover at 37 °C for 20 h and subsequently were exposed to Selectamine medium containing NaCl (140 mm) or a combination of NaCl (60 mm) and LiCl (80 mm). Luciferase activity was measured by the Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega, Madison, WI) and normalized relative to μg of protein. Mitochondrial respiration, an indicator of cell viability, was assessed by the mitochondria-dependent reduction of MTT to formazan. Cells in 96-well plates were incubated with MTT (0.5 mg/ml) for 60 min at 37 °C. Culture medium was removed by aspiration, and the cells were solubilized in Me2SO (100 μl). The extent of reduction of MTT to formazan within cells was quantitated by measurement of optical density at 550 nm using a Spectramax 250 microplate reader (16Haskó G. Kuhel D.G. Chen J.F.

Values throughout are expressed as mean ± S.E. of n observations. Statistical analysis of the data was performed by one-way analysis of variance followed by Dunnett's test, as appropriate. We first examined the effect of lithium on the production of IL-8. Replacement of NaCl with equimolar LiCl stimulated IL-8 production (Fig. 1). The effect of LiCl was concentration-dependent in the 0–60 mm range. However, higher concentrations of LiCl failed to further increase the production of IL-8 (Fig. 1). Lithium was also tested in Caco-2 cells, where, similar to HT-29 cells, it increased the release of IL-8 (data not shown). The IL-8 concentrations induced by lithium were comparable with those elicited by a high dose of IL-1β (20 ng/ml; data not shown). Next, we determined, whether the stimulatory effect of NaCl replacement with LiCl was due to a decrease in external Na+concentration or an increase in Li+ concentration. As shown, in Fig. 2, replacement of 80 mm extracellular NaCl with 80 mm choline chloride failed to up-regulate IL-8 production, whereas replacement with 80 mm LiCl stimulated IL-8 production. Similar to choline chloride, no increase in IL-8 production was observed when NaCl was replaced with isosmolar mannitol (data not shown). Thus, the presence of lithium but not the reduction in extracellular Na+ causes the augmentation of IL-8 production when NaCl is replaced with LiCl. We next examined whether the effect of lithium on IL-8 protein synthesis was associated with increased accumulation of IL-8 mRNA. Replacement of NaCl (80 mm) with equimolar LiCl stimulated IL-8 mRNA accumulation as measured by RT-PCR (Fig.3). The stimulatory effect of lithium on IL-8 mRNA accumulation was selective, because lithium failed to affect mRNA levels of the housekeeping gene GAPDH. Because NF-κB is the central regulator of IL-8 gene expression in IECs (13Jobin C. Sartor R.B. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: C451-C462Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we examined the effect of lithium on NF-κB activation by measuring both NF-κB DNA binding and NF-κB-dependent transcriptional activity. Exposure of HT-29 cells to medium containing 80 mm LiCl and 60 mm NaCl induced an NF-κB DNA binding complex that was not seen in cells exposed to 140 mm NaCl (Fig.4). This complex could be detected as early as 15 min after stimulation with lithium, became maximal 45 min after the stimulus, and had almost completely disappeared 90 min following stimulation (Fig. 4). Supershift studies indicated that the band induced by lithium contained both p65 and p50, while the lower, constitutive band contained p50 but not p65 (Fig. 5 A). That is because both the p50 and p65 Abs shifted the upper complex, and only the p50 Ab shifted, albeit only partially, the lower complex. Stimulation of the cells with IL-1β induced a complex that was identical in its position to the one induced by lithium and also contained both p50 and p65 (Fig.5 B).Figure 5A, amiloride pretreatment (300 μm) inhibits lithium-induced NF-κB DNA binding in HT-29 cells. After discarding growth medium (140 mm NaCl), cells were treated with medium containing 60 mm NaCl and 80 mm LiCl for 45 min. Amiloride or its vehicle was added to the cells together with LiCl-containing medium. NF-κB-specific complexes are indicated by arrows as determined by Ab supershifting. Control cells were treated with medium containing 140 mm NaCl. B, IL-1β (20 ng/ml) treatment of HT-29 cells for 45 min induces a DNA binding complex similar to the one induced by lithium. This figure is representative of three separate experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We next investigated whether the lithium-induced increase in NF-κB DNA binding corresponded with an increase in NF-κB-dependent gene transcription. To this end, HT-29 cells were transiently transfected with a NF-κB-luciferase reporter construct or the empty vector. Exposure of HT-29 cells to lithium for 16 h induced a substantial increase in luciferase activity in the cells transfected with the NF-κB-luciferase reporter construct but not the empty vector (Fig. 6). Therefore, we can conclude that lithium activates NF-κB-dependent transcriptional activity in HT-29 cells. Activation of the p38 and p42/44 MAP kinases is an important step in the cascade of cellular events leading to IL-8 production in IECs (18Jobin C. Bradham C.A. Russo M.P. Juma B. Narula A.S.

Immunol. 2000; 164: 966-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined whether lithium (80 mm NaCl replaced with 80 mm LiCl) enhanced IL-8 production by a mechanism involving p38 and p42/44. Using Western blotting, we found that lithium induced both p38 and p42/44 activation in HT-29 cells (Fig. 7). Lithium induced both p38 and p42/44 activation as early as 15 min after stimulation, which remained increased during the 90-min observation period. To examine whether this activation of p38 and p42/44 caused by lithium contributed to the stimulatory effect of lithium on IL-8 production, we next investigated whether MAP kinase inhibition decreased lithium-induced IL-8 production. Treatment of the cells with either the selective p38 inhibitor SB 203580 (Fig.8 A) or the selective p42/44 inhibitor PD 98059 (Fig. 8 B) produced a concentration-dependent blunting of the IL-8 response to lithium. Furthermore, neither of these inhibitors caused any toxicity, as determined using the MTT assay (data not shown). These data indicate that both p38 and p42/44 activation contribute to the stimulatory effect of lithium on IL-8 production by IECs. Since NHEs are important membrane proteins that are involved in mediating the cellular effects of lithium (22Parker J.C. J. Gen. Physiol. 1986; 87: 189-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 23Davis B.A. Hogan E.M. Boron W.F. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 263: C246-C256Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Kobayashi Y. Pang T. Iwamoto T. Wakabayashi S. Shigekawa M. Pflugers Arch. 2000; 439: 455-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), we tested the possibility that lithium increased IL-8 production via an NHE-dependent mechanism. Inhibition of NHE activation with amiloride, MIA, or EIPA almost completely abrogated the stimulatory effect of lithium on IL-8 production (Fig.9, A–C). Furthermore, the nonselective NHE inhibitors cimetidine, harmaline, and clonidine (25Szabo E.Z. Numata M. Shull G.E. Orlowski J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6302-6307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar,26Yu F.H. Shull G.E. Orlowski J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25536-25541Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) all blunted the IL-8 response to lithium (Fig. 9, D andE). The effects of NHE inhibitors were specific, because none of the NHE inhibitors had any effect on cell viability (data not shown). Furthermore, similar to its effect on IL-8 production, amiloride reduced the lithium-induced increase in IL-8 mRNA levels, confirming that NHEs play a central role in the lithium-induced IL-8 response in HT-29 cells (Fig. 3). Finally, similar to its action on IL-8 protein synthesis and mRNA expression, NHE inhibition by amiloride caused a nearly complete disappearance of the lithium-induced NF-κB DNA binding complex (Fig. 5). In this study, we demonstrate that lithium induces a full-blown inflammatory response in human IECs. Numerous studies have reported that lithium enhances inflammatory events in immunostimulated macrophages and lymphocytes (9Beyaert R. Schulze-Osthoff K. Van Roy F. Fiers W. Cytokine. 1991; 3: 284-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 10Beyaert R. De Heyninck K. Valck D. Boeykens F. van Roy F. Fiers W. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 291-300PubMed Google Scholar, 11Maes M. Song C. Lin A.H. Pioli R. Kenis G. Kubera M. Bosmans E. Psychopharmacology. 1999; 143: 401-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 27Wu Y.Y. Yang X.H. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1991; 198: 620-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). However, our study is the first one to demonstrate that lithium activates an inflammatory response even in the absence of conventional immunostimulatory/inflammatory stimuli. Central to this lithium-induced inflammatory response of IECs is the early activation (15 min after lithium treatment) of the NF-κB system. In addition, lithium activates several of the early intracellular cascades characteristic of the IEC inflammatory response including the p38 and p42/44 MAP kinase systems. These early pathways play a central role in mediating later events of the IEC inflammatory response, such as the up-regulation of IL-8 gene expression. It is unlikely that lithium acts on all of these various inflammatory events and enzyme cascades independently. A more plausible scenario is that lithium targets an early pathway upstream from MAP kinases and transcription factors. For example, it is conceivable that lithium stimulates a membrane receptor whose ligation by its ligands normally induces a response similar to the one observed with lithium. Possible candidates are the IL-1 and tumor necrosis factor-α as well as the Toll receptors, which are the major membrane structures responsible for relaying extracellular inflammatory signals toward intracellular effector sites of inflammation in IECs (21Cario E.

Gut. 1994; 35: 338-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). If lithium acted via one of these receptors, then we would expect lithium to cause an inflammatory response in monocytes/macrophages in the absence of extracellular inflammatory stimuli such as bacterial products or cytokines, because monocytes/macrophages express all of the cytokine and Toll receptors that are present on IECs (31Aderem A. Crit. Care Med. 2001; 29: S16-S18Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). However, because, as described above, lithium alone fails to induce inflammatory activity in monocytes/macrophages, it appears improbable that the proinflammatory effects of lithium in IECs are mediated by inflammatory membrane receptors. The best characterized targets of lithium are inositol monophosphatase (32Hallcher L.M. Sherman W.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 10896-10901Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Berridge M.J.

A. 1994; 91: 5738-5739Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) as well as glycogen synthase kinase-3β (35Klein P.S. Melton D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8455-8459Crossref PubMed Scopus (2056) Google Scholar). Furthermore, other protein kinases, such as protein kinase C (36Jope R.S. Williams M.B. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1994; 47: 429-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar) and myristoylated alanine-rich C kinase substrate (36Jope R.S. Williams M.B. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1994; 47: 429-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar) as well as G proteins (37Avissar S. Schreiber G. Danon A. Belmaker R.H. Nature. 1988; 331: 440-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar) have also been documented to be the targets of lithium's action. Lithium regulates these pathways with an EC50 value of 0.1–2 mm (1Phiel C.J. Klein P.S. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2001; 41: 789-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). The fact that lithium stimulated IEC IL-8 production with an EC50 value of ∼30 mm suggests that the above pathways are unlikely to be involved in the proinflammatory effects of lithium in IECs. Na+/H+ exchangers (antiporters, NHEs) are a family of ubiquitous plasma membrane transport proteins that catalyze the exchange of extracellular Na+ for intracellular H+ (38Demaurex N. Grinstein S. J. Exp. Biol. 1994; 196: 389-404PubMed Google Scholar, 39Grinstein S. Wieczorek H. J. Exp. Biol. 1994; 196: 307-318PubMed Google Scholar). Recent evidence indicates that NHEs also regulate inflammatory processes. NHEs are rapidly activated in response to a variety of inflammatory signals, such as IL-1 (40Civitelli R. Teitelbaum S.L. Hruska K.A. Lacey D.L. J. Immunol. 1989; 143: 4000-4008PubMed Google Scholar), tumor necrosis factor-α (41Vairo G. Royston A.K. Hamilton J.A. J. Cell. Physiol. 1992; 151: 630-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), interferon-γ (42Prpic V. Yu S.F. Figueiredo F. Hollenbach P.W. Gawdi G. Herman B. Uhing R.J. Adams D.O.

On the other hand, inhibition of NHEs suppresses inflammatory responses, including IL-8 production by monocytes and respiratory epithelial cells as well as macrophage inflammatory protein-1α, macrophage inflammatory protein-2 (mouse homolog of IL-8), and IL-12 production by macrophages (44Mastronarde J.G.

Deitch, C. Szabó, Z. Fekete, C. J. Hauser, and G. Haskó, unpublished observation. Although lithium inhibits NHE function in many systems (47Aronson P.S. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1985; 47: 545-560Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), recent studies have shown that lithium, in the concentration range in which it activates IEC IL-8 production, can also activate NHEs in a cell type-specific fashion (22Parker J.C. J. Gen. Physiol. 1986; 87: 189-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 23Davis B.A. Hogan E.M. Boron W.F. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 263: C246-C256Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Kobayashi Y. Pang T. Iwamoto T. Wakabayashi S. Shigekawa M. Pflugers Arch. 2000; 439: 455-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). This fact, coupled with the observation that NHE inhibition almost completely prevented the proinflammatory effects of lithium, demonstrates a key role for these proteins in mediating the IEC inflammatory response to lithium. Recent molecular cloning studies have confirmed that NHEs constitute a gene family from which seven mammalian isoforms (NHE1, NHE2, NHE3, NHE4, NHE5, NHE6, and NHE7) have been cloned and sequenced (25Szabo E.Z.

Chem. 2001; 276: 17387-17394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Importantly, even in the same cell, lithium can activate or inhibit NHEs, depending on the isoforms expressed (24Kobayashi Y. Pang T. Iwamoto T. Wakabayashi S. Shigekawa M. Pflugers Arch. 2000; 439: 455-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). While monocytes/macrophages express only NHE1 (50Demaurex N. Orlowski J. Brisseau G. Woodside M. Grinstein S. J. Gen. Physiol. 1995; 106: 85-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), IECs have been shown to express NHE1–4 (51Janecki A.J. Montrose M.H. Tse C.M. de Medina F.S. Zweibaum A. Donowitz M. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: G292-G305PubMed Google Scholar, 52Maouyo D. Chu S. Montrose M.H. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: C973-C981Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 53Turner J.R. Black E.D. Ward J. Tse C.M. Uchwat F.A. Alli H.A. Donowitz M. Madara J.L. Angle J.M. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: C1918-C1924Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that the differential regulation of inflammation in monocytes/macrophages and IECs by lithium is due to the differential expression of NHEs in these cell types. Since plasma lithium concentrations that induce NHE activation as well as IEC IL-8 production are fatal in humans, it is improbable that the lithium-induced activation of IEC inflammatory activity has any physiological significance. However, as both Parker (22Parker J.C. J. Gen. Physiol. 1986; 87: 189-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) and Daviset al. (23Davis B.A. Hogan E.M. Boron W.F. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 263: C246-C256Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) suggested, lithium may mimic a physiological stimulus, most probably extracellular hyperosmolarity, that is capable of activating NHEs. Given our recent observation that extracellular hyperosmolarity stimulates the IEC inflammatory response in a similar NHE-dependent manner as lithium,2 it can be proposed that extracellular hyperosmolarity is the physiological stimulus for the NHE-mediated inflammatory response in IECs. Furthermore, because the cytokine-induced IEC inflammatory response also has an NHE-dependent component,2 we speculate that the mechanism of NHE promotion of inflammatory processes may have evolved as a positive feedback signal during IEC activation. In summary, our experiments using IECs demonstrate that the intracellular targets of lithium's action involve both NF-κB and MAP kinase activation. Furthermore, this activation of NF-κB and MAP kinases results in the development of an inflammatory response in IECs.

In this study, we show that intra- and intermolecular guanosine quartets (G-quartets) can inhibit top1-mediated DNA cleavage at a high affinity site. Top1-mediated DNA cleavage was also inhibited by a 16-mer single-stranded oligodeoxynucleotide (ODN) containing a G-rich sequence (G2T2G5TG2TG3) and by its RNA equivalent, neither of which form G-quartet structures. A comparison of various single-stranded ODN for their ability to inhibit top1-mediated DNA cleavage indicated that G-rich sequences containing repeats of 2 or 3 consecutive guanines interspaced with thymines specifically inhibited top1. We also found that both single-stranded and G-quartet-forming ODNs bind to top1 without being cleaved by the enzyme. These results demonstrate that either DNA or RNA G-rich single-stranded and G-quartet-forming oligonucleotides can bind to top1 and prevent cleavage of duplex DNA.

Pucshansky L. Marco Y. Benjamin S. Manor H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 297-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), the Bloom's syndrome helicase (Blm (18Sun H. Karow J.K. Hickson I.D.

Eukaryotic nuclear DNA topoisomerase I (top1)1 is an ubiquitous and multifunctional enzyme that regulates DNA topology during transcription, replication, chromosome condensation, and possibly recombination (for review see Refs. 21Gupta M. Fujimori A. Pommier Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1262: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar and 22Wang J.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 635-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (2076) Google Scholar) by reversibly cleaving one strand of duplex DNA and relaxing DNA supercoiling. For the cleavage reaction, top1 forms a covalent 3′-phosphotyrosyl bond between a tyrosine residue (Tyr-723 for human top1) and the 3′-end of the broken DNA strand while leaving a 5′-hydroxyl terminus at the other end of the cleaved DNA (23Champoux J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 4805-4809Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Under normal conditions, the cleavage complexes are rapidly reversible after relaxation of DNA supercoiling (intramolecular reactions) and eventually DNA recombination (intermolecular reactions). Top1 inhibitors, such as camptothecin and its derivatives, selectively inhibit eukaryotic top1 by reversibly preventing the religation step of the enzyme-mediated DNA nicking-closing reaction (24Chen A.Y. Liu L.F. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1994; 94: 194-218Google Scholar, 25Pommier Y. Semin. Oncol. 1996; 23: 1-10Google Scholar). Dissociation of the DNA strand 3′ from the cleavage site, due to the presence of a nick, gap, or single-stranded branch in the vicinity, prevents the religation step of top1 catalytic reaction (26Pourquier P. Pilon A.A. Kohlhagen G. Mazumder A. Sharma A. Pommier Y. J. Biol.

Cancer Res. 2001; 80: 189-216Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Such substrates, commonly referred to as “suicide substrates,” have been very useful in the study of the top1 catalytic cycle because they can be used to monitor, under single turnover conditions, the top1-mediated DNA cleavage step (28Svejstrup J.Q.

Because top1 has been reported to bind to noncanonical DNA structures including three-stranded flaps, triple helical DNA, and Holliday junctions (30Pourquier P. Jensen A.D. Gong S.S. Pommier Y.

A partially single-stranded 18-mer ODN,TH-18 (Fig. 1 B), containing a high affinity site (26Pourquier P. Pilon A.A. Kohlhagen G. Mazumder A. Sharma A. Pommier Y. J. Biol.

In this case, top1 becomes irreversibly bonded to the 3′-DNA terminus, because a pentamer oligonucleotide (28Svejstrup J.Q. Christiansen K. Gromova I.I. Andersen A.H. Westergaard O. J. Mol.

High pressure liquid chromatography-purified oligonucleotides were purchased from Bioserve Biotechnologies (Laurel, MD) and high pressure stopped-flow-purified oligonucleotides from MGW Biotech Inc. (High Point, NC). [α-32P]Cordycepin 5′-triphosphate was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Polyacrylamide gel solutions were from National Diagnostics (Atlanta, GA). Human N-terminal truncated recombinant top1 (68 kDa) was expressed and purified essentially as reported previously (37Pourquier P. Takebayashi Y. Urasaki Y. Gioffre C. Kohlhagen G. Pommier Y. Proc.

Briefly, the top1 gene was cloned into a baculovirus transfer vector (pBacGus-1, Novagen, Madison, WI) and used to make a recombinant baculovirus following the manufacturer's recommendations (BD-PharMingen, San Diego, CA). Top1 protein was then expressed in TN5 insect cells (HighFive, Invitrogen) by the recombinant baculovirus and purified via the N-terminal His tag essentially as described (26Pourquier P. Pilon A.A.

Jenkins J. Kohlhagen G. Leteurtre F. Mutat. Res. 1995; 337: 135-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The oligonucleotides were annealed in a buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 5 mmMgCl2 by heating for 5 min at 95 °C and cooling 30 min at 37 °C. Intramolecular G-quartet structures were prepared as described previously (15Jing N.J. Marchand C. Liu J. Mitra R. Hogan M.E. Pommier Y. J. Biol.

Briefly, oligonucleotides at 5 μm strand equivalent were heated at 90 °C for 5 min in 20 mm Li3PO4, pH 7.0 and then cooled at 4 °C for 30 min in the presence of 10 mm KCl. Intramolecular G-quartet formation was checked by thermal denaturation and circular dichroism experiments (15Jing N.J. Marchand C. Liu J. Mitra R. Hogan M.E. Pommier Y. J. Biol.

Intermolecular G-quartet structures were prepared as described previously (19Sun H. Bennett R.J. Maizels N. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 1978-1984Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. 20 nm of 5′-end labeled single-stranded oligonucleotide was incubated for 72 h at room temperature with the same unlabeled strand (10 mm ) in a buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 1m NaCl. Intermolecular G-quartet formation was checked by gel shift assay (19Sun H. Bennett R.J. Maizels N. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 1978-1984Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Samples were diluted 1:10 with 10 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm KCl, and 1 mm EDTA prior to the addition of 0.5 volume of nondenaturing dye (30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mg/ml bromphenol blue, and 30% glycerol). The samples were then loaded on an 8% polyacrylamide native gel (29:1) run in 0.5× TBE (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.4, 90 mmboric acid, and 1 mm EDTA) and 10 mm KCl. Electrophoresis was performed at 4 °C and 5 V/cm for 3 h. The suicide cleavage reactions were performed as described previously (36Pourquier P. Ueng L.M. Fertala J. Wang D. Park H.J. Essigmann J.M. Bjornsti M.A. Pommier Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8516-8523Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Briefly, 5 pmol of recombinant top 1 were preincubated with the G-rich oligonucleotide for 5 min at room temperature in a buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 15 μg/ml of bovine serum albumin, and 0.2 mm dithiothreitol. Irreversible top1-mediated DNA cleavage reaction was initiated by addition of 25 fmol of 3′-end labeledTH-18 DNA substrate in a total volume of 10 μl, and the samples were incubated for 15 min at room temperature. Reactions were stopped by adding 0.5 volume of denaturing loading dye (100% formamide, 1 mg/ml bromphenol blue, and 1 mg/ml xylene cyanol blue), and the samples were loaded on a 20% (19:1) polyacrylamide gel containing 7 m urea and 1× TBE. A 202-bp DNA fragment was generated by PCR from the pBluescript SK(−) phagemid (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) using the following primers: forward (514–534), 5′-GCCTCTTCGCTATTACGCCAG-3′; and reverse (693–716), 5′-GGCTGCAGGAATTCGATATCAAGC-3′. The PCR product was gel-purified using the QIAEX II Gel Purification System (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and digested by HindIII. The resulting 177-bp DNA fragment was 3′-end labeled as described previously (40Cushman M. Jayaraman M. Vroman J.A. Fukunaga A.K. Fox B.M. Kohlhagen G. Strumberg D. Pommier Y. J. Med. Chem. 2000; 43: 3688-3698Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), resuspended in water, and used at ∼50 nmol/reaction (50,000 dpm). Reaction conditions were identical to the ones used in the suicide reaction except for the addition of camptothecin (see above). 10 pmol of recombinant top 1 was incubated for 30 min at room temperature with 25 fmol of 3′-end-labeled DNA substrate in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 50 mm NaCl in a total volume of 10 μl. The samples were treated with 0.5 volume of nondenaturing loading dye (30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mg/ml bromphenol blue, and 30% glycerol), loaded on a 6% (19:1) polyacrylamide gel containing 0.5× TBE, and electrophoresed at 4 °C, 100 V for 2 h. Imaging and quantitation of the gels were performed using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). We first studied the influence of two well characterized G-quartet-forming ODNs (T30923 and T40216) (15Jing N.J. Marchand C. Liu J. Mitra R. Hogan M.E. Pommier Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21460-21467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) on top1-mediated DNA cleavage (Fig. 2 A). Both oligonucleotides inhibited top1 cleavage activity at low nanomolar concentrations (Fig. 2 A). The oligonucleotideT40216 was more potent than T30923, suggesting that the length of the quartet could play a role in the inhibitory effect (Fig. 2 B). T40216 was only 3 to 4 times less potent (Fig. 2 B) than the high affinity full duplex substrate TH-36 (Fig.1 A), which competed with the labeled suicide substrate (final concentration 2.5 nm) and inhibited 50% of top1 cleavage (defined as IC50) at ∼6 nm (Fig. 2 B). These results demonstrate that top1-mediated DNA cleavage can be inhibited at low nanomolar concentrations by intramolecular G-quartet ODNs. Because we observed that top1 can be inhibited by intramolecular G-quartets, we next investigated the effect of intermolecular G-quartet structures on top1-mediated DNA cleavage. We chose a 30-mer G-rich single-stranded oligonucleotide [ODN-1] (Fig. 3 A) derived from the yeast telomeric sequence of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. This oligonucleotide can form an intermolecular parallel G-quartet (19Sun H. Bennett R.J. Maizels N. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 1978-1984Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar) for which formation can be monitored by gel electrophoresis (Fig. 3 B). Both single-stranded [ODN-1:SS] and quadruplex [ODN-1:G4] conformations were tested (Fig. 3 C). The intermolecular G-quartet inhibited top1-mediated DNA cleavage with an IC50of ∼100 nm, which is higher than for the intramolecular G-quartets T30963 and T40216 (2- and 5-fold, respectively, compare Figs. 3 B and 2 B). Interestingly, ODN-1:SS was also active with an IC50 ∼3 times higher than ODN-1:G4 (Fig. 3,B and C). These results demonstrate that intermolecular G-quartets can also inhibit top1-mediated DNA cleavage at a high affinity site in duplex DNA. We next investigated whether a G-quartet-forming structure or a sequence containing consecutive guanosines (G-stretch) was sufficient to prevent top1 cleavage at its high affinity site. For this purpose, we designed the oligonucleotide [ODN-2], which was derived from T30923 (Fig.4 A). ODN-2 has the same base content as T30923 (12 guanines and 4 thymines) but cannot form either intra- or intermolecular G-quartets as verified by gel mobility, thermal denaturation, and circular dichroism experiments (data not shown). Nevertheless, ODN-2 inhibited top1-mediated DNA cleavage at low nanomolar concentration (Fig.4 B) and was as potent as the intramolecular G-quartetsT30963 and T40216 (see Fig. 2). ODN-2was ∼6-fold more efficient than its duplex homologue, [ODN-2d], and was markedly more potent than its C-rich complementary strand, [ODN-2c] (by at least 2 orders of magnitude) (Fig. 4 B). ODN-2 was also ∼50-fold more potent than a non-G-rich single-stranded DNA of the same length, corresponding to the last 16 bases of HIV-1 U5 long terminal repeat sequence [ODN-3]. These results demonstrate that the single-stranded G-rich oligonucleotide ODN-2 effectively inhibits DNA cleavage. To further investigate the influence of the guanine distribution in single-stranded oligonucleotides, different G-rich sequences were tested (Fig. 5 A). In the oligonucleotide ODN-5, one of the thymines was moved in order to disrupt the G-stretch present in the middle of ODN-2 (Fig. 5 A). ODN-5 showed approximately the same potency as ODN-2 (Fig.5 B), indicating that the 5-mer G-stretch present in the middle of ODN-2 is not required for top1 inhibition. Consistent with this observation, we found that an oligonucleotide containing only a central stretch of guanosines flanked by one thymine, [ODN-10], only inhibited top1-mediated DNA cleavage above micromolar concentrations (Fig. 5 B). The presence and position of the thymines in ODN-2 were then investigated by placing two of the four thymines at both extremities of the sequence. ODN-6 was ∼5-fold less potent than ODN-2 (Fig. 5 B). This difference increased to ∼15-fold when the thymines were replaced by four guanines in the poly-G ODN-7, demonstrating the importance of the thymines for activity. To investigate whether top1 cleavage could be inhibited by 5′-TpG-3′ steps, which represent high affinity sites for human top1 in duplex DNA (28Svejstrup J.Q. Christiansen K. Gromova I.I. Andersen A.H. Westergaard O. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 222: 669-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 41Been M.D. Burgess R.R. Champoux J.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 3097-3114Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 42Porter S.E. Champoux J.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 541-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), a 16-mer ODN with an alternating TG sequence, [ODN-8], was tested. This oligonucleotide was ∼150-fold less potent than ODN-2. Weak activity was also observed for a 16-mer oligonucleotide formed by four TTGG repeats, [ODN-9]. These results demonstrate the importance of the DNA sequence of G-rich single-stranded ODNs for top1-mediated DNA cleavage inhibition. We next tested the effect of G-rich ODNs on camptothecin-induced top1 trapping on DNA. We performed these experiments with thePvuII-HindIII digested pBluescript SK(−) 177-bp DNA fragment, which contains previously characterized top1 cleavage sites (40Cushman M. Jayaraman M. Vroman J.A. Fukunaga A.K. Fox B.M. Kohlhagen G. Strumberg D. Pommier Y. J. Med. Chem. 2000; 43: 3688-3698Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Fig. 6 shows that both oligonucleotides T30923 and ODN-2 inhibited the camptothecin-induced DNA cleavage at all sites examined. As in the case of the TH-18 suicide substrate, ODN-2 was more potent than T30923 (Fig. 6). Gel shift experiments were performed to determine top1 binding to the G-rich single-stranded ODN-2 and to the G-quartet forming oligonucleotides (T30923 &T40216). These three substrates produced a band with retarded electrophoretic mobility when incubated with purified top1 (Fig. 7 A). Binding efficiencies for these oligonucleotides were lower than forTH-36. To investigate further the binding of G-rich oligonucleotides to top1, competition experiments were performed in the presence of both the high affinity duplex TH-36 and ODN-2. In these experiments, a DNA-protein complex was formed between top1 and 32P-labeled TH-36 in the presence of increasing concentrations of unlabeled ODN-2 or unlabeled TH-36 (Fig. 7 B). At high concentrations of unlabeled oligonucleotide, the band corresponding to the top1-labeled TH-36 complex on the gel disappeared for both ODN-2 and TH-36. This indicates that both oligonucleotides displaced top1 from its labeled substrate (TH-36). The efficiency of strand displacement was ∼10 times lower for ODN-2 than for TH-36 (Fig.7 B). Furthermore, in the experiments including bothTH-36 and ODN-2, we did not observe any supershift of the top1-DNA band suggesting that top1 binds either to its duplex high affinity substrate TH-36 or to the single-stranded G-rich ODN-2 but not to both at the same time. These results demonstrate that G-rich oligonucleotides can bind competitively to top1 and prevent the enzyme from cleaving duplex DNA. To determine whether the G-quartets and G-rich single-stranded ODNs could be substrates for top1, the G-rich ODNs were labeled and tested for top1-mediated DNA cleavage. As expected, camptothecin induced cleavage in the TH-36 ODN (see Fig.1 A for sequence). Camptothecin also enhanced cleavage in the suicide TH-18 ODN, indicating that top1-mediated DNA cleavage in this oligonucleotide is partially reversible. Using ODN-2, cleavage was not detected either in the absence or presence of camptothecin (Fig. 8). A similar result was obtained with the G-quartet ODNs T30923and T40216 (data not shown), demonstrating that these G-rich ODNs are not cleaved by top1. We next tested the effect of single-stranded RNA on the inhibition of top1-mediated DNA cleavage. First we designed an oligodeoxynucleotide identical to ODN-2 in which thymines were replaced by uracils (Fig.9 A). ODN-11inhibited top1 DNA-mediated cleavage (Fig. 9 B) and was ∼4-fold less potent than the parental ODN-2. The RNA equivalent of ODN-11, [ORN-12] (Fig.9 A), was ∼2-fold more potent than its ODN homologue (Fig.9, B and C). Thus, top1-mediated DNA cleavage can be efficiently inhibited by single-stranded G-rich RNA. The present study demonstrates that both intra- and intermolecular G-quartets and single-stranded G-rich ODNs inhibit top1-mediated DNA cleavage. This inhibition appears to require repeats of at least 2∼3 consecutive guanines interspaced with thymines. We also demonstrate that the inhibition of top1-mediated DNA cleavage can be efficiently achieved with G-rich RNA and that the G-quartet-forming and single-stranded G-rich ODNs bind competitively to top1 without being cleaved by the enzyme. It is becoming increasingly clear that top1 can bind to noncanonical DNA structures. DNA containing partially single-stranded regions and extra-helical segments (bulges) were shown to be cleaved by the enzyme (26Pourquier P. Pilon A.A. Kohlhagen G. Mazumder A. Sharma A. Pommier Y. J.

Biol. 2000; 20: 8059-8068Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Top1 binding to triple helical DNA has also been reported (32Arimondo P.B. Moreau P. Boutorine A. Bailly C. Prudhomme M. Sun J.S. Garestier T. Hélène C. Bioorg. Med. Chem. 2000; 8: 777-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) as well as binding to Holliday junctions, which correspond to four-stranded structures as in the case of G-quartets (33Sekiguchi J. Seeman N.C. Shuman S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 785-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 34Sekiguchi J. Cheng C.H. Shuman S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 2658-2663Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However in contrast to the Holliday junctions, the G-quartets we examined are not cleaved by top1. More recently, Hélène and co-workers (51Arimondo P.B. Riou J.F. Mergny J.L. Tazi J. Sun J.S. Garestier T. Hélène C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 4832-4838Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) also reported that top1 binds to preformed inter- and intramolecular G-quartets and promotes the opening of a 69-bp duplex to form a stable intermolecular G-quartet-containing structure. It is therefore intriguing how top1 can bind to such diverse structures. Recently the structure of top1 bound covalently and noncovalently to duplex DNA has been determined, and the enzyme has been shown to encircle the DNA duplex (52Redinbo M.R. Stewart L. Kuhn P. Champoux J.J. Hol W.G.J. Science. 1998; 279: 1504-1513Crossref PubMed Scopus (776) Google Scholar, 53Redinbo M.R. Champoux J.J. Hol W.G.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 6832-6840Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The finding that top1 can also bind to G-rich single-stranded and four-stranded DNA suggests that the enzyme can accommodate various size nucleic acids. High affinity binding of top1 to single-stranded DNA or RNA has not been reported previously. In fact, binding to nonspecific single-stranded DNA with random sequence was weak (54Jaxel C. Capranico G. Kerrigan D. Kohn K.W. Pommier Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20418-20423Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and was detectable only in segments that had the potential to form duplex structures (55Been M.D. Champoux J.J. J. Mol.

Top1 enhances TFIID-TFIIA complex assembly during activation of transcription (62Shykind B.M. Kim J. Stewart L. Champoux J.J. Sharp P.A.

Cell. 1998; 1: 749-757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). In this work, we report top1 inhibition by G-rich-containing RNA oligonucleotides. The in vivo significance of top1 binding to T- and G-rich single-stranded RNA still remains to be determined, but it is possible that top1 could play a role in the stabilization of such sequences during transcription, preventing their folding into higher order structures. Top1 binding to T- and G-rich single-stranded RNA might contribute to the activity of the enzyme in RNA splicing (64Rossi F. Labourier E. Gallouzi I.E. Derancourt J. Allemand E. Divita G. Tazi J.

Import and export cargoes are recognized by importins or exportins, respectively, which belong to the importin-β type receptor family. The cargo-receptor complexes translocate through the NPC based on the direct binding of the importin-β type receptors to phenylalanine-glycine (FG-) repeat-containing nucleoporins (3Gorlich D.

In one model, importin-β, which has different affinities to various FG-repeats, migrates through the NPC toward the nucleoplasm due to an affinity gradient (7Ben Efraim I. Gerace L. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 411-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). For transportin and NTF2 it was suggested that they translocate through the NPC by equally low affinities to the different nucleoporins (8Chaillan-Huntington C. Braslavsky C.V. Kuhlmann J. Stewart M.

Human Tap was first identified as the putative mammalian orthologue of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae mRNA exporter Mex67p (11Segref A. Sharma K. Doye V. Hellwig A. Huber J. Luhrmann R. Hurt E. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3256-3271Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar) and to be necessary for the export of a viral RNA-export element called CTE (12Gruter P. Tabernero C. von Kobbe C. Schmitt C.

As does Mex67p, Tap shuttles between nucleus and cytoplasm and binds to poly(A)+ RNA in vivo (13Katahira J. Strasser K. Podtelejnikov A. Mann M. Jung J.U. Hurt E. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2593-2609Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). Tap exhibits a pronounced domain organization. The middle domain of Tap binds to p15 (13Katahira J. Strasser K.

EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5587-5598Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in vivo Tap binds to a series of intranuclear proteins including Aly (Yra1p in yeast), which are recruited to the mRNA during splicing and mark the mature and thus export-eligible mRNA (17Strasser K. Hurt E. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 410-420Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Zhou Z. Luo M.J. Straesser K. Katahira J. Hurt E. Reed R.

However, p15, which is also called NXT1, was shown to be involved in Crm1-dependent nuclear protein export (21Black B.E. Holaska J.M. Levesque L. Ossareh-Nazari B. Gwizdek C. Dargemont C. Paschal B.M. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 141-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Hence, p15 may play a role in multiple nuclear export pathways. Nuclear export of mRNAs in mammalian cells is stimulated by co-expression of p15 and Tap (22Braun I.C. Herold A. Rode M. Conti E. Izaurralde E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20536-20543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 23Guzik B.W. Levesque L. Prasad S. Bor Y.C. Black B.E. Paschal B.M. Rekosh D. Hammarskjold M.L. Mol.

Virol. 2000; 74: 5863-5871Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), and the complex formation of Tap and p15 was shown to be required for the stimulatory activity (25Fribourg S. Braun I.C. Izaurralde E. Conti E. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 645-656Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). The Tap-p15 complex is the functional orthologue of the yeast mRNA exporter Mex67p-Mtr2p, which indicates that the mRNA export pathway is conserved from yeast to human (13Katahira J. Strasser K. Podtelejnikov A. Mann M. Jung J.U. Hurt E. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2593-2609Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). Interestingly, a mutation ofMEX67 that abrogates its interaction with Mtr2p leads to mislocation of Mex67p into the cytoplasm and concomitant nuclear accumulation of poly(A)+ RNA. This suggested that complex formation of Mex67p-Mtr2p is required for both pore association and mRNA export. Furthermore, complex formation between Mex67p and Mtr2p is required for nucleoporin binding in vitro (26Strasser K. Basler J. Hurt E. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 695-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). These findings led to the conclusion that Mtr2p could function in mRNA export by altering the affinity of Mex67p to repeat nucleoporins (26Strasser K. Basler J. Hurt E. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 695-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Binding of Mex67p alone to FG-repeat nucleoporins has been also shown, but in this case it was not tested whether Mtr2p influences this interaction (27Strawn L.A. Shen T. Wente S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6445-6452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). On the other hand, Tap itself possesses a distinct affinity for FG-repeat nucleoporins. In this report, we show that p15 significantly decreases the affinity of Tap to various FG-repeats and enables the Tap-p15 heterodimer to translocate efficiently through the nuclear pores in both directions. Construction of the Escherichia coli expression vectors for untagged p15 (pET9d-p15) and for the FG-repeat domain of CAN (aa 1462–1909, pGEX-CAN4H) was reported (13Katahira J. Strasser K. Podtelejnikov A. Mann M. Jung J.U. Hurt E. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2593-2609Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). DNA fragments encoding aa 188–619 and 188–550 of Tap were amplified by PCR and subcloned into the BamHI and SalI sites of pGEX6P1 (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). DNA fragments encoding the repeat domains of hCG1 (aa 216–377), Nup98 (aa 1–466), and p62 (aa 1–300) were amplified by PCR and subcloned into theBamHI and SacI sites of pGEX-CAN4H. TapΔNLS, TapΔNLS-p15, and TapΔNLSΔC were expressed in E. colistrains BL21 (DE3) harboring pGEX6P1-TapΔNLS alone, pGEX6P1-TapΔNLS and pET9d-p15, or pGEX6P1-TapΔNLSΔC. E. coli cells were harvested, resuspended with phosphate-buffered saline (8 mmNa2HPO4/1 mmKH2PO4/137 mm NaCl/3 mmKCl (pH 7.4) containing 1 mm DTT (PBS-DTT), and disrupted by sonication. After centrifugation at 30,000 × g for 20 min, supernatants were incubated with 1 ml of glutathione-Sepharose beads (Pharmacia). After washing with PBS-DTT followed by Precission buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl/50 mmNaCl/1 mm DTT/1 mm EDTA/10% glycerol/0.2% Tween 20 (pH 8.0)), column-bound proteins were eluted by cleavage with 400 units of PreScission protease (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) at 16 °C for 1 h. Eluted proteins were subjected to MonoQ fast protein liquid chromatography column (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) pre-equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0)/1 mm DTT and eluted with linear gradient of NaCl (0 to 1m) in the same buffer. All the purification steps except protease treatment were done at 4 °C. GST-TapΔNLSΔC and GST-TapΔNLS co-expressed with untagged p15 were purified as described above except that the PreScission elution step was replaced by elution with 20 mm glutathione. The repeats of CAN, hCG1, Nup98, and p62 were purified as described (13Katahira J. Strasser K. Podtelejnikov A. Mann M. Jung J.U. Hurt E. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2593-2609Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). Labeling of proteins with fluorescent dye was achieved with the Alexa 546 labeling kit (Molecular Probes) according to the manufacturer's instruction. Unincorporated dye was removed by PD-10 gel filtration column chromatography (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) at 4 °C. By pull down experiments, we determined that the binding of the Alexa 546 labeled TapΔNLS to FG-repeats was reduced at most by 20% (data not shown). Thus, we conclude that the fluorescent labeling did not grossly interfere with the repeat binding ability of Tap. For microinjection and in vitro import assays, concentrations of the Alexa 546-labeled proteins were adjusted to 2 mg/ml in phosphate-buffered saline. Formation of HeLa cell homokaryons by Sendai virus and microinjection assay were carried out as reported (28Kose S. Imamoto N. Yoneda Y. FEBS Lett. 1999; 463: 327-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Thirty min after microinjection, cells were fixed with formaldehyde and observed with a Zeiss Axiophot II fluorescence microscope. For in vitro import assays Madin-Darby bovine kidney cells were used. Cytosolic extract was prepared from Ehrlich ascites tumor cells as reported previously (29Adam S.A. Marr R.S. Gerace L. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 807-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (767) Google Scholar). Cells grown on glass 8-well multitest slides (ICN Biomedicals) were treated with ice-cold transport buffer (20 mm HEPES-KOH, 110 mm potassium acetate, 5 mm sodium acetate, 2 mm magnesium acetate, 1 mm EGTA, 2 mm DTT (pH 7.3) containing 1 μg/ml each leupeptin, aprotinin, pepstatin, and 40 μg/ml digitonin for 5 min at 4 °C. After washing with transport buffer at room temperature, the cells were incubated at 30 °C for 30 min with import substrate mixtures containing 4 μg of the labeled proteins with or without cytosolic extract (30 μg) and an ATP-regenerating system as indicated in the figure legend. The cells were then fixed with formaldehyde and observed with a Zeiss Axiophot II fluorescence microscope. All pictures were taken with a Cool Snap HQ CCD camera (Roper Scientific), and digital images were recorded and processed with Improvision Open Lab software. The signals in nuclei were measured by using the histogram function of Adobe PhotoShop software. Pull down assays were performed as reported previously (13Katahira J. Strasser K. Podtelejnikov A. Mann M. Jung J.U. Hurt E. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2593-2609Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar, 30Kunzler M. Hurt E.C. FEBS Lett. 1998; 433: 185-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Unbound proteins were precipitated with 10% trichloroacetic acid. After extensive washing, bound proteins were eluted by treating the resin with SDS-sample buffer. Aliquots corresponding to 50% of input of the bound and unbound fractions were loaded onto SDS-14% polyacrylamide gels and protein bands were separated by electrophoresis and visualized by Coomassie staining. Ligands (GST-fused nucleoporin repeats) were immobilized via anti-GST antibody covalently attached on CM5 research-grade sensor chips (BIAcore). Activation and blocking of sensor chips and immobilization of anti-GST antibody were done using the Amine-coupling and GST antibody kits (BIAcore) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Analysis of protein-protein interactions was carried out in transport buffer containing 0.2% Tween 20 at a flow rate of 20 μl/min at 20 °C using a BIAcore 2000 system. Parallel injections of analytes over a GST-immobilized flow cell were subtracted from the data as background. Apparent K d values for TapΔNLS/p15-repeat binding were derived from Scatchard plots RU/concentration versus RU and linear regression analysis by Kyplot software (31Kern P. Hussey R.E. Spoerl R.

The absence of mass transport limitation and/or rebinding was tested by injecting TapΔNLS on sensor chips harboring different amounts of each GST-repeat at a flow rate of 20 μl/min at 20 °C. Since the sensorgrams were superimposable (data not shown), it can be concluded that the diffusion of the analyte from the bulk flow to the sensor chip surface is not kinetically limiting. Thus K d values for TapΔNLS-repeat bindings were obtained by using standard kinetic equations supplied within the BIAevaluation 3.1 software. The C-terminal domain of Tap (aa 540–619) binds directly to nucleoporins and confers to Tap the ability to translocate through the nuclear pore (13Katahira J. Strasser K. Podtelejnikov A. Mann M. Jung J.U. Hurt E. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2593-2609Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar, 33Kang Y. Cullen B.R. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1126-1139Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 34Bear J.

Chem. 2001; 276: 42355-42363Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). However, in vitro Tap requires its N-terminal NLS and transportin for nuclear import (14Bachi A. Braun I.C. Rodrigues J.P. Pante N. Ribbeck K. von Kobbe C. Kutay U. Wilm M. Gorlich D. Carmo-Fonseca M. Izaurralde E. RNA. 2000; 6: 136-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). To find out whether p15 can confer transportin-independent shuttling of Tap, fluorescently labeled TapΔNLS lacking the transportin binding site (14Bachi A. Braun I.C. Rodrigues J.P. Pante N. Ribbeck K. von Kobbe C. Kutay U. Wilm M. Gorlich D. Carmo-Fonseca M. Izaurralde E. RNA. 2000; 6: 136-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar) either alone or complexed with p15 was tested in an in vitro nuclear import assay. This revealed that TapΔNLS can enter the nucleus only when bound to p15 (Fig.1 A). In contrast, free TapΔNLS is only inefficiently imported and has the tendency to accumulate at the nuclear periphery (Fig. 1 B). Unexpectedly, nuclear import of TapΔNLS-p15 was still observed when cytosol (containing karyopherins and Ran) and an energy-regenerating system were omitted from the in vitro assay (Fig. 1 C). Under these conditions, GST-GFP-M9 import substrate was not imported into the nucleus unless cytosol and an ATP-regenerating system were added (data not shown), indicating that most of the soluble transport factors (i.e.; transportin and Ran) as well as energy are deprived. Under the same conditions, TapΔNLS alone did not enter the nucleus (Fig. 1 D). These data indicate that upon complex formation with p15 TapΔNLS gains the ability to translocate through the nuclear pore and no longer requires transportin/RanGTP for nuclear import. In the light of this finding, the role of the N-terminal NLS of Tap remains unclear. Transportin could be required for the rapid re-import of free Tap and/or for nuclear import of newly synthesized Tap only. Another possibility is that transportin is required for efficient release of mRNP cargoes from Tap-p15, since the N-terminal NLS and the RNA-binding domain of Tap are adjacent to each other. To analyze nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of TapΔNLS-p15 in vivo, fluorescently labeled TapΔNLS, either alone or in complex with p15 were microinjected into the cytoplasm or nucleus of HeLa cell homokaryons. When free TapΔNLS was injected into one of the several nuclei of a homokaryon, it was not exported (Fig. 2 C). Similarly, TapΔNLS injected into the cytoplasm of a homokaryon was not imported into the nucleus (Fig. 2 D). In contrast, the TapΔNLS-p15 complex, regardless of the injection site, was able to translocate through the nuclear pores in both directions and rapidly accumulated in the nuclei (Fig. 2, A and B). The ability of Tap-p15 to shuttle depends on the ability of TapΔNLS to bind to FG-repeat nucleoporins, since TapΔNLS lacking its C-terminal domain but bound to p15 (GST-TapΔNLSΔC-p15), showed a reduced binding to FG-repeat Nups (see below) and lost the ability to shuttle between the nucleus and cytoplasm (Fig. 2, E and F). The inability of GST-TapΔNLSΔC-p15 to shuttle is not due to the larger complex size caused by the GST tag, since GST-TapΔNLS-p15 is still able to translocate through the nuclear pores (Fig. 2 G andH). Taken together, our results show that complex formation with p15 enables Tap to translocate through the nuclear pores in both directions. It is well documented that Tap can interact directly with FG-repeat-containing nucleoporins CAN/Nup214 and hCG1 via its C-terminal domain (aa 507–619) (13Katahira J. Strasser K. Podtelejnikov A. Mann M. Jung J.U. Hurt E. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2593-2609Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar, 33Kang Y. Cullen B.R. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1126-1139Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Since p15 is necessary for shuttling of Tap in vivo, p15 could modulate the FG-repeat binding ability of Tap. To test this possibility, the binding of TapΔNLS alone or the TapΔNLS-p15 complex to nucleoporin repeats was analyzed in vitro. As reported earlier, purified TapΔNLS can bind to the FG-repeat domains of CAN and hCG1 (Fig.3 A and B,lanes 2–4). In addition to these FG-nucleoporins, TapΔNLS also bound efficiently to the FXFG-repeats of p62 and GLFG-repeats of Nup98 (Fig. 3, C andD, lanes 2–4; see also Ref. 14Bachi A. Braun I.C. Rodrigues J.P. Pante N. Ribbeck K. von Kobbe C. Kutay U. Wilm M. Gorlich D. Carmo-Fonseca M. Izaurralde E. RNA. 2000; 6: 136-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). In contrast to the strong binding of TapΔNLS to FG-repeats, binding of TapΔNLS complexed to p15 was weaker since most of the complex was recovered in the unbound fraction (Fig. 3, A–D, lanes 5–7and 13–15). We conclude that complex formation with p15 reduces the affinity of Tap to nucleoporin repeats. To obtain quantitative data on the binding of TapΔNLS +/− p15 to repeat nucleoporins, we performed BIAcore measurements. Repeat sequences from the different nucleoporins were immobilized on a sensor chip and varying concentrations of TapΔNLS or TapΔNLS-p15 complex were injected. Free TapΔNLS bound very efficiently to all of the repeat sequences tested and dissociated extremely slowly (Fig.4 A). The K dvalue of free Tap to nucleoporin repeats lies in the nmrange, showing that Tap alone binds very strongly to repeat nucleoporins (Fig. 4 A, inset). In contrast, the TapΔNLS-p15 complex showed a weaker and transient interaction with the different nucleoporin repeats; accordingly, ∼10 times more TapΔNLS-p15 complex had to be used in the Biacore binding assays. Strikingly, the sensorgram exhibited almost a rectangular shape indicative of an extremely high dissociation rate of Tap-p15 from the repeat sequences (Fig. 4 B, left panels). Since the on/off rates for TapΔNLS-p15 from FG-repeats (except CAN4 repeats) were too fast to be reliably calculated by kinetic analysis, the apparent dissociation constants (K d) were obtained by Scatchard analysis. The TapΔNLS-p15 complex binds to nucleoporin repeats with a K d in the μm range (see Fig. 4 B, right panels). The efficient binding of Tap to repeat sequences requires the C-domain of Tap, since deletion of this domain significantly reduced the amount of Tap-p15 bound to repeats (Fig. 4 C). However, a residual but significant binding of Tap-p15 to several repeat nucleoporins is evident (See also Fig. 2, E andF). This residual binding may result in nuclear rim localization observed in microinjected cells (see Fig. 2, Eand F). The observed lower on-rate of TapΔNLS-p15 to CAN4 FG-repeats in comparison to other tested FG-Nups is not understood at present. This could be due to a lower amount of immobilized GST-CAN4 on the sensor chip or may be a peculiarity of the CAN4 FG-repeat construct. In summary, p15 decreases the affinity of Tap to nucleoporin repeats about 1,000-fold. These data indicate that p15 functions to modulate the interaction of Tap with FG-repeat nucleoporins by making this association more transient. Previous work has revealed that p15 is required for nuclear mRNA export (see Introduction). Here, we report a biochemical function for p15. Our data show that binding of p15 to Tap affects the affinity of the Tap-p15 complex to nucleoporin repeats. This enables the Tap-p15 complex to shuttle between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. How could p15 perform its function to modulate the binding of Tap-p15 to repeat nucleoporins? Interestingly, the middle domain of Tap, which binds to p15, and p15 itself show homology to NTF2, which was shown to bind directly to FG-repeat nucleoporins (13Katahira J. Strasser K. Podtelejnikov A. Mann M. Jung J.U. Hurt E. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2593-2609Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar, 26Strasser K. Basler J. Hurt E. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 695-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 36Suyama M. Doerks T. Braun I.C. Sattler M. Izaurralde E. Bork P. EMBO Rep. 2000; 1: 53-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a Mex67p-Mtr2p complex that lacks the C-domain of Mex67p, is still able to bind to repeat nucleoporins (26Strasser K. Basler J. Hurt E. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 695-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). In accordance with these observations, recent structural data of the Tap-p15 heterodimer indicates that the middle domain of Tap acts synergistically with the C-terminal NPC-binding domain in binding to nucleoporin repeats as well as in shuttling (25Fribourg S. Braun I.C. Izaurralde E. Conti E. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 645-656Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). This analysis also showed that p15 contributes only indirectly to repeat binding of Tap, most likely by stabilizing the overall NTF2-like fold of the M-domain of Tap. These structural studies furthermore revealed a hydrophobic pocket in M-domain of Tap, which binds to a single phenylalanine residue of nucleoporin FG-repeats. Thus, the Tap-p15 heterodimer may move through the NPC by consecutive low affinity interactions with repeat nucleoporins. It is not clear whether Tap functions as a monomer in vivo. If so, the measured in vitro affinities of the Tap monomer could be meaningful. Accordingly, Tap with bound mRNP cargo could be first recruited to the nucleoplasmic side of the NPC due to its strong affinity to repeat nucleoporins. p15 would then associate to trigger the release of Tap from these high affinity binding sites due to an increased dissociation rate. If p15 stays permanently bound to Tap during pore passage, Tap-p15 would efficiently pass through the NPC channel by hopping between different repeat nucleoporins due to its comparably low affinities as suggested for transportin and NTF2 (10Stewart M. Baker R.P. Bayliss R. Clayton L. Grant R.P. Littlewood T. Matsuura Y. FEBS Lett. 2001; 498: 145-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Alternatively, multiple association/dissociation cycles of p15 and Tap may lead to their translocation through the pore channel. It is also conceivable that the cargo-loading state affects the directionality of Tap-p15 translocation, since binding of cellular mRNA may control the affinity of Tap to repeat nucleoporins. However, it is also possible that the Tap-p15 heterodimer is the only functionally relevant unit in nuclear mRNA export. Therefore, the observed high affinity binding of Tap to nucleoporins could be an in vitro artifact due to a misfolded Tap M-domain. The observation that co-expression of p15 with Tap is required for efficient export of mRNA (22Braun I.C. Herold A. Rode M. Conti E. Izaurralde E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20536-20543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 23Guzik B.W. Levesque L. Prasad S. Bor Y.C. Black B.E. Paschal B.M. Rekosh D. Hammarskjold M.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 2545-2554Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) supports this speculation. Further work is required to clarify whether a free pool of Tap functions in vivo in mRNA export. Our data support a model, in which binding of p15 to the middle domain of Tap affects the conformation and/or accessibility of the two shuttling/NPC-binding domains within Tap, thereby affecting Tap's association with and dissociation from repeat nucleoporins. Since the C-terminal repeat binding domain (aa 540–619) of Tap alone is able to mediate NPC translocation in vitro (35Schmitt I. Gerace L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42355-42363Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), it is likely that both the C-domain and the M-domain of Tap act in concert as NPC shuttling devices. The correct folding of the middle domain of Tap, which requires binding to p15, may affect the overall conformation of the Tap-p15 heterodimer and hence might be a prerequisite for efficient shuttling of this mRNA export factor through the nuclear pores. In summary, we have shown that p15 is a crucial co-factor of Tap that affects the interaction of Tap with repeat-containing nucleoporins. Thus, the Tap-p15 complex gains the capability to translocate efficiently through the NPC, which is the basis for export of mRNA from the nucleus to the cytoplasm.

Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1299: 125-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (1160) Google Scholar). Two cyclooxygenase isoforms, called cyclooxygenase 1 (COX-1)1 and cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2), are currently known. The COX-1 iosenzyme is constitutively expressed in many tissues and is assumed to be responsible for the physiological functions of prostaglandins (PG) such as maintenance of the integrity of gastric mucosa and regulation of renal blood flow (2Smith W.L.

In contrast, COX-2 is an immediate early response gene that is undetectable in most mammalian tissues, but is rapidly induced by proinflammatory cytokines, growth factors, and tumor promotors such as interleukin 1β (3Rzymkiewiecz D.

More recently, a new class of COX-2 specific inhibitors, such as NS-398 or SC-58635, has been characterized, which target cyclooxygenases more specifically and therefore may have specific treatment implications (10Hla T.

Many forms of glomerulonephritis are characterized by MC proliferation, and therefore understanding the mechanisms regulating this is critical in determining treatment strategies.Proliferation is governed at the level of the cell cycle by specific cell cycle regulatory proteins. Proliferation requires that cyclins activate target cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK). In contrast, the CDK inhibitors p21cip-1 and p27kip-1 limit proliferation by inhibiting cyclin-CDK complexes. Studies have shown a role for specific CDK inhibitors in renal and non-renal diseases. To further delineate the role of the COX-2 isoform in governing specific cell cycle proteins, we stably overexpressed COX-2 in mesangial cells derived from wild type rats and p21cip-1 null (−/−) mice or p27kip-1 null (−/−) mice. Our studies demonstrated that COX-2 overexpression inhibits PDGF-induced proliferation of wild type MC. Moreover, COX-2 overexpression increases the expression of the tumor suppressor p53 and the CDK inhibitors p21cip-1 and p27kip-1 in a prostaglandin-independent manner. COX-2 overexpression also increased p53 in p21−/− and p27−/− MCs. These data suggest that COX-2 inhibits the growth of MC by a novel mechanism, independent of prostaglandin synthesis, but involves p53 as well as the concerted action of p21cip-1 and p27kip-1.DISCUSSIONIn specific renal diseases such as glomerulonephritis, the formation of the cyclooxygenase product PGE2 is enhanced (23Lianos E.A.

Physiol. 1990; 259: F419-F424PubMed Google Scholar) and could therefore counteract the growth-promoting events following glomerular injury.To further characterize the role of COX-2 on mesangial cell growth, cell lines were generated that stably overexpress COX-2. Two independently isolated single clones overexpressing COX-2, named COX-2+ #1 and #2, were used in all the studies described. Both cell lines expressed large amounts of COX-2 protein and synthesize more PGE2 than control cells. COX-2 overexpression did not alter cell morphology nor expression for the cytoskeletal filament desmin (15Mene P. Abboud H.E. Dunn M.J. Kidney Int. 1990; 38: 232-239Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The COX-2+ cell line expressed about 10-fold more cell surface Thy1.1 than untransfected and mock-transfected MCs. Because the Thy1.1 expression served to identify our modified cells as true MCs we did not further examine this observation.The growth factor, PDGF-BB is a potent MC mitogen (4Abboud H.E. Kidney Int. 1992; 41: 581-583Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), and has also been shown to play a critical role in the pathogenesis of glomerulonephritis (27Okuda S. Languino L.R. Ruoslahti E. Border W.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1990; 86: 453-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar, 28Border W.A. Okuda S. Languino L.R. Ruoslahti E. Kidney Int. 1990; 37: 689-695Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Cell growth in wild type COX-2+ cells was significantly inhibited compared with mock-transfected wild type control cells. Our results show that COX-2 effects likely appear before the S-phase of the cell cycle, since [3H]thymidine incorporation into newly synthesized DNA was reduced. Events during the G1-phase may explain these differences. For example, the tumor suppressor p53 is able to inhibit cell growth by transactivation of the CDK inhibitor p21cip-1 gene transcription, which acts exclusively in the G1-phase of the cell cycle and can induce apoptosis in the G1-phase. Both mechanisms could account for the reduced [3H]thymidine incorporation. This mechanism may be operative because the reintroduction of p53 in p53-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts inhibits COX-2 gene expression (29Subbaramaiah K. Altorki N. Chung W.J. Mestre J.R. Sampa A. Dannenberg A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10911-10915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). Thus, a regulation loop between p53 and COX-2 might exist. In our independently isolated COX-2+ cell lines such a mechanism may be operative since p53 protein expression was enhanced and further increased after the PDGF-BB exposure.We next sought to clarify the effect of p21cip-1. In COX-2+ #1 and #2 cell lines, the mRNA and protein expression of p21cip-1 were also up-regulated, suggesting that p53-mediated up-regulation of p21cip-1 may be involved in the anti-proliferative effect in G1-phase. Apoptosis due to high p53 levels did not play a role, because we could cultivate single cell clones that stably overexpress COX-2 as well as p53 and both CDK inhibitors. This was not unexpected, since p21cip-1protects against p53-mediated apoptosis (30Gorospe M. Cirielli C. Wang X. Seth P. Capogrossi M.C. Holbrook N.J. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 929-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Moreover, COX-2 is a survival factor by suppressing caspase-3 activity (31McGinty A. Chang Y.W. Sorokin A. Bokemeyer D. Dunn M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12095-12101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) or inhibiting NO- and superoxide-mediated apoptosis (32Chang Y.W. Jakobi R. McGinty A. Foschi M. Dunn M.J. Sorokin A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8571-8579Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Thus, COX-2 might exclusively influence the growth suppressing properties of p53 in our cell system.The cip/kip CDK inhibitor p27kip-1 is also expressed in mesangial cells (33Shankland S.J. Pippin J. Flanagan M. Coats S.R. Nangaku M. Gordon K.L. Roberts J.M. Couser W.G. Johnson R.J. Kidney Int. 1997; 51: 1088-1099Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 34Wolf G. Schroeder R.

In contrast to p21cip-1, differences in the p27kip-1 expression between COX-2+ #1 and #2 and control cell lines were only detectable after 4 h of PDGF treatment, suggesting a different regulation of p21cip-1 and p27kip-1. These results imply that multiple events cooperate in the anti-proliferative effect of COX-2.In contrast, CDK-2 protein expression remained unaffected following COX-2 overexpression. Thus, it seems that COX-2 influences cell cycle indirectly through CDK inhibitors of the cip/kip family rather than directly through influencing protein expression of CDK-2.To confirm the potential interrelation between p21cip-1 and p27kip-1 in the blockade of PDGF-induced proliferation of COX-2, p21cip-1 (18Kim Y.G. Alpers C.E. Brugarolas J. Johnson R.J. Couser W.G. Shankland S.J. Kidney Int. 1999; 55: 2349-2361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), or p27kip-1 (19Hiromura K. Pippin J.W. Fero M.L. Roberts J.M. Shankland S.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 597-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar) null MCs, which overexpress COX-2 were established. Exposure of both COX-2+ knockout cell lines to PDGF resulted in a significant induction of proliferation. This suggests that both CDK inhibitors have to be expressed together to inhibit PDGF-induced proliferation. Moreover, the behavior of the COX-2+ CDK inhibitor knockout cell lines strongly argues against an artificial effect due to the overexpression of the COX-2 protein.Since prostaglandins are known to reduce MC proliferation (15Mene P. Abboud H.E. Dunn M.J. Kidney Int. 1990; 38: 232-239Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 16Stahl R.A.K. Thaiss F. Haberstroh U. Kahf S. Shaw A. Schoeppe W. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 259: F419-F424PubMed Google Scholar) it was expected that COX products are responsible for the anti-proliferative effect seen in this study. To examine the role of cyclooxygenase cells were either treated with indomethacin or NS-398 (9Laneuville O. Breuer D.K. DeWitt D.L. Hla T. Funk C.D. Smith W.L. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1994; 271: 927-934PubMed Google Scholar, 10Hla T. Ristimaki A. Appleby S. Barriocanal J.G. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1993; 696: 197-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Our results showed that when [3H]thymidine incorporation was measured in the presence of the cyclooxygenase inhibitors the proliferation of both independently isolated COX-2+ cells unexpectedly remained unaltered compared with untreated COX-2+ #1 and #2 cells. On the other hand, the protein expression of p53, p21cip-1 and p27kip-1, was partially reduced in the presence of the cyclooxygenase inhibitors in both COX-2+ cell lines; however, it remained significantly increased compared with control cells. Interestingly, Trifan et al. (37Trifan O.C. Smith R.M. Thompson B.D. Hla T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34141-34147Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) transiently overexpressed a COX-2-GFP chimeric protein in NIH 3T3 and COS-7 cells and showed cell cycle arrest, independent of cyclooxygenase inhibition. Moreover, COX-2 mutants devoid of cyclooxygenase activity exhibit the same effect as wild type COX-2.These results of Trifan et al. and now by our group suggest that COX-2 exerts its anti-proliferative effect independently of cyclooxygenase activity. Furthermore, because p53, p21cip-1, and p27kip-1 were partially attenuated by cyclooxygenase inhibitors, other factors such as the retinoblastoma protein and their related factors and/or the INK4 family of CDK inhibitors, might contribute to this complex COX-2 mediated inhibition of proliferation. Therefore the concerted action of multiple factors are necessary to induce the COX-2-dependent cell cycle arrest obviously partially independent of cyclooxygenase products. Finally, these data suggest the contribution of a novel COX-2 mechanism that does not require the formation of prostaglandins. The rate-limiting enzymes in the formation of prostaglandins are the cyclooxygenases (1Herschman H.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1299: 125-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (1160) Google Scholar). Two cyclooxygenase isoforms, called cyclooxygenase 1 (COX-1)1 and cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2), are currently known. The COX-1 iosenzyme is constitutively expressed in many tissues and is assumed to be responsible for the physiological functions of prostaglandins (PG) such as maintenance of the integrity of gastric mucosa and regulation of renal blood flow (2Smith W.L. Garvito R.M. DeWitt D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33157-33160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1835) Google Scholar). In contrast, COX-2 is an immediate early response gene that is undetectable in most mammalian tissues, but is rapidly induced by proinflammatory cytokines, growth factors, and tumor promotors such as interleukin 1β (3Rzymkiewiecz D. Leingang K. Baird N. Morrison A.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: F39-F45PubMed Google Scholar), PDGF (4Abboud H.E. Kidney Int. 1992; 41: 581-583Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), and phorbol myristate acetate (5Hla T. Neilson K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7384-7388Crossref PubMed Scopus (1478) Google Scholar, 6Rzymkiewiecz D. DuMaine J. Morrison A.R. Kidney Int. 1995; 47: 1354-1363Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The subcellular localization of COX-1 and COX-2 is similar. Both isoenzymes are present in the endoplasmic reticulum as well as the outer and inner membranes of the nuclear envelope (7Spencer A.G. Woods J.W. Arakawa T. Singer L.L. Smith W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9886-9893Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). Classical nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as indomethacin or aspirin inhibit both cyclooxygenases (8Smith W.L. DeWitt D.L. Dixon F.J. Advances in Immunology. 62. Academic Press, Orlando, FL1996: 167-215Google Scholar, 9Laneuville O. Breuer D.K. DeWitt D.L. Hla T. Funk C.D. Smith W.L. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1994; 271: 927-934PubMed Google Scholar). More recently, a new class of COX-2 specific inhibitors, such as NS-398 or SC-58635, has been characterized, which target cyclooxygenases more specifically and therefore may have specific treatment implications (10Hla T. Ristimaki A. Appleby S. Barriocanal J.G. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1993; 696: 197-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). COX-2 gene expression is increased in proliferative diseases such as cancer and rheumatoid arthritis (11Warner T.D. Guiliano F. Vojnovic I. Bukasa A. Mitchell J.A. Vane J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7563-7568Crossref PubMed Scopus (1410) Google Scholar, 12Dubois R.N. Abramson S.B. Crofford L. Gupta R.A. Simon L.S. Nan De Putte L.B. Lipsly P.E. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 1063-1073Crossref PubMed Scopus (2207) Google Scholar). Moreover, COX-2 stimulates the proliferation of cancer cells in colorectal and gastric cancer via prostanoids (11Warner T.D. Guiliano F. Vojnovic I. Bukasa A. Mitchell J.A. Vane J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7563-7568Crossref PubMed Scopus (1410) Google Scholar, 13Hla T. Bishop-Bailey D. Liu C.H. Schaefer H. Trifan O.C. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1999; 31: 551-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar), an effect that can be prevented by selectively inhibiting COX-2 (14Kawamori T. Rao C.V. Seibert K. Reddy B.S. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 409-412PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, PGE2 and prostacyclin exert anti-proliferative effects on rat mesangial cells (MC) (15Mene P. Abboud H.E. Dunn M.J. Kidney Int. 1990; 38: 232-239Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 16Stahl R.A.K. Thaiss F. Haberstroh U. Kahf S. Shaw A. Schoeppe W. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 259: F419-F424PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting an involvement of prostanoids in the complex growth regulation of resident glomerular cells. Many forms of glomerulonephritis are characterized by MC proliferation, and therefore understanding the mechanisms regulating this is critical in determining treatment strategies. Proliferation is governed at the level of the cell cycle by specific cell cycle regulatory proteins. Proliferation requires that cyclins activate target cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK). In contrast, the CDK inhibitors p21cip-1 and p27kip-1 limit proliferation by inhibiting cyclin-CDK complexes. Studies have shown a role for specific CDK inhibitors in renal and non-renal diseases. To further delineate the role of the COX-2 isoform in governing specific cell cycle proteins, we stably overexpressed COX-2 in mesangial cells derived from wild type rats and p21cip-1 null (−/−) mice or p27kip-1 null (−/−) mice. Our studies demonstrated that COX-2 overexpression inhibits PDGF-induced proliferation of wild type MC. Moreover, COX-2 overexpression increases the expression of the tumor suppressor p53 and the CDK inhibitors p21cip-1 and p27kip-1 in a prostaglandin-independent manner. COX-2 overexpression also increased p53 in p21−/− and p27−/− MCs. These data suggest that COX-2 inhibits the growth of MC by a novel mechanism, independent of prostaglandin synthesis, but involves p53 as well as the concerted action of p21cip-1 and p27kip-1.

To further characterize the role of COX-2 on mesangial cell growth, cell lines were generated that stably overexpress COX-2. Two independently isolated single clones overexpressing COX-2, named COX-2+ #1 and #2, were used in all the studies described. Both cell lines expressed large amounts of COX-2 protein and synthesize more PGE2 than control cells. COX-2 overexpression did not alter cell morphology nor expression for the cytoskeletal filament desmin (15Mene P. Abboud H.E. Dunn M.J. Kidney Int. 1990; 38: 232-239Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The COX-2+ cell line expressed about 10-fold more cell surface Thy1.1 than untransfected and mock-transfected MCs. Because the Thy1.1 expression served to identify our modified cells as true MCs we did not further examine this observation. The growth factor, PDGF-BB is a potent MC mitogen (4Abboud H.E. Kidney Int. 1992; 41: 581-583Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), and has also been shown to play a critical role in the pathogenesis of glomerulonephritis (27Okuda S. Languino L.R. Ruoslahti E. Border W.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1990; 86: 453-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar, 28Border W.A. Okuda S. Languino L.R. Ruoslahti E. Kidney Int. 1990; 37: 689-695Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Cell growth in wild type COX-2+ cells was significantly inhibited compared with mock-transfected wild type control cells. Our results show that COX-2 effects likely appear before the S-phase of the cell cycle, since [3H]thymidine incorporation into newly synthesized DNA was reduced. Events during the G1-phase may explain these differences. For example, the tumor suppressor p53 is able to inhibit cell growth by transactivation of the CDK inhibitor p21cip-1 gene transcription, which acts exclusively in the G1-phase of the cell cycle and can induce apoptosis in the G1-phase. Both mechanisms could account for the reduced [3H]thymidine incorporation. This mechanism may be operative because the reintroduction of p53 in p53-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts inhibits COX-2 gene expression (29Subbaramaiah K. Altorki N. Chung W.J. Mestre J.R. Sampa A. Dannenberg A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10911-10915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). Thus, a regulation loop between p53 and COX-2 might exist. In our independently isolated COX-2+ cell lines such a mechanism may be operative since p53 protein expression was enhanced and further increased after the PDGF-BB exposure. We next sought to clarify the effect of p21cip-1. In COX-2+ #1 and #2 cell lines, the mRNA and protein expression of p21cip-1 were also up-regulated, suggesting that p53-mediated up-regulation of p21cip-1 may be involved in the anti-proliferative effect in G1-phase. Apoptosis due to high p53 levels did not play a role, because we could cultivate single cell clones that stably overexpress COX-2 as well as p53 and both CDK inhibitors. This was not unexpected, since p21cip-1protects against p53-mediated apoptosis (30Gorospe M. Cirielli C. Wang X. Seth P. Capogrossi M.C. Holbrook N.J. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 929-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Moreover, COX-2 is a survival factor by suppressing caspase-3 activity (31McGinty A. Chang Y.W. Sorokin A. Bokemeyer D. Dunn M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12095-12101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) or inhibiting NO- and superoxide-mediated apoptosis (32Chang Y.W. Jakobi R. McGinty A. Foschi M. Dunn M.J. Sorokin A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8571-8579Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Thus, COX-2 might exclusively influence the growth suppressing properties of p53 in our cell system. The cip/kip CDK inhibitor p27kip-1 is also expressed in mesangial cells (33Shankland S.J. Pippin J. Flanagan M. Coats S.R. Nangaku M. Gordon K.L. Roberts J.M. Couser W.G. Johnson R.J. Kidney Int. 1997; 51: 1088-1099Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 34Wolf G.

Kidney Int. 1996; 50: 2112-2119Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In contrast to p21cip-1, differences in the p27kip-1 expression between COX-2+ #1 and #2 and control cell lines were only detectable after 4 h of PDGF treatment, suggesting a different regulation of p21cip-1 and p27kip-1. These results imply that multiple events cooperate in the anti-proliferative effect of COX-2. In contrast, CDK-2 protein expression remained unaffected following COX-2 overexpression. Thus, it seems that COX-2 influences cell cycle indirectly through CDK inhibitors of the cip/kip family rather than directly through influencing protein expression of CDK-2. To confirm the potential interrelation between p21cip-1 and p27kip-1 in the blockade of PDGF-induced proliferation of COX-2, p21cip-1 (18Kim Y.G. Alpers C.E. Brugarolas J. Johnson R.J. Couser W.G. Shankland S.J. Kidney Int. 1999; 55: 2349-2361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), or p27kip-1 (19Hiromura K. Pippin J.W. Fero M.L. Roberts J.M. Shankland S.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 597-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar) null MCs, which overexpress COX-2 were established. Exposure of both COX-2+ knockout cell lines to PDGF resulted in a significant induction of proliferation. This suggests that both CDK inhibitors have to be expressed together to inhibit PDGF-induced proliferation. Moreover, the behavior of the COX-2+ CDK inhibitor knockout cell lines strongly argues against an artificial effect due to the overexpression of the COX-2 protein. Since prostaglandins are known to reduce MC proliferation (15Mene P. Abboud H.E. Dunn M.J. Kidney Int. 1990; 38: 232-239Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 16Stahl R.A.K. Thaiss F. Haberstroh U. Kahf S. Shaw A. Schoeppe W. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 259: F419-F424PubMed Google Scholar) it was expected that COX products are responsible for the anti-proliferative effect seen in this study. To examine the role of cyclooxygenase cells were either treated with indomethacin or NS-398 (9Laneuville O. Breuer D.K. DeWitt D.L. Hla T. Funk C.D. Smith W.L. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1994; 271: 927-934PubMed Google Scholar, 10Hla T. Ristimaki A. Appleby S. Barriocanal J.G. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1993; 696: 197-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Our results showed that when [3H]thymidine incorporation was measured in the presence of the cyclooxygenase inhibitors the proliferation of both independently isolated COX-2+ cells unexpectedly remained unaltered compared with untreated COX-2+ #1 and #2 cells. On the other hand, the protein expression of p53, p21cip-1 and p27kip-1, was partially reduced in the presence of the cyclooxygenase inhibitors in both COX-2+ cell lines; however, it remained significantly increased compared with control cells. Interestingly, Trifan et al. (37Trifan O.C. Smith R.M. Thompson B.D. Hla T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34141-34147Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) transiently overexpressed a COX-2-GFP chimeric protein in NIH 3T3 and COS-7 cells and showed cell cycle arrest, independent of cyclooxygenase inhibition. Moreover, COX-2 mutants devoid of cyclooxygenase activity exhibit the same effect as wild type COX-2. These results of Trifan et al. and now by our group suggest that COX-2 exerts its anti-proliferative effect independently of cyclooxygenase activity. Furthermore, because p53, p21cip-1, and p27kip-1 were partially attenuated by cyclooxygenase inhibitors, other factors such as the retinoblastoma protein and their related factors and/or the INK4 family of CDK inhibitors, might contribute to this complex COX-2 mediated inhibition of proliferation. Therefore the concerted action of multiple factors are necessary to induce the COX-2-dependent cell cycle arrest obviously partially independent of cyclooxygenase products. Finally, these data suggest the contribution of a novel COX-2 mechanism that does not require the formation of prostaglandins.

Notch belongs to a family of conserved transmembrane receptors that influence a wide variety of cell fate decisions in organisms from worms to man (reviewed in Refs. 23Weinmaster G. Mol. Cell.

Notch signaling is activated by binding of the Delta-Serrate-Lag-2 family of ligands to the extracellular domain of Notch. Ligand binding is thought to activate two sequential proteolytic steps as follows: first on the extracellular domain (S2 cleavage) (25Brou C. Logeat F. Gupta N. Bessia C. LeBail O. Doedens J.R.

Although these studies reveal a requirement for PS1 or PS2 in the production of the NICD fragment, only a preliminary investigation of the Notch signaling pathway in PS1/2 null cells was presented. We sought to examine the effect of eliminating both PS homologues on Notch1 cleavage, nuclear localization and signaling in mammalian cells. We found that a deficiency in the genes for both PS1 andPS2 markedly reduced the quantity of Notch1 cleaved at the intramembranous site compared with control cells. In addition, membrane-tethered intracellular Notch proteins were precluded from the nucleus in PS1/2 null cells. Surprisingly, the lack of detectable cytoplasmic or nuclear NICD fragment led to only a partial reduction inHES1 activation by membrane-tethered intracellular Notch proteins or signaling elicited by Delta1 instead of the total impairment predicted by models in which either PS1 and 2 is strictly required for Notch signal transduction. PS1, PS2, or FAD-linked PS mutants restored PS1/2 null cells to wild type levels of Notch1 cleavage and HES1 activation indicating that PS genes contribute to a fraction of Notch signaling and that the FAD mutants tested are not markedly impaired with respect to promoting Notch signaling and cleavage. Additionally, a potent γ-secretase inhibitor (45Seiffert D. Bradley J.D. Rominger C.M. Rominger D.H Yang F. Meredith Jr., J.E. Wang Q. Roach A.H. Thompson L.A. Spitz S.M. Higaki J.N. Prakash S.R.

We also observed that PS1/2 null cells do not elicit UAS activation through a Notch1-Gal4-VP16 (Notch1ΔE-G4V16) fusion protein suggesting that no intramembranous cleavage occurs, similar to that seen for APP in PS null cells. However, HES1 signaling was observed with Nοtch1ΔE-G4V16, suggesting a site for the putative PS1/2-independent protease distal to the Notch1 transmembrane domain or another uncharacterized mechanism. In conclusion, these data provide evidence that both PS-independent and PS-dependent mechanisms play a role in Notch signal transduction and suggest that a novel mechanism supports Notch signal transduction when PS1 and -2 are absent. On embryonic day E3.5 blastocysts were flushed from wild type or PS1+/−,PS2+/−-intercrossed mice (4Donoviel D.B. Hadjantonakis A.K. Ikeda M. Zheng H. St. George-Hyslop P. Bernstein A.

Five days later the inner cell mass was removed, trypsinized, and plated onto new feeder cells. After 12 days the cells were replated onto gelatin-coated dishes, grown until confluent, and then maintained in embryonic stem cell media (high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 15% fetal bovine serum, 2 mml-glutamine, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, 1× non-essential amino acids, sodium pyruvate, recombinant leukemia-inhibitory factor (LIF)) on uncoated plates. For each cell line PCR genotyping was performed as described previously (3Wong P.C. Zheng H. Becher M.W. Sirinathsinghji D.J. Trumbauer M.E. Chen H.Y. Price D.L. Van der Ploeg L.H. Sisodia S.S.

PCR and RT-PCR were performed on immortalized primary cells grown for many generations without feeders. For RT-PCR, total RNA was prepared from immortalized primary cells (wild type and PS1/2 null) using TRIZOL Reagent (Invitrogen). mRNA (500 and 2000 ng for Fig. 1, B andC, respectively) was then used to perform RT-PCR with the Titanium One-step RT-PCR kit (CLONTECH). Primers specific for published murine PS1 sequence (PS1 exon 4, 5′-TGA GAG GCA GAG ACT TGA CAA C, and 5′-CGG GGA CAA AGA GCA TGA TGA; PS1, 5′-ACA CCC CAT TCA CAG AAG ACA A, and 5′-ATG GCA ATC ATC CCG ACC AC) and for published murine PS2 sequence (PS2 exon 5, 5′-TAT TCG TGC CTG TCA CGC TG, and 5′-GCA TCA GGG AGG ACA TGA TCA G; PS2, 5′ GCA ACG GAG ACT GGA ACA CTA C, and 5′-GGC AGA GCC TTC TTG AAC ACA G) were used. Mouse β-actin primers provided by the kit were used as a positive control. The PCR was done as indicated by the manufacturer with the following modifications, 30 cycles were performed with an annealing temperature of 58 °C. Notch1 contains the entire coding region of mouse Notch1 (37Nye S.J. Kopan R. Axel R. Development. 1994; 120: 2421-2430Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). NIC-myc (also known as Notch1IC) contains the entire intracellular domain of mNotch1 (amino acids 1744–2531) with a single amino-terminal Myc epitope (37Nye S.J. Kopan R. Axel R. Development. 1994; 120: 2421-2430Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). NICD-myc6 encodes the intracellular domain of mouse Notch1 terminating at amino acid 2185 (the XhoI site) with a carboxyl-terminal hexameric Myc tag (30Schroeter E.H. Kisslinger J.A. Kopan R.

HA-TMIC-myc contains the transmembrane and intracellular domains of mNotch1 with an amino-terminal hemagglutinin (HA) tag and a single Myc epitope tag inserted at the HindIII site (amino acid 2295) (27Kopan R. Turner D.L. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1996; 6: 594-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Notch1ΔE (also known as ΔE or TMIC-myc 6) contains the transmembrane and intracellular domains of mNotch1 terminating at amino acid 2185 (the XhoI site) with a hexameric Myc epitope at the carboxyl terminus (27Kopan R. Turner D.L. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1996; 6: 594-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). This construct has also been modified to replace a transmembrane domain methionine residue with valine (M1726V) to prevent intermediate translational initiations (27Kopan R. Turner D.L. Curr. Opin.

Notch1ΔE-G4VP16 is derived from the Notch1ΔE construct with an insertion of Gal4VP16 lacking an internal ATG after the transmembrane domain. Gal4 and Gal4VP16 were used as negative and positive controls, respectively, for the UAS-luc reporter (these three plasmids are kind gifts from Urban Lendhal, Johan Lundkvist, and Helena Karlstrom). hAPPswe is a kind gift from Robert Vassar. For RBP co-immunoprecipitation cells were plated at a density of 3 × 106 in 10-cm plates and transfected the following day with 15 μg of DNA (1:1:1 ratio between Notch, RPB3-FLAG and PS) using LipofectAMINE Plus (Invitrogen). The amount of DNA in each well was equalized by the addition of a control plasmid, pCDNA3. Cells were harvested 48 h after transfection, and immunoprecipitation studies were performed as described previously (20Berechid B.E. Thinakaran G. Wong P.C. Sisodia S.S. Nye J.S. Curr.

Bound antibodies were detected with a chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce). For Jagged1 cells were harvested in cold RIPA buffer containing protease inhibitors and lysates were subjected to centrifugation at 10,000 × gfor 10 min to remove cellular debris. Lysates were precleared by the addition of purified IgG1 (Sigma) followed by incubation with protein G beads (UltraLink, Pierce). Precleared lysates were then incubated with 2 μg of Jagged1 antibody (C20, Santa Cruz Biotechnologies) per 250 μg of protein at 4 °C for 16 h, and immune complexes were pulled down with protein G beads, after an additional 30 min incubation at 4 °C. Jagged1 expression was then determined using the same Jagged antibody. For Notch1 blots, a polyclonal antibody against a region encompassing the RAM domain and part of the ankyrin domain (NRC, amino acids 1820–1835) was used to detect Notch1 expression at a dilution of 1:2000 using 50 μg of protein. For β-galactosidase blots, a polyclonal antibody (Cappel) was used. For APP blots, 22C11 antibody (Chemicon) was used. Cells were transfected using LipofectAMINE Plus with 12 μg of Notch DNA per 10-cm plate. Twenty four hours post-transfection cells were harvested with trypsin (Invitrogen) and replated onto 4-well Permanox slides (Nalge Nunc International) at a density of 1 × 105 cells/well. The following day the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and stained with 9E10 antibody followed by fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse antibodies to detect expression of the Myc-tagged Notch constructs and Hoechst dye to detect nuclei. In a blinded manner, labeled cells were scored for nuclear or cytoplasmic localization of the Myc epitope. No Myc immunoreactivity was observed in the absence of transfected Myc-tagged Notch constructs. Cells were plated in 6-well dishes at a density of 4 × 105 and transfected the following day with LipofectAMINE Plus (Invitrogen). The amount of DNA (1.3 μg) in each well was equalized by the addition of a control plasmid, pCDNA3. Cells were harvested 48 h post-transfection, and luciferase activity was measured using a luminometer (Zylux). To ensure equivalent transfection between lines, a control reporter gene (thymidine kinase-Renilla luciferase; TK-luc, or Rous sarcoma virus-firefly luciferase; RSV-luc) was included with each experiment. Corrected luciferase activity was defined as the ratio of HES1-luc values divided by TK-luc values. For co-culture assays (49Jarriault S. Le Bail O. Hirsinger E. Pourquie O. Logeat F. Strong C.F.

Total RNA was prepared from primary cells using TRIZOL Reagent (Invitrogen). Poly(A) mRNA was isolated from total RNA using the Poly(A)Ttract mRNA Isolation System III (Promega). One μg of poly(A) mRNA was run on a 1.2% agarose gel containing 5 mm methylmercury hydroxide and was transferred to nylon by electroblotting. 32P-Labeled probes were prepared using the PrimeIt II kit (Stratagene). Hybridization was performed in Church buffer (1% bovine serum albumin, 7% SDS, 0.5m NaH2PO4, pH 7.0, 1 mmEDTA, 100 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA) at 65 °C for 16 h. cDNA for rat HES1 and HES5 were gifts from Ryoichiro Kageyama.

To evaluate the effect of PS deficiency on Notch1 signaling, we generated primary embryonic cell cultures from PS1/PS2 (PS1/2) double heterozygous intercrosses (Fig.1 A). PCR of genomic DNA from PS1/2 null cells revealed the predicted size products for the deleted exons and lacked visible amplification products from wild type PS1 or PS2 genomic sequences. To ensure that we had a pure population of PS1/2 null cells, we also performed RT-PCR on RNA from wild type and PS1/2 null cells (Fig. 1, B and C). In Fig.1 B, when primers specific for mouse PS1 exon 4 or mouse PS2 exon 5, the exons targeted in PS1 and PS2 knockout mice (3Wong P.C. Zheng H. Becher M.W. Sirinathsinghji D.J. Trumbauer M.E.

Here we have used Xenopus oocyte maturation as an indicator of microtubule function. We show that wild-type four-repeat Tau protein inhibits maturation in a concentration-dependent manner, whereas three-repeat Tau has no effect. Of the seven four-repeat Tau proteins with FTDP-17 mutations tested, five (G272V, ΔK280, P301L, P301S, and V337M) failed to interfere significantly with oocyte maturation, demonstrating a greatly reduced ability to interact with microtubules. One mutant protein (R406W) almost behaved like wild-type Tau, and one (S305N) inhibited maturation more strongly than wild-type Tau. With the exception of R406W, wild-type Tau and all the mutants studied were similarly phosphorylated during the Xenopus oocyte maturation, and this was independent of their effects on this process. Data obtained with R406W and S305N may be related to charge changes (phosphorylation and basic amino acids). Our results demonstrate variable effects of FTDP-17 mutations on microtubules in an intact cell situation. Those findings establish Xenopus oocyte maturation as a system allowing the study of the functional effects oftau gene mutations in a quantitative manner. tau gene mutations cause frontotemporal dementia and parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17 (FTDP-17).

Spillantini M.G. Jakes R. Rutherford D. Crowther R.A. Neuron. 1989; 3: 519-526Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1816) Google Scholar). They differ from each other by the presence or absence of 29- or 58-amino acid inserts located in the amino-terminal half and an additional 31-amino acid repeat located in the carboxyl-terminal half. Inclusion of the latter, which is encoded by exon 10, gives rise to the three isoforms with four repeats each; the other three isoforms have three repeats each. Similar levels of three-repeat (3R)1 and four-repeat (4R) Tau isoforms are found in normal cerebral cortex (4Goedert M. Jakes R. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 4225-4230Crossref PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar). These repeats constitute the microtubule-binding domains of Tau. They are made of imperfect 18-amino acids repeats separated by 13 or 14 amino acid inter-repeat (IR) regions (5Gustke N. Trinczek B. Biernat J. Mandelkow E.M. Mandelkow E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 9511-9522Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar, 6Panda D. Goode B.L. Feinstein S.C. Wilson L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11117-11127Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Interestingly peptides corresponding to the first repeat (R1) and the first inter-repeat region (R1-R2 IR) alone are sufficient to suppress microtubule dynamics in a manner that is qualitatively similar to full-length Tau (6Panda D. Goode B.L. Feinstein S.C. Wilson L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11117-11127Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Microtubule assembly also depends partially upon the phosphorylation state since phosphorylated Tau proteins are less effective than nonphosphorylated Tau proteins at promoting microtubule polymerization (for reviews, see Refs. 1Buée L.

Mutations that act at the RNA level affect the alternative mRNA splicing of exon 10 of the tau gene, leading to a change in the ratio of 3R to 4R Tau isoforms and resulting in an overproduction of 4R Tau.

However, the magnitude of the observed effects and the reported rank order of potency of individual mutations have been variable. Moreover, overexpression of mutant Tau in transfected cells has given inconsistent results as far as effects on microtubule binding and stability are concerned (17Dayanandan R. Van Slegtenhorst M.

Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 4093-4104Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Such studies are confounded by the problem that high expression of mutant Tau may override any effects that are present at more physiological levels.In view of these uncertainties, we have used a cell system, maturation of the Xenopus oocyte induced by progesterone, to study the effects of seven tau gene mutations (G272V, ΔK280, P301L, P301S, S305N, V337M, and R406W) on microtubule function. During maturation, there is a dramatic reorganization of the microtubule cytoskeleton that can be assessed indirectly by the presence of a white maturation spot at the animal pole and directly by the anchoring of the meiotic spindle in the plasma membrane. Besides being an indicator of microtubule function, this system also enables quantitative studies through microinjection of recombinant Tau proteins of known concentration.DISCUSSIONIt is important to understand the in vivo role of Tau protein to dissect mechanisms leading to neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease and other neurodegenerative disorders. Mutations in the tau gene have shown that dysfunction of Tau protein can cause neurodegeneration and dementia. In vitro studies demonstrated that missense and deletion mutations result in reduced function of Tau. However, in vivo effects have been more controversial. To avoid the variables inherent to transfection studies,X. laevis oocyte maturation was used to study the effects of Tau mutations on microtubule dynamics. Upon exposure to progesterone, oocytes undergo maturation, a process that involves a dramatic reorganization of microtubules, allowing for GVBD, translocation of the germinal vesicle, and anchoring of meiotic spindles at the plasma membrane of the animal pole. A known amount of Tau protein (wild type or mutant) was microinjected into the oocyte, and the biological effect on microtubules was assessed.Microinjection of wild-type 4R Tau into the oocyte perturbed the maturation process in a dose-dependent manner (from 0.6 to 4.7 μm), whereas 5 μm wild-type 3R Tau was without effect. Altogether these data suggest that there is a direct interaction between 4R Tau, but not 3R Tau, and microtubules. This is consistent with previous findings showing that four-repeat Tau has a higher affinity for microtubules than 3R Tau (4Goedert M. Jakes R. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 4225-4230Crossref PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar, 5Gustke N. Trinczek B. Biernat J. Mandelkow E.M. Mandelkow E.

Cell. 1997; 8: 353-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar).Regarding the functional effects of Tau mutants, three groups could be distinguished. The first includes mutations G272V, ΔK280, P301L, P301S, and V337M. These mutations allowed for normal oocyte maturation as visualized by the appearance of a white spot indicating that they failed to interact correctly with microtubules. Only the microinjection of high concentrations of mutant Tau led to abnormalities such as the formation of ectopic meiotic spindles. It was previously shown that these mutations cause a decreased ability of Tau to promote microtubule assembly in vitro, although there were discrepancies regarding their relative effects (11Hasegawa M. Smith M.J. Goedert M. FEBS Lett. 1998; 437: 207-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar, 12Hong M. Zhukareva V. Vogelsberg-Ragaglia V. Wszolek Z. Reed L. Miller B.I. Geschwind D.H. Bird T.D. McKeel D. Goate A. Morris J.C. Wilhelmsen K.C. Schellenberg G.D. Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M.-Y. Science. 1998; 282: 1914-1917Crossref PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar). In the present study, mutations G272V, P301L, P301S, and V337M allowed for normal maturation with only a few changes in the organization of meiotic spindles. A higher percentage of ectopic meiotic spindles was found in oocytes microinjected with the Tau ΔK280 mutant suggesting that this deletion mutation allows for better microtubule binding than the above missense mutations. Another explanation of the maturation inhibition could be related to differences in the degree of phosphorylation of wild-type and mutant Tau isoforms during oocyte maturation. However, wild-type 3R and 4R Tau were found to be phosphorylated to the same extent as the G272V, ΔK280, P301L, P301S, and V337M mutants. Thus, differential phosphorylation cannot explain the data obtained for the first group of Tau mutants. The data show that these mutations strongly reduce the ability of Tau to interact with microtubules.Two additional mutations (R406W and S305N) were studied, and they were found to perturb oocyte maturation; they make up the second and third groups, respectively. R406W mutant Tau showed less phosphorylation than the other Tau proteins studied. A loss of about 25% of AD2 and 12E8 immunoreactivities may explain the increased ability of 4R R406W Tau to inhibit maturation when compared with wild-type protein. Phosphorylation of sequences recognized by AD2 and 12E8 decreases Tau-microtubule interactions (30Biernat J. Gustke N. Drewes G. Mandelkow E.M. Mandelkow E. Neuron. 1993; 11: 153-163Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (642) Google Scholar, 31Utton M.A. Vandecandelaere A. Wagner U. Reynolds C.H. Gibb G.M. Miller C.C. Bayley P.M. Anderton B.H. Biochem.

Biernat J. von Bergen M. Mandelkow E. Mandelkow E.M. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 3549-3558Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). A 50% loss of phosphorylation was observed for 3R R406W that was not sufficient to perturb oocyte maturation. This is not surprising since wild-type 3R Tau did not perturb oocyte maturation and since in vitro studies have indicated that 3R R406W Tau has a weak effect on tubulin polymerization (11Hasegawa M. Smith M.J. Goedert M. FEBS Lett. 1998; 437: 207-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). One hypothesis can be raised to explain the effects of 4R R406W Tau. With injections of low amounts of 4R wild-type Tau, the protein is phosphorylated but does not interact sufficiently with microtubules to allow perturbation of oocyte maturation. Conversely 4R R406W mutant Tau is less phosphorylated allowing for a better binding to microtubules than wild-type Tau and thus perturbation of oocyte maturation. At the highest Tau concentration, the effect of the R406W mutation on microtubule binding may override the effect on phosphorylation. As a result, wild-type 4R Tau perturbs the maturation process more than the R406W mutant Tau. Altogether these data suggest that this mutation has a weak effect on microtubule interactions in agreement with in vitro findings (11Hasegawa M. Smith M.J. Goedert M. FEBS Lett. 1998; 437: 207-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). They are also consistent with the fact that it causes late onset of disease when compared with other FTDP-17 mutations (for review, see Ref. 34Heutink P. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 979-986Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). However, the R406W mutation may have other effects, including increased fibrillogenesis, increased proteolysis susceptibility, and differences in protein phosphatase 2A and glycogen synthase kinase 3 binding (35Nacharaju P.

FEBS Lett. 2001; 493: 40-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar).The most pronounced inhibitory effect on oocyte maturation was observed with S305N Tau, even following microinjection of small amounts of Tau protein. This effect was independent of phosphorylation of the five epitopes studied here. The mutation changes the last amino acid of exon 10 and is one of the exonic mutations that modify the ratio of 3R and 4R Tau isoforms, resulting in the overexpression of 4R Tau (for reviews, see Refs. 1Buée L. Bussière T. Buée-Scherrer V. Delacourte A. Hof P.R. Brain Res. Rev. 2000; 33: 95-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (1522) Google Scholar and 2Lee V.M.-Y. Goedert M. Trojanowski J.Q. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 24: 1121-1159Crossref PubMed Scopus (2098) Google Scholar). The S305N mutation improves the binding of U1 small nuclear RNA and destabilizes a stem loop structure located at the boundary between exon 10 and the following intron (39Varani L. Hasegawa M. Spillantini M.G. Smith M.J. Murrell J.R. Ghetti B. Klug A. Goedert M. Varani L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8229-8234Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). This mutation leads to exon 10 being preferentially spliced and no longer subject to regulation (10Hasegawa M. Smith M.J. Iijima M. Tabira T. Goedert M.

Neurosci. 2001; 18: 80-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). It was previously shown that S305N Tau has a slightly increased ability to promote microtubule assembly in vitro when compared with wild-type protein (10Hasegawa M. Smith M.J. Iijima M. Tabira T. Goedert M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 443: 93-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). The present findings are consistent with these observations. However, the magnitude of the effect was greater in the Xenopusoocyte. This may be explained by phosphorylation of wild-type Tau at Ser-305 (42Drewes G. Trinczek B. Illenberger S. Biernat J.

Neurochem. 2000; 74: 1587-1595Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). The S305N mutation abolishes this phosphorylation, and it may increase the ability of the mutant to bind microtubules. In fact, at the level of microtubules, the S305N mutation behaves in an opposite manner to other missense mutations. It remains to be seen whether this contributes to the clinical and neuropathological picture.The present study indicates that in vivo Tau missense mutations either strongly reduce interactions with microtubules or increase these interactions. It also demonstrates that theXenopus oocyte is an interesting model system for following perturbations in microtubule function. A variety of sporadic and familial neurodegenerative disorders, characterized clinically by dementia and/or motor dysfunction, demonstrate intracellular accumulations of filamentous material composed of the microtubule-associated protein Tau (1Buée L.

Neurosci. 2001; 24: 1121-1159Crossref PubMed Scopus (2098) Google Scholar). Six Tau isoforms are produced in the adult human brain by alternative mRNA splicing from a single gene (3Goedert M. Spillantini M.G. Jakes R. Rutherford D. Crowther R.A. Neuron. 1989; 3: 519-526Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1816) Google Scholar). They differ from each other by the presence or absence of 29- or 58-amino acid inserts located in the amino-terminal half and an additional 31-amino acid repeat located in the carboxyl-terminal half. Inclusion of the latter, which is encoded by exon 10, gives rise to the three isoforms with four repeats each; the other three isoforms have three repeats each. Similar levels of three-repeat (3R)1 and four-repeat (4R) Tau isoforms are found in normal cerebral cortex (4Goedert M. Jakes R. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 4225-4230Crossref PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar). These repeats constitute the microtubule-binding domains of Tau. They are made of imperfect 18-amino acids repeats separated by 13 or 14 amino acid inter-repeat (IR) regions (5Gustke N. Trinczek B. Biernat J. Mandelkow E.M. Mandelkow E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 9511-9522Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar, 6Panda D. Goode B.L. Feinstein S.C. Wilson L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11117-11127Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Interestingly peptides corresponding to the first repeat (R1) and the first inter-repeat region (R1-R2 IR) alone are sufficient to suppress microtubule dynamics in a manner that is qualitatively similar to full-length Tau (6Panda D. Goode B.L. Feinstein S.C. Wilson L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11117-11127Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Microtubule assembly also depends partially upon the phosphorylation state since phosphorylated Tau proteins are less effective than nonphosphorylated Tau proteins at promoting microtubule polymerization (for reviews, see Refs. 1Buée L. Bussière T. Buée-Scherrer V. Delacourte A. Hof P.R. Brain Res. Rev. 2000; 33: 95-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (1522) Google Scholar and 2Lee V.M.-Y. Goedert M. Trojanowski J.Q. Annu. Rev.

In Alzheimer's disease, Pick's disease, progressive supranuclear palsy, and corticobasal degeneration, abnormally phosphorylated Tau proteins aggregate into filaments. The discovery of tau gene mutations in familial frontotemporal dementia and parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17 (FTDP-17) has shown that dysfunction of Tau protein can cause neurodegeneration and dementia (7Poorkaj P.

We recently demonstrated that in human vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) uPA/uPAR are functionally associated with the ectoprotein kinase casein kinase-2 (CK2). We now asked whether CK2 regulates uPA-dependent cell adhesion to Vn, since the latter is a natural CK2 substrate. We found that Vn is indeed selectively phosphorylated by CK2 and that this phosphorylation is uPA-regulated in VSMC. Vn induces release of ecto-CK2 from the cell surface via a process termed as “shedding.” CK2-mediated Vn phosphorylation was decisive for the uPA-dependent VSMC adhesion. Specific inhibition of CK2 completely abolished the uPA-induced cell adhesion to Vn. This effect was specific for cell adhesion to Vn and required participation of both uPAR and αvβ3 integrins as adhesion receptors. CK2 localization at the cell surface was highly dynamic; Vn induced formation of clusters where CK2 colocalized with uPAR and αvβ3 integrins. These results indicate that the uPA-dependent VSMC adhesion is a function of selective Vn phosphorylation by the ectoprotein kinase CK2 and suggest a regulatory role for Vn phosphorylation in the uPA-directed adhesive process.

Acta Pathol. Microbiol. Scand. 1999; 107: 96-101Crossref Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Several reports suggest a possible role for uPA/uPAR in these processes independent of the uPA enzymatic activity. For instance, uPAR has a non-proteolytic action as a cellular adhesion receptor for vitronectin (Vn). Vn is a multifunctional glycoprotein present in blood, extracellular matrix, inflammatory sites, and in atherosclerotic plaques (2Chapman H.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 714-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). UPAR contains a high affinity Vn-binding site, which is different from the uPA-binding site. This binding site makes uPAR uniquely poised to regulate extracellular proteolysis and the adhesion process (3Wei Y. Waltz D.A. Rao N. Drummond R.J. Rosenberg S. Chapman H.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32380-32388Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Vn has been shown to contain consensus sequences for phosphorylation by various protein kinases, such as cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA), protein kinase C (PKC) and, and as recently described, the protein kinase casein kinase-2 (CK2) (4Schvartz I. Seger D. Shaltiel S. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1999; 31: 539-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Vn can be phosphorylated at specific sites that modulate its conformation and influences its subsequent functions (5Gechtman Z. Shaltiel S. Eur. J.

However, whether or not Vn phosphorylation plays any direct role in the uPA-directed cell adhesion has not been explored. We recently demonstrated that in human vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC), the cell surface CK2 is associated with uPAR and might be activated by uPA. Activated CK2 mediates phosphorylation of the cell-surface shuttle protein nucleolin, which translocates then in its phosphorylated form into the cell and regulates mitogenic effects of uPA (8Dumler I.

However, ectoprotein kinases operating on numerous cell types can provide for the phosphorylation of both cell surface proteins and extracellular substrates and are required for the regulation of cell-cell communication, cell-matrix interactions, and signal transduction (9Redegeld F.A. Caldwell C.C. Sitkovsky M.V. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1999; 20: 459-465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Moreover, ectoprotein kinases can be set free from the intact cell in a process termed “shedding”. Thus, ectoprotein kinases may play a role in cell-environment interactions over some distances (10Kübler D. Pyerin W. Burow E. Kinzel V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 4021-4025Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). CK2 is an ectoprotein kinase that phosphorylates numerous proteins including endogenous cell surface proteins and soluble protein substrates in the extracellular environment (11Pinna L.A. Meggio F. Prog. Cell Cycle Res. 1997; 3: 77-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar, 12Guerra B. Issinger O.G. Electrophoresis. 1999; 2: 391-408Crossref Scopus (363) Google Scholar). One natural CK2 substrate beyond nucleolin is Vn (7Seger D. Gechtman Z. Shaltiel S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24805-24813Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The purpose of our study was to investigate the probable versatile function of ecto-CK2 in propagation of the uPA/uPAR-related events, in particular to clarify the physiological importance of Vn phosphorylation by CK2 for the uPA-dependent cell adhesion. We found that in human VSMC Vn-selective CK2-mediated phosphorylation determines the outcome of Vn-cell interactions that are highly important for the uPA-induced adhesion process.

The cells were grown in SmGM2 medium (Clonetics) supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum and were used in passage 7. For the uPA stimulation experiments, cells were cultured for 24 h in serum-free medium and were then treated with uPA as previously described (8Dumler I. Stepanova V. Jerke U. Mayboroda O.A. Vogel F. Bouvet P. Tkachuk V. Haller H. Gulba D.C. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 1468-1476Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The substrate-induced release of ecto-CK2 from intact cells into the supernatant and determination of its activity through the phosphorylation of exogenous protein substrate phosvitin was carried out as described elsewhere (10Kübler D. Pyerin W. Burow E. Kinzel V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 4021-4025Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Briefly, subconfluent VSMC were washed once with shedding buffer (150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris, 20 mmNaH2PO4/Na2HPO4, 5 mm MgSO4, 0.5 mm EDTA, pH 7.4) prior to the incubation with the same solution containing 1 mg/ml phosvitin. After 10 min of incubation at 37 °C the postcellular supernatants were subjected to in vitro kinase assay. Aliquots of 100 μl of the cell supernatant were used and 10 μCi either [γ−32P]ATP or [γ−32P]GTP was added to start the phosphorylation reaction for 10 min at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped by addition of 1 ml ice-cold 20% trichloroacetic acid, the pellets were dissolved in 100 μl of 1 m NaOH, and the incorporated radioactivity was determined by scintillation counting. For Vn-induced CK2 shedding, VSMC were treated as described above with shedding buffer containing Vn (or, as a control, fibronectin or collagen) instead of phosvitin in a final concentration of 35 μg/ml. After incubation for 10 min, the supernatant was removed from each well to separate tubes, and phosphorylation reaction was started by addition of 10 μCi of [γ−32P]ATP. The reaction was stopped after 10 min of incubation at 37 °C, and samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. For the inhibitory studies, the supernatants were preincubated with antibodies (0.1 mg/ml) or different inhibitors (1 μm PKI-α, 100 nmGö6976, 1 mm DRB, 10 μm K252b) for 30 min at room temperature before the phosphorylation reaction was started. For dephosphorylation of Vn, alkaline phosphatase beads (AP-beads, 15 units) were washed once with reaction buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mm MgCl2), blocked with 1% BSA at 4 °C for 2 h, and then washed three times with reaction buffer to remove the access of BSA. AP-beads were incubated with 50 μg of Vn in 50 μl of prewarmed reaction buffer at 30 °C in the thermomixer for 30 min. AP-beads were removed by centrifugation, and supernatant with dephosphorylated Vn was aliquoted and frozen at −70 °C. To obtain fully phosphorylated Vn, 20 μg of dephosphorylated Vn was incubated at 37 °C for 2 h in reaction buffer containing 10 μm cold ATP, 1.5 mm MgCl2, and 0.4 mm NaVO3 in the presence of 1.5 μg of CK2 (purified from rabbit liver). For in vitro phosphorylation experiments 20 μg of dephosphorylated Vn was incubated at 37 °C in reaction buffer containing 10 μm[γ−32P]ATP (0.12 mCi, specific radioactivity 6000 Ci/mmol), 1.5 mm MgCl2, and 0.4 mmNaVO3 in the presence of 1.5 μg of purified rabbit liver CK2 in a reaction volume of 80 μl. At different time points up to 2 h 12 μl were taken, and reactions were stopped by addition of SDS sample buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE. Gels were Coomassie Blue-stained, and dry gels were exposed on storage phosphor screen for autoradiography. The quantification of phosphate incorporation was done on a PhosphorImager Storm 860 and Image Quant (Molecular Dynamics), or radioactive Vn bands were excised from dried gel and counted in a scintillation counter. Protein concentration was determined by densitometry of Coomassie Blue-stained gels. 96-well plates were coated with Vn, fibronectin, or collagen at a concentration of 0.35 μg/ml for 1 h at 37 °C and then blocked with 3% BSA for 30 min at 37 °C. Some wells were incubated in parallel only with 3% BSA and served as background. VSMC were harvested using 5 mm EDTA in phosphate-buffered saline, washed, and resuspended in serum-free medium. Cell suspensions (1.5 × 104 cells/100 μl) were added to each coated or uncoated well for 2.5 h at 37 °C. For inhibitory studies, cells were preincubated with antibodies (50 μg/ml), soluble uPAR (60 nm), peptides (2 mmCK2 substrate peptide, 100 μm a325 peptide, 100 μm random peptide), or inhibitors (44 nmheparin, 1 μm PKI−α, 100 nm Gö6976) for 30 min at 37 °C before uPA in a final concentration of 25 nm was added. At the end of incubation period, wells were rinsed once with phosphate-buffered saline, and the adhered cells were treated with 50 μl of hexoseamidase reagent (15 mm p-nitrophenylN-acetyl-β-d-glucosaminide, 0.5% Triton X-100, 100 mm natrium-citrate buffer, pH 5.0) for 40 min at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped by addition of 100 μl of 0.2m NaOH in H2O containing 5 mm EDTA, and the absorbance was measured at 405 nm. All experiments were performed in triplicate. Immunofluorescent staining for CK2, uPAR, and αvβ3 integrin using Alexa-488- and Cy3-conjugated secondary antibodies and confocal microscopy studies were performed as previously described (14Dumler I. Weis A. Mayboroda O.A. Maasch C. Jerke U. Haller H. Gulba D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 315-321Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). The degree of protein colocalization was quantified using the Laser Sharp 3.2 and NIH Image 1.62 confocal software. To ascertain the existence of CK2 as an ectoprotein kinase at the surface of VSMC, we used the method of the substrate-induced release or shedding of ectoprotein kinase. Since CK2 has the unique property of accepting both ATP and GTP as phosphate donors, we examined phosphorylation of the specific CK2 substrate peptide by shed kinase in the presence of both donors. As shown in Fig. 1 a, phosvitin, the substrate used to initiate CK2 shedding, promptly released kinase activity from the intact VSMC. The extent of the phosphorylation was almost the same when [γ−32P]ATP and [γ−32P]GTP were used as co-substrates, indicating that the released ectokinase was CK2-like. To more thoroughly address this conclusion, additional controls were performed. Thus, we used anti-CK2 specific antibody to show by immunoblotting that the shed enzyme was CK2 (shown as inset in Fig. 1 a). Furthermore, we used specific CK2 inhibitors such as DRB and heparin. Both compounds inhibited the phosvitin-released ectokinase activity (Fig. 1 b). We next examined the ability of ecto-CK2 to be shed by and phosphorylate Vn. VSMC were washed and incubated with or without Vn for 10 min. After removal of the cells, CK2 activity and Vn phosphorylation in the supernatants were assayed by adding [γ−32P]ATP. In all Vn phosphorylation experiments, the equal protein loading on the gel was confirmed by Coomassie staining (shown in lower panels). Preincubation with Vn resulted in the release of an ectokinase that phosphorylates Vn (Fig. 1 c). No CK2 shedding and Vn phosphorylation was observed when VSMC were preincubated with shedding buffer alone (control lane). Since Vn might serve as a substrate for several protein kinases (4Schvartz I. Seger D. Shaltiel S. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1999; 31: 539-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar), the specificity of Vn phosphorylation was verified by checking different inhibitors for their ability to block Vn phosphorylation. The results shown in Fig.1 c (right upper panel) demonstrate that neither the PKA inhibitor PKI-α nor the PKC inhibitor Gö6976 affected the level of Vn phosphorylation. Instead, the CK2-specific inhibitors DRB and K252b completely abolished the Vn phosphorylation. These results strongly suggest that the enzyme specifically shed by Vn and phosphorylating Vn is CK2. CK2 was shown to be required for basal spreading and adhesion on Vn of several cell lines (7Seger D. Gechtman Z. Shaltiel S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24805-24813Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 15Seger D. Seger R. Shaltiel S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16998-17006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). To elucidate the probable requirement of ecto-CK2 for the uPA-directed VSMC adhesion on Vn, several sets of experiments were performed. First, to characterize the adhesion process and to check the specificity of the uPA-induced VSMC adhesion on Vn, different extracellular matrices were used in the adhesion assay. As shown in Fig.2 a, uPA activated cell adhesion on Vn up to 3-fold. The basal cell adhesion corresponded in our experiments to 25–35% of adhered cells and increased after stimulation with uPA up to 50–80% of adhered cells. No uPA-directed cell adhesion was observed when fibronectin or collagen was used. These data are in a good agreement with the results of our experiments on CK2 shedding, demonstrating that CK2 was released from the cell surface exclusively in response to Vn and not to other matrix proteins, such as fibronectin and collagen (Fig. 2 b). Thus, CK2 appears to be linked specifically to the uPA-induced VSMC adhesion on Vn. Next, we examined the effects of anti-CK2 antibody and the specific CK2 inhibitors, such as CK2 substrate peptide and heparin, on the basal and uPA-related VSMC adhesion on Vn. Anti-CK2 antibody specifically blocked the uPA-induced VSMC adhesion (Fig. 2 c), whereas the basal adhesion remained at the same level. The CK2 inhibitors, heparin and CK2 substrate peptide, completely blocked the adhesive effects of uPA; however, they did not change the basal level of cell adhesion. Both the PKA- and PKC-specific inhibitors, PKI-α and Gö6976, were ineffective. Further evidence indicating that CK2 is necessary for the uPA-mediated cell attachment was obtained in experiments where ecto-CK2 was removed from the cell surface by phosvitin treatment. After phosvitin-induced shedding, VSMC were washed and used for the adhesion assay. The results demonstrate very clearly that CK2 removal from the cell surface almost completely abrogated the uPA-mediated adhesion process (Fig. 2 d). Thus, CK2 selectively mediates the uPA-directed VSMC adhesion on Vn. We recently demonstrated that uPA can activate cell surface-associated CK2 in VSMC (8Dumler I. Stepanova V. Jerke U. Mayboroda O.A. Vogel F. Bouvet P. Tkachuk V. Haller H. Gulba D.C. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 1468-1476Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). To address the question whether this regulation might have relevance for Vn phosphorylation, VSMC were stimulated with different concentrations of uPA. Vn phosphorylation was monitored as described above. Representative results of these experiments are shown in Fig.3 a, upper panel. Already 1 nm of uPA increased 2-fold Vn phosphorylation by shed kinase within 10 min of VSMC stimulation. At higher uPA concentrations this stimulation decreased gradually. The equal protein loading on the gel was confirmed by Coomassie staining (shown inlower panels). In special control experiments it was shown that uPA by itself did not induce any CK2 release (data not shown). To assess the importance of the ecto-CK2-mediated Vn phosphorylation to the uPA-related adhesion process, we used Vn in its dephosphorylated and phosphorylated form after subjection to dephosphorylation and phosphorylation in vitro. Cytosolic CK2 purified from rabbit liver was used for the Vn phosphorylation (see “Experimental Procedures” for details). The monitored incorporation of32P in dephosphorylated Vn occurred with a stoichiometry of 0.29 mol of phosphate per mol of Vn (shown as inset in Fig.3 b); the same value was determined for fully phosphorylated Vn by others (7Seger D. Gechtman Z. Shaltiel S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24805-24813Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The use of dephosphorylated Vn resulted in an increase in the uPA-induced VSMC adhesion (Fig. 3 b). However, no promotion of cell adhesion in response to uPA was observed when Vn phosphorylated in vitro by CK2 purified from rabbit liver was used, although the basal adhesion was increased when compared with basal adhesion on dephosphorylated Vn (Fig. 3 b). These results indicate that Vn phosphorylation exclusively by native cell surface-located CK2 is required for the uPA-directed VSMC adhesion. CK2 may have different functions depending on its subcellular compartmentalization (16Faust M. Montenarch M. Cell Tissue Res. 2000; 301: 329-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Moreover, the subcellular localization of CK2 appears to be tightly regulated. Therefore, we next sought to investigate the effect of adhesion process on the cell surface CK2 distribution. We relied on fluorescence microscopy as shown in Fig.4 a. Ecto-CK2 underwent displacement on the VSMC surface and formed CK2-enriched clusters when cells were adhered on Vn. In contrast, in VSMC adhering to other matrixes CK2 remained randomly distributed over the entire VSMC body. Formation of organized adhesive clusters is one of important steps in cell motility that provides functional interaction of different receptors and signaling molecules involved in adhesion process. Redistribution of CK2 on the surface of VSMC upon adhesion on Vn implied its association with other participants involved in regulation of cell adhesion. It has been demonstrated that the uPA-directed adhesion of smooth muscle cells is mediated by uPAR (17Chang A.W. Kuo A. Barnathan E.S. Okada S.S. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1998; 18: 1855-1860Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The recent findings of others additionally suggest that motility of these cells requires association between uPAR and Vn receptor ανβ3 integrin (18Degryse B. Orlando S. Resnati M. Rabbani S.A. Blasi F. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 2032-2043Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). To test whether these adhesive receptors were connected with the CK2-mediated uPA-directed VSMC adhesion on Vn observed in our experiments, uPAR- and ανβ3 integrin-directed agents were used. The results of these experiments are shown in Fig. 4 b. VSMC treatment with soluble uPAR competing with cell surface uPAR for the uPA binding resulted in abrogation of the uPA-induced cell adhesion on Vn thus confirming the requirement of uPAR for adhesion process. RGD peptide, which blocks Vn binding to its integrin receptor, inhibited VSMC adhesion in response to uPA; however, to a lesser extent than soluble uPAR. To further define the role of supposed association between both adhesive receptors in augmenting VSMC adhesion to Vn the physical association between integrins and uPAR was modulated. For this purpose, the integrin critical binding site for uPAR (residues 424–440) was imitated by a homology peptide, a325. As a control in these experiments, unspecific random peptide (HQLP) was used. In the presence of a325 peptide, the uPA-induced cell adhesion was blocked, whereas control peptide was ineffective. These data essentially confirm the necessity of both uPAR and integrin for mediating the uPA-directed VSMC adhesion on Vn and suggest that the interaction between these adhesive receptors is critical for the adhesion process. To examine the supposed association of CK2 with uPAR and ανβ3 integrin on VSMC surface, double immunostaining for cell surface CK2, uPAR, and ανβ3 integrin was performed. Τhe dynamics of protein redistribution on the cell surface was monitored up to 3 h by recording at 15-min intervals. For this purpose we used laser scanning confocal microscopy. The confocal images in Figs.5 and 6 show that already after 1 h of cell adhesion on Vn, diffuse spots of ecto-CK2 were observed (a). After another hour of adhesion the CK2 clusters were well formed (d). Over a 3-h adhesion period, VSMC displayed clear clusters of CK2 restricted to discrete compartments of the cell surface (g). At this time point, uPAR (Fig. 5) and ανβ3 integrin (Fig.6) were reliably associated with CK2 clusters; both proteins displayed a high level of colocalization (i, i′). However, the uPAR and ανβ3 integrin redistribution appeared to be driven by the CK2 clustering and required newly formed CK2 clusters. Thus, within the first 2 h of VSMC adhesion on Vn, uPAR and ανβ3 integrin were found to be diffusely distributed on the cell surface (b, e) and displayed mainly a punctate pattern of colocalization with CK2 (c, c′, f, f′).Figure 6CK2 and α ν β3integrin colocalize in dynamic cell surface clusters upon VSMC adhesion. VSMC were seeded on Vn-coated coverslips, fixed after 1 h (a–c), 2 h (d–f), or 3 h (g–i), and stained for CK2 using anti-CK2 polyclonal antibody and Cy3-coupled secondary antibody and for ανβ3 integrin using monoclonal integrin anti-human CD61 antibody and Alexa-488-coupled secondary antibody.Third column (c, f, i), superimposed composite figures of CK2 (a, d,g) and ανβ3 integrin (b, e, h) from the first and the second columns.

Our study has three major findings. First, uPA induces specific phosphorylation of Vn by ecto-CK2. Second, Vn-specific phosphorylation by ecto-CK2 is required for the uPA-related VSMC adhesion. Third, CK2 localization at the cell surface is highly dynamic. When VSMC are exposed to Vn, CK2 forms clusters where it colocalizes with uPAR and ανβ3 integrin. Our data indicate that the uPA-induced selective phosphorylation of Vn by cell surface CK2 is a pivotal event in VSMC adhesion and motility. The recent identification of ectoprotein kinases with catalytic properties on the cell surface shed new light on the potential role of extracellular phosphorylation for numerous physiological and pathological processes. Ectoprotein kinases represent the powerful regulatory machinery of protein phosphorylation operating at the cell surface and are critical for intercellular communication and transduction of external stimuli. Remarkably, several cell types were shown to shed ectoprotein kinases from their surface in a substrate-induced fashion (19Walter J. Schnölzer M. Pyerin W. Kinzel V. Kübler D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 111-119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Shedding of ectokinases, as a specific and immediate cell response to protein substrate, might have a broad role in regulating cell-environment interactions. The stimuli initiating such responses may include cell surface adhesion molecules, growth and coagulation factors, enzymes, and receptors. Although this field of investigation is young, a growing body of evidence suggests that ectoprotein and ectodomain shedding is one widely used mechanism that contributes to various pathophysiological events. These events include host defense, wound healing, arthritis, and Alzheimer's disease (20Kiessling I.I. Gordon E.J. Chem. Biol. 1998; 5: R49-R62Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 21Hooper N.M. Turner A.J. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1999; 27: 211-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar, 22Merlos-Suarez A. Arribas J. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1999; 27: 243-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). However, an understanding of the underlying molecular mechanisms remains largely unknown. CK2-like protein kinases have been reported to be secreted by activated platelets, neutrophils, and endothelial cells in response to various stimuli (23Hartmann M. Schrader J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1136: 189-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Furthermore, circulating blood proteins, such as coagulation factors and fibrinogen, were shown to serve as substrates for the platelet-released CK2 (24Martin S.C. Bjork I. FEBS Lett. 1990; 272: 103-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The results of our study clearly demonstrate specific ecto-CK2 release from intact human VSMC in response to matrix protein Vn. These data suggest that CK2 might be shed from VSMC surface in response to specific developmental and pathophysiological cues. Now soluble, the shed CK2 likely has a role in morphogenesis, tissue repair, and remodeling. Vn has been identified as a natural substrate for CK2. The key physiological functions of Vn might be modulated by CK2-mediated phosphorylation (7Seger D. Gechtman Z. Shaltiel S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24805-24813Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 15Seger D. Seger R. Shaltiel S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16998-17006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Apart from these facts, Vn is one major player involved in the uPA/uPAR-mediated cell adhesion, although the question whether or not this process requires Vn phosphorylation has not been previously addressed. We asked whether CK2-mediated Vn phosphorylation might have possible functional consequences for the uPA-regulated VSMC adhesion. Our results provide strong evidence that the uPA-regulated CK2-mediated Vn phosphorylation is a decisive step in the uPA-induced VSMC adhesion. Our findings confirm and extend the pivotal role for the CK2-mediated extracellular phosphorylation in regulating several functions of different molecules, such as adhesion, signal transduction, lytic activity, and resistance to proteolytic cleavage (25Nilsson Ekdahl K. Nilsson B. Biochem. J. 1997; 328: 625-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). However, several observations require further clarification. Although our results suggest that CK2 shed in response to Vn, they do not indicate that shedding is an obligatory step in Vn phosphorylation. One possibility is a biphasic response in which uPA-activated CK2 may phosphorylate cell surface-bound as well as soluble Vn. The latter process is presumably mediated by CK2 shedding. This hypothesis is in agreement with reports of others demonstrating that ecto-CK2 may regulate protein phosphorylation in its membrane-bound and secreted form (25Nilsson Ekdahl K. Nilsson B. Biochem. J. 1997; 328: 625-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). VSMC might utilize the uPA-dependent and CK2-mediated Vn phosphorylation in the extracellular environment. This mechanism may be especially effective under certain pathological situations, such as injury, inflammation, or oxygen deficiency, where extracellular ATP required for phosphorylation can reach high concentration (9Redegeld F.A. Caldwell C.C. Sitkovsky M.V. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1999; 20: 459-465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Another puzzling observation was obtained in our experiments using Vn in its dephosphorylated form and after phosphorylation in vitro by CK2 purified from rabbit liver. Contrary to our expectations, no promotion of cell adhesion in response to uPA on fully phosphorylated Vn was observed, although the basal level of cell adhesion was increased. At the same time, uPA did induce VSMC adhesion on the dephosphorylated Vn. These results indicate that the uPA-directed VSMC adhesion on Vn requires its specific phosphorylation by the native cell-specific ecto-CK2. They suggest also that Vn phosphorylation in vivo by cell surface CK2 and its phosphorylation in vitro by cytosolic CK2 of other cellular origin are not identical. In fact, it is hardly to expect that phosphorylations of Vn in vitro and in vivo are the same. In vitro phosphorylation, by using recombinant or purified components of phosphorylation reaction, does not take into account several important parameters. These parameters include the dynamic equilibrium between phosphorylation and dephosphorylation, the level of Vn prephosphorylation, as well as the local concentrations of magnesium and ATP, all of which are decisive for the phosphorylation reaction. Moreover, the CK2 family of protein kinases includes presumably numerous CK2-like enzymes with different, at least in part, properties (26Dirac-Svejstrup A.B. Shorter J. Waters M.G. Warren G. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 475-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The existence of more than one isoform of the CK2 subunits may be more widespread than originally thought and opens the possibility that different subunits may confer different functional properties to the enzyme (27Walz K. Pardo P. Passeron S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 340: 347-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 28Veis A. Sfeir C. Wu C.B. Crit. Rev. Oral Biol. Med. 1997; 8: 360-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). CK2 has been studied extensively at the biochemical level. However, very little is known about its functionin vivo. The definition of this problem is strengthened by the findings of others indicating that the actual level of CK2 expression and activity in a given cell type is very specific. Thus, even a small deviation would produce an altered or dysregulated biological response in the cell (29Ahmed K. Davis A.T. Wang H. Faust R.A. Yu S. Tawfic S. J. Cell. Biochem. 2000; 35: 130-135Crossref Google Scholar). This conclusion is supported by our results demonstrating that although uPA increased Vn phosphorylation and VSMC adhesion up to 3-fold, the calculated stoichiometry of this reaction was relatively low and corresponded to 0.42 mmol of phosphate per mol of Vn. This corresponds to the reports of others that the stoichiometry of phosphorylation of native Vn in plasma is low (30McGuire E.A. Peacock M.E. Inhorn R.C. Siegel N.R. Tollefsen D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 1942-1945Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our findings additionally suggest that the Vn phosphorylation event in and of itself is not sufficient to mediate uPA-directed cell adhesion. Most likely, a proper dynamic association of the complex components, such as CK2-uPA-uPAR-Vn-ανβ3integrin might be decisive to induce adhesive process. These considerations are in agreement with the findings of others that CK2-mediated phosphorylation of and its association with some substrates in vitro andin vivo are different (31Willert K. Brink M. Wodarz A. Varmus H. Nusse R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3089-3096Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). These results indicate that the uPA-directed VSMC adhesion on Vn is a complex and well controlled dynamic interplay of interdependent molecules in which native cell surface CK2 is a prerequisite. Multiple interactions of the involved components probably take place within the dynamic clusters where CK2, uPAR, and ανβ3 integrin become colocalized during the adhesion process. Our last finding is consistent with the demonstration that ectokinases are strongly attached to lipid-anchored molecules on the cell surface membrane (32Paas Y. Fishelson Z. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 316: 780-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) and that CK2 is functionally associated with integrins (15Seger D. Seger R. Shaltiel S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16998-17006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). This observation may have relevance to a recent study in which uPAR clustering in human neutrophils was coupled to Vn-mediated signaling events (33Sitrin R.G. Pan P.M. Harper H.A. Todd III, R.F. Harsh D.M. Blackwood R.A. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 3341-3349Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The most important finding of our work is that we demonstrate for the first time the specific phosphorylation of Vn by ecto-CK2 released from the surface of native VSMC, that this process is regulated by uPA, and that the process is required for the uPA-induced cell adhesion on Vn. Of course, it remains to be determined under what physiological or pathophysiological circumstances this mechanism might be triggered and utilized in vivo. One likely situation might be cell damage upon vascular injury or inflammation where local concentration of ATP complexed with magnesium, as well as uPA expression and Vn deposition, are up-regulated. Moreover, Vn produced by VSMC at sites of injury is presumably in its dephosphorylated form and therefore might be effectively utilized in the proposed mechanism. Together, these findings highlight an important role of extracellular phosphorylation for the functional regulation of human VSMC and support a hypothetical model in which several possibilities regarding the mechanism and functional consequences of the uPA/uPAR-dependent ecto-CK2 stimulation in VSMC are considered (Fig. 7). VSMC stimulation with uPA in the presence of Vn (a) leads to the activation of the cell surface, uPAR- and ανβ3integrin-associated ecto-CK2. The activation is most likely due to the conformational changes of this complex resulting from the uPA/uPAR binding and Vn-uPAR-ανβ3integrin association (b). The activated CK2 phosphorylates its natural substrates, such as the shuttle protein nucleolin and matrix protein Vn, which are also associated with uPAR (c). Phosphorylated substrates can contribute to the control of at least two important cellular functions (d). The first pathway addresses the mechanism of uPA-induced mitogenic effects via the CK2-mediated phosphorylation of nucleolin that leads to the nucleolin internalization and cell proliferation control (8Dumler I. Stepanova V. Jerke U. Mayboroda O.A. Vogel F. Bouvet P. Tkachuk V. Haller H. Gulba D.C. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 1468-1476Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The second pathway encompasses Vn phosphorylation by uPA-activated CK2 that in turn increases Vn adhesive capacity and, correspondingly, the strength of VSMC adhesion mediated by two adhesive receptors, namely uPAR and ανβ3 integrin. Under certain conditions, CK2 might be released, at least partially, from the cell surface. This shedding could contribute to phosphorylation of its substrate(s) in the extracellular environment and thereby could lead to cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions. A goal for the future will be to identify the molecular mechanisms of these interactions and their coordination in space and time and to determine how they contribute to regulation of complex events such as cell proliferation and migration.

Pol ε has been shown to play essential roles in chromosomal DNA replication. Here, we report reconstitution of the yeast pol ε complex, which was expressed and purified from baculovirus-infected insect cells. During the purification, we were able to resolve the pol ε complex and truncated Pol2p (140 kDa), as was observed initially with the pol ε purified from yeast. Biochemical characterization of subunit stoichiometry, salt sensitivity, processivity, and stimulation by proliferating cell nuclear antigen indicates that the reconstituted pol ε is functionally identical to native pol ε purified from yeast and is therefore useful for biochemical characterization of the interactions of pol ε with other replication, recombination, and repair proteins. Identification and characterization of a proliferating cell nuclear antigen consensus interaction domain on Pol2p indicates that the motif is dispensable for DNA replication but is important for methyl methanesulfonate damage-induced DNA repair. Analysis of the putative zinc finger domain of Pol2p for zinc binding capacity demonstrates that it binds zinc. Mutations of the conserved cysteines in the putative zinc finger domain reduced zinc binding, indicating that cysteine ligands are directly involved in binding zinc.

DNA polymerase ε proliferating cell nuclear antigen replication factor C methyl methanesulfonate maltose-binding protein replication protein A DNA polymerase epsilon (pol ε)1 purifies from yeast as a four-subunit holoenzyme. The subunits are Pol2p (256 kDa), Dpb2p (80 kDa), Dpb3p (34 kDa), and Dpb4p (29 kDa), and the genes encoding all four have been identified (1Hamatake R.K. Hasegawa H. Clark A.B. Bebenek K.

Pol2p encodes the polymerase catalytic activity and is essential for the viability of yeast. Unlike the other essential polymerases, the polymerization function of pol ε can actually be performed by another polymerase during DNA replication because deletion of the catalytic portion of the protein is not lethal (6Dua R. Levy D. Campbell J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22283-22288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). However, a point mutation in the polymerase active site is lethal, suggesting that normally the polymerase does function during DNA replication and that the presence of an inactive molecule is inhibitory. In Xenopus, pol ε is also essential for DNA replication (7Waga S. Masuda T. Takisawa H. Sugino A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4978-4983Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Our previous work showed that Pol2p and Dpb2p expressed in insect cells form a heterodimer that itself forms a tetramer (Pol2p/Dpb2p)2 mediated by self-interaction of the Dpb2p subunits. In addition, we found that Dpb3 and Dpb4 form a dimer that can interact with Pol2p/Dpb2p heterodimers. We identified a motif in the COOH-terminal, zinc finger domain of Pol2p (256 kDa) which was essential for interaction with Dpb2p and for dimerization, and we showed that this motif was essential for viability. The same region mediates interaction with Dpb3p/Dpb4p. Despite these advances in studying pairwise interactions and even interactions between the two heterodimers, Pol2p/Dpb2p and Dpb3p/Dpb4p, we were not able to reconstitute a holoenzyme containing all four subunits with the same stoichiometry as the holoenzyme isolated from yeast. Such reconstitution is critical for the next step in our planned analysis, namely, to investigate how the holoenzyme interacts with its accessory factors, RF-C and PCNA in primer binding and processivity, as well as how it interacts at the mechanistic level with other proteins in replication, recombination, and repair. Our results suggested that failure to reconstitute the holoenzyme was the result of poor expression of the large catalytic subunit compared with the other subunits. We describe a new expression vector that allows efficient expression of a tagged version of Pol2p in insect cells. Using this new virus, along with the previously validated vectors encoding the remaining subunits (8Dua R. Edwards S. Levy D.L. Campbell J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28816-28825Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), we have devised a rapid purification of a highly active four-subunit holoenzyme. We show that this preparation is suitable for studying the interaction between pol ε and other proteins by demonstrating that it is stimulated by the accessory proteins RF-C and PCNA, in just the same way as the enzyme from yeast (9Eissenberg J.C. Ayyagari R. Gomes X.V. Burgers P.M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6367-7378Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Lee S.-H. Pan Z.-Q. Kwong A.D. J. Biol.

Both the RF-C complex and PCNA have been overexpressed by others, dramatically facilitating purification of large amounts for our studies (12Gerik K.J. Gary S.L. Burgers P.M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1256-1262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 13Ayyagari R. Impellizzeri K.J. Yoder B.L. Gary S.L. Burgers P.M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4420-4429Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). The fact that pol ε, unlike pol δ, is very processive even in the absence of PCNA and RF-C raises the question of the physiological significance of RF-C and PCNA stimulation. To investigate this issue, we present a genetic study of the interaction between PCNA and the catalytic subunit using site-directed mutagenesis to define the interaction site and its physiological significance. We show that mutation of a conserved motif corresponding to a putative PCNA interaction site in the Pol2p catalytic subunit leads to sensitivity to MMS. Similarly, we show that there is a zinc binding domain in the COOH-terminal portion of the protein and that it is important for growth in the presence of MMS. A separate motif, located in the midst of the zinc-binding amino acids, defined by us previously as essential for dimerization of Pol2p by Dpb2p (6Dua R. Levy D. Campbell J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22283-22288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 14Dua R. Levy D.L. Campbell J.L. J. Biol.

Western blotting reagents and nitrocellulose membrane were from Amersham Biosciences, Inc. Polyclonal antibody for the pol ε complex was initially provided by Dr. Akio Sugino (Osaka University, Osaka, Japan). RPA was purified using vectors provided by Richard Kolodner, Ludwig Institute, La Jolla, CA). The NH2 terminus of POL2 was amplified by PCR. A putative viral ribosomal binding site and FLAG epitope sequence in-frame with the NH2 terminus ofPOL2 were also added. The sequences of the primers used for PCR are as follows: FE1, 5′-GATCCTCGAGCCTATAAATATGGACTACAAGGACGACGATGACAAAATGATGTTTGGCAAGAAAAAA-3′ FE2, 5′-GTTGATAAGCTTGAACCATC-3′. The PCR products were cloned directly in PCR Blunt II Topo (Invitrogen). The recombinant plasmid containing the insert was digested with XbaI/KpnI, and the POL2fragment was cloned in pBacPak8 (CLONTECH) to create pBac-N-POL2. The pfastbacPOL2 (8Dua R. Edwards S. Levy D.L. Campbell J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28816-28825Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) was digested withBamHI, and the vector containing the COOH terminus ofPOL2 was self-ligated to create pfast-C-POL2. The pBac-N-POL2 was digested with BamHI, and the NH2-terminal POL2 fragment was cloned in pfast-C-POL2, which resulted in pfast-FLAGPOL2. The 6×His-DPB2, DPB3, and DPB4 baculoviruses were prepared as described earlier (8Dua R. Edwards S. Levy D.L. Campbell J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28816-28825Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The preparation of baculoviruses was performed using the Bac to Bac system from Invitrogen as described previously (8Dua R. Edwards S. Levy D.L. Campbell J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28816-28825Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The culture supernatant containing the baculovirus particles was stored in the dark at 4 °C. As a control, pfastbacI vector plasmid was used to prepare wild-type baculovirus. These virus are available from Orbigen (San Diego). For expression of proteins, 150 × 106log phase High-Five insect cells were grown in suspension tissue culture flasks. The cells were infected with viral supernatant at a multiplicity of infection of 10 for POL2, 5 forDPB2, 5 for DPB3, and 5 for DPB4. After a 2-day incubation at 27 °C, cells were harvested, washed once with cold 1× Tris-buffered saline, flash frozen in liquid N2, and stored at −70 °C. The frozen cells were thawed once on ice and then resuspended in 5 ml of buffer A (50 mmTris, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 20% glycerol, pH 7.5) containing 20 μg/ml leupeptin. After lysis, cells were kept on ice for 15 min and centrifuged at 12,000 rpm in a microcentrifuge for 10 min, and supernatant was recovered. 1 ml of anti-FLAG M2-agarose beads (50:50 in buffer A) was added to the supernatant, and the mixture was kept at 4 °C with end-to-end rotation for 2 h. All further purification steps were carried out at 4 °C unless otherwise stated. After binding of the proteins, beads were centrifuged at 1,000 rpm using a swinging bucket centrifuge, and the unbound protein fraction was collected. Then 1 ml of buffer A was added to the beads, and it was packed on a column. The beads with the bound proteins on the column were washed with 25 ml of buffer A. To elute proteins, 5 × 1 ml of buffer A containing 100 μg/ml 3× FLAG peptide was added, and 0.5 ml fractions were collected. The total protein, unbound protein, and eluted protein fractions were analyzed using 10% SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. The fractions were also analyzed for DNA polymerase activity. 100–200 μg of the eluted protein was diluted with buffer B (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol) and applied to the Mono Q (5/5) column. The column was washed with 7 ml of buffer A, subjected to a 4-ml linear gradient from 100 to 225 mm NaCl, and then a 25-ml linear gradient from 225 to 430 mm NaCl and 0.5-ml fractions were collected. The fractions were analyzed by 10% SDS-PAGE, silver staining, and also by enzymatic assay analysis. The fractions containing 140 kDa of Pol2p or pol ε were combined, and glycerol was adjusted to 35%. The proteins were then aliquoted in 50–100-μl fractions and stored at −70 °C. The concentration of protein was determined using the Bradford assay with bovine γ-globulin as a standard. The expression of RF-C was performed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae using pBL420 expression plasmid containing genes for all five subunits of RF-C complex (12Gerik K.J. Gary S.L. Burgers P.M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1256-1262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). PCNA was expressed in E. coli in a 50-liter culture as described (13Ayyagari R. Impellizzeri K.J. Yoder B.L. Gary S.L. Burgers P.M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4420-4429Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). The purification of RF-C and PCNA was carried as described (12Gerik K.J. Gary S.L. Burgers P.M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1256-1262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 13Ayyagari R. Impellizzeri K.J. Yoder B.L. Gary S.L. Burgers P.M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4420-4429Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). The purified RF-C fractions were shown to contain DNA-stimulated ATPase activity and were also stimulated by PCNA. Gel electrophoresis showed equimolar recovery of all five subunits and greater than 95% purity. Purified PCNA was assayed by the ability to stimulate calf thymus DNA polymerase (15Brown W.C. Campbell J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21706-21710Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). DNA polymerase assays were as described, using (dA)300·oligo(dT)10 (1:20, template to primer chains) as DNA template (4Araki H. Hamatake R.K. Johnston L.H. Sugino A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4601-4605Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 5Ohya T. Maki S. Kawasaki Y. Sugino A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 3846-3852Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Reaction mixtures (60 μl) consisted of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 8 mmMgCl2, 17 μg/ml (dA)300·oligo(dT)10, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 50 μm [3H]dTTP (100 cpm/pmol). The (dA)300·oligo(dT)10 mixture was annealed in 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.1, 60 mm KCl prior to the reaction. The reactions were conducted at 37 °C for 15 min. The reactions were stopped by spotting the reaction mixture on Whatman DE81 filter paper (2.4-cm diameter). The filters were washed five times with 0.5 m Na2HPO4, twice with water, and then rinsed with 95% ethanol. Filters were dried, 3 ml of scintillation mixture was added, and radioactivity was measured. One unit of DNA polymerase activity is defined as 1 nmol of dNMP incorporated per h. A terminal mismatch substrate was prepared by hybridizing 18 bp of TM1 (phosphorylated at the 5′-end by32P) to 20 bp of TM2 using 1× SSC buffer. The sequences of TM1 and TM2 are as follows: TM1, 5′-CTA GAC TGA TCG ATG CTC-3′; TM2, 5′-TTA AGC ATC GAT CAG TCT AG-3′. The 25-μl reactions mixture consisted of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mmMgCl2, 50 mm KCl, and 20 pmol of annealed substrate. The reaction was initiated by adding 0.6 unit of pol ε or 0.8 unit of Pol2p (140 kDa) at 37 °C. Samples of mixture were removed at 3, 6, 9, 15, and 30 min. The reaction was stopped by adding 1 μ1 of 0.5 m EDTA, and products were analyzed on a 15% urea-polyacrylamide DNA sequencing gel. The 30-μ1 reaction mixture contained 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5; 8 mm MgC12; 0.2 mg/m1 bovine serum albumin; 100 μm dCTP, dGTP, and dATP; 25 μm [32P]dTTP (5,000–10,000 cpm/pmol); 0.5 mm ATP; 250 ng of singly primed M13mp18 (the 36-mer primer is complementary to nucleotides 6330–6295); and 1.2 μg of yeast replication protein A. The reaction was started by adding 0.6 unit of pol ε or 0.8 unit of Pol2p (140 kDa), and the reaction reaction mixture was incubated for 15 min at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped by adding 8 μ1 of stop buffer (60% glycerol, 50 mm EDTA, 1% SDS, xylene cyanol, and bromcresol green). To assess the effect of RF-C and PCNA, the primed M13 template was incubated with 1.2 μg of RP-A, 20 ng of RF-C, and 200 ng of PCNA. The reaction was started by the addition of either pol ε or Pol2p as described above. For salt dependence of the reaction, 25–150 mm KCl was included in the mixture. The products of the reaction were separated on a 1% alkaline agarose gel (15 × 13 × 0.3-cm gel, 23 V, 15 h). The gel was neutralized in 1× TBE buffer for 30–45 min and dried on a gel dryer for 45 min with no heat. The gel was dried further in air for 2–3 h at room temperature and analyzed by phosphorimaging. POL2fragments (nucleotides 6663–6942, amino acids 2100–2190) were generated by PCR using pRS314-POL2, pRS314-pol2-F (2153–2162), and pRS314-pol2-P (14Dua R. Levy D.L. Campbell J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30046-30055Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) as DNA templates. BamHI/SalI restriction enzyme sites were created in the design of the oligonucleotide primers. The sequences of the oligonucleotides are as follows: MAL3, TTC AAA GAT CCA GGA TCC AGT CTC GTC GTG-3′; MAL4, TAA CTT TTG AAG TCG ACT TTA TCA GGG GAG AGT TC-3′. The fragments were purified, digested byBamHI/SalI, and then purified from agarose gels. The trimmed fragments were cloned in-frame with MalE between theBamHI and SalI sites of pMal-P2X vector. BL21(DE3) E. coli cells were transformed with pMal-P2X recombinant plasmids containing the MalE-POL2 gene fusions. As a control, cells were also transformed with pMal-P2X vector only. Cells harboring the plasmids were grown in 1 liter of 2× YT medium at 37 °C until the A 600 reached 0.8. Isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to 0.5 mm, and the culture was grown for another 4 h. The cells were harvested and centrifuged at 12,000 rpm. The pellet was resuspended in 22 ml of lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.05% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μm pepstatin, 5 μm leupeptin, and 10% glycerol). The mixture was sonicated (6 × 30 s at 50% setting). To the cell extract, polymin P was added to 0.3% and was tumbled at 4 °C for 1 h to precipitate the DNA. The mixture was centrifuged at 18,000 rpm for 30 min, and the supernatant was collected and combined with 3 ml of hydrated amylose resin (equilibrated in buffer M (20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, 1 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, 0.05% Triton X-100, l mm EDTA)). The mixture was tumbled at 4 °C for 2 h, centrifuged at 1,200 rpm, and unbound protein fraction was collected. The resin containing the bound proteins was packed into a gravity column. The resin was washed with 40 ml of buffer M, and MalE fusion proteins were eluted with buffer N (buffer M containing 50 mm maltose). Fractions (8 × l ml) were collected and analyzed by 10% SDS-PAGE and Coomassie staining. The protein concentration was determined using the Bradford assay with bovine γ-globulin as standard. Typically, 20–30 mg of MalE fusion protein was obtained from l liter of culture. The assay was performed as described (16Triech I. Riva M. Sentenac A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21971-21976Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, MalE-POL2 fusion proteins were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and electroblotted on a nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was incubated in metal-binding buffer T (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm dithiothreitol) for 1.5 h. The proteins were denatured for 30 min in the same buffer containing 6 m guanidine HCl. The guanidine HCl was removed, and the membrane was washed (3 × 15 ml) with buffer T and then incubated for 1 h with 7 μCi/ml65ZnCl2 in 10 ml of buffer T. The membrane was washed with 3 × 15 ml of buffer T, dried briefly in air, and analyzed by phosphorimaging. After phosphorimaging, quantification of the proteins was carried out by staining the membrane with 0.1% Amido Black in 45% methanol and 10% acetic acid and densitometry analysis. Although we were previously able to achieve high expression levels of Dpb2p, Dpb3p, and Dpb4p in insect cells, the large catalytic subunit Pol2p was expressed poorly (8Dua R. Edwards S. Levy D.L. Campbell J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28816-28825Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 14Dua R. Levy D.L. Campbell J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30046-30055Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). To increase the Pol2p recovery level, the Pol2p was tagged with a FLAG epitope at its amino terminus, allowing affinity purification by anti-FLAG resin. Insect cells were simultaneously infected with four viruses, each expressing one of the four subunits. The Dpb2p was tagged with His6 at its NH2 terminus for the current studies. Tagging resulted in higher solubility of the Dpb2p as compared with the untagged version, and attempts to purify the four-subunit enzyme using virus expressing untagged Dpb2p have failed to yield the holoenzyme. Dpb3p and Dpb4p were expressed without tags. Western blotting of extracts of cells expressing these four viruses using anti-FLAG or α-Pol2p antibody showed a 10× increase in Pol2p in extracts compared with our previous expression strategy (data not shown) (8Dua R. Edwards S. Levy D.L. Campbell J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28816-28825Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Pol ε was then purified using an anti-FLAG affinity column. As shown in Fig. 1 A, all four subunits (FLAG-Pol2p, His6-Dpb2p, Dpb3p, and Dpb4p) eluted together, suggesting that these polypeptides had formed the pol ε holoenzyme complex in vivo. As observed during purification of pol ε from yeast, in addition to the pol ε holoenzyme, a 140 kDa truncated form of Pol2p was also present in the purified fraction (Fig. 1 A). To resolve the pol ε holoenzyme from the truncated Pol2p (140 kDa), the mixture was fractionated further on a Mono Q anion exchange column, and the fractions were assayed for DNA polymerase activity and analyzed by gel electrophoresis. As shown in Fig. 1 B, the polymerase activity was resolved into two distinct peaks. SDS-PAGE analysis of the corresponding fractions indicated that fractions 20–23 (eluting at 0.26 m NaCl) contained Pol2p (140 kDa), whereas fractions 25–28 (eluting at 0.29 m NaCl) contained the four-subunit pol ε holoenzyme (FLAG-Pol2p (256 kDa), His6-Dpb2p, Dpb3p, and Dpb4p) complex. Identity of the bands was confirmed by Western blotting (not shown). This elution profile is similar to that obtained when pol ε was purified from yeast cells (1Hamatake R.K. Hasegawa H. Clark A.B. Bebenek K. Kunkel T.A. Sugino A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 4072-4083Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Scanning of either Coomassie- or silver-stained gels indicates that Pol2p:Dpb2p:Dpb3p:Dpb4p are in 1.3:1:3:4 stoichiometric ratio in the holoenzyme preparation, which is consistent with the composition of the holoenzyme purified for yeast. The specific activities of the pol ε holoenzyme and Pol2p (140 kDa) were 25,000 and 65,000 units/mg, respectively. The yield of the holoenzyme was 15–20 μg/100 ml of infected cells. The copurification of the four subunits of the pol ε holoenzyme in the same stoichiometric amounts as found in the native enzyme purified from yeast combined with the high enzymatic activity demonstrates that we have reconstituted the functional polymerase holoenzyme. There are two bands present in the reconstituted holoenzyme which warrant further explanation. The additional band below 80 kDa is an unrelated contaminant because it does not copurify with the polymerase peak and does not react with Pol2p antibody. Western blotting using a polyclonal antibody to the entire Pol2p expressed in E. coli 3C. Li and J. Campbell, unpublished observations. revealed that the additional band above the Pol2p (140 kDa) is a proteolytic product of the FLAG-Pol2p. We have now demonstrated that its presence can be minimized by growing the infected cells for 60 h rather than 48 h, the conditions under which the enzyme in Fig. 1 was prepared (data not shown). Both pol ε and Pol2p (140 kDa) have been shown to possess high intrinsic processivity (10Lee S.-H. Pan Z.-Q. Kwong A.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22707-22717Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Burgers P.M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22698-22706Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Gerik K.J. Gary S.L.

Chem. 1991; 266: 22689-22697Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To characterize our enzyme preparations, we measured the processivity of pol ε and Pol2p (140 kDa) using the (dA)300·oligo(dT)10 template (18Bambera R.A. Fay P.J. Mallaber L.M. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 262: 270-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2 A, both pol ε holoenzyme and Pol2p were inherently processive and able to synthesize at least 200 bases/synthesis cycle. The addition of PCNA, however, stimulated both the extent of synthesis by 2–3-fold (Fig.2 B) and the processivity of both pol ε holoenzyme and Pol2p (140 kDa) (Fig. 2 A). The extent of stimulation is similar to that reported by others (19Maki S. Hashimoto K. Ohara T. Sugino A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21332-21341Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). As described previously, large amounts of PCNA were inhibitory (9Eissenberg J.C. Ayyagari R. Gomes X.V. Burgers P.M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6367-7378Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This level of PCNA may compete with the template for the polymerase. Processivity was also measured using single primed M13 template. As shown in Fig. 2 C, pol ε holoenzyme copied the M13 template generating an almost full-length (approximately 7210 bp) product, as well as some shorter species (see below). An equivalent number of units of Pol2p, as measured by activity on (dA)300·oligo(dT)10, was not able to copy the M13 efficiently (Fig. 2C, lanes 5 and 6). As reported previously, however, when Pol2p (140 kDa) was used at a higher concentration (5-fold), synthesis of full-length DNA was evident (not shown). This suggests that although Pol2p (140 kDa) can copy the M13 template, it is not as efficient as the pol ε holoenzyme. Processivity was measured in the presence of KCl because the enzyme purified from yeast is very sensitive to salt. Pol ε holoenzyme showed reduced DNA synthesis in the presence of KCl (Fig.2 C, lanes 2, 3, 4, and6). Pol ε holoenzyme was almost completely inhibited by 150 mm KCl and more than 95% inhibited by 75 mm KCl. Because pol ε is far more processive than pol δ, even without accessory proteins, there has been some question as to the significance of the ability of PCNA and RF-C to stimulate pol ε. Therefore, the effects of PCNA and RF-C on pol ε holoenzyme were tested. As shown in Fig. 2 D, using primed M13 coated with replication factor A as template pol ε is inhibited drastically in the presence of 75 mm KCl (compare lanes 4 and 8). The addition of yeast PCNA and RF-C stimulated synthesis in the presence of KCl dramatically (Fig. 2 D, first four lanes), as observed previously using human PCNA, RF-C, and single-stranded DNA-binding protein (10Lee S.-H. Pan Z.-Q. Kwong A.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22707-22717Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or yeast accessory proteins and pol ε purified from yeast (9Eissenberg J.C. Ayyagari R. Gomes X.V. Burgers P.M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6367-7378Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Also as observed previously (11Burgers P.M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22698-22706Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), synthesis was semiprocessive. Much of the product was only 500 nucleotides in length, but some product extended to full length with the highest concentrations of RF-C used. This 500-bp product has been described previously when M13 is used as template for pol ε (9Eissenberg J.C. Ayyagari R. Gomes X.V. Burgers P.M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6367-7378Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Burgers P.M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22698-22706Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and has been shown to be caused by polymerase pausing and lability of the PCNA·RF-C·pol ε complex compared with a PCNA·RF-C·pol δ complex (11Burgers P.M.J.

We have characterized the cis-regulatory elements in the proximal region of the FGFR1 promoter which render positive transcriptional activity. Multiple elements between −69 and −14 activate the FGFR1 promoter. Myoblast transfections revealed that potential Sp transcription factor binding sites are required for promoter activity. Electromobility shift assays indicated that myoblast nuclear proteins specifically bind to these cis-elements and that differentiated myotube nuclear extracts do not form these same complexes. In addition, Southwestern blot analysis detected binding of the most proximal Sp motif to a Sp1-like protein present in myoblast nuclear extracts but not in myotubes. In corroboration, Sp1 and Sp3 proteins were detected only in myoblasts and not in differentiated myotubes. Finally, transfection of Drosophila SL2 cells showed that Sp1 is a positive regulator of FGFR1 promoter activity and that Sp3 is a coactivator via the proximal Sp binding sites. These studies demonstrate that the FGFR1 promoter is activated by Sp transcription factors in proliferating myoblasts and demonstrate at least part of the mechanism by which FGFR1 gene expression is down-regulated in differentiated muscle fibers.

Both the sustained proliferation of myoblasts and subsequent withdrawal from the cell cycle as a part of differentiation are regulated by signal transduction cascades initiated by environmental signals including growth factors. Members of the fibroblast growth factor (FGF)1 family of signaling molecules are capable of sustaining myoblast proliferation and delaying differentiation. The cellular effects of FGF signaling are mediated through a small family of fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFRs). FGF1 and FGF2 possess well documented mitogenic activity for skeletal myoblasts, and these factors bind to FGFR1 in the cell surface of proliferating myoblasts. In addition to skeletal muscle myoblasts, FGFR1 is also expressed during development of the brain, skin, bones, and cardiac muscle (1Wanaka A. Milbrandt J. Johnson E.M. Development. 1991; 111: 455-468PubMed Google Scholar). It has recently been shown that FGFR1 can be translocated to the nucleus via importin B and that it plays an important role in the regulation of the cell cycle by inducing nuclear target genes (2Reilly J.F. Maher P.A. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 1307-1312Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). However, FGF signaling declines during myoblast differentiation. This decline is the result of loss of cell surface receptor and a coordinate decrease in FGFR1 mRNA (3Moore J.W. Dionne C. Jaye M. Swain J.L. Development. 1991; 111: 741-748PubMed Google Scholar, 4Olwin B.B. Hauschka S.D. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 761-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 5Patel S.G. Funk P.E. DiMario J.X. Gene (Amst.). 1999; 237: 265-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The significance of the developmentally regulated expression of FGFR1 in relation to muscle growth and patterning in vivo has been partially examined. Myoblast differentiation and muscle fiber formation were delayed in chick limb musculature overexpressing wild type FGFR1. Conversely, premature differentiation with decreased muscle mass occurred in chicken embryos expressing a dominant negative mutation of FGFR1 (6Itoh N. Mima T. Mikawa T. Development. 1996; 122: 291-300Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Muscle patterning within these embryos was disorganized, suggesting a role for FGFR1 function at multiple levels of developmental regulation (7Flanagan-Steet H. Hannon K. McAvoy M.J. Hullinger R. Olwin B.B. Dev. Biol. 2000; 218: 21-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Coupled with studies in vitrocorrelating FGFR1 availability and myoblast proliferationversus differentiation (8Scata K.A. Bernard D.W. Fox J. Swain J.L. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 250: 10-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), these studies demonstrate the requirement of developmentally regulated FGFR1 gene expression for normal skeletal muscle development. Although regulation of FGFR1 gene expression plays an important role in the development and growth of skeletal muscles, the mechanisms involved in its regulation are not well understood. Nonetheless, studies focusing on other growth factor receptor gene promoters have provided some insight into the possible mechanisms of FGFR1 promoter regulation. Structural analysis of the promoters of the human and rat insulin-like growth factor I and human transforming growth factor β receptor genes revealed a lack of consensus TATA and CCAAT motifs in the proximal promoter regions (9Cooke D.W.

Commun. 1994; 203: 1020-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Similarly, the human epidermal growth factor receptor and FGFR3 gene promoters lack TATA elements (13Johnson A.C. Ishii S. Jinno Y. Pastan I. Merlino G.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 5693-5699Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14McEwen D.G. Ornitz D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5349-5357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Our previous work on the FGFR1 promoter demonstrated that the promoter was structurally and functionally divided into proximal and distal regions. The distal region is located more than 1 kb upstream from the start of transcription and positively regulates FGFR1 gene expression in myoblasts (5Patel S.G. Funk P.E. DiMario J.X. Gene (Amst.). 1999; 237: 265-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The distal region contains two Sp transcription factor binding sites, both of which are required for FGFR1 promoter activity in proliferating myoblasts. Recently, it has been shown that the two functional Sp binding sites within the distal promoter region bind Sp1 in myoblast nuclear extracts (15Patel S.G. DiMario J.X. Gene (Amst.). 2001; 270: 171-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Although the distal Sp1 binding sites were required for full FGFR1 promoter activity and conferred increased transcriptional activity to a minimal thymidine kinase promoter, the distal region alone was not sufficient for promoter activity. The proximal region was also required. Therefore, additional sites in the FGFR1 proximal promoter, possibly other than CCAAT and TATA elements, regulate gene transcription. The Sp family of transcription factors plays a concerted role in regulating many different promoters. Four zinc finger Sp transcription factors have been identified. Like Sp1, both Sp3 and Sp4 can bind to the GC box or GT motifs, whereas Sp2 has a much weaker binding affinity to GT motifs. Sp1 and Sp3 are generally regarded as ubiquitously expressed, and Sp4 expression is restricted to the brain (16Hagen G. Dennig J. Preiss A. Beato M. Suske G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24989-24994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). In addition, Sp1 and Sp4 are considered to be transcriptional activators, whereas Sp3 often functions as a transcriptional repressor (17Courey A.J. Tjian R. Cell. 1988; 55: 887-898Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar, 18DeLuca P. Majello B. Lania L. J. Biol.

Chem. 1999; 274: 20-28Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). We report here the structural and functional characterization of the proximal region of the FGFR1 gene promoter. The proximal region contains multiple cis-elements that differentially regulate FGFR1 gene expression in proliferating myoblasts. These sites interact with specific transcription factors differentially expressed in proliferating myoblasts versus differentiated myotubes to confer myoblast-specific expression of the FGFR1 gene. Southwestern blot analysis and functional transient transfection assays indicate that the transcription factors Sp1 and Sp3 coactivate the FGFR1 promoter. In addition, developmentally regulated expression of the FGFR1 gene in proliferating myoblasts versus differentiated muscle fibers may be explained by differential expression of Sp transcription factors during differentiation. The plasmid 3284FGFR1CAT containing the full-length promoter was described previously (5Patel S.G. Funk P.E. DiMario J.X. Gene (Amst.). 1999; 237: 265-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). A series of mutations was made in the proximal promoter region by utilizing QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) with each of the following forward primers and their antisense oligonucleotides as reverse primers: (m23) CTGCCCTGACTCTCTTTCTCCTATCCACAGCTCACAGCGGCC; (m42) CAGGGGGCTGCCCTGCACTCTATCCTGACTCTCTTTCTCCCCTC; (m54) CAGCAGCGGGACAGGGGGTTAACCTGCACTCTGCCCTGAC. Briefly, 250 ng of 3284FGFR1 promoter plasmid was used in a PCR containing 5 μl of Pfu polymerase buffer, 1 μl ofPfu turbo DNA polymerase, 10 mm dNTPs, 125 ng of each respective oligonucleotide and H2O to 50 μl. After temperature cycling (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), DpnI treatment was performed to cleave parental DNA and to improve the efficiency of screening mutant plasmids. The reaction mixture was then transferred into JM109 cells on LB ampicillin plates, and the mutant plasmids were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Fetal (embryonic days 12–13) chick myoblasts were isolated from leg muscles and cultured in collagen-coated dishes as described previously (21DiMario J.X. Stockdale F.E. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 216: 431-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar,22O'Neill M.C. Stockdale F.E. J. Cell Biol. 1972; 52: 52-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Cells were cultured in FM medium (15% horse serum (Hyclone Laboratories), 5% chick embryo extract, 1.32 mmCaCl2, in F-10 base medium (Invitrogen)) at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 humidified incubator. For myotubes the cultures were treated with 10 μg/ml β-arabinofuranoside HCl (5Patel S.G. Funk P.E. DiMario J.X. Gene (Amst.). 1999; 237: 265-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Myoblasts were plated at a density of 2.5 × 106cells/6-cm dish in FM medium and were transfected by LipofectAMINE Plus reagent (Invitrogen). For all transfections 4 μg of FGFR1CAT mutant plasmid, 1 μg of pSVβGAL plasmid, and 8 μl of Plus reagent in 250 μl of F-10 base medium were mixed well and added to an equal volume of F-10 containing 16 μl of LipofectAMINE reagent. The lipid-DNA mixture was mixed well and incubated for 30 min at room temperature and was added to the cultures (washed previously with F-10 base medium) containing 1 ml of F-10 base medium supplemented with 5% horse serum. After 3–4 h of incubation at 37 °C in a 5% CO2humidified incubator, the medium was replaced with FM. Myoblasts were transfected 24 h after plating. Transfected myoblasts and myotubes were harvested 24 h and 9 days after transfection, respectively, and suspended in 100 μl of 0.25m Tris-HCl, pH 7.8. Cells were lysed by three rounds of freezing and thawing, and the CAT assays were performed as described previously (5Patel S.G. Funk P.E. DiMario J.X. Gene (Amst.). 1999; 237: 265-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Resulting thin layer chromatography plates were then cut and quantified by liquid scintillation counting. β-Galactosidase activities were used to normalize transfection efficiencies. The CAT activities of FGFR1 mutants were expressed as percent activities relative to full-length FGFR1 promoter activity, which was considered as 100% expression. For transfection of SL2 cells, cells were grown in 75%Drosophila SFM, 25% Schneider's Drosophilamedium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 2 mml-glutamine plus 1 × Antibiotic-Antimycotic (Invitrogen) at 25 °C without CO2. Freshly grown cells from 3–4-day-old cultures were plated at a density of 2.5 × 106 cells/6-cm dish on the day before transfection. Cells were transfected in 100% Drosophila SFM medium using Cellfectin reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Each plate received various amounts of Sp1 (pPacSp1) and Sp3 (pPacSp3) expression plasmids, 1 μg of pSVβGAL, 1.5 or 3 μg of CAT reporter plasmids, as well as pKS BlueScript (Stratagene) DNA to bring the total DNA up to 7 μg/plate. After transfection, cells were maintained in growth medium. Cells were harvested 48 h after transfection, and CAT assays were performed (5Patel S.G. Funk P.E. DiMario J.X. Gene (Amst.). 1999; 237: 265-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). For all transfection assays, four or five independent experiments were performed. Nuclear extracts from proliferating chicken myoblasts and differentiated myotubes were prepared after 24 h of culture for myoblasts and 10 days for myotubes and stored at −80 °C as described previously (23Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.M. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.M. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Greene Publishing Associates, New York1987Google Scholar). Protein content was determined by BCA protein assay (Pierce). Complementary oligonucleotides were commercially synthesized (Operon). The oligonucleotides (10 μg each) were boiled for 10 min in 10× kinase buffer and allowed to cool gradually to room temperature. Approximately 200 ng of double stranded oligonucleotide was 5′-end labeled using T4 kinase (Promega) and [γ-32P]ATP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). For each binding reaction, 2 μg of double stranded poly(dI·dC), 5× binding buffer (40 mm KCl, 15 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm MgCl2, and 5% glycerol), and 20 μg of nuclear extracts in a 20-μl reaction volume were incubated at room temperature for 30 min. Competitive EMSAs were carried out under identical conditions except that a 100 or 250 molar excess of nonlabeled double stranded oligonucleotides was added to the binding reactions. Labeled probe (70,000 cpm in 1 μl) was added and incubated further for 15 min on ice. DNA·protein complexes were resolved by 5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with 1× Tris borate EDTA buffer. The gel was dried and exposed to x-ray film overnight. Southwestern blot analysis was performed as described previously (24Zhao L. Chang L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4869-4882Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) with few modifications. Briefly, 75 μg of nuclear extracts from myoblasts, myotubes, and HeLa cells (Geneka) were denatured in 2× SDS sample buffer, boiled for 5 min, and electrophoresed in a 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Fractionated proteins were then electroblotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher & Schuell, BA-85). The membrane was prehybridized with 100 ml of hybridization buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 50 mm NaCl, and 5% nonfat dry milk for 30 min at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C. The membrane was then rinsed twice with the hybridization buffer containing 0.25% nonfat dry milk. Subsequently, the membrane was hybridized with the end-labeled probe (107 cpm) in 25 ml of hybridization buffer containing 0.25% nonfat dry milk and 250 μg of poly(dI·dC) at room temperature for 3 h. The hybridized membrane was washed four or five times with hybridization solution containing 0.25% nonfat dry milk, dried, and exposed overnight to an x-ray film. Rabbit anti-Sp1, Sp2, Sp3, and Sp4 sera and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. DAPI was from Molecular Probes, Inc. Texas Red streptavidin, biotinylated anti-rabbit IgG (H+L), and fluorescein-conjugated anti-mouse IgG were from Vector Laboratories, Inc. Anti-fast myosin heavy chain monoclonal antibody, F59, has been described previously (25Crow M.T. Stockdale F.E. Dev. Biol. 1986; 113: 238-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Proteins were resolved in 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels (26Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) and were electrotransferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were then blocked for 1 h at 37 °C or overnight at 4 °C in blocking solution (BS) containing 5% nonfat dry milk in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) with 0.05% Tween. Subsequently the membranes were incubated with rabbit polyclonal Sp1 and Sp3 antibodies, diluted 1:1,000 in BS for 1 h at room temperature, washed three times with PBS containing 0.05% Tween, and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG as a secondary antibody (1:5,000 dilution) for 1 h at room temperature. The membranes were washed five or six times in PBS containing 0.05% Tween, and the immunocomplexes were detected using the Super Signal® Chemiluminescent Substrate (Pierce) and x-ray film. Myogenic cultures were immunostained 24 h or 10 days after plating. Cells were washed three times with PBS and were fixed with 100% methanol for 5 min. Cultures were washed as above and blocked for 1 h with BS containing 0.3% bovine serum albumin and 0.1% Tween in PBS. Polyclonal anti-rabbit Sp family antibodies (1:1,000) and F59, an anti-fast myosin heavy chain monoclonal antibody (1:10) were diluted in BS. Cultures were incubated in primary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature and washed as above. Fluorescein-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (1:100) and biotinylated anti-rabbit IgG (1:100) were diluted in BS and added to the cultures. After a 1-h incubation at room temperature the cells were washed as above. Texas Red streptavidin (1:1,000 in BS) was added to the cultures for 1 h at room temperature, and the cultures were washed three times. DAPI at 300 mm concentration in PBS was added to the cultures for 10 min at room temperature and washed five times with PBS. Two drops of 2.5% diazabicyclooctane in glycerol:PBS (9:1) and coverslips were applied, and the cultures were viewed with fluorescence microscopy. A SacI DNA fragment of a chicken genomic clone containing exon 1 and the 5′-end of the first intron as well as more than 1 kb of DNA upstream from the start of published mRNA sequence encoding FGFR1 (27Pasquale E.B. Singer S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 5449-5453Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) was isolated and sequenced (Fig. 1). Sequence analysis of the proximal upstream DNA revealed four potential Sp transcription factor binding sites located at the start of transcription and at −23, −42, and −54 bp relative to the start of transcription. In addition, E2F-1, AP-2, and serum response element consensus binding motifs were identified upstream from the proximal potential Sp factor binding sites. To define the cis-acting elements required for transcription of the FGFR1 gene, a series of mutant plasmids was constructed by site-directed mutagenesis (Fig.2 A). Sp factor binding sites at −23, −42, and/or −54 bp were mutated individually and in combination. We have shown previously that two additional Sp1 binding sites located within a 2.2-kb promoter segment upstream from the proximal 1,058-bp promoter are required for developmentally regulated wild type FGFR1 promoter activity (15Patel S.G. DiMario J.X. Gene (Amst.). 2001; 270: 171-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Therefore functional analysis of proximal promoter elements included the distal 2.2-kb promoter segment of the wild type 3,284-bp promoter. Wild type (3284FGFR1) and mutated promoters were linked to the CAT reporter gene and were cotransfected with pSVβGAL into proliferating myoblasts. The promoter activity of each mutant plasmid was then evaluated by CAT assay of extracts from transfected, proliferating myoblasts and differentiated myo- tubes (Fig. 2 B). Cells transfected with promoterless pCAT3Basic vector alone showed basal levels of CAT activity. Myoblasts transfected with the wild type promoter (3284FGFR1) had more than a 55-fold increase in CAT activity, whereas its ac- tivity in myotubes was reduced substantially to basal levels. This result was similar to the previous results of experiments performed with myoblasts and myotubes (5Patel S.G. Funk P.E. DiMario J.X. Gene (Amst.). 1999; 237: 265-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). With 3284FGFR1 promoter activity set at 100% activity, CAT activities were reduced significantly in extracts from myoblasts transfected with the mutant promoters. Mutation of the −23 Sp site significantly reduced (9%) CAT activity in myoblasts. Mutations of the Sp sites at −42 and −54 resulted in 50 and 21% CAT activity, respectively. Combinatorial mutations further reduced CAT activities in myoblast extracts. CAT activities in extracts of myotubes transfected with all constructs were reduced significantly compared with 3284FGFR1 promoter activity in myoblasts. These results indicate that the Sp site at −23 bp is a functional cis-element responsible for transcriptional activation of the FGFR1 promoter in myoblasts. Furthermore, the other two Sp sites in the proximal region confer additional activation. To determine whether each of the Sp consensus binding sites interacts with a nuclear protein component(s), EMSAs were performed with three oligonucleotides spanning the region −69 to −14 (Fig.3 A). These probes were incubated with myoblast and myotube nuclear extracts. Each oligonucleotide formed a major DNA·protein complex and several additional complexes (Fig. 3 B). A 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled double stranded oligonucleotide (−23) inhibited complex formation between the labeled −23 oligonucleotide and nuclear proteins, whereas a 100-fold molar excess of the mutant oligonucleotide (m23) did not compete in binding, demonstrating specificity of the DNA-protein interactions. The major DNA·protein complex (indicated by >) was present in both myoblast and myotube nuclear extracts. However, the slower migrating complexes (indicated by *) formed only from myoblast nuclear extracts when shifted with the −23 probe and were absent in DNA·protein complexes formed from myotube nuclear extracts. Competitive binding reactions with wild type competitors of labeled −42 and −54 double stranded oligonucleotides also reduced formation of detectable DNA·protein complexes formed by both myoblast and myotube nuclear extracts with the corresponding Sp binding site (data not shown). To begin to define the nature of the DNA·protein complexes formed by the −23 Sp site and myoblast nuclear extract, competitive binding reactions using unlabeled −23 oligonucleotide and a Sp1 consensus oligonucleotide were performed (Fig. 3 C). The formation of all DNA·protein complexes was significantly reduced by the addition of a 100-fold molar excess of −23 oligonucleotide. However, only formation of the slower migrating DNA·protein complexes was inhibited competitively by the Sp consensus oligonucleotide. These results indicate that the slower migrating DNA·protein complexes contain a Sp site binding factor. To characterize further the most proximal (−23) Sp binding site, Southwestern blot analysis of myoblast and myotube nuclear extracts was carried out using the −23 oligonucleotide as a probe. In addition, a double stranded 22-bp Sp1 consensus oligonucleotide (5′-ATTCGATCGGGGCGGGGCGAGC-3′) was also used as a probe in a comparative analysis. This Sp1 consensus oligonucleotide bound to a DNA-binding protein with molecular mass of 105 kDa in myoblast nuclear extracts (Fig. 4 A). This corresponds to the size of reported Sp1 protein (28Briggs M.R. Kadonaga J.T. Bell S.P. Tjian R. Science. 1986; 234: 47-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (1059) Google Scholar). Similarly, a 105-kDa protein was detected in myoblast nuclear extracts by the −23 Sp probe. This protein was not detected by the −23 Sp probe bearing a mutation at the Sp binding site. The mutated site did bind to a lower molecular mass component in the myoblast nuclear extract, the nature of which is undefined. Interestingly, the 105-kDa protein was present only in myoblast nuclear extracts and was not detected in extracts from differentiated myotubes. As a control, a Southwestern blot with HeLa cell nuclear extract was performed using the Sp1 consensus oligonucleotide and the −23 oligonucleotide as labeled probes. Both probes detected a similar band of 105 kDa in the HeLa cell nuclear extracts (Fig. 4 B). These results indicate that the −23 proximal Sp site of the FGFR1 promoter binds the Sp1 transcription factor. Although Southwestern analysis indicated that the most proximal Sp site (−23) bound the Sp1 transcription factor (Fig. 4 B), it was not determined whether Sp transcription factors can functionally transactivate the FGFR1 promoter. To determine whether members of the Sp transcription factor family of proteins can transactivate the FGFR1 promoter, expression plasmids pPacSp1 and pPacSp3, encoding Sp1 and Sp3, respectively, were cotransfected with the wild type 3284FGFR1CAT promoter construct or its mutant derivatives into DrosophilaSL2 cells. Drosophila SL2 cells lack the endogenous Sp transcription factors and have been useful in studying the function of the Sp family of proteins (16Hagen G. Dennig J. Preiss A. Beato M. Suske G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24989-24994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 17Courey A.J. Tjian R. Cell. 1988; 55: 887-898Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar, 29Pascal E. Tjian R. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1646-1656Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.5 A, with CAT activity derived from cells transfected with 3284FGFR1CAT and 3 μg of pPacSp1 as 100% activation, Sp1 specifically transactivated the FGFR1 promoter in a dose-dependent manner. CAT activities resulting from cotransfection of mutated FGFR1CAT promoter and pPacSp1 constructs were measured. Mutations in the Sp motifs of the proximal region of the promoter reduced transactivation by Sp1 significantly (Fig. 5 B). Mutation of the Sp1 site at −23 reduced (20%) Sp1 transactivation significantly. In addition, mutations of the Sp sites at −42 also reduced FGFR1 promoter transactivation significantly to 60%, although this mutation did not reduce transactivation to the same extent (20%) as the mutation of the −23 Sp1 site. Combinatorial mutations of the Sp sites further abrogated Sp1 transactivation. Sp3 is a bifunctional transcription factor that can either activate or repress transcription (19Majello B. DeLuca P. Lania L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4021-4026Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar, 30Hagen G. Muller S. Beato M. Suske G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3843-3851Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined the potential function of Sp3 on the proximal promoter using cotransfection assays in SL2 cells. Transfection of pPacSp3 alone did not result in significant activation of the 3284FGFR1 promoter (Fig. 5 A). Sp3 alone also did not transactivate FGFR1 promoter constructs harboring mutations at individual and multiple Sp sites (Fig.5 B). Although Sp3 alone did not transactivate the FGFR1 promoter, Sp3 was found to function as a coactivator of the FGFR1 promoter in the presence of Sp1. As shown in Fig.6 A, cotransfection of a constant amount of pPacSp1 (750 ng) and increasing amounts of pPacSp3, together with the 3284FGFR1CAT construct, yielded dose-dependent increases in CAT activities. These results indicate that Sp3 functions as a coactivator in the presence of Sp1. In another set of SL2 cell transfection experiments, wild type or mutated FGFR1CAT constructs were cotransfected with pPacSp1 and pPacSp3 (Fig.6 B). As before, cotransfection of both pPacSp1 and pPacSp3 increased FGFR1 promoter activity significantly relative to cotransfection of only pPacSp1. Mutation of each Sp site alone and in combination caused a significant decline in FGFR1 promoter activity in pPacSp1 and pPacSp3 cotransfections. These results indicate that Sp1 can transactivate the FGFR1 promoter and Sp3 functions as a coactivator in the presence of Sp1. Southwestern blot analysis revealed the presence of a 105 kDa band corresponding to Sp1 only in the nuclear extracts of myoblasts. To determine whether Sp transcription factors are expressed in differentiated myotubes, Western blot analysis was carried out using the nuclear extracts from myoblasts and myotubes. Protein bands of ∼105, 65, and 60 kDa were detected using a Sp1-specific antibody. An Sp3-specific antibody detected 135, 110, and 60 kDa protein bands in the nuclear extracts of myoblasts (Fig.7). Very faint bands of Sp3 (135 and 60 kDa) were detected in the myotube nuclear extracts. Sp2 and Sp4 proteins were not detected in either myoblast or myotube nuclear extracts (data not shown). These experiments were repeated four times with fresh nuclear extracts. The molecular masses of Sp1 and Sp3 proteins were consistent with results published previously (32Dennig J. Hagen G. Beato M. Suske G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12737-12744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). To confirm further the results of Southwestern and Western blot analyses, proliferating myoblasts and differentiated myotubes were immunostained with Sp1-, Sp2-, Sp3-, and Sp4-specific antibodies. As observed earlier in Western blots, Sp2 and Sp4 proteins were not detected in myoblasts or myotubes (data not shown). Nuclear immunolocalization was observed in myoblasts immunostained with the anti-Sp1 antibody (Fig. 8). Similar nuclear immunolocalization of Sp3 was also observed in myoblasts (not shown). However, nuclear immunostaining of Sp1 or Sp3 was not detected in myotubes, confirming the results of Western and Southwestern blots. In total, these results demonstrate that the proximal Sp binding site motifs of the FGFR1 promoter are necessary for maximal transcriptional activity in myoblasts. The most proximal Sp1 site (−23) binds the Sp1 transcription factor and, in combination with the other Sp binding sites, activates the FGFR1 promoter specifically in proliferating chicken myoblasts. The proximal region of the chicken FGFR1 promoter has three potential Sp transcription factor binding sites necessary for its activation. In this study we sought to identify acis-regulatory element responsible for the transcriptional activation of the FGFR1 promoter in proliferating myoblasts. Using transient transfection experiments, we assayed the function of individual Sp sites in the proximal region of the promoter with single or multiple mutations. In primary cultures of chicken myoblasts, mutation at individual Sp sites reduced promoter activity significantly. Mutation of the −23 Sp site yielded a 10-fold reduction in CAT activity, indicating that it is a positivecis-regulatory element. Mutation of the −42 and −54 Sp binding sites caused a different pattern of reduction in promoter activity (50 and 21%), indicating that these sites are weaker positive elements. Although a fourth potential Sp binding site was identified by sequence analysis at the start of transcription, this site was not mutated in these studies to ensure proper transcription initiation as regulated by the upstream Sp elements. In Drosophila SL2 cells, mutation of the most proximal Sp site reduced Sp1 transactivation to 20%, demonstrating that this site mediates transactivation by Sp1. Mutation of the other two sites (−42 and −54) also reduced Sp1 transactivation, but to lesser extents (60 and 82%, respectively). As found in other promoters, Sp3 functioned as a coactivator of the FGFR1 promoter when cotransfected with a Sp1 expression construct into Drosophila SL2 cells (30Hagen G. Muller S. Beato M. Suske G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3843-3851Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar, 32Dennig J. Hagen G. Beato M. Suske G. J. Biol.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2012-2019Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). EMSAs etected several DNA·protein complexes formed by myoblast and myotube nuclear extracts with the three individual Sp sites. A prominent complex was detected at each site with each extract. However, formation of this DNA·protein complex was not competed against by consensus binding sites for Sp transcription factors. Therefore, the proximal Sp binding sites may also interact with novel DNA-inding proteins or may bind differentiation response elements (34Motaleb M.A. Takihara Y. Ohta H. Shimada K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 262: 509-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar) or G-C homopolymer binding factor (35Bessereau J.L. Mendelzon D. LePoupon C. Fiszman M. Changeux J.P. Piette J. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 443-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 36Bessereau J.L. Laudenbach V. LePoupon C. Changeux J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12786-12793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Multiple DNA·protein complexes formed with the −23 probe and nuclear extracts derived from myoblasts. Although the prominent DNA·protein complex did not consist of Sp1, several lines of evidence indicate that Sp1 bound to the most proximal (−23) Sp site of the FGFR1 promoter in a slower migrating complex. Southwestern blot analysis showed that a 105 kDa Sp1-like band detected by the −23 probe from the nuclear extracts of myoblasts and HeLa cells co-migrated with the band detected by the consensus Sp1 binding site in nuclear extracts of HeLa cells. Additionally, the mutated −23 probe (m23) did not detect a Sp1 band in myoblast nuclear extracts. Supershifts with the Sp1 monoclonal antibody were unsuccessful presumably because of masking of the epitope in the DNA·protein complex. Detection of Sp1 binding to the −23 probe in the Southwestern blot as a major band versus Sp1·DNA complex formation as a minor band in the EMSA may reflect differences in binding affinities under the differing conditions of the two assays. Therefore, although the −23 Sp site and Sp1 do not form the major DNA·protein complex in the EMSAs, formation of this complex is required for FGFR1 promoter activity. Western blot and immunostaining demonstrated that Sp1 and Sp3 are present in proliferating myoblasts and not in differentiated myotubes. This pattern of Sp transcription factor localization is coincident with FGFR1 gene expression in proliferating myoblasts and down-regulation in differentiated myotubes (5Patel S.G. Funk P.E. DiMario J.X. Gene (Amst.). 1999; 237: 265-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). This specific correlation is extended to more general findings of elevated Sp1 levels in early neonatal mice and subsequent reduced levels in adults (38Saffer J.D. Jackson S.P. Annarella M.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2189-2199Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). Sp1- and Sp3-deficient embryos are growth-retarded and either die after 10 days of embryonic development (39Marin M. Karis A. Visser P. Grosveld M. Philipsen S. Cell. 1997; 89: 619-628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar) or after birth because of respiratory failure (40Bouwman P. Gollner H. Elsasser H.P. Eckhoff G. Karis A. Grosveld F. Philipsen S. Suske G. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 655-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Some mechanisms of inhibition of Sp1 function have been reported. The cell cycle regulatory protein p107 specifically represses Sp1-dependent transcription (41Datta P.K. Kadonaga J.T. Bell S.P. Tjian R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5444-5452Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Furthermore, G10BP protein and Sp3 can compete with Sp1 for G-C-rich sequences and thereby inhibit Sp1 transactivation (18DeLuca P. Majello B. Lania L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8533-8536Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 42Birnbaum M.J. van Wijnen A.J. Odgren P.R. Last T.J. Suske G. Stein G.S. Stein J.L.

Biol. 1995; 15: 5423-5433Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Also, GC homopolymer binding factor protein has been found to compete with Sp1 and act as a negative transcriptional regulator in chicken myoblasts (35Bessereau J.L. Mendelzon D. LePoupon C. Fiszman M. Changeux J.P. Piette J. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 443-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 36Bessereau J.L. Laudenbach V. LePoupon C. Changeux J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12786-12793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Lastly, activation of MyoD transcription factor gene expression caused down-regulation of Sp1 protein in differentiated rat skeletal muscle cells (44Vinals F. Fandos C. Santalucia T. Ferre J. Testar X. Palacin M. Zorzano A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12913-12921Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Therefore, regulation of FGFR1 gene expression during differentiation may occur via active repression of Sp1 transactivation by other regulatory factors. Although such a mechanism of active repression of Sp1 transactivation early in cell differentiation may occur, down-regulation of FGFR1 gene expression in differentiated muscle fibers is also regulated by down-regulation of Sp transcription factor expression in these cells. Sp transcription factors are necessary for FGFR1 promoter activity in proliferating myoblasts, and the lack of these factors appears to be sufficient to cause down-regulation of FGFR1 gene expression in differentiated muscle fibers. Similar to the FGFR1 promoter, promoter regions of other growth factor receptor genes including epidermal growth factor (13Johnson A.C. Ishii S. Jinno Y. Pastan I. Merlino G.T. J. Biol.

Commun. 1994; 203: 1020-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) also lack consensus TATA elements. Instead, these promoters contain multiple potential Sp transcription factor binding sites proximal to the start of transcription. It has been proposed that such multiple Sp binding sites and associated protein(s) may stabilize the transcriptional machinery and establish a site of transcription initiation in promoters without TATA elements (14McEwen D.G. Ornitz D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5349-5357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Although the proximal Sp binding sites of the FGFR1 promoter are required for transcriptional activation, these sites are not sufficient. We have previously located two additional Sp1 binding sites in a distal region of the promoter located more than 1 kb upstream from the proximal Sp binding sites (15Patel S.G. DiMario J.X. Gene (Amst.). 2001; 270: 171-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). These two distal sites are also required for FGFR1 promoter activity. Therefore, it appears likely that these two regions interact to regulate FGFR1 gene transcription, and it is likely that the interaction occurs via the proteins associated with the Sp sites. A similar regulatory mechanism has been suggested by others for Sp1-dependent gene regulation (29Pascal E. Tjian R. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1646-1656Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar, 31Su W. Jackson S. Tjian R. Echols H. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 820-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). This type of mechanism in which direct Sp1-Sp1 protein interactions occur at a distance along the promoter may require looping of the intervening promoter region bringing the distal Sp1 sites near the start of transcription (14McEwen D.G. Ornitz D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5349-5357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). It is currently not known whether such a looping mechanism exists to regulate FGFR1 gene expression. The Sp1 and Sp3 expression plasmids pPacSp1 and pPacSp3 (17Courey A.J. Tjian R. Cell. 1988; 55: 887-898Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar) were generous gifts from Dr. Gantrum Suske (University of Marburg, Germany)."
https://openalex.org/W2128153018,"Effects of long term (72-h) exposure to low concentration (0.1 μm) of nicotine on various types of voltage-dependent Ca2+channels (VDCCs) and neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nnAChRs) were examined using primary cultures of mouse cerebral cortical neurons. High potassium (30 mm KCl)-stimulated45Ca2+ influx into the neurons increased with increasing the duration of nicotine exposure and its concentrations. The maximal increase of the KCl-stimulated45Ca2+ influx was found 24 h after the initiation of exposure and thereafter maintained up to 72 h. This enhancement of KCl-induced 45Ca2+ influx after 72-h exposure to 0.1 μm nicotine was completely abolished by concomitant exposure with mecamylamine, an inhibitor for nnAChRs. Only the component of the KCl-induced 45Ca2+influx observed after long term exposure to nicotine, which was sensitive to nifedipine, an inhibitor of L-type VDCCs, was facilitated, while the 45Ca2+ influx through P/Q- and N-type VDCCs showed no changes. Moreover, enhanced immunoreactivity against antibody for the α1C subunit of L-type VDCCs was recognized, whereas no changes in immunoreactivities against antibodies for α1A and α1B subunits of other types of VDCCs were noted. In addition, a Western blot analysis showed an increase of immunoreactivities against antibodies for α1Dand α2/δ1, and expression of mRNA for L-type VDCC subunit, α1F, was also enhanced, although β4 mRNA expression was not changed. Whole cell patch clamp analysis revealed that the increase of the amplitude of Ba2+ currents was also recognized in the neurons exposed to nicotine, and nicardipine reduced this increased amplitude to the level of the amplitude detected in nontreated neurons with nicardipine. The up-regulation of α4 and β2 subunits, but not the α3 subunit of nnAChRs, was also noted after the nicotine exposure when examining by the Western blot analysis. Taken together, these results indicate that the long term exposure of the neurons to a low concentration of nicotine induces both increased45Ca2+ influx through up-regulated L-type VDCCs and nnAChR up-regulation.

Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1992; 2: 254-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 2Sargent P.B. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1993; 16: 403-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (937) Google Scholar). nnAChRs consist of five subunits (3Brisson A. Unwin P.N. Nature. 1985; 315: 474-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar), and expressed subunits of nnAChRs are numerous, which gives rise to the potential for enormous functional diversity of nnAChRs (2Sargent P.B. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1993; 16: 403-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (937) Google Scholar). nnAChRs in the central nervous system are a target of nicotine and mediate fast depolarization of neuronal membrane (4Connolly J.G. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1989; 93: 221-231Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar) to increase the permeability to Ca2+ above that of their counterparts at the neuromuscular junction (5Vernino S. Amador M. Luetje C.W. Pareick J. Dani J.A. Neuron. 1992; 8: 127-134Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). This high permeability of neuronal membrane to Ca2+ produces, in turn, many effects of nicotine in the central nervous system including memory facilitation, increase in spontaneous activity, convulsions, suppression of irritability and appetite, and stimulation of local glucose utilization (6Clarke P.B. Psychopharmacol. Ser. (Berl.). 1987; 92: 135-143PubMed Google Scholar, 7Ochoa L.E.M. Cell. Mol. Neurobiol. 1994; 14: 195-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In addition, nnAChRs participate in alterations of central nervous functions through facilitating the release of several neurotransmitters, such as ACh, dopamine, γ-aminobutyric acid, glutamate, and serotonin, by its activation, and this potential of nnAChRs to stimulate neurotransmitter release is suppressed by various inhibitors for voltage-dependent calcium channels (VDCCs), suggesting that VDCCs play a critical role in neurotransmitter release evoked by nnAChR activation and that the opening of VDCCs via neuronal membrane depolarization is important for alterations in neuronal functions induced by nnAChRs (8Vizi E.S. Lendvai B. Brain Res. Rev. 1999; 30: 219-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). The latter suggestion is also, in part, supported by evidence that the expression of an endogenous neuroactive peptide, diazepam binding inhibitor (DBI), possessing the activity to cause anxiety (9Ferrarese C. Appollonio I. Bianchi G. Frigo M. Marzorati C. Pecora N. Perego M. Pierpaoli C. Frattola L. Psychoneuroendocrinology. 1993; 18: 3-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), is enhanced by chronic stimulation of nnAChRs with low doses of nicotine in mouse cerebral cortex and primary cultures of mouse cerebral cortical neurons, and this stimulatory effect is mediated through L-type VDCCs (10Katsura M.

The effects of both acute and chronic nicotine application on the activity of different nnAChR subtypes may be relevant to tolerance, dependence, and withdrawal syndrome associated with nicotine addiction (11Balfour D.J. Addiction. 1994; 89: 1419-1423Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 12Dani J.A. Heinemann S. Neuron. 1996; 16: 905-908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar). Chronic exposure to low doses of nicotine induces the up-regulation of high affinity α4/β2subunit of nnAChRs possessing [3H]nicotine binding sites in the neurons (13Bencherif M. Fowler K. Lukas R.J. Lippiello P.M. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1995; 275: 987-994PubMed Google Scholar, 14Gopalakrishnan M. Molinara E.J. Sullivan J.P. Mol.

Neurosci. 1999; 19: 4804-4814Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), although chronic nicotine exposure also leads to association with long lasting down-regulation in responsiveness to nicotine (16Boyd N.D. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1987; 389: 45-67Crossref Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 17Peng X. Anand R. Whiting P. Lindstrom J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 46: 523-530PubMed Google Scholar, 18Hsu Y.-N. Amin J. Weiss D.S. Wecker L. J. Neurochem. 1996; 66: 667-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). This up-regulation of nnAChRs is supposed to be a compensatory reaction against agonist-induced desensitization (16Boyd N.D. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1987; 389: 45-67Crossref Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 19Marks M.J. Burch J.B. Collins A.C. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1983; 226: 817-825PubMed Google Scholar). From these data, it is reasonable to suppose that decreased function of nnAChRs after chronic exposure to low doses of nicotine is predominantly due to functional alterations of the α4/β2 subunit of nnAChRs. In our previous reports, we have demonstrated that chronic exposure of cultured neurons to nicotine is reported to induce increase of45Ca2+ influx when examining by the application of 30 mm KCl (10Katsura M. Higo A. Tarumi C. Tsujimura A. Takesue M. Mohri Y. Shuto K. Ohkuma S. Mol. Brain Res. 2000; 80: 132-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), which leads to an assumption that functional changes of nnAChRs after continuous activation may be accompanied with those of VDCCs functionally coupled to nnAChRs. However, pharmacological characteristics of such functional alterations in VDCCs have not been fully investigated, and few available investigations were reported. In the present study, we attempted to investigate this possibility by examining VDCC functions using mouse cerebral cortical neurons in primary culture after long term treatment with low doses of nicotine. Isolation and primary culture of cerebral cortical neurons were carried out according to the method described previously (20Ohkuma S. Tomono S. Tanaka Y. Kuriyama K. Mukainaka T. Int. J. Dev. Neurosci. 1986; 4: 383-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In brief, the neopallium free of the meninges was removed from the 15-day-old fetus of a ddY strain mouse under anesthesia with diethyl ether, minced with scissors, dispersed by trypsin, and centrifuged. Thereafter, the isolated cells were inoculated on a poly-l-lysine-treated culture dish with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 15% fetal calf serum and cultured at 37 °C in humidified 95% air, 5% CO2 for 3 days. After the treatment of the cells with 10 μmcytosine arabinoside in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% horse serum for 24 h to suppress the proliferation of nonneuronal cells, the culture medium was exchanged to Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% horse serum, and the incubation was continued under the same conditions described above. The culture medium was exchanged to fresh Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% horse serum every 4 days. More than 95% of the primary cultured cells used here have been confirmed to be neurons by an immunohistochemical approach (20Ohkuma S. Tomono S. Tanaka Y. Kuriyama K. Mukainaka T. Int. J. Dev. Neurosci. 1986; 4: 383-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). For studying the effects of long term exposure to nicotine on VDCC functions, nicotine was diluted with Hanks' solution and was directly added into the culture medium. To avoid the degradation of nicotine because of its high light sensitivity, the handling, such as the addition of nicotine into the medium and culture of cells with culture medium containing nicotine, was carried out under dark conditions. In addition, nicotine-containing culture medium was exchanged every day during nicotine exposure. Cells cultivated in the absence of nicotine were used as control. Mecamylamine (1 μm) was added into the culture medium 5 min before the addition of nicotine. Under the experimental conditions used here, the exposure of nicotine (0.1 μm) to the neurons for 72 h showed no increase of lactic dehydrogenase leakage from the neurons and of the number of cells staining with trypan blue dye (data not shown), indicating that the exposure of nicotine with the concentration used in the present study was not neurotoxic. To prepare nicotine-dependent mice, male ddY strain mice weighing 30 g purchased from Japan SLC (Hamamatsu, Japan) were used after feeding them laboratory chow (Oriental Yeast, Chiba, Japan) and tap water ad libitum for 1 week. Mice were subcutaneously injected nicotine (three times a day; each dose was 1 mg/kg) for 7 days. Four hours after the last dose of nicotine, mice were killed by decapitation, and the cerebral cortices were dissected to prepare the particulate fractions used for [3H]nicotine and [3H]verapamil bindings described below (21Katsura M. Ohkuma S. Xu J. Hibino Y. Tsujimura A. Kuriyama K. Mol. Brain Res. 1998; 55: 345-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Mice after continuous treatments with nicotine showed weight loss, increased defecation, and increased locomotor activity, indicating that mice are clearly dependent on nicotine. 45Ca2+ influx into the neurons was measured according to the previously reported method (22Ohkuma S. Katsura M. Hibino Y. Xu J. Shirotani Kuriyama K. Mol. Brain Res. 1998; 54: 133-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In short, the neurons were incubated in Ca2+-free and 20 mm Hepes-containing Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer (KRB-Hepes; 137 mm NaCl, 4.8 mm KCl, 1.2 mm KH2PO4, 1.2 mmMgSO4·6H2O, 25 mmNaHCO3, and 10 mm glucose, pH 7.4) at 37 °C for 10 min, and the incubation buffer was discarded to change to fresh and warm (37 °C) Ca2+-free KRB-Hepes. The reaction was initiated by the addition of 2.7 mmCaCl2·H2O (1.0 μCi of [45Ca2+]Cl2/dish). After the incubation of the neurons at 37 °C for 2 min, the radiolabeled Ca2+-containing incubation buffer was discarded followed by five washes with ice-cold KRB-Hepes containing 2.7 mm CaCl2·H2O (total volume 7.5 ml), and the neurons were scraped off from a culture dish with 0.5m NaOH. An aliquot of the alkaline-digested neurons was neutralized with equimolar acetic acid and then used to measure radioactivity accumulated in the neurons by liquid scintillation spectrometry. KCl (30 mm) and nicotine were simultaneously added into the incubation buffer with [45Ca2+]Cl2. The addition of Bay k 8644 was also simultaneously added with [45Ca2+]Cl2 into the incubation buffer. To examine the effects of inhibitors for VDCCs on the 30 mm KCl- and nicotine-induced alterations in [45Ca2+]influx, these agents were added into the incubation buffer 15 s before the addition of 30 mm KCl, nicotine, and Bay k 8644. The receptor binding assay was carried out using the particulate fractions from the mouse cerebral cortical neurons. For the preparation of the particulate fractions, the neurons were washed three times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 10 mmNa2HPO4, and 1.8 mmKH2PO4, pH 7.4), scraped off from the dishes with ice-cold 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.4) and homogenized with a Polytron homogenizer and centrifuged (48,000 ×g, 4 °C, 20 min). The washing procedure was carried out four times before stocking at −80 °C for at least 24 h. Before the binding experiment, the frozen pellet was thawed, suspended with the same buffer, and washed three times as described above. Procedures similar to preparing the particulate fractions from the neurons were employed to prepare those of the cerebral cortex from the nicotine-dependent mice. The techniques for measuring bindings of [3H]nicotine and [3H]verapamil to the particulate fractions obtained from the cerebral cortex were similar to those for the particulate fractions of the neurons described below. The [3H]nicotine binding assay was carried out according to the method of Zhang and Nordberg (23Zhang X. Nordberg A. Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Arch. Pharmacol. 1993; 348: 28-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) with a minor modification. Briefly, the particulate fractions were incubated with 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0) containing 5 nm[3H]nicotine in a final volume of 1 ml at 2 °C for 60 min. The reaction was terminated by adding 2 ml of the ice-cold buffer, and the reaction mixture was filtered through Whatman GF/C glass filters presoaked with 0.3% polyethyleneimine solution for 5 h. The filters were washed three times with the ice-cold buffer and then subjected to measure radioactivity retained on the filters by liquid scintillation spectrometry. Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 1 μm cystine. For Scatchard analysis, the particulate fractions were incubated with various concentrations of [3H]nicotine (0.2–20 nm) under the same conditions described above. The [3H]verapamil binding assay was carried out according to the method previously reported (24Xu Y.-F. Hewett S.J. Atchison W.D. J. Neurophysiol. 1998; 80: 1056-1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly, the particulate fractions were incubated in 50 mmTris-HCl buffer (pH 7.4) containing 0.2 nm[3H]verapamil in a final volume of 1 ml at 2 °C for 60 min. The reaction was terminated by adding 2 ml of the ice-cold buffer into the assay system, and the reaction mixture was then filtered through Whatman GF/B glass filters presoaked with 0.3% polyethyleneimine solution for 5 h. The filters were washed three times with the ice-cold buffer and then subjected to measurement of radioactivity retained on the filters by liquid scintillation spectrometry. Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 10 μm nonlabeled verapamil. For Scatchard analysis, the particulate fractions were incubated with various concentrations of [3H]verapamil (0.01–8 nm) under the same conditions described above. The extraction of protein from the neurons was carried out as follows. The neurons attached to a culture dish were washed five times with ice-cold 0.15 m NaCl and fixed with 0.15m NaCl containing 6% trichloroacetic acid at 4 °C. The neurons were scraped off from the dishes and centrifuged (10,000 × g, 5 min, 4 °C). After washing the pellet with ice-cold 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5), the sample buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8) containing 4% sodium lauryl sulfate, 12% β-mercaptoethanol, and 20% glycerol) was added to the pellet in a final volume of 0.2 ml and well mixed. The suspension thus obtained was sonicated (1 min), boiled (3 min), and centrifuged (10,000 × g, 60 min, 4 °C), and the supernatant was stored at −80 °C until use. After SDS-PAGE using 5/20% gradient gel (10 × 10 cm in size, 0.5-mm thickness) was performed (20 mA for 90 min), the separated proteins in the gel were transferred onto a nitrocellulose filter using a semidry type transblotter (160 mA for 60 min) (25Laemli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). The nitrocellulose filters were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and blocked with Tris-buffered saline (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) containing 0.15 m NaCl) containing 1% bovine serum albumin at room temperature for 60 min. For immunoblotting, the nitrocellulose filters were incubated at 4 °C for overnight with the antibodies against the nnAChR α4, α3, and β2 subunits, each α1 subunit of L-, N-, and P/Q-types of VDCCs, and the α2/δ1 subunit of L-type VDCCs (diluted 1:200 to 1:1000 in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% normal serum). After washing four times with Tris-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween 20, the antigenic protein bands were stained using anti-rabbit IgG antibody conjugated with alkaline phosphatase (diluted 1:2000 for nnAChRs) and anti goat-IgG antibody conjugated with alkaline phosphatase (diluted 1:2500 for VDCCs). For protein staining, the blots were rinsed with prestained buffer (ethanol/acetic acid/H2O, 4:1:5) and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. The relative intensity of immunoreactive bands for each subunit for nnAChRs and VDCCs was calculated using ImageMaster 1D Elite software (Amersham Biosciences), and the data were estimated as percentages of each control (without treatment of nicotine). cDNA for α1F and β4 subunits of L-type VDCCs was amplified from mouse brain cDNA by polymerase chain reaction using a set of oligonucleotides (α1F, TTCGACTCTTGTTGGGTCTTG and TCAAAGCGGGAAAGAATAGA; β4, CTATAAACTCTCATCATTTCAC and TCATAACGGGTTGCACATAC) specific for the cDNA sequence of mouse α1F and β4 subunits of L-type VDCC (26Burgess D.L. Jones J.M. Meisler M.H. Noebels J.L. Cell. 1997; 88: 385-392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar, 27Nayor M.J. Rancourt D.E. Bech-Hansen N.T. Genomics. 2000; 66: 324-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). After the amplification, the cDNA was ligated withEcoRI adapter and inserted into the EcoRI site of pUC18. After washing the neurons with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4), the neurons were scraped off from a culture dish. Poly(A)+RNAs were isolated from these cells using FASTTrack™ (10Katsura M. Higo A. Tarumi C. Tsujimura A. Takesue M. Mohri Y. Shuto K. Ohkuma S. Mol. Brain Res. 2000; 80: 132-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The lysates obtained from the neurons were applied to oligo(dT)-cellulose affinity chromatography to purify poly(A)+ RNA. RNA blot hybridization was performed as previously described (10Katsura M. Higo A. Tarumi C. Tsujimura A. Takesue M. Mohri Y. Shuto K. Ohkuma S. Mol. Brain Res. 2000; 80: 132-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Denatured poly(A)+ RNA (1 μg) was electrophoresed on 1.1% agarose gel containing formaldehyde. Gels were stained with ethidium bromide and photographed under UV illumination to assess the integrity of the RNA by visual inspection. RNA was transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (NitroPure; Osminics Inc., Westborough, MA) using 20× standard saline citrate (SSC) buffer by the capillary blotting method, and the completeness of transfer was confirmed by examining gels for ethidium fluorescence. The cDNA fragment from mouse brain was labeled by the Klenow fragment with random primer and [α-32P]dCTP. Antisense oligomer (AGGTCTCAAACATGATCTGGGTCA) for β-actin (28Ponte P. Ng S.Y. Engel J. Gunning F. Kedes L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 1687-1691Crossref PubMed Scopus (899) Google Scholar) prepared by an Applied Biosystems DNA synthesizer was end-labeled by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase with [α-32P]dCTP. These denatured DNA were used as probes in the hybridization. The baked filter was hybridized with 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0), 5× SSC, 50 mg/ml salmon sperm DNA, 1× Denhardt's solution, 30% formamide, 10% dextran sulfate, and 32P-labeled probe at 42 °C for 24 h. The filters were washed with 0.2× SSC and 0.1% sodium lauryl sulfate at 50 °C and autoradiographed. The radioactive intensities of the bands were represented as arbitrary units determined by a Fujix BAS 2000 System (Fuji-Film Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). The contents of poly(A)+ RNAs isolated from the mouse cerebral cortical neurons after the treatments with nicotine were similar to those from the neurons not treated with nicotine (data not shown). In the present study, the levels of mRNA for subunits of L-type VDCCs were corrected according to the message of β-actin signal, and the levels of β-actin mRNA in the nicotine-treated neurons were the same as those in the nontreated neurons with the drugs. The whole-cell configuration of the patch clamp technique was used to perform electrophysiological experiments according to the method (29Knoflach F. Reinscheid R.K. Civelli O. Kemp J.A. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 6657-6666Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) previously reported with a minor modification. Patch pipettes were made from a barosilicate glass tube (1.5-mm outer diameter, 0.86-mm inner diameter; A-M System Inc., Pangbourne, UK) in a micropipette puller (model 87; Sutter Instruments). Pipette resistances ranged from 5 to 8 megaohms when filled with a solution (pH 7.4; 117 mm tetraethylammonium chloride, 9 mm Hepes, 9 mm EGTA, 4.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm GTP, 4 mm ATP, and 14 mm phosphocreatine; osmolarity 330 mosmol/liter). Whole-cell currents were amplified with a patch clamp amplifier system (EPC-8; HEKA Elektronik), filtered at 3 kHz, and digitized at 10 kHz with a Digidata 1200A acquisition board (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA) for subsequent storage on a personal computer. The data acquisition and analysis were carried out with the pClamp 8.0 software package (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA). The external solution consisted of 25 mm BaCl2, 145 mm tetraethylammonium chloride, 10 mmHepes, 0.1 mm EGTA, and 10 mmd-glucose (pH 7.4; osmolarity 340 mosmol/liter adjusted with sucrose). Leakage currents were subtracted using the P/4 protocol, and the series resistance was compensated by 50–60%. The protein content in the neurons was determined by the method of Lowry et al. (30Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with bovine serum albumin as a standard. Each value of the data was expressed as the mean ± S.E. The statistical significance was assessed by the methods as described in each legend of figures following the application of the one-way analysis of variance. PerkinElmer Life Sciences was a source of45CaCl2 (specific activity 0.3511 GBq/mg), [3H]nicotine (specific activity 3.02 TBq/mmol), and [3H]verapamil (specific activity 2.81 TBq/mmol). Antibodies against α3, α4, and β2 subunits of nnAChRs and anti-goat IgG were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA), and antibodies against VDCCs were products of Almone Labs Ltd. (Jerusalem, Israel). Anti-rabbit IgG as a part of picoBlue™ immunoscreening kit was obtained from Stratagene. Nifedipine was obtained from Wako Pure Chemical Industries (Osaka, Japan). ω-Conotoxin GIVA (ω-CTX) and ω-agatoxin VIA (ω-ATX) were purchased from the Peptide Institute, Inc. (Osaka, Japan). Gradient gels (5/20%) were products of Atto Co. Ltd. (Tokyo, Japan). Other reagents used were commercially available and of analytical grade. The effects of the duration of nicotine (0.1 μm) exposure on 30 mm KCl-evoked45Ca2+ influx were examined. The increase in 30 mm KCl-induced 45Ca2+ influx was found to be dependent on the duration of exposure to 0.1 μm nicotine (Fig.1 A). The influx attained its plateau 24 h after the exposure, and a similar extent of influx was thereafter maintained up to 72 h (Fig. 1 A). On the other hand, the basal 45Ca2+ influx was not altered during continuous exposure to nicotine (Fig.1 A). In addition, we examined effects of 72-h exposure to various concentrations of nicotine on 30 mm KCl-evoked45Ca2+ influx. As shown in Fig. 1 B, the increase of the 30 mm KCl-induced45Ca2+ influx dependent on nicotine concentration was noticed, and its plateau was observed at nicotine concentrations of 0.1–1 μm, although a further remarkable increase of 30 mm KCl-evoked45Ca2+ influx was detected after 72-h exposure to 3 μm nicotine. The latter increase was considered to be due to injury of neuronal membrane function, because leakage lactic dehydrogenase activity was significantly larger than that of nontreated neurons. Moreover, the leakage of lactic dehydrogenase activity tends to increase, but not significantly, after 72-h exposure to 1 μm nicotine (data not shown). Taking these data together, we employed 0.1 μm nicotine for long term exposure of neurons in the following experiments. Whether the significant increase of the 30mm KCl-induced45Ca2+ influx into the neurons after exposure to 0.1 μm nicotine for 72 h was attributable to continuous nnAChR activation by nicotine was examined by measuring 30 mm KCl-stimulated 45Ca2+ influx after concomitant exposure of the neurons to nicotine and mecamylamine, an antagonist specific for nnAChRs. As shown in Fig. 1 C, this manipulation completely abolished the increase of the KCl-induced45Ca2+ influx. These results indicate that the increased influx by 30 mm KCl after 72-h exposure to 0.1 μm nicotine is mediated through nnAChR activation. Such data also suggest that the increased extent of 30 mmKCl-induced 45Ca2+ influx found after 72-h exposure to 0.1 μm nicotine may be due to functional up-regulation of VDCCs, because 30 mm KCl is known to produce neuronal membrane depolarization, and the45Ca2+ influx observed in the presence of 30 mm KCl occurs through opening VDCCs in the neurons used here as reported previously (22Ohkuma S. Katsura M. Hibino Y. Xu J. Shirotani Kuriyama K. Mol. Brain Res. 1998; 54: 133-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In a previous experiment, the neurons used in the present study have been determined to possess at least four types of VDCCs (22Ohkuma S. Katsura M. Hibino Y. Xu J. Shirotani Kuriyama K. Mol. Brain Res. 1998; 54: 133-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Therefore, which type of VDCC was involved in the enhanced increase of 30 mm KCl-induced45Ca2+ influx after the long term (72-h) exposure to 0.1 μm nicotine was examined. The concentration of each VDCC inhibitor used in this experiment was confirmed to show their maximal inhibitory effects on the 30 mm KCl-induced 45Ca2+ influx into the neurons, and there was a significant difference in the degree of inhibitory actions of ω-ATX on the KCl-induced45Ca2+ influx at concentrations between 0.1 and 1 μm (22Ohkuma S.

https://openalex.org/W1990668991,"Tryptophan synthase is a bifunctional α2β2 complex catalyzing the last two steps of l-tryptophan biosynthesis. The natural substrates of the α-subunit indole- 3-glycerolphosphate and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate, and the substrate analogs indole-3-propanolphosphate anddl-α-glycerol-3-phosphate are allosteric effectors of the β-subunit activity. It has been shown recently, that the indole-3-acetyl amino acids indole-3-acetylglycine and indole-3-acetyl-l-aspartic acid are both α-subunit inhibitors and β-subunit allosteric effectors, whereas indole-3-acetyl-l-valine is only an α-subunit inhibitor (Marabotti, A., Cozzini, P., and Mozzarelli, A. (2000) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 1476, 287–299). The crystal structures of tryptophan synthase complexed with indole-3-acetylglycine and indole-3-acetyl-l-aspartic acid show that both ligands bind to the active site such that the carboxylate moiety is positioned similarly as the phosphate group of the natural substrates. As a consequence, the residues of the α-active site that interact with the ligands are the same as observed in the indole 3-glycerolphosphate-enzyme complex. Ligand binding leads to closure of loop αL6 of the α-subunit, a key structural element of intersubunit communication. This is in keeping with the allosteric role played by these compounds. The structure of the enzyme complex with indole-3-acetyl-l-valine is quite different. Due to the hydrophobic lateral chain, this molecule adopts a new orientation in the α-active site. In this case, closure of loop αL6 is no longer observed, in agreement with its functioning only as an inhibitor of the α-subunit reaction."

Biochem. 1994; 219: 953-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar)). Detailed amino acid sequence alignments revealed that TS can be grouped into a plant and a fungal subfamily (7.Laber B. Maurer W. Hanke C. Grafe S. Ehlert S. Messerschmidt A. Clausen T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 263: 212-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The former one (class I subfamily) comprises TS from higher plants, cyanobacteria, archaebacteria, and the eubacterial groups of Mycobacteria, Aquificaceae, and Bacillus species. The second subfamily (class II subfamily) contains the enzymes from fungi and from the eubacterial groups of Proteobacteria and corneyform bacteria. Only 5 from ∼500 residues are invariant between both subfamilies, including the PLP-binding lysine as part of a phenylalanine-lysine-aspartate consensus sequence. During the last decades, TS was purified and characterized from several bacteria and fungi (8.Flavin M. Slaughter C. J. Biol.

In plants, the substrate of TS, OPHS, is the branching point for threonine and methionine biosynthesis. Flux coordination between both synthetic pathways is accomplished by allosteric activation of plant threonine synthase. The allosteric effector is S-adenosyl methionine (SAM) (14.Madison J.T. Thompson J.F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1976; 71: 684-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 15.Thoen A. Rognes S.E. Aarnes H. Plant Sci. Lett. 1978; 13: 113-119Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar), a product of methionine decomposition. When the intracellular levels of methionine and SAM are high, TS partitions OPHS away from methionine toward threonine synthesis. TS from higher plants occurs in solution as homodimers of about 110 kDa, and detailed studies with the A. thaliana (aTS) enzyme indicated that the extended N terminus is responsible for allosteric activation (7.Laber B. Maurer W. Hanke C. Grafe S. Ehlert S. Messerschmidt A. Clausen T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 263: 212-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 16.Curien G. Job D. Douce R. Dumas R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 13212-13221Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). In bacteria and fungi, homoserine is the last common precursor of threonine and methionine, and the activity of TS seems not to be regulated by any effector. Instead, homoserine kinase is feedback-inhibited by threonine (17.Theze J. Kleidman L. Saintgir I. J. Bacteriol. 1974; 118: 577-581Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18.Burr B. Walker J. Truffabachi P. Cohen G.N. Eur. J. Biochem. 1976; 62: 519-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). TS from the fungal class are unique among PLP-dependent enzymes, because they fulfill their physiological function in monomeric state (8.Flavin M. Slaughter C. J. Biol. Chem. 1960; 235: 1103-1108Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10.Parsot C. Cossart P. Saintgirons I. Cohen G.N. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 7331-7345Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Recently, the crystal structure of the aTS apoprotein structure has been solved (19.Thomazeau K. Curien G. Dumas R. Biou V. Protein Sci. 2001; 10: 638-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) indicating its domain organization and its quaternary assembly. However, neither the PLP cofactor nor the allosteric activator SAM could be identified in the highly disordered active site of aTS, restricting mechanistic conclusions that could be derived from the structural data. Because threonine biosynthesis is restricted to bacteria, fungi, and plants, TS is an interesting target enzyme for the development of novel antibiotics and herbicides. Consequently, a number of substrate analogues have been tested as putative mechanism-based inhibitors of TS (7.Laber B. Maurer W. Hanke C. Grafe S. Ehlert S. Messerschmidt A. Clausen T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 263: 212-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 20.Farrington G.K. Kumar A. Shames S.L. Ewaskiewicz J.I. Ash D.E. Wedler F.C. Arch. Biochem.

As a first step toward structure-based drug design, we report here the crystal structure of TS from Saccharomyces cerevisiae (yTS) at 2.7 Å resolution. This is the first structure of a PLP enzyme that is active as monomer. Furthermore, comparison with related enzymes and modeling of the physiological enzyme-substrate complex give new insight into the reaction mechanism of threonine synthases. Briefly, the PCR-amplified S. cerevisiae thrC gene was subcloned into the Novagen pET22b(+) vector NdeI/XhoI restriction sites and transformed into Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) cells via electroporation. Transformed bacteria were grown in Luria broth supplemented with 100 mg liter−1 ampicillin (LB/Amp), induced with 0.5 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, and harvested after 3 h of induction. The protein was purified in a three-step procedure. Frozen cells were ruptured by sonification, and the supernatant was loaded onto a DEAE-Sepharose FF column buffered with 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, 2 mm EDTA, and 10 μm PLP (buffer A). The flow-through containing yTS was collected and ammonium sulfate (AS) was added up to a concentration of 1.3 m. The protein was charged on a phenyl-Sepharose-HP column equilibrated with 1.3 m AS in buffer A and eluted with a linear gradient from 1.3 to 0.25 m AS in buffer A. Fractions containing yTS were subjected to size-exclusion chromatography (Sephacryl S-200 HR, 10 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, 10 μm PLP). To perform a selenomethionine (SeMet) multiple-wavelength anomalous dispersion experiment, the yTS enzyme was expressed in the (met−) E. coli strain B834(DE3)(hsd metB), growing in new minimal medium (NMM (22.Budisa N. Steipe B. Demange P. Eckerskorn C. Kellermann J. Huber R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 230: 788-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar)). To overcome the problem of methionine incorporation and of slow growth due to the presence of toxic SeMet, bacteria grown overnight in LB/Amp were harvested by centrifugation, washed and resuspended in NMM, and used to inoculate 10 liters of NMM. Induction of overexpression and purification of SeMet-yTS was performed as described for the native protein. The level of SeMet incorporation in purified yTS was almost 100%, as determined by electrospray mass spectroscopy. Prior to crystallization, the protein was concentrated with Centripreps to 10 mg ml−1. Crystals were grown at 4 °C by the sitting-drop, vapor diffusion method with 0.1 m Hepes/NaOH, pH 7.6, 20% polyethylene glycol 4000, and 10% dioxane as crystallization liquor in a 2:1 ratio (3 μl of protein solution and 1.5 μl of reservoir). Drops were pipetted in CrysChem plates containing a volume of 500 μl in the reservoir. In the case of SeMet-yTS, successful conditions were similar to those of the native protein with the difference that a mixture of 0.1 m BaCl2 and 20% benzamidine was used as additive instead of dioxane. During the crystallization trials of yTS, two main problems were encountered: (i) obtainment of single non-twinned crystals, and (ii) slow crystal growth. Unfortunately, both problems could not be overcome by other crystallization techniques (e.g. seeding). Both native and SeMet-yTS crystallized in the monoclinic space group P21with almost identical unit cell parameters, a = 97.6 Å, b = 52.5 Å, c = 109.5 Å, β = 99.6° and a = 95.3 Å, b = 51.6 Å, c = 106.9 Å, β = 99.6°, respectively. Assuming two monomers per asymmetric unit, the Matthews parameter (23.Matthews B.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1968; 33: 491-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (7927) Google Scholar) for the yTS crystals was calculated as VM = 2.4 Å3 Da−1 corresponding to a solvent content of 45%. The cryoprotectant consisted of the crystallization solution supplemented with 16% (v/v) of 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol. Crystals were soaked for a few seconds in the cryobuffer and then frozen in a nitrogen stream at 100 K (Oxford Cryosystems Cryostream). With the selenium-substituted crystals, a three-wavelength data experiment was performed from a single crystal to 2.7 Å resolution at the BW6 synchrotron beamline at Deutsches Elektronen Synchrotron (Hamburg, Germany) on an MAR345 image plate. Three data sets were collected: one at the SeMet f""-maximum (λ1 = 0.9874 Å), the second data set at the f′-minimum (λ2 = 0.98 Å), and remote data (λ3 = 0.92 Å) to maximize the anomalous f"" and the disperse f′ contributions of the K-shell absorption edge of selenium. Data were processed and scaled using the programs DENZO and SCALEPACK (24.Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38617) Google Scholar). Anomalous difference Patterson maps were calculated from the f"" data set and allowed identification of twelve selenium sites using the program RSPS (25.Collaborative Computational Project 4Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19797) Google Scholar). The selenium sites were refined with SHARP (26.La Fortelle E.D. Irwin J.J. Bricogne G. Crystallogr. Comput. 1997; 7: 1-9Google Scholar) and used to calculate protein phases and electron densities. After solvent flattening with SOLOMON (27.Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G.W. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1996; 52: 30-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (1142) Google Scholar) the electron density showed several secondary structure elements and allowed building the molecular mask with MAMA (28.Kleywegt G.J. Jones T.A. Bailey S. Hubbard R. Waller D. From First Map to Final Model. SERC Daresbury Laboratory, Warrington1994: 59-66Google Scholar). Using NCS operators extracted from the heavy atom sites with FINDNCS (29.Lu G.G. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1999; 32: 365-368Crossref Scopus (37) Google Scholar), a 2-fold averaged map, in which almost the complete backbone could be inserted, was calculated with AVE (28.Kleywegt G.J.

Molecular Replacement. SERC Daresbury Laboratory, Warrington1992: 91-105Google Scholar). The model building was performed using the program O (31.Jones T.A. Kjelgaard O-The Manual. Uppsala, Sweden1991Google Scholar). After building the first monomer with a poly-alanine chain and including some of the side chains, the model was extended to the second monomer with the NCS operator. Most of the remaining side chains were included in the model after a rigid body and positional minimization with CNS (32.Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16979) Google Scholar) using the protein parameter set of Engh and Huber (33.Engh R.A. Huber R. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 392-400Crossref Scopus (2548) Google Scholar). Bulk solvent, overall anisotropic B-factor corrections, and NCS restraints were introduced depending on the behavior of the free R-factor index. Simulated annealing, individual B-factor refinement, and three rounds of automatic water building and deleting steps were followed by a visual inspection of the resulting 2Fo − Fc and Fo − Fc electron density maps. After several cycles, the refinement converged at a R-factor of 21.2% with an Rfree of 25.2%. All refinement procedures were performed using the maximum-likelihood target (34.Adams P.D. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Brunger A.T. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 181-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Molecular modeling was done using the modules Viewer, Builder, Docking, Delphi, and Discover3 of the program package Insight II (Version 97.0, MSI, Los Angeles, CA). One monomer of the refined yTS x-ray structure was chosen as the starting point for model building and energy minimization of the modeled complex. OPHS and subsequently its external aldimine with PLP were generated and positioned into the active site based on the binding of aminoethoxy vinylglycine in cystathionine β-lyase (35.Clausen T. Huber R. Messerschmidt A. Pohlenz H.D. Laber B. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12633-12643Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The Consistent Valence Forcefield of Insight II program was used for energy minimization with Discover3, which was run over 1000 minimization steps until convergence (0.1 kcal/mol tolerance). The protein monomer and the ligand molecule were minimized simultaneously. Bright yellow crystals of yTS were obtained in the monoclinic space group P21 with two molecules in the asymmetric unit, corresponding to a solvent content of 45%. The structure of yTS was solved by the multiwavelength anomalous dispersion method using incorporated selenomethionine (SeMet) as an anomalous scatterer. The original density obtained with SHARP (26.La Fortelle E.D. Irwin J.J. Bricogne G. Crystallogr. Comput. 1997; 7: 1-9Google Scholar) was improved by density modification protocols implemented in SOLOMON (27.Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G.W. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1996; 52: 30-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (1142) Google Scholar) and 2-fold real-space averaging with AVE (28.Kleywegt G.J. Jones T.A. Bailey S. Hubbard R. Waller D. From First Map to Final Model. SERC Daresbury Laboratory, Warrington1994: 59-66Google Scholar, 30.Jones T.A. Dodson E.J. Gover S. Wolf W. Molecular Replacement. SERC Daresbury Laboratory, Warrington1992: 91-105Google Scholar). The PLP cofactor was inserted during the last round of model refinement when its orientation could be unequivocally derived from the 2Fo− Fc omit density (Fig. 1a). The final model comprises 2 yTS monomers, 2 PLP molecules, and 334 water molecules and displays good stereochemistry (Table I). The two yTS molecules are related by a non-crystallographic 2-fold axis, and a superposition performed with the program O (31.Jones T.A. Kjelgaard O-The Manual. Uppsala, Sweden1991Google Scholar) resulted in a root mean square (r.m.s.) deviation of 0.2 Å for 509 Cα main-chain atoms.Table IData collection, phasing, and refinement statisticsf″f′RemoteData collection Wavelength (Å)0.97840.980.92 Unit cella = 95.3 Å, b = 53.6 Å, c = 106.9 Å, α = 90°, β = 99.7°, γ = 90° Resolution range (Å)20–2.7 Total reflections145,80668,65497,212 Unique reflections54,31245,95653,902 Completeness (%)98.8 (97.3)aValues in parentheses correspond to the highest resolution shell 2.8–2.7 Å.83.2 (68.6)97.0 (91.3) 〈I/ς(I)〉16.8 (4.6)11.7 (2.5)10.89 (2.1) RmergebRmerge = Σhkl‖〈I〉 −I‖/Σhkl‖I‖.(%)6.3 (17.2)5.8 (19.4)6.2 (28.5)Phasing Phasing power,cIsomorphous phasing power = Σn‖FH‖/Σn‖E‖ where ‖FH‖ is the calculated structure-factor amplitude of the heavy-atom structure and E is the residual lack of closure error.

Open table in a new tab In the final electron density, most of the 514 residues from both monomers were clearly defined. Only the electron density of residues 146–151, 228–233, and 513–514 was of insufficient quality to construct them. Therefore, these residues are omitted from the model. Similarly, the side chains of residues 219–227 were highly disordered. Interestingly, the segment 219–233 precedes the residues of the active site, which appear to be involved in substrate binding. Thus the flexibility of this segment seems to be of functional importance. The remaining disordered regions are highly solvent-exposed and not fixed by any intramolecular interaction. Furthermore, they are not involved in any crystallographic contacts. During the refinement the R-factor dropped from 43.8 to 21.2%, while the free R-factor decreased continuously from 45.0 to 25.2%. In the Ramachandran plot, calculated with PROCHECK (36.Laskowski R.A. Macarthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar), 84.3% of the residues lie in the most favored, 13.9% in the additional allowed, and 1.1% in the generously allowed regions. One residue, Val-96, is found to have a forbidden combination of dihedral angles of the peptide backbone. However, the electron density of this residue is unambiguous. Val-96 is part of a tight β-turn wedged between several bulky residues that define its orientation. Because this β-turn is located far off the active site (∼20 Å) and does not interact with any active site residue, the Ramachandran outlier Val-96 seems to be of structural importance. Both crystallographic and non-crystallographic contact surfaces are small (<0.5% of the 40,135 Å2 total surface area). The most intimate contacts were observed between the two molecules in the asymmetric unit. At the corresponding interface, residues Glu-72, Asp-77, Ala-78, and Lys-81 and some well-defined water molecules undergo a few polar interactions establishing a small delimited interaction patch. Therefore, the crystal structure of yTS confirms biochemical results indicating that the monomer is indeed the biocatalytically active form of fungal TS. The dimensions of the globular yTS monomer are ∼64 × 62 × 58 Å3. The overall fold of yTS is presented schematically together with a surface presentation and a ribbon plot in Fig. 1 (b and c), the participating residues in Table II. The structure can be described in terms of three functionally and spatially different domains A, B and C: a small N-terminal domain (A), the PLP-binding domain, which comprises also the C terminus of the polypeptide chain (B), and the so-called large domain (C). Regarding the amino acid sequence of yTS, domains B and C are not sequential. While domain A contains residues 1–94, B is composed of residues 120–262 and 477–512, and the C domain comprises residues 95–119 and 263–476. Common to all domains is an open α/β sandwich structure as a central building element. The N-terminal domain consists of a two-stranded antiparallel β-sheet comprising β-strands +βa and −βb. These strands are connected by a short α-helix, α1, and are followed by helices α2, α3, and α4, which pack on the solvent-accessible side of the sheet. The PLP-binding B domain contains a five-stranded parallel β-sheet (+βh, +βe, +βf, +βg, and +βo) that is shielded from solvent by helices α5, α6, and α7 on one side and helices α8 and α20 on the other side. The PLP cofactor is bound at the N-terminal end of helix α5, which is the longest helix in the entire structure, constructed by 22 amino acids corresponding to a length of 38 Å. The cofactor is covalently attached to the ε-amino group of Lys-124 yielding the internal aldimine frequently observed in PLP-dependent enzymes (37.Christen P. Metzler D.E. Transaminases. John Wiley & Sons, New York1985Google Scholar). Domain C displays a complex architecture, which can be described as a combined β-sheet with an in-between helix. The mainly parallel six-stranded β-sheet, −βd, +βc, +βi, +βn, +βj, and +βm, is separated by helix α11 from the short, antiparallel β-sheet, +βk and −βl. Both sheets are flanked by helices α10, α12, α13, α14, α15, and α16.Table IISecondary structure nomenclatureβa9–11α10280–292α121–28βj298–303βb36–38α11306–315α246–53βk316–319α358–70α12338–352α477–89α13356–372βc99–101β1375–378βd110–115α14380–388α5123–145βm390–395βe154–160α15397–411α6163–173α16421–438βf178–184βn443–449α7191–200α17456–464βg205–211α18471–476α8214–227α19478–485βh236–239βo492–494α9244–262α20498–507βi270–276 Open table in a new tab At the individual domain interfaces, both main-chain and side-chain atoms are involved in a multitude of polar and hydrophobic interactions. The A–C domain interface resembles a heterodomain αβα sandwich. Helices α12 and α13 of domain C constitute one α-layer flanking the β-sheet of domain A on one side. Numerous hydrogen bonds and one strong salt bridge between Arg-12 and Glu-340 were observed at this interface. The interactions between domains A and B are established by a mixed four-helix bundle comprising helices α3, α4, α5, and α9, which binds helix α1 at its center. A large cluster of hydrophobic residues forms the core of this interaction patch that is enclosed by a total of 12 hydrogen bonds and two salt bridges. The third interdomain contact between B and C is observed at the C-terminal ends of the individual β-sheets. Similar to the other domain interfaces, several hydrogen bonds are formed between the two large domains. Furthermore, the non-sequential construction couples both domains closely to each other. In summary, an intensive net of interactions defines the orientation of domains A, B and C relative to each other, thereby restricting domain flexibility and reorientation. Although the active unit of the β-family PLP enzymes is the monomer, i.e. the active site exhibits no contributions from the neighboring subunit, most of the β-family enzymes exist as dimers or tetramers. Presumably, oligomerization is a prerequisite for allosteric regulation. Consistently, regulatory domains have been identified for the structurally characterized TDA, OASS, TRPS, and CBS and the plant threonine synthase aTS. Although the activity of fungal TS is not regulated by any known effector molecule, the dimeric plant TS is subject to positive allosteric regulation by SAM (14.Madison J.T. Thompson J.F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1976; 71: 684-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 15.Thoen A. Rognes S.E. Aarnes H. Plant Sci. Lett. 1978; 13: 113-119Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar). To illustrate these activation differences and to determine the main structural differences of threonine synthase of classes I and II, a detailed structural comparison was performed between yTS and the recently determined crystal structure of aTS. The sequence identity shared by the enzymes from A. thaliana and S. cerevisiae is 23%. Several of the conserved residues of the two central β-sheets were chosen to determine the initial superposition matrix with the program O, which subsequently was improved by extending the alignment to the overall structure resulting in an overall r.m.s. deviation of 2.05 Å for 270 Cαs (Fig. 2a). Most of the central part of the yTS structure, comprising main regions from all three domains, is conserved in aTS. Structural differences arise generally by the incorporation of extra secondary structure elements. Particularly, α13, βl, and α14 of yTS have no counterparts in aTS. Furthermore, the N-terminal domain adopts a completely different fold in both subfamilies. In yTS, these extra structural elements interact with each other and bury the regions that set up the dimer interface of aTS, thus explaining the differences in the oligomeric states within the subfamilies inside the TS family"
https://openalex.org/W1995686191,"Tryptophan synthase catalyzes the last two steps in the biosynthesis of the amino acid tryptophan. The enzyme is an αββα complex in mesophilic microorganisms. The α-subunit (TrpA) catalyzes the cleavage of indoleglycerol phosphate to glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate and indole, which is channeled to the active site of the associated β-subunit (TrpB1), where it reacts with serine to yield tryptophan. The TrpA and TrpB1 proteins are encoded by the adjacent trpA and trpB1 genes in thetrp operon. The genomes of many hyperthermophilic microorganisms, however, contain an additional trpB2 gene located outside of the trp operon. To reveal the properties and potential physiological role of TrpB2, the trpA,trpB1, and trpB2 genes of Thermotoga maritima were expressed heterologously in Escherichia coli, and the resulting proteins were purified and characterized. TrpA and TrpB1 form the familiar αββα complex, in which the two different subunits strongly activate each other. In contrast, TrpB2 forms a β2-homodimer that has a high catalytic efficiencyk cat/K mindolebecause of a very lowK mindole but does not bind to TrpA . These results suggest that TrpB2 acts as an indole rescue protein, which prevents the escape of this costly hydrophobic metabolite from the cell at the high growth temperatures of hyperthermophiles.

FEBS Lett. 1999; 452: 22-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). It is interesting to identify those molecular adaptations that allow proper function of metabolism under these extreme conditions (2Daniel R.M. Cowan D.A. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2000; 57: 250-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). In particular, enzymes from hyperthermophiles must be extremely thermostable, and labile metabolites must be protected from spontaneous degradation (3Jaenicke R. Böhm G. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1998; 8: 738-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar, 4Sterner R. Liebl W. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2001; 36: 39-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar, 5Vieille C. Zeikus G.J. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2001; 65: 1-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (1645) Google Scholar). The pathway of tryptophan biosynthesis from chorismate comprises seven catalytic functions (6Yanofsky C. Miles E. Bauerle R. Kirschner K. Creighton T.E. The Encyclopedia of Molecular Biology. 4. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1999: 2276-2689Google Scholar). In most organisms, the trp genes are organized in operons, which guarantees their coordinated expression in response to the amount of tryptophan available in the growth medium (7Yanofsky C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 1-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The order of the trp operon from the hyperthermophileThermotoga maritima trpE(GD)CFBA (8Sterner R. Dahm A. Darimont B. Ivens A. Liebl W. Kirschner K. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 395-4404Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar) resembles the organization of the trp operon from Escherichia coli (9Yanofsky C. Platt T. Crawford I.P.

The last four steps of tryptophan biosynthesis are catalyzed by phosphoribosyl anthranilate isomerase (TrpF),1 indoleglycerol phosphate synthase (TrpC), and the α- and β-subunits of tryptophan synthase (TrpA and TrpB1, respectively). It was shown that TrpF and TrpC from T. maritima are far more thermostable than their homologs from mesophiles (10Sterner R. Kleeman G.R. Szadkowski H. Lustig A. Hennig M. Kirschner K. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 2000-2008Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 11Merz A. Knöchel T. Jansonius J.N. Kirschner K. J. Mol.

Chem. 2002; 277: 8626-8634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Moreover, both TrpF and TrpC from T. maritima are catalytically more active at 80 °C than the orthologous enzymes from E. coli at 37 °C, thus outrunning the unproductive hydrolysis of their thermolabile substrates under physiological conditions (10Sterner R. Kleeman G.R. Szadkowski H. Lustig A. Hennig M. Kirschner K. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 2000-2008Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 11Merz A. Knöchel T. Jansonius J.N. Kirschner K. J. Mol.

Less is known about the specific structural and functional adaptations of the tryptophan synthase from T. maritima, which catalyzes the conversion of indoleglycerol phosphate (IGP) and serine to tryptophan (16Dahm A. Molecular Evolution of Thermostable TIM-Barrel Enzymes of Tryptophan Biosynthesis. University of Basel, Switzerland1997Google Scholar). The tryptophan synthases characterized so far consist of two TrpA (α) and two TrpB1 (β) structural entities, which are organized either as four monofunctional subunits or as two bifunctional αβ-subunits (17Miles E.W. Adv. Enzymol. Rel. Areas. Mol. Biol. 1991; 64: 93-173PubMed Google Scholar). The x-ray structure at 2.8 Å resolution of the tryptophan synthase from Salmonella typhimurium revealed an αββα quaternary structure (18Hyde C.C. Ahmed S.A. Padlan E.A. Miles E.W. Davies D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 17857-17871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The structure of isolated TrpA from Pyrococcus furiosus confirmed that this enzyme has a (βα)8-barrel fold (19Yamagata Y. Ogasahara K. Hioki Y. Lee S.J. Nakagawa A. Nakamura H. Ishida M. Kuramitsu S. Yutani K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11062-11071Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), which is the most frequently encountered topology among single domain proteins and is also adopted by TrpF and TrpC (20Wierenga R.K. FEBS Lett. 2001; 492: 193-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar, 21Höcker B. Jürgens C. Wilmanns M. Sterner R. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 2001; 12: 376-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). TrpB1 consists of two domains, which both comprise a central open β-sheet that is surrounded by α-helices (18Hyde C.C. Ahmed S.A. Padlan E.A. Miles E.W. Davies D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 17857-17871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). TrpA catalyzes the aldolytic cleavage of IGP to glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (GA3P) and indole, which condenses with serine at the active site of TrpB1 to yield tryptophan (Fig.1). The hydrophobic intermediate indole passes directly from the α-site to the β-site via a long tunnel, which prevents its loss from the cell by diffusion across the cytoplasmic membrane (22Miles E.W. Rhee S. Davies D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12193-12196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar, 23Huang X. Holden H.M. Raushel F.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 149-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). There is pronounced allosteric communication between the TrpA and TrpB1 subunits from E. coli, which is reflected in a mutual activation of their catalytic activities which keeps the two reactions in phase and prevents accumulation of indole (24Pan P. Woehl E. Dunn M.F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 22-27Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). It appears that the αββα complex is in an equilibrium between a low activity “open” and a high activity “closed” state, which is shifted by allosteric ligands and monovalent cations (25Fan Y.X. McPhie P. Miles E.W. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 4692-4703Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The basis of the corresponding conformational transitions has been characterized by x-ray structure analysis of a number of enzyme-ligand complexes (26Rhee S. Parris K.D. Hyde C.C. Ahmed S.A.

Recently, the genome sequencing of T. maritima (31Nelson K.E. Clayton R.A. Gill S.R. Gwinn M.L. Dodson R.J. Haft D.H. Hickey E.K. Peterson J.D. Nelson W.C. Ketchum K.A. McDonald L. Utterback T.R.

Nature. 1999; 399: 323-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (1212) Google Scholar) and of other hyperthermophiles has identified a trpB2 gene outside of the trp operon. To reveal the roles in tryptophan biosynthesis of the two different TrpB variants, tmtrpA, tmtrpB1, and tmtrpB2 fromT. maritima were expressed heterologously in E. coli, and the corresponding protein products were purified and characterized by hydrodynamic measurements and steady-state enzyme kinetics. The results show that tmTrpB1 associates with tmTrpA to an αββα complex, in which the two different subunits strongly activate each other. tmTrpB2, which does not bind to tmTrpA but is catalytically highly active, has an extremely lowKm value for indole. It appears that tmTrpB1 has the same role in tryptophan biosynthesis as the known TrpB1 enzymes from mesophiles, whereas tmTrpB2 acts as a salvage protein that prevents the loss of indole at the physiological growth temperatures of hyperthermophiles. Preparation of DNA, amplification, extraction, digestion with restriction endonucleases, ligation, and sequencing were performed as described (32Beismann-Driemeyer S. Sterner R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20387-20396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The genes tmtrpA and tmtrpB1 were amplified by PCR using the plasmid pDStmtrpAB (16Dahm A. Molecular Evolution of Thermostable TIM-Barrel Enzymes of Tryptophan Biosynthesis. University of Basel, Switzerland1997Google Scholar) as template. For amplification of tmtrpA, the oligonucleotides 5′-GGTTCATATGAAGGGCTTTATTGCATACATC-3′ with a NdeI site (in boldface type) and 5′-CGATGAATTCTCATTTTCCGAGGAGTTCTTTT-3′ with anEcoRI site (in boldface type) were used as 5′- and 3′-primers, respectively. The tmtrpB1 gene was amplified with the primers 5′-GGATCATATGAAAGGTTACTTCGGTCCTTA-3′ and 5′-CCGTGAATTCTCATCTTATCCTCTCCCTGACGTA-3′, again introducingNdeI and EcoRI sites (in boldface type). Using the two newly introduced restriction sites, the amplified DNA fragments were cloned into different pET vectors (Stratagene), yielding the plasmids pET21a-tmtrpA and pET24a-tmtrpB1. The gene tmtrpB2 was amplified by PCR using genomic DNA ofT. maritima as the template. The primers 5′-ACCGCATATGAGAATTGTTGTGAA-3′ and 5′-CAGGAATTCAAGCTTTCACACGTACGCTGT-3′ were used, introducingNdeI and HindIII sites, respectively (in boldface type). The amplified DNA fragment was cloned into the vector pET21a to yield the plasmid pET21a-tmtrpB2. All inserts were sequenced entirely to exclude inadvertent PCR mutations. Heterologous expression of tmtrpA was conducted in E. coli BL21(DE3) cells containing the plasmid pET21a-tmtrpA. For reasons unknown so far, tmtrpA (and tmtrpB1 and tmtrpB2) are being expressed in the absence of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. Therefore, the cells were grown overnight at 37 °C in 1 liter of LB medium supplemented with 150 μg/ml ampicillin but without the addition of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. The cell pellet resulting from centrifugation was resuspended in 10 mmpotassium phosphate buffer at pH 7.5 and lysed by sonification (Branson Sonifier W-250, 3 × 3 min, 50% pulse, 0 °C). According to SDS-PAGE, 90% of tmTrpA was found in the soluble fraction of the cell extract. 100 units of benzonase (Merck) was added to this fraction, which was then incubated for 1 h at 37 °C to degrade nucleic acids and subsequently for 20 min at 75 °C to denature the benzonase. The resulting suspension was centrifuged (Sorvall SS34, 13,000 rpm, 30 min, 4 °C), and the pellet, which contained heat-labile host proteins, was discarded. The supernatant was loaded on an anion exchange column (Mono Q, 2 × 11 cm, Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) that was equilibrated with 10 mmpotassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, at room temperature. The column was washed with 4 column volumes of equilibration buffer, and bound proteins were eluted with a linear gradient of 0–750 mmpotassium chloride at pH 7.5. tmTrpA eluted at 150–200 mmpotassium chloride, as judged from SDS-PAGE and conductivity measurements. Sufficiently pure fractions were pooled, concentrated using Centricon-10 devices (Millipore), and dialyzed against 10 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, containing 50 mm potassium chloride. The protein was shock frozen in liquid nitrogen at a concentration of 10 mg/ml. The purification yielded 50 mg of tmTrpA out of 1 liter of cell culture with a purity of about 99% as judged by SDS-PAGE. For expression of tmtrpB1 and tmtrpB2, E. coli BL21(DE3) cells containing the plasmids pET24a-tmtrpB1 and pET21a-tmtrpB2 were used. Cells were grown as described for tmtrpA, with the exceptions that kanamycin instead of ampicillin was added for maintenance of pET24a-tmtrpB1 and 20 °C instead of 37 °C was used, which increased the fraction of soluble protein to about 40% for tmTrpB1 and about 10% for tmTrpB2 (33Kopetzki E. Schumacher G. Buckel P. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1989; 216: 149-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Harvesting of cells, cell lysis, incubation with benzonase, heat precipitation of host proteins, and anion exchange chromatography were performed as described for tmTrpA, with the exception that the buffer solutions were supplemented with 40 μm pyridoxal 5′-phosphate (PLP). Both tmTrpB proteins eluted from the Mono Q column at about 150–200 mm potassium chloride. Fractions containing either tmTrpB protein were pooled, concentrated using Centricon-10 devices, and loaded on a gel filtration column (Superdex 75, Hiload 26/60, Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) equilibrated with 50 mm potassium phosphate at pH 7.5, containing 300 mm potassium chloride and 40 μm PLP. The tmTrpB proteins, which eluted with a purity above 95% as judged from SDS-PAGE, were shock frozen in liquid nitrogen at concentrations of 4 mg/ml (tmTrpB1) and 1.5 mg/ml (tmTrpB2). From 1 liter of cell culture, 16 mg of tmTrpB1 and 6 mg of tmTrpB2 were obtained. The tmgapdh gene cloned into the plasmid pKM1 was expressed using E. coli BL21(DE3) cells (34Pappenberger G. Schurig H. Jaenicke R. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 274: 676-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The cells were grown at 37 °C in 1 liter of LB medium supplemented with 150 μg/ml ampicillin, inducted with 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside atA 600 = 0.6, and incubated overnight. Harvesting of cells, cell lysis, and incubation with benzonase were performed in a way similar to that described for tmTrpA, but a 50 mm EPPS buffer at pH 7.5 was used instead of 10 mm potassium phosphate. After heat precipitation of host proteins at 75 °C for 30 min, tmGAPDH was pure to 90%. The protein was dialyzed against 10 mm EPPS buffer at pH 7.5, containing 10 mm potassium chloride, concentrated to 5.2 mg/ml using Centricon-10 devices, and shock frozen in liquid nitrogen. From 1 liter of cell culture, 14 mg of tmGAPDH was obtained. Purification of proteins was followed by electrophoresis on 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels using the system of Laemmli (35Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207031) Google Scholar) and staining with Coomassie Blue. The concentration of tmTrpA was determined using the molar extinction coefficient ε280 = 18.9 mm−1cm−1, which was calculated from the amino acid sequence (36Pace C.N. Vajdos F. Fee L. Grimsley G. Gray T. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 2411-2423Crossref PubMed Scopus (3437) Google Scholar). The concentrations of tmTrpB1 and tmTrpB2 were determined according to Bradford (37Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (215700) Google Scholar) because the strong absorption at 280 nm of the bound cofactor PLP impeded a reliable calculation of ε280 from the amino acid sequences. Analytical gel filtration was performed at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min on a Superdex 75 column (1 × 30 cm) that was equilibrated with 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer at pH 7.5 at 25 °C containing 300 mm potassium chloride. Apparent molecular masses were calculated from the corresponding elution volumes, using a calibration curve that was obtained with standard proteins. Sedimentation velocity and sedimentation equilibrium runs were performed at 20 °C in a Beckman analytical ultracentrifuge (model Optima XLA), monitoring the absorption at 277 nm. The velocity runs were performed at 54,000 (tmTrpA) or 52,000 rpm (other proteins) and the equilibrium runs at 22,000 rpm (tmTrpA) or 8,000 rpm (other proteins). The proteins were dissolved in 100 mm potassium phosphate at pH 7.5, containing 180 mm potassium chloride and 40 μm PLP. For analysis of the equilibrium runs, a floating base-line computer program that adjusts the baseline absorbance (A) was used to obtain the best linear fit of lnAversus the square of the radial distance (r 2). Molecular masses were calculated assuming a partial specific volume of 0.73 ml/g. The cleavage of IGP to GA3P and indole (A-reaction; Fig. 1) was measured under steady-state conditions between 30 and 60 °C in a coupled enzymatic assay (38Creighton T.E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1970; 13: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). In this assay, arsenate and GA3P produced by tmTrpA were converted by tmGAPDH into 1-arseno-3-phosphoglycerate upon reduction of NAD+ to NADH. The reaction is irreversible because of the spontaneous hydrolysis of 1-arseno-3-phosphoglycerate into arsenate and 3-phosphoglycerate. Initial velocities were measured by absorption spectroscopy and analyzed using Δε340 (NADH − NAD+) = 6.22 mm−1cm−1. Initial velocities were measured, andV max andK mIGP were determined with a direct linear plot (39Eisenthal R. Cornish-Bowden A. Biochem. J. 1974; 139: 715-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (1237) Google Scholar). The conversion of indole and serine to tryptophan (B-reaction; Fig. 1) catalyzed by tmTrpB1 or tmTrpB2 was measured at 80 °C by absorption spectroscopy and analyzed using Δε290 (Trp − indole) = 1.89 mm−1 cm−1 (40Faeder E.J. Hammes G.G. Biochemistry. 1970; 9: 4043-4049Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Initial velocities were measured as a function of the concentration of either indole or serine, with the other substrate being present at saturating concentrations. In the case of tmTrpB2, entire progress curves at saturating concentrations of serine were analyzed with the integrated form of the Michaelis-Menten equation (41Hommel U. Eberhard M. Kirschner K. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 5429-5439Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), which allowed determination of the upper limit ofK mIND. The conversion of IGP and serine to tryptophan (AB-reaction; Fig. 1) catalyzed by [tmTrpA· tmTrpB1]2 between 30 and 60 °C was followed by absorption spectroscopy and analyzed using Δε290 (Trp − IGP) = 0.56 mm−1 cm−1 (42Brzovic P.S. Ngo K. Dunn M.F. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 3831-3839Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Alternatively, the AB-reaction was followed in a coupled reaction, which is similar to that used to follow the A-reaction (43Lane A.N. Kirschner K. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 479-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Initial velocities were measured as a function of the concentration of either IGP or serine, with the other substrate being present at saturating concentrations. The k cat and Km values of the A- and the AB-reactions determined between 30 and 60 °C were extrapolated to 80 °C by an Arrhenius plot. The genes trpA and trpB1 of the hyperthermophilic bacterium T. maritima are adjacent in thetrp operon (8Sterner R. Dahm A. Darimont B. Ivens A. Liebl W. Kirschner K. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 395-4404Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The sequencing of the whole genome ofT. maritima (31Nelson K.E. Clayton R.A. Gill S.R. Gwinn M.L. Dodson R.J. Haft D.H. Hickey E.K. Peterson J.D. Nelson W.C. Ketchum K.A. McDonald L. Utterback T.R. Malek J.A. Linher K.D. Garrett M.M. Stewart A.M. Cotton M.D. Pratt M.S. Phillips C.A. Richardson D. Heidelberg J. Sutton G.G. Fleischmann R.D. Eisen J.A. White O. Salzberg S.L. Smith H.O. Fraser C.M. Nature. 1999; 399: 323-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (1212) Google Scholar) identified a gene outside of thetrp operon, which has significant sequence similarity totrpB1 and was designated trpB2. It is likely that the trpB2 gene is expressed in T. maritimabecause the upstream region on the genome contains consensus sequences that are typical of bacterial promoters and ribosome binding sites (data not shown). A data base search revealed that trpB2 genes are also present in the genomes of most of the other investigated hyperthermophilic Bacteria and Archaea but are generally absent from the genomes of mesophiles. A phylogenetic tree based on amino acid sequence comparisons shows that TrpB1 and TrpB2 proteins form two separate groups (Fig. 2). Within the two groups, proteins display sequence identities of about 60%, whereas between members from different groups the identities are only about 30%. Most hyperthermophiles contain one TrpB1 and one TrpB2 protein; others, for example Sulfolobus solfataricus, possess two different TrpB2 variants but lack TrpB1. Fig. 3 a presents the amino acid sequence alignment of the two TrpB variants from T. maritima, tmTrpB1 and tmTrpB2, which show an overall identity of 38%. It is evident that those amino acids, which are conserved both in the TrpB1 and TrpB2 sequences, cluster at the putative active sites. In contrast, amino acids that are conserved in only one of the two TrpB groups are distributed along the sequences. The major differences between the two proteins are a long N-terminal extension and two shorter insertions in tmTrpB2, which are located in regions where tmTrpB1 interacts with tmTrpA, as deduced from the structure ofS. typhimurium tryptophan synthase (Fig. 3 b).Figure 3Similarities and differences between tmTrpB1 and tmTrpB2. Panel a, amino acid sequence alignment of tmTrpB1 and tmTrpB2 (excerpt from the multiple sequence alignment, on which the phylogenetic tree of Fig. 2 is based).

Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (6003) Google Scholar). tmTrpA could be produced in soluble form at 37 °C, but tmtrpB1 and tmtrpB2 had to be expressed at 20 °C to suppress in part the formation of insoluble aggregates (33Kopetzki E. Schumacher G. Buckel P. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1989; 216: 149-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The resulting thermostable tmTrpA, tmTrpB1, and tmTrpB2 proteins were purified from the soluble fraction of the cell extract, using a heat step to remove thermolabile host proteins followed by ion exchange chromatography. The three proteins were more than 95% pure, as judged from SDS-PAGE (data not shown). The [tmTrpA·tmTrpB1]2 complex was produced by mixing tmTrpA and tmTrpB1 (see below). Analytical gel filtration on a calibrated Superdex 75 HR column was used to test whether tmTrpB1 and tmTrpB2 form a complex with tmTrpA at 25 °C. The results are summarized in Fig.4. Separately, tmTrpA, tmTrpB1, and tmTrpB2 elute as well defined peaks. When tmTrpB1 is mixed with a molar excess of tmTrpA, the tmTrpB1 peak is replaced by a new and faster elution peak, which represents a complex of tmTrpA and tmTrpB1 (Fig.4 a). In contrast, the elution profile of a mixture of tmTrpA and tmTrpB2 excludes any significant complex formation between these proteins (Fig. 4 b). The elution time of separated tmTrpA corresponds to a molecular mass of 26.8 kDa, comparing well with the calculated molecular mass for the monomer (26.7 kDa). The elution times of tmTrpB1 and tmTrpB2, however, correspond to molecular masses of 49.4 and 61.7 kDa, respectively, which are between the calculated molecular masses for the respective monomers (42.9 and 46.4 kDa) and homodimers (85.8 and 92.8 kDa). Analytical ultracentrifugation was therefore performed to clarify the association states of tmTrpB1 and tmTrpB2 and to assess the stoichiometry of the complex between tmTrpA and tmTrpB1 (Table I). Sedimentation velocity runs showed that the separated proteins are homogeneous species, yieldings 20,w values of 2.8 for tmTrpA and 5.4 for both tmTrpB1 and tmTrpB2. The analysis of sedimentation equilibrium runs confirms that separated tmTrpA exists mainly as an α-monomer and shows that both tmTrpB1 and tmTrpB2 are β2-dimers. Runs that were performed with a mixture of tmTrpA and tmTrpB1 show that they form an αββα complex, as observed for other investigated tryptophan synthases (6Yanofsky C. Miles E. Bauerle R.

Substitution of Asp-55 or Met-56 dramatically reduces the apparent affinity for Na+and Li+ in a cation-dependent manner. Conversely, Cys in place of Gly-58 significantly reduces only the apparent proline affinity while substitution of Ser-57 results in a dramatic reduction of the apparent proline and cation affinities. Interestingly, upon increasing the proline concentration the apparent Na+ affinity of Ser-57 replacement mutants converges toward the wild-type value, indicating a close cooperativity between cation and substrate site(s). This notion is supported by the fact that Na+-stimulated site-specific fluorescence labeling of a single Cys at position 57 is completely reversed by the addition of proline. Similar results are obtained upon labeling of a Cys at position 54 or 58. Taken together, these results indicate that Asp-55 and Met-56 are located at or close to the ion-binding site while Ser-54, Ser-57, and Gly-58 may be close to the proline translocation pathway. In addition, the data prod at an involvement of the latter residues in ligand-induced conformational dynamics that are crucial for cation-coupled transport.

Na+/solute symporter family (TC 2.A.21) engineered transporter devoid of all five native Cys residues putative transmembrane domain 4-morpholinoethanesulfonic acid The Na+/solute symporter family (SSF,1 TC 2.A.21) comprises more than 80 similar proteins of pro- and eukaryotic origin (1Reizer J. Reizer A. Saier M.H.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1197: 133-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 2Turk E. Wright E.M. J. Membr.

These integral membrane proteins utilize the Na+electrochemical gradient to drive the coupled uphill transport of a variety of substrates (sugars, amino acids, vitamins, osmolytes, ions,myo-inositol, urea, and water). Among the eukaryotic members of the SSF the Na+/glucose transporter (SGLT1), the Na+/iodide transporter, and the Na+/multivitamin transporter are directly implicated in human disorders (4Prasad P.D.

It has been proposed that all members of this family possess a common topological motif consisting of 13 α-helical transmembrane domains (2Turk E. Wright E.M. J. Membr. Biol. 1997; 159: 1-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 7Jung H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1365: 60-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 8Jung H. Rübenhagen R. Tebbe S.

Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 4831-4837Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). One of the current major challenges in the investigation of these transporters is the identification of regions involved in the binding and translocation of Na+and substrate. Studies on SGLT1 implicate the C-terminal part of the transporter in sugar binding and transport (10Panayotova-Heiermann M. Loo D.D. Kong C.T. Lever J.E. Wright E.M. J. Biol.

FEBS Lett. 1999; 459: 386-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). However, little is known about the role of residues in the N-terminal domain of SSF members, and the coupling mechanism of this class of membrane proteins is well far from understood. To further identify functional important regions we are utilizing PutP of Escherichia coli as a model system. PutP is an integral protein of the cytoplasmic membrane of E. coli. The transporter has been purified, reconstituted into proteoliposomes, and shown to be solely responsible for the coupled translocation of Na+ and proline (13Hanada K. Yamato I. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 7181-7185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Jung H. Tebbe S. Schmid R. Jung K. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11083-11088Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Labeling experiments, random and site-directed mutagenesis have been employed to identify functionally important sites in PutP of E. coli andSalmonella typhimurium (see Ref. 15Jung H. Winkelmann G. Microbial Transport Systems. Wiley-VCH, Weinheim, Germany2001: 47-75Crossref Google Scholar, for a recent review). Recent results from our laboratory indicate the functional importance of putative transmembrane domain (TM) II in cation-coupled proline transport (16Quick M. Jung H. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4631-4636Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 17Quick M. Stölting S. Jung H. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 13523-13529Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 18Quick M. Tebbe S. Jung H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 239: 732-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In particular, Asp-55 located in the center of TM II is the only residue known to be essential for PutP activity (16Quick M. Jung H. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4631-4636Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). While a neutral amino acid completely impairs all types of transport, Glu at this position reduces the apparent Na+ affinity dramatically but has only little effect on proline binding, implying a direct involvement of Asp-55 in Na+ binding. Another residue in TM II, Ser-57, is crucial for high-affinity proline uptake (18Quick M. Tebbe S. Jung H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 239: 732-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Replacement with Ala, Cys, Gly, or Thr decreases the apparent affinity for proline by up to 2 orders of magnitude with little influence on the maximum rate of transport. Furthermore, substitution analysis and site-directed Cys labeling studies of Arg-40, located at the cytoplasmic interphase of TM II suggest that this conserved residue is important for the efficient coupling of ion and proline transport (17Quick M. Stölting S. Jung H. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 13523-13529Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In this vein, data obtained upon substitution of conserved Asp-187 (located in the putative cytoplasmic loop between TM V and VI) indicate that electrostatic interactions of the amino acid side chain at position 187 in PutP with other parts of the transporter and/or the coupling ion are important for active proline transport (19Quick M. Jung H. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 13800-13806Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Based on the initial findings on the role of Asp-55 and Ser-57 in Na+-coupled proline uptake we analyzed the functional importance of amino acids in the vicinity of both residues, namely Ser-54, Met-56, and Gly-58. In addition, former work on Asp-55 and Ser-57 was extended. To this end, we systematically studied the effect of individual amino acid substitution on (i) proline uptake activity, (ii) ion selectivity, and (iii) the influence of ligand binding on the accessibility of Cys individually placed at positions 54 to 58. The results indicate that the region comprising Ser-54 to Gly-58 is particularly crucial for binding and translocation of the coupling ion (Na+ or Li+) and the substrate. Furthermore, it is shown that this part of the protein undergoes functional relevant conformational alterations that are essential for cation-coupled transport. l-[14C]Proline (247 μCi/μmol) was obtained from ICN.

Bacteriol. 1983; 156: 481-486Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) harboring given plasmids was used for overexpression of the putP gene and transport assays. The following plasmids, derivatives of pT7-5 (21Tabor S. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 1074-1078Crossref PubMed Scopus (2455) Google Scholar), containing the lac promoter/operator for expression of theputP gene were used for all gene manipulations: pT7-5/putP and pT7-5/putP(ΔCys), each of which harboring a cassette version of the putP gene encoding PutP wild-type and an engineered transporter devoid of all five native Cys residues (PutP(ΔCys)), respectively (8Jung H.

For overexpression,putP was cloned into plasmid pTrc99a (22Amann E. Ochs B. Abel K.J. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 69: 301-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (877) Google Scholar). Amino acid substitutions were created using a two-step polymerase chain reaction (PCR) protocol with plasmids pT7-5/putP or pT7-5/putP(ΔCys) as templates. Mutagenic primers encoding the desired amino acid substitution, and suitable sense and antisense primers binding up- and downstream, respectively, of the site of substitution were used similarly as described (16Quick M. Jung H. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4631-4636Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 18Quick M. Tebbe S. Jung H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 239: 732-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). PCR fragments were digested with restriction endonucleases ApaI and XbaI and ligated to similarly treated plasmids pT7-5/putP and pT7-5/putP(ΔCys) incubated with alkaline phosphatase to avoid religation of the vector. For overexpression of PutP, the mutatedputP genes were cut with NcoI andHindIII and ligated to similarly treated vector pTrc99a incubated with alkaline phosphatase. The resulting constructs were verified by sequencing double-stranded plasmid DNA using dideoxynucleotide chain termination (23Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52648) Google Scholar) after alkaline denaturation (24Hattori M. Sakaki Y. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 152: 232-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (1053) Google Scholar). Active transport was measured in E. coli WG170 (PutP−A−) harboring derivatives of plasmids pT7-5/putP or pT7-5/putP(ΔCys) encoding PutP with given amino acid replacements. The cells were grown aerobically in Luria-Bertani medium (25Miller J.H. A Short Course in Bacterial Genetics: A Laboratory Manual and Handbook for Escherichia coli and Related Bacteria. Cold Spring Habor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Habor, NY1992Google Scholar) containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin at 37 °C. Overnight cultures were diluted 25-fold and were allowed to grow to an optical density at 420 nm (A 420) of 1.0, followed by induction with 0.5 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 2 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 13,200 ×g for 10 min and washed up to 6 times with 100 mm Tris/Mes, pH 6.0, at 4 °C to reduce the Na+ contamination below 5 μm. For transport assays, cells were resuspended in the same buffer, and adjusted to a total protein concentration of 0.35 mg/ml. Transport of 10 μml-[U-14C]proline (if not otherwise indicated) was assayed under standard test conditions in the presence of 20 mmd-lactate (Na+salt) and 50 mm NaCl or, for determination of the ion dependence on proline uptake (apparent affinities for Na+ and Li+), in the presence of 0.005 to 250 mm NaCl or LiCl at 25 °C using the rapid filtration method as described (16Quick M. Jung H. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4631-4636Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Initial rates of transport were calculated from the initial linear portion of the time course and data were plotted according to Eadie-Hofstee. Standard deviations were determined from at least three independent experiments. E. coli WG170 harboring derivatives of plasmid pTrc99a/putP(ΔCys)encoding PutP(ΔCys) with given amino acid replacements was grown aerobically (500 ml of culture) to an A 420 of 1.5 before induction with 0.5 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and further growth for 2 h. Cells were harvested, washed in 100 mmTris/Mes, pH 7.0, and sonicated for 4 × 30 s using a Branson Sonifier. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 13,200 ×g for 10 min at 4 °C and the supernatant was subjected to ultracentrifugation at 230,000 × g for 45 min at 4 °C. The resulting membrane pellet was washed in 100 mmTris/Mes, pH 7.0, resuspended in the same buffer, and stored in liquid nitrogen until use. After thawing, 150-μl aliquots of the membrane suspension (protein concentration adjusted to 10 mg/ml) were preincubated in the presence or absence of ligand at 25 °C for 10 min. Subsequently, 200 μm fluorescein 5-maleimide was added and incubation was continued for further 10 min. The reactions were stopped by addition of 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol. PutP was solubilized from the membrane and purified by Ni2+-NTA affinity chromatography as recently described (8Jung H. Rübenhagen R. Tebbe S. Leifker K. Tholema N. Quick M. Schmid R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26400-26407Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Equal amounts of protein were subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE. Fluorescein 5-maleimide fluorescence of PutP was visualized using the MultiImagerTM (Bio-Rad, Munich) with an excitation wavelength of 360 nm and quantified by means of the Quantity OneTM or MultiAnalystTM software. After staining the gel with Coomassie Blue the density of the stained bands served to correct the fluorescence values for differences in the amount of protein using the ImageQuantTM software. The corrected fluorescence value of each PutP derivative obtained upon labeling in the absence of ligand was set to 100. Standard deviations were determined from at least three independent experiments. Relative amounts of PutP wild-type and PutP with given amino acid replacements in membranes of E. coli WG170 were estimated by Western blot analysis. Immunoblotting was performed with mouse anti-FLAG IgG against the Flag epitope at the C terminus of each PutP variant followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-linked sheep anti-(mouse IgG) antibody by the enhanced chemiluminescence method as described (18Quick M. Tebbe S. Jung H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 239: 732-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The protein concentration of membrane suspensions was determined by the method of Peterson (26Peterson G.L. Anal. Biochem. 1977; 83: 346-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (7129) Google Scholar). Solubilized protein was quantified according to Bradford (27Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (215990) Google Scholar). Bovine serum albumin was used as standard. Asp-55 and Ser-57 in TM II of PutP were demonstrated to be important for ligand binding and transport (16Quick M. Jung H. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4631-4636Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 18Quick M. Tebbe S. Jung H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 239: 732-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). To elucidate the function of amino acids located in the vicinity of these crucial residues, Ser-54, Met-56, and Gly-58 were individually replaced with Cys by oligonucleotide-directed, site-specific mutagenesis. In addition, Ser-54 was substituted by Ala and Thr. PutP molecules with verified amino acid replacements were subjected to detailed kinetic analyses and site-directed thiol-labeling studies. Other mutants used in this study (PutP-D55C, 2Amino acid replacements are designated as follows. The one-letter amino acid code is used followed by a number indicating the position of the native residue in wild-type PutP. The sequence is followed by a second letter denoting the substitution at this position. -D55E, -D55N, -S57A, -S57C, -S57G, and -S57T) were generated and initially characterized previously (16Quick M. Jung H. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4631-4636Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 18Quick M. Tebbe S. Jung H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 239: 732-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). To determine the effect of the newly generated amino acid substitutions on PutP activity, active transport of proline was assayed under standard test conditions (50 mm Na+, 10 μm proline) by using E. coli WG170 which lacks PutP and PutA (proline dehydrogenase), and therefore, cannot metabolize proline. Cells transformed with plasmids encoding PutP-S54A, -S54C, or -S54T exhibited initial rates and steady-state levels of proline accumulation comparable to those observed for PutP wild-type (Fig.1). Severe effects on Na+-coupled proline uptake were observed upon replacement of Met-56 and Gly-58. In particular the initial rate of proline uptake was reduced below 10% compared with PutP-wild-type (PutP-M56C, 6.7 ± 1.4%, -G58C, 1.9 ± 0.8%), while the steady-state level of proline accumulation was less affected. Relative concentrations of PutP molecules bearing given replacements in membranes of E. coli WG170 were approximated by Western blot analysis using an anti-FLAG-antibody as described (18Quick M. Tebbe S. Jung H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 239: 732-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). PutP-wild-type, -S54A, -S54C, -S54T, -M56C, and -G58C were present in the membrane in comparable amounts (Fig.2). Therefore, the differences in proline uptake kinetics described between wild-type transporter and transporter molecules with given replacements cannot be attributed to defective insertion of the transporter into the membrane or to enhanced proteolytic degradation of the modified proteins subsequent to insertion. Similar observations were made previously for PutP containing substitutions for Glu-55 or Ser-57 (16Quick M. Jung H. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4631-4636Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 18Quick M. Tebbe S. Jung H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 239: 732-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). To further characterize the effect of the individual replacement of amino acids Ser-54 through Gly-58 on PutP function, the apparent proline affinity (K mPro) was determined under Na+ saturation (50 mmNa+). Furthermore, to obtain information on a possible participation of the described region in cation binding and/or coupling of cation and substrate transport, proline uptake was analyzed with varying Na+ or Li+ concentrations. The proline concentration in the latter experiments was 10 μm (5-fold above the apparent K mPro of PutP-wild-type) if not otherwise indicated. The cation concentration causing half-maximum stimulation of proline uptake (K 0.5Na+ or K 0.5Li+) was used as a measure of the apparent cation affinity, while V maxNa+ and V maxLi+correspond to the maximum rates of proline uptake under saturating Na+ or Li+ concentrations.

For determination of the ion specific parameters (K 0.5Na+,K 0.5Li+,V maxNa+,V maxLi+) transport of 10 μm (or 100 μm if indicated)l-[U-14C]proline was measured in the presence of 0.005 to 250 mm NaCl or LiCl at 25 °C. The resulting data were plotted according to Eadie-Hofstee.

Open table in a new tab To determine K mpro, initial rates of l-[U-14C]proline uptake by E. coli WG170 producing either PutP-wild-type or PutP with given replacements were measured in the presence of 50 mm NaCl and 20 mm d-lactate (Na+ salt) at proline concentrations from 0.2 to 1000 μm. For determination of the ion specific parameters (K 0.5Na+,K 0.5Li+,V maxNa+,V maxLi+) transport of 10 μm (or 100 μm if indicated)l-[U-14C]proline was measured in the presence of 0.005 to 250 mm NaCl or LiCl at 25 °C. The resulting data were plotted according to Eadie-Hofstee. Standard deviations were determined from at least three independent experiments. Group I comprises PutP bearing substitutions for Asp-55 or Met-56. The mutants are characterized by their low apparent affinity for the coupling ion. So, similar as previously reported for PutP-D55E (16Quick M. Jung H. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4631-4636Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), also substitution of Met-56 by Cys caused severe effects on K 0.5Na+(20-fold increase) and V maxNa+(reduction to 14% of the wild-type value) (Table I). Furthermore, replacement of Asp-55 with Glu or Met-56 with Cys had a much more pronounced effect on K 0.5Li+ than on K 0.5Na+(K 0.5Li+ > 100 mm) yielding a dramatic change in the K 0.5Li+ to K 0.5Na+ ratio. While this ratio for PutP wild-type was about 5, PutP-D55E and -M56C exhibited a ratio of K 0.5Li+ to K 0.5Na+ of above 100, thereby suggesting a more distinct discrimination between the two coupling cations. Contrary to the apparent Li+affinity, the maximum rate of Li+-coupled proline uptake (V maxLi+ ) of both mutants was in the same order of magnitude as the corresponding Na+ value. Compared with the apparent ion affinities, the apparent proline affinity was only moderately altered upon substitution of Asp-55 by Glu or Met-56 by Cys (about 8-fold increase of K mPro) (Table I). Finally, as shown for Na+ (16Quick M. Jung H. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4631-4636Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), Li+ also proved unable to drive proline transport by PutP-D55C and -D55N. Group II encompasses PutP containing substitutions for Ser-57 and Gly-58. Group II mutants differ from group I mutants by their highly reduced apparent affinities for proline in addition to defects in ion binding (Table I). Most severe effects were observed upon replacement of Ser-57. Substitution of this residue by Ala, Cys, Gly, or Thr increased K mPro by up to 2 orders of magnitude (18Quick M. Tebbe S. Jung H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 239: 732-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In addition, this study revealed severe defects in ion binding. Depending on the nature of the amino acid side chain at position 57, K 0.5Na+ was increased by factors of 12 (PutP-S57T), 42 (-S57C), 45 (-S57G), and 79 (-S57A). PutP-S57A, -S57C, and -S57T exhibited a V maxNa+ ≤ 4% of the wild-type activity. A higher but still reduced V maxNa+ was observed for PutP-S57G (40% compared with PutP-wild-type). Since the proline concentration used for the latter studies (10 μm) was far below the apparent proline affinity of PutP containing replacements for Ser-57, the Na+ dependence of proline uptake of PutP-S57A and -S57C was also analyzed at higher proline concentrations. Saturating proline concentrations could not be used since the ion stimulatory fraction of the transport signal was to low to allow a precise calculation of kinetic parameters. However, in the presence of 100 μm proline K 0.5Na+ for PutP-S57A and -S57C was about 8-fold reduced compared with K 0.5Na+determined at 10 μm proline. Furthermore, the V maxNa+obtained at 100 μm proline was ∼5-fold increased compared with that determined in the presence of 10 μmproline. The 10-fold increase of the proline concentration had no significant effect on K 0.5Na+ and V maxNa+ for PutP-wild-type (data not shown). Substitution of Ser-57 with Cys, Gly, or Thr affected V maxLi+and K 0.5Li+ to a similar extend as observed for the corresponding Na+parameters (Table I). However, Li+ did not stimulate proline uptake by PutP-S57A (Li+ concentrations of up to 250 mm were used) which was independent on the proline concentration (10 or 100 μm). Substitution of Gly-58 by Cys resulted in a highly reduced apparent affinity for proline (40-fold increase of K mPro), similar as described above for PutP containing substitutions for Ser-57. The apparent Na+ affinity of PutP-G58C was less dramatically affected (5-fold increase of K 0.5Na+) while the apparent Li+ affinity was more severely altered (19-fold increase of K 0.5Li+). The changes in the apparent ligand affinities of the mutant were accompanied by reduced maximum rates of proline uptake (30-fold reduction of V maxNa+; 8-fold reduction of V maxLi+ ). Group III contains PutP with substitutions for Ser-54. Substitution of Ser-54 by Ala, Cys, or Thr had the least effect on all kinetic parameters tested. The apparent affinity of the transporter for proline (K mPro) was not significantly affected by the replacements (Table I). Furthermore, K 0.5Na+ and K 0.5Li+ were increased by factors of maximum 6 and 8 (PutP-S54C). V maxNa+ and V maxLi+ were in the same order of magnitude as the corresponding wild-type values. To obtain further information on the role of this region in ligand binding and ligand-induced conformational alterations, the accessibility of Cys residues placed individually at positions 54 to 58 was analyzed in the absence and presence of different ligands (Na+, Li+, and proline). For this purpose Cys was individually introduced into a functional PutP derivative devoid of all five native Cys residues (PutP(ΔCys)) (8Jung H. Rübenhagen R. Tebbe S. Leifker K. Tholema N. Quic"

The hydrogen bond between the helix βH6 residue βSer178 and the loop αL6 residue Gly181 was shown to be critical in ligand-induced intersubunit signaling, with the α-β communication being completely lost in the mutant βSer178 → Pro (Marabotti, A., De Biase, D., Tramonti, A., Bettati, S., and Mozzarelli, A.

The structural basis of the impaired allosteric regulation was investigated by determining the crystal structures of the mutant βSer178 → Pro in the absence and presence of the α-subunit ligands indole-3-acetylglycine and glycerol 3-phosphate. The mutation causes local and distant conformational changes especially in the β-subunit. The ligand-free structure exhibits larger differences at the N-terminal part of helix βH6, whereas the enzyme ligand complexes show differences at the C-terminal side. In contrast to the wild-type enzyme loop αL6 remains in an open conformation even in the presence of α-ligands. This effects the equilibrium between active and inactive conformations of the α-active site, altering k cat andK m, and forms the structural basis for the missing allosteric communication between the α- and β-subunits.

The enzyme is formed by two α- and β-subunits, arranged in a linear αββα geometry (1Hyde C.C. Ahmed S.A. Padlan E.A. Miles E.W. Davies D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 17857-17871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and catalyzes the last two steps in the biosynthesis ofl-tryptophan in a highly concerted mode. The isolated α- and β-subunits exhibit an activity about 2 orders of magnitude lower that in the tetramer, indicating that the formation of the complex is accompanied by subunit conformational changes (2Miles E.W.

Further levels of regulation are achieved by ligand-induced intersubunit signals that are pH-, temperature-, and cation-dependent and keep the catalytic activities of α and β-active sites in phase (4Lane A.N.

In particular, signal transduction from the α- to the β-active site involves residues belonging to loop αL2, loop αL6, and the helix βH6 (14Rhee S. Parris K.D. Hyde C.C. Ahmed S.A. Miles E.W. Davies D.R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7664-7680Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar,15Schneider T.R. Gerhardt E. Lee M. Liang P.H. Anderson K.S. Schlichting I.

Gerhardt E. Lee M. Liang P.H. Anderson K.S. Schlichting I. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5394-5406Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The question whether there is a unique or multiple pathways of communication and whether these pathways are specialized in controlling defined functional properties of the enzyme was addressed by investigating the activity and regulatory properties of several mutants of the α- and β-subunits. It was found that mutants in loop αL2 and mutants in helix βH6 that interact with loop αL2 exhibit altered α and β activities (16Ogasahara K. Hiraga K. Ito W. Miles E.W. Yutani K. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 7421-7432Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In particular, the mutant βS178P exhibits a 2-fold decrease in β-subunit activity and a completely impaired (“knock-out”) allosteric regulation (21De Marabotti A. Biase D. Tramonti A. Bettati S. Mozzarelli A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17747-17753Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). This finding was explained by the loss of a key hydrogen bond between the carbonyl oxygen of Ser178, located at the end of helix βH6, and αGly181, located in the center of loop αL6. To determine the structural basis of the loss of regulation, and, thus, to acquire further information on the mechanism of intersubunit communication, the three-dimensional structure of the mutant βS178P was determined in the absence and presence of the allosteric effectors indole-3-acetylglycine (IAG) (23Marabotti A. Cozzini P. Mozzarelli A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1476: 287-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) anddl-α-glycerol-3-phosphate (GP). The structural findings indicated that the equilibrium between active and inactive forms of the α-subunit might be affected by the βS178P mutation. Therefore, the steady kinetics of the forward and reverse α-reaction were analyzed in detail. The crystal structures of wild-type tryptophan synthase complexed with IAG and other novel α-subunit ligands are reported in the accompanying paper (24Weyand M. Schlichting I. Marabotti A. Mozzarelli A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10647-10652Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). IAG and GP were obtained from Sigma and were used without further purification. The βS178P mutant of TRPS was purified as described previously (21De Marabotti A. Biase D. Tramonti A. Bettati S. Mozzarelli A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17747-17753Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The protein was stored at a concentration of 10 mg/ml in a solution containing 50 mm Na-Bicine, pH 7.8, 10 mmNa-EDTA, 1 mm dithioerythritol, and 20 μmpyridoxal 5-phosphate. Crystals were grown in the dark at room temperature using the hanging drop geometry and mixing equal volumes (2–4 μl) of protein and reservoir solutions. The latter contained 9–12% polyethylene glycol 8000, 1.5 mm spermine, 1 mm EDTA, 50 mm Bicine buffer, pH 7.8. Prior to flash-cooling in liquid nitrogen the crystals were rinsed briefly in a cryo-protectant solution consisting of 100 mm Bicine buffer, pH 7.8, 15% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 8000, and 20% (v/v) glycerol. The βS178PGP and βS178PIAGcomplexes were generated by soaking crystals for 10 min in the cryo-protectant solution containing 50 mm GP or IAG, respectively, before flash-cooling in liquid nitrogen. Diffraction data of the βS178P mutant were collected at beamline ID14-1 at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility, Grenoble, France using a wavelength of 0.934 Å and a MAR CCD detector. The crystals were kept at 100 K during measurements. The diffraction data were processed with XDS and scaled with XSCALE (25Kabsch W. J. Appl.

The mutated residue was modeled as alanine to avoid model bias. The final model was obtained by cyclic rounds of manual model building with the program O (28Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W.

Water molecules were incorporated by ARP (30Lamzin V.S. Wilson K.S. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1993; 49: 129-147Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using the automatic cut-off option. All waters were checked manually and removed if displaying unusual hydrogen-bonding geometry. Apart from residues at the C termini of both polypeptide chains, the only part of the βS178P mutant structures that remains too disordered to be build into electron density was the loop αL6 (αL177–αL191) and, in the ligand-free βS178P and the βS178PGP structure, the side chain of αF212.

Open table in a new tab To investigate the influence of the proline mutation and of the different ligands of the α-active site on the allosteric communication, we superimposed the new βS178P mutant structures with each other and also with the ligand free (Protein Database accession code 1BKS (32Deleted in proofGoogle Scholar)) and IAG wild-type (24Weyand M.

The superposition was done with the program O (28Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjelgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13014) Google Scholar) using all common Cα-atom coordinates of both structures except the Cα atoms belonging to the COMM domain (βGly102–βGly189). The resulting r.m.s. deviations were calculated with the program BRAGI (33Schomburg D. Reichelt J. J. Mol. Graphics. 1988; 6: 161-165Crossref Scopus (119) Google Scholar). IGP was synthesized according to the procedures described by Kawasaki et al.(34Kawasaki H. Bauerle R. Zon G. Ahmed S.A. Miles E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10678-10683Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and its concentration was determined spectroscopically.dl-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (G3P) was obtained from Sigma and used without further purification in the acidic form. The α activities were measured spectroscopically in 100 mmbis-Tris-propane, pH 7.8, 100 mm NaCl, utilizing the difference in absorption between indole and IGP at 290 nm (35Weischet W.O. Kirschner K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1976; 65: 365-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 36Miles E.W. Bauerle R. Ahmed S.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 142: 398-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Spectra were taken at 37 °C using 0.2-mm path length quartz cuvettes. The forward α-reaction was measured using a protein concentration of 3.61 μm and IGP concentrations between 0.03 and 1.5 mm. The solution was preincubated at 37 °C for 15 min, and the reaction was started with the addition of TRPS. The reverse α-reaction was measured using a protein concentration of 63 nm, an indole concentration of 2 mm, and G3P concentrations between 0.3 and 3.0 mm. The solution was preincubated at 37 °C for 15 min, and the reaction was started with the addition of G3P. The data were fitted to a hyperbolic curve with the program GRAFIT. Since the influence of the proline mutation in helix βH6 of the COMM domain on the TRPS structure is most pronounced in the ligand-free enzyme, the ligand free βS178P structure is discussed first in more detail. Then, this structure serves as a basis for the comparison with the IAG and GP complexes. The crystal structure of the ligand-free βS178P TRPS mutant was solved at 1.7-Å resolution and refined to crystallographicR-factors of R work = 18.7% andR free = 23.9% (TableI). The overall topology of the mutant structure is the same as for the wild-type (15Schneider T.R. Gerhardt E. Lee M. Liang P.H. Anderson K.S. Schlichting I. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5394-5406Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Besides the C-terminal residues of both polypeptide chains, weak or no electron density was found for the residues of loop αL6 (αLeu177–αAla190) and for the side chain of phenylalanine αPhe212. The latter residue was modeled as alanine. The missing parts of the protein structure are not due to poor x-ray data quality, since the β-subunit core residues βMet187, βLys219, and βSer301exhibit clear features for double side chain conformations. The observation of multiple side chains, which also occurs in the βS178PIAG and βS178PGP structures (see Table I), indicates high x-ray data quality. Moreover, loop αL6 was also not detectable in other structures of the wild-type and mutant (1Hyde C.C. Ahmed S.A. Padlan E.A. Miles E.W. Davies D.R. J. Biol.

A close-up of the mutation site (Fig.1 A) shows the interruption of the βH6 helix caused by the Ser178 → Pro substitution.

Larger structural differences between the βS178P α-subunit and the wild-type were found in loop αL5 at αAsn157, as indicated by a large r.m.s. deviation (Fig. 2 A, left panel, peak A). Since this loop region has ambiguous electron density in most structures determined by us (15Schneider T.R. Gerhardt E. Lee M. Liang P.H. Anderson K.S. Schlichting I. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5394-5406Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 27Weyand M. Schlichting I. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16469-16480Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), the structural difference, indicated by a high r.m.s. deviation for αAsn157, might be caused by distinct interpretations of this part of the electron density map. In one of these possible map interpretations αAsn157 is able to connect the COMM domain to loop αL6, the most mobile region of the TRPS enzyme. On one side, in the mutant structure the side chain of αAsn157is able to form hydrogen bonds to the hydroxyl group of βTyr181 and to the carbonyl oxygen of βIle20. On the other side, in the wild-type structure the carbonyl oxygen of the preceding amino acid αPro156 has a distance of approximately 4.5 Å to the amide nitrogen of αLeu190. This distance is too long for a favorable hydrogen bond. However, since this part of the TRPS structure shows the highest flexibility and, therefore, the highest coordinate error, water molecules may be difficult to identify. With the present structural data we cannot exclude the presence of a water molecule mediating the connection between the COMM domain and loop αL6 via αAsn157. Hiraga and Yutani (41Hiraga K. Yutani K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4935-4940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) have studied the subunit association of several TRPS interface mutants by titration calorimetry, including two αAsn157 mutants, and found that these mutations did not affect the stimulatory activity, indicating that this subunit interaction is not of crucial importance for the allosteric regulation. This supports our believe that the structural difference at the αAsn157 containing surface loop is of no relevance for the observed different allosteric communication properties of the βS178P mutant. The second structural difference (Fig. 2 A, left panel, peak B) within the α-subunit of the βS178P mutant is found at αPhe212, which is modeled as alanine, as this part of the structure also has weak electron density. However, the electron density of the final structure has well defined density for a water molecule, forming hydrogen bonds with the amide nitrogen atoms of αPhe212 and αGly234. In the case of the β-subunit, several significant differences between the wild-type and mutant structures are observed. Apart from different conformations in a surface loop (Fig.2 A, right panel, peak A) and the C-terminal end of the β-polypeptide chain (Fig. 2 A,right panel, peak D), the βSer178→ Pro mutation introduces a different backbone conformation of the neighboring residues of helix βH6 (Fig. 2 A, right panel, peak C). In contrast to the molecular simulation (21De Marabotti A. Biase D. Tramonti A. Bettati S. Mozzarelli A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17747-17753Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), that indicated the presence of only localized structural changes leading to the loss of the hydrogen bond between the native βSer178 and αGly181, the x-ray structure shows that the change at position β178 disturbs the normal α-helix backbone conformation of helix βH6 (amino acids βThr165–βTyr181 (15Schneider T.R. Gerhardt E. Lee M. Liang P.H. Anderson K.S. Schlichting I. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5394-5406Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar)). The normal hydrogen bond between the amide proton of βSer178 and the preceding arginine βArg175 carbonyl oxygen is no longer possible (Fig. 1). The φ/ψ torsion angles for βArg175changed from −62.8°/−44.4° in wild-type TRPS to −75.7°/−36.1° in the mutant. By this rotation an unfavorable contact of the new proline ring is avoided. This conformational change is further transmitted to the rest of the N-terminal part of helix βH6. Therefore, compared with the wild-type structure the largest Cα-r.m.s. deviation differences are found in this region of the mutant (Fig. 2 A, right panel, peak C), whereas the changes are insignificant at the C-terminal end of helix βH6 (Fig. 2 A, right panel, and Fig.3 A). A similar conformational change in helix βH6 is observed in all three βS178P complexes: ligand-free, IAG, and GP. The N-terminal part of helix βH6 and the adjacent structural elements of the COMM domain are linked to the metal binding loop (βAsp305–βPro307) via a water-mediated hydrogen bond network and some hydrophobic side chain interactions. In the ligand-free βS178P structure βLeu166 shifted toward the side chain of βPhe306, and the aspartate βAsp305 side chain points toward the α-active side, forming a water-mediated contact to βAsp138, which is in direct neighborhood to the N-terminal part of helix βH6. In case of the ligand-free mutant structure the “disturbance” caused by the mutation is further transmitted by the neighboring secondary structure elements strand βS5 and helix βH5 (Fig.2 A, right panel, peaks B andC, Fig. 3 A) to βGlu109, which is believed to play a crucial role in the catalytic activity and the substrate specificity of the TRPS β-reaction (42Ruvinov S.B.

Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 1180-1190Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). This may explain the 2-fold lower β activity of the βS178P mutant compared with the wild-type enzyme (21De Marabotti A. Biase D. Tramonti A. Bettati S. Mozzarelli A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17747-17753Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The structure was solved at a resolution of 1.7 Å. As in the uncomplexed structure, the amino acids of loop αL6 (αLeu178–αAla190) are not detectable. In addition to the α- and β-subunits, the final model contains 377 water molecules, a sodium ion, and an indole-3-acetylglycine bound to the α-active site. This model was refined to R-factors ofR work = 21.0% and R free= 26.5"
https://openalex.org/W2060851629,"Mu transposition occurs within a large protein-DNA complex called a transpososome. This stable complex includes four subunits of MuA transposase, each contacting a 22-base pair recognition site located near an end of the transposon DNA. These MuA recognition sites are critical for assembling the transpososome. Here we report that when concentrations of Mu DNA are limited, the MuA recognition sites permit assembly of transpososomes in which non-Mu DNA substitutes for some of the Mu sequences. These “hybrid” transpososomes are stable to competitor DNA, actively transpose the non-Mu DNA, and produce transposition products that had been previously observed but not explained. The strongest activator of non-Mu transposition is a DNA fragment containing two MuA recognition sites and no cleavage site, but a shorter fragment with just one recognition site is sufficient. Based on our results, we propose that MuA recognition sites drive assembly of functional transpososomes in two complementary ways. Multiple recognition sites help physically position MuA subunits in the transpososome plus each individual site allosterically activates transposase.

Multiple recognition sites help physically position MuA subunits in the transpososome plus each individual site allosterically activates transposase. Transposons are found in all the biological kingdoms, and some perform specialized functions. For example, the machinery that initiates V(D)J recombination likely evolved from a transposon (1Agrawal A. Eastman Q.M. Schatz D.G. Nature. 1998; 394: 744-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar, 2Hiom K. Melek M. Gellert M. Cell. 1998; 94: 463-470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar), and the cDNA of HIV and other retroviruses integrate into host cell DNA through mechanisms nearly identical to transposition (3Haren L. Ton-Hoang B. Chandler M. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1999; 53: 245-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). The genome of bacteriophage Mu is a transposon that uses transposition both to integrate into the DNA of a new host cell and to replicate before lysis. Like most DNA rearrangements, transposition is a complex, multi-step process, requiring numerous DNA sequence elements. Studies of bacteriophage Mu have been central to our understanding of both the fundamental mechanisms and the complexities of DNA transposition. Phage Mu encodes a transposase, MuA, that transfers the Mu genome from one DNA location (the transposition donor) to a new location (the transposition target) (4Mizuuchi K. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 1011-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar, 5Chaconas G. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1999; 77: 487-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). During transposition, transposase performs two principle reactions: DNA cleavage and DNA strand transfer. During cleavage, the donor DNA is nicked twice, once at each 3′ end of the Mu genome. During strand transfer, the cleaved transposon ends are inserted into neighboring sites on the two target strands. Little or no specific sequence information is needed on the target DNA (6Mizuuchi M. Mizuuchi K. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1993; 58: 515-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), but the Mu DNA provides many sequence cues for transposition (Fig.1). For example, the last two nucleotides at either 3′ end of the Mu DNA, the cleavage sites, have the sequence 5′-CA. Also near each end of the Mu DNA are three recognition sites, distinct from the cleavage sites, which share a 22-base pair consensus sequence. The recognition sites are referred to as R1, R2, and R3 on the right end and L1, L2, and L3 on the left end (Fig. 1) (7Craigie R. Mizuuchi M. Mizuuchi K. Cell. 1984; 39: 387-394Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The recognition sites are bound specifically by the N-terminal domain of MuA (8Nakayama C. Teplow D.B. Harshey R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 1809-1813Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), whereas the cleavage sites must be engaged by the protein's active site, contained in a different region of the protein (9Rice P. Mizuuchi K. Cell. 1995; 82: 209-220Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Both the recognition sequences and the 5′-CA cleavage sequences are required for transposition (10Groenen M.A. van de Putte P. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 189: 597-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 11Baker T.A. Mizuuchi K. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 2221-2232Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 12Coros C.J. Chaconas G. J. Mol.

Both the cleavage and strand transfer reactions occur within a stable MuA·DNA complex called a transpososome (Fig. 1). Because the transpososome binds both transposon ends simultaneously, it is also referred to as a synaptic complex. The complex contains three MuA subunits tightly bound to recognition sites (the R1, R2, and L1 sites) plus a fourth subunit tightly bound in the complex but weakly bound to the L2 recognition site (14Kuo C.F. Zou A.H. Jayaram M. Getzoff E. Harshey R. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1585-1591Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 15Lavoie B.D. Chan B.S. Allison R.G. Chaconas G.

A. 1991; 88: 9031-9035Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). At least two of the four MuA subunits individually bridge the transposon ends: the subunit bound to the right-end's R1 site engages the left cleavage site, and the subunit bound to the left-end's L1 site engages the right cleavage site (17Aldaz H. Schuster E. Baker T.A. Cell. 1996; 85: 257-269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 18Savilahti H. Mizuuchi K.

This crisscross structure helps coordinate reactions at the two DNA ends, ensuring that the transposon moves as a single unit. Given this intertwined structure, and also the intimate involvement of multiple DNA sites in the complex, it is unknown to what extent protein-protein versus protein-DNA interactions contribute to the stability and functionality of the synaptic complex. In vitro, transpososomes can also assemble on ∼50-base pair DNA fragments, containing the R2, R1, and cleavage site sequences. Two of these “donor fragments” are synapsed by a MuA tetramer, mimicking synapsis of the two ends of a transposon (Fig.2 A) (21Savilahti H. Rice P.A. Mizuuchi K. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4893-4903Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). The fragments are then cleaved at the proper cleavage site and transferred together to a target DNA. If the fragments are synthesized to appear precleaved, cleavage by MuA is unnecessary prior to strand transfer (Fig.2 B). Because the fragments are small relative to the target, the resulting transposition product comigrates with linear target. Transpososomes formed on donor fragments, like those formed on larger DNA molecules, can resist competition from additional recognition sites for hours or perhaps days. In contrast, monomeric MuA has rapid on and off rates from its recognition sites (21Savilahti H. Rice P.A. Mizuuchi K. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4893-4903Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar,22Surette M.G. Buch S.J. Chaconas G. Cell. 1987; 49: 253-262Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). 1I. Goldhaber-Gordon and T. A. Baker, unpublished results. How does transposase change from a form that is monomeric, with a rapid dissociation rate from DNA, into a stable, active synaptic complex? This process involves interactions between at least four multi-domain subunits and multiple DNA sequences, and little is understood about the role of each component in the complex. For example, although the recognition sites are essential, their precise role during assembly is uncertain. Here, we use a promiscuous activity of MuA to elucidate the functions of MuA recognition sites during transposition. We find that MuA recognition sites can activate MuA to transpose non-Mu DNA. Two covalently linked MuA recognition sites are the strongest activators of transposition, but unlinked sites can also serve in this capacity. Our results suggest that MuA recognition sites perform at least two complementary functions during transposition. Covalently linked sites promote transpososome assembly by spatially constraining two of the four MuA subunits. In addition, each individual recognition site activates transposition, probably by inducing conformational changes in the transposase. In some experiments (see Figs. 7, B,C, and 8) the MuA truncation 77–663 was substituted for full-length MuA. This was done because, in the absence of the Internal Activating Sequence (a DNA sequence on the Mu phage that activates transpososome assembly), the truncation protein is hyperactive compared with the full-length protein. The products discussed in Fig. 8 were seen previously using full-length protein (23Baker T.A. Kremenstova E. Luo L. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2416-2428Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar).

Oligonucleotides (fragment donors) were purchased either from Massachusetts Institute of Technology/Howard Hughes Medical Institute (MIT/HHMI) biopolymers laboratory or from GeneLink and were purified by denaturing PAGE, except for those less than 30 nucleotides, which were purified by reverse phase cartridges. Most oligonucleotide sequences are described in Fig. 2 B. However, over the course of this study, we used several different “unjoinable fragments” that differed at three non-essential nucleotide positions and/or in the length of the 5′ overhang on the non-transferred strand. We saw no qualitative difference in the behavior of these various fragments (data not shown).

A, non-Mu transposition is probably due to synapsis of a fragment containing MuA recognition sites and a φX174 molecule. B, in support of this model, preincubation of MuA with the unjoinable fragment inhibited formation of intermolecular transposition products. In a 1-h incubation step, 100 nm MuA was incubated without DNA (lane 1), with φX174 DNA and 50 nm unjoinable fragment (lane 2), just with φX174 (lane 3), or just with unjoinable fragment (lane 4). The missing DNA components were added to the reactions for a subsequent 20-min incubation. Only the preincubation with the unjoinable fragment caused significant inhibition of transposition (lane 4). For this figure and all that follow, unless noted otherwise, products were visualized by Vistra-green staining of an agarose gel. C, graph of product concentration versus fragment concentration shows a fragment optimum. The total DNA concentration was maintained constant at 1440 nm, by balancing the Mu fragment with a fragment of identical length but unrelated sequence. The Mu fragment was R1-R1 (see Fig. 2 B), and the incubation time was 4 h to permit this reaction to be compared with the one shown in Fig. 6 B.

Proteins were prepared by dilution of concentrated stock into the following buffers. MuA: 600 mmNaCl, 25 mm Hepes-KOH, 0.1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, and 1 mm dithiothreitol; MuB: 1 mNaCl, 25 mm Hepes, 0.1 mm EDTA, 20% glycerol, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. The reactions were incubated at 30 °C for 20–60 min unless otherwise indicated. They were stopped by addition of 0.2 volumes of a stop solution (∼0.1% bromphenol blue, 8% SDS, 50 mm EDTA, 30% glycerol) and electrophoresed through a 0.9% HGT-agarose gel, in 1× TAB buffer (40 mm Tris, pH 8, 3.6 mm EDTA, 27 mmsodium acetate). The gels were then analyzed by one of the following methods: 1) stained in 1 μg/ml ethidium bromide and photographed with a Polaroid camera, 2) stained in a 1:10,000 dilution Vistra Green in TAB buffer and visualized on a Molecular Dynamics Fluorimager 595, and 3) for radioactive samples, the gels were pressed and dried on DEAE paper and exposed to a Molecular Dynamics phosphorimaging cassette. The plasmid assays, described in Fig. 8, were performed in two steps. The first incubation was as described (23Baker T.A. Kremenstova E. Luo L. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2416-2428Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) (reactions contained neither Me2SO nor Triton), except that the reaction volume was 50 μl and incubation time was 2 h. For the second step, either 1 μl of restriction enzyme or 1 μl of 50% glycerol was added to reactions, and they were incubated for another 2 h at 37 °C. The second incubation period increased the amount of intramolecular φX174 products. In the first dimension, electrophoreses was as described above. A single lane was then excised and positioned horizontally across the top of a 0.8% HGT-agarose gel in alkaline buffer (30 mm NaOH, 1 mm EDTA) for electrophoreses in the second dimension. The gel was analyzed by Southern blotting: DNA was transferred to a PerkinElmer Life Sciences Genescreen hybridization membrane and probed with labeled DNA fragments that had been randomly primed off of φX174 RFI DNA. Complexes were assembled under standard transposition conditions, in the absence of MgCl2, target DNA, and MuB. They were electrophoresed through a 2% MetaPhor (FMC Bioproducts)-agarose gel in 0.5x TBE buffer (44.5 mm Tris 8.5, 44.5 mm Borate, 1 mmEDTA). In transposition reactions containing limiting concentrations of Mu-derived DNA, non-Mu DNA molecules were seen to transpose (Fig. 3). There were three principle requirements for this promiscuous activity. The first requirement is MuA protein. The second requirement is a large, non-Mu DNA molecule to serve as a transposition donor. We focused on the 5386-base pair φX174 RFI, but two molecules unrelated to φX174, pBR322 or pUC19, worked about equally well (data not shown). The third requirement is MuA recognition sites suppliedin trans on another DNA molecule. In our initial experiments, the MuA recognition sites were supplied on a fragment that is itself defective in the strand transfer step (called “unjoinable,” see Fig. 2 B). This unjoinable fragment has two MuA recognition sites (R1 and R2) and an incomplete cleavage site. Thus the unjoinable fragment and the non-Mu DNA complemented each other. The fragment supported transpososome assembly but failed to transpose due to its defective cleavage site (see below, and Ref. 17Aldaz H. Schuster E. Baker T.A. Cell. 1996; 85: 257-269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The non-Mu DNA cannot on its own support transpososome assembly (11Baker T.A. Mizuuchi K. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 2221-2232Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), but it did transpose. Incubation of the unjoinable Mu fragment, MuA, the MuB protein (see below), and a target DNA (φX174 RFI) resulted in the formation of two types of transposition products. One family of products electrophoresed between the nicked and linear target DNAs (Fig. 3 A,lanes 1 and 2, labeledintramolecular). The second product ran slightly above dimeric target (Fig. 3 A, lane 1, labeledintermolecular). Both were true recombination products rather than non-covalent rearrangements trapped by proteins; the samples in Fig. 3 A were treated with 1% SDS, and the products were also unaffected by treatment with proteinase K or by phenol extraction (data not shown). The Mu fragment was a critical component of the reaction (lane 5). Formation of the slower-migrating product (labeledintermolecular) required the MuB protein (Fig.3 A, lane 2). MuB is a DNA-binding protein that stimulates MuA and controls MuA's target selection (26Maxwell A. Craigie R. Mizuuchi K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 699-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). For example, when transposition of Mu donor plasmids is assayed in the absence of MuB, the products are usually intramolecular; the Mu sequences define the donor sites, and another site on the same plasmid serves as target site. In the presence of MuB, transposition is usually intermolecular; the Mu plasmid serves as donor, a separate non-Mu DNA molecule serves as target, and the two molecules become joined to each other through transposition. Here, the slow electrophoretic mobility of the MuB-dependent product (Fig. 3 A, labeledintermolecular) strongly suggested that it contained two φX174 molecules. This product did not contain Mu DNA (data not shown, results of radiolabeling the Mu donor fragment). Therefore, this MuB-dependent product was most likely the result of an aberrant intermolecular reaction, in which two molecules of φX174 were joined together. The MuB-independent product (labeledintramolecular) could have resulted from intramolecular recombination, in which a single φX174 molecule provided both the donor and target sites. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis confirmed the structures of the new products (Fig. 3 B). Transposition reactions were performed with MuA, MuB, φX174, and a Mu fragment. The DNA products were resolved on an agarose gel similar to that shown in Fig. 3 A. A lane was then excised from the gel (shown lying horizontally in Fig.3 B), and electrophoresed through alkaline (denaturing)-agarose. In the denaturing dimension, the intermolecular product yielded a slow-migrating species and a species that co-migrated with single-stranded circular φX174 DNA. These are the expected components of a figure-eight-shaped transposition product, in which two full-length, double-stranded φX174 molecules are joined by a single strand. The MuB-independent products also yielded a slow-migrating component in the second dimension. This long single-stranded species could result from an intramolecular transposition in which a strand was joined to its complement. Intramolecular transposition products should also yield smaller components of varying mobilities, depending on the exact insertion site. Since these smaller products do not migrate as a distinct band, they are difficult to distinguish on the two-dimensional gel. Together, these data show that a Mu DNA fragment permits a non-Mu DNA molecule (in this case φX174) to participate as a donor DNA during transposition. It is likely that Mu fragments promote non-Mu transposition, at least in part, by promoting assembly of synaptic complexes. In support of this argument, unjoinable Mu fragments are known to support assembly of MuA tetramers that are stable to high salt and to competitor DNA, a diagnostic of a synaptic complex (17Aldaz H. Schuster E. Baker T.A. Cell. 1996; 85: 257-269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 20Williams T.L. Jackson E.L. Carritte A. Baker T.A. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2725-2737Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). φX174 DNA alone does not support assembly of detectable levels of MuA tetramer (11Baker T.A. Mizuuchi K. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 2221-2232Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). We considered two models for synaptic complexes that might transpose non-Mu DNA. In the “two-fragment model,” two Mu fragments form a synaptic complex, similar to the one shown in Fig. 2 A. A φX174 molecule associates with this pre-assembled synaptic complex, contributing a few nucleotides to serve as the cleavage site. In the alternative “hybrid complex” model, synaptic complexes form between a single Mu fragment and a site on φX174 (Fig. 4 A). This model suggests that φX174 DNA functions both structurally and chemically as one of the two transposon ends. The two-fragment model posits that synapsing two Mu DNA fragments is a prerequisite for non-Mu transposition. By contrast, the hybrid-complex model predicts that synapsis of two fragments competes with assembly of hybrid transpososomes. In support of the hybrid complex model, pre-incubating MuA with an unjoinable Mu fragment inhibited φX174 transposition (Fig. 4 B, lane 4). The reactions shown here were primarily intermolecular, but in reactions without MuB, intramolecular transposition was also inhibited by preincubation with the Mu fragment (data not shown). Pre-incubating MuA alone (lane 1) or with φX174 (lane 3) did not significantly inhibit subsequent reactions. Most likely, then, functional complexes are hybrids of a single Mu fragment and a φX174 molecule. The hybrid-complex model also predicts that high concentrations of Mu fragments should always inhibit non-Mu transposition, due to assembly of complexes on pairs of fragments. To test this prediction, we performed transposition assays in which we varied the concentration of a Mu fragment (in this case R1-R1, see Fig. 2 B) but maintained the total DNA concentration constant using a DNA fragment of unrelated sequence but identical length. The yield of transposition products peaked sharply at 8 nm Mu fragment (Fig.4 C), substantially below the MuA concentration of 50 nm. These results further support the hybrid complex model. This experiment also showed that it is the Mu recognition sequence, as opposed to a general feature of short DNA fragments, that both activates and inhibits non-Mu transposition. Two additional observations support the hybrid complex model. First, stable complexes of unjoinable fragment, φX174 DNA, and MuA had been seen previously (17Aldaz H. Schuster E. Baker T.A. Cell. 1996; 85: 257-269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). φX174 was assumed to be bound as target DNA in such complexes, but we now suggest that it is also bound as a donor partner. Second, in the accompanying paper we demonstrate that the regions of φX174 that participate in transposition, when viewed as a group, bear weak but significant resemblance to a Mu DNA end (27Goldhaber-Gordon I. Early M.H. Gray M.K. Baker T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7703-7712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Recall that the Mu transposon ends include two types of specific DNA sequences: recognition sites and cleavage sites. The unjoinable and R1-R1 fragments discussed above are, respectively, partially or entirely lacking a cleavage site sequence (Fig. 2 B). We found that donor fragments with functional, uncleaved or precleaved cleavage sites also activated non-Mu transposition (Fig.5, lanes 2–7). These fragments produced the figure-eight intermolecular product described above plus a novel intermolecular product. This novel product was probably due to transposition of a donor fragment together with the non-Mu DNA (see figure legend for details). Precise, quantitative comparisons of the activities of different fragments was difficult, due to differences in the types of products each produced. But as a rough estimate, the uncleaved and precleaved fragments seemed to be less active in non-Mu transposition assays than were either the unjoinable or the R1-R1 fragment. Of all the fragments tested, the R1-R1 fragment seemed the most potent activator of non-Mu transposition (Fig. 5, lanes 11–13). This suggests that a cleavage site on the Mu DNA is at best neutral, and possibly inhibitory, to non-Mu transposition. We next asked whether the fragments needed to contain two recognition sites (positioned as the natural R1 and R2 sites) to activate non-Mu transposition. We expected that the two sites contribute to transpososome stability by correctly positioning two of the four MuA subunits with respect to each other. To determine whether this contribution is an essential one, we constructed fragments containing a single R1 site (see Fig. 2 B). These R1 fragments were 22 base pairs long, containing half the sequence of the 46-base pair R1-R1 fragment. This minimal substrate was sufficient to permit non-Mu transposition (Fig.6 A). To observe activity with this fragment, we did require longer incubation times and higher fragment concentrations than with the fragment with two sites (data not shown and Fig. 6 B). Nonetheless, the intermolecular φX174 transposition product was clearly visible and present only in reactions containing the Mu fragment (Fig. 6 A, see figure legend). We also confirmed that a nonspecific sequence could not substitute, by varying the concentration of the R1 fragment with a fragment of identical length but unrelated sequence (Fig. 6 B). These results point to a powerful role of the recognition s"

DNase I hypersensitive sites the gene coding for β-galactosidase 5-bromo-4-chloro-3indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside Collagen type I is synthesized by fibroblasts, osteoblasts, odontoblasts, and other specialized cells in different organs. It is a fibrillar collagen, composed of two α1(I) chains and one α2(I) chain. These chains are encoded by thepro-α1(I) andpro-α2(I) collagen genes, which in mice are located on chromosomes 11 and 6 respectively (1Munke M. Harbers K. Jaenisch R. Francke U. Cytogenet.

Biochem. 1985; 151: 449-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) demonstrated that the mRNA of thepro-α1(I) andpro-α2(I) collagen genes are only found in collagen-producing cells and are always present at the 2:1 ratio seen in the mature collagen molecule. This indicates that regulation of the collagen genes is primarily at the transcriptional level and that the pro-α1(I) andpro-α2(I) collagen genes are probably coordinately regulated. Given the complex expression pattern of collagen type I, which is produced in different tissues at different stages of development and in response to disease or injury, transcriptional control of the α1(I) and α2(I) collagen genes may involve a number of distinct elements, each directing expression in a separate tissue, cell type, or stage of development or disease. This hypothesis has been supported by studies of transgenic mice harboring various regions of the mouse, rat, and human pro-α1(I) collagen promoters that demonstrate a modular arrangement of distinct and separate tissue-specific elements within the first 3.2 kb of the proximal promoter (4Rossert J. Eberspaecher H. de Crombrugghe B. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1421-1432Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). These elements were shown to be responsible for reporter gene expression in different subsets of type I collagen-producing cells, namely osteoblasts, odontoblasts, fascia, and tendon fibroblasts (4Rossert J. Eberspaecher H. de Crombrugghe B. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1421-1432Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). More recently, an additional osteoblast element was characterized (5Kern B. Shen J. Starbuck M. Karsenty G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 276: 7101-7107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar) as well as a uterine fibroblast element farther upstream between −7.0 and −8.0 kb from the transcription start site (6Krempen K. Grotkopp D. Hall K. Bache A. Gillan A. Rippe R.A. Brenner D.A. Breindl M. Gene Expr. 1999; 8: 151-163PubMed Google Scholar). Although the mouse pro-α1(I) andpro-α2(I) collagen genes are coordinately expressed, the arrangement of the control elements appears to differ between the two genes. Unlike the mousepro-α1(I) collagen gene, thepro-α2(I) collagen gene does not appear to contain discernable tissue-specific elements within the −3.2-kb proximal promoter, but the minimal promoter (−350 to +54 bp) alone is capable of promoting very limited levels of reporter gene expression in transgenic models (7Niederreither K. D'Souza R.N. de Crombrugghe B. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 1361-1370Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), in contrast to thepro-α1(I) minimal promoter (8Rossert J.A. Chen S.S. Eberspaecher H. Smith C.N. de Crombrugghe B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1027-1031Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). A survey of the upstream region of the mousepro-α2(I) gene promoter reported the presence of three DNase I hypersensitive sites (HS),1 HS5, HS4, and HS3, located approximately −17.1, −16.2, and −15.5 kb upstream of the transcription start site. These sites were present only in collagen type I-producing cells (9Bou-Gharios G. Garrett L.A. Rossert J. Niederreither K. Eberspaecher H. Smith C. Black C. de Crombrugghe B. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1333-1344Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Transgenic mice harboring a 6.0-kb region encompassing the three hypersensitive sites between −19.5 and −13.5 kb, linked to the minimal promoter (−350 to +54 bp), resulted in a high level of reporter gene expression in the majority of collagen-producing cells. However, unlike the mousepro-α1(I) collagen gene upstream region, no reporter gene expression was detected in the osteoblasts of the endochondral bones or the odontoblasts, although some reporter gene expression could be detected in the osteoblasts of bones of intramembranous origin. We termed this region the far-upstream enhancer because of its ability to drive reporter gene expression independent of position and orientation and in the presence of nonspecific minimal promoters (9Bou-Gharios G. Garrett L.A. Rossert J. Niederreither K. Eberspaecher H. Smith C. Black C. de Crombrugghe B. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1333-1344Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). These data suggested that this far-upstream enhancer contains a number of distinct cis-regulatory elements involved in the control of expression in different type I collagen-producing cells. In this study, we sought to identify the functional unit(s) of the far-upstream enhancer and to investigate the role of hypersensitive sites within the upstream enhancer. The results show that the minimal functional enhancer is 1.5 kb in length, and the sequences overlapping HS4 are probably the most critical for the functional activity of this enhancer. The 5′-flanking sequence of the mousepro-α2(I) collagen gene was derived from a λFIX II library (Stratagene). The clone λ3-3 contained 5′-flanking sequences of thepro-α2(I) collagen gene from −23.3 to −11.0 kb relative to the transcriptional start site (9Bou-Gharios G. Garrett L.A. Rossert J.

Two reporter gene vectors were used in generating transgenic mice, pLacRM350 and pLacES350, which was adapted from pLacRM350, with the 3′ multiple cloning site in reverse orientation. These vectors were modified from pLacF (10Mercer E.H. Hoyle G.W. Kapur R.P. Brinster R.L. Palmiter R.D.

Both vectors also contain the mouse pro-α2(I) collagen gene minimal promoter (+54 to −350 bp) 5′ of the lacZ gene. For constructs pGB(−17.0/−13.5 del 0.5) and pGB(−17.0/−15.45 del 0.25), two separate fragments were removed from λ3-3, blunt-ended, and cloned together into pBluescript, from where they were subcloned into pLacRM350. Transgenic mice were generated using the mouse pro-α2(I) constructs shown in Fig. 1. Vector sequences were removed withNruI and SacII. The digested DNA constructs were gel-purified, suspended in 10 mm Tris/HCl (pH 7.4), 0.1 mm EDTA (pH 8) at a concentration of 2–3 ng/μl, and injected into the pronuclei of fertilized C57Bl10 × CBA/C eggs as previously described (11Hogan B. Beddington R. Constantini F. Lacy E. Manipulating the Mouse Embryo, A Laboratory Manual.2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, New York1994Google Scholar). Undamaged eggs were transferred into pseudopregnant CD1 foster mothers. The foster mothers were sacrificed at 15.5 days of gestation, and the embryos were stained for β-galactosidase activity as previously described (11Hogan B. Beddington R. Constantini F. Lacy E.

In addition, DNA was extracted from the placentas of the founder animals and used to genotype the animals by PCR analysis. Transient transfection assays were performed using the FuGENE 6TM (Roche Diagnostics) transfection reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, NIH3T3 and L929 cells were grown in 6-well plates in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. At log phase growth, the cells were transfected with 2 μg of total plasmid DNA and 6 μl of FuGENE 6TM reagent (2 × 105cells per transfection). pRSVLuc was co-transfected (0.2 μg) to check the efficiency of transfection. The cells were harvested 72 h post-transfection using lysis buffer, and activities of the reporter genes β-galactosidase and luciferase were measured using the Dual-Light® chemiluminescent reporter gene assay system (Applied Biosystems) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Protein content was also measured using BCA reagents (Pierce). The specific activity was calculated by dividing the data from β-galactosidase assay by the luciferase data and then by the total protein content. The preparation of nuclei and DNase I digestion was carried out as previously described (9Bou-Gharios G. Garrett L.A. Rossert J. Niederreither K. Eberspaecher H. Smith C. Black C. de Crombrugghe B. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1333-1344Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Briefly, NIH3T3 and L929 cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, scraped, pelleted, and resuspended in buffer A (15 mm Tris/HCl (pH 7.6), 15 mm NaCl, 60 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm EGTA, 0.3 mm sucrose, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.15 mm spermine, 0.5 mm spermidine, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mmdithiothreitol). Cells were mechanically disrupted, the resulting homogenate was diluted with an equal volume of buffer B (buffer A without Triton X-100), and the nuclei were centrifuged. Nuclear pellets were resuspended in 5 volumes of buffer C (buffer A without Triton X-100, EDTA, or EGTA), and DNA concentrations were estimated by UV absorption at 260 nm. 15 absorbance units were used for each DNase I digestion. These reactions were performed in 40 mm Tris/HCl (pH 7.6) and 6 mm MgCl2 using 10 μl of DNase I (Amersham Biosciences) at concentrations between 0 and 10 units/μl. After a 15-min incubation at room temperature, the reaction was halted by adding 2 volumes of 50 mm Tris/HCl (pH 8.0), 100 mm NaCl, 100 mm EDTA, 1% SDS, and 40 μl of proteinase K (20 mg/ml). Purified DNA was then digested with appropriate restriction enzymes, and Southern analysis was performed according to the standard protocol (12Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 9.31-9.57Google Scholar). To locate the specific restriction enzyme sites that lay 5′ and 3′ of the hypersensitive site cores, mouse genomic DNA was also digested with the same enzyme, in addition to one of nine specific enzymes located within the area of interest. These samples were run alongside the DNase I-treated extract. For DNase I footprinting, plasmid DNA was digested with the appropriate restriction enzyme and end-labeled by filling in 3′-recessed ends with Klenow enzyme (12Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 9.31-9.57Google Scholar). Gel purification of labeled DNA fragments, preparation of nuclear extracts from NIH3T3 cells, nuclear protein binding, and DNase I footprinting reactions were performed as previously described (13Inagaki Y. Truter S. Ramirez F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14828-14834Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Transgenic mice were generated containing the constructs pGB(−19.5/−13.5), pGB(−17.0/−13.5), and pGB(−16.6/−13.5). These constructs are depicted in Fig.1 A and consist of the far-upstream enhancer with progressive 5′ deletions fused to the −350 to +54 minimal promoter and lacZ gene.

Open table in a new tab Summary of the number of founder animals that were transgenic identified by PCR, compared to those expressing the transgene. It is notable that the highest percentage of expressors correlates with the presence of sequences overlapping the three regions that we show are essential for functional integrity of the enhancer. DNase I hypersensitive site analysis using a genomic ladder digested with a series of known restriction enzymes refined the location of HS3, HS 4, and HS5 reported by Bou-Gharios et al. (9Bou-Gharios G. Garrett L.A. Rossert J. Niederreither K. Eberspaecher H. Smith C. Black C. de Crombrugghe B. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1333-1344Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) and showed the restriction enzyme sites between which the hypersensitive core sites were located. Construct pGB(−19.5/−13.5) contained DNase I hypersensitive sites HS3, HS4, and HS5, whereas constructs pGB(−17.0/−13.5) and pGB(−16.6/−13.5) contained only HS3 and HS4 because HS5 is located between the StyI site at −17.05 and the EcoRI site at −17.2 and, hence, beyond the 5′ boundary of the latter two constructs (Fig. 1). Mice transgenic for constructs pGB(−19.5/−13.5) and pGB(−17.0/−13.5) showed a very similar staining pattern to that previously reported (9Bou-Gharios G. Garrett L.A. Rossert J. Niederreither K. Eberspaecher H. Smith C. Black C. de Crombrugghe B. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1333-1344Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). No differences in expression pattern were noted with the smaller pGB(−17.0/−13.5) construct, and the percentage of transgenic mice expressing the construct was also similar to that of the larger construct (Table I). Because we have established that HS5 is beyond the 5′ boundary of pGB(−17.0/−13.5), these results show that the DNA sequence represented by HS5 is not required for the correct expression of the pro-α2(I) collagen gene during mouse development. In contrast, the mice transgenic for and expressing the construct pGB(−16.6/−13.5) with a 400-bp deletion from the 5′-end showed a staining pattern different from that seen in mice expressing the pGB(−17.0/−13.5) construct. X-gal staining was only detected in 29% of the transgenic embryos and varied quite considerably in the pattern of expression between embryos (Fig. 2). Histological examination showed that the expression of the reporter gene could not be detected in the intramembranous bones of the calvarium, but the clavicle showed some limited staining. Expression of the reporter gene was also severely limited in the mesenchymal cells associated with skeletal muscle with only two embryos showing detectable expression in the body wall muscles along the back of the embryos. Reporter gene expression in the connective tissue of the fascia was also limited to certain regions of the back. X-gal staining in the internal organs was absent except for the connective tissue of the pancreatic primordia, and low level staining was seen in the fibrous and smooth muscle layers of the stomach. These results show that the 5′ boundary of the functional far-upstream enhancer lies between the BamHI site at −17.0 and theAvaI site at −16.6 kb upstream of the transcriptional start site. This 400-bp region does not contain any detectable DNase I hypersensitive sites but has been shown here to have a significant impact on the functional expression of the far-upstream enhancer. Transgenic mice were also generated with the construct pGB(−17.0/−16.6), which contains the essential 400-bp region. Only 17% of the transgenic embryos expressed the transgene (Table I). Furthermore, in these mice the X-gal staining pattern was aberrant, with staining seen only in non-collagen-producing tissues (data not shown). Transgenic mice harboring the constructs pGB(−17.0/−14.7) and pGB(−17.0/−15.45) with 3′ deletions of 2.2 and 1.95 kb, respectively (Fig. 1 B) were very similar to those expressing pGB(−17.0/−13.5), with high levels of reporter gene expression detected in the intramembranous osteoblasts, mesenchymal cells of the muscle, tendon, and fascia, smooth muscle cells of the blood vessels and gut, and connective tissue of the majority of internal organs (Fig. 3). This indicated that the region located between −15.45 and −13.5 kb may not be essential to the expression of thepro-α2(I) collagen gene during development. In contrast, transgenic mice expressing the construct pGB(−17.0/−15.7), in which a further 280 bp had been deleted from the 3′-end of the enhancer region, showed a significant reduction in the level and pattern of transgene expression. However, that pattern was consistent in all founder animals, which were expressing the transgene (Fig. 4). This deletion effectively removed the HS3 core site, located between the HindIII site at −15.45 and the StyI site at −15.7 (Fig. 1 B). Reporter gene expression was detected in the intramembranous osteoblasts and in fibroblasts of the fascia, tendon, and muscle of certain defined regions, primarily around the nose and the limbs (Fig.4). Apart from these regions, no expression was detected in skeletal or smooth muscle (with the exception of some staining in the stomach) or in the connective tissue of the internal organs. These results suggest that the sequence between the StyI site at −15.7 andHindIII at −15.45 is required for reporter gene expression in the mesenchymal cells of connective tissue of the internal organs and in most regions of the muscle, tendon, and fascia. These results also indicate that HS3 plays a role in directing tissue- or region-specific control of the mousepro-α2(I) collagen gene. In an attempt to identify possible binding sites contributing to the tissue- and spatial-specific regulation of the mousepro-α2(I) collagen gene, a DNase I footprinting assay was employed to map sites of nuclear protein interaction in the region of the mousepro-α2(I) collagen gene upstream enhancer represented by HS3. The analysis identified two distinct areas of nuclear protein protection within the region between theStyI site at −15.7 and the HindIII site at −15.45 kb upstream of the transcriptional start site (Fig.5). These footprints (FP1 and FP2) were detected with extracts from both L929 and NIH3T3 cells. Both footprints lie at the 5′ of the fragment. This analysis strongly suggests that the region represented by HS3 is responsible for binding several nuclear proteins that may have a role in tissue- or stage-specific expression of the mouse pro-α2(I) collagen gene in mesenchymal cells. Indeed, computer-based sequence analysis searches through MatInspector V2 (14Quandt K. Frech K. Karas H. Wingender E. Werner T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4878-4884Crossref PubMed Scopus (2427) Google Scholar) revealed a number of transcription factors with 100% core recognition. These are shown in Fig. 5. The DNase I hypersensitive site, HS4, is located between the PvuII site at −16.2 and theBbsI site at −15.95 kb upstream of thepro-α2(I) collagen gene (data not shown). Two constructs were generated containing deletions within the HS4 region. Construct pGB(−17.0/−14.7 del 0.5) consisted of the construct pGB(−17.0/−14.7) with a deleted region between thePvuII site at −16.2 and the StyI site at −15.7 (Fig. 1 C). No mice transgenic for the construct pGB(−17.0/−14.7 del 0.5) showed any detectable reporter gene expression. In contrast, 44% in embryos transgenic for the construct pGB(−17.0/−15.45 del 0.25) showed detectable expression (Table I). In all but one embryo, reporter gene expression was restricted to the tail region, in tendon and the fascia (Fig. 6). This result demonstrates that the sequence representing the HS4 region is essential in maintaining the functional integrity of the enhancer. To further examine the influence of the HS4 core region on gene transcription, transient transfections were carried out to establish the effect of HS4 deletion on the ability of the far-upstream enhancer to promote reporter gene expression in vitro (Fig.7). Although both pGB(−17.0/−14.7) and pGB(−17.0/−15.45) promoted an increase in β-galactosidase-specific activity relative to the −350 minimal promoter alone, the two HS4-deletion constructs, pGB(−17.0/−14.7 del 0.5) and pGB(−17.0/−15.45 del 0.25), also showed similar transgene activity when compared with the intact HS4-containing enhancer constructs. Several studies of transcriptional control of the genes encoding collagen type I have suggested the existence of a number of distinct tissue-specific elements directing expression of thepro-α1(I) andpro-α2(I) collagen genes. The work presented in this study using transgenic mice demonstrates that the upstream enhancer has a core functional unit of 1.5 kb between −17 and −15.45 kb from the transcriptional start site. The sequences within this region contain several cis-acting elements that work in concert to produce an enhancer that drives high levels of expression in a tissue-specific manner. One of these elements is represented by the sequences overlapping HS4, which we show to be essential for the functional integrity of this enhancer. The 5′ boundary of the functional regions of the mouse far-upstream enhancer has been located between −17.0 and −16.6 kb upstream of the transcriptional start site. Deleting the 2.5-kb region between −19.5 and −17.0 kb of the 6-kb far-upstream enhancer had very little effect on the expression pattern of the reporter gene, even though this deletion effectively removed the DNase I hypersensitive site, HS5. This is demonstrated here by transgenic mice expressing the construct pGB(−17.0/−13.5), which showed X-gal staining in the same pattern and intensity as seen with the larger pGB(−19.5/−13.5) construct. It is worth noting that the human COL1A2 shares high homology with the mouse enhancer and also contains three DNase I hypersensitive sites. The human enhancer requires all three HS sites for correct functioning, and deletion of the most 5′ HS site, which shares high sequence similarity with mouse HS5, results in the loss of most of the expression (15De Antoniv T.T. Val S. Wells D. Denton C.P. Rabe C. de Crombrugghe B. Ramirez F. Bou-Gharios G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21754-21764Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). This suggests that subtle differences in sequence homology are important, and/or there is a rearrangement within the conserved human sequences that promote regulation via different combinatorial elements. Further deletions of the −17.0-kb BamHI site resulted in the loss of most reporter gene expression, as seen in embryos expressing the construct pGB(−16.6/−13.5). It is therefore apparent that the deleted 400-bp region contained sequences essential for the full function of the far-upstream enhancer. Furthermore, the variegated expression seen in the founder animals, where no two embryos expressed the same pattern, unlike any other deletions, may indicate that this 5′-sequence protects the enhancer from position effect variegation. This protection has been shown in other genes, such as the hCD2 locus in which sequences in its HHS3 region protect against position effect (16Zhuma T. Tyrrell R. Sekkali B. Skavdis G. Saveliev A. Tolaini M. Roderick K. Norton T. Smerdon S. Sedgwick S. Festenstein R. Kioussis D. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6396-6406Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The 3′ boundary of the functional regions of the far-upstream enhancer has been shown to be located near the HindIII restriction site −15.45 kb upstream of the transcriptional start site. Transgenic mice expressing both constructs pGB(−17.0/−14.7) and pGB(−17.0/−15.45) demonstrated high levels of reporter gene expression in a pattern very similar to that of the larger −19.5/−13.5 enhancer. However, removal of the 250-bp region between −15.7 and −15.45, which included the DNase I hypersensitive site HS3, had a deleterious but consistent effect on the function of the far-upstream enhancer. The generation of transgenic mice harboring an additional construct containing the missing 250 bp (HS3) did not result in any expression (data not shown). These deletion experiments have demonstrated that the minimal sequence necessary to confer the full effect of the far-upstream enhancer is located between −17.0 and −15.45 kb. This region alone is capable of promoting reporter gene expression in the fibroblastic cell lineages of most organs in whichin situ hybridization has demonstrated expression of collagen type I (17Niederreither K. D'Souza R. Metsaranta M. Eberspaecher H. Toman P.D. Vuorio E. de Crombrugghe B. Matrix Biol. 1995; 14: 705-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The most significant result of this study is the demonstration that deletion of the sequences overlapping HS4 abolishes the function of the enhancer. Although there is some evidence that small deletions of the core of HS sites may result in artificially severe phenotypes (18Bungert J. Dave U. Lim K.C. Lieuw K.H. Shavit J.A. Liu Q. Engel J.D. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 3083-3096Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 19Navas P.A. Peterson K.R. Li Q. Skarpidi E. Rohde A. Shaw S.E. Clegg C.H. Asano H. Stamatoyannopoulos G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4188-4196Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), it is unlikely to be the explanation here because differently sized HS4 deletions resulted in similar phenotypes, showing that in the absence of HS4 the far-upstream enhancer is unable to promote expression in vivo. Furthermore, the results of the transient transfection assay demonstrate that when the enhancer is not integrated into the genome the deletion of HS4 has no effect on the level of expression. Taken together these results imply that the region represented by HS4 is essential for the function of the far-upstream enhancer, probably by modifying the chromatin environment. Although these deletion experiments have demonstrated that the minimal sequence necessary to confer the full effect of the far-upstream enhancer is located between −17.0 and −15.45 kb, this enhancer does not constitute a locus control region (LCR), nor do these regions represent all the regulatory elements that control mousepro-α2(I) collagen gene expression in all tissues. No reporter gene expression was ever detected in the osteoblasts derived from endochondral ossification or in the cells of the liver. It is therefore likely that as yet unidentified DNA sequences elsewhere in the pro-α2(I) collagen gene domain are necessary to achieve complete control of gene expression and to make up a functioning LCR. The notion of separate DNA elements or modules directing tissue-specific expression has already been documented in a number of collagen-encoding genes, including the mousepro-α1(I)s collagen gene (4Rossert J. Eberspaecher H. de Crombrugghe B. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1421-1432Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). It was thought that the mouse pro-α2(I) collagen gene far-upstream enhancer may actually consist of a number of distinct tissue-specific elements, similar to those found in other collagen genes. We investigated the presence of such tissue-specific cis-acting elements around sequences represented by DNase I hypersensitive sites because these regions represent areas of DNA in a distinct non-nucleosome conformation and are composed of clusters of individual protein binding sites (20Gross D.S. Garrard W.T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 159-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (967) Google Scholar, 21Bonifer C. Gene. 1999; 238: 277-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The deletion of sequences overlapping HS3 resulted in a significant loss of expression in several tissues, most notably in the skeletal muscle of the body wall and attenuated expression of fascia staining within the skin layers of the embryos. This pattern was repeatable in all expressors and did not suffer from position effect variegation, as seen with the 5′-deletion. This suggested that HS3 sequences contain tissue-specific cis-acting elements responsible for certain mesenchymal lineage. The footprinting results indicate that this region does indeed bind transcription factors. Moreover, the size of the footprinted region, at least in fibroblasts, suggests that a complex of factors may be involved. The computational search for transcription factor binding sites revealed a number of transcription factors, many of which were muscle-specific transcription factor binding sites including myogenic basic helix-loop-helix MyoD protein, the MEF2 protein, Mt-binding protein, and the muscle initiator sequence TATA box, as well as the transcriptional activators and regulators (AP1, CAAT boxes, and GATA3) known to be required for their function in vivo (22Black B.L. Olson E.N. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 167-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (856) Google Scholar). Further experiments are underway to delineate the critical transciption factors in this region of the enhancer. One barrier to identifying specific regulatory elements in fibroblasts is the nature of these cells. Unlike osteoblasts, fibroblasts do not form a homogeneous population nor are they easily divided into subpopulations (23Fries K.M. Blieden T. Looney R.J. Sempowski G.D. Silvera M.R. Willis R.A. Phipps R.P. Clin. Immunol. Immunopathol. 1994; 72: 283-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Considerable heterogeneity has also been reported within the fibroblast population of single tissues, although attempts to define the subpopulations have so far been less than successful (24Bayreuther K. Rodemann H.P. Hommel R. Dittmann K. Albiez M. Francz P.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 5112-5116Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar,25Silvera M.R. Sempowski G.D. Phipps R.P. Lymphokine Cytokine Res. 1994; 13: 277-285PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, one of the phenotypes used to identify different subpopulations within a tissue has been the level of collagen type I synthesis. Thus, transcription of thepro-α2(I) collagen gene may not be a simple matter of distinct elements. If collagen expression in a single tissue varies between different subpopulations of fibroblasts, identification of specific control elements regulating collagen expression may be a more complicated matter than previously envisaged. In conclusion, this study demonstrated that there are three key regions to the upstream enhancer, each of which appears to affect gene expression via different mechanisms. Together they generate the enhancer of the mouse pro-α2(I) collagen promoter."

These processes include recombination, replication, transcription, and RNA splicing. The nucleoprotein complexes are often large and elaborate, containing features that permit sophisticated regulation. As a result, dissecting the chemistry of interactions within a complex is a challenging task, but one that is critical to understanding biological function.Transposition of bacteriophage Mu, like that of other transposons, occurs within complexes called transpososomes. Transpososomes mediate at least two sequential chemical reactions, on a pathway toward transferring the transposon DNA from one site to another. The two reactions are: (i) DNA cleavage, in which a nick is introduced precisely at the end of the transposon, on the 3′ strand and (ii) DNA strand transfer, in which the nicked strand is joined to a separate DNA molecule called the target (1Haren L. Ton-Hoang B. Chandler M. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1999; 53: 245-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 2Chaconas G. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1999; 77: 487-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The reaction sites on the transposon DNA, or “donor DNA,” are defined by specific DNA sequences, but Mu target sites are not very sequence-specific (3Mizuuchi M. Mizuuchi K. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1993; 58: 515-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar).Transpososomes contain multiple subunits of a transposase protein, bound to DNA sequences from both of the transposon's ends (1Haren L. Ton-Hoang B. Chandler M. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1999; 53: 245-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). These protein-DNA complexes are also called “synaptic complexes” because they bring together the two ends of the transposon DNA. The phage Mu transposase, MuA, is monomeric in solution but forms a tetramer upon binding to specific DNA recognition sites near the transposon ends (4Surette M.G. Buch S.J. Chaconas G.

Five of the six sites are related by a degenerate 22-base pair consensus sequence. The exception is L2, which is missing roughly half of the 22-base pair sequence. In the transpososome tetramer, three of the MuA subunits are bound specifically to the R1, L1, and R2 sites. The fourth subunit probably binds the L2 site, but this contact is not as stable as that of the other three subunits and can be competed away by excess DNA (5Lavoie B.D. Chan B.S. Allison R.G. Chaconas G. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3051-3059Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar,10Mizuuchi M. Baker T.A. Mizuuchi K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In vitro, MuA can transpose “donor fragment” molecules, short DNA molecules carrying only the R2, R1, and cleavage sites (Fig. 1 A) (11Savilahti H. Rice P.A. Mizuuchi K. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4893-4903Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). These fragments support assembly of MuA tetramers, which synapse pairs of fragments.MuA specifically binds its DNA recognition sites through its N-terminal domain (Fig. 1 B) (12Nakayama C.

This proteolytically defined domain contains three independently folding subdomains, Iα, Iβ, and Iγ, each of which has a helix-turn-helix motif (13Clubb R.T. Omichinski J.G. Savilahti H. Mizuuchi K. Gronenborn A.M. Clore G.M. Structure. 1994; 2: 1041-1048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 14Clubb R.T. Schumacher S. Mizuuchi K. Gronenborn A.M. Clore G.M. J. Mol.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7532-7541Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Domain Iα binds to an internal enhancer-like site that is not essential in vitro. Domains Iβ and Iγ interact with the recognition sites and are essential. Each DNA recognition site can be thought of as two half-sites: the outer half-site is bound by domain Iγ and the inner half by Iβ. This bipartite DNA binding has at least two consequences. It permits the recognition sequences to be unusually long and therefore rare, and it allows for nanomolar binding affinities to the combined site (15Schumacher S. Clubb R.T. Cai M. Mizuuchi K. Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7532-7541Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). It is also possible that the bipartite structure achieves some additional, as yet undiscovered function.The cleaved phosphodiester bond at the end of the transposon is separated from the outermost recognition site (R1 or L1) by five base pairs, the last two base pairs being 5′-CA (often described by the 5′-TG complement). Thus, Mu has separate cleavage sites and recognition sites. Whereas the recognition sites are bound by domains Iβ and Iγ of MuA, the cleavage sites are contacted by the protein's active site, which is in domain IIA (16Rice P. Mizuuchi K. Cell. 1995; 82: 209-220Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar).Within the synaptic complex, individual MuA subunits bind a cleavage site and a recognition site on opposite DNA ends. Specifically, the MuA subunit bound to the R1 site engages the left-end cleavage site, and the subunit bound at L1 engages the right-end cleavage site (Fig.1 B) (17Aldaz H. Schuster E. Baker T.A. Cell. 1996; 85: 257-269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 18Savilahti H. Mizuuchi K.

This intertwined structure suggests that the various MuA domains and subunits function interdependently in a transpososome (20Williams T.L. Jackson E.L. Carritte A. Baker T.A. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2725-2737Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar).There are many unanswered questions about interactions between the protein and DNA components of the transpososome. For example, there is no direct structural information about the geometry of the protein-DNA interactions. On another level, although considerable mutagenesis has been performed on the MuA recognition sites (21Burlingame R.P. Obukowicz M.G. Lynn D.L. Howe M.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 6012-6016Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 22Groenen M.A. van de Putte P. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 189: 597-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 23Coros C.J. Chaconas G. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 310: 299-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), the sites are long, and our understanding of sequence requirements is incomplete.In the accompanying paper, we describe transposition of DNA molecules that have no defined MuA recognition sites (24Goldhaber-Gordon I. Williams T.L. Baker T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7694-7702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). This unconventional activity depends on MuA recognition sites provided in transon a donor fragment or a donor plasmid, so that “hybrid” synaptic complexes can assemble between the Mu DNA and a site on the non-Mu DNA (see Fig. 1 C). Here, we describe the sequences of 18 sites on φX174 RFI that were transposed by MuA. These 18 sequences are extremely diverse. Nonetheless, looking at the most commonly represented nucleotide at each position, we find that as a group the 18 sequences resemble a Mu end with a “TG” cleavage site and a single MuA recognition site. We deduce from these 18 sequences the fundamental sequence requirements for transposition. Additionally, we draw conclusions about the arrangement of the individual DNA sites that contribute to the transpososome. Our conclusions, initially based on sequence analysis, are supported and extended through analysis of the transposition activity of defined DNA fragments. Our data point to localized regions of flexibility in the Mu transpososome.DISCUSSIONFunctional Pseudo-Mu DNA Ends Reveal Sequence Requirements for TranspositionThe Mu transpososome engages multiple DNA sites, including several 22-bp recognition sites and two separate cleavage sites (7Craigie R. Mizuuchi M. Mizuuchi K. Cell. 1984; 39: 387-394Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Defining the relevance of each nucleotide position in this array of sites is a tremendous task. Several laboratories have conducted mutagenesis and chemical protection assays of the Mu DNA ends, and these have gone a long way toward elucidating the sequence requirements for transposition (21Burlingame R.P. Obukowicz M.G. Lynn D.L. Howe M.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 6012-6016Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 22Groenen M.A. van de Putte P. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 189: 597-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 23Coros C.J. Chaconas G. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 310: 299-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 28Zou A.H. Leung P.C. Harshey R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20476-20482Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Lee I. Harshey R.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 314: 433-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The present study asked the protein to select its favorite among disfavored sites and thus could detect subtle sequence preferences that designed mutagenesis would have been unlikely to find.We sequenced 18 sites on a non-Mu DNA molecule (φX174) that had served as pseudo-Mu end sequences. To distill the information contained in those 18 sequences into an easily comprehended picture, we used a Pictogram analysis developed by Chris Burge (30Burge C.B. Padgett R.A. Sharp P.A. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 773-785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Fig.6 includes three Pictograms, each of which represents the 18 pseudo-end sequences in a slightly different way (see figure legend for details). The results of the Pictograms generally agree with past mutagenesis and chemical protection assays, with some exceptions (Table II). One study (22Groenen M.A. van de Putte P. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 189: 597-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) found no effect on transposition from individual mutations at any of 11 positions. Yet in our study, MuA favored matches to its consensus at seven positions that did not appear important in the mutagenesis, as well as at four positions that were not tested by mutagenesis. To illustrate the point further, the top letters of the Pictogram are those that occur most frequently in the 18 pseudo-ends; these top letters correspond well to the consensus sequence derived from the natural sites (written above the Pictogram). This agreement suggests that most base pairs in the recognition sequence contribute favorable energy for transposition, though in some cases the contribution may be too subtle to detect by point mutations.The Pictogram represents only the sequences immediately adjacent to the cleavage sites; we found no further sequence similarity in the DNA adjacent to that. Nonetheless, we assume that the observed transposition activity is due to MuA tetramers (5Lavoie B.D. Chan B.S. Allison R.G. Chaconas G. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3051-3059Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 6Mizuuchi M. Baker T.A. Mizuuchi K. Cell. 1992; 70: 303-311Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The absence of an identifiable second pseudo-recognition site suggests that the position and/or sequence requirements for an inner recognition site (R2/L2) are less rigid than for an outer site (R1/L1).Cleavage Site Sequences Are Highly SelectedThe pseudo-ends are highly selected for their cleavage sites (Fig.6). Among transposons in general, cleavage sites tend to have an identical sequence on the two transposon ends (31Galas P.J. Chander C.M. Berg D.E. Howe M.M. Mobile DNA. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D.C.1989: 110-162Google Scholar). It is tempting to speculate that the cleavage site sequence is so constrained because it is intimately engaged in the protein's active site and perhaps directly involved in catalysis. However, the same would be true of the cleavage sites of modular restriction enzymes, for example the type II enzymes FokI and SfiI. Yet these enzymes have tightly constrained recognition sites rather than cleavage sites (32Kim S.C. Podhajska A.J. Szybalski W. Science. 1988; 240: 504-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar,33Williams S.A. Halford S.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 1476-1483Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), arguing that there is no intrinsic mechanistic reason why the cleavage site should bear the tightest constraints. The cleavage site of a transposon defines which base pairs will transpose and which will stay behind. Transposases may have evolved the ability to strongly discriminate their correct cleavage sites, so as to protect the integrity of the transposon ends from one transposition event to the next.The particular sequence TG/CA marks the cleavage sites of many distantly related transposable elements, including retroviruses (34Esposito D. Craigie R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5832-5843Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar) and bacterial insertion sequences (31Galas P.J. Chander C.M. Berg D.E. Howe M.M. Mobile DNA. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D.C.1989: 110-162Google Scholar). It is not clear why this is so. The most favored cleavage site of the SfiI restriction enzyme is CA, but SfiI cleaves between the C and the A, whereas transposases cleave after the A (33Williams S.A. Halford S.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 1476-1483Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Analysis of naked DNA by computational modeling and other methods reveals unique structural flexibility for the dinucleotide TG/CA (35Packer M.J. Dauncey M.P. Hunter C.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 295: 71-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). It is uncertain whether this intrinsic DNA structure is relevant to enzymatic cleavage reactions.Flexibility and Rigidity within a MuA TranspososomeWithin a transpososome, MuA subunits use three distinct domains to contact three DNA sites on the transposon ends (13Clubb R.T. Omichinski J.G. Savilahti H. Mizuuchi K. Gronenborn A.M. Clore G.M. Structure. 1994; 2: 1041-1048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 14Clubb R.T. Schumacher S.

The cleavage site is contacted by the catalytic domain, and the two halves of the recognition site are contacted by the two subdomains of the bipartite domain Iβ-γ. How flexible are these various binding modules in their relative positioning? Statistical analyses of the 18 pseudo-ends, together with transposition assays of specifically designed Mu end fragments, provide a partial answer.Why Does Cleavage Site Spacing Matter?Within a transpososome, a cleavage site and its adjacent recognition site are bound by separate MuA subunits (17Aldaz H. Schuster E. Baker T.A. Cell. 1996; 85: 257-269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 18Savilahti H. Mizuuchi K. Cell. 1996; 85: 271-280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 19Namgoong S.Y. Harshey R.M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3775-3785Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 20Williams T.L. Jackson E.L. Carritte A. Baker T.A. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2725-2737Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), whereas the two half-recognition sites are bound by tandem domains of a single subunit (5Lavoie B.D. Chan B.S. Allison R.G. Chaconas G. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3051-3059Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 10Mizuuchi M. Baker T.A. Mizuuchi K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9031-9035Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 15Schumacher S. Clubb R.T. Cai M. Mizuuchi K. Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7532-7541Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 28Zou A.H. Leung P.C. Harshey R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20476-20482Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). One might therefore have expected a higher tolerance for insertions near the cleavage site than within the recognition sites, but in fact the opposite is true (Table I and Fig. 5).The constraints on cleavage site position may indicate extensive intersubunit interactions. In addition, the crystal structure of the synaptic complex of a related transposase, from Tn5, shows that the catalytic domain and DNA-binding domain of opposite subunits lie immediately adjacent to each other on the DNA (36Davies D.R. Goryshin I.Y. Reznikoff W.S. Rayment I. Science. 2000; 289: 77-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). The subunits' close proximity probably limits the ability to shorten the DNA of the Tn5 transposon, and similar constraints may apply to the Mu transpososome. Finally, it is possible that the catalytic domain of MuA makes some contacts in the outer half recognition site, overlapping the contacts made by domain Iγ of the opposite subunit. If so, moving the cleavage site may disrupt the contacts to the catalytic domain, which could account for activity losses.Altered DNA Spacing Is Accommodated Locally in the Transpososome and Affects a Late Step of TranspositionMixing heterologous double-stranded DNA fragments revealed that the spacing of sites on one fragment does not effect its synaptic partner (Fig. 5 C). This suggests that the transpososome accommodates altered spacing through localized changes, rather than through global changes in protein structure that may be transmitted between subunits.Two lines of evidence suggest that, with the precleaved fragments used in this study, positional shifts affect a step that occurs after initial transpososome assembly. The results are most striking for the fragments altered in cleavage site spacing, and they contrast with a similar study of the restriction enzyme SfiI, for which altering the spacer between its two recognition sites does harm complex assembly (37Embleton M.L. Williams S.A. Watson M.A. Halford S.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 289: 785-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). First, base pair insertions or deletions in MuA fragments cause an increase in the relative number of SFTs compared with DFTs (Fig. 5, A and C), and an assembly defect should not specifically increase complexes that perform SFT. Second, in the fragment-mixing experiments (Fig. 5 C), altered and wild-type fragments seem to pair-up indiscriminately in synaptic complexes, as judged by the extent of SFTs in these reactions. This result implies that the altered fragments are defective at a post-synaptic step. Perhaps the altered fragments tend to fail in engaging the cleavage site in the protein's active site (38Watson M.A. Chaconas G. Cell. 1996; 85: 435-445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Consistent with this idea, MuA can form competitor-stable complexes on DNA fragments that lack a cleavage site, indicating that the initial commitment to a pair of DNA molecules does not require engagement of the cleavage site (24Goldhaber-Gordon I. Williams T.L. Baker T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7694-7702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). 2K. Yangihara and K. Mizuuchi, personal communication.Flexibility between Half-sites, at a CostAnalyses of 18 pseudo-Mu DNA ends suggest phasing flexibility of ± one base pair between recognition half-sites (Table I). Transposition assays of various DNA fragments supported this assertion (Figs. 3 and 4), but also implied that the natural spacing is optimal. Others have found that adding or removing an A/T base pair from an A/T stretch in the middle of R1 dramatically reduces in vivo transposition, consistent with the natural spacing being optimal (21Burlingame R.P. Obukowicz M.G. Lynn D.L. Howe M.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 6012-6016Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar).Other protein families contain bipartite DNA binding domains, similar to domain Iβ-γ of MuA; for example, the POU, cut, myb, and paired families of transcription factors (39Herr W. Cleary M.A. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1679-1693Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar, 40Harada R. Dufort D. Denis-Larose C. Nepveu A. J. Biol.

Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1263-1275Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Pax6, a member of the paired family, has a rigid 15-residue tether connecting the two domains that comprise its bipartite DNA-binding domain. The tether interacts with DNA, directly contributing to binding specificity (42Xu H.E. Rould M.A. Xu W. Epstein J.A. Maas R.L. Pabo C.O. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1263-1275Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). By contrast, the structures of POU proteins Oct-1 and Pit-1 both suggest flexible tethers (43Klemm J.D. Rould M.A. Aurora R. Herr W. Pabo C.O. Cell. 1994; 77: 21-32Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar, 44Jacobson E.M. Li P. Leon-del-Rio A. Rosenfeld M.G. Aggarwal A.K. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 198-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Consistent with the structural data, a number of POU proteins can bind and regulate DNA sites with variable arrangements of half-sites (39Herr W. Cleary M.A. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1679-1693Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar, 43Klemm J.D. Rould M.A. Aurora R. Herr W. Pabo C.O.

Science. 2000; 290: 1127-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Yet even flexible POU proteins usually have an optimal spacing, analogous to the situation described here for MuA. Optimal spacing can be determined in part by the length of the amino acid tether, but also by cooperative interactions between the protein's two DNA binding domains (47Klemm J.D. Pabo C.O. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 27-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar).NMR structures have been solved for the isolated MuA domains Iβ (15Schumacher S. Clubb R.T. Cai M. Mizuuchi K. Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7532-7541Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) and Iγ (14Clubb R.T. Schumacher S. Mizuuchi K. Gronenborn A.M. Clore G.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 19-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In the domain Iγ structure, the inter-domain tether is unstructured. The tether is only 13 amino acids, whereas the tethers in POU proteins range from 15 to 56 amino acids. The two MuA domains have been modeled docked on DNA (15Schumacher S. Clubb R.T. Cai M. Mizuuchi K. Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7532-7541Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), and the authors of this model suggest that upon binding DNA the tether becomes structured and interacts directly with the DNA. This suggestion was made to explain the pattern of nucleotides that are protected from chemical digestion when MuA is bound to its full recognition site (28Zou A.H. Leung P.C. Harshey R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20476-20482Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The flexibility in half-site spacing described in this study is perhaps most consistent with an unstructured tether. However, it is possible that the DNA-bound tether is structured, but that the transpososome overall retains enough flexibility to accommodate one nucleotide more or less, perhaps through changes in DNA structure rather than protein structure.Biological Role for Flexible BindingMany transcription factors exploit their bipartite DNA binding properties for biological regulation (39Herr W. Cleary M.A. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1679-1693Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar, 46Scully K.M. Jacobson E.M. Jepsen K. Lunyak V. Viadiu H. Carriere C. Rose D.W. Hooshmand F. Aggarwal A.K.

Chem. 1998; 273: 13552-13562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). There is no evidence that bipartite binding plays as significant a role in Mu transposition, but flexible binding might play a role in interactions between MuA and the L2 site. L2 is considered to be a half-site, because it contains only the sequences recognized by domain Iβ of MuA (7Craigie R. Mizuuchi M. Mizuuchi K. Cell. 1984; 39: 387-394Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2) and because its chemical protection pattern is less extensive than the other recognition sites (28Zou A.H. Leung P.C. Harshey R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20476-20482Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, positions 11, 12 and 13 of L2 read TCA (Fig. 2), which matches the consensus sequence through flexible alignment to positions 10, 11 and 12. Thus, it is possible that MuA obtains favorable binding energy through transient contacts with these three base pairs.Multiple Roles of the Recognition Sites in TranspositionIn the accompanying paper, we discussed two roles for the MuA recognition sites: positioning two MuA subunits close together and allosterically activa"
https://openalex.org/W2044806027,"The trimethylamine dehydrogenase-electron transferring flavoprotein (TMADH·ETF) electron transfer complex has been studied by fluorescence and absorption spectroscopies. These studies indicate that a series of conformational changes occur during the assembly of the TMADH·ETF electron transfer complex and that the kinetics of assembly observed with mutant TMADH (Y442F/L/G) or ETF (αR237A) complexes are much slower than are the corresponding rates of electron transfer in these complexes.

https://openalex.org/W2016785625,"Induction of apoptosis often converges on the mitochondria to induce permeability transition and release of apoptotic proteins into the cytoplasm resulting in the biochemical and morphological alteration of apoptosis. Activation of a serine threonine kinase MEK kinase 1 (MEKK1) is involved in the induction of apoptosis. Expression of a kinase-inactive MEKK1 blocks genotoxin-induced apoptosis. Upon apoptotic stimulation, MEKK1 is cleaved into a 91-kDa kinase fragment that further induces an apoptotic response. Mutation of a consensus caspase 3 site in MEKK1 prevents its induction of apoptosis. The mechanism of MEKK1-induced apoptosis downstream of its cleavage, however, is unknown. Herein we demonstrate that full-length and cleaved MEKK1 leads to permeability transition in the mitochondria. This permeability transition occurs through opening of the permeability transition (PT) pore. Inhibiting PT pore opening and reactive oxygen species production effectively reduced MEKK1-induced apoptosis. Overexpression of MEKK1, however, failed to release cytochrome c from the mitochondria or activate caspase 9. Since Bcl2 regulates changes in mitochondria and blocks MEKK1-induced apoptosis, we determined that Bcl2 blocks MEKK1-induced apoptosis when targeted to the mitochondria. This occurs downstream of MEKK1 cleavage, since Bcl2 fails to block cleavage of MEKK1. In mouse embryonic fibroblast cells lacking caspase 3, the cleaved but not full-length MEKK1 induces apoptosis and permeability transition in the mitochondria. Overall, this suggests that cleaved MEKK1 leads to permeability transition contributing to MEKK1-induced apoptosis independent of cytochrome c release from the mitochondria.

These changes consist of mitochondrial permeability transition, production of reactive oxygen species (ROS),1 and release of proteins into the cytoplasm (1Lee H. Wei Y. J. Biomed. Sci. 2000; 7: 2-15Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Adler V. Yin Z. Tew K.D. Ronai Z. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6104-6111Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar). These events could cause blockage of ATP production, damage to membranes, DNA condensation, and activation of caspases leading to apoptosis (1Lee H. Wei Y. J. Biomed. Sci. 2000; 7: 2-15Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Adler V. Yin Z. Tew K.D. Ronai Z. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6104-6111Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar, 3Budihardjo I. Oliver H. Lutter M.

Rev. 2001; 49: 151-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). In response to apoptotic stimulation, the mitochondrial membrane opens to allow solutes and water to enter the mitochondria. This is controlled by a multiprotein complex found in the inner and outer membranes of the mitochondria known as the permeability transition (PT) pore (2Adler V. Yin Z. Tew K.D. Ronai Z. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6104-6111Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar, 5Green D.R. Reed J.C. Science. 1998; 281: 1309-1312Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Loeffler M. Kroemer G. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 256: 19-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). The PT pore consists of voltage-dependent anion channel/porin, adenine nucleotide translocator, cyclophilin D, creatine kinases, and other proteins (6Loeffler M. Kroemer G. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 256: 19-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar, 7Halestrap A.P. Doran E. Gillespie J.P. O'Toole A. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2000; 28: 170-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Upon PT pore opening, the mitochondria loses its membrane potential (Δψm) across the inner membrane. This often occurs following apoptotic stimuli. This is associated with increased production of ROS that further damages proteins and membranes (6Loeffler M. Kroemer G. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 256: 19-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar, 7Halestrap A.P. Doran E. Gillespie J.P. O'Toole A. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2000; 28: 170-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). In addition, proteins are released from the mitochondria following apoptotic stimulus such as cytochromec. When cytochrome c is released, it binds to an Apaf1 and caspase 9 complex (1Lee H. Wei Y. J. Biomed. Sci. 2000; 7: 2-15Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Morin D. Hauet T. Spedding M. Tillement J. Adv.

This leads to caspase 9 activation, causing cleavage of specific proteins and activation of other caspases. These mitochondrial events regulate the induction of apoptosis.The Bcl2 family of proteins control mitochrondial apoptotic responses (9Adams J.M. Cory S. Science. 1998; 281: 1322-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (4778) Google Scholar). Bcl2 family members consist of pro- and antiapoptotic proteins (10Antonsson B. Martinou J.C. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 256: 50-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar, 11Gross A. McDonnell J.M. Korsmeyer S.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1899-1911Crossref PubMed Scopus (3238) Google Scholar). Proapoptotic Bcl2 family members translocate to the outer membrane of the mitochondria from the cytosol following an apoptotic signal (11Gross A. McDonnell J.M. Korsmeyer S.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1899-1911Crossref PubMed Scopus (3238) Google Scholar). This translocation results in release of cytochromec into the cytosol and opening of the PT pore. The exact mechanism of how these proteins release mitochondrial cytochromec or open the PT pore remains unclear. Anti-apoptotic Bcl2 family members such as Bcl2 itself can reverse the effects of the pro-apoptotic members (9Adams J.M. Cory S. Science. 1998; 281: 1322-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (4778) Google Scholar). Bcl2 expression effectively blocks the PT pore opening and cytochrome c release. This is accomplished through Bcl2 binding to pro-apoptotic Bcl2 family members, forming heterodimers. This inhibits these pro-apoptotic proteins from opening the PT pore and releasing cytochrome c from the mitochondria (9Adams J.M. Cory S. Science. 1998; 281: 1322-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (4778) Google Scholar, 11Gross A. McDonnell J.M. Korsmeyer S.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1899-1911Crossref PubMed Scopus (3238) Google Scholar). This interplay between pro- and anti-apoptotic Bcl2 family members regulates the role of the mitochondria in apoptosis.MEK kinase 1 (MEKK1) is a serine threonine kinase that when overexpressed induces caspase activation and apoptosis (12Widmann C. Gibson S. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7141-7147Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar, 13Widmann C. Gerwins P. Johnson N.L. Jarpe M.B. Johnson G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2416-2429Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Many apoptotic stimuli including genotoxic agents activate MEKK1 kinase activity (12Widmann C. Gibson S. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7141-7147Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar, 14Gibson S. Widmann C. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10916-10922Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Following genotoxin treatment, MEKK1 activation leads to increased expression of death receptors such as Fas and death receptors 4 and 5, presumably through activation of transcription factors such as NF-κB (15Gibson S.B. Oyer R. Spalding A.C. Anderson S.M. Johnson G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 205-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). This up-regulation of death receptors contributes to genotoxin-induced apoptosis. Following treatment with apoptotic stimuli, MEKK1 is cleaved by caspases into a 91-kDa fragment containing the kinase domain (13Widmann C. Gerwins P. Johnson N.L. Jarpe M.B. Johnson G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2416-2429Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 16Widmann C. Johnson N.L. Gardner A.M. Smith R.J. Johnson G.L. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 2439-2447Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Overexpression of this cleaved product is more potent at activating caspases and inducing apoptosis than full-length MEKK1 (13Widmann C. Gerwins P. Johnson N.L. Jarpe M.B. Johnson G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2416-2429Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Cleavage of MEKK1 is dependent on caspase 3-like molecules, since MEKK1 contains a consensus site for caspase 3 cleavage, and caspase 3 inhibitors block MEKK1 cleavage. Mutation of this cleavage site prevents MEKK1-induced apoptosis following expression in cells (13Widmann C. Gerwins P. Johnson N.L. Jarpe M.B. Johnson G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2416-2429Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). MEKK1-induced apoptosis is dependent on its kinase activity, since expression of a kinase-inactive form of MEKK1 fails to induce apoptosis (14Gibson S. Widmann C. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10916-10922Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 16Widmann C. Johnson N.L. Gardner A.M. Smith R.J. Johnson G.L. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 2439-2447Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Indeed, kinase inactive MEKK1 acts as a dominant negative protein blocking apoptosis following genotoxin treatment (14Gibson S. Widmann C. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10916-10922Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 16Widmann C. Johnson N.L. Gardner A.M. Smith R.J. Johnson G.L. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 2439-2447Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The downstream mechanism of MEKK1 induction of apoptosis following caspase cleavage, however, remains unknown.Herein, we demonstrate that overexpression of MEKK1 suppresses mitochondrial Δψm mediated by opening of the PT pore. Inhibiting the PT pore and ROS formation effectively reduced MEKK1-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, full-length MEKK1 expression fails to suppress Δψm or induce apoptosis in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) lacking caspase 3, whereas the 91-kDa kinase fragment still is capable of Δψm suppression and induction of apoptosis in these cells. However, MEKK1 fails to release cytochrome c from the mitochondria. This provides evidence that MEKK1 cleavage causes permeability transition, leading to apoptosis independent of cytochrome c release.DISCUSSIONFull-length MEKK1 is activated during apoptosis and has been implicated in the induction of apoptosis (13Widmann C. Gerwins P. Johnson N.L. Jarpe M.B. Johnson G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2416-2429Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 16Widmann C. Johnson N.L. Gardner A.M. Smith R.J. Johnson G.L.

Cell. 1998; 93: 875-884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). This is partially mediated by MEKK1 up-regulating proapoptotic genes such as death receptors (15Gibson S.B. Oyer R. Spalding A.C. Anderson S.M. Johnson G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 205-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 21Faris M. Latinis K.M. Kempiak S.J. Koretzky G.A. Nel A. Mol. Cell.

A. 1998; 95: 5595-5600Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). This up-regulation contributes to genotoxin-induced apoptosis. In contrast, activation of MEKK1 also occurs following treatment with nonapoptotic stimuli such as growth factors (24Fanger G.R. Gerwins P. Widmann C. Jarpe M.B. Johnson G.L. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1997; 7: 67-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 25Jarpe M.B. Widmann C. Knall C. Schlesinger T.K. Gibson S. Yujiri T. Fanger G.R. Gelfand E.W. Johnson G.L. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1475-1482Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Furthermore, MEKK1 is activated by and might protect cells from microtubule toxin-induced apoptosis (14Gibson S. Widmann C. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10916-10922Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 26Yujiri T. Fanger G.R. Garrington T.P. Schlesinger T.K. Gibson S. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12605-12610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). MEKK1, however, fails to be cleaved following treatment with growth factors or microtubule toxins. Thus, activation of full-length MEKK1 is not sufficient to induce an apoptotic response, suggesting that cleavage of MEKK1 is required for its pro-apoptotic function.Regulation of MEKK1 induction of apoptosis involves the cleavage of MEKK1 into a 91-kDa kinase fragment (13Widmann C. Gerwins P. Johnson N.L. Jarpe M.B. Johnson G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2416-2429Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). This fragment is a potent inducer of apoptosis, and blockage of the cleavage site in MEKK1 that produces the 91-kDa fragment fails to induce apoptosis (13Widmann C. Gerwins P. Johnson N.L. Jarpe M.B. Johnson G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2416-2429Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). The mechanism of 91-kDa MEKK1 induction of apoptosis was, however, unknown. We have demonstrated that cleaved MEKK1 leads to permeability transition in the mitochondria. Blockage of PT pore opening inhibits MEKK1-induced apoptosis. The importance of cleavage of MEKK1 was demonstrated in MEF cells lacking caspase 3. This showed that only 91-kDa MEKK1 induces apoptosis and permeability transition in these cells. In contrast, MCF-7 cells that lack caspase 3 expression undergo apoptosis following overexpression of MEKK1. MEKK1 is also cleaved following etoposide treatment in MCF-7 cells. 2E. M. Gibson, E. S. Henson, J. Onio, and S. B. Gibson, unpublished data. In addition, treatment of these cells with doxorubicin induces apoptosis where doxorubicin fails to induce apoptosis in MEF cells lacking caspase 3 (27Weldon C.B. Burow M.E. Rolfe K.W. Clayton J.L. Jaffe B.M. Beckman B.S. Surgery. 2001; 130: 143-150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 28Woo M. Hakem R. Soengas M.S. Duncan G.S. Shahinian A. Kagi D. Hakem A. McCurrach M. Khoo W. Kaufman S.A. Senaldi G. Howard T. Lowe S.W. Mak T.W. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 806-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (758) Google Scholar). This suggests that MCF-7 cells have bypassed the requirement of caspase 3 to induce apoptosis and illustrates potential differences between primary cells (MEF cells) and transformed cell lines (MCF-7 cells) in inducing apoptosis. Overall, we have demonstrated that MEKK1 induction of apoptosis involves cleavage into its 91-kDa form that leads to Δψm suppression in the mitochondria.MEKK1, unlike other proapoptotic proteins, fails to release cytochromec from the mitochondria. This suggests that MEKK1-mediated caspase activation is independent of mitochondrial cytochromec release, and loss of Δψm is not sufficient to release cytochrome c. Full-length MEKK1 up-regulates death receptors that could activate caspases independent of the mitochondria (15Gibson S.B. Oyer R. Spalding A.C. Anderson S.M. Johnson G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 205-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 29Ashkenazi A. Dixit V.M. Science. 1998; 281: 1305-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (5112) Google Scholar). In addition, caspase 3 activation is required for full-length MEKK1-induced loss of Δψm and apoptosis, suggesting that caspase activation occurs prior to MEKK1-induced mitochondria permeability transition. Alternatively, cleavage of MEKK1 could also lead to the activation of signaling pathways that further activate caspases independent of mitochrondrial cytochrome c release. Nevertheless, MEKK1 induces Δψm suppression independent of cytochrome crelease, indicating that cytochrome c release is not involved in MEKK1-mediated caspase activation.Bcl2 family members regulate mitochondrial permeability transition (11Gross A. McDonnell J.M. Korsmeyer S.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1899-1911Crossref PubMed Scopus (3238) Google Scholar). We have demonstrated that Bcl2 negatively regulates MEKK1-induced apoptosis, and this is downstream of MEKK1 cleavage and occurs at the mitochondria. This suggests that pro-apoptotic Bcl2 family members are involved in MEKK1-induced apoptosis. Indeed, these proteins are translocated from the cytoplasm to the mitochondria during the induction of apoptosis (11Gross A. McDonnell J.M. Korsmeyer S.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1899-1911Crossref PubMed Scopus (3238) Google Scholar). It has been reported that expression of the kinase domain MEKK1 translocates pro-apoptotic Bcl2 family member Bak to the mitochondria. The kinase-inactive form of MEKK1 kinase domain blocks this translocation and prevents cisplatin-induced apoptosis (30Mandic A. Viktorsson K. Molin M. Akusjarvi G. Eguchi H. Hayashi S.I. Toi M. Hansson J. Linder S. Shoshan M.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3684-3691Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Most of these pro-apoptotic proteins including Bak cause release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria (11Gross A. McDonnell J.M. Korsmeyer S.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1899-1911Crossref PubMed Scopus (3238) Google Scholar), but MEKK1 overexpression fails to release cytochromec, and the significance of pro-apoptotic Bcl2 family members such as Bak in regulating MEKK1-induced apoptosis is unclear. A new Bcl2 family member BNIP3 has been shown to localize to the mitochondria and induces permeability transition without the subsequent release of cytochrome c (31Cizeau J. Ray R. Chen G. Gietz R.D. Greenberg A.H. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 5453-5463Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 32Vande Velde C. Cizeau J. Dubik D. Alimonti J. Brown T. Israels S. Hakem R. Greenberg A.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5454-5468Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). BNIP3, however, fails to induce apoptosis but instead induces a necrotic-like cell death. Whatever the pro-apoptotic Bcl2 family member responsible for MEKK1-induced loss of Δψm and apoptosis, Bcl2 negatively regulates MEKK1-induced apoptosis at the mitochondria downstream of MEKK1 cleavage. The proapoptotic Bcl2 family member responsible for MEKK1-induced mitochondrial permeability transition will be further investigated.The apoptotic signaling pathways leading to mitochondrial permeability transition are not well defined. MEKK1 is a serine threonine kinase that when cleaved following apoptotic stimulus leads to permeability transition, further committing cells to undergo apoptosis. We have demonstrated that kinase activity and cleavage of MEKK1 are required for mitochondrial permeability transition. MEKK1 activates many signaling pathways. In particular, Jun N-terminal kinase activation is regulated by MEKK1 (26Yujiri T. Fanger G.R. Garrington T.P. Schlesinger T.K. Gibson S. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12605-12610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 33Yujiri T. Sather S. Fanger G.R. Johnson G.L. Science. 1998; 282: 1911-1914Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Jun N-terminal kinase has been shown to phosphorylate Bcl2 family members, inhibiting their anti-apoptotic functions (34Deng X. Xiao L. Lang W. Gao F. Ruvolo P. May Jr., W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23681-23688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 35Yamamoto K. Ichijo H. Korsmeyer S.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8469-8478Crossref PubMed Scopus (909) Google Scholar). This could explain the changes in mitochondrial permeability transition. Overexpression of MEKK1, however, does not lead to the phosphorylation of Bcl2 or BclxL proteins as determined by changes in gel mobility of these proteins. 3G. L. Johnson, personal communication. Furthermore, this phosphorylation has also been demonstrated to induce the release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria but not Δψm suppression. Finally, expression of kinase inactive MEKK1 prevents genotoxin-induced apoptosis but fails to block Jun N-terminal kinase activation in various cell types (14Gibson S. Widmann C. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10916-10922Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 30Mandic A. Viktorsson K. Molin M. Akusjarvi G. Eguchi H. Hayashi S.I. Toi M. Hansson J. Linder S. Shoshan M.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3684-3691Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). MEKK1 also activates other pathways leading to activation transcription factors such as NF-κB (22Yin M.J. Christerson L.B. Yamamoto Y. Kwak Y.T. Xu S. Mercurio F. Barbosa M. Cobb M.H. Gaynor R.B. Cell. 1998; 93: 875-884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 36Nemoto S. DiDonato J.A. Lin A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7336-7343Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This could induce gene expression of a molecule that opens the PT pore such as pro-apoptotic Bcl2 family members without cytochrome c release. Alternatively, MEKK1 could directly phosphorylate proteins that control PT pore opening. The exact substrate(s) for MEKK1 activation specifically leading to changes in mitochondrial permeability transition remains unknown and will be the focus of further investigation.Overall, these results indicate that MEKK1 apoptosis signaling involves mitochondrial permeability transition but is independent of cytochromec release. This occurs downstream of MEKK1 cleavage, committing cells to undergo apoptosis. By pharmaceutically targeting the cleavage of MEKK1, MEKK1-induced apoptosis could be effectively regulated without affecting the other functions of full-length MEKK1. This could be used in the treatment of various diseases such as cancer. Apoptotic signals often lead to changes in the mitochondria. These changes consist of mitochondrial permeability transition, production of reactive oxygen species (ROS),1 and release of proteins into the cytoplasm (1Lee H. Wei Y. J. Biomed. Sci. 2000; 7: 2-15Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Adler V. Yin Z. Tew K.D. Ronai Z. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6104-6111Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar). These events could cause blockage of ATP production, damage to membranes, DNA condensation, and activation of caspases leading to apoptosis (1Lee H. Wei Y. J. Biomed. Sci. 2000; 7: 2-15Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Adler V. Yin Z. Tew K.D. Ronai Z. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6104-6111Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar, 3Budihardjo I. Oliver H. Lutter M. Luo X. Wang X. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 269-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (2249) Google Scholar, 4Morin D. Hauet T. Spedding M. Tillement J. Adv. Drug Deliv. Rev. 2001; 49: 151-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). In response to apoptotic stimulation, the mitochondrial membrane opens to allow solutes and water to enter the mitochondria. This is controlled by a multiprotein complex found in the inner and outer membranes of the mitochondria known as the permeability transition (PT) pore (2Adler V. Yin Z. Tew K.D. Ronai Z. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6104-6111Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar, 5Green D.R. Reed J.C. Science. 1998; 281: 1309-1312Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Loeffler M. Kroemer G. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 256: 19-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). The PT pore consists of voltage-dependent anion channel/porin, adenine nucleotide translocator, cyclophilin D, creatine kinases, and other proteins (6Loeffler M. Kroemer G. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 256: 19-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar, 7Halestrap A.P. Doran E. Gillespie J.P. O'Toole A. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2000; 28: 170-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Upon PT pore opening, the mitochondria loses its membrane potential (Δψm) across the inner membrane. This often occurs following apoptotic stimuli. This is associated with increased production of ROS that further damages proteins and membranes (6Loeffler M. Kroemer G. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 256: 19-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar, 7Halestrap A.P. Doran E. Gillespie J.P. O'Toole A. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2000; 28: 170-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). In addition, proteins are released from the mitochondria following apoptotic stimulus such as cytochromec. When cytochrome c is released, it binds to an Apaf1 and caspase 9 complex (1Lee H. Wei Y. J. Biomed. Sci. 2000; 7: 2-15Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Morin D. Hauet T. Spedding M. Tillement J. Adv. Drug Deliv. Rev. 2001; 49: 151-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 8Kumar S. Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 1060-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). This leads to caspase 9 activation, causing cleavage of specific proteins and activation of other caspases. These mitochondrial events regulate the induction of apoptosis. The Bcl2 family of proteins control mitochrondial apoptotic responses (9Adams J.M. Cory S. Science. 1998; 281: 1322-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (4778) Google Scholar). Bcl2 family members consist of pro- and antiapoptotic proteins (10Antonsson B. Martinou J.C. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 256: 50-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar, 11Gross A. McDonnell J.M. Korsmeyer S.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1899-1911Crossref PubMed Scopus (3238) Google Scholar). Proapoptotic Bcl2 family members translocate to the outer membrane of the mitochondria from the cytosol following an apoptotic signal (11Gross A. McDonnell J.M. Korsmeyer S.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1899-1911Crossref PubMed Scopus (3238) Google Scholar). This translocation results in release of cytochromec into the cytosol and opening of the PT pore. The exact mechanism of how these proteins release mitochondrial cytochromec or open the PT pore remains unclear. Anti-apoptotic Bcl2 family members such as Bcl2 itself can reverse the effects of the pro-apoptotic members (9Adams J.M. Cory S. Science. 1998; 281: 1322-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (4778) Google Scholar). Bcl2 expression effectively blocks the PT pore opening and cytochrome c release. This is accomplished through Bcl2 binding to pro-apoptotic Bcl2 family members, forming heterodimers. This inhibits these pro-apoptotic proteins from opening the PT pore and releasing cytochrome c from the mitochondria (9Adams J.M. Cory S. Science. 1998; 281: 1322-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (4778) Google Scholar, 11Gross A. McDonnell J.M. Korsmeyer S.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1899-1911Crossref PubMed Scopus (3238) Google Scholar). This interplay between pro- and anti-apoptotic Bcl2 family members regulates the role of the mitochondria in apoptosis. MEK kinase 1 (MEKK1) is a serine threonine kinase that when overexpressed induces caspase activation and apoptosis (12Widmann C. Gibson S. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7141-7147Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar, 13Widmann C. Gerwins P. Johnson N.L. Jarpe M.B. Johnson G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2416-2429Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Many apoptotic stimuli including genotoxic agents activate MEKK1 kinase activity (12Widmann C. Gibson S. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7141-7147Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar, 14Gibson S. Widmann C. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10916-10922Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Following genotoxin treatment, MEKK1 activation leads to increased expression of death receptors such as Fas and death receptors 4 and 5, presumably through activation of transcription factors such as NF-κB (15Gibson S.B. Oyer R. Spalding A.C. Anderson S.M. Johnson G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 205-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). This up-regulation of death receptors contributes to genotoxin-induced apoptosis. Following treatment with apoptotic stimuli, MEKK1 is cleaved by caspases into a 91-kDa fragment containing the kinase domain (13Widmann C. Gerwins P. Johnson N.L. Jarpe M.B. Johnson G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2416-2429Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 16Widmann C. Johnson N.L. Gardner A.M. Smith R.J. Johnson G.L. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 2439-2447Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Overexpression of this cleaved product is more potent at activating caspases and inducing apoptosis than full-length MEKK1 (13Widmann C. Gerwins P. Johnson N.L. Jarpe M.B. Johnson G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2416-2429Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Cleavage of MEKK1 is dependent on caspase 3-like molecules, since MEKK1 contains a consensus site for caspase 3 cleavage, and caspase 3 inhibitors block MEKK1 cleavage. Mutation of this cleavage site prevents MEKK1-induced apoptosis following expression in cells (13Widmann C. Gerwins P. Johnson N.L. Jarpe M.B. Johnson G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2416-2429Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). MEKK1-induced apoptosis is dependent on its kinase activity, since expression of a kinase-inactive form of MEKK1 fails to induce apoptosis (14Gibson S. Widmann C. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10916-10922Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 16Widmann C. Johnson N.L. Gardner A.M. Smith R.J. Johnson G.L. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 2439-2447Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Indeed, kinase inactive MEKK1 acts as a dominant negative protein blocking apoptosis following genotoxin treatment (14Gibson S. Widmann C. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10916-10922Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 16Widmann C. Johnson N.L. Gardner A.M. Smith R.J. Johnson G.L. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 2439-2447Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The downstream mechanism of MEKK1 induction of apoptosis following caspase cleavage, however, remains unknown. Herein, we demonstrate that overexpression of MEKK1 suppresses mitochondrial Δψm mediated by opening of the PT pore. Inhibiting the PT pore and ROS formation effectively reduced MEKK1-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, full-length MEKK1 expression fails to suppress Δψm or induce apoptosis in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) lacking caspase 3, whereas the 91-kDa kinase fragment still is capable of Δψm suppression and induction of apoptosis in these cells. However, MEKK1 fails to release cytochrome c from the mitochondria. This provides evidence that MEKK1 cleavage causes permeability transition, leading to apoptosis independent of cytochrome c release. DISCUSSIONFull-length MEKK1 is activated during apoptosis and has been implicated in the induction of apoptosis (13Widmann C. Gerwins P. Johnson N.L. Jarpe M.B. Johnson G.L. Mol. Cell.

In contrast, activation of MEKK1 also occurs following treatment with nonapoptotic stimuli such as growth factors (24Fanger G.R. Gerwins P. Widmann C. Jarpe M.B. Johnson G.L. Curr. Opin. Genet.

Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1475-1482Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Furthermore, MEKK1 is activated by and might protect cells from microtubule toxin-induced apoptosis (14Gibson S. Widmann C. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10916-10922Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 26Yujiri T. Fanger G.R. Garrington T.P. Schlesinger T.K. Gibson S. Johnson G.L.

MEKK1, however, fails to be cleaved following treatment with growth factors or microtubule toxins.

In addition, treatment of these cells with doxorubicin induces apoptosis where doxorubicin fails to induce apoptosis in MEF cells lacking caspase 3 (27Weldon C.B. Burow M.E. Rolfe K.W. Clayton J.L.

McCurrach M. Khoo W. Kaufman S.A. Senaldi G. Howard T. Lowe S.W. Mak T.W. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 806-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (758) Google Scholar). This suggests that MCF-7 cells have bypassed the requirement of caspase 3 to induce apoptosis and illustrates potential differences between primary cells (MEF cells) and transformed cell lines (MCF-7 cells) in inducing apoptosis. Overall, we have demonstrated that MEKK1 induction of apoptosis involves cleavage into its 91-kDa form that leads to Δψm suppression in the mitochondria.MEKK1, unlike other proapoptotic proteins, fails to release cytochromec from the mitochondria. This suggests that MEKK1-mediated caspase activation is independent of mitochondrial cytochromec release, and loss of Δψm is not sufficient to release cytochrome c. Full-length MEKK1 up-regulates death receptors that could activate caspases independent of the mitochondria (15Gibson S.B. Oyer R. Spalding A.C. Anderson S.M. Johnson G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 205-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 29Ashkenazi A. Dixit V.M. Science. 1998; 281: 1305-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (5112) Google Scholar). In addition, caspase 3 activation is required for full-length MEKK1-induced loss of Δψm and apoptosis, suggesting that caspase activation occurs prior to MEKK1-induced mitochondria permeability transition. Alternatively, cleavage of MEKK1 could also lead to the activation of signaling pathways that further activate caspases independent of mitochrondrial cytochrome c release. Nevertheless, MEKK1 induces Δψm suppression independent of cytochrome crelease, indicating that cytochrome c release is not involved in MEKK1-mediated caspase activation.Bcl2 family members regulate mitochondrial permeability transition (11Gross A. McDonnell J.M. Korsmeyer S.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1899-1911Crossref PubMed Scopus (3238) Google Scholar). We have demonstrated that Bcl2 negatively regulates MEKK1-induced apoptosis, and this is downstream of MEKK1 cleavage and occurs at the mitochondria. This suggests that pro-apoptotic Bcl2 family members are involved in MEKK1-induced apoptosis. Indeed, these proteins are translocated from the cytoplasm to the mitochondria during the induction of apoptosis (11Gross A. McDonnell J.M. Korsmeyer S.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1899-1911Crossref PubMed Scopus (3238) Google Scholar). It has been reported that expression of the kinase domain MEKK1 translocates pro-apoptotic Bcl2 family member Bak to the mitochondria. The kinase-inactive form of MEKK1 kinase domain blocks this translocation and prevents cisplatin-induced apoptosis (30Mandic A. Viktorsson K. Molin M. Akusjarvi G. Eguchi H. Hayashi S.I. Toi M. Hansson J. Linder S. Shoshan M.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3684-3691Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Most of these pro-apoptotic proteins including Bak cause release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria (11Gross A. McDonnell J.M. Korsmeyer S.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1899-1911Crossref PubMed Scopus (3238) Google Scholar), but MEKK1 overexpression fails to release cytochromec, and the significance of pro-apoptotic Bcl2 family members such as Bak in regulating MEKK1-induced apoptosis is unclear. A new Bcl2 family member BNIP3 has been shown to localize to the mitochondria and induces permeability transition without the subsequent release of cytochrome c (31Cizeau J. Ray R. Chen G. Gietz R.D. Greenberg A.H. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 5453-5463Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 32Vande Velde C. Cizeau J. Dubik D. Alimonti J. Brown T. Israels S. Hakem R. Greenberg A.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5454-5468Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). BNIP3, however, fails to induce apoptosis but instead induces a necrotic-like cell death. Whatever the pro-apoptotic Bcl2 family member responsible for MEKK1-induced loss of Δψm and apoptosis, Bcl2 negatively regulates MEKK1-induced apoptosis at the mitochondria downstream of MEKK1 cleavage. The proapoptotic Bcl2 family member responsible for MEKK1-induced mitochondrial permeability transition will be further investigated.The apoptotic signaling pathways leading to mitochondrial permeability transition are not well defined. MEKK1 is a serine threonine kinase that when cleaved following apoptotic stimulus leads to permeability transition, further committing cells to undergo apoptosis. We have demonstrated that kinase activity and cleavage of MEKK1 are required for mitochondrial permeability transition. MEKK1 activates many signaling pathways. In particular, Jun N-terminal kinase activation is regulated by MEKK1 (26Yujiri T. Fanger G.R. Garrington T.P. Schlesinger T.K. Gibson S. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12605-12610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 33Yujiri T. Sather S. Fanger G.R. Johnson G.L. Science. 1998; 282: 1911-1914Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Jun N-terminal kinase has been shown to phosphorylate Bcl2 family members, inhibiting their anti-apoptotic functions (34Deng X. Xiao L. Lang W. Gao F. Ruvolo P. May Jr., W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23681-23688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 35Yamamoto K. Ichijo H. Korsmeyer S.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8469-8478Crossref PubMed Scopus (909) Google Scholar). This could explain the changes in mitochondrial permeability transition. Overexpression of MEKK1, however, does not lead to the phosphorylation of Bcl2 or BclxL proteins as determined by changes in gel mobility of these proteins. 3G. L. Johnson, personal communication. Furthermore, this phosphorylation has also been demonstrated to induce the release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria but not Δψm suppression. Finally, expression of kinase inactive MEKK1 prevents genotoxin-induced apoptosis but fails to block Jun N-terminal kinase activation in various cell types (14Gibson S. Widmann C. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10916-10922Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 30Mandic A. Viktorsson K. Molin M. Akusjarvi G. Eguchi H. Hayashi S.I. Toi M. Hansson J. Linder S. Shoshan M.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3684-3691Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). MEKK1 also activates other pathways leading to activation transcription factors such as NF-κB (22Yin M.J. Christerson L.B. Yamamoto Y. Kwak Y.T. Xu S. Mercurio F. Barbosa M. Cobb M.H. Gaynor R.B. Cell. 1998; 93: 875-884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 36Nemoto S. DiDonato J.A. Lin A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7336-7343Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This could induce gene expression of a molecule that opens the PT pore such as pro-apoptotic Bcl2 family members without cytochrome c release. Alternatively, MEKK1 could directly phosphorylate proteins that control PT pore opening. The exact substrate(s) for MEKK1 activation specifically leading to changes in mitochondrial permeability transition remains unknown and will be the focus of further investigation.Overall, these results indicate that MEKK1 apoptosis signaling involves mitochondrial permeability transition but is independent of cytochromec release. This occurs downstream of MEKK1 cleavage, committing cells to undergo apoptosis. By pharmaceutically targeting the cleavage of MEKK1, MEKK1-induced apoptosis could be effectively regulated without affecting the other functions of full-length MEKK1. This could be used in the treatment of various diseases such as cancer. Full-length MEKK1 is activated during apoptosis and has been implicated in the induction of apoptosis (13Widmann C. Gerwins P. Johnson N.L. Jarpe M.B. Johnson G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2416-2429Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 16Widmann C. Johnson N.L. Gardner A.M. Smith R.J. Johnson G.L.

Cell. 1998; 93: 875-884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). This is partially mediated by MEKK1 up-regulating proapoptotic genes such as death receptors (15Gibson S.B. Oyer R. Spalding A.C. Anderson S.M. Johnson G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 205-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 21Faris M. Latinis K.M. Kempiak S.J. Koretzky G.A. Nel A. Mol. Cell.

A. 1998; 95: 5595-5600Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). This up-regulation contributes to genotoxin-induced apoptosis. In contrast, activation of MEKK1 also occurs following treatment with nonapoptotic stimuli such as growth factors (24Fanger G.R. Gerwins P. Widmann C. Jarpe M.B. Johnson G.L. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1997; 7: 67-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 25Jarpe M.B. Widmann C. Knall C. Schlesinger T.K. Gibson S. Yujiri T. Fanger G.R. Gelfand E.W. Johnson G.L. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1475-1482Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Furthermore, MEKK1 is activated by and might protect cells from microtubule toxin-induced apoptosis (14Gibson S. Widmann C. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10916-10922Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 26Yujiri T. Fanger G.R. Garrington T.P. Schlesinger T.K. Gibson S. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12605-12610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). MEKK1, however, fails to be cleaved following treatment with growth factors or microtubule toxins. Thus, activation of full-length MEKK1 is not sufficient to induce an apoptotic response, suggesting that cleavage of MEKK1 is required for its pro-apoptotic function. Regulation of MEKK1 induction of apoptosis involves the cleavage of MEKK1 into a 91-kDa kinase fragment (13Widmann C. Gerwins P. Johnson N.L. Jarpe M.B. Johnson G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2416-2429Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). This fragment is a potent inducer of apoptosis, and blockage of the cleavage site in MEKK1 that produces the 91-kDa fragment fails to induce apoptosis (13Widmann C. Gerwins P. Johnson N.L. Jarpe M.B. Johnson G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2416-2429Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). The mechanism of 91-kDa MEKK1 induction of apoptosis was, however, unknown. We have demonstrated that cleaved MEKK1 leads to permeability transition in the mitochondria. Blockage of PT pore opening inhibits MEKK1-induced apoptosis. The importance of cleavage of MEKK1 was demonstrated in MEF cells lacking caspase 3. This showed that only 91-kDa MEKK1 induces apoptosis and permeability transition in these cells. In contrast, MCF-7 cells that lack caspase 3 expression undergo apoptosis following overexpression of MEKK1. MEKK1 is also cleaved following etoposide treatment in MCF-7 cells. 2E. M. Gibson, E. S. Henson, J. Onio, and S. B. Gibson, unpublished data. In addition, treatment of these cells with doxorubicin induces apoptosis where doxorubicin fails to induce apoptosis in MEF cells lacking caspase 3 (27Weldon C.B. Burow M.E. Rolfe K.W. Clayton J.L.

https://openalex.org/W2065600512,"The K+ channels encoded by the human Ether-a-gogo Related Gene-1 (hERG1) are crucially involved in controlling heart and brain excitability and are selectively influenced by reactive oxygen species (ROS). To localize the molecular regions involved in ROS-induced modulation of hERG1, segmental exchanges between the ROS-sensitive hERG1 and the ROS-insensitive bovine ether-a-gogo gene (bEAG) K+ channels were generated, and the sensitivity of these chimeric channels to ROS was studied with the two-microelectrode voltage-clamp technique upon their expression in Xenopus oocytes. Substitution of the S5-S6 linker of hERG1 with the corresponding bEAG region removed channel sensitivity to ROS, whereas the reverse chimeric exchange introduced ROS sensitivity into bEAG. Mutation of each of the two hERG1 histidines at positions 578 and 587 within the S5-S6 linker generated K+ channels insensitive to modulation by ROS. In addition, the two iron chelators desferrioxamine (1 mm) and o-phenanthroline (0.2 mm) significantly inhibited hERG1 outward K+ currents and prevented hERG1 inhibition induced by the ROS-scavenging enzyme catalase (1000 units/ml).

Physiol. Rev. 1994; 74: 139-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (2223) Google Scholar). ROS have been proposed as crucial regulators of cellular responses in several pathophysiological states, such as cardiovascular (2Kaneko M. Matsumoto Y. Hayashi H. Kobayashi A. Yamazaki N. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1994; 139: 91-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) and neurodegenerative disorders (3Coyle J.T. Puttfarcker P. Science. 1993; 262: 689-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (3533) Google Scholar), senescence (4Sohal R.S. Weindruch R. Science. 1996; 273: 59-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (2631) Google Scholar), and programmed cell death (5Korsmeyer S.J. Yin X.M. Oltvai Z.N. Veis-Novak D.J. Linette G.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1271: 63-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Oxidative stress refers to the imbalance between ROS production and cellular antioxidant defense systems (6Halliwell B. Gutteridge J.M.C. Free Radicals in Biology and Medicine.2nd Ed. Clarendon Press, Oxford1989: 1-81Google Scholar). Iron ions have a primary role in the induction of oxidative stress, acting as catalysts in the Fenton reaction, which leads to the conversion of the highly diffusible, slow reacting H2O2 into the highly reactive and potent oxidant ⋅OH (7Halliwell B. J. Neurochem. 1992; 59: 1609-1623Crossref PubMed Scopus (2659) Google Scholar). In addition, oxidative stress is also influenced by nitric oxide (NO⋅) and other reactive nitrogen species (RNS) (8Gross S.S. Wolin M.S. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1995; 57: 737-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (821) Google Scholar), which have been shown to exert both pro- and antioxidant effects during ischemia-reperfusion injury, depending on their cellular sources and on the stage of evolution of the ischemic process (9Darley-Usmar V. Wiseman H. Hallywell B. FEBS Lett. 1995; 369: 131-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar, 10Iadecola C. Trends Neurosci. 1997; 20: 132-139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (955) Google Scholar). Changes in protein function induced by ROS has been recognized as being crucial for oxidative stress-mediated pathophysiological changes. Maximal sensitivity to ROS is conferred by amino acids containing sulfur atoms (cysteine and methionine), hydroxyl groups (tyrosine), or aromatic rings (histidine, phenylalanine, and tryptophan) (11Stadtman E.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 797-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (1266) Google Scholar). Interestingly, histidines in proteins are often associated with transition metals, particularly with redox-active iron ions, and histidines themselves are vulnerable to metal-catalyzed free radical reactions (12Chevion M. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1988; 5: 27-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). Oxidative modification of histidine residues may lead to their conversion to asparagine, aspartate, or 2-oxo-histidine (13Uchida K. Kawakishi S. FEBS Lett. 1993; 332: 208-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). K+ channels play a crucial role in shaping the electrical activity of neuronal and cardiac cells, and modification of K+ channel activity by ROS and RNS may lead to drastic changes in the excitability of these tissues, such as those occurring during ischemia-reperfusion events (14Martin R.L. Lloyd H.G. Cowan A.I. Trends Neurosci. 1994; 17: 251-257Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar); furthermore, the heterogeneity of the K+ channel subsets expressed in specific cells has also been suggested to underlie their different response patterns to hypoxic/anoxic episodes (15Kourie J.I. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: C1-C24Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The K+ channels encoded by the human Ether-a-gogo Related Gene-1 (hERG1) play a crucial role in excitable tissues (16Warmke J.W. Ganetzky B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3438-3442Crossref PubMed Scopus (866) Google Scholar). In fact, in cardiac tissue, hERG1 encodes for a K+ current having the biophysical and pharmacological properties of native cardiacI Kr, one of the action potential repolarizing currents (17Sanguinetti M.C. Jiang C. Curran M.E. Keating M.T. Cell. 1995; 81: 299-307Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2152) Google Scholar). Alteration in hERG1 K+ channels function prompted by drugs and/or gene defects are responsible for the cardiac arrhythmias occurring during the Long QT syndrome (18Curran M.E. Splawski I.

In neuronal cells, hERG1 K+ channels have been implicated in the changes of the resting membrane potential associated with the cell cycle (19Arcangeli A. Bianchi L. Becchetti A. Faravelli L.

J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1997; 501: 313-318Crossref Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Recent studies from our laboratory suggest that hERG1 K+channels are influenced by ROS and NO⋅ (22Taglialatela M.

In particular, the outward currents carried by hERG1 K+ channels heterologously expressed in Xenopus oocytes were enhanced by perfusion with a solution containing iron sulfate and ascorbic acid (Fe/Asc), a widely used experimental condition to promote oxidative stress (1Yu B.P. Physiol. Rev. 1994; 74: 139-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (2223) Google Scholar), and were suppressed by the ROS-detoxifying enzyme catalase. In addition, both endogenously produced or pharmacologically delivered NO⋅ was able to inhibit resting hERG1 outward currents and prevented their stimulation by Fe/Asc. These effects appeared to be indirect actions of the gaseous mediator on hERG1 currents, attributable to the potent antioxidant properties of NO⋅ (1Yu B.P. Physiol. Rev. 1994; 74: 139-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (2223) Google Scholar,24Kanner J. Harel S. Granit R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1991; 289: 130-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). The biophysical mechanism by which ROS and RNS modulated hERG1 outward currents without affecting the inward current component was a depolarizing and hyperpolarizing shift, respectively, of the voltage dependence of the steady-state inactivation curve (22Taglialatela M. Castaldo P. Iossa S. Pannaccione A. Fresi A. Ficker E. Annunziato L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11698-11703Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 23Taglialatela M. Pannaccione A.

Nature. 1996; 379: 833-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar). Among the K+ channels investigated, the described modulation by ROS appears to be highly selective for hERG1. In fact, ROS did not affect any channels that were only distantly related to hERG1 (rKv2.1, rKv3.1 and mKIR 2.1) or more closely related to hERG1 (bEAG, rERG2, and rERG3) (16Warmke J.W. Ganetzky B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3438-3442Crossref PubMed Scopus (866) Google Scholar, 26Shi W. Wymore R.S. Wang H.S. Pan Z. Cohen I.S. McKinnon D. Dixon J.E. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 9423-9432Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the present experiments, to localize the molecular regions involved in ROS-induced modulation of hERG1, we have taken advantage of the similarities between the primary sequence of hERG1 and the ROS-insensitive channel bEAG to generate several chimeras encompassing different regions of the genes encoding for these two K+ channel subunits. The results obtained suggested that a critical region for ROS-induced modulation was localized in a 30-amino acid stretch located within the S5-S6 linker region of hERG1. Within this region, the substitution of each of the two histidines at positions 578 and 587 in hERG1 with the corresponding bEAG amino acid removed channel sensitivity to ROS-induced modulation, thus highlighting their participation in the important regulatory mechanism of hERG1 K+ channels. Xenopus oocytes dissociation, maintenance, and microinjection followed standard procedures (23Taglialatela M. Pannaccione A. Castaldo P. Iossa S. Annunziato L. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 56: 1298-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Briefly, ovarian lobes were surgically removed from adult female Xenopus laevis frogs (Rettili di Schneider, Varese, Italy) and placed in 100-mm Petri dishes containing a Ca2+-free solution of the following composition (in millimolar): 82.5 NaCl, 2 KCl, 1MgCl2, 5 HEPES, 2.5 pyruvic acid, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin, pH 7.5, with NaOH. After four extensive washes, the oocytes (stages V–VI) were dissociated by collagenase treatment (type IA, 45–80 min at a concentration of 2 mg/ml). Dissociated oocytes were then placed in a Ca2+-containg solution of the following composition (in millimolar): 100 NaCl, 2 KCl, 1.8 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, 5 HEPES, 2.5 pyruvic acid, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin, pH 7.5, with NaOH, in a 19 °C incubator and used for the experiments on the following day. Lipid peroxidation in Xenopus oocytes was determined by assaying the intracellular malondialdehyde (MDA) production by means of the 2-thiobarbituric acid test (22Taglialatela M. Castaldo P. Iossa S. Pannaccione A. Fresi A. Ficker E. Annunziato L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11698-11703Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), using previously described procedures (27Esterbauer H. Cheeseman K.H. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 186: 407-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (2869) Google Scholar). MDA, in the cell homogenate, was measured using a PerkinElmer Life Sciences LS5B spectrophotofluorometer (excitation 495 nm, emission 530 nm). The cloning ofhERG1 from human hippocampus (16Warmke J.W. Ganetzky B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3438-3442Crossref PubMed Scopus (866) Google Scholar) (GenBankTMaccession number 04270) and of the bovine isoform of EAGfrom brain tissue (28Frings S. Brull N. Dzeja C. Angele A. Hagen V. Kaupp U.B. Baumann A. J. Gen. Physiol. 1998; 111: 583-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) (bEAG, GenBankTMaccession number Y13430) has been already described. BothbEAG and hERG1 cDNAs were subcloned into a modified pSP64 vector. The engineering of some of the constructs used in the present study has been already described (29Ficker E. Jarolimek W. Kiehn J. Baumann A. Brown A.M. Circ. Res. 1998; 82: 386-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Briefly, for engineering of the chimeric constructs hERG1 (bEAG S 1 /S 6), hERG1 (bEAG S 4 -S 5 linker/S 6), and bEAG (hERG1 S 4 -S 5 linker/S 6), the S1-S6 core regions of hERG1 and bEAG were subcloned into pBluescript as BstEII-XhoI andBstBI-KpnI fragments, respectively. By use of codon redundancy, the following silent restriction sites were introduced into hERG1 BstEII-XhoI:NarI (A to G at hERG1 1359),MluI (G to A at hERG1 1782), and KpnI (C to G at hERG1 2199). In addition, an NarI site was destroyed at hERG1 1329 (C to G). The MluI and KpnI sites in hERG1 were introduced in positions equivalent to the naturally occurring MluI andKpnI restriction sites in bEAG. InbEAG BstBI-KpnI, a silentNarI site (A to G at bEAG 803) was engineered in a position equivalent to the one introduced into hERG1 sequence. For the construction of hERG1 (bEAG S 1 -S 6), theNarI-KpnI fragment was excised from thebEAG BstBI-KpnI construct in pBluescript and swapped with the corresponding hERG1fragment in hERG1-pBluescript. In a final step, theBstEII-XhoI fragment was excised and subcloned into full-length hERG1-pSP64 from which the wild-typeBstEII-XhoI fragment had been removed. For construction of bEAG (hERG1 S 4 -S 5 linker/S 6) andhERG1 (bEAG S 4 -S 5 linker/S 6), MluI-KpnI fragments were excised and subcloned into the opposite pBluescript plasmids. In a second step, BstEII-XhoI and BstBI-KpnI fragments were excised and subcloned into full-length hERG1-pSP64 and bEAG-pSP64, respectively. Chimeric constructs hERG1 (bEAG S 5 -S 6 linker),hERG1 (bEAG 573/602), and point mutationshERG1 H578D, hERG1 H587Y, and hERG1H578D/H587Y were generated by overlap extension polymerase chain reaction using the BstEII-XhoI hERG1cassettes generated in pBluescript in which the MluI andKpnI had been introduced as previously described. For all these constructs, the entire MluI-KpnI cassettes were manually sequenced before to subcloning into full-lengthhERG1-pSP64. cDNAs from all these constructs were linearized with the restriction enzymes EcoRI or EcoRV, and cRNAs were in vitro transcribed from linearized cDNAs by means of commercially available kits (mCAP, Stratagene), using SP6 RNA polymerase. RNAs were stored in a stock solution (250 ng/μl) at −20 °C in 0.1 m KCl. One day after isolation,Xenopus oocytes were microinjected with 50 nl of the respective cRNA stock solution or appropriate dilutions. 2–10 days after the cRNA microinjection, K+ currents expressed were measured by the two microelectrode voltage-clamp technique using a commercially available amplifier (Warner OC-725A, Warner Instrument Corp.). Current and voltage electrodes were filled with 3 m KCl, 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4; ∼1 MΩ of resistance). The bath solution contained (in millimolar): 88 NaCl, 10 KCl, 2.6 MgCl2, 0.18 CaCl2, 5 HEPES, pH 7.5 (ND88). This solution was perfused in the recording chamber at a rate of about 0.2 ml/min. Data were stored on the hard disc of a 486 IBM compatible computer for off-line analysis. The pCLAMP (version 6.0.2, Axon Instruments, Burlingame, CA) software was used for data acquisition and analysis. Currents were recorded at room temperature. Oocytes that showed signs of membrane deterioration during the experiment (an increase in the holding current at −90 mV of more than 200 nA) were excluded from the electrophysiological analysis. All the materials used were purchased from Sigma Chemical Co. (Milan, Italy); the NO⋅ donor diethylenetetraamine NONOate (NOC) was obtained from Cayman Chemical (Ann Arbor, MI). Iron sulfate and ascorbate stock solutions (10 and 25 mm, respectively) were prepared daily and stored in light-protected tubes to avoid spontaneous oxidation. All solutions were prepared fresh daily, before the execution of the experiments. Statistical significance between the data was obtained by means of the Student t test. When appropriate, data are expressed as the mean ± S.E. In the figures asterisks denote values statistically different from the controls (p < 0.05). hERG1 K+channels expressed in Xenopus oocytes were activated by depolarizing pulses above −60 mV, displayed pronounced inward rectification at positive potentials (>0 mV) due to a fast C-type inactivation process (17Sanguinetti M.C. Jiang C. Curran M.E. Keating M.T. Cell. 1995; 81: 299-307Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2152) Google Scholar, 25Smith P.L. Baukrowitz T. Yellen G. Nature. 1996; 379: 833-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar), and were specifically modulated by ROS (22Taglialatela M. Castaldo P. Iossa S. Pannaccione A. Fresi A. Ficker E. Annunziato L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11698-11703Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In fact, perfusion of hERG1-expressing oocytes with the ROS-producing Fe/Asc solution (25 and 50 μm, respectively) increased by ∼30% hERG1 outward K+currents evoked by depolarizing steps from −80 mV to +40 mV from a holding voltage of −90 mV (Fig. 1). The increase of hERG1 outward current induced by Fe/Asc was independent on extracellular K+ concentrations ([K+]e), because it was observed with [K+]e ranging from 2 (data not shown) to 42 mm; with 42 mm [K+]e, the outward currents at 0 mV were increased by 26 ± 9% in the presence of Fe/Asc (p > 0.05 versus that observed with 10 mm [K+]e;n = 5). By contrast, the K+ channels encoded by bEAG gave rise to delayed rectifier-like outward currents with activation kinetics strongly dependent on the holding potential and an extremely fast current deactivation at more hyperpolarized membrane potentials. Interestingly, the currents carried by bEAG channels were completely insensitive to Fe/Asc perfusion (Fig. 1), suggesting therefore that bEAG channels are resistant to ROS-induced modulation. To localize the molecular regions involved in ROS-induced modulation of hERG1 K+ channels, we took advantage of the fact that the bEAG K+ channels were insensitive to ROS; thus, segmental exchanges between hERG1 and bEAG K+ channel subunits were performed. Replacement of the “core” region (from the beginning of S1 to the end of S6) of hERG1 with the corresponding region of bEAG (chimeric construct hERG1 (bEAG S1/S6)), led to the expression of K+-selective channels that were insensitive to Fe/Asc perfusion. Similarly, exchange of the region spanning from the beginning of the S4-S5 linker to the end of S6 of hERG1 with the corresponding region of bEAG (hERG1 (bEAG S4-S5 linker/S6)), also led to the disappearance of the channel sensitivity to ROS. Interestingly, the reverse chimeric exchange, namely the replacement of the region between the beginning of the S4-S5 linker region to the end of S6 of bEAG with the corresponding hERG1 sequence (bEAG (hERG1 S4-S5linker/S6)), generated channels having K+currents that were significantly potentiated by Fe/Asc perfusion (Fig.1). These results suggested that the ROS-induced modulation of hERG1 K+ channels required the presence of a specific amino acid sequence in the region located between the S4-S5 linker and the S6transmembrane domain. Within this region, a smaller chimera substituting only the S5-S6 linker of hERG1 with that of bEAG (hERG1 (bEAG S5-S6 linker)) generated K+ channels that were still insensitive to Fe/Asc-induced modulation, suggesting that the molecular determinants for ROS sensitivity of hERG1 are located within the S5-S6 linker. To more specifically localize the amino acids involved in ROS sensitivity within the S5-S6 linker region of hERG1, a smaller chimera (hERG1 (bEAG 573/602)) was generated. In this construct, a 30-amino acid sequence of hERG1 (from the end of the putative S5transmembrane segment to the GGPS amino acid sequence present in both hERG1 and bEAG) was substituted with the corresponding 40-amino acid stretch encoded by bEAG (Fig. 2). The K+ channels encoded by this chimeric construct were completely insensitive to the effects of Fe/Asc (25/50 μm) perfusion (Fig. 1), supporting the idea that residues located within this 30-amino acid sequence of hERG1 are crucially involved in determining the channel sensitivity to ROS. The currents carried by the hERG1 (bEAG 573/602) chimera displayed a selectivity for K+ ions identical to that of wild-type hERG1 channels. With 10 mm K+ ions in the extracellular solution, the reversal potential for the currents carried by wild-type hERG1 channels was −60 ± 0.6 mV (n = 6), whereas that for hERG1 (bEAG 573/602) channels was −57.6 ± 1.6 mV (n = 5) (p > 0.05). Furthermore, the midpoint voltage of channel activation and the slope of the activation curves, calculated as described in the legend for Fig. 3, were, respectively: −32.4 ± 1.07 mV and 8.77 ± 0.8 (n = 4) for wild-type hERG1 and −31.75 ± 1.5 mV and 8.1 ± 0.43 (n = 4) for hERG1 (bEAG 573/602) (p > 0.05). Interestingly, the midpoint voltage of channel inactivation was significantly affected by the mutation, because it was −61.8 ± 1.0 mV (n = 13) for wild-type hERG1 and −68.5 ± 0.6 mV (n = 4) for hERG1 (bEAG 573/602) (p < 0.05). The slopes of the inactivation curves were, respectively, 17.3 ± 0.3 mV and 18.0 ± 0.7 (p > 0.05) for the two channels (Fig.3 A). In addition, the currents carried by the hERG1 (bEAG 573/602) chimeric channels were insensitive not only to perfusion with Fe/Asc but also with the ROS-detoxifying enzyme catalase (1000 units/ml) (Fig.3 B); furthermore, the same chimeric substitution also removed the channel sensitivity to the NO⋅-donor NOC (0.3 mm) (Fig. 3 B). Fig. 3 (C andD) shows the effects of a 5-min perfusion with catalase and NOC, respectively, on the outward K+ currents carried by the channels encoded by wild-type hERG1 and hERG1 (bEAG 573/602). Given the results obtained with the hERG1 (bEAG 573/602) chimera, we engineered a reverse chimeric exchange by transplanting the hERG1 573–602 region into bEAG, to investigate whether this chimeric replacement was sufficient to introduce ROS modulation into ROS-insensitive bEAG channels. Unfortunately, injection ofXenopus oocytes with the cRNA encoded by this chimeric cDNA construct did not lead to the expression of functional channels (data not shown). The results presented showed that the 30-amino acid region in the S5-S6 linker of hERG1 channels substituted in the hERG1 (bEAG 573/602) chimera contains the molecular determinants responsible for the channel sensitivity to ROS-induced modulation. As shown in the alignment of Fig. 2, within this 30-amino acid region, the hERG1 sequence contains two histidines at position 578 and 587, which are not present in the ROS-insensitive bEAG, rERG2, and rERG3 K+ channels. Therefore, the possible involvement of these two histidine residues in the modulation of hERG1 channels by ROS was investigated. As shown in Fig. 4, single point mutations at positions 578 or 587 introducing in hERG1 the corresponding bEAG residues (hERG1 H578D and hERG1 H587Y), as well as the double-substitution hERG1 H578D/H587Y, completely removed the channel sensitivity to the stimulatory effect exerted by Fe/Asc (25/50 μm, respectively). In addition, the inhibition of the outward hERG1 K+ currents caused by catalase (1000 units/ml) and by the NO⋅ donor NOC (0.3 mm) was completely abolished in these histidine-lacking mutant channels. The removal of each of the two histidines caused a leftward shift in the channel voltage dependence of inactivation, without affecting the activation process. In fact, the midpoint voltage of channel activation and the slope of the activation curves were, respectively, −35 ± 0.3 mV and 9.18 ± 0.2 (n = 8) for wild-type hERG1, −37 ± 0.19 mV and 9.1 ± 0.04 (n = 6) for hERG1 H578D, −35.2 ± 0.77 mV and 9.13 ± 0.09 (n = 6) for hERG1 H587Y, and −37 ± 0.6 mV and 8.6 ± 0.08 (n= 7) for hERG1 H578D/H587Y (p > 0.05). On the other hand, the midpoint voltage of channel inactivation and the slope of the inactivation curves were, respectively, −61.8 ± 1.0 mV and 17.3 ± 0.3 (n = 13) for wild-type hERG1, −87.1 ± 1.8 mV (p < 0.05 versushERG1) and 20 ± 0.8 (n = 7) for hERG1 H578D, −69.0 ± 1.2 mV (p < 0.05 versushERG1) and 17.4 ± 0.5 (n = 7) for hERG1 H587Y, and −72.2 ± 0.7 mV (p < 0.05 versushERG1) and 15.3 ± 0.2 (n = 6) for hERG1 H578D/H587Y. To gain more insight into the molecular mechanism by which histidines at position 578 and 587 participate in hERG1 channel modulation by ROS, the possible involvement of iron ions has also been investigated. To this aim, the effect exerted on hERG1 channels by the two iron chelators desferrioxamine (DFX) (6Halliwell B. Gutteridge J.M.C. Free Radicals in Biology and Medicine.2nd Ed. Clarendon Press, Oxford1989: 1-81Google Scholar, 30Lloyd J.B. Cable H. Rice-Evans C. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1991; 41: 1361-1363Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) ando-phenanthroline (PHE) (31Boumans H. van Gaalen M.C. Grivell L.A. Berden J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16753-16760Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), were studied. Perfusion of hERG1-expressing oocytes for 5 min with DFX (1 mm) or PHE (0.2 mm) significantly inhibited the outward K+currents at all the potentials tested between −40 and +40 mV (Fig.5 A), without affecting either the amplitude or the kinetics of the inward currents (data not shown). Interestingly, the inhibitory effect of DFX on hERG1 currents was not reversible upon washout of the iron chelator from the perfusion medium for up to 20 min; however, the presence of 25 μmFeSO4 (with or without 50 μm ascorbic acid) readily increased hERG1 outward currents back to their resting value (Fig. 5 B). These results suggest that the inhibition of hERG1 outward K+ currents by DFX was due to the drug ability to specifically chelate iron ions, rather than being the consequence of an unspecific effect of the molecule or its ability to chelate other metal ions, which are known to influence hERG1 channel function (32Ho W.K. Kim I. Lee C.O. Youm J.B. Lee S.H. Earm Y.E. Biophys. J. 1999; 76: 1959-1971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Furthermore, DFX (1 mm) completely counteracted the stimulatory effect of Fe/Asc (25/50 μm) on the outward K+ currents carried by hERG1 (Fig. 5 C). Interestingly, DFX (1 mm) was also able to prevent the inhibitory action of the ROS-detoxifying enzyme catalase (1000 units/ml) on hERG1 outward K+currents under resting conditions (Fig. 5 D). To test more directly the hypothesis that the iron chelators DFX and PHE might interfere with the oxidating process promoted by iron ions, the effects of DFX and PHE on resting and Fe/Asc-enhanced intracellular malondialdehyde (MDA) production, a direct index of lipid peroxidation, were measured. Both DFX (0.1–1 mm) and PHE (0.2 mm) effectively decreased the basal concentration of MDA (Fig. 6). Furthermore, DFX (1 mm) was able to prevent the Fe/Asc-induced increase in MDA production, confirming that, in the presence of the iron chelator, iron ions are unable to participate in the Fenton reaction and to trigger oxidative stress. To investigate the possible participation of hERG1 histidines at position 578 and 587 in iron-dependent channel modulation by ROS, the effects of the iron chelators DFX and PHE on the histidine-lacking channels hERG1 H578D/H587Y and bEAG were compared with those occurring in wild-type hERG1 channels. Both DFX (1 mm) and PHE (0.2 mm) were without any effect i"

To determine why fCPS I is unable to utilize glutamine, we compared sequences of glutamine-using and non-glutamine-using CPSs to identify residues that are present or conservatively substituted in all glutamine-utilizing CPSs but absent in fCPS I. We constructed the site-directed mutants Q273E, L270K, Q273E/N240S, and Q273E/L270K in E. coli CPS and have determined that simultaneous occurrence of the two substitutions, Gln → Glu and Leu → Lys, found in the frog CPS I glutamine amidotransferase domain are sufficient to eliminate glutamine utilization by the E. coli enzyme.

Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 1935-1941Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the case of the rat and human CPS I, this inability to utilize glutamine is explained by the absence of the critical triad cysteine residue (25Nyunoya H. Broglie K.E. Widgren E.E. Lusty C.J. J.

It is also noteworthy that, in all cases studied, CPS I has an ∼100-fold enhancement of NH3binding relative to that of glutamine-utilizing CPSs. The CPS IK m for NH3 of ∼40 μm(28Cohen N.S. Kyan F.S.

Biol. 1996; 3: 74-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar) reveal a nearly identical topology of β-sheet flanked by α-helices and a β-ribbon. Surprisingly, both structures also display a fairly unformed glutamine specificity pocket (8Zalkin H. Smith J.L. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1998; 72: 87-144PubMed Google Scholar). Apart from the essential triad cysteine 269, the only E. coli CPS side chain groups that have been identified as interacting with glutamine are serine 47 and glutamine 273. S47A and Q273A have 13- and 20-fold increased K m values, respectively, but unchanged rates of glutamine utilization (22Huang X. Raushel F.M. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 15909-15914Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). It has been assumed that conformational changes must occur to yield the known tight specificity of triad GATs for glutamine, but no crystals have yet been obtained with alternate conformations (8Zalkin H. Smith J.L. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1998; 72: 87-144PubMed Google Scholar). In the present work, we have utilized site-directed mutagenesis to further probe the molecular basis for the glutamine specificity inherent in E. coli CPS, for the unexpected inability of frog CPS I to utilize glutamine, and for the dramatic differences in ammonia binding among CPSs. We have targeted for analysis those residues that are conserved in the GAT domains of glutamine-utilizing CPSs but that are not present in frog CPS I.DISCUSSIONOne major goal of the present work was to determine why frog CPS I is unable to utilize glutamine even though it retains the GAT catalytic triad and most of the GAT residues conserved in glutamine-utilizing CPSs. As a prelude to addressing this question, we used native fCPS I to demonstrate for the first time that the enzyme is unable to use glutamine, in keeping with the earlier findings for CPS I from rat and human tissue (24Fahien L.A. Schooler J.M. Gehred G.A. Cohen P.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 1935-1941Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It thus appears that the ability of CPS to bind ammonia tightly, as has been observed only for CPS I, is consistently accompanied by the inability to utilize glutamine. We have determined that simultaneous occurrence of two substitutions found in the fCPS I GAT domain, Q273E and L270K, are sufficient to eliminate glutamine utilization by E. coli CPS. The Q273E/L270K mutant showed negligible glutamine binding, no detectable glutamine hydrolysis, and no detectable glutamine-dependent CP synthesis. In striking contrast, the double mutant had an unchangedk cat for ammonia-dependent CP synthesis relative to that for wild type eCPS and displayed tighter binding of ammonia.Of the two single mutations, L270K had a much greater impact on the ability of eCPS to utilize glutamine with negligible glutamine binding under the selective binding study conditions, 25-fold elevatedK m for glutamine, and 10-fold slower rate of carrying out glutamine-dependent CP synthesis (Table IV). The Q273E mutant showed more moderate effects, with a 10-fold reduction in glutamine binding under selective binding conditions, a 2-fold higher K m for glutamine, and a 4-fold slower rate of carrying out glutamine-dependent CP synthesis (Table IV). Interestingly, the sole effect of the more charge-conservative Q273A mutation was to increase the K m for glutamine by 20-fold (22Huang X. Raushel F.M. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 15909-15914Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). For wild type eCPS, Q273A, and Q273E, respectively, theK m values for glutamine were 0.16, 2.1, and 0.24 mm, and the k cat values were 9.1, 9.9, and 1.9 s−1. Like Q273E/L270K, both Q273E and L270K displayed wild type rates for ammonia-dependent CP synthesis, indicating no major disruption of the SYN component in any of the mutants. However, the synergistic effect of the double mutation on glutamine usage, with Q273E/L270K completely incapable of utilizing glutamine, whereas the two component mutations were much less crippled, suggests a significant disruption of GAT active site structure when both changes occur simultaneously in the glutamine binding pocket.As a first step toward assessing the structural effects of the present mutations, we have modeled these changes in silico using the wild type eCPS structure as a scaffold (Swiss-Model, Glaxo Wellcome; Fig. 2) (42Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2714-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (9474) Google Scholar, 43Peitsch M.C. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1996; 24: 274-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (898) Google Scholar). In this model, substitution of the leucine residue at position 270 with the longer lysine side chain results in a more constrictive architecture imposed on the glutamine binding pocket. It appears that glutamine could be partially occluded, the thioester intermediate could be positioned in a manner unfavorable for efficient hydrolysis, and/or the channel connecting the GAT active site to the SYN component could be blocked. Based on x-ray crystallography data, Huang and Raushel (44Huang X. Raushel F.M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 3240-3247Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) suggest the involvement of 10 residues, Ser-35, Met-36, Asp-45, Lys-202, Gly-293, Ala-309, Asn-311, His-353, Pro-358, Gly-359, in formation of this channel. Site-directed mutagenesis analysis of these residues primarily implicated Gly-359, with kinetic parameters for the G359Y and G359F proteins indicating impaired glutamine utilization. The spatial clustering of the three residues targeted for mutagenesis in our study is distinct from the previously identified channel residues and may impact glutamine utilization at the point of entry of glutamine into the channel as opposed to constricting the diameter of the passage farther down (Fig.4). Precluding entry of glutamine would be an efficient mechanism for non-glutamine utilizing CPS Is to adopt and could explain why fCPS I remains unable to utilize this substrate despite retaining the appropriate catalytic machinery.In wild type eCPS, the amide nitrogen of Gln-273 appears to form a hydrogen bond with the α-carboxylate of glutamine and thereby helps to correctly position both the substrate and the intermediates derived from it (12Thoden J.B. Miran S.G. Phillips J.C. Howard A.J. Raushel F.M. Holden H.M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 8825-8831Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 22Huang X. Raushel F.M. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 15909-15914Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The Q273E mutation would alter this interaction since it replaces the hydrophilic amide with a negatively charged oxygen and might well result in a more extended alteration of the wild type pattern of hydrogen bonds and salt bridges since the model predicts that the orientation of the mutant side chain is very different from that of the wild type.These mutants also provide some insight into the molecular basis for the varying ammonia selectivity that occurs in CPSs. In mammals, the hepatic [NH3 + NH 4+] is maintained at about 0.5 mm, and coma and death result when this level is exceeded (45Powers-Lee S.G. Meister A. Arias I.M. Jakoby W.B. Popper H. Schachter D. Shafritz D.A. The Liver: Biology and Pathology. Raven Press, Ltd., New York1988: 317-329Google Scholar). CPS I from various sources has an ammoniumK m of 1–2 mm (equivalent to 40 μm ammonia) that allows it to effectively detoxify excess ammonia, but the enzyme is completely unable to utilize glutamine. In contrast, eCPS has a K m for ammonium of 96 mm that would preclude serving in ammonia detoxification but can efficiently utilize glutamine, with a K m of 0.2 mm. In addition to mirroring CPS I in its inability to utilize glutamine, the Q273E/L270K double mutant of eCPS has a 4-fold decrease in ammonium K m and a corresponding 4-fold increase in its efficiency for utilizing ammonium. Similarly, the G359Y and G359F mutants designed to block the ammonia channel (44Huang X. Raushel F.M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 3240-3247Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) displayed 8–11-fold decreases in the ammonium K m . Clearly, additional structural differences in eCPS and CPS I must contribute to their much larger difference in ammonium K m . However, this movement of the double mutant toward a smallerK m is more significant than the actual measured value since the double mutant must “offset” the 6-fold increase in ammonium K m observed for the Q273E single mutant.Because ammonia-dependent CP synthesis occurs entirely on the SYN component, and since this activity is altered in Q273E and Q273E/L270K, structural effects of these mutations must be communicated across the GAT domain interface to the SYN component. This cross-subunit communication is also evidenced in the alteration of uncoupled ATP hydrolysis that is localized to the first ATP site of the SYN component. Q273E/L270K shows a 10-fold rate increase, suggesting that there has been a relaxation of the structural constraints normally limiting ATP hydrolysis in the absence of an ammonia source.These studies have also provided the first suggestion of communication between the GAT and allosteric domains. In wild type eCPS, ornithine (4Thoden J.B. Holden H.M. Wesenberg G. Raushel F.M. Rayment I. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6305-6316Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar, 15Liu X. Guy H.I. Evans D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27747-27755Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and UMP (16Cervera J. Bendala E. Britton H.G. Bueso J. Nassif Z. Lusty C.J. Rubio V. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7247-7255Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) bind at the allosteric domain, and this occupancy is communicated to alter utilization of ATP, primarily at the second ATP-utilizing domain and slightly at the first ATP-utilizing domain (21Meister A. Powers S.G. Adv. Enzyme Regul. 1978; 16: 289-315Crossref Scopus (22) Google Scholar). It has also been well established for wild type eCPS that there is two-way communication of occupancy of the GAT and first ATP-utilizing domains. However, Q273E has a greatly decreased response to the activator ornithine while retaining responsiveness to the inhibitor UMP. Therefore, a structural change resulting from the Q273E mutation must be communicated to the allosteric domain itself and/or to the second ATP-utilizing domain. Q273E/L270K displays enhanced responsiveness to ornithine at the first ATP-utilizing domain, as evidenced by a 30-fold increase in the uncoupled ATPase activity when ornithine is present. It thus appears that the structural effects of the Q273E mutation are communicated throughout all or most of the SYN component. Whereas the single Q273E mutation serves as a long range effector of binding site linkages but has only a small effect on glutamine utilization, the single L270K mutation shows wild type communication among domains but provides a significant loss of glutamine utilization. A detailed elucidation of how these two mutations combine to yield a eCPS mutant incapable of utilizing glutamine will most likely require solution of CPS I crystal structures as well as structures of eCPS mutants incorporating CPS I features.

Biol. 1998; 72: 87-144PubMed Google Scholar, 29Tesmer J.J. Klem T.J. Deras M.L. Davisson V.J. Smith J.L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 74-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar) reveal a nearly identical topology of β-sheet flanked by α-helices and a β-ribbon. Surprisingly, both structures also display a fairly unformed glutamine specificity pocket (8Zalkin H. Smith J.L. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1998; 72: 87-144PubMed Google Scholar). Apart from the essential triad cysteine 269, the only E. coli CPS side chain groups that have been identified as interacting with glutamine are serine 47 and glutamine 273. S47A and Q273A have 13- and 20-fold increased K m values, respectively, but unchanged rates of glutamine utilization (22Huang X. Raushel F.M. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 15909-15914Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). It has been assumed that conformational changes must occur to yield the known tight specificity of triad GATs for glutamine, but no crystals have yet been obtained with alternate conformations (8Zalkin H. Smith J.L. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1998; 72: 87-144PubMed Google Scholar). In the present work, we have utilized site-directed mutagenesis to further probe the molecular basis for the glutamine specificity inherent in E. coli CPS, for the unexpected inability of frog CPS I to utilize glutamine, and for the dramatic differences in ammonia binding among CPSs. We have targeted for analysis those residues that are conserved in the GAT domains of glutamine-utilizing CPSs but that are not present in frog CPS I. DISCUSSIONOne major goal of the present work was to determine why frog CPS I is unable to utilize glutamine even though it retains the GAT catalytic triad and most of the GAT residues conserved in glutamine-utilizing CPSs. As a prelude to addressing this question, we used native fCPS I to demonstrate for the first time that the enzyme is unable to use glutamine, in keeping with the earlier findings for CPS I from rat and human tissue (24Fahien L.A. Schooler J.M. Gehred G.A. Cohen P.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 1935-1941Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It thus appears that the ability of CPS to bind ammonia tightly, as has been observed only for CPS I, is consistently accompanied by the inability to utilize glutamine. We have determined that simultaneous occurrence of two substitutions found in the fCPS I GAT domain, Q273E and L270K, are sufficient to eliminate glutamine utilization by E. coli CPS. The Q273E/L270K mutant showed negligible glutamine binding, no detectable glutamine hydrolysis, and no detectable glutamine-dependent CP synthesis. In striking contrast, the double mutant had an unchangedk cat for ammonia-dependent CP synthesis relative to that for wild type eCPS and displayed tighter binding of ammonia.Of the two single mutations, L270K had a much greater impact on the ability of eCPS to utilize glutamine with negligible glutamine binding under the selective binding study conditions, 25-fold elevatedK m for glutamine, and 10-fold slower rate of carrying out glutamine-dependent CP synthesis (Table IV). The Q273E mutant showed more moderate effects, with a 10-fold reduction in glutamine binding under selective binding conditions, a 2-fold higher K m for glutamine, and a 4-fold slower rate of carrying out glutamine-dependent CP synthesis (Table IV). Interestingly, the sole effect of the more charge-conservative Q273A mutation was to increase the K m for glutamine by 20-fold (22Huang X. Raushel F.M. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 15909-15914Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). For wild type eCPS, Q273A, and Q273E, respectively, theK m values for glutamine were 0.16, 2.1, and 0.24 mm, and the k cat values were 9.1, 9.9, and 1.9 s−1. Like Q273E/L270K, both Q273E and L270K displayed wild type rates for ammonia-dependent CP synthesis, indicating no major disruption of the SYN component in any of the mutants. However, the synergistic effect of the double mutation on glutamine usage, with Q273E/L270K completely incapable of utilizing glutamine, whereas the two component mutations were much less crippled, suggests a significant disruption of GAT active site structure when both changes occur simultaneously in the glutamine binding pocket.As a first step toward assessing the structural effects of the present mutations, we have modeled these changes in silico using the wild type eCPS structure as a scaffold (Swiss-Model, Glaxo Wellcome; Fig. 2) (42Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2714-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (9474) Google Scholar, 43Peitsch M.C. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1996; 24: 274-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (898) Google Scholar). In this model, substitution of the leucine residue at position 270 with the longer lysine side chain results in a more constrictive architecture imposed on the glutamine binding pocket. It appears that glutamine could be partially occluded, the thioester intermediate could be positioned in a manner unfavorable for efficient hydrolysis, and/or the channel connecting the GAT active site to the SYN component could be blocked. Based on x-ray crystallography data, Huang and Raushel (44Huang X. Raushel F.M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 3240-3247Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) suggest the involvement of 10 residues, Ser-35, Met-36, Asp-45, Lys-202, Gly-293, Ala-309, Asn-311, His-353, Pro-358, Gly-359, in formation of this channel. Site-directed mutagenesis analysis of these residues primarily implicated Gly-359, with kinetic parameters for the G359Y and G359F proteins indicating impaired glutamine utilization. The spatial clustering of the three residues targeted for mutagenesis in our study is distinct from the previously identified channel residues and may impact glutamine utilization at the point of entry of glutamine into the channel as opposed to constricting the diameter of the passage farther down (Fig.4). Precluding entry of glutamine would be an efficient mechanism for non-glutamine utilizing CPS Is to adopt and could explain why fCPS I remains unable to utilize this substrate despite retaining the appropriate catalytic machinery.In wild type eCPS, the amide nitrogen of Gln-273 appears to form a hydrogen bond with the α-carboxylate of glutamine and thereby helps to correctly position both the substrate and the intermediates derived from it (12Thoden J.B. Miran S.G. Phillips J.C. Howard A.J. Raushel F.M. Holden H.M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 8825-8831Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 22Huang X. Raushel F.M. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 15909-15914Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The Q273E mutation would alter this interaction since it replaces the hydrophilic amide with a negatively charged oxygen and might well result in a more extended alteration of the wild type pattern of hydrogen bonds and salt bridges since the model predicts that the orientation of the mutant side chain is very different from that of the wild type.These mutants also provide some insight into the molecular basis for the varying ammonia selectivity that occurs in CPSs. In mammals, the hepatic [NH3 + NH 4+] is maintained at about 0.5 mm, and coma and death result when this level is exceeded (45Powers-Lee S.G. Meister A. Arias I.M. Jakoby W.B. Popper H. Schachter D. Shafritz D.A. The Liver: Biology and Pathology. Raven Press, Ltd., New York1988: 317-329Google Scholar). CPS I from various sources has an ammoniumK m of 1–2 mm (equivalent to 40 μm ammonia) that allows it to effectively detoxify excess ammonia, but the enzyme is completely unable to utilize glutamine. In contrast, eCPS has a K m for ammonium of 96 mm that would preclude serving in ammonia detoxification but can efficiently utilize glutamine, with a K m of 0.2 mm. In addition to mirroring CPS I in its inability to utilize glutamine, the Q273E/L270K double mutant of eCPS has a 4-fold decrease in ammonium K m and a corresponding 4-fold increase in its efficiency for utilizing ammonium. Similarly, the G359Y and G359F mutants designed to block the ammonia channel (44Huang X. Raushel F.M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 3240-3247Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) displayed 8–11-fold decreases in the ammonium K m . Clearly, additional structural differences in eCPS and CPS I must contribute to their much larger difference in ammonium K m . However, this movement of the double mutant toward a smallerK m is more significant than the actual measured value since the double mutant must “offset” the 6-fold increase in ammonium K m observed for the Q273E single mutant.Because ammonia-dependent CP synthesis occurs entirely on the SYN component, and since this activity is altered in Q273E and Q273E/L270K, structural effects of these mutations must be communicated across the GAT domain interface to the SYN component. This cross-subunit communication is also evidenced in the alteration of uncoupled ATP hydrolysis that is localized to the first ATP site of the SYN component. Q273E/L270K shows a 10-fold rate increase, suggesting that there has been a relaxation of the structural constraints normally limiting ATP hydrolysis in the absence of an ammonia source.These studies have also provided the first suggestion of communication between the GAT and allosteric domains. In wild type eCPS, ornithine (4Thoden J.B. Holden H.M. Wesenberg G. Raushel F.M. Rayment I. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6305-6316Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar, 15Liu X. Guy H.I. Evans D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27747-27755Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and UMP (16Cervera J. Bendala E. Britton H.G. Bueso J. Nassif Z. Lusty C.J. Rubio V. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7247-7255Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) bind at the allosteric domain, and this occupancy is communicated to alter utilization of ATP, primarily at the second ATP-utilizing domain and slightly at the first ATP-utilizing domain (21Meister A. Powers S.G. Adv. Enzyme Regul. 1978; 16: 289-315Crossref Scopus (22) Google Scholar). It has also been well established for wild type eCPS that there is two-way communication of occupancy of the GAT and first ATP-utilizing domains. However, Q273E has a greatly decreased response to the activator ornithine while retaining responsiveness to the inhibitor UMP. Therefore, a structural change resulting from the Q273E mutation must be communicated to the allosteric domain itself and/or to the second ATP-utilizing domain. Q273E/L270K displays enhanced responsiveness to ornithine at the first ATP-utilizing domain, as evidenced by a 30-fold increase in the uncoupled ATPase activity when ornithine is present. It thus appears that the structural effects of the Q273E mutation are communicated throughout all or most of the SYN component. Whereas the single Q273E mutation serves as a long range effector of binding site linkages but has only a small effect on glutamine utilization, the single L270K mutation shows wild type communication among domains but provides a significant loss of glutamine utilization. A detailed elucidation of how these two mutations combine to yield a eCPS mutant incapable of utilizing glutamine will most likely require solution of CPS I crystal structures as well as structures of eCPS mutants incorporating CPS I features. One major goal of the present work was to determine why frog CPS I is unable to utilize glutamine even though it retains the GAT catalytic triad and most of the GAT residues conserved in glutamine-utilizing CPSs.
