https://openalex.org/W1540937567,"Rat hearts have been perfused in vitro with 5 mM glucose and either 5 mM acetate or 1 mM pyruvate to achieve steady state conditions, followed by replacement of the acetate with 90% enriched [2-13C]acetate or pyruvate with 90% enriched [3-13C]pyruvate. The hearts were frozen different times after addition of 13C-substrate and neutralized perchloric acid extracts from three pooled hearts per time point were used to obtain high resolution proton-decoupled 13C NMR spectra at 90.55 MHz. The 13C fractional enrichment of individual carbons of different metabolites was calculated from the area of the resolved resonances after correction for nuclear Overhauser enhancement and saturation effects. A mathematical flux model of the citric acid cycle and ancillary transamination reactions was constructed with the FACSIMILE program, and used to solve unknown flux parameters with constant pool sizes by nonlinear least squares analysis of the approximately 200 simultaneous differential equations required to describe the reactions. With [2-13C] acetate as substrate, resonances and line splittings due to 13C-13C spin coupling of the C-2, C-3, and C-4 carbons of glutamate were well resolved. The half-times to reach maximum 13C enrichment were 2.6 min for glutamate C-4 and 8 min for glutamate C-2 and C-3. From these data, a well determined citric acid cycle flux of 8.3 mumol/g dry weight X min was calculated for an observed oxygen consumption of 31 mumol/g dry weight X min. With [3-13C]pyruvate as substrate, resonances of aspartate C-2 and C-3 and of alanine C-3 were well resolved in addition to those of glutamate C-2, C-3, and C-4. Nonlinear least squares fitting of these data to the model gave nonrandomly distributed residuals for the 13C fractional enrichments of glutamate C-4, suggesting an incomplete model, but a well determined cycle flux of 11.9 mumol/g dry weight X min for an oxygen uptake of 35 mumol/g dry weight X min. Our studies demonstrate the practicality of 13C NMR, used in conjunction with mathematical modeling, for the measurement of metabolic flux parameters in living systems."
https://openalex.org/W1480345605,"We examined the role of pH gradient and membrane potential in dipeptide transport in purified intestinal and renal brush-border membrane vesicles which were predominantly oriented right-side out. With an intravesicular pH of 7.5, changes in extravesicular pH significantly affected the transport of glycyl-L-proline and L-carnosine, and optimal dipeptide transport occurred at an extravesicular pH of 5.5-6.0 in both intestine and kidney. When the extravesicular pH was 5.5, glycyl-L-proline transport was accelerated 2-fold by the presence of an inward proton gradient. A valinomycin-induced K+ diffusion potential (interior-negative) stimulated glycyl-L-proline transport, and the stimulation was observed in the presence and absence of Na+. A carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone-induced H+ diffusion potential (interior-positive) reduced dipeptide transport. It is suggested that glycyl-L-proline and proton(s) are cotransported in intestinal and renal brush-border membrane vesicles, and that the process results in a net transfer of positive charge."
https://openalex.org/W1952406478,"The effect of mastoparan, Ile-Asn-Leu-Lys-Ala-Leu-Ala-Ala-Leu-Ala-Lys-Lys-Ile-LeuNH2, and related peptides on the release of arachidonic acid from egg yolk lecithin liposomes, rat peritoneal mast cells, and cultured human fibroblasts was studied. In unsonicated liposomes, labeled with 1-stearoyl-2[1-14C]arachidonyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, 5 X 10(-5) M mastoparan caused a 12-, 15-, and 50-fold increase in the production of arachidonic acid catalyzed by phospholipase A2 from bee venom, eastern diamondback rattlesnake and porcine pancreas, respectively. The stimulant effect of mastoparan and related peptides was dose-dependent and further enhanced by sonication of liposomes. In contrast, melittin, while stimulating the production of arachidonic acid by phospholipase from bee venom, was inactive with the rattlesnake and pancreatic enzymes. Melittin was also only weakly active with liposomes containing stearic acid in place of arachidonic acid. Like melittin, mastoparans stimulated phospholipase activity in tissue homogenates and caused a dose-dependent release of arachidonic acid from rat peritoneal mast cells and cultured human fibroblasts prelabeled with [14C]arachidonic acid. The heptapeptide fragments mastoparan 1-7 and mastoparan 8-14, and succinylated mastoparan were ineffective. The results suggest that mastoparan and related peptides in insect venoms act, at least in part, by stimulating phospholipase activity."
https://openalex.org/W2172271037,"Extraction of rat liver cytosol with charcoal inactivates glucocorticoid-binding capacity and receptors can be reactivated to the steroid-binding state by an endogenous reducing system utilizing NADPH and a Mr = 12,000, heat-stable, endogenous, cytosolic protein (Grippo, J. F., Tienrungroj, W., Dahmer, M. K., Housley, P. R., and Pratt, W. B. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 13658-13664). In this paper we show that NADPH-dependent conversion of the rat liver glucocorticoid receptor from a nonbinding to a steroid-binding form is blocked in an immune-specific manner by antisera raised against purified rat liver thioredoxin reductase or thioredoxin. The inhibition produced by thioredoxin reductase antiserum may be circumvented by dithiothreitol or overcome by addition of purified thioredoxin reductase. These observations prove that the endogenous glucocorticoid receptor-activating factor is thioredoxin and that the enzyme required for generating the steroid-binding conformation of the glucocorticoid receptor by the endogenous receptor-activating system is thioredoxin reductase."
https://openalex.org/W1508352585,"The amounts of actin and myosin in rabbit neutrophils expressed as micrograms/10(6) cells are 5.6 +/- 0.75 and 0.56 +/- 0.08, respectively. The average value of the total actin in rabbit neutrophils under unstimulated conditions is distributed between Triton X-100 soluble fraction (74 +/- 7%) and Triton X-100 insoluble fraction (26 +/- 3%). The Triton X-100 soluble and insoluble fractions will be referred to as the cytoplasmic and the cytoskeletal components. When the cells are stimulated by the chemotactic factor formyl-Met-Leu-Phe the amount of actin associated with the cytoskeleton increases to 73.7 +/- 6% of the total cell actin. This increase is rapid, dose-dependent and mediated through fMet-Leu-Phe receptors. Neither the time course of the response nor the dose-response curve is affected by the removal of calcium from the suspending medium. Calcium ions at concentrations greater than 10(-7) M added after Triton X-100 extraction dissociate actin from the cytoskeleton. Calcium at 1.9 microM added after Triton X-100 extraction reduces the amount of cytoskeletal actin under control and stimulated conditions to 10.3 +/- 0.9 and 33 +/- 1.5% of the total cell actin, respectively. The average value of the total myosin in rabbit neutrophils under unstimulated conditions is distributed between the cytosol (32 +/- 10%) and the cytoskeleton (68 +/- 18%). When neutrophils are stimulated with the chemotactic factor fMet-Leu-Phe the amount of myosin associated with the cytoskeleton does not increase significantly. Cytochalasin B decreases cytoskeletal actin and myosin and causes a shift in the amount of actin and myosin from the cytoskeleton to the cytoplasm both under fMet-Leu-Phe-stimulated and control conditions. In the presence of 1.6 mM extracellular Ca2+ and cytochalasin B (5 micrograms/ml) the amount of actin associated with the cytoskeleton under control and stimulated conditions is reduced to 13 +/- 2.2 and 10.2 +/- 3.5% of total cell actin, and that of myosin is reduced to 50.2 +/- 14 and 2.3 +/- 0.8% of the total cell myosin. The effect of cytochalasin B on actin does not depend on the time of its addition relative to that of fMet-Leu-Phe and is more pronounced in the presence of Ca2+. These results are discussed in terms of the roles of cytochalasin B and calcium in the overall mechanism of neutrophil degranulation induced by chemotactic factors."
https://openalex.org/W2151254922,"Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) highly purified from urine of the patient with choriocarcinoma contains four asparagine-linked sugar chains in one molecule. The sugar chains were quantitatively liberated as radioactive oligosaccharides from polypeptide portion by hydrazinolysis followed by N-acetylation and NaB3H4 reduction. The structures of these sugar chains were determined by the combination of sequential glycosidase digestion, periodate oxidation, and methylation analysis. As compared with the sugar chains of normal urinary and placental hCG reported previously, they include several prominent structural differences. More than 97% of the sugar chains of choriocarcinoma hCG was free from sialic acid, while the sugar chains of normal hCG were mostly sialylated. Choriocarcinoma hCG contains unusual biantennary complex-type sugar chains in addition to regular tri-, bi-, and monoantennary sugar chains. These sugar chains have two outer chains linked at the C-2 and C-4 positions of the same alpha-mannosyl residue of the trimannosyl core. Since normal hCG does not contain any triantennary sugar chains, occurrence of Gal beta 1 leads to 4GlcNAc beta 1 leads to 4Man alpha 1 leads to group is another characteristic feature of the sugar chains of choriocarcinoma hCG. The evidence that the monoantennary sugar chain of Man alpha 1 leads to 6(Gal beta 1 leads to 4GlcNAc beta 1 leads to 2Man alpha 1 leads to 3)Man beta 1 leads to 4GlcNAc beta 1 leads to 4(Fuc alpha 1 leads to 6)GlcNAc leads to Asn is not found in normal hCG and the sum total of fucosylated sugar chains is 50%, which is twice as much as normal hCG, indicated that fucosylation is also modified in choriocarcinoma tissue."
https://openalex.org/W1485537415,"The Ca2+-binding component of troponin (TnC) and its proteolytic fragments containing Ca2+-binding sites I-III (TH1) or sites III and IV (TR2C) have been labeled with the fluorescent probes dansylaziridine (DANZ) at methionine 25 or 5-(iodoacetamidoethyl)amino-naphthalene-1-sulfonic acid (AEDANS) at cysteine-98. These probes report binding of Ca2+ to the low and high affinity sites, respectively. Fluorescence changes as a function of [Ca2+] were measured for the free peptides, their complexes with troponin I + troponin T, and these complexes bound to actin-tropomyosin in the presence of Mg2+ and ATP with and without myosin. An apparent Hill coefficient of 1.0-1.1 has been obtained for the Ca2+-induced fluorescence changes in TnC, its fragments, and their ternary complexes regardless of the label used. When a ternary complex containing appropriately labeled TnC or its fragment is bound to the actin-tropomyosin complex, the Hill coefficient for the titration of the low affinity sites increases to 1.5-1.6 and further increases to greater than 2 in the presence of myosin. To interpret the apparent Hill coefficients, we used a model containing two binding sites and a single reporter of the conformational change. Hill coefficients between 1.0 and 1.2 can be obtained for the fluorescence change without true cooperativity in metal binding, depending on the mechanism of the fluorescence change; i.e. the contribution of the singly or doubly occupied species to the fluorescence change. A Hill coefficient between 1.2 and 2, however, always indicates cooperativity in binding independently of the mechanism. Thus, our finding that fluorescence titrations of Ca2+ binding to TnCDANZ bound to actin-tropomyosin exhibit a Hill coefficient of 1.5 in the absence of myosin and 2.4 in its presence indicates the existence of true positive cooperativity in metal binding to sites I and II. No cooperativity was observed for AEDANS-labeled complexes that reflect Ca2+-binding to the high affinity sites. Plots of the Ca2+ dependence of myosin ATPase activity activated by actin-tropomyosin in the presence of any of the troponin complexes used had apparent Hill coefficients of approximately 4. The higher value suggests cooperative interactions in the activation of ATPase beyond those involved in Ca2+-binding to the Ca2+-specific sites."
https://openalex.org/W1582306666,"Factor V appears to be a procofactor with, at best, 1/400 the activity of fully activated Factor V (Factor Va). The proteolytic conversion of Factor V to Factor Va is catalyzed by thrombin. However, since Factor Va activity is required for thrombin generation, the initial participation of Factor V in the expression of prothrombinase activity is not well understood. In the present study, the activation of Factor V by Factor Xa has been investigated. Cofactor activation was assessed by monitoring the conversion of prethrombin-1 to thrombin in the presence of 5-dimethylamino-naphthalene-1-sulfonylarginine-N-(3-ethyl-1,5-pentanediyl)amide (DAPA). The DAPA not only provided a fluorescent signal for the formation of thrombin, but also attenuated the feedback activation of Factor V by thrombin. Trace quantities of Factor Va were removed from the Factor V preparations by immunoadsorption with immobilized murine monoclonal antibodies selective for Factor Va. The incubation of Factor V with Factor Xa in the presence of phosphatidylcholine/phosphatidylserine vesicles, CaCl2, and DAPA resulted in a time-dependent increase in cofactor activity. Phosphatidylcholine/phosphatidylserine vesicles were not absolutely required, but the rate of Factor V activation was significantly enhanced by inclusion of the vesicles. The activation was absolutely dependent upon Factor Xa and was eliminated by immunoadsorption of the Factor Xa preparation with a murine anti-Factor X (Xa) monoclonal antibody coupled to agarose. The activation was not affected by immunoadsorption of the Factor Xa and Factor V preparations with burro polyclonal anti-prothrombin IgG. Most of the products of the Factor Xa activation of Factor V differ from the products derived by the thrombin-catalyzed activation of the procofactor. The results demonstrate that Factor Xa catalyzes the activation of Factor V. Furthermore, these studies suggest that the Factor Xa activation of Factor V may be responsible for the advent of early prothrombinase activity."
https://openalex.org/W1483424465,"The O2, CO, and alkyl isocyanide-binding properties of a variety of vertebrate and invertebrate heme proteins have been compared in detail to those of protoheme mono-3-(1-imidazoyl)-propylamide monomethyl ester in aqueous suspensions of soap micelles. The proteins examined include: cytochrome P-450cam from Pseudomonas putida, beef heart cytochrome c oxidase, yeast cytochrome c peroxidase, alpha and beta subunits of human hemoglobin, sheep hemoglobin, carp hemoglobin, sperm whale myoglobin, horse heart myoglobin, a monomeric hemoglobin from Glycera dibranchiata, erythrocruorin from Chironomusthummii, soybean leghemoglobin, and several hemoglobins that lack distal histidines. The smallest bimolecular rates were observed for cytochrome P-450 containing bound camphor, cytochrome c oxidase, and cytochrome c peroxidase. In the case of P-450, the extremely low isonitrile binding rates (approximately 1 M-1 S-1 at 20 degrees C) are due to steric exclusion by bound camphor molecules. For the oxidase and peroxidase, inhibition of CO and isonitrile binding appears to be due to the polar nature of the active sites. In the cases of animal hemoglobins and myoglobins, the sixth coordination positions appear to be designed to accommodate diatomic molecules with no steric hindrance by distal protein residues. Protein resistance to the diffusion of CO and O2 does not limit the observed association rate constants. In contrast, ligands containing three or more atoms are sterically hindered both in their final bound positions and during diffusion to the active site. The magnitude of this hindrance (greater than or equal to 2 kcal/mol) exhibits a complex dependence on ligand size and shape. The most important protein residue appears to be His E7. In addition to restricting the size of the sixth coordination position, the distal histidine is also capable of forming a hydrogen bond with bound oxygen molecules. The strength of this hydrogen bond was estimated to be -2 and -1 kcal/mol for mammalian myoglobins and hemoglobins, respectively, and accounts for the smaller CO/O2 partition constants (M values) observed for these proteins in comparison to the constants observed for pentacoordinate model heme compounds."
https://openalex.org/W1532467465,"Abstract The phase equilibria of human very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) and monkey chylomicron lipids was examined. Triglyceride (TG), cholesterol ester (CE), and cholesterol (C) partitioned into both surface monolayer and oil phases of emulsions of lipoprotein lipids, whereas phospholipid was found exclusively in the surface. In addition to phospholipid, the surface lipids consisted of 2-4% (by weight) TG, less than 1% CE, and 22% C (VLDL), 5-8% C (chylomicrons). The oil lipids consisted mainly of TG, but also 13-16% CE (VLDL), 3% CE (chylomicrons), and 1-2% C (VLDL), 0.3-0.4% C (chylomicrons). The equilibrium state of lipids within size subfractions of native lipoproteins was defined using phase diagram analysis. Subfractions were in equilibrium with respect to surface-to-core and interparticle distributions of C molecules. In contrast, subfracitions were not in a state of interparticle TG and CE equilibrium. By using the phase diagrams, the percentages of the total particle lipids carried in the phases of lipoproteins of varying size were calculated. For Sf greater than 400 particles, greater than or equal to 30% of the total particle C molecules are carried in the core, and less than 3% of the TG and CE molecules are located in the surface. Nascent, plasma, remnant, and beta-migrating TG-rich lipoprotein compositions taken from the literature were compared using phase diagrams. Although the total compositions of nascent liver VLDL and lymph chylomicrons vary substantially, they have identical concentrations of C in their respective phases. Upon equilibration with plasma, the surface and core of nascent TG-rich lipoproteins become enriched (2-4-fold) with C. Remnants and beta-VLDL have the most C-rich phases of the TG-rich lipoproteins examined. The analysis indicates that the C concentrations of the phases of a lipoprotein are related to its metabolic status."
https://openalex.org/W1551355725,"The Mn-catalase of Lactobacillus plantarum was inactivated when exposed to NH2OH plus H2O2, an effect which was not reversed by dialysis. N-Methylhydroxylamine was approximately 1% as effective as was NH2OH, while O-methylhydroxylamine was not detectably active in this regard. Approximately 40% of the lost activity could be restored by dithionite or by O-2, whereas other reductants such as ethanol, ascorbate, or nitrite were without effect. Oxidants such as persulfate and ferricyanide also failed to reactivate the enzyme. The active enzyme was inactivated, to an apparent limit of 50%, by an enzymic or photochemical flux of O-2 and this was entirely prevented by superoxide dismutase. The catalytic cycle of the enzyme is thought to involve the trivalent and pentavalent forms of the active site Mn; while inactivation by H2O2 + NH2OH appears to be due to conversion to the quadrivalent state. Partial bleaching of the enzyme by H2O2 and the nearly complete bleaching caused by NH2OH + H2O2 are in accord with this interpretation. The enzyme was unaffected by 2.0 mM EDTA, thiourea, o-phenanthroline, alpha, alpha'-dipyridyl, 8-hydroxyquinoline, diethyldithiocarbamate, thiourea, hydrazine, phenylhydrazine, isoniazid, semicarbazide, sulfite, nitrite, or sulfide, all at pH 7.0."

https://openalex.org/W1556948298,"Alterations in ribosomal function were examined following phosphorylation of 40 S ribosomal subunits by the cAMP-dependent protein kinase and two cAMP-independent protein kinases, protease-activated kinases I and II. The cAMP-dependent protein kinase incorporated 2.0 mol of phosphate/mol of 40 S ribosomal subunits; ribosomal protein S6 was the sole phosphate acceptor. Phosphorylation of 40 S ribosomal subunits by the cAMP-dependent protein kinase inhibited the binding of AUG by 41% and poly(A,U,G) by 25% when compared with nonphosphorylated 40 S ribosomal subunits. In addition, phosphorylation of 40 S ribosomal subunits by the cAMP-dependent protein kinase inhibited translation of poly(A,U,G) by 30% in a reconstituted protein-synthesizing system. Protease-activated kinase II incorporated an average of 2.5 mol of phosphate/mol of 40 S ribosomal subunits which was distributed in equimolar amounts in derivatives of S6 containing one to four phosphates. Phosphorylation of 40 S ribosomal subunits by protease-activated kinase II increased the binding of AUG and poly(A,U,G) by 26 and 42%, respectively. Poly(A,U,G)-directed translation was stimulated 15% over that observed with nonphosphorylated ribosomes and 45% over that observed with ribosomes phosphorylated by the cAMP-dependent protein kinase. Protease-activated kinase I incorporated 1.0 mol of phosphate/mol of 40 S ribosomal subunits into ribosomal protein S10. Phosphorylation of 40 S ribosomal subunits by protease-activated kinase I did not alter the binding of AUG or poly(A,U,G). The effects of phosphorylation of 40 S ribosomal subunits by protease-activated kinase I on protein synthesis could not be examined due to the rapid release of phosphate from S10 in the reconstituted translation system."
https://openalex.org/W1581613728,"Loss of latency due to membrane lipid peroxidation induced in vitro was studied in highly purified rat liver lysosomes. Enriched fractions of lysosomes were isolated by free flow electrophoresis. Lipid peroxidation of lysosomes, assayed as malondialdehyde formation, was catalyzed by a radical generating system consisting of dihydroxyfumaric acid and Fe3+-ADP. The peroxidation reaction occurred readily at 37 degrees C and reached a plateau at 10 min; however, the loss of lysosomal latency, determined as increased percentage free beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase activity, occurred more gradually and reached a maximum after 30 min. Scavengers of superoxide, hydrogen peroxide, singlet oxygen, and hydroxyl radicals did not inhibit the peroxidation reaction nor prevent the loss of lysosomal latency. However, preincubation of the lysosomes with alpha-tocopherol effectively blocked the induction of peroxidation and substantially reduced the loss of lysosomal latency. These results indicate that the lysosomal membrane is susceptible to free radical-induced lipid peroxidation; further, this process may be the immediate cause of the subsequent disintegration of the lysosome. The nature of the protective effect of alpha-tocopherol is unclear but may be due to its interaction with the unsaturated membrane lipids and the subsequent interruption of the chain-reaction initiated by free radicals."
https://openalex.org/W1590844758,"The UV-visible absorption, magnetic circular dichroism (MCD) and CD spectral characteristics of a variety of low spin ferrous P-450-ligand complexes have been carefully determined in order to establish whether all such complexes are hyperporphyrins as previously suggested in the literature. Two general spectral classes are found to occur. Complexes in the first class are, indeed, hyperporphyrin in nature, with pi-acceptor ligands such as CO, NO, phosphine, nitrosoalkanes and isocyanides trans to cysteinate. Individual, but minor, variations in the spectral properties of the hyperporphyrins suggest that subclasses exist, wherein the nature of the trans ligand to thiolate affects the orbital overlap pattern and thus the observed spectra. Adducts in the second spectral class, which have sigma-donor nitrogen and sulfur ligands, also have the red-shifted Soret absorption maximum but are spectrally distinct in all other respects from the hyperporphyrins. Comparison of the MCD spectra of the second category to those of ferrous cytochromes b5, c, and P-420 suggests that the axial cysteinate ligand is still present in the nonhyper ferrous P-450 species. Thus, the combination of a strongly electron-donating cysteinate ligand and a trans sigma-donor, not the orbital mixing mechanism, is most likely the origin of the red-shifted Soret absorption maximum of nonhyper ferrous P-450 ligand complexes. Further, the nature of the total electronic interactions between both axial ligands and the heme iron of ferrous P-450 and not solely the cysteinate ligand determines whether the ligand complexes will be of the hyper or nonhyperporphyrin category. These findings are strengthened by the simultaneous use of three different spectroscopic techniques; together they provide a more detailed explanation for the unusual spectroscopic properties of cytochrome P-450."
https://openalex.org/W1548454840,"Control of gluconeogenesis from lactate was studied by titrating rat liver cells with lactate and pyruvate in a ratio of 10:1 in a perifusion system. At different steady states of glucose formation, the concentration of key gluconeogenic intermediates was measured and plotted against gluconeogenic flux (J glucose). Complete saturation was observed only in the plot relating J glucose to the extracellular pyruvate concentration. Measurement of pyruvate distribution in the cell showed that the mitochondrial pyruvate translocator operates close to equilibrium at high lactate and pyruvate concentrations. It can therefore be concluded that pyruvate carboxylase limits maximal gluconeogenic flux. Addition of glucagon did not cause a shift in the plots relating J glucose to glucose 6-phosphate, dihydroxyacetone phosphate, 3-phosphoglycerate, and phosphoenolpyruvate. It can thus be concluded that glucagon does not affect the kinetic parameters of the enzymes involved in the conversion of phosphoenolpyruvate to glucose. Addition of glucagon led to a shift in the curves relating J glucose to the concentration of cytosolic oxalacetate and extracellular pyruvate. The shift in the curve relating J glucose to oxalacetate is due to glucagon-induced inhibition of pyruvate kinase. The stimulation of gluconeogenesis by glucagon can be accounted for almost completely by inhibition of pyruvate kinase. There was almost no stimulation by glucagon of pyruvate carboxylation. In the absence of glucagon, control on gluconeogenesis from lactate is distributed among different steps including pyruvate carboxylase and pyruvate kinase. Assuming that in the presence of glucagon all pyruvate kinase flux is inhibited, the control of gluconeogenesis in the presence of the hormone is confined exclusively to pyruvate carboxylase."
https://openalex.org/W2002058771,"Auditory and visual space are mapped in the optic tectum of the barn owl. Normally, these maps of space are in close mutual alignment. Ear plugs inserted unilaterally in young barn owls disrupted the binaural cues that constitute the basis of the auditory map. Yet when recordings were made from the tecta of these birds as adults, the auditory and visual maps were in register. When the ear plugs were removed from these adult birds and binaural balance was restored, the auditory maps were shifted substantially relative to the visual maps and relative to the physical borders of the tecta. These results demonstrate that the neural connectivity that gives rise to the auditory map of space in the optic tectum can be modified by experience in such a way that spatial alignment between sensory modalities is maintained."
https://openalex.org/W1516540884,"The regulation of acetylcholine receptor synthesis, assembly, and cell surface expression in response to serum and cell growth in the BC3H1 muscle-like cell line have been examined. In the presence of media containing low concentrations of serum, BC3H1 cells withdraw from the cell cycle and express high levels of cell surface acetylcholine receptors. Exposure of quiescent, differentiated BC3H1 cells to high concentrations of serum results in re-entry of cells into the cell cycle and a loss of surface acetylcholine receptors by a first order process (t1/2 = 8.6 h) which appears to be initiated within 1 h following serum addition. Under these conditions, the rate of synthesis of acetylcholine receptor alpha-subunits is not significantly reduced; however, the efficiency of assembly of alpha-subunits into functional acetylcholine receptors is significantly less than that observed in quiescent cells. The receptors which are assembled following serum stimulation of quiescent cells are not transported to the cell surface, nor do they accumulate within the cells in a functional form (defined by the ability to bind alpha-bungarotoxin) in the cells. We conclude that reinitiation of cell division in quiescent cultures of BC3H1 cells results in alterations in several post-translational processing steps required for the surface expression of acetylcholine receptors."
https://openalex.org/W1565733309,"The hypothesis that clearance of cellular cholesteryl ester deposits may be a function of the physical state of the stored lipid has been investigated. Cultured rat hepatoma cells were induced to store cholesteryl ester in either anisotropic inclusions by exposure to free cholesterol-rich phospholipid dispersions or isotropic inclusions by exposure to identical dispersions supplemented with oleic acid. Differential scanning calorimetry demonstrated an order/disorder transition at 43 degrees C for cholesteryl esters stored in anisotropic inclusions; the enthalpy of this transition was consistent with a smectic liquid crystalline to liquid transition. Lipids in cells with isotropic inclusions displayed no order/disorder transitions over the range 20-80 degrees C, indicating that the lipids are in a liquid state. The presence of oleic acid did not influence the mass of cholesteryl ester stored but increased the amount of stored triglyceride. Fatty acyl compositions of the cholesteryl esters were different under the two loading conditions; in particular, there was 38% cholesteryl oleate in anisotropic inclusions and 65% cholesteryl oleate in isotropic inclusions. Kinetics of cholesteryl ester clearance from cells with either anisotropic or isotropic inclusions were studied during a 12-h exposure to acceptors of free cholesterol. In both cases, cholesteryl ester clearance is essentially linear over 12 h and is directly proportional to the initial content of cholesteryl ester. However, the fraction of initial content of cholesteryl ester cleared in 12 h is 0.17 +/- 0.05 for cells with anisotropic inclusions and 0.34 +/- 0.09 for cells with isotropic inclusions. Our data demonstrate that the more rapid clearance of cholesteryl ester by cells with isotropic inclusions can be correlated with the physical state of the cholesteryl ester."
https://openalex.org/W1610735267,"A cyclic nucleotide-independent protein kinase, protease-activated kinase II, which incorporates up to four phosphates into 40 S ribosomal protein S6, has been purified from the postribosomal supernatant of rabbit reticulocytes. Protease-activated kinase II was purified as an inactive proenzyme by chromatography on DEAE-cellulose, phosphocellulose, Sephadex G-150, and hydroxylapatite. The enzyme was activated in vitro by limited digestion with trypsin or chymotrypsin. No other mode of activation for protease-activated kinase II in vitro was identified. The proenzyme had a molecular weight of 80,000 as measured by gel filtration; following tryptic digestion, the molecular weight of the activated protein kinase was 45,000-55,000. Protease-activated kinase II required Mg2+ for activity but was inhibited by other divalent cations, monovalent cations, and fluoride ion. ATP was the phosphoryl donor in the phosphorylation reaction; GTP had no effect. In vitro, multiple phosphorylation of S6 was observed with some phosphate incorporated into S10. Phosphorylation of S6 by protease-activated kinase II has been shown to be stimulated in serum-starved 3T3-L1 cells by insulin (Perisic, O., and Traugh, J. A. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 9589-9592) and in reticulocytes by altering the pH of the incubation medium (Perisic, O., and Traugh, J. A. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 13998-14002."
https://openalex.org/W1542315735,"Binding of intact plasma fibronectin and its proteolytic fragments to glycosaminoglycans immobilized on agarose beads was systematically compared at different ionic strengths. In low ionic strength buffer, intact fibronectin bound to heparin and high sulfated heparan sulfate, but not to low sulfated heparan sulfate, dermatan sulfate, chondroitin sulfates A and C, or hyaluronic acid. Fractionation of the thermolysin digest of fibronectin on the glycosaminoglycan-Sepharoses at low ionic strength revealed that three groups of fragments, i.e. Mr = 150,000-140,000, 24,000, and 16,000 (150K-140K, 24K, and 16K) fragments, were capable of binding to glycosaminoglycans with different specificities and affinities. The 150K-140K fragments exhibited the same specificities as intact fibronectin, binding only to heparin and high sulfated heparan sulfate. However, the 24K fragment bound not only to these two glycosaminoglycans but also to low sulfated heparan sulfate and other glycosaminoglycans as well. The 16K fragments were also capable of binding to most glycosaminoglycans with lower affinity than the 24K fragment. These results suggest that the binding sites in the 24K and 16K fragments are cryptic in the intact protein, but are exposed after limited proteolysis. The binding of fibronectin and its fragments to glycosaminoglycans is dependent on the ionic strength. At physiologic ionic strength, only heparin-Sepharose could bind intact fibronectin. Similarly, only heparin-Sepharose could bind the 150K-140K and 24K fragments, but not the 16K fragments, at the same ionic condition. Other glycosaminoglycan-Sepharoses did not retain significant amounts of any of the fibronectin fragments, suggesting that the affinity of plasma fibronectin and its fragments to heparan sulfate and other glycosaminoglycans, except heparin, is not strong enough to achieve stable mono- (or di-) valent binding under physiologic conditions."
https://openalex.org/W1539680637,"Nonenzymatic glucosylation of protein is initiated by the reversible condensation of glucose in its open chain form with the amino groups on the protein. The initial product is an aldimine (Schiff base) which cyclizes to the glycosylamine derivative. The aldimine can undergo a slow Amadori rearrangement to yield the relatively stable ketoamine adduct which is structurally analogous to fructose. 13C NMR has been used to characterize these early products of nonenzymatic glucosylation, using RNase A as a model protein. C-1 of the beta-pyranose anomer of the glycosylamine was identified at 88.8 ppm in the spectrum of RNase glucosylated approximately 1:1 with D-[1-13C]glucose. C-1 of the Amadori product was also apparent in this spectrum, resonating as a pair of intense peaks at 52.7 and 53.1 ppm. The anomeric (C-2) resonances of the Amadori adduct were seen in the spectrum of RNase glucosylated approximately 1:1 with [U-13C]glucose. This spectrum was interpreted by comparison to the spectra of reference compounds: D-fructose, fructose-glycine, N alpha-formyl-N epsilon-fructose-lysine, and glucosylated poly-L-lysine. In the protein spectrum, the most intense of the C-2 resonances was that of the beta-fructopyranose anomer at 95.8 ppm. The alpha- and beta-fructofuranose anomers were also observed at 101.7 and 99.2 ppm, respectively. One unidentified signal in the anomeric region was observed in the spectra of poly-L-lysine and RNase, both glucosylated with [U-13C]glucose; no comparable resonances were observed in the spectra of the model compounds."
https://openalex.org/W1531852203,"A single high-affinity binding site for adenine and related compounds was identified in the lima bean lectin (LBL) component III tetramer. This site is identical with the high affinity site for 2,6-toludinyl-naphthalenesulfonate described previously (Roberts, D. D., and Goldstein, I. J. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257, 11274-11277). [14C]Adenine was bound with high affinity (Kd = 1.2 +/- 0.1 X 10(-5) M, T = 25 degrees C) and a high degree of specificity in that hypoxanthine and guanine were very poor ligands for this site. Specificity was also observed for free purine bases relative to nucleosides or nucleotides. A number of N6 derivatives of adenine with cytokinin activity were found to bind to LBL, with relative affinities decreasing in the order: N6 - benzyladenine greater than kinetin greater than zeatin greater than N6 - [delta 2-isopentenyl]adenine greater than dihydrozeatin greater than zeatin riboside. Evidence was also obtained for heterotropic interaction between the adenine binding site and a second class of hydrophobic sites present on each subunit of LBL. Binding of adenine and N6-benzyladenine to LBL was found to produce a 2.3- and 3.8-fold increase, respectively, in the affinity of the lectin subunit hydrophobic sites for 1,8-anilinonaphthalenesulfonate. 1,8-Anilinonaphthalenesulfonate, in turn, enhanced the affinity of LBL for adenine, demonstrating that binding of ligands to the two classes of hydrophobic sites is thermodynamically linked. Equilibrium dialysis also revealed high affinity binding sites for [14C]adenine on the lectins from Dolichos biflorus, Phaseolus vulgaris, and soybean (Glycine max)."

Chem. 256, 6311-6320), has been incubated with tri-, di-, and monooleoyl[3H]glycerol, and the acylglycerol reaction products were isolated by thin layer chromatography on silicic acid, impregnated with boric acid. Trioleoylglycerol was hydrolyzed with the intermediate accumulation of monooleoylglycerol, mainly the 2-isomer, and a small amount of 1,2(2,3)-, but no measurable, 1,3-dioleoylglycerol. 2-Monooleoylglycerol was also the major acylglycerol reaction product from 1,2(2,3)-dioleoylglycerol hydrolysis, which occurred at a Vmax of 60% of that with the 1,3-isomer. Part of the 1(3)-monooleoylglycerols found were formed by acyl migration, but 2-ester bond cleavage was directly demonstrated by the use of 1,3-dioleoyl-2-[14C]oleoyl[3H]glycerol as substrate, and by determination of the 14C/3H ratios of the acylglycerol reaction products. Based on the hydrolysis of specific monooleoylglycerol isomers, it was estimated that the 1(3)-ester bonds of the acylglycerols were hydrolyzed 3- to 4-fold faster than the 2-ester bonds. The main lipolytic reaction sequence catalyzed by hormone-sensitive lipase is thus triacylglycerol leads to 1,2(2,3)-diacylglycerol leads to 2-monoacylglycerol. However, the preference for the 1(3)-ester bonds is less marked than that of, e.g. pancreatic and lipoprotein lipase."
https://openalex.org/W1571457462,"A novel compound, 3-(2'-aminobenzhydryloxy)-tropane (ABT), and an ABT-agarose gel were synthesized and used for the purification of solubilized muscarinic receptors. ABT had a high affinity with an apparent dissociation constant (Kd) of 7 nM for the muscarinic receptors solubilized from the porcine brain by digitonin. An ABT-agarose gel was prepared by coupling ABT with epoxy-activated Sepharose 6B, and the degree of substitution to the gel was determined to be 4-5 mumol/ml of the gel by UV absorption spectrum. During affinity chromatography using 10 ml of the ABT-agarose gel and 100 ml of the digitonin-solubilized preparation, 70% of muscarinic receptors were adsorbed to the gel, in marked contrast with the adsorption of only 2% of proteins. Approximately 25% of muscarinic receptors applied to the gel were eluted biospecifically with 1 mM muscarinic ligands. The purified fraction showed a high affinity for [3H]quinuclidinyl benzylate with a Kd of 0.4 nM and similar specificity for muscarinic ligands to that of unpurified soluble receptors. The protein concentration of the purified fraction was too low to be determined accurately, but very approximately a purification of 10(3)-fold was indicated."
https://openalex.org/W1610977048,"The interactions between purified rat hepatic microsomal cytochrome P-450 and the type I ligands benzphetamine and cytochrome b5 have been studied in the presence of phospholipid using difference spectrophotometry. Cytochrome b5 was shown to interact with cytochrome P-450 to form a tight 1:1 complex (Kd = 275 nM), in which the proportion of high spin cytochrome P-450 was increased from 7 to 30%. The presence of saturating cytochrome b5 was shown to cause a decrease in the apparent Kd for benzphetamine binding from 111 microM to 40 microM. Likewise, the presence of benzphetamine was shown to cause a decrease in the apparent dissociation constant for cytochrome b5 binding to cytochrome P-450 (Kd = 90 nM). The above interactions were resolved into the basic equilibria inter-relating the various ligation states of the hemoprotein in an energetically closed eight-state free energy coupling model and the relative magnitudes of the microequilibria were analyzed to determine the degree of coupling of the interactions between cytochrome P-450 and both benzphetamine and cytochrome b5. Consequently, the spin state changes in cytochrome P-450 induced by benzphetamine and cytochrome b5 binding were shown to arise because these ligands interact 7 and 4 times more tightly with high spin cytochrome P-450, respectively. Furthermore, the data revealed that these ligands interact at independent sites on cytochrome P-450. Thus the effects of cytochrome b5 upon benzphetamine binding and vice versa were rationalized simply in terms of an increase in the proportion of a high spin (high affinity) conformation of cytochrome P-450 brought about by pre-equilibration with the effector ligand, with the intrinsic binding affinities of the two ligands for the low or high spin states remaining relatively unaltered. The thermodynamic parameters associated with the interactions between cytochrome P-450 and cytochrome b5, determined from the temperature dependence of these interactions, revealed that these protein interactions are entropy driven and probably occur by a hydrophobic mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W1538821929,"3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMG-CoA reductase) converts HMG-CoA to mevalonate, a key intermediate in the formation of cholesterol and several nonsterol isoprenoid compounds. Using the bromodeoxyuridine/bisbenzimide photosensitization technique, we isolated a mutant clone of Chinese hamster ovary cells that requires mevalonate for growth. This mutant, designated UT-2 cells, expresses 2-5% of the HMG-CoA reductase activity of parental Chinese hamster ovary cells, even after growth for 9 months in the absence of selective pressure. By immunoblotting, no cross-reactive HMG-CoA reductase protein was detected in UT-2 cells. Incorporation of [14C]acetate and [14C]pyruvate into cholesterol was less than 5% of that in parental Chinese hamster ovary cells. In contrast, [3H]mevalonate incorporation into cholesterol was normal. The activities of acetoacetyl-CoA thiolase and HMG-CoA synthase, the two enzymes that precede HMG-CoA reductase in the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway, were normal or slightly elevated in UT-2 cells. No gross deletions or rearrangements in the gene for HMG-CoA reductase were apparent when DNA from UT-2 cells was digested with restriction endonucleases, subjected to Southern blotting, and probed with a 32P-labeled cDNA for HMG-CoA reductase. We conclude that UT-2 cells have a mutation that specifically prevents the production of normal amounts of HMG-CoA reductase."

C., Stowell, C.P., and Krantz, M. J. (1976) Biochemistry 15, 3956-3963). In this report, the binding (2 degrees C) and initial uptake (37 degrees C) of Mann-AI-BSA (n = 5, 13, 24, and 43) by rabbit alveolar macrophages were examined. Man43-AI-BSA had about 400 times higher affinity (Kd = 2.0 nM) for the macrophage than the Man5-AI-BSA ligand (Kd = 820 nM) at 2 degrees C. Kinetic analysis of 125I-Man43-AI-BSA binding to macrophages at 2 degrees C yielded an association rate constant of 1.2 X 10(6) M-1 min-1 and a dissociation rate constant of 5.9 X 10(-3) min-1 (t1/2 = 117 min). The association rate constant at 37 degrees C was 2 orders of magnitude greater than at 2 degrees C. When the endocytotic process at 37 degrees C was analyzed by Michaelis-Menten-type kinetics, Man5-AI-BSA had a K uptake 20 times higher than that of Man43-AI-BSA (328 and 18 nM, respectively). The maximal uptake velocities at 37 degrees C were, however, very similar for all four Man-AI-BSA derivatives (62,600-83,000 molecules/cell/min). The rate constants for internalization and hydrolysis for 125I-Man43-AI-BSA and 125I-Man13-AI-BSA were determined using a steady state approach. The internalization rate constant for 125I-Man43-AI-BSA, 1.23 (+/- 0.20) min-1, was similar to that constant obtained for 125I-Man13-AI-BSA, 1.80 (+/- 0.67) min-1. The hydrolysis rate constants for the two ligands were also close, 7.4 (+/- 0.2) X 10(-2) and 9.2 (+/- 0.5) X 10(-2) min-1, for 125I-Man43-AI-BSA and 125I-Man13-AI-BSA, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W1551743456,"Abstract Nitrobenzylthioinosine (NBMPR) was employed as a covalent probe of the erythrocyte nucleoside transporter. This nucleoside analogue, a potent inhibitor of nucleoside transport, binds tightly (KD = 10(-10) - 10(-9) M) but reversibly to specific sites on the carrier mechanism. High intensity UV irradiation of intact human erythrocytes, isolated ghosts, and protein-depleted membranes in the presence of [3H]NBMPR and dithiothreitol (as a free radical scavenger) under nonequilibrium and equilibrium binding conditions resulted in selective covalent incorporation of 3H into the band 4.5 region of sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels (Mr = 45,000-65,000). Covalent labeling of band 4.5 protein(s) under equilibrium binding conditions was inhibited by nitrobenzylthioguanosine, dipyridamole, uridine, and adenosine. A similar photolabeling pattern was observed using membranes from pig erythrocytes. In contrast, no incorporation of radioactivity into band 4.5 was observed under equilibrium binding conditions with membranes from nucleoside-impermeable sheep erythrocytes. These experiments suggest that the human and pig erythrocyte nucleoside transporters are band 4.5 polypeptides, a conclusion supported by previous isolation studies based on the assay of reversible [3H]NBMPR binding activity."

https://openalex.org/W1588073441,"Nonpolymerizable tropomyosin, in which 11 residues have been quantitatively cleaved from the COOH terminus of muscle tropomyosin (TM) by enzymic digestion, does not bind to F-actin. Binding is restored in the presence of troponin (Tn) and absence of Ca2+. The binding is stronger than for intact TM alone and shows residual cooperativity. In the presence of Ca2+, the binding is at least 10-fold weaker and cooperativity is not observed. Tn-T alone is more effective than Tn-I alone in inducing nonpolymerizable TM binding. Tn-T plus Tn-I induce binding as effectively as whole Tn (without Ca2+). In the absence of Ca2+, Tn-T + Tn-C and Tn-I + Tn-C are more effective in promoting binding than in the presence of Ca2+. These observations emphasize the importance of the head to tail overlap region of TM in the cooperative interactions of the thin filament assembly. The effects of Ca2+ are largely understandable in terms of its known effects on the strength of interactions between Tn-I and TM + actin and between Tn-T and TM. The residual cooperativity observed in nonpolymerizable TM binding in the presence of Tn (without Ca2+) may indicate that the T1 fragment region (residues 1-158) of Tn-T spans the head to tail overlap gap between the neighboring nonpolymerizable TM molecules. Alternatively, or in addition, the cooperativity may arise from conformational changes transmitted through actin from one nonpolymerizable TM-Tn binding site to others."
https://openalex.org/W1502238007,"Abstract This study reports on the divalent metal ion specificity for phosphorylase kinase autophosphorylation and, in particular, provides a comparison between the efficacy of Mg2+ and Mn2+ in this role. As well as requiring Ca2+ plus divalent metal ion-ATP2- as substrate, both phosphorylase kinase autoactivation and phosphorylase conversion are additionally modulated by divalent cations. However, these reactions are affected differently by different ions. Phosphorylase kinase-catalyzed phosphorylase conversion is maximally enhanced by a 4- to 10-fold lower concentration of Mg2+ than is autocatalysis and, whereas both reactions are stimulated by Mg2+, autophosphorylation is activated by Mn2+, Co2+, and Ni2+ while phosphorylase a formation is inhibited. This difference may be due to an effect of free Mn2+ on phosphorylase rather than the inability of phosphorylase kinase to use MnATP as a substrate when catalyzing phosphorylase conversion since Mn2+, when added at a level which minimally decreases [MgATP], greatly inhibits phosphorylase phosphorylation. The interactions of Mn2+ with phosphorylase kinase are different from those of Mg2+. Not only are the effects of these ions on phosphorylase activation opposite, but they also provoke different patterns of subunit phosphorylation during phosphorylase kinase autocatalysis. With Mn2+, the time lag of phosphorylation of both the alpha and beta subunits of phosphorylase kinase in autocatalysis is diminished in comparison to what is observed with Mg2+, and the beta subunit is only phosphorylated to a maximum of 1 mol/mol of subunit. With both Mg2+ and Mn2+ the alpha subunit is phosphorylated to a level in excess of 3 mol/mol, a level similar to that obtained for beta subunit phosphorylation in the presence of Mg2+. The support of autophosphorylation by both Co2+ and Ni2+ has characteristics similar to those observed with Mn2+. Although Mn2+ stimulation of autophosphorylation occurs at levels much higher than normal physiological levels, the possible potential of phosphorylase kinase autophosphorylation as a control mechanism is illustrated by the 80- to 100-fold activation that occurs in the presence of Mn2+, a level far in excess of the enzyme activity change normally seen with covalent modification. Autophosphorylation of phosphorylase kinase demonstrates a Km for Mg X ATP2- of 27.7 microM and a Ka for Mg2+ of 3.1 mM. The reaction mechanism of autophosphorylation is intramolecular. This latter observation may indicate that phosphorylase kinase autocatalysis could be of potential physiological relevance and could occur with equal facility in cells containing either constitutively high or low levels of this enzyme."

The enzyme incorporated up to four phosphates into S6 as shown by analysis of the phosphorylated derivatives by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. When tryptic digests of S6 phosphorylated by the enzyme were examined by two-dimensional peptide mapping, five phosphopeptides were observed. In contrast, only two phosphopeptides were identified with the cAMP-dependent protein kinase. One phosphopeptide was common to both peptide maps; the others were unique for each enzyme. The physiological significance of the phosphorylation by protease-activated kinase II was verified with phosphopeptide maps of S6 phosphorylated in intact cells. Highly phosphorylated forms of S6 were obtained in rabbit reticulocytes incubated in slightly acidified medium (pH 7.2 to 6.8). The phosphopeptide pattern contained the same five phosphopeptides observed with protease-activated kinase II in vitro indicating the pH-dependent phosphorylation of S6 was mediated by protease-activated kinase II."
https://openalex.org/W1556401633,"Phycocyanin 645 was isolated and purified from the cryptomonad Chroomonas species. Its chromophore content was obtained from absorption spectra in acidic 8.0 M urea for both whole protein and the separated subunits. The principal method used to separate the alpha and beta subunits was gel filtration through a Sephacryl S-200 column in acidic urea. The subunits were shown to be completely separated during this procedure by sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis. Spectra were analyzed by three component Beer's law equations. The whole protein was found to consist of four phycocyanobilins (Amax at 662 nm), two cryptoviolins (Amax at 590 nm), and two unnamed bilins with an Amax at 697 nm. The separated subunits were analyzed, and the beta subunit was shown to have two phycocyanobilins for each cryptoviolin and alpha was composed of the 697-nm bilin exclusively. A comparison of the total amounts of alpha and beta from the Sephacryl columns showed that the molar ratios of phycocyanobilin on beta to the 697-nm bilin on alpha was 2:1, and the ratio of cryptoviolin on beta to 697-nm bilin on alpha was 1:1. We therefore propose that, assuming a symmetrical distribution, each beta subunit on the alpha 2 beta 2 protein has two phycocyanobilins and one cryptoviolin and each alpha subunit has one 697-nm bilin. This chromophore distribution differs from one previously reported in which the subunits were separated on a BioRex 70 cation exchange resin in 12% formic acid via a 4-10 M urea gradient."
https://openalex.org/W1531558980,"Dopamine receptors, solubilized from bovine anterior pituitary membranes with the detergent digitonin, retained a typical dopaminergic specificity for the binding of both agonists and antagonists. The affinities of antagonists for binding to the soluble receptors are virtually identical with those observed with the membrane-bound receptors. The affinities of agonists however, correspond to those for the form of the receptors in the membranes having low affinity for those agonists (De Lean, A., Kilpatrick, B. F., and Caron, M. G. (1982) Mol. Pharmacol. 22, 290-297). Thus, after solubilization, agonist high affinity interactions with the receptor and their sensitivity to modulation by guanine nucleotides are lost. However, high affinity agonist binding and its sensitivity to guanine nucleotides can be preserved if the membrane-bound receptors are prelabeled with the agonist [3H]n-propylapomorphine prior to solubilization. In order to investigate the molecular basis for these changes in the properties of agonist binding, the solubilized receptors were characterized by chromatographic procedures. Using molecular exclusion high pressure liquid chromatography, [3H]n-propylapomorphine-prelabeled receptors elute as an apparent larger molecular species than either unlabeled or antagonist [( 3H]spiroperidol)-pre-labeled receptors. Moreover, incubation of the pooled agonist-prelabeled receptor peak with guanine nucleotides effects a decrease in the apparent size of the receptors such that upon rechromatography they elute in a position coincidental with the 3H-antagonist-pre-labeled receptor peak. Thus, occupancy of the receptors by agonists promotes the formation of a guanine nucleotide-sensitive agonist high affinity form of the receptor which is of larger apparent size presumably due to the association of the receptor with a guanine nucleotide regulatory protein."

https://openalex.org/W1580226344,"We have examined the dilution-induced in vitro disassembly kinetics of bovine brain microtubules, initially at steady state, using a wider range of dilutions (2-100-fold) than previously employed. In contrast to earlier results, as well as to the simple nucleation-condensation model for microtubule formation, the initial rate of dimer loss from microtubule ends was not a linear function of the initial concentration of unpolymerized tubulin. Over a 2-20-fold dilution range, plots of the initial rate of dimer loss versus the initial unpolymerized tubulin concentration were approximately linear. However, at greater dilutions, rates of microtubule depolymerization increased nonlinearly. For example, between a 10-fold dilution and a 100-fold dilution, the initial rate of dimer loss for microtubule-associated protein-containing microtubules increased by 300%, rather than a maximum of 11% expected on the basis of a linear rate plot. The nonlinear response was observed for dimer loss from opposite microtubule ends separately and with microtubules containing and lacking associated proteins. Qualitatively similar results were obtained using a wide range of experimental protocols, from which we can reasonably exclude methodological artifact as a basis for the data. We can also reasonably exclude the dissociation of the high molecular weight microtubule-associated proteins 1 and 2 from the microtubules as an explanation for the nonlinearity of the rate plots. The nonlinearity of the rate plots indicates that kinetic constants obtained under nonsteady state conditions of extreme microtubule dilution may not describe the steady state condition accurately."
https://openalex.org/W1550047210,"The gamma-glutamyl carboxylation reaction proceeds by an initial vitamin K-dependent gamma-C-H glutamyl bond cleavage and a subsequent carboxylation of the activated glutamyl residue. This system is easily uncoupled such that at low CO2 concentrations which limit the extent of carboxylation there is no effect on the rate of C-H bond cleavage. In an uncoupled system, the fate of activated glutamyl residues is to incorporate a hydrogen as demonstrated by the recovery of only unaltered glutamyl residues from digests of uncoupled reactions. In addition, in reactions carried out in tritiated, deuterated water mixtures, tritium is incorporated into the gamma positions of the glutamyl residues of peptide substrates in a vitamin K-dependent process, indicating that the hydrogen incorporated must ultimately come from solvent. These results, while not proof, put severe restraints on a radical mechanism while favoring a carbanion mechanism."

In this paper, we have studied the oxidative metabolism of corticosterone to acidic end products in intact mice. A significant fraction of radioactivity from intraperitoneal injections of [4-14C]corticosterone appeared in liver and intestine within 5 min. The major steroid in liver at 5 min postinjection was found to be corticosterone, although acidic metabolites were detected. Within 30 min after injection, 11 beta, 20 alpha-dihydroxy-3-oxo-preg-4-en-21-oic acid became the dominant steroid. At 60 min, it was the major steroid isolated from liver or intestine. Several other acid metabolites were present in lesser amounts in both organs. About half of the remaining radioactive metabolites in liver and intestine were steroid acids, as determined by their reaction with diazomethane. The identification of the major steroid acid as 11 beta, 20 alpha-dihydroxy-3-oxo-pregn-4-en-21-oic acid was made by comparing the chromatographic behavior of the free acid and its methyl ester with that of authentic synthetic acid using thin layer and high performance liquid chromatography. Identity was confirmed by showing that the specific activities of the homogeneous 14C-labeled free acid remained unchanged when reanalyzed as the 21-methyl ester."

The radioimmunoassay method measured tissue enzyme concentration (nanomoles/g) and total organ enzyme content (nanomoles/liver) independently of assayable activity (units/g). The specific activity (units/nmol) was calculated from the maximum velocity and enzyme concentration data. Extracts of rat liver mitochondria and of skeletal muscle cytosol were also analyzed for P-enolpyruvate carboxykinase by the radioimmunoassay. In chemical diabetes, P-enolpyruvate carboxykinase by the radioimmunoassay. In chemical diabetes, P-enolpyruvate carboxykinase concentration increased approximately 3-fold over the fed, normal liver value of 0.89 microM, approximately 1.6-fold over the normal kidney value of 1.9 microM and approximately 2.9-fold over the normal adipose tissue value of 0.030 microM. Chemical diabetes caused the specific activity to decrease from 0.38 to approximately 0.27 units/nmol in liver and from 0.48 to approximately 0.32 units/nmol in kidney. Insulin replacement by in vivo injection not only promptly lowered the abnormally high enzyme concentration in both tissues but, paradoxically, decreased the apparent specific activities further to approximately 0.16 in liver and to 0.23 in kidney. In the db+/db+ diabetic mouse the liver enzyme increased from 0.22 microM at 5 weeks of age to 0.44 microM at 18 weeks when serum glucagon concentration is known to be highest and the pancreatic beta cells to be depleted of insulin. While the enzyme protein concentration increased 2-fold in the 18-week-old db+/db+ mouse, total liver enzyme content had actually increased 5-fold due to liver enlargement. In fasted normal mice, glucagon-treated normal mice, and alloxan/streptozotocin-treated mice, the concentration of liver enzyme increased significantly compared to the values in fed control mice. Pharmacological doses of dexamethasone did not induce the mouse enzyme. Rat liver mitochondria contained only trace quantities of immunoassayable enzyme which can be explained by contamination with cytosolic proteins. Rat skeletal muscle also contained only insignificant quantities of the enzyme or perhaps another cross-reacting, immunoassayable protein. The data obtained in diabetes before and after treatment show that complex mechanisms of control by insulin and glucagon do operate to regulate P-enolpyruvate carboxykinase in liver, kidney, and adipose tissue."

The intermediate form of antithrombin III, termed AT-IIIR, which has lost the structural features of the first domain was investigated. Clotting assays and electrophoretic analyses showed that AT-IIIR had lost 60% of heparin cofactor activity but was still capable of forming sodium dodecyl sulfate-stable complexes with thrombin. Although certain regions of this molecule do not refold to the conformation of native antithrombin III, the tryptophan residues refold to a conformation identical with the native state. This was demonstrated by fluorescence quenching, solvent perturbation, and chemical modification studies. However, the tryptophan-ascribed fluorescence enhancement and absorption difference spectrum which occur when heparin binds to antithrombin III are reduced by 70%. On the basis of these data, the binding of heparin to antithrombin III is interpreted in terms of a two-step mechanism. The primary binding occurs in the region without tryptophan and is followed by a secondary conformational rearrangement which affects the tryptophan environment. The mechanism of the binding of heparin and antithrombin III has been previously studied by kinetic methods, and the data also support a two-step mechanism. The agreement of these two studies employing entirely different approaches to the same problem lends support to the validity of this postulated mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W1562765542,"Cell-specific variations in apoferritin structure correlate with variations in iron metabolism that suggest functional specificity of the protein shell. Using EPR spectroscopy, we previously showed that vanadyl binds to specific sites on apoferritin, and that VO2+ binding is reduced by Fe(II) and Fe(III) (the natural substrates) and by metals known to influence iron storage (Chasteen, N. D., and Theil, E. C. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257, 7672-7677). Such observations suggest that the metal-binding site is important to apoferritin function and may define a location where the influence of cell-specific structural features are exerted. To investigate the iron-protein complex further, we have used x-ray absorption spectroscopy and have characterized, for the first time to our knowledge, Fe(III) apparently attached to the protein, after analyzing the x-ray absorption spectrum of an Fe(III)-apoferritin complex (10 Fe/molecule) compared to that of ferritin (polynuclear Fe(III)OOH, about 2000/molecule). The environment of iron in the Fe(III)-protein complex was similar to that in an Fe(III)-oxalate (2:3) hexahydrate complex, both in near edge structure and extended x-ray absorption structure, confirming earlier predictions of carboxylates as protein ligands. The extended x-ray absorption fine structure data for both compounds was fit best by a model in which a second shell of low Z atoms (carbon) was close (0.53-0.55 A) to the first shell of coordinated oxygen. However, small differences between Fe(III)-apoferritin and Fe(III)-oxalate in the Fe-O environment suggest a distorted geometry in the Fe(III)-protein complex and/or the presence of a mixture of atoms, such as nitrogen and oxygen, coordinated to iron. Extension of this approach to other apoferritins and metals will be likely to clarify the role of cell-specific features of the apoprotein in the formation of the iron core."
https://openalex.org/W1487019833,"[3H]Spiroperidol was used to label uterine membrane-binding sites that have the characteristics expected of serotonergic receptors. The characteristics of specific [3H]spiroperidol binding to the uterine membrane of 17 beta-estradiol-3-benzoate-treated ovariectomized rats were studied. The specific [3H]spiroperidol binding was rapid and reversible, and the half-maximal saturation, taken as the apparent dissociation constant (KD) for [3H]spiroperidol, was 5.16 +/- 0.24 (n = 12) nM [3H]spiroperidol. Scatchard plots of saturation curves of the specific [3H]spiroperidol binding were convex and the Hill coefficient was 2.06 +/- 0.11 (n = 12). Cinanserin, mianserin, metergoline (which are serotonergic antagonists), and serotonin (5-HT) inhibited the [3H]spiroperidol binding with apparent Ki values of 21.2, 14.1, 14.1, and 176.5 microM, respectively. Concentrations of 1 mM sulpiride (a dopaminergic antagonist) and dopamine reduced [3H]spiroperidol binding only 26 and 23%, respectively. 1 mM GTP reduced the potency of 5-HT (10(-6) - 10(-3) M) to displace bound [3H]spiroperidol. The uterine membranes were treated with various enzymes and protein-modifying reagents, and binding studies on the treated uterine membranes showed that protein(s), phospholipids, and N-acetyl-neuraminic acid in uterine membranes were important as specific binding sites of [3H]spiroperidol. Measurement of the specific binding of [3H]spiroperidol to uterine membranes from untreated and estradiol-treated ovariectomized rats showed that estradiol significantly increased the number of specific binding sites of [3H]spiroperidol, but did not change the apparent affinity of specific [3H]spiroperidol binding. Estradiol also did not change the dissociation constant or the number of binding sites for [3H]3-quinuclidinyl benzilate, which binds to muscarinic acetylcholine receptors. These findings suggest that [3H]spiroperidol mainly binds to 5-HT receptors in the uterine membrane of estradiol-treated ovariectomized rats. The finding that administration of estradiol significantly increased the number of [3H]spiroperidol-binding sites is consistent with the specific increase in the contractile response to 5-HT observed in isolated uterus from ovariectomized rats treated with estradiol."
https://openalex.org/W1536010954,"The effect of apolipoprotein C-II (apoC-II) on the bovine milk lipoprotein lipase (LpL)-catalyzed hydrolysis of a homologous series of saturated phosphatidylcholines was examined with respect to the fatty acyl chain length of the substrates. Dilauryl-, dimyristoyl-, dipalmitoyl-, and distearoylphosphatidylcholine solubilized by Triton X-100 and sonicated vesicles of dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine were used as substrates. The maximal rate of the LpL-catalyzed hydrolysis of each of these lipids was determined in the absence and presence of apoC-II. The activation factor (the ratio of enzyme activity with apoC-II to that without the activator protein) increased with increasing mol ratios of apoC-II to LpL and was maximal at a ratio of approximately 50. At all apoC-II/LpL mole ratios tested, the activation factor increased as a function of fatty acyl chain length. A quantitative relationship between fatty acyl chain length and the extent of maximal activation of LpL by apoC-II was observed: the logarithm of the activation factor is a linear function of the number of carbon atoms of a single fatty acyl chain of the substrates."
https://openalex.org/W1608530464,"Abstract A new Ca2+-binding protein, different from calmodulin, has been detected in the cilium and cell body of Tetrahymena. This protein, designated as TCBP-10, has been purified from the cells to homogeneity. TCBP-10 is an acidic protein (pI = 4.5) which shows a Ca2+-dependent mobility shift in alkali-glycerol-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The protein is resistant to heat and trichloroacetic acid. The molecular weight of the protein is 10,000 by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and 22,000 by Sephadex G-50 gel filtration, suggesting that the native form of the protein is a dimer. The protein has a molar extinction coefficient of 6,500 at 282 nm. Equilibrium dialysis experiments revealed that the protein binds 1 mol of Ca2+/mol of protein with a dissociation constant of 27 microM. The protein contains a relatively large quantity of acidic amino acids, single residues of cysteine, histidine, and tryptophan, and no methionine. These properties are similar to those of some low molecular weight Ca2+-binding proteins belonging to the calmodulin family. Thus, the cilium of Tetrahymena contains a second Ca2+-binding protein in addition to calmodulin. We consider that TCBP-10 and calmodulin may play important cooperative roles in the Ca2+-regulation of ciliary movement in Tetrahymena."
https://openalex.org/W1657716196,"The reactivity of the amino groups of hemoglobin A toward reductive hydroxyethylation with glycolaldehyde in the presence of NaCNBH3 has been investigated. The alpha-amino groups of the alpha- and beta-chains of hemoglobin A are the most reactive amino groups of the protein for reductive hydroxyethylation; both sites are about equally reactive. Similarly, on reaction of hemoglobin A with glyceraldehyde in the presence of NaCNBH3, the alpha-amino groups of both the alpha- and beta-chains of the protein undergo selective reductive dihydroxypropylation. Modification of the alpha-amino groups of hemoglobin A either by reductive hydroxyethylation or reductive dihydroxypropylation apparently lowers the pKa of the alpha-amino groups and results in an early elution of the modified protein from CM52 chromatography compared with that of the unmodified protein as well as protein modified at the epsilon-amino groups. By hybridization of the modified chains with unmodified chains, new derivatives of hemoglobin with dihydroxypropyl or hydroxyethyl moieties on Val-1 (alpha) or Val-1(beta) of the protein have been prepared for the functional studies. Modification of the alpha-amino group of Val-1(alpha) by reductive hydroxyethylation or by reductive dihydroxypropylation resulted in an increased oxygen affinity of hemoglobin A, whereas the same modification of the alpha-amino group of the beta-chain resulted in a slight decrease in the oxygen affinity. The Hill coefficient of all four derivatives was 2.7, nearly the same as that of the native protein, showing normal heme-heme interactions in these derivatives. Both 2,3-diphosphoglycerate and chloride modulate the oxygen affinity of these hybrids; the influence of 2,3-diphosphoglycerate on decreasing the oxygen affinity of the hybrids with alkyl groups at Val-1(beta) is relatively less than that of the native molecule. On the other hand, when the modification was on Val-1(alpha), the relative decrease in oxygen affinity of the hybrids upon binding of 2,3-diphosphoglycerate was of the same order as with the native protein. The chloride ion-mediated relative decrease in the oxygen affinity of the hybrids with alkyl groups at Val-1(beta) was nearly the same as that seen with the Val-1(alpha) hybrids, and lower than that with the native molecule. The relative influence of hydroxyethylation or of dihydroxypropylation at a given site was nearly the same, suggesting that the size of the alkyl chain has little to do with the observed changes in the oxygen affinity. The influence of reductive alkylation of the alpha-amino groups with these two hydroxyaldehydes probably reflects the change (decrease) in the pKa of the reductively hydroxyethylated or dihydroxypropylated alpha-amino group as compared with that of the unmodified alpha-amino groups."
https://openalex.org/W1517218330,"Abstract Cytochrome o, a protoheme IX pigment, has been proposed as the terminal oxidase of the filamentous bacterium, Vitreoscilla. Aerobic and anaerobic photolysis of CO-liganded whole cells demonstrated the presence of a second CO-reactive pigment, cytochrome o'. At temperatures lower than -100 degrees C, anaerobic photolysis dissociated only about 25% of the total CO-liganded components to reveal the unliganded cytochrome o'. At these temperatures, the photolysis of cytochrome o could not be demonstrated. At warmer temperatures, recombination of CO with the reduced cytochrome o' occurred with an apparent energy of activation of 5.8 kcal/mol. Aerobic photolysis of whole cells demonstrated two oxygen-bound intermediates. At temperatures lower than -95 degrees C, a spectrally distinct compound with absorption maxima at 428, 534, and 564 nm appeared (form I'); the apparent second order rate constant (k+1) for the formation of this intermediate was found to be 9.1 M-1 s-1, the reverse rate (k-1) was 9.9 X 10(-5) s-1, and the equilibrium constant (Kd) was 1.1 X 10(-5) M. This oxygen intermediate of cytochrome o' is spectrally and kinetically similar to the oxygen intermediate of cytochrome o seen in Escherichia coli. At temperatures warmer than -90 degrees C, photolysis of aerobic samples resulted in the immediate formation of a second oxygen-bound intermediate (form I) with absorption maxima at 422, 534, and 564 nm. This second intermediate results from the binding of oxygen to the cytochrome o (oxygenated cytochrome o). These data support the proposal that whole cells of Vitreoscilla contain two alternative pathways of electron transport, one terminating with cytochrome o and the other with cytochrome o'."
https://openalex.org/W1561470125,"Bovine nasal cartilage was repeatedly extracted with the dissociative solvent, 4 M guanidinium chloride. About 25% of the total tissue proteoglycans could not be solubilized as judged by galactosamine analysis. The inextractable proteoglycan could be at least partially solubilized by treating the guanidine-extracted tissue with reagents which completely or partially degraded the proteoglycan protein core. Digestion with papain or cyanogen bromide completely solubilized the tissue and released all of the galactosamine-containing material while trypsin or hydroxylamine treatment left the cartilage macroscopically unchanged and extracted about 50% of the residual galactosamine. The degradatively solubilized material was compared to that extracted with guanidinium chloride. The papain-released glycosaminoglycan chains from the two proteoglycan preparations were similar with respect to size, degree of sulfation, position of sulfation, and hexosamine content. Furthermore, the fragments released from the cartilage residue by either cyanogen bromide, trypsin, or hydroxylamine treatment were of the same size, as judged by gel chromatography, as those derived from similarly digested guanidine-extracted proteoglycan. Trypsin digestion also released the keratan sulfate-enriched peptide as well as peptides from the hyaluronic acid-binding region. By the methods used, the inextractable proteoglycan appears to be similar to the fraction which is readily soluble under dissociative conditions and thus may be held tightly within the tissue by a nonspecific mechanism(s) such as entanglement in the collagen fibril network."
