Douglas et al. (p. 831 ) used this strategy to design DNA origami “nanorobots”—complex shaped structures created by manipulating a long DNA strand through binding with shorter “staple” strands—that could deliver payloads such as gold nanoparticles or fluorescently labeled antibody fragments. These nanorobots were designed to open in response to specific cell-surface proteins, releasing molecules that triggered cell signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2143602768,"Defective Gene Detective Identifying genes that give rise to diseases is one of the major goals of sequencing human genomes. However, putative loss-of-function genes, which are often some of the first identified targets of genome and exome sequencing, have often turned out to be sequencing errors rather than true genetic variants. In order to identify the true scope of loss-of-function genes within the human genome, MacArthur et al. (p. 823 ; see the Perspective by Quintana-Murci ) extensively validated the genomes from the 1000 Genomes Project, as well as an additional European individual, and found that the average person has about 100 true loss-of-function alleles of which approximately 20 have two copies within an individual. Because many known disease-causing genes were identified in “normal” individuals, the process of clinical sequencing needs to reassess how to identify likely causative alleles."

Thus, if biomass were to replace petroleum as society's carbon feedstock, a means of deriving ethylene and propylene—the principal building blocks of today's commodity plastics— would be helpful. Well-known Fischer-Tropsch (FT) catalysts can transform gasified biomass into a range of hydrocarbon derivatives, but ethylene and propylene tend to constitute a small fraction of the overall product distribution. Torres Galvis et al. (p. 835 ) now demonstrate a class of iron catalysts on relatively passive supports (carbon nanofibers or α-alumina) that robustly directed the FT process toward light olefins."

https://openalex.org/W2113381731,"Naomi Wray, Peter Visscher and colleagues report analyses of the common variation that contributes to schizophrenia risk within three independent case-control datasets from the Psychiatric GWAS Consortium for schizophrenia. They estimate that 23% of the variation in liability to schizophrenia is captured by SNPs on current platforms. Schizophrenia is a complex disorder caused by both genetic and environmental factors. Using 9,087 affected individuals, 12,171 controls and 915,354 imputed SNPs from the Schizophrenia Psychiatric Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS) Consortium (PGC-SCZ), we estimate that 23% (s.e. = 1%) of variation in liability to schizophrenia is captured by SNPs. We show that a substantial proportion of this variation must be the result of common causal variants, that the variance explained by each chromosome is linearly related to its length (r = 0.89, P = 2.6 × 10−8), that the genetic basis of schizophrenia is the same in males and females, and that a disproportionate proportion of variation is attributable to a set of 2,725 genes expressed in the central nervous system (CNS; P = 7.6 × 10−8). These results are consistent with a polygenic genetic architecture and imply more individual SNP associations will be detected for this disease as sample size increases."

In their analysis of the genome of C. paradoxa , Price et al. (p. 843 ; see the Perspective by Spiegel ) demonstrate a unique origin for the plastid in the ancestor of this supergroup, which retains much of the ancestral diversity in genes involved in carbohydrate metabolism and fermentation, as well as in the gene content of the mitochondrial genome. Moreover, about 3.3% of nuclear genes in C. paradoxa seem to carry a signal of cyanobacterial ancestry, and key genes involved in starch biosynthesis are derived from energy parasites such as Chlamydiae. Rapid radiation, reticulate evolution via horizontal gene transfer, high rates of gene divergence, loss, and replacement, may have diffused the evolutionary signals within this supergroup, which perhaps explains previous difficulties in resolving its evolutionary history."

https://openalex.org/W2056085420,"Considerable data support the idea that forkhead box O1 (Foxo1) drives the liver transcriptional program during fasting and is then inhibited by thymoma viral proto-oncogene 1 (Akt) after feeding. Here we show that mice with hepatic deletion of Akt1 and Akt2 were glucose intolerant, insulin resistant and defective in their transcriptional response to feeding in the liver. These defects were normalized with concomitant liver-specific deletion of Foxo1. Notably, in the absence of both Akt and Foxo1, mice adapted appropriately to both the fasted and fed state, and insulin suppressed hepatic glucose production normally. A gene expression analysis revealed that deletion of Akt in liver led to the constitutive activation of Foxo1-dependent gene expression, but again, concomitant ablation of Foxo1 restored postprandial regulation, preventing the inhibition of the metabolic response to nutrient intake caused by deletion of Akt. These results are inconsistent with the canonical model of hepatic metabolism in which Akt is an obligate intermediate for proper insulin signaling. Rather, they show that a major role of hepatic Akt is to restrain the activity of Foxo1 and that in the absence of Foxo1, Akt is largely dispensable for insulin- and nutrient-mediated hepatic metabolic regulation in vivo."

Remarkably, the genetic programs that control these two distinct stem cell fates remain poorly understood. We report that Lin28b is specifically expressed in mouse and human fetal liver and thymus, but not in adult bone marrow or thymus. We demonstrate that ectopic expression of Lin28 reprograms hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) from adult bone marrow, which endows them with the ability to mediate multilineage reconstitution that resembles fetal lymphopoiesis, including increased development of B-1a, marginal zone B, gamma/delta (γδ) T cells, and natural killer T (NKT) cells."

Although multiple genetic loci associated with body mass index, the most common measure of obesity, have been identified in European populations, few studies have focused on Asian populations. Here we report a genome-wide association study and replication studies with 62,245 east Asian subjects, which identified two new body mass index-associated loci in the CDKAL1 locus at 6p22 (rs2206734, P = 1.4 × 10(-11)) and the KLF9 locus at 9q21 (rs11142387, P = 1.3 × 10(-9)), as well as several previously reported loci (the SEC16B, BDNF, FTO, MC4R and GIPR loci, P < 5.0 × 10(-8)). We subsequently performed gene-gene interaction analyses and identified an interaction (P = 2.0 × 10(-8)) between a SNP in the KLF9 locus (rs11142387) and one in the MSTN (also known as GDF8) locus at 2q32 (rs13034723).

https://openalex.org/W2039888453,"We present direct evidence of an activator-inhibitor system in the generation of the regularly spaced transverse ridges of the palate. We show that new ridges, called rugae, that are marked by stripes of expression of Shh (encoding Sonic hedgehog), appear at two growth zones where the space between previously laid rugae increases. However, inter-rugal growth is not absolutely required: new stripes of Shh expression still appeared when growth was inhibited. Furthermore, when a ruga was excised, new Shh expression appeared not at the cut edge but as bifurcating stripes branching from the neighboring stripe of Shh expression, diagnostic of a Turing-type reaction-diffusion mechanism. Genetic and inhibitor experiments identified fibroblast growth factor (FGF) and Shh as components of an activator-inhibitor pair in this system. These findings demonstrate a reaction-diffusion mechanism that is likely to be widely relevant in vertebrate development."
https://openalex.org/W2061431160,"Earth's Sluggish Past Based on their affinity for iron or silicon, some elements partition into different compartments of Earth's interior. In the early stages of the formation of the solar system, when Earth was rapidly accreting and differentiating to form a core and mantle, elements such as tungsten and hafnium went along for the ride. By studying the signatures of these elements and their isotopes in ancient volcanic rocks from the mantle, Touboul et al. (p. 1065 , published online 16 February; see the Perspective by Bennett ) reveal that there was a long-lived 182 W reservoir that formed deep within Earth during the first 30 million years of the solar system. Because the reservoir persisted for over 1.7 billion years, it appears the mantle was poorly mixed and indeed it was so sluggish that it did not even homogenize during the massive collision that formed the Moon."
https://openalex.org/W2079637091,"Many pollinator populations are declining, with large economic and ecological implications. Parasites are known to be an important factor in the some of the population declines of honey bees and bumblebees, but little is known about the parasites afflicting most other pollinators, or the extent of interspecific transmission or vectoring of parasites. Here we carry out a preliminary screening of pollinators (honey bees, five species of bumblebee, three species of wasp, four species of hoverfly and three genera of other bees) in the UK for parasites. We used molecular methods to screen for six honey bee viruses, Ascosphaera fungi, Microsporidia, and Wolbachia intracellular bacteria. We aimed simply to detect the presence of the parasites, encompassing vectoring as well as actual infections. Many pollinators of all types were positive for Ascosphaera fungi, while Microsporidia were rarer, being most frequently found in bumblebees. We also detected that most pollinators were positive for Wolbachia, most probably indicating infection with this intracellular symbiont, and raising the possibility that it may be an important factor in influencing host sex ratios or fitness in a diversity of pollinators. Importantly, we found that about a third of bumblebees (Bombus pascuorum and Bombus terrestris) and a third of wasps (Vespula vulgaris), as well as all honey bees, were positive for deformed wing virus, but that this virus was not present in other pollinators. Deformed wing virus therefore does not appear to be a general parasite of pollinators, but does interact significantly with at least three species of bumblebee and wasp. Further work is needed to establish the identity of some of the parasites, their spatiotemporal variation, and whether they are infecting the various pollinator species or being vectored. However, these results provide a first insight into the diversity, and potential exchange, of parasites in pollinator communities."

Robert Siliciano and his colleagues present a quantitative basis for determining efficacious antiretroviral drug combinations. Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART)1,2,3 has dramatically decreased mortality from HIV-1 infection4 and is a major achievement of modern medicine. However, there is no fundamental theory of HAART. Elegant models describe the dynamics of viral replication3,5,6,7,8,9, but a metric for the antiviral activity of drug combinations relative to a target value needed for control of replication is lacking. Treatment guidelines10,11 are based on empirical results of clinical trials in which other factors such as regimen tolerability also affect outcome. Why only certain drug combinations control viral replication remains unclear. Here we quantify the intrinsic antiviral activity of antiretroviral drug combinations. We show that most single antiretroviral drugs show previously unappreciated complex nonlinear pharmacodynamics that determine their inhibitory potential at clinical concentrations. We demonstrate that neither of the major theories for drug combinations accurately predicts the combined effects of multiple antiretrovirals. However, the combined effects can be understood with a new approach that considers the degree of independence of drug effects. This analysis allows a direct comparison of the inhibitory potential of different drug combinations under clinical concentrations, reconciles the results of clinical trials, defines a target level of inhibition associated with treatment success and provides a rational basis for treatment simplification and optimization."
https://openalex.org/W2068417268,"Limited neural input results in muscle weakness in neuromuscular disease because of a reduction in the density of muscle innervation, the rate of neuromuscular junction activation or the efficiency of synaptic transmission. We developed a small-molecule fast-skeletal-troponin activator, CK-2017357, as a means to increase muscle strength by amplifying the response of muscle when neural input is otherwise diminished secondary to neuromuscular disease. Binding selectively to the fast-skeletal-troponin complex, CK-2017357 slows the rate of calcium release from troponin C and sensitizes muscle to calcium. As a consequence, the force-calcium relationship of muscle fibers shifts leftwards, as does the force-frequency relationship of a nerve-muscle pair, so that CK-2017357 increases the production of muscle force in situ at sub-maximal nerve stimulation rates. Notably, we show that sensitization of the fast-skeletal-troponin complex to calcium improves muscle force and grip strength immediately after administration of single doses of CK-2017357 in a model of the neuromuscular disease myasthenia gravis. Troponin activation may provide a new therapeutic approach to improve physical activity in diseases where neuromuscular function is compromised."

While the target site preferences of some engineered transposable elements are well studied, the natural target preferences of most transposable elements are poorly characterized. Using population genomic resequencing data from 166 strains of Drosophila melanogaster, we identified over 8,000 new insertion sites not present in the reference genome sequence that we used to decode the natural target preferences of 22 families of transposable element in this species. We found that terminal inverted repeat transposon and long terminal repeat retrotransposon families present clade-specific target site duplications and target site sequence motifs. Additionally, we found that the sequence motifs at transposable element target sites are always palindromes that extend beyond the target site duplication. Our results demonstrate the utility of population genomics data for high-throughput inference of transposable element targeting preferences in the wild and establish general rules for terminal inverted repeat transposon and long terminal repeat retrotransposon target site selection in eukaryotic genomes."

In the vicinity of a quantum phase transition, a critical region forms where physical observables obey scaling laws as a consequence of the self-similarity of the system. Quantum phase transitions and quantum criticality are usually observed in solid state, but Zhang et al.

Determination of the time, position, and mode of fusion, aided by trypan blue quenching of Qdot fluorescence, revealed that vesicles starting close to their ultimate fusion sites tended to fuse earlier than those positioned farther away. The mode of fusion depended on the prior motion of vesicles, with long-dwelling vesicles preferring kiss-and-run rather than full-collapse fusion. Kiss-and-run fusion events were concentrated near the center of the synapse, whereas full-collapse fusion events were broadly spread."

The model identifies regions where mantle drag drives plate motion and regions where the drag resists plate motion.

https://openalex.org/W2133496177,"Clinical management of chronic neuropathic pain is limited by marginal effectiveness and unacceptable side effects of current drugs. We demonstrate A(3) adenosine receptor (A(3)AR) agonism as a new target-based therapeutic strategy. The development of mechanoallodynia in a well-characterized mouse model of neuropathic pain following chronic constriction injury of the sciatic nerve was rapidly and dose-dependently reversed by the A(3)AR agonists: IB-MECA, its 2-chlorinated analog (Cl-IB-MECA), and the structurally distinct MRS1898. These effects were naloxone insensitive and thus are not opioid receptor mediated. IB-MECA was ≥1.6-fold more efficacious than morphine and >5-fold more potent. In addition, IB-MECA was equally efficacious as gabapentin (Neurontin) or amitriptyline, but respectively >350- and >75-fold more potent. Besides its potent standalone ability to reverse established mechanoallodynia, IB-MECA significantly increased the antiallodynic effects of all 3 analgesics. Moreover, neuropathic pain development in rats caused by widely used chemotherapeutics in the taxane (paclitaxel), platinum-complex (oxaliplatin), and proteasome-inhibitor (bortezomib) classes was blocked by IB-MECA without antagonizing their antitumor effect. A(3)AR agonist effects were blocked with A(3)AR antagonist MRS1523, but not with A(1)AR (DPCPX) or A(2A)AR (SCH-442416) antagonists. Our findings provide the scientific rationale and pharmacological basis for therapeutic development of A(3)AR agonists for chronic pain."
https://openalex.org/W1997337705,"Endoglin, a type I membrane glycoprotein expressed as a disulfide-linked homodimer on human vascular endothelial cells, is a component of the transforming growth factor (TGF)-β receptor complex and is implicated in a dominant vascular dysplasia known as hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia as well as in preeclampsia. It interacts with the type I TGF-β signaling receptor activin receptor-like kinase (ALK)1 and modulates cellular responses to Bone Morphogenetic Protein (BMP)-9 and BMP-10. Structurally, besides carrying a zona pellucida (ZP) domain, endoglin contains at its N-terminal extracellular region a domain of unknown function and without homology to any other known protein, therefore called the orphan domain (OD). In this study, we have determined the recognition and binding ability of full length ALK1, endoglin and constructs encompassing the OD to BMP-9 using combined methods, consisting of surface plasmon resonance and cellular assays. ALK1 and endoglin ectodomains bind, independently of their glycosylation state and without cooperativity, to different sites of BMP-9. The OD comprising residues 22 to 337 was identified among the present constructs as the minimal active endoglin domain needed for partner recognition. These studies also pinpointed to Cys350 as being responsible for the dimerization of endoglin. In contrast to the complete endoglin ectodomain, the OD is a monomer and its small angle X-ray scattering characterization revealed a compact conformation in solution into which a de novo model was fitted."

Participants were 125 adults with OA of the knee, randomized to one of four 8-week regimens of a standardized Swedish massage regimen (30 or 60 min weekly or biweekly) or to a Usual Care control. Outcomes included the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index (WOMAC), visual analog pain scale, range of motion, and time to walk 50 feet, assessed at baseline, 8-, 16-, and 24-weeks.WOMAC Global scores improved significantly (24.0 points, 95% CI ranged from 15.3-32.7) in the 60-minute massage groups compared to Usual Care (6.3 points, 95% CI 0.1-12.8) at the primary endpoint of 8-weeks. WOMAC subscales of pain and functionality, as well as the visual analog pain scale also demonstrated significant improvements in the 60-minute doses compared to usual care. No significant differences were seen in range of motion at 8-weeks, and no significant effects were seen in any outcome measure at 24-weeks compared to usual care. A dose-response curve based on WOMAC Global scores shows increasing effect with greater total time of massage, but with a plateau at the 60-minute/week dose.Given the superior convenience of a once-weekly protocol, cost savings, and consistency with a typical real-world massage protocol, the 60-minute once weekly dose was determined to be optimal, establishing a standard for future trials.ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00970008."

This drug interferes with the activity of glycolytic enzymes altering their cellular distribution and inhibiting their activities. The aim of the present study was to analyze the effects of clotrimazole on the growth pattern of breast cancer cells correlating with their metabolic profiles.Three cell lines derived from human breast tissue (MCF10A, MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231) that present increasingly aggressive profiles were used. Clotrimazole induces a dose-dependent decrease in glucose uptake in all three cell lines, with K(i) values of 114.3±11.7, 77.1±7.8 and 37.8±4.2 µM for MCF10A, MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231, respectively. Furthermore, the drug also decreases intracellular ATP content and inhibits the major glycolytic enzymes, hexokinase, phosphofructokinase-1 and pyruvate kinase, especially in the highly metastatic cell line, MDA-MB-231. In this last cell lineage, clotrimazole attenuates the robust migratory response, an effect that is progressively attenuated in MCF-7 and MCF10A, respectively. Moreover, clotrimazole reduces the viability of breast cancer cells, which is more pronounced on MDA-MB-231.Clotrimazole presents deleterious effects on two human breast cancer cell lines metabolism, growth and migration, where the most aggressive cell line is more affected by the drug. Moreover, clotrimazole presents little or no effect on a non-tumor human breast cell line.

https://openalex.org/W2055066880,"Introduction Russia has experienced massive fluctuations in mortality at working ages over the past three decades. Routine data analyses suggest that these are largely driven by fluctuations in heavy alcohol drinking. However, individual-level evidence supporting alcohol having a major role in Russian mortality comes from only two case-control studies, which could be subject to serious biases due to their design. Methods and Findings A prospective study of mortality (2003–9) of 2000 men aged 25–54 years at recruitment was conducted in the city of Izhevsk, Russia. This cohort was free from key limitations inherent in the design of the two earlier case-control studies. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to estimate hazard ratios of all-cause mortality by alcohol drinking type as reported by a proxy informant. Hazardous drinkers were defined as those who either drank non-beverage alcohols or were reported to regularly have hangovers or other behaviours related to heavy drinking episodes. Over the follow-up period 113 men died. Compared to non-hazardous drinkers and abstainers, men who drank hazardously had appreciably higher mortality (HR = 3.4, 95% CI 2.2, 5.1) adjusted for age, smoking and education. The population attributable risk percent (PAR%) for hazardous drinking was 26% (95% CI 14,37). However, larger effects were seen in the first two years of follow-up, with a HR of 4.6 (2.5, 8.2) and a corresponding PAR% of 37% (17, 51). Interpretation This prospective cohort study strengthens the evidence that hazardous alcohol consumption has been a major determinant of mortality among working age men in a typical Russian city. As such the similar findings of the previous case-control studies cannot be explained as artefacts of limitations of their design. As Russia struggles to raise life expectancy, which even in 2009 was only 62 years among men, control of hazardous drinking must remain a top public health priority."

Thioesterase superfamily member 2 (Them2; synonym Acot13) is a broadly expressed mitochondria-associated Acot. Them2 was previously identified as an interacting protein of phosphatidylcholine transfer protein (PC-TP). Pctp(-/-) mice exhibit altered fatty acid metabolism that is accompanied by reduced hepatic glucose production. To examine the role of Them2 in regulating hepatic lipid and glucose homeostasis, we generated Them2(-/-) mice. In livers of Them2(-/-) mice compared with Them2(+/+) controls, a 1.9-fold increase in the K(m) of mitochondrial thioesterase activity was accompanied by a 28% increase in fatty acyl-CoA concentration. A reciprocal 23% decrease in free fatty acid concentration was associated with reduced activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α. However, fatty acid oxidation rates were preserved in livers of Them2(-/-) mice, suggesting that Them2 functions to limit β-oxidation. Hepatic glucose production was also decreased by 45% in the setting of reduced hepatocyte nuclear factor 4α (HNF4α) expression. When fed a high-fat diet, Them2(-/-) mice were resistant to increases in hepatic glucose production and steatosis. These findings reveal key roles for Them2 in the regulation of hepatic metabolism, which are potentially mediated by PC-TP-Them2 interactions."

This study investigated speech processing in a group of Mandarin speakers with congenital amusia. Thirteen Mandarin amusics and thirteen matched controls participated in a set of tone and intonation perception tasks and two pitch threshold tasks. Compared with controls, amusics showed impaired performance on word discrimination in natural speech and their gliding tone analogs. They also performed worse than controls on discriminating gliding tone sequences derived from statements and questions, and showed elevated thresholds for pitch change detection and pitch direction discrimination. However, they performed as well as controls on word identification, and on statement-question identification and discrimination in natural speech. Overall, tasks that involved multiple acoustic cues to communicative meaning were not impacted by amusia. Only when the tasks relied mainly on pitch sensitivity did amusics show impaired performance compared to controls. These findings help explain why amusia only affects speech processing in subtle ways. Further studies on a larger sample of Mandarin amusics and on amusics of other language backgrounds are needed to consolidate these results."
https://openalex.org/W1996599680,"Development of interpersonal relationships is a fundamental human motivation, and behaviors facilitating social bonding are prized. Some individuals experience enhanced reward from alcohol in social contexts and may be at heightened risk for developing and maintaining problematic drinking. We employed a 3 (group beverage condition) ×2 (genotype) design (N = 422) to test the moderating influence of the dopamine D4 receptor gene (DRD4 VNTR) polymorphism on the effects of alcohol on social bonding. A significant gene x environment interaction showed that carriers of at least one copy of the 7-repeat allele reported higher social bonding in the alcohol, relative to placebo or control conditions, whereas alcohol did not affect ratings of 7-absent allele carriers. Carriers of the 7-repeat allele were especially sensitive to alcohol's effects on social bonding. These data converge with other recent gene-environment interaction findings implicating the DRD4 polymorphism in the development of alcohol use disorders, and results suggest a specific pathway by which social factors may increase risk for problematic drinking among 7-repeat carriers. More generally, our findings highlight the potential utility of employing transdisciplinary methods that integrate genetic methodologies, social psychology, and addiction theory to improve theories of alcohol use and abuse."

At peak production, more than 5,000 strains were generated per month. These strains were then subject to molecular analysis, and more than 13,300 Mos1 insertions characterized. In addition to targeting directly more than 4,700 genes, these alleles represent the potential starting point for the engineered deletion of essentially all C. elegans genes and the modification of more than 40% of them. This collection of mutants, generated under the auspices of the European NEMAGENETAG consortium, is publicly available and represents an important research resource."

https://openalex.org/W2127452722,"Purpose Sorafenib is a multi-targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor with therapeutic efficacy in several malignancies. Sorafenib may exert its anti-neoplastic effect in part by altering vascular permeability and reducing intra-tumoral interstitial hypertension. As correlative science with a phase II study in patients with advanced soft-tissue sarcomas (STS), we evaluated the impact of this agent on intra-tumor interstitial fluid pressure (IFP), serum circulating biomarkers, and vascular density. Patients and Methods Patients with advanced STS with measurable disease and at least one superficial lesion amenable to biopsy received sorafenib 400 mg twice daily. Intratumoral IFP and plasma and circulating cell biomarkers were measured before and after 1–2 months of sorafenib administration. Results were analyzed in the context of the primary clinical endpoint of time-to-progression (TTP). Results In 15 patients accrued, the median TTP was 45 days (range 14–228). Intra-tumoral IFP measurements obtained in 6 patients at baseline showed a direct correlation with tumor size. Two patients with stable disease at two months had post-sorafenib IFP evaluations and demonstrated a decline in IFP and vascular density. Sorafenib significantly increased plasma VEGF, PlGF, and SDF1α and decreased sVEGFR-2 levels. Increased plasma SDF1α and decreased sVEGFR-2 levels on day 28 correlated with disease progression. Conclusions Pretreatment intra-tumoral IFP correlated with tumor size and decreased in two evaluable patients with SD on sorafenib. Sorafenib also induced changes in circulating biomarkers consistent with expected VEGF pathway blockade, despite the lack of more striking clinical activity in this small series.

https://openalex.org/W2118328195,"Maintaining viable populations of salmon in the wild is a primary goal for many conservation and recovery programs. The frequency and extent of connectivity among natal sources defines the demographic and genetic boundaries of a population. Yet, the role that immigration of hatchery-produced adults may play in altering population dynamics and fitness of natural populations remains largely unquantified. Quantifying, whether natural populations are self-sustaining, functions as sources (population growth rate in the absence of dispersal, λ>1), or as sinks (λ<1) can be obscured by an inability to identify immigrants. In this study we use a new isotopic approach to demonstrate that a natural spawning population of Chinook salmon, (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) considered relatively healthy, represents a sink population when the contribution of hatchery immigrants is taken into consideration. We retrieved sulfur isotopes ((34)S/(32)S, referred to as δ(34)S) in adult Chinook salmon otoliths (ear bones) that were deposited during their early life history as juveniles to determine whether individuals were produced in hatcheries or naturally in rivers. Our results show that only 10.3% (CI = 5.5 to 18.1%) of adults spawning in the river had otolith δ(34)S values less than 8.5‰, which is characteristic of naturally produced salmon. When considering the total return to the watershed (total fish in river and hatchery), we estimate that 90.7 to 99.3% (CI) of returning adults were produced in a hatchery (best estimate = 95.9%). When population growth rate of the natural population was modeled to account for the contribution of previously unidentified hatchery immigrants, we found that hatchery-produced fish caused the false appearance of positive population growth. These findings highlight the potential dangers in ignoring source-sink dynamics in recovering natural populations, and question the extent to which declines in natural salmon populations are undetected by monitoring programs."
https://openalex.org/W1999016910,"Diabetes is associated with higher incidence of myocardial infarction (MI) and increased propensity for subsequent events post-MI. Here we conducted a temporal analysis of the influence of diabetes on cardiac dysfunction and remodeling after ischemia reperfusion (IR) injury in mice. Diabetes was induced using streptozotocin and IR performed by ligating the left anterior descending coronary artery for 30 min followed by reperfusion for up to 42 days. We first evaluated changes in cardiac function using echocardiography after 24 hours reperfusion and observed IR injury significantly decreased the systolic function, such as ejection fraction, fractional shortening and end systolic left ventricular volume (LVESV) in both control and diabetic mice. The longitudinal systolic and diastolic strain rate were altered after IR, but there were no significant differences between diabetic mice and controls. However, a reduced ability to metabolize glucose was observed in the diabetic animals as determined by PET-CT scanning using 2-deoxy-2-(18F)fluoro-D-glucose. Interestingly, after 24 hours reperfusion diabetic mice showed a reduced infarct size and less apoptosis indicated by TUNEL analysis in heart sections. This may be explained by increased levels of autophagy detected in diabetic mice hearts. Similar increases in IR-induced macrophage infiltration detected by CD68 staining indicated no change in inflammation between control and diabetic mice. Over time, control mice subjected to IR developed mild left ventricular dilation whereas diabetic mice exhibited a decrease in both end diastolic left ventricular volume and LVESV with a decreased intraventricular space and thicker left ventricular wall, indicating concentric hypertrophy. This was associated with marked increases in fibrosis, indicted by Masson trichrome staining, of heart sections in diabetic IR group. In summary, we demonstrate that diabetes principally influences distinct IR-induced chronic changes in cardiac function and remodeling, while a smaller infarct size and elevated levels of autophagy with similar cardiac function are observed in acute phase."
https://openalex.org/W2031063067,"Hospital- and community-acquired, complicated skin and soft tissue infections, often attributed to Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes, present a significant health burden that is associated with increased health care costs and mortality. As these two species are difficult to discern on diagnosis and are associated with differential profiles of drug resistance, the development of an efficacious antibacterial agent that targets both organisms is a high priority. Herein we describe a structure-based drug development effort that has produced highly potent inhibitors of dihydrofolate reductase from both species. Optimized propargyl-linked antifolates containing a key pyridyl substituent display antibacterial activity against both methicillin-resistant S. aureus and S. pyogenes at MIC values below 0.1 µg/mL and minimal cytotoxicity against mammalian cells. Further evaluation against a panel of clinical isolates shows good efficacy against a range of important phenotypes such as hospital- and community-acquired strains as well as strains resistant to vancomycin."
https://openalex.org/W2099953660,"The information gathered from the large number of omics experiments in renal biology is underexplored, as it is scattered over many publications or held in supplemental data. To address this, we have developed an open-source Kidney and Urinary Pathway Knowledge Base (KUPKB) that facilitates simple exploration of these omics data. The KUPKB currently comprises 220 data sets (miRNA, mRNA, proteins, and metabolites) extracted from existing publications or databases. Researchers can explore the integrated data using the iKUP browser, and a simple template is provided to submit new omics data sets to the knowledge base. As an example of iKUP's use, we show how we identified, in silico, calreticulin as a protein induced in human interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy (IFTA) in chronic kidney transplant rejection; a link that would have been difficult to establish using existing Web-based tools. Using immunohistochemistry, we validated in vivo this in silico result in human and rat biopsies of IFTA, thus identifying calreticulin as a potential new player in chronic kidney transplant rejection. The KUPKB provides a simple tool that enables users to quickly survey a wide range of omics data sets and has been shown to facilitate rapid hypothesis generation in the context of renal pathophysiology.—Klein, J., Jupp, S., Moulos, P., Fernandez, M., Buffin-Meyer, B., Casemayou, A., Chaaya, R., Charonis, A., Bascands, J.-L., Stevens, R., Schanstra, J.

https://openalex.org/W2159783696,"Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the causative agent of most human tuberculosis, infects one third of the world's population and kills an estimated 1.7 million people a year. With the world-wide emergence of drug resistance, and the finding of more functional genetic diversity than previously expected, there is a renewed interest in understanding the forces driving genome evolution of this important pathogen. Genetic diversity in M. tuberculosis is dominated by single nucleotide polymorphisms and small scale gene deletion, with little or no evidence for large scale genome rearrangements seen in other bacteria. Recently, a single report described a large scale genome duplication that was suggested to be specific to the Beijing lineage. We report here multiple independent large-scale duplications of the same genomic region of M. tuberculosis detected through whole-genome sequencing. The duplications occur in strains belonging to both M. tuberculosis lineage 2 and 4, and are thus not limited to Beijing strains. The duplications occur in both drug-resistant and drug susceptible strains. The duplicated regions also have substantially different boundaries in different strains, indicating different originating duplication events. We further identify a smaller segmental duplication of a different genomic region of a lab strain of H37Rv. The presence of multiple independent duplications of the same genomic region suggests either instability in this region, a selective advantage conferred by the duplication, or both. The identified duplications suggest that large-scale gene duplication may be more common in M. tuberculosis than previously considered."
https://openalex.org/W2067138297,"Background A series of epidemiologic studies have identified the fungus Alternaria as a major risk factor for asthma. The airway epithelium plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of allergic asthma. These reports suggest that activated airway epithelial cells can produce cytokines such as IL-25, TSLP and IL-33 that induce Th2 phenotype. However the epithelium-derived products that mediate the pro-asthma effects of Alternaria are not well characterized. We hypothesized that exposure of the airway epithelium to Alternaria releasing cytokines that can induce Th2 differentiation. Methodology/Principal Finding We used ELISA to measure human and mouse cytokines. Alternaria extract (ALT-E) induced rapid release of IL-18, but not IL-4, IL-9, IL-13, IL-25, IL-33, or TSLP from cultured normal human bronchial epithelial cells; and in the BAL fluids of naïve mice after challenge with ALT-E. Both microscopic and FACS indicated that this release was associated with necrosis of epithelial cells. ALT-E induced much greater IL-18 release compared to 19 major outdoor allergens. Culture of naïve CD4 cells with rmIL-18 induced Th2 differentiation in the absence of IL-4 and STAT6, and this effect was abrogated by disrupting NF- κB p50 or with a NEMO binding peptide inhibitor. Conclusion/Significance Rapid and specific release of IL-18 from Alternaria-exposed damaged airway epithelial cells can directly initiate Th2 differentiation of naïve CD4+ T-cells via a unique NF-κB dependent pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2027768658,"Toll-like receptors (TLRs) that recognize pathogen associated molecular patterns and chemoattractant receptors (CKRs) that orchestrate leukocyte migration to infected tissue are two arms of host innate immunity. Although TLR signaling induces synthesis and secretion of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, which recruit leukocytes, many studies have reported the paradoxical observation that TLR stimulation inhibits leukocyte chemotaxis in vitro and impairs their recruitment to tissues during sepsis. There is consensus that physical loss of chemokine receptor (CKR) at the RNA or protein level or receptor usage switching are the mechanisms underlying this effect. We show here that a brief (<15 min) stimulation with LPS (lipopolysaccharide) at ~0.2 ng/ml inhibited chemotactic response from CCR2, CXCR4 and FPR receptors in monocytes without downmodulation of receptors. A 3 min LPS pre-treatment abolished the polarized accumulation of F-actin, integrins and PIP(3) (phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate) in response to chemokines in monocytes, but not in polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs). If chemoattractants were added before or simultaneously with LPS, chemotactic polarization was preserved. LPS did not alter the initial G-protein signaling, or endocytosis kinetics of agonist-occupied chemoattractant receptors (CKRs). The chemotaxis arrest did not result from downmodulation of receptors or from inordinate increase in adhesion. LPS induced rapid p38 MAPK activation, global redistribution of activated Rap1 (Ras-proximate-1 or Ras-related protein 1) GTPase and Rap1GEF (guanylate exchange factor) Epac1 (exchange proteins activated by cyclic AMP) and disruption of intracellular gradient. Co-inhibition of p38 MAPK and Rap1 GTPase reversed the LPS induced breakdown of chemotaxis suggesting that LPS effect requires the combined function of p38 MAPK and Rap1 GTPase."
https://openalex.org/W2052790397,"We examined the influence of female fertility on the likelihood of male participants aligning their choice of syntactic construction with those of female confederates. Men interacted with women throughout their menstrual cycle. On critical trials during the interaction, the confederate described a picture to the participant using particular syntactic constructions. Immediately thereafter, the participant described to the confederate a picture that could be described using either the same construction that was used by the confederate or an alternative form of the construction. Our data show that the likelihood of men choosing the same syntactic structure as the women was inversely related to the women's level of fertility: higher levels of fertility were associated with lower levels of linguistic matching. A follow-up study revealed that female participants do not show this same change in linguistic behavior as a function of changes in their conversation partner's fertility. We interpret these findings in the context of recent data suggesting that non-conforming behavior may be a means of men displaying their fitness as a mate to women."
https://openalex.org/W2167282339,"Treatment of Parkinson's disease with dopaminergic agents, such as l-DOPA, is frequently compromised by disabling side effects, particularly dyskinesia and a shortening in duration of antiparkinsonian action. Studies in animal models and anecdotal evidence from a patient with Parkinson's disease show that the illicit drug ecstasy (MDMA) can alleviate these side effects, though with many drawbacks (e.g., psychoactivity). MDMA itself thus has little therapeutic potential. On the basis of known structure-psychoactivity relationships, we designed a series of α-substituted MDMA analogues, one of which, bearing an α-cyclopropyl substituent (UWA-101), enhanced the quality of l-DOPA actions in animal models. Indeed, UWA-101 was more effective than MDMA. Unlike MDMA, UWA-101 did not reduce viability of serotonergic cells, exhibit psychoactive properties, or reduce food intake, and did not substitute for MDMA in drug discrimination assays. UWA-101 displayed a unique receptor/transporter binding profile relative to MDMA, with a > 5-fold decrease in affinity for NET and 5-HT2A receptors and a 10-fold increase in affinity for DAT. Furthermore, in a functional reuptake assay, UWA-101 inhibited both 5-HT and dopamine reuptake, while having no effect on the reuptake of noradrenaline. UWA-101 is the first selective DAT/SERT inhibitor described with comparable affinities for these two sites. These data identify a new class of therapeutic in Parkinson's disease and highlight the potential benefits of studying illicit drugs that in themselves would never be considered safe for long-term therapy.—Johnston, T.

https://openalex.org/W2014629571,"Pathogen genetics is already a mainstay of public health investigation and control efforts; now advances in technology make it possible to investigate the role of human genetic variation in the epidemiology of infectious diseases. To describe trends in this field, we analyzed articles that were published from 2001 through 2010 and indexed by the HuGE Navigator, a curated online database of PubMed abstracts in human genome epidemiology. We extracted the principal findings from all meta-analyses and genome-wide association studies (GWAS) with an infectious disease-related outcome. Finally, we compared the representation of diseases in HuGE Navigator with their contributions to morbidity worldwide. We identified 3,730 articles on infectious diseases, including 27 meta-analyses and 23 GWAS. The number published each year increased from 148 in 2001 to 543 in 2010 but remained a small fraction (about 7%) of all studies in human genome epidemiology. Most articles were by authors from developed countries, but the percentage by authors from resource-limited countries increased from 9% to 25% during the period studied. The most commonly studied diseases were HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, hepatitis B infection, hepatitis C infection, sepsis, and malaria. As genomic research methods become more affordable and accessible, population-based research on infectious diseases will be able to examine the role of variation in human as well as pathogen genomes. This approach offers new opportunities for understanding infectious disease susceptibility, severity, treatment, control, and prevention."
https://openalex.org/W1969877067,"The heat shock (HS) response is essential for survival of all organisms. Although the machinery of the HS response has been extensively investigated at the cellular level, it is poorly understood at the level of the organism. Here, we show the crucial role of the mushroom body (MB) in the HS response in Drosophila. Null mutants of the mitochondrial phosphatase Drosophila PGAM5 (dPGAM5) exhibited increased vulnerability to HS, which was reversed by MB-specific expression of the caspase inhibitor p35, and similar vulnerability was induced in wild-type flies by knockdown of MB dPGAM5. Elimination of the MB did not affect the HS response of wild-type flies, but did increase the resistance of dPGAM5-deficient flies to HS. Thus, the MB may possess an apoptosis-dependent toxic function, the suppression of which by dPGAM5 appears to be crucial for HS resistance."
https://openalex.org/W1965913979,"During antiviral drug discovery, it is critical to distinguish molecules that selectively interrupt viral replication from those that reduce virus replication by adversely affecting host cell viability. In this report we investigate the selectivity of inhibitors of the host chaperone proteins cyclophilin A (CypA) and heat-shock protein 90 (HSP90) which have each been reported to inhibit replication of hepatitis C virus (HCV). By comparing the toxicity of the HSP90 inhibitor, 17-(Allylamino)-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-AAG) to two known cytostatic compounds, colchicine and gemcitabine, we provide evidence that 17-AAG exerts its antiviral effects indirectly through slowing cell growth. In contrast, a cyclophilin inhibitor, cyclosporin A (CsA), exhibited selective antiviral activity without slowing cell proliferation. Furthermore, we observed that 17-AAG had little antiviral effect in a non-dividing cell-culture model of HCV replication, while CsA reduced HCV titer by more than two orders of magnitude in the same model. The assays we describe here are useful for discriminating selective antivirals from compounds that indirectly affect virus replication by reducing host cell viability or slowing cell growth."
https://openalex.org/W1996318029,"Recently it was shown that the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) may exert part of its transcriptional activity by mediation of calcineurin (PP2B). Here we investigated the mechanism of interaction of MR with calcineurin and provide a new MR signaling pathway with potential physiological and pathophysiological relevance. MR → calcineurin crosstalk was assessed in a heterologous expression system (human embryonic kidney cells), which provides the opportunity for detailed mechanistic investigation. SiRNA knockdown experiments show that activated MR, but not GR, reduces CREB- and enhances NFaT-mediated transcriptional activation via the catalytic calcineurin subunit PP2BAβ but not via PP2BAα. Altered PP2BAβ expression, elevated cytosolic Ca2+, activation of mitogen-activated kinase [p38, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2], or protein kinase C do not seem to be involved, whereas inhibition of the chaperone heat-shock protein 90 (HSP90) abrogated the effect of MR Coimmunoprecipitation indicates the existence of protein complexes harboring MR and PP2BAβ independent of MR activation but dependent on HSP90. Activated MR alters the subcellular distribution of PP2BAβ, enhancing its nuclear fraction, and reduces mRNA expression of the endogenous inhibitor CAIN (calcineurin inhibitor) but not of RCAN1 (regulator of calcineurin). Overall, transcriptional relevant MR → calcineurin crosstalk occurs via the catalytic subunit PP2BAβ, enables glucocorticoid response element-independent genomic signaling of MR, and is of potential pathophysiological relevance. Mechanistically, the crosstalk results from HSP90-mediated cytosolic protein complex formation, altered subcellular distribution, and altered endogenous inhibitor expression.—Seiferth, A., Ruhs, S., Mildenberger, S., Gekle, M., Grossmann, C.

https://openalex.org/W2035149046,"Background Wig-1 is a transcription factor regulated by p53 that can interact with hnRNP A2/B1, RNA Helicase A, and dsRNAs, which plays an important role in RNA and protein stabilization. in vitro studies have shown that wig-1 binds p53 mRNA and stabilizes it by protecting it from deadenylation. Furthermore, p53 has been implicated as a causal factor in neurodegenerative diseases based in part on its selective regulatory function on gene expression, including genes which, in turn, also possess regulatory functions on gene expression. In this study we focused on the wig-1 transcription factor as a downstream p53 regulated gene and characterized the effects of wig-1 down regulation on gene expression in mouse liver and brain. Methods and Results Antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) were identified that specifically target mouse wig-1 mRNA and produce a dose-dependent reduction in wig-1 mRNA levels in cell culture. These wig-1 ASOs produced marked reductions in wig-1 levels in liver following intraperitoneal administration and in brain tissue following ASO administration through a single striatal bolus injection in FVB and BACHD mice. Wig-1 suppression was well tolerated and resulted in the reduction of mutant Htt protein levels in BACHD mouse brain but had no effect on normal Htt protein levels nor p53 mRNA or protein levels. Expression microarray analysis was employed to determine the effects of wig-1 suppression on genome-wide expression in mouse liver and brain. Reduction of wig-1 caused both down regulation and up regulation of several genes, and a number of wig-1 regulated genes were identified that potentially links wig-1 various signaling pathways and diseases. Conclusion Antisense oligonucleotides can effectively reduce wig-1 levels in mouse liver and brain, which results in specific changes in gene expression for pathways relevant to both the nervous system and cancer."
