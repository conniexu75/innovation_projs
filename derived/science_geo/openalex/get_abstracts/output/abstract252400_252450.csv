We analyzed approximately 78 million base pairs of unique DNA sequence and 2062 polymerase chain reaction-amplified 16S ribosomal DNA sequences obtained from the fecal DNAs of two healthy adults. Using metabolic function analyses of identified genes, we compared our human genome with the average content of previously sequenced microbial genomes. Our microbiome has significantly enriched metabolism of glycans, amino acids, and xenobiotics; methanogenesis; and 2-methyl-d-erythritol 4-phosphate pathway-mediated biosynthesis of vitamins and isoprenoids. Thus, humans are superorganisms whose metabolism represents an amalgamation of microbial and human attributes."
https://openalex.org/W2002258037,"The idea that greater biodiversity increases ecosystem stability has been around for about 50 years, and has been furiously debated for much of that time. There have been precious few rigorous long-term field experiments to test the theory, but a decade-long biodiversity experiment in grassland at the University of Minnesota's Cedar Creek experimental ecological reserve set out to do that. The results are now in and they show that the presence of greater numbers of plant species increases both stability and productivity. Human-driven ecosystem simplification has highlighted questions about how the number of species in an ecosystem influences its functioning. Although biodiversity is now known to affect ecosystem productivity1,2,3,4,5,6, its effects on stability are debated6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13. Here we present a long-term experimental field test of the diversity–stability hypothesis. During a decade of data collection in an experiment that directly controlled the number of perennial prairie species4, growing-season climate varied considerably, causing year-to-year variation in abundances of plant species and in ecosystem productivity. We found that greater numbers of plant species led to greater temporal stability of ecosystem annual aboveground plant production. In particular, the decadal temporal stability of the ecosystem, whether measured with intervals of two, five or ten years, was significantly greater at higher plant diversity and tended to increase as plots matured. Ecosystem stability was also positively dependent on root mass, which is a measure of perenniating biomass. Temporal stability of the ecosystem increased with diversity, despite a lower temporal stability of individual species, because of both portfolio (statistical averaging) and overyielding effects. However, we found no evidence of a covariance effect. Our results indicate that the reliable, efficient and sustainable supply of some foods (for example, livestock fodder), biofuels and ecosystem services can be enhanced by the use of biodiversity."
https://openalex.org/W2150571570,"The mechanisms underlying induction and suppression of RNA silencing in the ongoing plant-virus arms race are poorly understood. We show here that virus-derived small RNAs produced by Arabidopsis Dicer-like 4 (DCL4) program an effector complex conferring antiviral immunity. Inhibition of DCL4 by a viral-encoded suppressor revealed the subordinate antiviral activity of DCL2. Accordingly, inactivating both DCL2 and DCL4 was necessary and sufficient to restore systemic infection of a suppressor-deficient virus. The effects of DCL2 were overcome by increasing viral dosage in inoculated leaves, but this could not surmount additional, non–cell autonomous effects of DCL4 specifically preventing viral unloading from the vasculature. These findings define a molecular framework for studying antiviral silencing and defense in plants."
https://openalex.org/W2023016915,"During the interval from September through early December 2005, the Hayabusa spacecraft was in close proximity to near-Earth asteroid 25143 Itokawa, and a variety of data were taken on its shape, mass, and surface topography as well as its mineralogic and elemental abundances. The asteroid's orthogonal axes are 535, 294, and 209 meters, the mass is 3.51 × 10 10 kilograms, and the estimated bulk density is 1.9 ± 0.13 grams per cubic centimeter. The correspondence between the smooth areas on the surface (Muses Sea and Sagamihara) and the gravitationally low regions suggests mass movement and an effective resurfacing process by impact jolting. Itokawa is considered to be a rubble-pile body because of its low bulk density, high porosity, boulder-rich appearance, and shape. The existence of very large boulders and pillars suggests an early collisional breakup of a preexisting parent asteroid followed by a re-agglomeration into a rubble-pile object."

Here we generate small particles of solid hydrogen that can be used to image the cores of quantized vortices in their three-dimensional environment of liquid helium. This technique enables the geometry and interactions of these vortices to be observed directly."

https://openalex.org/W2103622571,"The reprogramming of DNA-binding specificity is an important challenge for computational protein design that tests current understanding of protein-DNA recognition, and has considerable practical relevance for biotechnology and medicine. Here we describe the computational redesign of the cleavage specificity of the intron-encoded homing endonuclease I-MsoI using a physically realistic atomic-level forcefield. Using an in silico screen, we identified single base-pair substitutions predicted to disrupt binding by the wild-type enzyme, and then optimized the identities and conformations of clusters of amino acids around each of these unfavourable substitutions using Monte Carlo sampling. A redesigned enzyme that was predicted to display altered target site specificity, while maintaining wild-type binding affinity, was experimentally characterized. The redesigned enzyme binds and cleaves the redesigned recognition site approximately 10,000 times more effectively than does the wild-type enzyme, with a level of target discrimination comparable to the original endonuclease. Determination of the structure of the redesigned nuclease-recognition site complex by X-ray crystallography confirms the accuracy of the computationally predicted interface. These results suggest that computational protein design methods can have an important role in the creation of novel highly specific endonucleases for gene therapy and other applications."

https://openalex.org/W1988150327,"Patients with alcoholic liver disease frequently exhibit iron overload in association with increased hepatic fibrosis. Even moderate alcohol consumption elevates body iron stores; however, the underlying molecular mechanisms are unknown. Hepcidin, a circulatory peptide synthesized in the liver, is a key mediator of iron metabolism. Ethanol metabolism significantly down-regulated both in vitro and in vivo hepcidin mRNA and protein expression. 4-Methylpyrazole, a specific inhibitor of the alcohol-metabolizing enzymes, abolished the effects of ethanol on hepcidin. However, ethanol did not alter the expression of transferrin receptor1 and ferritin or the activation of iron regulatory RNA-binding proteins, IRP1 and IRP2. Mice maintained on 10-20% ethanol for 7 days displayed down-regulation of liver hepcidin expression without changes in liver triglycerides or histology. This was accompanied by elevated duodenal divalent metal transporter1 and ferroportin protein expression. Injection of hepcidin peptide negated the effect of ethanol on duodenal iron transporters. Ethanol down-regulated hepcidin promoter activity and the DNA binding activity of CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein α (C/EBPα) but not β. Interestingly, the antioxidants vitamin E and N-acetylcysteine abolished both the alcohol-mediated down-regulation of C/EBPα binding activity and hepcidin expression in the liver and the up-regulation of duodenal divalent metal transporter 1. Collectively, these findings indicate that alcohol metabolism-mediated oxidative stress regulates hepcidin transcription via C/EBPα, which in turn leads to increased duodenal iron transport.

Moreover, increased hepatic iron content is associated with greater mortality from alcoholic cirrhosis, suggesting a pathogenic role of iron in alcoholic liver disease. Genetic hemochromatosis, a common iron overload disorder in the Caucasian population, in conjunction with excessive alcohol consumption exacerbates liver injury (6Fletcher L.M. Dixon J.L. Purdie D.M. Powell L.W. Crawford D.H. Gastroenterology. 2002; 122: 281-289Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Both iron and ethanol individually cause oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation, which result in cellular injury (7Bonkovsky H.L. Lambrecht R.W. Shan Y.

Despite these observations, the underlying mechanisms of iron accumulation observed in alcoholic liver disease remain unclear. A series of novel iron-regulatory proteins, including iron transporters and soluble mediators have been identified, that have greatly enhanced our understanding of iron metabolism (9Gunshin H.

Hepcidin knock-out mice develop iron overload in the liver, pancreas, and heart, whereas mice overexpressing hepcidin display severe iron deficiency and anemia (13Nicolas G. Bennoun M. Devaux I.

Iron overload increases and iron deficiency decreases the expression of hepcidin in the liver. Hepcidin is believed to act as a soluble mediator of iron metabolism by regulating intestinal iron absorption and the release of iron from macrophages (19Nicolas G. Viatte L. Bennoun M. Beaumont C.

Patients with alcoholic liver disease have been observed to inappropriately absorb lipopolysaccharide from their intestine, leading to the release of proinflammatory cytokines and recruitment of inflammatory cells to the liver (25Rao R.K. Seth A. Sheth P. Am. J. Physiol. Gastrointest. Liver Physiol. 2004; 286: 881-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). However, the role of hepcidin in alcoholic liver disease is unknown. Understanding the molecular mechanisms of ethanol and iron interaction is of considerable clinical importance because both alcoholic liver disease and genetic hemochromatosis are common diseases in which alcohol and iron appear to act synergistically to cause liver injury. In this study we determined the molecular mechanisms of iron overload mediated by alcohol metabolism. Animal Experiments—Animal experiments were approved by the animal ethics committee at the University of Nebraska Medical Center. 129/Sv strain male and female mice (Charles River Laboratories) were housed individually and maintained on rodent chow diet-7012 (Harland Teklad Global Diets). 10-20% ethanol was added in the drinking water. For vitamin E experiments, mice were fed with either normal (control) (50 IU of vitamin E/kg) or high vitamin E (2000 IU of vitamin E/kg) diets (Research Diets, Inc.) for a week. Subsequently, these mice were either untreated or exposed to 20% ethanol for another week and then sacrificed. For N-acetylcysteine studies, untreated and ethanol-treated mice received a single daily injection (intraperitoneal) of either N-acetylcysteine (0.2 mg/g of body weight in 0.9% NaCl) or 0.9% NaCl alone (as control) for a week and then sacrificed. For hepcidin experiments, untreated and ethanol-treated mice were injected daily with the soluble hepcidin peptide (1 μg/g of body weight in 0.9% NaCl, Peptides International, Inc.) or 0.9% NaCl alone between days 4 and 7. Cell Culture and Alcohol and Acetaldehyde Treatments—Parental HepG2 cells, a human hepatoma cell line, do not express alcohol-metabolizing enzymes nor do they metabolize alcohol. VL-17A cells, provided by Dr. D. Clemens, express both alcohol dehydrogenase and cytochrome P450 2E1 and metabolize alcohol (26Donohue T.M. Osna N.A. Clemens D.L. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2006; 38: 92-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). All cells were plated on poly-l-lysine (Sigma Aldrich)-coated flasks and maintained in high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with glutamine and 10% fetal calf serum (Hyclone). Antibiotics were routinely added to the media for the selection of alcohol dehydrogenase (G418, 0.5 mg/ml) and cytochrome P450 2E1 (zeocin, 0.4 mg/ml) expression. Cells (1 × 106) were plated in 25-cm2 flasks the day before the experiment. The next day fresh culture medium was supplemented with 25 mm HEPES (pH 7.2) and alcohol or acetaldehyde, and the flask lids were tightened to avoid evaporation. For treatments of acetaldehyde, 75 μm cyanamide (Sigma Aldrich) was added to the media to eliminate the degradation of acetaldehyde. Cell viability was 80-95% (trypan blue exclusion) under these conditions. RNA Isolation and Northern Blotting—Cells or organs washed with phosphate-buffered saline were lysed in Trizol® (Invitrogen), and total RNA was isolated according to the manufacturer's specifications. Northern blotting was performed with 5-10 μg of total RNA by using the Northern Max kit (Ambion, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Hybridization was performed with 32P-labeled mouse hepcidin, and 18 S ribosomal RNA transcripts were prepared by the MAXIscript T7 in vitro transcription kit (Ambion Inc.). Mouse hepcidin open reading frame sequences were amplified by using the following forward primer (5′-atggcactcagcactcgga-3′) and reverse primer (5′-ctatgttttgcaacagatacca-3′). PCR fragments were cloned into pGEM-T Easy Vector (Promega). cDNA Synthesis and Real-time Quantitative PCR Analysis— cDNA was synthesized using 2-4 μg of isolated RNA, 2.5 μm random primers (Applied Biosystems), and 200 units of Superscript II RNase H reverse transcriptase enzyme (Invitrogen). To exclude possible genomic DNA contamination, control samples were employed in which the reverse transcriptase enzyme was omitted from the cDNA synthesis reaction. Gene expression was analyzed by real-time quantitative PCR using an ABI Prism 7700 sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems). Specific primers and TaqMan fluorescent probes (5′-6-carboxyfluorescein; 3′-6-carboxytetramethylrhodamine) flanking about 70 base pairs of the open reading frame sequences were designed by the Primer Express 1.5 program (Applied Biosystems). Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) 2The abbreviations used are: GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; C/EBP, CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein; ROS, reactive oxygen species; siRNA, small interfering RNA; IRP, iron regulatory RNA-binding protein; Ct, cycle number at the linear amplification threshold. gene probes (Applied Biosystems) were used as the endogenous controls. Species-specific sequences of the TaqMan fluorescent probes and sense and antisense primers are listed in Table 1. cDNA was employed as a template in PCR reactions. After PCR (50 °C for 2 min, 95 °C for 10 min (1 cycle), 95 °C for 15 s, and 60 °C for 1 min (40 cycles)), the data were analyzed using Sequence Detection Systems software (Applied Biosystems), and the cycle number at the linear amplification threshold (Ct) of the endogenous control (GAPDH) gene and the target gene was recorded. Relative gene expression (the amount of target, normalized to the endogenous control gene) was calculated using the comparative Ct method formula 2−ΔΔCt. The amplification efficiency of control and target genes was calculated from the kinetic curves as described (27Liu W. Saint D.A. Anal.

The DH4 antiserum was purified further with glutathione-agarose beads (Sigma Aldrich) to eliminate anti-glutathione S-transferase-specific IgG proteins. The anti-ferroportin polyclonal antibodies were produced by injecting mice with 2 keyhole limpet (KLH)-conjugated 23 amino acid peptides corresponding to amino acids 74-96 and 159-181 of rat ferroportin protein (NCBI Entrez protein accession number AAK77858). These regions of rat ferroportin protein share 100 and 93.5% homology with those of mouse and human ferroportin proteins, respectively. Polyclonal IRP2 antibody was a gift from Dr. E. Leiboldt (Univ. of Utah), and ferritin heavy chain subunit antibody was obtained commercially (Novus Biologicals). N-terminal (EG(2)-Hep-N) and C-terminal (EG(2)-Hep-C) pro-hepcidin antibodies, which recognize the hepcidin precursor protein, were produced as described (18Kulaksiz H. Gehrke S.G. Janetzko A.

Western Blotting—Tissue lysates were prepared by homogenizing with a Dounce homogenizer and incubating (20 min, 4 °C) in lysis buffer (10 mm Tris/HCl (pH 7.4), 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, Complete® protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Diagnostics), 1% Triton-X-100) and subsequent centrifugation at 3000 × g for 5 min. Supernatants were utilized for Western blots. To confirm equal protein loading, identical samples were blotted with the anti-GAPDH (Chemicon International) monoclonal antibody. Immune-reactive bands were detected by the ImmunStar™ anti-rabbit-AP or anti-mouse-HRP kits (Bio-Rad). The Western blots with pro-hepcidin antibodies were performed as described (18Kulaksiz H.

Dihydroethidium Labeling of Liver Tissue—In situ reactive oxygen species (ROS) production was evaluated by staining with dihydroethidium (Invitrogen), which is freely permeable across cell membranes (29Carter W.O. Narayanan P.K. Robinson J.P. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1994; 55: 253-258Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).

VL-17A cells were transfected with the reporter constructs by using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). 16 h after transfection, cells were either untreated or treated with 25 mm ethanol for 48 h. Reporter assays were performed with the luciferase assay system kit (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions by using a luminometer (Luminoskan RS, Lab-systems). pGL3-basic and pGL3-promoter vectors were used as negative and positive controls, respectively. Electrophoretic Mobility Gel-shift Assay and Small Interfering RNAs (siRNA) Treatment—Mouse liver nuclear lysate isolation and gel-shift assays were performed as described (32Timchenko N.A. Wilde M. Darlington G.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2936-2945Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, livers were homogenized in buffer A (20 mm Tris/HCl (pH 7.5), 50 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, and 5 mm dithiothreitol). Nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation at 2000 × g for 10 min and washed with buffer A. High salt extraction of nuclear proteins was performed with buffer B (25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.42 m NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm EDTA, and 25% sucrose) for 30 min on ice. After centrifugation, the supernatant (nuclear extract) was frozen and kept at −80 °C. Gel-shift assays were performed by using the oligonucleotide 5′-CATGGATGGTATTGAGAAATCTG-3′ (C/EBP binding site is shown in bold) as a probe. 5-10 μg of nuclear extract protein was used for each binding reaction. pADtrack-CMV construct with siRNA against C/EBPα was created as described (33Wang G.L. Iakova P. Wilde M. Awad S. Timchenko N.A. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 912-925Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). VL-17A cells were transfected with siRNA by using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). 48 h after transfection, green fluorescent protein-positive cells were sorted by a fluorescence-activated cell sorter Vantage SE/Diva cell sorter (BD Biosciences) at the University of Nebraska Flow Cytometry Core Facility, and total RNA and cell lysates were prepared as described above. Statistical Analysis—Each real-time quantitative PCR experiment was performed with duplicate samples for each tested gene. The results presented represent the mean (±S.E.) of several experiments (n ≥ 3) performed with separate cDNA reactions. Statistical significance was calculated using the non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis test. To investigate the effect of ethanol metabolism on in vivo hepcidin expression, we treated 129/Sv mice with 10-20% ethanol for 7 days. Mice consumed an average of 3.6 ± 0.38 ml of 10% and 2.55 ± 0.42 ml of 20% ethanol per day (Fig. 1A). Control (untreated) mice consumed 4.57 ± 0.21 ml of plain water per day (data not shown). The mean blood alcohol levels of mice fed with 10 or 20% ethanol for 7 days were 121.5 ± 36 and 158 ± 33.9 mg/dl, respectively (Fig. 1, B and C). Mice express two copies of hepcidin gene. Therefore, TaqMan fluorescent probes specific for mouse hepcidin 1 or mouse hepcidin 2 were employed to measure hepcidin mRNA expression. Three days of treatment with 10 or 20% ethanol did not alter hepcidin expression (data not shown). However, a significant down-regulation of liver hepcidin 1 expression was observed in both male and female 129 mice treated with 10% ethanol for 7 days (Fig. 2, A and B). No significant alcohol-mediated changes were observed with hepcidin 2 (data not shown). A more pronounced down-regulation of hepcidin 1 was observed with 20% ethanol treatment (Fig. 2, C and D). There were no significant gender differences observed in mice administered 10% ethanol. However, with 20% ethanol, male mice displayed significantly (p = 0.005) lower liver hepcidin 1 expression (Fig. 2, C and D). Northern blot analysis also documented a significant down-regulation of liver hepcidin mRNA in ethanol-treated mice compared with untreated mice (Fig. 2E). Similar to 129 mice, C57BL/6 mice treated with 10% or 20% ethanol for 7 days also displayed significant down-regulation of liver hepcidin 1 mRNA expression compared with untreated mice (data not shown). Hepcidin has been shown to regulate duodenal iron absorption (34Laftah A.H. Ramesh B. Simpson R.J. Solanky N. Bahram S. Schumann K. Debnam E.S. Srai S.K. Blood. 2004; 103: 3940-3944Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 35Yamaji S. Sharp P. Ramesh B. Srai S.K. Blood. 2004; 104: 2178-2180Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). We, therefore, investigated the effects of decreased liver hepcidin expression on the expression of the duodenal iron transport proteins, DMT1 and ferroportin. We observed a significant up-regulation of the duodenal DMT1 and ferroportin proteins in 129 mice exposed to 10 or 20% ethanol for 1 week (Fig. 3, A-C). Similarly, C57BL/6 mice treated with ethanol for 1 week displayed significant up-regulation of both duodenal DMT1 and ferroportin proteins (Fig. 3, D-F). Injection of 129 mice with hepcidin peptide abolished the up-regulation of both DMT1 and ferroportin protein in duodenum of mice exposed to ethanol compared with untreated mice (Fig. 3, G-I). To investigate the effect of ethanol metabolism on hepcidin expression in vitro, we employed VL-17A cells, a HepG2 cell line transfected with both alcohol-metabolizing enzymes, alcohol dehydrogenase and cytochrome P450 2E1, which hence, can metabolize alcohol (26Donohue T.M. Osna N.A. Clemens D.L. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2006; 38: 92-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). As the control, parental, non-recombinant HepG2 cells, which do not metabolize alcohol, were utilized. For the in vitro experiments, 25 mm ethanol concentration was selected because treatment of VL-17A and HepG2 cells with 25 mm ethanol for 2 days did not cause any cytotoxicity, as determined by lactate dehydrogenase assays (data not shown). Furthermore, a 25 mm ethanol concentration can be readily attained by the drinking population. Hepcidin expression levels were similar in VL-17A and parental HepG2 cells, as confirmed by reverse transcription-PCR and northern blotting (data not shown). The down-regulation of hepcidin expression in VL-17A cells treated with 25 mm ethanol was 2.9-fold by day 2 (0.35 ± 0.01) compared with untreated cells (1 ± 0) (Fig. 4A, lanes 1 and 2). However, treatment with 50 mm isopropanol did not alter hepcidin expression (Fig. 4A, lane 3). 4-Methylpyrazole, a specific inhibitor of alcohol dehydrogenase and cytochrome P450 2E1 (36Blomstrand R. Theorell H. Life Sci. II. 1970; 9: 631-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), blocked the down-regulation of hepcidin expression by ethanol (Fig. 4A, lanes 4 and 5). 50 μm acetaldehyde, the byproduct of ethanol metabolism, also down-regulated hepcidin expression (Fig. 4A, lane 6). Hepcidin expression was unaltered in 25 mm ethanol-treated parental HepG2 cells, which do not metabolize alcohol (Fig. 4A, lanes 7 and 8). However, 50 μm acetaldehyde down-regulated hepcidin expression in HepG2 cells (Fig. 4A, lane 9). In accordance with mRNA data, the expression of hepcidin precursor protein (prohepcidin) was also reduced in 25 mm ethanol-treated VL-17A cells but not parental HepG2 cells, as detected with anti-prohepcidin antibodies, as described under “Experimental Procedures” (Fig. 4, B-E). Iron overload has been shown to up-regulate hepcidin expression in vivo but to down-regulate hepcidin expression in vitro (12Pigeon C. Ilyin G. Courselaud B. Leroyer P. Turlin B. Brissot P. Loreal O.

Blood. 2003; 101: 2461-2463Crossref PubMed Scopus (1191) Google Scholar). We, therefore, determined the effect of ethanol on the expression of other iron-regulatory proteins, namely transferrin receptor 1, ferritin, and the RNA binding proteins, IRP1 and IRP2, which are regulated by changes in intracellular iron levels (11Hentze M.W. Muckenthaler M.U. Andrews N.C. Cell. 2004; 117: 285-297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1401) Google Scholar). Ethanol did not alter the expression of the transferrin receptor 1, ferritin, and IRP2 in VL-17A cells compared with untreated cells (Fig. 5, A-C). As confirmed by RNA gel-shift assays, exposure to 25 mm ethanol did not significantly (p < 0.245) alter IRP1 RNA binding activity in VL-17A cells (Fig. 5, D and E). No obvious tissue injury or lipid accumulation was detected in the liver of 129 mice treated with 20% ethanol, as determined by hematoxylin and eosin staining (Fig. 6, A and B). Moreover, we did not detect any changes in liver triglyceride levels in 129 mice treated with 20% ethanol compared with untreated mice (Fig. 6C). However, oxidative stress is considered to be one of the early events in the progression of alcoholic liver disease (38Sun A.Y. Ingelman-Sundberg M. Neve E. Matsumoto H. Nishitani Y. Minowa Y.

The onboard camera imaged the solid surface of this tiny asteroid (535 meters by 294 meters by 209 meters) with a spatial resolution of 70 centimeters per pixel, revealing diverse surface morphologies. Unlike previously explored asteroids, the surface of Itokawa reveals both rough and smooth terrains. Craters generally show unclear morphologies. Numerous boulders on Itokawa's surface suggest a rubble-pile structure."
https://openalex.org/W2068649062,"The ranging instrument aboard the Hayabusa spacecraft measured the surface topography of asteroid 25143 Itokawa and its mass. A typical rough area is similar in roughness to debris located on the interior wall of a large crater on asteroid 433 Eros, which suggests a surface structure on Itokawa similar to crater ejecta on Eros. The mass of Itokawa was estimated as (3.58 +/- 0.18) x 10(10) kilograms, implying a bulk density of (1.95 +/- 0.14) grams per cubic centimeter for a volume of (1.84 +/- 0.09) x 10(7) cubic meters and a bulk porosity of approximately 40%, which is similar to that of angular sands, when assuming an LL (low iron chondritic) meteorite composition. Combined with surface observations, these data indicate that Itokawa is the first subkilometer-sized small asteroid showing a rubble-pile body rather than a solid monolithic asteroid."
https://openalex.org/W2039723617,"Uncovering the existence of a two-dimensional quantum critical point in a material that is in other respects electronically three-dimensional elucidates the subtle collective behaviours responsible for this reduction in dimensionality. Competition between electronic ground states near a quantum critical point1,2 (QCP)—the location of a zero-temperature phase transition driven solely by quantum-mechanical fluctuations—is expected to lead to unconventional behaviour in low-dimensional systems3. New electronic phases of matter have been predicted to occur in the vicinity of a QCP by two-dimensional theories3,4,5,6,7,8, and explanations based on these ideas have been proposed for significant unsolved problems in condensed-matter physics, such as non-Fermi-liquid behaviour and high-temperature superconductivity. But the real materials to which these ideas have been applied are usually rendered three-dimensional by a finite electronic coupling between their component layers; a two-dimensional QCP has not been experimentally observed in any bulk three-dimensional system, and mechanisms for dimensional reduction have remained the subject of theoretical conjecture9,10,11. Here we show evidence that the Bose–Einstein condensate of spin triplets in the three-dimensional Mott insulator BaCuSi2O6 (refs 12–16) provides an experimentally verifiable example of dimensional reduction at a QCP. The interplay of correlations on a geometrically frustrated lattice causes the individual two-dimensional layers of spin-½ Cu2+ pairs (spin dimers) to become decoupled at the QCP, giving rise to a two-dimensional QCP characterized by linear power law scaling distinctly different from that of its three-dimensional counterpart. Thus the very notion of dimensionality can be said to acquire an ‘emergent’ nature: although the individual particles move on a three-dimensional lattice, their collective behaviour occurs in lower-dimensional space."

https://openalex.org/W2075115399,"The axoneme, which forms the core of eukaryotic flagella and cilia, is one of the largest macromolecular machines, with a structure that is largely conserved from protists to mammals. Microtubule doublets are structural components of axonemes that contain a number of proteins besides tubulin, and are usually found in arrays of nine doublets arranged around two singlet microtubules. Coordinated sliding of adjacent doublets, which involves a host of other proteins in the axoneme, produces periodic beating movements of the axoneme. We have obtained a three-dimensional density map of intact microtubule doublets using cryo-electron tomography and image averaging. Our map, with a resolution of about 3 nm, provides insights into locations of particular proteins within the doublets and the structural features of the doublets that define their mechanical properties. We identify likely candidates for several of these non-tubulin components of the doublets. This work offers insight on how tubulin protofilaments and accessory proteins attach together to form the doublets and provides a structural basis for understanding doublet function in axonemes."

https://openalex.org/W1989467089,"Selector genes modify developmental pathways to sculpt animal body parts. Although body parts differ in size, the ways in which selector genes create size differences are unknown. We have studied how the Drosophila Hox gene Ultrabithorax ( Ubx ) limits the size of the haltere, which, by the end of larval development, has ∼fivefold fewer cells than the wing. We find that Ubx controls haltere size by restricting both the transcription and the mobility of the morphogen Decapentaplegic (Dpp). Ubx restricts Dpp's distribution in the haltere by increasing the amounts of the Dpp receptor, thickveins . Because morphogens control tissue growth in many contexts, these findings provide a potentially general mechanism for how selector genes modify organ sizes."
https://openalex.org/W2014784442,"We have previously reported that glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) is tightly correlated with pyruvate carboxylase (PC)-catalyzed anaplerotic flux into the tricarboxylic acid cycle and stimulation of pyruvate cycling activity. To further evaluate the role of PC in β-cell function, we constructed a recombinant adenovirus containing a small interfering RNA (siRNA) specific to PC (Ad-siPC). Ad-siPC reduced PC mRNA levels by 83 and 64% and PC protein by 56 and 35% in INS-1-derived 832/13 cells and primary rat islets, respectively. Surprisingly, this manipulation did not impair GSIS in rat islets. In Ad-siPC-treated 832/13 cells, GSIS was slightly increased, whereas glycolytic rate and glucose oxidation were unaffected. Flux through PC at high glucose was decreased by only 20%, suggesting an increase in PC-specific activity. Acetyl carnitine, a surrogate for acetyl-CoA, an allosteric activator of PC, was increased by 36% in Ad-siPC-treated cells, suggesting a mechanism by which PC enzymatic activity is maintained with suppressed PC protein levels. In addition, the NADPH:NADP ratio, a proposed coupling factor for GSIS, was unaffected in Ad-siPC-treated cells. We conclude that β-cells activate compensatory mechanisms in response to suppression of PC expression that prevent impairment of anaplerosis, pyruvate cycling, NAPDH production, and GSIS.

The most well characterized coupling factor for GSIS is the cytosolic ATP:ADP ratio. It is established that this ratio increases in response to increased glucose metabolism in β-cells, resulting in closure of ATP-sensitive K+ (KATP) channels, plasma membrane depolarization, and activation of voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels. The resulting increase in cellular calcium promotes exocytosis of insulin-containing granules (reviewed in Refs. 1Tarasov A. Dusonchet J. Ashcroft F. Diabetes. 2004; 53: S113-S122Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar and 2Newgard C.B. Matschinsky F.M. Jefferson J. Cherrington A. Handbook of Physiology. 2. Oxford University Press, Oxford2001: 125-151Google Scholar). However, significant GSIS also occurs under conditions where closure of KATP channels is prevented, demonstrating an important role for KATP channel-independent pathways for fuel-regulated insulin granule exocytosis (3Gembal M. Detimary P. Gilon P. Gao Z.Y. Henquin J.C. J. Clin. Investig. 1993; 91: 871-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Pancreatic β-cells have a remarkable capacity for anaplerotic influx of substrates into the tricarboxylic acid cycle due to high levels of the biotin-dependent enzyme pyruvate carboxylase (PC), which converts pyruvate to oxaloacetate (OXA). It has been estimated that ∼40-50% of pyruvate enters β-cell mitochondrial metabolism through PC at stimulatory glucose concentrations (4Khan A. Ling Z.C. Landau B.R. J. Biol.

PC-mediated anaplerosis plays a central role in β-cell function, as supported by the following observations. 1) PC-mediated pyruvate exchange with tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates (“pyruvate cycling”), rather than the fractional contribution of glucose to acetyl-CoA formation (pyruvate dehydrogenase-catalyzed pyruvate metabolism), correlates with insulin secretion in a set of INS-1-derived cell lines with varying capacities for GSIS (5Lu D. Mulder H. Zhao P. Burgess S.C. Jensen M.V. Kamzolova S. Newgard C.B. Sherry A.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 2708-2713Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). 2) In lipid-cultured 832/13 insulinoma cells, the normal glucose-induced increment in pyruvate cycling is abolished in concert with profound suppression of GSIS (8Boucher A.

Diabetologia. 2006; (Epub ahead of print)PubMed Google Scholar). 4) Culture of MIN6 cells or islets in the presence of a specific agonist for liver X receptor for 72 h induces expression of several genes, including PC. This treatment also results in increased GSIS, an effect that is abolished in the presence of phenylacetic acid (11Efanov A.M. Sewing S. Bokvist K. Gromada J. Diabetes. 2004; 53: S75-S78Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). A potential role of PC-mediated pyruvate cycling in β-cells may be to generate NADPH, a suggested coupling factor for GSIS (12Ivarsson R. Quintens R. Dejonghe S. Tsukamoto K. 't Veld P. Renstrom E. Schuit F.C. Diabetes. 2005; 54: 2132-2142Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 13MacDonald M.J. Fahien L.A. Brown L.J. Hasan N.M. Buss J.D. Kendrick M.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2005; 288: E1-E15Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). In support of this idea, we have recently demonstrated that siRNA-mediated silencing of the mitochondrial citrate/isocitrate carrier resulted in a dramatic decrease in GSIS and a corresponding reduction of the NADPH:NADP ratio in β-cells (14Joseph J.W. Collier J.J. Fueger P.T. Newgard C.B. Diabetes. 2005; 54: A43Google Scholar). Similarly, siRNA-mediated suppression of cytosolic, NADP-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase caused impairment of GSIS in concert with a decrease in pyruvate cycling flux and NADPH:NADP ratio (15Ronnebaum S.M. Ilkayeva O. Burgess S.C. Lu D. Joseph J.W. Stevens R.D. Becker T.C. Sherry A.D. Newgard C.B. Jensen M.V. Diabetes. 2005; 54: A423Google Scholar). In the present study, we have continued our investigation of the role of PC-mediated anaplerosis and pyruvate cycling in control of GSIS by applying siRNA technologies to manipulate the expression levels of PC in INS-1-derived 832/13 cells and primary rat islets. Surprisingly, siRNA-mediated suppression of PC protein expression did not impair GSIS in either cell lines or primary cells. This lack of impact on GSIS appears to be explained by an increase in acetyl-CoA levels, which in turn allosterically activates PC, thereby largely maintaining flux through the enzyme despite lower expression. We also present evidence consistent with the idea that flux through the cytosolic, NADP-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase is maintained at the expense of flux through the mitochondrial, NAD-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase enzyme, thus maintaining NADPH levels and preventing GSIS from declining. These studies identify compensatory mechanisms by which the β-cell defends against suppression of anaplerotic flux, pyruvate cycling, cytosolic NADPH production, and ultimately GSIS in response to lowering of PC expression.

The PC-targeting sequences used were GGT GGC CAA GGA GAA TGG T (siPC1), GGA GAA TGG TGT AGA TGCT (siPC2), and GGA AAA CAT CCG AAT CAA T(siPC3).

To study the effect of reduced PC expression, insulinoma cells were treated at 20-25% confluency with Ad-siPC at one of two doses (10 × 106 plaque-forming units/ml of medium, Ad-siPC, low; or 20 × 106 plaque-forming units/ml, Ad-siPC, high) or Ad-siControl at a dose of 20 × 106 plaque-forming units/ml. After 16 h of exposure, virus-containing medium was removed, and cells were cultured for an additional 72 h before analysis. Quantification of PC mRNA Levels Using Real-time PCR—RNA was isolated using either the Qiagen RNeasy mini kit (cell lines) or Qiagen RNeasy micro kit (islets; Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA) and reverse transcribed with iScript cDNA synthesis kit (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis of PC mRNA levels was performed using the TaqMan® gene expression assay from Applied Biosystems. As a loading control, prevalidated primers and probes against rat cyclophilin B were included (Applied Biosystems). Measurements were performed with the ABI Prism 7000 sequence detection system. Quantification of PC Protein Levels Using Streptavidin Blotting—Adenovirus-treated cells or rat islets were lysed in 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1% IGEGAL CA-630, and cleared protein lysates were loaded onto denaturing NuPAGE 3-8% Tris-acetate gels (Invitrogen) and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Invitrogen). After blocking overnight in 5% milk diluted in Tris-buffered saline/0.1% Tween 20, membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin (Chemicon, Temecula, CA) diluted 1:4000 in Tris-buffered saline/0.1% Tween 20 containing 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) for 45 min. Membranes were washed for 4 × 5 min in Tris-buffered saline/0.1% Tween 20, and PC levels were quantified on a VersaDoc™ Model 4000 imaging system, using the biotin-binding protein propionyl-CoA carboxylase as a loading control (Bio-Rad). Insulin Secretion and Content in INS-1-derived Cells—Cells treated with duplexes or viruses as described above and grown to confluency were washed with PBS and preincubated for 1.5 h in secretion buffer (114 mm NaCl, 4.7 mm KCl, 1.2 mm KH2PO4, 1.16 mm MgSO4, 20 mm HEPES, 2.5 mm CaCl2, 0.2% BSA, pH 7.2) containing 2.5 mm glucose. For GSIS, cells were incubated in secretion buffer for an additional2hinthe presence of 2.5 or 12 mm glucose as indicated, followed by collection of buffer samples for insulin radioimmunoassay. For insulin content measurements, cells were lysed in 0.1 m acetic acid, 0.1% BSA under mild sonication on ice. After centrifugation for 5 min at 12,000 × g at 4 °C, the extracts were neutralized by dilution in PBS. Insulin levels in secretion buffer and extracts were quantified by insulin radioimmunoassay with the Coat-A-Count kit (DPC, Los Angeles, CA). Insulin Secretion during Perifusion of 832/13 Cells—Cells seeded onto 25-mm glass coverslips placed in 6-well plates were treated with various adenoviruses as described above. Prior to perifusion, 832/13 cells were incubated for 1.5 h in secretion buffer containing 2.5 mm glucose at 37 °C. Two glass coverslips were then loaded into a closed cell perifusion chamber (Warner Instruments, Hamden, CT), and cells were perifused at a flow rate of 1 ml/min using a Minipuls 3 pump (Gilson, Middleton, WI). The temperature was maintained at 37 °C using an in-line solution heater (Warner Instruments). Cells were pre-perifused for 30 min with secretion buffer containing 2.5 mm glucose prior to the sample collection. For studies of secretion in the presence of high K+, the following buffer was used: 84 mm NaCl, 35 mm KCl, 1.2 mm KH2PO4, 1.16 mm MgSO4, 20 mm HEPES, 2.5 mm CaCl2, 0.2% BSA, pH 7.2. Insulin Secretion from Rat Islets—Islets were harvested from male Sprague-Dawley rats weighing ∼250 g as previously described (20Milburn Jr., J.L. Hirose H. Lee Y.H. Nagasawa Y. Ogawa A. Ohneda M.

Once harvested, islets were treated for 20 h with Ad-siPC or Ad-siControl adenoviruses at a dose of 105 plaque-forming units/islet. After removal of virus-containing medium, islets were cultured for an additional 72 h with medium changes every 24 h. GSIS (1 h of incubation at 2.5 mm glucose followed by1hof incubation at 16.7 mm glucose) was measured with 35 islets for each condition. Subsequently, islets were collected, washed with PBS, and lysed for analysis of PC expression by real-time PCR analysis (10 islets/sample) or streptavidin-based protein quantification (30 islets/sample) as described above. Glucose Usage and Glucose Oxidation Measurements—832/13 cells were treated with recombinant adenoviruses, cultured in 12-well plates, and pretreated identically as described for GSIS analysis with the exception that either [5-3H]glucose (specific activity of 0.06 Ci/mol) or [U-14C]glucose (specific activity of 0.2 Ci/mol) was included as tracer for glucose usage and glucose oxidation measurements, respectively. The analyses were performed as previously described (22Hughes S.D. Quaade C. Johnson J.H. Ferber S. Newgard C.B. J. Biol.

Metabolic Profiling of Intracellular Organic Acids and Acylcarnitines—For quantitative gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS)-based analysis of intracellular organic acid levels, virus-treated cells were cultured in 15-cm dishes and incubated for 1.5 h in secretion buffer containing 2.5 mm glucose followed by2hof incubation at either 2.5 or 12 mm glucose. Subsequently, cells were lysed in ice-cold 0.1 m HCl containing internal standards (2H3-lactate; (C/D/N Isotopes, Pointe-Claire, Quebec), 13C3-pyruvate (Aldrich), 2H4-succinate (Aldrich), 2H2-fumarate (C/D/N Isotopes), 13C1-malate (IsoTec; St. Louis, MO), 2H6-α-ketoglutarate (IsoTec), and 2H4-citrate (IsoTec)). Cell remnants were scraped and collected, and pH of the cleared cell extract was adjusted to 8-9 with KOH. Ethoxyamine (Acros Organic, Belgium) was added, and the mixture was incubated at room temperature for 30 min to complete ethoxymation of ketoacids. Next, pH was adjusted to 1-2 with HCl, 50 mg of NaCl was added, and samples were vortexed and extracted twice with ethyl acetate (VWR, West Chester, PA). Upper phases containing the organic acids were combined and subsequently dried under nitrogen. 4 μl of pyridine and 50 μl of N,O-Bis(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide were added, and the samples were incubated at 90 °C for 30 min. The trimethylsilyl derivatives were separated by gas chromatography on a Thermo Finnigan Trace GC Ultra and quantified by selected ion monitoring on a Thermo Finnigan Trace DSQ using stable isotope dilution. For measurement of acylcarnitine levels, 832/13 cells were seeded in 12-well plates, treated with recombinant adenoviruses, and cultured for 72 h. 24 h before harvesting, l-carnitine (inner salt) was added to the growth medium to a final concentration of 1 mm. Cells were washed three times with cold PBS, quick frozen on the plate, and sonicated in H2O on ice. Subsequently, samples were centrifuged for 5 min at 12,000 × g, and the supernatant was analyzed using a previously described tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS)-based technique (24An J. Muoio D.M. Shiota M. Fujimoto Y. Cline G.W. Shulman G.I. Koves T.R. Stevens R. Millington D. Newgard C.B. Nat. Med. 2004; 10: 268-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). 13C NMR-based Pyruvate Cycling Measurements—For studies of pyruvate cycling flux, confluent, virus-treated cells cultured in 15-cm dishes were preincubated in the presence of 2.5 mm glucose for 1 h, followed by incubation in secretion buffer containing 2.5 or 12 mm [U-13C]glucose (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Cambridge, MA) for 4 h. Cells were washed once with cold PBS and extracted with cold 3.5% perchloric acid. Extracts from three dishes/condition were pooled, neutralized, and lyophilized prior to 13C NMR analysis. The principle in the method is that by analyzing the 13C-isotopomer pattern of glutamate a direct measure of pyruvate cycling (PC-mediated pyruvate exchange with tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates) relative to tricarboxylic acid cycle flux can be obtained (5Lu D. Mulder H. Zhao P. Burgess S.C. Jensen M.V. Kamzolova S. Newgard C.B. Sherry A.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 2708-2713Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). In short, lyophilized samples were dissolved in 2H2O, and proton-decoupled 13C NMR spectra were recorded on a 600-MHz 14T Varian INOVA NMR spectrometer using a 45° pulse and a 3-s repetition time in a 5-mm tunable broadband probe. The areas of the multiplets arising from 13Cto 13C spin-spin coupling in the glutamate C2, C3, and C4 resonances were determined using the line-fitting routine in the NMR program NUTS (Acorn NMR, Fremont, CA), and 13C-isotopomer analysis was performed with tcaCALC (5Lu D. Mulder H. Zhao P. Burgess S.C. Jensen M.V. Kamzolova S. Newgard C.B. Sherry A.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 2708-2713Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). NADPH and NADP Analyses—Levels of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphates were measured in Ad-siControl and Ad-siPC-treated cells using an enzymatic cycling method adapted from Passonneau and Lowry (25Passonneau J.V. Lowry O.H. Enzymatic Analysis, a Practical Guide. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ1993: 85-110Crossref Google Scholar). Following GSIS, virus-treated cells cultured in 6-well plates were scraped, centrifuged for 10 s at 10,000 × g, 4 °C, and cell pellets were frozen in a dry ice/ethanol bath. Cells were thawed on ice, resuspended in 40 mm NaOH/5 mm cysteine, sonicated for 10 s, and recentrifuged for 1 min at 10,000 × g at 4 °C. Each sample was divided into three, and 0.3 m HCl (NADPH is destroyed at low pH), 40 mm NaOH/5 mm cysteine (NADP is destroyed at high pH), and H2O were added for NADP, NADPH, and total NADP(H) determinations, respectively. Samples for NADPH and NADP determination were incubated at 60 °C for 15 min, whereas samples for measuring total NADP(H) levels were kept on ice during the incubation time. NADPH standards (0.25-4 μm) were treated in parallel. Subsequently, cycling reagent (50 mm imidazole, 50 mm imidazole-HCl, 5 mm glucose 6-phosphate, 7.5 mm disodium α-ketoglutarate, 0.1 mm ADP, 25 mm ammonium acetate, 0.1% BSA, 1.5 units/ml of Leuconostoc glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, 1.5 units/ml of beef liver glutamic dehydrogenase) was added, and after 3 h of incubation at 37 °C, samples and standards were boiled for 3 min and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min. The amount of 6-phosphogluconolactone was determined by adding indicator reaction buffer (50 mm imidazole, 50 mm imidazole-HCl, 30 mm ammonium acetate, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 300 μm NADP, 0.5 units/ml of Torula yeast gluconate dehydrogenase) to the cycling reactions, and absorbance at 340 nm was read after the kinetic reaction was completed. ATP Determinations—832/13 cells cultured in 6-well plates and treated with either Ad-siControl or Ad-siPC were washed with PBS, scraped, and pelleted by centrifugation at 8,000 × g, 4 °C for 10 s. After a quick freeze in a dry ice/ethanol bath, cell pellets were resuspended by adding 10% (w/v) perchloric acid to the thawed cell pellets. After centrifugation, the supernatants were neutralized with 2 N KOH/0.5 m triethanolamine. Aliquots of each deproteinized sample were assayed for ATP with Luciferase kit (Sigma) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Statistics—Data were expressed as the mean ± S.E. of at least three independent experiments performed in triplicate. Statistical significance was determined using a two-tailed Student's t test, assuming equal variances. p < 0.05 was considered as significant. Suppression of PC Expression with siRNA Duplexes—We have reported previously that GSIS is tightly correlated with PC-catalyzed anaplerotic influx into the tricarboxylic acid cycle and further participation of OXA in various pyruvate cycling pathways (5Lu D. Mulder H. Zhao P. Burgess S.C. Jensen M.V. Kamzolova S. Newgard C.B. Sherry A.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 2708-2713Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 8Boucher A. Lu D.

Newgard C.B. Jensen M.V. Diabetes. 2005; 54: A423Google Scholar). To directly test the impact of PC-catalyzed anaplerosis on GSIS, we designed multiple siRNA duplexes specific for the rat PC mRNA sequence. When introduced into the INS-1-derived cell line 832/13 by nucleofection, one of the siRNA duplexes had no significant effect on PC mRNA levels (siPC1), whereas two other duplexes (siPC2 and siPC3) suppressed PC mRNA levels by 88 ± 1% and 86 ± 1%, respectively (Fig. 1). Combined treatment with duplexes siPC2 and siPC3 had no additional effect on PC expression. Surprisingly, none of the duplexes had any effect on GSIS compared with cells transfected with a nonspecific siRNA sequence (siControl). Similar results were obtained in an independent, robustly glucose-responsive cell line, 832/3 (data not shown). To further investigate the role of PC in GSIS, we constructed recombinant adenoviruses containing the siPC2 (Ad-siPC) or the siControl (Ad-siControl) sequence. 832/13 cells were treated with two different doses of Ad-siPC resulting in 73 ± 3% (Ad-siPC, low) and 83 ± 1% (Ad-siPC, high) decreases in PC mRNA levels, respectively, compared with cells treated with Ad-siControl (Fig. 2A; p < 0.001). To estimate the corresponding reduction in PC protein, we performed streptavidin-based immunoblot analysis, taking advantage of the biotin binding ability of PC (26MacDonald M.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 319: 128-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2B). This analysis demonstrated decreases in PC protein levels of 40 ± 4% (Ad-siPC, low) and 56 ± 2% (Ad-siPC, high), respectively, compared with Ad-siControl (p < 0.001; Fig. 2C). Effect of PC Silencing on GSIS from 832/13 β-Cells and Rat Islets—Surprisingly, Ad-siPC administration to 832/13 cells and suppression of PC protein to the levels shown in Fig. 2 caused a modest but significant increase in GSIS (Fig. 3A). This effect was largely due to an increase in insulin secretion at stimulatory glucose (from 5459 ± 361 microunits/mg of protein in Ad-siControl-treated cells to 6971 ± 449 microunits/mg of protein and 6943 ± 450 microunits/mg of protein in Ad-siPC, low- and Ad-siPC, high-treated cells, respectively (p < 0.001). The enhancement of insulin secretion at stimulatory glucose was not explained by changes in insulin content (35 ± 2 microunits/mg of protein for Ad-siControl versus 35 ± 2 microunits/mg of protein and 39 ± 3 microunits/mg of protein for Ad-siPC, low (p = 0.98) and Ad-siPC, high (p = 0.25), respectively). We next investigated whether PC manipulation affected the dynamics of insulin secretion in cell perifusion studies. Given the very similar effects of the high and low doses of Ad-siPC on GSIS in the static incubation experiments shown in Fig. 3A, these and all subsequent experiments were performed only with the high viral dose, which caused an average decrease in PC protein of 56 ± 2%. As shown in Fig. 3B, the minute-to-minute insulin output from cells with lower PC expression was similar to the secretion profile for the Ad-siControl cells, both in response to glucose alone and when stimulatory glucose was accompanied by 35 mm K+. Subsequently, we used Ad-siPC to suppress PC expression in rat islets. We obtained a 64 ± 3% knockdown of PC mRNA levels (p < 0.001) with Ad-siPC treatment, translating into a 35 ± 5% reduction in PC protein (p < 0.001) compared with islets treated with Ad-siControl (data not shown). In seven independent experiments, this manipulation had no effect on insulin secretion at either basal (23 ± 4 microunits/35 islet/h for Ad-siPC versus 28 ± 8 microunits/35 islet/h for Ad-siControl, p = 0.4) or stimulatory glucose levels (124 ± 11 microunits/35 islet/h, Ad-siPC versus 121 ± 11 microunits/35 islet/h, Ad-siControl; p = 0.8; Fig. 3C). Decreased PC Expression Does Not Affect Pyruvate Levels, Glucose Usage, or Glucose Oxidation but Increases Intracellular Lactate Levels—Pyruvate has multiple potential metabolic fates in β-cells, including entry into pyruvate cycling pathways via PC, conversion to lactate, or entry into the tricarboxylic acid cycle for oxidation via pyruvate dehydrogenase. To investigate the impact of Ad-siPC treatment on these various pathways, we measured glucose usage and glucose oxidation as well as the intracellular levels of pyruvate and lactate in 832/13 cells. As expected, Ad-siControl-treated cells exhibited significant increases in glucose usage (Fig. 4A) and oxidation (Fig. 4B) as glucose concentration was raised from 2.5 to 12 mm (p < 0.001). Flux through these pathways was unaffected by Ad-siPC treatment at basal or stimulatory glucose (p > 0.4, three independent experiments). Measurement of intracellular lactate and pyruva"

These tissue kallikreins are expressed in a wide range of tissues including the central nervous system, the salivary gland, and endocrine-regulated tissues, such as prostate, breast, or testis, and may have diverse physiological functions. For several tissue kallikreins, a clear correlation has been established between expression and different types of cancer. For example, the prostate-specific antigen (PSA or hK3) serves as tumor marker and is used to monitor therapy response. Using a novel strategy, we have cloned, expressed in Escherichia coli or in insect cells, refolded, activated, and purified the seven human tissue kallikreins hK3/PSA, hK4, hK5, hK6, hK7, hK10, and hK11. Moreover, we have determined their extended substrate specificity for the nonprime side using a positional scanning combinatorial library of tetrapeptide substrates. hK3/PSA and hK7 exhibited a chymotrypsin-like specificity preferring large hydrophobic or polar residues at the P1 position. In contrast, hK4, hK5, and less stringent hK6 displayed a trypsin-like specificity with strong preference for P1-Arg, whereas hK10 and hK11 showed an ambivalent specificity, accepting both basic and large aliphatic P1 residues. The extended substrate specificity profiles are in good agreement with known substrate cleavage sites but also in accord with experimentally solved (hK4, hK6, and hK7) or modeled structures. The specificity profiles may lead to a better understanding of human tissue kallikrein functions and assist in identifying their physiological protein substrates as well as in designing more selective inhibitors.

Biochem. 2003; 36: 443-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) as well as in the endocrine-regulated tissues testis, prostate, and breast, whereas hK2 and hK3 are only expressed in the prostate. For example, hK6 has been found in glandular epithelia of breast, prostate, endometrium, colon, and pancreas and in the central nervous system as well as in milk and cerebrospinal fluid (9Yousef G.M. Diamandis E.P. Biol. Chem. 2002; 383: 1045-1057Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). This expression in a wide range of tissues suggests involvement in a variety of physiological and pathological processes (12Clements J.A. Willemsen N.M. Myers S.A. Dong Y. Crit. Rev. Clin. Lab. Sci. 2004; 41: 265-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Unfortunately, only for a few tissue kallikreins a distinct biological function has yet been established. For example, hK1 plays a role in blood pressure regulation, exerting its biological activity mainly via release of the vasoactive kinin Lys-bradykinin (kallidin) from low molecular weight kininogen, but is also implicated in various other physiological processes (13Bhoola K.D. Figueroa C.D. Worthy K. Pharmacol.

Several tissue kallikreins are differentially expressed in hormone-dependent prostate, ovarian, and breast cancers, rendering them useful diagnostic and prognostic markers for these diseases (11Borgono C.A. Diamandis E.P. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2004; 4: 876-890Crossref PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar). hK3/PSA is widely used as a tumor marker for prostate cancer screening, diagnosis, and for monitoring therapy response (23Denmeade S.R. Sokoll L.J. Chan D.W. Khan S.R. Isaacs J.T. Prostate. 2001; 48: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Some of the more recently discovered tissue kallikreins are clear indicators of poor or favorable prognosis (24Yousef G.M. Diamandis E.P. Tumour Biol. 2002; 23: 185-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) for ovarian, breast, prostate, and testicular cancers so that in the future they might become useful clinical biomarkers (25Obiezu C.V. Diamandis E.P. Cancer Lett. 2005; 224: 1-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Data are accumulating that some of these tissue kallikreins are also implicated in other human diseases, such as hK1 in inflammation and hypertension, hK4 in dental diseases (26Hart P.S. Hart T.C. Michalec M.D. Ryu O.H. Simmons D. Hong S. Wright J.T. J. Med. Genet. 2004; 41: 545-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar), hK6 and hK8 in central nervous system inflammatory diseases (27Blaber S.I. Ciric B. Christophi G.P. Bernett M.J. Blaber M.

Therefore, these tissue kallikreins might be valuable therapeutic targets, and modulation of their proteolytic activity by selective inhibitors may prevent development or progression of diseases (29Yousef G.M. Diamandis E.P. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2003; 90: 7-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar).The tissue kallikreins are synthesized as inactive pre-pro-enzymes, secreted as inactive zymogens, and activated autocatalytically or by other proteinases including tissue kallikreins in novel cascade-like activation pathways (9Yousef G.M. Diamandis E.P. Biol. Chem. 2002; 383: 1045-1057Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The majority of these tissue kallikreins exhibit a preference for basic P1 residues, whereas some tissue kallikreins cleave in a more chymotrypsin-like manner. In all tissue kallikreins, the substrate specificity additionally depends on the amino acids located more distant from the scissile peptide bond (30Brillard-Bourdet M. Moreau T. Gauthier F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1246: 47-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 31Pimenta D. Melo R.L. Caliendo G. Santagada V. Fiorino F. Severino B. de Nucci G. Juliano L. Juliano M.A. Biol.

Several potential protein substrates have been identified in vitro. Further physiological substrates might be derived from the substrate cleavage preference presented in our work.A full understanding of the functional properties of the tissue kallikreins requires knowledge of both their three-dimensional structures and their extended substrate specificity.

To learn more about the molecular properties of these tissue kallikreins, to gain more insights into the mechanisms whereby these tissue kallikreins contribute to cancer growth, and to offer a basis for rational drug design for developing selective inhibitors, we sought to characterize a number of tissue kallikreins by expressing their active species and determining their non-prime specificity using peptide positional-scanning methods.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCloning, Expression, and Purification—On the basis of the known coding sequences of the human tissue kallikreins (Table 1), appropriate PCR primers were designed and synthesized (Medigenomix GmbH). The full-length tissue kallikrein cDNAs were isolated in our laboratory from ovarian and breast cancer tissue or in the case of PSA from prostate cancer cells. The cDNAs were used as PCR templates for amplification of the DNAs coding for the mature tissue kallikrein domains. All enzymes used for recombinant DNA techniques, PCR, and DNA isolation kits were purchased from New England Biolabs and Qiagen. For hK3, -4, -6, -7, -10, and -11, the chosen constructs coding for a MRGSH6GS sequence at the N terminus followed by an Asp4-Lys enterokinase (EK) recognition site as a linker to the respective mature tissue kallikrein were cloned into the bacterial expression vector pQE30 (Qiagen). Escherichia coli M15(pREP4) cells (Qiagen) were transformed with the resulting expression vectors. After induction with 1 mm isopropyl-β-thiogalactoside, the constructs were expressed in 2×TY medium, yielding inclusion bodies. The expressed His6-tagged proteins were purified on a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-Sepharose column (Amersham Biosciences), washed by stepwise reducing the pH from 8.0 to 4.5, and eluted with 8 m urea, 100 mm NaH2PO4, 10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 4.0. The tissue kallikrein constructs were incubated with 10 mm dithiothreitol overnight at 25 °C, and dialyzed for 12 h against the 100-fold volume of 4 m urea, 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, and 0.005% Tween 20. For example, the refolding of hK4 was performed in 2 m urea, 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm reduced glutathione, 0.5 mm oxidized glutathione (GSH to GSSG ratio 1:10), 2 mm CaCl2, 0.002% NaN3, 0.005% Tween 20, pH 8.0, in the 100-fold volume of the sample at 4 °C for 40 h and subsequently in the 100-fold sample volume of the same buffer containing 1 m urea at 4 °C for 24 h. Finally, the refolding buffer was exchanged twice with 100 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris/HCl, 0.002% NaN3 at pH 8.0 with 24-h incubation periods. The folded proteins were concentrated to the desired volume using Amicon cells with 10-kDa cut-off membranes (Millipore).Before activity measurements, the N-terminal His6 tag was cleaved off at the recognition sequence with enterokinase (Sigma), whereby 0.0016 units of EK cleaved 25 μg recombinant hKs (per 100-125 μl) to 95% completion in 30 h at 37 °C in buffer containing 100 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 0.005% Tween 20 in total volumes of 10-15 ml. EK was removed from the reaction mixture with the EK antibody capture kit (Sigma), and the completeness of the activation reaction was evaluated by SDS-PAGE and N-terminal sequencing. The tissue kallikrein samples were further purified by benzamidine-Sepharose (hK4, hK5, hK6, hK10, hK11) and BPTI-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) chromatography (hK3 and hK7). After washing the column with 300 mm NaCl, 0.005% Tween 20, and 10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, the active tissue kallikreins were eluted with 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm para-aminobenzamidine, 0.005% Tween 20, and 10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0. The purified tissue kallikreins were concentrated to ∼20 mg/ml in Amicon Centricon microconcentrators at 4 °C. This procedure allowed the high yield expression of carbohydrate-free samples in E. coli, their rapid isolation, efficient screening of individual refolding conditions, specific activation, and the isolation of seven different mature tissue kallikreins in high yields. Monomeric fractions of these tissue kallikrein species were obtained by final gel filtration. For the screening experiments described below, the stored precursors were activated and isolated immediately before usage. The purified tissue kallikreins were found by SDS-PAGE, ultracentrifugation, and mass spectrometry to be more than 95% pure (Fig. 2).FIGURE 2Coomassie-stained SDS gels of recombinant tissue kallikreins during expression and purification.

Enzymatically active hK5 was purified by repeated chromatography on heparin-Sepharose, and the active concentration of hK5 was established by titration with standardized soybean trypsin inhibitor to be about 90% that based on UV absorbance at 280 nm.Enzymatic Activity Assays—The concentrations of the individual tissue kallikrein samples were measured by absorbance at 280 nm and calculated extinction coefficients (47Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H.

Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 2411-2423Crossref PubMed Scopus (3400) Google Scholar). The enzymatic activity of these tissue kallikrein samples were checked with the fluorogenic 7-amino-4-methylcoumarine substrates (AMCs) succinyl-AAPF-AMC for hK3 and hK7 and benzyloxycarbonyl-LR-AMC and benzyloxycarbonyl-FR-AMC for hK4, hK5, hK6, hK7, hK10, and hK11 in buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 0.005% Tween 20 and 1% Me2SO (from the substrate stock solution) at 25 °C by monitoring the initial velocity of the AMC release recorded at excitation and emission wavelengths of 380 and 460 nm with a PerkinElmer Life Sciences LS50B Luminescence spectrofluorimeter. For these enzyme assays final substrate and enzyme concentrations of 250 μm and 10-20 nm were employed.Positional Scanning with a Synthetic Combinatorial Peptide Library (PS-SCL)—The diverse PS-SCL with the general molecular structure acetyl-P4-P3-P2-P1-7-amino-4-carbamoyl-methylcoumarin consists of 20 P1-, 20 P2-, 20 P3-, and 20 P4-libraries in which the corresponding P1, P2, P3, or P4 position is fixed and occupied by one of the 20 canonical amino acids (omitting cysteine and including norleucine), whereas the three remaining positions contain an equimolar mixture of these amino acids (Fig. 3) (49Choe Y. Leonetti F. Greenbaum D.C. Lecaille F. Bogyo M. Bromme D. Ellman J.A. Craik C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 12824-12832Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Therefore, each of the P1-P4 libraries comprised 20 sublibraries containing a mixture of 8000 different fluorogenic tetrapeptide substrates. The final enzyme concentration of the activated tissue kallikreins was 5-15 nm, and the final concentration for each of the 8000 compounds per well was 31.25 nm in a 100 μl total reaction volume. Triplicate samples were assayed at 25 °C with a buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 0.005% Tween 20, and 1% Me2SO (from the substrate stock solutions). All library assays were performed in 96-well Microfluor-1 Black “U” bottom plates (Dynex Technologies, Chantilly, VA) on a SpectraMax Gemini fluorescence spectrometer (Molecular Devices) with excitation, emission, and cut-off wavelengths of 380, 460, and 435 nm, respectively for 10 min.FIGURE 3Extended substrate specificity of seven human tissue kallikreins.

To produce six of the seven active tissue kallikrein species studied in this paper, we prepared chimeric constructs coding for the respective catalytic domain preceded by a His6 tag linked to an accessible EK cleavage site. These constructs in combination with standardized procedures allowed the expression in E. coli, efficient refolding and isolation, activation, and high yield production of six carbohydrate-free mature tissue kallikreins. Because of problems with the bacterial preparation, hK5 was expressed in insect cells (46Schechter N.M. Choi E.J. Wang Z.M. Hanakawa Y. Stanley J.R. Kang Y. Clayman G.L. Jayakumar A. Biol.

Receptor-bound non-visual arrestins interact with numerous partners, redirecting signaling to alternative pathways. Arrestins also have nuclear localization and nuclear exclusion signals and shuttle between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. Constitutively shuttling proteins often redistribute their interaction partners between the two compartments. Here we took advantage of the nucleoplasmic shuttling of free arrestins and used a “nuclear exclusion assay” to study their interactions with two proteins involved in “life-and-death” decisions in the cell, the kinase JNK3 and the ubiquitin ligase Mdm2. In human embryonic kidney 293 cells green fluorescent protein (GFP)-JNK3 and GFP-Mdm2 predominantly localize in the nucleus, whereas visual arrestin, arrestin2(Q394L) mutant equipped with the nuclear exclusion signal, and arrestin3 localize exclusively to the cytoplasm. Coexpression of arrestins moves both GFP-JNK3 and GFP-Mdm2 to the cytoplasm. Arrestin mutants “frozen” in the basal conformation are the most efficacious. Thus, arrestins in their basal state interact with JNK3 and Mdm2, suggesting that arrestins are likely “preloaded” with their interaction partners when they bind the receptor. Robust interaction of free arrestins with JNK3 and Mdm2 and their ability to regulate subcellular localization of these proteins may play an important role in the survival of photoreceptors and other neurons, as well as in retinal and neuronal degeneration.

This must be a function of free arrestin, because membrane-imbedded GPCRs are not transported through the aqueous nuclear pore. Here we used the ability of arrestin proteins to bring their binding partners out of the nucleus as a readout to study the interactions of free arrestins 2 and 3 and visual arrestin with JNK3 and Mdm2, two proteins that play a pivotal role in the regulation of cell death and survival. We found that all three arrestins interact with JNK3 and Mdm2 and dramatically change their subcellular localization. Comparison of wild-type arrestins, “constitutively active” forms, and mutants frozen in the basal state shows that both JNK3 and Mdm2 bind arrestins in their basal state and Mdm2 actually prefers the inactive conformation.

Cell Culture and Transient Transfection—HEK-293A were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), penicillin, and streptomycin at 37 °C in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2. The cells were plated at 80-90% confluence and transfected using Lipofectamine2000 (Invitrogen). The next day, the cells were trypsinized and seeded onto Lab-Tek CC2-treated chambered slides coated with fibronectin (20 μg/ml of phosphate-buffered saline) (Sigma) for immunofluorescence microscopy and onto 24-well plates coated with poly-d-lysine (15 μg/ml) for Western blot analysis. Animals—Animal research was conducted in compliance with the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and approved by the institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. The retinas of C57 mice and the brain sections of Sprague-Dawley rats were used. Immunohistochemistry and Immunocytochemistry—The subcellular localization of endogenous visual arrestin in dark-adapted mouse retinas was determined as described (19Nair K.S. Hanson S.M. Mendez A.

Rats were anesthetized with pentobarbital (50 mg/kg intraperitoneal) and transcardially perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde. Brains were removed, postfixed in the paraformaldehyde solution overnight at 4 °C, cryoprotected in 30% sucrose overnight at 4 °C, frozen on dry ice, and kept at -80 °C until used. 30-μm-thick free-floating sections of the brain were incubated with rabbit polyclonal antibody specific for arrestin2 (3Gurevich E.V.

Both primary antibodies were used in 1:500 dilution overnight at 4 °C, followed by anti-rabbit biotinylated antibodies and Alexa-488-conjugated streptavidin. Sections were photographed on a Nikon EC2000 fluorescent microscope equipped with a digital camera. HEK 293A cells were fixed 72 h post-transfection in 100% methanol at -20 °C for 5 min. The cells were rehydrated with phosphate-buffered saline and blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline for 1 h at room temperature. Untagged and FLAG-tagged arrestins were visualized with F4C1 anti-arrestin (20Donoso L.A. Gregerson D.S. Smith L. Robertson S. Knospe V. Vrabec T. Kalsow C.M. Curr. Eye Res. 1990; 9: 343-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) and M2 anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma), respectively, followed by the anti-mouse secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Nuclear Exclusion Assay—GFP-JNK3 and the human homolog of Mdm2-GFP were transfected alone (control) or in combination with different arrestins. Where indicated, the cells were treated with 50 ng/ml of leptomycin B (LMB) for 14 h to inactivate exportin1. The effect of LMB after 2, 4, and 14 h was essentially the same (not shown). Cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min at 4 °C. The slides were air dried and mounted with the mounting medium (Vector Laboratories) containing 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole to visualize the nuclei. The GFP-JNK3 and GFP-Mdm2 were visualized using an epifluorescence microscope equipped with a CCD camera. Experiments were performed three to five times. In each experiment the distribution of JNK3, Mdm2, and/or arrestin in at least 20 cells was scored (nucleus >cytoplasm; nucleus = cytoplasm; nucleus <cytoplasm). Where appropriate, the scores were first analyzed by two-way analysis of variance with arrestin and expression level as main factors. Where the effects of both main factors and the interaction between factors were significant, post-hoc comparison of means with Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons was used. Quantitative Western Blot—In each experiment an aliquot of cells after each transfection was grown and dissolved in lysis solution (Ambion, Austin, TX). Total protein was measured by Bio-Rad assay. Protein was methanol precipitated, resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE, and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA). Arrestin was visualized with F4C1 mouse monoclonal antibodies (20Donoso L.A. Gregerson D.S. Smith L. Robertson S. Knospe V. Vrabec T. Kalsow C.M. Curr. Eye Res. 1990; 9: 343-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Aliquots of the corresponding purified proteins were run alongside samples to construct the calibration curves for quantification. Subcellular Localization of Endogenous Arrestins in Native Tissues—Subcellular distribution of endogenous arrestins in native tissues has not been studied. Therefore, we analyzed the localization of the two arrestins, visual (19Nair K.S. Hanson S.M. Mendez A. Gurevich E.V. Kennedy M.J. Shestopalov V.I. Vishnivetskiy S.A. Chen J. Hurley J.B. Gurevich V.V. Slepak V.Z. Neuron. 2005; 46Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) and arrestin2 (4Gurevich E.V. Benovic J.L. Gurevich V.V. J. Neurochem. 2004; 91: 1404-1416Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), for which subtype-specific antibodies suitable for immunohistochemistry are available. Non-visual arrestins 2 and 3 are expressed in all brain regions (3Gurevich E.V. Benovic J.L. Gurevich V.V. Neuroscience. 2002; 109: 421-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Arrestin2 predominates in mature neurons, where its concentration exceeds that of arrestin3 ∼10-20-fold (4Gurevich E.V. Benovic J.L. Gurevich V.V. J. Neurochem. 2004; 91: 1404-1416Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Although arrestin2 is present in both the nuclei and cytoplasm in all types of neurons (Fig. 1), its relative distribution between these two compartments varies. For example, in cortical pyramidal neurons, particularly in layers III and V, the concentration of arrestin2 in the nucleus exceeds that in the cytoplasm (Fig. 1, A and B). Conversely, in striatal medium spiny neurons arrestin2 is predominantly cytoplasmic (Fig. 1, C and D). In other types of neuronal cells (the globus pallidus, nucleus of the diagonal band, and a number of other structures), arrestin2 is evenly distributed between the nucleus and the cytoplasm (not shown). The arrestin2 protein is small enough to passively move through the nuclear pore. Therefore, its preferential localization in the nucleus or the cytoplasm suggests that there are cell type-specific mechanisms that keep arrestin2 in one of these compartments. The localization of visual arrestin in rod photoreceptors is light dependent (19Nair K.S. Hanson S.M. Mendez A. Gurevich E.V. Kennedy M.J. Shestopalov V.I. Vishnivetskiy S.A. Chen J. Hurley J.B. Gurevich V.V. Slepak V.Z. Neuron. 2005; 46Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). In the light, it concentrates in the outer segments, whereas in the dark it is mostly sequestered in the inner segments and cell bodies (Fig. 1E). Visual arrestin is completely excluded from the nuclei even though it is clearly present in the perinuclear cytoplasm (Fig. 1, F and G). Because the size of visual arrestin is not large enough to prevent its passive entrance via the nuclear pore (21Weis K. Cell. 2003; 112: 441-451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar), it must be actively exported from the nucleus. Subcellular Localization of Visual and Arrestins 2 and 3 in HEK293 Cells—Next we tested the localization of the three arrestins expressed in HEK293 cells. Wild-type (WT) arrestin3 is localized virtually exclusively in the cytoplasm, whereas visual arrestin and arrestin2 demonstrate predominantly cytoplasmic localization with a small proportion in the nucleus (Fig. 2). Thus, arrestin2 distribution in HEK293 cells is similar to its distribution in striatal neurons (Fig. 1, C and D). The localization of arrestins 2 and 3 that have a small FLAG tag (which does not considerably change their size) matches the localization of the native proteins (Fig. 2). Thus, the distribution of arrestins between the nucleus and the cytoplasm of HEK cells recapitulates their distribution in neurons that naturally express these proteins. The addition of a large (∼20 kDa) GFP tag slightly increases the nuclear content of visual arrestin and arrestin3 but does not appreciably change the distribution of arrestin2 (Fig. 2). A protein could be excluded from the nucleus for two reasons: it either does not enter because it is too large to diffuse via the nuclear pore and does not have a nuclear localization signal to gain entry via a controlled import mechanism, or it may enter and be actively exported if it is equipped with a nuclear export signal (NES). The size of the native and FLAG-tagged arrestins is not large enough to preclude their passive entry, whereas GFP-tagged arrestins are larger than 65 kDa, so that they can only enter and exit using the nuclear import/export machinery (21Weis K. Cell. 2003; 112: 441-451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar). To test the mechanisms responsible for the observed subcellular distribution of arrestin proteins, we used LMB, an inhibitor of a nuclear export receptor, exportin1 (22Ossareh-Nazari B. Bachelerie F. Dargemont C. Science. 1997; 278: 141-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar, 23Fukuda M. Asano S. Nakamura T. Adachi M. Yoshida M. Yanagida M. Nishida E. Nature. 1997; 390: 308-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (1031) Google Scholar). Preincubation of arrestin-expressing cells with 50 ng/ml of LMB notably increases the proportion of visual arrestin and arrestin3 in the nucleus, whereas no appreciable change in arrestin2 distribution (untagged or FLAG tagged) was observed (Fig. 2). The difference in the LMB-induced redistribution becomes much greater when GFP-tagged versions are used; visual arrestin and arrestin3 dramatically relocalize to the nucleus, and the nuclear content of arrestin2-GFP clearly increases (Fig. 2). These data suggest that wild-type arrestin2 is predominantly exported by an LMB-insensitive mechanism, whereas arrestin2-GFP and the other two arrestin subtypes rely on an LMB-sensitive pathway to a greater extent. However, the distribution of all three arrestins suggests that the export of even visual arrestin and arrestin3 out of the nucleus is totally dependent on LMB-sensitive processes only when these proteins are “burdened” with a large 20-kDa GFP tag. Proteins that move out of the nucleus via the exportin1-dependent pathway carry a leucine-rich NES (23Fukuda M. Asano S. Nakamura T. Adachi M. Yoshida M. Yanagida M. Nishida E. Nature. 1997; 390: 308-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (1031) Google Scholar), although a broad spectrum of hydrophobic residues can form a functional NES motif (24Wen W. Meinkoth J.L. Tsien R.Y. Taylor S.S. Cell. 1995; 82: 463-473Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1006) Google Scholar). Only arrestin3 was shown to have a native NES motif localized in its C terminus, which can be destroyed by a single L394Q mutation (NES-) (10Scott M.G. Le Rouzic E. Perianin A. Pierotti V. Enslen H. Benichou S. Marullo S. Benmerah A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37693-37701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 11Wang P. Wu Y. Ge X. Ma L. Pei G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 11648-11653Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), whereas the Q394L mutation in arrestin2 (NES+) is sufficient to create a functional NES (11Wang P. Wu Y. Ge X. Ma L. Pei G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 11648-11653Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). However, the effects of both mutations were only characterized using arrestin-GFP fusions (10Scott M.G. Le Rouzic E. Perianin A. Pierotti V. Enslen H. Benichou S. Marullo S. Benmerah A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37693-37701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 11Wang P. Wu Y. Ge X. Ma L. Pei G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 11648-11653Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), the distribution of which differs from that of wild-type and FLAG-tagged arrestins (Fig. 2). Therefore, we tested the effects of the NES mutations in the context of WT arrestins 2 and 3 (Fig. 3). We found that engineering the NES in the C terminus of arrestin2 does not change its subcellular distribution, whereas inactivation of the native NES in arrestin3 results in arrestin2-like distribution. Both mutants are preferentially localized in the cytoplasm. The effects of LMB on their localization are as small as its effects on the parental WT proteins. Interestingly, in the presence of LMB the nuclear content of NES-less arrestin3 does not change (similar to the naturally NES-less wild-type arrestin2), whereas the nuclear content of NES+ arrestin2 increases to the same extent as that of arrestin3 that has a native NES (Figs. 2, 3). Thus, it appears that both non-visual arrestins can be exported out of the nucleus via LMB-sensitive and -insensitive pathways, suggesting that the presence or absence of an exportin1 binding NES is not a good predictor of their subcellular localization. Arrestin-dependent Relocalization of JNK3—GFP-JNK3 expressed alone in HEK293 cells was found both in the nucleus (excluding the nucleoli) and in the cytoplasm (Fig. 4). Co-expression of wild-type arrestin3 dramatically relocalizes GFP-JNK3 to the cytoplasm (Fig. 4). LMB prevents arrestin3-dependent nuclear exclusion of JNK3 (Fig. 4). Surprisingly, we found that the presumably NES-less arrestin3(L394Q) mutant also induces partial relocalization of GFP-JNK3. This process is also LMB sensitive. These data suggest that either arrestin3 has additional functional NES-like motif(s) or that LMB inhibits some exportin1-independent pathways. Co-expression of wildtype arrestin2 did not affect the localization of GFP-JNK3, whereas NES+ arrestin2 excluded GFP-JNK3 from the nucleus as effectively as arrestin3 (Fig. 4). This effect was completely abolished by LMB, suggesting that the complex of the NES+ arrestin2 mutant with JNK3 exits the nucleus via a different pathway than free NES+ arrestin2, which was not affected by LMB (compare Figs. 3 and 4). Interestingly, co-expression of visual arrestin, which was not suspected of interacting with JNK3, effectively excluded GFP-JNK3 from the nucleus via an LMB-sensitive mechanism (Fig. 4). Visual arrestin does not have a conventional leucine-rich NES in its C terminus, although it has two internal NES-like sequences 203LRLAVSL209 and 278LTLVPLL284 that are exposed in the crystal structure (25Hirsch J.A. Schubert C. Gurevich V.V. Sigler P.B. Cell. 1999; 97: 257-269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). In an attempt to determine whether either of these sequences plays a role in the export of visual arrestin, we constructed two single mutants, L203C and L280A, and a combination mutant L203C/L280A and compared their ability to move JNK3 out of the nucleus to that of WT protein (Fig. 4). We found that neither mutation prevented visual arrestin-dependent nuclear exclusion of JNK3; the mutants with one or both putative NES disabled translocate GFP-JNK3 as effectively as WT. Unexpectedly, we found that in contrast to WT visual arrestin, the ability of the mutants to translocate JNK3 was insensitive to LMB (Fig. 4). Thus, WT visual arrestin (at least in complex with JNK3) is apparently exported via a mechanism involving these NES-like sequences and their elimination redirects it to an alternative export pathway. Collectively, our data demonstrate that all three arrestins interact with JNK3 and that wild-type visual arrestin and arrestin3 dramatically change the subcellular localization of this important signaling molecule. Does JNK3 Binding Depend on Arrestin Conformation?—Ar-restin3 was shown to act as a receptor-regulated scaffold for JNK3 activation (7McDonald P.H. Chow C.W. Miller W.E. Laporte S.A. Field M.E. Lin F.T. Davis R.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Science. 2000; 290: 1515-1518Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These data imply that receptor-bound arrestin in its “active” state interacts with JNK3 (9Gurevich V.V. Gurevich E.V. Structure. 2003; 11: 1037-1042Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). To test whether JNK3 binding depends on arrestin conformation, we took advantage of the availability of functionally (16Gurevich V.V. J. Biol.

The constitutively active forms of arrestins we chose have a triple alanine substitution in the C-tail (3A) that destabilizes its interaction with β-strand I and α-helix I (one of the conserved “clasps” holding arrestin in the basal conformation) (25Hirsch J.A.

The “constitutively inactive” forms of arrestins we used have a sevenresidue deletion in the inter-domain hinge (D7) that leaves it only five residues long, i.e. just enough to cover the distance between the domains in the basal state (25Hirsch J.A.

This deletion “freezes” arrestin in its basal conformation and blocks its ability to bind the receptor (18Vishnivetskiy S.A. Hirsch J.A. Velez M.-G. Gurevich Y.V. Gurevich V.V. J. Biol.

To detect even subtle differences in JNK3 interaction and score only cells that express the respective arrestins, we used FLAG-tagged versions of these mutants in all experiments and visualized arrestin with anti-FLAG primary and “red” secondary antibodies (Fig. 5). We found that both “pre-activated” 3A and constitutively inactive D7 mutants effectively relocalize JNK3.

The surface area is 0.393 square kilometers, the volume is 0.018378 cubic kilometers with a 5% margin of error, and the three axis lengths are 535 meters by 294 meters by 209 meters. The global Itokawa revealed a boomerang-shaped appearance composed of two distinct parts with partly faceted regions and a constricted ring structure."
https://openalex.org/W2168779696,"In this study, we present multiple lines of evidence to support a critical role for heparin-bound EGF (epidermal growth factor)-like growth factor (HB-EGF) and tumor necrosis factor-α-converting enzyme (TACE) (ADAM17) in the transactivation of EGF receptor (EGFR), ERK phosphorylation, and cellular proliferation induced by the 5-HT2A receptor in renal mesangial cells. 5-hydroxy-tryptamine (5-HT) resulted in rapid activation of TACE, HB-EGF shedding, EGFR activation, ERK phosphorylation, and longer term increases in DNA content in mesangial cells. ERK phosphorylation was attenuated by 1) neutralizing EGFR antibodies and the EGFR kinase inhibitor, AG1478, 2) neutralizing HB-EGF, but not amphiregulin, antibodies, heparin, or CM197, and 3) pharmacological inhibitors of matrix-degrading metalloproteinases or TACE small interfering RNA. Exogenously administered HB-EGF stimulated ERK phosphorylation. Additionally, TACE was co-immunoprecipitated with HB-EGF. Small interfering RNA against TACE also blocked 5-HT-induced increases in ERK phosphorylation, HB-EGF shedding, and DNA content. In aggregate, this work supports a pathway map that can be depicted as follows: 5-HT → 5-HT2A receptor → TACE → HB-EGF shedding → EGFR → ERK → increased DNA content. To our knowledge, this is the first time that TACE has been implicated in 5-HT-induced EGFR transactivation or in proliferation induced by a G protein-coupled receptor in native cells in culture.

To our knowledge, this is the first time that TACE has been implicated in 5-HT-induced EGFR transactivation or in proliferation induced by a G protein-coupled receptor in native cells in culture. Cells receive environmental cues through various cell surface receptors, which allow extracellular stimuli to regulate intracellular signaling pathways. Two ubiquitous classes of cell surface receptors are those that couple to G proteins (GPCRs) 2The abbreviations used are: GPCR, G protein-coupled receptor; EGF, epidermal growth factor; EGFR, EGF receptor; HB-EGF, heparin-bound EGF-like growth factor; 5-HT, 5-hydroxy-tryptamine; TGF, transforming growth factor; TACE, tumor necrosis factor-α-converting enzyme; TACEsi, TACE-silenced cells; Csi, control-silenced cells; siRNA, small interfering RNA; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; RTK, receptor tyrosine kinase; MMP, matrix metalloproteinase; PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; HBSS, Hanks' balanced salt solution; HSPG, heparan sulfate proteoglycan. and those that possess intrinsic receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) activity. Despite the importance of these two classes of receptors, our knowledge of how they coordinate cellular signals is incomplete. Previously, signals generated by RTKs and GPCRs were thought to be cleanly compartmentalized, with little or no cross-talk between the signaling pathways. However, recently, the lines of distinction between signaling pathways used by GPCRs and RTKs have become less definite. There is a new awareness that RTKs such as the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor (EGFR) and GPCRs possess significant potential for cross-talk during signal initiation and propagation. Cross-talk can take the form of shared signaling pathways (1van Biesen T. Hawes B.E. Raymond J.R. Luttrell L.M. Koch W.J. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1266-1269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar), or for GPCRs, using the RTKs as signaling platforms (2Daub H. Weiss F.U. Wallasch C. Ullrich A. Nature. 1996; 379: 557-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (1329) Google Scholar, 3Murasawa S. Mori Y. Nozawa Y. Gotoh N. Shibuya M. Masaki H. Maruyama K. Tsutsumi Y. Moriguchi Y. Shibazaki Y. Tanaka Y.

Nature. 1999; 402: 884-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (1501) Google Scholar). Thus, contrary to relatively recent dogma, it is now quite clear that RTKs and GPCRs engage in extensive cross-talk with each other. Receptor transactivation or inter-receptor cross-talk can involve complex mechanisms such as in the case of GPCR-induced EGFR transactivation. In that regard, some aspects of the molecular mechanisms of GPCR-induced transactivation of RTKs have recently been elucidated. Current studies have highlighted the potential importance of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and members of the ADAM (cell surface enzymes that contain adisintegrin and metalloprotease domain) family, especially ADAM-9, -10, -12, and -17, in GPCR-induced transactivation of the EGFR (5Blobel C.P. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 32-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (928) Google Scholar). Recent work supports the concept that ADAMs and MMPs process cell surface-bound growth factors such as heparin-bound EGF-like growth factor (HB-EGF), amphiregulin, or TGFα, releasing them from cell surface “tethers,” thus providing ligands for the EGFR (6Schlondorff J. Blobel C.P. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 3603-3617Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Black R.A. Rauch C.T. Kozlosky C.J. Peschon J.J. Slack J.L. Wolfson M.F. Castner B.J. Stocking K.L. Reddy P.

Nature. 1997; 385: 729-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (2728) Google Scholar). Many details of GPCR-induced activation of these enzymes and the release of their substrates remain undefined, at least partially because there are cell type- and GPCR-specific variables of the transactivation process (8Schafer B. Gschwind A. Ullrich A. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 991-999Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 9Schafer B. Marg B. Gschwind A. Ullrich A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 47929-47938Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). ADAMs comprise a relatively new family of membrane-bound cell surface proteins that participate in diverse functions such as fertilization, development, and cellular proteolytic activities such as ectodomain shedding (10Wolfsberg T.G. White J.M. Dev. Biol. 1996; 180: 389-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 11Blobel C.P. Cell. 1997; 90: 589-592Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Like many other proteins, ADAMs are composed of distinct modules (7Black R.A. Rauch C.T. Kozlosky C.J. Peschon J.J. Slack J.L. Wolfson M.F. Castner B.J. Stocking K.L. Reddy P. Srinivasan S. Nelson N. Boiani N. Schooley K.A. Gerhart M. Davis R. Fitzner J.N. Johnson R.S. Paxton R.J. March C.J. Cerretti D.P. Nature. 1997; 385: 729-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (2728) Google Scholar, 12Moss M.L. Jin S.L.

ADAMs have an amino-terminal “pro” module that maintains the adjacent protease-like module in an inactive conformation. The pro region can be cleaved from the protease module via the actions of furin. The ADAM proteins also contain (moving from amino to carboxyl terminus) a disintegrin module, a cysteine-rich region, EGF repeats, a transmembrane region, and a cytoplasmic domain (7Black R.A. Rauch C.T. Kozlosky C.J. Peschon J.J. Slack J.L. Wolfson M.F. Castner B.J. Stocking K.L. Reddy P. Srinivasan S. Nelson N. Boiani N. Schooley K.A. Gerhart M. Davis R. Fitzner J.N. Johnson R.S.

Willard D. Becherer J.D. Nature. 1997; 385: 733-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (1490) Google Scholar). There are currently at least 23 members of this family of proteins, but the potential candidates for the pro-HB-EGF protease can be narrowed down relatively easily. For example, only about half (ADAM-1, -8, -9, -10, -12, -13, -15, -16, -17, -19, and -20) actually contain a functional proteolytic site (HEXGHXXGXXHD) (10Wolfsberg T.G. White J.M. Dev. Biol. 1996; 180: 389-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Of those, many have very restricted tissue distributions or have been identified only in non-mammalian species. Only a few ADAMs (1van Biesen T. Hawes B.E. Raymond J.R. Luttrell L.M. Koch W.J. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1266-1269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 9Schafer B. Marg B. Gschwind A. Ullrich A. J. Biol.

To this point, there have been few organized attempts to dissect the role of specific ADAMs in the cross-talk between GPCRs and EGFR in native tissues or non-transformed cells. In that regard, one group of investigators showed that different ADAM enzymes and various EGF-like growth factors can contribute to transactivation depending upon the cell system used. For example, lysophosphatidic acid induces EGFR activation through ADAM-15 and amphiregulin or TGFα (13Gschwind A. Hart S. Fischer O.M. Ullrich A. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2411-2421Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar), whereas ADAM-17 and HB-EGF appear to be necessary for the crosstalk between the angiotensin-II AT1 receptor and EGFR in kidney tumor cells and in Cos7 cells (9Schafer B. Marg B. Gschwind A. Ullrich A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 47929-47938Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Because most of the previous studies were carried out in transformed cell lines, our aim in the present study was to investigate the cross-talk between an endogenous GPCR, namely the 5-HT2A receptor, and EGFR, with particular emphasis on the involvement of endogenous ADAM enzymes and EGF-like growth factors in a more physiological environment using mesangial cells as our model system. Our laboratory previously showed that the 5-HT2A receptor transactivates EGFR via protein kinase C in mesangial cells, although the specific pathway of transactivation was not characterized (14Greene E.L. Houghton O. Collinsworth G. Garnovskaya M.N. Nagai T. Sajjad T. Bheemanathini V. Grewal J.S. Paul R.V. Raymond J.R. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: F650-F658Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Glomerular mesangial cells, which have a combined smooth muscle and fibroblast-like phenotype, play important roles under physiological and pathophysiological conditions in regulating glomerular extracellular matrix. Because mesangial cells reside in a confined environment, regulation of proliferation and extracellular matrix by growth factors is tightly regulated. Renal mesangial cells express many mitogenic GPCRs, including angiotensin II (15Schlondorff D. DeCandido S. Satriano J.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1987; 253: C113-C120Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), bradykinin (15Schlondorff D. DeCandido S. Satriano J.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1987; 253: C113-C120Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), lysophosphatidic acid (16Gaits F. Salles J.P. Chap H. Kidney Int. 1997; 51: 1022-1027Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), and 5-HT2A receptors (17Nebigil C.G. Garnovskaya M.N. Spurney R.F. Raymond J.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: F122-F127PubMed Google Scholar). Mesangial cells also express RTKs, which may participate in the proliferative phase of chronic renal failure (18Mishra R. Leahy P. Simonson M.S. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: F1151-F1159Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) or in the recovery from renal failure. Mesangial cells possess an EGF receptor (19Hua H. Munk S. Whiteside C.I. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 284: F303-F312Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) and also express HB-EGF (20Takemura T. Murata Y. Hino S. Okada M. Yanagida H. Ikeda M. Yoshioka K. J. Pathol. 1999; 189: 431-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Thus, we chose this cell model for our studies. Chemicals and Antibodies—All cell culture media, fetal bovine serum and antibiotics, 4-12% acrylamide gels, SDS sample buffer, and sample reducing agent were purchased from Invitrogen. Insulin, bovine serum albumin, 5-HT, HB-EGF, and EGF were from Sigma; GM6001, MMP inhibitor II, MMP inhibitor 9/13, AG1478, protease inhibitor mixture set III, and the diphtheria toxin analogue CM197 were acquired from Calbiochem. Neutralizing antibodies against HB-EGF, TGFα, betacellulin, and amphiregulin and fluorogenic peptide substrates were purchased from R&D Systems; EGFR antibodies were from Upstate and Cell Signaling, and rat EGFR neutralizing antibody was from the Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, The University of Iowa. TACE antibodies were purchased from Chemicon (AB19027) and R&D Systems (AB930). ADAM9 antibody was from Zymed Laboratories Inc., ADAM10 antibody was from Chemicon, and ERK and phospho-ERK antibodies were from Cell Signaling. TACE blocking peptide was from Chemicon. Protein A/G beads were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Chemiluminescence reagent was from Pierce. The pLentiLox 3.7 vector was kindly provided by Dr. Luk van Parijs (Massachusetts Institute of Technology). Cell Culture—Primary rat mesangial cells were obtained from cortical sections of kidneys from 100-150-g Sprague-Dawley rats by collagenase treatment and a standard sieving technique as described previously (21Garnovskaya M.N. Nebigil C.G. Arthur J.M. Spurney R.F. Raymond J.R. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 48: 230-237PubMed Google Scholar). The kidneys were harvested in accordance with protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees of the Medical University of South Carolina and the Ralph H. Johnson Veterans Affairs Medical Center. Cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics (100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin) at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2. Cells were subcultured weekly and used between passages 6 and 14. Human mesangial cells were a gift from Dr. Hanna Abboud (University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio). The cells were maintained in medium containing a 1:1 mixture of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and Ham's F12 supplemented with 17% fetal bovine serum, 26 μg/ml insulin, and antibiotics (100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin) at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere. The cells were subcultured weekly and used between passage numbers 9-20. RNA Interference and Lentiviral Infection—We used the pLentiLox 3.7 vector (LL3.7), which contains the mouse U6 promoter, which is an RNA polymerase III promoter that efficiently directs the transcription of short RNAs (22Rubinson D.A. Dillon C.P. Kwiatkowski A.V. Sievers C. Yang L. Kopinja J. Rooney D.L. Ihrig M.M. McManus M.T. Gertler F.B. Scott M.L. Van Parijs L. Nat. Genet. 2003; 33: 401-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (1348) Google Scholar). This vector also expresses green fluorescent protein from a cytomegalovirus promoter, which allows for monitoring of the efficiency of infection. Because the TACE siRNA sequences used previously by others are not suitable for expression in viral systems, we designed and tested alternate siRNA sequences. Small hairpin RNAs were designed to contain 19-23-nucleotide sense sequences identical to the target molecule(s), followed by a short (9-nucleotide) nonspecific loop sequence and an antisense sequence, followed by five thymidines, which serve as a stop signal for RNA polymerase III. The 5′-phosphorylated, PAGE-purified oligonucleotides (Sigma Genosys) were annealed and cloned into LL3.7 between the HpaI and XhoI sites. The vector was transfected into 293FT cells (Invitrogen) together with the viral packaging vectors by lipid transfection (Transfectin, Bio-Rad), and the 48-h supernatant of the cells was used for human mesangial cell infection. One small hairpin RNA construct that resulted in nearly complete inhibition of TACE expression in human mesangial cells was chosen for use in our studies. This construct targets the sequence 5′-ggatcttggcaagtgtaag-3′ (positions 1867-1885) in ADAM-17 splice variant 2. As a control, we used 19-nucleotide scrambled small hairpin RNA, which did not give more than a 16-nucleotide match against any human genomic sequence. Cell Signaling Experiments—For ERK phosphorylation studies, human and rat mesangial cells were seeded into 12-well culture plates (Falcon) and serum-starved for 2 days in 0.5% bovine serum albumin-containing medium. For neutralizing EGFR activation, cells were preincubated with 25 μg/ml EGFR antibody for 1 h. For MMP and EGFR kinase inhibition studies, cells were pretreated for 30 min with the indicated inhibitor (10 μm GM6001; 5 μm MMP inhibitor II and MMP inhibitor 9/13 or 100 nm AG1478) for 5 or 10 min prior to treatment with the agonists (1 μm 5-HT, 1-10 ng/ml HB-EGF, and 1-10 ng/ml EGF). Neutralizing antibodies (10 μg/ml against HB-EGF, TGFα, betacellulin, and amphiregulin) and the diphtheria toxin analogue CM197 (100-200 ng/ml) were applied 30 min prior to agonist treatment. Immunoprecipitation—Immunoprecipitations from human and rat mesangial cells were performed as follows. The cells were grown to confluency in 10-cm dishes and lysed in 1 ml/dish of radioimmune precipitation buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.25% deoxycholic acid, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA) supplemented with protease inhibitors (1 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride, 0.8 μm aprotinin, 50 μm bestatin, 15 μm E-64, 20 μm leupeptin, 10 μm pepstatin A, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm sodium fluoride, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Equal amounts of protein (1 mg) were precleared with protein A/G-Sepharose beads at 4 °C. After a brief centrifugation, the supernatants were removed and incubated with 6 μg of HB-EGF antibody (Oncogene), 8 μl of TACE antiserum (R&D Systems), or 6 μgof EGFR antibody (Upstate Biotechnology) overnight at 4 °C, respectively. The next day, 50 μl of protein A/G beads was added, and the samples were further incubated at 4 °C for 1 h. Then, the samples were centrifuged and washed three times with 1 ml of radioimmune precipitation buffer, and the proteins were eluted from the beads using 2× Laemmli sample buffer. Western Blot Analysis—Protein samples were boiled for 3 min in reducing SDS-sample buffer and separated by 4-12% or by 6% acrylamide gels. Resolved proteins were transferred to 0.45-μm polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore), blocked with 4% nonfat dry milk or 3% bovine serum albumin for 1 h, and incubated overnight at 4 °C with the following antibodies: 1:1000 ERK and phospho-ERK (Cell Signaling), 1 μg/ml HB-EGF (Oncogen), 1:500 ADAM9 (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) and ADAM10 (Chemicon), 1:1000 EGFR (Cell Signaling), 1:3000 α-actinin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or 1:2000 TACE (R&D Systems) antibodies. Membranes were washed three times in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20 and incubated for 1 h at room temperature in appropriate dilutions of secondary antibodies. Immunoreactive protein bands were visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence and recorded on Kodak BioMax XR film. Optimally exposed autoradiographs were digitally scanned and analyzed using NIH Image software. Fluorescence Enzymatic Activity Measurement—Control- and TACE-silenced human mesangial cells were seeded into 96-well plates and incubated overnight. Growth medium was removed the next day and replaced with Hanks' balanced salt solution (HBSS) containing 0, 1, and 10 μm 5-HT or 1 μm PMA (Sigma) and 6 μm fluorogenic peptide substrate (R&D Systems). Enzymatic activities were measured after 10 min of incubation at room temperature using a Molecular Devices SpectraMax instrument and SoftMaxPro software. As negative control, HBSS alone, fluorogenic peptide substrate in HBSS, or fluorogenic peptide substrate and 1 or 10 μm 5-HT or 1 μm PMA without cells were used. Cell Proliferation Assay—Control- and TACE-silenced human mesangial cells (5000/well) were seeded into 96-well plates. The cells were starved in 0.1% serum-containing Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F12 medium for 24 h. Then, the cells were treated in 1% serum-containing Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F12 with vehicle or 1 and 10 μm 5-HT or kept in regular growth medium. The media were changed every second day. After 6 days, the media were removed, and the cells were placed to -80 °C. The DNA content of the wells was measured using FluoReporter blue (Molecular Probes) cell proliferation kit as suggested by the manufacturer (23Zhang J.W. Tang Q.Q. Vinson C. Lane M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 43-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). The cells were freeze-thawed, following which aqueous Hoechst dye was added, and fluorescence (360/460 nm) was measured. Statistical Analysis—Student's t test and analysis of variance using GraphPad statistics software were performed to determine statistical significance. p values < 0.05 were regarded as statistically significant. Activation of the G protein-coupled 5-HT2A Receptor Induces ERK Phosphorylation through the EGFR—We tested the involvement of EGFR transactivation in the activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase, ERK, by the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor in rat renal mesangial cells. Fig. 1A shows that when rat renal mesangial cells were pretreated with a neutralizing antibody against the EGFR (25 μg/ml) for 1 h followed by treatment for 10 min with 1 μm 5-HT, there was nearly complete attenuation of 5-HT-induced ERK phosphorylation (shown in the figure legends as p-ERK). As a control, we treated cells with 10 ng/ml EGF and showed that the neutralizing EGFR antibody also inhibited EGF-mediated ERK phosphorylation, although to a lesser degree (∼37%). 5-HT treatment detectably increased EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation in EGFR immunoprecipitates, albeit to a smaller extent than a saturating concentration of exogenously applied EGF. This phenomenon has been observed numerous times with many different GPCRs (24Luttrell L.M. Della Rocca G.J. van Biesen T. Luttrell D.K. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4637-4644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). We hypothesize that the difference reflects the fact that endogenous EGF-like growth factor (for example, HB-EGF) release in response to 5-HT is limiting and produces submaximal EGFR activation when compared with a maximally efficacious concentration of EGF. To further demonstrate that phosphorylation of the EGFR is required for 5-HT-induced ERK activation, we pretreated mesangial cells with AG1478, a compound that inhibits EGFR kinase activity and autophosphorylation. As seen in Fig. 1B, AG1478 pretreatment markedly reduced the 5-HT-induced ERK phosphorylation when compared with vehicle (Me2SO) control. EGF-induced phosphorylation of ERK was completely attenuated by 100 nm AG1478. The corresponding changes in EGFR phosphorylation are depicted in Fig. 1B, bottom. Thus, two lines of evidence (antibody neutralization and pharmacological inhibition) implicate the EGFR in 5-HT2A receptor-induced ERK phosphorylation in rat mesangial cells. Involvement of HB-EGF in 5-HT2A and EGFR Cross-talk—To test whether EGF-like growth factors are involved as extracellular soluble factors in the transactivation of EGFRs, we first employed heparin, a glycosaminoglycan whose structure is similar to the heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG) molecules present on the cell surface. HSPG serves as co-receptor for many growth factor receptors (25Thompson S.A. Higashiyama S. Wood K. Pollitt N.S. Damm D. McEnroe G. Garrick B. Ashton N. Lau K. Hancock N. J. Biol.

Klagsbrun M. Esko J.D. Leder P. Ornitz D.M. Cell. 1991; 64: 841-848Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2094) Google Scholar). Heparin can act as a competitor for HSPG and displace HB-EGF or other HSPG-tethered molecules such as amphiregulin (28Raab G. Klagsbrun M. Biochim. Biophys.

It had no effect on EGF-induced ERK activation (data not shown). Pro-HB-EGF is the unprocessed form of the HB-EGF growth factor and is the only known receptor for diphtheria toxin (29Naglich J.G.

EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2322-2330Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). To test specifically whether HB-EGF is involved in ERK phosphorylation induced by 5-HT, we employed CM197, a non-toxic analogue of diphtheria toxin. This compound has been shown to inhibit tyrosine phosphorylation of EGFR by a variety of GPCR ligands (4Prenzel N. Zwick E. Daub H. Leserer M. Abraham R. Wallasch C. Ullrich A. Nature. 1999; 402: 884-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (1501) Google Scholar). We pretreated human mesangial cells with 100 or 200 ng/ml CM197 for1hand then stimulated them with 1 μm 5-HT. At both concentrations, the toxin significantly (≈40 and 45%) attenuated 5-HT-mediated ERK phosphorylation, suggesting that HB-EGF is involved in the transactivation of EGFR by the 5-HT2A receptor in mesangial cells (Fig. 2B). To confirm the role of HB-EGF, we employed neutralizing antibody against the two most widely studied EGF family growth factors, HB-EGF and amphiregulin (Fig. 2C). Pretreatment with a neutralizing HB-EGF antibody showed that ERK phosphorylation by 5-HT was reduced by about 50%. In contrast, there was no attenuation of the signal when we employed a neutralizing amphiregulin antibody. Exposure to exogenous HB-EGF at concentrations of 1 and 10 ng/ml induced concentration-dependent increases in ERK phosphorylation. This effect was partially (45%) antagonized by the neutralizing HB-EGF antibody (10 ng/ml), consistent with the results for the 5-HT2A receptor (data not shown). MMP/ADAM Activity Is Necessary for 5-HT-induced ERK Activation—To investigate the involvement of MMPs and/or ADAMs in ERK phosphorylation by 5-HT, we employed the broad spectrum metalloenzyme inhibitor GM6001. As a control, we used a similar compound that does not have MMP inhibitory properties (GM6001 control). As shown in Fig. 3A, 10 μm GM6001 significantly reduced 1 μm 5-HT-induced ERK phosphorylation with no significant effect on EGF-induced ERK activation. GM6001 also reduced ERK phosphorylation in unstimulated cells, suggesting that constitutive MMP activity maintains basal ERK activation in mesangial cells (see Fig. 7). The effects of two additional MMP inhibitors are depicted in Fig. 3B. As shown, treatment with 5 μm MMP inhibitor II (which inhibits MMPs 1,3,7, and 9) or MMP inhibitor 9/13 (which inhibits MMPs 1,3,7,9, and 13) both suppressed 5-HT-induced ERK activation without affecting EGF-induced activation. Although these data suggest that the non-ADAM MMPs 1,3,7, or 9 might mediate cross-talk between the 5-HT2A receptor and the EGFR, their specificity varies depending on drug concentration, treatment time, and cell types, and their activity against ADAMs has not been specifically determined. Moreover, the only non-ADAM MMP that has been implicated in EGFR transactivation is MMP7 (31Hao L. Du M. Lopez-Campistrous A. Fernandez-Patron C. Circ. Res. 2004; 94: 68-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), which is not expressed in mesangial cells (data not shown). Thus, we felt that it was necessary to use more specific methods to investigate the links between HB-EGF and metalloproteinases.FIGURE 7TACE silencing attenuates 5-HT-induced HB-EGF shedding.

https://openalex.org/W2054049486,"Manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) is a primary antioxidant enzyme necessary for the survival of aerobic life. Previously, we demonstrated that specificity protein 1 (Sp1) is essential for the basal transcription of the MnSOD gene. We also identified nucleophosmin (NPM), an RNA-binding protein, as an important co-activator of NF-κB in the induction of MnSOD by cytokine and tumor promoter. Here, using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis, we demonstrate that Sp1 and NPM interact in vivo to enhance NF-κB-mediated MnSOD induction. Interaction between NPM and Sp1 or NF-κB at the promoter and enhancer of the MnSOD gene in vivo were verified by the presence of the PCR products from the promoter and enhancer elements in the ChIP assay. Unexpectedly, we also found p53, another transcription factor, to be a component of the complex detected by ChIP assay. The presence of p53 in this transcription complex was verified by immunoprecipitation of p53 proteins with antibody to Sp1 in nuclear extracts. Using a vector expressing full-length p53 cDNA, we demonstrated that p53 overexpression suppresses MnSOD mRNA and protein levels. Consistent with the negative role of p53 in the expression of the MnSOD gene, expression of small interfering RNA for p53 leads to an increase of MnSOD mRNA and protein levels. Using ChIP assays and immunoprecipitation, we further demonstrated that p53 interacts with Sp1 to suppress both the constitutive and 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate-stimulated expression of the MnSOD gene. Inhibition of the MnSOD gene by p53 was abolished when Sp1 sites on the MnSOD promoter were mutated or when the Sp1 protein was reduced by siRNA approaches. Because expression of MnSOD protects against cell death, our findings reveal a previously unrecognized mechanism of p53-mediated cell death and demonstrate an intricate relationship between the positive and negative control of MnSOD expression.

Among these primary antioxidant enzymes, MnSOD is the enzyme that must function in order for all aerobic organisms to survive. MnSOD is a highly regulated SOD encoded by the sod2 located in human chromosome 6q25.3 (1Dougall W.C. Nick H.S. Endocrinology. 1991; 129: 2379-2384Crossref Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 2Suzuki K. Tatsumi H. Satoh S. Sendra T. Naskata T. Fuji J. Takiguchi N. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: H1173-H1178PubMed Google Scholar). The critical role of MnSOD as a cytoprotective enzyme is illustrated in both MnSOD knock-out and transgenic animal models. For instance, MnSOD knock-out mice develop cardiomyopathy and die within a few days after birth (3Li Y. Huang T.T. Carison E.J. Melov S. Ursell P.C. Olson J.L. Noble L.J. Yoshimura M.P. Berger C. Chan P.H. Nat. Genet. 1995; 11: 376-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (1462) Google Scholar). MnSOD knock-out mice treated with a SOD mimetic were protected from systemic toxicity and from neonatal death (4Melov S. Schneider J.A. Day B.J. Hinerfeld D. Coskun P. Mirra S.S. Crapo J.D. Wallace D.C. Nat. Genet. 1998; 18: 159-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). Conversely, transgenic mice overexpressing human MnSOD experienced less injury resulting from inflammation (5Wispe J.R. Warner B.B. Clark J.C. Dey C.R. Neuman J. Glasser S.W. Crapo J.D. Chang L. Whitselt J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23937-23941Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), cardio-toxic drugs (6Baker K. Marcus C.B. Huffman K. Kruk H. Malfroy B. Doctrow S.R. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1998; 284: 215-221PubMed Google Scholar), and pathological and physiological conditions leading to brain injury (7Keller J.N. Kindy M.S. Holtsberg F.W. St. Clair D.K. Yen H.-C. Germeyer A.M. Steiner S.M. Bruce-Keller A.J. Hutchins J.B. Mattson M.P. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 687-697Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The human MnSOD gene is a single-copy gene consisting of five exons interrupted by four introns with a typical splice junction (8Wan X.S. Devalaraja M.N. St. Clair D.K. DNA Cell Biol. 1994; 13: 1127-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). The sod2 from human, bovine, rat, and mouse share more than 90% homology in the coding sequence. The basal promoter of the sod2 has multiple transcription factor binding motifs containing Sp1 and Ap-2 binding sites. Functional studies in different cell lines with different levels of Sp1 and Ap-2 proteins suggest that cellular levels of these proteins differentially regulate the expression of the human MnSOD gene. Transcription factor Sp1 is essential and sufficient, whereas Ap-2 is unnecessary and antagonistic to the constitutive expression of the gene (9Xu Y. Porntadavity S. St. Clair D.K. Biochem. J. 2002; 362: 401-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Sp1 is a prototype member of a small family of transcription factors (Sp1, Sp2, Sp3, and Sp4) with homologous functional domains. Members of this family have an inhibitory domain in the N termini and four transcriptional activation domains (A, B, C, and D) (10Murata Y. Kim H.G. Rogers K.T. Udvadia A.J. Horowitz J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20674-20681Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Transcriptional domains A and B are required for general and full activation, whereas domain C possesses very low activation (11Coursey A.J. Tjian R. Cell. 1988; 55: 887-898Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar), and domain D is required for synergistic activation (12Pascal E. Tjian R. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1646-1656Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). The Sp1 protein is capable of inducing homotypic, Sp1-Sp1 interaction (13Su W. Jackson S. Tjian R. Echols H. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 820-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar) or forming heterotypic interactions with different classes of nuclear proteins such as TATA box-binding protein (TBP) (14Emili A. Greenblatt J. Ingeles C.J. Mol. Cell Biol. 1994; 14: 1582-1593Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar), C/EBP (15Lee Y.H. Williams S.C. Baer M. Sterneck E. Gonzalaz F.J. Johnson P.F. Mol. Cell Biol. 1997; 17: 2038-2047Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and YY1 (16Seto E. Lewis B. Shenk T. Nature. 1993; 365: 462-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Because the MnSOD promoter does not contain a TATA or CAAT binding element, transcription of the MnSOD gene is dependent on Sp1-Sp1 interaction. The sod2 of mice and humans contains enhancer elements in the second intron of the gene (17Jones P.L. Ping D. Boss J.M. Mol. Cell Biol. 1997; 17: 6970-6981Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 18Xu Y. Kiningham K.K. Devalaraja M.N. Yeh C.-C. Majima H. Kasarskis E.J. St. Clair D.K. DNA Cell Biol. 1999; 18: 709-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Functional analyses of enhancer elements demonstrate that the intronic element consists of NF-κB, C/EBP, and NF-1 transcription factor binding sites. The activation of NF-κB is essential but not sufficient for the induction of MnSOD by cytokines and tumor promoter. NF-κB forms various homo- and heterodimer units among the mammalian subunits of p50, p52, p65 (Rel A), c-Rel, and Rel B. These dimer units in turn bind to a group of NF-κB DNA binding sites with different affinities within the target gene (19Grilli M. Chiu J.J. Lenardo M.J. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1993; 143: 1-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (883) Google Scholar, 20Zabel U. Schreck R. Baeuerle P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 252-260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although the role of Sp1 in the expression of MnSOD in HepG2 cells is well documented (21Porntadavity S. Xu Y. Kiningham K.K. Rangnekar V.M. Prachayasitikul V. St. Clair D.K. DNA Cell Biol. 2001; 20: 473-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), the role of p53 in the expression of MnSOD is unclear. p53 is a transcriptional regulator that plays an important role in suppressing tumor development. In response to stress, p53-mediated function causes two major cellular events; they are cell cycle arrest or apoptotic death, both of which prevent the proliferation of cells containing damaged DNA. It is well established that the apoptotic function is mediated in part by the property of p53 that is a positive transcriptional regulator of proapoptotic genes such as Bax (22Katayama K. Ohtsuka K. Takai H. Nakayama H. Doi K. Histol. Histopathol. 2002; 17: 715-720PubMed Google Scholar). However, it has also been shown that p53 may function as a negative regulator of gene transcription, repressing the expression of the number of genes including MnSOD (23Pascal D. Anne B. Veronique B. Evelyne M. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 430-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism by which p53 represses its target gene is unknown. We have previously demonstrated that the tumor promoter TPA enhances MnSOD expression by activation of Sp1 and that NPM serves as a co-activator of NF-κB in the induction of MnSOD by cytokine and TPA. In this paper we report the mechanisms by which p53 mediated MnSOD suppression and demonstrate that p53 plays a negative role on MnSOD gene transcription by forming a complex with Sp1, leading to the reduction of MnSOD gene transcription under both constitutive and TPA-induced conditions. Cell Culture—The human hepatoma cell line HepG2 was purchased from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). Cells were grown in 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C in media consisting of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's/Ham's F-12 (Sigma) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (Hyclone Inc., Logan, UT), 200 μm l-glutamine (Invitrogen), and 1% penicillin-streptomycin-neomycin (PSN) antibiotic (Invitrogen). Reagents—Unless otherwise stated all antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-β-actin monoclonal antibody and wild-type anti-p53 antibodies were purchased from Sigma and Calbiochem, respectively. Rabbit polyclonal MnSOD antibody, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase antibody, and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay kits were purchased from Upstate Biotechnologies (Lake Placid, NY). All chemicals were purchased from Sigma unless otherwise indicated. pMM/p53, a p53 expression vector, was kindly provided by Dr. Yi Sun (University of Michigan). The pCMV4-Sp1 expression vector was obtained from Dr. Jonathan M. Horowitz (North Carolina State University). All siRNAs were purchased from Invitrogen. Construction of Plasmid—A BamH1 fragment (B7) containing a 3.4-kilobase 5′-flanking region was used to generate the −555 to +24 MnSOD basal promoter by PCR. To create this construct, PCR primers with recognition sequences Kpn1 (upstream) and BglII (downstream) restriction sites were added for subcloning at the upstream of the luciferase reporter gene. To generate intronic enhancer fragment (I2E) (1742–2083) constructs, BamH1-digested 39b λphase DNA, containing the entire human MnSOD gene (8074 bp), was used as the template for PCR amplification with a primer having a BglII artificial restriction site. The PCR product was then ligated to the BglII site of the −555 to +24 basal promoter containing pGL3 vector, which yielded the natural orientation of the gene. The following primer sets were used to generate the aforementioned constructs: forward primer, −555, 5′-CGGGGTACCCGCTGGCTCTACCCTCAGCTCATA-3′; reverse primer, +24, 5′-GGAAGATCTGCCGAAGCCACCACAGCCACGAGT-3′; forward primer, +1742, 5′-GGAAGATCTCGGGGTTATGAAATTTGTTGAGTA-3′; reverse primer, +2083, 5′-GGAAGATCTCCACAAGTAAAGGACTGAAATTAA-3′. After amplification of the human MnSOD basal promoter (−555 to +24), the construct was independently subcloned into the pGL3 basic vector containing the luciferase gene. PCR-amplified I2E (1742–2083) fragments were directly subcloned downstream of the human MnSOD basal promoter (−555 to +24). pMM/p53, a cDNA clone, was subcloned into pcDNA3.1 expression vector. Sp1 expression vector pCMV4/Sp1 was amplified in Escherichia coli, and DNAs were purified. The presence of cDNA was confirmed by restriction digestion and sequencing. Site-directed Mutagenesis—Site-specific mutations of Sp1 binding sites in the MnSOD promoter were performed according to our previous report (9Xu Y. Porntadavity S. St. Clair D.K. Biochem. J. 2002; 362: 401-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), in which the resulting mutated sites were obtained using Chameleon® double-stranded site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions and confirmed by competitive gel-shift analysis. The selection primer corresponding to a change of unique XbaI (underlined sequence) site was 5′-GATCGCCGTGTAATTCTGGAGTCGGGGCGGCCGGCCGCTTC-3′. The mutated primers to target each Sp1-binding site (underlined sequences with the mutated nucleotides in lowercase) were designed as follows: Sp1-M1, 5′-CAGCTCATAGGCCGGCTGaatGGCGCTGACCAGCAGCTAG-3′; Sp1-M2, 5′-CCCCGCCGGCACCCTCAGGaatGGACCGGAGGCAGGGCCTTCG-3′; Sp1-M3, 5′-GTGTACGGCAAGCGCGGGtaaaCGGGACAGGCACGCAGGG-3′; Sp1-M5, 5′-CTTTCTTAAGGCCCGCGaatGGCGCAGGAGCGGCACTC-3′. Inserting mutations in double complementary nucleotides made sp1-M4. After annealing, the double-stranded DNAs were cloned between SmaI and PvuII restriction sites. Two sets of oligonucleotides were used: 5′-GGGGTTGGGCGCGGCGGGCGCGaaatGGGGCCCGCGGGGGGGGaaatGGttatGCGGTGCCCTTGCGGCGCAG-3′ and 5′-CTGCGCCGCAAGGGCACCGCataaaCCatttCCCCCCCCGCGGGCCCCatttCGCGCCCGCCGCGCCCAACCCC-3′. All mutations in the binding sites were confirmed by DNA sequencing. The internal restriction sites were used to link mutations for the individual sites. Transient Transfection and Luciferase Assay—HepG2 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with fetal bovine serum, l-glutamine, and insulin, with no antibiotics. 70–80% confluent cells were transfected with plasmids after a Lipofectamine® transfection protocol as directed by the manufacturer. Cells were co-transfected with 2 μm plasmid DNA constructs containing the I2E or basal promoter of the human MnSOD gene in the pGL3 reporter gene. pRL-TK containing Renilla cDNA was also co-transfected with firefly luciferase reporter vector as an internal control at a concentration of 0.2 μm. Twenty-four h after transfection, the cells were washed twice with PBS and incubated in fresh medium. Twelve hours later, transfected cells were trypsinized and replated in a 12-well plate at a density of 1.5 × 105 cells per well. After an additional 24 h, cells were treated with 100 nm TPA. Twelve hours post-treatment, the cells were washed with PBS and lysed in passive lysis buffer. Similarly, p53 expression vector (pcDNA3.1/p53) was co-transfected with MnSOD promoter containing pGL3 reporter vector in subconfluent HepG2 cells. In other experiments, Sp1 expression vector and p53 expression vector or control vectors were co-transfected with MnSOD promoter containing pGL3 reporter vector in HepG2 cells. p53 and Sp1 siRNA were transfected in subconfluent HepG2 cells according to manufacturer's instructions. Cells were treated with a TPA for 12 h in the same manner as described above. Then the cells were lysed in passive lysis buffer; cell lysates were collected, and the samples were analyzed with the luciferase reporter assay system, in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions, in a TD-20/20 luminometer. Nuclear Extract Preparation—Nuclei were isolated from HepG2 cells. A subconfluent monolayer of cells was collected and centrifuged at 100 × g for 2 min at 4 °C to obtain cell pellets, which were then re-suspended in buffer A containing 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride with the inclusion of protease inhibitors (pepstatin, aprotinin, leupeptin) at a concentration of 1 μg/ml. Additionally, the phosphatase inhibitors NaF (5 mm) and Na3VO4 (1 mm) were included. The cell suspension was incubated on ice for 15 min. 12.5 μl of 10% Nonidet P-40 was added, and the mixture was vigorously vortexed for 15 s. The cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions were separated by centrifugation at 17,000 × g at 4 °C for 30 s. Subsequently, the nuclear pellets were re-suspended in buffer B containing 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 1.5 mm MgCl2, 420 mm NaCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 35% glycerol, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and protease inhibitor (pepstatin, aprotinin, leupeptin) at a concentration of 1 μg/ml and incubated on ice for 20 min. Nuclear proteins in the supernatant fraction were collected by centrifugation at 14,000 × g at 4 °C for 2 min. Immunoprecipitation—Immunoprecipitation studies were carried out with nuclear extracts from HepG2 cells (either vehicle- or TPA-treated) in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (9.1 mm Na2HPO4, 1.7 mm NaH2PO4, 150 mm NaCl (pH 7.4), 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 10 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin). The antibodies used for immunoprecipitation were goat anti-p50 and mouse anti-p53. One mg of nuclear extract was incubated at 4 °C overnight with 2 μg of corresponding antibodies. After incubation with the antibody, 20 μl of protein A/G (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) was added to the reaction mixture of the antibody and nuclear extract and rotated 2 h at 4°C. Immunoprecipitates were collected by centrifugation at 2500 × g for 5 min followed by washing 4 times with radioimmune precipitation assay buffers. After the final wash, all the adhering liquids with the protein A/G beads were removed. Samples were then resuspended in the 1× Laemmli buffer, subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (10% gel (w/v)), and transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane; the immunoprecipitated proteins were then detected by Western blotting. ChIP Assays—One million HepG2 cells were grown on a 10-cm dish for 24 h and then treated with Me2SO (control) and TPA (100 nm) for 12 h. Histone to DNA cross-linking was performed by adding formaldehyde directly to culture media to a final concentration of 1%. Cells were then washed twice using ice-cold PBS containing protease inhibitors (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin). Cells were pelleted by centrifuging at 2000 × g for 4 min at 4 °C and then resuspended in protease inhibitor containing SDS lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.1), 10 mm EDTA, and 1% SDS). Crossed-linked chromatin was sonicated to shear DNA on ice to lengths between 200 to 1000 base pairs. Sonicated, cross-linked chromatin was centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 10 min to remove the insoluble materials. The protein concentration of the supernatant was estimated. An equal amount of soluble chromatin from each sample was then diluted 10-fold in ChIP dilution buffer (16.7 mm Tris, 167 mm NaCl, 1.1% Triton X-100, and 0.01% SDS). The diluted soluble chromatin fraction was pre-cleaned by 20 μl of salmon sperm DNA/protein A-agarose beads. Pre-cleaned chromatin was mixed with the appropriate antibodies (p50 (Santa Cruz) 2 μg, NPM (Santa Cruz) 2 μg, and Sp1 (Santa Cruz) 2 μg). Parallel preimmune control precipitation was performed by normal IgG. Antibodies and chromatin were allowed to mix and were rotated overnight at 4 °C and precipitated with the appropriate amounts of (60 μl) salmon sperm DNA/protein A-agarose slurry for 2 h at 4°C with rotation to collect the antibody/chromatin complex. Beads were then washed by rotation at 4 °C with 1 ml of buffer in the following order of washing; low salt immune complexes wash buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.1), 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1%Triton X-100, 1% SDS); high salt immune complex wash buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.1), 500 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1%Triton X-100, 1% SDS); LiCl immune complex wash buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.1), 0.25 mm LiCl, 1% deoxycholate, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS); followed by two washes with TE buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.1), 1 mm EDTA (pH 8.1)). The precipitated antibody-chromatin complexes were analyzed by either Western blotting or polymerase chain reaction. For Western blot analysis, immunocomplexes attached to the beads were boiled for 10 min with 25 μl of 1× Laemmli buffer and then subjected to 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Immunoprecipitated proteins were detected by Western blotting. For PCR amplification, precipitated immunocomplexes were eluted twice for 15 min each at room temperature with 250 μl of elution buffer (1% SDS, 0.1 m NaHCO3). Reversal of cross-linking was performed by heating the elution mixture at 65 °C for 4 h in the presence of 20 μl of 5 m NaCl. Proteins were digested with proteinase K by incubating for 1 h at 45 °C in the presence of EDTA. DNA was then recovered by phenol:chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation followed by resuspension in nuclease-free water for PCR amplification. Immunoprecipitated DNA was analyzed by PCR amplification. For amplification of enhancer (1742–2083) elements of the MnSOD gene, the primer sets were: 5′-CGGGGTTATGAAATTTGTTGAGTA-3′ (forward primer, +1742) and 5′-CCACAAGTAAAGGACTGAAATTAA-3′ (reverse primer, +2083); −154 to +6, 5′-ACAGGCACGCAGGGCACCCCCGGGGTT-3′ (forward primer, −154) and 5′-TCCTGCGCCGCCCGCGGGGCCTTAAGAAA-3′ (reverse primer, −6); −555 to +24, 5′-CGCTGGCTCTACCCTCAGCTCATA-3′ (−555, forward primer) and 5′-GCCGAAGCCACCACAGCCACGAGT-3′ (reverse primer, +24). For Bax promoter, the forward primer was 5′-ACGTCCTGCCTGGAAGCA-3′, and reverse primer 5′-CCCCAGCGCAGAAGGAAT-3′ were used. We also amplified the transcription factor binding of the off-target region of MnSOD gene using forward primer (5′-GGCCTACGTGAACCTGA-3′) and reverse primer (5′-CAATTCACCAGTGCTGGCAA-3′) ranging from +521 to +839. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—The consensus double-stranded oligonucleotides of NF-κB sequence 5′-AGTTGAGGGGACTTTCCCAGGC-3′ and Sp1 sequence 5′-ATTCGATCGGGGCGGGGCGAGC-3′ (Promega, Madison, WI) were radioactively labeled with [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase. The probes were purified on 20% native polyacrylamide gel and eluted in 600 μl of TE buffer (pH 7.4) containing 10 mm Tris HCl and 1 mm EDTA. The activity of radiolabeled probes was counted and stored at −80 °C. Probes were used within 2 weeks after preparation. In each reaction, 5 μg of nuclear protein and 6 μl of 5× binding buffer containing 20% (v/v) glycerol, 5 mm MgCl2, 2.5 mm EDTA, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.25 mg/ml poly(dI-dC), and 50,000 cpm of radiolabeled probes were used. Samples were incubated for 20 min at room temperature. To determine the components of the complex bound to the consensus element after treatment, supershift experiments were performed by adding 1 μg of the primary antibody to the binding reaction and extending the incubation to 1 h at room temperature. DNA-protein complexes were separated from unbound probes on 6% polyacrylamide native gel. Western Analysis—Nuclear extracts (20 μg) from either control or treated cells were used to analyze the levels of various transcription factors or co-activators. For whole cellular proteins, 50 μg were analyzed by Western blotting. Samples were boiled with 1× Laemmli buffer and then subjected to 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The transfer efficiency was assessed by incubation with 0.1% Ponceau solution. The membrane was washed with distilled water until the dye disappeared completely. The membranes were then blocked by 5% nonfat dried milk in TBS-T (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), 150 mm NaCl, and 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20) buffer (pH 7.8) for at least 1 h at room temperature. After a short wash with TBS-T buffer, the membranes were incubated in the primary antibody for at least 2 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C. The primary antibodies were diluted in TBS-T buffer containing 5% nonfat dried milk in a dilution range of 1000–5000. The membranes were then washed 3 times, each time for 10 min, with TBS-T. The membranes were incubated with the secondary antibody at a dilution range of 2,000–10,000 for 1–2 h at room temperature. The membranes were washed twice with TBS-T buffer for 10 min and once with PBS for 5 min. Proteins were detected using the enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (ECL®, Amersham Biosciences). The Quantity One® Image Analyzer software program (Bio-Rad) was used for quantitative densitometric analysis. RNA Isolation, cDNA Synthesis, and RT-PCR—Total RNA was isolated from HepG2 cells by single-step guanidium thiocyanate/phenol:chloroform extraction using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, subconfluent HepG2 cells were washed with ice-cold 1× PBS and harvested by scraping and centrifuging. The cells were suspended in 1 ml of TRIzol reagent and incubated at room temperature for 15 min. Chloroform (0.2 ml) was added to the sample, and the sample was vigorously vortexed and then incubated at room temperature for 10 min. The RNA-containing aqueous phase was extracted after centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. RNA was precipitated with isopropyl alcohol, and the pellet was washed with 70% ethanol in diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated water. The RNA pellet was air-dried. RNA concentration was measured, separated into aliquots, and stored at −80 °C until used. RNA samples having an A260/A280 ratio of 18.0 or more were used for RT-PCR. For reverse transcription cDNA was generated using 2 μg of total RNA, oligo(dT) primer, and SuperScript™III first strand reverse transcriptase according to the manufacturer's instructions (SuperScript™III first strand synthesis for RT-PCR, Invitrogen) in a total volume of 20 μl. After RT reaction, cDNA was diluted to 100 μl with diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated water. Two microliters of first-strand cDNA were amplified using the following PCR primer sets: hMnSOD sense (5′-AGGTTGTTCACGTAGGCCGC-3′ and antisense (5′-AGCATGTTGAGCCGGGCAAGT-3′), wild type p53 sense (5′-ATGGAGGAGCCGCAGTCAGATCC-3′ and antisense (5′-TTCTGTCTTCCCGGACTGAGTCTGACT-3′), Bax sense (5′-AGGATGATTGCTGACGTGGACACG-3′) and antisense (5′-GGTGTACCGTCTGTCACTGGTAGAA-3), and β-actin sense (5′-TGTTACCAACTGGGACGACA-3′) and antisense (5′-CTGGGTCATCATCTTTTCACGGT-3′). For each PCR reaction, 2 μl of diluted cDNA were amplified using specific primers (50 pmol) in a final volume of 50 μl. For hMnSOD, PCR was performed for 30 cycles at 94 °C (30 s), 65 °C (15 s), and 72 °C (20 s) followed by a final 72 °C step (7 min). For p53, PCR was performed for 30 cycles at 94 °C (30 s), 60 °C (30 s), and 72 °C (45 s) followed by a final 72 °C step (7 min). For Bax, PCR was performed for 30 cycles at 94 °C (30 s), 58 °C (30 s), and 72 °C (45 s) followed by a final 72 °C step (7 min). For β-actin, PCR was performed for 30 cycles at 94 °C (30 s), 60 °C (30 s), and 72 °C (40 s) followed by a final 72 °C step (7 min). PCR products were separated on 1% agarose gel and visualized by ethidium bromide staining. Northern Blotting—For RNA analysis by Northern blotting, 30 μg of total RNA were separated on 1.1% formaldehyde-agarose gel (1.1% agarose and 4.6% formaldehyde in 1× MOPS, sodium acetate running buffer (pH 7.0)), transferred onto a nylon membrane, and hybridized with γ-32P-labeled hMnSOD cDNA and β-actin cDNA. Statistical Analysis—Data were analyzed using two-way analysis of variance for comparison. Bonferroni's post-test multiple comparisons procedure was used to determine the statistical significance.

https://openalex.org/W2141749586,"We present a detailed comparative analysis of the PDZ domains of the human LAP proteins Erbin, Densin-180, and Scribble and the MAGUK ZO-1. Phage-displayed peptide libraries and in vitro affinity assays were used to define ligand binding profiles for each domain. The analysis reveals the importance of interactions with all four C-terminal residues of the ligand, which constitute a core recognition motif, and also the role of interactions with more upstream ligand residues that support and modulate the core binding interaction. In particular, the results highlight the importance of site−1, which interacts with the penultimate residue of ligand C termini. Site−1 was found to be monospecific in the Erbin PDZ domain (accepts tryptophan only), bispecific in the first PDZ domain of ZO-1 (accepts tryptophan or tyrosine), and promiscuous in the Scribble PDZ domains. Furthermore, it appears that the level of promiscuity within site−1 greatly influences the range of potential biological partners and functions that can be associated with each protein. These findings show that subtle changes in binding specificity can significantly alter the range of biological partners for PDZ domains, and the insights enhance our understanding of this diverse family of peptide-binding modules.

Many specialized cellular functions associated with multicellular organisms are dependent upon specialized membrane domains (1Fanning A.S. Anderson J.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 432-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Particularly well studied examples of membrane specialization are found in the cells of the epithelia and endothelia, which exhibit apicobasal polarity arising from the differential sorting of plasma membrane proteins to apical and basolateral compartments and from polarization of the cytoskeleton (2Peifer M. Tepass U. Nature. 2000; 403: 611-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 3Bryant P.J. Huwe A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: E141-E143Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Apicobasal polarity is maintained by junctional complexes that are responsible for lateral adhesion between cells and act as barriers to diffusion between different compartments (4Gonzalez-Mariscal L. Betanzos A. Nava P. Jaramillo B.E. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 2003; 81: 1-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (930) Google Scholar, 5Nagafuchi A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 600-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). The molecular interactions governing cellular polarity have attracted increasing attention, as it has become apparent that loss of polarity is linked to uncontrolled cell proliferation, a hallmark of tumorigenesis (6Humbert P. Russell S. Richardson H. BioEssays. 2003; 25: 542-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 7Wodarz A. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: R624-R626Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 8Greaves S. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: E140Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). In vertebrates, the junctional complexes include tight junctions (4Gonzalez-Mariscal L. Betanzos A. Nava P. Jaramillo B.E. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 2003; 81: 1-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (930) Google Scholar), which are located in the most apical region of the lateral membrane, and adherens junctions (5Nagafuchi A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 600-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar), which are located immediately basal to tight junctions. Arthropods contain septate junctions rather than tight junctions, and these are located basally rather than apically to the adherens junctions (Fig. 1A). Adherens junctions maintain cell-cell adhesion, whereas tight/septate junctions maintain apicobasal polarity and regulate diffusion of solutes through the paracellular pathway. To a large extent, these distinct functions are a consequence of the protein composition of each type of junction. Tight junctions contain three types of integral membrane proteins: claudins, occluding, and junctional adhesion molecule. Adherens junctions contain integral membrane proteins of the cadherins family, which in turn associate with the cytoplasmic proteins α-, β- and γ-catenin. Inside the cell, diverse cytoplasmic proteins associate with either the claudin-occludin complex in tight junctions or the cadherin-catenin complex in adherens junctions. Many of these proteins belong to families that contain PDZ (PSD-95/Discs-large/ZO-1) 2The abbreviations used are: PDZ, PSD-95/Discs-large/ZO-1; CAT, catenin; BSA, bovine serum albumin; Densin-PDZ, the PDZ domain of human Densin-180; DLG, Discs-large; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; Erbin-PDZ, the PDZ domain of human Erbin; GST, glutathione S-transferase; GUK, guanylate kinase; GUKH, guanylate kinase holder; LAP, leucinerich repeats and PDZ; MAGUK, membrane-associated guanylate kinase; NMDA, N-methyl-d-aspartate; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PSD-95, postsynaptic density-95; Scrib-PDZn, the nth PDZ domain of human Scrib; TOPK, T-LAK cell-originated protein kinase; ZO, zonula occludens; ZO1-PDZn, the nth PDZ domain of human ZO-1. domains (4Gonzalez-Mariscal L. Betanzos A. Nava P. Jaramillo B.E. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 2003; 81: 1-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (930) Google Scholar, 5Nagafuchi A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 600-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar); in the present study, we have focused on two of these families. The LAP (leucine-rich repeats and PDZ domains) family members contain 16 leucine-rich repeats, two LAP-specific domains, and one or more PDZ domains (3Bryant P.J. Huwe A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: E141-E143Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 9Santoni M.-J. Pontarotti P. Birnbaum D. Borg J.-P. Trends Genet. 2002; 18: 494-497Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1B). In mammals, the family includes Erbin and its close homologue Densin-180, which each contain one PDZ domain, and Scribble (Scrib), which contains four PDZ domains (Fig. 1B). Although expression of Densin-180 is brain-specific (10Izawa I. Nishizawa M. Ohtakara K. Inagaki M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5345-5350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 11Apperson M.L. Moon I.S. Kennedy M.B. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 6389-6852Crossref Google Scholar), Erbin and Scrib are expressed in both neurons and epithelia (12Huang Y.Z. Wang Q. Xiong W.C. Mei L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19318-19326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 13Navarro C. Nola S. Audebert S. Santoni M.-J. Arsanto J.-P. Ginestier C. Marchetto S. Jacquemier J. Isnardon D. Bivic A.L. Birnbaum D. Borg J.-P. Oncogene. 2005; Google Scholar). In polarized epithelial cells, both proteins are localized on the lateral membrane and at adherens junctions (13Navarro C. Nola S. Audebert S. Santoni M.-J. Arsanto J.-P. Ginestier C. Marchetto S. Jacquemier J. Isnardon D. Bivic A.L. Birnbaum D. Borg J.-P. Oncogene. 2005; Google Scholar, 14Ohno H. Hirabayashi S. Iizuka T. Ohnishi H. Fujita T. Hata Y.

Cancer. 2004; 90: 194-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Genetic studies have shown that Scrib is a neoplastic tumor suppressor in Drosophila, as genetic mutations lead to loss of apicobasal polarity and concomitant overproliferation (16Bilder D. Perrimon N. Nature. 2000; 403: 676-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar, 17Bilder D. Li M. Perrimon N. Science. 2000; 289: 113-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (739) Google Scholar). In addition, studies in Caenorhabditis elegans have shown that LET-413, a LAP family member, is critical for normal assembly of adherens junctions (18Legouis R. Gansmuller A. Sookhareea S. Bosher J.M. Baillie D.L. Labouesse M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 415-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Thus, members of the LAP family are involved in the organization of junctional complexes and in the establishment and maintenance of cell polarity. The membrane-associated guanylate kinase-like homologues (MAGUKs) represent another family that is associated with junctional complexes; these proteins contain PDZ domains, a Src homology-3 (SH3) domain, and an inactive guanylate kinase-like (GUK) domain that is involved in protein-protein interactions (1Fanning A.S. Anderson J.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 432-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar, 4Gonzalez-Mariscal L. Betanzos A. Nava P. Jaramillo B.E. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 2003; 81: 1-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (930) Google Scholar, 19Gonzalez-Mariscal L. Betanzos A. Avila-Flores A. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 11: 315-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). The MAGUK zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) and its close homologues (ZO-2 and ZO-3) each contain three PDZ domains (Fig. 1B) and are involved in assembling protein complexes at tight junctions (4Gonzalez-Mariscal L. Betanzos A. Nava P. Jaramillo B.E. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 2003; 81: 1-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (930) Google Scholar, 19Gonzalez-Mariscal L. Betanzos A. Avila-Flores A. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 11: 315-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). ZO-1 has also been implicated as a tumor suppressor, because down-regulation of its expression is coupled to breast cancer progression (20Hoover K.B. Liao S.Y. Bryant P.J. Am. J. Pathol. 1998; 153: 1767-1773Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). However, it is likely that ZO-1 acts as a tumor suppressor only in certain cancers, as its function depends on many different factors (4Gonzalez-Mariscal L. Betanzos A. Nava P. Jaramillo B.E. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 2003; 81: 1-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (930) Google Scholar), and it is overexpressed in some cancers (21Palmer H.G. Gonzalez-Sancho J.M. Espada J. Berciano M.T. Puig I. Baulida J. Quintanilla M. Cano A. de Herreros A.G. Lafarga M. Munoz A. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 369-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (701) Google Scholar). ZO-1 is localized exclusively at tight junctions in polarized epithelia, but in non-epithelial cells that lack tight junctions, the protein is associated with adherens junctions (22Itoh M. Nagafuchi A. Yonemura S. Kitani-Yasuda T. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 491-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar, 23Itoh M. Nagafuchi A. Moroi S. Tsukita S. J.

ZO-1 also associates with adherens junction markers in nonpolarized epithelial cells, as for example, ZO-1 and E-cadherin colocalize at initial sites of cell-cell contact during the establishment of apicobasal polarity (25Yonemura S. Itoh M. Nagafuchi A. Tsukita S. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 127-142Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Rajasekaran A.K. Hojo M. Huima T. Rodriquez-Boulan E. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 451-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar, 27Ando-Akatsuka Y. Yonemura S. Itoh M. Furuse M. Tsukita S. J. Cell. Physiol. 1999; 179: 115-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 28Adams C.L. Chen Y.T. Smith S.J. Nelson W.J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 1105-1119Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). Distinct junctional complexes form as polarization proceeds, and ZO-1 and E-cadherin segregate into the tight or adherens junctions, respectively (27Ando-Akatsuka Y. Yonemura S. Itoh M. Furuse M. Tsukita S. J. Cell. Physiol. 1999; 179: 115-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). In contrast with ZO-1, the LAP family members are excluded from the tight junctions of polarized epithelia and, instead, are confined to the adherens junctions and the basolateral layer (13Navarro C. Nola S. Audebert S. Santoni M.-J. Arsanto J.-P. Ginestier C. Marchetto S. Jacquemier J. Isnardon D. Bivic A.L. Birnbaum D. Borg J.-P. Oncogene. 2005; Google Scholar). The LAP and ZO families present an interesting example of proteins that exhibit both convergence and divergence in terms of structural organization and cellular function. The proteins all utilize PDZ domains to mediate interactions with intracellular binding partners, and we thought it would be enlightening to examine in detail the similarities and differences between these domains. PDZ domains are peptide-binding modules, and as many as 440 PDZ domains in 259 different proteins have been predicted within the human genome (29Schultz J. Copley R.R. Doerks T. Ponting C.P. Bork P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 231-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (1057) Google Scholar). They are usually embedded in large scaffolding proteins along with additional PDZ domains and/or other peptide-binding modules, and thus, PDZ domains function to assemble their ligands into large complexes with other scaffold-associated molecules (30Sheng M. Sala C. Annu. Rev. Neuorosci. 2001; 24: 1-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (1049) Google Scholar, 31Sheng M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

As the biological functions of PDZ domains are intimately associated with ligand specificity, there is great interest in understanding the molecular basis for PDZ domain function. Structural studies have revealed that PDZ domains share a common fold and most recognize protein C termini in a sequence-specific manner (33Im Y.J. Lee J.H. Park S.H. Park S.J. Rho S.-H. Kang G.B.

Peptides bind in a groove located between a β-strand and an α-helix, and in most cases, the C-terminal carboxylate is critical for high affinity binding, as it is hydrogen-bonded to backbone amides in a conserved “carboxylate-binding” loop. In addition, the last four ligand residues form hydrogen bonds with the PDZ domain β-strand in an anti-parallel β-sheet conformation. These backbone-mediated interactions are common to most PDZ domain-ligand complexes, and thus, it is the nature of the interactions with the ligand side chains that determines the specificity and biological function of each unique PDZ domain. Essentially all PDZ domains prefer ligands containing a hydrophobic residue at the C terminus (position0), 3The C terminus of a PDZ domain ligand is designated as position0, and the remaining positions are numbered with negative integers for which the absolute value decreases toward the C terminus. The corresponding binding sites on the PDZ domain are numbered in a corresponding manner as site0, site−1, etc. and early studies have suggested that specificity is determined mainly by interactions with the side chain at position−2 (35Doyle D.A. Lee A. Lewis J. Kim E. Sheng M. MacKinnon R. Cell. 1996; 85: 1067-1076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (976) Google Scholar, 39Daniels D.L. Cohen A.R. Anderson J.M. Brunger A.T. Nat.

Science. 1997; 275: 73-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (1224) Google Scholar). These findings led to a classification scheme based on the specificity of site−2, and two major classes of PDZ domain specificities were proposed (class I (X[T/S]XφCOOH) and class II (XφXφCOOH), where X is any amino acid and φ is a hydrophobic amino acid). However, recent studies have revealed a more complex picture of selectivity that depends critically on all four C-terminal ligand side chains and is also influenced by residues further upstream (33Im Y.J.

For example, our studies of the Erbin PDZ domain (Erbin-PDZ) have demonstrated that it is a class I domain, but high affinity ligand recognition also depends on a Trp at position−1, a Glu/Asp at position−3, and an aromatic residue at position−4 (38Skelton N.J. Koehler M.F.T. Zobel K. Wong W.L. Yeh S. Pisabarro M.T. Yin J.P. Lasky L.A. Sidhu S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 7645-7654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Erbin-PDZ was originally identified as a binding partner for ErbB2 by yeast two-hybrid methods (45Jaulin-Bastard F. Saito H. Le Bivic A. Ollendorff V. Marchetto S. Birnbaum D. Borg J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15256-15263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), but it was subsequently shown that the PDZ domain binds with much higher affinity to three p120-like catenins (δ-CAT, ARVCF (armadillo protein deleted in velocardiofacial syndrome), and p0071) (46Laura R.P. Witt A.S. Held H.A. Gerstner R. Deshayes K. Koehler M.F.T. Kosik K.S. Sidhu S.S. Lasky L.A. J. Biol.

In contrast, the C terminus of ErbB2 (DVPVCOOH) differs significantly at position−1. This example and others have made it clear that detailed analysis and comparison of many proteins will be required to ascertain and explain the full range of ligand specificities supported by the PDZ domain fold. A high resolution understanding of the molecular basis for PDZ domain function should in turn provide considerable insights into the mechanisms whereby ligand specificity and promiscuity dictate biological function. Herein, we report an in-depth, comparative analysis of the binding specificities of the PDZ domains of the human LAP family and ZO-1. We have used phage-displayed peptide libraries and in vitro affinity assays to map the binding specificity of each domain in fine detail. The specificity profiles were used to rationalize known natural interactions and, also, to predict novel, putative interactions that may explain the physiological functions of each protein. In an accompanying article (48Appleton B.A. Zhang Y. Wu P. Yin J.P. Hunziker W. Skelton N.J. Sidhu S.S. Wiesmann C. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 22312-22320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), we used structural analysis to delineate the molecular basis for similarities and differences in ligand recognition. Taken together, these studies provide a comprehensive view of how PDZ domains use a common fold to mediate a diverse array of biological functions. Materials—Enzymes and M13-KO7 helper phage were from New England Biolabs. Maxisorp immunoplates plates were from Nalge NUNC International (Naperville, IL). Escherichia coli XL1-blue was from Stratagene. Bovine serum albumin (BSA) and Tween 20 were from Sigma. Anti-glutathione S-transferase (GST) antibody was from Zymed Laboratories. Plasmid pGEX, horseradish peroxidase/anti-GST antibody conjugate, and glutathione-Sepharose 4B were from Amersham Biosciences. 3,3′, 5,5′-Tetramethyl-benzidine/H2O2 peroxidase substrate was from Kirkegaard and Perry Laboratories, Inc. NeutrAvidin was from Pierce Biotechnology, Inc. Anti-mouse IgG antibody conjugate was from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories. The Quick-coupled T7 TnT in vitro translation system was from Promega. Synthetic Peptides—Peptides were synthesized using standard Fmoc (9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl) protocols, cleaved off the resin with 2.5% triisopropylsilane and 2.5% H2O in trifluoroacetic acid, and purified by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography. The purity and mass of each peptide were verified by liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry. Library Construction and Sorting—A peptide library was fused to the C terminus of a mutant M13 major coat protein designed for high valency display (49Held H.A. Sidhu S.S. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 340: 587-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) as described (46Laura R.P. Witt A.S. Held H.A. Gerstner R. Deshayes K. Koehler M.F.T. Kosik K.S. Sidhu S.S. Lasky L.A. J. Biol.

The library consisted of random decapeptides encoded by 10 consecutive degenerate codons (NNK, where N = A/C/G/T and K = G/T) and contained 2 × 1010 unique members. Phage pools from the library were cycled through rounds of binding selection with a GST·PDZ fusion protein coated on 96-well Maxisorp immunoplates as the capture target. Phage were propagated in E. coli XL1-blue with M13-KO7 helper phage and 10 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. After three or four rounds of binding selection, individual phage clones were analyzed in a high-throughput phage ELISA (51Deshayes K. Schaffer M.L. Skelton N.J. Nakamura G.R. Kadkhodayan S. Sidhu S.S. Chem. Biol. 2002; 9: 495-505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), and positive clones were subjected to DNA sequence analysis. Protein Purification—GST·PDZ fusion proteins were produced and purified using the pGEX E. coli expression system as recommended by the manufacturer. For each PDZ domain, protein fragments spanning the following amino acids of the full-length protein were produced: Erbin-PDZ (1217-1371), Densin-PDZ (1424-1537), Scrib-PDZ1 (718-829), Scrib-PDZ2 (857-983), Scrib-PDZ3 (982-1100), Scrib-PDZ4 (1099-1219), ZO1-PDZ1 (414-506), ZO1-PDZ2 (584-660), ZO1-PDZ3 (819-901). Affinity Assays—The binding affinities of peptides for Erbin-PDZ were determined as IC50 values using the AlphaScreen™, a bead-based chemiluminescence assay. The IC50 was defined as the concentration of peptide that blocked 50% of the chemiluminescence arising from the interaction of anti-GST acceptor beads coated with GST·Erbin-PDZ and streptavidin donor beads coated with biotinylated peptide (biotin-TGWETWVCOOH). Assays were performed at room temperature in white opaque 384-well plates (25 μl/well) under subdued lighting to reduce nonspecific chemiluminescence. The assay buffer consisted of PBS, 0.5% Tween 20, 0.1% bovine γ-globulin, 1 ppm proclin. The reaction mixture contained fixed concentrations of anti-GST acceptor beads (16 μg/ml), biotin-TGWETWVCOOH (36 nm), and GST·Erbin-PDZ (3 nm). Serial dilutions of peptide were added followed by addition of streptavidin donor beads (20 μg/ml). The mixture was incubated at room temperature for 1 h and read on an AlphaQuest plate reader set at 1 s/well. The binding affinities of peptides for the Scrib PDZ domains and ZO1-PDZ1 were determined as IC50 values using a competition ELISA as described (44Fuh G. Pisabarro M.T. Li Y. Quan C. Lasky L.A. Sidhu S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21486-21491Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The IC50 value was defined as the concentration of peptide that blocked 50% of PDZ domain binding to immobilized peptide. Assay plates were prepared by immobilizing an N-terminally biotinylated peptide (RRWFETDLCOOH, HRVRETWVCOOH, RSWFETDLCOOH, or WRWTTWLCOOH for Scrib-PDZ1, -PDZ2, -PDZ3 or ZO1-PDZ1, respectively) on Maxisorp immunoplates coated with neutravidin and blocked with BSA. A fixed concentration of GST·PDZ fusion protein (0.7, 6.6, 0.7, or 3.6 nm for Scrib-PDZ1, -PDZ2, -PDZ3, or ZO1-PDZ1, respectively) in PBS, 0.5% BSA, 0.1% Tween 20 (PBT buffer) was preincubated for 3 h with serial dilutions of peptide and then transferred to the assay plates. After a 15-min incubation, the plates were washed with PBS, 0.05% Tween 20, incubated with a mixture of anti-GST antibody (0.5 μg/ml) and horseradish peroxidase/rabbit antimouse IgG antibody conjugate (1:2000 dilution) in PBT buffer, washed again, and detected with 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethyl-benzidine/H2O2 peroxidase substrate. For IC50 values less than or greater than 100 μm, the standard deviations were less than 20 or 40%, respectively. Pull-down Assays—GST or GST·PDZ fusion protein was bound to glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads following standard protocols, and bound proteins were quantified by SDS-PAGE using known amounts of BSA as standards. Wild-type ARVCF, or a mutant ARVCF in which the last three amino acids (SWVCOOH) were replaced by alanines (AAACOOH), was produced by in vitro transcription/translation using the TnT™ Quick-coupled T7 transcription/translation system (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Beads carrying protein (2-10 μg) were incubated with 5-10 μl of in vitro translated wild-type or mutant ARVCF for 2 h at 4 °C in binding buffer (25 mm Tris, 50 mm NaCl, 20 mm MgCl2, 0.1% Tween 20, 1mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.5). The beads were washed with binding buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, and bound proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, autoradiography, and densitometry. Peptides corresponding to the 11 C-terminal amino acids of wild-type or a mutant (T233R) Claudin 16 were coupled to beads, and 25μl of beads (2-10μg of coupled peptide) were incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with 1-2 mg of GST·PDZ fusion protein in binding buffer (25 mm Tris, 50 mm NaCl, 20 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1% Tween 20, pH 7.5). The beads were washed five times with binding buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, and bound proteins were fractionated by SDS-PAGE on 10% gels and blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Membranes were stained with Ponceau S for 5 min and then washed with water. Binding Specificity Profiles for the PDZ Domains of the LAP Proteins—As we and others have shown, combinatorial peptide libraries can be used to survey the ligand preferences of PDZ domains (38Skelton N.J.

The plateau was most pronounced when the potential landscape was tuned to be symmetric by using low-temperature scanning-probe techniques. Source-drain energy spectroscopy and temperature response support the hypothesis that the origin of the plateau is the spontaneous spin-polarization of the transport electrons: a ferromagnetic phase. Such devices may have applications in the field of spintronics to either generate or detect a spin-polarized current without the complications associated with external magnetic fields or magnetic materials."

https://openalex.org/W1992091012,"Recently, we have demonstrated the phosphorylation- and lipid raft-mediated internalization of the native norepinephrine transporter (NET) following protein kinase C (PKC) activation (Jayanthi, L. D., Samuvel, D. J., and Ramamoorthy, S. (2004) J. Biol. Chem. 279, 19315–19326). Here we tested an hypothesis that PKC-mediated phosphorylation of NET is required for transporter internalization. Phosphoamino acid analysis of 32P-labeled native NETs from rat placental trophoblasts and heterologously expressed wild type human NET (WT-hNET) from human placental trophoblast cells revealed that the phorbol ester (β-PMA)-induced phosphorylation of NET occurs on serine and threonine residues. β-PMA treatment inhibited NE transport, reduced plasma membrane hNET levels, and stimulated hNET phosphorylation in human placental trophoblast cells expressing the WT-hNET. Substance P-mediated activation of the Gαq-coupled human neurokinin 1 (hNK-1) receptor coexpressed with the WT-hNET produced effects similar to β-PMA via PKC stimulation. In striking contrast, an hNET double mutant harboring T258A and S259A failed to show NE uptake inhibition and plasma membrane redistribution by β-PMA or SP. Most interestingly, the plasma membrane insertion of the WT-hNET and hNET double mutant were not affected by β-PMA. Although the WT-hNET showed increased endocytosis and redistribution from caveolin-rich plasma membrane domains following β-PMA treatment, the hNET double mutant was completely resistant to these PKC-mediated effects. In addition, the PKC-induced phosphorylation of hNET double mutant was significantly reduced. In the absence of T258A and S259A mutations, alanine substitution of all other potential phosphosites within the hNET did not block PKC-induced phosphorylation and down-regulation. These results suggest that Thr-258 and Ser-259 serve as a PKC-specific phospho-acceptor site and that phosphorylation of this motif is linked to PKC-induced NET internalization.

The presence of NET in lipid rafts suggests that signaling machinery specific to lipid rafts may be linked to PKC-mediated NET down-regulation. The PKC-mediated internalization of NET occurs in parallel to an enhanced phosphorylation of the transporter. However, whether PKC directly phosphorylates NET, and whether NET phosphorylation is required for NE transport regulation remained uninvestigated. Studies using phospho-site mutants of transporters have provided positive as well as negative correlations between phosphorylation and transporter functional regulation (26Bonisch H. Hammermann R.

NET protein contains multiple consensus sites for several kinases, including PKC, that are distinct from those present in DAT or SERT, and therefore, NET may be regulated by mechanisms that are different for those of DAT and SERT. Importantly, studies that demonstrate altered response to second messenger and/or kinase-mediated regulations in human variants of monoamine transporters (30Kilic F. Murphy D.L. Rudnick G. Mol.

In this study, we tested two hypotheses as follows: 1) activation of the Gq-coupled NK1 receptor can mediate PKC-dependent NET down-regulation, and 2) phosphorylation is required for PKC-mediated NET internalization. The results from the present study demonstrate that in HTR cells expressing the WT-hNET and the hNK-1 receptor, PKC-activation enhances NET internalization and phosphorylation. To further investigate the relationship between PKC-mediated NET phosphorylation and NE transport regulation, we sought to identify the changes in NE transport regulation and phosphorylation of NET when two specific amino acids that constitute a potential PKC motif on hNET are mutated to nonphosphorylatable alanines. Our results show that alanine substitution of threonine 258 and serine 259 but not other potential phosphosites in the hNET renders the transporter resistant to PKC-mediated phosphorylation and down-regulation and suggest that phosphorylation of this PKC motif is linked to transporter internalization.

Phosphosite mutants of hNET, which include single-site mutants harboring T258A or S259A, the double mutant harboring T258A and S259A in intracellular loop 2 (ICL2), the multisite mutant (N′ + C′ + S502A) harboring T19A, T30A, T58A (in the N terminus), S579A, T580A, S583A (in the C terminus) along with S502A (in ICL5), and the other multisite mutants (N′+ C′+ S502A/T258A/S259A) harboring T19A, T30A, T58A, S579A, T580A, S583A, S502A, along with T258A and S259A, were generated by PCR based mutagenesis in this background using QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The mutations were confirmed by restriction enzyme mapping and automated sequencing of the entire DNA sequences on both strands. Cell Cultures and Transfections—Isolation and culture of rat placental trophoblasts were performed essentially as described earlier (1Jayanthi L.D. Samuvel D.J. Ramamoorthy S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 19315-19326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). HTR cells were cultured in a mixture of RPMI 1640 (Mediatech-Cellgro, VA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and penicillin (100 units/ml)/streptomycin (100 μg/ml). Cells seeded in 24-well cell culture plates (100,000 cells/well) or 12-well plates (200,000 cells/dish or well) were allowed to grow in an atmosphere of 95% air, 5% CO2 and used for the experiments. In single DNA transfections, HTR cells were transiently transfected with WT-hNET cDNA or mutant hNET cDNAs (0.5 μg of WT-hNET or hNET mutants/well in 24-well plates and 1 μg of hNET or hNET mutants/well in 12-well plates) at a 1:1 DNA ratio using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Diagnostics). In cotransfections, HTR cells were transfected with WT-hNET cDNA plus hNK-1 receptor cDNA in pCIN4 vector (28Granas C. Ferrer J. Loland C.J. Javitch J.A. Gether U. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 4990-5000Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) or mutant hNET cDNAs plus hNK-1 receptor cDNA (0.25 μg of WT-hNET or hNET mutants plus 0.25 μg of hNK-1 receptor/well in 24-well plates and 0.5 μg of hNET or hNET mutants plus 0.5 μg of hNK-1 receptor/well in 12-well plates). The amount of hNET double mutant cDNA was doubled in some transfections to equalize mutant transporter expression level with that of WT-hNET as indicated elsewhere. However, it should be noted that the expression levels were similar but not identical. Cell cultures were maintained for 24 h prior to transfections and grown for 48 h prior to experiments. Phosphoamino Acid Analysis—Rat placental trophoblasts and HTR cells transfected with the WT-hNET were metabolically labeled with 32P as described before (1Jayanthi L.D. Samuvel D.J. Ramamoorthy S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 19315-19326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Metabolically labeled cells were treated with 0.5 μm β-PMA and 32P-labeled NETs from rat placental trophoblasts or 32P-labeled hNET from HTR cells were isolated by immunoprecipitations with NET-specific antibody as described previously (1Jayanthi L.D. Samuvel D.J. Ramamoorthy S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 19315-19326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Immunoisolated 32P-labeled NETs were subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (acid base-resistant; Immobilon). Following autoradiography of blots, phosphorylated NET bands were excised out and pooled from three separate experiments before hydrolyzing with 5.7 m HCl at 110 °C for 90 min. The hydrolysates were lyophilized, suspended in pyridine/acetic acid/water (5:50:945), spotted onto cellulose membrane sheets together with phosphoamino acid standards, and separated by high voltage electrophoresis (950 V for 1 h). Locations of standards were identified by ninhydrin staining and phosphoamino acids from NET by autoradiography. Treatments and NE Uptake Assays—Transfected HTR cells were treated with the vehicle or β-PMA (0.5 μm) or SP (0.25 μm) or β-PMA plus SP for 30 min at 37 °C. Other treatments with various reagents were performed where indicated. Uptake measurements were performed by incubating the cells for 10 min at 37 °C with [3H]NE (35.0 Ci/mmol l-[7,8-3H]norepinephrine; Amersham Biosciences) in 0.5 ml of Krebs-Ringer-HEPES (KRH) buffer, pH 7.4 (120 mm NaCl, 4.7 mm KCl, 2.2 mm CaCl2, 10 mm HEPES, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 1.2 mm KH2PO4, 5 mm Tris, and 10 mm d-glucose), containing 100 μm ascorbic acid and 100 μm pargyline. Assays were terminated by removing the radiolabel and by rapid washings of cells three times with 1 ml of ice-cold KRH buffer. Cells were solubilized in 0.5 ml of 1% SDS, and the accumulated [3H]NE was quantified by liquid scintillation counting (Beckman Coulter Inc.). 50 nm of [3H]NE was used in all experiments except for kinetic studies, where uptake of NE was measured over a concentration of 0.1 to 10 μm NE with 50 nm [3H]NE and the rest substituting with nonradioactive NE. Specific NE uptake was measured by subtracting the NE uptake measured in the presence of 1 μm desipramine from the total NE uptake measured in the absence of desipramine. For kinetic analysis of NE uptake in trophoblasts, the values were plotted as picomoles of NE uptake versus concentration of NE, and the data represent the means ± S.E. from three experiments performed in triplicate on different batches of trophoblast cultures. Substrate Km and Vmax values for NE uptake were determined by nonlinear least square fits (Kaleidagraph, Synergy Software, Reading, PA) with the generalized Michaelis-Menten equation: V=Vmax[S]n/Kmn+[S]n), where V = transport velocity, [S] = substrate (NE) concentration, and n represents the Hill coefficient. Data are represented as the means ± S.E. from three experiments performed in triplicate on different batches of trophoblast cultures. Cell Surface Protein Biotinylation—Cell surface biotinylation and immunoblot analyses were employed (1Jayanthi L.D. Samuvel D.J. Ramamoorthy S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 19315-19326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) to quantify the amount of plasma membrane NET protein. Transfected cells subjected to various treatments were washed and incubated with the cell membrane-impermeable reagent, sulfosuccinimidobiotin (sulfo-NHS-biotin, 1 mg/ml; Pierce) for 1 h at 4 °C in PBS/Ca-Mg (138 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 1.5 mm KH2PO4, 9.6 mm Na2HPO4, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm CaCl2, pH 7.3). The biotinylating agent was removed by incubating twice with ice-cold 100 mm glycine for 30 min at 4 °C. Cells were washed with PBS/Ca-Mg and lysed at 4 °C with 400 μl of RIPA buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate) containing protease inhibitors (1 μm pepstatin A, 250 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin). Lysates were centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, and the supernatants were incubated with monomeric avidin beads for 1 h at room temperature. The beads were washed three times with RIPA buffer, and adsorbed proteins were eluted in 50 μl of Laemmli buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 20% glycerol, 2% SDS, 5% β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.01% bromphenol blue). Aliquots from total cell lysates and unbound fractions (40 μl each) and all (50 μl) of the avidin-bound samples were analyzed by immunoblotting with hNET-antibody. To validate the surface localization of biotinylated NET protein, blots were stripped and reprobed with anti-calnexin antibody (1:1000, StressGen Biotechnologies, Victoria, British Columbia, Canada). Band intensities were quantified using NIH ImageJ (version 1.32j). Exposures were precalibrated to ensure quantitation within the linear range of the film, and multiple exposures were taken to validate linearity of quantitation. Values of total, nonbiotinylated, and surface NET proteins were normalized using levels of calnexin immunoreactivity in total cell extract, and values were averaged across three experiments. NET insertion into the plasma membrane was measured using similar protocols as described before (33Samuvel D.J. Jayanthi L.D. Bhat N.R. Ramamoorthy S. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 29-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) with slight modifications. HTR cells expressing the WT-hNET or the double mutant were washed with PBS/Ca-Mg and incubated twice with 1 mg/ml sulfo-NHS-acetate in PBS/Ca-Mg for 1 h at 4°C (trafficking nonpermissive condition) to block all the free amino groups (34Lee-Kwon W. Kawano K. Choi J.W. Kim J.H. Donowitz M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 16494-16501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). After washing away the sulfo-NHS-acetate with cold PBS/Ca-Mg, the cell membrane-impermeable sulfo-NHS-biotin in PBS/Ca-Mg containing β-PMA or the vehicle (1 mg/ml, prewarmed at 37 °C) was added to the cells and incubated further for the indicated times at 37 °C (trafficking permissive condition). Biotinylated NETs inserted into the plasma membrane (surface) and nonbiotinylated (intracellular) NETs were analyzed as described above. Biotinylated transferrin receptor (TfR) was analyzed by stripping and reprobing the blot with TfR antibody. The accumulation of biotinylated WT-hNET or hNET-DM or TfR at each time point was measured by quantifying the band densities using NIH ImageJ (version 1.32j). To measure NET internalization, reversible biotinylation assays were performed as described (1Jayanthi L.D. Samuvel D.J. Ramamoorthy S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 19315-19326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). HTR cells expressing the WT-hNET or the double mutant were cooled rapidly to 4 °C to inhibit endocytosis by washing with cold PBS and surface-biotinylated with disulfide-cleavable biotin sulfosuccinimidyl-2(biotinamido)ethyl-1,3-dithiopropionate (sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin, 1 mg/ml; Pierce), and free biotinylating reagent was removed by quenching with glycine. NET endocytosis was initiated by incubating the cells with prewarmed media containing β-PMA or the vehicle for indicated times at 37 °C. At the end of each time point, the reagents were removed, and fresh pre-chilled media were added to stop the endocytosis. The cells were then washed and incubated twice with 250 μm sodium 2-mercaptoethane-sulfonate (MesNa; Sigma), a reducing agent, in PBS/Ca-Mg for 20 min to dissociate the biotin from cell surface-resident proteins via disulfide exchange. To define total biotinylated NETs, one dish of biotinylated cells was not subjected to reduction with MesNa and was directly processed for extraction followed by isolation by avidin beads. To define MesNa-accessible NETs, another dish of cells was treated with MesNa immediately (at 0 time) following biotinylation at 4 °C to reveal the quantity of surface NET biotinylation that MesNa can reverse efficiently. At the end of the treatments, cells were solubilized in RIPA, and biotinylated NETs were separated from nonbiotinylated proteins by using monomeric avidin beads. Biotinylated proteins were eluted from the beads and resolved by SDS-PAGE. NET proteins in the fractions were visualized with hNET antibody as described under “Cell Surface Protein Biotinylation.” NET bands were scanned and the band densities were quantified by NIH ImageJ (version 1.32j). Lipid Raft Isolation—Lipid rafts were isolated from vehicle- or β-PMA-treated cells essentially using the same protocol described earlier (1Jayanthi L.D. Samuvel D.J. Ramamoorthy S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 19315-19326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 35Becher A. White J.H. McIlhinney R.A. J. Neurochem. 2001; 79: 787-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Cells were lysed in 1.5 ml of MBS (25 mm Mes and 150 mm NaCl, pH 6.5) containing 1% Triton X-100 and a mixture of protease inhibitors (1 μm pepstatin A, 250 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin) using a Dounce homogenizer with 10 up and down strokes at 4 °C. Equal volumes of 80% (w/v) sucrose in MBS were added to the homogenates. Cell lysates in 40% sucrose were placed at the bottom of SW41 centrifuge tubes and overlaid successively with 4 ml of 30% sucrose and 3 ml of 5% sucrose. The tubes were centrifuged at 188,000 × g for 18 h at 4 °C, and 1-ml fractions were collected from the top. Equal volumes of collected fractions were subjected to 4–15% linear gradient SDS-PAGE. After transfer to polyvinylidene difluoride Immobilon-P transfer membrane, the presence of NET and caveolin were visualized by immunoblotting with specific antibodies. Metabolic Labeling and Immunoprecipitation (Phosphorylation Assay)—Transfected cells were incubated at 37 °C in phosphate-free DMEM for 1 h and then with 1 mCi/ml of carrier-free [32P]orthophosphate (Amersham Biosciences) for 2 h (1Jayanthi L.D. Samuvel D.J. Ramamoorthy S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 19315-19326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The vehicle or β-PMA (0.5 μm) or SP (0.25 μm) was added to the medium, and the incubation was continued at 37 °C for 30 min. Cells were washed with cold PBS and lysed in 400 μl of RIPA buffer containing protease inhibitors (1 μm pepstatin A, 250 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin) and phosphatase inhibitors (10 mm NaF, 50 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and 1 μm of okadaic acid). Extracts were centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, and the supernatants were precleared using 50 μl of protein G-Sepharose beads (36Ramamoorthy S. Giovanetti E. Qian Y. Blakely R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2458-2466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). NET protein was immunoprecipitated overnight at 4 °C by the addition of anti-His antibody to specifically isolate His-tagged NET proteins and to avoid interference with any endogenous NET if present on end-over-end continuous mixing, followed by 1.5-h incubation with protein G-Sepharose beads (50 μl) at 22 °C (room temperature). The immunoadsorbents were washed with ice-cold RIPA buffer, extracted with 50 μl of Laemmli, and resolved by SDS-PAGE (10%). The radiolabeled proteins were detected by autoradiography, and digitized autoradiograms were evaluated on multiple film exposures to ensure quantitation within the linear range of film exposure. In parallel experiments, immunoprecipitations were carried out using unlabeled cells to ensure that equal NET proteins were immunoprecipitated. Extracts from each sample were immunoprecipitated with anti-His antibody, and the immunoisolates were subjected to urea-based SDS-PAGE and transferred on to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. NET proteins were quantified by immunoblotting with hNET antibody. In Vitro Phosphorylation Assay—In vitro phosphorylation with PKCϵ was performed using membranes prepared from HTR cells expressing the WT, single-site (T258A and S259A) and double-site mutant hNETs. Membranes were prepared as described previously (1Jayanthi L.D. Samuvel D.J. Ramamoorthy S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 19315-19326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 37Karl P.I. Divald A. Biochem. J. 1996; 320: 831-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) and washed twice with PKC assay buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm dithiothreitol). In a total 100-μl PKC assay buffer, 20 μg of membrane proteins (resuspended in PKC assay buffer) were incubated at 30 °C for 30 min with 20 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Biosciences), 100 μm ATP, 200 μg/ml phosphatidylserine, and 20 μg/ml diacylglycerol in the presence or absence of PKCϵ (1 μl). Following phosphorylation, the membranes were solubilized in RIPA buffer containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors, and immunoisolated NET proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography as described above. To ensure equal immunoisolation of NET protein between control and test samples (–PKCϵ and +PKCϵ), parallel immunoprecipitations and immunoblot analyses were carried out using membranes subjected to phosphorylation but without the addition of [γ-32P]ATP. Statistical Analyses—Statistical significances for NE uptake values and band densities were calculated using Student's t test when co"

https://openalex.org/W2114652857,"RL5, a gene coding for a novel polyphenol oxidase, was identified through activity screening of a metagenome expression library from bovine rumen microflora. Characterization of the recombinant protein produced in Escherichia coli revealed a multipotent capacity to oxidize a wide range of substrates (syringaldazine > 2,6-dimethoxyphenol > veratryl alcohol > guaiacol > tetramethylbenzidine > 4-methoxybenzyl alcohol > 2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS) >> phenol red) over an unusually broad range of pH from 3.5 to 9.0. Apparent Km and kcat values for ABTS, syringaldazine, and 2,6-dimetoxyphenol obtained from steady-state kinetic measurements performed at 40 degrees C, pH 4.5, yielded values of 26, 0.43, and 0.45 microm and 18, 660, and 1175 s(-1), respectively. The Km values for syringaldazine and 2,6-dimetoxyphenol are up to 5 times lower, and the kcat values up to 40 times higher, than values previously reported for this class of enzyme. RL5 is a 4-copper oxidase with oxidation potential values of 745, 400, and 500 mV versus normal hydrogen electrode for the T1, T2, and T3 copper sites. A three-dimensional model of RL5 and site-directed mutants were generated to identify the copper ligands. Bioinformatic analysis of the gene sequence and the sequences and contexts of neighboring genes suggested a tentative phylogenetic assignment to the genus Bacteroides. Kinetic, electrochemical, and EPR analyses provide unequivocal evidence that the hypothetical proteins from Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron and from E. coli, which are closely related to the deduced protein encoded by the RL5 gene, are also multicopper proteins with polyphenol oxidase activity. The present study shows that these three newly characterized enzymes form a new family of functional multicopper oxidases with laccase activity related to conserved hypothetical proteins harboring the domain of unknown function DUF152 and suggests that some other of these proteins may also be laccases."
https://openalex.org/W2038088563,"Neuregulin, a growth factor involved in myogenesis, has rapid effects on muscle metabolism. In a manner analogous to insulin and exercise, neuregulins stimulate glucose transport through recruitment of glucose transporters to surface membranes in skeletal muscle. Like muscle contraction, neuregulins have additive effects with insulin on glucose uptake. Therefore, we examined whether neuregulins are involved in the mechanism by which muscle contraction regulates glucose transport. We show that caffeine-induced increases in cytosolic Ca2+ mediate a metalloproteinase-dependent release of neuregulins, which stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation of ErbB4 receptors. Activation of ErbB4 is necessary for Ca2+-derived effects on glucose transport. Furthermore, blockage of ErbB4 abruptly impairs contraction-induced glucose uptake in slow twitch muscle fibers, and to a lesser extent, in fast twitch muscle fibers. In conclusion, we provide evidence that contraction-induced activation of neuregulin receptors is necessary for the stimulation of glucose transport and a key element of energetic metabolism during muscle contraction.

In conclusion, we provide evidence that contraction-induced activation of neuregulin receptors is necessary for the stimulation of glucose transport and a key element of energetic metabolism during muscle contraction. Skeletal muscle is the main tissue responsible for insulin-stimulated glucose utilization in absorptive states (1Zorzano A. Palacín M. Gumà A. Acta Physiol. Scand. 2005; 183: 43-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The rate-limiting step for muscle glucose utilization is glucose transport, which can be rapidly induced by translocation of GLUT4 glucose transporters from intracellular vesicles to the plasma membrane. Contraction and insulin act independently through distinct signaling pathways to induce GLUT4 translocation. Most interestingly, in insulin-resistant states, such as type 2 diabetes, the effects of contraction on glucose uptake are unchanged (2Holloszy J.O. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 284: E453-E467Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 3Rose A.J. Richter E.A. Physiology (Bethesda). 2005; 20: 260-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 4Koistinen H.A. Zierath J.R. Ann. Med. 2002; 34: 410-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Thus, efforts have been made to understand the molecular mechanisms involved in contraction-stimulated glucose uptake. Muscle contraction induces glucose transport by a mechanism involving local factors within the myocyte (3Rose A.J. Richter E.A. Physiology (Bethesda). 2005; 20: 260-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that two main effectors mediate contraction-induced glucose transport, namely activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), 3The abbreviations used are: AMPK, AMP-activated protein kinase; HRG/Hrg, recombinant heregulin-β1-(177–244); CAMKII, Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinase II; EGF, epidermal growth factor; AICAR, 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide-1-β-d-ribofuranoside; ACC, acetyl coenzyme A carboxylase; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase; EDL, extensor digitorum longus; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. a metabolic fuel gauge regulated by cellular energy charge, and transient increases in cytosolic Ca2+ within myofibers, as a consequence of plasma membrane and T-tubule depolarization (3Rose A.J.

Physiol. 2005; 99: 330-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Little is known of the mechanism by which AMPK or Ca2+ leads to glucose uptake, although activation of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CAMKII) has been implicated in Ca2+-induced glucose uptake (6Wright D.C. Geiger P.C. Holloszy J.O. Han D.H. Am. J. Physiol. 2005; 288: E1062-E1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 7Wright D.C. Hucker K.A. Holloszy J.O. Han D.H. Diabetes. 2004; 53: 330-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). Contraction also triggers the activation of neuregulin receptors (8Lebrasseur N.K. Cote G.M. Miller T.A. Fielding R.A. Sawyer D.B. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 284: C1149-C1155Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Neuregulins are growth factors that belong to the epidermal growth factor (EGF) family, and their action is essential for cardiac and skeletal muscle development and function (9Falls D.L. Exp. Cell Res. 2003; 284: 14-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (862) Google Scholar). Neuregulins have traditionally been considered as nerve-derived factors that control acetylcholine receptor synthesis at the neuromuscular junction. In addition, there is growing evidence that they are essential muscle autocrine effectors (see Ref. 10Rimer M. J. Neurocytol. 2003; 32: 665-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar for review). Neuregulins activate ErbB receptors, ErbB2, ErbB3, and ErbB4, which belong to the type I tyrosine kinase receptor family (11Citri A. Skaria K.B. Yarden Y. Exp. Cell Res. 2003; 284: 54-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar, 12Tzahar E. Waterman H. Chen X. Levkowitz G. Karunagaran D. Lavi S. Ratzkin B.J. Yarden Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5276-5287Crossref PubMed Scopus (876) Google Scholar). Binding of neuregulins to ErbB3 and ErbB4 receptors induces receptor dimerization and activation of the tyrosine kinase domain. Although ErbB2 does not bind ligand, it is the preferred receptor for heterodimerization (12Tzahar E. Waterman H. Chen X. Levkowitz G. Karunagaran D. Lavi S. Ratzkin B.J. Yarden Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5276-5287Crossref PubMed Scopus (876) Google Scholar). Previous observations in L6E9 myotubes and incubated skeletal muscle indicated that, similarly to contraction, neuregulins induce glucose transport by translocation of GLUT4 glucose transporters from an intracellular storage compartment to the plasma membrane in an additive manner to the insulin (13Barnes B.R.

Physiol. 1984; 246: E476-E482PubMed Google Scholar). Since neuregulin receptors are activated during contraction (8Lebrasseur N.K. Cote G.M. Miller T.A. Fielding R.A. Sawyer D.B. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 284: C1149-C1155Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that neuregulins could be involved in the regulation of glucose transport by muscle contraction. In the present study, we show that neuregulins are released by a Ca2+-dependent metalloproteinase activity, which causes ErbB receptor phosphorylation. We also provide evidence that neuregulin receptor activation is needed to increase glucose transport in response to muscle contraction.

A polyclonal antibody against GLUT4 (OSCRX, raised against the 15 C-terminal amino acid residues) was produced in our laboratory. Studies in Incubated Skeletal Muscle—Male Wistar rats (100–150 g) were anesthetized with pentobarbital (5–7 mg/100 g of body weight). Extensor digitorum longus (EDL) and soleus muscles were extracted and stripped longitudinally. Muscles were then allowed to recover for 45 min in flasks containing 2 ml of incubation medium (Krebs-Henseleit bicarbonate buffer, including 5 mm HEPES, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 5 mm glucose, and 15 mm mannitol) continuously oxygenated with 95% O2, 5% CO2 in a shaking water bath (35 °C). After recovery, muscles were submitted to treatments specified in the figure legends. Ex Vivo Muscle Contraction—Strips of soleus muscles were placed in a controlled-temperature incubation chamber and immersed in 5 ml of incubation medium with or without recombinant neuregulins (HRG, 5 nm). Muscles were subjected to contraction as described previously (13Barnes B.R. Ryder J.W. Steiler T.L. Fryer L.G. Carling D. Zierath J.R. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 2703-2708Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) and then either frozen immediately to obtain total lysates or further incubated to assess glucose transport activity or cell surface GLUT4 content. In Vivo Muscle Contraction—Male Wistar rats (100–150 g) were anesthetized using 4% isoflurane and maintained at 2%. EDL and soleus muscles from each leg were injected with 50 μl of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, as vector), anti-ErbB3 blocking antibody (3 μg), anti-ErbB4 blocking antibody (3 μg), or HRG (0.8 pmol, final concentration 5 nm). After 20 min, the right leg was made to contract in situ by sciatic nerve electric stimulation (trains of 500 ms of supramaximal voltage, 7 V, were delivered at a rate of 1/s; each pulse in the train lasted 0.1 ms, and pulses were delivered at 100 Hz) for 2 × 5-min bouts separated by a 1 min rest (14Richter E.A. Garetto L.P. Goodman M.N. Ruderman N.B. Am. J. Physiol. 1984; 246: E476-E482PubMed Google Scholar). The left leg was used as a control. During contraction, the tendons of plantaris and gastrocnemius muscles were intact, and the ankle was left free. Thereafter, muscle strips were immediately extracted and incubated for 2-deoxyglucose transport or frozen to obtain proteic lysates for assessment of the metabolic parameters. Glucose Uptake Measurements—After treatments, muscles were rinsed for 10 min (ex vivo experiments) or 20 min (in vivo experiments) in oxygenated Krebs-Henseleit bicarbonate buffer with 5 mm HEPES, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, and 20 mm mannitol. Muscles were then transferred to vials containing 2-deoxy-[2,6,3H]glucose (1 mm, 2.5 μCi/ml) and [14C]mannitol (19 mm, 0.7 μCi/ml) and incubated for 20 min. Muscles were frozen, weighed, and digested in 1 ml of 0.5 n NaOH. Digested muscles were processed as described previously (15Cantó C. Suárez E. Lizcano J.M. Griñó E. Shepherd P.R. Fryer L.G.

Plasma Membrane GLUT4 Levels Assessed by Photolabeling—Cell surface GLUT 4 content was determined by photolabeling using a method derived from Koumanov et al. (16Koumanov F. Yang J. Jones A.E. Hatanaka Y. Holman G.D. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 1209-1215Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Briefly, after treatment, muscles were rinsed in Krebs-Henseleit bicarbonate buffer, 20 mm mannitol, for 8 min. Muscles were placed in 35-mm polystyrene culture dishes containing 1 ml of the rinse medium containing 0.2 mm of a cell-impermeable biotinylated photoaffinity compound that labels glucose transporters (Bio-LC-ATB-BGPA, 4,4′-O-(2-(2-(2-(2-(2-(6-(Biotinylamino) hexanoyl) amino) ethoxy)-ethoxy)ethoxy)-4-(1-azi-2,2,2, trifluoroethyl)benzoyl)amino-1,3-propanediyl-bis-d-glucose), donated by Dr. Geoffrey D. Holman, University of Bath, UK. Muscles were incubated for 8 min at 18 °C in the dark to slow down membrane traffic. The dish was gently shaken every 2–3 min. Thereafter, muscles were transferred to another dish with 1 ml of rinse medium containing the photolabeling reagent and then irradiated for 6 min in a Rayonet photochemical reactor, using 300 nm lamps, to fix the reagent to GLUT4 transporters. Muscles were trimmed of tendons, frozen, and stored at −80 °C. The total lysate (300 μg) from each muscle was immunoprecipitated with 30 μl of streptavidin-agarose beads (Pierce), and GLUT4 levels were detected by Western blot analysis. Total Muscle Lysates, Immunoprecipitation, and Western Blot—All these procedures were performed essentially as described previously (15Cantó C. Suárez E. Lizcano J.M. Griñó E. Shepherd P.R.

For total lysates, a frozen muscle strip was collected in an Eppendorf tube placed on ice and pulverized with an Eppendorf homogenizer. Then, 200 μl of ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 50 mm sodium fluoride, containing freshly added protease inhibitors, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μm leupeptin, and 1 μm pepstatin), was added, and muscles were further homogenized. The homogenates were diluted to a final volume of 25 μl/mg of muscle by the addition of lysis buffer. Homogenates were mixed in an orbital shaker from 30 min to 1 h at 4°C and then centrifuged at maximal speed in an Eppendorf centrifuge (∼13,000 rpm) for 10 min at 4 °C. The pellet was discarded, and supernatant was collected and stored at −80 °C until used. Protein levels were measured by the Bradford method. Samples were immunoprecipitated to identify ErbB2, ErbB3, ErbB4, and insulin receptor phosphorylation levels by conjugating 30 μl of protein G-Sepharose beads with 2–5 μg of the corresponding polyclonal antibody (except for ErbB4, which was monoclonal) for 1 h at 4 °C and then washing twice in lysis buffer and incubating with 0.5–1 mg of protein lysate overnight with constant shaking at 4 °C. After brief centrifugation, the supernatant was discarded. The pellet was washed several times in the lysis buffer and boiled with 50 μl of Laemmli sample buffer (LBS) for Western blot analysis using a monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine antibody or polyclonal ErbB4 antibody to determine phosphorylated or total ErbB4 content. For Western blot assays, protein samples containing LSB were subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes as described previously (15Cantó C. Suárez E. Lizcano J.M. Griñó E. Shepherd P.R. Fryer L.G. Carling D. Bertran J. Palacín M. Zorzano A. Gumà A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 12260-12268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Total muscle lysates (200 μg for p-CAMKII, p-AMPK, and p-ACC; 10 μg for GLUT4; and 5 μg for β-actin) were used for immunoblot detection. Measurement of Neuregulin Release—Incubation medium (1 ml) was complemented with protease inhibitors (0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μm leupeptin, and 1 μm pepstatin), incubated with 5 μg of a biotinylated antibody against the extracellular domain of neuregulins (Ab1) for 2 h, and then immunoprecipitated with streptavidin beads. Western blot analysis was performed with an antibody against the conserved EGF region of neuregulins (Ab2). Measurement of Glycogen, ATP, Phosphocreatine, and Lactate Muscle Levels—Measurements were performed as described previously (18Goodman M.N. Berger M. Ruderman N.B. Diabetes. 1974; 23: 881-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Statistical Analysis—All values are presented as means ± S.E. Differences between two groups were assessed using unpaired two-tailed t-tests. Analysis of variance, assessed by Bonferonni's multiple comparison test, was used to compare more than two groups. Muscle Contraction Induces ErbB Receptors Phosphorylation by a Ca2+-dependent Pathway—To explore the involvement of neuregulins in regulation of glucose transport by muscle contraction, we first examined the effects of ex vivo electrically stimulated muscle contraction on tyrosine phosphorylation of neuregulin receptors. Contraction stimulated phosphorylation of ErbB4 and ErbB2 but not ErbB3 receptors (Fig. 1A). This is consistent with the finding that an in vitro exposure of skeletal muscle to saturating exogenous neuregulins induced tyrosine phosphorylation of ErbB4 and ErbB2 but only induced weak phosphorylation of ErbB3 (Fig. 1, A and B) (15Cantó C. Suárez E. Lizcano J.M. Griñó E. Shepherd P.R. Fryer L.G. Carling D. Bertran J. Palacín M. Zorzano A. Gumà A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 12260-12268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). These results indicated that ErbB2 and ErbB4 are the main neuregulin receptors in adult skeletal muscle. The addition of neuregulins to resting muscles did not increase phosphorylation of AMPK or CAMKII (Fig. 1A), indicating that these kinases are not downstream targets of neuregulin action. Therefore, we tested whether induction of ErbB receptor phosphorylation during contraction was caused by AMPK activation or by increases in cytosolic Ca2+. Incubation of soleus muscle with AICAR, an AMPK activator, did not induce ErbB receptor phosphorylation, whereas caffeine treatment at a concentration that induces Ca2+ release to subcontractile levels (6Wright D.C. Geiger P.C. Holloszy J.O. Han D.H. Am. J. Physiol. 2005; 288: E1062-E1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 7Wright D.C. Hucker K.A. Holloszy J.O. Han D.H. Diabetes. 2004; 53: 330-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar) mimicked contraction effects on ErbB receptor phosphorylation (Fig. 1B). No effect was observed on ErbB3 phosphorylation in response to caffeine unless the ErbB4 ligand-binding domain was blocked with specific antibodies (data not shown). To test whether the effects of caffeine on ErbB phosphorylation were specific to Ca2+ release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, we pretreated isolated soleus muscles with dantrolene to block Ca2+ release through the ryanodine receptors. Dantrolene abrogated caffeine-induced ErbB4 phosphorylation, which was restored by the addition of exogenous neuregulins (Fig. 1C), indicating that dantrolene did not affect ErbB4 phosphorylation in an unspecific manner. The Ca2+ effects on ErbB4 phosphorylation were independent of CAMKII activity since incubation of muscle with KN93, a specific CAMKII inhibitor, did not prevent caffeine-induced ErbB4 phosphorylation (Fig. 1C). Furthermore, when analyzing muscle incubation medium during caffeine treatment, we detected a bioactive extracellular fragment of neuregulin (40–45 kDa). Caffeine-induced neuregulin release was prevented by dantrolene, but not by KN93 (Fig. 1C), indicating that an increase of cytosolic Ca2+, but not CAMKII activation, was involved in this process. Since membrane metalloproteinases are the main neuregulin-shedding enzymes (19Montero J.C. Yuste L. Diaz-Rodriguez E. Esparis-Ogando A. Pandiella A. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2000; 16: 631-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 20Seals D.F. Courtneidge S.A. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 7-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (898) Google Scholar) and their activity is modulated by Ca2+ levels (20Seals D.F. Courtneidge S.A. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 7-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (898) Google Scholar), the above results prompted us to hypothesize that increases in cytosolic Ca2+ could lead to a metalloproteinase-dependent shedding of neuregulins, which would induce ErbB4 phosphorylation. GM6001, a wide range metalloproteinase inhibitor, abolished caffeine-induced ErbB4 phosphorylation and this effect was restored by the addition of exogenous neuregulins (Fig. 1D), indicating that GM6001 did not affect ErbB4 phosphorylation in an unspecific manner. ADAM17 (also known as tumor necrosis factor-α-converting enzyme) is a main neuregulin metalloproteinase (19Montero J.C. Yuste L. Diaz-Rodriguez E. Esparis-Ogando A. Pandiella A. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2000; 16: 631-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), but its specific inhibitor, TAPI-2, only partially blocked caffeine-induced ErbB4 phosphorylation (Fig. 1D). Caffeine-induced neuregulin release was also inhibited in muscles incubated with GM6001, although only partially blocked by TAPI-2 (Fig. 1D). Our results cannot exclude the possibility that tumor necrosis factor-α-converting enzyme could be mainly responsible for calcium-induced neureugulin release since the partial effects observed when using TAPI-2 could be a consequence of compensatory activities elicited by redundant metalloproteinases (20Seals D.F. Courtneidge S.A. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 7-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (898) Google Scholar). To further demonstrate that only neuregulins, and no other product of Ca2+-dependent metalloproteinase action, were responsible for ErbB4 phosphorylation, we incubated soleus muscles with an ErbB4 blocking antibody or a neuregulin antibody that recognizes the conserved bioactive EGF domain. In both situations, caffeine-induced ErbB4 phosphorylation was totally abolished. The addition of exogenous neureugulins did not restore ErbB4 phosphorylation when ErbB4 ligand-binding domain was blocked and only slightly restored phosphorylation when sequestering neuregulins by the use of specific antibodies (Fig. 1E), probably because high concentrations of exogenous neuregulins were added. In no case was neuregulin release compromised (Fig. 1E). Collectively, these results indicate that contraction induces ErbB4 phosphorylation through Ca2+-dependent metalloproteinase activity that leads to neuregulin shedding. Activation of ErbB4 Is Required for the Ca2+-dependent Stimulation of Glucose Transport—We next explored whether ErbB4 phosphorylation had a role in the induction of glucose transport during contraction. First, we evaluated the impact of ErbB4 ligand-binding domain blockage on glucose transport induced by increases in cytosolic Ca2+ or AMPK activation. ErbB4 blockage impaired neuregulin- and caffeine-induced glucose transport in incubated soleus muscle (Fig. 2A). Insulin action was unaffected under ErbB4 blockage, indicating that antibodies against ErbB4 did not have unspecific effects on glucose transport (Fig. 2A). In contrast, treatment with specific antibodies that induce ErbB3 blockage did not affect neuregulin- or caffeine-induced glucose transport in soleus muscle (Fig. 2B). Therefore, ErbB4, but not ErbB3, is involved in the regulation of Ca2+-dependent stimulation of glucose uptake in soleus muscle. Consistent with previous reports (6Wright D.C. Geiger P.C. Holloszy J.O. Han D.H. Am. J. Physiol. 2005; 288: E1062-E1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 21Ai H. Ihlemann J. Hellsten Y. Lauritzen H.P. Hardie D.G. Galbo H. Ploug T. Am. J.

Physiol. 2001; 281: E335-E340Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), AICAR increased glucose uptake in EDL muscle but not in soleus (data not shown). Thus, we tested the impact of ErbB4 blockage on AICAR-induced glucose uptake. Although ErbB4 blocking antibodies impaired neuregulin- and caffeine-induced glucose uptake, AICAR action remained unaffected (Fig. 2C). In addition, caffeine-induced CAMKII phosphorylation was unaffected by ErbB4 blockage in soleus or EDL muscles (Fig. 2, A and C), indicating that the impairment in glucose uptake by ErbB4 blockage was unrelated to impaired Ca2+ release. We next tested whether inhibitors that impair caffeine-induced ErbB4 phosphorylation also affect caffeine-induced glucose transport. As reported elsewhere (6Wright D.C. Geiger P.C. Holloszy J.O. Han D.H. Am. J. Physiol. 2005; 288: E1062-E1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 7Wright D.C. Hucker K.A. Holloszy J.O. Han D.H. Diabetes. 2004; 53: 330-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar), we show that dantrolene inhibited caffeine-induced glucose uptake, but this effect was not restored by adding exogenous neuregulins (Fig. 3A), indicating that Ca2+-derived effectors, other than neuregulins, are necessary for the induction of glucose uptake. GM6001 also blocked caffeine-induced glucose uptake, and the addition of exogenous neuregulins prevented the GM6001 effect on glucose uptake (Fig. 3B). These data indicate that GM6001 inhibition of caffeine-induced glucose uptake relies exclusively on the impairment of neuregulin release. Interestingly, upon the addition of exogenous neuregulins, the caffeine effect on glucose uptake improved ∼3-fold. Thus, the enhancement of ErbB4 signaling during caffeine action by the exogenous addition of neuregulins greatly improves glucose uptake. Similar results for glucose uptake were obtained when exogenous neuregulins were added during ex vivo contraction. These glucose transport responses correlated with improved GLUT4 recruitment to plasma membranes (Fig. 4).FIGURE 4Neuregulin addition increases ex vivo contraction effects on glucose transport and GLUT4 recruitment at the plasma membrane. Strips of soleus muscles were incubated with neuregulins (Hrg, 5 nm, 90 min) and/or subjected to ex vivo contraction (Cont) for 10 min. 2-Deoxyglucose uptake and cell surface GLUT4 was expressed as mean ± S.E., whereas total and plasma membrane (PM) GLUT4 content is shown as a representative image, from n = 5 muscles per group. * indicates statistical significant difference for contraction + HRG versus contraction and HRG alone at p < 0.001.

As a control, muscles were injected with PBS (vehicle used to dilute the antibodies) or with anti-ErbB3 blocking antibodies. The addition of an ErbB4 blocking antibody inhibited contraction-induced ErbB4 phosphorylation 86% in soleus and 91% in EDL muscles with a concomitant 71 and 36% impairment in contraction-induced glucose uptake, respectively. In contrast, contraction effect on glucose uptake was unaltered by either PBS or the ErbB3 blocking antibodies (Fig. 5, A and B). In all cases, phosphorylation of CAMKII was unaffected by ErbB4 blockage. Moreover, AMPK phosphorylation during contraction increased when ErbB4 was blocked, and AMPK phosphorylation correlated with an increase in its activity, as measured by phosphorylation of acetyl coenzyme A carboxylase (ACC) (Fig. 5, C and D). Accordingly, blockage of ErbB4 led to a greater decrease of glycogen, ATP, and phosphocreatine level during contraction, paralleled by an increase in intracellular lactate level (Table 1). This indicates that muscle energy metabolism is altered under these circumstances. Neuregulin effects on glucose uptake are not secondary to an altered muscle metabolism, and under resting conditions, injection of exogenous neuregulins (5 nm) to soleus and EDL muscles induced glucose uptake without altering the levels of energy metabolites (Table 2). Exogenous neuregulins did not improve in vivo sciatic-stimulated contraction effects on glucose uptake, probably because in vivo contraction elicited a maximal increase in ErbB4 phosphorylation (Fig. 6), whereas caffeine or ex vivo contraction of incubated skeletal muscle only led to a submaximal increase in phosphorylation.TABLE 1Effects of ErbB4 blockage on intramuscular glycogen, ATP, phosphocreatine, and lactate levels in contracting musclesPBSAnti-ErbB3Anti-ErbB4SoleusGlycogenNC66.3 ± 1.565.2 ± 2.668.1 ± 2.9C46.9 ± 1.748.9 ± 1.933.6 ± 1.4aIndicates statistical difference at p < 0.05 versus the corresponding contractile (C) or non-contractile (NC) groups.ATPNC21.4 ± 0.721.6 ± 0.821.2 ± 0.6C16.4 ± 0.516.7 ± 1.011.8 ± 0.9aIndicates statistical difference at p < 0.05 versus the corresponding contractile (C) or non-contractile (NC) groups.PhosphocreatineNC63.8 ± 2.164.7 ± 1.462.6 ± 1.4C48.8 ± 1.448.8 ± 1.830.7 ± 2.3aIndicates statistical difference at p < 0.05 versus the corresponding contractile (C) or non-contractile (NC) groups.LactateNC7.2 ± 0.37.0 ± 0.37.7 ± 0.6C10.6 ± 0.510.0 ± 0.313.6 ± 1.3aIndicates statistical difference at p < 0.05 versus the corresponding contractile (C) or non-contractile (NC) groups.EDLGlycogenNC97.4 ± 3.699.6 ± 3.2100.8 ± 4.0C59.3 ± 3.358.1 ± 3.841.3 ± 4.1aIndicates statistical difference at p < 0.05 versus the corresponding contractile (C) or non-contractile (NC) groups.ATPNC26.9 ± 0.525.4 ± 0.627.9 ± 1.0C17.1 ± 0.716.4 ± 0.513.0 ± 1.6aIndicates statistical difference at p < 0.05 versus the corresponding contractile (C) or non-contractile (NC) groups.PhosphocreatineNC81.0 ± 1.879.9 ± 1.380.5 ± 1.9C47.0 ± 1.647.1 ± 2.428.3 ± 2.6aIndicates statistical difference at p < 0.05 versus the corresponding contractile (C) or non-contractile (NC) groups.LactateNC9.4 ± 0.69.8 ± 0.49.3 ± 0.8C13.8 ± 0.813.4 ± 0.419.9 ± 1.8aIndicates statistical difference at p < 0.05 versus the corresponding contractile (C) or non-contractile (NC) groups.a Indicates statistical difference at p < 0.05 versus the corresponding contractile (C) or non-contractile (NC) groups.

This study provides new insights into the mechanism by which contraction regulates glucose uptake and implicates neuregulins in this process. This novel role of neuregulin action may explain why neuregulin receptor expression is not confined to the neuromuscular junction in skeletal muscle, as was first described (24Zhu X. Lai C. Thomas S. Burden S.J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5842-5848Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), but also enriched in the transverse tubular system (25Ozcelik C. Erdmann B. Pilz B. Wettschureck N. Britsch S.

Although two types of receptor, ErbB3 and ErbB4, bind neuregulins, several lines of evidence suggest that only ErbB4 mediates glucose uptake during contraction. First, in vitro induced contraction stimulated ErbB4, but not ErbB3, tyrosine phosphorylation levels. Second, saturating concentrations of neuregulins have little effect on ErbB3 phosphorylation levels when compared with the effects on ErbB4 in incubated soleus muscle (15Cantó C. Suárez E. Lizcano J.M. Griñó E. Shepherd P.R. Fryer L.G. Carling D. Bertran J. Palacín M. Zorzano A. Gumà A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 12260-12268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Third, when ErbB4 receptors were blocked by the use of specific antibodies, caffeine slightly induced ErbB3 receptor phosphorylation, but under these circumstances, caffeine did not induce glucose uptake in soleus muscle. Fourth, blockage of ErbB3 receptors did not impair the stimulation of glucose uptake in any of the conditions tested. In this study, we demonstrate that neuregulins are necessary, but not sufficient, effectors for Ca2+ signaling to induce glucose uptake in skeletal muscle. Based on the use of specific inhibitors (3Rose A.J. Richter E.A. Physiology (Bethesda). 2005; 20: 260-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 6Wright D.C. Geiger P.C. Holloszy J.O. Han D.H.

Diabetes. 2004; 53: 330-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar), CAMKII also appears to be needed for the Ca2+-dependent regulation of glucose uptake. However, inhibition of CAMKII does not affect ErbB4 phosphorylation. Thus, inhibition of either of these pathways does not influence activation of the other but does compromise the Ca2+-induced glucose uptake. Furthermore, our results show that AMPK-induced glucose uptake is independent of neuregulin action. AMPK does not induce phosphorylation of ErbB receptors, and its action on glucose uptake is unaltered by ErbB4 blockage. These results further support the view that Ca2+/neuregulins and AMPK stimulate glucose transport through independent signaling pathways (Fig. 7). In light of these observations, the results obtained from in vivo blockage of ErbB4 are consistent with previous data indicating that contraction-induced glucose transport in slow twitch muscle fibers relies primarily on Ca2+-dependent mechanisms since blockage of ErbB4 had more dramatic effects on glucose uptake in soleus than in EDL muscles. In fact, soleus muscle displays higher protein levels (∼40%) of ErbB4 than EDL muscle in a total membrane fraction. 4C. Cantó and A. Gumà, unpublished observation. Activation of AMPK induces glucose uptake in fast twitch fibers and may compensate for the defects in Ca2+-dependent pathways. Thus, the effect of ErbB4 blockage on contraction-induced glucose uptake could be partially blunted in EDL muscles. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that the different effects of ErbB4 blockage on contraction-induced glucose uptake observed between soleus and EDL muscles was dependent on the mode of contraction elicited since the soleus muscle was subjected to concentric contractions and the EDL was subjected to eccentric contractions. Our results implicating ErbB4 activity in mediating contraction-induced glucose uptake challenge a recent study in which chemical inhibitors were used to exclude tyrosine kinases from this process (29Wright D.C. Geiger P.C. Han D.H. Holloszy J.O. Am. J. Physiol. 2006; 290: E123-E128Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). However, in that study, tyrosine kinase inhibitors only partially affected insulin action at the timing and concentrations used; thus, other tyrosine kinase receptors such as ErbB4 and ErbB2 are likely to sustain enough activity to modulate glucose uptake. Moreover, in rat fast twitch epitrochlearis muscle, AMPK partially compensates for deficiencies in other signaling pathways leading to stimulation of glucose uptake. Our observation showing that neuregulins mediate contraction-induced glucose uptake clarify previous data reporting the additive effects of neuregulins and insulin on glucose uptake in skeletal muscle and L6E9 myotubes (17Suárez E.

Although ex vivo contraction-induced glucose uptake seems to be mediated by a PI3K-independent pathway (30Lund S. Holman G.D. Schmitz O. Pedersen O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In conclusion, these studies provide evidence for the involvement of the growth factor neuregulin in the regulation of glucose uptake in skeletal muscle in response to contraction.

https://openalex.org/W2077547763,"Peptide:N-glycanase (PNGase) is the deglycosylating enzyme, which releases N-linked glycan chains from N-linked glycopeptides and glycoproteins. Recent studies have revealed that the cytoplasmic PNGase is involved in the degradation of misfolded/unassembled glycoproteins. This enzyme has a Cys, His, and Asp catalytic triad, which is required for its enzymatic activity and can be inhibited by “free” N-linked glycans. These observations prompted us to investigate the possible use of haloacetamidyl derivatives of N-glycans as potent inhibitors and labeling reagents of this enzyme. Using a cytoplasmic PNGase from budding yeast (Png1), Man9GlcNAc2-iodoacetoamide was shown to be a strong inhibitor of this enzyme. The inhibition was found to be through covalent binding of the carbohydrate to a single Cys residue on Png1, and the binding was highly selective. The mutant enzyme in which Cys191 of the catalytic triad was changed to Ala did not bind to the carbohydrate probe, suggesting that the catalytic Cys is the binding site for this compound. Precise determination of the carbohydrate attachment site by mass spectrometry clearly identified Cys191 as the site of covalent attachment. Molecular modeling of N,N′-diacetylchitobiose (chitobiose) binding to the protein suggests that the carbohydrate binding site is distinct from but adjacent to that of Z-VAD-fmk, a peptide-based inhibitor of this enzyme. These results suggest that cytoplasmic PNGase has a separate binding site for chitobiose and other carbohydrates, and haloacetamide derivatives can irreversibly inhibit that catalytic Cys in a highly specific manner.

Because those discoveries, this enzyme has been widely used as a powerful tool reagent for analyzing the structure and function of N-linked glycan chains on glycoproteins.

Among these, the haloacetamidyl-sugar (CHO-XAc) is an attractive compound because it can generate de novo glycoproteins through Cys residues in the target proteins (22Totani K. Matsuo I. Takatani M. Arai M.A. Hagihara S. Ito Y. Glycoconj. J. 2004; 21: 69-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 24Macmillan D. Bill R.M. Sage K.A. Fern D. Flitsch S.L. Chem. Biol. 2001; 8: 133-145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). It can also serve as a specific inhibitor for carbohydrate-processing enzymes, which harbor a catalytic Cys residue, as is the case with the cytoplasmic PNGase. In this study, we explored this possibility using purified yeast PNGase (Png1) and found that these compounds are very strong inhibitors of this enzyme. CHO-XAc was found to be covalently linked to this enzyme, and to our surprise the labeling was specific and under experimental conditions only a monovalent binding to the enzyme was observed, strongly suggesting that the labeling is against a specific Cys residue. This carbohydrate binding occurred with carbohydrates as short as N,N′-diacetylchitobiose (GlcNAc2 or chitobiose), indicating the existence of a binding pocket for chitobiose on Png1. The mutant enzyme in which the catalytic Cys191 was changed to Ala did not bind to CHO-IAc (iodoacetamidyl sugar), suggesting that Cys191 is the binding site for this compound. This hypothesis was further validated by precise analysis of the carbohydrate binding site by mass spectrometry, which unequivocally demonstrated that the catalytic Cys is indeed the binding site. Recently the crystal structures of yeast and mouse PNGases were determined (25Lee J.H. Choi J.M. Lee C. Yi K.J. Cho Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Molecular modeling of chitobiose binding to yeast PNGase suggested the binding site for this carbohydrate, which was distinct from that of Z-VAD-fmk (25Lee J.H. Choi J.M. Lee C. Yi K.J. Cho Y. Proc.

Briefly, a 50-ml overnight culture of Escherichia coli bearing pET28b-PNG1-(His)6 (10Suzuki T. Park H. Hollingsworth N.M. Sternglanz R. Lennarz W.J. J.

Then 5 ml of 0.1 m isopropylthiogalactoside was added to induce the expression of proteins and further cultured for 3 h. After collecting cells by centrifugation, the pellet was resuspended with 25 ml of Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0) containing 1 mm Pefabloc (Roche Diagnostics Corp.) and 0.15 m NaCl, followed by addition of 500 μl of lysozyme (10 mg/ml in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0). After incubation on ice for 30 min, 2.5 ml of 10% Triton X-100 (final 1%), and β-mercaptoethanol (final conc. 10 mm) were added, and further incubated for 20 min on ice. Sonication was performed using VC-750 (Sonics and Materials, Inc., Newtown, CT), 30% maximum power 2 times for 10 s with at least a 1-min interval between sonication treatments. After clearing the solution by centrifugation at 12,000 × g (10 min at 4 °C), the resulting supernatant was filtrated with a syringe driven 0.45-μm filter unit (Millex-HA, Millipore, Carrigtwohill, Co., Cork, Ireland). 10 ml of extract were applied onto a 1-ml HiTrap chelating column, which was precharged with 0.5 ml of the 0.1 m NiCl2. After sample application, the column was washed with 10 ml of buffer A (20 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2), 150 mm NaCl). Elution was performed at a flow rate of 1 ml/min using an AktaPrime (Amersham Biosciences) with a stepwise elution of increasing amounts of buffer B (20 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) 150 mm NaCl with 500 mm imidazole) as follows: 2% buffer B for 5 min, 20% buffer B for 10 min and 100% buffer B for 10 min. Fractions were collected every min, and dithiothreitol and EDTA were added to a final concentration of 5mm and 1 mm, respectively. Fractions were monitored by SDS-PAGE and fractions containing purified PNGase (eluted at 100% buffer B solution) were collected, ultrafiltrated with Nanosep (mol. cutoff, 10K; Pall Gelman Corp., Ann Arbor, MI) in 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2), 150 mm NaCl and 5mm dithiothreitol and used for enzyme assay. The protein content of the final enzyme preparation was determined by CBB staining using bovine serum albumin as a standard. A 0.2 mg/ml solution was used in the enzyme assay. Assay for PNGase—PNGase activity was measured using RNase B (Sigma-Aldrich) as a substrate as described previously (28Suzuki T. Methods. 2005; 35: 360-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Typically, the reaction mixture of 30 μl includes 9 μl of purified Png1 (final, 60 μg/ml), 3 μl of RNase B (final concentration 0.2 mg/ml), and 18 μl of 200 mm MES-NaOH buffer, pH 6.7/10 mm dithiothreitol. The reaction was performed for 3 min at 37 °C and was stopped by adding 2× sample buffer, followed by SDS-PAGE (28Suzuki T. Methods. 2005; 35: 360-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), and quantitated using Multi Gauge ver. 2.2 (Fujifilm Co., Tokyo, Japan). Carbohydrate Probe Binding Assay—For assessing the binding of various carbohydrate-related probes to purified Png1, 5 μl of the enzyme fraction (0.2 mg/ml) or E. coli extract expressing Png1 (2.0 mg/ml protein content quantitated by Coomassie Protein Assay reagent (Pierce)) were added to 4 μl of phosphate-buffered saline buffer containing 10 mm dithiothreitol and 1 μl of the respective carbohydrate probes (final concentration of 50 μm unless indicated otherwise). The reaction was performed at 37 °C and was stopped by adding 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer. The sample was applied to SDS-PAGE or lectin blotting. Effect of Man9GlcNAc2-IAc on Caspase Activity—Caspase Combo II (caspase 2, 3, and 7) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Corp. and was suspended with 25 μl of phosphate-buffered saline (1 unit/μl). Caspase activity was assayed using N-acetyl-Val-Asp-Val-Ala-Asp-p-nitroanilide (Sigma-Aldrich; for caspase 2) or N-acetyl-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-p-nitro-anilide (Sigma-Aldrich, for caspases 3 and 7) in the presence and absence of 50 μm Man9GlcNAc2-IAc, according to the manufacturer's protocol. Also the labeling of Man9GlcNAc2-IAc with these caspases were examined after the incubation of 5 units of enzyme with or without 50 mm Man9GlcNAc2-IAc at 37 °C for 30 min, and the possible mobility shift of the enzymes on SDS-PAGE because the labeling was assayed by silver staining (two-dimensional silver stain II Daiichi, Daiichi Pure Chemicals Co., Tokyo, Japan). Lectin Blotting—Lectin blotting was carried out essentially as described previously for Western blotting (38Suzuki T. Park H. Kwofie M.A. Lennarz W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21601-21607Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). For lectin staining, horseradish peroxidase-labeled Con A (Honen Corp., Tokyo, Japan) or horseradish peroxidase-labeled WGA (EY Laboratories Inc., San Mateo, CA) was used with a dilution of 1:5000. Sample detection was carried out using ECL-plus (Amersham Biosciences). Gels were visualized using LAS-3000 mini (Fujifilm), and the bands detected were quantitated using Multi Gauge ver 2.2. Effects of Various GlcNAc2-related Compounds on Yeast PNGase Activity—Concentration required for 50% inhibition (IC50) of Png1 activity for various GlcNAc2-related compounds (GlcNAc2, GlcNAc2-IAc, GlcNAc2-BrAc, GlcNAc2-ClAc, Man8GlcNAc2-IAc, Man9GlcNAc2-IAc, and Man9GlcNAc2) was determined using varying concentrations of the inhibitors. No preincubation was performed for these compounds and reaction was initiated by adding Png1 in the reaction mixture. PNGase assay was carried out as described above. Identification of the Carbohydrate Binding Site by LC-ESI MS—For identification of the carbohydrate binding cysteine residue, GlcNAc2-IAc (final conc. 50 μm) was reacted with yeast PNGase (70 μgin700 μl) for 30 min, and the mixture was ultrafiltrated with Nanosep (10-kDa molecular mass cutoff) to remove unreacted GlcNAc2-IAc, and the final retentate (400 μl in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0)) was evaporated to dryness. The dried sample was dissolved in 20 μl of 0.5 m Tris-HCl/50 mm dithiothreitol/6 m guanidine HCl, and incubated at room temperature for 1 h. 2 mg of chloropropionamide were added to the solution, and further incubated overnight at room temperature in the dark. The alkylated samples were ultrafiltrated with Nanosep and the buffer was exchanged to 50 mm NH4HCO3.10 μl of modified trypsin (sequence grade; Promega Corp., Madison, WI; dissolved at 0.4 mg/ml with 50 mm acetic acid) were added to the final retentate (200 μl), and the digestion was carried out at 37 °C for 8 h. The reaction was stopped by boiling the solution for 10 min, the reaction mixture was concentrated to 20 μl, and samples were applied to LC-ESI MS. A2-μl aliquot of the tryptic peptides mixture was separated by reverse phase LC on a Cadenza CD-C18 column (2.0 mm × 150 mm, Imtakt, Kyoto, Japan) under the following gradient conditions: Mobile phases were (A) 0.1% formic acid and (B) 0.1% formic acid/80% acetonitrile. Gradient elution was performed from 5 to 50% B over 30 min, and then from 50 to 100% B over 10 min with a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min at 30 °C. The eluates were continuously introduced into an electrospray ionization source (Esquire HCT, Bruker Daltonics) to obtain MS and MS/MS spectra. Computer Modeling of Chitobiose Binding to Png1—AutoDock 3.05 (29Morris G.M. Goodsell D.S. Halliday R.S. Huey R. Hart W.E. Belew R.K. Olson A.J. J. Comput. Chem. 1998; 19: 1639-1662Crossref Scopus (9301) Google Scholar) was used for the docking study using the Lamarckian genetic algorithm (LGA or GA-LS) to search for the global fit of chitobiose into the yeast PNGase structure (PDB ID: 1X3Z) (25Lee J.H. Choi J.M. Lee C. Yi K.J. Cho Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 9144-9149Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The grid map consisted of a 60 by 60 by 60 grid points and the grid spacing was 0.375 Å in each dimension. The grid was centered at the coordinates of the Sγ atom of Cys191. The rest of the parameters were set to default values. After multiple docking iterations, models with the chitobiose locating in the proposed binding site of PNGase (25Lee J.H. Choi J.M. Lee C. Yi K.J. Cho Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 9144-9149Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) were pooled. The model with the lowest binding energy was selected and analyzed in PyMol. Man9GlcNAc2-IAc Acts as a Potent Inhibitor of Png1—Recently convergent synthesis of high mannose-type oligosaccharides and their derivatives were reported (20Matsuo I. Wada M. Manabe S. Yamaguchi Y.

These homogeneous, structurally defined oligosaccharides can be of great use for determining the importance of carbohydrate structure, because subtle differences in glycan structures seem to be critical for the folding and/or degradation of glycoproteins (30Helenius A. Aebi M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 1019-1049Crossref PubMed Scopus (1630) Google Scholar, 31Hebert D.N. Garman S.C. Molinari M.

Sci. 2005; 30: 297-303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Among the oligosaccharide-related compounds synthesized, iodoacetamide derivatives of oligosaccharides may be of particular interest because they can generate a neoglycoprotein through a Cys residue bearing a homogeneous oligosaccharide structure. Furthermore, we noticed that these compounds can also be very specific inhibitors for cytoplasmic PNGase, especially because: (a) the enzyme can be efficiently inhibited by free oligosaccharides because of a high affinity toward PNGase (9Suzuki T. Kitajima K. Inoue Y. Inoue S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15181-15186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), and (b) PNGase has a catalytic Cys residue (1Suzuki T. Park H. Lennarz W.J. Faseb J. 2002; 16: 635-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 13Katiyar S. Suzuki T. Balgobin B.J. Lennarz W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12953-12959Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). To test this hypothesis, we first examined if these compounds can efficiently inhibit the enzyme. As shown in Fig. 2, yeast PNGase (Png1) was strongly inhibited by the addition of Man9GlcNAc2-IAc at a concentration of 50 μm. The cytoplasmic PNGases was shown to be inhibited by alkylating reagents such as iodoacetamide (6Suzuki T. Kitajima K. Emori Y. Inoue Y. Inoue S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6244-6249Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 7Suzuki T. Park H. Kitajima K. Lennarz W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21526-21530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 33Suzuki T. Seko A. Kitajima K. Inoue Y. Inoue S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17611-17618Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but under the experimental conditions (in the presence of 7.5 mm dithiothreitol), the inhibition effect is not significant (Fig. 2). These results indicated that haloacetamidyl sugars such as Man9GlcNAc2-IAc could be very specific inhibitors of the cytoplasmic PNGase. Characterization of the Binding of Haloacetamidyl Sugars to Png1—Next we asked whether these compounds are actually covalently bound to the protein. To evaluate this, SDS-PAGE analysis was performed, as the attachment of Man9GlcNAc2 to the protein was expected to give rise to a distinct migration position. As shown in Fig. 3A, a shift in the elution position of Png1 was observed, which is an indication of carbohydrate attachment to this protein. The reaction is very rapid since at the start of the experiment (i.e. immediately after the addition of Man9GlcNAc2-IAc, sample buffer was added to stop the reaction) attachment of carbohydrate was already observed. Glycosylated Png1 could be detected with Con A staining (Fig. 3B). It is interesting to note that although Png1 contains 14 cysteines, there was only a single reaction product, which is ∼2 kDa higher than the non-glycosylated form on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 3, A and B). These results suggest that only one Cys residue was reactive toward Man9GlcNAc2-IAc. Consistent with this observation, bovine serum albumin was not modified with the carbohydrate under the experimental conditions even after prolonged incubation (Fig. 3, A and B), supporting the idea that the modification with Man9GlcNAc2-IAc is very specific to a single Cys residue in Png1. To further confirm the specificity of Man9GlcNAc2-IAc binding, its"

Ron can acquire oncogenic potential by single point mutations in the kinase domain, and dysregulated Ron signaling has been involved in the development of different human cancers. We have previously shown that ligand-activated Ron recruits the negative regulator c-Cbl, which mediates its ubiquitylation and degradation. Here we report that Ron is ubiquitylated also by the U-box E3 ligase C-terminal Hsc70-interacting protein (CHIP), recruited via chaperone intermediates Hsp90 and Hsc70. Gene silencing shows that CHIP activity is necessary to mediate Ron degradation upon cell treatment with Hsp90 inhibitors geldanamycins. The oncogenic RonM1254T receptor escapes from c-Cbl negative regulation but retains a strong association with CHIP. This constitutively active mutant of Ron displays increased sensitivity to geldanamycins, enhanced physical interaction with Hsp90, and more rapid degradation rate. Cell growth and migration, as well as the transforming potential evoked by RonM1254T, are abrogated upon Hsp90 inhibition. These data highlight a novel mechanism for Ron degradation and propose Hsp90 antagonists like geldanamycins as suitable pharmacological agents for therapy of cancers where altered Ron signaling is involved.

Hunter T. Nature. 2001; 411: 355-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (3143) Google Scholar) and frequently correlates with poor responsiveness to conventional therapies, pointing at RTKs as potential targets for molecule-based cancer therapy (2Bennasroune A.

Am. 2001; 10 (viii): 271-288Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Among the different therapeutic approaches a promising strategy relies on forcing RTKs toward degradative pathways (4Rowinsky E.K. Annu. Rev. Med. 2004; 55: 433-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). The Ron tyrosine kinase, receptor for macrophage-stimulating protein (MSP), is a member of the hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) receptor subfamily (5Wang M.H. Ronsin C. Gesnel M.C. Coupey L. Skeel A. Leonard E.J. Breathnach R. Science. 1994; 266: 117-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 6Gaudino G. Follenzi A. Naldini L. Collesi C. Santoro M. Gallo K.A. Godowski P.J. Comoglio P.M. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3524-3532Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Ron is expressed in a variety of human tissues, and the engagement by its cognate ligand activates multiple intracellular signaling pathways controlling normal cell proliferation, migration, and adhesion-dependent survival (7Danilkovitch-Miagkova A.

A single point mutation (M1254T), targeted to a conserved residue of the tyrosine kinase domain is oncogenic (RonM1254T), by increasing kinase efficiency and subverting substrate specificity (10Santoro M.M. Penengo L. Minetto M. Orecchia S. Cilli M. Gaudino G. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 741-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 11Santoro M.M. Penengo L. Orecchia S. Cilli M. Gaudino G. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 5208-5211Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Growing evidence indicates that Ron can be involved in cancer development and progression in humans (12Wang M.H. Wang D. Chen Y.Q. Carcinogenesis. 2003; 24: 1291-1300Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 13Cheng H.L. Liu H.S. Lin Y.J. Chen H.H. Hsu P.Y. Chang T.Y. Ho C.L. Tzai T.S. Chow N.H. Br. J. Cancer. 2005; 92: 1906-1914Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) and in murine models (14Persons D.A. Paulson R.F. Loyd M.R. Herley M.T. Bodner S.M. Bernstein A. Correll P.H. Ney P.A. Nat. Genet. 1999; 23: 159-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 15Peace B.E. Toney-Earley K. Collins M.H. Waltz S.E. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 1285-1293Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Therefore, targeting Ron expression by forcing its down-regulation may help to elucidate its role in tumor development and progression. It has been reported that many kinases that are deregulated in human cancers are dependent on the chaperone activity of the Heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) for their conformational maturation and stability (16Kamal A. Boehm M.F. Burrows F.J. Trends Mol. Med. 2004; 10: 283-290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Hsp90 is a ubiquitous chaperone protein abundantly expressed in mammalian cells, where it performs housekeeping functions assisting in the folding, activation, and assembly of a variety of proteins (17Wegele H. Muller L. Buchner J. Rev. Physiol. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2004; 151: 1-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). Hsp90 functions in concert with several co-chaperone proteins that modulate its chaperone activity (18Siligardi G. Hu B. Panaretou B. Piper P.W. Pearl L.H. Prodromou C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 51989-51998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). The co-chaperone E3 ubiquitin ligase C-terminal Hsc70-interacting protein (CHIP) has been reported to participate in Hsp90 multichaperone complexes, being involved in ubiquitylation and degradation of client proteins (19Connell P. Ballinger C.A. Jiang J. Wu Y. Thompson L.J. Hohfeld J. Patterson C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 93-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar, 20Xu W. Marcu M. Yuan X. Mimnaugh E. Patterson C. Neckers L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 12847-12852Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). Geldanamycins are a class of benzoquinone ansamycin antibiotics, able to compete with ADP/ATP in the nucleotide binding pocket of Hsp90, inhibiting its ATP-dependent chaperone activity and thus directing the ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal degradation of the client proteins (21Stebbins C.E. Russo A.A. Schneider C. Rosen N. Hartl F.U. Pavletich N.P. Cell. 1997; 89: 239-250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1249) Google Scholar, 22Schneider C. Sepp-Lorenzino L. Nimmesgern E.

By leading to depletion of important effector proteins that contribute to deregulated signaling, geldanamycin (GA) and its less toxic derivative 17-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-AAG) exhibit potent anti-tumor activity against human cancer cells, both in vitro and in tumor xenografts (23Basso A.D. Solit D.B. Munster P.N. Rosen N. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 1159-1166Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 24Gorre M.E. Ellwood-Yen K. Chiosis G. Rosen N. Sawyers C.L. Blood. 2002; 100: 3041-3044Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Indeed, based on promising preclinical evaluations, 17-AAG is currently in clinical trials as a single agent or in combination with other chemotherapeutics (25Goetz M.P. Toft D. Reid J. Ames M. Stensgard B. Safgren S. Adjei A.A. Sloan J. Atherton P. Vasile V. Salazaar S. Adjei A. Croghan G. Erlichman C. J. Clin. Oncol. 2005; 23: 1078-1087Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar, 26Workman P. Cancer Lett. 2004; 206: 149-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Sensitivity to benzoquinone ansamycins has been described for several RTKs. It has been reported that treatment of breast and other cancer cells with GA causes rapid ubiquitylation of cell surface HER2/ErbB2 molecules, followed by their proteasome-dependent degradation (27Mimnaugh E.G. Chavany C. Neckers L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22796-22801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). A recent study demonstrated the ability of GA to deplete mature EGFR protein harboring kinase domain mutations (28Shimamura T. Lowell A.M. Engelman J.A. Shapiro G.I. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 6401-6408Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Moreover, geldanamycins have been shown to down-regulate the HGF receptor (Met) and to prevent HGF-mediated tumor cell motility and invasion (29Webb C.P. Hose C.D. Koochekpour S. Jeffers M. Oskarsson M. Sausville E. Monks A. Vande Woude G.F. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 342-349PubMed Google Scholar, 30Xie Q. Gao C.F. Shinomiya N. Sausville E. Hay R. Gustafson M. Shen Y. Wenkert D. Vande Woude G.F. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 3697-3707Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that activated Ron recruits to its multifunctional docking site the negative regulator c-Cbl, which mediates ligand-dependent Ron ubiquitylation and down-regulation, through its E3 ubiquitin ligase activity (31Penengo L. Rubin C. Yarden Y. Gaudino G. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 3669-3679Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Here we report that Ron forms a multichaperone complex containing Hsp90, Hsc70, and the E3 ligase CHIP. We also show that GA and its derivative 17-AAG induce degradation of both precursor and membrane-exposed forms of Ron. This occurs by impairing Ron association with Hsp90 and by promoting CHIP-mediated receptor ubiquitylation. The oncogenic RonM1254T escapes from c-Cbl-mediated negative regulation but is efficiently destabilized by geldanamycins, which hinder growth and migration as well as transforming activity of the oncogenic receptor. Reagents and Antibodies—Geldanamycin, 17-AAG, MG-132, and concanamycin A were purchased from Alexis (Montreal, Canada). Human recombinant MSP was obtained by R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). Polyclonal antibodies against Ron C-terminal domain (c-20) and monoclonal anti-Hsc70 (B-6) were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Monoclonal anti-Hsp90 antibody was from BD Transduction Laboratories; monoclonal anti-α-tubulin (B-5-1-2), anti-phospho-Erk1/2 (MAPK-YT), and anti-FLAG (M2) were from Sigma; polyclonal phospho-Akt (Ser473) was from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA); monoclonal anti-Cbl (7G10) was from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Charlottesville, VA), monoclonal anti-ubiquitin (FK2) was from Stressgen (San Diego, CA); and CHIP rabbit polyclonal antiserum was from Calbiochem (Merck). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse and anti-rabbit were purchased from GE Healthcare (Uppsala, Sweden). Preparation of Plasmid Constructs—pMT2-Ron and pMT2-RonM1254T were described previously (10Santoro M.M. Penengo L. Minetto M. Orecchia S. Cilli M. Gaudino G. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 741-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). c-Cbl, c-Cbl70z, CHIP, CHIPK30A, and CHIPΔU-box were prepared in pcDNA3 (32Ballinger C.A. Connell P. Wu Y. Hu Z. Thompson L.J.

Band (Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA). pCCLsin.PPT.hPGK.GFP.Wpre transfer plasmid was used to express two independent small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) (5′-ACCACGAGGGTGATGAGGA-3′ and 5′-GAAGCGAGATATCCCTGAC-3′), targeting CHIP transcripts or an unrelated sequence as negative control. The expression was under the transcriptional control of the H1 promoter derived from pSUPER plasmid (34Brummelkamp T.R. Bernards R. Agami R. Science. 2002; 296: 550-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (3968) Google Scholar). The vector carries an independent GFP expression cassette, to allow for the identification of transfected cells. Cell Culture and Transfection—Cells were purchased from American Type Culture Collection. FG2 cells were maintained in RPMI 1640, COS-7, and NIH-3T3 cells in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma), supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) in a 5% CO2-humidified atmosphere. NIH-3T3 cells stably expressing Ron or RonM1254T were obtained as described previously (10Santoro M.M. Penengo L. Minetto M. Orecchia S. Cilli M. Gaudino G. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 741-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Transient transfection of COS-7 cells was performed with DEAE-dextran using the CellPhect transfection kit (GE Healthcare). LipofectaminePlus (Invitrogen) was used for transfection of FG2 cells with siRNAs constructs according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—Total cellular proteins were extracted by solubilizing the cells in radioimmune precipitation buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS) containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors (10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and 2 mm sodium fluoride). Whole-cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation (14,000 × g, 10 min), quantified with the BCA protein assay reagent kit (Pierce) and dissolved in Laemmli sample buffer. For immunoprecipitation, cells were lysed in solubilization buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100) with protease inhibitors. 500-μg aliquots of clarified cell lysates were incubated with 1 μg of the indicated antibody immobilized on protein A-Sepharose 4B packed beads (GE Healthcare) for 2 h at 4°C. After extensive washes with lysis buffer, precipitated proteins were dissolved in Laemmli sample buffer. Proteins were resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membrane, and probed with respective antibodies. For ubiquitin immunoblotting, proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, incubated for 30 min in 20 mm Tris-HCl containing 6 m guanidine hydrochloride and 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and then probed with ubiquitin antibodies. Detection was performed by the ECL system (GE Healthcare) and the Chemidoc exposure system (Bio-Rad). Image analysis was performed with Quantity One (Bio-Rad). In Vitro Ubiquitylation Assay—The GST-CHIP and GST-CHIPΔU-box fusion proteins were expressed in E. coli and affinity-purified as described by the manufacturer's protocol. Receptors were immunoprecipitated from 800-μg aliquots of cell lysates with protein A-Sepharose beads. Following purification, Sepharose beads were extensively washed and incubated in a 50-μl reaction for 90 min at 37 °C with 275 ng of purified E1, 400 ng of E2 (UbcH5a), 5 ng/μl biotin NH2-terminal ubiquitin, 10 ng/μl ubiquitin (Boston Biochem Inc., Cambridge, MA), and 5 μg of the indicated GST fusion proteins in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm ATP, 2 mm dithiothreitol. After extensive washes the ubiquitylated receptors were detected by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin (GE Healthcare). Cell Surface Biotinylation Assay—Surface proteins were labeled for 30 min at 4 °C with 0.5 mg/ml Ez-Link® sulfo-NHS-Biotin (Pierce) in buffer A (1.3 mm CaCl2, 0.4 mm MgSO4-7H2O, 5 mm KCl, 138 mm NaCl, 5.6 mm d-glucose, 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4). After extensive washes with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.6% bovine serum albumin and 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, cells were lysed, and proteins were subjected to immunoprecipitation with streptavidin-Sepharose (GE Healthcare). Protein samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. Cell Proliferation Assay—Cells were plated on 96-well plates at a density of 4 × 104/well and cultured in appropriate medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum in the presence or absence of 100 nm 17-AAG. Cells were fixed in 11% glutaraldehyde 0, 24, 48, and 72 h after drug addition and stained in crystal violet. Staining was solubilized in 10% acetic acid, and absorbance at 595 nm was measured with a microplate reader. Cell Migration Assay—Cell motility was assayed using 8-μm pore size Transwell® chambers (Corning Glass). The lower side of the membrane was coated with 10 μg/ml fibronectin for 2 h and then blocked with 0.2% bovine serum albumin. Cells were detached with 1 mm EDTA and resuspended with 2% fetal bovine serum. 1 × 105 cells were plated on the upper side and allowed to migrate for 6 h in the presence of 100 nm 17-AAG toward the lower chamber containing appropriate medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells remaining in the upper chamber were mechanically removed, and those that migrated to the lower side were fixed and stained as described above. Transforming Assay—A focus-forming assay was performed on NIH-3T3 fibroblasts (5 × 105 cells) with 5 μg of recombinant plasmid as described previously (10Santoro M.M. Penengo L. Minetto M. Orecchia S. Cilli M. Gaudino G. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 741-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Two days after transfection, 17-AAG was added to cultures and renewed every 48 h. Cell cultures were maintained at confluence and screened for focus formation 10 ± 18 days after transfection. Spontaneous formation of foci was negligible. Geldanamycins Target Ron for Degradation—To investigate the sensitivity of Ron to Hsp90 inhibitors, we performed a time course experiment on NIH-3T3 fibroblasts (3T3-Ron) and pancreatic carcinoma FG2 cells, expressing recombinant and endogenous Ron, respectively. After cell exposure to GA for different times, we observed a robust reduction of both precursor and mature form of the receptor within 6 h. It is noteworthy that Ron protein levels declined with similar rates in both cell lines upon GA treatment. Similar effects, at a slightly lesser extent, were observed with the same concentration of the less toxic GA derivative 17-AAG (Fig. 1A). Ron destabilization upon Hsp90 inhibition was obtained also by using a chemically unrelated Hsp90 inhibitor, the macrolactone antibiotic radicicol (supplemental Fig. 1). It has been shown for other RTKs (platelet-derived growth factor receptor and epidermal growth factor receptor) (35Sakagami M. Morrison P. Welch W.J. Cell Stress Chaperones. 1999; 4: 19-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) that only the newly synthesized receptor molecules are destabilized by GA. We evaluated if Ron depletion following GA or 17-AAG exposure was due to impaired maturation of the nascent chains only or if also cell surface-exposed receptors were targeted for degradation. By surface biotinylation of 3T3-Ron and FG2 cells, followed by Ron immunoprecipitation, we observed an accelerated decrease of cell surface mature Ron after exposure to GA or 17-AAG for 6 h (Fig. 1B). This indicates that GA and 17-AAG, albeit with minor efficacy, are able to destabilize the receptor even after its exposure to the plasma membrane. In NIH-3T3 cells expressing a kinase-defective Ron mutant (31Penengo L. Rubin C. Yarden Y. Gaudino G. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 3669-3679Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), GA-induced receptor degradation was retained (supplemental Fig. 2), demonstrating that the kinase activity is not required for sensitivity of Ron to GA. GA-induced degradation of the client proteins is reported to involve the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (36Sepp-Lorenzino L. Ma Z. Lebwohl D.E. Vinitsky A. Rosen N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16580-16587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Thus, we analyzed Ron ubiquitylation upon GA or 17-AAG treatment of 3T3-Ron and FG2 cells. In these conditions, a marked ubiquitylation of the receptor was observed as early as 15 min after drug addition (Fig. 2A). This indicates that receptor ubiquitylation is an early step in GA-induced Ron degradation and suggests that a specific E3 ligase is involved. Moreover, pretreatment of both cell lines with the proteasome inhibitor MG-132 impaired Ron depletion induced by geldanamycins (Fig. 2B), indicating that this destabilizing effect on Ron requires proteasomal activity. Conversely, when cells were pretreated with the lysosomal inhibitor concanamycin A, GA retained full activity on Ron (supplemental Fig. 3). Our results show that cell surface-exposed mature Ron is destabilized by GA-induced kinase-independent degradation, involving the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Ron Associates with a Chaperone Complex Containing the E3 Ubiquitin Ligase CHIP—We aimed at identifying the ubiquitin ligase responsible for GA-induced Ron ubiquitylation. Among several ligases, we focused our attention on CHIP, since this E3 enzyme mediates degradation of signaling proteins, relying on the association with chaperone proteins Hsp90 and Hsc70 (20Xu W. Marcu M. Yuan X. Mimnaugh E. Patterson C. Neckers L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 12847-12852Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar, 37Fan M. Park A. Nephew K.P. Mol. Endocrinol. 2005; 19: 2901-2914Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). We verified if Ron and CHIP were recruited in stable complexes with these chaperone proteins. We co-transfected COS-7 cells with cDNAs encoding both Ron and CHIP. Immunoblotting analysis on Ron immunoprecipitates demonstrated that the receptor associates with endogenous Hsp90 and Hsc70 as well as with CHIP (Fig. 3A). CHIP has the ability to bind Hsc70 by means of the amino-terminal tetratricopeptide domain, whereas its E3 ubiquitin ligase activity is mediated by its carboxyl-terminal U-box domain (38Jiang J. Ballinger C.A. Wu Y. Dai Q. Cyr D.M. Hohfeld J. Patterson C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42938-42944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). To better characterize the interaction between the receptor and the ubiquitin ligase, we tested the ability of CHIP proteins harboring a mutation in the tetratricopeptide (K30A) or lacking the U-box (ΔU-box) domain to interact with Ron. The K30A mutant, which does not bind to either Hsp90 or Hsc70 (20Xu W. Marcu M. Yuan X. Mimnaugh E. Patterson C. Neckers L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 12847-12852Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar), failed to co-immunoprecipitate with Ron. This suggests that these chaperone intermediates are involved in the Ron-CHIP interaction. Conversely, the deletion of the U-box domain did not impair the complex formation (Fig. 3A). To verify whether CHIP could directly mediate Ron ubiquitylation, we performed an in vitro ubiquitylation assay on immunocomplexes from 3T3-Ron fibroblasts, by using purified GST-CHIP fusion proteins in the presence of biotinylated ubiquitin and E1 and E2 enzymes. Wild type (GST-CHIP), but not U-box-deleted (GST-CHIPΔU-box), fusion protein catalyzed the receptor ubiquitylation. No ubiquitylation was observed in the presence of GST protein alone as well as when the reaction was performed in absence of immunoprecipitated Ron (Fig. 3B). This demonstrates that CHIP can serve as an E3 ligase for Ron. Taken together, these results indicate that in live cells Ron forms a complex with the chaperones Hsp90 and Hsc70, which mediate receptor association with the E3 ubiquitin ligase CHIP. CHIP Mediates Ron Degradation Induced by Geldanamycins— We evaluated the involvement of CHIP in GA-induced Ron degradation by using COS-7 cells expressing the wild-type E3 ligase or the deletion mutant CHIPΔU-box, which despite its lack of ubiquitin ligase activity still associates with the receptor. Overexpression of the dominant negative CHIPΔU-box resulted in abrogation of GA-induced Ron degradation (Fig. 4A). We previously reported that the E3 ubiquitin ligase c-Cbl physically interacts with Ron, promoting its ligand-dependent ubiquitylation and down-regulation (31Penengo L. Rubin C. Yarden Y. Gaudino G. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 3669-3679Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). To verify the role for c-Cbl in receptor destabilization driven by GA, we performed the parallel experiment in COS-7 transfected with c-Cbl or the dominant negative c-Cbl-70Z (39Waterman H. Yarden Y. FEBS Lett. 2001; 490: 142-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Impairment of c-Cbl activity had no effect on GA-induced Ron degradation (Fig. 4B). To confirm the key role of CHIP in GA-mediated Ron destabilization, we analyzed cells deprived of CHIP by expression of targeted siRNAs. FG2 cells were engineered by means of vectors to express siRNAs designed to selectively inactivate CHIP transcripts or targeted to an unrelated sequence as control. Cells expressing CHIP-targeted siRNAs displayed markedly reduced levels of CHIP. In these conditions, Ron was refractory to the degradation induced by GA, whereas in cells expressing control siRNAs, receptor degradation still occurred. Similar results were obtained with the same concentration of 17-AAG (Fig. 4C). We conclude that the ubiquitin ligase activity of CHIP is necessary to mediate Ron degradation induced by geldanamycins. CHIP Is Responsible for Oncogenic RonM1254T c-Cbl-independent Ubiquitylation—We next addressed the role of CHIP-chaperone complex on the negative regulation of the oncogenic mutant RonM1254T. This mutant harbors a point mutation responsible for constitutive activation of the kinase and for overcoming the requirement for the multifunctional docking site of the Ron receptor (10Santoro M.M. Penengo L. Minetto M. Orecchia S. Cilli M. Gaudino G. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 741-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 11Santoro M.M. Penengo L. Orecchia S. Cilli M. Gaudino G. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 5208-5211Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In COS-7 cells co-expressing c-Cbl and RonM1254T, the mutant receptor failed to co-immunoprecipitate the ubiquitin ligase, even upon MSP stimulation. Likewise, in the reciprocal experiment, wild-type Ron, but not RonM1254T, was present in c-Cbl immunoprecipitates of the same cells (Fig. 5A). On the basis of these results, we evaluated if the lack of association with c-Cbl could affect RonM1254T ubiquitylation. In COS-7 cells co-transfected with wild-type or mutant receptor along with c-Cbl and a tagged form of ubiquitin (FLAG-Ub), the ubiquitylation of RonM1254T was preserved and was ligand-independent (Fig. 5B). To verify if RonM1254T ubiquitylation in vivo relies on the ubiquitin ligase activity of CHIP, we overexpressed CHIP or the defective ligase CHIPΔU-box in COS-7 cells. Endogenous CHIP was sufficient to promote RonM1254T ubiquitylation, which was increased by overexpression of recombinant CHIP and almost totally abrogated in cells overexpressing CHIPΔ U-box. This demonstrates that CHIP is a functional E3 ubiquitin ligase for this oncogenic receptor (Fig. 5C). On the basis of these data, we sought evidence of the association of RonM1254T with the chaperone complex containing CHIP. We co-transfected COS-7 cells with cDNAs encoding either RonM1254T or wild-type Ron and CHIP. Hsp90, Hsc70, and CHIP were more abundant in Ron immunocomplexes from cells expressing the oncogenic receptor, and the stronger interaction between CHIP and RonM1254T was confirmed by the reciprocal experiment (Fig. 5D). These data altogether indicate that Ron and RonM1254T differentially interact with the E3 ligase CHIP, which is responsible for the c-Cbl- and ligand-independent ubiquitylation of the oncogenic receptor. Oncogenic M1254T Substitution Increases Ron Sensitivity to Geldanamycins—Since oncogenic RonM1254T is recruited into the CHIP-chaperone complex even more efficiently than wild-type Ron, we tested the activity of GA and 17-AAG on the stability of the wild-type receptor and of its oncogenic counterpart. The treatment of 3T3-Ron and 3T3-RonM1254T cells with both inhibitors revealed an accelerated degradation rate for the mutant receptor, as compared with wild-type Ron (Fig. 6A). Interestingly, RonM1254T degradation was paralleled by an evident dephosphorylation of Akt and Erk1/2 effectors (Fig. 6A). We further"

We previously showed that a 173-amino acid segment of RyR1 (residues 4007-4180) is required for channel activation by 4-CmC (Fessenden, J. D., Perez, C. F., Goth, S., Pessah, I. N., and Allen, P. D. (2003) J. Biol. Chem. 278, 28727-28735). In the present study, we used site-directed mutagenesis to identify individual amino acid(s) within this region that mediate 4-CmC activation. In RyR1, substitution of 11 amino acids conserved between RyR1 and RyR2, but divergent in RyR3, with their RyR3 counterparts reduced 4-CmC sensitivity to the same degree as substitution of the entire 173-amino acid segment. Further analysis of various RyR1 mutants containing successively smaller numbers of these mutations identified 2 amino acid residues (Gln4020 and Lys4021) that, when mutated to their RyR3 counterparts (Leu3873 and Gln3874), abolished 4-CmC activation of RyR1. Mutation of either of these residues alone did not abolish 4-CmC sensitivity, although Q4020L partially reduced 4-CmC-induced Ca2+ transients. In addition, mutation of the corresponding residues in RyR3 to their RyR1 counterparts (L3873Q/Q3874K) imparted 4-CmC sensitivity to RyR3. Recordings of single RyR1 channels indicated that 4-CmC applied to either the luminal or cytoplasmic side activated the channel with equal potency. Secondary structure modeling in the vicinity of the Gln4020-Lys4021 dipeptide suggests that the region contains a surface-exposed region adjacent to a hydrophobic segment, indicating that both hydrophilic and hydrophobic regions of RyR1 are necessary for 4-CmC binding to the channel and/or to translate allosteric 4-CmC binding into channel activation. The ryanodine receptor type 1 (RyR1) and type 2 (RyR2), but not type 3 (RyR3), are efficiently activated by 4-chloro-m-cresol (4-CmC). We previously showed that a 173-amino acid segment of RyR1 (residues 4007-4180) is required for channel activation by 4-CmC (Fessenden, J. D., Perez, C. F., Goth, S., Pessah, I. N., and Allen, P. D.

Striated muscle contraction is triggered by Ca2+ release from intracellular stores through the ryanodine receptor (RyR), 2The abbreviations used are: RyR, ryanodine receptor; 4-CmC, 4-chloro-m-cresol; SR, sarcoplasmic reticulum; HSV, herpes simplex virus; wt, wild-type; ANOVA, analysis of variance. a large homotetrameric channel protein embedded in the membrane of the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). In skeletal muscle, RyR1 is functionally associated with the α1s subunit of the dihydropyridine receptor, a voltage-gated Ca2+ channel that activates RyR1 in response to muscle cell depolarization in a process known as excitation-contraction (EC) coupling. Distinct RyR isoforms expressed in either skeletal (RyR1) or cardiac muscles (RyR2) mediate EC coupling in these muscle types (1Fill M. Copello J.A. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 893-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (885) Google Scholar, 2Franzini-Armstrong C. Protasi F. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 699-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar). The third RyR isoform (RyR3) is expressed at low levels in many tissues but has not been shown to participate in EC coupling in skeletal or cardiac muscle (3Fessenden J.D. Wang Y. Moore R.A.

Many pharmacological compounds activate RyR1 including the methylxanthine derivative, caffeine (5Pessah I.N. Stambuk R.A. Casida J.E. Mol. Pharmacol. 1987; 31: 232-238PubMed Google Scholar), and the phenol-based compound, 4-chloro-m-cresol (6Zorzato F. Scutari E. Tegazzini V. Clementi E. Treves S. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 44: 1192-1201PubMed Google Scholar). Both of these compounds are thought to directly activate RyR1 by increasing the affinity of Ca2+ binding to its activator site but these compounds differ in that 4-CmC is 25 times more potent in activating RyR1 compared with caffeine. In addition, these two compounds have distinct RyR isoform-dependent activation profiles: caffeine is much more potent in activating RyR2 and RyR3 compared with RyR1 (3Fessenden J.D. Wang Y.

Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1999; 290: 578-586PubMed Google Scholar). This isoform-specific sensitivity to activation by caffeine and 4-CmC has made it possible to localize the activation sites of these compounds using chimeric RyR proteins. Substitution of amino acids 4187-4628 of RyR1 with the corresponding sequence from RyR2 increases the caffeine sensitivity of the resulting chimera compared with wtRyR1 (7Du G.G. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26120-26126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 9Du G.G. Khanna V.K. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11778-11783Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), whereas substitution of amino acids 4007-4180 of RyR1 into RyR3 enhances 4-CmC sensitivity in RyR3 (10Fessenden J.D.

Chem. 2003; 278: 28727-28735Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), thus suggesting that determinants for caffeine or 4-CmC activation of the channel reside in these respective regions. In addition, performing the reverse substitution by replacing amino acids 4007-4180 in RyR1 with the equivalent RyR3 sequence greatly diminishes the 4-CmC sensitivity of the resulting chimeric protein (10Fessenden J.D.

Chem. 2003; 278: 28727-28735Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), further strengthening the hypothesis that amino acid determinants required for full activation of RyR1 by 4-CmC reside within this 173-amino acid segment. The amino acid sequence within the 4-CmC sensitivity region is highly conserved among all three RyR isoforms with over 66% identity and 87% similarity. This observation suggests that the isoform-specific differences in 4-CmC sensitivity are mediated by only a few amino acids that are divergent between the isoforms. To identify these amino acids, we performed site-directed mutagenesis on 11 divergent amino acids within the 173 amino acid RyR1 4-CmC sensitivity region and tested the resulting constructs for 4-CmC sensitivity. Our results demonstrate that the differential sensitivity to 4-CmC between RyR1 and RyR3 can be attributed to 2 amino acid residues in RyR1, Gln4020 and Lys4021 and their RyR3 counterparts Leu3873 and Gln3874. These findings further suggest that these residues mediate 4-CmC activation of RyR1. Construction of Mutated RyR1 and RyR3 cDNAs—cDNAs encoding the rabbit isoforms of RyR1, RyR2, and RyR3 have previously been cloned into pHSVprPUC thus enabling the generation of HSV amplicons required for transduction of 1B5 myotubes (11Wang Y.

Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the QuikChange multi-mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene Inc., La Jolla, CA) on a RyR1 subclone created via the introduction of RyR1 sequence extending from the natural XhoI-HincII sites, located at positions 12,018 and 12,666, respectively, into the pGEM 3zf cloning vector (Promega Inc; Madison, WI). A silent mutation at position 12543 was added resulting in a unique AvrII restriction site that aided in the construction of full-length RyR1 cDNAs containing the mutations.

Differentiation was initiated by changing the medium to Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% heat-inactivated horse serum (v/v) and l-glutamine/antibiotics as above at 37 °C at 18% CO2. After 7 days, differentiated myotubes were transduced with the RyR constructs using equivalent amounts of HSV virions (11Wang Y. Fraefel C. Protasi F. Moore R.A. Fessenden J.D. Pessah I.N. DiFrancesco A. Breakefield X. Allen P.D. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: C619-C626Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that contained the cDNAs encoding the RyRs. After2hat37 °Cin antibiotic-free medium, virus was removed and the myotubes were incubated for 2 days to allow full expression of the RyRs before testing. Calcium Imaging—RyR-expressing myotubes were challenged with successive additions of 80 mm KCl, 40 mm caffeine, and 0.5 mm 4-CmC dissolved in imaging solution (125 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1.2 mm MgSO4,6mm glucose, 2 mm CaCl2,25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4 adjusted with NaOH). Note: for the 80 mm KCl solution, the NaCl concentration was reduced to 45 mm to maintain osmolarity. Changes in intracellular Ca2+ in 1B5 myotubes were measured as described previously (10Fessenden J.D. Perez C.F. Goth S. Pessah I.N. Allen P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 28727-28735Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) using the Ca2+ indicator dye Fluo-4. Record traces from individual cells were stored and analyzed using Microsoft Excel as follows. Quantification of Ca2+ Transients—The relative amount of Ca2+ released in response to each RyR agonist was estimated by calculating the average change in Fluo-4 fluorescence during application of the agonist. This mean value was then normalized to the resting fluorescence of the cell obtained 10 s prior to the addition of the agonist. Comparison of 4-CmC-elicited responses from cells transduced with various wt and mutant RyR constructs was accomplished by expressing the magnitude of each 4-CmC-elicited response as a percentage of the magnitude of the 40 mm caffeine-elicited Ca2+ transient obtained from the same cell. These normalized values from each RyR mutant were then compared with the values obtained from the 4-CmC induced transients from wtRyR1 and wtRyR3-expressing cells. This comparison was made using 2-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with a Dunnett's post test. A significant difference was inferred at p < 0.05. Measurements of Single Channel Activity in Lipid Bilayer Membranes—Bilayers were composed of phosphatidylethanolamine:phosphatidylserine:phosphatidylcholine (5:3:2 w/w) dissolved in decane at a final concentration of 50 mg/ml across a 200 μm aperture on a polysulfone cup (Warner Instrument Corp. CT). The bilayer partitioned two chambers (cis and trans), which contained the following buffer solutions (in mm): cis, 500 CsCl, 0.9 free Ca2+, and 20 Hepes-Tris (pH 7.4); trans, 500 CsCl and 20 Hepes-Tris (pH 7.4). The free Ca2+ concentration was adjusted by addition of CaCl2 and EGTA based on calculations from the “Bound and Determined” software (13Brooks S.P. Storey K.B. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 201: 119-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). The cis chamber was virtually grounded, whereas the trans chamber was connected to the head stage input of an amplifier (Bilayer Clamp BC 525C, Warner Instrument, Hamden, CT). Single channels were obtained by introducing rabbit skeletal muscle junctional SR vesicles to the cis chamber to induce fusion with the bilayer membrane. Immediately after incorporation of RyR1 single channels into the lipid bilayer, the SR vesicles were perfused out of the cis chamber to prevent multiple vesicle fusions. Single channel gating was monitored and recorded at a holding potential of -40 mV (applied to the trans side). The amplified current signals, filtered at 1 kHz (Low-Pass Bessel Filter 8 Pole, Warner Instrument) was digitized and acquired at a sampling rate of 10 kHz (Digidata 1320A, Axon-Molecular Devices, Union City, CA). Most of the recordings were made for at least 3 min before the contents of the cis and/or trans chambers were changed. The channel open probability (Po), as well as the open and closed dwell times were calculated using pClamp software 9.0 (Axon-Molecular Devices). Junctional SR vesicles used in this work for single channel studies were from three different preparations. Secondary Structure Prediction—The secondary structure predictions were performed using the Chou-Fasman method for α-helical predictions (14Chou P.Y. Fasman G.D. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1978; 47: 45-148PubMed Google Scholar), the Kyte-Doolittle method for hydropathy predictions (15Kyte J. Doolittle R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 105-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (17217) Google Scholar), and the method of Emini et al. (16Emini E.A. Hughes J.V. Perlow D.S. Boger J. J. Virol. 1985; 55: 836-839Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) for surface probability prediction. Although 4-CmC can activate all three RyR isoforms (6Zorzato F. Scutari E. Tegazzini V. Clementi E. Treves S. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 44: 1192-1201PubMed Google Scholar, 8Choisy S. Huchet-Cadiou C. Leoty C. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1999; 290: 578-586PubMed Google Scholar, 17Matyash M. Matyash V. Nolte C. Sorrentino V. Kettenmann H. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 84-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), it activates RyR1 and RyR2 much more effectively compared with RyR3. A primary determinant on RyR1 that mediates 4-CmC sensitivity resides between amino acid residues 3768 and 4180 (10Fessenden J.D. Perez C.F. Goth S. Pessah I.N. Allen P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 28727-28735Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Substitution of this region into the corresponding region of RyR3 results in a RyR1-RyR3 chimera (chimera 1 rev) with higher sensitivity to 4-CmC activation relative to wtRyR3. To determine whether 4-CmC acts on the analogous region of RyR2 (amino acids 3730-4136), this segment was substituted into RyR3 to create chimera 1 rev RyR2 (Fig. 1A). When intracellular Ca2+ release experiments were used to compare the ability of these constructs to respond to 80 mm KCl (to test for depolarization-induced calcium release), 40 mm caffeine and 0.5 mm 4-CmC, wtRyR3 (Fig. 1B) responded to caffeine but not to KCl or 4-CmC, whereas chimera 1 rev RyR2 (Fig. 1C) and chimera 1 rev (Fig. 1D) both responded to caffeine and 4-CmC but not to KCl depolarization. This finding suggests that determinants required for 4-CmC activation of RyR1 and RyR2 are identical. The amino acid sequences of the three RyR isoforms were compared within the 173-amino acid 1 CD region (Fig. 2A), a subregion of chimera 1 that is the smallest determinant of 4-CmC sensitivity we have previously defined in wtRyR1 (10Fessenden J.D. Perez C.F. Goth S. Pessah I.N. Allen P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 28727-28735Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Between the three isoforms, 66% of the amino acids in this region are identical and 87% are highly homologous (Fig. 2B). We reasoned that amino acid residues involved in 4-CmC activation of RyR1 and RyR2 should be (a) either identical or highly homologous between these isoforms and (b) divergent in RyR3. Eight amino acid residues were identified that were identical between RyR1 and RyR2 but not RyR3 (positions 1-6, 9, and 10). In addition, 3 residues were identified that were highly divergent between all three isoforms (positions 7, 8, and 11). Amino acid positions that were either identical or highly homologous between RyR3 and either RyR1 or RyR2 were not examined. A RyR1 construct containing all 11 mutations (Mut1-11) was tested for activation by KCl, caffeine, and 4-CmC (Fig. 3A). Compared with wtRyR1 (Fig. 3B), responses to chemical depolarization and caffeine activation of the Mut1-11 construct were unaffected. However, activation by 4-CmC was significantly reduced (Fig. 3, C and D). To identify which of these 11 mutated residues are responsible for the reduced 4-CmC sensitivity of the Mut1-11 construct, additional full-length RyR1 constructs containing smaller numbers of these mutations were tested (Fig. 4A). RyR1 constructs containing mutations at positions 1, 2, 5-11 (Fig. 4B), 1, 2, 7, 8 (Fig. 4C), or 1, 2, 5, 6 (Fig. 4D) all had significantly reduced 4-CmC-induced Ca2+ transients compared with wtRyR1 (Fig. 4E), whereas their responses to KCl and caffeine were unaffected. Since all mutated constructs with reduced sensitivity to 4-CmC contain mutations at positions 1 and 2, a RyR1 channel containing mutations of only these two amino acids was tested (Mut1,2; Fig. 5A). This construct also had significantly reduced 4-CmC-induced Ca2+ transients compared with wtRyR1 (Fig. 5B). To determine whether positions 3-11 contribute to 4-CmC sensitivity, a RyR1 construct containing only mutations at these positions was tested (Mut3-11; Fig. 5A). The Mut3-11 construct could be activated by 4-CmC, although the 4-CmC-induced calcium transients were slightly reduced compared with wtRyR1 (Fig. 5, C and D). This finding leaves open the possibility that other residues in addition to positions 1 and 2 may be involved in 4-CmC activation of wtRyR1. However, the finding that mutations at positions 1 and 2 have a much more dramatic effect on 4-CmC sensitivity compared with mutations at positions 3-11 suggests that Gln4020 and Lys4021 constitute the primary determinant for activation of RyR1 by 4-CmC. Full-length RyR1 constructs containing single mutations at either position 1 or position 2 were also tested (Fig. 6A). Activation of the Mut1 channel (Fig. 6B) with either caffeine or 4-CmC but not KCl resulted in repetitive oscillations in intracellular Ca2+ in 55% of myotubes tested. These oscillations were not seen in myotubes expressing Mut2 (Fig. 6C), which responded to all three methods of activation similarly to wtRyR1. Furthermore, the normalized 4-CmC responses of myotubes expressing Mut1 were significantly reduced relative to wtRyR1 (Fig. 6D). Substitution of RyR1 segments required for 4-CmC activation into RyR3 can restore 4-CmC sensitivity of this isoform (Fig. 1D). To test the hypothesis that positions 1 and 2 mediate RyR1 sensitivity to 4-CmC, we mutated these residues in RyR3 to their RyR1 counterparts (L3873Q/Q3874K, Fig. 7A). This construct (RyR1 Mut1,2) responded to 4-CmC (Fig. 7B) with Ca2+ transients that were significantly larger than 4-CmC induced Ca2+ transients in RyR3 (Fig. 7C). These results further strengthen the hypothesis that these amino acid residues are the primary determinant of 4-CmC sensitivity in RyR1. To determine whether 4-CmC preferentially activates either the cytoplasmic or luminal face of RyR1, single channel measurements were performed (Fig. 8). Consecutive additions of 4-CmC to the cytoplasmic (cis) face of RyR1 increased the Po from its resting level of 0.073 to 0.341 (25 μm 4-CmC) and 0.549 (50 μm 4-CmC; Fig. 8A). When applied to the luminal (trans) side of the channel, 4-CmC increased channel Po from a resting level of 0.106 to 0.431 (25 μm 4-CmC) and 0.636 (50 μm 4-CmC; Fig. 8B). Thus, under the experimental conditions used here, 4-CmC was equally potent and efficacious toward activating RyR1 channel activity from both cytoplasmic and luminal sides of the lipid bilayer. Moreover, addition of 4-CmC simultaneously to both cytoplasmic and luminal sides of the lipid bilayer produced an additive effect on channel activity, increasing a resting Po of 0.084-0.892 (25 μm 4-CmC each side) and 0.911 (50 μm 4-CmC; Fig. 8C). The dependence of RyR1 open probability on the concentration of 4-CmC applied to the cis, trans, or cis + trans sides of the bilayer is indicated in Fig. 9.FIGURE 9RyR1 channel Po values in the presence of different (4-CmC) but constant recording conditions (cis and trans buffers, free [Ca2+], holding potential, sample rating) are indicated. The data were obtained from three different JSR membrane preparations and a total number of 34 independent single channel measurements.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In this study, we have defined 2 amino acid residues of rabbit RyR1 (Gln4020 and Lys4021) that are required for 4-CmC activation. Mutation of these residues to their RyR3 counterparts selectively reduces 4-CmC activation of the mutant channel compared with wtRyR1. Conversely, mutation of these residues in RyR3 to their RyR1 counterparts imparts 4-CmC sensitivity to RyR3. Of these 2 residues, Gln4020 appears to be more important in channel function since mutation of this residue in RyR1 results in repetitive Ca2+ oscillations evoked by caffeine or 4-CmC. Does 4-CmC Bind to the Gln4020-Lys4021 Dipeptide?—The 4-CmC binding site most likely is located between amino acids 3759-4544 of RyR1 since N-terminal deletion mutants of RyR2 that contain the corresponding sequence (3722-4485) can be activated by 4-CmC, whereas deletion mutants lacking this sequence cannot (18George C.H. Jundi H. Thomas N.L. Scoote M. Walters N. Williams A.J. Lai F.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 2627-2638Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Given that the Gln4020-Lys4021 dipeptide is located within this region, this segment can be considered as a potential candidate for 4-CmC binding. This hypothesis is strengthened by findings from our recent study on the structural determinants of the 4-CmC molecule that are required for activation of RyR1 (19Jacobson A.R. Moe S.T. Allen P.D. Fessenden J.D. Mol. Pharmacol. 2006; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). We found that the 1-OH of 4-CmC is critical for the ability of the compound to activate RyR1. Moreover, the phenolic proton appears to be shared between 4-CmC and a general base on RyR1, which has a pH profile consistent with it being either a histidine or a lysine residue. This residue could be the Lys4021 defined in this study. A second finding in our recent work is that hydrophobic groups at the 3- and 4-positions of 4-CmC are required for activation of RyR1. This result is consistent with our findings in the present study that indicate the proximity of a hydrophobic segment, possibly M2, to the QK dipeptide. One model consistent with both sets of results predicts that the QK dipeptide stabilizes the 1-OH moiety of 4-CmC, whereas the M2 segment stabilizes the 3- and 4-hydrophobic groups. This model provides a framework for additional experiments aimed at understanding the molecular mechanisms by which RyR1 responds to 4-CmC. A separate but related question is whether the 4-CmC binding site resides on the luminal or cytoplasmic face of RyR1. Single channel studies (20Herrmann-Frank A. Richter M. Sarkozi S. Mohr U. Lehmann-Horn F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1289: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) originally suggested a luminal binding site for 4-CmC since this compound preferentially activated RyR1 when it was applied to the luminal face of the channel. However, in our attempts to reproduce this data, we found that 4-CmC activates RyR1 with roughly equal potency when applied to either the cytoplasmic or luminal side. These results clearly indicate that elements of RyR1 structure essential for 4-CmC activation can be equally accessed from either the cytoplasmic or luminal sides of the lipid bilayer. The reason for the discrepancy between our results and those of Herrmann-Frank and co-workers (20Herrmann-Frank A. Richter M. Sarkozi S. Mohr U. Lehmann-Horn F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1289: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) is not clear considering that the experimental protocols were nearly identical in the two studies. Nevertheless, a new finding in the present study indicates that when 4-CmC is applied simultaneously to both sides of the lipid bilayer, its effect on channel activity is essentially additive. These new data support a hypothesis in which the 4-CmC binding site most likely resides in close proximity to the lipid bilayer or even at the protein/lipid interface. This hypothesis is supported by studies on structural analogs of 4-CmC such as 4-alkyl phenols whose activity is directly proportional to the length of the 4-alkyl chain (21Beeler T.J. Gable K.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 301: 216-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). These alkyl chains could anchor the compound to the membrane allowing the compound to diffuse to a binding site at the protein/lipid interface of RyR1. Presumably, 4-CmC acts similarly, which could explain the lack of preferential activation we observe in our single channel measurements. Location of the Gln4020-Lys4021 Dipeptide within the RyR1 Primary Structure—The Gln4020-Lys4021 dipeptide is located proximally to a number of important functional elements in the RyR1 primary structure. RyR1 is thought to be comprised of two overall structural domains, a massive N-terminal cytoplasmic domain and a smaller C-terminal transmembrane domain that anchors the channel to the membrane and also contains the Ca2+ permeation pore (22Takeshima H. Nishimura S. Matsumoto T. Ishida H. Kangawa K. Minamino N. Masuto H. Ueda M. Hanaoka M. Hirose T. Numa S. Nature. 1989; 339: 439-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (867) Google Scholar). The Gln4020-Lys4021 dipeptide is located at the beginning of this C-terminal channel domain. Directly adjacent to the dipeptide is the putative M2 transmembrane segment, which contains a highly conserved glutamate residue (Glu4032) that has been implicated as a “Ca2+ sensor”; i.e. a residue required to translate Ca2+ binding to the channel into RyR activation (23Chen S.R.W. Ebisawa K. Li X. Zhang L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14675-14678Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). In addition, putative binding sites for calmodulin (amino acids 3614-3643 (22Takeshima H. Nishimura S. Matsumoto T. Ishida H. Kangawa K. Minamino N. Masuto H. Ueda M. Hanaoka M. Hirose T. Numa S. Nature. 1989; 339: 439-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (867) Google Scholar, 24Moore C.P. Rodney G. Zhang J.Z. Santacruz-Toloza L. Strasburg G. Hamilton S.L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8532-8537Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar)) and Ca2+ (amino acids 4079-4090 and 4116-4127 (25Xiong H. Feng X. Gao L. Xu L. Pasek D.A. Seok J.H. Meissner G. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 4804-4814Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar)) are located near the Gln4020-Lys4021 dipeptide. Taken together, these observations suggest that the 4-CmC activation site and Ca2+ regulatory sites are proximal to each other. This arrangement could provide an attractive explanation for how localized conformational changes in RyR1 structure induced by 4-CmC binding could be conveyed to nearby Ca2+ regulatory sites, thus increasing the sensitivity of RyR1 to Ca2+ activation as has been reported (20Herrmann-Frank A. Richter M. Sarkozi S. Mohr U. Lehmann-Horn F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1289: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Protein Modeling—To understand how the Q4020L and K4021Q mutations might alter the local structure of RyR1, we modeled the secondary structure between amino acids 4007 and 4037 and compared this predicted structure to the equivalent regions from RyR2 and RyR3 (Fig. 10, A-C). For all three isoforms, the predicted overall secondary structure is α-helical. In wtRyR1 and wtRyR2, the Gln4020-Lys4021 dipeptide is adjacent to a highly hydrophobic segment (residues 4023-4041 in RyR1) originally predicted as the M2 transmembrane segment (26Zorzato F. Fujii J. Otsu K. Phillips M. Green N.M. Lai F.A. Meissner G. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2244-2256Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In RyR3, this hydrophobic region is extended to include the RyR3 equivalent of the 4-CmC activation dipeptide, Leu3873-Gln3874. When the Q4020L and K4021Q mutations are introduced into RyR1 (Fig. 10D), this hydrophobic segment becomes extended as well, producing a similar hydropathy profile to that of wtRyR3. These observations suggest that extending this hydrophobic segment to include the Gln4020-Lys4021 dipeptide reduces 4-CmC sensitivity of RyR1. A second major difference between RyR1/RyR2 and RyR3 in the predicted secondary structure is the presence of a putative surface-exposed region in RyR1 and RyR2 that is not present in RyR3 (Fig. 10, A-C). This surface-exposed region lies just N-terminal to the Gln4020-Lys4021 dipeptide of RyR1 and to its equivalent in RyR2. Thus, a hypothesis consistent with our experimental data and also the modeled structure of this area is that this surface-exposed region is required for 4-CmC activation of RyR1 and RyR2. This hypothesis is strengthened by the observation that the Q4020L/K4021Q mutant also lacks the predicted surface exposed region (Fig 10D). Indeed, the presence of this putative surface-exposed region is correlated well with 4-CmC sensitivity of the RyR. Mutation of Lys4021 alone (K4021Q) affects neither 4-CmC sensitivity nor the predicted surface exposed region (Fig. 10F), whereas mutation of Gln4020 alone (Q4020L) diminishes the probability of the surface exposed sequence (Fig. 10E) and also diminishes 4-CmC-induced Ca2+ transients. In this report, we have defined a critical dipeptide segment of RyR1, Gln4020-Lys4021, that is required for 4-CmC activation of the channel. Future work will be needed to understand the mechanism of channel activation by 4-CmC and how these residues are involved in this process."
https://openalex.org/W2144984089,"Two genes encoding proteins related to large subunits of Rubisco were identified in the genome of the planktonic cyanobacterium Microcystis aeruginosa PCC 7806 that forms water blooms worldwide. The rbcL(I) gene belongs to the form I subfamily typically encountered in cyanobacteria, green algae, and land plants. The second and newly discovered gene is of the form IV subfamily and widespread in the Microcystis genus. In M. aeruginosa PCC 7806 cells, the expression of both rbcL(I) and rbcL(IV) is sulfur-dependent. The purified recombinant RbcL(IV) overexpressed in Escherichia coli cells did not display CO(2) fixation activity but catalyzed enolization of 2,3-diketo-5-methylthiopentyl-1-phosphate, and the rbcL(IV) gene rescued a Bacillus subtilis MtnW-deficient mutant. Therefore, the Microcystis RbcL(IV) protein functions both in vitro and in vivo and might be involved in a methionine salvage pathway. Despite variations in the amino acid sequences, RbcL(IV) shares structural similarities with all members of the Rubisco superfamily. Invariant amino acids within the catalytic site may thus represent the minimal set for enolization, whereas variations, especially located in loop 6, may account for the limitation of the catalytic reaction to enolization. Even at low protein concentrations in vitro, the recombinant RbcL(IV) assembles spontaneously into dimers, the minimal unit required for Rubisco forms I-III activity. The discovery of the coexistence of RbcL(I) and RbcL(IV) in cyanobacteria, the ancestors of chloroplasts, enlightens episodes of the chaotic evolutionary history of the Rubiscos, a protein family of major importance for life on Earth."

Physiol. 2003; 65: 851-879Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 3Palczewski K. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2005; 75: 743-767Crossref Scopus (551) Google Scholar). Although more than 100 opsin mutations are associated with RP (the Human Gene Mutation Data base, archive.uwcm.ac.uk/uwcm/mg/ns/1/120347.html), only a few have been reported to be associated with autosomal recessive retinitis pigmentosa (arRP). The first reported case of arRP associated with a mutation in the opsin gene is a nonsense mutation at codon 249 (4Rosenfeld P.J. Cowley G.S. McGee T.L. Sandberg M.A. Berson E.L. Dryja T.P. Nat. Genet. 1992; 1: 209-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar) that eliminates helices VI and VII (containing the retinal binding site Lys296), cytoplasmic helix 8, and the C terminus of opsin (Fig. 1A). Even heterozygous carriers of this mutation had affected electroretinograms, indicating an abnormality in rod photoreceptor function (4Rosenfeld P.J. Cowley G.S. McGee T.L. Sandberg M.A. Berson E.L. Dryja T.P. Nat. Genet. 1992; 1: 209-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). This mutant was partially characterized (5Ridge K.D. Lee S.S. Abdulaev N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7860-7867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). E150K is missense opsin mutation associated with arRP (6Kumaramanickavel G. Maw M. Denton M.J. John S. Srikumari C.R. Orth U. Oehlmann R. Gal A. Nat. Genet. 1994; 8: 10-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar); however, prior to this work the effects of the mutation had not been biochemically characterized. Glu150 is located in the proximity of the C-terminal region of the second cytoplasmic loop, embedded at the edge of the phospholipid bilayer (Fig. 1, A and B). Based on the crystal structure of Rho (7Palczewski K. Kumasaka T. Hori T. Behnke C.A. Motoshima H. Fox B.A. Le Trong I. Teller D.C. Okada T. Stenkamp R.E. Yamamoto M. Miyano M. Science. 2000; 289: 739-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (5003) Google Scholar), this residue may have electrostatic interaction with Arg69 on C-I. In general, residues on the cytoplasmic side, especially in C-II, C-III, and helix 8, play important roles in the activation of a cognate G protein, transducin (Gt) (8Hamm H.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Another arRP mutation, G284S, is listed in www.sph.uth.tmc.edu/RetNet/ without any further characterization. We focused our research on the E150K mutant of opsin to understand the biochemical mechanisms underlying arRP and further characterize opsin biosynthesis by studying this recombinant opsin mutant in vitro. We explored whether the mutation interferes with phototransduction by affecting the binding and activation of Gt as suggested previously (6Kumaramanickavel G. Maw M. Denton M.J. John S.

The synthetic 1D4 peptide was ordered from United Biochemical Research, Inc. (Seattle, WA). Other resins and columns for chromatography were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Cell Lines and Growth Conditions—Tetracycline-inducible HEK293 cells stably transfected with constructs encoding human WT and E150K opsins were generated according to the manufacturer's procedure (T-REx-293™; Invitrogen), grown in the Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing high glucose (Invitrogen) at 37 °C in the presence of 5% CO2. Unless otherwise mentioned, the cells were harvested after 48 h of tetracycline induction (1 μg/ml). Brefeldin A was added to the stable cell lines 1 h after tetracycline induction, at a final concentration of 2.5 μg/ml, and the cells were fixed 1 h after the brefeldin A treatment or left to recover for another 10 h before fixation. To add FLAG or c-Myc to the C terminus of the protein, WT or E150K opsin constructs were cloned in frame into the pCMV-Tag4 or pCMV-Tag5 vectors, respectively (Stratagene). After selection of the cloned constructs and confirmation of the sequence, HEK293 cells were cotransfected with 50% of each vector using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen). Two days post-transfection (48 h), the cells were then fixed with 2% of paraformaldehyde for 5 min. Electrophoresis and Immunoblotting—All of the protein separations were performed on 12% SDS-PAGE gels. Silver staining and immunoblotting (Immobilon-P polyvinylidene difluoride; Millipore) were carried out according to standard protocols. Sample buffer without dithiothreitol (DTT) was used with DSP cross-linked samples for the nonreducing condition. Anti-Rho 1D4 and anti-Rho B6-30N antibodies were used to detect the corresponding C-terminal and N-terminal epitopes. Alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG or goat anti-rabbit IgG (Promega) were used as secondary antibodies. Protein bands were visualized with the nitro blue tetrazolium chloride (NBT)/5-bromo-4-chloro-3′-indolylphosphate p-toluidine salt (BCIP) color development substrate (Promega). Pigment Reconstitution—Harvested cells expressing opsins were homogenized with a glass-glass homogenizer on ice and then centrifuged at 2,000 × g in a bench top centrifuge for 2 min to remove nuclei and cellular debris. The cell membranes were then pelleted by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 5 min. All of the procedures employing reconstituted pigment or retinoids were performed under dim red light unless mentioned otherwise. The membranes were washed three times with 37 mm NaCl, 5.4 mm Na2HPO4, 2.7 mm KCl, and 1.8 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.4, and incubated with a final concentration of 50 μm 11-cis-retinal in the presence of protease inhibitors (protease inhibitor mixture; Sigma-Aldrich) at room temperature overnight to generate Rho. Purification of Opsin—Opsin or Rho was purified using anti-Rho C-terminal 1D4 antibody (13Molday R.S. MacKenzie D. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 653-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar) immobilized on CNBr-activated Sepharose™ 4B (14Oprian D.D. Molday R.S. Kaufman R.J. Khorana H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 8874-8878Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar, 15Zhu L. Jang G.F. Jastrzebska B. Filipek S. Pearce-Kelling S.E. Aguirre G.D. Stenkamp R.E. Acland G.M. Palczewski K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 53828-53839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Briefly, a 4.6 × 12-mm column was packed with 300 μl of 2 mg 1D4/ml Sepharose beads. The incubated cell membranes were pelleted and homogenized with PBS, using a glass-to-glass homogenizer. Soluble proteins in the supernatant were removed by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 5 min, and the pellet was then solubilized in buffer A (20 mm DM, 10 mm 1,3-bis(tris(hydroxymethyl)methylamino)propane (BTP), pH 7.5, containing 500 mm NaCl). The supernatant was loaded onto the 1D4 immunoaffinity column after a 20-min centrifugation at 125,000 × g at 4 °C, followed by a thorough washing with buffer B (2 mm DM, 10 mm BTP, pH 7.5, and containing 500 mm NaCl) at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. The purified protein was eluted with buffer C (500 μm TETSQVAPA in buffer B, pH 6.0) at room temperature. The protein concentration was determined from absorption at 280 and 500 nm using a Hewlett-Packard 8452A UV-visible spectrophotometer. Chemical Cross-linking with DSP—The cross-linking experiments were performed as described previously (16Jastrzebska B. Maeda T. Zhu L. Fotiadis D. Filipek S. Engel A. Stenkamp R.E. Palczewski K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 54663-54675Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 17Suda K. Filipek S. Palczewski K. Engel A. Fotiadis D. Mol. Membr. Biol. 2004; 21: 435-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cell membranes were suspended in 100 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 8.0. DSP in Me2SO was added to reach a final concentration of 50 μm, and the reaction was allowed to proceed on ice for 30 min. The concentration of Me2SO did not exceed 2% of the reaction volume. To quench the reaction, 1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, was added to a final concentration of 100 mm. The cell membranes were then washed with phosphate buffer and pelleted for opsin purification. Deglycosylation of Opsin—Approximately 3 μg of immunoaffinity-purified opsin was incubated with 100 units of Endo H or PNGase F at room temperature for 1 h (deglycosylation of opsin purified from cells) or at 4 °C for 24 h (for purified DSP cross-linked opsin), and the products were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Photosensitivity of the Visual Pigment—UV-visible absorption spectra were measured with freshly purified Rho at 20 °C (15Zhu L. Jang G.F. Jastrzebska B. Filipek S. Pearce-Kelling S.E. Aguirre G.D. Stenkamp R.E. Acland G.M. Palczewski K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 53828-53839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In brief, photoactivation spectra were taken at intervals of 5, 10, 20, 30, and 180 s of exposure to light (applied with a long pass wavelength filter, >490 nm, at a distance of 20 cm). To trap the protonated retinylidene Lys296, concentrated H2SO4 was added to adjust the final pH to 1.9-2.0 after bleaching the sample for 3 min. The rate of photoactivation was determined using a plot of A496 nm against bleaching time. Rates of Meta II Decay—Rho (10 nm)in2mm DM, 10 mm BTP, pH 6.0, containing 100 mm NaCl was used to measure Meta II decay. The increase in intrinsic Trp fluorescence results from hydrolysis of the protonated Schiff base and release of all-trans-retinal from Rho (18Farrens D.L. Khorana H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5073-5076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Immunoaffinity-purified Rho was bleached by a Fiber-Lite illuminator (>490-nm filter applied) for 30 s from a distance of 15 cm, immediately followed by fluorescence measurements. The fluorometer slit was set to 2.5 μm at 295 nm for excitation and 8 μm at 330 nm for emission on a PerkinElmer Life Sciences LS 50B luminescence spectrophotometer. A thermostat was applied to stabilize the temperature of the cuvette at 20 °C during the measurement. Both fitting curves had R2 values of over 0.99. Gt Binding and Activation Assay—Gt was purified as described previously (16Jastrzebska B. Maeda T. Zhu L. Fotiadis D. Filipek S. Engel A. Stenkamp R.E. Palczewski K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 54663-54675Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). In the binding assay, affinity-purified Rho (WT or E150K) was mixed with a molar equivalent amount of Gt in 20 mm BTP, pH 7.5, containing 120 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, and 2 mm DM. After bleaching Rho, the mixture was incubated for 15 min on ice to allow the complex to form. Gt dissociation was induced by the addition of 100 μm GTPγS (Sigma-Aldrich) on ice for 30 min before loading onto a size exclusion column (15Zhu L. Jang G.F. Jastrzebska B. Filipek S. Pearce-Kelling S.E. Aguirre G.D. Stenkamp R.E. Acland G.M. Palczewski K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 53828-53839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), using 20 mm BTP, pH 7.5, containing 120 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm DTT. In the fluorescence assay, the ratio of Gt to Rho was adjusted to 10:1 with Rho at ∼2.5 nm. The bleached sample was incubated for 10 min at 20 °C with continuous low speed stirring. The fluorescence was measured as described by Farrens et al. and others (19Farrens D.L. Altenbach C. Yang K. Hubbell W.L. Khorana H.G. Science. 1996; 274: 768-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (1104) Google Scholar, 20Heck M. Schadel S.A. Maretzki D. Bartl F.J. Ritter E. Palczewski K. Hofmann K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3162-3169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), employing excitation and emission wavelengths at 300 and 345 nm, respectively. Immunocytochemistry—HEK293 cells were cultured on 35-mm glass-bottomed dishes (MatTek Corporation), and opsin expression was induced by 1 μg/ml tetracycline for 48 h after overnight attachment. The cells were then fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde in PBS (11.4 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, containing 136 mm NaCl) for 5 min and washed with PBS. To block nonspecific labeling, the cells were incubated with 1.5% normal goat serum in PBST (PBS with 0.1% Triton X-100) for 15 min at room temperature. The cells were then incubated overnight at 4 °C with purified mouse anti-Rho 1D4 or rabbit anti-Rho antibody with PBST, along with one of the rabbit anticalreticulin IgG, mouse anti-GM130, anti-Golgin84, anti-P230, or anti-Vti1b monoclonal antibodies for double labeling. The cells were then rinsed in PBST and incubated with Cy3-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG or goat anti-rabbit IgG for detection of opsin immunofluorescence and with Hoechst 33342 dye for DNA staining. For detection of other antigens, the cells were also incubated with Alexa 488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit or mouse IgG. For transient transfected cells, FLAG-tagged WT opsin was labeled with Cy3-conjugated anti-FLAG antibody, whereas E150K opsin was labeled with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-c-Myc antibody along with the DNA stain. After labeling with secondary antibodies, the cells were rinsed in PBST and mounted with 50 μl 2% 1,4-diazabicyclo (2,2,2)-octane in 90% glycerol to retard bleaching. For confocal imaging, the cells were analyzed on a Zeiss LSM510 laser scanning microscope (Carl Zeiss, Inc.). Image contrast and brightness were adjusted by Adobe Photoshop CS. Modeling—A phospholipid enhanced molecular model of Rho in the oligomeric state was constructed using the Rho network structure 1N3M from the Protein Data Bank. A three component lipid bilayer mimicking the rod disc membranes was composed of phospholipids with phosphatidylcholine head groups on the intradiscal side and phosphatidylethanolamine together with phosphatidylserine head groups on the cytoplasmic side. All three types of phospholipids contained the saturated stearoyl chain (18:0) in the sn1 position and the polyunsaturated docosahexaenoyl chain (22:6) in the sn2 position. The detailed procedure of the membrane embedding, solvation, and equilibration of the protein-membrane-water system was described previously (21Liang Y. Fotiadis D. Maeda T. Maeda A. Modzelewska A. Filipek S. Saperstein D.A. Engel A. Palczewski K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 48189-48196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The equilibration phase was performed at a constant temperature of 300 K and a constant pressure of 1013 hPa for 1 ns. Opsin mutants were subjected to additional molecular dynamics simulation for a subsequent 500 ps. E150K Opsin Exhibits a Different Glycosylation Pattern than WT Opsin—The arRP-related E150K Rho and WT human and bovine Rho as controls were immunoaffinity-purified from HEK293 cells and analyzed by UV-visible spectroscopy, SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotting. After normalization for the number of cells, the expression level of the mutant was ⅛ that of WT Rho as determined by immunoblotting (supplemental Fig. S1) and based on the amount of isolated mutant and WT Rho. The spectra of the human mutant and WT Rho were indistinguishable from each other (λmax = 496 nm) but shifted from bovine Rho (λmax = 498 nm) (Fig. 2A). Both proteins were purified to similar levels as judged by A280 nm/A500 nm ratio, which was 1.6-1.8 in most preparations (Fig. 2A, inset). In SDS-PAGE analysis, the monomeric form of WT Rho migrated as a broad band (∼40-55 kDa), because of heterogenous N-linked glycosylation in HEK293 cells. However, the majority of monomeric E150K opsin migrated with an apparent molecular mass of ∼50-58 kDa (Fig. 2B), which is slightly higher than that of WT opsin. These differences in the apparent molecular mass could result from altered post-translational glycosylation. Hence, Endo H and PNGase F were used to assess the status of glycosylation of the mutant and WT opsins. Endo H cleaves only the ER products containing high mannose structures and some hybrid oligosaccharides at the GlcNAc-GlcNAc bond of its chitobiose core from N-linked glycoproteins (22Maley F. Trimble R.B. Tarentino A.L. Plummer Jr., T.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 180: 195-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar). Mature proteins are resistant to Endo H once they exit the ER and enter the Golgi. The amidase PNGase, cleaves the innermost GlcNAc-Asn bond from N-linked glycoproteins (22Maley F. Trimble R.B. Tarentino A.L. Plummer Jr., T.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 180: 195-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar). Both silver-stained gels (Fig. 2C) and immunoblots (Fig. 2D) showed that E150K and WT opsins were mostly resistant to deglycosylation by Endo H. These data suggest that the majority of E150K opsin passed the ER processing and underwent early trimming such as the cleavage of the high mannose form of the N-linked glycans in the Golgi apparatus. These properties distinguish E150K mutants from the most extensively studied adRP opsin mutant, P23H, which is sensitive to Endo H cleavage (23Illing M.E. Rajan R.S. Bence N.F. Kopito R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34150-34160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). The fact that after PNGase F treatment the two E150K opsin bands merged into one with the same apparent molecular mass as deglycosylated monomeric WT opsin (∼35 kDa) (Fig. 2, C and D) excluded the possibility that the lower molecular mass resulted from partial degradation. E150K opsin formed more SDS-resistant oligomers than WT opsin, suggesting a higher propensity of the mutant to aggregate (Fig. 2B). The significance of this observation is unclear. The difference in apparent molecular masses between WT and E150K opsins was also observable for the SDS-induced dimer forms. E150K Mutant Rho and Gt Activation—The ability of the mutant to couple to Gt was investigated by size exclusion chromatography and fluorescence assays (Fig. 3, A and B). Upon light activation, Rho* bound Gtαβγ, and the Rho*·Gtαβγ complex was detected by gel filtration, where Rho and Gt were eluted in the same fractions (Fig. 3A, left panels). Upon the addition of nonhydrolyzable GTP analog, GTPγS, Rho, and Gt were eluted in different fractions (Fig. 3A, right panels) indicating that Gtα·GTP (Gtα·GTPγS) had dissociated to free Gtβγ and Rho*. In the direct intrinsic fluorescence assay (18Farrens D.L. Khorana H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5073-5076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), E150K Rho* activated Gtα with an initial activation rate of k0 ∼0.112 min−1, a rate that was faster than the activation by human WT Rho, k0 ∼0.071 min−1, but similar to activation by bovine WT Rho k0 ∼0.114 min−1. No changes in fluorescence were observed in the absence of Gt, and no constitutive Gt activation was detected with purified E150K opsin in the absence of light or chromophore (Fig. 3C) in the presence or absence of phospholipids to stabilize opsins (26Fasick J.I. Lee N. Oprian D.D. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 11593-11596Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). No Gt activity was observed using the whole membrane preparations (data not shown). These results suggest that mutated E150K did not affect G protein binding and activation. The increase in the Gt activation for the E150K mutant could be a result of modified photoactivation properties of the mutant. The active form of Rho, Meta II (or Rho*), had a faster decay rate (τE150K = 11.8 min) than that of WT Rho (τWT = 13.6 min), indicating that the release rate of all-trans-retinal from the binding pocket was faster (Fig. 3D). Both Rho proteins were photoactivated in DM, but again the decrease of A498 nm was faster for the mutant (supplemental Fig. S2), consistent with the rate of decay of Meta II. Additionally, DM-solubilized E150K opsin regenerated with 11-cis-retinal ∼50% more slowly than its WT counterpart. This observation could be a result of lower stability of the mutant in the detergent. Collectively, these data suggest that E150K Rho is correctly folded at the protein core around the binding pocket and undergoes similar, but not identical, photoactivation processes. Chemical Cross-linking of Opsin with DSP—WT opsin forms covalently linked dimers when expressed in HEK293 cells and treated with DSP (16Jastrzebska B. Maeda T. Zhu L. Fotiadis D. Filipek S. Engel A.

Stenkamp R.E. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 7761-7772Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar), there are several Lys residues from each Rho molecule of the dimer that lie within the accessible range of the DSP spacer (1.2 nm). When the membranes from cells expressing E150K opsin or WT opsin were treated with DSP, the formation of dimers was observed (Fig. 4). We used DTT in control experiments to reduce the disulfide bond within the cross-linker to exclude the possibility of nonspecific oligomerization. Similar results were obtained from both WT and E150K opsins, suggesting that the mutation did not induce dramatic changes in either the global folding of individual mutant opsin or the intermolecular interactions between opsins within dimers. E150K Opsin Partially Colocalizes with cis/Medial Golgi Marker—Confocal laser scanning microscopy was used to study the localization of WT and mutant opsins in HEK293 cells. WT opsin was properly folded and transported to the plasma membrane as previously reported (Fig. 5; see also supplemental Fig. S3) (14Oprian D.D. Molday R.S. Kaufman R.J. Khorana H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 8874-8878Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). The adRP-related opsin mutation, P23H, is known to be ubiquitinylated and targeted for degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome system while expressed in HEK293 or COS-7 cells (23Illing M.E.

https://openalex.org/W1982518245,"The effect(s) of endogenously synthesized cholesterol (endo-CHOL) on the endosomal system in mammalian cells has not been examined. Here we treated Chinese hamster ovary cell lines with lovastatin (a hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase inhibitor) and mevalonate (a precursor for isoprenoids) to block endo-CHOL synthesis and then examined its effects on the fate of cholesterol liberated from low density lipoprotein (LDL-CHOL). The results showed that blocking endo-CHOL synthesis for 2 h or longer does not impair the hydrolysis of cholesteryl esters but partially impairs the transport of LDL-CHOL to the plasma membrane. Blocking endo-CHOL synthesis for 2 h or longer also alters the localization patterns of the late endosomes/lysosomes and retards their motility, as monitored by time-lapse microscopy. LDL-CHOL overcomes the effect of blocking endo-CHOL synthesis on endosomal localization patterns and on endosomal motility. Overexpressing Rab9, a key late endosomal small GTPase, relieves the endosomal cholesterol accumulation in Niemann-Pick type C1 cells but does not revert the reduced endosomal motility caused by blocking endo-CHOL synthesis. Our results suggested that endo-CHOL contributes to the cholesterol content of late endosomes and controls its motility, in a manner independent of NPC1. These results also supported the concept that endosomal motility plays an important role in controlling cholesterol trafficking activities. The effect(s) of endogenously synthesized cholesterol (endo-CHOL) on the endosomal system in mammalian cells has not been examined. Here we treated Chinese hamster ovary cell lines with lovastatin (a hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase inhibitor) and mevalonate (a precursor for isoprenoids) to block endo-CHOL synthesis and then examined its effects on the fate of cholesterol liberated from low density lipoprotein (LDL-CHOL). The results showed that blocking endo-CHOL synthesis for 2 h or longer does not impair the hydrolysis of cholesteryl esters but partially impairs the transport of LDL-CHOL to the plasma membrane. Blocking endo-CHOL synthesis for 2 h or longer also alters the localization patterns of the late endosomes/lysosomes and retards their motility, as monitored by time-lapse microscopy.

Cholesterol is an important lipid molecule present ubiquitously in mammalian cells. It plays important structural and functional roles in cell membranes (1Bloch K. Steroids. 1992; 57: 378-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). In specialized cells such as steroidogenic cells or hepatocytes, cholesterol serves as an obligatory precursor for steroid hormones and bile acids. Almost all mammalian cells receive exogenous cholesterol, mainly via the classic low density lipoprotein (LDL) 5The abbreviations used are: LDL, low density lipoprotein; ACAT, acyl-coenzyme A:cholesterol transferase; CD, cyclodextrin; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; CL, cholesteryl linoleate; [3H]CL-LDL, [3H]cholesteryl linoleate-labeled LDL; endo-CHOL, endogenously synthesized cholesterol; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; GFP, green fluorescent protein; LDL-CHOL, cholesterol liberated from LDL; MVB, multivesicular body; NPC1, Niemann-Pick type C1; NSDHL, NADPH sterol dehydrogenase-like protein; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PM, plasma membrane; SCAP, SREBP cleavage-activating protein; SREBP, sterol regulatory element-binding protein; TGN, transGolgi network; YFP, yellow fluorescent protein; HMG, hydroxymethylglutaryl; WT, wild type; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; DiI, DiIC18(3Sugii S.

The egress of cholesterol from the late endosomes requires the concerted actions of several proteins, including the Niemann-Pick type C1 (NPC1) and NPC2 proteins (reviewed in Ref. 5Patterson M.C.

Mutations in either NPC1 or NPC2 cause cholesterol (and other lipids) to be entrapped in the aberrant endosomes/lysosomes and prevent it from being delivered to various destinations, including the plasma membranes (PM), trans-Golgi network (TGN), and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where cholesterol would normally be reesterified by the ER resident enzyme acyl-coenzyme A:cholesterol acyltransferase 1 (ACAT1) (reviewed in Refs. 5Patterson M.C.

Late endosomes exhibit long distance, bidirectional motility between the peripheral region and the perinuclear region of the cells (13Lebrand C. Corti M. Goodson H. Cosson P. Cavalli V. Mayran N. Faure J. Gruenberg J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1289-1300Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). In general, the motility of endosomal organelles depends on microtubules, various motor proteins, and Rab proteins (reviewed in Ref. 14Seabra M.C. Coudrier E. Traffic. 2004; 5: 393-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Rab proteins are a family of small GTPases present in various endosomal organelles and play important roles in membrane trafficking events (reviewed in Ref. 15Pfeffer S.R. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 487-491Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). Recently, it was shown that in cells that display NPC-like phenotypes, cholesterol derived from LDL accumulates and blocks the dissociation of Rab7, a Rab protein mainly located in the late endosomes, from its regulator protein guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor, causing the Rab7 protein to be locked in an inactive state and significantly diminishing the motility of the late endosomes (13Lebrand C. Corti M. Goodson H. Cosson P. Cavalli V. Mayran N. Faure J. Gruenberg J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1289-1300Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). This study links late endosomal motility with intracellular cholesterol trafficking activities. The accumulation of cholesterol in NPC cells also inhibits the function of Rab4, a different GTPase that is mainly located in the earlier endosomes (16Choudhury A. Sharma D.K. Marks D.L. Pagano R.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 4500-4511Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). In addition to receiving cholesterol via LDL, essentially all mammalian cells also synthesize cholesterol endogenously (endo-CHOL). The de novo biosynthesis of endo-CHOL uses acetyl coenzyme A as the simple precursor and involves many enzymatic reactions. The terminal stage of endo-CHOL synthesis is at the ER (reviewed in Ref. 17Gibbons G.F. Mitropoulos K.A. Myant N.B. Biochemistry of Cholesterol. Elsevier/North-Holland Biomedical Press, Amsterdam1982Google Scholar). Once synthesized, the nascent endo-CHOL is rapidly transported in an energydependent manner to the caveolae/lipid raft microdomain of the PM within 10-20 min (18Urbani L. Simoni R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1919-1923Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Smart E.J. Ying Y. Donzell W.C. Anderson R.G.W. J. Biol.

A. 2000; 97: 8375-8380Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). These processes do not require NPC1 (22Liscum L. Ruggiero R.M. Faust J.R. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 1625-1636Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). At the PM, endo-CHOL may recycle rapidly (within minutes) between the PM and the recycling endosomes (23Hao M. Lin S.X. Karylowski O.J. Wustner D. McGraw T.E. Maxfield F.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 609-617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Other fate(s) of the endo-CHOL remains largely unclear. However, it is known that in mutant NPC1 cells, 8 h or longer after its initial synthesis, a certain portion of endo-CHOL is significantly trapped within the late endosomes; the entrapment partially disables the recycling of endo-CHOL from the late endosomes to the PM and its movement to the ER for esterification by ACAT1 (24Cruz J.C. Chang T.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 41309-41316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 25Lange Y. Ye J. Rigney M. Steck T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17468-17475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Thus, similar to the LDL-CHOL, the post-PM intracellular trafficking of endo-CHOL partially depends on NPC1. These results suggest that endo-CHOL that traverses through the endocytic compartment may play important role(s) in controlling the function/properties of the late endosome(s). In the this study, we used wild-type (WT) and various well characterized mutant Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells as tools and investigated the role of endo-CHOL in the endocytic pathway. We blocked endo-CHOL synthesis by treating cells with lovastatin (also called mevinolin) and mevalonate. Lovastatin is the drug that blocks endo-CHOL synthesis by inhibiting the key enzyme HMG-CoA reductase in the earlier part of the sterol biosynthesis pathway (26Alberts A.W. Chen J. Kuron G. Hunt V. Huff J. Hoffman C. Rothrock J. Lopez M. Joshua H. Harris E. Patchett A. Monaghan R. Currie S. Stapley E. Alberts-Schonberg G. Hensens O. Hirshfield J. Hoogsteen K. Liesch J. Springer J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 3957-3961Crossref PubMed Scopus (1455) Google Scholar). Mevalonate is the reaction product of HMG-CoA reductase. It is an obligatory intermediate for all isoprenoids, including cholesterol, ubiquinone, dolichol, etc., that are all needed for cell growth and survival (reviewed in Ref. 27Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Nature. 1990; 343: 425-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (4534) Google Scholar). When added to the culture medium, only a small amount of mevalonate can enter the cell interior; it cannot satisfy the needs of the lovastatin-treated cells for sterol, but it enables them to synthesize various other mevalonate-derived nonsterol metabolites necessary for cell growth. We examined the endocytic activities of the cells by monitoring the fate of cholesterol liberated from the low density lipoprotein LDL (LDL-CHOL). Our results indicate that endo-CHOL plays a significant role in maintaining the functions of the late endosomes. Materials—Fetal bovine serum (FBS), 2-hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin (CD), paraformaldehyde, and mevalonic acid (mevalonate) were from Sigma. The lipid-free FBS was prepared as described (28Chin J.

The rabbit anti-NPC2 polyclonal antiserum was a generous gift from Dr. Peter Lobel (Robert Wood Johnson Medical School). The monoclonal antibody against hamster Lamp2 was from Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank maintained by the University of Iowa. The mouse anti-β-actin antibody (clone AC-74) was from Sigma. LDL (density of 1.019-1.063 g/ml) was prepared from fresh human plasma by sequential flotation as described previously (30Cadigan K.M. Heider J.G. Chang T.Y. J. Biol.

[3H]Cholesteryl linoleate-labeled LDL ([3H]CL-LDL) with specific radioactivity of ∼5 × 104 cpm/mg protein was prepared according to published procedure (31Faust J.R. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J.

The Rab9-YFP expression plasmid was a gift of Dr. Yiannis Ioannou (Mount Sinai School of Medicine) (34Walter M. Davies J.P. Ioannou Y.A. J. Lipid Res. 2003; 44: 243-253Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Production of Antibodies against Hamster NPC1 (DM105)—The N-terminal portion of the hamster NPC1 protein (amino acid residues 35-172, ∼34 kDa) was expressed as a fusion protein adduct with the bacterial protein GST. To produce the fusion protein, the primer sets used for PCR are as follows: forward primer, CGCGGATCCTTTGGAGATAAGAAGTACAAC (corresponding to BamHI restriction site and to the nucleotide sequence 103-123 of hamster NPC1 (38Cruz J.C. Sugii S. Yu C. Chang T.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4013-4021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar)); reverse primer, CCGGAATTCGGCCTTCTCATTACTTGCAGG (corresponding to EcoRI restriction site and to the nucleotide sequence 498-516 of hamster NPC1). The resulting PCR product was digested with BamHI and EcoRI and ligated into the pGEX-4T1 vector (Amersham Biosciences) that had been digested with BamHI and EcoRI, followed by gel purification. The fusion protein was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified by SDS-PAGE, based on the procedure employed previously (29Chang C.C.Y. Sakashita N. Ornvold K. Lee O. Chang E.T. Dong R. Lin S. Lee C.Y. Strom S.C. Kashyap R. Fung J.J. Farese Jr., R.V. Patoiseau J.F. Delhon A. Chang T.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28083-28092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). The purified protein in 0.2% SDS solution was sent to Cocalico Co. (Philadelphia, PA) to generate antisera in rabbits. The antisera were purified via GST-NPC1 fusion protein affinity column chromatography and stored at 4 °C in 0.1 m Trisglycine buffer, pH 7.0, under sterile conditions. Immunoblotting Analysis—Western blotting with anti-NPC1 polyclonal antibodies (DM105) was performed as follows. WT CHO cells were solubilized in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, and protease inhibitors mixture (Sigma)) on ice for 30 min, followed by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 20 min at 4 °C. After adding (4×) SDS-loading buffer with 0.1 m dithiothreitol to the solubilized cell lysate, the samples were kept on ice until the SDS-PAGE analysis. Treating the samples in SDS at 37 or 60 °C caused a large loss in NPC1 signal in Western blotting (result not shown). The primary antibodies used were the affinity-purified IgG against the GST-NPC1 protein, at 0.8 μg/ml, in TBS, 0.3% Tween 20 buffer containing 1% skim milk. Western blotting with anti-NPC2 polyclonal antisera was performed essentially as described previously (7Ohgami N. Ko D.C. Thomas M. Scott M.P. Chang C.C. Chang T.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 12473-12478Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Results of Western blots were quantified by using the NIH image (version 1.63). To normalize the values, the mean pixel intensities obtained with anti-NPC1 or with anti-NPC2 were divided by those obtained with anti-β-actin. Cell Lines and Procedures for Cell Culture Work—WT CHO cells were originally from the ATCC. 25RA cells were derived from the WT CHO cells; they are resistant to the cytotoxicity of 25-hydroxycholesterol (35Chang T.Y. Limanek J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 7787-7795Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and contain a gain of function mutation in the sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP) cleavage-activating protein (SCAP) (36Hua X. Nohturfft A. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Cell. 1996; 87: 415-426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). CT43 mutant cells were isolated as one of the cholesterol-trafficking mutants from mutagenized 25RA cells (37Cadigan K.M. Spillane D.M. Chang T.Y. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 295-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), containing a premature translational termination mutation near the 3′-end of the NPC1 coding sequence and producing a nonfunctional, truncated NPC1 protein (38Cruz J.C. Sugii S. Yu C. Chang T.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4013-4021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). M19 cells were isolated from mutagenized WT CHO cells; these cells fail to respond to sterol-dependent regulation of HMG-CoA reductase and LDL receptors (39Hasan M.T. Chang C.C.Y. Chang T.Y. Somatic Cell Mol. Genet. 1994; 20: 183-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) because these cells contain a deletion mutation in site 2 protease that is required to cleave the SREBP into an active form (40Rawson R.B. Zelenski N.G. Nijhawan D. Ye J. Sakai J. Hasan M.T. Chang T.Y. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Mol. Cell. 1997; 1: 47-57Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). LEX1 cells are mutant CHO cells isolated from WT cells. LEX1 cells exhibit defects in fusion between the late endosomes and the lysosomes and are defective in the disintegration of LDL particles labeled with fluorescent phospholipids (41Ohashi M. Miwako I. Nakamura K. Yamamoto A. Murata M. Ohnishi S. Nagayama K. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 1125-1138Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The molecular lesion of the LEX1 cells is unknown. The LEX2 mutant cells were also isolated from WT CHO cells; they exhibit an arrested multivesicular body (MVB) and show defects in the transport of the cation-independent mannose 6-phosphate receptor from the MVB back to the trans-Golgi network (TGN). In addition, these mutant cells contain another defect in the transport of lysosomal proteins and apoB100 in LDL to the late endosomes (42Ohashi M. Miwako I. Yamamoto A. Nagayama K. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 2187-2205Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). LEX2 cells contain a molecular lesion in the gene encoding NAD(P)H-dependent sterol dehydrogenase-like protein (NSDHL), an enzyme in the late stage of the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway. A stable transfectant of LEX2 cells that expresses an active NSDHL, called the LEX2LIB3 cell, has been reported (43Miwako I. Yamamoto A. Kitamura T. Nagayama K. Ohashi M. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 1765-1776Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The expression of this enzyme resulted in the correction of the cholesterol biosynthesis defect in the LEX2 cells. In LEX2LIB3 cells, the transport of cation-independent mannose 6-phosphate receptor from the MVB to the TGN is normal, and the arrested MVB disappears. However, the defective processing of endocytosed LDL to the degradative compartment remains uncorrected, suggesting that in the LEX2LIB3 cells, there remains a defect in the late stage of the endocytic pathway (43Miwako I. Yamamoto A. Kitamura T. Nagayama K. Ohashi M. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 1765-1776Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The LEX1 and LEX2 cells belong to different complementation groups. All of the CHO cells were maintained in Medium A (Ham's F-12 plus 10% FBS and 10 mg/ml gentamycin) as monolayers at 37 °C with 5% CO2. Medium A contains bovine LDL, which provides LDL-CHOL. Medium D refers to Ham's F-12 supplemented with 5% lipid-free FBS plus 35 mm oleic acid and 10 mg/ml gentamycin. Medium D lacks LDL-CHOL. Medium S refers to Medium D plus 50 μm lovastatin and 230 μm mevalonate. In cells grown in Medium S, the endo-CHOL synthesis rate is 99% inhibited (37Cadigan K.M. Spillane D.M. Chang T.Y. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 295-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). When Medium D or Medium S was used at lower temperatures (18 °C or lower), Ham's F-12 without sodium bicarbonate was used, and cells were placed in a water bath without CO2. Assays to Monitor the Fate of [3H]Cholesteryl Linoleate in LDL—Cells were plated in Medium A in 6- or 12-well dishes, as described previously (38Cruz J.C. Sugii S. Yu C. Chang T.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4013-4021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 24Cruz J.C. Chang T.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 41309-41316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), and were cultured for 36 h in Medium D to deplete stored cholesterol within the cell. Prior to labeling, cells were pre-chilled on ice, then labeled with 30 μg/ml [3H]CL-LDL in Medium D for 5 h at 18°C, washed once with cold PBS that contained 1% bovine serum albumin, and washed three more times with cold PBS. Cells were then fed with cold Medium D and placed in a water bath for the indicated chase time at 37 °C. At 18 °C, LDL was internalized and accumulated in pre-lysosomal compartments without significant hydrolysis of CL. When the temperature was increased to 37 °C, CL in LDL was rapidly hydrolyzed to become free cholesterol and transported to designated locations in a time-dependent manner (3Sugii S. Reid P.C.

Total uptake of LDL was calculated as the sum of [3H]cholesteryl linoleate, [3H]cholesterol, and [3H]cholesteryl oleate counts divided by the cellular protein amount. The protein amount was determined by the Bradford method using the assay reagent from Bio-Rad. For cholesterol efflux experiments, cells were incubated with 4% CD (as sterol acceptor) in Medium D in the presence of the ACAT inhibitor (2 μm F12511) (29Chang C.C.Y. Sakashita N. Ornvold K. Lee O.

In addition to the consensus sequence at the site of phosphorylation, a number of PDK1 substrates contain a PIF sequence (PDK1-interacting fragment), which binds and activates the kinase domain of PDK1 (PDK1(ΔPH)). To gain further insight to PIF-dependent catalysis, steady-state kinetic and inhibition studies were performed for His6-PDK1(ΔPH)-catalyzed phosphorylation of PDK1-Tide (Tide), which contains an extended “PIF” sequence C-terminal to the consensus sequence for PDK1 phosphorylation. In two-substrate kinetics, a large degree of negative binding synergism was observed to occur on formation of the active ternary complex (αKdATP=40μM and αKdTide=80μM ) from individual transitory binary complexes (KdATP=0.6μM and KdTide=1μM ). On varying ATP concentrations, the ADP product and the (T/E)-PDK1-Tide product analog (p′Tide) behaved as competitive and noncompetitive inhibitors, respectively; on varying Tide concentrations, ADP and p′Tide behaved as noncompetitive and competitive inhibitors, respectively. Also, negative binding synergism was associated with formation of dead-end inhibited ternary complexes. Time progress curves in pre-steady-state studies under “saturating” or kcat conditions showed (i) no burst or lag phenomena, (ii) no change in reaction velocity when adenosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate) was used as a phosphate donor, and (iii) no change in reaction velocity on increasing relative microviscosity (0 ≤ η/η0 ≤ 3). Taken together, PDK1-catalyzed trans-phosphorylation of PDK1-Tide approximates a Rapid Equilibrium Random Bi Bi system, where motions in the central ternary complex are largely rate-determining.

Among these kinases, amino acid sequences are conserved in a segment of the kinase domain known as the activation loop or T-loop, as well as in a segment C-terminal to the kinase domain known as the hydrophobic motif; and phosphorylation sites or acidic residues in these regions play important roles in their catalytic regulation and/or stability.

Whereas the activation loop residue appears to be constitutively phosphorylated in PKA, PKCα, and PKCβII, PDK1-catalyzed phosphorylation of PKB, SGK, S6K, RSK, PKCδ, and PKCζ occurs in response to cellular agonists acting through a common phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathway, albeit with differing temporal regulation (20Belham C.

J. 2003; 372: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). The common ability of PDK1 to catalyze phosphorylation of the activation loop of its numerous protein targets, but with varying degrees and mechanisms of regulation, has been explained from the intriguing perspective that PDK1 has the ability to “sense the conformation” of many of its substrates (24Biondi R.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2004; 29: 136-142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). PDK1 and other AGC kinases possess a “PIF (PDK1-interacting fragment) pocket” on the catalytic kinase domain (25Biondi R.M. Cheung P.C.F. Casamayor A. Deak M. Currie R.A. Alessi D.R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 979-988Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 26Biondi R.M. Komander D. Thomas C.C. Lizcano J.M. Deak M. Alessi D.R. van Aalten D.M.F. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4219-4228Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). In contrast to other AGC kinases, PDK1 does not possess a hydrophobic motif C-terminal to its catalytic domain. Therefore, the PIF pocket of PDK1 is accessible for interaction with the phosphorylated hydrophobic motifs of its target kinases. Such intermolecular interaction promotes activation of PDK1, enabling PDK1-catalyzed phosphorylation of target kinases at the activation loop. Upon phosphorylation of the activation loop, the phosphorylated C-terminal hydrophobic motif of the target kinase is released from the PIF pocket on PDK1, and it forms an intramolecular interaction with its own PIF pocket, which fully stabilizes an active conformation (24Biondi R.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2004; 29: 136-142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Both in vivo and in vitro studies indicated the important role of intermolecular PIF interactions in activating PDK1-catalyzed phosphorylation of S6K, RSK, and SGK (27Biondi R.M. Kieloch A. Currie R.A. Deak M. Alessi D.R. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4380-4390Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar, 28Frödin M. Jensen C.J. Merienne K. Gammeltoft S.

EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5396-5407Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). To further investigate the role of PIF interactions, a model “PIF-Tide” was synthesized to contain the C-terminal hydrophobic motif region of protein kinase C-related kinase-2. The PIF region in protein kinase C-related kinase-2 contains high sequence homology to the PIF regions of PDK1 protein substrates, except that the Ser/Thr phosphorylation site is replaced by a negatively charged Asp residue (Fig. 1B) (25Biondi R.M.

Downes C.P. Alessi D.R. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 393-404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). Surface plasmon resonance and competition measurements yielded KdPIF values of ∼0.8–1.5 μm, indicating a strong binary complex between PIF-Tide and PDK1 (30Balendran A. Casamayor A. Deak M. Paterson A. Gaffney P. Currie R. Downes C.P. Alessi D.R. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 393-404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). In addition, PIF-Tide was found to activate PDK1-catalyzed phosphorylation of the small T308-Tide, which represents the consensus motif near the site of phosphorylation in PKBα (Fig. 1B) (25Biondi R.M. Cheung P.C.F. Casamayor A. Deak M. Currie R.A. Alessi D.R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 979-988Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). By conjugating the PIF-Tide to the C terminus of T308-Tide, the PDK1-Tide was generated (Fig. 1B) (25Biondi R.M. Cheung P.C.F. Casamayor A. Deak M. Currie R.A. Alessi D.R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 979-988Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). PDK1-Tide remains the prevailing model PDK1 substrate, as it undergoes phosphorylation at a rate >100-fold than T308-Tide, and its Km of ∼80 μm is significantly lower than the Km of >10 mm estimated for T308-Tide. Whereas x-ray structural and mutagenesis studies have clearly defined PIF pocket residues important to catalytic activation of PDK1 (25Biondi R.M. Cheung P.C.F. Casamayor A. Deak M. Currie R.A.

EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4219-4228Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), a detailed kinetic study of this process awaits description. Here, we report kinetic and chemical/solution perturbation studies aimed to establish the steady-state kinetic mechanism for PDK1-catalyzed trans-phosphorylation of PDK1-Tide. The results of these studies are best approximated a Rapid Equilibrium Random Bi Bi system, where conformational steps in the central ternary complex are largely rate-determining. Most interesting was the apparently large degree of negative binding synergism exhibited between the peptide and nucleotide substrates/products. Such synergism may derive from conformational transitions important to catalytic turnover. Materials and General Methods—The catalytic kinase domain of PDK1 (His6-PDK1(ΔPH), residues 51–359) (26Biondi R.M. Komander D. Thomas C.C. Lizcano J.M. Deak M. Alessi D.R. van Aalten D.M.F. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4219-4228Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), containing an N-terminal His6 tag followed by a PreScission protease recognition sequence prior to residue 51, was expressed using the Bac-to-Bac® Baculovirus Expression System (Invitrogen) and His6 affinity purified as described (31Gao X. Yo P. Harris T.K. Protein Expression Purif. 2005; 43: 44-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Protein concentration was estimated using the Bio-Rad Protein Assay Kit with bovine serum albumin as a standard. PDK1-Tide and (T/E)-PDK1-Tide were from 21st Century Biochemicals, Inc. (Marlboro, MA). [γ-32P]ATP and [γ-35S]ATPγS were from MP Biomedical (Irvine, CA). All other chemicals, salts, and buffers were from Sigma. Two-substrate Steady-state Kinetic Assays—Steady-state kinetic assays were carried out for His6-PDK1(ΔPH)-catalyzed trans-phosphorylation of the PDK1-Tide model peptide substrate (Fig. 1B). The 65-μl peptide phosphorylation reactions were performed at 30 °C in reaction buffer containing final concentrations of 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, 0.1% 2-mercaptoethanol, 10 mm MgCl2, and 0.2 mm sodium vanadate. Initial velocities were measured for varying PDK1-Tide concentrations (0.3, 1, 3, 10, 30, 100, and 300 μm) at different fixed concentrations of [γ-32P]ATP (∼500 cpm/pmol; 0.3, 1, 3, 10, 30, 100, and 300 μm). Data collection in this manner provided all information necessary to construct companion reciprocal plots for the two varied substrates. After 5 min preincubation of a 60-μl reaction mixture containing both substrates at 30 °C, the assays were initiated by addition of a 5-μl amount of a stock concentration of His6-PDK1(ΔPH) to yield final enzyme concentrations of 5–30 nm. For kinase assays where both the ATP and PDK1-Tide concentrations were ≥3 μm, 20-μl aliquots were removed and quenched at three different times (ranging from 5 to 60 min). For kinase assays where either the ATP or PDK1-Tide concentration was ≤1 μm, it was necessary to extend some reaction times up to 3 h to obtain the minimal detectable amounts of 32P-radiolabeled PDK1-Tide (300–600 cpm) in a 20-μl reaction aliquot (∼0.6–1.2 pmol or 30–60 nm). Each 20-μl reaction aliquot was quenched by mixing with 20 μl of 50 mm phosphoric acid, which was then applied to P81 phosphocellulose paper (2 × 2 cm). After 30 s, the papers were washed in 50 mm phosphoric acid for 10 min, then rinsed with acetone, and placed in the hood (≤5 min) to dry. The amount of 32P-labeled peptide was determined by scintillation counting of the paper in 10 ml of scintillation mixture. Initial rates for reactions containing ≥1 μm of both substrates were measured under conditions where total product formation represented ≤10% of the initial concentration of the limiting substrate. Due to detection limits, initial rates for reactions containing 0.3 μm of either substrate were measured under conditions where total product formation (30–60 nm) represented 10–20% of the initial limiting substrate concentration. Because it was often necessary to use 30 nm enzyme to catalyze 30–60 nm product under these limiting conditions, it is important to point out these initial velocities were obtained under pre-steady-state conditions. However, the initial velocities obtained under these conditions approximate those obtained under true steady-state conditions, as demonstrated by more rigorous pre-steady-state experiments described later in this paper, which provide no evidence of burst or lag phenomena. Initial velocities (v, m s−1) were normalized to enzyme concentration to yield apparent first-order rate constants (k, s−1), which better facilitate kinetic comparisons between steady-state and pre-steady-state kinetic results. Control assays were carried out in which either the enzyme or PDK1-Tide were omitted; these values were always ≤5% of the activity measured in the presence of both the lower- and upper-bound concentrations of these reagents (0.3 and 300 μm [γ-32P]ATP; 5 and 30 nm enzyme). Control assays containing the enzyme and only the [γ-32P]ATP substrate were further analyzed to measure ATPase activity. The amount of [32P]inorganic phosphate released from [γ-32P]ATP was determined by addition of 50 μl of the reaction mixture to 100 μl of a quench solution containing a 21% suspension of acid-washed (HCl) activated charcoal in 75 mm phosphoric acid. The quenched solution was mixed and placed on ice for 5 min, which provided for effective removal of the [γ-32P]ATP nucleotide from solution by the charcoal. The charcoal with bound [γ-32P]ATP was pelleted by centrifugation for 10 min, and a 60-μl aliquot of the supernatant was analyzed for [32P]inorganic phosphate. 32P radioactivity in the supernatant was always ≤5% of the radioactivity measured in the absence of enzyme, indicating that the ATPase activity of His6-PDK1(ΔPH) is significantly lower than activity to the PDK1-Tide substrate. Product and Dead-end Inhibition Steady-state Kinetic Assays—Diagnostic enzyme inhibition studies were carried out for His6-PDK1(ΔPH)-catalyzed transphosphorylation of PDK1-Tide exactly as described for two-substrate kinetics. ADP was tested as a product inhibitor and a phospho-PDK1-Tide mimetic in which the number 2 Thr residue that undergoes phosphorylation was replaced by a Glu residue ((T/E)-PDK1-Tide, Fig. 1B)) was used as a dead-end product analog inhibitor. In both cases, initial velocities were measured for varying substrate concentrations (0.3, 1, 3, 10, 30, 100, and 300 μm) at different fixed concentrations of the inhibitor (0, 10, 30, 50, 70, and 100 μm) at an unsaturating concentration of the other substrate (30 μm). Data collection in this manner provided information necessary to construct companion plots for “diagnostic” analysis of the effect of either the ADP or (T/E)-Tide inhibitors on the two different varied substrates. In contrast to the diagnostic inhibition studies, a full array of data sets was collected for product inhibition with ADP. Initial velocities were measured for varying PDK1-Tide concentrations (0.3, 1, 3, 10, 30, 100, and 300 μm) at different fixed concentrations of ADP (0, 1, 3, 10, 30, and 100 μm). In this case, ADP product inhibition was also measured at different fixed concentrations of [γ-32P]ATP (0.3, 1, 3, 10, 30, 100, and 300 μm). Data collection in this manner provided all information necessary to construct companion plots for complete kinetic analysis of the effect of ADP on the two different varied substrates. Pre-steady-state Kinetic Assays—Pre-steady-state kinetic assays were carried out for His6-PDK1(ΔPH)-catalyzed transphosphorylation of PDK1-Tide using a KinTek Corporation (Austin, TX) model RQF-3 rapid quench-flow apparatus thermostatted at 30 °C. Reaction buffer refers to 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, 0.1% 2-mercaptoethanol, 10 mm MgCl2, and 0.2 mm sodium vanadate. The left and right drive syringes in the RQF apparatus were filled with reaction buffer, and the middle (quench) syringe was filled with 75 mm phosphoric acid. One sample loop was loaded with 15 μl of reaction buffer containing 600 μm of both PDK1-Tide and [γ-32P]ATP; and the other sample loop contained 15 μl of varying concentrations of His6-PDK1(ΔPH) enzyme (2, 6, and 10 μm) in reaction buffer. Thio-substitution effects were determined by equivalent substitution of [γ-35S]ATPγS for [γ-32P]ATP. The phosphorylation reaction was initiated by mixing the contents of the sample loops that was allowed to react for a time t (0.05 ≤ t ≤ 10 s) before the reaction was acid quenched. For each time point, two 20-μl aliquots of each quenched reaction solution were individually applied to P81 phosphocellulose paper (2 × 2 cm), and the amount of PDK1-Tide phosphorylation was quantified as described for the steady-state kinetic assays. The time courses were performed in triplicate and the data points represent averaged values ± S.E. Control assays were carried out in which the PDK1-Tide substrate was omitted for each enzyme concentration in the presence of either [γ-32P]ATP or [γ-35S]ATPγS. The amounts of 32P or 35S radioactivity detected on the filter paper were always ≤5% of the measured radioactivity in the presence of PDK1-Tide, indicating that purified active pS241 His6-PDK1(ΔPH) catalyzes little or no nonspecific autophosphorylation during reaction times ≤10 s. In addition, the amounts of 32P or 35S radioactivity hydrolyzed from either [γ-32P]ATP or [γ-35S]ATPγS during this time period were shown to be negligible by the charcoal filtration assay. Solution Viscometric Studies—Pre-steady-state assays containing either [γ-32P]ATP or [γ-35S]ATPγS as described above were also carried out in reaction buffer containing varying amounts of either microviscogen (0–30% (w/v) glycerol or sucrose) or macroviscogen (0–6.3% (w/v) polyethylene glycol). The relative viscosities (η/η0) of reaction buffers containing either a micro- or macroviscogen were calculated at 30 °C, using an Ostwald viscometer to measure transit times and correcting for density. Relative solvent viscosities of 1.0 and 3.0 were obtained for buffers containing 0 and 30% sucrose, respectively. The measurements were made in triplicate and did not deviate by more than 3%. Data Analysis—Initial rates determined in the two-substrate steady-state kinetic studies were globally fitted to Equation 1,v(Ms-1)[PDK1](M)=k(s-1)=kcat[ATP][Tide]αKdATPKdTide+αKdTide[ATP]+αKdATP[Tide]+[ATP][Tide](Eq. 1) the general velocity equation derived for a Rapid Equilibrium Random Bi Bi system (32Segel I.H. Enzyme Kinetics. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1975Google Scholar). In this equation, v/[PDK1] = k(s−1) yields the observed pseudo-first order rate constant as a function of ATP and PDK1-Tide concentrations ([ATP] and [Tide]) according to the dissociation constants of ATP and PDK1-Tide (KdATP and KdTide ). The symbol α is a proportionality constant, which quantifies the degree that the binding of one substrate either increases (α < 1) or decreases (α > 1) the affinity of the enzyme for the other substrate. In addition, initial rates for varying the concentrations of either [ATP] or [Tide] were individually fitted to the standard Michaelis-Menten equation to obtain values of kcat(app) and either Km(app)ATP (at different fixed [Tide]) or Km(app)Tide (at different fixed [ATP]), respectively, which were further analyzed by the appropriate secondary expressions derived from Equation 1. Secondary plots of kcat(app) versus either [Tide] or [ATP] were fitted to Equations 2 and 3, respectively (32Segel I.H. Enzyme Kinetics. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1975Google Scholar).kcat(app)=kcat[Tide]αKdTide+[Tide](Eq. 2) kcat(app)=kcat[ATP]αKdATP+[ATP](Eq. 3) Secondary plots of either Km(app)ATP versus [Tide] or Km(app)ATP versus [ATP] were fitted to Equations 4 and 5, respectively (32Segel I.H. Enzyme Kinetics. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1975Google Scholar).Km(app)ATP=αKdATP[Tide]+αKdTideKdATP[Tide]+αKdTide(Eq. 4) Km(app)Tide=αKdTide[ATP]+αKdATPKdTide[ATP]+αKdATP(Eq. 5) Initial rates determined in steady-state kinetic dead-end inhibition studies were fitted to the general velocity equations derived for competitive and noncompetitive mechanisms of inhibition, respectively (32Segel I.H. Enzyme Kinetics. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1975Google Scholar). In these equations, values of kcat(app), Km(app), and Ki(app) were determined for varying substrate and inhibitor concentrations at a single fixed concentration of the other substrate. Initial rates determined in the complete array of ADP inhibition studies were globally fitted to Equation 6,k(s-1)=kcat[ATP][Tide]αKdATPKdTide1+[ATP]KdATP+[Tide]KdTide+[ADP]KiADP+[ATP][Tide]αKdATPKdTide+[ADP][Tide]βKiADPKdTide(Eq. 6) which is the general velocity equation derived for a Rapid Equilibrium Random Bi Bi system with a dead-end PDK1-ADP-Tide ternary complex (32Segel I.H. Enzyme Kinetics. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1975Google Scholar). In this equation, the parameters are the same as described for Equation 1, but further include KADPi, the dissociation constant of the ADP product inhibitor, and β, the proportionality constant to quantify the degree that the binding of Tide substrate either increases (β < 1) or decreases (β > 1) the affinity of the enzyme for ADP. Values of kcat(app), Km(app)ATP , Km(app)Tide , and Ki(app)ADP that were obtained from fits of individual ADP inhibition data sets were further analyzed by the appropriate secondary expressions derived from Equation 6. In these cases, secondary expressions for kcat(app) versus either [Tide] or [ATP] are the same as Equations 2 and 3, respectively; and secondary expressions for either Km(app)ATP versus [Tide] or Km(app)ATP versus [ATP] are the same as Equations 4 and 5, respectively (32Segel I.H. Enzyme Kinetics. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1975Google Scholar). Secondary expressions of either Ki(app)ADP versus [Tide] or Ki(app)ADP versus [ATP] are given by Equations 7 and 8, respectively (32Segel I.H. Enzyme Kinetics. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1975Google Scholar).Ki(app)ADP=βKiADP[Tide]+βKdTideKiADP[Tide]+βKdTide(Eq. 7) Ki(app)ADP=βKiADPαKdATP[ATP]+βKiADP(Eq. 8) All data were plotted and fitted using the GraFit 4.0 software (Erithacus Software, UK), which utilizes an iterative least squares algorithm (33Leatherbarrow R.J. GraFit. Erithacus Software Ltd., Staines, United Kingdom1998Google Scholar). Two-substrate Steady-state Kinetics of His6-PDK1(ΔPH)—As demonstrated in a previous study, the recombinant catalytic domain construct of PDK1 (His6-PDK1(ΔPH), residues 51–359) was affinity purified (≥95%) from Sf9 insect cell lysate in its Ser241 phosphorylated and catalytically active form (26Biondi R.M.

Whereas His6-PDK1(ΔPH) exhibited detectable activity toward trans-phosphorylation of T308-Tide, we confirmed that His6-PDK1(ΔPH), similar to full-length PDK1 (25Biondi R.M. Cheung P.C.F. Casamayor A. Deak M. Currie R.A. Alessi D.R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 979-988Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar), exhibits very low affinity for T308-Tide with Km ≥ 10 mm. In contrast to T308-Tide, His6-PDK1(ΔPH) exhibited significantly higher activity to PDK1-Tide, which contains the extended PIF residues C-terminal to the sequence of T308-Tide (Fig. 1B). Most important, saturating conditions could be approached with PDK1-Tide enabling steady-state kinetic determinations of values for kcat(app), Km(app)Tide , and Km(app)ATP .

Although architecturally resembling voltage-gated ion channels, neither CatSper1 nor CatSper2 alone forms functional ion channels in heterologous expression systems, which may be related to the absence of yet unidentified accessory subunits. Here we isolated CatSper1- and CatSper2-associated protein(s) from human sperm and analyzed their identities by a multidimensional protein identification technology approach. We identified the T-type voltage-gated calcium channel Cav3.3 as binding to both CatSper1 and CatSper2. The specificity of their interactions was verified by co-immunoprecipitation in transfected mammalian cells. Electrophysiological studies revealed that the co-expression of CatSper1 or CatSper2 specifically inhibited the amplitude of Cav3.3-evoked T-type calcium current without altering other biophysical properties of Cav3.3. Immunostaining studies revealed co-localization of CatSper1 and Cav3.3 on the principal piece of human sperm tail. Furthermore, fluorescence resonance energy transfer analysis revealed close proximity and physical association of these two proteins on the sperm tail. These studies demonstrate that CatSper1 and CatSper2 can associate with and modulate the function of the Cav3.3 channel, which might be important in the regulation of sperm function.

These studies demonstrate that CatSper1 and CatSper2 can associate with and modulate the function of the Cav3.3 channel, which might be important in the regulation of sperm function. Sperm must swim long distances in the female reproductive tract to reach the site of fertilization. In addition, penetration through the gelatinous zona pellucida layer of the oocyte requires the sperm to swim in a hyperactivated state at the time and site of fertilization. This process is characterized by high amplitude and asymmetric beating of the sperm tail. Many studies have indicated that Ca2+ serves as a key regulator in the initiation and maintenance of motility, including the hyperactivated motility (for reviews see Refs. 1Suarez S.S. Ho H.C. Cell. Mol. Biol. 2003; 49: 351-356PubMed Google Scholar and 2Breitbart H. Cell. Mol. Biol. 2003; 49: 321-327PubMed Google Scholar).Extensive efforts have been undertaken to identify and characterize Ca2+ entry pathways, particularly Ca2+ channels, involved in sperm motility processes. Two such ion channel-like proteins, CatSper1 and CatSper2, were shown to be specifically expressed in the principal piece of the sperm tail (3Ren D. Navarro B. Perez G. Jackson A.C. Hsu S. Shi Q. Tilly J.L. Clapham D.E. Nature. 2001; 413: 603-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (689) Google Scholar, 4Quill T.A. Ren D. Clapham D.E. Garbers D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 12527-12531Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Targeted disruption of CatSper1 led to sterile phenotypes in otherwise normal male mice. Further studies revealed that mutant sperm lack hyperactivated motility (5Carlson A.E. Westenbroek R.E. Quill T. Ren D. Clapham D.E. Hille B. Garbers D.L. Babcock D.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 14864-14868Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). In vitro fertilization assays revealed that CatSper1 mutant sperm could not fertilize eggs with an intact zona pellucida layer but could fertilize eggs whose outer layers had been enzymatically removed (3Ren D. Navarro B. Perez G. Jackson A.C. Hsu S. Shi Q. Tilly J.L. Clapham D.E. Nature. 2001; 413: 603-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (689) Google Scholar). Targeted disruption of CatSper2 also led to male sterile phenotypes, and the null sperm has identical loss-of-function phenotypes as does the CatSper1 null sperm (6Quill T.A. Sugden S.A. Rossi K.L. Doolittle L.K. Hammer R.E. Garbers D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 14869-14874Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar, 7Carlson A.E. Quill T.A. Westenbroek R.E. Schuh S.M.

Therefore, CatSper1 and CatSper2 proteins appear to be essential for hyperactivated motility needed late for the sperm to penetrate the zona pellucida.CatSper1 and CatSper2 represent a unique class of putative ion channel proteins (for a review see Ref. 8Zhang D. Gopalakrishnan M. J. Androl. 2005; 26: 643-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). They contain a single domain comprised of six transmembrane-spanning regions, akin to the voltage-gated potassium channels (3Ren D. Navarro B. Perez G. Jackson A.C. Hsu S. Shi Q. Tilly J.L. Clapham D.E. Nature. 2001; 413: 603-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (689) Google Scholar). However, their ion selectivity pore sequences between transmembrane regions 5 and 6 are closest to a single domain of the much larger voltage-gated Ca2+-selective channels. Residues lining the fourth transmembrane region of CatSper resemble a voltage sensor, as described for voltage-gated ion channels. However, recording ion channel activity following expression of CatSper subunits in heterologous expression systems, including Xenopus oocytes, HEK, 2The abbreviations used are: HEK, human embryonic kidney; MudPIT, multi-dimensional protein identification technology; GST, glutathione S-transferase; GFP, green fluorescent protein; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; FRET, Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer; NFRET, normalized FRET; DTT, dithiothreitol; pF, picofarad.2The abbreviations used are: HEK, human embryonic kidney; MudPIT, multi-dimensional protein identification technology; GST, glutathione S-transferase; GFP, green fluorescent protein; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; FRET, Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer; NFRET, normalized FRET; DTT, dithiothreitol; pF, picofarad. and Chinese hamster ovary K1 cells have not been successful (3Ren D.

Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 12527-12531Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Attempts to measure whole cell currents from the sperm have proven difficult until very recently, where an alkaline-activated Ca2+ current was recorded from sperm by patch clamp measurements (9Kirichok Y. Navarro B. Clapham D.E. Nature. 2006; 439: 737-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). Interestingly, this current is absent in sperm lacking CatSper1. However, considering the co-dependent expression of CatSper1 and CatSper2 (7Carlson A.E. Quill T.A. Westenbroek R.E. Schuh S.M. Hille B. Babcock D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 32238-32244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), it is still not clear which subunit or subunit complexes mediate this current.Although several possibilities may be envisaged, the inability to functionally express CatSper subunits may be due to the following: (i) the absence of sperm-specific accessory proteins necessary for a putative ion channel complex in the heterologous systems, as observed with other ion channel complexes, or (ii) that CatSper may function as an accessory subunit to modulate the function of the principal subunit of an undetermined ion channel. The potential for either scenario exists, and it is indeed noteworthy that coiled-coil protein-protein interaction domains are present in the C-terminal regions of each of the CatSper subunits (10Lobley A. Pierron V. Reynolds L. Allen L. Michalovich D. Reprod. Biol. Endocrinol. 2003; 1: 53Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). In this study, we adopted a GST pull-down approach to isolate CatSper-associated proteins from human sperm extracts, and we have identified the T-type calcium channel subunit Cav3.3 as an interacting protein. Electro-physiological studies revealed that the co-expression of either CatSper1 or CatSper2 specifically inhibited the amplitude of Cav3.3-evoked T-type Ca2+ current without altering other biophysical properties of Cav3.3. Considering that CatSper1 and Cav3.3 subunits are co-expressed and associated with each other on the tail of the human sperm, our observations suggest that CatSper-Cav3.3 interactions could play an important role in regulating sperm functions such as hyperactivated motility.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCloning—To generate FLAG-tagged human CatSper1 (GenBank™ accession number AF407333) and CatSper2 (GenBank™ accession number AF411818) expression constructs, the coding sequences of CatSper with an in-frame FLAG tag sequence were amplified by PCR and cloned into the NotI site of pIRESneo3 (Clontech). To generate pGEX-4T-1-Cat1-C to express the C terminus of CatSper1 as a GST fusion protein, the coding sequence covering the C-terminal 111 amino acids of human CatSper1 was amplified by PCR and cloned in-frame with GST in pGEX-4T-1 vector (Amersham Biosciences). To prepare pGEX-4T-1-Cat2-N and pGEX-4T-1-Cat2-C constructs for the expression of the N and C termini of CatSper2 as GST fusion proteins, respectively, the coding sequences covering the N-terminal 103 amino acids and C-terminal 190 amino acids of human CatSper2 were amplified by PCR and cloned in-frame with GST in pGEX-4T-1.To clone human Cav3.3 (GenBank™ accession number AF393329), portions of the coding sequence were amplified by reverse transcription-PCR against poly(A)+ RNA from human cerebellum (Clontech). These fragments were ligated together and cloned in pcDNA3.1/V5-His TOPO expression vector (Invitrogen) so as to generate pcDNA3.1-Cav3.3-V5/His with V5 and His tags in-frame with the C terminus of Cav3.3.Antibodies—To generate antibody against human CatSper1, the C-terminal 111 amino acids of CatSper1 as a GST fusion protein were purified from bacteria and were used to immunize rabbits. The CatSper1 C-terminal fragment, which was released from the GST fusion protein by thrombin cleavage, was used to affinity-purify antibodies against the CatSper1 part from the crude serum. The strategy as described by Quill et al. (4Quill T.A. Ren D. Clapham D.E. Garbers D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 12527-12531Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar) was adopted to generate rabbit antibody against a peptide derived from the C-terminal 27 amino acids of mouse CatSper2. The resulting antibody recognized the human CatSper2 as well. The following antibodies were obtained from the sources indicated: human Cav3.3 antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, and Alomone Labs, Israel), Na+/K+-ATPase antibody (Abcam, Cambridge, UK), PMCA4 antibody (Sigma), human 14-3-3ϵ antibody (Assay Designs, Ann Arbor, MI), V5 tag antibody (Invitrogen), and FLAG tag antibody (Sigma).GST Pulldown Assay—To prepare GST fusion proteins, pGEX-4T-1, pGEX-4T-1-Cat1-C, pGEX-4T-1-Cat2-N, and pGEX-4T-1-Cat2-C were transformed into BL21 Star(DE3) pLysS (Invitrogen), and the expressions of recombinant proteins were induced by 0.5 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. GST fusion proteins were purified from bacteria using glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Biosciences) according to the protocol recommended by the manufacturer. The purified proteins were eluted from the beads by a buffer containing glutathione, dialyzed, and re-conjugated on fresh beads to obtain purer fractions.To prepare human sperm extract, cryo-preserved sperm samples were washed to remove the seminal fluid and lysed in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 250 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm DTT and protease inhibitor mixture from Sigma) for 1 h. The extract was centrifuged to remove cell debris and combined with an equal volume of dilution buffer to bring down Nonidet P-40 and sodium deoxycholate concentration to 0.5%. The sperm extract was precleared by incubation with glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads for 1 h. To pull down CatSper-associated proteins, the sperm extract was divided into equal parts, and beads conjugated with GST (as a negative control), GST-Cat1-C, or a mixture of GST-Cat2-N and GST-Cat2-C proteins were added. After incubation at 4 °C with gentle rotation overnight, the beads were washed three times with 10 ml of ice-cold IP buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 250 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm DTT and protease inhibitor mixture from Sigma). The GST fusion proteins along with associated proteins on the washed beads were eluted in a buffer containing glutathione (100 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm glutathione, 0.2% Triton X-100).MudPIT Analysis of Protein Identities—Half of the eluted protein mixtures from GST pulldown experiments were resolved by SDS-PAGE and visualized by silver staining. Selective protein bands on the gel were excised, and the gel slices were destained and chopped into 1-mm size cubes. A slightly modified procedure originally developed by Shevchenko et al. (11Shevchenko A. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 850-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (7765) Google Scholar) was employed for in-gel digestion. The extracted peptides were lyophilized and resuspended in 15-20 μl of 5% formic acid until further analysis. The other portion of the eluted protein mixtures were subjected to in-solution digestion (12Link A.J. Eng J. Schieltz D.M. Carmack E. Mize G.J. Morris D.R. Garvik B.M. Yates J.R. II I Nat. Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 676-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (2061) Google Scholar) resulting in complex peptide mixtures. Peptide digests resulting from in-gel digests or in-solution digests were then individually loaded on to a three-phase MudPIT (RP-SCX-RP) column. A three-step MudPIT analysis was used for analyzing the in-gel digests, and a six-step MudPIT analysis was used for in-solution digests (13Wolters D.A. Washburn M.P. Yates J.R. II I Anal. Chem. 2001; 73: 5683-5690Crossref PubMed Scopus (1556) Google Scholar).Transfection and Cell Culture—HEK cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin in a humidified 5% CO2, 95% O2 incubator at 37 °C. Cells were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. To generate a cell line stably expressing Cav3.3, pcDNA3.1-Cav3.3-V5/His was linearized by SalI and transfected into HEK cells. Stable cell line was generated by antibiotic selection (1 mg/ml G418) 48 h post-transfection. Single cell colonies were selected 14 days post-transfection and amplified, and the expression of Cav3.3 was assessed.Co-immunoprecipitation—HEK cells in 10-cm dishes were transiently transfected with equal amounts of the expression constructs (totally 10 μg of DNA) using Lipofectamine 2000. When only a single construct was transfected, pcDNA3.1 vector alone was included to maintain the same final amount of DNA. Cells were lysed 48 h post-transfection with IP buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 250 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm DTT, and protease inhibitor mixture from Sigma). The cell lysates were then centrifuged to remove cell debris, and the antibody used for immunoprecipitation was added to the supernatant. After overnight incubation at 4 °C with gentle agitation, immune complexes were precipitated with protein A- or protein G-agarose beads (Invitrogen) followed by washes in 1 ml of IP buffer for three times. After the final wash, the pellet was resuspended in Laemmli sample buffer, and proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE (4-12% gel) and transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride membrane for immunoblot analysis.Whole Cell Patch Clamp—HEK cells stably expressing Cav3.3 were transfected with either pcDNA3.1 vector, CatSper1, or CatSper2 expressing constructs using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Cells were also co-transfected with a plasmid encoding a GFP reporter (in a 1:5 ratio) to allow identification of positively transfected cells for whole cell patch clamp measurements. 24-48 h post-transfection, whole cell currents were recorded at room temperature using the standard patch clamp technique with an Axopatch 200B amplifier (Axon Instruments, Union City, CA), controlled with a PC computer using pCLAMP6 software (Axon Instruments). Data were filtered at 5 kHz using the built-in filter of the amplifier. Borosilicate pipettes with a typical resistance of 2-3 megohms were filled with a solution containing the following: 110 mm CsCl, 10 mm EGTA, 10 mm HEPES, 2 mm MgATP, 0.6 mm GTP (pH adjusted to 7.2 with CsOH). Extracellular solution contained 5 mm CaCl2, 155 mm tetraethylammonium chloride, 10 mm HEPES (pH adjusted to 7.4 with tetraethylammonium-OH).Data Analysis—In electrophysiology measurements, peak currents were determined using Clampfit 8.0 software (Axon Instruments). The conductance-voltage relationship for activation was deduced by the chord conductance method, wherein conductance was obtained by normalizing peak current at each pulse against driving force, plotted as function of voltage, fit with a single Boltzmann function, and normalized against maximal value. Average data are presented as mean ± S.E., and statistical differences between data sets were assessed by Student's t tests, and significance was accepted at the p < 0.05 level.Biotinylation of Cell Surface Proteins for Expression Analysis—Cells were transfected with a fixed amount of DNA (10 μg) in 10-cm dishes using Lipofectamine 2000. 0.5 μg of a plasmid expressing an hemagglutinin-tagged protein was included in each transfection to allow normalization of transfection efficiencies among various samples. 48 h post-transfection, cells were harvested, washed with PBS, and then incubated in PBS containing 0.5 mg/ml sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin (Pierce) for 45 min at 4 °C to label cell surface proteins. The biotinylation reaction was quenched with 50 mm NH4Cl for 10 min. The cells were washed with PBS and incubated in lysis buffer (0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mm DTT, protease inhibitor mixture in PBS). The cell lysates were then centrifuged to remove cell debris, and proteins in the supernatant were quantitated. Equal amounts of protein lysates were aliquoted, one part for the measurement of total protein expression, and the rest were incubated with beads coated with streptavidin (Pierce) for affinity-capture and purification of biotinylated proteins. The proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE (4-12% gel) and transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride membrane for immunoblot analysis. The intensities of protein bands within a linear range of detection on the scanned blot were quantitated by ImageQuant image analysis software, and the expression levels of protein were normalized to that of the transfection control protein.Immunofluorescence—Cryo-preserved human sperm samples were thawed, diluted, spotted onto chamber slides, and air-dried. The sperm were fixed and permeabilized with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min. After rinsing twice in PBS, the slides were incubated in blocking buffer (2% fetal bovine serum, 2% bovine serum albumin in PBS) for 30 min to reduce nonspecific binding. The slides were then incubated with either rabbit anti-Cav3.3 antibody (Alomone Labs, 1:50 dilution) or rabbit anti-CatSper1 antibody (1:50 dilution) diluted in the blocking buffer for 2 h. To assess specific binding, 2 μg of competing peptide for anti-Cav3.3 antibody or 25 μg of purified CatSper1 C-terminal fragment for competing anti-CatSper1 antibody were preincubated with the primary antibodies in the blocking buffer for 30 min and then applied to the slides. After incubating with primary antibodies, the slides were washed once in PBS with 0.25% Nonidet P-40 and then twice in PBS. The slides were then incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA) diluted in blocking buffer (1:200 dilution) for 1 h. After washing one time in PBS with 0.25% Nonidet P-40 followed by two times in PBS, the slides were mounted in Vectashield mounting medium (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) for observation under a fluorescent microscope.FRET Analysis—Anti-Cav3.3, anti-CatSper1, and anti-PMCA4 antibodies were labeled with Alexa Fluor 488 dye or Alexa 555 dye by Zenon IgG labeling kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. These labeled antibodies were employed to immunostain sperm samples, as described for indirect immunofluorescence, but without using the secondary antibody. Before mounting, the stained sperm on the slide were fixed again with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min. Fluorescent images were acquired using an LSM 5 PASCAL laser scanning confocal imaging system (Carl Zeiss, Thornwood, NY). All images were taken with an oil immersion objective with appropriate filter sets (donor, excitation 488 nm, emission filter BP 505-530 nm; acceptor, excitation 543 nm, emission filter LP 560 nm; FRET, excitation 488 nm, emission filter LP 560 nm). The quantitative FRET analysis was performed using the PASCAL software (Zeiss) according to manufacturer's sensitized emission protocol, which is based on the conventional three-filter method described by Xia and Liu (14Xia Z. Liu Y. Biophys. J. 2001; 81: 2395-2402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). The FRET filter raw image contains the FRET signal, as well as the bleed through of direct donor and acceptor emissions into the FRET channel. To determine bleed through and background corrections, the three track images of sperms stained with donor only and acceptor only were separately obtained. The donor and acceptor images of the samples were then multiplied with the respective correction factor and subtracted from the raw FRET image, and a normalized FRET (NFRET) image was calculated by PASCAL software according to Xia and Liu (14Xia Z. Liu Y. Biophys. J. 2001; 81: 2395-2402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). NFRET values of at least 10 regions on the tails of 3-5 stained sperm were measured and expressed as means ± S.E.RESULTSIdentification of Cav3.3 as a CatSper1- and CatSper2-associated Protein from Human Sperm Extracts by GST Pulldown Approach—To identify sperm proteins that associate with CatSper1, we initially tried to immunoprecipitate CatSper1 along with its binding partners from the sperm extract using CatSper1 antibody. However, this approach failed because of the poor solubility of sperm CatSper1 protein under conditions that maintain protein-protein interactions. Because CatSper proteins have relatively large N- and C-terminal segments and short loops between the transmembrane domains, we hypothesized that CatSper might associate with other proteins through their N- and C-terminal segments. In particular, the C-terminal segments of both CatSper1 and CatSper2 contain coiled-coil domains that could mediate protein-protein interactions (10Lobley A. Pierron V. Reynolds L. Allen L. Michalovich D. Reprod. Biol. Endocrinol. 2003; 1: 53Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Therefore, we generated the N- and C-terminal segments of CatSper as GST fusion proteins and utilized them in pulldown experiments to identify proteins in sperm that may associate with them.GST fusion protein constructs were prepared and expressed in bacteria. The N terminus of CatSper1 as a GST fusion protein expressed poorly and was largely insoluble, whereas good expression of the C terminus of CatSper1 and the N and C termini of CatSper2 as GST fusion proteins (GST-Cat1-C, GST-Cat2-N, and GST-Cat2-C, respectively) were obtained. These GST fusion proteins were affinity-purified to apparent homogeneity and conjugated to glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads. To pull down CatSper-associated proteins, human sperm extract was incubated with beads conjugated with GST (negative control), GST-Cat1-C, or a mixture of GST-Cat2-N and GST-Cat2-C proteins, respectively. Aliquots of the pull-down products were resolved by SDS-PAGE and visualized by silver staining. GST fusion proteins used in pulldown appeared as major protein bands on the gel. Besides, less abundant protein bands appeared in all three lanes of Fig. 1. Some of these protein bands, with identical molecular weights across all lanes, were apparent nonspecific contaminants during purification. Nonetheless, distinct protein bands were observed specifically in GST-CatSper1 and -2 pulldown lanes but not in GST pull-down controls.We applied MudPIT, which incorporates on-line two-dimensional capillary chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry to determine the identities of proteins in the pull-down mixtures. As expected, several peptides derived from either GST or CatSper were identified because of the presence of the GST fusion proteins in the pulldown mixtures. To identify proteins specifically associated with CatSper, we subtracted, in silico, proteins identified in GST alone pulldown from those obtained from GST-CatSper1 and -2 pulldowns. This subtractive analysis identified a few proteins present/unique to the GST-Cat1-C or a mixture of GST-Cat2-N and GST-Cat2-C pulldown. Some identified proteins were nonspecific contaminants from semen, including apolipoprotein and semenogelin. One peptide (RTFRLLRVLKLVRFMPALRR) derived from the T-type calcium channel Cav3.3 was consistently identified (from two separate experiments) in both in-gel and in-solution digestion of GST-CatSper1 and GST-CatSper2 pulldown complexes but not from pulldown product by GST alone. These findings suggested that Cav3.3 might be a likely associated protein for both CatSper1 and CatSper2.Co-immunoprecipitation of CatSper1 and CatSper2 with Cav3.3 in Mammalian Cells—In order to confirm the association of Cav3.3 with the CatSper1 and -2 observed in GST pull-down, co-immunoprecipitation experiments were conducted to investigate their interactions in mammalian cells. CatSper1 with a FLAG tag was transiently transfected into HEK cells either alone (negative control) or along with a construct expressing Cav3.3 with a V5 tag. Forty eight hours post-transfection, the expression of transfected Cav3.3 and CatSper1 could be detected by Western blot analysis of products immunoprecipitated with the corresponding antibodies (Fig. 2A). When Cav3.3 antibody was used in the immunoprecipitation, we observed that CatSper1 co-immunoprecipitated with Cav3.3 in the case when both were co-transfected but not when CatSper1 alone was transfected (Fig. 2A). To determine the specificity of interactions between Cav3.3 and CatSper1, we examined whether other unrelated proteins, such as Na+/K+-ATPase and 14-3-3ϵ, could also co-immunoprecipitate with Cav3.3. Although these two proteins were abundantly expressed, they were not present in the products immunoprecipitated by the Cav3.3 antibody (Fig. 2A). Similar co-immunoprecipitation studies revealed that CatSper2 also associates with Cav3.3 in mammalian cells (Fig. 2B). In reciprocal experiments, when antibodies recognizing the cloned CatSper proteins were used in immunoprecipitation, we observed that Cav3.3 could be co-immunoprecipitated along with either CatSper1 or CatSper2 (Fig. 2C).FIGURE 2CatSper proteins co-immunoprecipitate with Cav3.3 in transfected HEK cells. A, CatSper1-FLAG construct was transiently transfected in HEK cells either alone (negative control) or along with a construct expressing Cav3.3-V5. Western blot (WB) of products immunoprecipitated (IP) by the anti-Cav3.3 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) recognized Cav3.3 in transfected cells. Western blot using anti-CatSper1 antibody revealed comparable CatSper1 expression in both transfections by analyzing the proteins immunoprecipitated by the anti-FLAG antibody. CatSper1 was detected in the proteins immunoprecipitated by anti-Cav3.3 antibody only when Cav3.3 and CatSper1 co-expressed in the cells. Western blot analysis using anti-Na+/K+-ATPase antibody or anti-14-3-3ϵ antibody revealed abundant expression of these two proteins in the cell lysates; however, these were not detected in the products immunoprecipitated by Cav3.3. B, similar co-immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrating the association of CatSper2 with Cav3.3 in HEK cells. C, in reciprocal experiments, Cav3.3 were co-immunoprecipitated along with either CatSper1 or CatSper2, utilizing anti-FLAG or anti-CatSper2 antibody, respectively, in immunoprecipitation experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)CatSper1 and CatSper2 Reduce Cav3.3-mediated Ca2+ Currents in Transfected Mammalian Cells and Xenopus Oocytes—Th"

https://openalex.org/W2068025201,"Properties of smooth and cardiac L-type Ca2+ channels differ prominently in several physiological aspects, including sympathetic modulation. To assess the possible underlying mechanisms, we applied the whole cell patch-clamp technique to guinea pig detrusor smooth muscle cells, in which only L-type Ca2+ channel currents are observed in practice. During depolarization to large positive potentials, the conformation of the majority of L-type Ca2+ channels is converted from the normal (O1) to a second open state (O2), which undergoes little inactivation during depolarization. Extracellular application of genistein, a known tyrosine kinase inhibitor, significantly attenuated the voltage-dependent conversion of Ca2+ channels to O2, accompanied by reduction of availability, whereas genistin, an inactive analog, had little effect. In the absence of ATP in the patch pipette, intracellular application of either genistein or tyrphostin-47 suppressed the conversion to O2. Computer calculation revealed that the acceleration of the O1 to an inactivated state qualitatively reconstructs the unique effects of PTK inhibitors antagonized by ATP. We concluded that under normal conditions smooth muscle L-type Ca2+ channels are already modulated by tyrosine-kinase and ATP-related mechanism(s) and thereby easily achieve the second conversion, which yields voltage-dependent modulation of L-type Ca2+ current analogous to that in cardiac myocytes during beta-adrenoceptor stimulation."
