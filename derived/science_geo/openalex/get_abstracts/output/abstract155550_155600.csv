To investigate perilipin function, perilipin A, the predominant isoform, was ectopically expressed in fibroblastic 3T3-L1 pre-adipocytes that normally lack the perilipins. In control cells, fluorescent staining of neutral lipids with Bodipy 493/503 showed a few minute and widely dispersed lipid droplets, while in cells stably expressing perilipin A, the lipid droplets were more numerous and tightly clustered in one or two regions of the cytoplasm. Immunofluorescence microscopy revealed that the ectopic perilipin A localized to the surfaces of the tiny clustered lipid droplets; subcellular fractionation of the cells using sucrose gradients confirmed that the perilipin A localized exclusively to lipid droplets. Cells expressing perilipin A stored 6–30-fold more triacylglycerol than control cells due to reduced lipolysis of triacylglycerol stores. The lipolysis of stored triacylglycerol was 5 times slower in lipid-loaded cells expressing perilipin A than in lipid-loaded control cells, when triacylglycerol synthesis was blocked with 6 μm triacsin C. This stabilization of triacylglycerol was not due to the suppression of triacylglycerol lipase activity by the expression of perilipin A. We conclude that perilipin A increases the triacylglycerol content of cells by forming a barrier that reduces the access of soluble lipases to stored lipids, thus inhibiting triacylglycerol hydrolysis. These studies suggest that perilipin A plays a major role in the regulation of triacylglycerol storage and lipolysis in adipocytes.

These structures contain a large core of neutral lipid, primarily triacylglycerol, covered by a phospholipid monolayer. The intracellular mechanisms that control the storage and release of triacylglycerols are largely uncharacterized, yet are likely to be fundamental to understanding the regulation of energy metabolism in the body. Recent studies have shown that lipid droplets are covered with a proteinaceous coat; the functions and identities of the component proteins have not been fully elucidated. The first identified lipid droplet-specific proteins are the perilipins (1Greenberg A.S. Egan J.J. Wek S.A. Garty N.B. Blanchette-Mackie E.J. Londos C. J. Biol.

The perilipins are encoded by a single copy gene that gives rise to multiple mRNAs by alternative splicing mechanisms 1X. Lu, J. Gruia-Gray, C. Londos, and A. Kimmel, manuscript in preparation. 1X. Lu, J. Gruia-Gray, C. Londos, and A. Kimmel, manuscript in preparation.; these mRNAs are translated to yield the three described protein isoforms (2Greenberg A.S. Egan J.J. Wek S.A. Moos M.C.

Perilipin A is the predominant isoform in both adipocytes and steroidogenic cells, perilipin B is found primarily in adipocytes, and perilipin C is unique to steroidogenic cells. Perilipin A is the most abundant protein on highly purified lipid droplets isolated from fully differentiated cultured 3T3-L1 adipocytes and from murine primary adipocytes, 2N. E. Wolins and C. Londos, unpublished data. 2N. E. Wolins and C. Londos, unpublished data. as assessed by Coomassie staining and silver staining of lipid-droplet proteins separated on denaturing gels. Based on the localization of perilipins at the surfaces of lipid droplets, we hypothesized that the perilipins may function in regulating the packaging and storage of neutral lipids. The mechanisms of lipid droplet formation are poorly understood. Early studies showed that all cells in culture take up free fatty acids and lipoproteins provided by serum in the culture medium, and use the lipids as a source of energy and building components for membrane synthesis (8Spector A.A. Mathur S.N. Kaduce T.L. Hyman B.T. Prog. Lipid Res. 1981; 19: 155-186Crossref Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Many cells have been observed to accumulate tiny cytoplasmic inclusions of triacylglycerols or cholesterol esters during exposure to lipid-rich medium (8Spector A.A. Mathur S.N. Kaduce T.L. Hyman B.T. Prog. Lipid Res. 1981; 19: 155-186Crossref Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 9De La Llera M. Rothblat G. Howard B.V. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1979; 574: 414-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), while cultured adipocytes form relatively huge droplets (3Blanchette-Mackie E.J. Dwyer N.K. Barber T. Coxey R.A. Takeda T. Rondinone C.M. Theodorakis J.L. Greenberg A.S. Londos C. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 1211-1226Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that occupy the majority of the cell volume. Additionally, analysis of histological sections reveal enormous lipid droplets in adipocytes and smaller lipid droplets in various non-adipose tissues including liver, heart, adrenal gland, testes, ovary, muscle, intestine, kidney, and mammary gland (10Hammersen F.

Enzyme activities for neutral lipid synthesis have been isolated in microsomes from fractionated cells, thus implying localization to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER).3 Both diacylglycerol acyltransferase, which catalyzes the final step in triacylglycerol synthesis, and acyl coenzyme A-cholesterol acyltransferase, which adds fatty acids to cholesterol, have been localized to ER by subcellular fractionation (13Coleman R.

The mechanisms leading to the nucleation of lipid droplet formation are currently uncharacterized; a hypothetical model includes the formation of a lens of neutral lipids between the lumenal and cytoplasmic leaflets of the membrane bilayer of the ER that either is retained as a bleb associated with the ER (17Scow R.O. Blanchette-Mackie E.J. Smith L.C. Fed. Proc. 1980; 39: 2610-2617PubMed Google Scholar), or pinches off and takes a cytoplasmic location. Assuming that lipid droplets are formed within the ER membrane, proteins unique to lipid droplets may originate as integral ER proteins that selectively target to the patches of the ER that contain the growing accumulation of neutral lipids, or alternatively, may be translated on free ribosomes and then inserted into the lipid droplet following its dissociation from the ER. Several sterol and phospholipid biosynthetic enzymes and fatty acyl-coenzyme A ligases in yeast are found on both the ER and isolated lipid droplets (18Leber R. Zinser E. Zellnig G. Paltauf F. Daum G. Yeast. 1994; 10: 1421-1428Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 19Athenstaedt K. Daum G. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 7611-7616Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 20Leber R.

Kohlwein S.D. Daum G. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 6441-6448Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and hence may be examples of lipid droplet-associated proteins that are synthesized on the ER; similarly, phosphatidylethanolamineN-methyltransferase has been localized to lipid droplets isolated from rat hepatocytes (22Lehner R. Cui Z. Vance D.E. Biochem. J. 1999; 338: 761-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), as well as to an ER-like compartment termed the mitochondria-associated membrane fraction (23Cui Z. Vance J.E. Chen M.H. Voelker D.R. Vance D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16655-16663Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), that is enriched in numerous lipid biosynthetic enzymes (24Rusinol A.E. Cui Z. Chen M.H. Vance J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27494-27502Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). By contrast, the perilipins are translated on free, and not ER-bound, ribosomes, 4N. E. Wolins, C. J. Schultz, and C. Londos, unpublished data. 4N. E. Wolins, C. J. Schultz, and C. Londos, unpublished data. and thus, traffic to and associate with lipid droplets post-translationally. Although the perilipins appear to be associated only with lipid droplets, their functions are uncharacterized. To study the function of perilipins in lipid metabolism, perilipin A was ectopically and stably expressed in fibroblastic 3T3-L1 pre-adipocytes that lack endogenous perilipins prior to differentiation. The ectopic perilipin A was found exclusively on tiny lipid droplets in these cells, which stored significantly more triacylglycerol than control cells lacking perilipins. The metabolic basis for the increased storage of triacylglycerol was investigated. Fetal bovine serum, fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin, triolein, oleic acid, diethyl-p-nitrophenyl phosphate, andp-chloromercuribenzoate were purchased from Sigma. Geneticin was purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. or Mediatech, Inc. (Herndon, VA). [9,10-3H]Oleic acid and [9,10-3H]triolein were purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Triacsin C (Biomol, Plymouth Meeting, PA) was generously donated by Dr. Peter Gillies and Dr. Sandie Germain at DuPont (Wilmington, DE). Diethylumbelliferyl phosphate was synthesized by Chem-Master International, Inc. (East Setauket, NY). Ammonium sulfate-impregnated silica gel H thin layer chromatography plates were purchased from Analtech (Newark, DE). An anti-calnexin polyclonal antibody was purchased from StressGen Biotechnologies Corp. (Victoria, British Columbia, Canada). Bodipy 493/503 and Alexa Fluor 546 goat anti-rabbit polyclonal IgGs were obtained from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR). 3T3-L1 pre-adipocytes were cultured in Corning 100-mm dishes in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and the cells were grown in a 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C. The cDNA for mouse perilipin A was amplified by the polymerase chain reaction using oligonucleotide primers corresponding to the 5′ and 3′ ends of the perilipin A coding sequence with added HindIII sites, and was subcloned into the HindIII site of the pSRαMSVtkneo retroviral expression vector (25Muller A.J.

The retroviral construct was purified using an endotoxin-free plasmid preparation kit (Qiagen, Santa Clarita, CA) and was co-transfected by the calcium phosphate method (26Graham F.L. Van Der Eb A.J.

Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8392-8396Crossref PubMed Scopus (2275) Google Scholar) for assembly of the retrovirus. Medium containing the retrovirus was collected from the cultures of 293T cells, filtered, and transferred to subconfluent 3T3-L1 pre-adipocytes. Cells containing the retrovirus were selected for by the addition of 0.6 mg/ml active geneticin to the culture media; typically, more than 95% of cells survive the selection conditions. Cells for control conditions stably incorporated the retroviral vector lacking the perilipin cDNA. Control 3T3-L1 pre-adipocytes and cells expressing perilipin A were grown on 12-mm glass coverslips in 100-mm culture dishes. Cells were prepared for immunofluorescence microscopy (3Blanchette-Mackie E.J. Dwyer N.K. Barber T. Coxey R.A. Takeda T. Rondinone C.M. Theodorakis J.L. Greenberg A.S. Londos C. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 1211-1226Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and stained with antiserum raised against a recombinant 6-histidine-tagged amino-terminal peptide of perilipin A (29Brasaemle D.L. Barber T. Wolins N.E. Serrero G. Blanchette-Mackie E.J. Londos C. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 2249-2263Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and an Alexa Fluor 546 secondary antibody. Neutral lipids were stained with Bodipy 493/503 (30Gocze P.M. Freeman D.A. Cytometry. 1994; 17: 151-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Cells were viewed with a Nikon Eclipse E800 fluorescence microscope equipped with a Hamamatsu Orca digital camera interfaced with a Power Macintosh G4 computer; images were processed using Improvision Openlab software. Confluent monolayers of 3T3-L1 pre-adipocytes stably expressing perilipin A were incubated with 400 μm oleic acid complexed to fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin (6:1, moles of oleate:moles of albumin) in culture medium for 16 h to increase the storage of triacylglycerols. Cells were harvested and lysed in a hypotonic medium containing 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm sodium fluoride, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm benzamidine, and 100 μm[4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonylfluoride] hydrochloride for 10 min at 4 °C, followed by 10 strokes in a Teflon/glass homogenizer. The homogenate was centrifuged for 10 min at 1000 × g at 4 °C, and the supernatant was adjusted to 35% sucrose, and layered over a 0.5-ml cushion of 50% sucrose. A linear 0–30% sucrose gradient was then layered over the density-adjusted supernatant, and the tubes were centrifuged for 4 h at 154,000 × gat 4 °C. The floating lipid droplet layer was harvested in approximately 1 ml by slicing off the top of the tube using a Beckman tube slicer; 11 additional fractions were collected. Equal portions of each fraction were solvent-extracted for lipid analysis, as described previously (7Brasaemle D.L. Barber T. Kimmel A.R. Londos C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9378-9387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar); the proteins in an additional portion of each fraction were separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred electrophoretically to nitrocellulose membranes and immunoblotted with antibodies against perilipin A and calnexin, an ER integral membrane protein; enhanced chemiluminescence was used to detect bound antibodies. Two separate fractionations of cells were compared and found to be nearly identical. Cellular lipid content was determined following solvent extraction of cells, as described previously (7Brasaemle D.L. Barber T. Kimmel A.R. Londos C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9378-9387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Lipid content was expressed relative to total cellular protein content measured by the bicinchoninic acid method (Pierce; Ref. 31Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H.

Confluent monolayers of 3T3-L1 pre-adipocytes stably expressing perilipin A and control cells were incubated with 400 μm oleic acid complexed to bovine serum albumin for 16 h to increase the storage of triacylglycerols. The medium was then removed and 6 μm triacsin C (from a 1 mg/ml stock in Me2SO) was added in fresh culture medium without supplemental fatty acids. Cells were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline and harvested by scraping at various times; lipids were extracted and quantified (7Brasaemle D.L. Barber T. Kimmel A.R. Londos C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9378-9387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), and the mass of triacylglycerol was expressed relative to cell protein (31Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fujimoto E.K. Goeke N.M. Olson B.J. Klenk D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (18349) Google Scholar). Confluent monolayers of 3T3-L1 pre-adipocytes were used for these experiments since cell division is inhibited by contact inhibition in these cells, and the cell number remained constant throughout the chase incubation. Triacsin C, an acyl-coenzyme A synthetase inhibitor, was added to the chase medium to inhibit the re-utilization of fatty acids released from hydrolyzed triacylglycerols (32Tomoda H. Igarashi K. Omura S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 921: 595-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 33Tomoda H. Igarashi K. Cyong J.C. Omura S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4214-4219Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To test for the effectiveness of triacsin C in the inhibition of triacylglycerol synthesis, 3T3-L1 cells stably expressing perilipin A and control cells were incubated with 400 μm oleate complexed to albumin for 16 h in the presence or absence of 6 μm triacsin C; lipids were solvent-extracted and quantified (7Brasaemle D.L. Barber T. Kimmel A.R. Londos C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9378-9387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Twelve 100-mm dishes of confluent 3T3-L1 pre-adipocytes stably expressing perilipin A or control cells were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline, harvested by scraping, and pooled. Cells were centrifuged at 500 × g to yield pellets of approximately 250 μl, and were lysed in 750 μl of cold 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA by incubation on ice for 10 min, followed by homogenization in a cold Teflon/glass homogenizer. Homogenates were centrifuged at 15,000 ×g for 15 min at 4 °C. Triplicate supernatant fractions of 200 μl, each corresponding to approximately 2.8 mg of total cell protein, were assayed for the ability to hydrolyze emulsified [3H]triolein by the methods of Khoo and Steinberg (34Khoo J.C. Steinberg D. Methods Enzymol. 1975; 35: 181-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Released [3H]oleic acid was partitioned into solvent (35Belfrage P. Vaughan M. J. Lipid Res. 1969; 10: 341-344Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and quantified by liquid scintillation counting.

Inhibitor stocks were made up as follows. E600 was dissolved in water (2.5 mg/ml), PCMB was dissolved in 0.1 msodium hydroxide to make a 1000-fold stock, and DEUP was solubilized in Me2SO (50 mg/ml). Confluent monolayers of 3T3-L1 pre-adipocytes were incubated with 400 μm oleate complexed to albumin for 16 h to increase the storage of triacylglycerols. The lipid-loading medium was removed, and fresh culture medium without supplemental fatty acids but containing 6 μm triacsin C and the lipolysis inhibitors was added. Cells were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline and harvested by scraping; lipids were extracted and the mass of triacylglycerol was quantified (7Brasaemle D.L. Barber T. Kimmel A.R. Londos C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9378-9387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The ability of cells to synthesize triacylglycerols from [3H]oleate was measured in confluent monolayers of 3T3-L1 cells stably expressing perilipin A and control cells; both types of cells were incubated with 0.6 mm DEUP to inhibit triacylglycerol hydrolysis. The cells were incubated with 400 μm [3H]oleate (1 μCi/60-mm culture dish) complexed to fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin, harvested at various times, and the cellular lipids extracted and analyzed by thin-layer chromatography (7Brasaemle D.L.

Incorporation of radioactivity into triacylglycerols was determined by liquid scintillation counting (Beckman LS 6800) of silica gel bands containing triacylglycerols. [3H]Oleate incorporated into triacylglycerols was expressed relative to cellular protein content (31Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fujimoto E.K.

A paired Student's t test was used to assess differences in triacylglycerol synthesis between samples from cells expressing perilipin A relative to samples from control cells. To facilitate study of the functions of perilipins in lipid metabolism, perilipin A was ectopically and stably expressed in fibroblastic 3T3-L1 pre-adipocytes using an efficient retroviral expression system (25Muller A.J.

Freeman D.A. Cytometry. 1994; 17: 151-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar) revealed that control cells have a few minute lipid droplets dispersed throughout the cytoplasm (Fig. 1 A). When oleic acid was added to the culture medium to provide substrate for triacylglycerol synthesis, more numerous lipid droplets were observed dispersed throughout the cytoplasm, but excluded from a perinuclear region of the control cells (Fig. 1 B). Expressed perilipin A targets to and associates with lipid droplets; immunostaining for perilipins revealed tightly aggregated clusters of tiny spherical structures in one or two areas of the cytoplasm (Fig. 1 C); the cores of these spherical structures were stained with Bodipy 493/503, thus identifying the structures as lipid droplets. Perilipin staining was either coincident with the neutral lipid staining or appeared as distinct rings around the perimeters of minute lipid droplets (Fig. 1 C), due, at least in part, to the imaging of the clustered lipid droplets at various focal planes. When oleic acid was added to the culture medium, the number and sizes of lipid droplets in the clusters increased, and a distinct staining pattern of rings of perilipin surrounding cores of neutral lipid became apparent (Fig. 1 D). No staining for perilipins was observed in control 3T3-L1 pre-adipocytes when the cells lacked an expression construct (see Fig. 8I in Ref. 29Brasaemle D.L. Barber T. Wolins N.E. Serrero G.

Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 2249-2263Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), or were infected with a retroviral vector lacking the cDNA for the coding sequence of perilipin A (Fig. 1, A and B). Comparable results were obtained in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) fibroblasts stably expressing perilipin A and control cells (data not shown); the expression of perilipin A altered the distribution of lipid droplets to one or two tight clusters of numerous lipid droplets covered with perilipin A, compared with a dispersed arrangement of a few minute lipid droplets in control CHO cells lacking perilipin A. To confirm the localization of ectopic perilipin A on lipid droplets, homogenates of 3T3-L1 pre-adipocytes stably expressing perilipin A were fractionated on sucrose gradients. The isolation of lipid droplets in the most buoyant fraction was confirmed by the detection of greater than 99% of the total cellular triacylglycerol in the uppermost fraction of the sucrose gradients (Fig. 2). Immunoblotting of the proteins in the gradient fractions revealed that perilipin A was quantitatively collected in the buoyant lipid droplet fraction (Fig. 2). Massive overexposure of the immunoblots failed to reveal perilipin A in any other subcellular fractions (data not shown). The nitrocellulose membranes were also probed for calnexin, an integral ER protein. Most of the calnexin was found in fractions of intermediate density that also contained the highest levels of cholesterol, another marker for cellular membranes (Fig. 2); however, approximately 3% of the total calnexin was found in the floating lipid droplet fraction, thus indicating potential contamination of this fraction with a small amount of ER. Since cells expressing perilipin A showed more staining with Bodipy 493/503 than control cells, the neutral lipid content was quantified in control and perilipin A-expressing 3T3-L1 pre-adipocytes. Cells expressing perilipin A showed a higher triacylglycerol content than control cells, while showing no detectable differences in the extremely low levels of stored cholesterol esters (Table I). The triacylglycerol content of both control and perilipin A-expressing cells varied depending upon when the samples were harveste"

Caspases reside in cells as inactive zymogens, known as procaspases, and can be activated by proteolytic cleavage after specific aspartate residues present between what will become the large and small subunits of the active caspase (4Salvesen G.S.

During apoptosis, the initiator caspase zymogens are activated by autocatalytic cleavage, which then activate the effector caspases by cleaving their inactive zymogens (6Salvesen G.S. Dixit V.M.

The initiator caspase zymogens are activated by adaptor proteins such as FADD and Apaf-1, which associate in a stimulus-dependent manner with the prodomains of these zymogens and promote their activation via oligomerization (6Salvesen G.S.

For example, ligation of the cell surface death receptors triggers binding of procaspase-8 to FADD and its subsequent activation and release from the death receptor complex (reviewed in Refs. 6Salvesen G.S.

Likewise, release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria in response to apoptotic stimuli such as serum starvation, ionization radiation, DNA damaging agents, etc. triggers oligomerization of Apaf-1 in an ATP- or dATP-dependent manner (7Srinivasula S.M.

Given the potentially irreversible caspase cascade triggered by activation of the upstream initiator caspases, it is crucial that activation of caspases in the cell be tightly regulated. A number of cellular proteins have been shown to modulate caspase activation and activity. One of these, FLAME/FLIP, inhibits death receptor-mediated activation of caspase-8 by binding to FADD (12Irmler M. Thome M. Hahne M. Schneider P. Hofmann K. Steiner V. Bodmer J.L. Schroter M.

Others, such as the antiapoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family, inhibit Apaf-1-mediated activation of caspase-9 by blocking cytochromec release from the mitochondria (reviewed in Refs. 14Adams J.M.

Heat shock proteins Hsp70 and Hsp90 also interfere with the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway by modulating the formation of a functional Apaf-1 apoptosome (16Saleh A. Srinivasula S.M. Balkir L.

Finally, members of the IAP1 family, such as XIAP, c-IAP-1, and c-IAP-2, block both the death receptor and mitochondrial pathways by inhibiting the activity of the effector caspase-3 and -7 and the initiator caspase-9 (reviewed in Ref. 19Deveraux Q.L. Reed J.C. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 239-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (2282) Google Scholar). Recently, Smac/DIABLO, a mitochondrial protein that is released together with cytochrome c from the mitochondria in response to apoptotic stimuli, was found to promote caspase activation by binding and neutralizing the IAPs (20Du C. Fang M. Li Y. Li L. Wang X. Cell. 2000; 102: 33-42Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2925) Google Scholar, 21Verhagen A.M. Ekert P.G. Pakusch M. Silke J. Connolly L.M. Reid G.E.

In this report, we investigated in detail the caspase-promoting activity of Smac/DIABLO and its interaction with XIAP. We demonstrate that Smac/DIABLO promotes the caspase activity of the initiator caspase-9 and the effector caspase-3 and -7, by neutralizing the inhibitory effect of IAPs. Like the Drosophila Reaper, Grim, and Hid proteins (19Deveraux Q.L. Reed J.C. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 239-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (2282) Google Scholar, 22Wang S.L. Hawkins C.J. Yoo S.J. Muller H.A.

Moreover, Smac/DIABLO can potentiate death receptor-induced apoptosis in the presence of Bcl-xL, suggesting that it could play an important role in this pathway. The entire open reading frames of human Smac/DIABLO-L and Smac/DIABLO-S cDNAs were cloned from Jurkat mRNA by RT-PCR using complementary PCR adaptor primers spanning the initiation and stop codons of these cDNAs. The PCR primers were designed based on the sequence of mouse DIABLO 2D. Vaux, personal communication. and human GenBank™ clones AW16150 and AK001399. All deletion mutants were also generated by PCR using modified complementary PCR adaptor primers. All Smac/DIABLO constructs were cloned in pET 28(a) in theNcoI/XhoI site with C-terminal His6tag or GST tag. All XIAP constructs were cloned in theEcoRI/XhoI site of pGEX-4T or MYC-pcDNA3. The MYC-pcDNA3 constructs were used forin vitro translations. All in vitrointeractions were performed by incubating 10 μl of TNT® (Promega) translation reaction at 4 °C for 2 h with equal amounts of proteins (200 ng) bound to 50 μl of glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) or TALON™-agarose (CLONTECH) beads in a 100-μl reaction. The beads in all the samples were washed at least 4 times and then boiled in 30 μl of sample buffer. 15 μl of each sample was loaded onto a 10% SDS polyacrylamide gel and separated by electrophoresis. The gels were dried and then exposed to x-ray films. His6- or GST-tagged Smac/DIABLO or XIAP were purified using TALON™ resin or glutathione-Sepharose by standard affinity-purification procedures as described previously (7Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Alnemri E.S. Mol Cell. 1998; 1: 949-957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (969) Google Scholar). Cytochrome c-dependent activation of caspase-9 and caspase-3 was done in 293T S100 extracts as described previously (7Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Alnemri E.S.

Caspase-3 and -7 enzymatic assays were performed in a 20-μl volume in buffer A (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mmEDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol) at 37 °C. Pure GST-XIAP was incubated with 5 nm of pure caspase-3 (at 20 nm concentration) or caspase-7 (at 5 nm concentration) with various amounts of Smac/DIABLO and 50 μm Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-7-Amino-Y-methyl coumarin (DEVD-AMC) substrate for 30 min. The release of AMC from the DEVD-AMC substrate was measured using a PerkinElmer Life Sciences luminescence spectrometer. The results were expressed as percent of DEVD cleavage from at least three experiments. MCF-7 cells (0.5 × 105cells/well) in 12-well plates were transfected with 0.5 μg of pEGFP-N1 reporter plasmid (CLONTECH) or GFP-Smac/DIABLO expression construct together with 0.5 μg of empty vector plasmids or plasmids encoding Bcl-xL using the LipofectAMINE™ method. 24 h after transfection cells were treated with TRAIL (0.5 or 2 μg/ml) for 10 h and then the normal (flat and attached) and apoptotic (round and detached) GFP-expressing cells were counted using fluorescence microscopy. The percentage of apoptotic cells in each experiment was expressed as the mean percentage of apoptotic cells as a fraction of the total number of GFP-expressing cells. The Smac/DIABLO precursor contains a 55-residue mitochondrial targeting sequence (MTS) at its N terminus that is cleaved in the mitochondria to generate the mature mitochondrial Smac/DIABLO. Genomic analysis of the Smac/DIABLO gene on chromosome 12q (GenBank™ accession numberAC048338) revealed that the MTS is encoded by the first two exons. We found that the exons encoding the MTS are spliced out in two human expressed sequence tag clones (AA156765 and AA305624) and one full-length clone (AK001399) in the data base. The three clones contain an open reading frame that generates Smac/DIABLO-S lacking the MTS (Fig. 1 a). The alternatively spliced Smac/DIABLO-S mRNA is expressed in all cell lines tested by RT-PCR using isoform-specific primers (Fig.1 b), although at a lower level than that of Smac/DIABLO-L. Transient transfection of constructs encoding GFP fusion proteins of the two isoforms into MCF-7 cells revealed that Smac/DIABLO-S is targeted to the cytosol, whereas Smac/DIABLO-L is targeted to the mitochondria (Fig. 1 c).Figure 1Expression and subcellular localization of the short isoform of Smac/DIABLO. a, a schematic representation of the N termini of the Smac/DIABLO precursor (Smac/DIABLO-L) and the alternatively spliced short isoform of Smac/DIABLO (Smac/DIABLO-S). Smac/DIABLO-S begins with the MKSDFYF sequence, which replaces the MTS and residues 55–60 (AVPIA) of the Smac/DIABLO-L. Smac/DIABLO-L and Smac/DIABLO-S are 100% identical after residue 60.

To compare the activity of the two isoforms, we expressed Smac/DIABLO-S and Smac/DIABLO-L without its MTS (mature Smac/DIABLO) in bacteria, purified them, and examined their ability to enhance cytochromec-dependent activation of caspase-9 and -3 in XIAP-containing S100 extracts. Mature Smac/DIABLO was able to relieve the inhibitory effect of XIAP and enhance caspase-9 and -3 processing in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2 a). Interestingly, Smac/DIABLO-S was almost completely inactive in this assay (Fig. 2 a). Because the only difference between the two proteins is the substitution of the N-terminal AVPIA sequence in mature Smac/DIABLO with MKSDFYF in Smac/DIABLO-S, this indicated that the first 5 N-terminal residues of mature Smac/DIABLO are critical for its activity (see below). XIAP has been shown to inhibit the enzymatic activity of the effector caspases, caspase-3 and -7 (24Deveraux Q.L. Takahashi R. Salvesen G.S. Reed J.C. Nature. 1997; 388: 300-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (1719) Google Scholar). To examine whether Smac/DIABLO could also relieve the XIAP-inhibitory effect on the enzymatic activity of mature caspase-3 and -7, we tested the effect of Smac/DIABLO and Smac/DIABLO-S on the activity of caspase-3 and -7 in the presence of XIAP. Smac/DIABLO was able to promote the enzymatic activity of both caspase-3 and -7 (Fig. 2 b). Interestingly, compared with its very low activity with caspase-9, Smac/DIABLO-S had ∼30% of the activity of wild type Smac/DIABLO with caspase-3 and -7, suggesting that Smac/DIABLO-S may play a role in regulating caspase-3 and -7 activity in vivo. Combined, these data suggest that Smac/DIABLO has a dual role in the caspase cascade, to promote the activities of the initiator caspase-9 and the effector caspases. The ability of Smac/DIABLO to promote the enzymatic activity of caspases depends on its interaction with IAPs (20Du C. Fang M. Li Y. Li L. Wang X. Cell. 2000; 102: 33-42Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2925) Google Scholar, 21Verhagen A.M. Ekert P.G. Pakusch M. Silke J. Connolly L.M. Reid G.E. Moritz R.L. Simpson R.J. Vaux D.L. Cell. 2000; 102: 43-53Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1972) Google Scholar). To determine whether the weak activity of Smac/DIABLO-S is due to altered interaction with XIAP, we performed in vitro interaction assays with 35S-labeled full-length XIAP or isolated BIR domains of XIAP (Fig. 2 c). Consistent with its weak activity, Smac/DIABLO-S was not able to interact with the BIR3 domain (XIAP-BIR3/RING) of XIAP but was still able to interact with the BIR1/BIR2 domains (XIAP-BIR1/2) of XIAP. Because Smac/DIABLO-S can interact with the isolated BIR1/BIR2 domains (XIAP-BIR1/2) of XIAP, it was not surprising that it was also able to interact with full-length XIAP, although to a lesser extent than the wild type Smac/DIABLO. The low activity of Smac/DIABLO-S compared with that of mature Smac/DIABLO suggests that the N terminus of mature Smac/DIABLO is very important for its activity. To understand the molecular basis for this difference we generated a series of Smac/DIABLO N-terminal deletion mutants (Fig. 3 a) and expressed them in bacteria. The recombinant proteins were purified to homogeneity and assayed for their ability to promote cytochromec-dependent caspase-3 activation in XIAP-containing S100 extracts (Fig. 3 b, upper panel). Interestingly, deletion of only the first 4 residues of mature Smac/DIABLO (Δ4) dramatically reduced Smac/DIABLO activity to a level similar to that seen with Smac/DIABLO-S. Deletion of the first 21 residues (Δ21) further reduced Smac/DIABLO activity to undetectable levels. Other larger N-terminal deletions produced insoluble mutant proteins, which could not be used in this assay. However, one N-terminal deletion mutant lacking the first 139 residues (Δ139) was soluble but found to be completely inactive. The N-terminal deletion mutants were then assayed for their ability to enhance caspase-3 and -7 activity in the presence of XIAP (Fig.3 c). Like Smac/DIABLO-S, the N-terminal deletion mutants Δ4 and Δ21 had ∼30–40% of the activity of wild type Smac/DIABLO with caspase-3 and -7. However, the N-terminal deletion mutant Δ139 was also completely inactive in this assay. The results with the N-terminal deletion mutants suggest that the N terminus harbors the caspase-promoting activity of Smac/DIABLO. To test this hypothesis, we generated three C-terminal deletion mutants fused at their C termini to GST. These mutants, which contain the first 7, 30, or 39 N-terminal residues of mature Smac/DIABLO (N7, N30, and N39, respectively) (Fig. 3 a), were expressed in bacteria and purified to homogeneity. As shown in Fig. 3 b, lower panel, N30 and N39 were able to promote caspase-3 activation in S100 extracts containing XIAP, although at a higher concentration than the wild type Smac/DIABLO. The smallest mutant, N7, was the least effective among the mutants. N30 and N39 were also able to relieve the XIAP inhibition of caspase-7 and caspase-3 (Fig. 3 c), although they were slightly more effective with caspase-7 than caspase-3. However, within the range of concentrations used in this experiment N7 had no detectable activity with caspase-3 and -7. Taken together, these results suggest that the caspase-promoting activity of Smac/DIABLO resides within an approximately 30-residue-long domain at its N terminus. Like Smac/DIABLO-S, the N-terminal deletion mutants Δ4 and Δ21 were not able to interact with the BIR3 domain (XIAP-BIR3/RING) of XIAP but were still able to interact with the BIR1/BIR2 domains (XIAP-BIR1/2) of XIAP and to a slightly lesser extent with full-length XIAP (Fig.3 d, left panel). Based on these observations, we suggest that the first 4 residues of mature Smac/DIABLO are essential for its ability to interact with the BIR3 domain of XIAP. Because the BIR3 domain of XIAP is the domain that binds and inhibits caspase-9 (25Deveraux Q.L. Leo E. Stennicke H.R. Welsh K. Salvesen G.S. Reed J.C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5242-5251Crossref PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar), this could explain the very weak activity of Smac/DIABLO-S and the N-terminal deletion mutants Δ4 and Δ21 in the caspase-3 activation assay, which measures caspase-9 activity. Thus, deletion or substitution of the first 4 residues impairs the ability of Smac/DIABLO to interact with the BIR3 domain of XIAP and consequently its ability to promote caspase-3 activation by the caspase-9 apoptosome in the presence of XIAP. Nevertheless, because Smac/DIABLO-S and the N-terminal deletion mutants Δ4 and Δ21 can still interact with the BIR1/BIR2 domains of XIAP, which is important for caspase-3 and -7 inhibition (25Deveraux Q.L. Leo E. Stennicke H.R. Welsh K. Salvesen G.S. Reed J.C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5242-5251Crossref PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar), they had better caspase-promoting activity with caspase-3 and -7 (Figs. 2 b and 3 c) compared with that with caspase-9 in the presence of XIAP. Interestingly, all the three C-terminal deletion mutants (N7, N30, and N39) were able to interact with full-length XIAP, as well as the isolated BIR domains of XIAP (Fig. 3 d, right panel). However, the interaction of N7 with XIAP and its isolated BIR domains was weaker than that observed with N30 and N39. The weaker activity of N30 and N39 compared with wild type Smac/DIABLO (Fig. 3,b and c) suggests that the sequences C-terminal to residue 39 are still required to achieve optimal activity, probably because these sequences are necessary to maintain an overall structure capable of disrupting the interaction of XIAP with the active site of caspases at lower concentrations of Smac/DIABLO. Indeed, according to the crystal structure of Smac/DIABLO (26Chai J. Du C. Wu J.-W. Kyin S. Wang X. Shi Y. Nature. 2000; 406: 855-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar), the residues that are involved in dimerization of Smac/DIABLO are located within a hydrophobic interface C-terminal to residue 25. Mutations that disrupt Smac/DIABLO dimerization were found to diminish its caspase-promoting activity (26Chai J. Du C. Wu J.-W. Kyin S. Wang X. Shi Y. Nature. 2000; 406: 855-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar). Thus we believe that the weak activity of the short N-terminal peptides, although they can still interact with XIAP, is perhaps due to removal of the dimerization domain C-terminal to these peptides. The finding that short sequences derived from the N terminus of Smac/DIABLO can still interact with XIAP, cIAP-1, and cIAP-2 (Fig. 3 d and data not shown) and promote the caspase activity of caspase-9, -3, and -7 (Figs. 2 and 3) suggests that these sequences can be used to make peptides that could enhance the ability of chemotherapeutic agents to induce apoptosis in cancer cells with elevated levels of IAPs. To test this hypothesis, we synthesized four peptides based on the N-terminal sequences of mature Smac/DIABLO and Smac/DIABLO-S and tested their ability to promote cytochromec-dependent activation of caspase-3 in S100 extracts containing XIAP (Fig.3 e). The activity of caspase-3 in the S100 extracts was measured using the peptide substrate DEVD-AMC. The peptides containing the first 7 or 35 residues (Smac/DIABLO-N7 (pept-1) and Smac/DIABLO-N35 (pept-4), respectively) of mature Smac/DIABLO were very effective in promoting caspase-3 activation in the XIAP containing extracts at 100–500 μm concentrations. The longer peptide (Smac/DIABLO-N35) was noticeably better than the short peptide (Smac/DIABLO-N7) in promoting caspase-3 activation. The peptide derived from the N terminus of Smac/DIABLO-S (Smac/DIABLO-S-N9 (pept-2)) or derived from an internal Smac/DIABLO sequence (Smac/DIABLO 27–35 (pept-3)) were almost completely inactive in this assay. These results provide a proof of principle that short peptides derived from the N terminus of mature Smac/DIABLO could be used in the future as effective activators of caspases at attainable concentrations to kill cancer cells that overexpress IAPs. In Type II cells (e.g. breast adenocarcinoma MCF-7 cells) death receptor-induced apoptosis can be blocked by expression of Bcl-2 or Bcl-xL, but in Type I cells (e.g. B lymphoblastoid cell line SKW6.4) it can not (27Scaffidi C.

In Type II cells it is possible that direct activation of the effector caspases by caspase-8 is blocked at the level of the effector caspases by IAPs, such as XIAP (29Green D.G. Cell. 2000; 102: 1-4Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (887) Google Scholar). In this scenario, the cleavage of BID by caspase-8 might be required to release Smac/DIABLO to neutralize the IAPs and allow direct activation of the effector caspases by caspase-8 (30Li H. Zhu H. Xu C.J. Yuan J. Cell. 1998; 94: 491-501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3790) Google Scholar, 31Luo X. Budihardjo I. Zou H. Slaughter C. Wang X. Cell. 1998; 94: 481-490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3080) Google Scholar). If this hypothesis is correct, then Type II cells, which are not sensitive to death receptor-induced apoptosis, can be made sensitive to death receptor-induced apoptosis (Type I cells) by expression of a cytosolic form of Smac/DIABLO. To test this hypothesis, we constructed a mammalian GFP-Smac/DIABLO expression construct, which allows the expression of a cytosolic GFP-Smac/DIABLO fusion protein that can be cleaved by caspase-8 to generate mature Smac/DIABLO. This was achieved by introduction of an IETD-A cleavage site between the N-terminal GFP and the C-terminal Smac/DIABLO that lacks its MTS (Fig.4 a). Treatment of MCF-7 cells with TRAIL induced apoptosis in ∼28–40% of the cells. Overexpression of Bcl-xL inhibited TRAIL-induced apoptosis of MCF-7 cells confirming previous observations that these cells require the mitochondrial pathway for death receptor signaling (7Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Alnemri E.S. Mol Cell. 1998; 1: 949-957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (969) Google Scholar, 32Li F. Srinivasan A. Wang Y. Armstrong R.C. Tomaselli K.J. Fritz L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30299-30305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). Interestingly, transfection of GFP-Smac/DIABLO into the Bcl-xL-expressing MCF-7 cells bypassed the Bcl-xL inhibition and sensitized these cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis to a level almost similar to that observed in the absence of Bcl-xL (∼22–30% apoptosis). Moreover, transfection of GFP-Smac/DIABLO into MCF-7 cells in the absence of overexpressed Bcl-xL potentiated TRAIL-induced apoptosis and resulted in ∼65–80% cell death. The ability of GFP-Smac/DIABLO to potentiate TRAIL-induced apoptosis in the absence of overexpressed Bcl-xL is consistent with the presence of an IAP block in these cells. Indeed, we found that MCF-7 cells express high levels of XIAP (data not shown). These results suggest that the inability of death receptor ligands to induce apoptosis in Type II cells in the presence of overexpressed Bcl-xL is most likely attributed to inhibition of the effector caspases by IAPs. This inhibition can only be bypassed by release of Smac/DIABLO from the mitochondria, a function that is performed by BID in Type II cells after caspase-8 cleavage (Fig. 4 b). Therefore, if Smac/DIABLO gene inactivation is not proven to be lethal in the future, we expect that the phenotype of Smac/DIABLO-deficient mice would be similar to that of the BID-deficient mice (33Yin X.M.

Nature. 1999; 400: 886-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (865) Google Scholar) with respect to sensitivity of normal hepatocytes to FAS-induced apoptosis. Because normal hepatocytes are Type II cells, we predict that Smac/DIABLO gene inactivation should make these cells resistant to Fas-induced apoptosis. We thank Dr. D.

https://openalex.org/W2326889571,"Previously, we reported that adenovirus E1a protein behaves as a tumor suppressor in human cells. It apparently functions by transcriptionally inducing an array of epithelial cell adhesion genes, while repressing other cell-type specific genes, thus producing an epithelial phenotype. Concomitantly, the cells become sensitive to anoikis (apoptosis of epithelial cells detached from extracellular matrix), potentially causing tumor suppression. E1a protein interacts with the nuclear acetylases p300, CBP and P/CAF, and also with the co-repressor protein CtBP. In this study, we have determined the role of these interactions in E1a's phenotypic effects on human tumor cells. The results indicate that E1a's interaction with CtBP activates at least three epithelial cell adhesion gene promoters. The E-cadherin repressor appeared to be the CtBP-interacting protein δ EF1/ZEB, which bound the ras-repressible E-boxes of the E-cadherin promoter. The E1a–CtBP interaction also contributed to anoikis-sensitization. E1a's interactions with the nuclear acetylases conferred epithelial morphologies but did not activate epithelial genes. These latter interactions did not sensitize tumor cells to anoikis but nevertheless conferred tumor suppression. These results implicate CtBP as an antagonist of the epithelial phenotype and anoikis. They also indicate a new but undefined role for nuclear acetylases in maintaining the transformed phenotype."

Like humans, they have also developed the rare trait of vocal learning, this being the ability to acquire vocalizations through imitation rather than instinct5,6. Here we show, using behaviourally driven gene expression in freely ranging tropical animals, that the forebrain of hummingbirds contains seven discrete structures that are active during singing, providing the first anatomical and functional demonstration of vocal nuclei in hummingbirds. These structures are strikingly similar to seven forebrain regions that are involved in vocal learning and production in songbirds and parrots7,8,9,10,11,12,13—the only other avian orders known to be vocal learners5. This similarity is surprising, as songbirds, parrots and hummingbirds are thought to have evolved vocal learning and associated brain structures independently5,14, and it indicates that strong constraints may influence the evolution of forebrain vocal nuclei."
https://openalex.org/W2092310663,"Disruption of integrin-extracellular matrix interactions in normal epithelial cells induces apoptosis, a process termed anoikis. Reduced sensitivity to anoikis appears to be an important hallmark of oncogenic transformation, particularly in the process of metastasis. Several pathways have been implicated in the suppression of anoikis, however, the events which take place proximal to the integrin receptors remain unclear. Integrin-linked kinase (ILK) is an integrin-interacting protein kinase which has been identified as a potential PDK-2, as it is capable of phosphorylating PKB/Akt on Ser-473, and stimulating its activity. Here, we show that ILK activity is stimulated upon adhesion of SCP2 mouse mammary epithelial cells to fibronectin, and inhibited in suspended cells. Overexpression of ILK in the anoikis-sensitive SCP2 cells results in a profound inhibition of anoikis, as determined by annexin V binding and activation of caspases 8 and 3. This effect is reversible by the transfection and expression of a dominant-negative, kinase deficient ILK (ILK KD), as well as by a dominant negative PKB/Akt (PKB AAA). On the other hand, transfection of a dominant negative form of FAK (FRNK) failed to reverse the suppression of anoikis by ILK. Furthermore, inhibition of ILK activity induced anoikis in two anoikis-resistant human breast cancer cell lines. These findings suggest that ILK plays a major role in the suppression of anoikis."

https://openalex.org/W2069294039,"P16 and P14ARF are two tumor suppressors encoded by the locus ink4a-arf which is frequently deleted in human tumors. Recent experiments performed with mouse embryonic fibroblasts have shown that P14ARF is an upstream regulator of the P53 pathway. This raises the question as to whether in human tumors the loss of p14arf and mutation of p53 are mutually exclusive events which segregate with genetic alterations at other loci. To examine this question we performed a multigenic analysis on 29 gliomas. We analysed p53 and p14arf in relation with five other genetic loci encoding the most frequently mutated genes in human gliomas: cdkn2a, mdm2, egfr, pten and the chromosomal regions 10q23.3 and 10q25-26. Our study shows for the first time that p53 mutations and p14arf deletions appear mutually exclusive in human glioblastoma, suggesting that they may be functionally redundant in glioma tumorigenesis. The P53 pathway is, therefore, disrupted in 81.8% of malignant gliomas (WHO grades III and IV), either by mutation of the p53 gene (31.8%) or by p14arf deletion (54.5%). These tumors further showed MDM2 overexpression (9.1%), egfr oncogene amplification/egfr overexpression (50%), pten mutations (27.3%) and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at the chromosomal regions 10q23.3 (86.4%) and 10q25-26 (100%). These alterations did not segregate with p53 mutations or p14arf deletions, while p14arf and cdkn2a were always deleted."
https://openalex.org/W2037520011,"The role of FGF signaling in early epithelial differentiation was investigated in ES (embryonic stem) cell derived embryoid bodies. A dominant negative fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) mutation was created by stably introducing into ES cells an Fgfr2 cDNA, truncated in its enzymatic domains. These cells failed to differentiate into cystic embryoid bodies. No epithelial differentiation and cavitation morphogenesis could be observed, in the mutant, although its rate of cell proliferation remained unchanged. This phenotype was associated with a significant decrease in the activation of Akt/PKB and PLCgamma-1, as compared to the wild type, while the activation of MAPK/Erk was less affected. Requirement for PI 3-kinase signaling in embryoid body differentiation was demonstrated by specific inhibitors. Akt/PKB activation was abrogated by wortmannin in short-term experiments. In long-term cultures Ly294002 inhibited the differentiation of ES cells into embryoid bodies.

One of these injected proteins, the Yersiniaprotein kinase A (YpkA), has previously been shown to affect the morphology of cultured eukaryotic cells as well as to localize to the plasma membrane following its injection into HeLa cells. Here it is shown that these activities are mediated by separable domains of YpkA. The amino terminus, which contains the kinase domain, is sufficient to localize YpkA to the plasma membrane while the carboxyl terminus of YpkA is required for YpkAs morphological effects. YpkAs carboxyl-terminal region was found to affect the levels of actin-containing stress fibers as well as block the activation of the GTPase RhoA in Yersinia-infected cells. We show that the carboxyl-terminal region of YpkA, which contains sequences that bear similarity to the RhoA-binding domains of several eukaryotic RhoA-binding kinases, directly interacts with RhoA as well as Rac (but not Cdc42) and displays a slight but measurable binding preference for the GDP-bound form of RhoA. Surprisingly, YpkA binding to RhoAGDP affected neither the intrinsic nor guanine nucleotide exchange factor-mediated GDP/GTP exchange reaction suggesting that YpkA controls activated RhoA levels by a mechanism other than by simply blocking guanine nucleotide exchange factor activity. We go on to show that YpkAs kinase activity is neither dependent on nor promoted by its interaction with RhoA and Rac but is, however, entirely dependent on heat-sensitive eukaryotic factors present in HeLa cell extracts and fetal calf serum. Collectively, our data show that YpkA possesses both similarities and differences with the eukaryotic RhoA/Rac-binding kinases and suggest that the yersiniae utilize the Rho GTPases for unique activities during their interaction with eukaryotic cells.

Reeves P.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 7-12Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar)) that delivers bacterially encoded proteins directly into eukaryotic cells following attachment of the bacterium to the host cell (2Cornelis G.R. Wolf-Watz H. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 23: 861-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). Effector proteins injected into eukaryotic cells by type III secretion systems have been shown to modulate a variety of processes such as Rhizobium-mediated root nodulation (3Viprey V. Del Greco A. Golinowski W. Broughton W.J. Perret X. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 28: 1381-1389Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar), plant hypersensitivity responses (e.g. see Ref. 4Yang Y. Shah J. Klessig D.F.

Science. 1999; 284: 1322-1328Crossref PubMed Scopus (1026) Google Scholar). The type III-injected proteins of the pathogenic species of Yersinia inhibit eukaryotic defense responses that normally occur when cells contact bacteria such as phagocytosis (6Rosqvist R. Bölin I. Wolf-Watz H. Infect. Immun. 1988; 56: 2139-2143Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines (7Nakajima R. Brubaker R. Infect.

One such injected protein required forYersinia-mediated lethality in the mouse, YpkA, is a 733-residue protein that contains in its NH2 terminus a domain that bears close sequence similarity to eukaryotic Ser/Thr protein kinases (10Galyov E.E. Håkansson S. Forsberg Å. Wolf-Watz H. Nature. 1993; 361: 730-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar, 11Galyov E.E. Håkansson S. Wolf-Watz H. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 4543-4548Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). When injected into cultured eukaryotic cells by the Yersinia type III system YpkA induces cells to retract leaving long finger-like extensions attached to the substratum (12Håkansson S. Galyov E.E. Rosqvist R. Wolf-Watz H. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 20: 593-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). The Rho GTPases (Rho, Rac, and Cdc42) form a subgroup of the Ras superfamily of small GTP-binding proteins that play a central regulatory role in a number of cellular activities which require cytoskeletal rearrangements such as phagocytosis and motility (13Van Aelst L. D'Souza-Schorey C. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2295-2322Crossref PubMed Scopus (2097) Google Scholar, 14Mackay D.J.G. Hall A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20685-20688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar). The importance of the Rho proteins in eukaryotic defense responses is indicated by the fact that a number of bacterial pathogens have evolved toxins that specifically target their activity. For example, pathogenicEscherichia coli, Bordetella bronchiseptica, andClostridium botulinum produce toxins that either covalently modify RhoA in such a way that it remains “locked” in its active, GTP-bound state (E. coli (15Schmidt G. Sehr P. Wilm M. Selzer J. Mann M. Aktories K. Nature. 1997; 387: 725-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar, 16Flatau G. Lemichez E. Gauthier M. Chardin P. Paris S. Fiorentini C. Boquet P.

Hall A. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1989; 158: 209-213Google Scholar)). Similarly, the pathogenic Salmonella injects a protein toxin, SopE, into eukaryotic cells (19Wood M.W. Rosqvist R. Mullan P.B. Edwards M.H. Galyov E.E. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 22: 327-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar) that possesses a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF)1activity primarily for Cdc42 (20Hardt W.-D. Chen L.-M. Schuebel K.E. Bustelo X.R. Galán J.E. Cell. 1998; 93: 815-826Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar). SopEs activity within eukaryotic cells results in membrane ruffling which promotes Salmonellainternalization (20Hardt W.-D. Chen L.-M. Schuebel K.E. Bustelo X.R. Galán J.E. Cell. 1998; 93: 815-826Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar). Interestingly, Salmonellainjects a second protein, SptP, into eukaryotic cells that acts as a GTPase-activating protein toward Rac and Cdc42 which apparently serves to repair the host cell membrane following bacterial uptake (21Fu Y. Galán J.E. Nature. 1999; 401: 293-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). These examples illustrate that by targeting the small GTP-binding proteins bacterial pathogens are able to manipulate cellular processes to their advantage. We were interested in identifying the domains of YpkA that are required for its morphological altering properties and its intracellular targeting to the plasma membrane. Additionally, based on comparative sequence analysis and how it affects eukaryotic cell morphology, we investigated whether YpkA targets the Rho proteins. We found that YpkA shares both similarities and differences with the eukaryotic RhoA-binding kinases perhaps indicating that ypkAs ancestral gene, which was likely “captured” from a eukaryotic organism by the yersiniae at some point in the past, underwent extensive modification in order to serve the needs of a prokaryotic pathogen. For expression of ypkA inYersinia, the multiple yop mutant strain (12Håkansson S. Galyov E.E. Rosqvist R. Wolf-Watz H. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 20: 593-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar) was transformed with either a plasmid (pEG2 (12Håkansson S. Galyov E.E. Rosqvist R. Wolf-Watz H. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 20: 593-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar); here designated as pYpkA) containing the entire ypkA open reading frame and upstream promoter regions, or derivatives of pEG2 which contained either a point mutation in the kinase catalytic domain (pYpkAD270A) or an internal deletion in the carboxyl terminus (pYpkAΔ543–640). pYpkAD270A was constructed by first synthesizing ypkA codons 1–284 by PCR using a 3′ primer containing the D270A substitution (underlined): 5′-CTCTCCGCTAGCGCGGTCAAATACCACATTACCGGGTTTGATAGCGTTATGTAC-3′. The resulting PCR product was digested with BglII andNheI (which appear in the wild type ypkA open reading frame at codons 66 and 281, respectively) and ligated intoBglII/NheI-digested pYpkA. Presence of the point mutation was confirmed by sequencing. pYpkAΔ543–640 was prepared simply by digesting pYpkA with PstI followed by religation thus taking advantage of the fact that the two PstI sites are in the same reading frame. RhoA-myc-, GST-RhoA-, and GST-V14-RhoA-encoding plasmids were provided by Brahim Houssa and W. J. van Blitterswijk (The Netherlands Cancer Institute, Amsterdam). The GST-Rac1- and GST-Cdc42-encoding plasmids were obtained from Lawrence A. Quilliam (Indiana University School of Medicine) and Alan Hall (University College London, London, UK), respectively. A GST-SopE-encoding plasmid was provided by Edouard Galyov (Institute of Animal Health, United Kingdom). A YpkA-encoding eukaryotic expression plasmid was constructed by first separately amplifying the 5′ and 3′ ends of ypkAusing primer sets 5′-AACAAGATCCATATGAAAAGCGTGAAAATCATGGGAACT-3′/5′-CTCCCGAAGCTTCTTGGGTGT-3′ and 5′-CCCAAGAAGCTTCGGGAGCTA-3′/5′-TTACGCCGGCGTCACATCCAT-3′, respectively. The respective PCR products were cloned into theSmaI site of pGEM-3 (Promega) and sequenced. The 5′ and 3′ypkA fragments were excised from pGEM-3 with eitherPstI/HindIII orHindIII/HincII, respectively, ligated to each other (the HindIII site appears naturally in ypkAat codon 444), and ligated back into pGEM-3 yielding the plasmid pGEM-ypkA. Full-length ypkA was then excised from pGEM-3 with XbaI and cloned into the corresponding site of pCMS-EGFP, that encodes GFP from a separate cytomegalovirus promoter (CLONTECH). A D270A YpkA variant cloned in pCMS-EGFP was made by first digesting pYpkAD270A (see above) with BglII/NheI, isolating the resulting 600-base pair fragment (that contains the D270A substitution), and using this fragment to replace the correspondingBglII/NheI fragment from pGEM-ypkA(see above) yielding the plasmid pGEM-ypkA D270A. pGEM-ypkAD270A was digested with XbaI and cloned into the corresponding site of pCMS-EGFP. A COOH-terminal deletion ypkA variant was constructed by digesting pGEM/YpkA with HindIII, filling with Klenow, followed by digestion with EcoRI. The resulting 1.3-kilobase fragment, encoding the 443 NH2-terminal codons of ypkA, was ligated into pCMS-EGFP that had been digested with XbaI, filled with Klenow, followed by digestion with EcoRI. The yeast two-hybrid plasmids pGal4BD-YpkA97–347 and pGal4BD-YpkA442–733 were constructed by amplifying ypkA using 5′-CGCAGGAATTCAGGTCTGATATCCCCAAT-3′ and 5′-GAATCTCAGTCCTGCAGTAGGCTTTATC-3′ for codons 97–347 and 5′-GTAAGGCAGATCTCACCCAAGAAGCTTCGGGAG-3′ and 5′-TTGGATGCATTCACATCCATTCCCGCTCCAACCGGTT-3′ for codons 442–733 and ligating the resulting digested PCR products into pGBT9 (CLONTECH). pGal4BD-YpkA442–733(Δ543–640)was prepared by digesting pGal4BD-YpkA442–733with PstI followed by religation (see above). DNA fragments encoding human RhoA codons 1–719 were amplified by PCR from a cDNA library prepared from HeLa cells using the downstream primer 5′-ATTCATAGATCTTTGCAGAGCAGCTCTCGTAGC-3′ with either a wild type encoding upstream primer (5′-GAGATCGAATTCATGGCTGCCATCCGGAAGAAA-3′) or an upstream primer containing a G14V substitution (underlined) (5′-GAGATCGAATTCATGGCTGCCATCCGGAAGAAACTGGTGATTGTTGGTGATGTAGCCTGT-3′). The RhoA-encoding PCR products were cloned into pGAD424 (CLONTECH). The yeast host strain used for the two-hybrid assay was PJ69-4A (22James P. Halladay J. Craig E.A.

For the competitive two-hybrid assay, theSmaI/XbaI fragment of pBridge (CLONTECH), a pGBT9-derived bait plasmid possessing a second multiple cloning site (MCSII) located downstream of the inducible Met25 promoter, was replaced by the correspondingSmaI/XbaI fragment excised from pGal4BD-YpkA442–733 (see above) which contained the ypkA open reading frame. To clone the YpkA or RhoA “competitors” into MCSII, YpkA- or RhoA-encoding fragments were generated by PCR using the following primer sets: YpkA449–733, 5′-ATTGCGGCCGCATCTGATTTGCTTAGGACGCATTTG-3′ and 5′-ATTAGATCTTCACATCCATTCCCGCTCGTT-3′; RhoA, 5′-ATTGCGGCCGCAATGGCTGCCATCCGGAAGAAA-3′ and 5′-ATTCATAGATCTTTGCAGAGCAGCTCTCGTAGC-3′. The yeast host strain used for the competitive two-hybrid assay was CG-1945 (CLONTECH). Cells were transfected using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.), fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100, and processed for indirect immunofluorescence labeling (for details see Ref. 23Rosqvist R. Forsberg Å. Wolf-Watz H. Infect. Immun. 1991; 59: 4562-4569Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using affinity purified rabbit anti-YpkA antibodies followed by Alexa 488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibodies (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). The specimens were analyzed using a laser scanning confocal microscope equipped with dual detectors and an argon-krypton laser for simultaneous scanning of two different fluorochromes (Multiprobe 2001, Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). Sets of fluorescent images were acquired simultaneously for GFP and Alexa 488-tagged markers. Companion images (30 sections with an image size of 512 × 512) were scanned with 0.07-μm pixel size and 0.37-μm step size. The acquired sets of images were processed using the Huygens2 deconvolution algorithm (Bitplane) and then volume rendered using the Imaris (Bitplane) software. For actin staining transfected cells were fixed and permeabilized, incubated with rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) for 30 min at 37 °C, and analyzed similarly as immunostained cells. The affinity purification of active RhoA was performed essential as described by Ren et al.(24Ren X.-D. Kiosses W.B. Schwartz M.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 578-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (1366) Google Scholar). HeLa cells were infected as described below after which they were washed with cold PBS and lysed in RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.2, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 500 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2) supplemented with 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg/ml each of leupeptin, pepstatin, and aprotinin. Lysates were cleared by centrifugation and equivalent amounts of lysate proteins were incubated with the GST-rhotekinRBD protein for 1 h. After four washes in lysis buffer samples were boiled in Laemmli sample buffer and bound Rho proteins were detected by immunoblotting using RhoA-specific antisera (Santa Cruz, SC-418). YpkA does not detectably interact with RhoA in RIPA buffer. 2K. Schesser, unpublished observations. GST and GST-RhoA proteins were prepared by growing 25-ml cultures toA 600 0.75, inducing with 0.01 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 3 h, and lysing cells in a 1.2-ml volume of buffer N (1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 50 mm Tris, pH 8) by sonication. Cleared lysates were mixed with one-tenth volume (packed) buffer N-washed glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biochem) and incubated for 20 min at room temperature followed by two washings with buffer N. For nucleotide loading (25Vincent S. Settleman J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2247-2256Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), beads were placed in 50 mm HEPES (pH 7), 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol with 0.5 mm GDP, GTP, or GTPγS (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and incubated at 37 °C for 15 min. Nucleotide loading was terminated by adding MgCl2 to 20 mm and beads were collected and resuspended in eitherYersinia- or HeLa-derived cell extracts. Yersinia cell extracts were prepared by first diluting overnight cultures 1/20 into 25 ml of LB, incubating with shaking at 26 °C for 30 min, followed by a 60-min incubation at 37 °C which induces Yop expression (26Bölin I. Wolf-Watz H. Infect. Immun. 1984; 43: 72-78Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were sonicated in 1.2 ml of cold buffer N, cleared by centrifugation, and supernatants were added directly to approximately 1 μg of either GST- or GST-RhoA-bound beads. For the recovery of YpkA from Yersinia-infected HeLa cells, overnight Yersinia cultures were diluted 10-fold into tissue culture media (RPMI supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum) and Yop expression induced as described above. Approximately 2 × 106 HeLa cells were infected in 10-cm Petri dishes at a multiplicity of infection of 100 in a 7.5-ml volume of antibiotic-free tissue culture media. After 2.5 h cells were washed twice with PBS and lysed on ice with 1 ml of buffer N containing protease inhibitors for 60 min. Buffer N extracts were then cleared by centrifugation (thus removing the insoluble cellular material as well as the bacteria which in buffer N are not lysed)2 and the resulting supernatants added directly to GST- or GST-RhoA-bound beads. GST- or GST-GTPase-bound beads (containing approximately 1 μg of the various GST proteins) in a 30-μl packed volume were resuspended in YpkA-containing bacterial or HeLa cell extracts and rotated at 4 °C for 60 min. Beads were washed twice with cold buffer N and either resuspended directly in Laemmli sample buffer or 20 μl of premixed kinase buffer (buffer N containing 1 mm dithiothreitol, phosphatase inhibitor mixtures I and II (Sigma), 1 μl (10 μCi) of [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and either 5 μl of a buffer N extract prepared from uninfected HeLa cells (see above) or fetal calf serum. Some kinase reactions were supplemented with HeLa cell extract that had been incubated at 95 °C for 5 min. Following being shaken at room temperature for 15 min, beads were washed twice with buffer N and resuspended in Laemmli sample buffer and analyzed as described in the figure legend. Immunoprecipitated YpkA was prepared by mixing 1 ml of YpkA-containingYersinia buffer N extract with 20 μl of YpkA-specific antisera, incubating on ice for 60 min, followed by the addition of 100 μl (packed volume) of buffer N-washed protein G-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Samples were rotated 45 min at 4 °C, after which beads were washed twice with buffer N, divided into two equal parts, and resuspended in 100 μl of buffer N containing either GST or GST-RhoA that had been eluted from glutathione-Sepharose beads with 10 mm glutathione. Samples were rotated 30 min at 4 °C to allow RhoA/YpkA binding followed by the addition of 100 μl of 2 × kinase buffer supplemented with HeLa cell extract. After being shaken for 15 min at room temperature beads were washed twice with buffer N and analyzed as described in the figure legend. Baculovirus stocks containing GST-Lbc- and GST-Lsc-encoding plasmids (27Glaven J.A. Whitehead I.P. Nomanbhoy T. Kay R. Cerione R.A. J. Biol.

Insect cells were lysed by sonication in buffer N and GST proteins isolated similarly as bacterially expressed GST proteins. GST-RhoA-bound beads were loaded with [8-3H]GDP (12.9 Ci/mmol) as described above followed by saturable binding to YpkA (as determined by titration). GST-RhoAGDP/YpkA-bound beads were washed and resuspended in buffer N containing 1 mm GTP and supplements (either 10 mm EDTA, or GST-Lbc, GST-Lsc, or GST-SopE as indicated in the figure legend). Samples were incubated at 30 °C with occasional shaking and at the indicated time points aliquots were removed and added to a large excess of ice-cold buffer N. Beads were collected, washed a second time with cold buffer N, and resuspended in Scintillation fluid (OptiPhase HiSafe, Wallac Scintillation Products) and counted for 1 min. A HeLa cytosolic extract was prepared by removing attached cells grown to confluence from two 175-cm2 with trypsin, resuspending the cells in 2 ml of PBS, 0.25 m sucrose, and sonicating the cells for 10 s in 0.5-ml volumes. Sonicates were spun first at low-speed in a microcentrifuge and then at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. The resulting supernatant was applied to a Sephacryl S-300-containing column with a total volume of 340 ml and eluted with PBS at a flow-rate of 20 ml/h. A prefraction was collected followed by 100 fractions of 2.5 ml each. Fractions were assayed for their kinase promoting activity by combining 1 ml of each fraction with bead-bound GST-RhoA/YpkA (described above), incubating for 30 min at 4 °C, and resuspending the beads in kinase buffer. The kinase assay was performed as described above. For serum fractionation, 4 ml of fetal calf serum was applied to the same S-300 column used for the HeLa extract and eluted using essentially the same conditions. Serum fractions were analyzed by adding 20 μl of each fraction directly to the kinase assay described above. The column was calibrated under the same conditions with blue dextran, human IgG, human serum albumin, ovalbumin, and tritiated water. We first tested whether the kinase activity of YpkA was required for the YpkA-mediated effect on eukaryotic cell morphology (see Introduction). A kinase-deficient point mutant (D270A, see below) of YpkA was constructed and tested for its effects on HeLa cells. Surprisingly, the morphology of HeLa cells infected with Yersinia expressing the D270A variant of YpkA was indistinguishable from that of HeLa cells infected with wild type YpkA-expressing Yersinia (Fig.1). In contrast, HeLa cells infected withYersinia expressing a variant of YpkA with an internal deletion in its carboxyl-terminal region (YpkAΔ543–640), did not induce the characteristic morphology even at very high inoculations (Fig. 1).Figure 1YpkA-mediated effects on cell morphology. HeLa cells were cultured on glass slides, infected with Y. pseudotuberculosis, and visualized by differential interference contrast microscopy 2 h postinfection. Cells were infected with multiple yop mutant (MYM) Yersinia strain expressing either wild type YpkA (A), the catalytically inactive YpkAD270A variant of YpkA (B), or a variant of YpkA, YpkAΔ543–640, containing an internal deletion in the COOH terminus (C). D,cells infected with the multiple yop mutant host strain. Note the pronounced retraction fibers in A and B.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We next examined whether the YpkA-mediated morphological effect shown in Fig. 1 was accompanied by alterations in the actin-based cytoskeletal system. Approximately 1 h after the onset of infection, slightly fewer actin-containing stress fibers were observed in HeLa cells infected with Yersinia expressing full-length YpkA compared with cells infected with Yersinia expressing the YpkAΔ543–640 variant (not shown). However, upon longer exposure (2 h) no stress fibers were observed in cells infected with Yersinia expressing either the full-length or Δ543–640 variants of YpkA as well as in cells infected with non-YpkA-expressing Yersinia strains (not shown). It is likely therefore that any YpkA-mediated effect on actin stress fibers is at least partially obscured by a general effect of the bacteria on the cytoskeletal system. To determine whether YpkAs effect on cell morphology and actin dynamics was dependent on other Yersinia-derived factors, either full-length ypkA (both wild type and the D270A mutant) or aypkA carboxyl-terminal deletion variant were cloned into a eukaryotic expression vector that also encoded gfp under the control of a separate viral promoter. The transfection of HeLa cells with the full-length YpkA expression plasmids were notably less efficient (as determined by counting the number of GFP positive cells) compared with transfections using either the carboxyl-terminal deleted YpkA-encoding or the empty vector plasmids (not shown).Yersinia-expressed YpkA and YpkA expressed in transiently transfected HeLa cells were indistinguishable as analyzed by SDS-PAGE (not shown). Cells transfected with either the wild type or D270AypkA variants displayed a morphology that was similar to that of cells infected with YpkA-expressing Yersinia (Fig.2). In contrast, cells transfected with the carboxyl-terminal YpkA deletion mutant did not undergo the gross morphological alteration observed in full-length ypkAtransfectants and appeared identical in their overall shape to cells transfected with the vector only (Fig. 2). Phalloidin staining indicated that while there were no differences in stress fibers between cells transfected with either the vector or the carboxyl-deleted YpkA-encoding plasmids, cells expressing full-length YpkA had a clear deficiency in the levels of stress fibers (Fig. 2). We next addressed whether YpkAs localization to the plasma membrane was also, like its activity in affecting cellular morphology, dependent on domains located at the carboxyl terminus. By immunostaining it was found that transfected full-length YpkA localized to the plasma membrane (Fig. 3 A). The carboxyl-terminal YpkA deletion mutant also accumulated at the plasma membrane (Fig. 3 B) showing that the plasma membrane targeting domain is contained in the amino-terminal region of YpkA. It is worth noting that YpkA localized to the plasma membrane in both infected cells (12Håkansson S. Galyov E.E. Rosqvist R. Wolf-Watz H. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 20: 593-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar) as well as transfected cells which were not undergoing bacterial exposure thus indicating that YpkAs targeting to the membrane is not dependent on cellular stress responses that follow bacterial contact. Together these data show that transfectedypkA is expressed and that the activity of the protein within eukaryotic cells resembles that of bacterially injected YpkA. Furthermore, the YpkA properties of affecting cellular morphology and intracellular localization are mediated by separable domains located in the carboxyl- and amino-terminal regions, respectively. Since the Rho GTPases are key regulators in controlling the actin-based cytoskeleton network, we determined whether YpkA affected the levels of RhoAGTP in Yersinia-infected cells. Using a RhoAGTP-specific affinity purification assay (24Ren X.-D. Kiosses W.B. Schwartz M.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 578-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (1366) Google Scholar) we observed a slight increase in the amount of RhoAGTPrecovered in cells infected with Yersinia expressing either the wild type or D270A variants of YpkA compared with the amount of RhoAGTP recovered in uninfected cells (Fig.4). However, significantly more RhoAGTP was recovered in cells infected withYersinia expressing the Δ543–640 variant of YpkA compared with either the uninfected cells or the cells infected withYersinia expressing full-length YpkA variants (comparelanes 2 with 1,"

We cloned the brat gene from a transposon-tagged allele and identified its gene product. brat encodes for an 1037 amino acid protein with an N-terminal B-boxl zinc finger followed by a B-box2 zinc finger, a coiled-coil domain, and a C-terminal beta-propeller domain with six blades. All these motifs are known to mediate protein-protein interactions. Sequence analysis of four brat alleles revealed that all of them are mutated at the beta-propeller domain. The clustering of mutations in this domain strongly suggests that it has a crucial role in the normal function of Brat, and defines a novel protein motif involved in tumor suppression activity. The brat gene is expressed in the embryonic central and peripheral nervous systems including the embryonic brain. In third instar larva brat expression was detected in the larval central nervous system including the brain and the ventral ganglion, in two glands - the ring gland and the salivary gland, and in parts of the foregut - the gastric caecae and the proventriculus. A second brat-like gene was found in D. melanogaster, and homologs were identified in the nematode, mouse, rat, and human. Accumulated data suggests that Brat may regulate proliferation and differentiation by secretion/transport-mediated processes."
https://openalex.org/W2055187302,"Mammalian tissues differ dramatically in their sensitivity to genotoxic stress, although the mechanisms determining these differences remain largely unknown. To analyse the role of p53 and p21 in determination of tissue specificity to DNA damage in vivo, we compared the effects of gamma radiation on DNA synthesis on whole-body sections of wild type, p53-deficient and p21-deficient mice. A dramatic reduction in 14C-thymidine incorporation after gamma irradiation was observed in the majority of rapidly proliferating tissues of wild type and p21-/- but not in p53-/- mice, confirming the key role of p53 in determination of tissue response to genotoxic stress in vivo and suggesting that p53-mediated inhibition of DNA synthesis does not depend on p21. Rapid radiation induced p53-dependent apoptosis was mapped to the areas of high levels of p53 mRNA in radiation sensitive tissues analysed (white pulp in the spleen and bases of crypts in small intestine), indicating that p53 regulation at the mRNA level is a determinant of cellular sensitivity to genotoxic stress. High p53 mRNA expression is inherited as a recessive trait in cell-cell hybrids suggesting the involvement of a negative control mechanism in the regulation of p53 gene expression."

The results were compared to those of a previous analysis of 50 HCCs selected on the basis of their positivity for HBV infection. The majority of the abnormalities found in the HBV positive cases (losses of chromosome arms 1p, 8p, 6q, 13q and 14q and gains of 1q, 8q, 6p and 17q) were similarly detected in the virus negative specimens. In contrast, a significant decrease (40% on average) was observed for losses at 4q, 16q and 17p in non-viral HCC samples, suggesting that these abnormalities are tightly associated with HBV infection. Thus, in addition to a common pathway towards malignancy, a subset of alterations may preferentially contribute to virus-induced carcinogenesis. In a parallel CGH study of 10 fibrolamellar carcinomas, a rare subtype of HCC, we found in six out of the seven informative cases, gains of chromosome arm 1q. This region, which is also preferentially amplified in non fibrolamellar tumors (58%), may contain an essential proto-oncogene commonly implicated in liver carcinogenesis."

Modulation of the transcription factor binding to IGF-II P4 by wild-type p53 and p53mt249 was identified. Wild-type p53 inhibited binding of transcription factors Sp1 and TBP on the P4 promoter, while p53mt249 enhanced the formation of transcriptional complexes through enhanced DNA-protein (Sp1 or TBP) and protein–protein (Sp1 and TBP) interactions. p53mt249 stimulates transcription factor Sp1 phosphorylation which might be a cause of increased transcription factor binding on the P4 promoter while wild-type p53 does not. Transfection of hepatocytes with p53mt249 impaired induction of apoptosis by the HBV-X protein and TNF-α. Therefore, the blocking of apoptosis through enhanced production of IGF-II should provide a favorable opportunity for the selection of transformed hepatocytes. These results explain the molecular basis for the genesis of HCC by p53mt249 which was found to be induced by a potent mutagen, AFB1."

It has been previously shown that E4orf4 interacts with protein phosphatase 2A through the phosphatase Bα subunit. It was further shown that PP2A is required for performing the various E4orf4 functions. We report here that E4orf4 interacts with multiple isoforms of the PP2A-B′ subunit, as well as with Bα. We map the interaction sites of the B subunits on E4orf4 and show that they overlap but are not identical. We identify a dominant negative E4orf4 mutant, which disrupts the PP2A holoenzyme. We show that induction of apoptosis by E4orf4, which we previously reported to require the interaction with Bα, is not affected by the interaction with B′. Our results suggest that the interaction of E4orf4 with various PP2A subpopulations may mediate the different E4orf4 functions."
https://openalex.org/W2140422307,"The transcription factor Bach2, a member of the BTB-basic region leucine zipper (bZip) factor family, binds to a 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA)-responsive element and the related Maf-recognition element (MARE) by forming homodimers or heterodimers with Maf-related transcription factors. Bach2 regulates transcription by binding to these elements. To understand the function in hematopoiesis, we isolated a cDNA clone for human Bach2 (BACH2) encoding a protein of 841 amino acid residues with a deduced amino acid sequence having 89.5% identity to mouse homolog. Among human hematopoietic cell lines, BACH2 is expressed abundantly only in some B-lymphocytic cell lines. RT-PCR analysis of hematopoietic cells revealed that BACH2 mRNA is expressed in primary B-cells. Enforced expression of BACH2 in a human Burkitt cell line, RAJI that does not express endogenous BACH2, resulted in marked reduction of clonogenic activity, indicating that BACH2 possesses an inhibitory effect on cell proliferation. By fluorescent in situ hybridization, the BACH2 gene was localized to chromosome 6q15. Because deletion of the long arm of chromosome 6 (6q) is one of the commonest chromosomal alterations in human B-cell lymphoma, we examined for the loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of the BACH2 gene in human B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHL). Among 25 informative cases, five (20%) showed LOH. These results indicate that BACH2 plays important roles in regulation of B cell development."

HPV16 E5 binds to the 16 kDa proteolipid (subunit c) of the vacuolar H+-ATPase (16K), responsible for endosomal acidification, and this binding has been suggested to be responsible for increased recycling of the EGFRs. Using mutant deletions we show here that amino acids 54–78, but not 79–83 are necessary for binding to the 16K proteolipid. EGF treatment of cells expressing wild type or mutants of the E5 protein show that deletion of the last carboxy terminal 5 amino acids results in loss of E5-mediated EGFR overactivation. Thus, our results show that the binding capacity of HPV16 E5 to 16K can be dissociated from the effect of the viral protein on EGFR activation."

Sequence homology revealed that Je2 maps to 3p21.3, to an intronic region of the candidate TSG LUCA-15 locus. It represents, in fact, an antisense transcript to the 3'-UTR of two novel splice variants of this gene. Overexpression of sequence representing one of these splice variants (a 2.6 kb cDNA termed Clone 26), inhibited proliferation of Jurkat cells and sensitized them to CD95-mediated apoptosis.

Each FGFR binds to a unique subset of FGFs and ligand binding specificity is essential in regulating FGF activity. FGF-7 recognizes one FGFR isoform known as the FGFR2 IIIb isoform or keratinocyte growth factor receptor (KGFR), whereas FGF-2 binds well to FGFR1, FGFR2, and FGFR4 but interacts poorly with KGFR. Previously, mutations in FGF-2 identified a set of residues that are important for high affinity receptor binding, known as the primary receptor-binding site. FGF-7 contains this primary site as well as a region that restricts interaction with FGFR1. The sequences that confer on FGF-7 its specific binding to KGFR have not been identified. By utilizing domain swapping and site-directed mutagenesis we have found that the loop connecting the β4-β5 strands of FGF-7 contributes to high affinity receptor binding and is critical for KGFR recognition. Replacement of this loop with the homologous loop from FGF-2 dramatically reduced both the affinity of FGF-7 for KGFR and its biological potency but did not result in the ability to bind FGFR1. Point mutations in residues comprising this loop of FGF-7 reduced both binding affinity and biological potency.

The prototype FGFR is composed of an extracellular ligand-binding domain that contains three immunoglobulin-like domains (D1-D3), a transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic domain that bears the tyrosine kinase activity (4McKeehan W.L. Wang F. Kan M. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1998; 59: 135-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar, 5Johnson D.E. Lu J. Chen H. Werner S. Williams L.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4627-4634Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). Receptor binding specificity is an essential element in regulating the diverse activities of FGFs. Each of the four FGFRs binds a subset of FGFs with varying affinities, and an additional level of complexity is created via an alternative splicing mechanism that generates FGFR1-FGFR3 isoforms with altered ligand binding properties (4McKeehan W.L. Wang F. Kan M. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1998; 59: 135-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar, 5Johnson D.E. Lu J. Chen H. Werner S. Williams L.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4627-4634Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). This phenomenon is best exemplified for the FGFR2IIIb isoform, also known as the keratinocyte growth factor receptor (KGFR). This receptor is a spliced variant of FGFR2. While FGFR2 binds FGF-1 and FGF-2 with high affinity and does not interact with the keratinocyte growth factor (FGF-7 or KGF), the KGFR binds FGF-1 and FGF-7 with high affinity and FGF-2 with a 20-fold lower affinity (8Bottaro D.P.

FGF-7 is unique among its family members since this growth factor has a distinctive target cell specificity. Whereas the other FGFs have broader cell type specificity, FGF-7 is secreted by cells of mesenchymal origin and acts predominantly on cells of epithelial origin (10Rubin J.S. Bottaro D.P. Chedid M. Miki T. Ron D. Cunha G.R. Finch P.W. Goldberg I.D. Rosen E.M. Epithelial-Mesenchymal Interactions in Cancer. Birkhauser Verlag Press, Basal, Switzerland1995: 191-214Google Scholar). The unique target cell specificity of FGF-7 is dictated by virtue of the fact that unlike the other FGFs, which can interact with several FGFRs, FGF-7 can only bind to the KGFR isoform that is specifically expressed in epithelial cells (11Finch P.W. Cunha G.R. Rubin J.S. Wong J. Ron D. Dev. Dyn. 1995; 203: 223-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Because of its unique receptor binding characteristics, FGF-7 is ideal for studying how the specificity of FGF-FGFR interaction is conferred at the structural level. The three-dimensional structures of three FGFs, FGF-1, FGF-2, and FGF-7 have been resolved (12Zhu X. Komiya H. Chirino A. Faham S. Fox G.M. Arakawa T. Hsu B.T. Rees D.C.

Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 1681-1690Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Although there is only about 50% amino acid sequence identity between these three growth factors, their three-dimensional structures share a common structural fold, the β-trefoil scaffold, and the three structures are nearly superimposable (12Zhu X. Komiya H. Chirino A. Faham S. Fox G.M. Arakawa T. Hsu B.T. Rees D.C. Science. 1991; 251: 90-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar, 13Osslund T.D. Syed R. Singer E. Hsu W.-J., E. Nybo R.

However, the three FGFs display distinct receptor binding characteristics suggesting that sequence differences between FGFs regulate receptor binding specificity. Earlier mutagenesis studies by Springer et al. (14Springer B.A. Pantoliano M.W. Barbera F.A. Gunyuzlu P.L. Thompson L.D. Herblin W.F. Rosenfeld S.A. Book G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26879-26884Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) identified two receptor-binding sites in FGF-2 that map onto diametrically opposite sides of the molecule. Based on their relative affinities for FGFR1, these sites were named high and low affinity sites. The high affinity site is comprised of a set of discontinuous residues that are clustered in a hydrophobic patch on the FGF-2 surface. These residues are highly conserved among FGFs and therefore unlikely to contribute to ligand binding specificity. The low affinity site resides within a loop that connects the ninth and tenth β-strands of FGF-2 (14Springer B.A. Pantoliano M.W. Barbera F.A. Gunyuzlu P.L. Thompson L.D. Herblin W.F. Rosenfeld S.A. Book G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26879-26884Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although the loop structure and its primary sequence vary among FGFs, β9-β10 loop exchange between FGF-2 and FGF-7 did not alter their known receptor binding specificities (15Sher I. Weizman A. Lubinsky-Mink S. Lang T. Adir N. Schomburg D. Ron D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35016-35022Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Other investigators have proposed that a segment in the carboxyl-terminal part of FGF-7 prevents this growth factor from binding to FGFR1. Replacement of this segment with the corresponding one in FGF-1 (termed the glycine box) conferred on FGF-7 the ability to bind FGFR1 (16Luo Y. Lu W. Mohamedali K.A. Jang J.H. Jones R.B. Gabriel J.L. Kan M. McKeehan W.L. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 16506-16515Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). However, acquisition of FGFR1 binding did not result in a concomitant loss of high affinity binding of FGF-7 to the KGFR which suggests that binding specificity is determined by more than one region of an FGF. The present work was aimed at identifying such determinants. Based on both loop exchange between FGF-2 and FGF-7 and site-directed mutagenesis in FGF-7, we found that the loop connecting the β4-β5 strands of FGF-7 participates in primary receptor binding and is critical for FGF-7/KGFR recognition. The results are discussed in light of the recently resolved crystal structure of FGF bound to FGFR (17Plotnikov A.N. Schlessinger J. Hubbard S.R. Mohammadi M.

These cell lines were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% FCS. NIH/3T3 or NIH/3T3 cells overexpressing KGFR (NIH/KR cells) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% newborn calf serum (22Miki T. Fleming T.P. Bottaro D.P. Rubin J.S. Ron D. Aaronson S.A. Science. 1991; 251: 72-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). Balb/MK cells were grown in low calcium media containing 5 ng/ml epidermal growth factor and 10% dialyzed FCS as described previously (23Weissman B.E. Aaronson S.A. Cell. 1983; 32: 599-606Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). The mutant FGF2-L4/7, in which the β4-β5 loop of FGF-2 was replaced with that of FGF-7, was created in two steps. First, two chimeric fragments were generated utilizing the polymerase chain reaction technique (24Saiki R.K. Scharf S. Faloona F. Mullis K.B. Horn G.T. Erlich H.A. Arnheim N. Science. 1985; 230: 1350-1354Crossref PubMed Scopus (6818) Google Scholar). Primers p1 and p2 were used to amplify the segment encoding FGF-2 residues 1–74, in which the codons encoding residues Gln65-Arg69 were replaced with the sequence encoding for the β4-β5 loop of FGF-7 (RTVAV). Primer p1 (GCGGATCCATGGCCGCCGGGAGCATCACC) is complementary to the NH2-terminal part of the FGF-2 gene product, and contains an artificial NcoI site 5′ to the initiation codon, which was employed in cloning. Primer p2 (CACAACCCCAACTGCCACTGTCCTAAGT) contains the sequence encoding the β4-β5 loop of FGF-7 (underlined) and flanking sequences from the FGF-2 gene. A second chimeric fragment encoding FGF-2 residues 61–155 was created using primers p3 and p4. Primer p3 (ATCAAGCTTCAACTTAGGACAGTGGCAGTTGGGGTTGTGTCTATCAAAGGA) contains the sequence for the loop of FGF-7 (underlined) and flanking sequences from the FGF-2 gene. Primer p4 (ATATAAGATCTATCAGCTCTTAGCAGACATT) is complementary to the COOH-terminal part of the FGF-2 gene product and contains an artificialBglII site 3′ to the stop codon for subsequent cloning. In a second step, the amplified products of the first step were annealed and amplified with primers p1 and p4. The fragment obtained was digested with NcoI and BglII and cloned into pKM260 (15Sher I. Weizman A. Lubinsky-Mink S. Lang T. Adir N. Schomburg D. Ron D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35016-35022Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). A synthetic gene of human FGF-7, encoding the mature FGF-7 polypeptide (residues Ala31 to Thr194) was utilized for mutational analysis of FGF-7. Silent mutations were introduced during the synthesis of this gene. These led to the elimination of an internalKpnI site and the insertion of 4 unique restriction sites (KpnI, SspI, SnaBI, andMscI) in positions that flank the regions encoding the β3-β4 and β4-β5 loops. The synthetic gene was cloned into the expression vector pKM260. For the replacement of the β3-β4 loop of FGF-7 with that of FGF-2, the FGF-7 plasmid was subjected toKpnI and SspI digestion, to remove the sequence encoding the loop. The digested plasmid was ligated to a double stranded DNA obtained by annealing two synthetic oligonucleotides: TCGCGAGAAGAGCGACCCACACAAT and ATTGTGTGGGTCGCTCTTCTCGCGAGTAC (the sequence encoding the β3-β4 loop of FGF-2 is underlined). Similarly, the β4-β5 loop of FGF-7 was replaced with the corresponding loop of FGF-2 following aMscI/SnaBI digestion of the FGF-7 plasmid and utilizing the following annealed synthetic oligonucleotides:AAGCAGAAGAGAGAGGAATTGTGG and CCACAATTCCTCTCTCTTCTGCTT (the sequence encoding the loop of FGF-2 is underlined). The same methodology was utilized to create the point mutations (except for R101A) utilizing the following oligonucleotide sets: T102A, GTGCAGTGGCAGTTGGAATTGTGG and CCACAATTCCAACTGCCACTGCAC; V103E, GCACAGAGGCAGTTGGAATTGTGG and CCACAATTCCAACTGCCTCTGTGC; V103A, GTACAGCGGCAGTTGGAATTGTTG and CAACAATTCCAACTGCCGCTGTAC; A104E, GCACAGTGGAAGTTGGAATTGTTG and CAACAATTCCAACTTCCACTGTGC; V105R, GTACAGTGGCACGTGGAATTGTTG and CAACAATTCCAC GTGCCACTGTAC; V105A, GCACAGTGGCAGCTGGAATTGTGG and CCACAATTCCAGCTGCCACTGTGC (the point mutations are underlined). The R101A mutant was generated in three steps. First, a mutated segment encoding for FGF-7 residues 31–108 was created using primer p1 (ATGGATCCATGGCTTGCAATGACATGACTCCA) that is complementary to the NH2-terminal part of the FGF-7 gene product, and contains artificial NcoI site 5′ to the start codon, and primer p2 (CCACAATTCCAACTGCCACTGTAGCTATCTCCATAAT) that contains the point mutation (underlined). A second mutated fragment, encoding for FGF-7 residues 97–194 was created using primers p3 (ATTATGGAGATAGCTACAGTGGCAGTTGGAATTGTGG) that contains the point mutation (underlined) and primer p4 (TTGGATCCATTAAGTTATTGCCATAGGAAG) that is complementary to the COOH-terminal part of the FGF-7 gene product. Then the amplified products of the first step were annealed and amplified with primers p1 and p4. The fragment obtained was cut with NcoI andEcoRI and cloned into the FGF-7 plasmid that was digested with the same enzymes. All the mutated genes were sequenced to confirm that the desired mutation had been introduced and that additional mutations had not been created during the amplification process. All the FGFs used in this study were expressed as His-tagged products in E. coli as previously reported (15Sher I. Weizman A. Lubinsky-Mink S. Lang T. Adir N. Schomburg D. Ron D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35016-35022Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). FGF-7 and all the FGF-7 mutants were expressed in BL21(DE3) plys S cells (25Studier F.W.

This enzyme increases the solubility of eukaryotic proteins in E. coli, thus increasing the protein yield. Purification of the recombinant proteins was carried out by Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity chromatography followed by heparin-Sepharose affinity chromatography as described previously (15Sher I.

All mutant proteins eluted from the column at the same salt concentration as the parental molecules (0.5 m NaCl for the FGF-7 mutants, 1.5 m NaCl for the FGF-2 mutants).

Previous studies in which large segments were exchanged between FGF-2 and FGF-7 suggested that a region in the middle part of FGF-7 (residues 91–110) may be important for FGF-7/KGFR recognition (19Reich-Slotky R.

Theoretical, homology based model of the three-dimensional structure of FGF-7 (15Sher I. Weizman A. Lubinsky-Mink S. Lang T. Adir N. Schomburg D. Ron D. J. Biol.

In order to test the contributions of these solvent exposed loops for the specific interaction of FGF-7/KGFR, we first performed loop exchanges between FGF-7 and FGF-2 and examined the effect of each replacement on the unique receptor binding characteristics and biological activity of each growth factor. The 155-amino acid form of FGF-2 and the mature FGF-7 polypeptide (residues 31–194) fused to a hexa-histidine tag were employed in this study. As previously reported, the biological properties of the His-tagged products are identical to those of the parental molecules lacking the tag (15Sher I. Weizman A. Lubinsky-Mink S. Lang T. Adir N.

The generation, expression, and purification of the parental and mutant proteins are described under “Experimental Procedures.” All mutants retained wild type affinity for heparin (data not shown). Binding competition and [3H]thymidine incorporation were utilized to assess the biological properties of the mutants. The binding experiments were performed in L6E9 cells that were engineered to individually express KGFR (L6/KR cells) or FGFR1 (L6/RI cells), the high affinity receptors of FGF-7 and FGF-2, respectively (21Ron D.

FGF-7 is highly mitogenic to Balb/MK cells but does not stimulate a mitogenic response in NIH/3T3 cells, whereas FGF-2 is highly mitogenic to NIH/3T3 cells but is a poor mitogen for keratinocytes (19Reich-Slotky R.

The mutant FGF7-L3/2 in which amino acids 89–95 (Gln-Glu-Met-Lys-Asn-Asn-Tyr) from the β3-β4 loop of FGF-7 have been replaced with the corresponding residues of FGF-2 (amino acids Arg53-Glu-Lys-Ser-Asp-Pro-His59) displayed receptor binding properties and mitogenic activity that were indistinguishable from those of FGF-7 (data not shown and Fig.1). These results suggest that the β3-β4 loop does not contribute to the specific interaction between FGF-7 and the KGFR and this mutant was not studied further. In contrast to the results observed with the mutant FGF7-L3/2, replacement of the loop connecting the β4-β5 strands of FGF-7 (amino acids Arg101-Thr-Val-Ala-Val105) with that of FGF-2 (amino acids Gln65-Ala-Glu-Glu-Arg69) resulted in a dramatic reduction in the binding affinity to KGFR. Half-maximal competition for125I-FGF-7 binding was observed at about 20 and 2500 ng/ml FGF-7 and the FGF7-L4/2 mutant, respectively (Fig.2 A). Similar results were obtained using a cell-free binding assay with a soluble extracellular domain of KGFR (data not shown).
