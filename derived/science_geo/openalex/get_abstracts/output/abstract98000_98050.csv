https://openalex.org/W1544665815,"The interaction of Factor Xa and Factor Va at the platelet surface was investigated by direct, simultaneous binding measurements of both proteins to platelets and by immunochemical and kinetic techniques. Binding measurements of 125I-Factor Xa and 131I-Factor Va to unstimulated platelets indicate that the amount of Factor Xa bound is proportional to the amount of Factor Va bound. At saturating concentrations of Factor Xa, the ratio of platelet-bound Factor Xa to platelet-bound Factor Va was unity. At saturating levels of Factor Va (1.2 X 10(-8) M), 2300 molecules of Factor Xa are bound to the platelet, whereas at an equivalent concentration of unactivated Factor V, only 800 molecules of Factor Xa are bound. In the absence of exogenous Factor V or Va, thrombin-treated washed platelets bound only 200 Factor Xa molecules per platelet, suggesting that under these conditions, platelet Factor Va is the limiting component. Monovalent Fab fragments of burro antibovine Factor V inhibit, to the same degree, the rate of thrombin generation and the binding of Factor Va and Factor Xa to the platelet surface. Anti-Factor V Fab decreased the extent of Factor Va and Factor Xa binding equivalently. When the interaction of Factor Xa with platelets is modeled as Factor Xa binding to platelet-bound Factor Va, double reciprocal plots are linear, yielding a stoichiometry of 1.04 and a dissociation constant of 6 X 10(-10) M. Kinetic experiments indicate the presence of approximately 900 functional Factor Va platelet sites (Kd = 1.5 to 2.2 X 10(-10) M). This number of functional sites is equivalent to the number (837 +/- 48) of Factor Va high affinity binding sites (Kd = 4.0 X 10(-10) M). These sites most likely represent the Factor Xa binding sites involved in the function of the prothrombinase complex at the platelet surface."
https://openalex.org/W1537487587,"The turnover of troponin-T, troponin-I, and troponin-C, under conditions closely approximating a steady state, has been determined from the rate of incorporation of L-[4,5-3H]leucine into the polypeptides. Isotope was administered to rats by constant infusion for a period of 4 h and the rate of equilibration of radioactive leucine in the serum was determined. The specific radioactivity of leucine was measured in both the protein and the precursor pools. Troponin subunits were separated from other proteins by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The turnover rates of other myofibrillar proteins, tropomyosin, actin, and myosin heavy and light chains, were also measured. Troponin-T and troponin-I had similar half-lives of 3.5 and 3.2 days, respectively, which were significantly different from that of troponin-C (5.3 days). The rates of turnover of troponin-T and troponin-I were greater than those of myosin heavy chain, but the turnover of troponin-C was not significantly different from that of myosin heavy chain. These findings indicate that the subunits of cardiac troponin turn over nonuniformly. In addition, evidence from kinetic experiments indicates the presence of a precursor pool of unassembled troponin-I but not for troponin-T or troponin-C."

Aerobic incubation of [3H]squalene 2,3(S);22(S),23-dioxide with S10 rat liver homogenate affords 24(S),25-epoxycholesterol with an efficiency comparable to that of the formation of cholesterol from squalene 2,3(S)-oxide. The product 24(S),25-epoxy-[3H]cholesterol was identified by reduction to 25-hydroxyl[3H]cholesterol and by benzoylation to 24(S),-25-epoxy[3H]cholesterol benzoate. Both the 25-hydroxy[3H]cholesterol and 24 (S),25-epoxy[3H]cholesterol benzoate were isotopically diluted and recrystallized to constant specific activity. Incubation of either [3H]squalene 2,3(S);22(S),23-dioxide or 24(S),25-epoxy[3H]cholesterol with S10 rat liver homogenate failed to produce any detectable 25-hydroxy[3H]cholesterol."
https://openalex.org/W1543741367,"A series of 10 beta-propynyl-substituted steroids are reported as mechanism-based enzyme-activated irreversible inhibitors of the human placental aromatase which converts 4-androstene-3,17-dione to 1,3,5(10-estratrien-3-ol-17-one. Thus 10-propargylestr-4-ene-3,17-dione binds to the enzyme with an apparent Ki of 23 nM and causes time-dependent inactivation (pseudo-first order kinact = 1.11 X 10(-3) s-1). The 10-[(1S)-1-hydroxy-3-propynyl]estr-4-ene-3,17-dione analog of the known enzyme-generated intermediate, 4-androsten-19-ol-3,17-dione, behaved similarly and had an apparent Ki of 27 microM and a psuedo-first order kinact of 2.91 X 10(-3) s-1. The stereoisomeric 10-[(1R)-1-hydroxy-2-propynyl]estr-4-ene-3,17-dione did not cause time-dependent inactivation, but bound in a competitive manner with an apparent Ki of 2.5 microM. Finally, 10-(1-oxo-2-propynyl)-estr-4-ene-3,17-dione, the proposed enzyme-generated affinity label and analog of the second intermediate (3,17-dioxoandrost-4-en-19-al) in the enzymatic reaction, bound to the enzyme with an apparent Ki of 12 microM and caused time-dependent inactivation with a pseudo-first order kinact of 5.35 X 10(-4) s-1."
https://openalex.org/W1571114305,"Monoclonal antibodies that react with antigens of the plasma membrane have been prepared by fusion of mouse myeloma cells and spleen cells of rats immunized with NIH/3T3 cells or plasma membranes. The antigenic targets of these antibodies included three major cell membrane proteins of 100, 90, and 80 kilodaltons. Proteins of 220, 71, and 55 kilodaltons were also specifically immunoprecipitated. Characterization of the antigens by treatment with proteases, heat, and acetone extraction provided additional evidence that the reactive molecules were proteins. The 90- and 80-kilodalton proteins were preferred targets in this experimental system; of 13 independent monoclonal antibodies which were characterized, four reacted with the 90,000-dalton protein and two with the 80,000-dalton protein. The expression of these antigens in different types of cells was tested with a panel of murine cell lines. The 220- and 90-kilodalton proteins were present on 18 lines of diverse tissue and strain origin and may be structural components common to plasma membranes of many cell types. The other protein antigens were reduced or modified on many cells other than the fibroblast, indicating that the expression of these antigenic determinants was differentiation specific. The antigenic determinants of the 80,000-dalton protein were absent in cells of several murine inbred strains, suggesting that this protein was expressed by a polymorphic gene(s)."
https://openalex.org/W1509979763,"The level of phosphatidylinositol (PI) in human platelets falls abruptly when they are stimulated with thrombin and then returns to baseline within 15 min. PI is enriched in arachidonate and our recently proposed pathway for arachidonate release (Bell, R. L., Kennerly, D. A., Stanford, N., and Majerus, P. W. (1979) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 76, 3238-3241) provides a link between the unique fatty acid composition of PI and the increased turnover of PI seen in many secretory tissues when they are stimulated. We measured the fatty acid composition of PI at time points following stimulation with thrombin as a means of defining the route of PI resynthesis which occurs, and the mechanism for the arachidonate enrichment. In resting platelets, the fatty acid content (per cent of total fatty acid contributed by each) of PI is: palmitate, 5.1; stearate, 39.9; oleate, 8.6; linoleate, 5.6; and arachidonate, 40.8. At 30 s after thrombin treatment, when the mass of PI has fallen from 18.7 +/- 2.3 to 12.5 +/- 2.4 nmol/10(9) platelets, there are no significant changes in per cent fatty acid composition. However, at 8 min, when PI has returned to 16.8 +/- 2.9 nmol/10(9), the per cent fatty acid composition is: palmitate, 7.8 (p > 0.05); stearate, 34.0 (p < 0.005); oleate, 10.7 (p < 0.05); linoleate, 16.1 (p < 0.001); and arachidonate, 31.3 (p < 0.05). The altered fatty acid composition excludes the Pi as the mechanism for resynthesis as it would result in an unchanged pattern. The evidence suggests that PI is synthesized without a specific fatty acid composition, and then undergoes a deacylation-reacylation cycle to result in the unique 1-stearyl-2-arachidonyl pattern."
https://openalex.org/W1518889327,"The cytotoxin ricin is a heterodimer composed of an A chain which enzymatically inhibits protein synthesis on eukaryotic ribosomes and a lectin B chain which binds to cell surfaces and triggers uptake of the toxin. A low resolution (4 A) x-ray structure revealed that the B chain is a bilobal structure and that each domain binds a galactose sugar. These apparent structural similarities suggested that the protein might have internal symmetry and might have arisen by gene duplication. A subsequent search of the amino acid sequence provided strong evidence for homology between th NH2- and COOH-terminal halves of the B chain and suggested that they may have arisen from a common ancestor. There is no strong relationship between the halves of the A chain and little, if any, significant sequence homology between the A and B chains of ricin."

https://openalex.org/W1552550822,"A highly purified cytochrome P-450 has been isolated from beta-naphthoflavone-pretreated rat liver microsomes with a 9% recovery. The cytochrome has an absorbance maximum in the carbon monoxide-reduced difference spectrum at 446 nm and is designated cytochrome P-446. Cytochrome P-446, as isolated, appears to have low spin ferric iron and has a specific content of 18.1 nmol/mg of protein. Cytochrome P-446 migrates as a single band of molecular weight 53,400 in sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gels. This value is in good agreement with the results of sedimentation equilibrium determinations (55,000). The amino acid composition of cytochrome P-446 indicates that the protein contains 35% hydrophobic residues. The amino acid composition, in general, resembles that of most other cytochromes P-450. Cytochrome P-446 has a turnover number for benzo[alpha]pyrene of 53 nmol/min/nmol of cytochrome P-446. In addition, cytochrome P-446 actively hydroxylates benzphetamine, ethylmorphine, p-nitroanisole, p-nitrophenetole, and 7-ethoxycoumarin at varying rates."
https://openalex.org/W1510399969,"Fragments of muscle alpha-tropomyosin have been prepared by limited and prolonged tryptic digestion, by limited chymotryptic digestion, and by chemical cleavage procedures at the methionine and single cysteine residues. Procedures are described for their isolation in a homogeneous form and for their identification by amino acid, NH2-terminal, and COOH-terminal analyses. The initial site of tryptic cleavage was at Arg-133, close to Asp-137, the only such acidic residue to occur in a core a or d position of the coiled-coil structure. Chymotrypsin cleaved initially at Leu-169. Both sites of initial cleavage are close to minima in the averaged alpha-helical periodicity previously reported. Trypsin-resistant fragments were isolated corresponding to residues 13-125 and 183-284, indicating that the NH2-terminal region (1-13) and central region (126-183) are more susceptible to proteolytic degradation. Comparison of the thermal stabilities of the fragments showed that all fragments from the COOH-terminal half of the molecule were less stable than those from the NH2-terminal half. These stability differences could be related to differences in the averaged alpha-helical potentials of the fragments estimated from their amino acid compositions. It is suggested that these differences in stability properties reflect considerable variation in the nature and affinity of the actin-binding sites as well as an imposition on the COOH-terminal half of the molecule of structural requirements for the binding of troponin."
https://openalex.org/W1501428107,"We have studied the membrane topography of N-acetylneuraminic acid (NeuAc) in sialoglycoproteins of mouse and rat liver Golgi apparatus vesicles. Purified Golgi vesicles or Golgi vesicles present in microsomes were able to incorporate radiolabeled NeuAc from CMP-NeuAc into endogenous glycoproteins in vitro. The labeled glycoproteins showed a similar profile on sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis to those isolated from Golgi fractions of animals injected with radiolabeled NeuAc. Using this labeling procedure in vitro, we found that only 5 to 20% of the incorporated NeuAc could be removed from intact vesicles upon treatment with neuraminidase or proteases. However, disruption of vesicles by detergents or mechanical means prior to the enzymatic treatments resulted in removal of labeled NeuAc; the extent of NeuAc removal could be correlated with that of vesicle disruption as measured by loss of latency of thiamine pyrophosphatase activity. This strongly suggests that NeuAc residues of glycoproteins are on the lumenal side of the Golgi apparatus membrane and that Golgi-derived vesicles have the same membrane orientation as in vivo. A similar approach was used to infer a lumenal orientation of sialyltransferases. Not all Golgi apparatus preparations routinely used may be suitable for membrane topography experiments of the kind described here."
https://openalex.org/W1607871381,"Although glucocorticoids are not cytolytic for and do not inhibit the growth of the IM-9 line of cultured human lymphoblasts, these cells have a high steroid-binding capacity. We have used IM-9 cells in order to examine whether unoccupied glucocorticoid receptors are inactivated and activated in intact cells. when IM-9 cells are incubated in glucose-free medium in a nitrogen atmosphere, both their ability to bind triamcinolone acetonide and their ATP levels decline and, when glucose and oxygen are reintroduced, ATP levels and receptor activity return. The specific glucocorticoid-binding activity of cytosol prepared from cells exposed to various degrees of energy limitation is directly correlated with the ATP content. Receptor activation in intact cells is rapid and independent of protein synthesis. Cytosol prepared from inactivated cells cannot be activated by addition of ATP. The inactivation of glucocorticoid receptors that occurs when cytosol from normal IM-9 cells is incubated at 25 degrees C is inhibited by molybdate, vanadate, fluoride, ATP, and several other nucleotides. The experiments with intact human lymphoblasts suggest that assays of specific glucocorticoid-binding capacity do not necessarily reflect the cellular content of receptor protein."
https://openalex.org/W1579098776,"ATP-dependent Ca2+ uptake by rabbit skeletal muscle sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles has been studied in the presence and absence of artificially generated pH gradients and membrane potentials. H+ and K+ diffusion potentials were generated via the H+ and K,Na channels of sarcoplasmic reticulum by transfer of vesicles from low to high pH, or from high to low K+. Membrane potentials were measured using the voltage-sensitive fluorescent dye 3,3‘-dipentyl-2,2‘-oxacarbocyanine. The initial rate of Ca2+ uptake was found to be increased in the presence of a pH gradient and membrane potential (negative inside). In turn, the rates of decay of K+- or H+-induced membrane potentials were accelerated during Ca2+ transport, suggesting that active Ca2+ uptake stimulated the release of K+ and H+ from the vesicles. The ratio of K+ (or H+) release to Ca2+ transport was near two. Release of K+ did not appear to be directly catalyzed by the Ca2+-ATPase. Evidence against a directly coupled ATP-mediated 2 K+-Ca2+ or K+-Ca2+ exchange reaction was that (i) similar results were obtained when K+ was substituted by Na+ or by organic cations which could rapidly permeate through the channel of K+,Na+-permeable vesicles and (ii) Ca2+ transport did not result in an equivalent release of 86Rb+ or 22Na+ from K+,Na+-impermeable vesicles. These studies are in support of an electrogenic Ca2+ transport system in sarcoplasmic reticulum. The results further suggest that during Ca2+ transport development of a membrane potential (positive inside) is likely nullified by the countermovement of the permeant cations K+, Na+, and H+."
https://openalex.org/W1510486443,"The heavy chains of Acanthamoeba myosins. IA, IB and II, turkey gizzard myosin, and rabbit skeletal muscle myosin subfragment-1 were specifically labeled by radioactive ATP, ADP, and UTP, each of which is a substrate or product of myosin ATPase activity, when irradiated with UV light at 0 degrees C. With UTP, as much as 0.45 mol/mol of Acanthamoeba myosin IA heavy chain and 1 mol/mol of turkey gizzard myosin heavy chain was incorporated. Evidence that the ligands were associated with the catalytic site included the observations that reaction occurred only with nucleotides that are substrates or products of the ATPase activity; that the reaction was blocked by pyrophosphate which is an inhibitor of the ATPase activity; that ATP was bound as ADP; and that label was probably restricted to a single peptide following limited subtilisin proteolysis of labeled Acanthamoeba myosin IA heavy chain and extensive cleavage with CNBr and trypsin of labeled turkey gizzard myosin heavy chain."
https://openalex.org/W1564854360,"A homogeneous 4-aminobutyrate aminotransferase isolated from pig brain exhibits a kcat = 9.6 s-1 and contains only 1 mol of pyridoxal-5-P/mol of dimer. The equilibrium dissociation constant for pyridoxal-5-P tightly bound to the enzyme is 1 nM. Spectrophotometric titrations reveal that the enzyme binds a second molecule of pyridoxal-5-P with a KD = 3 microM. The reaction of enzyme containing 1 pyridoxal-5-P/dimer with the inhibitors NaBH4 and DL-gabaculine was studied by observing changes in the absorption spectrum of the bound coenzyme and by monitoring loss of catalytic activity. The native enzyme is inactivated by both inhibitors. Incubation of the resultant P-pyridoxyl aminotransferase and m-anthraniyl-PMP-aminotransferase with excess pyridoxal-5-P at 25 degrees C restores full catalytic activity. It is postulated that the dimeric enzyme contains two classes of catalytic binding sites, and that the binding site characterized by a weak affinity for pyridoxal-5-P (KD = 3 microM) becomes functional after specific chemical modification of the molecule of cofactor tightly bound to the protein (KD - 1 nM)."
https://openalex.org/W1606098532,"The interactions of a variety of large fragments of rabbit skeletal muscle alpha-tropomyosin, prepared as previously described, with troponin-T and a soluble tropomyosin-binding fragment of troponin-T (CB1) have been investigated by affinity chromatography and gel filtration. No specific interactions between NH2-terminal fragments encompassing residues 1-189 with troponin, troponin-T, or CB1 immobilized on a Sephadex 4B column could be demonstrated. Similarly, there was no interaction between these fragments and CB1 on a gel filtration column operated in 0.1 M KCl, 10 mM imidazole pH 7.0 buffer. On the other hand, all fragments encompassing residues 190-284 showed interaction with troponin-T on the affinity column and with CB1 by gel filtration. When mixtures of two fragments, one of which had the intact NH2-terminal sequence of the original tropomyosin structure and the other the intact COOH-terminal sequence, were applied to the gel filtration column, there was no indication of interaction between them. However, when CB1 was included in the mixture, a ternary complex of the three components was demonstrable. Fragments in which 10 or 12 residues at the NH2-terminal end of the alpha-tropomyosin sequence were absent showed no evidence of forming a ternary complex with CB1 and the COOH-terminal fragments. We conclude that the binding of the troponin-T fragment, CB1, to the COOH-terminal third of the alpha-tropomyosin molecule enhances head-to-tail aggregation of tropomyosin molecules either indirectly by the transmission of conformational changes to the head-to-tail overlap region or more directly by binding close to or at this region."
https://openalex.org/W1480325895,"The formation of Compounds I, II, and III of hog thyroid peroxidase was demonstrated in its reaction with H2O2 by spectrophotometric and kinetic methods combined with a stopped flow technique. Hog thyroid peroxidase reacted with H2O2 to form Compound I with a rate constant of 5.2 X 10(6) M-1 s-1. Compound I was then spontaneously converted to Compound II with a rate constant of 8 s-1. In the presence of 200 microM H2O2, Compound II ws further converted to Compound III (or oxyform) with a half-life of 0.8 s. During the peroxidative oxidation of tyrosine, thyroid peroxidase was present as Compound I, and the rate constant for the reaction of Compound I with tyrosine was measured at 1.4 X 10(4) M-1 s-1. The addition of iodide to the above reaction system markedly decreased the steady state concentration of Compound I. From the kinetic data, it was concluded that the reaction between Compound I and iodide occurred by way of a 2-electron transfer and the rate constant was roughly estimated at 2.1 X 10(7) M-1 s-1. This value was much higher than that obtained from overall kinetic data. Similar reactions were carried out with bovine lactoperoxidase and the kinetic data for the two enzymes were compared. The primary oxidation product of iodide was suggested to be iodinium cation (I+) in either enzyme reaction."
https://openalex.org/W1517532198,"Light increases the affinity of chloroplast membrane-bound ferredoxin-NADP+ oxidoreductase for its physiological substrates in NADP+ photoreduction, that is, NADP+ and ferredoxin. Light may cause this effect through a conformational change of the enzyme related to the formation of a light-driven delta pH since the effect is prevented by uncouplers. Although the external pH does influence the extent of photoreduction of NADP+ in saturating light, it does not significantly influence the extent of the energy-driven change in affinity of the enzyme for its substrates."
https://openalex.org/W1559926276,"The de novo biosynthesis of the heterotetrameric (alpha 2 beta 2) serum glycoprotein, haptoglobin, was studied using a rabbit reticulocyte cell-free translation system and mRNA preparations from the livers of turpentine-treated rats. Analysis of the translation mixtures with either antisera specific for the alpha-subunit (anti-alpha-IgG) or the beta-subunit (anti-beta-IgG) or the native haptoglobin tetramer (anti-alpha 2 beta 2-IgG) resulted in each instance in the recovery of a single protein exhibiting a Mr = approximately 38,000. Cleavage of the translation product with cyanogen bromide or trypsin resulted in the generation of small peptide fragments that were specifically immunoadsorbed with either anti-alpha-IgG or anti-beta-IgG. These results indicated that the primary translation product of haptoglobin mRNA is a single polypeptide that contains the elements of both the alpha-subunit and the beta-subunit of the protein. Presumably haptoglobin is synthesized in vitro as a single precursor protein that is proteolytically processed post-translationally to form the dissimilar alpha- and beta-subunits of the native protein."
https://openalex.org/W1584439305,"The rates of protein and lipid synthesis of Mycoplasma capricolum were essentially synchronous during growth and depended on the sterol supplement in the media increasing in the order cholesterol (0.5 microgram/ml) < lanosterol (10 microgram/ml) < lanosterol (10 microgram/ml) + cholesterol (0.5 microgram/ml) < cholesterol (10 microgram/ml). The effect of lanosterol plus low cholesterol on macromolecular synthesis was synergistic. Whereas protein and lipid synthesis were brought virtually to a halt by cholesterol starvation, DNA synthesis continued for about 8 h. Increasing the palmitate and elaidate concentrations 4-fold in the lanosterol-supplemented media raised the growth rate even in the absence of the small amount of cholesterol (0.5 microgram/ml) needed otherwise for the synergistic effect on growth. Studies of the kinetics of fatty acid uptake by resting cells showed that the apparent Km (17 microM) of oleate uptake in lanosterol-grown cells was specifically lowered to 3 microM, a value equal to that seen in cholesterol-grown cells, by the inclusion of a synergistic amount of cholesterol in the growth media. By contrast, the apparent Km for palmitate uptake was the same (2 microM) for all three cell types. The results are consistent with the membrane cholesterol serving in a dual role, one as a bulk component and another more specific function involving the regulation of unsaturated fatty acid uptake and thereby phospholipid biosynthesis."

https://openalex.org/W1535160845,"Treatment of normal human cells with DNA-damaging agents such as UV light or N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG) stimulates the conversion of NAD to the chromosomal polymer poly(ADP-ribose) which in turn results in a rapid depletion of the cellular NAD pool. We have studied the effect of UV light or MNNG on the NAD pools of seven cell lines of human fibroblasts either homozygous or heterozygous for the xeroderma pigmentosum genotype. Xeroderma pigmentosum cells of genetic complementation groups A, C, and D are deficient in the excision repair of DNA damage caused by UV light. Following UV treatment, the NAD content of these cells was unchanged (complementation groups A and D) or only slightly reduced (complementation group C). Xeroderma pigmentosum cells with the variant genotype have normal excision repair and UV treatment caused a large reduction in the size of the NAD pool. Cell lines derived from asymptomatic, parental heterozygotes of xeroderma pigmentosum complementation groups A and D showed an amount of lowering of NAD following UV treatment that was approximately one-half that of the control cell line. All of the cell lines are able to excise DNA damage caused by MNNG and all of the cell lines had a greatly reduced content of NAD following MNNG treatment. The results demonstrate a close relationship between the conversion of NAD to poly(ADP-ribose) and DNA excision repair in human cells."
https://openalex.org/W1482522578,"Front face fluorometry allows for the detection of intrinsic fluorescence in intact hemoglobins, and we have been able to assign the origin of this emission in Hb A to the tryptophan at beta 37 (Hirsch, R. E., Zukin, R. S., and Nagel, R. L. (1980) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 93, 432-439). We now report that this fluorescence in hemoglobin is sensitive to the R leads to T conformational transition. Comparison between liganded states of Hb A suggest a difference in the R structures of HbCO and HbO2. The T state induced by inositol hexaphosphate in the presence of methemoglobin A appears to be different from the T state of deoxyHb A. In agreement with chemical data our fluorescence studies of Hb H indicate that no R to T transition occurs in this hemoglobin, secondary to ligand binding. A slight conformational difference exists between deoxyHbH and COHbH. Hb Beth Israel, a low oxygen affinity mutant, shows unique fluorescence properties suggesting significant differences between the R and T forms relative to those of Hb A."

Specific activity of this abundant material was increased about 70-fold with about 28% recovery of activity. The purified lectin, which behaved as a large aggregate, could be dissociated into two proteins with apparent molecular weights of 13,000 and 16,000 upon electrophoresis in sodium dodecyl sulfate. 125I-tryptic peptide maps of these proteins showed that they were distinct from each other and also from lectins of similar molecular weight previously purified from chicken. Agglutination activity of the lectin, tested with specially prepared rabbit erythrocytes, was very sensitive to heparin which inhibited 50% at concentrations of approximately 10(-5) mM. Dermatan sulfate and heparan sulfate were also potent inhibitors, whereas other glycosaminoglycans were not. The most potent monosaccharide hapten inhibitor was N-acetyl-D-galactosamine. Because of its properties, we operationally refer to this material as chicken heparin-lectin, recognizing that this does not necessarily indicate that it functionally interacts with heparin in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1517811964,"Eukaryotic initiation factors 2, 3, and 5 (eIF-2, eIF-3, and eIF-5) each were purified or fractionated into a number of forms which differ in protein mass or composition. The various factor polypeptides were analyzed by partial protease digestion and the fragmentation patterns were compared to identify proteins related in primary structure. The digestion method was made more sensitive by prior radiochemical labeling of the proteins by iodination with 125I. At least four molecular weight forms of eIF-5 were found which ranged from 168,000 to 128,000. The lower molecular weight forms, nevertheless, were biologically active in in vitro assays. Analysis of a variety of eIF-3 preparations indicates that the presence or abundance of especially the higher molecular weight subunits varies considerably. Many of these components are related to one another in primary structure; five of the subunits greater than Mr = 90,000 appear to be derived from the 210 kilodalton subunit by limited proteolysis. Analysis of eIF-2 polypeptides shows that the alpha, beta, and gamma subunits give distinctively different partial protease digestion patterns and that some preparations contain a minor component (gamma') related to the gamma subunit which could be misidentified as the beta subunit. The results indicate that initiation factors may be cleaved into different active forms by proteases acting either in the intact cell or during the factor isolation and purification. Addition of the protease inhibitor, phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, prevents some, but not all of the proteolysis."

The other fraction apparently contains the 89-residue species, in addition to a 90-residue form of the protein with the NH2-terminal sequence Met-Val. The sequence of 47 residues from the NH2 terminus of the 89-residue protein was established by automated Edman degradation. HTa is characterized by the following properties: 22% of its residues are lysine and arginine; the lysine:arginine ratio is 2.33; the absorption spectrum of the protein is distinctive due to the lack of tryptophan and the presence of 1 tyrosine and 5 phenylalanine residues; and the protein stabilizes DNA against thermal denaturation (Stein, D. B., and Searcy, D. G. (1978) Science 202, 219-221) and condenses DNA into spherical particles. All of these characteristics indicate that HTa resembles eukaryotic histones, but there are distinctive differences."

This specific inhibition was found with all cyanine dyes tested, but, with the possible exception of pyronin B, was not observed with other cationic dyes such as safranine O, rhodamine dyes, or with simple derivatives of the quinaldinium ring structure. The inhibition was observed to be both time- and concentration-dependent, with the half-time for full inhibition determined to be on the order of 15 to 30 s at 25 degrees C. Furthermore, the inhibition was totally dependent on the energization of the mitochondrial membrane by either substrate oxidation or the presence of ATP. The explanation of the energy dependence of the inhibition by cyanine dyes as the simple requirement for energy-linked dye concentration within the mitochondria is not supported by the relatively slow onset of inhibition as compared with the very rapid rate of dye uptake observed. Furthermore, inhibition of energy-requiring, succinate-linked NAD reduction in submitochondrial particles was observed to be inhibited by dyes, while fumarate reduction by NADH was found to be inhibited significantly only in the presence of ATP in addition to the dye. The energy requirement for electron transport inhibition in submitochondrial particles indicates that energy-dependent accumulation of the dyes by mitochondria cannot alone explain the energy requirement for the cyanine dye inhibition of NADH oxidation."
https://openalex.org/W1507494560,"Histidine decarboxylase from Lactobacillus 30a has been crystallized in a variety of forms which together indicate a revised subunit structure for the native particle. Octahedral crystals of the wild type enzyme obtained at room temperature from ammonium sulfate solutions in microdiffusion cells belong to tetragonal space group I4122 with a = b = 222 A and c = 107.5 A. Trigonal and hexagonal plates of prohistidine decarboxylase and activated proenzyme obtained at 4 degrees C from polyethyleneglycol solutions by vapor equilibration using the hanging drop technique belong to the trigonal space group P321 with a = b = 100 A and c = 164 A. The space group symmetries and unit cell contents of these crystals indicate 32 point group symmetry for the subunit structure of these enzymes. Sedimentation coefficients of wild type enzyme measured as a function of ionic strength at pH 7.0 indicate a rapid equilibrium between species varying from 6.9 S to 9.4 S. Sedimentation equilibrium analysis demonstrated the existence of a nearly homogeneous particle with Mr congruent to 208,000 at ionic strengths above I = 0.20, while an additional species of approximately one-half that molecular weight is observed at very ionic strengths (I = 0.2). At the pH optimum of the enzyme (pH 4.8), te larger species is dominant at all ionic strengths tested. Electron micrographs of native wild type enzyme show a dominant tetrahedral particle approximately 60 A on an edge while similar micrographs of enzyme cross-linked with glutaraldehyde show a dumbbell-shaped particle approximately 60 A in width and 120 A in length. These results establish that: (a) the native enzyme has a Mr congruent to 208,000 and a subunit composition (alpha beta)6; (b) the proenzyme has a subunit composition (pi)6; and (c) stable (alpha beta)3 and (pi) 3 particles exist under certain conditions."
https://openalex.org/W1578848771,"Cells grown from human articular cartilage by an explant method were shown to be dedifferentiated chondrocytes by the failure to respond to treatment with 5-bromodeoxyuridine, vitamin A, or the addition of hyaluronic acid. The major glycosaminoglycan produced by these cells was high molecular weight hyaluronic acid. The majority of the 35S-sulfated glycosaminoglycan was copolymeric chondroitin sulfate-dermatan sulfate (Mr = 2 to 2.4 X 10(4). The dermatan sulfate was present as the 4-sulfated isomer. Labeled proteoglycans were isolated from the growth media by centrifugation in either associative or dissociative cesium chloride density gradients in the presence of protease inhibitors or by precipitation with cetylpyridinium chloride and column chromatography on Sepharose CL-2B. The proteoglycans secreted into the medium by these dedifferentiated chondrocytes were large molecular weight proteoglycans (Kav = 0.23 on Sepharose CL-2B) that were able to form specific complexes with hyaluronic acid. The material isolated by the cetylpyridinium chloride precipitation was an aggregated proteoglycan (78% aggregate) that was not displaced by exogenous proteoglycan which after reduction and alkylation gave a large proteoglycan monomer (Kav = 0.23 on Sepharose CL-2B). These findings are in direct contrast to the report of small molecular proteoglycans isolated from cultures of dedifferentiated chrondrocytes obtained from other species."

https://openalex.org/W1495965179,"Rat plasma contains monoglyceride hydrolase activities against both 1(3)- and 2-monoglycerides. These activities are present as lipoprotein complexes recovered by either density flotation or by agarose gel chromatography with plasma high density lipoprotein. However neither activity is complexed with the major apoproteins (apo-A-I, apo-E) of this lipoprotein class. 2-Monoglyceride hydrolase (but not 1(3)-monoglyceride hydrolase) activity associates with the triglyceride-rich lipoprotein class. The two activities are also noncompetitive with respect to substrate, and differ in pH- and cofactor-dependence and sensitivity to inhibition by diethyl p-nitrophenyl phosphate. Rat platelets also contain both 1(3)- and 2-monoglyceride hydrolase activities. These differ in reactivity with antiesterase and after solubilization and electrophoretic migration with each other and with the corresponding plasma activities. Studies with the isolated perfused rat heart suggest that a major role in the catabolism of 2-monoglyceride generated from lipoprotein lipase activity at the coronary bed is played by the plasma 2-monoglyceride hydrolase activity."
https://openalex.org/W1523079133,"The TPN-linked isocitrate dehydrogenase from pig heart has been purified to homogeneity using blue Sepharose CL-6B as the only column chromatographic step and subsequently crystallized. Molecular sieve chromatography and analytical ultracentrifugation showed that the enzyme dimerizes in response to magnesium DL-isocitrate. TPNH or EDTA also brought about this effect, whereas TPN+ did not. The molecular weight of the monomer was 60,000 +/- 2,500 with an s20,w of 4.8 +/- 0.1 and a Stokes radius of 29 A. The molecular weight of the dimer was 115,000 +/- 5,000 with an s20,w of 6.7 +/- 0.2 and a Stokes radius of 39 A. Active enzyme centrifugation showed that the dimer was the active species in the oxidative decarboxylation of isocitrate."
https://openalex.org/W1624014961,"The direct effect of thyroid hormones on hepatocellular plasma protein synthesis has been studied in primary monolayer cultures derived from chick embryo liver. The chemically defined medium used for plating and maintaining the cultures contained no other hormones, protein, or serum supplement. Addition of physiological concentrations (10 nM) of triiodothyronine or thyroxine produced 3-fold or greater increases in the rates of synthesis of fibrinogen and three other major secreted proteins. By comparison albumin, transferrin, and total protein synthesis were not substantially increased. The enhanced synthesis of selected plasma proteins could be detected 6 h after initial addition of triiodothyronine. Exposure of the cells to the hormone for only 30 min was nearly as effective as continuous exposure in eliciting the ultimate response. Triiodothyronine exerted its half-maximal effect at a concentration of 1 nM. Diminished potency was associated with less iodination of the hormone; a marked reduction was noted with di-iodinated thyronine and no stimulatory activity at all with either mono- or non-iodinated thyronine."

https://openalex.org/W1552426866,"The interaction of human methemoglobin with inositol hexaphosphate (IHP) was examined by proton NMR spectroscopy. Upon addition of IHP, new proton peaks which are distinguishable from those observed in the absence of IHP appeared irrespective of the spin state of the ferric heme iron. the IHP-induced NMR peaks of low spin azide methemoglobin were not observed when azide was titrated to stripped aquomethemoglobin. Therefore, it was indicated that the IHP-induced peaks are not due to the slight dissociation of azide. Azide titration to aquomethemoglobin in the presence of IHP further revealed that the IHP-induced peaks are not due to a localized structural change but rather due to the presence of an IHP-induced new conformer. The NMR spectral intensity calibration for the 5-methylimidazole complex of methemoglobin showed that the intensity of the spectrum of stripped methemoglobin decreased by about 80% upon addition of IHP, suggesting the structural alterations in both of the alpha and beta subunits. The intensity of the IHP-induced peak at 31.1 ppm in azide methemoglobin spectrum decreased at both higher and lower pD values with its optimal around pD 6.7. The pD dependence of this peak was closely similar to that of the exchangeable proton NMR peak which has been used as a measure of the T quaternary conformation for human aquomethemoglobin (Huang, T.-H. (1979) J. Biol. Chem. 254, 11467-11474). From all of the above results, it was concluded that human low spin methemoglobin can be switched from the R to T quaternary structures by the binding of IHP. The allosteric constant L4 = [T4]/[R4] for the fully ligated low spin methemoglobin increased with decreasing temperature and was estimated to be 1 to 5 at room temperature."
https://openalex.org/W1631643119,"Paracoccus denitrificans requires potassium for normal growth and transports this cation by at least two systems, one with low (Km approximately 1 to 2 mM) and another with high (Km approximately 0.1 microM) affinity. Neither of the two systems seems to be dependent on periplasmic components since each retains full activity in cells subjected to an osmotic shock. P. denitrificans accumulates potassium at high velocity (270 nmol of K+/min/mg dry weight of cells) and against a large concentration gradient. The intracellular concentration of K+ in media of high osmolarity (about 320 mosmol) is 0.4 M; this gives a concentration gradient [K+]i/[K+]e of greater than or equal to 2 X 10(4). The uptake of potassium against its concentration gradient requires a source of energy and is eliminated by the addition of uncouplers. The increased rate of energy usage for potassium transport results in an increased rate of ATP synthesis by the respiratory chain and is expressed in enhanced rates of respiration and substrate utilization. The stimulation of respiration is accompanied by increased steady state reduction level of the components of the respiratory chain. The calculations show that two K+ are most likely to be transported per one ATP hydrolyzed."
https://openalex.org/W1488550441,"The initial event in the action of cholera toxin on intact cells is its recognition of cell-surface receptors, molecules of ganglioside GM1. We have studied details of this interaction by 13C NMR, which enables us to examine simultaneously both the protein and the ganglioside or, as in the present instance, its oligosaccharide portion. 13C NMR spectra of the toxin are consistent with the long correlation times expected for this 84,000-dalton protein. They show, however, some resolved resonances (including one tentatively assigned to the epsilon 2 carbon of tryptophan, 138.3 ppm downfield from tetramethylsilane). When oligosaccharide is added to the toxin this resonance broadens or moves further upfield to reside under phenylalanine resonances at 136.7 ppm. Of the seven tryptophan residues in cholera toxin, five are in the B subunits which bind GM1, so that the data are consistent with a resonance shift for the epsilon 2 carbons of these residues on binding the oligosaccharide. Resonances arising from the anomeric and methylene carbons of the sialic acid moiety of the oligosaccharide are also shifted. Comparison with corresponding chemical shifts in a series of model compounds suggest that the latter effects may originate in a toxin-induced conformational change in the oligosaccharide. At high resolution, anomeric carbon resonances of terminal galactose residues in free and bound oligosaccharide are also resolved."

https://openalex.org/W1561294145,"Surface-exposed glycolipids in human platelets were investigated with nonpenetrating membrane probes, NaB3H4/galactose oxidase and NaB3H4/periodate. Trihexosylceramide, globoside, and hematoside were exposed in resting platelets. The incubation of platelets with thrombin resulted in a 50% reduction in the labeling of both trihexosylceramide and globoside and a 100% increase in labeling of hematoside on the platelet surface. The quantitation of glycolipids in platelets incubated with thrombin revealed no changes in the amounts of trihexosylceramide and globoside but there was an increase in hematoside. These experiments indicate that there is a specific rearrangement of glycolipids on the surface of thrombin-treated platelets. The study also showed that both ceramide A and B are present in platelets. The former contained 3.36 nmol of sphingosine and the latter 0.12 nmol of sphingosine/10(9) platelets. The sphingosine composition of ceramide B, glucosylceramide, and the minor platelet gangliosides was similar and they were composed of two-thirds erythrosphingosine (18:1) and one-third threosphingosine (18:1). The composition of lactosylceramide, trihexosylceramide, globoside, and hematoside was related to ceramide B and they contained about 60% erythrosphingosine (18:1), 25% threosphingosine (18:1), and 10% dihydrosphingosine (18:0). Ceramide A differed in that it was composed of 56% erythrosphingosine (18:1), 34.7% dihydrosphingosine (18:0), 4.3% threosphingosine (18:1), 2.7% erythrosphingosine (16:1), and 2.3% erythrosphingosine (17:1). The sphingosine composition of sphingomyelin resembled that of ceramide A but did not contain threosphingosine (18:1). The possibility that platelet ceramide B is involved n glycolipid metabolism and ceramide A in sphingomyelin metabolism is considered."
https://openalex.org/W1546449564,"Upon exposure to either human skin fibroblasts or human circulating leukocytes, the composition of human serum high density lipoprotein-3 (HDL3) was modified by the apparent loss of apolipoprotein A-II and a 2- to 4-fold increase in glycosphingolipid content. Exposure of HDL3 to leukocytes produced an increase in the content of lactosylceramide, which is the major glycolipid in leukocytes, whereas exposure of HDL3 to human skin fibroblasts produced predominantly an increase in trihexosylceramide, which is the major glycolipid in fibroblasts. Other protein components of HDL3 (such as apolipoprotein A-I) were unaffected and there were no major changes in either neutral lipid or phospholipid composition. The increase in glycosphingolipid content of both cells and reisolated HDL3 particles was HDL3 concentration-dependent up to a concentration of 1 mg/ml and appeared to be the result of a stimulation of cellular glycolipid synthesis by HDL3 and subsequent transfer to HDL3 in the medium. A similar stimulation could not be produced by either low density lipoprotein or lipoprotein-deficient human serum. The coaddition of HDL3 and lipoprotein-deficient serum reduced both the loss of apolipoprotein A-II and the change in HDL3 glycolipid content, but not the increase in cellular glycolipid content, suggesting that modification of the apolipoprotein A-II peptide may enhance the ability of HDL3 to acquire new glycolipid from cells."
https://openalex.org/W1529824105,"Sulfated proteoglycans synthesized by intact embryonic chick vertebral cartilages maintained in organ culture were characterized by labeling the vertebral chondrocytes with [35S]sulfate. More than 95% of the sulfated macromolecules synthesized by the cartilages are retained in their extracellular matrix. Sucrose velocity sedimentation gradient analyses revealed that the intact cartilages synthesized primarily proteoglycan monomers typical of cartilage and also small amounts of a smaller sized proteoglycan. The continuously varying size distribution of monomers which characterize a population of proteoglycans, could, in part, be attributed to heterogeneity of other chondroitin sulfate chain size. Changes in the proteoglycans synthesized by intact cartilages were analyzed between 6 h and 8 days of organ culture: (i) monomers decreased in molecular size with age in organ culture; (ii) the decrease in monomer size could be partially attributed to a shortening of their chondroitin sulfate chains; (iii) the 6S/4S disaccharide composition of the chondroitin sulfate chains also changed with culture age, from 1.8 to 0.3. This change was shown to be independent of the concomitant decrease in monomer size. These changes are similar to those which occur in proteoglycans synthesized by articular cartilages from chickens of increasing age. This cartilage culture system is likely to be a more useful model for studying changes which accompany aging and/or senescence in cartilage in vivo than the more commonly studied dispersed chondrocyte cultures."
https://openalex.org/W1598760348,"H1 histones from trout testis, kidney, and liver were purified and characterized. They were extracted directly from tissues by aqueous 0.74 M perchloric acid and analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, as well as by ion exchange chromatography employing Bio-Rex 70. While in each case there was a single major H1 band on sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, the elution patterns from Bio-Rex 70 appeared complex and indicated microheterogeneity. Moreover, by electrophoresis, as well as chromatography, extracts from kidney and liver were observed to contain additional component(s) not found in testis. These components were remarkable H1 subfractions in that they contained methionine and multiple tyrosine residues. Trout testis H1 is unusual in that it has been found to be essentially homogeneous in primary structure (Macleod, A. R., Wong, C. W., and Dixon, G. H. (1977) Eur. J. Biochem. 78, 281-291), while H1 from any other source that has been scrutinized rigorously has shown microheterogeneity. The present observation, that trout tissues generally have multiple H1 subfractions, established that the trout is not exceptional among organisms in possessing a single type of H1. Rather, it is the testis that is unusual among trout tissue in the homogeneity of its H1 population."
https://openalex.org/W1750127972,"The effect of extracellular pH on hexose uptake by cultured Novikoff hepatoma cells has been examined with respect to four distinct parameters: i) the transport of 3-O-methyl-D-glucose, ii) the uptake of 2-deoxy-D-glucose by intact cells, iii) the phosphorylation of 2-deoxy-D-glucose in vitro by cell-free preparations, and iv) the intracellular pH as measured by 5,5'-dimethyl[2-14C]oxazolidine-2,4-dione. Transport per se was not affected by pH in the range of 6 to 8, while uptake of 2-deoxy-D-glucose increased with pH 2- to 3-fold over this range. The pH sensitivity of uptake can be explained on the basis of a change in hexokinase activity effective in situ. The pH dependence of hexokinase observed in vitro, however, was insufficient to account for that apparent in situ."
https://openalex.org/W1504800857,"The fluorescent dye, 3,3'-dipropylthiadicarbocyanine iodide, is frequently used to estimate the cell membrane potential of small cells. We have tested the effects of this dye on glycolytic rate, O2 consumption, and cellular ATP content in Ehrlich ascites tumor cells. Addition of the dye to steady state cells in the absence of glucose induces a rapid depletion (half-time approximately equal to 5 min) of cellular ATP, which is secondary to a 76% inhibition of O2 consumption. Aerobic glycolysis is stimulated by 76%. Valinomycin produces an additional stimulation of acid production. Our findings indicate that this fluorescent dye alters energy metabolism of Ehrlich ascites tumor cells. The response is consistent with primary inhibition of oxidative phosphorylation."

In order to determine whether changes in the structural domain of transhydrogenase accompany the large change in activation energy, the degree of proteolytic inactivation of membrane-bound transhydrogenase was monitored as a function of temperature. Changes in the susceptibility of transhydrogenase to proteolytic inactivation over the 5 degrees -40 degrees C interval correlate well with the observed alteration in activation energies. No temperature-dependent change in either apparent activation energy or susceptibility to proteolysis were observed in detergent-solubilized transhydrogenase. Interactions between transhydrogenase and its microenvironment in the mitochondrial membrane may be an important factor in determining its activity."

https://openalex.org/W1490687307,"We have investigated whether the phosphorylation of the Mr = 35,000 subunit of eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF-2 alpha) by the hemin-controlled translational repressor (HCR), which appears to mediate the regulation of protein synthesis by hemin in rabbit reticulocytes, occurs at a single or multiple sites. Following phosphorylation of highly purified ribosomal or soluble eIF-2 with [gamma-32P]ATP and highly purified HCR, eIF-2 alpha was isolated by elution from a 7% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel, subjected to trypsin digestion, and analyzed on 20% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels. By 9 h of digestion none of the original, Mr = 35,000 subunit remained, and after 24 h the 32P radioactivity was distributed in multiple polypeptides in the range of Mr = 4,000 to 8,000. After 4 days of trypsinization, however, all of these peptides were reduced to a low level except for a minor band with Mr = 4,500, and a Mr = 1,500 component became the predominant 32P-labeled product. After 6 days of trypsin digestion the minor Mr = 4,500 component was much less but still detectable, and the Mr = 1,500 component represented 85% (ribosomal eIF-2 alpha) and 90% (soluble eIF-2 alpha) of the total radioactivity. The Mr = 1,500 component, when eluted fro 20% gels, showed a single spot when fingerprinted on thin layer cellulose sheets that was identical whether derived from ribosomal or soluble eIF-2 alpha. These findings suggest that HCR phosphorylates eIF-2 alpha at one specific site, although we cannot exclude the possibility that a second, minor site may also become phosphorylated to a very limited degree."
