The ‘Tween’ method of Gomori2 was chosen for the purpose. The substrate used was ‘Tween 80’ (Atlas). The incubation medium contained 2 ml. 10 per cent calcium chloride, 2 ml. 5 per cent ‘Tween 80’, 5 ml. bicarbonate buffer3 of pH 8.4, 40 ml. distilled water and a crystal of thymol as preservative. The mixture was kept overnight in an oven at 40° C. and the precipitate formed was filtered off before use. Sections were incubated for 10–12 hr. at 40° C., which is the optimum temperature for this lipase1. Parallel experiments were run with sections of pancreas of the same animal for comparison and confirmation of the results. It was noted that acetone destroyed the lipase, and experiments with paraffin sections of tissue fixed in acetone yielded negative results."

https://openalex.org/W9594420,"SUMMARY Cell-free extracts of Clostridium tetanomorphum convert glutamate-4-Cl4 to mesaconate-Cl4 which is labeled exclusively in the carbon atom adjacent to the methyl group. This and other tracer evidence prove, first, that the methyl carbon atom of mesaconate is derived from carbon atom 3 of gluta- mate and, second, that the formation of the branched chain structure of mesaconate results from cleavage of the bond between carbon atoms 2 and 3 of glutamate, or a straight chain compound derived thereof, and forma- tion of a new bond between carbon atoms 2 and 4.

Recent experiments on a larger scale with the same technique have now been performed on semen from 10 different bulls. Whereas in the earlier experiments 1,100 r.p.m. was used, the separation in seven of the present experiments was performed at the same velocity and in eight at 1,000 r.p.m."

https://openalex.org/W1984252025,SOME unfertilized eggs of the rabbit are still fertilizable subsequent to cooling to temperatures as low as 0° C.1. In our attempts to preserve unfertilized mouse eggs at temperatures above and below freezing we have discovered that some of these germ cells survive exposure to −10°C.

https://openalex.org/W2312598340,"NON-IONIC adsorption of aromatic substances on ion exchange resins discussed by D. E. Weiss1 has been successfully utilized by me for the Chromatographic separation of aromatic compounds, for example, alkylated phenols2 and N-2: 4-dinitrophenylamines3, on the column of carboxylic acid type cation exchange resins, ‘Amberlite IRC–50’ and ‘Duolite CS–101’ (H form). The technique has now been extended to the Chromatographic separation of œstrogens using partially esterified carboxylic acid type cation exchanger as adsorbent. About 30 ml. of ‘Amberlite IRC–50’ (H form: 200–300 mesh, screened wet in sodium ion form4) was boiled with 400 ml. of the mixture of ethanol and N hydrochloric acid (2 : 1 by vol.) for 40 hr. This partially esterified resin was washed with the mixture of ethanol and water (3 : 2 by vol.) and suspended in two volumes of the same mixture. The suspension was poured into a Chromatographic tube and allowed to settle under gravity. A column 0.8 cm. in diameter and 62 cm. in height was used. Œstrogens were dissolved in the same solvent as that used for the packing of the column. 1 ml. of the solution was placed on the column and allowed to drain under gravity. Elution was performed with the same solvent and the effluent was collected in fractions of 40 drops. The ultraviolet absorption was measured at 280 mµ using a Beckman DU quartz spectrophotometer and plotted against fraction number (Fig. 1). The elution sequence was similar to that of reversed phase partition chromatography5, the most polar component being eluted first. Recovery from the column was satisfactory and the elution pattern was reproducible. Since the condition of the column is unchanged after chromatography, the column can be used many times."

https://openalex.org/W1966343274,"IN a previous publication1 a hypothesis was proposed to the effect that if a nucleic acid serves as a template for the linear array of amino-acids in a protein, it prescribes only the positions to be occupied by the aromatic amino-acids in that protein. It was postulated that the planar rings of the aromatic amino-acids would be differentially bound in cavities formed by two adjacent bases in such a way that the aromatic amino-acids with only six-membered rings (group 1) would occupy the space between two pyrimidines and those with five-membered rings (group 2) would occupy that between two purines. This hypothesis imposes certain restrictions on the arrangement of these amino-acids in proteins. It requires that, sandwiched between a pair of aromatic amino-acids belonging to the same group, there will be either none or an even number of non-aromatic amino-acids, and that an odd number will separate aromatic amino-acids of different groups."
https://openalex.org/W2020199834,"RECENT communications1,2 indicate the growing interest in the properties of lysolecithin. Its clearing action on lecithin sols is remarkable, and mixed sols of lecithin and lysolecithin show an interesting viscosity maximum3. The lyso-compound has a considerable effect on the stability of lecithin sols in the presence of salts3. Neumann and Habermann point out2 that the formation of lysolecithin in vivo could provide a mechanism for changes in cell membrane permeability."
https://openalex.org/W2037956317,"IT is well known that the duration of transmitter action in neuromuscular transmission is very brief, of the order of 4 msec., and prolonged decline of the end-plate potential is due to the slow dissipation of charge along and across the resting membrane1–4. The time course of the active phase of the neuro-musoular transmission has been calculated by some authors1,3, but it has not yet been obtained experimentally. In the present investigation the time course of the active phase of the transmitter producing the end-plate potential was recorded by a refined voltage clamp method (the original method was described by Hodgkin et al.

Paper electrophoresis was performed at 120 V., in acetate buffer (a mixture of M/5 acetic acid–sodium acetate buffer and 0.9 per cent sodium chloride solution) in the pH. range less than 6.0, and barbital buffer (Michaelis sodium barbital-sodium acetate-hydrochloric acid buffer) at pH greater than 6.0; the positions of the coloured spots were observed directly during the procedure, but even minute quantities of urobilinoid pigments could be seen at the end of the run after spraying the papers with Schlesinger reagent (saturated zinc acetate solution in ethanol), and observing the green fluorescence in ultra-violet light. With the exception of the sharply defined pH. value of 4.41 at which both urobilinoid pigments became immobile in the electric field, they moved towards the cathode at pH less than 4.41 and toward the anode at pH. greater than this value, the direction of movement, which was the same for both pigments, being dependent only on the pH. However, the rate of movement of these materials differed at various pH. levels: thus in buffers around pH 5.0 and at pH less than 4.41 stercobilin migrated faster toward the anode or cathode, respectively, whereas at higher pH values (8.6) urobilin was found to move faster than stercobilin in the anode direction."

https://openalex.org/W171092698,"THE possibility of obtaining from X-ray diffraction results a quantitative estimate of the course of the α-β transformation as a keratin specimen is stretched is so important that attempts such as that of Bendit1 are to be welcomed. I feel, however, that it is impossible to say the same about the proposal recently put forward by V. D. Gupta2, who measures for specimens at various extensions the value of an index which he wishes to take as a measure of what he calls the “degree of order”. So far as can be gathered from his somewhat ambiguous phraseology, the quantities Im and Ie are the intensities of the meridional and equatorial diffraction spots, the former the group of reflexions with spacings near 5.1 A., and the latter the reflexions with spacings near 10 A. (common to the α- and β-photographs) and near 4.65 A. (characteristic of the β-photograph). If this interpretation of Gupta's intentions is correct, then changes in Ω are indications not so much of changes in the degree of order (whatever this might mean) as of changes in the β : α ratio. His conclusion that during stretching there is an initial rapid rise in the degree of order, with little further change at extensions greater than 40 per cent, should therefore be replaced by the almost trivial result (it was not so trivial 30 years ago) that the X-ray photograph at 40 per cent extension is more like that at 70 per cent extension than it is like that of unstretched fibres."
