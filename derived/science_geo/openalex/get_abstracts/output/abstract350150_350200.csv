https://openalex.org/W1965371218,"A search for general regulators of cancer metastasis has yielded a set of microRNAs for which expression is specifically lost as human breast cancer cells develop metastatic potential. Here we show that restoring the expression of these microRNAs in malignant cells suppresses lung and bone metastasis by human cancer cells in vivo. Of these microRNAs, miR-126 restoration reduces overall tumour growth and proliferation, whereas miR-335 inhibits metastatic cell invasion. miR-335 regulates a set of genes whose collective expression in a large cohort of human tumours is associated with risk of distal metastasis. miR-335 suppresses metastasis and migration through targeting of the progenitor cell transcription factor SOX4 and extracellular matrix component tenascin C. Expression of miR-126 and miR-335 is lost in the majority of primary breast tumours from patients who relapse, and the loss of expression of either microRNA is associated with poor distal metastasis-free survival. miR-335 and miR-126 are thus identified as metastasis suppressor microRNAs in human breast cancer. Recent studies have highlighted global downregulation of microRNAs in cancers, and have shown that artificial downregulation of all microRNAs can enhance tumour growth. Array-based microRNA profiling of human breast cancer cells that are metastatic to bone and lung now implicates two microRNAs, miR-126 and miR-335, in breast cancer tumorigenesis and metastasis. Loss of miR-335 expression promotes breast cancer cell invasion by targeting the transcription factor SOX4 and tenascin C, a protein involved in cell adhesion. In breast cancer patients, loss of miR-126 and miR-335 expression is indicative of a poor prognosis. The microRNAs miR-126 and miR-335 have an important role in breast cancer tumourigenesis and metastasis. Loss of miR-335 expression promotes breast cancer cell invasion by targeting SOX4 and tenascin C. In breast cancer patients, loss of miR-126 and miR-335 expression is indicative of a poor prognosis."

The effect is the photonic version of the spin Hall effect in electronic systems, indicating the universality of the effect for particles of different nature. Treating the effect as a weak measurement of the spin projection of the photons, we used a preselection and postselection technique on the spin state to enhance the original displacement by nearly four orders of magnitude, attaining sensitivity to displacements of ∼1 angstrom. The spin Hall effect can be used for manipulating photonic angular momentum states, and the measurement technique holds promise for precision metrology."

We performed a large-scale small interfering RNA screen to identify host factors required by HIV-1 and identified more than 250 HIV-dependency factors (HDFs). These proteins participate in a broad array of cellular functions and implicate new pathways in the viral life cycle. Further analysis revealed previously unknown roles for retrograde Golgi transport proteins (Rab6 and Vps53) in viral entry, a karyopherin (TNPO3) in viral integration, and the Mediator complex (Med28) in viral transcription. Transcriptional analysis revealed that HDF genes were enriched for high expression in immune cells, suggesting that viruses evolve in host cells that optimally perform the functions required for their life cycle. This effort illustrates the power with which RNA interference and forward genetics can be used to expose the dependencies of human pathogens such as HIV, and in so doing identify potential targets for therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2039408641,"Tumour suppressor genes (TSGs) inhibiting normal cellular growth are frequently silenced epigenetically in cancer. DNA methylation is commonly associated with TSG silencing, yet mutations in the DNA methylation initiation and recognition machinery in carcinogenesis are unknown. An intriguing possible mechanism for gene regulation involves widespread non-coding RNAs such as microRNA, Piwi-interacting RNA and antisense RNAs. Widespread sense-antisense transcripts have been systematically identified in mammalian cells, and global transcriptome analysis shows that up to 70% of transcripts have antisense partners and that perturbation of antisense RNA can alter the expression of the sense gene. For example, it has been shown that an antisense transcript not naturally occurring but induced by genetic mutation leads to gene silencing and DNA methylation, causing thalassaemia in a patient. Here we show that many TSGs have nearby antisense RNAs, and we focus on the role of one RNA in silencing p15, a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor implicated in leukaemia. We found an inverse relation between p15 antisense (p15AS) and p15 sense expression in leukaemia. A p15AS expression construct induced p15 silencing in cis and in trans through heterochromatin formation but not DNA methylation; the silencing persisted after p15AS was turned off, although methylation and heterochromatin inhibitors reversed this process. The p15AS-induced silencing was Dicer-independent. Expression of exogenous p15AS in mouse embryonic stem cells caused p15 silencing and increased growth, through heterochromatin formation, as well as DNA methylation after differentiation of the embryonic stem cells. Thus, natural antisense RNA may be a trigger for heterochromatin formation and DNA methylation in TSG silencing in tumorigenesis."

https://openalex.org/W2003670332,"When fluctuating fields are confined between two surfaces, long-range forces arise. A famous example is the quantum-electrodynamical Casimir force that results from zero-point vacuum fluctuations confined between two conducting metal plates1. A thermodynamic analogue is the critical Casimir force: it acts between surfaces immersed in a binary liquid mixture close to its critical point and arises from the confinement of concentration fluctuations within the thin film of fluid separating the surfaces2. So far, all experimental evidence for the existence of this effect has been indirect3,4,5. Here we report the direct measurement of critical Casimir force between a single colloidal sphere and a flat silica surface immersed in a mixture of water and 2,6-lutidine near its critical point. We use total internal reflection microscopy to determine in situ the forces between the sphere and the surface, with femtonewton resolution6. Depending on whether the adsorption preferences of the sphere and the surface for water and 2,6-lutidine are identical or opposite, we measure attractive and repulsive forces, respectively, that agree quantitatively with theoretical predictions and exhibit exquisite dependence on the temperature of the system. We expect that these features of critical Casimir forces may result in novel uses of colloids as model systems."
https://openalex.org/W1967711301,"Electronic phases with symmetry properties matching those of conventional liquid crystals have recently been discovered in transport experiments on semiconductor heterostructures and metal oxides at millikelvin temperatures. We report the spontaneous onset of a one-dimensional, incommensurate modulation of the spin system in the high-transition-temperature superconductor YBa 2 Cu 3 O 6.45 upon cooling below ∼150 kelvin, whereas static magnetic order is absent above 2 kelvin. The evolution of this modulation with temperature and doping parallels that of the in-plane anisotropy of the resistivity, indicating an electronic nematic phase that is stable over a wide temperature range. The results suggest that soft spin fluctuations are a microscopic route toward electronic liquid crystals and that nematic order can coexist with high-temperature superconductivity in underdoped cuprates."

https://openalex.org/W2046614930,"The DNA origami method, in which long, single-stranded DNA segments are folded into shapes by short staple segments, was used to create nucleic acid probe tiles that are molecular analogs of macroscopic DNA chips. One hundred trillion probe tiles were fabricated in one step and bear pairs of 20-nucleotide-long single-stranded DNA segments that act as probe sequences. These tiles can hybridize to their targets in solution and, after adsorption onto mica surfaces, can be examined by atomic force microscopy in order to quantify binding events, because the probe segments greatly increase in stiffness upon hybridization. The nucleic acid probe tiles have been used to study position-dependent hybridization on the nanoscale and have also been used for label-free detection of RNA."
https://openalex.org/W2028649950,"STIM1 and ORAI1 (also termed CRACM1) are essential components of the classical calcium release-activated calcium current; however, the mechanism of the transmission of information of STIM1 to the calcium release-activated calcium/ORAI1 channel is as yet unknown. Here we demonstrate by Förster resonance energy transfer microscopy a dynamic coupling of STIM1 and ORAI1 that culminates in the activation of Ca2+ entry. Förster resonance energy transfer imaging of living cells provided insight into the time dependence of crucial events of this signaling pathway comprising Ca2+ store depletion, STIM1 multimerization, and STIM1-ORAI1 interaction. Accelerated store depletion allowed resolving a significant time lag between STIM1-STIM1 and STIM1-ORAI1 interactions. Store refilling reversed both STIM1 multimerization and STIM1-ORAI1 interaction. The cytosolic STIM1 C terminus itself was able, in vitro as well as in vivo, to associate with ORAI1 and to stimulate channel function, yet without ORAI1-STIM1 cluster formation. The dynamic interaction occurred via the C terminus of ORAI1 that includes a putative coiled-coil domain structure. An ORAI1 C terminus deletion mutant as well as a mutant (L273S) with impeded coiled-coil domain formation lacked both interaction as well as functional communication with STIM1 and failed to generate Ca2+ inward currents. An N-terminal deletion mutant of ORAI1 as well as the ORAI1 R91W mutant linked to severe combined immune deficiency syndrome was similarly impaired in terms of current activation despite being able to interact with STIM1. Hence, the C-terminal coiled-coil motif of ORAI1 represents a key domain for dynamic coupling to STIM1.

Bootman M.D. Roderick H.L. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 517-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (4116) Google Scholar). The prototypic SOC is the Ca2+ release-activated Ca2+ (CRAC) channel. It is activated by depletion of intracellular Ca2+ stores, which is induced by the second messenger inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (2Parekh A.B.

The signaling events leading to the activation of CRAC/SOC as well as the composition of this channel have been a long standing mystery.

These proteins are associated in the ER membrane and sense Ca2+ via an EF hand Ca2+-binding site located in the lumen of the ER.

Severe combined immune deficiency syndrome patients are homozygous for single missense mutation in ORAI1, i.e. ORAI1R91W, leading to the loss of store-operated Ca2+ entry (10Feske S. Gwack Y.

Based on permeability studies of different point mutations in transmembrane regions 1 and 3 of ORAI1, it is suggested to form the pore of store-operated channels (15Cahalan M.D. Zhang S.L.

Subsequently both proteins are supposed to manifest the main components of CRAC; however, the detailed mechanism between STIM1 multimerization and ORAI1 activation is still unknown.To elucidate the communication between STIM1 and ORAI1, we utilized Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) microscopy to reveal a dynamic coupling of STIM1 and ORAI1 within a range of <10 nm, which results in the activation of Ca2+ entry. STIM1-STIM1 multimerization is followed by STIM1-ORAI1 interaction with a significant delay in time, and both processes could be reversed by store refilling. This association was also observed with the C terminus of STIM1 alone, but in a constitutive manner that resulted in channel activation yet without ORAI1-STIM1 cluster formation. A putative coiled-coil structure in the C terminus of ORAI1 was identified as the relevant domain for this functional protein-protein coupling, whereas the N terminus together with the critical position of Arg91 controlled rather the gating than the interaction with STIM1.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMolecular Cloning and Mutagenesis—Human ORAI1 (ORAI1; accession number NM_032790) was kindly provided by A. Rao's lab (Harvard Medical School). C-terminally tagged pECFP-N1 and pEYFP-N1/ORAI1 constructs were cloned using the XhoI and BamHI sites of the contemplated vectors. N-terminally tagged ORAI1 constructs were cloned via SalI and SmaI restriction sites of pECFP-C1 and pEYFP-C1 expression vectors (Clontech). An N-terminal deletion mutant (ΔN-term-ORAI1, amino acids 89-301) was cloned via PCR into the T/A site of pCDNA3.1V5-His TOPO expression vector (Invitrogen) and recloned into pECFP-C1 and pEYFP-C1 internal restriction sites KpnI and XbaI. A C-terminal deletion mutant (ORAI1-ΔCtermin, amino acids 1-260) was constructed similarly, and ECFP-C1 as well as EYFP-C1 N-terminally labeled ORAI1-ΔCtermin constructs were prepared as described above. pECFP/pEYFP-C1/ORAI1 served as a template for the generation of the coiled-coil mutant L273S and the ORAI1 R91W mutant. Suitable primers exchanged the corresponding codon from GAG to TCG (L273S) or from CGG to TGG (R91W) using a QuikChange XL site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Human STIM1 (STIM1, accession number NM_003156) N-terminally ECFP- and EYFP-tagged was kindly provided by T. Meyer's lab (Stanford University). C-terminally EYFP-tagged STIM1 was purchased from GeneCopoeia™ (catalog number EX-S0521-M02). STIM1 C terminus (amino acids 233-685) was cloned into the T/A site of pcDNA3.1V5 His TOPO by PCR and subcloned into pECFP-C1 and pEYFP-C1 via their internal restriction sites KpnI and XbaI. For pulldown assays the STOP of STIM1 C terminus on position 685 was substituted by serine to obtain a STIM1 C-terminal/His6 fusion protein. GST fusion proteins (GST ORAI1-N-term and GST-ORAI1 C-term) were cloned in frame with the GST gene into pGEX4T-1 (Clontech) via its internal restriction sites BamHI and XhoI. The integrity of all resulting clones was confirmed by sequence analysis.His Tag Pulldown Assay—His6-STIM1 C terminus and ORAI1 were synthesized in separate reactions using the TnT reticulocyte lysate (Promega) in the presence of 35S. His6-STIM1 C terminus was coupled to magnetic (MagZ) beads, specific for His tag proteins purified from the TnT system (Promega), by shaking at 15 min at room temperature. STIM1 C terminus-coupled beads were washed three times and diluted in binding buffer (20 mm NaH2PO4, 500 mm NaCl, pH 7.4). For the binding assay, these beads were incubated with 20 μl of the ORAI1 reaction for 1 h at room temperature in binding buffer including protease inhibitors, washed with increasing concentrations of imidazol (10-40 mm), diluted in 2× Laemmli buffer, and boiled. The proteins were separated on a 12% polyacrylamide gel which was fixed, dried, and exposed to an x-ray film overnight. As a negative control, beads without His6-STIM1 C terminus were incubated with ORAI1.GST Tag Pulldown Assay—These assays were carried out using glutathione-Sepharose to collect GST fusion proteins (ORAI1 N terminus and ORAI1 C terminus). His-tagged STIM1 C terminus employed as a prey was tested for its ability to interact with prebound ORAI1 fragments. GST alone served as a negative control to detect possible nonspecific interaction of His-tagged STIM1 C terminus, which did not occur in any experiment (data not shown). GST fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified with the GST gene fusion system (GE Healthcare). His-tagged STIM1 C terminus was obtained from transiently transfected HEK293 cells and purified using the MagneHis protein purification system (Promega). Glutathione-Sepharose was incubated with 20 μg of GST fusion proteins for 30 min at 4 °C. To eliminate nonspecific binding, the samples were washed three times according to the manufacturer's manual. Purified His-tagged STIM1 C terminus (80 μg) was then incubated with the GST fusion proteins at 4 °C for 80 min. After incubation, Sepharose was washed three times, and bound proteins were eluted by the addition of 360 μl of elution buffer. Eluted proteins (40 μl) were subjected to electrophoretic separation on a 12% SDS-PAGE. To visualize potential interaction of His-tagged STIM1 C terminus and GST fusion proteins, Western blot analysis was carried out using a His5 horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody (Qiagen). Inputs of GST fusion proteins were detected reusing the blotted membrane with an anti GST antibody (GE Healthcare).Electrophysiology—Electrophysiological experiments were performed at 20-24 °C, using the patch clamp technique in the whole cell recording configuration. For STIM1/ORAI1 current measurements voltage ramps were usually applied every 5 s from a holding potential of 0 mV, covering a range of -90 to 90 mV over 1s. The internal pipette solution contained 3.5 mm MgCl2, 145 mm cesium methane sulfonate, 8 mm NaCl, 10 mm HEPES, 10 mm EGTA, pH 7.2. Extracellular solution consisted of 145 mm NaCl, 5 mm CsCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, 10 mm glucose, 10 mm CaCl2, pH 7.4.Confocal FRET Fluorescence Microscopy—Confocal FRET microscopy was performed similarly as described in Ref. 24Singh A.

In brief, a QLC100 real time confocal system (VisiTech Int.) was used for recording fluorescence images connected to two Photometrics CoolSNAPHQ monochrome cameras (Roper Scientific) and a dual port adapter (dichroic, 505lp; cyan emission filter, 485/30; yellow emission filter, 535/50; Chroma Technology Corp.). This system was attached to an Axiovert 200M microscope (Zeiss) in conjunction with an argon ion multi-wave-length (457, 488, and 514 nm) laser (Spectra Physics). The wavelengths were selected by an Acousto Optical Tuneable Filter (VisiTech Int.). MetaMorph 5.0 software (Universal Imaging Corp.) was used to acquire images and to control the confocal system. Illumination times for CFP/FRET and YFP images that were recorded with a minimum delay consecutively were approximately 900 ms. Prior to the calculation, the images have to be corrected because of cross-talk as well as cross-excitation. For this, the appropriate cross-talk calibration factors were determined for each of the constructs on the day the FRET experiments were performed. The corrected FRET image (NFRET) was calculated after background subtraction and threshold determination using a custom-made software (25Derler I. Hofbauer M. Kahr H. Fritsch R. Muik M. Kepplinger K. Hack M.E. Moritz S. Schindl R. Groschner K. Romanin C. J. Physiol. 2006; 577: 31-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) integrated in MatLab 7.0.4 according to the published method (26Xia Z. Liu Y. Biophys. J. 2001; 81: 2395-2402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). The local ratio between CFP and YFP might vary because of different localizations of diverse protein constructs, which could lead to the calculation of false FRET values (27Berney C. Danuser G. Biophys. J. 2003; 84: 3992-4010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar). Accordingly, the analysis should be limited to pixels with a CFP:YFP molar ratio between 1:10 and 10:1 (27Berney C. Danuser G. Biophys. J. 2003; 84: 3992-4010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar) to yield reliable results. This occurred rather seldom in our experiments, and approximately 90% of ratios are between 1:5 and 5:1.Statistics—Significance analysis was performed with the two-tailed Mann-Whitney test. The mean ± S.E. values are shown throughout the manuscript.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONCoupling between STIM1 and ORAI1—Association of ORAI1 and STIM1 in a signaling complex is a controversial issue (19Yeromin A.V.

To evaluate the possibility of a dynamic, physical interaction as a concept of communication between STIM1 and ORAI1, we utilized confocal FRET microscopy for imaging of living human embryonic kidney 293 cells that expressed both proteins in fluorescent-labeled form. These proteins either N- or C-terminally tagged with CFP (donor) or YFP (acceptor) displayed similar behavior as native proteins (data not shown), evident from the activation of CRAC-like currents following ER store depletion (Fig. 1a). Their biophysical characteristics such as time course of activation and maximum current density were not significantly different from native CRAC currents, with a reversal potential larger than +50 mV (Fig. 1b). ORAI1 has been reported to redistribute in response to store depletion from a homogenous to a clustered localization accumulating in the plasma membrane adjacent to clustered STIM1 (18Xu P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 350: 969-976Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 21Luik R.M. Wu M.M. Buchanan J. Lewis R.S. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 174: 815-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). Following ER store depletion by thapsigargin, we observed (Fig. 1c, left panel) both proteins labeled C-terminally colocalized in clusters. Such regions exhibited robust FRET values (0.09 ± 0.01, n = 8; Fig. 1g) demonstrating high local proximity of the tagged proteins, compatible with either direct or indirect interaction between STIM1 and ORAI1. In control experiments in which STIM1 was labeled at its N-terminal side, which is located within the ER lumen, no FRET was measured (-0.01 ± 0.01, n = 10; Fig. 1, c, right panel, and g) consistent with distant localization of fluorescence labels on opposite sides of the membrane. It is of note that in this situation a similar STIM1-ORAI1 cluster formation is evident (Fig. 1c, right panel).STIM1 C Terminus Interacts in Vivo as Well as in Vitro with ORAI1—For further investigation of the interaction, we utilized the C terminus of STIM1, which is expected (13Huang G.N. Zeng W. Kim J.Y. Yuan J.P. Han L. Muallem S. Worley P.F. Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 1003-1010Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar) to constitutively couple to ORAI1 provided that no other processes emerging from ER store depletion are absolutely required for channel activation. Coexpression of ORAI1 with STIM1 C terminus resulted indeed in constitutive currents (Fig. 1d) with current-voltage relationships (Fig. 1e) similar to Fig. 1b. Activation of these currents by STIM1 C terminus occurred to a similar extent when endogenous STIM1 was suppressed by small interfering RNA specific to full-length STIM1 (data not shown). N-terminally tagged STIM1 C terminus displayed, besides some cytosolic localization, clear targeting to the plasma membrane when expressed together with ORAI1 in HEK cells (Fig. 1f) but remained cytosolic when expressed alone (Fig. 1f; lower panel). STIM1 C terminus was colocalized with ORAI1 and yielded robust FRET (0.074 ± 0.007, n = 36). Generation of clusters was not visible when only the C-terminal fragment instead of full-length STIM1 was used (Fig. 1, compare c and f), underscoring the ER localization of the latter as a prerequisite for cluster formation (in this process). Nevertheless, the STIM1 C terminus is principally sufficient as a surrogate of STIM1 in terms of association and channel activation, yet independent of ER store depletion and ORAI1 cluster formation. In vitro pulldown experiments using His6-tagged STIM1 C terminus as bait demonstrated the ability of the C-terminal domain of STIM1 to associate with ORAI1 in cell-free conditions (Fig. 1h, left panel). ORAI1 binding increased significantly (33 ± 4 versus 23 ± 5 arbitrary units, n = 9, p < 0.01) above the relatively high background binding of ORAI1 when His6-tagged STIM1 C terminus was prebound. To strengthen this in vitro approach, we focused on the N and C termini of ORAI1 and employed these fragments as GST proteins to potentially pull down His-tagged STIM1 C terminus (Fig. 1h, right panel). The C terminus of ORAI1 in contrast to its N terminus showed clear interaction with STIM1 C terminus (n = 7), indicating association of the proteins in vitro and suggesting binding as a molecular process involved in channel activation.Dynamic STIM1-ORAI1 Coupling Is Controlled by the Filling State of the ER—To analyze kinetic aspects of this coupling process, we monitored the time dependence of the STIM1-ORAI1 interaction by dynamic FRET measurements in response to ER store depletion by thapsigargin or ionomycin (Fig. 2a). Under resting conditions the STIM1-ORAI1 interaction seemed to be largely reduced (Fig. 2a) based on the low FRET values. Despite some colocalization between STIM1 and ORAI1, clusters were scarcely visible. Following thapsigargin application, formation of STIM1-ORAI1 coclusters developed over a time period of 240 s and was temporally as well as spatially correlated with an increase in FRET (Fig. 2, a and b). This suggested a causal relationship between ER depletion and development of dynamical STIM1-ORAI1 interactions. Consistently, ionomycin (Fig. 2b, see also Fig. 2g), which is known to deplete ER stores more rapidly than thapsigargin, induced both a faster onset and development of FRET over 120 s, further substantiating that the increasing STIM1-ORAI1 interactions are linked to store depletion.FIGURE 2STIM1-ORAI1 coupling and STIM1 multimerization occur reversibly correlated in time with the ER filling state. a, left panel, localization, overlay, and calculated FRET life cell image series of ORAI1-CFP and STIM1-YFP in response to 2 μm TG.

The time course of ER store depletion was monitored employing ER-targeted cameleon (31Miyawaki A. Llopis J. Heim R. McCaffery J.M. Adams J.A. Ikura M. Tsien R.Y.

For the latter we employed a FRET based assay (32Liou J. Fivaz M. Inoue T. Meyer T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Correlating the decrease in ER Ca2+ concentration with the increase in FRET from homomeric STIM1, multimerization revealed (Fig. 2d) a reciprocal time course that supports the linkage between these two processes. Moreover, superimposing (Fig. 2e) the normalized time courses of the individual steps of the ORAI1 activation machinery indicated a temporal coherence and an overlap of these processes. Accelerated ER store depletion employing 10 μm ionomycin (32Liou J. Fivaz M. Inoue T. Meyer T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The two interacting loci are tightly linked, with incompatible alleles occurring in linkage disequilibrium in two common haplotypes.

https://openalex.org/W2066301717,"Stem cell self-renewal implies proliferation under continued maintenance of multipotency. Small changes in numbers of stem cells may lead to large differences in differentiated cell numbers, resulting in significant physiological consequences. Proliferation is typically regulated in the G1 phase, which is associated with differentiation and cell cycle arrest. However, embryonic stem (ES) cells may lack a G1 checkpoint. Regulation of proliferation in the 'DNA damage' S/G2 cell cycle checkpoint pathway is known for its role in the maintenance of chromatin structural integrity. Here we show that autocrine/paracrine gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) signalling by means of GABA(A) receptors negatively controls ES cell and peripheral neural crest stem (NCS) cell proliferation, preimplantation embryonic growth and proliferation in the boundary-cap stem cell niche, resulting in an attenuation of neuronal progenies from this stem cell niche. Activation of GABA(A) receptors leads to hyperpolarization, increased cell volume and accumulation of stem cells in S phase, thereby causing a rapid decrease in cell proliferation. GABA(A) receptors signal through S-phase checkpoint kinases of the phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase-related kinase family and the histone variant H2AX. This signalling pathway critically regulates proliferation independently of differentiation, apoptosis and overt damage to DNA. These results indicate the presence of a fundamentally different mechanism of proliferation control in these stem cells, in comparison with most somatic cells, involving proteins in the DNA damage checkpoint pathway."

https://openalex.org/W2026801036,"Calcium controls a number of critical events, including motility, secretion, cell invasion and egress by apicomplexan parasites. Compared to animal and plant cells, the molecular mechanisms that govern calcium signalling in parasites are poorly understood. Here we show that the production of the phytohormone abscisic acid (ABA) controls calcium signalling within the apicomplexan parasite Toxoplasma gondii, an opportunistic human pathogen. In plants, ABA controls a number of important events, including environmental stress responses, embryo development and seed dormancy. ABA induces production of the second-messenger cyclic ADP ribose (cADPR), which controls release of intracellular calcium stores in plants. cADPR also controls intracellular calcium release in the protozoan parasite T. gondii; however, previous studies have not revealed the molecular basis of this pathway. We found that addition of exogenous ABA induced formation of cADPR in T. gondii, stimulated calcium-dependent protein secretion, and induced parasite egress from the infected host cell in a density-dependent manner. Production of endogenous ABA within the parasite was confirmed by purification (using high-performance liquid chromatography) and analysis (by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry). Selective disruption of ABA synthesis by the inhibitor fluridone delayed egress and induced development of the slow-growing, dormant cyst stage of the parasite. Thus, ABA-mediated calcium signalling controls the decision between lytic and chronic stage growth, a developmental switch that is central in pathogenesis and transmission. The pathway for ABA production was probably acquired with an algal endosymbiont that was retained as a non-photosynthetic plastid known as the apicoplast. The plant-like nature of this pathway may be exploited therapeutically, as shown by the ability of a specific inhibitor of ABA synthesis to prevent toxoplasmosis in the mouse model."

Aβ peptides are produced by proteolytic processing of APP, resulting in production of Aβ40 and Aβ42 (1–40 and 1–42 residues, respectively). Proteases referred to as β-secretase and γ-secretase cleave at the N- and C termini of Aβ within APP to generate Aβ peptides. Aβ peptides then undergo secretion to provide extracellular Aβ that produces neurotoxic effects with aggregation and accumulation in amyloid plaques of AD brains. Compounds that inhibit β-secretase activity are particularly attractive as potential therapeutic agents for AD. The majority of AD patients express the wild-type (WT) β-secretase site of APP. Therefore, compounds that inhibit cleavage of the WT β-secretase site are relevant to the AD population. Significantly, findings in this study showed that the endogenous β-secretase activity in Aβ-containing regulated secretory vesicles (RSV) possesses high selectivity for cleaving the WT β-secretase site but does not cleave the Swedish (Swe) mutant β-secretase site. The RSV provide production and synthesis of a major portion of secreted Aβ (8Hook V.Y.H. Toneff T. Aaron W. Yasothornsrikul S. Bundey R. Reisine T. J.

In contrast, these cysteine protease inhibitors had no effect on any of these parameters in mice expressing the Swe mutant β-secretase site of APP (in Swedish/London APP mice). Most importantly, these results show that these cysteine protease inhibitors are efficacious for improving memory deficit in an AD mouse model representative of the majority of AD patients who express the WT β-secretase site of APP. These novel findings implicate the potential use of such cysteine protease inhibitors as candidate therapeutic agents for treatment of AD. RSV and Cathepsin B Assays with Z-Val-Lys-Met ↓ MCA Substrate That Represents the WT β-Secretase Site—RSV were purified from bovine adrenal medulla as previously described (18Krieger T.J. Hook V.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8376-8383Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The endogenous β-secretase activity in the RSV was assayed with Z-Val-Lys-Met ↓ MCA substrate that mimics the WT β-secretase site of APP as well as with Z-Val-Asn-Leu ↓ MCA that mimics the Swe mutant β-secretase site of APP (substrates from TheraKem). Cathepsin B (Athens Research) was also assayed using these substrates. The peptide-MCA substrates provide β-secretase cleavage site-specific assays. The cleavage sites (indicated by arrows) within the substrates Z-Val-Lys-Met ↓ MCA and Z-Val-Asn-Leu ↓ MCA represent model wild-type β-secretase and Swedish mutant β-secretase cleavage sites of APP, respectively. The three amino acid residues to the left of the arrow represent the amino acid residues adjacent to the N-terminal side of the β-secretase cleavage sites of the WT and Swe APP. Such substrates are routinely used as model peptide substrates, because the residues at the positions adjacent to the N-terminal side of the cleavage site in the peptide (or protein) are important determinants of protease recognition and cleavage of peptide and protein substrates (19Barrett A.

Moreover, the RSV β-secretase activity identified using the WT β-secretase peptide-MCA substrate has also been shown to cleave the peptide bond of the β-secretase site in the larger peptide substrate SEVK ↓ MDAEF, which includes amino acid residues on both the N- and C-terminal sides of the β-secretase site (9Hook V.

Transgenic AD Mice—This study utilized two mouse models of AD, consisting of one expressing human APP containing the WT β-secretase site and mutation at the γ-secretase site (London APP mice) and the other expressing the Swe mutant β-secretase site and the London mutation (Swedish/London APP). London APP was generated using site-directed mutagenesis to insert the V717I London mutation into human APP cDNA. Swedish/London APP was generated by site-directed mutagenesis at the β-secretase site of the London APP to convert Lys-Met to the mutant Asn-Leu. Both AD mouse strains were created in a C57BL/6 mouse background using the Thy-1.2 expression cassette driven by the Thy-1 promoter containing an SV40 polyadenylation site (23Caroni P. J. Neurosci.

Treatment of Transgenic AD Mice with Cysteine Protease Inhibitors—London APP and Swedish/London APP mice (male) were treated at 12 and 6 months of age, respectively. At these ages, the London and Swedish/London APP mice show comparable levels of Aβ with similar pathological and behavioral effects. An ALZET osmotic minipump (model 2004; ALZET) was implanted subcutaneously in the midscapular area of the back of each animal. A catheter was connected to the osmotic minipump and inserted into the lateral ventricle of the brain (icv) (ALZET Brain Infusion Kit 3). CA074Me or E64d (Peptide International) was administered at 1 mg/ml in saline with 1.5% Me2SO (Sigma) at a rate of 0.25 μl/h, corresponding to an estimated dose rate of 0.006 mg/day or 0.013 mg/day-g brain weight, which is a dose below that which causes lipofuscin formation (24Ivy G.O. Schottler F. Wenzel J. Baudry M. Lynch G. Science. 1984; 226: 985-987Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Controls received carrier solution (saline with 1.5% Me2SO). Animals received continuous infusion of inhibitors or carrier for 28 days and were then evaluated in the Morris water maze test. The animals were sacrificed, and half of the brain was prepared for measurement of Aβ40, Aβ42, CTFβ, and sAPPα. The other half of the brain was prepared for histological evaluation of amyloid plaque load. Morris Water Maze Memory Test—The spatial memory capability of each animal was assessed by the Morris water maze test (25Morris R. J. Neurosci. Methods. 1984; 11: 47-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (5710) Google Scholar, 26Liang K.C. Hon W. Tyan Y.M. Liao W.L. Chin. J. Physiol. 1994; 37: 201-212PubMed Google Scholar) (700-0718-4W, SD Instruments). The Morris water maze test evaluates memory in a swimming test. Mice were individually trained in a 1.2-m open field water maze in a pool filled with water to a depth of 30 cm and maintained at 25 °C. An escape platform (10 cm square) was placed 1 cm below the surface of the water. All animals underwent nonspatial pretraining for 3 consecutive days, which prepared the animals for the final behavioral test to determine the retention of memory to find the platform. Two days following the nonspatial pretraining, the hidden platform was placed in the center of one quadrant of the pool, the animal was released facing the pool wall in a random fashion, the time was recorded (latency period), and the distance traveled to reach the platform was measured using video recording (Smart Video Tracking System; SD Instruments). The latency period was also determined for normal wild-type, strain-matched, and age-matched mice (nontransgenic) (n = 3). Preparation of Brain Extracts—Brain extracts were homogenized (1:3 weight/volume of buffer) in buffer of 5 m guanidine HCl in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, plus protease inhibitors (Sigma). Homogenates were diluted to 0.5 m guanidine and centrifuged (200,000 × g for 20 min.), and supernatant and pellet fractions were collected. Protein content was determined by the Bradford method. Analyses of Aβ Peptides—Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) measured Aβ levels. The pellet from the brain extract procedure was sonicated in 6 m guanidine and centrifuged at 200,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was diluted to 0.5 m guanidine. Similarly, the supernatant from the brain extract was brought to 0.5 m guanidine. The two supernatants were combined, and Aβ40 and Aβ42 were determined as previously described (27Deane R. Du Yan S. Submamaryan R.K. LaRue B. Jovanovic S. Hogg E. Welch D. Manness L. Lin C. Yu J. Zhu H. Ghiso J. Frangione B. Stern A. Schmidt A.M. Armstrong D.L. Arnold B. Liliensiek B. Nawroth P. Hofman F. Kindy M.

Neurosci. 2004; 22: 5-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) using ELISA kits specific for each peptide (KHB3481/KHB3441; BIOSOURCE International). The amount of Aβ was calculated as ng of Aβ/g of protein and normalized as a percentage of Aβ in the control group for each experiment. CTFβ and sAPPα Analysis—CTFβ was determined in the pellet fraction from the brain extract by Western blot (antibody A8717; Sigma) as described previously (29Hook V. Kindy M. Hook G. Biol. Chem. 2007; 388: 247-252PubMed Google Scholar). Also, sAPPα was assessed in the supernatant fraction from the brain extract by Western blot (antibody 6E10; Signet Laboratories). Relative amounts of CTFβ and sAPPα bands were assessed by densitometry. Brain Amyloid Plaque Load Analysis—Amyloid load was assessed in brain sections by immunostaining for Aβ (Aβ antibody 10D5 (Elan Pharmaceuticals). Brain tissues were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and then in 4% paraformaldehyde and 30% sucrose for 24 h each at 4 °C. Tissues were washed in Tris-buffered saline and transferred to an O.C.T. medium. Cryosections were blocked with normal serum, incubated with anti-Aβ, and stained with diaminobenzoic acid with the Vector ABC Elite kit (Vector Laboratories). Bright field light microscopy imaged amyloid areas that were quantitated (by NIH Image software). Statistics—Experiments in the London APP mice consisted of eight animals in each of the three treatment groups (24 animals/experiment); experiments were replicated, and data were pooled (48 animals total). The same number of animals and experiments were used for the Swedish/London APP mice experiments. Each biochemical analysis consisted of two or three replicates. Quantitative histology was conducted from eight sections per animal. Statistical analyses utilized software designed for scientific data analysis (Prism 4 GraphPad, San Diego, CA). Animal Use—All animal studies were conducted in accordance with the guidelines and regulations set forth by the National Institutes of Health (Bethesda, MD) using procedures approved by the animal review committee, IACUC, at the Medical University of South Carolina and Veterans Affairs Medical Center (Charleston, SC). Specificity of the RSV β-Secretase Activity for Cleaving the WT β-Secretase Site; Selection of Cysteine Protease Inhibitors—Comparison of the endogenous RSV β-secretase activity for cleaving the WT or Swe mutant β-secretase sites demonstrated the distinct selectivity of the RSV β-secretase activity for the WT β-secretase site, represented by the substrate Z-Val-Lys-Met ↓ MCA (Table 1). The RSV assay showed essentially no activity for cleaving the Swe mutant β-secretase site represented by the substrate Z-Val-Asn-Leu ↓ MCA (mutant residues are underlined) (Table 1). Furthermore, the β-secretase activity purified from RSV, identified as cathepsin B (9Hook V. Toneff T. Bogyo M. Medzihradszky K.F. Nevenu J. Lane W. Hook G. Reisine T. Biol. Chem. 2005; 386: 931-940Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), also showed high selectivity for the WT β-secretase substrate and essentially no activity for the Swe β-secretase substrate (Table 1). The high preference of cathepsin B for the WT β-secretase site was supported by its high catalytic efficiency, indicated by its kcat/Km value of 3.17 × 105 m-1 s-1, which represents a highly active enzyme. Because the majority of AD patients express the WT β-secretase site of APP, the RSV assay is relevant for selection of protease inhibitors of β-secretase for reduction of Aβ.TABLE 1RSV β-secretase activity and cathepsin B selectively cleave the wild-type β-secretase substrate The RSV contain Aβ and APP and were obtained as purified secretory vesicles from bovine adrenal medulla as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The WT β-secretase cleavage site is represented by the substrate Z-Val-Lys-Met ↓ MCA, and the Swe mutant β-secretase cleavage site is represented by the substrate Z-Val-Asn-Leu ↓ MCA (mutant residues are underlined). These cleavage site-specific peptide-MCA substrates were utilized to assess β-secretase activities in the isolated RSV as well as β-secretase activity of cathepsin B.Proteolytic activityRelative activitiesaThe relative β-secretase activities with the two substrates were compared relative to the WT β-secretase substrate as 100%WT β-secretase substrate Z-Val-Lys-Met ↓ MCASwe mutant β-secretase substrate Z-Val-Asn-Leu ↓ MCA%%RSV β-secretase1000.15Cathepsin B1000.04a The relative β-secretase activities with the two substrates were compared relative to the WT β-secretase substrate as 100% Open table in a new tab The compound CA074, a specific inhibitor of cathepsin B (30Yamamoto A.

The cysteine protease inhibitor E64c was also highly effective, with an IC50 value of 15 nm in the RSV assay. Cathepsin B was also potently inhibited by CA074 and E64c, with IC50 values in the nanomolar range (Table 2). These data predicted that the cysteine protease inhibitors selected by the RSV assay would inhibit β-secretase cleavage of the WT β-secretase site, but not the mutant Swedish β-secretase site, for Aβ production. Therefore, cell-permeable forms of these cysteine protease inhibitors, CA074Me and E64d (29Hook V. Kindy M. Hook G. Biol. Chem. 2007; 388: 247-252PubMed Google Scholar, 32Buttle D.J. Murata M.

Animals remained healthy and were observed to have normal eating, body weight, grooming, and general appearance during the inhibitor treatment period. Of the 96 animals used in this study, none showed postoperative complications, such as infections; also, none died. These observations demonstrated that animals remained healthy during inhibitor treatment. Moreover, acute toxic effects were not expected, because E64d was found to be safe for patients in clinical trials for muscular dystrophy (33Satoyoshi E. Intern. Med. 1992; 31: 841-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Significant Improvement in Memory Deficit in London APP Mice Treated with Cysteine Protease Inhibitors—Administration of either CA074Me or E64d caused a significant improvement in the memory deficit of London APP mice, as assessed by the Morris water maze test that measured the latency period and distance traveled to swim to a submerged platform. The mean latency periods for control, CA074Me-treated, and E64d-treated animals were 37, 21, and 17 s, respectively, showing that CA074Me and E64d resulted in a significant reduction in latency period of 43 and 54%, respectively. These results demonstrate that these inhibitors produced substantial improvements in memory deficit (Fig. 1A). The normal, wild-type mice (untreated, nontransgenic, and strain- and age-matched) had a latency period of about 14 s (Fig. 1A). Thus, the reduction in latency period after treatment of London APP mice with the inhibitors approached that of the normal wild-type mice. The mean distances traveled for control, CA074Me-treated, and E64d-treated animals were 238, 141, and 106 cm, respectively, which indicated that CA074Me and E64d caused a significant reduction in the mean distance traveled of 41 and 56%, respectively (Fig. 1B). The mean calculated swimming speed was not significantly different for the treated and control London APP mice (data not shown), and, thus, the shorter latency period and distance traveled caused by the cysteine protease inhibitors were not due to faster swimming. Rather, the shorter latency period and distance traveled demonstrate an improved ability to remember the location of the platform. These data, thus, demonstrate that CA074Me and E64d provide significant improvement in memory deficit in the London APP mice. Reduced Amyloid Plaque Load in London APP Mice Treated with Cysteine Protease Inhibitors—Amyloid plaque load was examined with anti-Aβ compared in brain sections from control, CA074Me-treated, and E64d-treated London APP mice (Figs. 2, A–C, respectively). The CA074Me- and E64d-treated mice showed substantial reduction in total brain amyloid plaque load compared with control, untreated London APP mice. This result was illustrated by quantitative image analyses conducted over the entire brain sections of inhibitor-treated and untreated controls to assess total brain amyloid plaque load (Fig. 2D). Results found that the mean percentage of tissue area of amyloid plaques for the control, CA074Me-treated, and E64d-treated animals was 0.50, 0.22, 0.21% of the tissue area, respectively. These data demonstrate a significant 55% reduction in amyloid plaque load by the CA074Me and E64d inhibitors. These results demonstrate that the significant reduction of amyloid plaque by about one-half is sufficient to result in improved “memory deficit” after treatment of London APP mice with CA074Me or E64d cysteine protease inhibitors. It is noted that treatment with CA074Me or E64d resulted in extensive reduction of amyloid plaque load in the hippocampus region (Fig. 2, B and C) with a more modest reduction in the cortex region of the brain. With icv drug administration, diffusion from the ventricular space may provide greater access to hippocampus than to larger brain regions, such as the cortex (34Strasser J.F. Fung L.K. Eller S. Grossman S.A. Saltzman W.M. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1995; 275: 1647-1655PubMed Google Scholar). Nonetheless, results demonstrate that substantial reduction of amyloid plaque load in total brain occurs during improved “memory deficit” after treatment with CA074Me and E64d inhibitors. Reduced Brain Aβ40 and Aβ42 after Treatment of London APP Mice with Cysteine Protease Inhibitors—Treatment with CA074Me or E64d resulted in significant reductions in brain levels of Aβ40 and Aβ42 compared with untreated controls in the London APP mice. Both inhibitors reduced brain levels of Aβ40 by about 40% (Fig. 3A). Brain levels of Aβ42 were reduced by 40 and 45% in CA074Me- and E64d-treated animals, respectively (Fig. 3B). Thus, CA074Me and E64d reduced Aβ levels in brains of London APP mice.

https://openalex.org/W1980615784,"The bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) family, the largest subfamily of the structurally conserved transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) superfamily of growth factors, are multifunctional regulators of development, proliferation, and differentiation. The TGF-β type III receptor (TβRIII or betaglycan) is an abundant cell surface proteoglycan that has been well characterized as a TGF-β and inhibin receptor. Here we demonstrate that TβRIII functions as a BMP cell surface receptor. TβRIII directly and specifically binds to multiple members of the BMP subfamily, including BMP-2, BMP-4, BMP-7, and GDF-5, with similar kinetics and ligand binding domains as previously identified for TGF-β. TβRIII also enhances ligand binding to the BMP type I receptors, whereas short hairpin RNA-mediated silencing of endogenous TβRIII attenuates BMP-mediated Smad1 phosphorylation. Using a biologically relevant model for TβRIII function, we demonstrate that BMP-2 specifically stimulates TβRIII-mediated epithelial to mesenchymal cell transformation. The ability of TβRIII to serve as a cell surface receptor and mediate BMP, inhibin, and TGF-β signaling suggests a broader role for TβRIII in orchestrating TGF-β superfamily signaling."

Thus, two-point discrimination in vision is limited by the size of individual photoreceptors. Frequency selectivity is a basic property of neurons in the mammalian auditory pathway1,2. However, just-noticeable differences of frequency are substantially smaller than the bandwidth of the peripheral sensors3. Here we report that frequency tuning in single neurons recorded from human auditory cortex in response to random-chord stimuli is far narrower than that typically described in any other mammalian species (besides bats), and substantially exceeds that attributed to the human auditory periphery. Interestingly, simple spectral filter models failed to predict the neuronal responses to natural stimuli, including speech and music. Thus, natural sounds engage additional processing mechanisms beyond the exquisite frequency tuning probed by the random-chord stimuli."

The Elongin BC complex acts as an adaptor that links a substrate recognition subunit to heterodimers of either Cullin 2 (Cul2) and RING finger protein Rbx1 or Cullin 5 (Cul5) and Rbx2. It has been shown (Kamura, T., Maenaka, K., Kotoshiba, S., Matsumoto, M., Kohda, D., Conaway, R. C., Conaway, J. W., and Nakayama, K. I.

Here, we investigate further the mechanisms governing assembly of BC-box proteins with their specific Cul-Rbx modules. Through purification and characterization of a larger collection of BC-box proteins that serve as substrate recognition subunits of Cul2 and Cul5 ubiquitin ligases and through structure-function studies, we define Cul2- and Cul5-boxes in greater detail. Although it previously appeared that there was little sequence similarity between Cul5- and Cul2-box motifs, analyses of newly identified BC-box proteins reveal that residues conserved in the Cul2-box represent a subset of those conserved in the Cul5-box. The sequence motif LPΦP, which is conserved in most Cul5-boxes and has been suggested to specify assembly of Cul5 ligases, is compatible with Cul2 interaction. Finally, the spacing between BC- and Cullin-boxes is much more flexible than has been appreciated and can vary from as few as 3 and as many as ∼80 amino acids. Taken together, our findings shed new light on the mechanisms by which BC-box proteins direct recruitment of Cullin-Rbx modules during reconstitution of ubiquitin ligases.

A growing body of evidence has implicated members of the families of Cullin 2 (Cul2)- and Cullin 5 (Cul5)-containing E3 ubiquitin ligases in regulation of diverse cellular processes including cell signaling, growth, and differentiation (reviewed in Ref. (1Petroski M.D. Deshaies R.J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 6: 9-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (1652) Google Scholar). Cul2 and Cul5 ubiquitin ligases each include the heterodimeric Elongin BC complex, composed of the 112-amino acid Elongin C protein, which is similar in sequence to the Skp1-Cullin1-F box ubiquitin ligase subunit Skp1, and the 118-amino acid Elongin B protein, which includes an N-terminal ubiquitin-like domain and a 34-amino acid C-terminal extension. In the context of Cul2 and Cul5 ubiquitin ligases, the Elongin BC complex functions as an adaptor that links a BC-box substrate recognition subunit to either a Cul2-Rbx1 or a Cul5-Rbx2 module that uses the RING finger domains of the related Rbx1 or Rbx2 proteins to recruit and activate an E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme for ubiquitination of substrates.The founding member of the Cul2 family of E3 ubiquitin ligases is the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) 3The abbreviations used are: VHLVon Hippel-LindauMudPITmultidimensional protein identification technologySOCSsuppressor of cytokine signalingPCMTprotein-l-isoaspartate carboxylmethyltransferase. 3The abbreviations used are: VHLVon Hippel-LindauMudPITmultidimensional protein identification technologySOCSsuppressor of cytokine signalingPCMTprotein-l-isoaspartate carboxylmethyltransferase. tumor suppressor complex (2Pause A.

Structure-function studies of several SOCS-box proteins suggested that the central LPΦP might play a particularly important function as a determinant of Cul5 binding (13Kamura T. Maenaka K. Kotoshiba S. Matsumoto M. Kohda D. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. Nakayama K.I. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 3055-3065Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). Although a region downstream of the BC-box is clearly needed for interaction with Cul2, it has been difficult to define a specific sequence motif that correlates with Cul2 binding because only three BC-box proteins, VHL, LRR1/PPIL5, and FEM1b, that assemble into Cul2 ubiquitin ligases had been identified when this study was initiated. In addition, assembly of Cul5 ubiquitin ligases containing primate lentiviral Vif proteins has been shown to depend critically on a conserved zinc binding motif located upstream of the BC-box (15Mehle A.

FASEB J. 2007; 21: 1742-1750Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar).To define in more detail the primary structural determinants governing assembly of Cul2 and Cul5 ubiquitin ligases, we have purified and characterized a larger collection of BC-box proteins and performed structure-function analyses of sequence motifs responsible for their interactions with Cul2 or Cul5. Here we describe the results of these experiments, which have provided new insights into the nature of the Cul5-box and which have identified a consensus Cul2-box present in a large fraction of BC-box proteins that assemble into Cul2 ubiquitin ligases.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESAntibodies—Mouse monoclonal anti-FLAG M2 antibody was obtained from Sigma, herpes simplex virus tag monoclonal antibody from Novagen, c-Myc monoclonal antibody from Roche Applied Science, rabbit polyclonal anti-Cul-5 (H300) from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, rabbit polyclonal anti-Cul-2 from Zymed Laboratories, and a mouse monoclonal antibody against Elongin C/SIII p15 from BD Transduction Laboratories.Generation and Growth of 293 and M1 Cell Lines Stably Expressing FLAG-tagged Proteins—Full-length cDNAs encoding Elongin B or Elongin BC-associating proteins were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection, subcloned with N-terminal FLAG epitope tags into pcDNA5/FRT (Invitrogen) or the retroviral vector pMXs-neo (18Kitamura T. Koshino Y. Shibata F. Oki T. Nakajima H. Nosaka T. Kumagai H. Exp. Hematol. 2003; 31: 1007-1014Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar), and stably introduced either into Flp-In™ 293 cells (Invitrogen) using the Invitrogen Flp-in™ system or into M1 cells by retroviral infection. 293 cell lines were grown on plates or in roller bottles in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 5% glutamax and 10% fetal bovine serum. M1 cells were grown in flasks or in roller bottles with the same medium as the 293 cells.Transient Transfections—Human embryonic kidney 293T cells grown to ∼50% confluence in 10-cm plates were transiently transfected with pcDNA5/FRT constructs encoding full-length BC-box proteins or various mutants using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were collected 48 h after transfection and processed using the high salt extraction protocol described below. Mutagenesis to generate BC-box, Cul2-box, or Cul5-box mutants was performed using the QuikChange® II XL site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instructions.Anti-FLAG-Agarose Chromatography—To prepare protein samples for mass spectrometry, 293 cells were grown to 70-80% confluence in 4-5 15-cm plates or 1-2 roller bottles. M1 cells were grown in 1-2 roller bottles to a density of ∼106 cells/ml. Cells in plates or roller bottles were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and then lysed by resuspension in lysis buffer (1 ml/plate or 3 ml/roller bottle). Two different protocols were used, a low salt extraction (0.15 m NaCl), low speed centrifugation or a high salt extraction (0.42 m NaCl), high speed centrifugation method. In the low salt extraction, low speed centrifugation method, cells are lysed in 40 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.9, 0.15 m NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.2% Triton X-100, and the cell lysate is spun at 14,000 × g for 30 min in a Beckman-Coulter 5417R refrigerated microfuge. In the high salt extraction, high speed centrifugation method, cells are lysed in 20 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.9, 0.42 m NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.2% Triton X-100, and the cell lysate was spun for 30 min at 40,000 × g in a Beckman-Coulter Optima XL-100K refrigerated ultracentrifuge in a Ti 70.1 rotor. For both methods, supernatants were mixed with anti-FLAG (M2)-agarose beads (Sigma), equilibrated in 10 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.9, 0.2% Triton X-100, 0.3 m NaCl, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, and protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma catalogue number P8340) in a ratio of 100 μl of packed beads/3 ml of supernatant and gently rocked overnight at 4 °C. The beads were washed four times with a 50-fold excess of the same buffer. Proteins were eluted by incubation for 30 min at 4 °C with one packed bead volume of 10 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.9, 0.05% Triton X-100, 0.1 m NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, protease inhibitor mixture, and 0.2 mg/ml FLAG peptide (Sigma). Beads were removed by centrifugation and the elution was repeated an additional two times.Mass Spectrometry and Data Analysis—Identification of proteins in purified samples was accomplished by MudPIT (multidimensional protein identification technology) (19Washburn M.P. Wolters D. Yates III, J.R. Nat. Biotechnol. 2001; 19: 242-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (4054) Google Scholar, 20Wolters D. Washburn M.P. Yates J.R. Anal. Chem. 2001; 73: 5683-5690Crossref PubMed Scopus (1557) Google Scholar). Trichloroacetic acid-precipitated proteins were reduced, alkylated, and digested with endoproteinase LysC and trypsin (Roche Applied Science). Peptide mixtures were applied to a three-phase microcapillary column (21McDonald W.H. Ohi R. Miyamoto D.T. Mitchison T.J. Yates J.R. Int. J. Mass Spectrom. 2002; 219: 245-251Crossref Scopus (266) Google Scholar) and eluted into an LCQ Deca-XP ion trap mass spectrometer equipped with a nano-liquid chromatography electrospray ionization source (ThermoFinnigan) as described (22Florens L. Washburn M.P. Methods Mol. Biol. 2006; 328: 159-175PubMed Google Scholar).SEQUEST (23Eng J.K. McCormick A.L. Yates III, J.R. J. Am. Soc. Mass. Spectrom. 1994; 5: 976-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (5367) Google Scholar) was used to match tandem mass spectra to 82242 amino acid sequences consisting of 40877 Homo sapiens protein sequences downloaded from the National Center for Biotechnology (2006-03-03 release), 177 usual contaminants, 102 custom sequences for epitope-tagged proteins, as well as randomized versions of each non-redundant protein entry to estimate false discovery rates. Spectra/peptide matches were sorted, filtered, and compared using DTASelect/CONTRAST (24Tabb D.L. McDonald W.H. Yates III, J.R. J. Proteome Res. 2002; 1: 21-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (1126) Google Scholar). The chosen selection criteria led to false discovery rates of at most 0.6% (supplemental tables). Normalized spectral abundance factors were calculated as described (25Zybailov B. Mosley A.L. Sardiu M.E. Coleman M.K. Florens L. Washburn M.P. J. Proteome Res. 2006; 5: 2339-2347Crossref PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar).RESULTSIdentification and Characterization of New Members of the Families of Cul2- and Cul5-containing Ubiquitin Ligases—As described above, a major impediment to efforts to define sequence elements that support recruitment of Cul2-Rbx1 rather than Cul5-Rbx2 modules to certain ubiquitin ligases was lack of a sufficient number of known Cul2-containing ubiquitin ligases for derivation of a consensus Cul2-box. At the time this work began, only the VHL tumor suppressor protein and the LRR1 and FEM1B proteins were known to contain functional Cul2-boxes (13Kamura T. Maenaka K. Kotoshiba S. Matsumoto M. Kohda D. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. Nakayama K.I. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 3055-3065Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). Consequently, we sought to identify additional BC-box proteins that contain functional Cul2-boxes.To identify new members of the BC-box family of proteins, we generated human embryonic kidney Flp-In™ 293 and murine lymphoblastic (myeloid leukemia) M1 cell lines stably expressing Elongin B with an N-terminal FLAG epitope tag. FLAG-Elongin B-associating proteins were purified by anti-FLAG-agarose immunoaffinity chromatography from cell lysates prepared from ten independent 293 cell preparations and seven independent M1 cell preparations. Immunopurified Elongin B-associating proteins were then identified by MudPIT mass spectrometry. In a MudPIT mass spectrometry experiment, a mixture of proteins is digested into peptides without prior separation by one- or two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Peptides are then fractionated by two-dimensional chromatography and identified by tandem mass spectrometry. As a control for the specificity of our immunoaffinity purifications, anti-FLAG-agarose eluates from cell lysates of parental 293 and M1 cells not expressing a FLAG-tagged protein were also analyzed by mass spectrometry.As expected, anti-FLAG-agarose eluates from FLAG-Elongin B-expressing 293 and M1 cells contained Elongin B and Elongin C, Cul2, Cul5, Rbx1, and Rbx2. In addition, these eluates contained a collection of additional proteins (supplemental Tables S1-S4).Twenty of these had been previously reported to be BC-box proteins based on data from either biochemical or bioinformatic studies, and about half of these had been shown to be able to assemble into Cul2 or Cul5 ubiquitin ligases (Fig. 1, protein names in bold text). In many of the remaining proteins, we identified short sequences that could be aligned with the BC-boxes of previously described Elongin BC-binding proteins (Fig. 1), suggesting that most of them are likely to bind directly to Elongins B and C and may function as substrate recognition subunits of Cul2 or Cul5 ubiquitin ligases. These new BC-box proteins could be classified into several groups based on the presence of specific structural domains. In addition to new members of the ankyrin repeat-containing and leucine-rich repeat (LRR)-containing families of BC-box proteins, these included proteins containing PCMT (protein-l-isoaspartate carboxylmethyltransferase) domains, KELCH repeats, ZSWIM (SWI2/SNF2 MuDR zinc finger) domains, armadillo repeats, tetratricopeptide repeats, and two proteins containing both LXXLL nuclear receptor binding motifs and domains resembling serine/threonine protein kinase catalytic domains (S_TKc), none of which had previously been found in BC-box proteins (Fig. 2).FIGURE 2Domain organization of some Cul2-box and Cul5-box proteins. The BC-box, Cul2-box, and Cul5-box are represented as black, gray, and hatched boxes, respectively. LRR, leucine-rich repeats; ANK, ankyrin repeats; ARM, armadillo; TPR, tetratricopeptide repeats; K, KELCH domain; PCMT, protein-l-isoaspartate carboxylmethyltransferase; RAB, Rab-like GTPase domain; SII, transcription factor SII-like domain; SH, Src homology 2 phosphotyrosine binding domain; SW, SWIM (SWI2/SNF2 MuDR) zinc fingers; TUB, Tubby-like domain; LXXLL, LXXLL nuclear receptor binding motifs; SPRY, SP1a and ryanodine receptor domain; S_TKc, serine/threonine protein kinase catalytic domain.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To determine whether the putative BC-boxes found in Elongin B-associating proteins were functional, selected candidates were tested for their abilities to bind to the Elongin BC complex when coexpressed with Elongins B and C in 293 cells. As shown in Fig. 3, FLAG-tagged NRBP1 (nuclear receptor-binding protein 1), APPBP2 (amyloid precursor protein-binding protein 2), ZYG11BL, and PCMTD2 all coimmunoprecipitated with Elongins B and C, as did the Elongin BC-binding proteins VHL and FEM1B. Confirming that the putative BC-boxes were important for binding of each protein to Elongins B and C, mutation of key residues in the BC-box motifs of VHL, PCMTD2, FEM1B, ZYG11BL, APPBP2, and NRBP1 interfered with binding of Elongins B and C to each protein (Fig. 3).FIGURE 3BC-box mutations interfere with binding of newly identified Elongin BC-associating proteins to Elongins B and C. Human embryonic kidney 293T cells were co-transfected with pcDNA5 constructs encoding c-Myc-tagged Elongin B, herpes simplex virus-tagged Elongin C, and FLAG-tagged wild type or mutant versions of the indicated proteins. Cells were lysed using the low salt extraction, low speed centrifugation protocol described under “Experimental Procedures.” Proteins were immunoprecipitated using anti-FLAG-agarose, eluted from anti-FLAG beads with FLAG peptide, and subjected to Western blotting with anti-FLAG, anti-c-Myc, or anti-herpes simplex virus antibodies.

Copurifying proteins were identified by MudPIT mass spectrometry. VHL and FEM1B were known to interact with Cul2 (2Pause A. Lee S. Worrell R.A. Chen D.Y.T. Burgess W.H. Linehan W.M. Klausner R.D.

Accordingly, cell lines expressing FLAG-tagged VHL, FEM1B, ASB1, and WSB1 were used as controls in these experiments. The results are summarized in Fig. 4 and in supplemental Table S5.FIGURE 4BC-box proteins and their associated Cullins. MudPIT analyses of immunopurified material from Flp-In™ 293 cell lines stably expressing FLAG-tagged Elongin BC-associating proteins. The numbers shown correspond to the number of spectra detected in MudPIT runs. Detailed supporting data are provided in supplemental Table S5.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)All of the FLAG-tagged proteins analyzed copurified with Elongins B and C. As expected, FLAG-VHL and FLAG-FEM1B copurified with Cul2, whereas the SOCS-box proteins FLAG-ASB1 and FLAG-WSB1 copurified with Cul5. In addition, ASB3, which like ASB1 is a member of the SOCS-box protein family, copurified with Cul5. Of the additional Elongin BC-box proteins that were expressed in 293 cells as FLAG-tagged proteins, PCMTD2 copurified with Cul5 and APPBP2, KLHDC2, KLHDC3, and ZYG11BL copurified with Cul2. Consistent with our observation that ZYG11BL is associated with Cul2, Vasudevan et al. (26Vasudevan S. Starostina N.G. Kipreos E.T. EMBO Rep. 2007; 8: 279-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) recently reported that ZYG11 family members are components of Cul2-containing ubiquitin ligases. Neither FLAG-Muf1, FLAG-Elongin A, nor FLAG-NRBP1 copurified with Cul2 or Cul5. Muf1 was recovered, however, by anti-FLAG-agarose chromatography of lysates from 293 cells stably expressing FLAG-Cul5, as were TULP4 (Tubby-like 4), PCMTD1, and several previously known SOCS-box proteins (supplemental Table S5). Notably, although no Cullin protein copurified with full-length FLAG-Elongin A, two different Elongin A mutants containing functional BC-box motifs but lacking the highly conserved SII-like N-terminal domain copurified with Elongins B and C and with Cul5 (Fig. 4), consistent with our previous observation that a potential Elongin A-containing ubiquitin ligase can be reconstituted in insect cells with Elongins B and C, Cul5, and Rbx1 (7Kamura T.

(14Hilton D.J. Richardson R.T. Alexander W.S. Viney E.M. Willson T.A. Sprigg N.S. Starr R. Nicholson S.E. Metcalf D. Nicola N.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Conaway J.W. Nakayama K.I. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 3055-3065Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). In all previously described SOCS-box proteins, the Cul5-box is located immediately C-terminal to the BC-box. Comparison of newly identified BC-box proteins that assemble with Cul5 revealed that they all included an easily recognizable Cul5-box. Surprisingly, however, the Cul5-box in two of them, PCMTD1 and PCMTD2, is located ∼90 amino acids downstream of the BC-box.Although sequences downstream of the BC-box have been shown to be needed for interaction with Cul2, it has been difficult to define a specific sequence motif that correlates with Cul2 binding (13Kamura T.

In an effort to identify such a sequence motif, we generated a multiple sequence alignment of VHL, MED8, PPIL5 (LRR1), and FEM1B with Cul2-interacting BC-box proteins ZYG11BL, APPBP2, KLHDC2, and KLHDC3 from several species.

Unfortunately, effective treatments are not currently available for many important diseases caused by NV and related RNA viruses. The virally encoded RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) is the central enzyme required for replication (2Ortin J. Parra F. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2006; 60: 305-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) and is one of the key targets for the development of novel antiviral agents. Recently, 5-nitrocytidine triphosphate (NCT) was identified as a potent inhibitor of picornaviral polymerases, and the nucleoside 5-nitrocytidine was found to have low toxicity and significant antiviral activity in a cultured cell viral infection model (3Harki D.A. Graci J.D. Galarraga J.E. Chain W.J. Cameron C.E. Peterson B.R. J. Med. Chem. 2006; 49: 6166-6169Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). A structural and mechanistic basis for rationalizing the inhibitory activity of NCT and related inhibitors is currently lacking because of a shortage of high resolution structural information on RdRP replication complexes.

Details on the structure and mechanism of viral RdRPs are clearly required to understand the replication of RNA viruses and to develop more effective antiviral agents. Previous structural studies of viral RdRPs from positive strand RNA viruses and double-strand RNA viruses indicate that the general features of RdRP architecture are highly conserved throughout a diverse range of viruses (reviewed in Refs. 2Ortin J. Parra F. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2006; 60: 305-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar and 4Ferrer-Orta C. Arias A. Escarmis C. Verdaguer N. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2006; 16: 27-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). The three-dimensional arrangement of N-terminal, fingers, palm, and thumb domains, as well as the active site residues in motifs A–F are nearly universally shared (5Bruenn J.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 1821-1829Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). The structural conservation seen in RdRPs suggests that the enzymatic mechanism of nucleotidyl transfer is also highly conserved. Studies primarily on poliovirus RdRP have revealed many of the basic features underlying the nucleotidyl transfer reaction in RdRPs (6Cameron C.E. Gohara D.W. Arnold J.J. Semler B. Wimmer E. Molecular Biology of Picornaviruses. ASM Press, Washington, DC2002: 255-267Google Scholar, 7Castro C. Smidansky E. Maksimchuk K.R. Arnold J.J. Korneeva V.S. Gotte M. Konigsberg W. Cameron C.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 4267-4272Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). These studies and others indicate that RdRPs, like other polynucleotide polymerases, follow a five-step reaction cycle involving (i) the binding of an NTP complementary to the base of the template to form an initial “open” complex, followed by (ii) a conformational change to the “closed” complex, (iii) nucleotidyl transfer and translocation, (iv) a second conformational change, and finally (v) the release of pyrophosphate (see Fig. 1). Experimentally determined structural information is clearly needed to corroborate and further elaborate the different states identified from kinetic studies, but trapping these different states has proven to be very challenging in RdRPs and other polymerases. Crystal structures of RdRP·RNA·NTP complexes from reovirus (8Tao Y. Farsetta D.L. Nibert M.L. Harrison S.C. Cell. 2002; 111: 733-745Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar) and foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) (9Ferrer-Orta C. Arias A. Perez-Luque R. Escarmis C. Domingo E. Verdaguer N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 9463-9468Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) have revealed important aspects of RNA and NTP binding, but key details of the closed catalytic complex formed in step iii remain poorly determined. The reovirus RdRP·RNA·GTP initiation complex (Protein Data Bank code 1N1H) contains two divalent metal ions at the active site and the NTP bound near the RNA primer terminus. Unfortunately, the 2.8-Å diffraction limit prevents a detailed analysis of molecular conformation, hydrogen bonding, and water structure at the active site. The FMDV structures were determined at a similar resolution (2.5–3.0 Å) and appear to be open complexes trapped at steps ii or v. The NTP is bound too far from the primer terminus for the nucleotidyl transfer reaction to occur in the open complexes, and one of the two divalent metal ions needed for the two-metal ion mechanism of catalysis (10Steitz T.A. Nature. 1998; 391: 231-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar) is missing from the active site. To provide a more detailed structural basis for understanding the nucleotidyl transfer reaction in viral RdRPs, we have determined high resolution structures of NV RdRP bound to a self-complementary oligonucleotide (5′-UGCCCGGG-3′), two Mn2+ ions, and either the natural substrate CTP or the nucleotide inhibitor NCT. These structures reveal for the first time details of ternary RdRP·RNA·NTP complexes trapped immediately prior to the nucleotidyl transfer reaction (the closed complex iii in Fig. 1A). Comparisons of the structures of the CTP and NCT complexes also suggest a novel mechanism for inhibition that may be exploited for the design of more effective antiviral agents. Synthesis of 5-Nitrocytidine Triphosphate (NCT) and RNA—NCT was synthesized as previously described (3Harki D.A. Graci J.D. Galarraga J.E. Chain W.J. Cameron C.E. Peterson B.R. J. Med. Chem. 2006; 49: 6166-6169Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The 5′-UGCCCGGG-3′ sequence was synthesized by the University of Calgary Core DNA Services facility (University of Calgary). The desalted oligonucleotide was dissolved at a concentration of 3.5 mm RNA duplex (7 mm single-stranded RNA) in 1 mm sodium citrate, pH 6.2, 50 mm potassium chloride. To anneal the self-complementary oligonucleotide into a duplex form, the oligonucleotide was heated to 80 °C and cooled at the rate of 5 °C/min using a thermocycler. Expression and Purification of NV Polymerase—NV polymerase was expressed and purified as previously described (11Ng K.K. Pendas-Franco N. Rojo J. Boga J.A. Machin A. Alonso J.M. Parra F. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 16638-16645Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), except for the following modifications. 1-Liter cultures of Escherichia coli XL1-Blue transformed with pGEX-NV-3D were induced with 0.2 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside and then grown at 25 °C for 20 h. The cells were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in 30 ml of buffer A (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.25 mm EDTA). The cells were lysed by sonication in the presence of lysozyme and DNase I. The concentration of sodium chloride was then raised to 0.3 m, and polyethylenimine (Sigma) was added dropwise to a final concentration of 0.1% (w/v) to help remove nucleic acids. The extract was clarified by centrifugation and loaded sequentially onto two 2-ml columns of glutathione-Sepharose 4B (GE Healthcare) equilibrated in buffer B (20 mm Tris-Cl, 450 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 4 mm DTT). The columns were washed with 50 ml buffer of B and 20 ml of buffer C (25 mm Na-HEPES, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 4 mm DTT, and 10% glycerol). Thrombin (20 units, GE Healthcare) was diluted into 1 ml of buffer C and incubated for 90 min with each of the two 2-ml columns of glutathione-Sepharose. Each column was eluted with 10 ml of buffer C, and the thrombin was inactivated with 0.5 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl) benzenesulfonyl fluoride. The digestion was repeated for each column, and all of the eluates were pooled. The pooled eluates were dialyzed overnight against 1 liter of buffer D (25 mm Na-HEPES, pH 7.0, 25 mm of NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 4 mm DTT, and 15% glycerol) and then loaded onto a 5-ml HiTrap SP-Sepharose column. The column was washed with 30 ml of buffer D containing 30 mm NaCl, and NV polymerase was eluted with an 80-ml linear gradient of buffer D containing 30–150 mm NaCl. Peak fractions were diluted with RNase-free buffer E (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 15% glycerol (Fluka)) to reduce the NaCl concentration to 20 mm and loaded onto a Sartobind Q15F filter (Sartorius). The filter was washed with buffer E and eluted with RNase-free buffer F (10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 6 mm DTT, and 15% glycerol). NV polymerase was diluted into buffer G (10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 6 mm DTT, and 15% glycerol) and concentrated with an Amicon Ultrafree-4 (10,000 molecular weight cut-off) centrifugal filter to 7.5 mg/ml (0.13 mm, concentration estimated by UV absorption using a calculated extinction coefficient of 1.43 OD/(mg/ml)). NV polymerase was filtered with a 0.22-μm Spin-X cellulose acetate centrifugal filter (Costar) and stored on ice. Crystallization—CHAPS (0.2% w/v) and Superase-In ribonuclease inhibitor (1 unit/μl; Ambion) were added to NV polymerase prior to crystallization. The annealed RNA duplex (18 μl) was mixed with 4.5 μl of NCT or CTP (25 mm) and 31.5 μl water to prepare a mixture containing 1.16 mm RNA duplex and 2.1 mm NTP. A reservoir solution containing 16% polyethylene glycol 8000, 25% glycerol, 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 50 mm KCl, 4 mm MgCl2, 10 mm MnCl2, and 0.1% 2-mercaptoethanol was prepared. Reservoir solution (3 μl) was mixed with the RNA-NTP mixture (6 μl) and NV polymerase (4 μl). This mixture was suspended as a hanging drop and equilibrated against 1 ml of reservoir solution at 22 °C. Crystals appeared within a week and grew to full size (∼0.2 × 0.1 × 0.05 mm) after 2–3 weeks. Crystal Structure Determination—A single crystal (0.2 × 0.1 × 0.05 mm) grown in the presence of NCT was quickly mounted in a polymer fiber loop (Hampton Research) and flash-cooled in a nitrogen gas stream at ∼100 K. Diffraction data were initially measured using a MAR 345 image plate and X-rays produced with a rotating copper anode (Rigaku RUH3R). The crystal was stored in liquid nitrogen and transferred to the Canadian Light Source beamline 08ID-1 for data collection using a Marmosaic CCD225 detector. The data were processed and scaled using XDS (12Kabsch W. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 795-800Crossref Scopus (3225) Google Scholar) (data quality and refinement statistics are given in Table 1). The structure of unliganded NV polymerase (Protein Data Bank code 1SH0) was used as the search model for molecular replacement calculations using PHASER (13Read R.J. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 1373-1382Crossref PubMed Scopus (785) Google Scholar). Very clear solutions were obtained for the rotational (z = 20.8) and translational (z = 26.3) placement of a single polymerase molecule, yielding a solvent content of 59% and Vm = 3.0. Initial electron density maps clearly indicated that an RNA duplex, metal ions, and NTP were present. Initial maps also showed that the C-terminal segment was missing and that residues 437–452 in the thumb domain needed to be rebuilt. A model for the RNA segment was built with reference to the FMDV·RNA complexes and high resolution RNA helices deposited in the NDB. Coot (14Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (23226) Google Scholar) and MI-Fit (15McRee D.E. J. Struct.

Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13854) Google Scholar) was used for refinement. The electron density maps clearly showed the incorporation of a single NCT residue in the distal end of the primer-template duplex bound to NV RdRP. This residue must have been added by the polymerase onto this end of the primer, and the extended primer-template duplex must have dissociated from the enzyme before it rebound NV RdRP and crystallized. At the conclusion of refinement, residues 1–4, 467–471, and 489–510 were not modeled, presumably because of the presence of disorder.TABLE 1Crystallographic statisticsNCT complex (3BSN)CTP complex (3BSO)Data collection Space groupP212121P212121 Unit cell lengths (Å)a = 74.3, b = 93.9, c = 96.0 Åa = 75.1, b = 93.5, c = 96.5 Å Wavelength (Å)0.979341.11587 Resolution (Å)30-1.840-1.74 High resolution (Å)1.97-1.801.80-1.74 Total reflectionsaThe values from the outermost resolution shell are given in parentheses283615 (49434)262319 (19967) Unique reflectionsaThe values from the outermost resolution shell are given in parentheses58959 (11566)69074 (6276) Completeness (%)aThe values from the outermost resolution shell are given in parentheses93.6 (78.3)98.1 (90.5) I/σaThe values from the outermost resolution shell are given in parentheses13.7 (2.3)29.2 (2.0) RsymaThe values from the outermost resolution shell are given in parentheses,bΣhΣi(|Ii(h) – <I(h)>|)/ΣhΣiIi(h), where Ii(h) is the ith integrated intensity of a given reflection and <I(h)> is the weighted mean of all measurements of I(h)0.079 (0.614)0.045 (0.436)Refinement RworkcΣh||F(h)o| – |F(h)c||/Σh|F(h)o| for the 95% of reflection data used in refinement0.201 (0.314)0.201 (0.258) RfreedΣh||F(h)o| – |F(h)c||/Σh|F(h)o| for the 5% of reflection data excluded from refinement0.236 (0.360)0.232 (0.301) Number of atoms Protein37623762 RNA + NTP393373 Solvent and Ions374422 Root mean square deviations from ideal geometry Bond lengths (Å)0.0060.007 Bond angles (°)1.001.06 Average temperature factors (Å2) Wilson plot24.834.8 Protein30.137.7 RNA31.139.5 Water36.844.6 Ramachandran plot (% in regions defined by Procheck (18)) Most favored94.192.6 Additional allowed5.97.2 Generously allowed0.00.2 Disallowed0.00.0a The values from the outermost resolution shell are given in parenthesesb ΣhΣi(|Ii(h) – <I(h)>|)/ΣhΣiIi(h), where Ii(h) is the ith integrated intensity of a given reflection and <I(h)> is the weighted mean of all measurements of I(h)c Σh||F(h)o| – |F(h)c||/Σh|F(h)o| for the 95% of reflection data used in refinementd Σh||F(h)o| – |F(h)c||/Σh|F(h)o| for the 5% of reflection data excluded from refinement Open table in a new tab Diffraction data were also measured for a crystal (0.3 × 0.15 × 0.08 mm) grown in the presence of CTP and flash-cooled to ∼100 K as described for the NCT complex. A complete data set was initially measured using the laboratory Mar345 image plate detector and rotating copper anode x-ray generator (Rigaku RUH3R) before the crystal was transferred to the Advanced Light Source beamline 8.3.1 for data collection using an ADSC Q-315 detector. The data were processed and scaled using the HKL Suite (17Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38526) Google Scholar). The refined structure of the NCT complex was used as a starting model for the refinement of the CTP complex. The nitro group of the bound nucleotide and the nitro group of the nucleotide incorporated into the distal end of the primer-template duplex were removed from the model, because these moieties were clearly absent in electron density maps. The quality of geometric parameters was evaluated by Procheck (18Morris A.L. MacArthur M.W. Hutchinson E.G. Thornton J.M. Proteins. 1992; 12: 345-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (1402) Google Scholar). Overall Structure of NV RdRP·RNA·NTP Complexes—Ternary complexes of NV RdRP reveal an RNA primer-template duplex and NTP bound in the active site cleft (Figs. 1B and 2). As predicted previously, RNA binding displaces the C-terminal tail from the active site cleft of NV RdRP (11Ng K.K. Pendas-Franco N. Rojo J. Boga J.A. Machin A. Alonso J.M. Parra F. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 16638-16645Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Residues 489–516 are not defined by electron density, suggesting that the C-terminal tail is unstructured. The binding of RNA also causes the central helix of the thumb domain (residues 435–449) to rotate by 22°, thus inducing the formation of a binding groove for the primer strand (Fig. 2). The rotation of this helix appears to be coupled to the movement of the C-terminal tail away from the active site cleft. In the unbound conformation of NV and Sapovirus RdRPs, the proximal portion of the C-terminal tail (residues 489–502 in NV) packs against this central helix, acting as a brace to resist the outward rotation of the helix seen in the RNA-bound conformation (11Ng K.K.

The movement of the C-terminal tail away from the active site cleft allows the central helix the room to rotate and interact with the primer strand and minor groove of the primer-template duplex. These conformational changes are reminiscent of changes seen in DNA polymerases following the binding of DNA and dNTPs (20Rothwell P.J. Waksman G. Adv. Protein Chem. 2005; 71: 401-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar) and are larger than the conformational changes previously seen in viral RdRPs crystallized in different packing environments (21Ng K.K.

James M.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 18202-18210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). The conformational changes seen in the NV RdRP·RNA·NTP complex are also much larger than the changes seen in the FMDV RdRP·RNA·NTP complexes, in which the conformation of the RdRP is nearly identical to the unbound form (9Ferrer-Orta C. Arias A. Perez-Luque R. Escarmis C. Domingo E. Verdaguer N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 9463-9468Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). This observation, in combination with the modes of binding observed for divalent metal cations and NTPs in the FMDV complexes, further suggest that the NV RdRP·RNA·NTP complex is a closed complex trapped immediately prior to catalysis, whereas the FMDV complexes are open complexes trapped at earlier or later steps of the reaction cycle. Interactions between RdRP, RNA, NTPs, and Metal Ions at the Active Site—The structures of the NV RdRP NCT and CTP complexes provide the first high resolution views of RdRP complexes trapped immediately before nucleotidyl transfer. Indirect effects from crystal packing appear to have fortuitously trapped these complexes at this stage of the reaction cycle. The distal end of the primer-template duplex is located near a symmetry-related polymerase molecule, and there is insufficient space for primer extension to occur in this crystal form. As a result, polymerase molecules in this crystal form bind substrates and assemble active complexes that can only proceed up to the point immediately prior to nucleotidyl transfer. The intricate network of interactions surrounding the bound nucleotide reveals at high resolution several key elements underlying substrate binding and catalysis in RdRPs (Fig. 3). The NTP bases form hydrogen bonds with the complementary guanosine base of the template and stack against the 3′-terminal base of the primer, as well as the Arg-182 guanidino group (Fig. 3). Arg-182 is highly conserved in RdRPs (Motif F3) (5Bruenn J.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 1821-1829Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar) and is near the NTP α-phosphate (3.5 Å). Arg residues occupy a similar position in all viral RdRPs with known structures, as well as distantly related enzymes like HIV reverse transcriptase (Table 2). The cytosine and nitrocytosine bases stack tightly against Arg-182, unlike the looser interactions seen in the more open FMDV complexes (9Ferrer-Orta C. Arias A. Perez-Luque R. Escarmis C. Domingo E. Verdaguer N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 9463-9468Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar).TABLE 2Motif F3 in RdRPs and HIV reverse transcriptase with known three-dimensional structuresVirusGenomeFamilyProtein Data Bank codeStartEndF3 motifNVssRNA(+)Caliciviridae1SH0179184IKKRLLRHDVssRNA(+)Caliciviridae1KHW185190GKKRLLSVssRNA(+)Caliciviridae2CKW179184GKRRLLPVssRNA(+)Picornaviridae2IM0171176GKSRLIHRVssRNA(+)Picornaviridae1TP7171176GKTRVIFMDVssRNA(+)Picornaviridae1U09176181GKTRIVHCVssRNA(+)Flaviviridae1CSJ155160KPARLIDENVssRNA(+)Flaviviridae2J7U203208KGSRAIWNVssRNA(+)Flaviviridae2HCN161166KGSRAIBVDVssRNA(+)Flaviviridae1S48212217KRPRVIIBDVdsRNABirnaviridae2PGG302307TKTRNIPhi6dsRNACystoviridae1HHS267272ERRRTAReovirusdsRNAReoviridae1N35523528RRPRSIHIVssRNA-RT(+)Retroviridae1RTD6974TKWRKL Open table in a new tab The interactions made by the ribose and triphosphate moieties of the bound nucleotide indicate that the NV RdRP complexes are perfectly positioned for nucleotidyl transfer (Fig. 3). The 2′-OH accepts a hydrogen bond from Asn-309 and donates a hydrogen bond to Ser-300, which in turn donates a hydrogen bond to Asp-247. This pattern of hydrogen bonding reveals how these highly conserved residues (equivalent to poliovirus RdRP residues 297, 288, and 238, respectively) distinguish ribonucleotides from 2′-deoxyribonucleotides (24Gohara D.W.

Farsetta D.L. Nibert M.L. Harrison S.C. Cell. 2002; 111: 733-745Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar), but the more open FMDV complexes or binary poliovirus RdRP·NTP complexes do not form the same hydrogen-bonding pattern, suggesting that ribonucleotide selection occurs in the closed complex formed immediately before catalysis (9Ferrer-Orta C. Arias A. Perez-Luque R. Escarmis C. Domingo E. Verdaguer N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 9463-9468Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 27Thompson A.A. Albertini R.A. Peersen O.B. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 366: 1459-1474Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Two Mn2+ ions also coordinate to three highly conserved Asp residues and the NTP triphosphate moiety to mediate catalysis through the two-metal-ion mechanism (10Steitz T.A. Nature. 1998; 391: 231-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar, 28Vazquez A.L. Alonso J.M. Parra F. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 3888-3891Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3). Metal ion A octahedrally coordinates to the 3′-OH nucleophile of the primer, the NTP α-phosphate, the carboxylate groups of Asp-242, Asp-343, and Asp-344, as well as a water molecule. By donating hydrogen bonds to the negatively charged primer phosphodiester and NTP α-phosphate groups, this water molecule may be activated to become a better general base catalyst (7Castro C. Smidansky E. Maksimchuk K.R. Arnold J.J. Korneeva V.S. Gotte M. Konigsberg W. Cameron C.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 4267-4272Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), thus allowing it to abstract a proton from the primer 3′-OH (2.8 Å away) following a mechanism similar to that proposed for DNA polymerase β (29Batra V.K. Beard W.A. Shock D.D. Krahn J.M. Pedersen L.C. Wilson S.H. Structure. 2006; 14: 757-766Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 30Alberts I.L. Wang Y. Schlick T. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2007; 129: 11100-11110Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Metal ion B also octahedrally coordinates to the side chain carboxylate groups of Asp-242 and Asp-343, the main chain carbonyl group of Tyr-243, as well as a single oxygen atom from each of the α, β, and γ phosphate groups of the NTP. Trapping of a Preinsertion Conformation of NV RdRP via Constraints from Crystal Packing—The recombinant form of NV RdRP used in these studies is enzymatically active (11Ng K.K. Pendas-Franco N. Rojo J. Boga J.A. Machin A. Alonso J.M. Parra F. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 16638-16645Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), and there is surprisingly clear evidence of this activity in the crystal structure itself. Because the primer-template oligonucleotide is self-complementary and symmetrical, each oligonucleotide duplex contains two 5′-overhangs where primer extension can occur. In the NV RdRP·RNA·NTP complexes, the end of the duplex found in the enzyme active site reveals the presence of a 3′-terminal guanosine residue in the primer and a 3′-GU-5′ sequence for the single-stranded 5′-overhang of the template strand. CTP or NCT forms a Watson-Crick base pair with the guanosine residue of the template, but crystal packing interactions at the distal end of the primer-template duplex appear to impede the translocation event following nucleotidyl transfer, thus trapping this complex. Surprisingly, the end of the primer-template duplex that is located distal from the active site reveals that either a cytidine or 5-nitrocytidine residue has been added to the primer strand, presumably prior to crystallization. This residue must have been added when this end of the duplex was bound at the active site. Following the addition of this single residue, the duplex must have dissociated from the enzyme and bound in the opposite orientation prior to crystallization. The packing arrangement of molecules in this crystal form appears to be critical for arresting the normal reaction cycle of NV RdRP at the point immediately prior to nucleotidyl transfer. Previous studies on a wide range of polynucleotide polymerases indicate the necessity of a translocation step immediately following nucleotidyl transfer (20Rothwell P.J. Waksman G. Adv. Protein Chem. 2005; 71: 401-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). All of the previously determined crystal structures of polymerases trapped at this preinsertion step of the reaction cycle have been chemically trapped by the use of substrate analogues like primer strands missing the 3′-hydroxyl group or a nucleoside 5′-(α,β)-imidotriphosphate analogue (29Batra V.K.

Rev. 2006; 106: 361-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Such complexes provide a valuable but slightly distorted view of the natural complex. The fortuitous molecular packing arrangement in the NV RdRP·RNA·NTP crystal form has allowed us to trap a critical intermediate in the reaction cycle without introducing distortions through chemical modifications. The most similar, active polymerase complex for which a high resolution structure has been previously determined is the DNA polymerase β·DNA·2′-deoxyuridine-5′-[(α,β)-imido]triphosphate complex determined to 1.65 Å resolution (29Batra V.K. Beard W.A. Shock D.D. Krahn J.M. Pedersen L.C. Wilson S.H. Structure. 2006; 14: 757-766Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). The trapped catalytic complex seen in DNA polymerase β closely resembles the NV RdRP ternary complex, including the presence of water molecules that may participate in catalysis. A Novel and General Mechanism of RdRP Inhibition by NCT—The structure of the NCT complex suggests a novel mechanism of inhibition. The nitro group is 2.7 Å from the NCT α-phosphate and 4.3 Å from the 3′-OH nucleophile of the primer. If the pentavalent transition state forms halfway between the ground state positions of the 3′-OH nucleophile and the α-phosphate electrophile, the proximity of the negatively charged nitro group (∼3 Å) to the negatively charged oxygen atoms of the transition state could destabilize the transition state of the nucleotidyl transfer reaction. The stacking of Arg-182 and the 3′-end of the primer against the NTP base, as well as base-pairing interactions with the template strand all act to fix the position of the NTP base, thus keeping the nitro group close to the negatively charged transition state. Finally, the nitro group displaces a water molecule that forms hydrogen bonds with the α-phosphate of CTP and the 3′-terminal phosphodiester of the primer in the ground state. Loss of this water molecule in the NCT complex could further destabilize the transition state by reducing hydration. Apart from the positioning of the nitro group and displacement of a water molecule from the vicinity of the reaction pathway, there are a few additional differences between the CTP and NCT complexes that may also contribute to the mechanism of inhibition of NCT. One important difference is a longer than expected coordination distance of 2.6 Å between Asp-344 and metal ion A in the NCT complex, when compared with the expected distance of 2.1 Å seen in the CTP complex (Fig. 3). The structures of the two complexes do not indicate a direct connection between the presence of the nitro group of NCT and effects on metal ion coordination. If this altered coordination geometry is an indirect effect of the nitro group from NCT, however, then this longer coordination distance may be related to an impairment of the nucleotidyl transfer reaction. A second difference between the NCT and CTP complexes is the positioning of the side chain of Arg-182 (Fig. 3). The χ4 torsion angle of Arg-182 differs by 180° between the conformation adopted in the NCT and CTP complexes. As a result, the conformation adopted in the NCT complex appears to form better π-stacking and electrostatic interactions with the nitro group (Fig. 3). The guanidino group of the side chain in both complexes forms good stacking interactions with the central portion of the base. Because the guanidino group is closer to the nitro group in the NCT complex, however, this group is farther from the β-phosphate than in the CTP complex. As a result, the Nϵ atom of Arg-182 forms a water-mediated hydrogen bond with the β-phosphate in the NCT complex, and one of the terminal nitrogen atoms forms a direct hydrogen bond with the oxygen atom bridging the α- and β-phosphates. In the CTP complex, however, the two terminal nitrogen atoms of Arg-182 form direct hydrogen bonds with the oxygen atom bridging the α- and β-phosphates, as well as a nonbridging oxygen atom on the β-phosphate. By altering the position of the guanidino group relative to the triphosphate moiety, the 5-nitro group may reduce the ability of Arg-182 to stabilize the pyrophosphate leaving group during the course of nucleotidyl transfer. The mechanism of inhibition suggested by the structure of the NCT complex provides a general, new approach for inhibitor design. Large, negatively charged substituents at the 5- and 6-positions of pyrimidine bases may be effective at destabilizing the transition state without disturbing essential substrate binding interactions. Effective inhibitors should preserve favorable π-stacking and electrostatic interactions with the primer and Arg-182, as well as base pairing with the template. Substituents like the 5-nitro group that interact well with Arg-182 may bind viral RdRPs more effectively than host polymerases, because Arg is almost universally conserved at this position in viral RdRPs, but Arg is not conserved at this position in any of the family A, B, and Y DNA polymerases, eukaryotic RdRPs, and phage, prokaryotic, and eukaryotic DNA-dependent RNA polymerases. A neutral aromatic residue seems to occupy this position in most other polymerases. The NV RdRP·RNA·NTP complexes reveal for the first time several structural features underlying the nucleotidyl transfer reaction that may be exploited for developing novel antiviral inhibitors. The synthesis and evaluation of novel inhibitors will provide powerful and practical tests for the mechanisms proposed in this paper. We thank Dr. Isabelle Barrette-Ng for helpful discussions. We appreciate the support of the University of Calgary Core DNA Services oligonucleotide synthesis facility in providing us with the wide range of high quality RNA oligonucleotides required for this study and preliminary work."

Here we report hemin transfer from hemin-containing IsdA (holo-IsdA) to hemin-free IsdC (apo-IsdC). The reaction has an equilibrium constant of 10 ± 5 at 22 °C in favor of holo-IsdC formation. During the reaction, holo-IsdA binds to apo-IsdC and then transfers the cofactor to apo-IsdC with a rate constant of 54.3 ± 1.8 s–1 at 25 °C. The transfer rate is >70,000 times greater than the rate of simple hemin dissociation from holo-IsdA into solvent (ktransfer = 54.3 s–1 versus k–hemin = 0.00076 s–1). The standard free energy change, ΔG0, is –27 kJ/mol for the formation of the holo-IsdA-apo-IsdC complex. IsdC has a higher affinity for hemin than IsdA. These results indicate that the IsdA-to-IsdC hemin transfer is through the activated holo-IsdA-apo-IsdC complex and is driven by the higher affinity of apo-IsdC for the cofactor. These findings demonstrate for the first time in the Isd system that heme transfer is rapid, direct, and affinity-driven from IsdA to IsdC. These results also provide the first example of heme transfer from one surface protein to another surface protein in Gram-positive bacteria and, perhaps most importantly, indicate that the mechanism of activated heme transfer, which we previously demonstrated between the streptococcal proteins Shp and HtsA, may apply in general to all bacterial heme transport systems.

The surface protein components, Shr and Shp of the GAS acquisition machinery and IsdA, IsdB, IsdH, and IsdC of the S. aureus system, do not share significant sequence homology. Thus, the S. pyogenes and S. aureus systems represent two distinct heme acquisition pathways in Gram-positive bacteria. The S. pyogenes system has a homologue in S. equi (9Nygaard T.K. Liu M. McClure M.J. Lei B. BMC Microbiol. 2006; 6: 82Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), whereas the homologue of the S. aureus system is present in B. anthracis (12Maresso A.W. Chapa T.J. Schneewind O. J. Bacteriol. 2006; 188: 8145-8152Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar).

Previous characterization of the Isd system from S. aureus indicated that the system takes up hemin as an iron source (11Mazmanian S.K. Skaar E.P. Gaspar A.H. Humayun M. Gornicki P. Jelenska J. Joachmiak A. Missiakas D.M. Schneewind O. Science. 2003; 299: 906-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). IsdB is a hemoglobin receptor and is required for uptake of hemin from methemoglobin (21Torres V.J. Pishchany G. Humayun M. Schneewind O. Skaar E.P. J.

It has been proposed that IsdH and IsdB capture haptoglobin-hemoglobin and hemoglobin, respectively, and heme is transferred from bound hemoglobin to IsdA, then IsdC, and finally to ABC transporters IsdDEF and/or HtsABC (25Maresso A.W. Schneewind O. Biometals. 2006; 19: 193-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 26Reniere M.L. Torres V.J. Skaar E.P. Biometals. 2007; 20: 333-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). This hypothesis has not been experimentally tested, and little is known about the biochemical mechanism of heme acquisition by this system. This study describes the rapid and direct hemin transfer from holo-IsdA to heme-free IsdC (apo-IsdC). This affinity-driven transfer occurs in two steps, the formation of a holo-IsdA-apo-IsdC complex and subsequent hemin transfer. This study not only unveils the first hemin transfer reaction of the Isd system but also documents the first example of hemin transfer from one surface protein to another surface protein in Gram-positive bacteria. Gene Cloning—The isdA and isdC genes were PCR-cloned from S. aureus subsp. aureus MW2 using paired primers 5′-TACCATGGACAGCCAACAAGTCAATGCG-3′/5′-TGAATTCTTAAGTTTTTGGTAATTGTTTAGC-3′ and 5′-ACCATGGATAGCGGTACTTTGAATTATG-3′/5′-AGAATTCTTATGTTTGTGGATTTTCTACTTTGTC-3′, respectively. The isdA and isdC PCR products were digested with NcoI/EcoRI and cloned into pET-His2 (6Lei B. Liu M. Voyich J.M. Prater C.I. Kala S.V. DeLeo F.R. Musser J.M. Infect. Immun. 2003; 71: 5962-5969Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) at the same sites, yielding pISDA and pISDC. Recombinant IsdA and IsdC proteins produced from the constructs had 11 amino acid residues (MHHHHHHLETM) fused to Asp-30 and Asp-40, respectively, and lacked their transmembrane domain and charged tail at the C terminus (amino acids 317–350 and 193–227 for IsdA and IsdC, respectively). Both gene clones were sequenced to rule out spurious mutations. Protein Purification—Both IsdA and IsdC were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) containing pISDA and pISDC, respectively. Bacteria were grown at 37 °C in 6 liters of Luria-Bertani broth supplemented with 100 mg/liter ampicillin to an absorbance at 600 nm of about 1.0, and the production of the proteins were induced by 0.4 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 6 h. Bacteria were harvested by centrifugation. The bacterial pellet was suspended in 60 ml of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and sonicated on ice for 15 min. IsdA and IsdC in the lysate were purified according to the manufacturer's protocol using a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose column. Preparation of Apo-IsdA and Apo-IsdC—Purified recombinant IsdC was a mixture of apo-form and a complex with iron-free protoporphyrin. To prepare apo-IsdC, the mixture in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, was loaded onto a DEAE-Sepharose column (1.5 × 5 cm). Apo-IsdC was eluted with 30 mm NaCl in Tris-HCl, dialyzed against 3 liters of Tris-HCl. Apo-IsdA was prepared using the methyl ethyl ketone method (27Ascoli F. Fanelli M.R. Antonini E. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 76: 72-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Preparation of Holo-IsdA and Holo-IsdC—Holo-IsdC was obtained by reconstitution of its apo-form with hemin. One ml of apo-IsdC was incubated with excess hemin, loaded onto a Sephadex G-25 column (0.5 × 30 cm), and eluted with 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. The holoprotein without free hemin was collected. Purified IsdA was a mixture of apo- and holo-forms. Homogeneous holo-IsdA was similarly prepared by reconstituting apo-IsdA in the mixture with hemin. Determination of Protein Concentration and Heme Content—Protein concentration was determined using a modified Lowry protein assay kit purchased from Pierce with bovine serum albumin as a standard. Heme content was measured using the pyridine hemochrome assay with the extinction coefficient ϵ418 = 191.5 mm–1 cm–1 (28Fuhrhop J.H. Smith K.M. Smith K.M. Porphyrins and Metalloporphyrins. Elsevier Publishing Co., New York1975: 804-807Google Scholar). Rates of Hemin Association to and Dissociation from IsdA and IsdC—The rates of hemin dissociation from holo-IsdA and holo-IsdC were measured using H64Y/V68F whale sperm apomyoglobin as a hemin scavenger according to the previous method (29Hargrove M.S. Singleton E.W. Quillin M.L. Ortiz L.A. Phillips Jr., G.N. Olson J.S. Mathews A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4207-4214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with slight modification. Each protein (3 μm) was incubated with 48 μm apomyoglobin in 1 ml of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and the changes in absorbance at 600 and 554 nm were monitored. Sucrose in the original method was not used in this study. The Δ(A600–A554) time courses were fit to a single exponential equation to obtain the first-order rate constants for hemin dissociation. The rates of hemin binding to the apoproteins were measured using a stopped-flow spectrophotometer equipped with a photodiode array detector (SX20; Applied Photophysics). Hemin (2 μm) in one syringe was mixed with apoprotein at ≥3 times [hemin] in another syringe. Entire spectra were recorded over time in each reaction. Changes in absorbance at the indicated wavelengths were analyzed as described under “Results.” Hemin Transfer—Holo-IsdA and apo-IsdC or holo-IsdC and apo-IsdA at indicated concentrations were incubated in 0.1 ml of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, at room temperature (22 °C) for 2 or 20 min. Each mixture was then loaded onto a small DEAE-Sepharose column (0.2 ml of resin), and the column was first eluted with 0.3 ml Tris-HCl to recover IsdA, which did not bind to the column, and then washed with 1 ml of Tris-HCl. IsdC bound to the column was eluted with 0.3 ml of 0.2 m NaCl in Tris-HCl. Separation of the two proteins was confirmed by SDS-PAGE analysis. The concentrations of holo-IsdA and holo-IsdC in the isolated samples were calculated from A406 using the extinction coefficients of 9.5 × 104 and 1.1 × 105m–1·cm–1, respectively. The concentrations of apo-IsdA and apo-IsdC in the same samples were calculated from A280 after subtracting the contribution from the holo-form using the extinction coefficients of 1.6 × 104 and 1.8 × 104 m–1·cm–1, respectively. Kinetics of Hemin Transfer from Holo-IsdA to Apo-IsdC—The spectral changes associated with hemin transfer from holo-IsdA to apo-IsdC were used to measure the transfer rate using the stopped-flow spectrophotometer at the indicated temperatures. Holo-IsdA (2.4 μm) in one syringe was mixed with apo-IsdC at >5 times [holo-IsdA] in another syringe. Entire spectra were recorded over a range of 250–800 nm against time in each reaction. Changes in absorbance at the appropriate wavelengths were analyzed. IsdA and IsdC Proteins—Purified recombinant IsdA was a mixture of apo- and holo-forms. Homogeneous holo-IsdA was prepared by reconstitution of apo-IsdA with hemin, and 95% apo-IsdA was prepared by extraction with methyl ethyl ketone. Holo-IsdA exhibits absorption peaks at 406, 503, 529, and 622 nm in the visible region (Fig. 1A). Reduction of holo-IsdA with dithionite shifted the Soret peak from 406 to 430 nm and abolished the A622 peak but did not result in the resolved α and β absorption bands seen in hemochrome (Fig. 1A). These absorption features are consistent with the previous observation that the heme iron in IsdA is pentacoordinate (19Grigg J.C. Vermeiren C.L. Heinrichs D.E. Murphy M.E. Mol. Microbiol. 2007; 63: 139-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 24Vermeiren C.L. Pluym M. Mack J. Heinrichs D.E. Stillman M.J. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 12867-12875Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Purified recombinant IsdC was also a mixture of apoprotein and a complex that displays absorption peaks at 407, 511, 547, 570, and 625 nm (data not shown) in the visible region. This feature is almost identical to that of the GST-IsdC fusion protein, which was found to bind iron-free protoporphyrin (23Mack J. Vermeiren C. Heinrichs D.E. Stillman M.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 320: 781-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), indicating that the chromophore associated with IsdC was protoporphyrin. Apo-IsdC was readily separated from the IsdC-protoporphyrin complex by anion exchange chromatography. Holo-IsdC reconstituted from apo-IsdC and hemin displays the broad Soret peak at 402 nm and charge transfer bands at 501, 532, and 626 nm (Fig. 1B). Holo-IsdC treated with dithionite possesses the Soret peak at 417 nm and lacks the dominant α and β bands, and the reduction of holo-IsdC appears not to be complete (Fig. 1B). These spectral characteristics are consistent with the pentacoordination of the heme iron in the crystal structure of IsdC (20Sharp K.H. Schneider S. Cockayne A. Paoli M. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 10625-10631Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Relative Affinity of IsdA and IsdC for Hemin—To determine the affinity of IsdA for hemin, the rates of hemin binding and dissociation from IsdA were measured. When hemin was mixed with apo-IsdA, the spectrum of the reaction shifted from that of free hemin to those of holo-IsdA (Fig. 2A). The time course of Δ(A406–A374) could be described by a two-exponential equation, resulting in two observed rate constants. The fast and slow phases contributed to approximate 70 and 30% of the total spectral change, respectively (Fig. 2C). The value of observed rate constant in the fast phase (kobs1) varies hyperbolically with [apo-IsdA], whereas the observed rate constant in the slow phase (kobs2) does not display a clear dependence on [apo-IsdA] (Fig. 2D). Using the method of de Villiers et al. (30Villiers de K.A. Kaschula C.H. Egan T.J. Marques H.M. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 2007; 12: 101-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), monomeric Fe(III)-protoporphyrin IX was ∼60% of total hemin at 2 μm in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. Thus, the fast phase is most likely the reaction of apo-IsdA with monomeric hemin. If this is true, the results of the fast-phase reaction suggest a two-step binding process involving the formation of a hemin-apoprotein intermediate that is followed by axial coordination to form the final holoprotein as proposed in Scheme 1, where k1 and k2 are the rate constants for bimolecular formation and unimolecular dissociation of the initial apoprotein-hemin complex, respectively, and kcoordination and k–hemin are the internal first-order rate constants for iron coordination to and dissociation from the final protein ligands, respectively.SCHEME 1View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) If k1 and k2 are much greater than kcoordination, and k–hemin is much smaller than kcoordination, the observed constant in the fast phase (kobs1) is described by Equation 1, kobs1=kcoordination[apoprotein]k2/k1+[apoprotein]=kcoordination[apoprotein]Kd+[apoprotein](Eq. 1) where Kd is k2/k1. The values for Kd and kcoordination from fitting the kobs1 data in Fig. 2D to Equation 1 are 3.3 ± 0.7 μm and 330 ± 27 s–1, respectively. At low apoprotein concentrations where the reaction appears bimolecular, the apparent second-order rate constant (kcoordination/Kd) is 100 μm–1·s–1. To determine the rate of dissociation of hemin from IsdA, IsdA was mixed with excess H64Y/V68F apomyoglobin, and dissociated hemin was captured by apomyoglobin. At 6 h after mixing holo-IsdA and apo-Mb, the mixture displayed the spectrum of H64Y/V68F holomyoglobin, as evidenced by the formation of the A600 peak (Fig. 3A), indicating the loss of hemin from IsdA. Δ(A600–A544) time course associated with the hemin dissociation was fitted to a single exponential equation (Fig. 3C), obtaining k–hemin of 0.95 ± 0.02 h–1. Because the dissociation of hemin is extremely slow, k–hemin in Scheme 1 must be <<k1 or k2. Therefore, the rate constants of IsdA obtained from the time course in Fig. 3 are directly equal to k–hemin in Scheme 1. The association equilibrium constants (Khemin) for hemin binding to apo-IsdA can be estimated by the ratio of the apparent second-order association rate constant (k′hemin = kcoordination/Kd) and the hemin dissociation rate constant k–hemin. The Khemin value for IsdA is 3.8 × 1011 m–1 (Table 1).TABLE 1Rate and equilibrium constants for hemin binding to IsdAKinetic parameterIsdAk2/k1 or Kd (hemin binding)aThe values of the parameters were derived from the fast phase of the reaction of hemin with apoIsdA at 25 °C in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, according to Scheme 1 and Equation 1.3.3 ± 0.7 μmkcoordinationaThe values of the parameters were derived from the fast phase of the reaction of hemin with apoIsdA at 25 °C in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, according to Scheme 1 and Equation 1.330 ± 27 s-1k′hemin ≈ kcoordination/Kd, apparent bimolecular rate constant at low [protein]100 μm-1 s-1k-heminbThe hemin dissociation rate constant from holoIsdA was determined by the H64Y/V68F apomyoglobin assay.0.95 ± 0.02 h-1Khemin ≈ k′hemin/k-hemin3.8 × 1011 m-1a The values of the parameters were derived from the fast phase of the reaction of hemin with apoIsdA at 25 °C in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, according to Scheme 1 and Equation 1.b The hemin dissociation rate constant from holoIsdA was determined by the H64Y/V68F apomyoglobin assay. Open table in a new tab An attempt was also made to determine the affinity of IsdC for hemin. The spectral changes of the hemin/apo-IsdC mixture indicate that most of hemin already bound to IsdC when the first spectrum was recorded in a stopped-flow spectrophotometer (Fig. 2B). Because the reaction is too fast, the kcoordination and Kd of hemin association with apo-IsdC could not be reliably measured. Unlike the reaction of holo-IsdA and apomyoglobin, the 3.2 μm holo-IsdC, 48 μm apomyoglobin mixture at 12 h after mixing had a spectrum that was still more close to that of holo-IsdC than to that of holomyoglobin (Fig. 3B), and Δ(A600– A544) associated with the holo-IsdC/apomyoglobin reaction was 20% of the expected change (Fig. 3C). These results indicate that IsdC has higher affinity for hemin than both IsdA and H64Y/V68F myoglobin. Hemin Transfer from IsdA to Apo-IsdC—We next tested whether IsdA transfers its hemin to apo-IsdC. Holo-IsdA (36 μm) and 47 μm apo-IsdC were incubated at room temperature for 2 min, and the two proteins were separated on a small DEAE column. SDS-PAGE analysis confirmed the separation of the two proteins (Fig. 4A). The normalized spectra of IsdA and IsdC before and after the reaction are shown in Fig. 4, B and C, respectively. The ratio of A406/A280 of the treated IsdA was 29% that of the starting holo-IsdA. A406 is the absorption by the bound hemin, and A280 is mainly absorbance of the protein moiety. The lower A406/A280 ratio of treated IsdA indicates that IsdA lost hemin in its reaction with apo-IsdC. Consistent with this result, holo-IsdC was present in treated IsdC based on the presence of the absorbance of bound hemin (Fig. 4C). Measurements of protein and hemin contents of these samples indicated that 90% of the holo-IsdA and 65% of the apo-IsdC lost and gained hemin, respectively. These results indicate that IsdA efficiently transfers its hemin to apo-IsdC. Equilibrium Constant of the Holo-IsdA/Apo-IsdC Reaction—To demonstrate whether the hemin transfer reaction is reversible, 15 μm holo-IsdC was incubated with 56 μm apo-IsdA for 2 min, and the two proteins were separated as described above. Based on the spectra of the separated proteins (Fig. 5) and the extinction coefficients, 24% of holo-IsdC transferred hemin to apo-IsdA. Thus, the reaction is reversible. To estimate the equilibrium constant of this reversible reaction, 33 μm holo-IsdA was incubated with apo-IsdC at 12, 24, 48, 71, or 95 μm at room temperature (22 °C) for 20 min, and the two proteins were separated. The concentrations of apo- and holo-forms of each isolated protein were calculated using the corresponding extinction coefficients, which were then used to determine the concentrations of apo- and holo-forms of each protein in the reaction mixture on the assumption that the separation did not shift the equilibrium. Fig. 6 represents the concentrations of holo-IsdA, apo-IsdA, and holo-IsdC as a function of initial [apo-IsdC]/[holo-IsdA]. Based on these data, the mean value ± S.D. of the equilibrium constant of the reaction was found to be 10 ± 5. The results indicate that the equilibrium is in favor of holo-IsdC formation, being consistent with the higher affinity of IsdC for hemin than IsdA.FIGURE 6Apo-IsdC titration in hemin transfer from holo-IsdA to apo-IsdC. Holo-IsdA (33 μm) was incubated with 12, 24, 48, 71, or 95 μm apo-IsdC in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, at 22 °C for 20 min. Shown are the concentrations of holo-IsdA, apo-IsdA, and holo-IsdC in the mixtures as a function of the ratio of initial [apo-IsdC]/[holo-IsdA].View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Kinetics of Hemin Transfer from IsdA to Apo-IsdC—Although oxidized holo-IsdA and holo-IsdC have similar Soret absorption peaks, holo-IsdC does have higher absorbance than holo-IsdA in the region between 350 and 405 nm (Fig. 7A). Because holo-IsdA transfers its hemin to apo-IsdC, there should be increase in absorbance in the region of 350–405 nm during the transfer, and this increase could be used to determine the kinetics of the hemin transfer reaction. Thus, limited holo-IsdA was reacted with apo-IsdC at various concentrations in a stopped-flow spectrophotometer, and spectra were recorded over time. The absorbance in the region of 350–405 nm was indeed rapidly increased after mixing holo-IsdA and apo-IsdC (Fig"
https://openalex.org/W2083774152,"Many superconducting materials allow the penetration of magnetic fields in a mixed state in which the superfluid is threaded by a regular lattice of Abrikosov vortices, each carrying one quantum of magnetic flux. The phenomenological Ginzburg-Landau theory, based on the concept of characteristic length scales, has generally provided a good description of the Abrikosov vortex lattice state. We conducted neutron-scattering measurements of the vortex lattice form factor in the heavy-fermion superconductor cerium-cobalt-indium (CeCoIn 5 ) and found that this form factor increases with increasing field—opposite to the expectations within the Abrikosov-Ginzburg-Landau paradigm. We propose that the anomalous field dependence of the form factor arises from Pauli paramagnetic effects around the vortex cores and from the proximity of the superconducting state to a quantum critical point."

Here, we report that MOG1, a small protein that is highly conserved from yeast to humans, is a central component of the channel complex and modulates the physiological function of Nav1.5. The yeast two-hybrid screen identified MOG1 as a new protein that interacts with the cytoplasmic loop II (between transmembrane domains DII and DIII) of Nav1.5. The interaction was further demonstrated by both in vitro glutathione S-transferase pull-down and in vivo co-immunoprecipitation assays in both HEK293 cells with co-expression of MOG1 and Nav1.5 and native cardiac cells. Co-expression of MOG1 with Nav1.5 in HEK293 cells increased sodium current densities. In neonatal myocytes, overexpression of MOG1 increased current densities nearly 2-fold. Western blot analysis revealed that MOG1 increased cell surface expression of Nav1.5, which may be the underlying mechanism by which MOG1 increased sodium current densities. Immunostaining revealed that in the heart, MOG1 was expressed in both atrial and ventricular tissues with predominant localization at the intercalated discs. In cardiomyocytes, MOG1 is mostly localized in the cell membrane and co-localized with Nav1.5. These results indicate that MOG1 is a critical regulator of sodium channel function in the heart and reveal a new cellular function for MOG1.

The SCN5A gene on chromosome 3p21 encodes Nav1.5, the α-subunit of the cardiac sodium channel, which plays an important role in generating the cardiac action potential and mediating the conduction of cardiac electrical impulses (1Gellens M.E.

Previous studies also suggest that alterations in the cardiac sodium channel function may be linked to two other major cardiac diseases, heart failure and atrial fibrillation. The expression of Nav1.5 protein expression was reduced about 30% in a dog model of heart failure (8Zicha S. Maltsev V.A. Nattel S. Sabbah H.N. Undrovinas A.I. J. Mol. Cell Cardiol. 2004; 37: 91-100Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), whereas in a dog model of chronic atrial fibrillation, the sodium current density/function was decreased in atrial cells (9Yagi T. Pu J. Chandra P. Hara M. Danilo Jr., P. Rosen M.R. Boyden P.A. Cardiovasc. Res. 2002; 54: 405-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar).Due to its critical importance in cardiac physiology and human disease, studies to define the regulatory proteins and other components of the multiprotein Nav1.5 complex have been of intense interest. The major component of the sodium channel complex is the pore-forming α-subunit Nav1.5, which consists of four homologous domains (DI, DII, DIII, and DIV) with each domain containing six transmembrane segments (S1–S6) (1Gellens M.E. George Jr., A.L. Chen L.Q. Chahine M. Horn R. Barchi R.L. Kallen R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 554-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar, 2Wang Q. Li Z. Shen J. Keating M.T. Genomics. 1996; 34: 9-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). The channel complex contains other subunits, for which there are at least four β-subunits identified thus far. Co-expression of the β1-subunit with Nav1.5 causes a small but significant acceleration in the recovery from inactivation as well as an increase in current density that may be due to an increased targeting efficiency of the mature channel to the cell membrane (10Nuss H.B.

The β3-subunit causes a depolarizing shift in steady-state inactivation and a slower recovery from inactivation than the β1-subunit (12Fahmi A.I. Patel M. Stevens E.B. Fowden A.L. John J.E. Lee III K. Pinnock R. Morgan K. Jackson A.P. Vandenberg J.I. J. Physiol. 2001; 537: 693-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The β2- and β4-subunits have little effect on the channel kinetics of Nav1.5 (13Dhar M.J. Chen C. Rivolta I. Abriel H. Malhotra R. Mattei L.N. Brosius F.C. Kass R.S. Isom L.L.

Ankyrin-G was shown to interact with Nav1.5, and this interaction involved a 9-amino acid motif in the cytoplasmic loop II between DII and DIII, the result of which promoted the localization of the channels to cell membrane in cardiomyocytes. The C terminus of Nav1.5 contains 244 amino acid residues that have been shown to have important interactions with proteins such as FHF1B (fibroblast growth factor-homologous factor 1B), calmodulin, Nedd4-like ubiquitin-protein ligase, dystrophin and syntrophin, Fyn, and PTPH1 (protein-tyrosine phosphatase) (15Abriel H.

In a recent study, 14-3-3 was found to interact with the cytoplasmic loop I between DI and DII, and its dimerization was needed for current regulation (19Allouis M. Le B.F. Wilders R. Peroz D.

Despite this apparent diversity in accessory proteins, the complete composition of the cardiac sodium channel complex remains poorly understood. It is reasonable to expect that many more proteins are involved in the dynamic networks of protein-protein interactions with Nav1.5 and underscores the significance of multiprotein complexes that are critical for normal cardiac function.MOG1 was initially identified as a suppressor that was able to rescue the temperature-sensitive defect of Saccharomyces cerevisiae Ran, a protein involved in nucleocytoplasmic transport, microtubule, and nuclear assembly, and the spatial and temporal organization of the eukaryotic cell (20Oki M. Nishimoto T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15388-15393Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 21Quimby B.B. Dasso M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2003; 15: 338-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). In vitro studies showed that MOG1 can bind to Ran-GTP (20Oki M. Nishimoto T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 2000; 275: 23175-23180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), but its in vivo function is not clear. MOG1 has been shown to be a highly conserved protein from yeast to humans (23Marfatia K.A. Harreman M.T. Fanara P. Vertino P.M. Corbett A.H. Gene (Amst.). 2001; 266: 45-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Human MOG1 gene contains five exons and four introns and encodes a protein of 187 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 20 kDa (23Marfatia K.A. Harreman M.T. Fanara P. Vertino P.M. Corbett A.H. Gene (Amst.). 2001; 266: 45-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The highest expression of MOG1 was detected in the heart by Northern blot analysis (23Marfatia K.A. Harreman M.T. Fanara P. Vertino P.M. Corbett A.H. Gene (Amst.). 2001; 266: 45-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), but the exact physiological function of MOG1 in the heart is unknown.To identify new proteins associated with the cardiac sodium channel complex, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screen with separate intracellular domains of Nav1.5 as baits. When the cytoplasmic loop II was used as the bait, a candidate Nav1.5-interacting protein, MOG1, was identified. We further demonstrated the interaction between MOG1 and Nav1.5 by both in vitro GST 3The abbreviations used are:GSTglutathione S-transferaseIPimmunoprecipitationERendoplasmic reticulumGFPgreen fluorescent protein.3The abbreviations used are:GSTglutathione S-transferaseIPimmunoprecipitationERendoplasmic reticulumGFPgreen fluorescent protein. pull-down and in vivo co-immunoprecipitation assays. We examined the physiological role of MOG1 by co-expression of MOG1 and Nav1.5 in HEK293 cells and neonatal cardiomyocytes. Our results indicate that MOG1 is a co-factor for Nav1.5 and modulates the appropriate expression and function of Nav1.5.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESConstruction of Plasmids and Antibodies—The human MOG1 gene was cloned into vector pET28a at the EcoRI and SalI sites (pET28a-MOG1) as previously described (23Marfatia K.A. Harreman M.T. Fanara P. Vertino P.M. Corbett A.H. Gene (Amst.). 2001; 266: 45-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The MOG1 insert was released from pET28a-MOG1 and subcloned into pcDNA3.1C (Invitrogen) at the BamHI and NotI sites or into pCMV10, yielding mammalian expression constructs for His-tagged MOG1 (pcDNA3.1C-MOG1) and FLAG-tagged MOG1 (pCMV10-MOG1), respectively.Human cardiac sodium channel gene SCN5A was cloned into vector pcDNA3 (pcDNA3-Nav1.5) as described (24Wan X. Wang Q. Kirsch G.E. J. Mol. Cell Cardiol. 2000; 32: 1873-1884Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 25Wan X. Chen S. Sadeghpour A. Wang Q. Kirsch G.E. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: H354-H360Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and used for establishing a stable HEK293 cell line with constant expression of Nav1.5 (hereafter referred to as “HEK293/Nav1.5”; a generous gift from G. E. Kirsch). The cytoplasmic loop II (LII) between transmembrane domains DII and DIII of Nav1.5 was amplified by PCR using oligonucleotides containing XhoII and EcoRI restriction sites (forward, 5′-AGAATTCAGCTCCTTCAGTGCAGA-3′; reverse, 5′-TCTCGAGTTAGTGGTAGCAGGTCTT-3′) and cloned into vector pGEX4T-1-GST tag (Novagen) (pGEX4T-1-GST-Nav1.5-LII) for expression and purification of GST-Nav1.5-LII fusion protein. The cytoplasmic loop I (LI) between DI and DII of Nav1.5 was amplified and cloned using an identical approach to generate pGEX4T-1-GST-Nav1.5-LI for expression and purification of GST-Nav1.5-LI fusion protein. Primers used to amplify the Nav1.5-LI are 5′-AGTTCAGGATCCGAGGAGCAAAA-3′ and 5′-CTTACAGCGGCCGCTTACTTCACTCCCT-3′. Nav1.5-LII was also subcloned into pcDNA3.1A to express His-tagged Nav1.5-LII (pcDNA3.1A-Nav1.5-LII) in mammalian cells.Two anti-MOG1 antibodies were developed by GeneMed Synthesis, Inc. The first MOG1 antibody (number 2738) was developed with a MOG1-specific peptide, C-QPPPDNRSSLGPENL at the N-terminal section, and the immunogene for the second antibody (number 3350) was a peptide, COOH-NQQVAKDVTLHQALLRLPQYQTDL at the C-terminal section. The rabbit polyclonal anti-Nav1.5 antibody was as described previously (26Wu L. Nishiyama K. Hollyfield J.G. Wang Q. Neuroreport. 2002; 13: 2547-2551Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar).Yeast Two-hybrid Screen—Yeast two-hybrid analysis was performed with a premade MATCHMAKER human heart cDNA library constructed in S. cerevisiae host strain, Y187 (Clontech). pACT2-derived constructs generate fusion proteins with the GAL4 activation domain fused to a library of other proteins. The baits for library screening were five different segments of Nav1.5 fused to the GAL4 DNA binding domain in the pAS2 vector. Since Nav1.5 is a membrane protein, the yeast two-hybrid screen with the entire Nav1.5 protein is unlikely to be fruitful, because the protein may not enter the yeast nuclei. Thus, we selected five cytoplasmic segments of Nav1.5 as baits. These include the N-terminal domain (amino acids 1–123), cytoplasmic LI between DI and DII (Nav1.5-LI; amino acids 437–711), cytoplasmic LII between DII and DIII (Nav1.5-LII; amino acids 940–1200), the inactivation gate between DIII and DIV (amino acids 1471–1523), and the C-terminal domain (amino acids 1773–2016). A bait plasmid was transfected into yeast strain Y187 with a library of human heart cDNAs fused to GAL4 activation domain. Positive colonies were identified as instructed by the manufacturer (Clontech). Approximately 107 primary transformants were screened for each of the baits. DNA was isolated from each positive clone and used to transform Escherichia coli HB101 (Leu-) to isolate only pACT2 derivative plasmids. The cDNA insert from each positive pACT2 derivative clone was amplified by PCR and sequenced by the BigDye Terminator version 1.1 cycle sequencing kit and an ABI PRISM 3100 genetic analyzer. The DNA sequences were then characterized by Blast analysis against the NCBI data base to determine the identity of the potential Nav1.5-interacting proteins.GST Pull-down Assays—Construct pGEX4T-1-GST, pGEX4T-1-GST-Nav1.5-LI, or pGEX4T-1-GST-Nav1.5-LII was transformed into E. coli BL21 to express the GST, GST-Nav1.5-LI, and GST-Nav1.5-LII proteins. The GST and GST fusion proteins were then affinity-purified using glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads according to the manufacturer's protocol (Amersham Biosciences). The proteins were eluted with 0.01 m glutathione, 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and dialyzed in dialysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 20% glycerol, and 0.5 mm dithiothreitol).The 35S-labeled MOG1 protein was prepared using a TNT Quick Coupled Transcription/Translation system (Promega). Briefly, 1 μg of plasmid DNA was mixed with TNT Quick Master mix and [35S]methionine and incubated for 90 min at 30 °C. The 35S-labeled MOG1 protein was mixed with GST, GST-Nav1.5-LI, or GST-Nav1.5-LII immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads in binding buffer (1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100) and incubated for 2–3 h at 4 °C. After binding, the beads were washed with binding buffer, and bound proteins were eluted with 1× SDS loading buffer, separated on a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, dried, and visualized by exposing to x-ray film at -80 °C for 12 h.Co-Immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) Analysis—HEK293/Nav1.5 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's minimum essential medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) and transfected with 10 μg of pcDNA3.1C-MOG1 DNA for the expression of His-tagged MOG1 with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Transfection was carried out with 80% confluent cells in a 10-cm plate. Cells were harvested and lysed in TNEN buffer (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 2.0 mm EDTA, 1.0% Nonidet P-40, protease inhibitor mixture) 24–48 h after transfection. 500 μg of total cell extracts was mixed with a rabbit polyclonal anti-Nav1.5 antibody (26Wu L. Nishiyama K. Hollyfield J.G. Wang Q. Neuroreport. 2002; 13: 2547-2551Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) and incubated on a rotator for 3 h at 4 °C. Protein A/G-Sepharose 4B beads (Sigma) were added, and incubation was continued for another 2 h. The bound proteins were eluted by boiling the samples for 5 min in 1× SDS loading buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE, and transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was probed with an anti-His antibody (Sigma) recognizing His-MOG1 fusion protein, and the protein signal was visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Biosciences). For reverse co-IP, a rabbit polyclonal anti-MOG1 antibody was used for immunoprecipitation, and the anti-Nav1.5 antibody was used for Western blot analysis. Similar co-IP studies were performed to study the interaction between the cytoplasmic loop II of Nav1.5 and MOG1 by co-expressing His-tagged Nav1.5-LII and FLAG-tagged MOG1 in HEK293 cells and with an anti-His antibody and an anti-FLAG antibody.For co-immunoprecipitation analysis of MOG1 and Nav1.5 in cardiac cells, total protein lysates were isolated from adult mouse hearts. Mice were sacrificed, and the hearts were excised, washed in Hanks' buffer, cut into pieces, and lysed in the lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, mixture of protease inhibitors). The lysates were sonicated on ice (Sonicator 3000; Misonic Inc., Farmingdale, NY), incubated on ice for 30 min, and then microcentrifuged at 4 °C for 10 min. The supernatant was collected, and its concentration was measured using the Bio-Rad Protein Assay dye. The lysates were precleared on protein A/G beads at 4 °C for 40 min prior to co-IP studies. Protein A/G beads (40 μl) were incubated with 2 μg of the anti-Nav1.5 (or anti-MOG1) (1:500 dilution in PBST) and 500 μg of cell lysates with gentle rocking for 2 h at 4 °C. After washing five times with washing buffer (phosphate-buffered saline, protease inhibitors, and 0.5% Triton X-100), the immunoprecipitates were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis using the anti-MOG1 antibody (or anti-Nav1.5). Cell lysates incubated with protein A/G beads alone were used as a negative control. Co-IP of lysates with normal IgG was also used as a negative control in each experiment. Studies were repeated at least three times.Isolation of Mouse Cardiomyocytes—For isolation of neonatal mouse cardiomyocytes, 10–15 mouse hearts were collected from 3-day-old CBA/B6 mouse neonates. The ventricles were excised, and myocytes were isolated using the neonatal rat/mouse cardiomyocyte isolation kit from CELLUTRON Life Technology. The cells were plated on uncoated 100-mm plates to reduce the contamination of cardiac fibroblasts. Myocytes were then cultured in the NS medium (CELLUTRON Life Technology) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Isolation of adult cardiomyocytes was performed as previously described by us (27Tian X.L. Yong S.L. Wan X. Wu L. Chung M.K. Tchou P.J. Rosenbaum D.S. Wagoner Van D.R. Kirsch G.E. Wang Q. Cardiovasc.

Yong S.L. Wan X. Wu L. Chung M.K. Tchou P.J. Rosenbaum D.S. Wagoner Van D.R. Kirsch G.E. Wang Q. Cardiovasc. Res. 2004; 61: 256-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 29Yong S.L. Ni Y.

Vector pIRE-GFP DNA expressing green fluorescent GFP protein (0.25 μg) was co-transfected together with pcDNA3.1C-MOG1 to serve as an indicator (24Wan X. Wang Q. Kirsch G.E. J. Mol.

Physiol. 2001; 280: H354-H360Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Only GFP-positive cells were selected for recording sodium currents. Pipettes were fabricated from borosilicate glass (FHC, Inc.), and electrode resistance ranged from 2 to 3 megaohms when filled with pipette solution with the following composition: 20 mm NaCl, 130 mm CsCl, 10 mm HEPES, 10 mm EGTA, pH 7.2, with CsOH. Voltage command pulses were generated using the Multipatch 700B amplifier (Axon Instruments) under the control of a desktop computer with pCLAMP software (9.0; Axon Instruments). Currents were filtered at 5 kHz (-3 dB, 4-pole Bessel filter) following series resistance compensation. The holding potential for all pulse protocols was -100 mV, and experiments were performed at room temperature (22 °C). For HEK293 cells, the composition of the bath solution was 70 mm NaCl, 80 mm CsCl, 5.4 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, 10 mm glucose, pH 7.3, with CsOH. For neonatal cells, the NaCl concentration was reduced to 20 mm, and CsCl was increased to 120 mm for better voltage control. To reduce contaminating Ca2+ and K+ (transient outward) currents, 2 mm CdCl2, and 2 mm 4-aminopyridine, respectively, were added to the bath.Cell-attached Recording—Seals were formed in an extracellular solution containing 140 mm NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 10 mm glucose, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, with NaOH. After seal formation, cells were depolarized with an extracellular solution containing 140 mm potassium aspartate, 0.62 mm CaCl2, 1.06 mm MgCl2, 10 mm glucose, 10 mm HEPES, 2 mm EGTA, pH adjusted to 7.2 with KOH. The pipette solution contained 140 mm NaCl, 10 mm tetraethylammonium chloride, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, with NaOH. Pipettes were fabricated with borosilicate glass and coated with Sylgard®. Pipette resistances were 2 megaohms. Experiments were performed at room temperature.Currents were elicited using 100-ms step pulses in 10-mV increments from a holding potential of -120 mV. Currents were filtered at 5 kHz with a 4-pole Bessel filter and sampled at 20 kHz. Patches contained several channels, so multiple overlapping openings were generally observed near the start of the depolarization, but isolated single channel currents could be measured at later times. Events were detected using the half-amplitude threshold-crossing method, following digital Gaussian filtering to a final 2 kHz frequency and spline interpolation. Single channel current amplitudes were measured from open events lasting >0.18 ms (2 times the dead time of the filter). The single-channel conductance was calculated by linear regression for currents from -80 to -20 mV.To determine the voltage dependence of gating and the maximal conductance, peak currents at each voltage were converted to chord conductance, G = I/(V - VR), where VR is the extrapolated reversal potential from a linear fit to currents from -20 to 0 mV. In each experiment, G-V relations were fitted to a Boltzmann function, G = Gmax/(1 + e-(V-Vs)/k), where Gmax is the maximal conductance, Vs is the voltage where G = Gmax/2, and k is a slope factor. No significant differences in Gmax, Vs, or k were observed between controls and MOG1 cells.Western Blot Analysis—To determine the expression level of the Nav1.5 protein in the membrane fraction, HEK293/Nav1.5 cells were transiently transfected with pcDNA3.1C-MOG1 or empty vector pcDNA3.1C as control. Transfected cells were cultured for 48 h and washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were then collected and suspended in the lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, a protease inhibitor mixture). Cell lysates were centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C to remove cell debris, nuclei, and large particulates. The supernatant portion that contains both the extracted membrane proteins and cytosolic proteins was collected and further centrifuged at 40,000 rpm to separate the membrane fraction from the cytosolic fraction. The pellet from the second centrifugation step contains the membrane protein fraction, and the supernatant contains the cytosolic protein fraction. Equal amounts of protein extracts were resolved by 2% SDS containing protein loading buffer and separated on SDS-PAGE. Western blot analysis was performed as described previously (22Steggerda S.M. Paschal B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23175-23180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). A rabbit polyclonal anti-Nav1.5 was diluted in 1:500 in 0.3% bovine serum albumin in PBST and used in Western blot analysis. The signal was detected using enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL kit; Amersham Biosciences). An anti-KCNQ1 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was used as a loading control at 1:500 dilution in PBST.We also used Pierce Mem-PER mammalian membrane protein extraction kit (Pierce) for separating the membrane fraction from the cytosolic fraction through phase partitioning. Cells (5 × 10-6) were transfected, cultured, and collected as described before and lysed with 150 μl of Mem-Per Reagent A containing a mild proprietary detergent by incubation at room temperature for 10 min. 450 μl of the second diluted Mem-Per Reagent (2 parts Reagent C and 1 part Reagent B) was added to cell lysates to solubilize the membrane proteins. The mixture was incubated on ice for 30 min and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 3 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was then incubated at 37 °C for 10 min and then centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 2 min to separate the membrane fraction (bottom layer) from the hydrophilic fraction (top layer). The membrane and cytosolic fractions were used for Western blot analysis with anti-Nav1.5 and anti-KCNQ1 antibodies as described above, and similar results were obtained.Statistical Analysis—Data are represented as mean values ± S.E. Statistical analysis was performed using an analysis of variance and two-tailed Student's t test to compare means, and significance was set at the indicated p values.RESULTSMOG1 Was Identified as a Candidate Prot"
https://openalex.org/W2000736267,"The nuclear import of uridine-rich ribonucleoproteins is mediated by the transport adaptor snurportin 1 (SNP1). Similar to importin α, SNP1 uses an N-terminal importin β binding (sIBB) domain to recruit the receptor importin β and gain access to the nucleus. In this study, we demonstrate that the sIBB domain has a bipartite nature, which contains two distinct binding determinants for importin β. The first determinant spans residues 25-65 and includes the previously identified importin α IBB (αIBB) region of homology. The second binding determinant encompasses residues 1-24 and resembles region 1011-1035 of the nucleoporin 153 (Nup153). The two binding determinants synergize within the sIBB domain to confer a low nanomolar binding affinity for importin β (Kd ∼ 2 nm) in an interaction that, in vitro, is displaced by RanGTP. We propose that in vivo the synergy of Nup153 and nuclear RanGTP promotes translocation of uridine-rich ribonucleoproteins into the nucleus.

We propose that in vivo the synergy of Nup153 and nuclear RanGTP promotes translocation of uridine-rich ribonucleoproteins into the nucleus. Nuclear import of proteins and nucleic acids is an active signal-mediated process that requires, in most cases, soluble transport factors and GTP hydrolysis by the GTPase Ran (1Stewart M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 8: 195-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar, 2Weis K. Curr. Opin. Cell. Biol. 2002; 14: 328-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 3Pemberton L.F.

Nuclear transport factors are sorted into two categories: importins and exportins (also known as karyopherins), which include 14 members in budding yeast and at least 20 in humans (5Mosammaparast N. Pemberton L.F. Trends Cell Biol. 2004; 14: 547-556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar, 6Strom A.C. Weis K. Genome.

All karyopherins fold into superhelical solenoids, which present an external convex surface involved in nucleoporin binding and a concave internal face that interacts with transport cargos and RanGTP. The two best characterized importins, human importin β1 and yeast karyopherin β2, have been visualized using crystallographic methods bound to specific import cargos (7Cingolani G. Bednenko J.

These structures have provided invaluable information on the structural flexibility of karyopherins and their ability to undergo conformational changes during the import process (13Cook A. Bono F. Jinek M. Conti E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2007; 76: 647-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar, 14Conti E. Muller C.W. Stewart M. Curr. Opin. Struct.

Chromosoma (Berl.). 2006; 115: 98-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The best understood nuclear import pathway involves cargos bearing a classical SV40-like nuclear localization sequence (PKKKRKV) (17Lange A. Mills R.E. Lange C.J. Stewart M. Devine S.E. Corbett A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 5101-5105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (861) Google Scholar). These cargos are imported into the nucleus by the adaptor importin α and the receptor importin β with the aid of RanGTP. GTP hydrolysis by Ran energizes the import reaction by promoting both release of the import complex from nucleoporins as well as unloading of import cargos into the nucleus (1Stewart M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 8: 195-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar, 2Weis K. Curr. Opin. Cell. Biol. 2002; 14: 328-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 3Pemberton L.F.

In addition to classical nuclear localization sequence cargos, uridine-rich ribonucleoproteins (U snRNPs) 2The abbreviations used are: U snRNPuridine-rich small nuclear ribonucleoproteinSNP1snurportin 1IBBimportin β bindingsIBBSNP1 IBBαIBBimportin αNPCnuclear pore complexNup153nucleoporin 153ITCisothermal titration calorimetrySPRsurface plasmon resonanceGSTglutathione S-transferase. 2The abbreviations used are: U snRNPuridine-rich small nuclear ribonucleoproteinSNP1snurportin 1IBBimportin β bindingsIBBSNP1 IBBαIBBimportin αNPCnuclear pore complexNup153nucleoporin 153ITCisothermal titration calorimetrySPRsurface plasmon resonanceGSTglutathione S-transferase. represent an important class of import cargos. Mature U snRNP particles are assembled in the cytoplasm and imported into the nucleus in at least two distinct pathways, both dependent on importin β (18Rollenhagen C. Pante N. Can. J. Physiol. Pharmacol. 2006; 84: 367-376Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the first pathway, the import signal is in the proteinaceous core of the U snRNP formed by the Sm proteins (18Rollenhagen C. Pante N. Can. J. Physiol. Pharmacol. 2006; 84: 367-376Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Huber J. Cronshagen U. Kadokura M. Marshallsay C. Wada T. Sekine M. Luhrmann R.

In the second pathway, the trimethylated guanosine cap of the mature U snRNP is recognized by the adaptor snurportin 1 (SNP1) (18Rollenhagen C. Pante N. Can. J. Physiol.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6783-6792Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which, in turn, recruits importin β. SNP1 consists of an N-terminal IBB domain (sIBB) similar to that found in importin α (αIBB) and a large C-terminal trimethylated guanosine cap-binding region that resembles the GTP-binding domain of mRNA-guanylyltransferase (22Strasser A. Dickmanns A. Luhrmann R. Ficner R. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 2235-2243Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In permeabilized cells, SNP1 and importin β promote Ran- and energy-independent nuclear import of at least two specific spliceosomal U snRNPs, namely U1 and U5 (23Huber J. Dickmanns A. Luhrmann R. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 467-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). After nuclear entry, SNP1 is recycled back to the cytoplasm by Crm1 in complex with RanGTP (24Paraskeva E. Izaurralde E.

Biochemical Techniques—Human importin β1 (residues 1-876) was expressed and purified as described previously in Ref. 8Cingolani G. Petosa C. Weis K. Muller C.W. Nature. 1999; 399: 221-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar.

The construct sn-(1-24) was generated by introducing a stop codon at position 25 of the plasmid pGEX-sIBB-(1-65). GST-sIBBs and GST-αIBB constructs were expressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3) strain for 3 h at 30 °C after induction with 0.5 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and purified over GST beads followed by gel filtration chromatography. Ran was expressed, purified, and loaded with the non-hydrolyzable GTP analog, GppNHp, as described previously (27Vetter I.R. Arndt A. Kutay U. Gorlich D. Wittinghofer A. Cell. 1999; 97: 635-646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Crystallization and Structure Determination—Importin β bound to a chemically synthesized sIBB-(25-65) peptide was crystallized under 20% polyethylene glycol 8000, 50 mm sodium chloride, at pH 6.0. Crystals of the importin β-sIBB-(25-65) complex diffracted weakly to 5Å resolution. Prolonged dehydration of crystals by soaking in 38% polyethylene glycol 8000 dramatically improved the diffraction to 2.35 Å resolution. Approximately 50 crystals were soaked for various times and screened at beamline X6A at the Brookhaven National Light Source (BNLS) on a Quantum Q4 CCD detector. Diffraction data were reduced to intensities using the programs DENZO and SCALEPACK (28Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38565) Google Scholar) (see Table 1). Two distinct crystal forms were obtained, both in space group P21. Crystal form I (see ds2.35 in Table 1) contains one importin β-sIBB-(25-65) complex in the asymmetric unit. Crystal form II (see ds3.2 in Table 1), which diffracted weakly to 3.2 Å resolution, contains two importin β-sIBB-(25-65) complexes in different conformations per asymmetric unit. Both structures were solved by molecular replacement in MolRep (29Collaborative Computational Project Number 4Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

The sIBB-(25-65) domain was built in Fo - Fc electron density difference maps using the program Coot (31Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (23344) Google Scholar). After several rounds of manual building alternated with positional and B-factor refinement, the final model for crystal form I has a Rwork and Rfree of 22.7 and 25.0%, respectively. For crystal form II, the final model was refined to a Rwork of 30.3% and Rfree of 32.8%, using all reflections between 40 and 3.2 Å resolution and includes a well defined closed importin β-sIBB domain complex (complex A) and an open conformation of the complex (complex B).

In the assay, 25 μg of importin β, a gel filtration-purified complex of importin β bound to either sIBB-(1-65) or sIBB-(25-65) peptides, were separated on a 1.5% agarose gel at room temperature for 45 min. For the Ran displacement, gel filtration-purified importin β-sIBB-(1-65) or sIBB-(25-65) complexes were incubated with 0.25-5-fold molar excess of RanGppNHp and incubated for 30 min on ice prior to electrophoretic separation on agarose gel. The pull-down assay was performed on glutathione-agarose beads (Amersham Biosciences) coupled to GST-sIBB-(1-65). In the assay, 25 μl of GST-sIBB-(1-65) beads were incubated with 16 μg of importin β for 15 min at room temperature. For Ran displacement, an excess of either RanGppNHp or RanGDP was added to the beads after the addition of importin β. The mixtures were incubated overnight at 4 °C followed by extensive washing in pull-down buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm sodium chloride, 3 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.005% Tween 20). After washing, all samples were dissolved in SDS-loading buffer and analyzed on SDS-PAGE. Isothermal Titration Calorimetry (ITC)—ITC experiments were carried out at 30 °C in a ITC calorimeter (Microcal). sn-(1-24) dissolved in β-buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm sodium chloride, 3 mm EDTA, 3 mm β-mercaptoethanol) at a concentration of 450 μm was injected in 9-μl increments into the calorimetric cell containing 1.8 ml of importin β in β-buffer at a concentration of 60 μm. The spacing between injections was 360 s. Titration data were analyzed using the Origin 7.0 data analysis software (Microcal Software, Northampton, MA). Injections were integrated following manual adjustment of the baselines. Heats of dilution were determined from control experiments with the β-buffer and subtracted prior to curve fitting using a single set of binding sites model. The curve fitting yields a Kd =∼30 ± 14 μm and ΔH = 6948 ± 1491 cal/mol at 30 °C for titration of the sn-(1-24) peptide into full-length importin β and a Kd =∼30 ± 15 μm and ΔH = 6548 ± 1191 cal/mol for titration of the sn-(1-24) peptide into importin β (residues 1-445). Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR)—GST control, GST-sIBB-(25-65), GST-sIBB-(1-65), and GST-αIBB-(11-54) were captured onto a sensor chip using an immobilized anti-GST antibody. Importin β was flowed into the cell in β-buffer (plus 0.005% surfactant P20) at concentrations between 200 and 600 nm, at a flow rate of 60 μl/min. Data were analyzed using the BIAevaluation software (Biacore Life Sciences). The association and dissociation curves were fit separately using the simple 1:1 Langmuirian model. The analysis of each individual curve resulted in an apparent rate of association and dissociation kon = 7.22 e4 ± 1.8 e4 (1/ms), koff = 8.24 e-4 ± 0.5 e-4 (s-1), and kon = 1.01 e5 ± 0.3 e4 (1/ms), koff = 2.07 e-4 ± 0.3 e-4 (s-1) for sIBB-(25-65) and sIBB-(1-65), respectively. The dissociation constants of the sIBB-(25-65) and sIBB-(1-65) for importin β measured as Kd = koff/kon was Kd = 15.6 ± 5.8 nm and Kd = 2.0 ± 0.4 nm, respectively. Snurportin IBB Domain Is Bipartite—Nuclear import SNP1 is mediated by the N-terminal sIBB domain (residues 1-65) (19Huber J. Cronshagen U. Kadokura M. Marshallsay C. Wada T. Sekine M. Luhrmann R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4114-4126Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). This region alone is necessary and sufficient to promote nuclear import in the absence of Ran and energy in a permeabilized cell assay (23Huber J. Dickmanns A. Luhrmann R. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 467-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Analysis of the primary sequence of the sIBB domain suggests the presence of a bipartite signal (Fig. 1a). Region 25-65 of the sIBB domain closely resembles the classical IBB domain of importin α (αIBB), which promotes Ran/energy-dependent nuclear import (23Huber J. Dickmanns A. Luhrmann R. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 467-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 34Lyman S.K. Guan T. Bednenko J. Wodrich H. Gerace L. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 55-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Similar to the αIBB domain (residues 11-54), all basic residues critical for importin β binding are conserved in the sIBB-(25-65) domain (supplemental Fig. 1). The latter is, however, shorter due to a 3-amino-acid gap between residues 46 and 47 (Fig. 1a). The region 25-65 of the sIBB domain will be defined as the αIBB region of homology. In contrast to importin αs, which show poor sequence conservation upstream of the IBB domain, SNP1 residues 1-24, sn-(1-24), are well conserved in snurportins (supplemental Fig. 1). Blast analysis reveals that sn-(1-24) shares 42% sequence identity and 79% similarity to a region of Nup153 spanning residues 1011-1035. This same region of Nup153 binds importin β with high affinity, likely via interactions with phenylalanine-glycine (FXFG) repeats (25Bednenko J. Cingolani G. Gerace L. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 391-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Structure of Importin β Bound to the sIBB-(25-65) Domain—To shed light on the interaction of SNP1 with importin β, we crystallized human importin β bound to a chemically synthesized peptide spanning residues 25-65 of SNP1. Although crystals of the importin β-sIBB-(25-65) complex were obtained under the same conditions used for crystallization with the αIBB-(11-54) peptide (8Cingolani G. Petosa C. Weis K. Muller C.W. Nature. 1999; 399: 221-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar), crystals diffracted weakly to 5 Å resolution. Aiming at high resolution diffraction studies, we subjected the importin β-sIBB-(25-65) complex crystals to dehydration in highly concentrated solutions of polyethylene glycol 8000. Diffraction analysis confirmed a dramatic improvement in the diffraction quality and resolution limit as a function of the time of dehydration. Dehydration for 3-12 h yielded high quality diffraction past 2.3 Å resolution. This crystal form, referred to as crystal form I, displayed a small primitive monoclinic unit cell (Table 1), which contained one importin β-sIBB-(25-65) complex in the asymmetric unit and ∼55% solvent content. The structure of crystal form I was determined by the molecular replacement method and refined to an Rfree of 25.0%, including all reflections between 40 and 2.35 Å resolution (Fig. 1b and Table 1). In the structure, importin β adopts a closed conformation nearly identical to that seen in complex with the αIBB domain (8Cingolani G. Petosa C. Weis K. Muller C.W. Nature. 1999; 399: 221-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). The protein is built by 19 HEAT repeats, which wrap around the sIBB-(25-65) in a conformation reminiscent of a snail. The sIBB-(25-65) domain interacts with the concave surface of importin β between HEAT repeats 7-19. The sIBB-(25-65) domain folds as a long C-terminal helix (residues 41-65), connected to an N-terminal 310 helix (residues 27-30) by a 7-residue spoon-shaped linker (Fig. 1b). The overall B-factor for the peptide is ∼65 Å2, slightly higher than that for the importin β (∼45 Å2). Crystal form II was obtained upon short dehydration (∼30 min) of importin β-sIBB-(25-65) crystals and diffracted to ∼3.2 Å resolution. Interestingly, this second crystal form contains two importin β-sIBB-(25-65) complexes in different conformations per asymmetric unit (Fig. 2a). In one complex (referred to as complex A), importin β adopts a closed conformation nearly identical to crystal form I. In the second complex (complex B), importin β is distinctly open, with C-terminal HEAT repeats 12-19 swung up to 20 Å away from the corresponding position in the closed conformation (Fig. 2b). The tertiary structure of the importin β molecule in complex B resembles Kap95p, the yeast homologue of importin β, in complex with RanGTP (11Lee S.J. Matsuura Y. Liu S.M. Stewart M. Nature. 2005; 435: 693-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). This open conformation of importin β likely represents the structure adopted by the protein in the process to unload the import cargo. Accordingly, the electron density for the sIBB-(25-65) domain is less defined in the complex B, where only the C-terminal helix is visible. sIBB-(25-65) versus αIBB Domain—The structure of importin β bound to the αIBB-(11-54) domain was previously determined to a comparable resolution of 2.3 Å (8Cingolani G. Petosa C. Weis K. Muller C.W. Nature. 1999; 399: 221-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar), allowing for direct comparison with the crystal form I described in this study. Despite the profound functional differences between the sIBB and αIBB domain, the conformation adopted by importin β in the two complexes is virtually identical (r.m.s. deviation 0.965 Å) (Fig. 3a). It is noteworthy that significant differences exist in the structure of the two IBB domains and in the way importin β positions them inside the cargo-binding surface (Fig. 3a). First, the sIBB-(25-65) domain is slightly shorter than the αIBB domain (35 versus 41 Å), which is consistent with the 3-amino-acid gap in the C-terminal helix between residues 46 and 47 (Fig. 1a). Second, the sIBB C-terminal helix is ∼5° tilted with respect to the αIBB helical axis, which positions it closer to the importin β concave surface (Fig. 3a). Third, in the sIBB-(25-65) domain, the linker between the C-terminal helix and the N-terminal 310 helix is significantly longer than in the αIBB domain (7 versus 3 amino acids), which suggests in the sIBB domain that these two helices have a much higher degree of flexibility. This hypothesis is corroborated by the structural plasticity seen in the 3.2 Å crystal form II, where in the more open complex B (Fig. 2a) only the C-terminal helix of the sIBB domain is visible, whereas the N-terminal 310 helix is likely flexible and thus disordered in the crystal structure. As in the recognition of the αIBB-(11-54) domain, importin β makes two distinct sets of contacts with the sIBB domain. The first includes the N-terminal moiety of the sIBB peptide (residues 25-40), which interacts with HEAT repeats 7-11 (Fig. 3b). This region is critical for binding of SNP1 to importin β. Substitution of Arg27 to Ala decreases the affinity of SNP1 for importin β by 20-fold and blocks nuclear import in digitonin-permeabilized cells (35Ospina J.K. Gonsalvez G.B. Bednenko J. Darzynkiewicz E. Gerace L. Matera A.G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 4660-4671Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The second region of interaction involves the sIBB helix (residues 41-65), which presents an extended network of contacts with HEAT repeats 12-19 of importin β (Fig. 3b). In the sIBB domain, this region engages in fewer contacts, 12 versus 20, as compared with the αIBB helix (residues 26-54). Likewise, the polybasic stretch 27Arg-Arg-Arg-Arg31 of the αIBB domain is shifted in the sIBB helix where only 2 of the 4 arginines contact importin β directly (Fig. 3b). SNP1 Region (1-24) Contains a Binding Determinant for Importin β—We next sought to determine whether the Nup153-like moiety of SNP1, sn-(1-24), binds importin β directly. The interaction of the sn-(1-24) with importin β was probed using three independent binding techniques. First, by native electrophoresis on agarose gel, a chemically synthesized sn-(1-24) peptide was found to shift the migration of importin β, which is suggestive of a direct physical interaction between the peptide and the protein (Fig. 4a). Second, using ITC, titration of sn-(1-24) in a calorimetric cell containing importin β at 30 °C yielded an endothermic binding reaction that is adequately described by a single exponential decay binding model (Fig. 4b). The thermodynamic parameters obtained from the curve fit indicated that sn-(1-24) binds importin β with a Kd ∼ 30 ± 14 μm and an enthalpy of complex formation of ΔH = 6948 ± 1491 cal/mol. Interestingly, identical heat release (and thus Kd) was observed using a fragment of importin β comprising HEAT repeats 1-10 (residues 1-445) (Fig. 4c). These evidences lend support to the existence of a single binding site for the sn-(1-24) in the N-terminal, RanGTP-(11, 27), and nucleoporin-binding (36Bayliss R. Littlewood T. Stewart M. Cell. 2000; 102: 99-108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar) region of importin β. However, based on the ITC data, we cannot rule out the possibility that the sn-(1-24) binds with lower or similar affinity to the C terminus of importin β (HEAT 11-19) or that the binding of the sn-(1-24) to the N-terminal HEAT repeats 1-10 excludes or drastically decrease its binding to the C terminus of the protein. Third, using SPR, we found that the sIBB-(1-65) domain has a 7-fold higher binding affinity for importin β than the shorter sIBB-(25-65) domain lacking the sn-(1-24) (Kd ∼ 2.0 ± 0.5 nm versus 15.2 ± 5.8 nm) (Fig. 5). The affinity measured by SPR for the full-length sIBB-(1-65) domain agrees well with the Kd values measured by FRET (Kd ∼ 2.0 nm) (37Kalab P. Pralle A. Isacoff E.Y. Heald R. Weis K. Nature. 2006; 440: 697-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar) and solid phase binding assay (Kd ∼ 4.7 nm) (35Ospina J.K. Gonsalvez G.B. Bednenko J. Darzynkiewicz E. Gerace L. Matera A.G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 4660-4671Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), which makes us confident in the accuracy of this technique in measuring the interactions of importin β with the SNP1. In addition to a significant drop in the Kd, the sIBB-(25-65) domain had a 4-fold faster rate of dissociation from importin β as compared with the sIBB-(1-65) domain (koff = 8.24 e4 ± 0.5 e4 s-1 versus koff = 2.07 e4 ± 0.3 e4 s-1) (Fig. 5), whose off rate from importin β was comparable with that of importin α (38Catimel B. Teh T. Fontes M.R. Jennings I.G. Jans D.A. Howlett G.J. Nice E.C. Kobe B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34189-34198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar).FIGURE 5sn-(1-24) affects the off rate of the sIBB domain from importin β. Binding properties of sIBB-(25-65) domain and sIBB-(1-65) domain were compared using SPR. GST-sIBB-(25-65), GST-sIBB-(1-65), and GST-αIBB-(11-54) were captured onto a sensor chip using an immobilized anti-GST antibody. Importin β was flown into the cell between concentrations of 200-600 nm, at a flow rate of 60 μl/min. The SPR curves shown are from three identical experiments carried out using importin β at 600 nm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) RanGppNHp Displaces the sIBB Domain from Importin β—We next investigated whether the interaction between SNP1 and importin β is disrupted by the small GTPase Ran, in vitro. By pull-down assay, agarose beads coupled to GST-sIBB-(1-65) efficiently pulled-down importin β (Fig. 6, lane 4). This interaction was selectively disrupted by an excess of RanGpp-NHp as compared with RanGDP (Fig. 6, lanes 5 and 6, respectively). In a second set of experiments, we sought to determine whether the N-terminal moiety sn-(1-24) alters the affinity of Ran for the importin β-sIBB complex. To address this question, we isolated on a Superdex 200 gel filtration column a 1:1 complex of importin β bound to either the sIBB-(1-65) or the sIBB-(25-65) domain. The stoichiometric presence of sIBB peptides was confirmed on Tricine gel (data not shown). Increasing quantities of Ran preloaded with non-hydrolyzable GTP analog, RanGppNHp, were titrated into the preformed gel filtration-purified importin β-sIBB-(25-65) or importin β-sIBB-(1-65) complex, and the mixture was analyzed by native electrophoresis on agarose gel (Fig. 7). In agreement with the pull-down assay, RanGpp-NHp selectively dissociated both sIBB-(25-65) and sIBB-(1-65) domains from importin β as compared with RanGDP (supplemental Fig. 2). Although both peptides were dissociated by approximately equimolar quantities of RanGpp-NHp, the dissociation of the shorter sIBB-(25-65) domain lacking the sn-(1-24) appeared reproducibly less cooperative than the sIBB-(1-65) domain (in Fig. 7, a versus b, compare lanes 4-8). This may suggest that importin β becomes more sensitive to RanGppNHp binding when the SPN1 moiety sn-(1-24) is bound to its N-terminal domain.FIGURE 7RanGppNHp releases the sIBB domain from importin β independent of the sn-(1-24). a and b, electrophoretic mobility shift assay on native agarose gel. Free importin β and importin β bound to RanGppNHp are in lanes 1 and 2, respectively. Gel filtration-purified complexes of importin β bound to sIBB-(25-65) domain (panel a) or sIBB-(1-65) domain (panel b) are in lane 3. The addition of increasing quantities of RanGppNHp (from 0.25- to 5-fold molar excess) to either importin β-sIBB complex displaces the sIBB domains from importin β (lanes 4-8).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To determine the molecular basis for the sIBB-(1-65) karyopheric properties, we have dissected the structure of the sIBB-(1-65) domain and its binding interactions with importin β. The main conclusion of our work indicates that the sIBB-(1-65) domain has a bipartite organization, which consists of two moieties, both interacting with importin β. The first binding determinant of SNP1 spans residues 25-65 and includes an αIBB region of homology, which binds importin β with nanomolar affinity (Kd ∼ 15 nm). As shown in the crystal structure of the importin β bound to the sIBB-(25-65) domain, this region of SNP1 interacts with HEAT repeats 7-19 of importin β similar to an αIBB domain and not only with the N terminus of the protein (residues 1-618), as reported previously (20Rollenhagen C. Muhlhausser P. Kutay U. Pante N. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 2104-2115Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Within the sIBB-(25-65) domain, the C-terminal helix (residues 41-65) makes fewer and weaker contacts with importin β than the N-terminal residues 25-40 of SNP1. This observation partially explains why an N-terminal fragment of importin β (residues 1-618) shows relatively high binding affinity for the sIBB domain (20Rollenhagen C. Muhlhausser P. Kutay U. Pante N. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 2104-2115Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 35Ospina J.K. Gonsalvez G.B. Bednenko J. Darzynkiewicz E. Gerace L. Matera A.G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 4660-4671Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), but it fails to bind the αIBB domain (39Kutay U. Izaurralde E. Bischoff F.R. Mattaj I.W. Gorlich D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1153-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Likewise, the paucity of contacts between the sIBB helix (residues 41-65) and importin β may explain the fast rate of dissociation measured by SPR between importin β and the sIBB-(25-65) domain as compared with its counterpart, the αIBB domain (38Catimel B. Teh T. Fontes M.R. Jennings I.G. Jans D.A. Howlett G.J. Nice E.C. Kobe B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34189-34198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). In addition to the αIBB region of homology, SNP1 presents a novel binding determinant for importin β between residues 1 and 24. This region interacts weakly with importin β (Kd ∼ 30 μm) when isolated from SNP1 but synergizes with the sIBB-(25-65) moiety in the context of the sIBB-(1-65) domain to confer low nanomolar binding affinity and a slow rate of dissociation from importin β. Therefore, we propose that the sn-(1-24) acts as a molecular hook to retain SNP1 bound to importin β. Interestingly, sn-(1-24) shares high sequence identity to the region 1011-1035 of Nup153, which is localized at the nuclear basket (40Tran E.J. Wente S.R. Cell. 2006; 125: 1041-1053Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar) and is known to bind importin β with nanomolar affinity (25Bednenko J. Cingolani G. Gerace L. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 391-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). This prompts the intriguing idea of a direct displacement of the sn-(1-24) from importin β within the snRNP-SNP1-importin β import complex at the nuclear basket. Notably, this scenario is conceptually analogous to what was reported for the yeast nucleoporin Nup2p, which is also associated with the nuclear basket (41Matsuura Y. Lange A. Harreman M.T. Corbett A.H. Stewart M. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 5358-5369Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 42Gilchrist D. Rexach M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 51937-51949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Residues 1-51 of Nup2p bind tightly to Kap60p, the yeast homologue of importin α, and thus accelerate the release of nuclear localization sequence cargos from Kap60p. In addition, the region 1-24 of SNP1 was also shown to be critical for binding to Crm1, which, in complex with RanGTP, recycles SNP1 back to the cytoplasm (24Paraskeva E. Izaurralde E. Bischoff F.R. Huber J. Kutay U. Hartmann E. Luhrmann R. Gorlich D. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 255-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). How do our data fit with the observation that in digitonin-permeabilized cells, the sIBB domain promotes Ran- and energy-independent nuclear import (23Huber J. Dickmanns A. Luhrmann R. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 467-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar)? The structural and biochemical work presented in this study challenges the idea of a simple Ran-independent nuclear import pathway in at least three ways. First, at the three-dimensional level, the conformation of importin β bound to the sIBB domain is very similar to that adopted in complex with the αIBB domain, which requires RanGTP to undergo a dramatic conformational change necessary to release the import cargo (11Lee S.J. Matsuura Y. Liu S.M. Stewart M. Nature. 2005; 435: 693-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Second, the sIBB domain binds importin β with low nanomolar binding affinity, which is incompatible with a Ran-independent cargo release into the nucleus. Third, in vitro, RanGTP, and not RanGDP, specifically disrupts the importin β-sIBB complex. To complement these data, we provide evidences that region 1-24 of SNP1 contains a Nup153-like motif that modulates both the strength of interaction and the off rate of the sIBB domain from importin β. We propose that the sn-(1-24) plays an important functional role during the import reaction by reducing the avidity of the NPC for the sIBB-import complex. This could be explained, for instance, by a simple intermolecular contact between the SNP1 moiety sn-(1-24), which contain a 12FSVS15 repeat, and the major nucleoporin-binding site in importin β (25Bednenko J. Cingolani G. Gerace L. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 391-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Such an interaction would reduce the avidity of the sIBB-import complex for nucleoporins and possibly allow translocation of the import complex through the NPC in permeabilized cells, in the absence of exogenous RanGTP. The idea of a reduced avidity of the NPC for the sIBB-import complex agrees well with the observation that a chimera of the sIBB-(1-65) fused to the β-galactosidase, sIBB-β-galactosidase, remains associated for less time to the nuclear basket than an αIBB-β-galactosidase, suggesting a reduced stalling of the sIBB-import complex inside the NPC (20Rollenhagen C. Muhlhausser P. Kutay U. Pante N. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 2104-2115Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). However, if the reduced avidity of the sIBB-import complex for the NPC may be sufficient to explain why in permeabilized cells the sIBB domain translocates efficiently without the addition of exogenous Ran, it does not explain in an in vivo setting what energizes the active release (and thus nuclear import) of sIBB-import cargos into the cell nucleus. In agreement with the observation that in vitro the sIBB-importin β interaction is specifically disrupted by RanGTP, we propose that GTP hydrolysis by the small GTPase Ran remains the driving force of the dissociation of SNP1 from importin β. Further studies are needed to better understand this important import pathway. In particular, it will be necessary to develop a functional assay that allows discrimination between nuclear passage of the sIBB-import complex and dissociation from importin β, and that defines the energetic requirement of these two processes.

https://openalex.org/W2046695487,"Cell shrinkage, or apoptotic volume decrease (AVD), is a ubiquitous characteristic of programmed cell death that is independent of the death stimulus and occurs in all examples of apoptosis. Here we distinguished two specific stages of AVD based on cell size and a unique early reversal of intracellular ions that occurs in response to activation of both intrinsic and extrinsic cell death signal pathways. The primary stage of AVD is characterized by an early exchange of the normal intracellular ion distribution for sodium from 12 to 113.6 mm and potassium from 139.5 to 30 mm. This early ionic reversal is associated with a 20-40% decrease in cell volume, externalization of phosphatidylserine, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, and caspase activation and activity along with nuclear condensation that occurs independent of actin cytoskeleton disruption. Disruption of the actin cytoskeleton, however, prevents a secondary stage of AVD in apoptotic cells, characterized by a loss of both potassium and sodium that results in an 80-85% loss in cell volume, DNA degradation, and apoptotic body formation. Together these studies demonstrate that AVD occurs in two distinct stages with the earliest stage reflecting a cellular cationic gradient reversal.

Together these studies demonstrate that AVD occurs in two distinct stages with the earliest stage reflecting a cellular cationic gradient reversal. Apoptosis, or programmed cell death, is a fundamental process in which activation of specific biochemical and morphological events results in death. Cell volume loss, chromatin condensation, and internucleosomal DNA fragmentation are all defining characteristics of this mode of cell death (1Kerr J.F. Wyllie A.H. Currie A.R. Br. J. Cancer. 1972; 26: 239-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (12714) Google Scholar, 2Hengartner M.O. Nature. 2000; 407: 770-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (6206) Google Scholar). Externalization of phosphatidylserine, depolarization of the mitochondrial membrane potential along with release of various mitochondrial components, and caspase activity have also been used to identify apoptosis (3Jiang X.

The interplay of these catabolic events in the cell death program in relation to the loss of cell volume is not well understood.Apoptotic volume decrease (AVD 2The abbreviations used are:AVDapoptotic volume decreasePBSphosphate-buffered salineFasLFas ligandPIpropidium iodideCBcytochalasin BFSCforward scatterSSCside scatterPARPpoly(A)DP-ribose polymerasePBFIpotassium binding benzofuran isophthalate.2The abbreviations used are:AVDapoptotic volume decreasePBSphosphate-buffered salineFasLFas ligandPIpropidium iodideCBcytochalasin BFSCforward scatterSSCside scatterPARPpoly(A)DP-ribose polymerasePBFIpotassium binding benzofuran isophthalate.

The movement of monovalent ions, particularly sodium and potassium, has been shown to play a pivotal role in both the activation and execution of apoptosis (7Bortner C.D. Cidlowski J.A. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 2004; 448: 313-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 8Barros L.F. Castro J. Bittner C.X. Biol. Res. 2002; 35: 209-214PubMed Google Scholar, 9Bortner C.D. Cidlowski J.A. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2002; 42: 259-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Loss of intracellular sodium and potassium has been shown to occur in the shrunken population of apoptotic cells as part of AVD (6Maeno E. Ishizaki Y. Kanaseki T. Hazama A. Okada Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9487-9492Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar, 10Yu S.P. Choi D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

However, earlier studies have shown that an increase in intracellular sodium also occurs during apoptosis (12Bortner C.D. Gomez-Angelats M. Cidlowski J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4304-4314Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 13Bortner C.D. Cidlowski J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 39176-39184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Studies with sodium-substituted media revealed that sodium influx is a necessary requirement for AVD during apoptosis in cells treated with Fas ligand, since apoptotic stimulation in the absence of extracellular sodium resulted in cellular swelling rather than shrinkage (13Bortner C.D. Cidlowski J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 39176-39184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Despite this swelling of cells, other well defined characteristics of apoptosis including chromatin condensation, externalization of the phosphatidylserine, caspase activity, and DNA degradation persisted. Furthermore, maintenance of normal physiologic intracellular ion concentrations has been shown to inhibit caspase activation and apoptotic nuclease activity during programmed cell death (14Cain K.

Vardaki E.A. Stournaras C. Cell. Physiol. Biochem. 2000; 10: 257-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 19Sheng M. Pak D.T. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2000; 62: 79-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). The importance of ion redistribution during apoptosis has, thus, led us to consider the potential role of the actin cytoskeleton in the cell death program during AVD. Disruption of the actin cytoskeleton has been reported to impede the progression of apoptosis and prevent the formation of apoptotic bodies in response to apoptotic stimuli in a cell-type and stimulus-dependent manner (20Cotter T.G. Lennon S.V. Glynn J.M. Green D.R. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 997-1005PubMed Google Scholar, 21Morley S.C. Sun G.P. Bierer B.E. J. Cell. Biochem. 2003; 88: 1066-1076Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Reorganization of various cytoskeletal proteins occurs during apoptosis, suggesting a necessary role for the cytoskeleton in the formation of apoptotic bodies (20Cotter T.G. Lennon S.V. Glynn J.M.

Int. 2004; 28: 471-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar).We have now examined the effect of cytoskeletal disruption on Fas ligand (FasL)- and UV-stimulated Jurkat T-cells, well studied models of apoptosis that are amenable to single cell analysis of cell death via flow cytometry and microscopy and show that AVD during apoptosis occurs in two distinct stages. Importantly, we observed an early, previously undescribed ionic imbalance of intracellular potassium and sodium that occurs during the primary stage of AVD. Direct measurements of intracellular sodium and potassium during this primary stage of AVD suggest a reversal of the intracellular cationic gradient resulting in an overall loss of intracellular ionic strength. The decrease of intracellular potassium concentration coupled to an increase in intracellular sodium concentration coincides with early molecular characteristics of apoptotic cells, where disruption of the actin cytoskeleton does not play a major role. In turn, disruption of the actin cytoskeleton prevents the subsequent loss of cellular ions and a secondary stage of AVD, including the later features (DNA degradation, apoptotic body formation) of the program cell death program.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture and Reagents—Jurkat cells, E6.1 (human lymphoma), and HL-60 cells (human promyelocytic leukemia) were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium, 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 4 mm glutamine, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C, 7% or 5% CO2 atmosphere, respectively. Ramos cells (human Burkitt's lymphoma) were cultured similar to the HL-60 cells, with the exception of using Invitrogen heat-inactivated calf serum. Induction of apoptosis in these various cells (5 × 105 cells per ml) was accomplished using Fas Ligand (Kamiya Biomedical) or UV-C irradiation using a Stratalinker (Stratagene) at the doses described. All incubations were at 37 °C, 7% or 5% CO2 atmosphere for Jurket or for Ramos and HL-60 cells, respectively. Cytochalasin B, cytochalasin D, and cytochalasin E were purchased from Sigma and used at 5 μm final concentration (2.5 μm final for Ramos cells). Latrunculin-A was purchased from Molecular Probes and used at 2.5 μm final concentration.Staining Jurkat Cells with Phalloidin, Deoxyribonuclease I, and Hoechst 33342—Chromatin condensation of live cells was examined by Hoechst 33342 (10 μg/ml final) staining for 30 min before apoptotic stimulation. Changes in F- and G-actin were examined by confocal microscopy by staining control and treated Jurkat cells with Alexa Fluor 488 phalliodin and Alexa Fluor 594 deoxyribonuclease I, respectively. Coverslips were cleaned (100% acetone for 15 min), washed in distilled water, and air-dried. Cleaned coverslips were treated with 200 μg/ml poly-d-lysine for 30 min, drained, and air-dried. Jurkat cells (5 ml at 5 × 105 cells per ml) were harvested, washed in 1× PBS, and then resuspended in 5 ml of 3.7% paraformaldehyde, PBS for 20 min at room temperature. The cells were then harvested, washed in 5 ml of 1× PBS, and resuspended in 100 μl of PBS, and then 30 μl of each sample were placed on the pre-cleaned, poly-d-lysine-coated coverslips for 30 min. After 30 min, the coverslips were gently washed twice in PBS and drained. Each cell-laden coverslip was then treated with 300 μl of 0.1% Triton X for 5 min at room temperature. The coverslips were gently washed 3 times in 1× PBS. Each coverslip was then treated with 30 μl of 1% bovine serum albumin, PBS for 20 min at room temperature. The coverslips were drained and incubated with 30 μl of the antibody mixture that contained 1 unit of Alexa Fluor 488 phalloidin (for F-actin), 10 μg/ml Alexa Fluor 594 deoxyribonuclease I (for G-actin), and 12.5 μg/ml Hoechst 33342 in bovine serum albumin, PBS for 20 min at room temperature. Finally, the coverslips were drained, washed twice in 1× PBS, and mounted onto a slide using Gel/Mount (Biomeda, Foster City, CA) for confocal examination.Microscopy—A laser-scanning confocal microscope (LSM 510 NLO mounted on Axiovert 100 m microscope, Carl Zeiss, Inc.) was used to obtain fluorescent and differential interference contrast images. The images were obtained simultaneously using the 364-nm line from the included Enterprise ion laser (Coherent Laser, Auburn, CA) for the Hoechst dye, a 488-nm argon laser for the Alexa Fluor 488 phalloidin, and a 543-nm HeNe laser for the Alexa Fluor 594 deoxyribonuclease I using a Zeiss Plan-Apo 63× oil N.A. = 1.4 objective lens. Hoechst, phalloidin, and deoxyribonuclease I fluorescence was collected with a 435-485 BP, a 505LP, and a 560LP filter, respectively. The software used for acquisition and analysis was Zeiss LSM510 Version 3.2 for Windows NT and LSM Image Examiner (licensed) Version 3.2 for Windows NT, respectively.Analysis of Cell Size by Flow Cytometry and Flow Analyzer—Cell size was examined by flow cytometry using a BD BD Biosciences FACSort flow cytometer with CellQuest software. Changes in the forward-light-scattering properties of the cells were used to indicate a change in cell size. Electronic sizing of cells to determine changes in cell diameter and cell volume were accomplished using an NPE Quanta Flow Analyzer equipped with a mercury arc lamp and a 365-nm exciter. The electronic volume channel was calibrated using 6-μm UV beads (Molecular Probes) by positioning this size bead in channel 95 on the volume scale.Analysis of Cellular Membrane Lipid Symmetry by Flow Cytometry—Phosphatidylserine symmetry was determined using annexin-V conjugated to fluorescein isothiocyanate (Trevigen, Gaithersburg, MD) according to the manufacture's instructions. Analysis was carried out using a BD Biosciences FACSort flow cytometer with CellQuest software. 10,000 cells were excited at 488 nm and examined at 530 and 585 nm for Annexin-fluorescein isothiocyanate and propidium iodide (PI) fluorescence, respectively.Analysis of Mitochondrial Membrane Potential by Flow Cytometry—Changes in the mitochondrial membrane potential were measured by flow cytometry using JC-1 (Molecular Probes). Thirty minutes before cytometric analysis, JC-1 was added to 1 ml of cells to a final concentration of 10 μm and incubated at 37 °C, 7% CO2 atmosphere. At the designated time, 10,000 cells were examined for each sample on a FL-1 (530 nm) versus FL-2 (585 nm) dot plot on a BD Biosciences FACSort equipped with CellQuest software. JC-1 has dual emission depending on the state of the mitochondrial membrane potential. JC-1 forms aggregates in cells with a high FL-2 fluorescence, indicating a normal mitochondrial membrane potential. Loss of the mitochondrial membrane potential results in a reduction in FL-2 fluorescence with a concurrent gain in FL-1 fluorescence as the dye shifts from an aggregate to monomeric state. Therefore, retention of the dye in the cell can be monitored through the increase in FL-1 fluorescence. The data were converted to density plots using CellQuest software for presentation.Analysis of Active Caspase-3 by Flow Cytometry—Caspase activity for caspase-3/7-like enzymes was accomplished using a CaspaTag in situ assay kit (Chemicon) according to the manufacture's instructions. Briefly, 1 h before cytometric analysis, 300 μl of cells was added to 10 μl of a 30× CaspaTag reagent working stock. Immediately before cytometric analysis, the cells were washed in 2 ml of CaspaTag wash buffer and then resuspended in 500 μl of PBS. Two μl of PI (supplied in the kit) was added to each sample, and the cells were examined using a BD Biosciences FACSort equipped with CellQuest software. For each sample, 10,000 cells were examined at 530 and 585 nm for CaspaTag and PI fluorescence, respectively.Western Blot Analysis—Western blot analysis for poly(A)DP-ribose polymerase (PARP) cleavage was accomplished by running 50 μg/sample of protein extract on a 4-20% polyacrylamide gel (Novex/Invitrogen) and transferring the samples to nitrocellulose. The membrane was incubated with primary anti-PARP antibody (BD Transduction Laboratories) overnight at a concentration of 500 ng/ml, then subsequently incubated with an anti-mouse secondary antibody (Amersham Biosciences) following the manufacturer's recommended protocol. Visualization was achieved on film with the ECL chemiluminescent system (Amersham Biosciences).DNA Analysis by Flow Cytometry—The DNA content for each sample was determined by flow cytometry as previously described (16Bortner C.D. Hughes Jr., F.M. Cidlowski J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32436-32442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). Analysis was carried out using a BD Biosciences FACSort, gating on a PI area versus width dot plot to exclude cell debris and cell aggregates. The percentage of degraded DNA was determined by the number of cells with subdiploid DNA divided by the total number of cells examined under each experimental condition.Intracellular Sodium and Potassium by Flow Cytometry—For intracellular sodium and potassium measurements, 2 μl of 2.5 mm CoroNa Green-AM (Na+) or PBFI-AM (K+) (Molecular Probes) stock were added to 1 ml of cells for a final concentration of 5 μm 1 h before the time of examination. Incubation was continued at 37 °C, 7% CO2 atmosphere. Immediately before flow cytometric examination, PI (Sigma) was added to a final concentration of 10 μg/ml. 10,000 cells were analyzed by sequential excitation of the cells containing PBFI-AM (K+) or CoroNa Green-AM and PI at 340-350 or 488 nm, respectively, using a FACS-Vantage SE flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) and CellQuest software.Determination of Intracellular Potassium, Annexin-V Binding, and Electronic Cell Volume by Flow Analysis—Analysis of intracellular potassium, annexin-V binding, and electronic sizing of cells was accomplished using the NPE Quanta Flow Analyzer. Calibration of the electronic volume channel was accomplished as described above. Cells stained with PBFI at 37 °C, 7% CO2 atmosphere for 1 h were tagged with annexin-biotin (Trevigen) as described by the manufacturer. Cells were resuspended in 100 μl of 1× annexin-V binding buffer then stained with 3 μl of 655 streptavidin-conjugated Q-dots (Quantum Dot Corp., Hayward, CA). The samples were incubated for 15 min at room temperature, then 400 μl of 1× annexin-V binding buffer was added to each sample. The cells were immediately examined on the NPE Quanta Flow Analyzer equipped with a mercury arc lamp using a 365-nm exciter. PBFI fluorescence and the 655 streptavidin-conjugated Q-dots were detected using a 450/55 bandpass filter and a 610SP splitter in front of a 640LP filter, respectively. 10,000 cells were examined for each sample, and the data were analyzed using the NPE Quanta software.Cell Sorting and Determination of Intracellular Potassium by Atomic Absorption—Physical sorting of various cell populations was accomplished using a FACSVantage SE flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) equipped with digital electronics and FACSDiVa software. Sorted cells were collected into chilled 12 × 75 Falcon tubes, previously coated overnight with RPMI 1640 media containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum. Sorted cells were allowed to recover for ∼15 min before pelleting the cells. Cell pellets were resuspended in 0.5 ml of 1× PBS or 170 mm choline chloride, then layered onto 0.5 ml of oil (3 parts 1-bromodecane:7 parts 1-bromododecane), which was layer on top of 200 μl of 15% trichloroacetic acid in a 1.5-ml Eppendorf tube. The tubes were centrifuged horizontally for 30 s in a Beckman Microfuge. After centrifugation, the top aqueous layer and some of the oil layer was removed. The bottom trichloroacetic acid layer containing the contents of the lysed cells was removed with a 1-ml syringe/22-guage needle and saved for atomic absorption analysis. The remaining oil and trichloroacetic acid was removed, and the lysed cell pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of distilled H2O overnight at room temperature before DNA analysis. Analysis of the potassium and sodium content in the trichloroacetic acid fraction was accomplished using a PerkinElmer Life Sciences AA800 flame spectrophotometer. A five-point potassium or sodium standard calibration protocol with standards of known value was used to optimize the instrument. For potassium measurements, each experimental sample was diluted 1:50 in distilled H2O and analyzed twice in triplicate. For sodium measurements, each experimental sample was diluted 1:10 in distilled H2O and analyzed once in triplicate. DNA analysis was accomplished by reading 900 μl of each sample using a Beckman Coulter DU 800 Spectrophotometer. A ratio of potassium or sodium content to DNA was used to calculate a change in intracellular potassium and sodium.Statistics—Tukey's multiple comparison tests were accomplished to evaluate the statistical relevance of the control and experimental samples for all apoptotic parameters studied. Tukey's multiple comparison tests were also done for the FasL- and UV-treated samples in the absence of CB in determining mean cell volume, comparing the high potassium/high annexin (primary stage) and the low potassium (secondary stage) population of cells to the high potassium/low annexin (normal) population for each sample. Samples treated with CB (high potassium/low annexin (normal) versus high potassium/high annexin (primary stage)) were compared using an unpaired t test.RESULTSA Role for the Cytoskeleton in the Morphological Properties of Jurkat T Cells Undergoing Apoptosis—Changes in cellular morphology were determined alone or in combination with cytochalasin B (CB) treatment in Jurkat cells treated with either an extrinsic apoptotic stimulus (FasL) or an intrinsic apoptotic stimulus (UV irradiation). Hoechst 33342-stained Jurkat cells treated with either 50 ng/ml FasL or 60 mJ/cm2 UV in the absence of 5 μm CB for 4 h showed classical apoptotic morphology of cell shrinkage, nuclear condensation, and membrane blebbing characteristic of apoptotic body formation as assessed by differential interference contrast microscopy (Fig. 1A). In the presence of CB, FasL- or UV-treated Jurkat cells also exhibited nuclear condensation similar to apoptotic cells in the absence of CB; however, there was a marked absence of membrane blebbing (Fig. 1A). To verify the disruption of microfilaments after CB treatment, we examined Jurkat cells with an Alexa Fluor 488 phalloidin antibody (for F-actin) and an Alexa Fluor 594 deoxyribonuclease I antibody (for G-actin, see Fig. 1B). Reduced staining for F-actin along with the occurrence of actin aggregates characteristic of microfilament disruption was evident in cells treated with CB alone (21Morley S.C. Sun G.P. Bierer B.E. J. Cell. Biochem. 2003; 88: 1066-1076Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 22Levee M.G. Dabrowska M.I. Lelli J.L. Hinshaw D.B. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: C1981-C1992Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, a complete loss of F-actin staining was observed in cells with condensed nuclei after treatment with an apoptotic stimulus in combination with CB (Fig. 1B). Together, these data indicate that microfilament disruption with CB prevents membrane blebbing and resultant apoptotic body formation but not nuclear condensation in apoptotic Jurkat T cells.Disruption of the Actin Cytoskeleton Reveals AVD as a Two-step Process—We also examined FasL- and UV-treated Jurkat cells by flow cytometry to determine whether changes in their light-scattering properties result from microfilament disruption. Light scatter is detected in the forward direction (forward scatter (FSC)) or at a 90° angle (side scatter (SSC)) as a direct measure of cell size or granularity, respectively. In the forward direction, smaller cells have a lower FSC, whereas larger cells have a higher FSC. Analysis of apoptotic stimulation of Jurkat cells with either FasL or UV on a fetal calf serum versus a SSC three-dimensional plot showed a dramatic decrease in forward-scattered light indicative of a loss in cell size (Fig. 2A). In contrast, induction of apoptosis in the presence of CB resulted in a marked reduction in the shrunken population of cells (Fig. 2A, red circles). Similar results were observed when CB was replaced with other actin cytoskeleton-disrupting agents such as cytochalasin D, cytochalasin E, or latrunculin A (data not shown). Interestingly, a distinct intermediate-sized population of cells characterized by a decrease in FSC and an increase in SSC was clearly apparent after apoptotic induction in the presence of CB (Fig. 2A). Changes in cell size during apoptosis were also determined in the presence or absence of CB by examining control and apoptotic Jurkat cells on FSC histograms (Fig. 2B). Margins were drawn on these FSC histograms to distinguish the different populations of cells apparent on the FSC versus SSC three-dimensional plots. This quantitative analysis clearly resolved the presence of two distinct stages of cell shrinkage; that is, a primary stage resulting from an initial loss of cell size not affected by disruption of the cytoskeleton and a secondary stage resulting from a pronounced loss of cell size in cells that is dependent on an intact actin cytoskeleton.FIGURE 2Treatment of Jurkat cells with CB unmasks two distinct stages of AVD during FasL- and UV-induced apoptosis. Jurkat cells treated with 50 ng/ml Fas ligand or 60 mJ/cm2 UV in the presence or absence of 5μm CB for 4 h were examined for changes in cell size by flow cytometry. A, Jurkat cells were initially analyzed on a FSC (cell size) versus SSC (cell granularity) three-dimensional plot. A decrease in FSC indicates a loss in cell size. The red circle denotes the location of a shrunken population in apoptotic-stimulated cells in these three-dimensional plots that is markedly absent in the presence of CB. B, FSC histograms of control (Con) and apoptotic-stimulated Jurkat cells in the presence and absence of CB. The white lines on the plots denote the various stages of cell shrinkage. The bar graphs show the percentage of cells that comprise the various stages of AVD as determined from the FSC histograms and are the average of at least three individual experiments (#, p < 0.05). C, Jurkat cells analyzed over time on a FSC versus SSC three-dimensional plot for the occurrence of stages of AVD. The presence of the secondary stage of AVD occurs as early as 2 h post-treatment and continues to increase over the course of the study. D, Ramos cells and HL-60 cells after a 4-h treatment with 120 or 20 mJ/cm2 UV, respectively, in the presence and absence of CB, analyzed for the occurrence of stages of AVD. Similar to the Jurkat cells, CB prevents the secondary stage of AVD.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We also examined Jurket cells for the presence of both these stages of AVD over time in response to FasL or UV alone or in the presence of CB (Fig. 2C). Our data show a time-dependent increase in the secondary stage of AVD upon apoptotic stimulation with either agent beginning around 2 h after treatment, which is prevented by CB. Additionally, we examined other cell types for these stages of AVD. Both Ramos cells (a human B-lymphocyte) and HL-60 cells (human promyelocytic leukemia) also showed two distinct stages of AVD upon induction of apoptosis in the absence of CB (Fig. 2D). Interestingly, inclusion of CB prevented the secondary stage of AVD, suggesting that the occurrence of AVD stages is not cell type-specific.AVD Stage-specific Characteristics of Apoptosis—Various other characteristics of apoptosis were also evaluated in regard to the primary and secondary stage of AVD. Examination of phosphatidylserine externalization showed a significant change in the percentage of apoptotic Jurkat cells compared with control cells regardless of the presence or absence of CB (Fig. 3A). Interestingly, the effects of microfilament disruption on changes in the mitochondrial membrane potential were similar to the results shown for phosphatidylserine externalization since a loss of mitochondrial membrane potential was also observed in response to apoptotic stimulation in the presence of CB (Fig. 3B). We also examined caspase-3-like activity in these cells and observed that this enzyme activity was also independent of CB (Fig. 3C), suggesting that caspase activity is associated with the primary stage of AVD. These effects are likely not cell type-specific as both Ramos and HL-60 cells also showed enhanced phosphatidylserine externalization and caspase activity in the presence of CB (Tables 1 and 2). Note, however, that in contrast to Jurkat and Ramos cel"

Plots of steady-state rates of product formation versus substrate concentration were hyperbolic for αNF epoxidation but highly cooperative (Hill n coefficients of 2-4) for pyrene and 1-OH pyrene hydroxylation. When any of the three substrates (αNF, pyrene, 1-OH pyrene) were mixed with ferric P450 1A2 using stopped-flow methods, the changes in the heme Soret spectra were relatively slow and multiphasic. Changes in the fluorescence of all of the substrates were much faster, consistent with rapid initial binding to P450 1A2 in a manner that does not change the heme spectrum. For binding of pyrene to ferrous P450 1A2, the course of the spectra revealed sequential changes in opposite directions, consistent with P450 1A2 being involved in a series of transitions to explain the kinetic multiphasicity as opposed to multiple, slowly interconverting populations of enzyme undergoing the same event at different rates. Models of rabbit P450 1A2 based on a published crystal structure of a human P450 1A2-αNF complex show active site space for only one αNF or for two pyrenes. The spectral changes observed for binding and hydroxylation of pyrene and 1-OH pyrene could be fit to a kinetic model in which hydroxylation occurs only when two substrates are bound.

These hemoproteins mainly catalyze mixed function oxidations, using the general cycle shown in Fig. 1, but can use similar chemistry at the heme iron prosthetic group to do reductions, rearrangements of unstable oxygenated chemicals, and several other reactions (3Guengerich F.P. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 2001; 14: 611-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (1322) Google Scholar). Collectively, the thousands of reactions catalyzed by the mammalian P450s can be categorized as using sterols, fatty acids, fat-soluble vitamins, and xenobiotic chemicals as substrates (4Guengerich F.P.

Most reactions catalyzed by P450s can be described with hyperbolic, classical Michaelis-Menten kinetics. However, examples of heterotropic cooperativity (i.e. one ligand enhancing the rate of oxidation of another (5Kuby S.A. A Study of Enzymes. 1. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1991: 283-300Google Scholar)) were reported in the 1970s (6Wiebel F.J. Leutz J.C. Diamond L. Gelboin H.V. Arch. Biochem.

A Study of Enzymes. 1. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1991: 283-300Google Scholar) began to appear (10Guengerich F.P. Kim B.-R. Gillam E.M.J. Shimada T. Lechner M.C.

Examples of in vivo evidence for heterotropic cooperativity are known (12Lasker J.M. Huang M.-T. Conney A.H. Science. 1982; 216: 1419-1421Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 13Ngui J.S.

Homotropic cooperativity is difficult to demonstrate in vivo, but the process can be documented in isolated hepatocytes (14Witherow L.E. Houston J.B. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1999; 290: 58-65PubMed Google Scholar). Explanations and hypotheses have been presented for (human) P450 3A4, perhaps the most commonly reported example of P450 cooperativity, and also other P450s for which cooperative behavior has been reported, particularly (human) P450s 2C8, 2C9, 2B6, and 1A2 (4Guengerich F.P.

Most of these P450s that have been crystallized have large cavities for ligand binding (19Williams P.A. Cosme J. Ward A. Angove H.C. Vinkovic Matak D. Jhoti H.

Chem. 2004; 279: 38091-38094Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar). A full discussion of the field is beyond the scope of this introduction and the reader is referred to some of the more recent reviews (4Guengerich F.P. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. 3rd Ed. Cytochrome P450: Structure, Mechanism, and Biochemistry. Kluwer Academic/Plenum Press, New York2005: 377-530Google Scholar, 17Atkins W.M. Expert Opin. Drug Metab. Toxicol. 2006; 2: 573-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 18Tracy T.S. Drugs Res. Dev. 2006; 7: 349-363Google Scholar). Some of the major features of the more common proposals include the following: (i) a classic allosteric reaction with a second ligand-binding site controlling binding to the catalytic substrate-binding site (22Johnson E.F. Schwab G.E. Dieter H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 2785-2788Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Schwab G.E. Raucy J.L. Johnson E.F. Mol. Pharmacol. 1988; 33: 493-499PubMed Google Scholar); (ii) co-occupancy of the cognate substrate-binding site with multiple ligands, leading to a more productive rearrangement of the substrate for catalysis because of either steric packing or more specific protein-ligand interactions (11Shou M. Grogan J. Mancewicz J.A. Krausz K.W. Gonzalez F.J. Gelboin H.V. Korzekwa K.R. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6450-6455Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar, 24Harlow G.R. Halpert J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6636-6641Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 25Hosea N.A. Miller G.P. Guengerich F.P. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 5929-5939Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar); (iii) selective populations of P450 (in slow equilibrium) that interact in different ways (26Koley A.P. Buters J.T.M. Robinson R.C. Markowitz A. Friedman F.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3149-3152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar); (iv) multimeric states of P450 (27Fernando H. Davydov D.R. Chin C.C. Halpert J.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2007; 460: 129-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) and possibly interactions with accessory proteins (28Jushchyshyn M.I. Hutzler J.M. Schrag M.L. Wienkers L.C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2005; 438: 21-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) that are involved; and (v) elements of an induced fit process, in which the protein adapts a conformation as a result of an initial interaction with a ligand (29Ekroos M. Sjögren T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 13682-13687Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar). Some of these possibilities are not mutually exclusive. Deficiencies in this area are the small extent of cooperativity seen in many cases (i.e. low n values in Hill plots), the often limited number of experimental data points, and the over interpretation of models based on limited data. P450 1A2 is an important enzyme, not so much in regard to physiological function per se but because of its role in the oxidation of many drugs (30Williams J.A. Hyland R. Jones B.C. Smith D.A. Hurst S. Goosen T.C. Peterkin V. Koup J.R. Ball S.E. Drug Metab. Dispos. 2004; 32: 1201-1208Crossref PubMed Scopus (742) Google Scholar) and carcinogens, particularly aryl and heterocyclic amines (31Kim D. Guengerich F.P. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2005; 45: 27-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). A recent crystal structure of the protein bound to the inhibitor αNF provides insight into how this protein binds substrates (32Sansen S. Yano J.K. Reynald R.L. Schoch G. Griffin K. Stout C.D. Johnson E.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 14348-14355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). The active site is somewhat larger than necessary for the ligand αNF to fit, but the accessible volume is considerably less than that available in other mammalian P450s, e.g. 2C8, 2C9, and 3A4 (19Williams P.A. Cosme J. Ward A. Angove H.C. Vinkovic Matak D. Jhoti H. Nature. 2003; 424: 464-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (763) Google Scholar, 20Williams P.A. Cosme J. Vinkovic D.M. Ward A. Angove H.C. Day P.J. Vonrhein C. Tickle I.J. Jhoti H. Science. 2004; 305: 683-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar, 21Yano J.K. Wester M.R. Schoch G.A. Griffin K.J. Stout C.D. Johnson E.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 38091-38094Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar). P450 1A2 also exhibits cooperativity in some reactions, at least with regard to homotropic behavior. In the case of O-dealkylation of 1-alkoxy-4-nitrobenzenes, rabbit P450 1A2 showed patterns that could be described mathematically as negative cooperativity (33Miller G.P. Guengerich F.P. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 7262-7272Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). However, a more appropriate fit of the results involves two sets of kcat and Km values. Evidence that these phenomena are the result of concurrent occupancy of the P450 (1A2) by two ligands comes from a study with two ligands, a 1-alkoxy-4-nitrobenzene substrate and the iron ligand 1,4-phenylene diisocyanide, which elicits a heme spectral perturbation opposite to that of the “type I” substrate, i.e. a “type II” change involving an increase in A420 and decrease in A390. A key finding was that the extrapolated Kd values for P450 1A2 binding of 1-alkoxy-4-nitrobenzenes were perturbed when measured in the presence of 1,4-phenylene diisocyanide and vice versa (33Miller G.P. Guengerich F.P. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 7262-7272Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). However, these studies do not reveal details of the mode of interaction. One approach we have utilized to study the cooperativity of P450 3A4 is time-resolved analysis of events in ligand binding, i.e. kinetic studies (34Isin E.M. Guengerich F.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 9127-9136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 35Isin E.M. Guengerich F.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 6863-6874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). These studies have revealed complex, multiphasic, and slow events that are considered relevant to issues in cooperativity, and evidence has been presented that these events have their basis in sequential as opposed to parallel events (34Isin E.M. Guengerich F.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 9127-9136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 35Isin E.M. Guengerich F.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 6863-6874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). These complex events are not seen in the binding of ligands to “simpler” mammalian P450s, e.g. P450 2A6 (36Yun C.-H. Kim K.-H. Calcutt M.W. Guengerich F.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 12279-12291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), or bacterial P450 101A1 (37Griffin B.W. Peterson J.A. Biochemistry. 1972; 11: 4740-4746Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) or P450 105D5 (38Chun Y.-J. Shimada T. Sanchez R.I. Waterman M.R. Guengerich F.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 17486-17500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). We studied rabbit P450 1A2 because its heme spectral properties permit a number of studies that cannot be done with the human ortholog, which is isolated exclusively in the high spin iron state (33Miller G.P. Guengerich F.P. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 7262-7272Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 39Sandhu P. Guo Z. Baba T. Martin M.V. Tukey R.H. Guengerich F.P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 309: 168-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). We found a very strong positive cooperativity pattern for the oxidation of pyrene, unprecedented in P450 literature. Pyrene also proved to be a very useful ligand because of its fluorescence properties. Pre-steady-state kinetic analyses were done using UV-visible, fluorescence, and CD spectroscopy, and comparisons were made with αNF (a substrate that does not show apparent cooperativity). The availability of the crystal structure of a human P450 1A2-αNF complex provided a basis for modeling ligands in rabbit P450 1A2, which may be relevant to cooperative phenomena. Chemicals—αNF, pyrene, 1-OH pyrene, and luminescence grade solvents for fluorescence studies were purchased from Sigma. Pyrene was recrystallized from C2H5OH before use. 1-Isopropoxy-4-nitrobenzene was synthesized as described previously (33Miller G.P. Guengerich F.P. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 7262-7272Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Enzymes—P450 1A2 was purified from liver microsomes prepared from β-naphthoflavone-treated New Zealand White rabbits using a two-step ion-exchange chromatography procedure (40Alterman M.A. Dowgii A.I. Biomed. Chromatogr. 1990; 4: 221-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), as modified (39Sandhu P. Guo Z. Baba T. Martin M.V. Tukey R.H. Guengerich F.P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 309: 168-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). The preparations used in the work contained <13% cytochrome P420, an inactive form. NADPH-P450 reductase (rat) was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified as described elsewhere (41Hanna I.H. Teiber J.F. Kokones K.L. Hollenberg P.F. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 350: 324-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Measurement of Enzyme Activity—Substrates were incubated with a reconstituted enzyme system that generally included 0.25 μm P450 1A2, 0.50 μm NADPH-P450 reductase, 23 μm l-α-1,2-dilauroyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (dispersed by sonication before use), and the substrate of interest, generally in a reaction volume of 1.5 ml. All incubations were in 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) (the enzyme precipitates at lower ionic strength). Stock concentrations of substrates were prepared in CH3OH, and the final concentration of CH3OH in reactions was ≤1% (v/v). The reported solubility of pyrene in H2O is 0.65 μm (42Shiu W.-Y. Ma K.-C. J. Phys. Chem. Ref. Data. 2000; 29: 46Google Scholar). The solubility under the experimental conditions used here is probably higher, with a 1% (v/v) concentration of organic solvent (and dispersion in some cases with the phospholipid vesicles and possibly the proteins). Catalytic studies with polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, including pyrene and particularly benzo[a]pyrene, have often been done at relatively high concentrations (50-80 μm (43Nebert D.W. Gelboin H.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 6242-6249Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 44Bauer E. Guo Z. Ueng Y.-F. Bell L.C. Guengerich F.P. Chem. Res.

Res. 2004; 94: 262-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar)). However, we generally limited the concentration in the spectroscopic experiments to a low micromolar range to avoid artifacts. Incubations (at 37 °C) were initiated by the addition of an NADPH-generating system (45Guengerich F.P. Bartleson C.J. Hayes A.W. 5th Ed. Principles and Methods of Toxicology. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL2007: 1981-2048Google Scholar) and generally run for 2 min (pyrene), 1.5 min (1-OH pyrene), or 20 min (αNF). Reactions were stopped by the addition of 2.0 ml of CH2Cl2 and mixed with a vortex device, and 1.5 ml of the organic layer was removed and dried under an N2 stream for HPLC analysis. αNF reaction products were dissolved in CH3OH and separated by HPLC using an octadecylsilane (C18) column (6.2 mm × 80 mm, 3 μm; Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA). The following program was used at a flow rate of 1.0 ml min-1 (solvent A, 50% H2O, 10 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4), 50% CH3OH; solvent B, 100% CH3OH): 0-4 min, linear gradient from 0 to 100% B; 4-10 min, 100% B (isocratic). Separations were monitored by scanning from 290 to 400 nm using a ThermoFinnigan UV3000 rapid-scanning UV detector (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). P450 3A4 has been shown previously to oxidize αNF only to the 5,6-oxide (25Hosea N.A. Miller G.P. Guengerich F.P. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 5929-5939Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). P450 3A4/NADPH-P450 reductase-containing bacterial membranes (47Parikh A. Gillam E.M.J. Guengerich F.P. Nat. Biotechnol. 1997; 15: 784-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar) were incubated with αNF and prepared for HPLC analysis under identical conditions as the P450 1A2 reactions. One dominant product was observed after αNF oxidation by P450 1A2, which had the same tR and UV spectrum as the 5,6-epoxide product resulting from P450 3A4 oxidation. Quantification of product formation was estimated using the extinction coefficient of αNF (ϵ290 23.7 mm-1 cm-1) (48Ueng Y.-F. Kuwabara T. Chun Y.-J. Guengerich F.P. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 370-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). Pyrene and 1-OH pyrene reaction products were dissolved in CH3OH and separated by HPLC using the following program at a flow rate of 1.0 ml min-1 (solvent A, 90% 10 mm NH4CH3CO2 buffer (pH 6.8), 10% CH3OH (v/v); solvent B, 100% CH3OH): 0-20 min, linear gradient from 45 to 80% B; 20-21 min, linear gradient to 100% B; 21-25 min, 100% B (isocratic). Separation of products was monitored using a McPherson FL-750 BX fluorescence detector (Chelmsford, MA), with excitation at 240 nm and emission monitored using a 380 nm long pass filter, as well as by UV scanning (UV3000 detector, see above, in series) from 230 to 400 nm (49Chetiyanukornkul T. Toriba A. Kizu R. Makino T. Nakazawa H. Hayakaw K. J. Chromatogr. A. 2002; 961: 107-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). After the relevant spectra had been accumulated, individual wavelength traces were used subsequently. Benzo[a]pyrene hydroxylation assays, in which mainly 3-hydroxylation is measured, were done using the basic fluorescence extraction method of Nebert and Gelboin (43Nebert D.W. Gelboin H.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 6242-6249Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), with slight modification (45Guengerich F.P. Bartleson C.J. Hayes A.W. 5th Ed. Principles and Methods of Toxicology.

J. Chromatogr. 1983; 264: 453-458Crossref Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Characterization of Di-OH Pyrene Products—An enzyme system of 0.25 μm P450 1A2, 0.50 μm NADPH-P450 reductase, phospholipid (see above), and 50 μm 1-OH pyrene (total volume 285 ml) was incubated for 10 min under the same conditions as described above, and the products were extracted. HPLC conditions were altered slightly; the following program was used with a flow rate of 1.0 ml min-1 (solvent A, 90% H2O, 10% CH3OH (v/v); solvent B, 100% CH3OH); 0-30 min, linear gradient from 45 to 70% B). Seven sequential HPLC injections (20 μl each) were made, and the four product fractions (peaks 1-4) were collected, based on monitoring by UV absorbance at 275 nm (Fig. 2A). The fractions from each injection were combined, extracted with CH2Cl2, and dried using a rotary evaporator and then under an N2 stream. The four fractions were further dried in vacuo, using a vacuum pump, in a dessicator with P2O5 for 5 h at room temperature. Each sample was then redissolved in d6-acetone and transferred to a 2.5-mm NMR tube under an argon atmosphere for NMR spectroscopy analysis, where one-dimensional, COSY, HSQC, and HMBC 1H (13C) NMR spectra were obtained. Peaks 1 and 4 were then spiked with 60 nmol of CH3CO2H as an internal standard in d6-acetone; 300 nmol of CH3CO2H was added to peaks 2 and 3. The integration of the resulting singlet at 1.96 ppm was set at H = 3 to allow quantitation of the di-OH pyrenes. The fluorescence emission spectrum of each of the fractions was recorded in the NMR solvent (excitation at 240 nm). The fractions were then dried and redissolved in CH3OH, and the absorbance spectra (200-600 nm) were recorded. Anaerobic Experiments—Samples were deaerated in all-glass cuvettes or tonometers using a vacuum/argon manifold system described earlier (51Burleigh Jr., B.D. Foust G.P. Williams Jr., C.H. Anal. Biochem. 1969; 27: 536-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) and modified (52Guengerich F.P. Krauser J.A. Johnson W.W. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 10775-10788Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Contents of tonometers were transferred into the drive syringes of the stopped-flow spectrophotometer as described (52Guengerich F.P. Krauser J.A. Johnson W.W. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 10775-10788Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Anaerobic titrations were done in a glass cuvette/titrator assembly using techniques described previously (53Foust G.P. Burleigh Jr., B.D. Mayhew S.G. Williams Jr., C.H. Massey V. Anal. Biochem. 1969; 27: 530-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Spectroscopy—UV-visible spectra were recorded with either a Cary14/OLIS, an Aminco DW2/OLIS, or a Hewlett-Packard 8452A/OLIS diode array spectrophotometer (On-Line Instrument Systems, Bogart, GA). Steady-state spectral titrations of ferric P450 1A2 with αNF and pyrene were carried out as described previously (54Schenkman J.B. Remmer H. Estabrook R.W. Mol. Pharmacol. 1967; 3: 113-123PubMed Google Scholar). In the case of the 1-OH pyrene titrations, a different procedure was used because of the inherent absorbance of the ligand in the near-UV region. Tandem (Yankeelov) cuvettes were used. At each concentration of 1-OH pyrene, each of two cuvettes contained 1.0 ml of 2.0 μm P450 1A2 in one chamber and twice the desired final concentration of 1-OH pyrene in the other side. A base-line spectrum was recorded in the OLIS-Cary 14 spectrophotometer (mean of duplicate scans). The contents of the two chambers of the sample cuvette were then mixed; the reference cuvette was not mixed. The resulting difference spectrum was recorded (mean of duplicate scans). Fluorescence spectra were recorded with either an OLIS DM-45 (On-Line Instrument Systems) or a Fluorolog-3 spectrofluorometer in the 111 configuration (JY Horiba, Edison, NJ). Steady-state fluorescence spectra were acquired at room temperature, with slit widths corresponding to a 1-3 nm band pass, depending on fluorophore concentration. Either CH3OH or luminescence grade propanol was used to dissolve ligands. For the steady-state titration experiments, either the emission (at a fixed wavelength) or the excitation (at a fixed emission wavelength) scans were recorded. CD spectra were recorded in 1-mm cuvettes with a J-810 instrument (Jasco, Easton, MD) in the Vanderbilt Center for Structural Biology. In the case of the CD scans, P450 1A2 was incubated with substrate for 15 min before taking measurements; kinetic scans were initiated as soon as substrate was added. The absorbance in all CD studies was <0.20. CD output, in millidegrees, was converted to standard mean residue ellipticity, [θ] (in degrees cm2 dmol-1), using the relationship shown in Equation 1, [θ]=100(signal)cnl(Eq. 1) where signal is the CD output in millidegrees, c is the protein concentration in millimolar, n is the number of amino acid residues, and l is the cell path length in centimeters. Stopped-flow absorbance and fluorescence kinetic measurements were made using an OLIS RSM-1000 instrument (On-Line Instrument Systems) as described in detail previously (35Isin E.M. Guengerich F.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 6863-6874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Absorbance (UV-visible) measurements were made in the rapid-scanning mode (scanning 103 spectra s-1); kinetic parameters were derived from traces of absorbance (versus time) at individual wavelengths and fit to single, bi-, or tri-exponential equations using the manufacturer's software. Kinetic fluorescence measurements were made with the OLIS RSM-1000 instrument using long pass or band pass filters (Oriel, Stratford, CT) attached to the photomultiplier tube and utilized a direct kinetic mode, with fitting of data as described for absorbance. In most cases, 1.24-mm slits (8 nm band-width) were used. Data are presented as either “scatter” plots or “connected” signals versus time. Generally, four to eight individual stopped-flow experiments were averaged before subsequent data analyses. Mass and NMR Spectrometry—Liquid chromatography-MS-MS spectra were acquired using an Acquity UPLC system (Waters, Milford, MA) with the same octadecylsilane (C18) column (6.2 mm × 80 mm, 3 μm) as described (see above) connected to a Finnigan LTQ mass spectrometer (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) and operated in the electrospray ionization negative ion mode. Reaction products were redissolved in CH3OH and kept at 4 °C prior to injection with an autosampler, whereas the column was kept at ambient temperature. In addition to an ion scan from m/z 100 to 500, two selective ion monitoring scans at m/z 217 and 233 were taken, which triggered MS-MS fragmen"

Formation of OXPHOS supercomplexes in mitochondria has been conserved throughout evolution, and determination of their functional relevance represents a new developing area of mitochondrial biogenesis research. The supercomplex organizational state of the OXPHOS complexes may confer an enzymatic advantage to these complexes as it has been proposed to enable direct substrate channeling between the complexes (4Boumans H.

In addition the supercomplex organizational state of the ATP synthase plays a role in establishing the architecture of the mitochondrial inner membrane, the principal site of the OXPHOS activity (18Paumard P.

Furthermore, a subset of the TIM23 translocase, involved in the import of nuclearly encoded proteins across the inner membrane, has been shown to exist in association with a subpopulation of the cytochrome bc1-COX supercomplex (28der Laan van M. Wiedemann N. Mick D.U. Guiard B. Rehling P. Pfanner N. Curr. Biol. 2006; 16: 2271-2276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Finally, it has recently been demonstrated that a subpopulation of the cytochrome bc1-COX supercomplex can be found in association with the assembly factors Cox14 and Shy1, which are involved in the biogenesis of the COX complex (29Mick D.U.

Thus it appears that a heterogeneity exists within populations of the cytochrome bc1-COX supercomplex and that different organizational states of these OXPHOS complexes may exist within one given mitochondrial type, thereby adding to the complexity of analyzing and understanding the role(s) of the OXPHOS supercomplex assembly states. The F1F0-ATP synthase complexes exist as higher ordered structures that, under mild detergent conditions, can be solubilized from mitochondrial membranes as dimeric ATP synthase complexes. To date, the dimeric assembly state of the ATP synthase has been best characterized from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, where it has been proposed that the ATP synthase dimers are solubilized from a larger network of ATP synthase oligomers within the mitochondrial inner membrane (6Arnold I.

The F1F0-ATP synthase complex can be divided into two regions, the membrane-embedded, H+-pumping F0 sector and the hydrophilic, catalytic F1 sector located in the mitochondrial matrix (2Ackerman S.H. Tzagoloff A. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 2005; 80: 95-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Dimerization of the ATP synthase complex involves F0-F0 interactions and in a manner involves an interface formed by the F0 sector subunits e, g, and 4 (Su e, Su g, and Atp4, respectively). Su e and Su g proteins (in contrast to Atp4) are not essential for the enzymatic activity of the ATP synthase complex, but like Atp4, Su e and Su g are required to support the stable dimerization of the ATP synthase complex. Current evidence indicates that in the absence of Su e and/or Su g, the ATP synthase dimers can still form in the mitochondrial membrane but that these dimers are not stable under detergent solubilization conditions; hence, monomeric complexes are predominantly observed in extracts of Δsu e and Δsu g mitochondria (30Devenish R.J.

Cristae membranes have been reported to be absent in the su e and su g null yeast mutants and instead the inner membrane has been shown to adopt a proliferated “onion-like” morphology (18Paumard P.

A number of reports in the literature have implicated that the assembly and/or stability of the cytochrome oxidase (COX) complex may be related to that of the ATP synthase complex (39Paul M.F.

As ATP synthase assembly mutants often exhibit instability in their mtDNA (and hence coding capacity for key COX subunits), it could be argued that the reduced COX activity could merely be due to partial loss of the mtDNA in these strains. Reduced COX enzyme activity, however, was also recently reported in atp6 mutants, where retention of the mtDNA had been ensured by growing the cells under appropriate selective pressure, thereby suggesting that loss of the ATP synthase complex and/or enzyme activity can negatively impact the COX complex in a direct manner (40Rak M. Tetaud E. Duvezin-Caubet S. Ezkurdia N. Bietenhader M. Rytka J. Rago di J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 34039-34047Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 41Rak M.

Furthermore, the F0 sector subunit Su g has also been reported to be required for maximal COX enzyme activity despite the fact that spectral analysis indicated that Δsu g mitochondria display a normal cytochrome content (42Boyle G.M. Roucou X. Nagley P. Devenish R.J. Prescott M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 262: 315-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). As Su g is not an essential subunit of the ATP synthase complex, this observation also suggests that the Su e/Su g proteins themselves, rather than the enzymatic activity of the ATP synthase complex, may directly impact the enzymatic activity of the COX complex. In this study, we have further pursued the relationship between the ATP synthase dimer-specific subunits, Su g and Su e, and the COX complex. We demonstrate here that the presence of both Su g and Su e are directly required for the establishment of maximal COX enzyme activity. Furthermore, in the absence of Su g and Su e, we observed an alteration in the assembly state of the cytochrome bc1 complex, whereby the stoichiometry of the cytochrome bc1-COX complex was altered, and free cytochrome bc1 complexes were observed. In addition, an increased level of cytochrome bc1-COX complexes associated with the TIM23 translocase of the inner membrane was also observed in the absence of Su g and/or Su e. Taken together our findings indicate that the absence of Su g and Su e not only affects the dimeric state of the ATP synthase but also causes an imbalance in the higher ordered organizational states of other OXPHOS supercomplexes and their association with the TIM23 machinery. Yeast Strains and Growth Conditions—S. cerevisiae strains used in this study are wild type (WT) (W303-1A, Mata, leu2, trp1, ura3, his3, ade2), Δsu g (W303-1A, ATP20::HIS3), Δsu e (W303-1A, TIM11::HIS3), Δcox4 (W303-1A, COX4::TRP1), Δcyt1 (W303-1A, CYT1::HIS3), Δimp1 (W303-1A, IMP1::HIS3), Δsdh2 (BY4739α, SDH2::KANr) and Δsdh4 (BY4739α, SDH4::KANr) (6Arnold I.

FEBS Lett. 1997; 411: 195-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Yeast strains were maintained and cultured using standard protocols at 30 °C on YP-Gly (YP, 0.5% lactate media supplemented with 3% glycerol) (WT, Δsu g, and Δsu e) or YP-Gal (YP, 0.5% lactate media supplemented with 2% galactose) (Δcox 4, Δcyt1, Δimp1, Δsdh2 and Δsdh4) as indicated. Rho0/rho– Cell Conversion Assay—Rho0/rho– assay was performed as described earlier (23Everard-Gigot V. Dunn C.D. Dolan B.M. Brunner S. Jensen R.E. Stuart R.A. Eukaryot. Cell. 2005; 4: 346-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Briefly, yeast strains were grown on YP-lactate medium supplemented with 3% glycerol or 2% galactose overnight at 30 °C. The following day, equal numbers of cells were plated from each strain onto YPD (2% glucose) plates or YP-Gly plates containing 0.1% galactose. Following incubation at 30 °C, the colonies were counted, and the number of rho0/– cells (i.e. petite cells) was calculated and expressed as a percentage of total cells. Clear Native-Gel Electrophoresis—CN-PAGE analysis of the F1F0-ATP synthase and cytochrome bc1-COX supercomplexes was performed essentially as described previously (23Everard-Gigot V. Dunn C.D.

Mitochondria (200 μg of protein) were solubilized in lysis buffer (34 mm potassium acetate, 34 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.4, 11.4% glycerol, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) with digitonin for 30 min on ice and then were subjected to a clarifying spin of 30,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant from each sample was analyzed on a 3.5–10% gradient gel, Western-blotted, and immunedecorated with subunit-specific antibodies as indicated. Two-dimensional Blue Native-SDS-PAGE—Mitochondria were solubilized with 0.5% digitonin and analyzed by blue native (BN)-gel electrophoresis as described previously (6Arnold I. Pfeiffer K. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. Schägger H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7170-7178Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). Following BN-PAGE, the individual gel strips were excised and equilibrated with denaturing solution (1% (w/v) SDS, 1% β-mercaptoethanol) for 30 min at room temperature. The excised gel strip was then inserted on top of an SDS-polyacrylamide gel, sealed with agarose solution (0.7% (w/v) agarose, 0.5% (w/v) SDS, and 15 mm β-mercaptoethanol), and electrophoresed in the second dimension. Followed by Western blotting, the nitrocellulose membrane was immunedecorated with subunit-specific antibodies as indicated. Gel Filtration Analysis—Isolated mitochondria (1 mg of protein) were solubilized in 1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.2, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride buffer. Following a clarifying spin, the detergent extract was applied to a Superose 6 FPLC gel filtration column (25-ml column volume). Fractions (0.3 ml) were collected, precipitated with trichloroacetic acid, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE, Western blotting, and immunedecoration with Cox2- and Cox4-specific antisera. Miscellaneous—Mitochondrial isolation, protein determinations, and SDS-PAGE were performed according to published methods (43Herrmann J.M. Fölsch H. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. Celis J.E.

Cytochrome c oxidase and cytochrome bc1 enzyme activities were performed on freshly isolated mitochondria, as described previously (8Cruciat C. Brunner S. Baumann F. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. J. Biol.

The Dimeric ATP Synthase Is Required for Maximal Cytochrome Oxidase Activity—A reduction in COX enzyme activity has been reported in yeast mutants deficient in Su g of the ATP synthase (42Boyle G.M. Roucou X. Nagley P. Devenish R.J. Prescott M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 262: 315-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). As yeast cells deficient in Su e and Su g are known to undergo a high frequency of spontaneous rho–/rho0 conversion (i.e. deletion and/or loss of mtDNA) when grown on fermentable carbon sources, the decrease in COX enzyme activity could simply have reflected the instability of the mtDNA in the Δsu g cells (23Everard-Gigot V.

Chem. 2005; 280: 24435-24442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Loss of mtDNA would result in a reduced coding capacity for the COX subunits, 1–3, the presence of which are essential for the enzyme activity of the COX complex. Growth of the Δsu e and Δsu g strains under nonfermentable carbon source (glycerol) conditions exerts a selective pressure on these strains to maintain the integrity of their mitochondrial genome, as demonstrated by the fact that ∼97% of the resulting Δsu e and Δsu g cells were determined to be rho+, i.e. contained functional mtDNA (Fig. 1A). On the other hand, overnight growth of these null mutant strains in a fermentable carbon source (galactose), as published previously (23Everard-Gigot V. Dunn C.D. Dolan B.M. Brunner S. Jensen R.E.

Kinins cleaved from kininogen are agonists of the B2R and must be processed by a carboxypeptidase to generate B1R agonists des-Arg9-bradykinin or des-Arg10-kallidin. Carboxypeptidase M (CPM) is a membrane protein potentially well suited for this function. Here we show that CPM expression is required to generate a B1R-dependent increase in [Ca2+]i in cells stimulated with B2R agonists kallidin or bradykinin. CPM and the B1R interact on the cell membrane, as shown by co-immunoprecipitation, cross-linking, and fluorescence resonance energy transfer analysis. CPM and B1R are also co-localized in lipid raft/caveolin-enriched membrane fractions, as determined by gradient centrifugation. Treatment of cells co-expressing CPM and B1R with methyl-β-cyclodextrin to disrupt lipid rafts reduced the B1R-dependent increase in [Ca2+]i in response to B2R agonists, whereas cholesterol treatment enhanced the response. A monoclonal antibody to the C-terminal β-sheet domain of CPM reduced the B1R response to B2R agonists without inhibiting CPM. Cells expressing a novel fusion protein containing CPM at the N terminus of the B1R also increased [Ca2+]i when stimulated with B2R agonists, but the response was not reduced by methyl-β-cyclodextrin or CPM antibody. A B1R- and CPM-dependent calcium signal in response to B2R agonist bradykinin was also found in endothelial cells that express both proteins. Thus, a close relationship of B1Rs and CPM on the membrane is required for efficiently generating B1R signals, which play important roles in inflammation.

CPM cleaves only C-terminal Arg or Lys residues, and some of its endogenous substrates include bradykinin, anaphylatoxins C3a, C4a, and C5a, Arg- or Lys-enkephalins, epidermal growth factor, and hemoglobin (2Skidgel R.A.

CPM preferentially cleaves C-terminal Arg as exemplified by the kinetics with Arg6-Met5-enkephalin (Km = 46 μm, kcat = 934 min-1) versus Lys6-Met5-enkephalin (Km = 375 μm, kcat = 663 min-1) (2Skidgel R.A. Davis R.M. Tan F. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2236-2241Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Bradykinin exhibits the lowest Km (16 μm) of any CPM substrate tested (2Skidgel R.A. Davis R.M. Tan F. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2236-2241Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a concentration that is still much higher than the typical physiological concentration of this peptide in the nanomolar range. However, peptidases in vivo typically work at substrate concentrations far below the Km as exemplified by angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE), which has the same relatively high Km (16 μm) with angiotensin I (14Jaspard E. Wei L. Alhenc-Gelas F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9496-9503Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a major physiological substrate. The development of ACE inhibitors as effective agents for treating hypertension and cardiovascular diseases was based in large part on the critical role of this enzyme in converting angiotensin I to II in vivo (15Erdös E.G. FASEB J. 2006; 20: 1034-1038Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The kinin peptides bradykinin and kallidin (Lys-bradykinin) are generated by the proteolytic action of plasma or tissue kallikrein on high or low molecular weight kininogen (16Erdös E.G. Cardiovasc. Res. 2002; 54: 485-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 17Bhoola K.D. Figueroa C.D. Worthy K. Pharmacol. Rev. 1992; 44: 1-80PubMed Google Scholar). Removal of the C-terminal Arg from bradykinin or kallidin inactivates these peptides as agonists of the constitutively expressed B2 receptor (B2R) (16Erdös E.G. Cardiovasc. Res. 2002; 54: 485-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 17Bhoola K.D. Figueroa C.D. Worthy K. Pharmacol. Rev. 1992; 44: 1-80PubMed Google Scholar). However, this conversion is a required processing step to generate des-Arg9-bradykinin or des-Arg10-kallidin (16Erdös E.G. Cardiovasc. Res. 2002; 54: 485-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 18Skidgel R.A. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1988; 9: 299-304Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar), metabolites that have a variety of biological activities mediated by specific activation of a different B1 receptor (B1R) whose expression is induced by inflammatory mediators (19Regoli D.

Rev. 2005; 57: 27-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (812) Google Scholar). Thus, CPM acts as a cell surface processing enzyme to generate des-Arg-kinin agonists for the B1R, and without this catalytic conversion, B1R signaling could not occur. This is of potential importance in inflammatory or pathological responses. For example, B1R activation stimulates extracellular signal-regulated kinase phosphorylation, prostaglandin production (20Leeb-Lundberg L.M. Marceau F. Muller-Esterl W. Pettibone D.J. Zuraw B.L. Pharmacol. Rev. 2005; 57: 27-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (812) Google Scholar), and inducible nitric-oxide synthase-mediated high output NO production (21Ignjatovic T. Stanisavljevic S. Brovkovych V.

In cytokine-treated human lung microvascular endothelial cells, we showed that nanomolar concentrations of B2 agonists kallidin or bradykinin generated a robust output of NO that could be inhibited by about 50% with either a B1R antagonist or carboxypeptidase inhibitor (22Sangsree S.

These results show that, at concentrations far below the Km, CPM can convert sufficient kinin peptide to B1R agonist to give a physiological response. One possible explanation of these findings is that the B1R and CPM are closely associated and that the orientation of CPM on the cell membrane allows efficient delivery of B1R agonist to the receptor. The x-ray crystal structure of CPM suggested a possible mechanism for favorable orientation of CPM on the membrane involving the unique C-terminal extension and positively charged residues in the C-terminal β sandwich domain that may interact with the phospholipid head groups (11Reverter D. Maskos K. Tan F. Skidgel R.A. Bode W. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 338: 257-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The present study was undertaken to explore the possible relationship between the B1R and agonist-generating enzyme CPM on the cell membrane. We show that CPM expression is required for generating B1R signals in response to B2 agonists. Furthermore, CPM and B1Rs are colocalized on the membrane and interact, as shown by immunoprecipitation, cross-linking, and fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) analysis. These data indicate that the close relationship of B1Rs and CPM on the membrane allows the efficient generation of B1R signals that play important roles in inflammatory processes.

Goat anti-mouse and anti-rabbit IgG-conjugated horseradish peroxidase were from Pierce. 5-Dimethylaminonaphthalene-1-sulfonyl-l-alanyl-l-arginine (dansyl-Ala-Arg) was synthesized and purified as described previously (25Tan F. Deddish P.A. Skidgel R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 248: 663-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Common chemicals were from Fisher. Cells—Human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cells were from the American Type Culture Collection, and bovine pulmonary artery endothelial cells were from Genlantis. Cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 mg/ml streptomycin, and 10% (HEK293 cells) or 15% (BPAEC) fetal bovine serum. Generation of Receptor and CPM Constructs—The cDNA for human kinin B1R was a kind gift from Dr. Fredrik Leeb-Lundberg (University of Lund, Sweden). The cDNA for human CPM was cloned in this laboratory as described (9Tan F. Chan S.J. Steiner D.F. Schilling J.W. Skidgel R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13165-13170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Tan F. Balsitis S. Black J.K. Blochl A. Mao J.F. Becker R.P. Schacht D. Skidgel R.A. Biochem. J. 2003; 370: 567-578Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Wild type (WT) B1R and CPM cDNAs were cloned into pcDNA3 or pcDNA6 (Invitrogen) for expression in mammalian cells. C-terminally tagged B1Rs were generated by amplifying B1R cDNA using PCR and then cloned into pEGFP-N1 (Clontech) for B1R-GFP or into pcDNA6-HisV5C (Invitrogen) for B1R-V5 expression, both at the NheI/BamHI restriction sites. B1R was also cloned into pIRES (Clontech) at the NheI/XhoI sites, together with enhanced green fluorescent protein at the SalI/NotI sites, to achieve the coexpression of B1R and GFP separately but at the same time in the same cells. Because of the lack of signal peptides on CFP or YFP, N-terminal tagging of the B1R using standard fluorescent protein vectors led to low or no membrane expression. 3F. Tan, R. A. Skidgel, unpublished results. To efficiently express N-terminal CFP- or YFP-tagged B1R or CPM, the signal peptide coding sequence of human ACE was inserted into the pECFP-C1 or pEYFP-C1 vectors (Clontech) upstream of and in the same reading frame as ECFP or EYFP (at the NheI/AgeI sites) to create pECFP-sig-C1 and pEYFP-sig-C1. The B1R cDNA was then cloned into pECFP-sig-C1 or pEYFP-sig-C1 downstream of the florescent protein at the XhoI/BamHI sites. For CPM, PCR-amplified cDNA lacking the native CPM signal peptide was cloned into pECFP-sig-C1 or pEYFP-sig-C1 at the XhoI/BamHI sites. To generate a fusion protein with CPM attached to the extracellular N terminus of the B1R (CPM-B1R), CPM cDNA (nucleotides 1-1390) was inserted in frame to the 5′ end of the B1R coding sequence and cloned into pcDNA3 or pcDNA6 at the BglII/XhoI sites. All of the PCR fragments used were amplified using high fidelity TaqDNA polymerase. Constructs were verified by DNA sequencing performed by the DNA Services Facility of the Research Resources Center, University of Illinois at Chicago. Transfection and Establishment of Stable Cell Lines—HEK293 cells, at 70-80% confluence in 6-well plates, were transfected with SuperFect (Invitrogen) reagent containing 5 μg of DNA according to the manufacturer's instructions. After 48 h of transfection, cells were transferred to selective medium containing G418 (500 μg/ml) or blasticidin (5 μg/ml) according to the resistance gene contained in the vector. The cells were cultured for 15-30 days in selective medium and then diluted for single clone selection. For B1R selection, the increase in [Ca2+]i stimulated by its ligand des-Arg10-kallidin was evaluated for each clone. For CPM selection, the enzyme activity was measured for each clone. The positive clones were used further to select CPM and B1R double stable cells. The expression of CPM or B1R was also confirmed using Western blotting. Measurement of Intracellular Ca2+—Increases in intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) were determined using fura-2/AM (21Ignjatovic T. Stanisavljevic S. Brovkovych V. Skidgel R.A. Erdös E.G. Mol. Pharmacol. 2004; 66: 1310-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). HEK293 cells stably expressing either B1R, CPM, or both were grown on polylysine-coated glass coverslips to 80% confluence and then loaded with 2 μm fura-2/AM for 60 min at 37 °C. Cells were washed and then stimulated with various concentrations of B1R or B2R agonists as indicated, and the fluorescence emission at 510 nm was monitored after excitation at 340 and 380 nm using a PTI Deltascan microspectrofluorometer. The area under the curve was integrated using Origin 7.0 software (OriginLab Corp.). Determination of CPM Activity—CPM activity was measured using dansyl-Ala-Arg substrate as described (25Tan F. Deddish P.A. Skidgel R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 248: 663-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 27Deddish P.A. Skidgel R.A. Erdös E.G. Biochem. J. 1989; 261: 289-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Briefly, live cells in 12- or 24-well plates were incubated in 200 μl of PBS containing 200 μm dansyl-Ala-Arg for 30-60 min at 37 °C. The medium was transferred to 10 × 75-mm glass tubes, and the reaction was stopped with 150 μl of 1.0 m citrate, pH 3.0, followed by extraction with 1.0 ml of chloroform. The fluorescence in the chloroform layer was measured at 495 nm (340 nm excitation) in a spectrofluorometer. The activity of CPM is expressed as fluorescent units/min/106 cells. Immunoprecipitation—The cells were lysed in 200 μl of 50 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.1% SDS (radioimmune precipitation buffer) containing 1% protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma) and then sonicated for 30 s on ice. The supernatants were collected by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C and diluted 10-fold with Tris buffer (50 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4). Antibody was added to the diluted samples, and after overnight incubation at 4 °C, protein A-coupled agarose beads (15 μl) were added and then further incubated for at least 8 h at 4 °C. After washing with Tris buffer three times, the beads were suspended in SDS-PAGE loading buffer (0.125 m Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 4% SDS, 20% glycerol, 0.1 m dithiothreitol, 0.01% bromphenol blue) and boiled for 5 min. After centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 5 min, supernatants were analyzed by Western blotting. Density Gradient Centrifugation—Detergent-free preparation of lipid rafts was done using OptiPrep density gradient centrifugation as described (28Macdonald J.L. Pike L.J. J. Lipid Res. 2005; 46: 1061-1067Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar) with slight modifications. Cells were scraped into PBS, and then centrifuged at 1000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. (In some experiments, cells were incubated with 5 nm [3H]des-Arg10-kallidin for 90 min on ice and then washed three times with PBS before lysing). The cell pellets were lysed with 1 ml of base buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 250 mm sucrose) containing 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, and 1% protease inhibitor mixture by passage through a 22-gauge needle 20 times and then centrifuged at 1000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. After centrifugation, the postnuclear supernatant was removed, the pellets were lysed and centrifuged again, and the two postnuclear supernatants were combined. An equal volume (2 ml) of base buffer containing 50% OptiPrep was mixed with the postnuclear supernatant and then layered on top with successive 1.6-ml fractions of base buffer containing 20, 15, 10, 5, and 0% OptiPrep. Gradients were centrifuged for 3 h at 52,000 × g in an SW-41 rotor, and then 0.7-ml fractions were collected (17 total). The fractions were assayed for CPM activity or bound [3H]des-Arg10-kallidin. Aliquots of gradient fractions were also mixed with 10× concentrated radioimmune precipitation buffer in a 9:1 ratio, sonicated for 15 s, and then used for Western blotting. Detergent Resistance Assay—HEK293 cells stably expressing CPM and B1R (without or with [3H]des-Arg10-kallidin preincubation as above) were incubated in the absence or presence of 10 mm M-β-CD for 30 min at 37 °C. Cells were scraped and transferred into 1.5-ml tubes, collected by centrifugation, and incubated with PBS containing various concentrations of Nonidet P-40 for 30 min on ice. Supernatants were collected after centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C and analyzed for CPM by activity assay and Western blotting or for B1R by counting [3H]des-Arg10-kallidin and Western blotting. The radioactivity and CPM activity were expressed as the ratio of that found in the supernatant from cells treated with M-β-CD to that of nontreated cells. Cross-linking of B1R and CPM—Cross-linking was carried out on whole cells using BS3 similar to procedures described previously (29Angers S. Salahpour A. Joly E. Hilairet S. Chelsky D. Dennis M. Bouvier M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3684-3689PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were scraped into PBS and centrifuged for 10 min at 1000 × g. The cell pellets were resuspended in PBS containing 2 mm BS3 and rotated for 2 h at 4 °C. After washing with PBS, cells were lysed in radioimmune precipitation buffer, sonicated for 30 s, and centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was used for immunoprecipitation as described above. Western Blotting—Cells were lysed in radioimmune precipitation buffer with sonication for 30 s on ice. After centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 10 min, the supernatant was collected and boiled with 2× concentrated loading buffer for 5 min. The protein samples were separated on an 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The blots were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in PBS with 0.5% Tween 20 (PBST) for 2 h at room temperature. The membranes were washed with PBST and incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C. Anti-rabbit or anti-mouse (Pierce) peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were added to the membranes at a dilution of 1:3000, and incubation was continued for 1.5 h at room temperature. The bands were visualized by chemiluminescence (Pierce). Confocal Microscopy and Measurement of FRET—Fluorescence imaging and FRET analysis were performed using an LSM 510 confocal microscope according to the protocol as previously described by Liu et al. (30Liu J. Ernst S.A. Gladycheva S.E. Lee Y.Y. Lentz S.I. Ho C.S. Li Q. Stuenkel E.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 55924-55936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Cells were grown on polylysine-coated glass coverslips and fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde. For fluorescence imaging, CFP and YFP excitation wavelengths were 458 and 514 nm, and emission fluorescence was measured at 485 ± 30 and 545 ± 30 nm, respectively. For FRET, selective photobleaching of YFP was performed by repeatedly scanning a region of the specimen with the 514 nm wavelength set at the maximum intensity to photobleach at least 85% of the original acceptor fluorescence. For determination of FRET efficiency in the selected bleach area, the average pixel intensity (I) of the CFP signal was determined from the unmixed pre- and postbleach images using Zeiss software. Relative FRET efficiency was calculated as (1 - (CFP Iprebleach/CFP Ipostbleach)) × 100%. Statistical Analysis—Data are expressed as means ± S.E. Statistical analysis was performed using Student's t test. Values of p < 0.05 were considered significant. B2R Agonists Only Induce a B1R-depedent Calcium Signal in Cells Co-expressing B1R and CPM—HEK293 cells stably expressing the WT B1R or WT CPM or both WT B1R and WT CPM were established. In cells stably expressing both WT B1R and WT CPM, B1R agonists des-Arg9-bradykinin and des-Arg10-kallidin stimulated a dose-dependent increase in intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) (Fig. 1, A and B). Interestingly, the B2R agonists bradykinin and kallidin also caused a dose-dependent increase in [Ca2+]i (Fig. 1, A and B), but the kinetics of responses were slower (Fig. 1A). In cells stably expressing only WT B1Rs, des-Arg9-bradykinin and des-Arg10-kallidin stimulated a robust increase in [Ca2+]i, but B2R agonists had little or no effect (Fig. 1C). These data indicate that the B1R response to B2R agonists in Fig. 1, A and B, was caused by conversion of the B2R agonist to B1R agonist by CPM. Similar results were obtained in cells stably co-expressing WT CPM, WT B1R, and GFP or cells stably co-expressing WT CPM and B1R tagged at the C terminus with V5 or GFP (B1R-V5 or B1R-GFP) (data not shown). HEK293 cells expressing only WT CPM (activity = 20 fluorescent units/min/106 cells) gave no response to B2R or B1R agonists, although they did respond to the positive control carbachol via activation of constitutively expressed muscarinic receptors (Fig. 1D). The activity and expression of CPM in naive HEK293 cells (not shown) or in cells expressing only WT B1Rs was at the lower limit of detection but was robust in cells co-expressing WT B1Rs and WT CPM (Fig. 1, E and F). The activity of CPM was blocked by the specific B-type carboxypeptidase inhibitor MGTA and partially inhibited by 10 μm bradykinin, which acts as a competitive substrate with dansyl-Ala-Arg in the assay (Fig. 1E). MGTA and bradykinin did not reduce the expression of WT CPM (Fig. 1F). Effect of Receptor Antagonists and CPM Activity on B1R Signaling Stimulated by B2R Agonist—In HEK293 cells stably expressing WT CPM and B1R-V5, both des-Arg10-kallidin (B1R agonist) and kallidin (B2R agonist) stimulated an increase in [Ca2+]i, and neither response was blocked by specific B2R antagonist HOE 140 (Fig. 2, A and B). In contrast, the specific B1R antagonist des-Arg-HOE 140 blocked the response to both B1R and B2R agonists (Fig. 2, A and B). The CPM inhibitor MGTA blocked the increase in [Ca2+]i stimulated by B2R agonist kallidin but did not affect activation of the B1R directly by des-Arg10-kallidin (Fig. 2, A and B). Similar results were obtained in cells coexpressing WT CPM and either WT B1R, B1R-GFP, or WT B1R and GFP (data not shown). To further explore the role of CPM activity in this response, we selected two clones that had similar responses to B1R agonist des-Arg10-kallidin (Fig. 2D) and similar expression of B1R-GFP (Fig. 2F) but had different activities and expression of WT CPM (Fig. 2, E and F). The clone with the highest CPM activity and expression gave the greatest increase in [Ca2+]i in response to B2R agonist, whereas the clone with lower activity gave a diminished response (Fig. 2C). In contrast, the increase in [Ca2+]i induced by B1R agonist des-Arg10-kallidin did not depend on CPM activity (Fig. 2D). Interestingly, B1R-GFP migrated on SDS-PAGE primarily as an oligomer, consistent with a previous report showing that homo-oligomerization of B1Rs is required for cell surface expression (31Kang D.S. Gustafsson C. Morgelin M. Leeb-Lundberg L.M.F. Mol. Pharmacol. 2005; 67: 309-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). To confirm that the high molecular weight form of the B1R was due to homo-oligomerization, a stable cell line co-expressing B1R-GFP and B1R-V5 was established. Immunoprecipitation with anti-GFP or anti-V5 antibody co-immunoprecipitated B1R-V5 or B1R-GFP respectively, as shown by Western blotting (Fig. 2G). Colocalization and Heterodimerization of CPM and B1Rs—Based on the kinetics determined for bradykinin hydrolysis by purified CPM in vitro (Km = 16 μm; kcat = 147 min-1) (2Skidgel R.A. Davis R.M. Tan F. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2236-2241Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it is unlikely that CPM would generate sufficient concentrations of des-Arg-kinin from 10 or 100 nm B2R agonist in the bulk extracellular fluid to give a response within 10-20 s, as shown in Fig. 1. However, it is possible that the des-Arg kinin generated on the cell surface by CPM is preferentially targeted to a B1R in close proximity or in a microdomain such that the concentration achieved is much higher than an equivalent amount of agonist distributed free in solution. This would require a close association between the B1R and CPM. To invest"
https://openalex.org/W1996314558,"V(D)J recombination is a process integral to lymphocyte development. However, this process is not always benign, since certain lymphoid malignancies exhibit recurrent chromosomal abnormalities, such as translocations and deletions, that harbor molecular signatures suggesting an origin from aberrant V(D)J recombination. Translocations involving LMO2, TAL1, Ttg-1, and Hox11, as well as a recurrent interstitial deletion at 1p32 involving SIL/SCL, are cited examples of illegitimate V(D)J recombination. Previous studies using extrachromosomal substrates reveal that cryptic recombination signal sequences (cRSSs) identified near the translocation breakpoint in these examples support V(D)J recombination with efficiencies ranging from about 30- to 20,000-fold less than bona fide V(D)J recombination signals. To understand the molecular basis for these large differences, we investigated the binding and cleavage of these cRSSs by the RAG1/2 proteins that initiate V(D)J recombination. We find that the RAG proteins comparably bind all cRSSs tested, albeit more poorly than a consensus RSS. We show that four cRSSs that support levels of V(D)J recombination above background levels in cell culture (LMO2, TAL1, Ttg-1, and SIL) are also cleaved by the RAG proteins in vitro with efficiencies ranging from 18 to 70% of a consensus RSS. Cleavage of LMO2 and Ttg-1 by the RAG proteins can also be detected in cell culture using ligation-mediated PCR. In contrast, Hox11 and SCL are nicked but not cleaved efficiently in vitro, and cleavage at other adventitious sites in plasmid substrates may also limit the ability to detect recombination activity at these cRSSs in cell culture.

The antigen binding domains of immunoglobulins and T cell receptors are encoded in germ line arrays of V, D, and J gene segments that are assembled into functional variable exons by V(D)J recombination during lymphocyte development (1Bassing C.H. Swat W. Alt F.W. Cell. 2002; 109: 45-55Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (669) Google Scholar).

V(D)J recombination can be conceptually divided into two phases, a cleavage phase and a joining phase (2Fugmann S.D. Lee A.I. Shockett P.E. Villey I.J. Schatz D.G. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 495-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). In the cleavage phase, the lymphoid cell-specific RAG1 and RAG2 (recombination activating gene-1 and -2, respectively) proteins assemble a multiprotein synaptic complex with two RSSs (generally one 12-RSS and one 23-RSS) and introduce a DNA double strand break at each RSS between the heptamer and adjacent coding segment via a nick-hairpin mechanism to yield a blunt 5′-phosphorylated signal end and a coding end terminating in a covalently sealed DNA hairpin structure. In the joining phase, the signal ends are generally joined precisely to form signal joints, and the coding ends are processed and joined to form coding joints that typically contain nucleotide additions or deletions at the junction. These processes are normally mediated by components of the nonhomologous end-joining DNA repair pathway. recombination signal sequence cryptic RSS electrophoretic mobility shift assay signal end break recombination information content morpholinepropanesulfonic acid ligation-mediated PCR wild type. recombination signal sequence cryptic RSS electrophoretic mobility shift assay signal end break recombination information content morpholinepropanesulfonic acid ligation-mediated PCR wild type.

This may occur by any of several mechanisms, including mistakenly binding and cleaving a DNA sequence that resembles an authentic RSS by a standard nick-hairpin mechanism, by targeting non-B form DNA structures and cleaving them through the introduction of staggered nicks (6Raghavan S.C. Swanson P.C. Wu X. Hsieh C.L. Lieber M.R. Nature. 2004; 428: 88-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar), by mobilizing signal ends or episomal signal joints generated after initial RSS cleavage and promoting their integration elsewhere in the genome (either by direct transposition, end donation, or trans-V(D)J recombination) (7Reddy Y.V.

The first type of mechanism is commonly suggested whenever an RSS-like motif (a cryptic RSS (cRSS)) is identified in the germ line sequence of a proto-oncogene near the chromosomal breakpoint, particularly if recombination involves an immunoglobulin or T cell receptor locus. In these cases, the location of the cRSS has generally been based on the position of a CAC motif (the first three residues of the consensus heptamer) nearest the recombination breakpoint that contains the highest number of additional residues that match the consensus heptamer and nonamer. However, since even authentic RSSs exhibit some degree of sequence variability in the heptamer and nonamer, and since mutations in the heptamer, nonamer, and spacer motifs have position-dependent and possibly synergistic effects on recombination efficiency (11Nadel B. Tang A. Lugo G. Love V. Escuro G. Feeney A.J. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 6068-6073PubMed Google Scholar), determining whether a given cRSS can support V(D)J recombination is problematic in the absence of functional testing. Therefore, several laboratories have applied a well established extrachromosomal V(D)J recombination assay to assess the functionality of various cRSSs in cell culture (12Marculescu R. Le T. Simon P.

Perhaps not surprisingly, the putative cRSSs studied to date exhibit a spectrum of activities in these assays, supporting V(D)J recombination at levels from ∼30-fold to over 20,000-fold less than a consensus RSS. The molecular basis for these differences remains unclear, because the binding and cleavage of these cRSSs by the RAG proteins has not been formally investigated. To address this issue, we have conducted extensive in vitro RAG cleavage and binding assays using cRSS substrates that have been characterized using extrachromosomal V(D)J recombination assays. We find that all intact oligonucleotide cRSS substrates tested show at least some level of RAG-mediated nicking at the 5′-end of the putative heptamer and some degree of RAG-mediated hairpin formation when the cRSS substrate is nicked. Interestingly, all intact cRSS substrates tested that support detectable levels of V(D)J recombination in cell culture support hairpin formation to levels ≥18% of a consensus 23-RSS in an in vitro cleavage assay. In contrast, cRSSs that fail to support detectable levels of V(D)J recombination in vivo show only ∼1% conversion to hairpins in the same assay. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays reveal that the RAG proteins bind all cRSSs tested more poorly than a consensus RSS, but there is little correlation between how well a given cRSS is cleaved by the RAG proteins and how well it is bound by them. We have also characterized RAG-mediated cleavage of plasmid V(D)J recombination substrates using ligation-mediated PCR (LM-PCR) to detect signal end breaks (SEBs) at a cRSS. SEBs were readily detected at cRSSs in vivo that support recombination efficiencies within ∼500-fold of a consensus RSS. LM-PCR can also detect SEBs generated at even less efficient cRSSs in vitro, but competition with adventitious cRSSs elsewhere in the plasmid backbone probably reduces recombination activity to undetectable levels. We also show that a recently identified gain-of-function RAG1 mutant cleaves these cRSSs with greater efficiency than wild-type RAG1, raising the possibility that mutations in RAG1 or other factors that regulate RAG-mediated synapsis and cleavage may promote illegitimate V(D)J recombination in vivo. The predictive value of these in vitro assays in assessing the in vivo recombination potential of a cRSS compared with in silico methods is discussed. Oligonucleotide and Plasmid Substrates—Oligonucleotides containing a consensus or cryptic RSS were synthesized and gel-purified using a commercial vendor (IDT Inc., Coralville, IA). Signal end oligonucleotides used to assemble nicked substrates included a 5′-phosphate introduced during chemical synthesis. Sequences for the substrates used in this study are shown in Table 1 (top strand only). To prepare intact or nicked duplex substrates, the top or bottom strand oligonucleotides were radiolabeled with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase, annealed to their unlabeled complementary strand(s), and the duplex was purified on a native polyacrylamide gel as described previously (25Bergeron S.

Open table in a new tab Protein Expression and Purification—Wild-type, catalytically inactive (D600A) or hyperactive (E649A) forms of core (residues 384–1040) RAG1 and core (residues 1–387) RAG2 were coexpressed in 293 cells as maltose-binding protein fusion proteins (cMR1 and cMR2, respectively) and purified as described previously (25Bergeron S. Anderson D.K. Swanson P.C. Methods Enzymol. 2006; 408: 511-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The yields of wild-type and mutant RAG proteins were all similar. In some experiments, preparations of core RAG1 and full-length RAG2 or full-length RAG1 and core RAG2 were used (cMR1/FLMR2 or FLMR1/cMR2, respectively) (26Swanson P.C. Volkmer D. Wang L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 4034-4044Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Full-length HMGB1 (high mobility group box 1) was expressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3)pLysS and purified using a combination of immobilized metal affinity chromatography and ion exchange chromatography as described previously (25Bergeron S. Anderson D.K. Swanson P.C. Methods Enzymol. 2006; 408: 511-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotide Cleavage and Binding Assays—RAG-mediated cleavage of oligonucleotide substrates was analyzed using an in vitro cleavage assay performed under permissive conditions containing Me2SO to promote RSS cleavage as described (25Bergeron S. Anderson D.K. Swanson P.C. Methods Enzymol. 2006; 408: 511-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Briefly, coexpressed wild-type or mutant RAG1/RAG2 proteins (100 ng) and HMGB1 (300 ng, where indicated) were incubated with substrate DNA (∼0.02 pmol) in a 10-μl reaction containing sample buffer (25 mm MOPS-KOH (pH 7.0), 60 mm potassium glutamate, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 20% Me2SO, and 1 mm MgCl2). In some experiments, reactions were further supplemented with cold partner RSS (0.1, 1, or 10 pmol, as indicated). Samples were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h, and the reaction products were visualized and quantified from dried sequencing gels using a Molecular Dynamics Storm 860 PhosphorImager running the ImageQuant software. Direct RAG binding to cRSS substrates was analyzed by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) using the same buffer conditions as those used in the in vitro cleavage assay, except that CaCl2 replaced MgCl2 in the binding reaction to avoid substrate cleavage (25Bergeron S. Anderson D.K. Swanson P.C. Methods Enzymol. 2006; 408: 511-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). For competition experiments shown in Fig. 1, binding reactions were supplemented with unlabeled intact consensus or cRSS substrate (0.1, 1, or 10 pmol, as indicated) before the addition of the RAG proteins. Cleavage of Plasmid Substrates in Vitro and in Vivo—RAG-mediated cleavage of plasmid V(D)J recombination substrates was analyzed using LM-PCR to detect signal end breaks at either the 12- or 23-RSS. For in vitro cleavage experiments, the various plasmid substrates in Table 1 (100 ng; linearized with AatII or BglII) were incubated with the cMR1/cMR2 and HMGB1 proteins under the same reaction conditions as used to assess cleavage of oligonucleotide substrates. The cleaved DNA was ligated to linker DNA assembled from oligonucleotides DR19 and DR20 as described previously (27Kriatchko A.N. Anderson D.K. Swanson P.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 4712-4728Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), and then the ligation reaction was terminated by incubation at 65 °C for 30 min. Signal ends generated at the 12-RSS or 23-RSS positions were detected from one-tenth of the ligation reaction by PCR using recombinant TaqDNA polymerase (Invitrogen) and primer DR20 and either 12P (5′-TATTGTCTCATGAGCGGATAC-3′) or 23P (5′-GGTACATTGAGCAACTGACTG-3′), respectively. Initial denaturation was performed at 94 °C for 2 min, followed by 25 cycles of amplification (94 °C for 15 s, 54 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s) and a final extension (72 °C for 10 min). LM-PCR products were fractionated on a 1.5% agarose gel and visualized by staining with ethidium bromide. For in vivo cleavage experiments, each 10-cm dish of 293 cells was cotransfected with one of the plasmid V(D)J recombination substrates listed in Table 1 (5 μg) and pcDNA1 expression constructs encoding WT, D600A, or E649A cMR1 (2.5 mg/dish) and WT cMR2 (2.5 mg) using 30 μg of polyethyleneimine as described previously (25Bergeron S. Anderson D.K. Swanson P.C. Methods Enzymol. 2006; 408: 511-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Cells were harvested 72 h post-transfection, and plasmid DNA was isolated from the cells using a QiaPrep Spin miniprep kit. SEBs at the 12- or 23-RSS were detected from 40 ng of recovered plasmid DNA using LM-PCR as described above. Characterization of cRSS Cleavage by the RAG1-RAG2 Complex—In previous studies (12Marculescu R. Le T. Simon P. Jaeger U. Nadel B. J. Exp. Med. 2002; 195: 85-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 14Raghavan S.C. Kirsch I.R. Lieber M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29126-29133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), the functionality of several cRSSs identified from lymphoid malignancies were tested using an extrachromosomal substrate assay (Table 1). Some cRSSs supported relatively robust recombination activity, whereas others did not. Because the V(D)J recombination assay measures the culmination of both the cleavage and joining phases of V(D)J recombination, we wondered whether those cRSSs that did not support efficient recombination may be cleaved by the RAG proteins but not efficiently joined. The most straightforward way to begin testing this possibility is to compare RAG-mediated cleavage of consensus and cryptic RSSs in a standard in vitro cleavage assay. Toward this end, we prepared radiolabeled intact or nicked oligonucleotide substrates containing a consensus 12- or 23-RSS or a cRSS (LMO2, TAL1, Ttg-1, Hox11, SIL, and SCL) (Table 1). The substrates were incubated with a purified truncated “core” wild-type (WT) or catalytically inactive (D600A) RAG1-RAG2 complex (RAGs) in reaction buffer containing Mg2+ and Me2SO for 1 h at 37°C. The addition of Me2SO enhances RAG cleavage activity, which is otherwise low in Mg2+, and models the stimulation afforded by synapsis ((25Bergeron S. Anderson D.K. Swanson P.C. Methods Enzymol. 2006; 408: 511-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) (supplemental Fig. 1A). Avoiding the need for adding partner RSS to promote synapsis simplifies the reaction scheme and is advantageous technically, because in most cases, the addition of a consensus partner RSS to reactions containing a labeled cRSS substrate reduces cRSS cleavage due to competitive inhibition of RAG binding (supplemental Fig. 1B; see below). Selected cleavage reactions were additionally supplemented with purified HMGB1, because this architectural DNA binding/bending protein is known to stimulate RAG binding and cleavage activity in vitro (particularly on 23-RSS substrates) and reduce aberrant nicking, even in the presence of Me2SO (25Bergeron S. Anderson D.K. Swanson P.C. Methods Enzymol. 2006; 408: 511-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Reaction products generated from RAG-mediated cleavage in vitro were analyzed after fractionation on sequencing gels. Based on previous studies (12Marculescu R. Le T. Simon P. Jaeger U. Nadel B. J. Exp. Med. 2002; 195: 85-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 14Raghavan S.C. Kirsch I.R. Lieber M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29126-29133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), the cRSSs examined here fall into three groups: those that function as a 12-RSS (LMO2), those that function as a 23-RSS (Ttg-1, TAL1, and SIL), and those for which functionality could not be unambiguously determined (Hox11 and SCL). As expected from previous studies (28Swanson P.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 7790-7801Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), no cleavage of intact RSS or cRSS substrates was observed by the D600A RAGs (Fig. 1, A–D). In contrast, WT RAGs convert most of the intact 12- and 23-RSS substrates into nicked and hairpin products; supplementing the cleavage reaction with HMGB1 slightly suppresses RAG-mediated cleavage and selectively diminishes aberrant nicking of the 23-RSS under these conditions. In the absence of HMGB1, all intact cRSSs tested are nicked by WT RAGs to some degree at the 5′-end of the putative heptamer. In some of the cRSSs (e.g. TAL1, Ttg-1, and Hox11), adventitious nicks are also introduced elsewhere in the substrate and accumulate with reaction kinetics similar to the appropriately sited nick (data not shown). Interestingly, hairpin products are observed in cleavage reactions containing LMO2, TAL1, SIL, and Ttg-1 substrates but are virtually undetectable in comparable reactions containing Hox11 and SCL substrates. The efficiency of hairpin formation using LMO2, TAL1, SIL, and Ttg-1 substrates compared with the 23-RSS ranges from 18 to 70% in the absence of HMGB1, whereas for Hox11 and SCL, these values are around 1% (Table 2). The addition of HMGB1 has variable effects on nicking and hairpin formation, depending on the substrate tested. In some cases (e.g. TAL1), aberrant nicking is reduced and hairpin formation is stimulated; in others (e.g. SIL), hairpin formation is suppressed. The molecular basis for these distinct outcomes remains unclear but, in the case of SIL, may be correlated with altered cRSS binding by the RAGs in the presence of HMGB1 (see below).TABLE 2Summary of cleavage and recombination data for consensus and cryptic RSSsIntact substrate (RAGs only)bPercentage conversion to total nicked (NT) and/or hairpin (HP) products for cRSSs relative to consensus 23-RSS calculated from at least three independent experiments.RSS or cRSS (functionality)HeptamerNonamerRelative recombination efficiencyRIC scoreaCalculated using the Recombination Signal Searching program available on the World Wide Web by the Duke University Laboratory of Computational Immunology using DNA sequence provided in Table 1.

To elucidate the function of TCERG1, we used short interfering RNA-mediated knockdown followed by en masse gene expression analysis to identify its cellular targets. Analysis of data from HEK293 and HeLa cells identified high confidence targets of TCERG1. We found that targets of TCERG1 were enriched in microRNA-binding sites, suggesting the possibility of post-transcriptional regulation. Consistently, reverse transcription-PCR analysis revealed that many of the changes observed upon TCERG1 knockdown were because of differences in alternative mRNA processing of the 3′-untranslated regions. Furthermore, a novel computational approach, which can identify alternatively processed events from conventional microarray data, showed that TCERG1 led to widespread alterations in mRNA processing. These findings provide the strongest support to date for a role of TCERG1 in mRNA processing and are consistent with proposals that TCERG1 couples transcription and processing.

TCERG1, which was previously known as co-activator of 150 kDa (CA150), was originally identified as a component of an active cellular fraction that supported Tat-activated transcription from the human immunodeficiency virus-long terminal repeat (1Sune C.

Subsequent cloning and characterization determined that TCERG1 is composed of multiple protein domains, most notable of which are three WW domains in the N-terminal half and six FF repeats in the C terminus (1Sune C.

Cote J. Shaaban S. Bedford M.T. Mol. Cell. 2007; 25: 71-83Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Overexpression studies demonstrate that TCERG1 can affect splicing of β-globin and β-tropomyosin minimal splicing reporters (7Lin K.T. Lu R.M. Tarn W.Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 9176-9185Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar).The processes of transcription and splicing are known to be coordinated by the CTD of RNAPII. In addition to binding TCERG1, the CTD is known to interact with factors involved in capping, splicing, and polyadenylation (12Kornblihtt A.R. de la Mata M. Fededa J.P. Munoz M.J. Nogues G. RNA (N.

The CTD is widely accepted as the critical site for the assembly of the machinery responsible for transcription-coupled mRNA processing, and it is required for the efficient splicing, polyadenylation, and termination of transcription in vivo (13Bird G.

The modular structure of TCERG1, with splicing factor-associating WW domains present in the N terminus and CTD-associating FF repeats in the C terminus, offers the ideal structure for a protein involved in coupling transcription and splicing. Consistent with this model, both halves of TCERG1 have been shown to be critical for the assembly of higher order transcription-splicing complexes (4Sanchez-Alvarez M. Goldstrohm A.C. Garcia-Blanco M.A. Sune C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 4998-5014Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar).

An important gap in our knowledge is the identity of TCERG1-responsive cellular genes. This study combines RNAi-mediated knockdown and microarray analysis to identify cellular targets of TCERG1. By utilizing data from two independent cell types, we have identified high confidence targets of TCERG1. Among these targets, we identified transcripts whose splicing decisions were dependent on TCERG1, and by utilizing a bioinformatics approach we provide evidence that TCERG1 impacts the processing of many cellular mRNAs.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPlasmids—pEF-BOST7 and pEF-BOST7-CA150 have been described previously (1Sune C.

HEK293T cells were transfected with pcDNA6-EGFP, and a pool of stable transfectants was selected with blasticidin to derive HEK293T-EGFP. HeLa-R19-LUC cells have been described previously (21Florez P.M. Sessions O.M. Wagner E.J. Gromeier M. Garcia-Blanco M.A. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 6172-6179Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). siRNA Transfection—HEK293T-EGFP cells were plated at 105 cells per well in a 6-well dish. 24 h after plating, siRNA duplexes EGFP (target-CUACAACAGCCACAACGUC), TCERG1-A, also known as C1 (target-GAGAUAAAGGAGGAGCCCA), TCERG1-B (target-GGAGUUGCACAAGAUAGUU), and TCERG1-C (target-GGAAGAUCCUCGAUGUAUU) were transfected at a final concentration of 10 nm using Oligofectamine (Invitrogen). HeLa-R19-LUC cells were subjected to siRNA-mediated knockdown using siRNAs, luciferase (target-CGUACGCGGAAUACUUCGA), and TCERG1-A, using a two-hit protocol as described previously (22Wagner E.J.

Hep3B cells were plated at 105 cells per well in a 6-well dish. 24 h after plating, siRNA duplexes siTCERG1 (CUCCAGAUGGGAAGGUUU) and siLUC (CUUACGCUGAGUACUUCGA) were transfected at 40 nm final concentration using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen).RNA Isolation and Microarray Hybridization—For knockdown experiments, total RNA was isolated from HEK293T-EGFP and HeLa-LUC cells using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen) and assessed for quality with an Agilent Lab-on-a-Chip 2100 Bio-analyzer. All probes for hybridization were then prepared according to standard Affymetrix protocols on the human U133A or human U133A_2 GeneChip arrays and scanned at a target intensity of 500 (Expression Analysis).Microarray Analysis—Genespring version 7.2 (Silicon Genetics) was used to generate the list of TCERG1-responsive targets defined in Table 1 and supplemental Tables 1 and 2. The data files were Robust Multichip Average (RMA), with GC-content background, normalized using Genespring version 7.2, and all probe sets were utilized in the analysis as described under “Results” and Table 1, Equation 1 and Equation 2. All fold change values reported in Table 2, and supplemental Tables 1-4 represent the different between the TCERG1(+)293 (n = 6) versus TCERG1(-)293 (n = 6) conditions. Average relative (percent) standard deviation among experimental replicates was calculated using RMA normalized (RMA Express) data including all 22,115 experimental probe sets as follows: Mock (n = 3), average S.D. = 10%, median = 8.7%; EGFP (n = 3), average S.D. = 8.7%, Median = 7.4%; TCERG1-B (n = 3), average S.D. = 8.2%, median = 7.2%; and TCERG1-C (n = 3), average S.D. = 7.1%, median = 6.3%.

GSEA-derived statistics were generated using 1000 permutations of gene tags.RT-PCR Analysis—2.4 μg of total RNA was digested with RQ1-DNase (Invitrogen) to remove any residual DNA contamination. 2.0 μg of DNase-treated total RNA was primed with oligo(dT) (Invitrogen) and reverse-transcribed using Moloney murine leukemia virus-RT (Invitrogen) at 37 °C for 1.5 h.

Cell. 1999; 4: 251-258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar).Bioinformatic Analysis of Gene Expression Data—A program, SplicerAV, was written in Perl to analyze standard RMA-normalized Affymetrix microarray data for evidence of alternative splicing. The inputs used to calculate the evidence of alternative processing, or Odds Score, used the log2 fold change and signal-to-noise ratios from each individual probe set derived from the expression data sets. The signal-to-noise ratio was calculated as the difference of the means of two data sets divided by the sum of their standard deviations. A gaussian mixture model was implemented to calculate the maximum likelihood that these probe set log fold changes (weighted by square root of the signal-to-noise ratio) for a given gene were generated by a single gaussian distribution or by two gaussian distributions. In this way the maximum likelihood of a single regulation event is compared with the maximum likelihood of two separate regulation events, in this case interpreted as changes in alternative processing. To avoid overfitting, gaussians were not allowed to have a standard deviation of less than a 0.4 log2 fold change, which is ∼28% change in expression levels. The maximum likelihood ratio of the data being described by 1 versus 2 gaussians is referred to as the Odds Score. This Odds Score can then be used to rank the genes in order of descending Odds Scores, creating a list of the most likely targets of alternative processing. All single probe set genes were excluded from analyses using this program. Other caveats include that a dead or inactive probe set within a gene with other functional probe sets would generate a high Odds Score, because it could appear that part of the gene is being up-regulated whereas the other is not. In addition, data sets with genome-wide stronger signals (i.e. higher probe set log fold change) will tend to generate higher Odds Scores. Others (25Fan W. Khalid N. Hallahan A.R. Olson J.M. Zhao L.P. Theor. Biol. Med. Model. 2006; 3: 19Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 26Hu G.K. Madore S.J. Moldover B. Jatkoe T. Balaban D. Thomas J. Wang Y. Genome Res. 2001; 11: 1237-1245Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) have previously used single probe set level data instead of multiple probe sets as a means of detecting alternative splicing; however, such algorithms may not have detected any of the alternative processing events presented in this paper, all of which spanned multiple probe sets. For a detailed discussion of probe set discrepancies in Affymetrix microarrays, see Stalteri and Harrison (43Stalteri M.A. Harrison A.P. BMC Bioinformatics. 2007; 8: 13Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). A list of top targets as predicted by the program is included as supplemental tables.Normalized Comparison of Mock Versus EGFP and Mock Versus TCERG1 Knockdowns B and C—To compare two lists of different probe set log fold change distributions, sub-distributions (subL) were first generated from each original distribution (L), which were matched for the maximum absolute value of each gene's log fold change. Starting with the highest maximum absolute value of the control master list (L), genes were alternately drawn from each original distribution, L (i.e. Mock versus EGFP and Mock versus TCERG1-B), and added to that sub-distribution, subL (i.e. subMock versus EGFP or subMock versus TCERG1-B), each time drawing the gene with the next lower absolute log fold change. In this way two subLs, one from each original distribution, were drawn that could be directly compared without confounding by differences in overall log fold change magnitudes.Statistical Analysis of Odds Scores—A Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test was performed on the top 100 genes to examine the probability that these genes came from the same distribution (two-sided KS test) or if one distribution was greater than another (one-sided KS test). This analysis was performed for the maximum absolute value corrected sub-distributions.Statistical and Experimental Validation of SplicerAV—The original RMA normalized microarray intensity values from the TCERG1(-)293 (n = 6) experimental condition were each compared with the average of the TCERG1(+)293 (n = 6) control condition to determine 6-fold change values for each probe set. The probe sets within a gene were then grouped using the groupings predicted by SPLICERAV (A or B in the output shown in supplemental Table 5). All normalized fold change values for each probe set within A or B were assembled into two new groups. A Welch's t test was performed on these two new groups to calculate the probability that the observed fold changes were the same. This probability was then corrected using the Bonferroni correction, given that N probe sets within a gene can be grouped a total of 2N-1 -1 possible ways. Low p values indicate that the two groups of probe sets as predicted by SPLICERAV do not behave the same. This could happen because of alternative processing, poor probe set annotation, or bad probe sets. RT-PCR validation was performed under semi-quantitative conditions using radionucleotide incorporation. Products were resolved by 6% PAGE. Quantification was performed by exposure to phosphorimaging screen and analyzed by ImageQuant (GE Healthcare). PCR primer sequences will be made available upon request.RESULTSIdentification of TCERG1 Targets in HEK293T Cells—We set out to identify cellular targets of TCERG1 using a combination of siRNA-mediated knockdown and en masse gene expression analysis. To this end, HEK293T cells stably expressing EGFP were used for siRNA-mediated knockdown of TCERG1, allowing the heterologously expressed EGFP to be targeted by siRNA as a negative control. Mock-transfected cells were an additional negative control and were considered as base-line expression. Three independent siRNA duplexes specific for TCERG1 were transfected at a final concentration of 10 nm, and all significantly lowered TCERG1 levels, with TCERG1-B and TCERG1-C giving the best knockdown. In Mock-treated cells and in those transfected with EGFP siRNA, TCERG1 levels did not change (Fig. 1A, left panel). The EGFP siRNA was fully functional as demonstrated by fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis, which confirmed reduced EGFP levels after 72 h (Fig. 1A, right panel). This experiment was repeated three times with similar results. Total RNA from the controls, Mock and siEGFP, and the two siRNAs with the best knockdown, TCERG1-B and -C, were used for subsequent global mRNA quantification. We chose the 72-h time point, because TCERG1 levels had been significantly depleted for at least 24 h.Total RNA was prepared from Mock-, siEGFP-, siTCERG1- B-, or siTCERG1-C-treated HEK293T cells from three independent experiments. These 12 RNA samples were interrogated on Affymetrix HU-133A_2 GeneChip arrays. Genespring version 7.2 (Silicon Genetics) software was used for analysis, and data were normalized using the GC-RMA method (27Cope L.M. Irizarry R.A. Jaffee H.A. Wu Z. Speed T.P. Bioinformatics (Oxf.). 2004; 20: 323-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). The data for identical conditions, Mock (n = 3), EGFP (n = 3), TCERG1-B (n = 3), and TCERG1-C (n = 3), were averaged among the replicates (experimental variation among replicates, reported as relative standard deviation, is presented under “Experimental Procedures”).The analysis was carried out separately to derive the Down gene set (genes whose level decreased upon TCERG1 knockdown) and the Up gene set (genes whose level increased upon TCERG1 knockdown). To derive the Down gene set, we compared the Mock and EGFP conditions and excluded from the analysis any genes that decreased 1.2-fold or greater in the EGFP condition (Table 1, see Footnote a). From the remaining genes, potential targets were identified as those genes that decreased 1.2-fold or greater when condition Mock was compared with both condition TCERG1-B and condition TCERG1-C. To derive the Up gene set, we utilized the same process, varying only in the direction of the change (Table 1, see Footnote b). These criteria were set to cast a wide net based more on reproducibility and less on fold change. It should be noted that the 1.7-fold reduction in TCERG1 transcript, as reflected in the microarrays, resulted in an average 2.75 ± 0.75-fold reduction in protein levels as determined by semi-quantitative Western blot of the three experiments (data not shown). A more stringent criteria were used to identify probe sets that increased or decreased ≥1.5-fold, and all of the examples described below (see Fig. 3) fell into this more stringent list of targets.FIGURE 3TCERG1 affects alternative mRNA processing. cDNA generated by oligo(dT)-primed reverse transcription of total RNA from Mock, EGFP, TCERG1-B, or TCERG1-C samples from HEK293T-EGFP experiments (Exp) 1-3 was PCR-amplified using gene-specific primers. RBM3 was amplified from exon 5 to exon 7. CTTN message, “CTTN-retained intron,” was amplified using a forward primer in exon 2 and a reverse primer in intron 4. CTTN was amplified using the same exon 2 primer and a reverse primer in exon 4. BUB3 was amplified using a forward primer in exon 7 and a reverse primer in exon 8, which resulted in two products that differ in exon 8 3′ splice site (ss) choice. β-Actin was amplified as a control.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Utilizing two independent TCERG1-specific siRNA duplexes, and defining targets as those genes that change commonly between them, allowed us to minimize false positives because of siRNA-specific off target effects. The EGFP knockdown served as an additional filter to remove genes that change merely as a result of an activated siRNA response.The analysis described above and summarized in Table 1 resulted in the identification of 554 probe sets, representing 487 unique genes, that decreased and 485 probe sets, representing 432 unique genes, that increased upon TCERG1 depletion (supplemental Tables 1 and 2).Utilizing TCERG1 Knockdown in HeLa Cells as Validation of Cellular Targets of TCERG1—In our quest to identify genuine targets of TCERG1, we performed TCERG1 knockdown experiment utilizing HeLa cells stably expressing firefly luciferase, HeLa-Luc, which have a different origin than HEK293T cells. In addition to changing cell lines, the experiments in HeLa cells utilized the TCERG1 siRNA duplex, TCERG1-A, which was not used in the HEK293T analysis (Fig. 1B). We reasoned that targets identified in both HEK293T and HeLa cells using different siRNAs could be considered bona fide TCERG1 targets.To identify TCERG1 targets shared by HEK293T and HeLa cells, we used Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) (23Subramanian A. Tamayo P. Mootha V.K. Mukherjee S. Ebert B.L. Gillette M.A. Paulovich A. Pomeroy S.L. Golub T.R. Lander E.S. Mesirov J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Genet. 2003; 34: 267-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (5854) Google Scholar). GSEA is useful when comparing a defined gene set to the rank order of another microarray experiment. The utility of GSEA hinges on the ability to quantify and visualize the distribution of the defined gene set within the data of another microarray comparison. By relying on the distribution, GSEA dispenses with the issues of varying fold change between cell types. Specifically, the objective of the software is to determine whether genes in a set S occur more frequently at the top or bottom of a list L. The program provides an enrichment score based on a weighted Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic (23Subramanian A. Tamayo P. Mootha V.K. Mukherjee S. Ebert B.L. Gillette M.A. Paulovich A. Pomeroy S.L. Golub T.R. Lander E.S. Mesirov J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 15545-15550Crossref PubMed Scopus (25053) Google Scholar) and also defines the leading edge subset of S, which is interpreted as the core subset of S responsible for the enrichment score. In our case, set S was either the Up-gene set (SUp) or the Down-gene set (SDn) in HEK293T cells following TCERG1 knockdown (Table 1), and the rank order list L would be a continuous ranking of all probe sets correlated to the level of TCERG1 in HeLa cells. Before performing this comparison between cell lines, we decided to carry out a test of internal consistency by analyzing the HEK293T data using GSEA parameters. As required by the method we created the following two conditions: TCERG1(+)293 (n = 6) was derived from the control conditions, Mock (n = 3) and EGFP (n = 3), and TCERG1(-)293 (n = 6) was derived from the knockdown conditions TCERG1-B (n = 3) and TCERG1-C (n = 3). These two conditions were used to construct the rank order list, L293 = TCERG1(+)293 versus TCERG1(-)293. As expected the SUp was enriched in condition TCERG1(-)293 (Fig. 2A, left panel), and the SDn was enriched in condition TCERG1(+)293 (right panel). This exercise ga"

The activation of MR modulates the expression of various proteins like the epithelial sodium channel, Na+-K+-ATPase, the SGK kinase, and the EGF receptor (1Arriza J.L. Weinberger C. Cerelli G.

There is increasing evidence that not all biological effects of MR are mediated by direct DNA binding and control of target gene expression (8Funder J.W. Endocr.

Some actions of MR appear to be the result of a cross-talk with other signaling cascades, such as nongenomic regulation of intracellular calcium (10Doolan C.M. Harvey B.J. J. Biol.

Some nongenomic effects arise from classical receptors in or at the plasma membrane (e.g. ER, Ref. 13Levin E.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 2003; 17: 309-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar) but specialized membrane receptors, like mPR and GPR30 have also been described (27Filardo E.J. Quinn J.A. Frackelton A.R.

The mechanism(s) of action for ER and PR as well as the receptor domains involved have been explored in more detail. Receptor domains D, E, and F seem to be of special importance (19Boonyaratanakornkit V. Scott M.P. Ribon V. Sherman L. Anderson S.M. Maller J.L. Miller W.T. Edwards D.P. Mol.

For example, ERα interacts with the SH2 domain of cSRC via a phosphorylated tyrosine residue at position 537 in the EF domain, and this interaction is facilitated by MNAR (26Barletta F. Wong C.W.

Ghonshani S. Webb P. Levin E.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 1633-1646Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar) described an important role for serine 522 within the EF domain of ERα during nongenomic signaling. However, there are also reports ascribing a role to domain D (33Chambliss K.L. Simon L. Yuhanna I.S. Mineo C. Shaul P.W. Mol. Endocrinol. 2005; 19: 277-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Recently, the direct interaction of ERα with Gαi through domain C and Gβγ through DEF domains has been reported (34Kumar P. Wu Q. Chambliss K.L. Yuhanna I.S. Mumby S.M. Mineo C. Tall G.G. Shaul P.W. Mol. Endocrinol. 2007; 21: 1370-1380Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). PR has the ability to interact with the SH3 domain of cSRC via a proline-rich region of domain D (19Boonyaratanakornkit V. Scott M.P. Ribon V. Sherman L. Anderson S.M. Maller J.L. Miller W.T.

Pharmacological evidence for a physiologically relevant role of the MR in nongenomic actions was presented, for example, with respect to the modulation of the plasma membrane Na+-transporters (35Alzamora R. Michea L. Marusic E.T. Hypertension. 2000; 35: 1099-1104Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) or vascular reactivity and NO synthesis (36Liu S.L. Schmuck S. Chorazcyzewski J.Z. Gros R.

Recently, the involvement of MR in nongenomic signaling at the cellular level was investigated in detail using a heterologous expression system (9Grossmann C. Benesic A. Krug A.W. Freudinger R. Mildenberger S. Gassner B. Gekle M. Mol. Endocrinol. 2005; 19: 1697-1710Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The data from this study showed that MR contributes to rapid aldosterone-induced activation of the ERK1/2 pathway via cSRC and EGFR activation. For MR, no information regarding the domain(s) necessary for nongenomic actions are available. In the present study, we determined which MR domains are required for nongenomic signaling and whether this pathway has the potential to elicit a pathophysiological effect in cultured cells under defined conditions.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture—Cell culture was performed as described previously (6Krug A.W.

We used CHO-K1, HEK-293, and OK cells from ATCC. 24-48 h prior to the experiment, serum was removed. For the experiments presented, the cells were cultivated either on Petri dishes (Becton Dickinson GmbH, Heidelberg, Germany) in 24-well plates (for reporter assay and collagen determination), in 96-well plates (for ELISA), or on glass coverslips (fluorescence).Constructs and Transfection—Transfection of the cells was performed under serum-free conditions as described before (6Krug A.W.

We used the hMR expression vector pEGFP-C1-hMR (kindly provided by Dr. N. Farman (57Ouvrard-Pascaud A. Puttini S. Sainte-Marie Y. Athman R. Fontaine V. Cluzeaud F. Farman N. Rafestin-Oblin M.E.

Truncated versions of the pEGFP-hMR, which lack either the N-terminal AB domain (hMRCDEF), the AB domain and the DNA-binding domain (hMRDEF), or additionally the hinge region (hMREF) were constructed by cutting pEGFP-hMR with BglII and Hin-dIII and inserting appropriate PCR fragments (Table 1). hMRAB was generated by restriction with EcoR1. To determine whether the EGFP tag changed the characteristics of the receptor, we compared its GRE activation and nuclear translocation properties with that of the untagged hMR and could not find significant differences (9Grossmann C.

Lysates were then centrifuged at 11,000 rpm at 4 °C for 10 min, and the supernatant was incubated overnight with EGFP antibody (sc-8334, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) with end-over-end rotation and then with A/G plus-agarose for another 24 h. After 10 min of centrifugation at 10,000 rpm at 4 °C, the pellet was mixed with 40 μl of Laemmli buffer and separated by an 8% SDS-PAGE gel.Western Blot Analysis—Cells were lysed in ice-cold Triton X-100 lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 200 μm sodium orthovanadate, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μm pepstatin A, 40 mg/liter bestatin, 2 mg/liter aprotinin, 1% Triton X-100), lysis buffer according to Le Moellic et al. (59Moellic Le C. Ouvrard-Pascaud A. Capurro C. Cluzeaud F. Fay M. Jaisser F. Farman N. Blot-Chabaud M. J. Amer. Soc. Nephrol. 2004; 15: 1145-1160PubMed Google Scholar) (50 mmol/liter Tris-HCl, 150 mmol/liter NaCl, 1% Nonidet P40, 2.4 mmol/liter EDTA, protease inhibitor mixture) or radioimmune precipitation assay buffer at 4 °C. Cell lysates were matched for protein content, separated by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. Subsequently membranes were blotted with either rabbit anti-phospho-ERK1/2 antibody (1:1000, Cell Signaling Technologies), rabbit anti-ERK1/2 antibody (1:1000, Cell Signaling Technologies), mouse anti-EGFP (1:1000, Clontech), rabbit anti-HSP90 (1:1000, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), rabbit anti-collagen III (1:1000; Biotrend, Köln, Germany), or rabbit anti-pcSRC (Tyr-416, 1:1000, Cell Signaling Technologies). The bound primary antibody was visualized using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary IgG and the ECL system (Amersham Biosciences). Densitometry analysis was performed with ImageJ.EGFP Fluorescence—Cells were cultivated on glass coverslips. Images were obtained either using an inverted microscope (Zeiss IM 135) equipped with ×40 and ×100 fluorescence objectives. Fluorescence images were taken with an ICCD camera (Hamamatsu, Herrsching, Germany). Alternatively, cells were analyzed by confocal microscopy (Radiance 2000, Bio-Rad), and the images were processed using the software MetaMorph Imaging System (Microsoft).Determination of EGFP-hMR Expression by ELISA—EGFP-hMR expression was determined basically by the same method as ERK1/2 phosphorylation (see above). HEK cells were transfected, made quiescent, and after 48 h, expression was determined with an anti-EGFP primary antibody (Clontech) and anti-mouse-horseradish peroxidase antibody. pcDNA3.1-transfected cells were used as negative controls.Quantification of ERK1/2 Phosphorylation by ELISA—For the quantification of ERK1/2 phosphorylation, we performed ELISA according to Versteeg et al. (58Versteeg H.H. Nijhuis E. den Brink Van G.R. Evertzen M. Pynaert G.N. Deventer van S.J. Coffer P.J. Peppelenbosch M.P. Biochem. J. 2000; 350: 717-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) with minor modifications that were described previously (55Krug A.W. Schuster C. Gassner B. Freudinger R. Mildenberger S. Troppmair J. Gekle M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45892-45897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). After stimulation as indicated, the cells were fixed with 4% formaldehyde in PBS and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100. Cells were blocked with 10% fetal calf serum in PBS/Triton for 1 h and incubated overnight with the primary antibody. Subsequently, cells were incubated with secondary antibody (peroxidase-conjugated mouse anti-rabbit antibody) in PBS/Triton with 5% bovine serum albumin for 1 h at room temperature. Finally, the cells were incubated with 50 μl of a solution containing 0.4 mg/ml o-phenylenediamine, 11.8 mg/ml Na2HPO4, 7.3 mg/ml citric acid, and 0.015% H2O2 for 15 min at room temperature in the dark. The resulting signal was detected at 490 nm with a multiwell multilabel counter (Victor2, Wallac, Turku, Finland). The protein content was determined with Trypan Blue (55Krug A.W. Schuster C.

The determination of total ERK1/2 in parallel experiments was used to correlate phosphorylated ERK1/2 to total ERK1/2.Quantification of Phospho-ERK1/2 by Sandwich-ELISA—For the quantification of phospho-ERK expression, we used the sandwich-ELISA from R&D Systems, Inc., Minneapolis R&D (SUV1018) according to the manufacturer's instructions.Determination of Extracellular Collagen III Abundance by ELISA—Collagen III abundance in the medium of CHO cells expressing HER1 (55Krug A.W.

Pflugers Arch. 2007; 454: 403-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). We tested the cross-reactivity of the primary antibodies (1:1000; Biotrend, Köln, Germany) using collagen standards and did not observe any significant cross-reactivity.Determination of Gelatinase Activity—Gelatinase activity in cell culture media was determined by the ENZ® Gelatinase/Collagenase Assay kit from Molecular Probes (Leiden, NL) using fluorescein-conjugated gelatin. The increase in fluorescence is a direct measure for gelatinase/collagenase activity. As a positive control, bacterial collagenase activity (Sigma) was measured, and the gelatinase values are expressed as collagenase-equivalents.GRE Reporter Gene Assay—Transactivation was assessed by the Mercury™ Pathway Profiling reporter gene assay system from Clontech Inc. using secretory alkaline phosphatase (SEAP) as reporter, essentially as described earlier (9Grossmann C. Benesic A. Krug A.W. Freudinger R. Mildenberger S. Gassner B. Gekle M. Mol. Endocrinol. 2005; 19: 1697-1710Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). In brief, the cells were cotransfected with pGRE-SEAP and receptor constructs or empty vectors. SEAP activity in the media was determined with the AttoPhos® System from Promega (Mannheim, Germany) and normalized to a transfection control (β-galactosidase or EGFP).Materials—U0126, tyrphostin AG 1478, PP2, and the protease inhibitors were obtained from Calbiochem (Bad Soden, Germany). Unless otherwise stated, all other materials were from Sigma. Control Ringer solution was composed of (mmol/liter): NaCl 130.0, KCl 5.4, CaCl2 1.0, MgCl2 1.0, NaH2PO4 1.0, HEPES 10, and glucose 5 (pH 7.4 at 37 °C), plus the respective vehicles (ethanol or Me2SO ≤ 1‰).Statistics—The data are presented as mean values ± S.E. Significance of difference was tested by paired or unpaired Student's t test or analysis of variance as applicable. Differences were considered significant with p < 0.05. Cells from at least two different passages were used for each experimental series. N represents the number of tissue culture dishes investigated.RESULTSTranscriptional Activity of hMR Deletion Constructs—We compared transcriptional activity of the MR deletion constructs using a GRE-SEAP reporter containing three canonical GRE elements. Only cells transfected with hMR or hMRCDEF responded to aldosterone with increased GRE-SEAP activity (Fig. 1). Dexamethasone, a ligand for the endogenous glucocorticoid receptor (GR, Ref. 18Pfau A. Grossmann C. Freudinger R. Mildenberger S. Benesic A. Gekle M. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2007; 264: 35-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) stimulated GRE-SEAP activity under all conditions, demonstrating the functionality of the experimental system. For cells transfected with hMR or hMRCDEF, the effect of dexamethasone was stronger, because of the additional activation of the mineralocorticoid receptor. The relative transactivation potency of hMRCDEF was greater when compared with hMR, because the inhibitory domain located in AB is missing (45Rupprecht R. Arriza J.L. Spengler D. Reul J.M. Evans R.M. Holsboer F. Damm K. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 597-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Half-maximal activation was obtained with similar concentrations of aldosterone (Fig. 1).Expression of hMR Deletion Constructs—Western blot analysis confirmed the expression of proteins of the expected size (Fig. 2A). The expression level of hMR was slightly lower compared with deletion constructs when determined by ELISA (Fig. 2B). The simplest explanation for this difference is the size of the protein. However, differences in the delivery to degradation sites cannot be excluded.FIGURE 2Expression of the different MR constructs. A, Western blot. B, quantitative expression analysis by ELISA (n = 12).

As expected, hMR is located mainly in the cytosol in the absence of hormone (Fig. 2C). In the presence of aldosterone (10 nmol/liter), the receptor translocates almost completely to the nucleus. hMRCDEF behaves in a similar way. hMRDEF and hMREF, which are located in the cytosol in the absence of hormone, translocate partially into the nucleus after the addition of aldosterone.ERK1/2 Phosphorylation in Cells Transfected with hMR Deletion Constructs—We used ERK1/2 phosphorylation as a read-out for rapid, nongenomic effects, because it has been described continuously in different experimental systems. First, we investigated whether expression of the different hMR deletion constructs affects ERK1/2 phosphorylation in the absence of aldosterone. For this purpose, ERK phosphorylation was determined by two independent techniques, i.e. sandwich-ELISA and Western blot. Fig. 3 shows that expression of hMREF led to a ligand-independent increase in ERK1/2 phosphorylation. The expression levels of total ERK1/2 or HSP90 were not altered significantly (Fig. 3). This difference was not observed in the presence of 10 μmol/liter U0126 (inhibitor of ERK1/2 phosphorylation; Fig. 3A). Similar results were obtained with a different cell line, OK cells, where hMREF also enhanced the basal pERK1/2 level (145 ± 9% of control, n = 18, p < 0.05).FIGURE 3A, upper panel, Western blot analysis of pERK1/2, ERK1/2, and HSP90 expression levels 48 h after transfection in the absence of aldosterone.

Surface polyFn is critical for pulmonary metastasis, presumably by facilitating lung vascular arrest via endothelial dipeptidylpeptidase IV (CD26). Here, we show that cell-surface polyFn assembly is initiated by the state of suspension, is dependent upon the synthesis and secretion of cellular Fn, and is augmented in a dose- and time-dependent manner by plasma Fn. PolyFn assembly is regulated by protein kinase Cϵ (PKCϵ), which translocates rapidly and in increasing amounts from the cytosol to the plasma membrane and is phosphorylated. PolyFn assembly is impeded by select inhibitors of this kinase, i.e. bisindolylmaleimide I, Ro-32-0432, Gö6983, and Rottlerin, by the phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-mediated and time-dependent loss of PKCϵ protein and decreased plasma membrane translocation, and more specifically, by stable transfection of lung-metastatic MTF7L breast cancer cells with small interfering RNA-PKCϵ and dominant-negative PKCϵ constructs (e.g. RD-PKCϵ). The inability to assemble a cell surface-associated polyFn coat by knockdown of endogenous Fn or PKCϵ impedes cancer cells from metastasis to the lungs. The present studies identify a novel regulatory mechanism for polyFn assembly on blood-borne breast cancer cells and depict its effect on pulmonary metastasis.

This pro-metastatic role of Fn is multifaceted, affecting several steps of the metastatic cascade by modulating cell adhesion, motility/invasion, cell cycle progression, and cell survival (for review, see Refs. 12Hynes R.O.

By analyzing cancer cells that had entered the blood circulation from malignant breast cancers implanted into the mammary fat pad of rats or mice, we discovered that blood-borne tumor cells were decorated with a unique, multiglobular coat of polymeric Fn (polyFn) (9Cheng H.C.

Chem. 2003; 278: 24600-24607Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). PolyFn aggregates appeared to arise from focal accumulations of endogenous, cell surface-immobilized (“linearized”) Fn, which served as scaffolds for further Fn-self-assembly from Fn recruited from blood plasma (pFn) (9Cheng H.C. Abdel-Ghany M. Elble R.C. Pauli B.U. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24207-24215Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Aggregates typically became increasingly deoxycholate-insoluble as they increased in size with time of incubation of suspended cancer cells in serum-containing medium in vitro. Biochemically, aggregates impressed as prominent, insoluble (covalently bonded) Fn polymers sitting on top of the stacks of SDS-polyacrylamide gels and, immunocytochemically, as large globules randomly dispersed over the entire cancer cell surface (9Cheng H.C. Abdel-Ghany M. Elble R.C. Pauli B.U. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24207-24215Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). This “cluster arrangement” of polyFn was shown to have the following functional implications. First, the conversion of Fn from the globular state of soluble Fn to the linearized state of insoluble, surface-associated Fn aggregates is associated with exposure of a novel, cryptic binding domain for the lung endothelial cell address in dipeptidylpeptidase IV (DPP IV) (9Cheng H.C.

Metastasis. 1999; 17: 609-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). This DPP IV binding domain is present as a consensus motif in each of the 13th, 14th, and 15th type III repeats of Fn (17Cheng H.C. Abdel-Ghany M. Pauli B.U. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 24600-24607Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Second, the DPP IV binding specificity for linearized (polymeric), but not for globular (soluble) pFn, allows tumor cell adhesion to endothelial DPP IV in the presence of high pFn concentrations (9Cheng H.C. Abdel-Ghany M. Elble R.C. Pauli B.U. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24207-24215Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Third, the large Fn aggregates on cancer cell surfaces allow multiple binding interactions with endothelial DPP IV molecules, thereby generating adhesion strengths between cancer cells and endothelial cells that are able to withstand the rigors of hemodynamic shear stresses (9Cheng H.C. Abdel-Ghany M. Elble R.C. Pauli B.U. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24207-24215Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The importance of the Fn/DPP IV-docking mechanism is substantiated by our discovery that synthetic peptides directed against the DPP IV binding domain in the 13th, 14th, or 15th type III repeats of Fn as well as a polypeptide encompassing the bulk of the extracellular domain of DPP IV dramatically impeded pulmonary metastasis in a rat breast cancer model (19Johnson R.C. Zhu D. Augustin-Voss H.G. Pauli B.U. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 1423-1432Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 20Abdel-Ghany M. Cheng H. Levine R.A. Pauli B.U. Invasion Metastasis. 1998; 18: 35-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). These data are consistent with our finding that colonization of the lungs was greatly diminished in Fischer 344/CRJ rats, in which DPP IV is mutated causing a significantly decreased DPP IV protein expression in pulmonary endothelia (21Cheng H.C. Abdel-Ghany M. Zhang S. Pauli B.U. Clin. Exp. Metastasis. 1999; 17: 609-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) as well as in DPP IV-/- mice (19Johnson R.C. Zhu D. Augustin-Voss H.G. Pauli B.U. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 1423-1432Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). DPP IV-/- mice injected with lung-metastatic cancer cells lived significantly longer than their wild-type counterparts, an outcome granted by the formation of significantly fewer and smaller lung colonies. 3H. C. Cheng, unpublished data. 3H. C. Cheng, unpublished data.Although we have firmly established a critical dependence between the ability of the cancer cells to assemble an insoluble, globular polyFn-surface coat and lung colonization in an experimental metastasis model (9Cheng H.C.

Chem. 2003; 278: 24600-24607Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), we still do not know whether blood-borne cancer cells use their own cellular Fn (cFn) or rely on ubiquitous pFn to assemble their polyFn surface coat, how cancer cells regulate the polyFn build-up, and how Fn cell surface deposits are transformed into covalently bonded, insoluble aggregates (9Cheng H.C. Abdel-Ghany M. Elble R.C. Pauli B.U. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24207-24215Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). To answer some of these questions we examined polyFn genesis in lung-metastatic MTF7L rat breast cancer cells subjected to end-over-end (EoE) suspension culture in serum- or pFn-containing medium, which together induce and augment the build-up of a polyFn surface coat similar to that observed on tumor cells that have entered the blood circulation (9Cheng H.C. Abdel-Ghany M. Elble R.C. Pauli B.U. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24207-24215Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The data presented here show that assembly of the prometastatic, multiglobular polyFn surface coat on MTF7L breast cancer cells depends upon the synthesis and secretion of endogenous, cellular Fn (Fn1: EDA+EDB+IIICS120-Fn) and is regulated by membrane-translocation and Ser/Thr phosphorylation of protein kinase Cϵ (PKCϵ). Inhibitors of protein synthesis, protein secretion, and novel PKC isoforms (nPKCs) as well as transfection of MTF7L cells with the PKCϵ regulatory domain (RD) or PKCϵ siRNA species all substantially decrease the ability of the cancer cells to assemble a polyFn surface coat. Functionally, inability to assemble polyFn is associated with failure to colonize the lungs. Together, our studies provide novel insights of the regulation of Fn in suspended (blood-borne) breast cancer cells and provide a renewed appreciation for the previously recognized role of Fn in metastasis (1Zhang L.

In some cases hygromycin-selected clones (cl) were further selected by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) for optimal expression.Flow Cytometry—FACS was used to quantify Fn expression on MTF7L breast cancer cell surfaces (9Cheng H.C.

Tumor cells that had been subjected to EoE suspension culture were washed twice in DMEM containing 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA), then incubated with rabbit anti-Fn[pan] antibody diluted 1:100 in PBS containing 1% BSA (PBS-BSA) for 1 h at 4 °C. After washing in PBS-BSA, tumor cells were stained with PE-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit antiserum in PBS-BSA for 1 h at 4 °C and fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde in PBS. In select experiments cells were stained with mouse anti-Fn[EDA] (diluted 1:50) and PE-conjugated goat anti-mouse antiserum. FACS analysis was performed on a Coulter Epics Profile (Coulter Electronics, Hialeah, FL). Nonspecific fluorescence was accounted for by incubating tumor cells with non-immune rabbit serum instead of primary antibody. To quantify the effect of overexpressed or knocked-down proteins on polyFn assembly, we generate bivariate distributions of red fluorescence (y axis: cells stained with anti-Fn antibodies and PE-conjugated secondary antibodies) and green fluorescence (x axis: same cells expressing GFP-tagged protein or co-transfected with GFP and cDNA of interest). The levels of polyFn expression in the cell population that emitted high GFP fluorescence were taken as a reflection of the effect of the transfected cDNA on polyFn assembly. To assess the effect of inhibitors of cell signaling, tumor cells were incubated with inhibitor 30 min before (adherent) and throughout EoE suspension culture, then subjected to polyFn quantification as described above. Controls were tumor cells incubated in equimolar inhibitor solvent concentration.Semiquantitative Reverse Transcription-PCR Analyses—Total RNA was prepared from MTF7L grown as adherent monolayers or in EoE suspension cultures by extraction with Trizol as described by the manufacturer (Invitrogen). For every experimental sample, total RNA was quantified both spectrophotometrically and electrophoretically, and amounts were adjusted so that 1 μg was reverse-transcribed (SuperScript reverse transcriptase; Invitrogen). cDNA was subjected to PCR (93 °C for 30 s; 55 °C, 30 s; 72 °C, 30 s; 35 cycles) using TaqDNA polymerase (Invitrogen) and primer sets derived from rat Fn1 (NM_019143), PKCδ (NM_133307), PKCϵ (NM_017171), PKCη (NM_031085), PKCθ (XM_341553), and PKCζ ((NM_022507). Controls were run in the absence of reverse transcriptase. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase served as reference standard.Cell Fractionation—MTF7L cells and transfectants thereof were incubated in EoE suspension culture in DMEM containing 20% FBS for the indicated periods of time. Cells were washed in PBS, collected by centrifugation, and resuspended in 0.5 ml ice-cold Tris buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm NaF, 0.1 mm NaVO4, 20 μm leupeptin, 0.1% aprotinin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Cells were disrupted by two 15-s cycles of sonication at 4 °C using a microprobe sonicator at maximum power. After removal of unbroken cells and nuclei by centrifugation (500 × g for 5 min at 4 °C), supernatants were centrifuged at 16,300 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The resulting supernatant was designated the cytosolic fraction. The pellet was solubilized in 0.5 ml of buffer A containing 1% Triton X-100 for 1 h at 4 °C EoE, then centrifuged at 16,300 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The detergent-solute was designated the membrane fraction. Twenty micrograms of protein from both the cytosolic and membrane fractions were separated by SDS-PAGE (10%), transferred to nitrocellulose membrane at 4 °C, and probed by Western blotting as described (9Cheng H.C.

Total cell lysates or cytosolic and membrane fractions were subjected to (i) SDS-PAGE (∼20-50 μg of protein) and Western blotting using anti-Fn[pan], anti-Fn[EDA], or various PKC isoform-specific antibodies, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit, or goat anti-mouse secondary antibodies and ECL for detection of bound antibody as described (9Cheng H.C.

Cell growth was monitored in daily intervals for up to 4 days. At the end of each incubation period, tumor cells were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde in PBS and then stained with 0.5% crystal violet in 20% methanol as described (21Cheng H.C. Abdel-Ghany M.

Absorbance was read on a microplate reader (Bio-Teck Instruments) at 562 nm and graphed as a function of time of incubation.Isolation of Blood-borne Cancer Cells from Tumor-bearing Rats—MTF7L cancer cells (1 × 106 cells/50 μl of DMEM) were injected into the 4th (left + right) mammary fat pads of six 6-week-old female Fischer 344 rats. At a tumor diameter of ∼2 cm, rats were anesthetized by an intraperitoneal injection of sodium pentobarbital (65 mg/kg body weight), and blood was collected by cardiac puncture. Pooled, EDTA-treated blood was transferred to precooled 50-ml centrifuge tubes containing 15 ml of OncoQuick tumor enrichment medium below a porous barrier (Greiner Bio-One, Longwood, FL) and centrifuged at 1600 × g for 20 min at 4 °C in a swing-out rotor as described by Rosenberg et al.

To probe the functional role of these residues in the chaperonin mechanism, we generated and characterized C-terminal truncated, double ring, and single ring mutants of GroEL. The ability to assist the refolding of substrate proteins rhodanese and malate dehydrogenase decreased suddenly when 23 amino acids were truncated, indicating that a sudden change in the environment within the central cavity had occurred. From further experiments and analyses of the hydropathy of the C-terminal region, we focused on the hydrophilicity of the sequence region 526KNDAAD531 and generated two GroEL mutants where these residues were changed to a neutral hydropathy sequence (526GGGAAG531) and a hydrophobic sequence (526IGIAAI531), respectively. Very interestingly, the two mutants were found to be defective in function both in vitro and in vivo. Deterioration of function was not observed in mutants where this region was replaced by a scrambled (526NKADDA531) or homologous (526RQEGGE531) sequence, indicating that the hydrophilicity of this sequence was important.

These results highlight the importance of the hydrophilic nature of 526KNDAAD531 residues in the flexible C-terminal region for proper protein folding within the central cavity of GroEL. The chaperonin GroEL (14-mer) from Escherichia coli binds denatured proteins and facilitates their folding in vivo and in vitro by encapsulating them within an isolated cavity formed in cooperation with the co-chaperonin GroES (7-mer) (1Gething M.J. Sambrook J. Nature. 1992; 355: 33-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (3576) Google Scholar, 2Hartl F.U. Nature. 1996; 381: 571-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (3090) Google Scholar). Encapsulation by GroEL protects the denatured proteins from interactions with other misfolded proteins or aggregation prone species, providing the proper environment in which the denatured protein may fold spontaneously (3Mayhew M. Silva da A.C. Martin J. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Hartl F.U. Nature. 1996; 379: 420-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar, 4Weissman J.S. Rye H.S. Fenton W.A. Beechem J.M. Horwich A.L.

The unique quaternary structure (two heptameric rings stacked back to back) of GroEL enables a clever mechanism. The subunit structure (548 amino acid residues) is divided into three domains; the apical domain, the intermediate domain, and the equatorial domain. Each domain has a specific role in the chaperonin mechanism. The apical domain plays an important role in recognizing and binding denatured protein and the co-chaperonin GroES. The intermediate domain connects the apical and the equatorial domains, and the equatorial domain binds ATP and hydrolyzes it. This ATP hydrolysis controls the overall chaperonin mechanism, regulating binding and release of the substrate protein and GroES (7Braig K. Otwinowski Z. Hegde R. Boisvert D.C. Joachimiak A.

Horwich A.L. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3220-3230Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The refolding substrate protein is encapsulated by GroEL-GroES and segregated from the surrounding environment and, under these conditions, folds correctly without forming aggregation.Thus, the mechanism of GroEL-mediated protein folding is well characterized. However, some details regarding the specific roles of various structural elements in the GroEL subunit structure remain unclear. For example, as shown in Fig. 1, the final 23 amino acid residues of the C terminus are not clearly defined in x-ray crystallographic studies (9Xu Z. Horwich A.L. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1997; 388: 741-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (1031) Google Scholar) due to high flexibility. However, these segments of GroEL oligomer appear to coalesce and block the central channel at the level of the equatorial domain in electron micrograph (12Chen S. Roseman A.M. Hunter A.S. Wood S.P. Burston S.G. Ranson N.A. Clarke A.R. Saibil H.R. Nature. 1994; 371: 261-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar) and small-angle neutron scattering (13Thiyagarajan P. Henderson S.J. Joachimiak A. Structure. 1996; 4: 79-88Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) experiments. Previously, it was reported that this C-terminal region is closely involved in the rate of ATP hydrolysis (14McLennan N.F. Girshovich A.S. Lissin N.M. Charters Y. Masters M. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 7: 49-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) and GroEL oligomerization (15Burnett B.P. Horwich A.L. Low K.B. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 6980-6985Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16McLennan N.F. McAteer S. Masters M. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 14: 309-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). However, a mutant with 27-amino acid residues truncated from the C terminus was still functional and could support normal growth of the host cell (15Burnett B.P. Horwich A.L. Low K.B. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 6980-6985Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16McLennan N.F. McAteer S. Masters M. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 14: 309-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Moreover, the role of the C-terminal region in the mitochondrial homologue Hsp60 (572 amino acid residues) from Saccharomyces cerevisiae was studied by using C-terminal truncation and insertion mutants (17Fang Y.C. Cheng M. J. Biomed. Sci. 2002; 9: 223-233PubMed Google Scholar). From the results of refolding assays using these mutants, it was concluded that the predominantly hydrophobic residues in the C-terminal region are important for substrate folding inside the central cavity.These results indicated that the C-terminal region of chaperonin is involved in multiple facets of the chaperonin mechanism, i.e. in ATP hydrolysis activity, stabilization of chaperonin quaternary structure, and substrate protein folding. However, exactly how these C-terminal amino acids participate in the chaperonin mechanism and, more importantly, which specific residues within this region are important are still unknown. Very recently, Tang et al. (18Tang Y.C. Chang H.C. Roeben A. Wischnewski D. Wischnewski N. Kerner M.J. Hartl F.U. Hayer-Hartl M. Cell. 2006; 125: 903-914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar) showed that the chaperonin cage provided a physical environment optimized to catalyze the folding reaction of proteins within a specific size range by facilitating folding kinetics. This was determined by using GroEL mutants with elongated C-terminal amino acid residues. However, Farr et al. (19Farr G.W. Fenton W.A. Horwich A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 5342-5347Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) performed similar experiments and reported no acceleration in folding rate in these tail-elongated single-ring GroEL mutants. This discrepancy may also be resolved by additional detailed information regarding the flexible C-terminal region.In this study, we focused particularly on the final 23 amino acid residues (526KNDAADLGAAGGMGGMGGMGGMM548) at the C-terminal region of E. coli GroEL, which are invisible in x-ray crystal structures, and attempted to understand the role of this region in chaperonin function. To this end, we generated three types of C-terminal amino acid-truncated mutants (dC541, dC531, and dC525), in which the final 7, 17, and 23 residues were, respectively, truncated from the C terminus. From detailed studies on structural and functional characteristics of the mutants, the importance of a hydrophilic amino acid region, 526KNDAAD531 was highlighted. The critical importance of the hydrophilic nature of this region for chaperonin function was confirmed by modifying this sequence in a controlled manner. These results showed clearly that the hydrophilic nature of 526KNDAAD531 is critical in maintaining a proper environment for substrate protein folding within the central cavity. This is the first report that identifies specific amino acid residues within the crystallographically disordered C-terminal region that are critical to chaperonin function.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPreparation of Mutant Proteins—C-terminal truncated mutants of double ring and single ring GroEL, and NE, HB, SC, and SH mutants of double and single ring full-length GroEL were constructed by using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene), using either pUCESL (wild-type GroEL) (10Kawata Y.

After ultrasonic disruption and removal of nucleic acids by addition of streptomycin, proteins were recovered by ammonium sulfate precipitation (55%) and loaded onto a Superdex 200 HR 10/30 gel-filtration column (GE Healthcare Life Sciences), which had been equilibrated with purification buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, containing 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 20% methanol), at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. GroEL fractions were pooled and loaded separately onto a Resource-Q (6 ml) anion-exchange column (GE Healthcare Life Sciences), which had been equilibrated with the purification buffer and eluted with a linear gradient (0–0.5 m NaCl) at a flow rate of 2 ml/min.

Fluorescence Measurements—CD spectra were measured on a Jasco J-720 spectropolarimeter equipped with a constant-temperature cell holder at 25 °C. The buffer used was 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and protein concentrations of wild-type GroEL and C-terminal truncated mutants were 50 μg/ml during measurement.Measurements of ANS binding fluorescence were performed on a Jasco FP-6300 fluorescence spectrophotometer equipped with a constant-temperature cell holder at 25 °C. GroEL and C-terminal truncated mutants (0.46 μm) were mixed with ANS (5 μm) in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5. The excitation wavelength was 371 nm, and the emission spectra were recorded at 400–550 nm.Fluorescent Dye Labeling and FRET Measurements—EL-WT/Met548 → Cys, EL-dC531/Asp531 → Cys, and EL-dC525/Pro525 → Cys (3.13 μm) were incubated with tetramethylrhodamine-5-maleimide (TMR5MA) (6.26 μm). The reaction was performed in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 0.1 mm tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (21Getz E.B. Xiao M. Chakrabarty T. Cooke R. Selvin P.R. Anal. Biochem. 1999; 273: 73-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar) for 3 h, and then the sample solution was dialyzed overnight against 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 0.5 g/liter acid washed charcoal (22Yoshimi T. Hongo K. Mizobata T. Kawata Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2006; 139: 407-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Under these conditions, ∼1 mol of TMR5MA was introduced per GroEL oligomer as determined by spectra analysis. Notably, wild-type GroEL (lacking the C-terminal cysteine) was not labeled to any extent under identical conditions (see “Results”). Rhodanese (0.13 μm) was incubated with fluorescein-5-isothiocyanate (FITC) (0.26 μm). The reaction was performed in 0.1 m NaHCO3 buffer, pH 9.0, at 25 °C for 3 h, and then the sample solution was dialyzed overnight against 0.1 m NaHCO3 buffer, pH 9.0, containing 0.5 g/liter acid washed charcoal. The extent of labeling was estimated using the molar extinction coefficient of FITC at 494 nm (ϵ = 77,000 cm-1 m-1) and TMR5MA at 541 nm (ϵ = 95,000 cm-1 m-1). To prepare samples for FRET analysis, FITC-labeled rhodanese was denatured in 0.1 m NaHCO3 buffer, pH 9.0, containing 6 m guanidine hydrochloride and 1.5 mm dithiothreitol at 25 °C for 1 h and diluted 100-fold into 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 1.5-fold molar excess concentrations of TMR5MA-labeled mutants.FRET from the FITC-labeled rhodanese bound on the apical domain to the TMR5MA-labeled mutants were measured by using the Jasco FP-6300 fluorescence spectrophotometer with an excitation wavelength of 494 nm. The emission spectra were monitored at 500–650 nm. The FRET efficiency, E, is given by E = 1 - FDA/FD, where FDA and FD are the fluorescence in the presence and absence of acceptor, respectively (23Fairclough R.H. Cantor C.R. Methods Enzymol. 1978; 48: 347-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Fluorescence peak areas of FDA (554–600 nm) and FD (500–546 nm) were used for determining the efficiency.ATPase Activity Measurements—ATPase activities of GroEL proteins (0.1 μm) were measured at 37 °C, using the method described previously (24Lanzetta P.A.

Biol. 2000; 140: 127-132PubMed Google Scholar) were carried out as previously reported. Refolding of α-glucosidase from S. cerevisiae (Wako) was performed as follows. α-Glucosidase (15 μm) was denatured in 10 mm phosphate buffer, pH 6.8, containing 1 mm EDTA and 6 m guanidine hydrochloride at 25 °C for 1 h. The refolding reaction was started by a 100-fold dilution into 100 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.6, containing 10 mm KCl and 10 mm Mg(CH3COO)2. The temperature and protein concentration of α-glucosidase during the refolding reaction were 25 °C and 0.15 μm, respectively. A 1.5-fold molar excess of GroEL (or C-terminal truncated mutants) and GroES oligomers relative to α-glucosidase were present in the refolding reaction mixtures. After 5-min incubation, ATP was added to a final concentration of 1 mm. At appropriate times during the refolding reaction, 200 μl of the mixture was withdrawn and assayed for α-glucosidase activity by monitoring the conversion of p-nitrophenyl-α-d-glucopyranoside into p-nitrophenol and d-glucose at 405 nm for 1 min. Refolding yield was determined as the percentage ratio of the specific activity of the refolding enzyme relative to that of native enzyme. Refolding assays for rhodanese in the presence of SR1 and truncated SR1 mutants was carried out as previously reported (25Martin J. Langer T. Boteva R. Schramel A. Horwich A.L. Hartl F.U. Nature. 1991; 352: 36-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar), except that in each case GroEL was exchanged for the SR1 variant.Assessment of Trapping Ability of Rhodanese Refolding Intermediates—To examine whether the amounts of rhodanese encapsulated in the EL-WT cavity and EL-dC525 cavity were different, GroEL saturated with heat-denatured rhodanese was subjected to proteinase K digestion, as described previously (28Motojima F. Yoshida M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 26648-26654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 29Taguchi H. Tsukuda K. Motojima F. Koike-Takeshita A. Yoshida M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 45737-45743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). First, we incubated 2 μm rhodanese at 60 °C for 15 min in buffer (50 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, containing 100 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm dithiothreitol) containing 0.5 μm GroEL and 1 μm GroES. The temperature was then shifted down to 25 °C and NaF, BeCl2, and ATP (final concentrations, 10 mm, 1 mm, and 1 mm, respectively) were added. After 10-min incubation at 25 °C, proteinase K was added to a final concentration of 1 μg/ml. After 30-min incubation at 25 °C, phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride was added to a final concentration of 1 mm, and subsequently GroEL-rhodanese-GroES ternary complex was isolated by using a 100-kDa cut centrifugal filter device (Centricon YM-100, Millipore) and analyzed by SDS-PAGE (15% polyacrylamide gel). The quantitation of the bands was performed using the public domain software NIH Image (National Institutes of Health, available from rsb.info.nih.gov/nih-image/download.html).RESULTSStructural Characteristics and ATPase Activity of C-terminal Truncated GroEL MutantsUsing site-directed mutagenesis, we generated successive C-terminal truncated mutants of double ring GroEL (EL-dC541, EL-dC531, and EL-dC525), single ring variants of these mutants (SR1-dC541, SR1-dC531, and SR1-dC525), and analogs of each double ring mutant where the C-terminal amino acid was changed to cysteine (EL-WT/Met548 → Cys, EL-dC541/Met541 → Cys, EL-dC531/Asp531 → Cys, and EL-dC525/Pro525 → Cys). Amino acid sequences of the C-terminal region of each mutant are summarized in Table 1. Truncations were confirmed by analyzing subunit molecular weights with SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2A). The extent of GroEL expression was similar for all the mutants constructed. We further examined the oligomeric state of each mutant by native-PAGE and size-exclusion chromatography (not shown), indicating that all of the C-terminal truncated mutants formed oligomeric states similar to wild-type GroEL. As shown in Fig. 2B, CD measurements also showed that the overall secondary structures of all of the mutants were quite similar to wild-type GroEL. This suggests that the flexible C-terminal region does not form a definite secondary structure. Thus, we concluded that deletions of up to 23 residues from the C-terminal amino acid residue of GroEL have no effect on overall chaperonin structure. This was consistent with results reported previously (15Burnett B.P. Horwich A.L. Low K.B. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 6980-6985Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16McLennan N.F. McAteer S. Masters M. Mol.

In the absence of GroES, the ATPase activities of all of the double ring GroEL mutants were decreased to about one-half of wild-type GroEL (EL-WT), suggesting that the ATP hydrolysis activity is disrupted by C-terminal truncation, as reported previously (14McLennan N.F. Girshovich A.S. Lissin N.M. Charters Y. Masters M. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 7: 49-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 30Langer T. Pfeifer G. Martin J. Baumeister W. Hartl F.U. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4757-4765Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). Interestingly, Farr et al. (19Farr G.W. Fenton W.A. Horwich A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 5342-5347Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) demonstrated that the ATPase activity was promoted by C-terminal extension (Gly-Gly-Met repeats). It is interesting to note that the C-terminal amino acid residues influence the ATP hydrolysis activity of GroEL in such a manner. In the presence of GroES, the ATPase activities of all of the mutants were additionally suppressed by ∼50%, similar to EL-WT, suggesting that in each case GroEL and GroES formed GroEL-GroES complexes (31Todd M.J. Viitanen P.V. Lorimer G.H. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 8560-8567Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). These results suggested that the interactions of these mutants with GroES were all similar to EL-WT. Contrary to this, the ATPase activities of all of the single ring C-terminal truncated GroEL mutants (SR1-dCn) were almost the same as that of wild-type (SR1-WT), presumably due to missing inter-ring contacts. The ATPase activities of all of the SR1 mutants were strongly suppressed by the addition of GroES, which is also in agreement with the behavior of SR1-WT chaperonin (32Weissman J.S. Hohl C.M. Kovalenko O. Kashi Y. Chen S. Braig K. Saibil H.R. Fenton W.A. Horwich A.L. Cell. 1995; 83: 577-587Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar).FRET between Substrate Protein Bound to the Apical Domain and the Truncated C TerminusTo observe the orientation of the flexible C-terminal region of GroEL inside the central cavity, we performed FRET experiments. If the flexible C-terminal polypeptide normally extends and protrudes toward the interior of the central cavity, FRET efficiencies between the C-terminal residue and substrate protein bound at the apical domain would be expected to decrease in proportion to the length of amino acid residues truncated in our mutants. We used FITC to label a substrate protein (rhodanese, fluorescence donor) and TMR5MA (fluorescence acceptor) to label GroEL truncation mutants at the C-terminal cysteine residue introduced into EL-WT/Met548 → Cys, EL-dC531/Asp531 → Cys, and EL-dC525/Pro525 → Cys. FRET between fluorescein and tetramethylrhodamine moieties introduced to Cys242 located at the top of the apical domain and Cys527 at the vicinity of the C-terminal residue of GroEL was successfully observed in a previous study (33Motojima F. Chaudhry C. Fenton W.A. Farr G.W. Horwich A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 15005-15012Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Although wild-type GroEL has three cysteine residues at positions 138, 458, and 519, only the newly introduced cysteine residue at the C-terminal was labeled with fluorescence dyes under the relatively mild experimental conditions we used, because EL-WT was not labeled at all under the same conditions (Table 2). We measured FRET efficiencies between the FITC-labeled rhodanese bound to the apical domain and the TMR5MA-labeled C-terminal of wild-type chaperonin and mutants as shown in Fig. 3 (A–C) and determined the fluorescence energy transfer efficiencies (E). Interestingly, as shown in Fig. 3D, the FRET efficiencies were almost the same for all three truncated mutants. In our present experiments, we cannot estimate the distance between the fluorescein and the tetramethylrhodamine moieties quantitatively, because the specific positions of those introduced fluorescent dyes in the GroEL-refolding rhodanese complex cannot be determined topologically. However, we can evaluate qualitatively any large changes in the overall FRET efficiency. Thus, this result suggests that the distance between FITC-labeled rhodanese bound to the apical domain and the TMR5MA moiety at the C-terminal residue was independent of the length of C-terminal amino acid deletion."

The actions of ligands in both receptor types could be appropriately explained by this two-state model. Ligands such as agonists and antagonists affect receptor function by stabilizing one or both conformations. The 5-HT3 receptor is a member of the Cys-loop ligand-gated ion channel superfamily participating in synaptic transmission. Here we show that co-expression of the 5-HT3A and 5-HT3B receptor subunits in the human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells results in a receptor that displays a low level of constitutive (or agonist-independent) activity. Furthermore, we also demonstrate that the properties of ligands can be modified by receptor composition. Whereas the 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) analog 5-methoxyindole is a partial agonist at the 5-HT3A receptor, it becomes a “protean agonist” (functioning as an agonist and an inverse agonist at the same receptor) at the 5-HT3AB receptor (after the Greek god Proteus, who was able to change his shape and appearance at will). In addition, the 5-HT analog 5-hydroxyindole is a positive allosteric modulator for the liganded active (AR*) conformation of the 5-HT3A and 5-HT3AB receptors and a negative allosteric modulator for the spontaneously active (R*) conformation of the 5-HT3AB receptor, suggesting that the spontaneously active (R*) and liganded active (AR*) conformations are differentially modulated by 5-hydroxyindole. Thus, the incorporation of the 5-HT3B subunit leads to spontaneous channel opening and altered ligand properties.

LGICs 2The abbreviations used are:LGICligand-gated ion channel5-HT5-hydroxytryptamine5-MI5-methoxyindole5-HI5-hydroxyindoleGABAAγ-aminobutyric acid, type AGPCRG protein-coupled receptor. are transmembrane proteins that mediate synaptic transmission upon binding of neurotransmitters at the chemical synapse. All of the LGICs are formed by the assembly of homologous subunits. The 5-hydroxytryptamine type 3 (5-HT3) receptor, a member of the Cys-loop LGIC superfamily, which includes nicotinic acetylcholine, γ-aminobutyric acid, type A (GABAA), and glycine receptors (1Karlin A.

In the absence of agonist, channel opening of the 5-HT3A receptor is theoretically possible but has not been observed experimentally. However, certain mutations in the 5-HT3A receptor, such as 5-HT3A V13′S (V291S), have produced spontaneously opening channels (8Zhang L. Hosoi M. Fukuzawa M. Sun H. Rawlings R.R. Weight F.F. J. Biol.

LGICs exist in two general classes of states: inactive (closed) and active (open), and each of these classes may contain multiple states that differ in average lifetime, agonist site occupancy, etc. The function of LGICs is determined by the transitions among these states. However, the mechanism for receptor activation is not completely understood. Based on observations on ligand-gated ion channels, a two-state model of receptor activation was proposed by del Castillo and Katz in 1957 (10Castillo del J. Katz B. Proc. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1957; 146: 369-381Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). The del Castillo-Katz mechanism represents a sequential model, which suggests that the receptor is inactive in the absence of agonist and the binding of agonist to the inactive state (R) induces a conformational change of the receptor to an activated state (R*). Monod, Wyman, and Changeux (1965) proposed that the oligomeric proteins can undergo reversible transitions between discrete conformations such as R ↔ R* in the absence of agonist (11Monod J. Wyman J. Changeux J.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1965; 12: 88-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (6180) Google Scholar). This concept was supported by the finding of constitutive activity in GPCRs first reported by Costa and Herz in 1989 (12Costa T. Herz A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 7321-7325Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). Because the del Castillo-Katz mechanism does not predict spontaneous channel opening in the absence of agonist, a modified two-state model was established (Fig. 1) (13Leff P. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1995; 16: 89-97Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). According to this model, receptors exist in a conformational equilibrium between R and R* of the unliganded receptor; and compounds alter receptor function by causing a re-distribution between the two states. An agonist preferentially binds and stabilizes the R* conformation, and an inverse agonist preferentially binds and stabilizes the R conformation. A neutral antagonist binds equally to both conformations. Although this allosteric two-state model could adequately explain most receptor behavior, it remains unknown whether the spontaneously active (R*) and liganded active (AR*) conformations are the same and whether AR* conformations are the same for different agonists (14Colquhoun D. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1998; 125: 924-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (787) Google Scholar). Complementary DNA Constructs and Transfection—5-HT3A (gift from Dr. D. Julius) and 5-HT3B (gift from Dr. E. F. Kirkness) receptor subunits were subcloned into the vector pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen). HEK 293 cells were transiently transfected with the 5-HT3A or 5-HT3A and 5-HT3B receptor cDNA using the Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Green fluorescent protein (pGreen Lantern, Invitrogen) was co-expressed with the 5-HT3 receptor subunits to permit selection of transfected cells under fluorescence optics. Patch Clamp Electrophysiology—Whole-cell patch clamp recordings were performed as described previously (15Hu X.Q. Lovinger D.M. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2005; 568: 381-396Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar), in HEK cells transfected with 5-HT3 receptors and green fluorescent protein. The external solution contained (in mm): 140 NaCl, 5 KCl, 1.8 CaCl2, 1.2 MgCl2, 10 glucose, and 10 HEPES (pH 7.4 with NaOH and ∼340 mosmol liter–1 with sucrose). Patch pipettes contained (in mm) 140 CsCl, 2 MgCl2, 10 EGTA, and 10 HEPES (pH 7.2 with CsOH and ∼315 mosmol liter–1 with sucrose). Data Analysis—Data were acquired using pCLAMP 9.0 software (Axon). Currents were filtered at 2 kHz and digitized at 5–10 kHz. Data analysis and curve-fitting were performed with Origin 7.0 (Microcal), pCLAMP 9.0 (Axon), or GraphPad InStat 3.0 (GraphPad) software. Data are presented as mean ± S.E. Incorporation of the 5-HT3B Subunit Alters Desensitization Kinetics of the 5-HT3 Receptor—The heteromeric 5-HT3AB receptor was transiently expressed in the HEK 293 cells, and the successful incorporation of the 5-HT3B receptor subunit was confirmed by examining the desensitization kinetics. The transfected cells were exposed to a maximally efficacious concentration of 5-HT (30 μm) for 10 s. In the continued presence of the agonist the 5-HT current decayed after reaching a peak in the 5-HT3A and 5-HT3AB receptors, a process representing receptor desensitization (Fig. 2A). The desensitization was gradual and monoexponential in the 5-HT3A receptor. However, the current decay was much faster and biexponential in the 5-HT3AB receptor. The overall desensitization measured as weighted desensitization was ∼6-fold faster in the 5-HT3AB receptor than in the 5-HT3A receptor (Fig. 2B). Spontaneous Channel Opening of the 5-HT3AB Receptor Is Conferred by the 5-HT3B Subunit—The possibility of spontaneous opening of the 5-HT3AB receptor was examined by exposing the transfected cells to the 5-HT3 receptor antagonist MDL 72222 and 5-HT analogs 5-methoxyindole (5-MI) and 5-hydroxyindole (5-HI) (see supplemental Fig. 1 for chemical structures). We first tested the actions of the 5-HT3 receptor antagonist MDL 72222 (Fig. 3A). MDL 72222 was previously used to detect spontaneous channel openings of Arg-246 mutant 5-HT3A receptors (8Zhang L. Hosoi M. Fukuzawa M. Sun H. Rawlings R.R. Weight F.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46256-46264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Consistent with previous studies (15Hu X.Q. Lovinger D.M. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2005; 568: 381-396Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 16Hu X.Q. Zhang L. Stewart R.R. Weight F.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 46583-46589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), at a holding potential of –60 mV, MDL 72222 (1 μm) did not alter the base-line current at the 5-HT3A receptor. However, an application of MDL 72222 produced a decrease in the base-line current (manifesting as an apparent outward current) at the 5-HT3AB receptor that was 1.2 ± 0.4% of the amplitude of the 30 μm 5-HT-activated response. This is consistent with a low level of constitutive activity of the 5-HT3AB receptor due to spontaneous opening of the channels. The apparent outward current persisted for more than 20 s after removal of MDL 72222, which is most probably the result of the high affinity of MDL 72222 for the receptor. We also used Zn2+ (1 mm), an open channel blocker at the 5-HT3 receptor, 3X.-Q. Hu, unpublished data. to examine constitutive activity of the 5-HT3 receptors (Fig. 3B). Co-application of Zn2+ with 5-HT rapidly brought 5-HT-activated current to base-line levels in the 5-HT3A receptor due to blocking of the open channels. Interestingly, Zn2+ produced an overshoot above the base line during application of 5-HT in the 5-HT3AB receptor, suggesting that the activity of the 5-HT3AB receptor is suppressed below its spontaneous opening state. This overshoot current provides further evidence for the existence of constitutive activity of the 5-HT3AB receptor. 5-HT Analogs Reveal Distinct Active Conformations of the 5-HT3AB Receptor—The use of 5-HT analogs (supplemental Fig. 1) also revealed the constitutive activity of the 5-HT3AB receptor. The 5-HT analog 5-MI functioned as a partial agonist at the 5-HT3A receptor (Fig. 4A). A rebound current appeared upon termination of 5-MI application. The maximal response activated by 5 mm 5-MI was ∼34.4 ± 3.3% of the response activated by 30 μm 5-HT at –60 mV. At the 5-HT3AB receptor 5-MI displayed unusual behavior. 5-MI (5 mm) evoked a transient inward current followed by an apparent outward current (Fig. 4A). The amplitude of the inward current was 3.5 ± 0.7% of that activated by 30 μm 5-HT at –60 mV, which is significantly reduced when compared with the 5-HT3A receptor (p < 0.01, Student's t test). This finding suggests that the efficacy of 5-MI is reduced in the 5-HT3AB receptor. The amplitude of the apparent outward current was 0.9 ± 0.1% of 30 μm 5-HT-activated response. This action of 5-MI was readily reversible, and there was also a rebound current upon removal of 5-MI. The characteristics of 5-MI activation at negative and positive holding potentials were similar in the 5-HT3A receptor and in the 5-HT3AB receptor (Fig. 4B), with the exception that the direction of the currents was reversed. The observation that 5-MI produced both a transient inward current and a persistent apparent outward current at negative holding potentials is consistent with both positive and negative (inverse) agonism at the 5-HT3AB receptor. We also explored the actions of 5-HI, an analog of 5-HT that is a positive allosteric modulator of the 5-HT3 receptor (17Kooyman A.R. Hooft van J.A. Vijverberg H.P. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1993; 108: 287-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 18Gunthorpe M.J. Lummis S.C. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1999; 519: 713-722Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar). 5-HI (5 mm), when co-applied with 5-HT (30 μm) following a delay of 250 ms or 10 s, enhanced the current amplitude by 17.1 ± 1.3% and 14.5 ± 1.0%, respectively, in the 5-HT3A receptor (Fig. 5A). Similar applications of 5-HI during the course of agonist application enhanced agonist-activated steady-state current by 66.7 ± 7.8% for 5-HT and 53.7 ± 1.5% for dopamine (a partial agonist) in the 5-HT3AB receptor (Fig. 5B). A pure positive allosteric modulator facilitates agonist-mediated receptor activity without intrinsic agonism. As expected, 5-HI alone did not change the base-line current in the 5-HT3A receptor in the absence of agonist. Unlike 5-MI, 5-HI did not activate a transient inward current but only induced an apparent outward current in the 5-HT3AB receptor. This apparent outward current was rapidly reversible upon removal of 5-HI (Fig. 5C) and had an amplitude that was 1.1 ± 0.3% of that activated by 30 μm 5-HT. Therefore, 5-HI selectively produces negative (inverse) agonism but not the positive agonism seen with 5-MI in the 5-HT3AB receptor. As was the case for 5-MI, there was a rebound current upon the removal of 5-HI. The occurrence of the rebound current has also been observed for other negative allosteric modulators or inverse agonists such as bicuculline at the α1β3γ2L GABAA receptor (19Bianchi M.T. Macdonald R.L. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 9083-9091Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), 17α-methyltestosterone at the α2β3ϵ GABAA receptor (20Jones B.L. Whiting P.J. Henderson L.P. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2006; 573: 571-593Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar), and strychnine at the D97R glycine receptor (21Beckstead M.J. Phelan R. Trudell J.R. Bianchini M.J. Mihic S.J. J. Neurochem. 2002; 82: 1343-1351Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The nature of the rebound current is not clear at present; it likely represents a rapid unbinding of 5-MI or 5-HI from a low affinity site. The other 5-HT analog 3-(2-hydroxyethyl)indole acted as an agonist in both the 5-HT3A and 5-HT3AB receptor, although the relative efficacy of 3-(2-hydroxyethyl)indole was dramatically reduced by the incorporation of the 5-HT3B subunit (17.0 ± 1.3% → 2.0 ± 0.4%; supplemental Fig. 2). This observation implies that the hydroxyl (for 5-HI) or methoxyl (for 5-MI) group at position 5 of the indole molecule is required for detecting spontaneous activity of the 5-HT3AB receptor. Properties of the Constitutive Activity of the 5-HT3AB Receptor—The nature of the 5-HI current was further examined by studying the current-voltage (I-V) relationship and reversal potential. The I-V relationship of the 5-HI current is symmetrical to that of 5-HT current in the 5-HT3AB receptor. Whereas the 5-HT current showed inward rectification, the 5-HI current displayed apparently outward rectification (Fig. 6). The 5-HI current reversed at 3.3 ± 0.4 mV, which is comparable to the reversal potential for 5-HT at the 5-HT3AB receptor (2.9 ± 0.3 mV). Those observations suggest that the constitutive activity is mediated by the 5-HT3AB receptor and that both the spontaneously active and ligand-activated receptors have the same ionic permeability. The onset of blocking the spontaneously active channel displayed 5-HI concentration dependence, whereas the offset of blocking was largely independent of 5-HI concentrations (supplemental Fig. 3, A and B). The rate of blocking (1/τBlock) is linear with 5-HI concentration with a slope of 5.9 × 104 m–1s–1 (kon, 5-HI binding rate, supplemental Fig. 3C). The y-axis intercepts were similar for linear regression fitting of 1/τBlock and 1/τUnblock, being 4.5 s–1 and 4.8 s–1, respectively (koff, 5-HI unbinding rate). Therefore, the equilibrium dissociation constant (Ki) for 5-HI blocking the spontaneous channel opening is ∼7.5 mm. Most GPCRs and LGICs exhibit a low to negligible level of constitutive activity. However, the level of constitutive activity can be enhanced by mutations and overexpression (14Colquhoun D. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1998; 125: 924-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (787) Google Scholar, 22Ligt de R.A. Kourounakis A.P. Ijzerman A.P. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2000; 130: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 23Kenakin T. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 598-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). In addition, certain receptor subunit combinations in LGICs exhibit constitutive activity (24Neelands T.R. Fisher J.L. Bianchi M. Macdonald R.L. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 55: 168-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). In the 5-HT3A receptor the energy barrier for channel opening is sufficiently high to prevent spontaneous openings in the absence of agonist. The shifts of base-line current by MDL 72222 in the absence of agonist and Zn2+ in the presence of agonist support the existence of constitutive activity in the 5-HT3AB receptor. The 5-HT3B subunit does not form functional homomeric receptors, but the observations in this study indicate that it has a lower energy barrier to channel opening relative to the 5-HT3A subunit. It is not currently clear how structural constraints keep the unliganded 5-HT3A receptor in the inactive conformation and how the incorporation of the 5-HT3B receptor subunit disrupts these structural constraints. The amino acid sequence of the 5-HT3B receptor subunit has only ∼45% homology with the 5-HT3A receptor subunit (2Davies P.A. Pistis M. Hanna M.C. Peters J.A. Lambert J.J. Hales T.G. Kirkness E.F. Nature. 1999; 397: 359-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar, 3Dubin A.E. Huvar R. D'Andrea M.R. Pyati J. Zhu J.Y. Joy K.C. Wilson S.J. Galindo J.E. Glass C.A. Luo L. Jackson M.R. Lovenberg T.W. Erlander M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30799-30810Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). A recent study using atomic force microscopy has revealed that the 5-HT3AB receptor is formed by two 5-HT3A subunits and three 5-HT3B receptor subunits (25Barrera N.P. Herbert P. Henderson R.M. Martin I.L. Edwardson J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 12595-12600Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The conformational change associated with ion channel opening in 5-HT3 receptors is proposed to involve a rotation of the M2 helices (26Lummis S.C. Beene D.L. Lee L.W. Lester H.A. Broadhurst R.W. Dougherty D.A. Nature. 2005; 438: 248-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). Although the precise number of subunits that must undergo the conformational change to open the channel is unclear at present, results from nicotinic acetylcholine receptors would suggest that two activated subunits may be sufficient to open the channel (27Unwin N. FEBS Lett. 2003; 555: 91-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Constitutive activity is determined by the equilibrium between the two interconvertible conformations R and R*. If the 5-HT3B subunit is indeed able to spontaneously undergo this conformational change, the stoichiometry of the 5-HT3AB receptor (B-B-A-B-A) would thus make it likely that some channels could spontaneously open in the absence of agonist due to altering the equilibrium constant between R and R*. Since the description of the constitutive activity in a GPCR by Costa and Herz in 1989 (12Costa T. Herz A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 7321-7325Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar), a variety of compounds originally described as antagonists have been shown to exhibit effects opposite to those of agonists (i.e. suppressing constitutive activity) and have thus been reclassified as inverse agonists. The observation that MDL 72222, a traditional 5-HT3 receptor antagonist, inhibits constitutive activity suggests that this compound could function as an inverse agonist at the 5-HT3AB receptor. In addition, based on theoretical grounds, Kenakin (23Kenakin T. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 598-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar, 28Kenakin T. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1995; 16: 256-258Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) proposed that positive agonism could revert to negative (inverse) agonism and referred to this as “protean agonism” after the Greek god Proteus who could change his shape and appearance at will. This phenomenon has also been termed as functional selectivity, agonist-directed trafficking of receptor stimulus, and biased agonism (29Urban J.D. Clarke W.P. Zastrow von M. Nichols D.E. Kobilka B. Weinstein H. Javitch J.A. Roth B.L. Christopoulos A. Sexton P.M. Miller K.J. Spedding M. Mailman R.B. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2007; 320: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (907) Google Scholar). A protean agonist is a positive agonist in a quiescent system and an inverse agonist in a constitutive system. GPCRs are usually linked to multiple signal transduction pathways, so that a protean agonist could selectively enhance one or more pathways but depress the others. The existence of compounds that exhibit protean agonism was later confirmed in GPCRs (30Gbahou F. Rouleau A. Morisset S. Parmentier R. Crochet S. Lin J.S. Ligneau X. Tardivel-Lacombe J. Stark H. Schunack W. Ganellin C.R. Schwartz J.C. Arrang J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 11086-11091Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). In contrast to GPCRs, LGICs are coupled to a single ion-permeation pathway, and protean agonism has not been observed. Our observations in the present study confirm the existence of protean agonism in LGICs. The 5-HT3A receptor represents a quiescent receptor system because it does not exhibit constitutive activity. Therefore, in the 5-HT3A receptor 5-MI is a classical del Castillo-Katz agonist that enhances the R → AR* transition. However, the R and R* conformations co-exist in the 5-HT3AB receptor. According to the two-state model, 5-MI could bind to both forms and enhance both the R → AR* and R* → AR* transitions leading to agonism. Furthermore, 5-MI, perhaps by an action at an additional site, could also promote the R* → R transition to produce an inverse agonism. Therefore, both agonism and inverse agonism (i.e. protean agonism) could be observed for 5-MI at the 5-HT3AB receptor. Mutations in the transmembrane 2 domain (at the 12′ position) of the muscle nicotinic acetylcholine receptor create spontaneously opening channels that are accompanied by a conformational change at the binding sites (31Grosman C. Auerbach A. J. Gen. Physiol. 2000; 115: 621-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Such a conformational change might prevent the agonist from binding to the binding pocket and impede the R* → AR* isomerization. The actions of 5-MI in the 5-HT3AB receptor seem to be consistent with this scheme. The major event for receptor activation would then still follow the del Castillo-Katz mechanism even in the constitutively active system (supplemental Fig. 4). Here we present evidence showing that 5-MI operates as an agonist in the 5-HT3A receptor and an agonist and an inverse agonist in the 5-HT3AB receptor. It is unlikely that a ligand binds to the same site to induce different conformational changes. We propose that the agonism and inverse agonism of 5-MI are mediated by binding to two distinct sites. According to the two-state model, an agonist has high affinity for the R* conformation and shifts the balance to the R* conformation. Hence, the R* conformation is assumed to be the same as the AR* conformation. Here we demonstrate that 5-MI displays both agonism and inverse agonism at the 5-HT3AB receptor. Furthermore, our results reveal that 5-HI is a positive modulator when the receptor is in the AR* conformation and a negative modulator (inverse agonist) when the receptor is in the R* conformation (supplemental Fig. 4). If the R* and AR* share the same conformation we would expect an enhanced base-line current by 5-HI in the absence of agonist in the 5-HT3AB receptor. It is likely that 5-HI may interact with discrete sites to exert different efficacies leading to alterations in the transition equilibrium between states. The other possible explanation to our observations is that R* and AR* may represent two distinct conformations. This notion needs to be explored in future studies. 5-HT itself is an agonist at 5-HT3 receptors. However, our observations that 5-HT analogs such as 5-MI and 5-HI can selectively modulate different active conformations in the 5-HT3 receptor suggest that subtle changes in chemical structure of an agonist can dramatically alter the functional properties. Therefore, modifications of the structure of 5-HT, 5-HI, and 5-MI may generate useful tools to study the 5-HT3 receptor mechanism and ligand-receptor interaction and could lead to the development of therapeutic agents that selectively act on specific kinetic states of the 5-HT3 receptor. In addition to constitutive activity, receptors can also be tonically activated by low concentrations of ligands such as neurotransmitters and hormones in vivo (32Farrant M. Nusser Z. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2005; 6: 215-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (1644) Google Scholar). Therefore, the positive and negative allosterism of 5-HI can also be a useful tool to distinguish constitutive activity from tonic activity. 5-MI and 5-HI are a partial agonist and a positive allosteric modulator, respectively, in the 5-HT3A receptor. The incorporation of the 5-HT3B receptor subunit results in the altered properties of these two ligands. Therefore, the subunit composition of the 5-HT3 receptor could regulate its biophysical and pharmacological properties. Taken together, our results suggest that the activity profile of a ligand is determined by the properties of both the ligand and receptor. In summary, our study demonstrates that the 5-HT3B receptor subunit imparts constitutive receptor activity to the 5-HT3 receptor. The occurrence of the constitutive activity leads to alterations in the pharmacological properties of 5-HT analogs. These findings provide new insights into the receptor activation mechanism and may hold promise for the development of new therapeutic agents. We thank Drs.

Whether modified ADF regimens (i.e., allowing a portion of energy needs to be consumed on the fast day) work, as well as true ADF or CR to reduce global cell proliferation rates, remains unresolved. Here, we measured the effects of true ADF, modified ADF, and daily CR on cell proliferation rates in mice. Thirty female C57BL/6J mice were randomized to one of five interventions for 4 wk: 1) CR-25% (25% reduction in daily energy intake), 2) ADF-75% (75% reduction on fast day), 3) ADF-85% (85% reduction on fast day), 4) ADF-100% (100% reduction on fast day), and 5) control (ad libitum intake). Body weights of the ADF groups did not differ from controls, whereas the CR-25% group weighed less than all other groups posttreatment. Epidermal cell proliferation decreased (P<0.01) by 29, 20, and 31% in the CR-25%, ADF-85% and ADF-100% groups, respectively, relative to controls. Proliferation rates of splenic T cells were reduced (P<0.01) by 37, 32, and 31% in the CR-25%, ADF-85%, and ADF-100% groups, respectively, and mammary epithelial cell proliferation was 70, 65, and 62% lower (P<0.01), compared with controls. Insulin-like growth factor-1 levels were reduced (P<0.05) in the CR-25% and ADF-100% groups only. In summary, modified ADF, allowing the consumption of 15% of energy needs on the restricted intake day, decreases global cell proliferation similarly as true ADF and daily CR without reducing body weight."
https://openalex.org/W2021659807,"Replication initiation must be a carefully regulated process to avoid genomic instability caused by aberrant replication. In eukaryotic cells, distinct steps of protein loading (origin licensing) and replication activation are choreographed such that a cell can replicate only once per cell cycle. The first proteins recruited to the origins form the pre-replication complex. Of these proteins, Cdt1 is of interest, as it is the focus of several pathways to control replication initiation. It is degraded by two different pathways, mediated by the interaction of Cdt1 with proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) or with cyclin-Cdk2 and inhibited by geminin once cells are in S-phase, presumably to prevent reloading of pre-replication complexes once S-phase has begun. Although the requirement of Cdt1 in loading MCM2–7 is known, the mechanism by which overexpressed Cdt1 stimulates re-replication is unclear. In this study we have designed various mutations in Cdt1 to determine which portion of Cdt1 is important for re-replication, providing insight into possible mechanisms. Surprisingly, we found that mutants of Cdt1 that do not interact with MCM2–7 are able to induce re-replication when overexpressed. The re-replication is not due to titration of geminin from endogenous Cdt1 and is not accompanied by stabilization of endogenous Cdt1. Additionally, the N-terminal one-third of Cdt1 is sufficient to induce re-replication. The N terminus contains the PCNA- and cyclin-interacting motifs, and deletion of both motifs simultaneously in the overexpressed Cdt1 prevents re-replication.

DNA replication is a complex process that a cell must perform accurately to ensure the genome is copied correctly with minimal damage. Additionally, replication must be temporally regulated so that the genome is copied exactly once before division. This ensures that daughter cells will not get undesirable amplifications or deletions that may cause abnormal functions, such as the unregulated growth observed in cancer. Work in the last decade has revealed an elaborate system to ensure that DNA replication occurs once, and only once, per cell cycle. This system of replication licensing relies on the sequential recruitment of replication initiation factors to chromatin at the appropriate time and prevents association at all other times. By controlling the chromatin association of these initiation factors, cells are able to limit precisely when replication can begin and prevent it otherwise. In higher eukaryotes, it is generally thought that the origin recognition complex recognizes origins of replication. The origin recognition complex serves as an origin marker and recruits Cdc6 and Cdt1 to chromatin. These proteins are then required to load the MCM2–7 complex. Once the MCM2–7 complex is loaded, downstream members of the preinitiation complex, including Cdc45/Sld3, GINS, MCM10, and Dpb11/Sld2, are loaded onto chromatin, eventually culminating in recruitment of the replication machinery. The recruitment of these factors is controlled by the presence or absence of cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 2The abbreviations used are:CDKcyclin-dependent kinasePCNAproliferating cell nuclear antigensiRNAsmall interfering RNAFACSfluorescence-activated cell sorterGFPgreen fluorescent proteinEGFPenhanced GFPCycyclinMNasemicrococcal nucleasePipes1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid. activity. CDK activity is low in G1, when the pre-replication complex (consisting of the origin recognition complex, Cdc6, Cdt1, and MCM2–7) is loaded. Increasing CDK activity is then required for further loading of the preinitiation complex members and the replication machinery (for review see Refs. 1Bell S.P. Dutta A. Annu. Rev.

It is loaded in a Cdc6- and Cdt1-dependent manner, and this loading can only occur during low levels of CDK activity, in late M phase and early G1 phase. Cdt1 has been shown to associate physically with MCM2–7 in many organisms (7Tanaka S. Diffley J.F. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 198-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 8Cook J.G. Park C.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 316-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), suggesting that it directly recruits MCM2–7 to chromatin. However, Cdc6 ATPase mutants increase association of Cdt1 and decrease association of MCM2–7 with chromatin, which might suggest mutual exclusion of Cdt1 and MCM2–7 on chromatin (7Tanaka S. Diffley J.F. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 198-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 11Randell J.C. Bowers J.L. Rodriguez H.K. Bell S.P. Mol. Cell. 2006; 21: 29-39Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Either way, it has been suggested that the interaction between Cdt1 and MCM2–7 is required to load the helicase on chromatin. Recent experiments in Xenopus egg extracts show that the C-terminal region of Cdt1 is required for MCM2–7 loading and that this region is also required for the interaction with MCMs (mini-chromosome maintenance) (10Ferenbach A. Li A. Brito-Martins M. Blow J.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 316-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The importance of the C-terminal one-third of Cdt1 is highlighted by the fact that this is the only area that shows sequence identity from Saccharomyces cerevisiae to humans (7Tanaka S. Diffley J.F. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 198-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 12Devault A. Vallen E.A. Yuan T. Green S. Bensimon A. Schwob E. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 689-694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Once MCM2–7 is loaded, its subsequent activation (and eventual origin firing) requires CDK and CDK-like activity (for review see Ref. 2Teer J.K. Dutta A. Results Probl. Cell Differ. 2006; 42: 31-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Therefore, MCM2–7 bridges the two CDK activity states that function to license replication: its chromatin loading must occur in low CDK activity, and its activation and origin firing must occur in high CDK activity. One of the key players in the replication licensing system is Cdt1. Cdt1 is required for MCM2–7 loading (7Tanaka S. Diffley J.F. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 198-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 13Maiorano D. Moreau J. Mechali M. Nature. 2000; 404: 622-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar, 14Nishitani H. Lygerou Z. Nishimoto T. Nurse P. Nature. 2000; 404: 625-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). MCM2–7 loading is limited to late M and early G1 phases in part due to inhibition of Cdt1 by several mechanisms in S-phase. Cdt1 is degraded in S-phase by two different mechanisms: CDK-dependent degradation by the SCF (Skp1/Cullin/F-box containing) complex and PCNA-dependent degradation by the Cul4-DDB1 complex (for review see Ref. 15Fujita M. Cell Div. 2006; 1: 22Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). It is also inhibited by geminin (16Wohlschlegel J.A. Dwyer B.T. Dhar S.K. Cvetic C. Walter J.C. Dutta A. Science. 2000; 290: 2309-2312Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar, 17Tada S. Li A. Maiorano D. Mechali M. Blow J.J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 107-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar), a small protein that occurs at high levels during S-phase. Disrupting these mechanisms of Cdt1 inhibition can cause re-replication in a variety of systems (18Vaziri C. Saxena S. Jeon Y. Lee C. Murata K. Machida Y. Wagle N. Hwang D.S. Dutta A. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 997-1008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar, 19Zhong W. Feng H. Santiago F.E. Kipreos E.T.

This suggests that when Cdt1 is not inhibited it can stimulate re-replication. Despite the expectation that inappropriate Cdt1 activity in S-phase may cause re-replication by excessive MCM2–7 reloading, the actual role of Cdt1 in re-replication induction is unclear. Recent work has shown that Cdt1 levels are increased in certain cancers (23Karakaidos P. Taraviras S. Vassiliou L.V. Zacharatos P. Kastrinakis N.G. Kougiou D. Kouloukoussa M. Nishitani H. Papavassiliou A.G. Lygerou Z. Gorgoulis V.G. Am. J. Pathol. 2004; 165: 1351-1365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Interestingly, in 73% of cases in which p53 was also mutated, aneuploidy was observed. Our laboratory has reported similar observations; in tumor cell lines lacking p53 and overexpressing Cdt1 and Cdc6, re-replication is observed (18Vaziri C. Saxena S. Jeon Y. Lee C. Murata K. Machida Y. Wagle N. Hwang D.S. Dutta A. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 997-1008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). Furthermore, high levels of Cdt1 appear to have a causative role in cancer. It has been shown that retrovirally activated Cdt1 can be oncogenic in mice (24Arentson E. Faloon P. Seo J. Moon E. Studts J.M. Fremont D.H. Choi K. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 1150-1158Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and that Cdt1 overexpression in thymocytes can cause lymphomas when p53 is also mutated. As Cdt1 overexpression causes re-replication in a variety of systems, it is possible that high levels of Cdt1 induce genomic instability and tumorigenesis by inducing re-replication. Therefore, an understanding of the mechanism of re-replication initiation is also informative for tumorigenesis and disease progression. Cell Culture—293T cells, human embryonic kidney cells transformed with adenovirus oncogenes E1a and E1b and with simian virus 40 oncogene T antigen, were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% iron-supplemented donor calf serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. Standard tissue culture growth conditions and methods were used. Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) was used to transfect cells. Cdt1 Mutant Construction—Cdt1 mutants were subcloned using PCR-based techniques in a vector with an N-terminal FLAG tag. Primer sequences used are available upon request. Because the natural nuclear localization sequence of Cdt1 is in the first 93 residues, the constructs lacking these N-terminal residues (94–X, 163–X) have an artificial nuclear localization sequence fused to the N terminus to ensure normal localization. Western Blotting, Immunoprecipitation, and siRNA—Western blotting was performed as described. In this case, cells were lysed in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 150 or 300 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm NaF, 0.2 mm Na3VO3, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and a 1:100 protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma). Equal amounts of protein were loaded on SDS-PAGE followed by transfer to nitrocellulose for standard Western blotting. FLAG and β-actin antibodies were purchased from Sigma, and MCM6 and cyclin A antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Anti-FLAG-agarose beads (Sigma) were used for Cdt1 co-immunoprecipitation. Geminin antibody was described previously (16Wohlschlegel J.A. Dwyer B.T. Dhar S.K. Cvetic C. Walter J.C. Dutta A. Science. 2000; 290: 2309-2312Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar). hsCdt1 antibody was described previously (25Senga T. Sivaprasad U. Zhu W. Park J.H. Arias E.E. Walter J.C. Dutta A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 6246-6252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). siRNA was performed according to common methods using RNAi MAX (Invitrogen). siRNA oligonucleotides against human geminin have been described previously (20Zhu W. Chen Y. Dutta A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 7140-7150Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). The Cdt1 siRNA sequence is 5′-GCAAUGUUGGCCAGAUCAA-3′. FACS—Cells were prepared as described previously (18Vaziri C. Saxena S. Jeon Y. Lee C. Murata K. Machida Y. Wagle N. Hwang D.S. Dutta A. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 997-1008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). Cells were cotransfected with farnesylated EGFP and gated for GFP-positive cells to ensure analysis was limited to the Cdt1-transfected cells. Alternately, cells were transiently transfected with a puromycin resistance marker, and 48 h of puromycin treatment was used to enrich transfected cells. The analysis was carried out on a BD Biosciences FACS Calibur using Cellquest and FloJo software. Chromatin Fractionation—Chromatin fractionation protocols used to observe MCM7 and Cdt1 chromatin loading were described previously (Refs. 26Todorov I.T. Attaran A. Kearsey S.E. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1433-1445Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar and 27Mendez J. Stillman B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8602-8612Crossref PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar, respectively). Briefly, the MCM7 chromatin loading was observed as follows. Cells (2 × 106) were lysed in 100 μl of CSK buffer (10 mm Pipes, pH 7.0, 100 mm NaCl, 300 mm sucrose, 3 mm MgCl2) containing 0.5% Triton X-100, 1 mm ATP, and 1 mm Na3VO4. Lysates were incubated on ice for 20 min and then centrifuged at 1500 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C. Supernatant (S1) was removed, and pellets were washed with 1 ml of lysis buffer and centrifuged again. Pellets were incubated in 100 μl of lysis buffer containing 1 mm CaCl2 and 120 units of micrococcal nuclease (Worthington) for 10 min at 37 °C and centrifuged. Supernatant (S2, chromatin-bound fraction) was removed, and pellets were washed with 1 ml of lysis buffer and centrifuged again. Pellets were boiled in 100 μl of 1× sample buffer (P2) (26Todorov I.T. Attaran A. Kearsey S.E. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1433-1445Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). The Cdt1 chromatin loading was determined as follows. Cells were resuspended (4 × 107 cells/ml) in Buffer A (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.34 m sucrose, 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, a 1:100 protease inhibitor mix (Sigma), 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). 0.1% Triton X-100 was added, and the cells were incubated for 5 min on ice. Nuclei were collected in pellet 1 (P1) by low-speed centrifugation (4 min, 1,300 × g, 4 °C). The supernatant (S1) was further clarified by high-speed centrifugation (15 min, 20,000 × g, 4 °C) to remove cell debris and insoluble aggregates. Nuclei were washed once in Buffer A and then lysed in Buffer B (3 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, protease inhibitors as described above). Insoluble chromatin was collected by centrifugation (4 min, 1,700 × g, 4 °C), washed once in Buffer B, and centrifuged again under the same conditions. The final chromatin pellet (P3) was resuspended in Laemmli buffer and sheared by passing it through a syringe. To release chromatin-bound proteins by nuclease treatment, cell nuclei (P1) were resuspended in Buffer A plus 1 mm CaCl2 and 0.2 unit of micrococcal nuclease (Sigma). After incubation at 37 °C for 2 min, the nuclease reaction was stopped by the addition of 1 mm EGTA. Nuclei were collected by low-speed centrifugation and lysed as above (27Mendez J. Stillman B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8602-8612Crossref PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar). Recent evidence has suggested that the C terminus of Xenopus and mouse Cdt1 interacts with the MCM2–7 complex. We first sought to confirm this result in human cells. A variety of truncations and internal deletions were made in the regions defined in mouse (9Yanagi K. Mizuno T. You Z. Hanaoka F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40871-40880Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) and Xenopus (10Ferenbach A. Li A. Brito-Martins M. Blow J.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 316-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) systems to be important for the interaction with MCM2–7. To determine the analogous amino acids in hsCdt1 (Homo sapiens) (546 amino acids), a multiple alignment was performed using ClustalW (28Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (55761) Google Scholar). In Xenopus egg extracts, xlCdt1Δ573–620 (X. laevis) did not bind MCM2–7. The analogous hsCdt1 residues (499–546) were therefore deleted. Yeast two-hybrid and in vitro pulldown experiments with mouse Cdt1 suggested that mmCdt1-(407–477) (Mus musculus) was important for direct interaction with mmMCM6. Interestingly, mmCdt1Δ520–577 (a deletion of the extreme C terminus) seemed to interact more strongly with mmMCM6, suggesting that this region may be inhibitory for MCM binding. We synthesized the analogous deletions of the internal required region and C-terminal inhibitory region in human Cdt1: hsCdt1Δ395–465 and hsCdt1Δ508–546. Additional internal deletions were also made based on a secondary structure prediction using the GOR4 algorithm (29Garnier J. Gibrat J.F. Robson B. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 266: 540-553Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The fourth-from-last helix (hsCdt1Δ444–465), the third-from-last helix (hsCdt1Δ495–505), and the final helix (hsCdt1Δ518–546) were each deleted. These mutations are summarized in Fig. 1. To test the interaction of these hsCdt1 deletions with MCM2–7, we overexpressed FLAG-tagged versions of the proteins in human 293T cells. hsCdt1 was then immunoprecipitated using an anti-FLAG antibody, and hsMCM6 levels were examined by Western blotting. Wild type hsCdt1 was able to pull down endogenous hsMCM6, reproducing earlier results in different systems from other laboratories (Fig. 2A). However, none of the deletion mutants pulled down detectable hsMCM6, indicating that a large portion of the C terminus of hsCdt1 is important for the interaction with hsMCM6. Both the wild type and deletion mutants of hsCdt1 were able to pull down geminin, indicating the proteins are likely to be folded correctly. Interestingly, both Δ499–546 and Δ508–546 did not interact with hsMCM6. In previous studies, the Δ499–546 Xenopus equivalent did not bind to MCM2–7 (10Ferenbach A. Li A. Brito-Martins M. Blow J.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 316-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), but the mouse Δ508–546 equivalent bound more strongly (9Yanagi K. Mizuno T. You Z. Hanaoka F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40871-40880Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), suggesting that the extreme C terminus of Cdt1 was inhibitory for MCM binding. Our data agrees with the Xenopus data, as the extreme C terminus appears to be required for MCM interaction. It is possible that the Cdt1-MCM6 interaction in mice is slightly different from that in other organisms. To eliminate the possibility that these deleted regions are also important for a non-MCM binding function of hsCdt1, we made three different sets of point mutants in full-length hsCdt1. These mutants are termed PEHL (P492T, E496A, H498A, L502A), RELAR (R453A, E456A, L457A, A458S, R459A), and RPLVF (R356K, P455H, L461E, V464A, F465A). Each set of point mutants was made in highly conserved residues in the regions deleted previously (see Fig. 1). FLAG-tagged versions of these point mutants were expressed in 293T cells and pulled down with anti-FLAG. Although wild type hsCdt1 interacted with hsMCM6, we did not observe an interaction between any of our point mutants and hsMCM6 (Fig. 2B), suggesting that these mutations interrupt the binding between the two proteins. Again, the hsCdt1 point mutants all bind to geminin. As only 4–5 amino acids have been changed in each mutant, the chance of disrupting another activity of Cdt1 in all three cases is decreased. We tested the re-replication initiation activity of these point mutants by overexpressing them in human 293T cells. Our laboratory has shown previously that by either overexpressing hsCdt1 (18Vaziri C. Saxena S. Jeon Y. Lee C. Murata K. Machida Y. Wagle N. Hwang D.S. Dutta A. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 997-1008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar) or relieving its inhibition via knockdown of geminin (20Zhu W. Chen Y. Dutta A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 7140-7150Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 30Machida Y.J. Dutta A. Genes Dev. 2007; 21: 184-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), re-replication can be induced in human cells. As expected, transient overexpression of wild type full-length hsCdt1 induced >4N DNA content as determined by FACS (Fig. 3A). In addition, overexpression of each of the MCM non-interacting point mutants also induces re-replication (Fig. 3A). The percentage of re-replicating cells after hsCdt1 point mutant overexpression is similar or higher than wild type hsCdt1 (quantitated in Fig. 3B). This result is very surprising, as these point mutants of hsCdt1 do not appear to interact with hsMCM6. This suggests that although Cdt1 is required for MCM2–7 loading onto chromatin, the interaction between these proteins is not required for re-replication induction. Because the MCM non-interacting point mutants of Cdt1 were able to induce re-replication, we examined the ability of C-terminal deletion mutants to do the same. In previous Xenopus experiments, a C-terminal truncation neither interacted with MCM2–7 nor functioned in replication licensing. The analogous human mutant, residues 1–498, as well as two mutants with larger C-terminal deletions, residues 1–389 and 1–370, was tested for its ability to induce re-replication. Again, surprisingly, these MCM non-interacting mutants caused re-replication (Fig. 3, C and D). This further supports the notion that direct interaction between the overexpressed Cdt1 and MCM2–7 is not required for re-replication. Additionally, these results indicate that the entire C-terminal region, although the only part conserved from S. cerevisiae to humans, is not required to induce re-replication, suggesting that re-replication may not depend on the normal licensing role of Cdt1. One possible explanation for the induction of re-replication by MCM non-interacting point mutants of Cdt1 is that the overexpressed Cdt1 is simply titrating geminin away from endogenous Cdt1, thereby activating it. We addressed this possibility by overexpressing the central domain of Cdt1 that contains a geminin-interacting region: hsCdt1-(163–370). This FLAG-tagged fragment is able to pull down equal amounts of geminin compared with wild type and point mutant hsCdt1, indicating it is able to titrate geminin just as efficiently (Fig. 4A). However, this fragment is not able to induce re-replication compared with wild type hsCdt1 (Fig. 4B); to ensure proper localization, this fragment and others with large N-terminal deletions have an artificial nuclear localization sequence added to the N terminus. This leads us to believe that the re-replication stimulation observed after overexpression of hsCdt1 is not due to geminin titration. To further demonstrate that Cdt1 overexpression does not simply titrate geminin away from endogenous Cdt1, siRNA was used to knock down geminin followed by Cdt1 overexpression. Although re-replication is induced after geminin siRNA in some cell lines (20Zhu W. Chen Y. Dutta A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 7140-7150Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 31Zhu W. Dutta A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 4601-4611Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), we did not observe significant re-replication after geminin siRNA in 293T cells (Fig. 4, C and D, FLAG lanes). Taken on its own, this observation suggests that geminin depletion from endogenous Cdt1 is not sufficient to induce re-replication in this cell line. Wild type Cdt1 was also overexpressed in control or geminin siRNA-treated cells. Geminin depletion in Cdt1-overexpressing cells had very little effect on the percentage of re-replicating cells. (Fig. 4, C and D) Thus, Cdt1 overexpression induces re-replication by a mechanism other than titration of geminin. It is possible that overexpressed Cdt1 may titrate another inhibitor of re-replication. CDK activity is also important for inhibition of re-replication as has been demonstrated recently (30Machida Y.J. Dutta A. Genes Dev. 2007; 21: 184-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). As Cdt1 contains a cyclin (Cy) binding motif that is required for interaction with cyclins, titration of cyclins from endogenous targets (including endogenous Cdt1) could cause re-replication. To test this, we deleted the Cy motif in both full-length Cdt1 and Cdt1-(1–370) (Fig. 4, E and F). Although the ΔCy mutants do not interact with cyclin A (Fig. 4G) (32Sugimoto N. Tatsumi Y. Tsurumi T. Matsukage A. Kiyono T. Nishitani H. Fujita M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 19691-19697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), they are still able to induce re-replication, suggesting that titration of cyclins is not required for the observed re-replication following Cdt1 overexpression. It is also interesting to note that although the 163–370 fragment of Cdt1 did not induce re-replication, the 1–370 fragment did. This indicates that a critical function of the N terminus of Cdt1 is required for re-replication. To further examine this phenomenon, we overexpressed the 163–546 fragment, in which only the N terminus is deleted. Surprisingly, we found that this fragment induced an S-phase arrest (Fig. 5, A and B). A slightly shorter N-terminal truncation, fragment 94–546, also induced an S-phase arrest. Interestingly, if we disrupted MCM binding by overexpressing a Cdt1 mutant lacking the N terminus and lacking the C terminus or having C-terminal point mutations, the S-phase arrest was lost, and cells behaved like the control FLAG transfection (Fig. 5, A and B). This indicates not only that the N terminus has functions important for normal activity of Cdt1 but also that the cell cycle is inhibited when this fragment is absent. The cell cycle inhibition can be rescued when MCM interaction is disrupted, suggesting that N-terminally deleted Cdt1 inhibits the cell cycle by stably associating with and perturbing the normal function of MCM2–7. As the Cdt1 N terminus seemed to be required for induction of re-replication, we wondered whether the N terminus was sufficient for re-replication. Cdt1-(1–163) was overexpressed and was able to induce re-replication nearly as well as full-length Cdt1 (Fig. 5, C and D). This result suggests that the N terminus is sufficient for re-replication induction and strongly suggests that re-replication stimulation does not occur via the normal function of Cdt1. However, the N terminus does contain both motifs required for Cdt1 degradation. We have shown that removal of the Cy motif (required for CDK/SCF-mediated destruction of Cdt1) did not affect re-replication. It is possible that the N terminus is titrating away factors required for the PCNA/CUL4/DDB1-mediated degradation of Cdt1."
https://openalex.org/W2079004081,"The crystal structures of N-acetylglutamate synthase (NAGS) in the arginine biosynthetic pathway of Neisseria gonorrhoeae complexed with acetyl-CoA and with CoA plus N-acetylglutamate have been determined at 2.5- and 2.6-A resolution, respectively. The monomer consists of two separately folded domains, an amino acid kinase (AAK) domain and an N-acetyltransferase (NAT) domain connected through a 10-A linker. The monomers assemble into a hexameric ring that consists of a trimer of dimers with 32-point symmetry, inner and outer ring diameters of 20 and 100A, respectively, and a height of 110A(.) Each AAK domain interacts with the cognate domains of two adjacent monomers across two 2-fold symmetry axes and with the NAT domain from a second monomer of the adjacent dimer in the ring. The catalytic sites are located within the NAT domains. Three active site residues, Arg316, Arg425, and Ser427, anchor N-acetylglutamate in a position at the active site to form hydrogen bond interactions to the main chain nitrogen atoms of Cys356 and Leu314, and hydrophobic interactions to the side chains of Leu313 and Leu314. The mode of binding of acetyl-CoA and CoA is similar to other NAT family proteins. The AAK domain, although catalytically inactive, appears to bind arginine. This is the first reported crystal structure of any NAGS, and it provides insights into the catalytic function and arginine regulation of NAGS enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W1973952654,"In the human adrenal cortex, the peptide hormone adrenocorticotropin (ACTH) directs cortisol and adrenal androgen biosynthesis by activating a cAMP/cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) pathway. Carboxyl-terminal binding protein 1 (CtBP1) is a corepressor that regulates transcription of the CYP17 gene by periodically interacting with steroidogenic factor-1 in response to ACTH signaling. Given that CtBP1 function is regulated by NADH binding, we hypothesized that ACTH-stimulated changes in cellular pyridine nucleotide concentrations modulate the ability of CtBP1 to repress CYP17 transcription. Further, we postulated that PKA evokes changes in the phosphorylation status of CtBP1 that control the ability of the protein to bind to steroidogenic factor-1 and the coactivator GCN5 (general control nonderepressed 5) and repress CYP17 gene expression. We show that ACTH alters pyridine nucleotide redox state and identify amino acid residues in CtBP1 that are targeted by PKA and PAK6. Both ACTH/cAMP signaling and NADH/NAD+ ratio stimulate nuclear-cytoplasmic oscillation of both CtBP proteins. We provide evidence that PKA 1) induces metabolic changes in the adrenal cortex and 2) phosphorylates CtBP proteins, particularly CtBP1 at T144, resulting in CtBP protein partnering and ACTH-dependent CYP17 transcription."

Higher plant cells differ fundamentally from animal or lower plant cells in that they lack the typical centrosomes, basal bodies, and spindle pole bodies that contain the materials to act as MTOCs. Nevertheless, in the cells of higher plants, dynamic changes in the microtubule (MT) structures still occur throughout the cell cycle, and MTOCs could still play important roles in the cell, determining suitable positions and polarities for MT arrays and regulating the dissolution of MTs. Higher plant cells might possess a different type of MTOC whose nature depends on the structural type of the MT (1Wasteneys G.O. Zhenbiao Y. Plant Physiol. 2004; 136: 3884-3891Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), such as cortical, preprophase band, spindle, and phragmoplast. These structural differences might be correlated with the specific functions of the plant MTs, including participation in the regulation of new cellulose microfibril orientation (cortical MTs) (2Ledbetter M.C.

Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 116-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) demonstrated by electron microscopy that MTs are connected to the nuclear envelope in Hemanthus endosperm cells and suggested that the site of MT nucleation is associated with the nuclear envelope. It has been argued that the nuclear envelope offers an MTOC for interphase radial MTs, preprophase band MTs, and spindle MTs (11Clayton L. Black C.M. Lloyd C.W. J.

Some biochemical approaches have provided limited evidence of the potential role of protein factor(s) as candidates for MT-organizing particles (MTOPs) on nuclei. Isolated nuclei and their fragmented particles from cultured tobacco BY-2 cells were shown to have the ability to nucleate MTs (15Mizuno K. Protoplasma. 1993; 173: 77-85Crossref Scopus (58) Google Scholar). A similar result was obtained using nuclei from cultured maize cells (16Stoppin-M V. Vantard M. Schmit A.C. Lambert A.M. Plant Cell. 1994; 6: 1099-1106Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and from other plant cells (17Schmit A.C. Int. Rev. Cytol. 2002; 220: 257-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 18Schmit A.C.

Oakley B.R. Cell. 1991; 65: 817-823Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar) and the spindle pole body of fungi (25Oakley B.R. Oakley C.E. Yoon Y. Jung M.K.

Cell Sci. 1991; 99: 693-700Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), is also an important candidate for MTOC in higher plant cells. However, because higher plant cells lack a centrosome and spindle pole body, the localization and function of γ-tubulin in these cells is still unclear. Antibodies raised against γ-tubulin revealed its characteristic localization along cortical MTs in a cell cycle-dependent manner (27Liu B. Marc J. Joshi H.C. Palevitz B.A. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 104: 1217-1228Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The same authors also identified several γ-tubulin genes, including two γ-tubulin genes of Arabidopsis, which showed 70% amino acid identity with the γ-tubulins of animal and fungi (28Liu B. Joshi H.C. Wilson T.J. Silflow C.D. Palevitz B.A. Snustad D.P. Plant Cell. 1994; 6: 303-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). γ-Tubulin was hypothesized to be engaged in the organization of cortical MTs located just inside the plasma membrane (27Liu B. Marc J. Joshi H.C. Palevitz B.A. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 104: 1217-1228Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Murata T. Sonobe S. Baskin T.I. Hyodo S. Hasezawa S. Nagata T. Horio T. Hasebe M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 961-968Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Our immunofluorescence observation of cultured tobacco BY-2 cells using antibodies raised against tubulin revealed that more than half of the cells cultured for 5 days had nuclei with radially assembled MTs as shown in Fig. 1. This result prompted the need to identify the active protein factor(s) responsible for the assembly of radial MTs around the nucleus. In the present report, we describe a protein of ∼38-kDa that has the ability to form aster-like structures in a characteristic manner when it is incubated with tubulin. We regard this active protein to be a constituent of the MTOPs of the nuclear surface in higher plants. Preparation of Nuclei—Tobacco BY-2 cells were cultured at 27 °C in the dark with shaking in Linsmaier and Skoog medium and subcultured at intervals of 7 days. Cells cultured for 5 days were treated with a wall lysis medium to produce protoplasts. The lysis medium consisted of a 0.45 m solution of mannitol (pH 5.5) that contained 1% Cellulase Onozuka RS (Yakult Honsya, Tokyo, Japan) and 0.1% Pectolyase Y23 (Kikkoman Seisin, Tokyo, Japan). After incubation for 1.5 h at 27 °C, the protoplasts were sedimented by centrifugation for 5 min at 500 × g and washed twice with 0.45 m mannitol. The protoplasts were suspended in chilled buffer A (10 mm MES, 0.25 m sucrose, 10 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.15 mm spermine, 0.5 mm spermidine, 20 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.1 mm p-ABSF, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, pH 6.0), with or without Nonidet P-40 at the concentration of 0.5% to lyse the plasma membrane. We tried various concentrations of Nonidet P-40 from 0.1 to 0.5% and found that almost pure nuclei were obtained at 0.5%, and at any concentration similar activity to generate radial MTs was retained. Therefore, we employed 0.5% Nonidet P-40 for the lysis of plasma membrane of protoplasts. The nuclei were released from the protoplasts after two strokes of the mortar of a Teflon glass homogenizer. They were then precipitated by centrifugation for 5 min at 1500 × g at 4 °C. The precipitated nuclei-rich fractions were suspended in buffer A and laid on the top of a sucrose density gradient consisted of 50% (w/w) (layer 1) and 80% (layer 2) sucrose. During centrifugation at 2500 × g at 4 °C for 45 min, the nuclei were concentrated at the interface between the two layers. The concentrated nuclei were collected with a Pasteur pipette. The collected nuclear fraction was diluted with three volumes of buffer A, and then the nuclei were sedimented by centrifugation for 5 min at 1500 × g at 4 °C. Preparation of MAP-Free Tubulin and Labeling with Rhodamine and Fluorescein Isothiocyanate (FITC)—Tubulin from porcine brain was isolated with buffer B (PIPES, 1 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm MgSO4, pH 6.9) by two cycles of temperature-dependent polymerization and depolymerization in the presence of 1 mm GTP according to Shelanski et al. (30Shelanski M.L. Gaskin F. Cantor C.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1973; 70: 765-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (1975) Google Scholar). Then the tubulin was purified by column chromatography on DEAE-Sephacel. After being washed with modified buffer B (10 mm PIPES, 1 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm MgSO4) containing 0.3 m NaCl, the tubulin was eluted from the column with above modified buffer B containing 0.8 m NaCl. The eluate was dialyzed overnight against buffer C (100 mm PIPES, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EGTA, 33% glycerol, 0.1 mm GTP, 0.5 mm MgSO4, and 80 mm NaCl, pH 6.9) at 4 °C. Then, after the addition of GTP to 1 mm, the cycle of temperature-dependent polymerization and depolymerization was repeated twice. The resulting MAP-free tubulin preparation was stored in liquid nitrogen. Rhodamine-labeled tubulin was prepared according to Hyman et al. (31Hyman A.A. Dreschel D. Kellogg D. Salser S. Sawin K. Steffen P. Wordeman L. Schley J.M. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 196: 478-485Crossref Scopus (575) Google Scholar). After polymerization of MAP-free tubulin in buffer C, the preparation was laid on buffer C containing 60% glycerol (instead of 33%) as a cushion and centrifuged for 30 min at 154,000 × g at 36 °C. The precipitated MTs were suspended to a concentration of 50 mg/ml in a PIPES buffer similar to buffer C, except with pH 8.0. Carboxytetramethylrhodamine succinimidyl ester (Molecular Probes Inc. Eugene, OR) was dissolved in Me2SO at 100 mm and then added to 1/20 volume of the MT preparation under vortexing. After 10 min, the reaction mixture was laid on the cushion buffer with 60% glycerol and centrifuged for 30 min at 154,000 × g. The resulting precipitate of MTs was depolymerized at 0 °C after suspension in buffer C. The rhodamine-labeled tubulin was purified further by two cycles of temperature-dependent polymerization and depolymerization and then stored in liquid nitrogen. FITC-labeled tubulin was prepared by a procedure similar to that used for the preparation of rhodamine-labeled tubulin, with the substitution of FITC. Because of the low tubulin content in plant cells, the usage of plant tubulin in this investigation was limited; therefore, we employed tubulin from porcine brain, mainly. To confirm the identical property of plant tubulin with animal tubulin, we also conducted the isolation of plant tubulin. Tubulin from tobacco cells was prepared by the method of Mizuno et al. (32Mizuno K. Koyama M. Shibaoka H. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1981; 89: 329-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Five hundred grams of suspension-cultured tobacco cells was extracted in 1000 ml of extraction buffer D (50 mm MES, 0.5 mm MgSO4, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mm p-ABSF, 25 μg/ml leupeptin, 25 μg/ml pepstatin A, pH 6.5) with an ultrasonic disruptor (model UD-201; Tomy Seiko Co. Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). The homogenate was centrifuged for 1 h at 100,000 × g at 4 °C. From the supernatant, tubulin was isolated and purified by affinity chromatography on ethyl N-phenylcarbamate-Sepharose and ion exchange resin chromatography on DEAE-Sephacel (GE Healthcare). Isolated plant tubulin was conjugated with carboxytetramethyl-rhodamine succinimidyl ester (Molecular Probes Inc.) as above and introduced under “Assay for MTOC” as porcine brain tubulin as follows. Assay for MTOC—To detect MT organizing activity, a mixture of rhodamine-labeled tubulin and unlabeled tubulin (ratio 1:4), at the total concentration of 0.4 mg/ml, which is known never to induce spontaneous polymerization, was added to the preparation of isolated nuclei, the solubilized protein preparation from the nuclei, or the recombinant protein preparation. After incubation in buffer B with 1 mm GTP and 10% Me2SO at 27 °C for 30 min, the reaction mixture was observed under Fluoview laser confocal microscope (Olympus Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) to detect the formation of radial MTs from the surface of nuclei and the formation of “aster-like structures” or their clusters. Preparation and Sources of Antibodies—A protein band corresponding to an active protein with an apparent molecular mass of 38 kDa by SDS-PAGE was cut after brief staining with an aqueous solution of Coomassie Brilliant Blue and then homogenized in liquid nitrogen. A rabbit was immunized three times with a mixture of Gerbu adjuvant 100 (Gerbu Biotechnik GmbH, Gaiberg, Germany) and gel homogenate that contained ∼80 μg of the 38-kDa protein for 4-week interval each. Serum was obtained from blood and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. From the supernatants, the IgG fraction was purified using protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) and used for immunoblotting analysis and indirect immunofluorescent studies. Monoclonal antibodies against α- and β-tubulin were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Monoclonal antibody against the sea urchin centrosomal 51-kDa protein was a kind gift of Prof. Hasezawa, S. (Graduate School of Biological Science, Tokyo University), and the monoclonal antibody raised against the N-terminal region (from the N terminus to the amino acid residue 111) of γ-tubulin from Aspergillus nidulans was provided by Dr. T. Horio (School of Medicine, The University of Tokushima, Tokushima, Japan). Extraction of Histones, Two-dimensional Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis—Histones were extracted with 0.4 n H2SO4 from isolated nuclei or whole cells cultured for 5 days. After centrifugation of the mixture at 10,000 × g for 15 min, the proteins in the supernatant were precipitated with 20% trichloroacetic acid by centrifugation at 10,000 × g. The resulting precipitate was washed by suspending in cold acetone to remove trichloroacetic acid and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 5 min. The protein precipitate was washed repeatedly until the entire removal of trichloroacetic acid from preparation monitoring by pH test paper after dissolving in small volume of water. The proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE or two-dimensional PAGE. The first dimension electrophoresis was performed in an acetic acid-urea-Triton gel that contained 15% acrylamide, 1 n acetic acid, 8 m urea, and 0.5% (w/w) Triton X-100. The second was performed in a 12.5% acrylamide gel that contained SDS. After electrophoresis, the gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. Immunoblotting Analysis—After electrophoresis on SDS-PAGE on a 12.5% gel by the procedure of Laemmli (33Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207211) Google Scholar) or two-dimensional PAGE on acetic acid-urea-Triton X-100/SDS, the proteins were transferred onto a nitrocellulose filter. Each nitrocellulose filter was then incubated in 1% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4) for 1 h at 36 °C. Separate filters were then incubated with mouse monoclonal antibody or rabbit polyclonal antibodies for 1 h at 36 °C and then washed five times, for 5 min each time, with PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 (PBS-T). Peroxidase-conjugated antibodies raised in goats against mouse IgG (H+L) (Bio-Rad) or against rabbit IgG (H+L) (Bio-Rad) were diluted 1:1000 in 1% bovine serum albumin/PBS and incubated with the appropriate nitrocellulose filters for 1 h at 36 °C. After five washes with PBS-T, the protein bands were visualized by incubation of the nitrocellulose filters with the peroxidase substrate 4-chloro-1-naphthol (0.05%) and hydrogen peroxide (0.03%). Indirect Immunofluorescence Studies—Tobacco BY-2 cells cultured for 5 days were fixed at room temperature for 1 h with 3.7% formaldehyde in 50 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.5), which contained 3 mm EGTA and 5 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The cells were treated for 10 min with a mixture of 1% Cellulase Onozuka RS and 0.1% Pectolyase Y-23 in 0.45 m mannitol to render the cell wall permeable to antibodies. After being washed in 0.1% Nonidet P-40 for 15 min, the cells were incubated with 1% bovine serum albumin for 15 min and then dispersed on a glass slide that had previously been coated with polylysine. A mixture of monoclonal antibody raised against α-tubulin from chick brain (at a dilution of 1:500; Amersham Biosciences) and rabbit antibodies raised against the 38-kDa protein from the nuclei of tobacco BY-2 cells (at a dilution of 1:500) was applied for 1 h at 36 °Cfor indirect immunofluorescence double-staining of cells. A mixture of FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (H+L) (at a dilution of 1:1000, Organon Teknika, West Chester, PA) and rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (H+L) (at a dilution of 1:1000, Organon Teknika) was then applied to well washed cells, and the cells were incubated for 1 h at 36 °C. Finally, 0.2 μg/ml of 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) was applied for the observation of DNA. For the determination of 38-kDa protein in aster-like structures, the fixed preparation was applied on polylysine-coated coverslips and was treated with a mixture of monoclonal antibody raised against α-tubulin from chick brain (at a dilution of 1:500; Amersham Biosciences) and rabbit antibodies raised against the 38-kDa protein from the nuclei of tobacco BY-2 cells (at a dilution of 1:500) as above. However, as a second antibodies, a mixture of Texas Red-conjugated sheep anti-mouse IgG (H+L) (at a dilution of 1:1000, GE Healthcare) and FITC-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (H+L) (at a dilution of 1:1000, Organon Teknika) was applied and incubated for 1 h at 36 °C. The nuclei were isolated from synchronized S/G2 phase tobacco BY-2 cells as described in a previous report (35Hotta T. Haraguchi T. Mizuno K. Cell Struct. Funct. 2007; 32: 79-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) in the presence of 0.5% Nonidet P-40. The isolated nuclei were fixed in 0.01% glutaraldehyde in acetone-methanol (1:1, v/v) at -20 °C for 1 h and were then rehydrated in 50 mm PIPES buffer, pH 6.9, and attached to a polylysine-coated coverslip. After being washed and blocked with 5% skim milk in 50 mm PIPES buffer (pH 6.9) for 1 h, the nuclei were incubated with affinity-purified polyclonal antibody against tobacco histone H1 (1:250 to 1:500) for 1 h, then washed, and incubated for 1 h with rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:350; Molecular Probes), and finally they were treated for 5 min with a 0.2 μg/ml solution of DAPI. The preparations were observed after being embedded in a glycerol solution containing 0.01% n-propyl gallate under a Delta Vision System (Applied Precision, Mercer Island, WA) or Fluoview laser confocal microscope. Determination of Partial Amino Acid Sequence of 38-kDa Protein—The purified 38-kDa protein was transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane filter (Bio-Rad) after separation by SDS-PAGE. After brief staining with 0.1% Ponceau S, the band corresponding to the 38-kDa protein was cut, and peptide fragmentation was performed according to the method of Iwamatsu (34Iwamatsu A. Seikagaku. 1991; 63: 139-143PubMed Google Scholar) by digestion with Achromobacter Protease I (Wako Fine Chemicals, Tokyo, Japan). Each peptide fragment was separated by liquid chromatography on a C18 column (ODS Column; Wako), and the amino acid sequence of the N terminus then was analyzed by protein sequencer (model 473A; Applied Biosystems). Sequence Analysis of cDNA—Poly(A)+ RNA was isolated from tobacco BY-2 cells with RNA extraction kits and mRNA purification kits (GE Healthcare). A Lambda-ZAP II (Stratagene) cDNA library was constructed from the poly(A)+ RNA. The library of 9 × 105 plaques was screened by the rabbit antibodies raised against the 38-kDa protein, using a picoBlue immunoscreening Kit (Stratagene). DNA sequencing was performed with a Thermo sequenase primer cycle sequencing kit (GE Healthcare) and a model LIC-4200L DNA sequencer (Li-Cor, Lincoln, NE). Expression of Recombinant 38-kDa Protein in Escherichia coli— The 38-kDa protein was expressed as a fusion protein using the pET-32 vector (Novagen, Madison, WI), which provides an N-terminal TRX and His tag. Genes encoding the 38-kDa protein were amplified by reverse transcription-PCR for poly(A)+ RNA isolated from tobacco as above. The PCR primers GAGATGGCGACTGAAGAACCA and TTACTTCCTCCCCTTTCTAGC were used. After the PCR product had been subcloned, it was cloned into pET32 vector and the transformation of E. coli cells was performed. After the cells had grown to an A600 nm of 0.6, they were induced by the addition of isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside to 1.5 mm and then further cultured for 4 h at 37 °C. The cells were then precipitated by centrifugation for 5 min at 10,000 × g and extracted with lysis buffer (8 m urea, 0.1 m sodium phosphate, 0.01 m Tris-HCl, 0.05% Tween 20, pH 8.0). After each sample had been centrifuged for 10 min at 15,000 × g, the supernatant was mixed with ⅕ volume of a 50% slurry of Ni-NTA resin (Qiagen) and stirred at room temperature for 45 min before being loaded into a column. The column was washed with 10 volumes of lysis buffer and then with 10 volumes of washing buffer (lysis buffer adjusted to pH 6.3 with 1 n HCl). Fusion protein was eluted with elution buffer (lysis buffer adjusted to pH 4.5 with 1 n HCl) and then dialyzed against 50 mm PIPES buffer (pH 6.9) to exclude urea. The dialyzed preparation of recombinant 38-kDa protein was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C to remove aggregations, and then its ability to form aster-like structures was determined as noted under “Assay for MTOC.” Microtubules Protruding from the Surfaces of Isolated Nuclei or Nuclear Fragments—More than 50% of the tobacco BY-2 cells cultured for 5 days contained nuclei with surface-associated radial MTs extending to the cell periphery (radial MTs) (Fig. 1A). When nuclei isolated in the presence of 0.5% Nonidet P-40 from the protoplasts of tobacco BY-2 cells cultured for 5 days were incubated with MAP-free tubulin in polymerization buffer (buffer B with 1 mm GTP and 10% Me2SO, pH 6.9) at 27 °C for 30 min, radial MT assembly occurred on the surfaces of the nuclei (Fig. 1, B and C) at a tubulin concentration of 0.4 mg/ml, which is below the critical tubulin concentration (∼1 mg/ml) for spontaneous assembly. When nuclei prepared in the same way but in the absence of Nonidet P-40 were incubated with tubulin, lateral MTs were generated some times in addition to the radial MTs around the nuclei (Fig. 1D). This result indicates the possible adsorption of factor(s) that attach the MTs laterally to the surfaces of those nuclei that were isolated without detergent. In contrast, with the addition of 0.5% Nonidet P-40, these factor(s) might be removed from the surfaces of the nuclei, causing the nuclei to generate only radial MTs. Therefore, we used Nonidet P-40 at a concentration of 0.5% to detect factor(s) to act only on the formation of radial MTs. In addition to nuclei that possessed radially generated MTs around their surfaces, we often observed aster-like structures when isolated nuclei were incubated with rhodamine-conjugated tubulin in polymerization buffer B with 1 mm GTP and 10% Me2SO. During incubation, some factor(s) responsible for the function of MTOPs on the surfaces of nuclei might be released. Purification of the Protein Factor Forming Aster-like Structures—Homogenization of the isolated nuclei in a glass homogenizer with the low-ionic-strength buffer E (10 mm PIPES, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 25 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.1 mm p-ABSF, 1 μm pepstatin A, pH 6.9) at 4 °C did not release any active factors for the formation of aster-like structures from the nuclear material into the soluble fraction after centrifugation at 10,000 × g. Moreover, when the resulting precipitate was extracted with buffer E with 1% detergent, such as Triton X-100, Nonidet P-40, or CHAPS, no detectable activity in forming aster-like structures was found in the soluble fraction. The resulting insoluble nuclear material then was dispersed in buffer E with 0.5 m NaCl (salt buffer) and extracted again in a glass homogenizer. The activity to form aster-like structures was detected mostly in the supernatant fraction after centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C (Fig. 2A). Because the activity was retained in the soluble supernatant fraction even after heat treatment in boiled water for 5 min, this simple procedure was most effective for the purification (Fig. 2A, lane 8). The heat-treated protein factor in salt buffer then was applied to a gel filtration column Sephadex G-200, (GE Healthcare) (1.6 × 65 cm) that had been equilibrate"
https://openalex.org/W2032959153,"The diacylglycerol (DG)/phorbol ester-dependent translocation of conventional protein kinase C (PKC) isozymes is mediated by the C1 domain, a membrane-targeting module that also selectively binds phosphatidylserine (PS). Using stopped-flow spectroscopy, we dissect the contribution of DG/phorbol esters (C1 ligand) and PS in driving the association and dissociation of the C1 domain from membranes. Specifically, we examine the binding to membranes of the C1B domain of PKCβ with a substituted Trp (Y123W) whose fluorescence is quenched upon binding to membranes. Binding of this construct (C1Bβ-Y123W) to phospholipid vesicles is cooperative with respect to PS content and dependent on C1 ligand, as previously characterized. Stopped-flow analysis reveals that the apparent association rate (konapp), but not the apparent dissociation rate (koffapp), is highly sensitive to PS content: the 60-fold increase in membrane affinity for vesicles containing no PS compared with 40 mol % PS results primarily from a robust (30-fold) increase in konapp with little effect (2-fold) on koffapp. Membrane affinity is also controlled by the content and structure of the C1 ligand. In contrast to PS, these ligands markedly alter koffapp with smaller effects on konapp. We also show that the affinity for phorbol ester-containing membranes is 2 orders of magnitude higher than that for DG-containing membranes primarily resulting from differences in koffapp. Our data are consistent with a model in which the C1 domain is recruited to the membrane via an initial weak electrostatic interaction with PS, followed by a rapid two-dimensional search for ligand, the binding of which retains the domain at the membrane. Thus, PS drives the initial encounter, and DG/phorbol esters retain the domain on membranes. The decreased effectiveness of DG compared with phorbol esters in retaining the C1 domain on membranes contributes to the molecular dichotomy of the rapid, transient nature of DG-dependent PKC signaling versus the chronic hyperactivity of phorbol ester-activated PKC.

Whereas PKC may be constitutively activated through proteolysis, the principal mechanism for the activation of the conventional (α, the alternatively spliced βI and βII, γ) and novel (δ, ϵ, θ, η) PKC isozymes is via translocation of PKC to the membrane; this translocation is driven by the C1 domain of these PKC isozymes, which binds diacylglycerol (DG) or the functional analogues, phorbol esters (3Newton A.C. Chem. Rev. 2001; 101: 2353-2364Crossref PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar). The intrinsic membrane affinity of the C1 domain of conventional PKC isozymes is 2 orders of magnitude lower than that of the novel PKC isozymes (4Dries D.R. Gallegos L.L. Newton A.C. J. Biol.

Newton A.C. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 13216-13229Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). For novel PKC isozymes, the affinity of their C1 domain is sufficiently high that agonist-evoked changes in diacylglycerol are sufficient to recruit novel PKCs to the membrane. Engaging the C1 domain (and C2 domain for conventional PKCs) provides the energy needed to release an autoinhibitory pseudosubstrate sequence from the active site, thereby allowing phosphorylation of substrates. Imaging of PKC activity and DG production in real time in live cells with FRET-based reporters has revealed that PKC activity is localized to those cellular locations where DG is generated (7Gallegos L.L.

The C1 domain is a small (∼8 kDa) globular domain, rich in β-sheet and requiring two Zn+2 ions for proper folding and stability. The DG/phorbol ester-binding site is formed by an “unzipped” β-sheet that is lined with hydrophobic residues. Crystallographic data revealed that binding to phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) is mediated through the backbone amides and carbonyls of Thr12, Leu21, and Gly23 (consensus residue numbering), rather than specific contacts with amino acid side chains; however, hydrophobic contacts between phorbol and the C1 domain reinforce the high affinity binding. This study also revealed that rather than alter the structure of the C1 domain, phorbol provides a greasy cap to facilitate binding of the domain to membranes. Moreover, despite being largely hydrophobic, the C1 domain has a ring of basic residues around its center, which may facilitate its interaction with anionic membranes (9Hurley J.H. Misra S. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2000; 29: 49-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 10Zhang G. Kazanietz M.G. Blumberg P.M. Hurley J.H. Cell. 1995; 81: 917-924Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar). The anionic phospholipid phosphatidylserine (PS) is a specific activator of PKC, with Hill coefficients as high as 12 noted for the activation of full-length enzyme in a mixed-micelle assay or 4 with lipid bilayers (11Newton A.C.

Binding studies have revealed that the enzyme specifically binds and is activated by sn-1,2-phosphatidyl-l-serine and not the enantiomeric sn-2,3-phosphatidyl-d-serine, suggesting the existence of specific determinants on the enzyme that bind PS (16Johnson J.E. Zimmerman M.L. Daleke D.L. Newton A.C. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 12020-12025Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). This stereospecificity is retained in the isolated C1 domain, suggesting that PS binds specifically to this domain (17Johnson J.E. Giorgione J. Newton A.C. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11360-11369Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The C2 domain also displays selectivity for PS over other anionic phospholipids (18Bittova L. Stahelin R.V. Cho W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4218-4226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 19Corbalan-Garcia S. Gomez-Fernandez J.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1761: 633-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), but, in contrast to the C1 domain, this selectivity is not stereospecific (17Johnson J.E. Giorgione J. Newton A.C. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11360-11369Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Phorbol esters have long been known to be potent activators of PKC (20Colon-Gonzalez F. Kazanietz M.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1761: 827-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). PMA binds to the C1 domain in a similar qualitative manner to DG (21Sharkey N.A. Leach K.L. Blumberg P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 607-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar), however, PKC binds to PMA-containing membranes with 2 orders of magnitude higher affinity than to DG-containing membranes (5Giorgione J.R. Lin J.H. McCammon J.A. Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 1660-1669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The lower affinity binding to DG allows agonist-stimulated PKC signaling to be rapidly reversed (22Codazzi F. Teruel M.N. Meyer T. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1089-1097Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), whereas phorbol ester treatment results in chronic activation (23Koivunen J. Aaltonen V. Peltonen J. Cancer Lett. 2006; 235: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar), which, dependent on the PKC isoform activated, may lead to either cancer or growth inhibition and apoptosis (24Griner E.M. Kazanietz M.G. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2007; 7: 281-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (759) Google Scholar). Equilibrium or monolayer penetration experiments have provided much information on how binding of C1 ligands recruits PKC to membranes (18Bittova L. Stahelin R.V. Cho W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4218-4226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 25Stahelin R.V. Digman M.A. Medkova M. Ananthanarayanan B. Rafter J.D. Melowic H.R. Cho W. J. Biol.

Struct. 2005; 34: 119-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). Moreover, early studies described a qualitative difference in the binding affinities and activation potencies between DG and a variety of phorbol esters (27Kazanietz M.G. Krausz K.W. Blumberg P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20878-20886Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To date, however, a kinetic mechanism describing what drives the association of the domain to membranes and retention on membranes has not been addressed. We have recently shown that a single amino acid in the C1 domain (at position 22) tunes the affinity of this domain for DG-containing membranes (4Dries D.R. Gallegos L.L. Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 826-830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). This residue lies on the outside face of one of the sides of the ligand binding pocket. When present as Trp, as it is in novel PKC isozymes, the domain binds DG-containing membranes with sufficiently high affinity to sense agonist-evoked generation of DG. When present as Tyr, as it is in conventional isozymes, the affinity for DG-containing membranes is an order of magnitude lower, thus requiring a second targeting mechanism (Ca2+-dependent engagement of the C2 domain) for translocation to membranes. In this study, we take advantage of engineering a Trp at the tuning position of a conventional PKC to obtain a C1 domain that now has a high membrane affinity and a built-in fluorophore. We report on the kinetics for the interaction of the isolated C1 domain with lipid membranes, examining the role of PS and C1 ligand in the association and dissociation rate constants. The kinetic data provide evidence for a two-step mechanism by which the C1 domain interacts with membranes: an initial recruitment through electrostatic interactions with PS followed by a secondary search for ligand in two dimensions. High affinity interactions with membranes are determined by the extent to which hydrophobic interactions are productively made in this second step. This model explains in part the transient nature of DG signaling versus the chronic nature of PMA signaling and provides a framework for the rational design of PKC modulators. Materials—1-Palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (PC), 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-l-glycerol (PG), PS, and DG in chloroform were from Avanti Polar Lipids, Inc. l-α-Dipalmitoyl,[2-palmitoyl-9,10-3H]phosphatidylcholine (60 Ci mmol-1) was from American Radiochemical Co. PMA was from CalBiochem. Chelex 100 was purchased from Sigma. Electrophoresis reagents were from Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc. All other reagents and chemicals were reagent grade. Cloning and Purification of C1bβ-Y123W—Rat C1bβ-Y123W was subcloned into pGEX-6P3 and bacterially expressed and purified as described previously (4Dries D.R. Gallegos L.L. Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 826-830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Untagged domain was used for all experiments. Preparation of Lipid Vesicles—Sucrose-loaded vesicles (SLVs) were prepared as described (5Giorgione J.R. Lin J.H. McCammon J.A. Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 1660-1669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar); lipid vesicles for stopped-flow spectroscopy were prepared as described (6Nalefski E.A. Newton A.C. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 13216-13229Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). PMA was included as a lipid component in the calculation of the mole % of each desired lipid. PC was used as a neutral diluent to comprise the remaining mole % of phospholipid. The final concentration of lipid was determined by phosphate analysis as described (28Bartlett G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1959; 234: 466-468Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Lipid concentrations of DG-containing vesicles were calculated by dividing the phospholipid concentration by a factor of (1 minus the mole fraction of DG). PMA was incorporated into these vesicles as described (5Giorgione J.R. Lin J.H. McCammon J.A. Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 1660-1669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Steady-State Fluorometry—Steady-state tryptophan fluorescence data were collected using a Jobin (Edison, NJ) Yvon-SPEX FluoroMax-2 fluorescent spectrometer using constant wave-length analysis. Data were collected at 25 °C by excitation at 280 nm and monitoring emission at 340 nm. Solutions were successively added to an EDTA-treated 10-mm rectangular quartz cuvette with stirring (Starna Cells, Inc.) and were allowed to equilibrate for at least 2 min before recording fluorescence. Experiments were conducted in triplicate, correcting the mean emission intensity for the added sample volume. SLV Binding Assay—The binding of the C1b domain to SLVs and subsequent analysis was as described previously (4Dries D.R. Gallegos L.L. Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 826-830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). When used, KSLVd designates equilibrium constants derived from these assays. Stopped-flow Fluorescence Spectroscopy—Kinetic traces were measured using an Applied Photophysics Π*-180 stopped-flow fluorescence spectrometer (Leatherhead, UK). Kinetic analysis for the biomolecular association between the C1b domain and lipid vesicles (Equation 1) was conducted as described previously (6Nalefski E.A. Newton A.C. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 13216-13229Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). C1bβ+lipid↔C1bβ·lipid(Eq. 1) Lipid concentrations were chosen to be similar to those used in the equivalent SLV assay. For association experiments, final protein concentrations were 10-fold below the lowest lipid concentration tested. All experiments were temperature-controlled through the use of a 25 °C circulating water bath. All solutions were prepared in Chelex-treated buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 200 μm CaCl2, and 1 mm dithiothreitol prior to mixing. Treatment of buffer with Chelex was critical for the acquisition of monoexponential fits for all traces; untreated buffer often gave irreproducible fits deviating significantly from monoexponential decay. All curve fitting was done using KaleidaGraph version 5.32. When used, Kdcalc designates equilibrium constants calculated as the ratio of koffapp/konapp. Design of a Fluorescence-based Probe for the Interaction of the C1b Domain of PKCβ with Lipid Membranes—To study the kinetics of the association of the C1 domain with lipid vesicles using stopped-flow fluorescence spectroscopy, it was first necessary to design a fluorescence-based probe that was sensitive to such an interaction. We chose the C1b domain of the conventional isoform PKCβI/II because the isolated domain is stable and amenable to biochemical studies (5Giorgione J.R. Lin J.H. McCammon J.A. Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 1660-1669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 16Johnson J.E. Zimmerman M.L. Daleke D.L. Newton A.C.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 17271-17279Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). (This domain will hereafter be referred to as C1bβ, as the C1b domain is identical in both isoforms.) This C1b domain does not contain an endogenous Trp fluorophore, thus we introduced Trp at four positions in the domain: F114W, H117W, Y123W, and L150W (PKCβII numbering). Only one construct, C1bβ-Y123W, underwent measurable changes in fluorescence upon membrane binding (Fig. 1A). Specifically, intrinsic Trp fluorescence was quenched upon binding to model membranes. (This quenching upon membrane binding prevented fluorescence resonance energy transfer to dansyl-labeled lipids, an output that has been useful to study the membrane kinetics of the C2 domain (6Nalefski E.A. Newton A.C. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 13216-13229Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar); thus we focused on Trp quenching to monitor membrane binding.) Subsequently, we discovered that this mutation tunes the affinity of the domain for diacylglycerol, but not phorbol esters (4Dries D.R. Gallegos L.L. Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 826-830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Thus, the construct used in this study has the advantage of binding DG with sufficiently high affinity to be capable of sensing agonist-evoked diacylglycerol. Fig. 1B shows that the intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence of C1bβ-Y123W decreased by ∼50% upon addition of vesicles predicted to result in ∼80% bound domain (15 μm total lipid; 30 mol % PS, 5 mol % PMA, 65 mol % PC) (17Johnson J.E. Giorgione J. Newton A.C. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11360-11369Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Trp emission was fully restored upon complete dissociation of C1bβ-Y123W from lipid vesicles by the addition of detergent. Moreover, quenching of Trp fluorescence was reversible; fluorescence was recovered upon dilution of lipid to a concentration predicted to result in ∼50% bound domain (10 μm). Finally, despite being highly soluble and able to bind vesicles, none of the three other Trp mutants displayed this property indicating that the decrease in Trp emission is a specific property of C1bβ-Y123W and not a nonspecific effect of the experimental conditions, e.g. light scattering by lipid (data not shown). We next examined the association of C1bβ-Y123W with lipid vesicles using stopped-flow fluorescence spectroscopy. Trp quenching was monitored following the mixing of C1bβ-Y123W with vesicles containing 5 mol % PMA and 40 mol % PS (remainder PC). Traces for the association of the domain with lipid were monoexponential (Fig. 1C, top), with residuals consistent with simple, monophasic kinetics (Fig. 1C, bottom). Control experiments in which protein or lipid alone was rapidly mixed with buffer showed no change in fluorescence up to 40 s (data not shown). As another control, identical experiments with mutants C1bβ-F114W, -H117W, and -L150W did not show any time-dependent change in Trp emission (data not shown). These data demonstrate that the Trp fluorescence of the C1bβ-Y123W construct serves as a direct readout for the binding of the C1 domain to lipid vesicles. Binding of C1bβ-Y123W to Vesicles Containing Increasing Mole % PS—The interaction of PKC with PS is stereospecific and displays high cooperativity. Previous studies revealed that the determinants for the stereospecific interaction of PKC with PS reside within the C1 domain (3Newton A.C. Chem. Rev. 2001; 101: 2353-2364Crossref PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar, 16Johnson J.E. Zimmerman M.L. Daleke D.L. Newton A.C. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 12020-12025Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 17Johnson J.E. Giorgione J. Newton A.C. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11360-11369Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Thus, we set out to address the kinetic basis for this specificity. First, we examined the equilibrium binding of the C1bβ-Y123W construct to sucrose-loaded vesicles. The binding curves in Fig. 2 illustrate the exquisite sensitivity of binding to PS content: the presence of 10 mol % PS increased the affinity of C1β-Y123W for lipid vesicles 10-fold compared with the affinity for vesicles without PS (kdapp = 9.8 ± 0.3 for 10% PS versus 107 ± 8 μm for 0% PS). Further increasing the PS content to 40 mol % only increased the affinity for membranes 1.8-fold (kdapp = 9.8 ± 0.3 μm for 10% PS and 5.3 ± 0.5 for 30% PS). Hill coefficients were similar for all PS concentrations and ranged from 1.6 ± 0.2 to 2.3 ± 0.4, revealing some cooperativity in the membrane interaction. Next, we examined the kinetics of interaction of the C1bβ-Y123W construct with membranes containing increasing mole % PS by stopped-flow fluorescence spectroscopy (Table 1, right). Association rate constants (konapp) increased dramatically with increasing mole % PS: we observed a 30-fold increase in association rate constant from 0.05 ± 0.02 × 109 m-1 s-1 for 0% PS to 1.62 ± 0.09 × 109 m-1 s-1 for 40 mol % PS. Moreover, the presence of PS in PMA-containing membranes pushed the rate of association to diffusion-limited values. Dissociation rates (koffapp) decreased only slightly with increasing mole % PS and varied 3-fold at most, with the lowest being 0.04 s-1 for 20% PS and the highest being 0.13 ± 0.02 s-1 for 0% PS (Table 1). The dissociation rate constants in Table 1 were obtained from the y intercepts of the linear plots of kobs versus lipid concentration in association experiments; direct measurements of koff by dilution and competition experiments confirmed the values from association experiments (supplemental Fig. S1 and supplemental Tables SI and SII). Thus, the association of C1bβ-Y123W with PS-containing vesicles is exquisitely sensitive to PS, whereas the residence time on the membrane is only weakly sensitive to PS content.TABLE 1Apparent equilibrium and kinetic parameters for the association of C1bβ-Y123W with lipid vesicles of increasing mole % PSMol % PSApparent KdSLVcHill coefficientApparent kon × 109Apparent koffKdcalcμm lipidm−1s−1s−1μm lipid0107 ± 81.7 ± 0.10.05 ± 0.020.13 ± 0.02200 ± 100109.8 ± 0.31.62 ± 0.080.22 ± 0.030.11 ± 0.0145 ± 7208.4 ± 0.52.1 ± 0.20.22 ± 0.030.04 ± 0.0216 ± 8305.3 ± 0.51.6 ± 0.21.05 ± 0.060.090 ± 0.0037.7 ± 0.5406.3 ± 0.52.3 ± 0.41.62 ± 0.090.063 ± 0.0043.5 ± 0.3 Open table in a new tab Sensitivity to Ionic Strength of the Interaction of C1bβ-Y123W with Lipid Vesicles—Because the association of C1bβ-Y123W with lipid vesicles showed a strong dependence on mole % PS, the sensitivity of this interaction to ionic strength was tested. The interaction of C1bβ-Y123W with vesicles containing 5 mol % PMA and 20 mol % PS was relatively insensitive to KCl concentrations between 150 and 300 mm (Fig. 3, left). One possible interpretation of these data is that the membrane affinity is so high it masks any ionic strength sensitivity; therefore, the same interaction was tested under low affinity conditions (0.1 mol % PMA). Despite the 20-fold lower affinity of C1bβ-Y123W for 0.1 mol % PMA/20 mol % PS vesicles (supplemental Table SIII), this interaction, too, remained insensitive to ionic strength (Fig. 3, right). Moreover, initial kinetic experiments showed no effect of ionic strength on the association (konapp) or dissociation (koffapp) rates of C1bβ-Y123W with lipid vesicles (data not shown). It is possible that sensitivity of this interaction to ionic strength would only be observed at much lower salt concentrations, as previously reported for ligand binding to acetylcholinesterase (32Radic Z. Kirchhoff P.D. Quinn D.M. McCammon J.A. Taylor P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23265-23277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar); however, aggregation of the domain at 50 mm NaCl precluded equilibrium and kinetic analyses below 150 mm NaCl. Interaction of C1bβ-Y123W with PS and PG and the Nature of Chemical Quenching—The interaction of the C1 domain with anionic phospholipid is selective for PS over PG (3Newton A.C. Chem. Rev. 2001; 101: 2353-2364Crossref PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar, 17Johnson J.E. Giorgione J. Newton A.C. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11360-11369Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The mechanism of the interaction of the C1 domain with PS, however, has not been established. Therefore, we characterized this specific interaction through the use of equilibrium measurements and stopped-flow fluorescence spectroscopy. Earlier characterization of C1bβ-Y123W by equilibrium experiments revealed that this domain shows selectivity for PS over PG in the context of DG-containing vesicles; however, when the ligand is PMA, C1bβ-Y123W binds both PS- and PG-containing membranes equally well, even under moderate affinity conditions (4Dries D.R. Gallegos L.L. Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 826-830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) (supplemental Figs. S2 and S3 and Table SIII). We began by analyzing the kinetics of the interaction of C1bβ-Y123W with PMA membranes containing 30 mol % of either PS or PG (Table 2). The association of C1bβ-Y123W with both PS- and PG-containing PMA membranes displayed monoexponential kinetics (Fig. 4, left panels). C1bβ-Y123W showed nearly a 2-fold reduction in the rate of association with PG vesicles compare"
https://openalex.org/W2105177246,"Profilin has been implicated in cell motility and in a variety of cellular processes, such as membrane extension, endocytosis, and formation of focal complexes. In vivo, profilin replenish the pool of ATP-actin monomers by increasing the rate of nucleotide exchange of ADP-actin for ATP-actin, promoting the incorporation of new actin monomers at the barbed end of actin filaments. For this report, we generated a membrane-permeable version of profilin I (PTD4-PfnI) for the alteration of intracellular profilin levels taking advantage of the protein transduction technique. We show that profilin I induces lamellipodia formation independently of growth factor presence in primary bovine trabecular meshwork (BTM) cells. The effects are time- and concentration-dependent and specific to the profilin I isoform. Profilin II, the neuronal isoform, failed to extend lamellipodia in the same degree as profilin I. H133S, a mutation in the polyproline binding domain, showed a reduced ability to induce lamellipodia. H199E, mutation in the actin binding domain failed to induce membrane spreading and inhibit fetal bovine serum (FBS) -induced lamellipodia extension. Incubation with a synthetic polyproline domain peptide (GP5)3, fused to a transduction domain, abolished lamellipodia induction by profilin or FBS. Time-lapse microscopy confirmed the effects of profilin on lamellipodia extension with a higher spreading velocity than FBS. PTD4-Pfn I was found in the inner lamellipodia domain, at the membrane leading edge where it colocalizes with endogenous profilin. While FBS-induced lamellipodia formation activates Rac1, PTD4-Pfn I stimulation did not induce Rac1 activation. We propose a role of profilin I favoring lamellipodia formation by a mechanism downstream of growth factor."

The subunits TatC and Hcf106 are each present at approximately one copy/cpTat translocon (4Bolhuis A. Mathers J.E. Thomas J.D. Barrett C.M.L. Robinson C. J. Biol.

Tha4 has been postulated to form a custom-sized channel for transporting the folded cpTat substrates across the thylakoid membrane (8Gohlke U. Pullan L. McDevitt C.A. Porcelli I. de Leeuw E.

Sanders C. Microbiol. Res. 2003; 158: 7-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). chloroplast Tat protonmotive force intermediate OE17 N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine. The energy to accomplish transport on the cpTat pathway is derived exclusively from the trans-thylakoid protonmotive force (PMF) (11Braun N.A. Davis A.W. Theg S.M. Biophys. J. 2007; 93: 1993-1998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), which arises during photosynthetic electron transport. Nucleotide-binding motifs are not found on any of the cpTat subunits, and transport is unaffected by NTP addition or elimination (12Cline K. Ettinger W.F. Theg S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2688-2696Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with the dependence of the cpTat pathway on the thylakoid PMF, transport is sensitive to both the electroneutral H+/K+ antiporter nigericin and the electrogenic K+ ionophore valinomycin (11Braun N.A. Davis A.W. Theg S.M. Biophys. J. 2007; 93: 1993-1998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 12Cline K. Ettinger W.F. Theg S.M. J. Biol.

Brock I.W. Herrmann R.G. Robinson C. Plant Mol. Biol. 1992; 18: 1031-1034Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Although the process of transporting a folded cpTat substrate does not generally render the thylakoid membrane permeable to ions (16Teter S.A. Theg S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1590-1594Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), the proton/protein stoichiometry of a single substrate transport event has been estimated to be quite high; ∼80,000 protons are drained from the gradient for every Tat substrate that enters (17Alder N.N. Theg S.M. Cell. 2003; 112: 231-242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). PMF-dependent processes have a minimum thermodynamic threshold below which the process cannot occur. For instance, phosphorylation of ADP on the chloroplast F0F1-ATPase has a threshold of ∼2 ΔpH units (18Pick U. Rottenberg H. Avron M. FEBS Lett. 1973; 32: 91-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 19Portis A.R. McCarty R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 6250-6254Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Davenport J.W. McCarty R.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 851: 136-145Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar) when employing thylakoid conditions similar to those we commonly use in our laboratory (cf. Ref. 21Hangarter R.P. Good N.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 681: 397-404Crossref Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Considering that the maximum ΔpH that can be maintained in a thylakoid is ∼3.5 units (22Rottenberg H. Grunwald T. Avron M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1972; 25: 54-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 23Schuldiner S. Rottenberg H. Avron M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1972; 25: 64-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar), a large proportion of the thylakoid's energy is not available to the chloroplast F0F1-ATPase. Additionally, a disulfide bond is formed within the chloroplast F0F1-ATPase when the thylakoid PMF drops below a certain magnitude, locking it in a nonfunctional form (24Arana J.L. Vallejos R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 1125-1127Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Nalin C.M. McCarty R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 7275-7280Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These two features make phosphorylation by the chloroplast F0F1-ATPase a suboptimal tool for investigating the thylakoid PMF at a wide range of potentials. The cpTat pathway appears to have substrate-dependent thermodynamic thresholds for transport, which can be lower than those of phosphorylation by the chloroplast F0F1-ATPase. Two subunits of the oxygen-evolving complex of photosystem II, OE17 and OE23, are cpTat substrates and have thermodynamic thresholds of transport measured to be ∼1 and 2 ΔpH units, respectively (17Alder N.N. Theg S.M. Cell. 2003; 112: 231-242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the cpTat pathway is not known to undergo an inactivation reaction at low electrochemical potentials. For these reasons, the cpTat pathway may be a superior tool for probing the work that can be done by low values of the thylakoid PMF. To our surprise, we occasionally observed transport of cpTat substrates in samples held in the dark, i.e. in our “no-PMF” controls. Upon investigation, we were able to identify the conditions that allow this phenomenon to occur reproducibly. We demonstrate here that the cpTat pathway genuinely transports substrates in the dark and is dependent on a thylakoid PMF, which persists in the thylakoid at energetically useful levels for long periods of time after illumination has ceased. We propose that the energy for cpTat transport in the dark comes from a tightly held pool of protons that is not in equilibrium with the bulk aqueous proton pool. Plasmid Construction—The iOE17 and iOE23 clones used in this study were described previously (17Alder N.N. Theg S.M. Cell. 2003; 112: 231-242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 26Cline K. Henry R. Li C. Yuan J. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4105-4114Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). The i2×OE17 chimera was prepared by including a SacII restriction site at the end of the coding region of an iOE17 clone. On a separate parallel iOE17 clone, the lumen-targeting signal peptide was replaced with a SacII restriction site. Subsequent digestion and ligation of the two modified iOE17 clones resulted in a construct containing a single signal peptide followed by tandem mature regions. Preparation of Radiolabeled cpTat Substrates—Clones contained on pET23a plasmids (Novagen) were subject to in vitro transcription with T7 polymerase (Promega). The iOE17 and i2×OE17 clones were each translated in the presence of [35S]methionine, and iOE23 was translated in the presence of [3H]leucine, all using rabbit reticulocyte lysate (Promega). Preparation of Thylakoids—Thylakoids were isolated from 9–12-day-old peas (Pisum sativum var. Little Marvels) using an established protocol (17Alder N.N. Theg S.M. Cell. 2003; 112: 231-242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). After thylakoids were standardized to a chlorophyll concentration of 1 mg/ml (27Arnon D.I. Plant Physiol. 1949; 24: 1-15Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) in transport buffer (50 mm K+-Tricine, 330 mm sorbitol, and 5 mm MgCl2, pH8), they were exposed to an actinic light source (∼40 microeinsteins s–1 m–2) for 3 min before being placed in the dark on ice for 10 min. cpTat Transport Reactions—In every experiment reported, transport reactions began immediately after the 10-min dark incubation on ice. Conditions described as “dark” in this study refer to ambient light intensities of <0.01 microeinsteins s–1 m–2 during handling and all other procedures. All transport reactions took place in transport buffer. Typical transport reactions were stopped by centrifugation for 1 min at 12,000 × g in the dark followed by supernatant aspiration and resuspension of the thylakoid pellet in buffer (125 mm Tris, 4% SDS, 20% glycerol, and 5% 2-mercaptoethanol, pH 6.8) suitable for loading on polyacrylamide gels (28Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). Thermolysin treatments were performed as described previously (17Alder N.N. Theg S.M. Cell. 2003; 112: 231-242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), except in these experiments, they were performed in strict darkness. Percent transport was calculated using 10% load lanes of radioactive Tat substrates. Respectively, all gel collages are constructed from single gels with intervening lanes unrelated to the figure removed; the gel breakpoints are clearly visible in the figures. Thylakoid Antibody Treatment—Antibodies were affinity-purified and subsequently concentrated and resuspended in transport buffer using Amicon filters (Millipore). Antibody concentration was determined using bovine serum albumin standards on a Coomassie Blue-stained gel. Antibodies at a concentration of 1 mg/ml were incubated with thylakoids for 1 h in the dark. Where indicated, the Tha4 fragment antigen used in affinity purifying the antibody was included as a competitor with the antibody at a concentration of 1 mg/ml. After a gentle centrifugation (5 min, 200 × g), supernatant aspiration, and resuspension in transport buffer, thylakoids were exposed to actinic light for 3 min and then placed in the dark on ice for 10 min before transport reactions were initiated. Chemical Additions to Transport Reactions—All reactions with one exception had the indicated additional chemical components added immediately prior to the transport reaction. In the light re-exposure investigation of Fig. 5, after the initial 3-min actinic light exposure immediately following thylakoid isolation, methyl viologen and 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1-,1-dimethylurea were added during the 10-min dark incubation on ice. Methyl viologen, 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1-,1-dimethylurea, apyrase, and tentoxin were all purchased from Sigma. Spectroscopic Measurement of Potentials—Four established techniques were used to investigate thylakoid potentials in the dark. The lighting scheme performed for all potential indicators was a brief period in the dark without measurement to set the base line, 20 s of potential measurement in the dark, 3 min of potential measurement during actinic illumination, and finally 10 min of potential measurement in the dark. The potential indicators used were the ΔpH-indicating 9-aminoacridine (excitation at 420 nm and emission at 480 nm) (23Schuldiner S. Rottenberg H. Avron M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1972; 25: 64-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar), the exterior pH-indicating dye phenol red (A550) (29Berry S. Rumberg B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1410: 248-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), the non-quantitative thylakoid acidification-indicating dye neutral red (A550) (30Lynn W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 1060-1064Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Auslander W. Junge W. FEBS Lett. 1975; 59: 310-315Crossref Scopus (83) Google Scholar), and the electric potential-indicating electrochromic shift of carotenoid absorbance (A520) (32Witt H.T. Q. Rev. Biophys. 1971; 4: 365-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). All potential measurements were performed using a home-built modular spectrophotometer/fluorometer described previously (17Alder N.N. Theg S.M. Cell. 2003; 112: 231-242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), with the exception of the electrochromic shift, which was performed in a NoFOSpec spectrophotometer (33Sacksteder C.A. Jacoby M.E. Kramer D.M. Photosynth. Res. 2001; 70: 231-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). All potential measurements took place in transport buffer, with the exception of that with phenol red, which required thylakoids to be suspended in a weakly buffered and low osmolyte solution (50 mm KCl, 3 mm MgCl2, and 0.3 mm Tricine, pH 8). The Capacity of Thylakoids to Transport cpTat Substrates in the Dark Decays Exponentially and Is Sensitive to Ionophores—To investigate the energetic nature of dark transport on the cpTat pathway, we examined substrate transport in the dark as a function of time after illumination. The primary cpTat substrate used in this investigation (iOE17) was added to isolated thylakoids in the dark for 5-min transport reactions at 10-min intervals. Where indicated, nigericin and valinomycin (which act in concert to collapse the PMF) were added from ethanol stocks at the indicated times to achieve 1 μm concentrations for each just before initiation of the transport reaction. An exponential regression line drawn between the control points suggests that the ability of cpTat substrates to be transported in the dark decays with first-order kinetics (Fig. 1C, circles) with a half-time of ∼50 min. Nigericin and valinomycin had a clear effect on dark transport even when added after 90 min in the dark (Fig. 1, diamonds), although transport inhibition was incomplete. Numerous cpTat Substrates Are Transported in the Dark to a Thermolysin-inaccessible Space—To demonstrate that cpTat substrates are genuinely translocated across the thylakoid membrane in the dark and that this phenomenon is not specific to iOE17 alone, the thermolysin sensitivity of the mature forms of three different cpTat substrates (iOE17, iOE23, and i2×OE17) formed in our experiments was determined. The substrates iOE17 and i2×OE17 were mixed with thylakoids for 10 min at a chlorophyll concentration of 40 μg/ml in the dark and additionally in the light as a control treatment. The reactions were subsequently treated with thermolysin to digest substrate that had not been transported or were treated with mock solutions. Protease protection of the mature bands of OE17 and 2×OE17 indicates that they were inaccessible to thermolysin and thus located in the thylakoid lumen (Fig. 2, A and B). Compared with iOE17 and i2×OE17, iOE23 transported considerably less well in the dark at a chlorophyll concentration of 40 μg/ml. By reducing the volume of transport buffer in the reaction and thus concentrating the thylakoids to a chlorophyll concentration of 330 μg/ml, iOE23 exhibited significant transport in the dark (Fig. 2C); the mature protein formed was similarly resistant to digestion by thermolysin. The cpTat substrate OE17 appeared as a doublet in its mature size in many of our experiments. One obvious explanation is that there is an unknown OE17-processing or degradation event that occurs in the thylakoid lumen, but this has not been explored. Because both bands of the doublet are protease-protected, both bands reflect genuine protein transport. The cpTat Pathway Is Responsible for Transport of cpTat Substrates in the Dark—To verify that the cpTat pathway is responsible for the dark transport we observed and thus rule out substrate passage on another transport pathway, the kinetics of cpTat transport in the dark was compared with the kinetics of transport occurring under actinic illumination (Fig. 3, A and B). Transport of iOE17 in both the light (circles) and the dark (diamonds) initially occurred monotonically and achieved maximum transport at ∼6 min. Transport in the light produced roughly double the amount of mature protein compared with transport in the dark (Fig. 3A). After averaging in additional data sets and recasting the plots to normalize for the extent of substrate transported, it is obvious that both dark and light transport occur with similar kinetics (k = 0.36 and 0.26 s–1, respectively) (Fig. 3B). This is consistent with the idea that both transport processes utilize the same pathway. To further verify that the cpTat pathway is responsible for transporting these substrates in the dark, we disabled this pathway and looked for an effect on dark transport. It has previously been shown that cpTat transport is inhibited by treating thylakoids with antibodies to Tha4, one of the subunits of the cpTat translocon (34Mori H. Summer E.J. Ma X.Y. Cline K. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 45-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Incubation of iOE17 with thylakoids pretreated with anti-Tha4 antibody revealed that its transport in the dark was similarly inhibited by this treatment (Fig. 3C). Used as a control, treatment of thylakoids with an irrelevant antibody (fourth lane) did not inhibit dark transport. Inclusion with the antibody of an equimolar amount of Tha4 protein fragment antigen resulted in a modest recovery of dark transport. This demonstrates that dark transport is specifically dependent on Tha4 and that dark transport thus occurs on the cpTat pathway. Dark Transport Is the Result of neither Hydrolysis of Exogenous ATP by the F0F1-ATPase nor Mixing Artifacts—We investigated the effect of extrathylakoidal ATP on the creation of the long-lasting PMF in thylakoids. The chloroplast F0F1-ATPase can hydrolyze ATP to pump protons across the thylakoid membrane (35Crofts A.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1966; 24: 725-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), resulting in the formation of a PMF in the absence of actinic illumination. This can result in the transport of cpTat substrates (Fig. 4) (12Cline K. Ettinger W.F. Theg S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2688-2696Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The in vitro translated cpTat substrates we used to investigate dark transport introduced a certain amount of ATP (36Pelham H.R. Jackson R.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1976; 67: 247-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (2436) Google Scholar, 37Olsen L.J. Theg S.M. Selman B.R. Keegstra K. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 6724-6729Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), as well as an ATP regeneration system. We sought to determine whether the ATP added with our cpTat substrate to the transport reactions (estimated at a final concentration of 25–50 μm) supplied the energy to accomplish dark transport. Compared with the control treatment in Fig. 4A (lane 2), dark transport was unaffected by 3 units of apyrase and 12 μm tentoxin, compounds that nonproductively hydrolyze extrathylakoidal ATP and that bind to and inactivate the chloroplast F0F1-ATPase, respectively. Although externally added ATP is able to boost cpTat transport in the dark, this effect was eliminated by apyrase and tentoxin additions (compare lanes 6 and 9–11). Because apyrase and tentoxin had no effect on the existing PMF, their inclusion did not affect the amount of dark transport, which remained at control levels. Curiously, the addition of dithiothreitol to reduce the inhibitory regulatory disulfide in the CF1-ATPase had no apparent effect on increasing ATP hydrolysis and subsequent proton pumping by the F0F1-ATPase in the dark, which would have been manifested by increased protein transport (24Arana J.L. Vallejos R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 1125-1127Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Nalin C.M. McCarty R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 7275-7280Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 38Hoch G. Martin I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1963; 12: 223-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). One additional concern we had regarding the origins of the PMF in dark-adapted thylakoids was that the electrochemical potential that drives cpTat transport in the dark could possibly be the result of a buffer transition. The classic pH-jump experiments of Jagendorf and Uribe (39Jagendorf A.T. Uribe E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1966; 55: 170-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar) showed that a potential can arise in thylakoids by rapidly changing the pH of the buffer in which the thylakoids are suspended. A similar experimental design can create a work-producing ionic diffusion potential (40Junesch U. Graber P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 893: 275-288Crossref Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Although the thylakoids used in this investigation were equilibrated in transport buffer before use and were diluted into a reaction primarily composed of transport buffer, we wanted to be sure that ionic or pH changes did not occur upon dilution of the thylakoids into the reaction medium. To this end, the iOE17 substrate was added directly to the stock dark-adapted thylakoid suspension (at 1 mg/ml chlorophyll) and dark transport was subsequently assessed (Fig. 4B). Efficient cpTat transport under these conditions demonstrated that the energy for dark transport did not arise from effects relating to thylakoid buffer transitions. The PMF Utilized for Dark Transport Arises during Electron Transport—We next investigated whether proton pumping by the photosynthetic electron transport chain is the source of the PMF for dark cpTat transport. To this end, we performed an experiment in which the capacity of thylakoids for dark transport was monitored over time. After 60 min, when dark transport was significantly diminished, the thylakoids were again exposed to actinic light for 3 min and then placed in darkness on ice for another 12 min before a final cpTat transport reaction was initiated (Fig. 5). The untreated series exhibited an increase in transport after the actinic light re-exposure compared with the extent of transport seen at 60 min. The addition of methyl viologen (an artificial electron acceptor) boosted transport after the actinic light re-exposure to that initially seen at the zero time point. The restoring effect of light re-exposure on cpTat transport in the dark was prevented by the addition of the electron transport inhibitor 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1-,1-dimethylurea prior to the second light treatment, further demonstrating that electron transport is the ultimate source of the PMF utilized during dark protein transport. Traditional Indices of the Thylakoid PMF Do Not Detect a Lingering Energetic Potential in the Dark—We sought to determine whether the thylakoid energetic potential we detected indirectly by cpTat protein transport in the dark could also be observed by established potentiometric measurements. The traces shown in Fig. 6 are of light and dark treatments that mimicked our thylakoid handling immediately before transport: 3 min of actinic light followed by 10 min in the dark. We used four thylakoid potential indicators: phenol red, a membrane-impermeable pH-indicating dye, reports the pH in the solution outside of the thylakoid vesicles (Fig. 6A) (29Berry S. Rumberg B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1410: 248-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar); neutral red, a membrane-permeable dye, monitors the interior thylakoid pH when the external pH is strongly buffered (30Lynn W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 1060-1064Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 6B), although measurements made in constant light are not quantitative (31Auslander W. Junge W. FEBS Lett. 1975; 59: 310-315Crossref Scopus (83) Google Scholar); 9-aminoacridine, a permeable fluorescent amine, indicates the ΔpH across the thylakoid membrane (Fig. 6C) (23Schuldiner S. Rottenberg H. Avron M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1972; 25: 64-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar); and the potential-dependent electrochromic shift of carotenoid absorbance reports the transmembrane electric potential (Fig. 6D) (32Witt H.T. Q. Rev. Biophys. 1971; 4: 365-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar, 41Junge W. Witt H.T. Z. Naturforsch. 1968; 23: 244-254Crossref Scopus (341) Google Scholar). With the exception of the electrochromic shift, each indicator showed the development of a thylakoid potential at the onset of actinic illumination and a rapid recovery to the basal potential within a few minutes after actinic illumination ended, which remained steady during the 10 min in the dark. Not surprisingly, the carotenoid electrochromic shift was less well behaved, exhibiting a slow downward drift in the post-illumination dark period. Nonetheless, the immediate drop in the signal at the cessation of illumination that crossed the base line within 1 min of darkness indicates that the electric potential was similarly not maintained to an appreciable extent in the dark. Thus, like many before us, we are unable to demonstrate the existence of the dark PMF using the well established techniques that report on thylakoid energetics. The aim of this investigation was to determine whether the cpTat pathway is able to accomplish genuine protein transport in the dark and to probe the energetics of the thylakoid that underlie this phenomenon. Our experiments focused on verifying that dark cpTat transport is authentic, ruling out energy artifacts, and investigating the nature of the long-lived PMF utilized by the cpTat pathway in transport. Our first experiments were aimed at establishing the conditions that lead to the reproducible formation of a mature-sized product in protein transport reactions conducted in the dark. To that end, we settled on a procedure whereby we exposed thylakoids to light for 3 min and then placed them in complete darkness for at least 10 min (a length of time sufficient for the dissipation of all measurable proton gradients) prior to starting the reaction. We then verified that the mature proteins had indeed been transported to a protease-resistant compartment (Fig. 2) and that this transport had occurred on the cpTat pathway (Fig. 3). Most convincing were the experiments demonstrating that this transport phenomenon could be observed with a number of cpTat substrate proteins and that it was sensitive to antibodies directed against Tha4, a subunit of the cpTat translocon. Curiously, although we showed a PMF dependence of cpTat transport in the dark by demonstrating sensitivity to nigericin and valinomycin, the addition of these ionophores at 1 μm each did not always result in complete inhibition of transport under the conditions of our experiments (Fig. 1). Further examination revealed that it took longer than we expected for valinomycin and nigericin to eliminate all protein transport in the dark, typically taking ∼20 min of thylakoid exposure for complete inhibition of the reaction, although this time was variable (data not shown). These experiments made it clear that a thylakoid PMF drove the dark protein transport reactions we observed. Thus, we turned our attention to the origin of the long-lived PMF. The experiments of Figs. 4 and 5 indicate that this potential did not arise as an artifact of our experimental design, but remained as a residual driving force generated by photosynthetic electron transport during prior incidental light exposure. This conclusion is confounded by our finding that this potential is not detected by any known indicators of the thylakoid PMF. In contrast to 9-aminoacridine, which does not respond to ΔpH values below ∼1.8 units, phenol red, neutral red, and the carotenoid electrochromic shift were each capable of detecting small potential changes close to the original base line under our experimental conditions. Thus, a lingering potential equivalent to a ΔpH of 1 unit or more between the internal and external bulk aqueous phases would have been detected by these indicators had it been present. In addition, in agreement with the entire body of work on thylakoid energetics, every potential-indicating measurement we performed showed a collapse of the transmembrane proton chemical potential in the dark with a half-time in the range of 10–20 s (faster for the electrochromic shift). Given that seven half-lives (1–2 min) would lead to a >99% dissipation of such gradients, it is clear that the protons giving rise to the PMF controlling our experiments do not equilibrate with those probed by the bulk phase indicators we used. Interestingly, it has recently been reported that a newly developed energy-dependent in vitro Tat transport assay in bacterial inverted membrane vesicles also continues beyond the time at which energy gradients can be detected (51Bageshwar U.K. Musser S.M. J. Cell Biol. 2007; 179: 87-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The relationship between that phenomenon and the results we report here remains to be determined. The principal cpTat substrate used in our experiments (iOE17) has a thermodynamic threshold for transport of ∼5.7 J/mol H+ (1 ΔpH unit) (17Alder N.N. Theg S.M. Cell. 2003; 112: 231-242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) and was transported well in the dark under a variety of reaction conditions. In contrast, iOE23 has been shown to have a thermodynamic transport threshold of ∼11.4 J/mol H+ (2 ΔpH units), thereby requiring a higher PMF before transport can be initiated. With our standard dark transport reaction conditions, iOE23 was transported poorly in the dark. Nevertheless, we did observe robust dark iOE23 transport at higher thylakoid concentrations. The chimeric substrate i2×OE17 has a transport threshold measured in the light similar to that of iOE17 (data not shown), leading to the expectation, realized in our experiments, that i2×OE17 would be transported in the dark with similar efficiency as iOE17. The poor transport in the dark of the cpTat substrate iOE23 and the robust transport of iOE17 might indicate the energy content of thylakoids in the dark. On the basis of the respective thermodynamic thresholds of transport for iOE17 and iOE23, we can estimate that the meta-stable thylakoid PMF is between a ΔpH of 1 and 2 units in the dark under our experimental conditions. ATP formation by the chloroplast F0F1-ATPase also occurs in the dark; however, it lasts only for a short time after actinic illumination (42Hind G. Jagendorf A.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1963; 49: 715-722Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because ATP synthesis and iOE23 transport have similar thermodynamic thresholds (18Pick U. Rottenberg H. Avron M. FEBS Lett. 1973; 32: 91-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 19Portis A.R. McCarty R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 6250-6254Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Davenport J.W. McCarty R.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 851: 136-145Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar), we can infer that earlier studies of chloroplast F0F1-ATPase activity may not have detected the long-lived low energy thylakoid PMF in the dark, as it appears to exist below these thresholds. The existence in thylakoids of a slowly equilibrating pool of protons held out of equilibrium with those in the bulk aqueous phases has been demonstrated before (cf. Ref. 43Dilley R.A. Photosynth. Res. 2004; 80: 245-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar and references therein). These so-called localized protons have been measured directly with a pH electrode as they are released from dark-adapted thylakoids in response to uncoupler addition (44Laszlo J.A. Baker G.M. Dilley R.A. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1984; 16: 37-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), and they have been implicated in processes as varied as ATP synthesis (45Ort D.R. Dilley R.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1976; 449: 95-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 46Theg S.M. Chiang G. Dilley R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 673-681Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and establishing the environment of the active site of the water-splitting enzyme (47Theg S.M. Belanger K.M. Dilley R.A. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1987; 19: 53-68PubMed Google Scholar, 48Theg S. Johnson J. Homann P. FEBS Lett. 1982; 145: 25-29Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Our data are consistent with the hypothesis that the transport of cpTat substrates in the dark is an additional manifestation of the presence of these localized protons. The physical location of this pool of slowly equilibrating protons remains enigmatic. Recently, the energetic requirements of transport on the cpTat pathway have been drawn into question by two groups (49Finazzi G. Chasen C. Wollman F.A. de Vitry C. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 807-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 50Di Cola A. Bailey S. Robinson C. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 41165-41170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), each of which have suggested that the PMF dependence of transport observed in vitro may not apply in vivo. We believe that the issues brought up in those publications have been resolved by our previous study demonstrating that both the ΔpH and Δψ components of the PMF contribute to cpTat energetics (11Braun N.A. Davis A.W. Theg S.M. Biophys. J. 2007; 93: 1993-1998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The work presented herein contributes further to that discussion by underscoring the uncertainties and complexities of thylakoid energetics in general and its application to protein transport on the cpTat pathway in particular."

With constantly changing constituents associated with the mammalian diet, organisms have adapted metabolic strategies to efficiently accommodate changes in the availability of critical nutrients. Extensive studies have addressed the importance of glucose excess (1Girard J. Ferre P. Foufelle F. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1997; 17: 325-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar) and deprivation (2Lee A.S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1992; 4: 267-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar) as well as AA availability on metabolic and nuclear events (3Kilberg M.S. Pan Y.X. Chen H. Leung-Pineda V. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 2005; 25: 59-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). For example, the levels of branch chain AA regulate intracellular signaling through the central regulator, mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), culminating in downstream impacts on overall protein synthesis (4Kim D.H. Sabatini D.M. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 2004; 279: 259-270PubMed Google Scholar, 5Lindsley J.E. Rutter J. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. B Biochem. Mol.

Analogously, maintenance of tryptophan levels in fibroblast medium is critical to the regulation of the matrix-degrading enzymes, collagenase and stromelysin, by IL-1β (7Varga J. Li L. Mauviel A. Jeffrey J. Jimenez S.A. Lab. Investig. 1994; 70: 183-191PubMed Google Scholar, 8Varga J. Yufit T. Brown R.R. J. Clin. Investig. 1995; 96: 475-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). On the other hand, tryptophan degradation mediates the inhibitory effects of interferon-γ-dependent increases in cellular indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase mRNA (8Varga J. Yufit T. Brown R.R. J. Clin. Investig. 1995; 96: 475-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 9Varga J. Yufit T. Hitraya E. Brown R.R. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1996; 398: 143-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Most relevant to the present study, deprivation of essential AA has been demonstrated to evoke responses at both the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels for genes such as asparagine synthetase (ASNS), CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein homologous protein, cationic AA transporter (Cat-1Girard J. Ferre P. Foufelle F. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1997; 17: 325-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar), sodium-coupled neutral AA transporter system A (SNAT2), and insulin-like growth factor-binding protein-1 (IGFBP-1) (3Kilberg M.S. Pan Y.X. Chen H. Leung-Pineda V. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 2005; 25: 59-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Fernandez et al. (10Fernandez J. Bode B. Koromilas A. Diehl J.A. Krukovets I. Snider M.D. Hatzoglou M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11780-11787Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) have also demonstrated the existence of an internal ribosome entry site within the 5′-untranslated region of the cat-1 gene that controls translation of this transport protein under conditions of AA depletion. Tissue and cellular adaptation to nutrient availability also affects carbon and nitrogen utilization through glycolysis, the tricarboxylic acid cycle, and ultimately the aerobic generation of ATP via electron transport. A critical consequence of nutrient availability and subsequent metabolism is the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) as by-products of normal metabolism (11Frank L. Massaro D. Am. J. Med. 1980; 69: 117-126Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Previous estimates have indicated that under normal aerobic and nutrient conditions, 0.1% of consumed oxygen is released as superoxide radicals from mitochondrial electron transport (12Muller F.L. Liu Y. Abdul-Ghani M.A. Lustgarten M.S. Bhattacharya A. Jang Y.C. Van Remmen H. Biochem. J. 2008; 409: 491-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). It has also been established that a significant increase in the levels of ROS occurs under pathological conditions involving the synthesis and action of many pro-inflammatory mediators (13Wong G.H. Elwell J.H. Oberley L.W. Goeddel D.V. Cell. 1989; 58: 923-931Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (764) Google Scholar, 14Rogers R.J. Monnier J.M. Nick H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20419-20427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the connection between nutrient levels and the generation of ROS is underscored when considering that caloric restriction can significantly delay the aging process (15Roth G.S. J. Am. Geriatr. Soc. 2005; 53: S280-S283Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), which may be explained by a reduction in metabolic flux and a concomitant decline in ROS production (16Balaban R.S. Nemoto S. Finkel T. Cell. 2005; 120: 483-495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3285) Google Scholar). This observation is also consistent with the mitochondrial theory of aging (17Harman D. J. Gerontol. 1956; 11: 298-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (6497) Google Scholar), which implicates continuous generation of ROS as a critical factor for damage to mitochondrial DNA as well as oxidative reactions with components of the cytosol and nucleus. Mutations in genes from the insulin-like signaling network in Caenorhabditis elegans, such as age-1, a homologue of the mammalian phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase, and daf-2, a homologue of the insulin or insulin-like growth factor receptor family, cause a life span extension phenotype, with animals living twice as long as the wild type (18Honda Y. Honda S. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2002; 959: 466-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). These mutations may propagate their effects by conferring resistance to oxidative stress, possibly through increases in the antioxidant enzyme, manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) (18Honda Y. Honda S. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2002; 959: 466-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Studies in yeast (19Harris N. Costa V. MacLean M. Mollapour M. Moradas-Ferreira P. Piper P.W. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2003; 34: 1599-1606Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) and Drosophila (20Tower J. Mech. Ageing Dev. 2000; 118: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 21Sun J. Folk D. Bradley T.J. Tower J. Genetics. 2002; 161: 661-672Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have also implicated overexpression of MnSOD with an increase in organism life span. Furthermore, Kokoszka et al. (22Kokoszka J.E. Coskun P. Esposito L.A. Wallace D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2278-2283Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that MnSOD heterozygous mice displayed increased mitochondrial dysfunction marked by increased proton leakage, inhibition of respiration, and the accumulation of mitochondrial oxidative damage. These studies also provided a link between chronic oxidative stress in the heterozygous mice and a premature induction of apoptosis, thus implicating the importance of MnSOD in cell death and aging. These observations are also consistent with data demonstrating the potent anti-apoptotic activity associated with overexpression of this mitochondrial localized antioxidant enzyme in a variety of mitochondria-dependent cell death pathways (23Cox G. Oberley L.W. Hunninghake G.W. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1994; 10: 493-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 24Keller J.N. Kindy M.S. Holtsberg F.W. St Clair D.K. Yen H.C. Germeyer A.

Greenberger J.S. Engelhardt J.F. Hum. Gene Ther. 1998; 9: 1381-1386Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Additionally, the significant induction of MnSOD gene expression by pro-inflammatory cytokines (13Wong G.H. Elwell J.H. Oberley L.W. Goeddel D.V. Cell. 1989; 58: 923-931Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (764) Google Scholar, 27Wong G.H. Goeddel D.V. Science. 1988; 242: 941-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (836) Google Scholar, 28Visner G.A. Dougall W.C. Wilson J.M. Burr I.A. Nick H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2856-2864Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) is also in line with a cell survival strategy that accompanies increased levels of ROS associated with the inflammatory response. Therefore, we postulated that nutrient availability, in the form of either glucose or AA deprivation, may have relevant metabolic and cell survival benefits through elevation of MnSOD levels. Our results establish a nutrient-dependent regulation pathway for MnSOD that is novel when compared with the cellular mechanisms that are currently proposed to orchestrate the induction of gene expression via essential AA deprivation (3Kilberg M.S. Pan Y.X. Chen H. Leung-Pineda V. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 2005; 25: 59-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). We have demonstrated that, in contrast to all previously studied AA-regulated genes, the induction of MnSOD by histidine depletion, a representative essential AA, requires the presence of millimolar levels of glutamine (Gln). We have shown that this regulatory pathway requires intracellular signals through the tricarboxylic acid cycle and electron transport chain with a dependence on mitochondrial membrane potential but not ATP levels. Our results also demonstrate that this unique AA-dependent regulatory pathway necessitates normal signaling through both the MEK/ERK and mTOR pathways. Reagents and Antibodies—2-Methoxyestradiol, KMV, 3-nitropropionic acid, malonate, actinomycin-b, cycloheximide, antimycin, oligomycin, and 2,4-dinitrophenol were obtained from Sigma. SB202190, SB203580, PD98059, JNK (c-Jun N-terminal kinase) inhibitor II, and U0126 were purchased from Calbiochem. Fluoroacetate and rapamycin were obtained from Fluka, St. Louis, and LC Laboratories, Woburn, MA, respectively. Phospho-p70 S6 kinase (Thr-389), phospho-4E-BP1 (Thr-37/46), and phospho-p70 S6 kinase (Thr-421/Ser-424) antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA, and MnSOD was from StressGen, San Diego. Cell Culture and Treatment Conditions—HepG2 (human hepatoma) cells were maintained in minimal essential medium (MEM) (Sigma), pH 7.4, supplemented with 25 mm NaHCO3, 4 mm Gln, antibiotic/antimycotic (Invitrogen), and 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Invitrogen) at 37 °C with 5% CO2. All data involve the use of this cell line. Cells were grown to 50–65% confluency on 10-cm dishes and split 1:8 into 60-mm dishes for 24 h. In all experiments, medium was changed 12 h before the start of the experiment to ensure the AA levels in general are not depleted. The cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), incubated in 3 ml of the appropriate medium, and collected at the indicated times for either Northern or immunoblot analysis. All experiments were performed with 10% dialyzed FBS. For experiments where AA other than histidine are depleted, Earle's Balanced Salt Solution (EBSS) (Sigma) was used and supplemented with antibiotic/antimycotic, a vitamin mixture (Invitrogen), and 10% dialyzed FBS. Each AA was then added individually to the medium at the same levels as in the MEM while omitting the AA being tested. For the “AA add back” experiments, the same EBSS base and supplements were used, and then only the indicated AA was added at a concentration of 5 mm. The pH of the medium was maintained at 7.2–7.4 and adjusted (when necessary) with 0.1 m NaOH or HCl. Stock solutions of inhibitors were adjusted to a neutral pH before treatments. RNA Isolation and Northern Analysis—Total RNA was isolated from cells as described by the Chomczynski and Sacchi method with modifications (28Visner G.A. Dougall W.C. Wilson J.M. Burr I.A. Nick H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2856-2864Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Five to 10 μg of total RNA were fractionated on 1% agarose, 6% formaldehyde gels, electrotransferred to a Zeta-Probe membrane (Bio-Rad), and UV cross-linked. Membranes were then incubated for 1 h in a pre-hybridization buffer and incubated with a 32P-radiolabeled gene-specific probe generated by random primer extension overnight at 62 °C. Membranes were then washed with a high stringency buffer at 66 °C and exposed to x-ray film. Generation of cDNA—To generate cDNA for real time PCR analysis SuperScript™ first strand synthesis kit from Invitrogen was used. 1 μg of total RNA isolated as described was used as the template. Prior to further analysis, double distilled H2O was added to a final reaction volume of 100 μl. Real Time RT-PCR—2 μl of cDNA generated from first strand synthesis (as described above) was used as the template for real time PCR. To this, 0.3 μm of each primer was added, 12.5 μl of iTaq™ SYBR® Green Supermix with ROX (Bio-Rad), and water to a final volume of 25 μl. The Applied Biosystems 7000 sequence detection system was used with the following parameters: cycle 1 (95 °C for 10 min) 1 time; cycle 2 (95 °C for 15 s, 60 °C for 1 min) for 40 cycles. The ΔΔCT method was used to determine the relative fold changes, normalized to the cyclophilin A gene, and is described in Ref. 29Livak K.J. Schmittgen T.D. Methods (San Diego). 2001; 25: 402-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (123392) Google Scholar. Primers for cyclophilin A are as follows: forward, 5′-CAT CCT AAA GCA TAC GGG TCC-3′, and reverse, 5′-GCT GGT CTT GCC ATT CCT G-3′. De Novo Transcriptional Analysis of MnSOD—RNA was isolated as described previously with the addition of DNase I treatment. Heterogeneous nuclear RNA levels were then quantified by real time RT-PCR. Growth Hormone Reporter Constructs—Regions of the MnSOD gene were cloned into a human growth hormone (hGH) reporter plasmid (30Selden R.F. Howie K.B. Rowe M.E. Goodman H.M. Moore D.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 3173-3179Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). A phage artificial chromosome clone, obtained from the Sanger Institute (RP1-56L9), containing the entire human MnSOD gene was used to clone regions of interest into a promoterless growth hormone reporter plasmid (pØGH). A 3.6-kb BamHI fragment of the human promoter was digested from the phage artificial chromosome vector and separated on a 0.7% agarose gel, gel-purified, and cloned into the BamHI site of pØGH. Unique restriction enzyme sites were used to generate 1.4-, 1.3-, 1.1-, and 0.83-kb promoter fragments. To generate the promoter constructs in conjunction with the human MnSOD enhancer, a 488-bp fragment was digested from a previously generated construct (31Rogers R.J. Chesrown S.E. Kuo S. Monnier J.M. Nick H.S. Biochem. J. 2000; 347: 233-242Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The 488-bp human enhancer fragment was subcloned into the HindIII site of the hGH constructs containing the indicated human MnSOD promoter. A plasmid containing a minimal viral thymidine kinase promoter coupled to the pØGH plasmid was used with the human MnSOD enhancer fragment as described previously (31Rogers R.J. Chesrown S.E. Kuo S. Monnier J.M. Nick H.S. Biochem. J. 2000; 347: 233-242Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Transient Transfection of Reporter Constructs—HepG2 cells were cultured as described previously and transfected at ∼50% confluency in a 10-cm dish. The reporter plasmid containing different regions of the MnSOD gene were transiently transfected using a FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science). For each 10-cm dish, 15 μl of the FuGENE 6 transfection reagent was diluted to a final volume of 600 μl in serum-free MEM. 5 μg of reporter plasmid was then added, and the reaction was incubated at room temperature for 30 min and then transferred to HepG2 cells. After 24 h, the cells were split 1:10 into 35-mm dishes and incubated for another 12 h after which the cells were then incubated in either FED or –His media. pØGH was also transfected to ensure that the transfection itself or the hGH plasmid did not have an effect on the MnSOD message. Northern analyses were used to evaluate the effect of histidine deprivation on the hGH message. A fragment from the hGH cDNA was used to generate a radiolabeled probe for Northern analysis. Protein Isolation and Immunoblot Analysis—HepG2 cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and lysed with a buffer containing both protease (Roche Applied Science) and phosphatase inhibitors (Calbiochem), in 1 m Tris, pH 7.5, 5 m NaCl, 0.5 m EDTA pH 8, and Triton X-100 (TBST). Protein concentrations were determined by bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay (Pierce). 10–20 μg of total cellular protein was separated on a Tris-HCl, SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to a Hybond ECL nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Biosciences). The membranes were then blocked for 1 h with 5% nonfat dry milk in TBST at room temperature. The membranes were incubated at 4 °C with primary antibody overnight, washed three times with TBST, incubated with a secondary for 2 h, washed again three times, and subjected to ECL chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). Cell Viability—Cell viability was determined using a 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay (Invitrogen). 10 μl of 12 mm MTT dissolved in PBS was added to the culture medium and allowed to incorporate into the cells for 4 h at 37°C. The media were then removed and the cells rinsed with PBS. Cells were solubilized in Me2SO diluted in PBS and incubated for 10 min at 37 °C. The cells were then mixed and the plates read at 540 nm in a Spectramax plus 384 plate reader. siRNA—HepG2 cells were transfected with a final concentration of 100 nm SMARTpool® MnSOD siRNA (Dharmacon) using DharmaFECT™ 4 siRNA transfection reagent (Dharmacon). A cyclophilin-specific siRNA (Dharmacon) was employed as a control for off-target effects of siRNA. ATP Measurements—ATP levels were measured from HepG2 cells utilizing the ATP bioluminescent kit from Sigma. After 12 h of treatment cells were trypsinized; 3 ml of medium was added, the cells were mixed thoroughly, and 1 ml was transferred to a 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tube. A 100-μl aliquot of ATP assay solution (diluted 1:25) was added to a fresh tube and incubated at room temperature for 3 min, allowing for endogenous ATP to be hydrolyzed and decreasing the background. In a separate 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tube, the following was mixed: 100 μl of releasing agent (FL-SAR), 50 μl of water, and 50 μl of the cell sample. A 100-μl aliquot of this mix was added to the 100-μl ATP assay solution, and relative light units were measured using a Berthold SIRUS luminometer version 3.0. Densitometry and Statistical Analysis—All densitometry was quantified from autoradiography films using a Microtek scan maker 9600XL and analyzed with the UN-SCAN-IT program, Silk Scientific Corp., version 5.1. Densitometric quantification of the autoradiographs for MnSOD employed the intensity of the 4-kb mRNA. The relative fold induction was determined from FED or EBSS levels, normalized to the internal control, ribosomal protein L7a. Data points are the means from independent experiments. An asterisk denotes significance as determined by a Student's t test to a value of p ≤ 0.05. Nutrient availability in the mammalian diet has a potentially critical impact on metabolic flux, the generation of ATP, and as a consequence, the generation of mitochondrially derived ROS. Given the role of MnSOD in the detoxification of mitochondrially derived ROS, we postulated that nutrient availability might have direct effects on the levels of MnSOD gene expression. To test this hypothesis, the response of MnSOD in cell culture to the exclusion of a single essential AA, histidine, was evaluated by Northern analysis in the human hepatoma cell line, HepG2, and compared with the documented response to pro-inflammatory mediators. It has been previously established that lipopolysaccharide, interleukins 1 and 6 (IL-1β and IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-α, and interferon-γ induce MnSOD at the mRNA and protein levels (27Wong G.H. Goeddel D.V. Science. 1988; 242: 941-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (836) Google Scholar, 32Visner G.A. Chesrown S.E. Monnier J. Ryan U.S. Nick H.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Interferon Cytokine Res. 1996; 16: 61-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The top panel of Fig. 1A shows MnSOD mRNA levels in HepG2 cells incubated for 12 h in complete MEM medium (FED), MEM lacking histidine (–His), or treated with either that lipopolysaccharide, tumor necrosis factor-α, IL-1β, or IL-6. Two mRNA species are produced from the human MnSOD gene because of alternative polyadenylation (36Hurt J. Hsu J.L. Dougall W.C. Visner G.A. Burr I.M. Nick H.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 2985-2990Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 37Melendez J.A. Baglioni C. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1993; 14: 601-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Steady state MnSOD mRNA levels are induced in response to –His, relative to FED, and addition of 5 mm histidine to FED conditions (1st lane of Fig. 1A (+His)) further reduced basal levels, demonstrating the depletion of histidine over the 12-h incubation time and subsequent increases in MnSOD mRNA levels (zero and FED). This observation could have profound effects because most conventional cell culture procedures do not recommend feeding of cells for up to 48 h. To ensure that all experiments have similar MnSOD basal levels, fresh medium was given to the cells 12 h before the start of each experiment. Because HepG2 cells preferentially produce the 4-kb message in response to –His, this is the species referred to and utilized in densitometry for all experiments. In all Northern analyses, the large ribosomal subunit 7a (L7a) was used as an internal loading control. The immunoblot analysis at the bottom of Fig. 1A also demonstrates associated increases of MnSOD protein by 48 h. This induction is also reproducible in another human hepatoma cell line, HuH7, as well as, less robustly, in human lung fibroblast and epithelial cells (data not shown). Many other genes known to be regulated by AA deprivation also respond to glucose starvation (3Kilberg M.S. Pan Y.X. Chen H. Leung-Pineda V. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 2005; 25: 59-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). In addition, glucose metabolism may have profound downstream effects on the production of mitochondrially derived ROS. To evaluate the specificity of changes in MnSOD mRNA levels, cells were starved for glucose (–Glc) and compared with –His. As shown in Fig. 1B, MnSOD mRNA levels are induced only in response to AA deprivation. As a positive control for glucose deprivation, the membranes were reprobed for glucose-regulated protein (GRP78) (38Lee A.S. Methods (San Diego). 2005; 35: 373-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (775) Google Scholar). Fig. 1C is a summary of densitometric data from three independent experiments. Two other known inducers of the endoplasmic reticulum stress response (39Lievremont J.P. Rizzuto R. Hendershot L. Meldolesi J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30873-30879Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar), thapsigargin and tunicamycin, were also tested and, similar to glucose deprivation, showed no induction of MnSOD mRNA (data not shown). To further characterize the MnSOD gene induction in response to AA deprivation, mRNA levels were evaluated when each individual AA was omitted from complete medium and incubated for 2, 6, and 12 h. As shown in the representative examples in Fig. 1D, depletion of essential AA other than His also causes a similar increase in MnSOD mRNA levels, with the exception of tryptophan. On the other hand, depletion of nonessential AA from culture medium had no effect. A densitometric and statistical summary is shown in Fig. 1E. Given the uniqueness of the induction of MnSOD by essential amino acid starvation (–His condition), we next evaluated a potential physiological role for MnSOD during amino acid deprivation. Cell viability was measured using an MTT assay. As illustrated in Fig. 2A, incubation in –His medium reproducibly causes an increase in cell viability (∼48%) as compared with the FED condition. To evaluate the role of MnSOD in the increased cell survival, cells were also treated with 2-methoxyestradiol, which has been shown to inhibit MnSOD (40Gao N. Rahmani M. Shi X. Dent P. Grant S. Blood. 2006; 107: 241-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 41Golab J. Nowis D. Skrzycki M. Czeczot H. Baranczyk-Kuzma A. Wilczynski G.M. Makowski M. Mroz P. Kozar K. Kaminski R. Jalili A.

These data (Fig. 2A) also demonstrate that 10 μm 2-methoxyestradiol eliminates the increased cell survival associated with the –His conditions, whereas the inhibitor had no effect on cells grown in the FED condition. To determine whether –His conditions offer a cytoprotective advantage during stress conditions, cells were preincubated for 24 h in –His medium followed by exposure to sub-lethal levels of UV light. The cell survival curves in Fig. 2B demonstrate that –His conditions can reduce cell death following UV exposure. The level of cytoprotection was most significant at 1 and 2 min of UV exposure with an ∼50 and 70% reduction in cell death at these time points, respectively. To further address the specific role of MnSOD in the increase of cell survival associated with depletion of essential AA, we exposed cells to an siRNA specific to MnSOD as compared with a non"

The agonist locations are probed by monitoring changes in the lipid proton chemical shifts and by MAS-assisted nuclear Overhauser enhancement spectroscopy, which indicates the orientation of the agonists with respect to the 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine lipids. In the single component bilayer, the membrane agonists are found predominantly in the top of the hydrophobic chain or in the glycerol region of the membrane. Most of the agonists orient approximately parallel to the membrane plane, with the exception of quipazine, whose piperazine ring is found in the glycerol region, whereas its benzene ring is located within the lipid hydrophobic chain. The location of the agonist in brain lipid membranes is similar to the 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine lipid bilayers; however, many of the agonists appear to locate close to the cholesterol in the membrane in preference to the phospholipids.

Drug molecule interaction with lipid membranes is a critical factor governing its final activity, because it needs to negotiate its way through several membranes on the way to its receptor protein. In an effort to facilitate the design of drugs, water/octanol partitioning coefficients are often used. However, this simple two-phase model falls short of adequately describing the complexity of lipid/drug interactions. A lipid membrane is a chemically very diverse environment. Lipid headgroups are often charged and highly hydrated, and the interface between the headgroup and hydrophobic core of a membrane is typified by the presence of glycerol, carbonyl groups, and lower concentrations of water. It is only the very center of the membrane that is nonpolar and excludes water (1Wiener M.C. White S.H. Biophys. J. 1992; 61: 434-447Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar, 2Subczynski W.K. Wisniewska A. Yin J.J. Hyde J.S. Kusumi A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7670-7681Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Drug molecules tend to contain substituted aromatic groups that add further complications; steric effects exclude aromatic groups from the lipid chain region (3Yau W.M. Wimley W.C. Gawrisch K. White S.H. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 14713-14718Crossref PubMed Scopus (832) Google Scholar), whereas other attractive forces between the ring and lipid carbonyls draw the molecule to the interface between the chain and headgroup regions of the membrane (4Pinkus A.G. Custard H.C. J. Phys. Chem. 1970; 74: 1042-1049Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 5Dougherty D.A. Science. 1996; 271: 163-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (2366) Google Scholar). Furthermore, any charged chemical groups will be excluded from the low dielectric environment at the center of the bilayer (2Subczynski W.K. Wisniewska A. Yin J.J. Hyde J.S. Kusumi A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7670-7681Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Consequently, the mechanism by which a molecule partitions into lipid bilayers or crosses a biological membrane will be a complex interplay of many factors. The majority of drug targets are membrane proteins. Hence the interaction of a drug with the membrane is crucial for its efficacy and involves several interesting aspects, such as its location probability profile across the membrane bilayer, its orientation, and its structure. A high location probability in a particular part of a membrane and its orientation with respect to the membrane normal could well be important to how the drug is presented to the binding site of the target protein (6Castanho M. Fernandes M.X. Eur. Biophys. J. Biophys. Lett. 2006; 35: 92-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Finally, it is now recognized that cholesterol-rich microdomains (“lipid rafts”) form within cellular membranes (7Ramstedt B. Slotte J.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1758: 1945-1956Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Certain chemicals have displayed an affinity for such domains (8Allen J.A. Halverson-Tamboli R.A. Rasenick M.M. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2007; 8: 128-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar), and it is quite possible that such domains could have an impact on receptor drug interactions. Surprisingly little high resolution information exists on the location profiles of drug molecules in lipid bilayers. Recently, 1H NMR and specifically magic angle spinning-assisted nuclear Overhauser enhancement spectroscopy (MAS-NOESY) 2The abbreviations used are: MASmagic angle spinningNOESYnuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopyDOPC1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholineHETCORheteronuclear correlation spectroscopy5-HT1aserotonin receptor 1aDROSSdipolar recoupling on-axis with scaling and shape preservation. experiments have proved to be an ideal tool for investigating the location of small molecules embedded in lipid membranes, with atomic resolution (3Yau W.M.

In this study, solid state NMR techniques are applied to DOPC and brain lipid bilayers doped with five diverse 5-HT1a receptor agonists (serotonin, buspirone, quipazine, 8-OH-DPAT, and LY-165,163). These molecules represent a cross-section of available serotonin receptor 1a (5-HT1a) agonists and have varying octanol/water partitioning coefficients and 5-HT1a binding constants (see Table 1). The artificial agonist interactions with membranes are of particular interest because they must cross the blood-brain barrier to access their target protein. Moreover, the natural binding site for serotonin on the 5-HT1a receptor is thought to be located within the membrane and is consequently accessible only to molecules that accumulate in the surrounding lipids (11Pucadyil T.J. Kalipatnapu S. Chattopadhyay A. Cell Mol. Neurobiol. 2005; 25: 553-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar).TABLE 1Octanol/water partitioning coefficients and (Log Pow) association constants (Ki) for 5-HT1a agonists The average octanol/water partitioning coefficients (Log Pow) were calculated using alogps 2.1.MoleculeAverage Log PowKi 5-HT1anmSerotonin0.622.2 (28)Buspirone2.7215 (28)Quipazine2.26780 (28)8-OH-DPAT4.21 (28)LY-165,1634.21.26 (29) Open table in a new tab We present high resolution MAS-NOESY data of doped DOPC membranes, which determine the agonist locations and orientation within the membrane bilayer. Chemical shift changes, induced by agonist aromatic rings in proximate lipid molecules, are used as a further indication of the drug molecules membrane coordinates. Interestingly, it was possible to show that the agonists preferentially interact with different components of the brain lipid systems. Materials—1,2-Dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DOPC) and porcine brain total lipid extracts were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL). The brain lipid extract consists of phosphatidylethanolamine (16.7% w/w), phosphatidylserine (10.6% w/w), phosphatidylcholine (9.6% w/w), phosphatidic acid (2.8% w/w), phosphatidylinositol (1.6%), and other (58.7% w/w) (Avanti Polar Lipids), of which the majority will be cholesterol (∼30–40% w/w total lipid) (13O'Brien J.S. Sampson E.L. J. Lipid Res. 1965; 6: 537-544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All other chemicals including serotonin, buspirone, quipazine, 8-OH-DPAT, and LY-165,163 were purchased from Sigma. Sample Preparation—78 mg of DOPC and agonist was dissolved in chloroform/methanol (1:1 v/v) with a 4:1 lipid to agonist molar ratio. Brain lipid/agonist samples were prepared at the same ratios. The solvents were evaporated under vacuum, and the resulting lipid cake was suspended in 1 ml of doubly distilled water, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and then lyophilized overnight under high vacuum. The dry lipid mixtures were hydrated with ∼20 μl of D2O and then subjected to three freeze/thaw cycles. The mixtures were then transferred into 4-mm MAS rotors. NMR Measurements—All NMR experiments (at 288 K) were carried out on a Bruker Avance II 500 MHz spectrometer using a 4-mm MAS probe operating at frequencies of 500.1025 MHz (1H) and 125.7546 MHz (13C). 1H and 13C experiments were carried out at 10 kHz (1H) and 5 kHz (13C) MAS speeds. 1H and 13C spectra were externally referenced to tetramethylsilane at 0 ppm. 1H experiments were conducted with a typical π/2 pulse length of 7 μs and a relaxation delay of 4 s. Two-dimensional NOESY and correlation spectroscopy experiments had 256 or 512 increments and 8 or 16 scans/increment. NOESY build-up curves were acquired at mixing times of 0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.6, and 0.8 s. 13C spectra were collected with a typical π/2 pulse of 3.2 μs. Proton decoupling during the acquisition period was achieved using two pulse phase modulation (30 kHz). Two-dimensional 13C-1H heteronuclear correlation spectroscopy (HETCOR) measurements were typically carried out with 256 increments and 256 or 512 scans/increment. A recycle delay of 2 s was used for all 13C-detected experiments. Lipid order parameters were determined by measuring 1H-13C dipolar couplings using two-dimensional dipolar recoupling on-axis with scaling and shape preservation (DROSS) experiments (14Gross J.D. Warschawski D.E. Griffin R.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1997; 119: 796-802Crossref Scopus (91) Google Scholar). 1H-13C dipolar couplings were extracted from the dipolar splittings directly from the spectrum. The splittings were converted to segmental order parameters as described by Warschawski and Devaux (15Warschawski D.E. Devaux P.F. Eur. Biophys. J. 2005; 34: 987-996Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). All of the NMR data were processed using Topspin version 1.3 (Bruker Instruments, Karlsruhe, Germany). NOESY peak volumes were obtained by peak fitting and integration using CARA (16Keller R. The Computer Aided Resonance Assignment Tutorial. Cantina Verlag, Goldlau, Switzerland2004Google Scholar). Data Analysis—NOESY data were used to calculate the location of a given nucleus in the lipid membrane using the “full matrix rate analysis,” described in detail by Huster et al. (17Huster D. Arnold K. Gawrisch K. J. Phys. Chem. B. 1999; 103: 243-251Crossref Scopus (153) Google Scholar). In short, experimentally measured NOESY peak volume, represented by matrix A, at the mixing time tm, and the cross-relaxation rate R are linked by the following matrix equation. A(tm)=A(0)·exp(-Rtm)(Eq. 1) The relaxation rate matrix R is calculated by rewriting Eq. 1 as follows. R=X(lnD)X-1tm(Eq. 2) Here, X is the matrix of eigenvectors, and D is the diagonal matrix of eigenvalues of the normalized peak volume matrix a(tm) = A(tm)[(A(0)-1]. The relaxation rates, contained in R, were taken as indicators of the relative location probabilities and are plotted to give a location profile of the agonists, at atomic resolution. All calculations were carried out with the help of Python 2.5, specifically with the modules pylab and SciPy (www.scipy.org). The agonist to lipid ratio (1:4) used in this study is desirable to ensure good signal to noise of the NOESY cross-peaks and significant induced chemical shifts (see below). However, at these high agonist concentrations, measurements may be compromised by disruption of the lipid bilayer or agonist aggregation. Aggregation can be ruled out by the observation that agonist proton peaks are sharp and well resolved (Fig. 1, A–E), indicating that they are highly mobile. The line widths of the lipid proton signals are unaffected by the presence of agonist. It is well established that a change from a fluid lamellar to a gel phase is accompanied by a broadening of the NMR lines and subsequent loss of resolution (19Forbes J. Husted C. Oldfield E. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1988; 110: 1059-1065Crossref Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 20Polozov I.V. Gawrisch K. Biophys. J. 2004; 87: 1741-1751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Because no broadening is seen upon the addition of agonist (Fig. 1), it is safe to assume that the lipids, in all mixtures, remain in a fluid lamellar phase. The phase of the lipids was further investigated by determining the order parameters of all DOPC/agonist mixtures. These values were extracted from 13C-1H dipolar couplings using a DROSS pulse sequence (14Gross J.D. Warschawski D.E. Griffin R.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1997; 119: 796-802Crossref Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 15Warschawski D.E. Devaux P.F. Eur. Biophys. J. 2005; 34: 987-996Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) as opposed to the more well described 2H measurements. The order parameters of all agonist/DOPC mixtures (supplemental Fig. S1) are entirely consistent with previously published figures of fluid lamellar lipids, determined using the same DROSS sequence (14Gross J.D. Warschawski D.E. Griffin R.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1997; 119: 796-802Crossref Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 15Warschawski D.E. Devaux P.F. Eur. Biophys. J. 2005; 34: 987-996Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). It should be noted that the order parameters derived from 2H NMR experiments are systematically larger than those from DROSS measurements (15Warschawski D.E. Devaux P.F. Eur. Biophys. J. 2005; 34: 987-996Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). One-dimensional 1H MAS NMR on Membranes Doped with Agonist—Proton MAS spectra of DOPC lipid membranes in the presence and absence of 5HT1a receptor agonists are shown in Fig. 1. Assignments of the agonist signals were carried out on the lipid/agonist mixtures using MAS-correlation spectroscopy (data not shown) and MAS-NOESY experiments. Full 1H NMR assignments were performed. However, for the sake of simplicity, only two signal assignments for each agonist (one for each pole of the molecule) will be used for the analysis. 1H NMR assignments for 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine determined elsewhere (3Yau W.M. Wimley W.C. Gawrisch K. White S.H. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 14713-14718Crossref PubMed Scopus (832) Google Scholar) were used for the assignment of the DOPC signals. Although most DOPC proton resonances are resolved (Fig. 1F), it is worth noting that, of the two G1 proton signals, one overlaps with the headgroup α protons peak. In the following, the isolated peak at 4.49 ppm will henceforth be referred to as the G1 signal. 1H MAS NMR spectra of the brain lipid membranes are, in general, more convoluted than DOPC spectra. This is due to the higher complexity in composition of the membrane (see “Materials”). Broad lines and a narrow chemical shift dispersion result in numerous overlapping resonances (data not shown). 1H NMR signals of the agonist aromatic moieties (Fig. 1, A–E) are well resolved and downfield of the lipid resonances (>6 ppm). Aliphatic agonist signals overlap with the stronger lipid signals, with the exception of CH3 protons of 8-OH-DPAT (Fig. 1D, resonance 2), CH2 protons in the piperazine ring of quipazine (Fig. 1C, resonance 1), and CH2 protons in the cyclopentane ring of buspirone (Fig. 1E, resonance 2). The presence of agonists in the lipid membrane causes shifts in the lipid proton signals, because of the aromatic ring current effect (3Yau W.M. Wimley W.C. Gawrisch K. White S.H. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 14713-14718Crossref PubMed Scopus (832) Google Scholar, 10Scheidt H.A. Pampel A. Nissler L. Gebhardt R. Huster D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1663: 97-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 21Stamm H. Jackel H. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1989; 111: 6544-6550Crossref Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The strength of the effect rises with the proximity of the drugs aromatic rings to the lipid proton, whereas its sign is dependent on the orientation of the ring relative to the lipid proton. An analysis of these effects can indicate an average location and orientation of the aromatic rings of an agonist relative to the lipid molecules. All agonists induce significant shifts in the lipid signals (Fig. 2), most notably in between the top of the alkyl chains and the headgroup. Serotonin and LY-165,163 cause large shifts of the lipid headgroup resonances. All of the artificial agonists also cause large shifts to the C-2 and C-3 protons. Serotonin, buspirone, 8-OH-DPAT, and quipazine have very little or no effect on the protons in the remainder of the lipid chain. LY-165,163 is the only agonist that causes a significant shift in all signals throughout the alkyl chain region, but like the other molecules it has the largest effect on the C-2 and C-3 protons. In the DOPC membranes, all of the shifts are upfield (with the exception of a small downfield shift in the G-3 protons of serotonin-doped bilayers), indicating that the average location of the lipid protons is above the agonist rings. These observations are in good agreement with similar studies where the presence of tryprophan (3Yau W.M. Wimley W.C. Gawrisch K. White S.H. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 14713-14718Crossref PubMed Scopus (832) Google Scholar) and flavonoid analogs (10Scheidt H.A. Pampel A. Nissler L. Gebhardt R. Huster D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1663: 97-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) produced exclusively upfield shifts. MAS-NOESY Measurements on DOPC Membranes Doped with Agonist—A typical MAS-NOESY spectrum of serotonin in DOPC membranes is depicted in Fig. 3. Cross-peaks are visible between all aromatic serotonin and DOPC resonances. The build-up rates of the cross-peaks with increased mixing times give an indication of the proximity of two protons (supplemental Fig. S2). Consequently, the location probability of a particular agonist proton in the lipid membrane can be determined relative to other agonist protons. If multiple agonist proton signals are resolved (Fig. 1), the orientation of the molecule in the membrane may be determined as well. In general the maximum location probability for all aromatic protons is located between the headgroup and alkyl chain regions of the membrane (Fig. 4). Maximum peak intensities for all aromatic resonances are found between positions C-3 and G-3 of the lipid chain, in agreement with similar studies of aromatic molecules in lipid membranes (3Yau W.M. Wimley W.C. Gawrisch K. White S.H. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 14713-14718Crossref PubMed Scopus (832) Google Scholar, 9Siarheyeva A. Lopez J.J. Glaubitz C. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 6203-6211Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 10Scheidt H.A. Pampel A. Nissler L. Gebhardt R. Huster D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1663: 97-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Quipazine and LY-165,163 show markedly different behavior (Fig. 4, B and C). One end of the quipazine molecule has intense cross-peaks occur between the aromatic ring protons and the C-8 and C-11 groups situated half-way down the lipid chain. However, like the other agonists, very small cross-peaks are seen with the ω-CH3 group at the end of the lipid chain. LY-165,163 has significant cross-relaxation rates with the whole of the lipid molecule but with the maximum still between the C-3 and G-3 positions in the lipid chain. (Fig. 4B). Proton signals from opposite ends of the agonists indicate the interaction with different parts of the lipid molecules. The majority of the agonists shows only mildly different patterns of cross-peak intensities for either end of the molecule. In the case of serotonin, the ends of the molecules have a maximum location probability in the glycerol region of the membrane. The aromatic ring, however, has a distribution that is located closer to the top of the alkyl chain, whereas the pyrrole ring tends toward the headgroup (Fig. 4A). The aromatic ring of 8-OH-DPAT has a strong preference for the top of the alkyl chain, whereas its CH3 groups have a broad distribution stretching from the lipid C-3 group to the β CH2 in the headgroup (Fig. 4D). This would suggest that the alkyl chains of DPAT are highly mobile and do not have a strong location preference. Both the aromatic and isopentane groups of buspirone have location maxima in the glycerol region. However, the isopentane also has a significant cross-peak with the α-CH2 protons in the lipid headgroup (Fig. 4E), suggesting that buspirone has an angled orientation, with the isopentane group located higher in the membrane than the aromatic group. The strongest orientation bias is exhibited by quipazine; the aromatic ring is buried well within the hydrophobic chain, and the piperazine ring has a strong preference for the glycerol region (Fig. 4C). As a result quipazine appears to adopt an orientation parallel with the lipids. Most interestingly one end of LY-165,163 has two location maxima. The trifluoromethylbenzene ring has a clear location centered on the top of the lipid alkyl chain. However, the aniline ring, at the opposite end of the molecule has two location maxima, one in the lipid head group and the other in the lower alkyl chain region (Fig. 4B). It should be noted that signals from agonist methylene groups overlapping with the lipid signals may contribute to cross-peak intensities. However, MAS-NOESY measurements carried out at lower agonist concentrations (1:10 molar ratio) (data not shown) resulted in similar distribution profiles, indicating that this source of error is not of concern. Two-dimensional 13C MAS NMR on Brain Lipid Membranes Doped with Agonist—13C-detected NMR experiments offer increased resolution over proton-detected experiments (Fig. 5A). By extending the 13C measurements into a second dimension, using HETCOR measurements, 13C chemical shifts may be correlated with the chemical shifts of covalently bonded protons (Fig. 5B). The extra resolution of 13C measurements now resolves individual proton resonances in the crowded spectra of brain lipid membranes. The HETCOR spectra are further simplified because quaternary 13C nuclei, with no bonded 1H nuclei, do not appear in the spectrum. 13C lipid resonance assignments were based on previously published MAS NMR studies (22Holland G.P. Alam T.M. J. Magn. Reson. 2006; 181: 316-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) and confirmed by one-dimensional 13C spectra of DOPC and DOPC/cholesterol mixtures (data not shown). Phospholipid 13C and 1H signals of the alkyl chain and glycerol groups and phosphocholine and headgroups were assigned. The C-2 protons were not resolved in all brain lipid/agonist mixtures. Furthermore, the position of the alkene groups in the chains of brain lipids are variable and not good indicators of membrane location. Consequently, protons on the C-2, alkene groups, and carbons neighboring the alkene groups were omitted from use in the analysis of brain lipid data. Signals corresponding to the CH3 groups of cholesterol were easily resolved and assigned, because of their high signal intensities, compared with other CH groups (Fig. 5B). Many signals arising from the remaining cholesterol resonances and other components of the membrane were left unassigned. However, enough reliable assignments exist for a comparison between the neat DOPC lipid bilayers and the brain lipids. As found for experiments with bilayers consisting of neat DOPC lipids, introducing agonists to brain lipid bilayers causes changes in lipid proton chemical shifts. The magnitude of the peak shifts is illustrated in Fig. 6, where peak shifts are induced by the presence of serotonin (Fig. 6, where peaks without serotonin are black, and those with serotonin are blue). These results are summarized in Fig. 2, where they are directly compared with the induced chemical shift data in the DOPC measurements reported above. Overall, the agonist-induced chemical shifts on phospholipid protons in brain lipids indicate similar effects to those seen in pure DOPC membranes; only very small shift changes occur in the alkyl chain region of the membrane, larger changes are seen for the interface and phosphocholine headgroup resonances (Fig. 2). The only notable differences between the induced chemical shifts changes in brain lipids as compared with DOPC membranes occur with quipazine (Fig. 2C) and LY-163,165 (Fig. 2B) doped membranes. For the latter, the C-3 protons no longer experience shift changes significantly greater than other headgroup or interfacial protons, whereas for LY-163,165 doped brain lipid membranes, the alkyl chain below the C-3 group does not undergo any induced chemical shifts. It is worth noting that in brain lipid membranes more protons are shifted downfield by the presence of agonist. This is particularly evident in the glycerol region of LY-163,165 doped membranes (Fig. 2B) and in the alkyl chain region of quipazine, 8-OH-DPAT, and buspirone doped membranes (Fig. 2, B and C). Although the downfield shifts are minor (<0.02 ppm), their presence is significant, because downfield shifts are largely absent from the DOPC doped membranes, nor are they seen in comparable studies of doped single component membranes (3Yau W.M. Wimley W.C. Gawrisch K. White S.H. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 14713-14718Crossref PubMed Scopus (832) Google Scholar, 10Scheidt H.A. Pampel A. Nissler L. Gebhardt R. Huster D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1663: 97-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Well resolved cholesterol proton signals enable the extraction of information on the interactions between the sterol and agonists (Fig. 5B). The induced chemical shifts experienced by the cholesterol protons follow the same pattern as the phospholipid protons. The smallest changes are experienced by the groups situated closest to the bilayer center. Interestingly, agonists often cause comparable and in two cases larger shifts in the cholesterol protons than the phospholipid protons. This is especially noticeable for quipazine and 8-OH-DPAT doped membranes, where the magnitude of the cholesterol-induced chemical shifts is two to three times that experienced by the phospholipids protons (Fig. 2, C and D). A striking exception to the upfield (or small downfield) shifts was observed for cholesterol in the 8-OH-DPAT doped brain lipid membranes (Fig. 2D). Both the 21c and 18c protons experienced downfield shifts, where the 18c shift change was particularly pronounced (∼0.08 ppm). This work compares the locations of 5-HT1a receptor agonists in neat component membranes and multicomponent brain lipid membranes. The data give an indication as to how the membrane environment affects the way agonists may be delivered and presented to target proteins. The NOESY data show that the majority of the agonists have the highest location probability within the interface between the chain and headgroup regions. Furthermore, the agonist molecules lie with their long axis approximately parallel to the membrane plane (data summarized in Fig. 7). Quipazine is located deeper in the membrane (the quipazine benzene ring has its highest location probability in the upper alkyl chain region) and has a strong orientation bias that puts it perpendicular to the membrane plane. Interestingly LY-165,163 has an unusual location behavior. It has a significant population throughout the whole lipid bilayer, and the aniline ring has two location maxima at opposite ends of the lipid chain. The agonist aromatic rings alter the surrounding chemical environment, which manifests itself as a change in the chemical shift of proximate lipid proton NMR signals and provides a second indication for measuring the molecules location in the membrane. These induced chemical shift data, for both DOPC and brain lipids, broadly agree with the NOESY data; the agonists preferentially locate between the top of the alkyl chain and the choline headgroup. Some features of the induced chemical shift data are worth further discussion. First, the glycerol proton resonances experience very small agonist-induced chemical shifts, despite the fact that the NOESY data place the location of the agonists squarely in this region of the bilayer. Similar studies (with indole derivatives) (3Yau W.M. Wimley W.C. Gawrisch K. White S.H. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 14713-14718Crossref PubMed Scopus (832) Google Scholar) reported the same discrepancies between chemical shifts and NOESY data. This is likely to be due to the tight packing in this part of the membrane along with the proximity of lipid carbonyl group shielding, which produces a similar chemical environment to the agonist aromatic rings (23Gaede H.C. Yau W.M. Gawrisch K. J. Phys. Chem. B. 2005; 109: 13014-13023Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Hence, the presence of the agonist does not cause a significant change in the glycerol proton environment, making glycerol protons insensitive to aromatic induced chemical shifts. As a result, the induced chemical shifts of the glycerol resonances may under-represent the concentration of agonists in this part of the membrane. Serotonin induces large chemical shifts in the choline proton resonances of both DOPC and brain lipid bilayers. This is likely due to the water-soluble serotonin located in the aqueous phase surrounding the highly hydrated headgroup. Interestingly, the artificial agonists interact with the cholesterol in the brain lipid membrane to a similar or greater extent than with phospholipids. This has implications for the accumulation of the molecules in a membrane. Cholesterol is a major component of some lipid microdomains (7Ramstedt B. Slotte J.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1758: 1945-1956Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The fact that agonists cause a significant change in the chemical environment around the cholesterol implies that they may preferentially partition into lipid rafts. This may indicate how agonists cross the blood-brain barrier, especially because it is well established that ceramides (another component of lipid rafts) can modulate the permeability of lipid membranes to small solutes, dyes, and even proteins (24Goni F.M. Alonso A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1758: 1902-1921Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). More information on the interaction between cholesterol and the agonists can be extracted from the sign of the induced chemical shift changes. Quipazine and LY-163,165 both cause exclusively upfield shifts, indicating that the cholesterol protons are located above the plane of the agonists' rings. The cholesterol 18c and 19c CH3 protons stick up and out of the plane of the sterol rings, whereas the 21c CH3 protons branch out of the cholesterol alkyl chain. To achieve the upfield shifts, quipazine and LY-163,165 must roll around the cholesterol molecule. In contrast serotonin and buspirone cause a downfield shift in protons on the alkyl chain and upfield shifts in the CH3 groups substituted into the sterol rings. These results can be explained if the plane of the agonist rings stack below the sterol CH3 groups, whereas the mobile alkyl chain samples the space at the edge of the agonists' rings. Unlike the other agonists, 8-OH-DPAT causes downfield shifts in both CH3 groups on both the sterol ring and alkyl chain. This would seem to imply that it sits alongside and in plane with the sterol ring. It would therefore seem that although the agonists all interact (to a greater or lesser extent) with cholesterol, they do so in quite different ways, resulting in variable orientations relative to the cholesterol. The interfacial location of the agonists tested here may appear at odds with the fact that the synthetic agonists are all hydrophobic, as their water-octanol partitioning coefficients (Table 1) would indicate. However, it has been demonstrated numerous times that aromatic ring structures do not penetrate into the chain region of lipid membranes (3Yau W.M. Wimley W.C. Gawrisch K. White S.H. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 14713-14718Crossref PubMed Scopus (832) Google Scholar, 9Siarheyeva A. Lopez J.J. Glaubitz C. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 6203-6211Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 21Stamm H. Jackel H. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1989; 111: 6544-6550Crossref Scopus (55) Google Scholar). This has been attributed to numerous factors, including the entropic cost associated with intercalating a rigid ring structure into the mobile chain region (3Yau W.M. Wimley W.C. Gawrisch K. White S.H. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 14713-14718Crossref PubMed Scopus (832) Google Scholar), the fact that asymmetric aromatic molecules have dipole moments that cannot easily be accommodated in the nonpolar chain region of the lipid membrane (25Wimley W.C. White W.H. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 6307-6312Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar), and the enthalpic requirements of hydroxy, carbonyl, and other substitutions on the ring to fulfill their hydrogen bonding potential (26Ollila F. Halling K. Vuorela P. Vuorela H. Slotte J.P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2002; 399: 103-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 27Schiffer M. Chang C.H. Stevens F.J. Protein Eng. 1992; 5: 213-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar) (which cannot be achieved in the lipid chain region). Furthermore, bonding interactions between the π electrons of the lipid carbonyl group and aromatic rings (4Pinkus A.G. Custard H.C. J. Phys. Chem. 1970; 74: 1042-1049Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 5Dougherty D.A. Science. 1996; 271: 163-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (2366) Google Scholar) may serve to anchor the agonists in the interface region (3Yau W.M. Wimley W.C. Gawrisch K. White S.H. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 14713-14718Crossref PubMed Scopus (832) Google Scholar, 10Scheidt H.A. Pampel A. Nissler L. Gebhardt R. Huster D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1663: 97-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). The resulting interplay between the hydrophobic effect that drives the molecules into the hydrophobic core and a gamut of other factors forces them to locate in hydrated regions of the membrane. An important factor governing bioefficiency is the ability of the agonist to access the protein-binding site. To do this most efficiently, it must accumulate in the membrane close to the binding site and be presented to the protein in the correct orientation. Serotonin, 8-OH-DPAT, and buspirone accumulate in much the same region of the membrane and with similar orientations, whereas LY-165,163 is much more evenly distributed through the membrane. Quipazine is the only agonist that is oriented perpendicular to the membrane plane. It is therefore striking that, of the agonists tested here, quipazine has by far the lowest affinity for the 5-HT1a receptor. Most of the agonists have low nanomolar dissociation constants (28Peroutka S.J. J. Neurochem. 1986; 47: 529-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar, 29Millan M.J. Rivet J.M. Audinot V. Gobert A. Lejeune F. Brocco M. Newman-Tancredi A. Maurel-Remy S. Bervoets K. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1995; 273: 1418-1427PubMed Google Scholar) (Table 1) compared with 780 nm for quipazine (28Peroutka S.J. J. Neurochem. 1986; 47: 529-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). Quipazine orientation and location may go some way to explain its apparent lower affinity for 5-HT1a. It may be that the preferred location and orientation of quipazine makes it inaccessible to the protein-binding site. A further factor affecting the bioefficiency of an agonist will be its preference for particular microdomains within a membrane. It is becoming clear that some proteins preferentially locate in particular microdomains (8Allen J.A. Halverson-Tamboli R.A. Rasenick M.M. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2007; 8: 128-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar, 30McIntosh T.J. Vidal A. Simon S.A. Biophys. J. 2003; 85: 1656-1666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 31Lucero H.A. Robbins P.W. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2004; 426: 208-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). This raises the possibility that a key factor in the bioactivity of agonists is the ability to partition into the microdomain where their target protein is located. Indeed it is well known that the 5HT1a receptor is modulated by cholesterol (11Pucadyil T.J. Kalipatnapu S. Chattopadhyay A. Cell Mol. Neurobiol. 2005; 25: 553-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar), and a recent study has shown that it partitions into cholesterol-rich lipid rafts (8Allen J.A. Halverson-Tamboli R.A. Rasenick M.M. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2007; 8: 128-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar). This is particularly pertinent for the agonists tested in this study because they too interact with cholesterol and so may preferentially partition into lipid rafts. The system used here is a simplified model of the biological membranes within which the target proteins reside. However, the data show that molecules targeting the same protein can interact with a membrane in significantly different ways. Furthermore, some of the agonists tested interact more favorably with cholesterol than phospholipid components of brain lipid membranes. This in turn implies that some agonists may preferentially locate in cholesterol-rich lipid domains, where it has also been shown that the target protein is located. It also raises the intriguing possibility that the modulation of protein activity by the membrane is not exclusively through lipid/protein interactions but may also be due to lipid/drug interactions altering the location and orientation of the protein agonists. Further studies are underway to shed more light on the interactions between cholesterol and the 5HT1a used in this study. We thank Prof. Clemens Glaubitz for stimulating and insightful discussions.
